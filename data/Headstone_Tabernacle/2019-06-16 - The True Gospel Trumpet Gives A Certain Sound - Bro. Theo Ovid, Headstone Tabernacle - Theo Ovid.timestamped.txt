[58:30] rebellious house will I see the world I
[58:32] will perform it see it the Lord God we

[58:40] verse 8 for if the trumpet give an
[58:44] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[58:47] himself to the battle revelation 22:17
[58:51] and the spirit and the bride say come
[58:56] let him that heareth say come let him
[59:00] that is athirst come and whosoever will

[59:22] minister to the people inspire the words
[59:26] of them today in the name of Jesus and I
[59:28] pray father garda to reach down this is
[59:30] a Helen Paul and a family the bereaved
[59:33] Lord that you would comfort them that
[59:35] you would overshadow them on your love
[59:36] would surround them
[59:37] bless them Lord and cheese in my ask it
[59:39] amen and him then you will be seated
[59:52] it's always good to be in the house of
[59:56] God I know you hear me setup many times
[59:58] but I don't know how you consider it a
[1:00:00] privilege but it is a privilege if we
[1:00:05] were here killin time is one thing but
[1:00:07] every service every day we are nearer
[1:00:10] than we were before
[1:00:12] nearer to the common of the Lord so this
[1:00:16] morning of a title the true gospel
[1:00:19] trumpet gives a sittin sound the true
[1:00:24] gospel trumpet gives a certain song I
[1:00:28] love an inspiration here in recognizing
[1:00:32] and acting on the Word of God that's
[1:00:36] quite ready alright let's go in the
[1:00:39] Garden of Eden man was divided in two
[1:00:42] parts the devil took his head and God
[1:00:48] took his heart the devil makes him look
[1:00:51] at things and say well it just can't
[1:00:53] happen
[1:00:53] I can't reason talk God took his heart
[1:00:56] to dwell in his heart to make him
[1:00:57] believe things that his head don't even
[1:01:00] know nothing about so in the Garden of
[1:01:04] Eden the devil take the head and go take
[1:01:06] the heart or glory that God showed no
[1:01:09] matter what your head no matter where
[1:01:10] your head telling you what your mind
[1:01:12] telling you what your feelings telling
[1:01:14] you consider what God is telling you
[1:01:17] because he will speak how many believe
[1:01:21] God will speak so if it's in your heart
[1:01:27] you think down here that's where the
[1:01:29] real song comes from is from the heart
[1:01:32] that is where God talks and here is
[1:01:35] where the devil talks from so let's cast
[1:01:37] down what the devil said and takes a
[1:01:39] sitting song and that sitting song is
[1:01:41] God talking to your heart that is the
[1:01:44] truth and that is God promises so you
[1:01:47] act on the church today take a fight
[1:01:48] with me that's your own objective
[1:01:51] yeah come to church to cover us with me
[1:01:53] because I am just a messenger or glory
[1:01:56] not even a fight yet a fight with what
[1:01:57] God sealed because his word is what is
[1:02:00] above every one of us the word is God
[1:02:02] not to us God the word is God not some
[1:02:06] man has got the word is God hallelujah
[1:02:09] that's the plumb line the plumb line is
[1:02:11] the word glory to God so the reason and
[1:02:15] we we struck it and I try to send her
[1:02:16] the message that you would listen to
[1:02:18] Wednesday service I wake war the purpose
[1:02:20] of a trumpet and white guards have the
[1:02:21] top with the song it's our purpose God

[1:02:30] action is to get your moving
[1:02:32] if the trumpet give an uncertain sound

[1:02:36] be confusing I never saw me for the army

[1:02:45] assemble on in the courtyard whether it
[1:02:47] is what get your guns prepare for war a
[1:02:51] certain song bro you know and the reason
[1:02:54] is a trumpet is because that's the cot

[1:12:53] but three companions and in them
[1:12:55] different parts of the kingdom so this
[1:12:58] Daniel had three friends being who they
[1:13:00] were Shadrach Meshach and Abednego is
[1:13:04] not right here you are you ready
[1:13:07] Daniel standing alone with God
[1:13:13] held the victory for 68 years think of
[1:13:19] it
[1:13:22] 68 years he kept the victory and was
[1:13:26] undefined before God without the baptism
[1:13:30] of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:37] Daniel standing alone let's continue
[1:13:40] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:43] without the blood of Jesus to make
[1:13:45] intercession for him only with blood of
[1:13:48] bulls and goats and heifers that he had
[1:13:51] to offer secretly because of the hidden
[1:13:54] traditions of the Lamb that taken on
[1:13:58] death and I want you to notice how
[1:13:59] Daniel yes an alien yet oates it from
[1:14:02] his people out state from his church
[1:14:05] without warn children without any church
[1:14:10] to go to without any hymns to be sad
[1:14:13] what he sang himself in the midst of
[1:14:17] this he held on to what that prophet
[1:14:19] said you know Jeremiah didn't lie he
[1:14:24] know it wasn't Jeremiah he know was the
[1:14:27] spirit upon Jeremiah that told him there
[1:14:30] was just two more years left and he held
[1:14:32] on or glory no but are you holding on
[1:14:35] because you have to hold on you know
[1:14:37] when things falling on your right when
[1:14:40] things falling on your left when the
[1:14:42] buildings are caving and this is
[1:14:44] happening on your life you have to hold
[1:14:45] on that is when you have to trust God
[1:14:48] not when things going smooth and things
[1:14:50] going good when things are rough and I
[1:14:53] know for you somewhere here you things
[1:14:55] are rough or glory to God and if you
[1:14:58] don't hold on no it will get rougher but
[1:15:00] you have to hold on no because something
[1:15:04] better is coming if they could reach you
[1:15:06] the strong barrier if little bridge of
[1:15:09] this barrier ain't no stopping you now
[1:15:14] but it's a barrier than a break let's
[1:15:17] continue Daniel no church to go to
[1:15:20] nobody to fellowship with everybody was
[1:15:23] hidden temples everybody worship idols
[1:15:26] no Christian songs nobody believed the
[1:15:29] same thing he did and in 68 years from a
[1:15:33] young man about 12 14 years old so when
[1:15:37] he was taken from there he helped you to
[1:15:38] God what a testimony a young man 12 13
[1:15:43] 14 years old he'll shoot record for all
[1:15:46] them years without the baptism of the
[1:15:48] Holy Ghost with all the blood of Jesus
[1:15:50] mechanisation session without fellowship
[1:15:52] without church without encouragement
[1:15:54] without somebody what's up in him and
[1:15:56] call him on the phone to encourage him
[1:15:58] you waiting for somebody to encourage
[1:15:59] you you better and college yourself okay
[1:16:02] the Lord David said I encouraged myself
[1:16:04] oh that will warm the heart of any true
[1:16:13] prophet of God today as you look back
[1:16:15] and see that this troop of it said how
[1:16:17] know we are the end time he said I
[1:16:19] understood my books that Jerry my my
[1:16:22] brother many years ago prophesied that
[1:16:23] Israel would stay long 70 years and that
[1:16:26] time is about fulfilled and he made
[1:16:29] himself ready he called her fast
[1:16:32] he sanctify himself but this is
[1:16:34] important put it upon his head I went to
[1:16:37] fasting and praying to understand about
[1:16:39] what he was living in and if Daniel here
[1:16:42] we go
[1:16:43] the prophet of the Lord could consult
[1:16:45] Jeremiah books bring him to such a place
[1:16:48] that even Israel coming out of them
[1:16:50] alive was coming out of Babylon to go
[1:16:52] back and homeland will calm the fast and
[1:16:54] stuck on occasions how much more to be
[1:16:56] to do the Church of the Living God

[2:13:44] main so he told his éclairs Hanuman
[2:13:46] what is that proverb you having Alanna
[2:13:48] is were saying that these are prolong on
[2:13:51] every vision feel it time singing so
[2:13:54] long this message this revival this
[2:13:58] preacher is power taken too long because
[2:14:01] what have attainment is it tell them the
[2:14:08] seer the Lord I will make this proverb
[2:14:11] to cease oh oh
[2:14:15] glory to God do you love him this even
[2:14:17] breeze going to miss continuing here
[2:14:21] okey now in Corinthians 14 eight strip
[2:14:27] reread if the trumpet give an uncertain
[2:14:28] song because the bugle the trumpet is to
[2:14:32] give this song for the students to react
[2:14:34] not just a year oh god is some glowing
[2:14:36] or I thought Motel miss motor sleep no
[2:14:39] when the song joong bed blow it give a
[2:14:42] specific meaning it give a distinct song
[2:14:48] so let's have this polish the shoes of
[2:14:51] the clothes clean make up the bed
[2:14:54] patterns things become a bit they don't
[2:14:57] leave the soleus doesn't be the bedroom
[2:14:59] flop that's the make up the bed
[2:15:01] spick-and-span yeah they're soldiers
[2:15:03] things have to be in order because they
[2:15:05] are shoulders you fight because you are
[2:15:07] soldier you dress because you are
[2:15:09] soldier a man you have things clean up
[2:15:12] because you were soldier it's not right
[2:15:14] if he's a trained soldier he knows every
[2:15:17] song of the trumpet he is trained to the
[2:15:20] trumpet when the trumpet songs he said
[2:15:23] if the trumpet give an uncertain song
[2:15:25] then the soldier don't know what to do
[2:15:27] because he's only trained to the song of
[2:15:29] the trumpet he knows exactly what to do
[2:15:31] because the trumpet song then tells him
[2:15:33] what to do
[2:15:34] isn't that right now watch the solar is
[2:15:37] trained to a trumpet the son of a
[2:15:38] trumpet and the gospel trumpet the
[2:15:41] gospel the song of the word of God that
[2:15:44] comes my trumpet if one never knew the
[2:15:46] son of the gospel trumpet he'd be
[2:15:47] confused he didn't know what the word
[2:15:49] said what the word taught what the
[2:15:51] church said he'd be a bit confused and
[2:15:53] when he heard there's another trumpet he
[2:15:55] wouldn't know how to prepare himself so
[2:15:57] the trumpet means you are learning
[2:15:59] prepare yourself and the trumpet is song
[2:16:02] and exactly with the gospel and the
[2:16:04] people don't know how to act they don't
[2:16:06] know how to stand in line to make ready
[2:16:08] to battle they're confused because they
[2:16:10] have been listening to different
[2:16:11] trumpets creats denomination and
[2:16:15] sectarianism and that affects how they
[2:16:18] perceive how they supposed to act
[2:16:19] because the gospel itself yummy yummy
[2:16:22] no it's not just to listen it has to
[2:16:25] push you into action let me say it again
[2:16:29] what you are hearing is not to just
[2:16:32] listen it just to influence you to
[2:16:35] action no the Prophet to speak in here
[2:16:39] and this is something I want to get into
[2:16:40] but a woman she's in the hospital she's
[2:16:46] dying listen to this she leaves her
[2:16:51] husband she goes off and marry a
[2:16:53] Salesman maybe he's handsome big fellow
[2:16:56] she finds out he's not the man that her
[2:16:59] husband was after what she thinks well
[2:17:02] I've done that I will fall in love with
[2:17:03] somebody else she goes on she travels on
[2:17:06] she goes to church continually the
[2:17:08] pastor never took her name has never
[2:17:10] took her name from the book she goes to
[2:17:12] church she lives just like she wants to
[2:17:15] live the first thing you know now look
[2:17:17] mrs. durian Jesus Christ with all my
[2:17:18] heart I believe in it but the action and
[2:17:21] of fruits prove that she's not
[2:17:24] he said don't listen to the uncertain
[2:17:26] song let it someone from the gospel here
[2:17:28] who that she's not for she she wouldn't
[2:17:30] be doing them things she wouldn't be
[2:17:33] acting that way she will have different
[2:17:35] towards listen listen here we go she'll
[2:17:38] be governed by a different thing
[2:17:41] her soul I want to pay close attention
[2:17:45] to what we're eating here right now the
[2:17:48] first time she greeted back there when
[2:17:51] she started IRA out running around on
[2:17:53] husband yes I interlock here her soul is
[2:17:56] here there's a separation line that if
[2:17:59] she ever crosses it never cross back
[2:18:00] never come again she keeps on are after
[2:18:05] a while when she sins against this thing
[2:18:07] on the inside of her that speaks about
[2:18:09] the Word of God the first thing you know
[2:18:11] she will get
[2:18:12] involved in this intellect leave a
[2:18:14] little alone
[2:18:15] the Bible said the solar synergy that so
[2:18:18] shall die die means to separate then the
[2:18:22] soul there we go
[2:18:23] the conscience that once condemned you
[2:18:26] isn't there anymore and you're done go
[2:18:30] on intellectual you join some all cold
[2:18:34] formal church that don't believe in
[2:18:35] those things and the first thing you
[2:18:38] know the soul that condemns you for the
[2:18:39] first time you told a lie the first time
[2:18:42] you put on those short clothes the first
[2:18:44] time it is immoral acts will come so
[2:18:45] dead to you you won't feel it anymore on
[2:18:49] and on you go after wise death will
[2:18:52] catch up with you you're living out
[2:18:54] yonder your pastor will come and see all
[2:18:56] things they ready to go now everything
[2:18:57] is fine now with all the reason power
[2:19:00] she's going to church she gives charity
[2:19:02] she thinks so in her mind she follows
[2:19:05] the taste of her mind I know I got to go
[2:19:08] to church
[2:19:08] I should be friendly I should treat my
[2:19:10] neighbor right I should do this but she
[2:19:12] has grieved away the Holy Spirit then
[2:19:17] here we go in all of her debt she gets
[2:19:21] ready to die she's lean a bit and at
[2:19:25] once she wakes up and hollers oh my god
[2:19:28] I am lost the past has a giver hippo
[2:19:31] give an injection and he was given an
[2:19:34] injection and she would begin to see she
[2:19:35] can't speak she will Mumma what is it
[2:19:38] her soul has caught up with her before
[2:19:43] dead not only woman men also who's
[2:19:46] pulling the love of Jesus Christ who
[2:19:48] tell him don't make fun of it it will
[2:19:50] catch up with you some day a certain and
[2:19:53] I'm standing here this morning you
[2:19:55] grieve it so far till you can feel it no
[2:19:57] more but it will catch you some time
[2:19:59] again it will come back to you the dirty
[2:20:02] things the bad things that Taplin the
[2:20:03] babbling the backbiting the selfishness
[2:20:05] the things you have done all of that
[2:20:07] come back to you someday lain on the
[2:20:09] deathbed how the needle injection needle
[2:20:13] in these last days I stopped the
[2:20:15] deathbed confessions of Towson's shoot
[2:20:17] the needle him no ma'am he trying to
[2:20:19] speak what is it his soul
[2:20:22] caught up with him that soul and spirit
[2:20:24] is the spirit of the thing here that the
[2:20:27] intellect is fixed in the field so what
[2:20:29] he's showing you know this intellect
[2:20:30] this spirit the intellectual part is
[2:20:33] where you have your education where you
[2:20:35] have your degree where you have your
[2:20:37] boss and you're in charge of this
[2:20:38] company the CEO way is Prime Minister
[2:20:41] all that is in the spirit around here
[2:20:43] which is intellect and when somebody
[2:20:45] dies that pad breaks up so there's G C
[2:20:49] the CX c degree all of that breaks up
[2:20:52] because that is not relevant so that is
[2:20:55] conditionally so so when that intellect
[2:20:57] breaks up this short comes up now and
[2:20:59] the stories you review this soul reveals
[2:21:02] your real condition not your intellect
[2:21:04] your spirit well I'm fine I have a kind
[2:21:06] of a house of a land
[2:21:07] I was true in pulling back my house or
[2:21:09] whether it isn't whatever you think is
[2:21:10] good or what life is about
[2:21:12] whatever you interpret I like about all
[2:21:14] that breaks up that's the intellectual
[2:21:20] in fiction the fail is only in the main
[2:21:21] the ego the intellect show that you live
[2:21:25] by is going to perish but that soul you
[2:21:29] agree from your intellectual is going to
[2:21:31] hold you to eternity don't you listen to
[2:21:33] an uncertain song you believe the gospel
[2:21:36] in its fullness say I went to church I
[2:21:38] did what was right I pay my tithe those
[2:21:40] things are all right that's intellectual
[2:21:42] look when they're trying to stop that
[2:21:44] hippo needle in the arm and let them
[2:21:46] know me off they don't know nothing they
[2:21:48] trying to speak their soul has caught up
[2:21:50] with them they realize that the reason
[2:21:52] their mind is perishing with their
[2:21:54] brains so their brain cells dying their
[2:21:57] reason is dying the intellect is going
[2:21:59] and their stories coming up that
[2:22:05] intellect is where you get your rent to
[2:22:08] tell any son type all of it all of this
[2:22:10] year because I'm not really a daughter
[2:22:12] and every a Sun God release them sure
[2:22:15] and through you
[2:22:19] you some people's manipulate and control
[2:22:21] the children all that is right yes let's
[2:22:28] continue perishing with their brain the
[2:22:31] main your mind will perish with your
[2:22:34] death and I will prove it to you the lie
[2:22:37] detector don't take your mind it takes
[2:22:41] your soul the vibration of your nerves
[2:22:45] don't run on your mind it runs on your
[2:22:46] soul so your intellect will die when
[2:22:49] your brain ceases to function and that
[2:22:51] is why I do lie detector because when
[2:22:54] you put it like that and ask a question
[2:22:56] you could see it nice I did not steal it
[2:22:58] you could see it so but because the lie
[2:23:06] still your mouth saying it it's stupid
[2:23:11] but he didn't assume because you're hot
[2:23:14] solder is fast your blood pressure
[2:23:15] reason the machines telling you you did
[2:23:18] it if man of a machine I could say like
[2:23:21] one machine go ahead
[2:23:25] God will need all that machine to ask
[2:23:27] you questions that every man would be a
[2:23:31] lion manager so you can hide from God
[2:23:36] but I continue when the blood feels the
[2:23:41] poor to your brain the nerves cease then
[2:23:44] your mind goes away and your soul
[2:23:47] catches up with you and when this
[2:23:49] woman's soul catches up with her she
[2:23:51] said my god I am lost
[2:23:55] she's rolling
[2:23:56] she's an agony doctor said give her
[2:23:59] another one dead no until the death
[2:24:01] angels sweep her spirit from her but the
[2:24:05] hippo needle my dead in the flesh
[2:24:07] it's my debt in the mind but it can't
[2:24:09] didn't that soul that knows it's seen
[2:24:13] before God it will haunt a true
[2:24:15] ceaseless ages to Eternity that soul
[2:24:18] will still haunt and aunt and old as he
[2:24:21] is Rulon you came from where you go
[2:24:23] through where you came out of eternity
[2:24:25] you step into a space called time you go
[2:24:27] open it in the time in the eternity and
[2:24:29] what you are in your soul that you go
[2:24:31] out the same
[2:24:34] that's why the profits that you are what
[2:24:36] you I in your soul so when people was
[2:24:39] condemning somebody playing piano at a
[2:24:41] short dress she said but she have a fine
[2:24:42] spirit there was trying to take issue
[2:24:46] with the clothing but he saw beyond the
[2:24:48] clothing they could take issue with a
[2:24:50] woman of the well but yes or beyond that
[2:24:52] he saw the soul in that woman had a
[2:24:55] season at a germinate and he came to
[2:24:57] call that the Pharisees that appear to
[2:25:00] be white and clean they saw was black
[2:25:02] they had nothing beer because it
[2:25:05] rejected the Christ oh praise the Lord
[2:25:08] amen I want to belong again Oh
[2:25:10] hallelujah praise God watch something he
[2:25:13] said in the past of a comforting woman
[2:25:15] and said well our dear beloved sister
[2:25:16] she was such a loyal member of our
[2:25:17] church she came every Sabbath day she of
[2:25:19] the poor she had the needy she's done
[2:25:21] all these things today she's in glory
[2:25:24] they continue but if the truth was only
[2:25:28] known out into the haunting place called
[2:25:31] hell that soul that's separate from out
[2:25:35] here on earth that she listened to an
[2:25:37] uncertain song she went off into
[2:25:39] eternity without knowing God without
[2:25:41] doing Christ as a new bird she believed
[2:25:43] it in her heart she believed it in her
[2:25:44] mind she thought she was right but he
[2:25:46] was wrong it's your soul he said God
[2:25:49] have mercy
[2:25:50] listen to the song the gospel have no
[2:25:53] uncertain if the trumpet songs if a
[2:25:57] solar here's the bigger blow there are
[2:25:59] many veterans here this morning they
[2:26:00] know what retreat means they know what
[2:26:02] these different signals of this bugle
[2:26:03] songs and this bugle doesn't give us it
[2:26:05] a song just a big bunch of noise how
[2:26:07] will the soldier know to PP himself if
[2:26:10] one church say do this another church
[2:26:13] said do that one chants they do this
[2:26:14] another one do that how can the
[2:26:17] Christian know what to do
[2:26:18] one say wanting another one another but
[2:26:20] I tell you my dear brother I will tell
[2:26:22] you a place where there is no uncertain
[2:26:24] song that is in the Bible God's eternal
[2:26:28] Word it's the gospel and the gospel is
[2:26:31] the power and the demonstration the Holy
[2:26:33] Spirit in action no uncertain song the
[2:26:37] man who possesses it the woman who
[2:26:39] possesses it what a blessed
[2:26:40] no wonder David said the blessed Wilson
[2:26:43] lay-oh halle-loo is hidden power it's a
[2:26:46] hidden something no one city every man
[2:26:49] that is born of the Spirit of God knows
[2:26:51] when he passed from death unto life
[2:26:52] knows the place they are wait a minute
[2:26:54] when that changed her life
[2:26:55] when unbelief of the Bible changed to
[2:26:57] believe in the Word of God when haughty
[2:26:59] high-minded things changed to humble
[2:27:01] Christian life how do you know it's a
[2:27:03] certain song question Moses didn't think
[2:27:06] he could do it he tried his own doctoral
[2:27:08] standpoint but one day God spoke to him
[2:27:11] take off your shoes Moses I know your
[2:27:13] Prince of Egypt it was non-sitting how
[2:27:15] did Moses no that wasn't uncertain
[2:27:17] because the voice that was talk to him
[2:27:20] was exactly with the scripture so it
[2:27:23] can't be some voice tell you all kind of
[2:27:25] stuff northerners have to be with the
[2:27:27] structure that's how you know whether is
[2:27:30] a certain song if the script if the
[2:27:33] voice talking you isn't scriptural then
[2:27:35] don't listen to it it has to line up
[2:27:38] with the scripture because the script is
[2:27:40] the template is the plumb line is the
[2:27:43] umpire is the absolute or chlorine if is
[2:27:46] the anchor point or glory to God
[2:27:49] hallelujah we believe that if the voice
[2:27:52] talk of you isn't scripture then don't
[2:27:54] listen to it but if it's scriptural hear
[2:27:56] it cause it's the voice of God Moses
[2:27:59] went on and deliver the chera Israel
[2:28:01] because he heard a certain song Oh glory
[2:28:04] to God hallelujah praise God so when
[2:28:06] Jesus came he came to preach
[2:28:08] acceptability of the Lord which is the
[2:28:09] Jubilee is not right then all slaves and
[2:28:12] prisoners as they were was taken out the
[2:28:14] prison isn't that right no matter how
[2:28:16] low they're being bundage how long they

[3:09:16] on Thursday we'd like to invite everyone
[3:09:19] if possible to come to help tie ups and
[3:09:23] work projects that we have around in and
[3:09:25] around the tabernacle in preparation for
[3:09:27] the convention as well also convention
[3:09:30] related the menus for the meals that
[3:09:35] would be available for purchase during
[3:09:37] the convention the menus are on the
[3:09:39] notice board downstairs and there would
[3:09:43] be a table downstairs where if you are
[3:09:46] interested in pre-ordering your meals
[3:09:48] and we encourage you to pre-order so
[3:09:50] that we can have more management of how
[3:09:54] many meals need to be heated for it etc
[3:09:55] that you would certainly indicate to the
[3:09:58] team downstairs in addition we want to
[3:10:02] give a gentle reminder and encouragement
[3:10:04] for those of you who have made your
[3:10:06] pledges and your commitments
[3:10:09] to have a conversation with the sisters
[3:10:12] downstairs would take care of that and
[3:10:14] if you have not had the opportunity to
[3:10:17] do anything just yet we certainly
[3:10:20] welcome you to do so with respected
[3:10:23] Thursday if you have any questions about
[3:10:28] the different work projects you can see
[3:10:31] by the sheen after the service as well
[3:10:33] so and just as a general announcement
[3:10:36] July 5th 6th and 7th is our annual
[3:10:40] convention and we are the great
[3:10:42] expectation to have bleep brethren of
[3:10:46] like precious faith booth in Trinidad as
[3:10:49] well as overseas will be coming in for a
[3:10:51] wonderful time and it is not to be taken
[3:10:55] casually it is it is something that God
[3:10:58] would have seen happen before we were
[3:10:59] even born because I always say to
[3:11:01] friends is either God is in control or
[3:11:04] he's not in control if you're not in
[3:11:06] control then we finished
[3:11:07] but if he's in control and everything is
[3:11:09] already plan he ready see how everything
[3:11:11] on a workout and I brought over was
[3:11:13] preaching the day he sees when you were
[3:11:15] filled with the Holy Ghost you see when
[3:11:16] he make a mistake you'll to see when he
[3:11:18] restored and he sees when you come right
[3:11:19] back any sees when you get your heart
[3:11:21] right with gone and he sees you all the
[3:11:23] way to adoption to perfection on the
[3:11:25] rapture so we are trust in God that this
[3:11:28] convention would be a turning point not
[3:11:30] just for the Chilkoot for individuals in
[3:11:33] the church who are looking to get closer
[3:11:37] to God because it'll come a time the
[3:11:39] prophets puka when he will be able to
[3:11:40] gather like this and at that time you
[3:11:43] have to stand on your own when nobody
[3:11:45] else is around with that anchor at holes
[3:11:47] that is inside of your soul as a
[3:11:50] testament is an individual in the body
[3:11:52] of Christ gonna church say Amen
