[37:14] chapter 1 and verse 7 and 8.
[37:17] Okay so
[37:22] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 14.
[37:26] so this is how God is creating the world
[37:27] and so on like that
[37:29] he says in 114 and God said let there be
[37:31] lights in the firmament of the heaven
[37:34] to divide the day from the night
[37:37] and let them be for signs and for
[37:39] seasons and for days and years
[37:43] amen now over to Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[37:48] you want to read from verse one
[37:53] and it says to everything there is a
[37:54] season and a Time
[37:56] to every purpose under the heaven a time
[38:00] to be born and a time to die
[38:03] a time to plant
[38:04] a time to pluck up that which is planted
[38:07] a time to heal our time to kill and a
[38:10] time to heal a time to break down and a
[38:14] time to build up
[38:15] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[38:18] a time to mourn and a time to dance
[38:21] a time to Cast Away stones and a time to
[38:24] gather Stones together
[38:26] a time to embrace and a time to refrain
[38:29] from embracing
[38:30] a time to get in a time to lose
[38:32] a time to keep and a time to Cast Away
[38:36] time to render the time to sow
[38:38] a time to keep silence and a time to
[38:41] speak
[38:42] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[38:44] of War
[38:45] and a time of peace and now turn over to
[38:49] Acts chapter 1 and verse 7.
[38:54] our last scripture here it says and he
[38:56] said unto them it is not for you to know
[38:59] the times or the seasons which the
[39:02] father had put in his own power
[39:04] but ye shall receive power after that
[39:08] the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye
[39:11] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[39:13] Jerusalem and on all Judea and in
[39:15] Samaria and into the uttermost parts
[39:18] part of the earth may God a blessing to
[39:21] the Ring of his word let's just bow our
[39:22] heads one more time

[39:27] certainly demon a privilege and honor to
[39:29] come into your house tonight Lord Lord

[39:37] this world on you've called our hearts
[39:39] oh God far to peace Lord if we call our
[39:41] souls utter destruction oh God further
[39:44] Lord enter your Marvelous Light and so
[39:46] we thank you for your call upon our
[39:48] lives and so father we come into this
[39:49] place to hear from you tonight and Lord
[39:52] I come to Just Surrender now father to
[39:54] your will and to your way tonight have
[39:56] you perfect we may speak to the hearts
[39:57] of the people tonight Lord in a special
[39:59] way Lord father May anoint us and
[40:01] Inspire us Lord father May appoint your
[40:03] spirit Upon Us Lord and bless us Lord
[40:06] father as we look to your scriptures
[40:08] Lord as we fix our eyes upon you Lord

[40:13] to what is drawing us tonight Lord we
[40:16] pray to the Holy Spirit Come on minister
[40:18] to each heart and life although May no
[40:20] one leave the same way they come but
[40:21] Lord made even those on the internet
[40:23] Lord may we hear a word from the Lord
[40:25] tonight that would Inspire us Lord that
[40:28] would anoint us our fresh Lord Lord I
[40:30] will give us a fresh unction tonight
[40:32] granted Almighty Lord God we pray and
[40:34] ask these things now we pray for your
[40:36] preeminence and your total presence Lord
[40:39] and control tonight in Jesus name amen
[40:42] and amen praise God you ever have your
[40:44] seats tonight
[40:48] Hallelujah
[40:51] Glory
[40:53] praise God okay
[40:56] well we love the Lord and uh
[41:00] praise God we thank God for his presence
[41:02] amen so I have a thought tonight praise
[41:05] God and to Endeavor in the scripture for
[41:08] a few moments
[41:10] I have a title my title is times and
[41:13] seasons
[41:14] amen that's my title tonight times and
[41:18] Seasons praise God there's a time for
[41:21] everything
[41:22] under the heaven there's a time for
[41:25] everything on the earth and God is the
[41:28] one who is in charge of the times and
[41:31] the seasons because when Jesus was
[41:33] getting ready to ascend praise God is
[41:35] not right and leave his disciples for a
[41:37] while he spoken to them saying the Holy
[41:40] Spirit we're surely going to come upon
[41:41] you and they were asking you know when
[41:43] will be this kingdom of God common when
[41:46] is things going to happen and things
[41:47] gonna take place according to prophecy
[41:49] and Jesus answered to them was saying
[41:52] that you it's not for you to know the
[41:55] times all the seasons which the father
[41:57] had put in his own power but you are
[42:00] gonna receive power praise God after
[42:03] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[42:05] you shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[42:07] Jerusalem so in other words he's telling
[42:09] them that praise God our times and
[42:12] seasons and dispensations are all in the
[42:14] hand of God
[42:16] but he said also tell her when your
[42:18] season come around you have to be
[42:20] looking for one thing you have to be
[42:22] looking for the power oh Hallelujah
[42:25] because there's gonna come a season for
[42:27] the power oh Hallelujah and that's what
[42:30] you've got to have your eyes fixed on oh
[42:33] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[42:35] so God loves to stretch things out in
[42:38] time I praise God I notice that more and
[42:41] more as you read the scriptures you
[42:43] study it and as you look at the
[42:45] testimony of God's servants lives
[42:48] throughout the ages and how God deal
[42:51] with his sons how God deal with his men
[42:53] with his daughters throughout eons of
[42:56] time you could see that he always
[42:58] stretched things out in time
[43:01] that time proves all things time proves
[43:04] that the word of God is faithful time
[43:07] proves that the word of God is true
[43:10] though the journey is long though your
[43:13] mind get weary though your heart get
[43:15] weary and though people get a use of
[43:18] things and people get disenchanted and
[43:21] some might walk away all is not right
[43:24] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[43:28] renew their strength we're living in a
[43:30] time when young men even young men shall
[43:33] faint and utterly fall but I say they
[43:37] that wait tonight upon the Lord shall
[43:40] renew their strengths they shall run and
[43:42] not be wary they're gonna walk and not
[43:45] faint oh Hallelujah so tonight we've got
[43:49] to be taught how to wait until our time
[43:52] comes until our Seasons come because
[43:55] when your season come there's nothing
[43:58] the devil could do about your season
[44:01] there's nothing the devil could do about
[44:04] your time when the time has come for you
[44:08] to be liberated when the time has come
[44:10] for the change to break when the time
[44:13] comes for the captive to be set free
[44:15] when the time comes for the sick to be
[44:19] here for the dumb to speak for the blind
[44:22] to see for the to walk when that
[44:25] time comes there's nothing anybody can
[44:28] do about it because times and Seasons oh
[44:32] it's in the father's hand or can it get
[44:35] amen tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah
[44:40] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory
[44:43] to God
[44:44] amen
[44:46] and so in Genesis we read
[44:49] that God said let there be lights in the
[44:51] filming of the heaven to divide the day
[44:53] from the night
[44:54] and let them be foresights and for
[44:57] seasons and for days and for years
[45:00] praise God isn't that right so these
[45:03] seasons will be declared even from the
[45:06] beginning
[45:07] from a Heavenly Herald a man was
[45:11] declaring the signs and the seasons upon
[45:13] the Earth isn't that right before God do
[45:17] anything on the earth he always declares
[45:19] it in the heavens praise God because we
[45:22] know that there's three Bibles isn't
[45:23] that right there's a zodiac the written
[45:25] bible and that permit Bible amen amen
[45:28] which is Christ into the hope of glory
[45:29] praise God but since the beginning when
[45:32] he established this star consolation
[45:35] this zodiac praise God it declared times
[45:38] and Seasons amen so you know rain is
[45:41] coming you know sun is coming you know
[45:43] winter and fall and all these things
[45:45] praise God because it's tied in praise
[45:47] God to what God has established from
[45:49] since the beginning
[45:51] it's not right glory to God and we don't
[45:54] have as much seasons as they have in
[45:55] temperate zones or in temperate climates
[45:58] isn't that right like the Autumn and the
[46:00] fall and the winter and so forth like
[46:01] that praise God we just have rainy and
[46:03] sunny season most of the time amen
[46:06] praise God but right now we're in a
[46:08] season when the nights are cold and we
[46:10] feel quite comfortable at night but it's
[46:12] gonna come a time when the nights are
[46:14] hot and he breatheses hot and he found
[46:17] no help and they need a AC because the
[46:20] season has changed oh Hallelujah isn't
[46:23] that right hey you feel the difference
[46:25] praise God even the wood gets affected
[46:28] your door something I can't open because
[46:30] pretty good the season has changed
[46:32] things are changing around you oh
[46:35] Hallelujah and God is in charge of all
[46:37] of that because when God is getting
[46:39] ready to do something he gets ready he
[46:41] announces a new season because because
[46:44] we're not seasoned and announce
[46:45] something begin to take place there are
[46:48] things you cannot help in a new season
[46:50] there are things you cannot help but
[46:52] from coming forth when it's a Time on
[46:54] the season for it oh when it's a time of
[46:57] sowing you have to sow the seed it's a
[47:00] labor of time oh it's labor in an
[47:03] opinion you don't see no evidence you

[47:26] the Dark Skies you can't worry about the
[47:29] sunny skies you just got to sow your
[47:31] seed oh Hallelujah and that's what Jesus
[47:34] when he was here he's
[47:40] the sower of the seed oh hallelujah

[48:01] sinful man and in three days he's gonna

[48:06] it but he had to sow that seed because

[48:18] three days I'll raise it up myself oh

[56:53] raising up the Dead the gospel preacher

[57:17] oh my let me read some quotes here
[57:20] praise God you want some evidence
[57:22] all right uh we're talking about the
[57:24] Zodiac right so the prophet said in a
[57:26] message shalom
[57:27] 1964 he said now even in the Zodiac I'm
[57:30] going to go back and teach zodiac but
[57:32] I'm just showing you in the heavens
[57:33] declared he said in the Zodiac we find
[57:36] out in the consolation of stars that he
[57:38] declared the whole Bible
[57:40] in the consolation of the zodiac amen so
[57:44] everything is in there
[57:46] praise God no one that he told Abraham
[57:48] come outside your tent and look up at
[57:50] the stars so shall I see it be it wasn't
[57:53] just a light thing but all that God
[57:56] promised all that God spoke was in the
[57:59] heavens he had already set it Hallelujah
[58:02] Thy word is settled in the heavens
[58:05] forever oh how you can't argue with that
[58:08] and a prophet of God God gave us a
[58:11] prophet in this last day to leave
[58:13] Earthly Realms and to go up into the
[58:16] heavens and to pick up the word for all
[58:19] day and then come down and speak it
[58:21] therefore seven Thunders it's not a
[58:24] man's message but that's God's message
[58:27] to the people that's called Divine
[58:29] promise and by these divinely revealed
[58:32] mystery truths it's going to literally
[58:34] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[58:37] fathers oh Hallelujah back to the
[58:39] apostolic fate back to what they had
[58:42] back there oh hello signs wonders
[58:44] Miracles a church sell us for the things
[58:46] of God oh had it proven the word
[58:49] preaching the gospel every every
[58:52] creature to every man such as would be

[59:15] message saying what the tape say because
[59:17] Rapture and Faith lean in them same
[59:20] tapes after a while he said she'll find
[59:23] where it is written after a while she'll
[59:25] find her message for her day and tonight

[1:15:13] perfectly rejected nowhere for him to
[1:15:17] turn he's in prison
[1:15:21] his hands are bound

[1:16:29] he was just there waiting
[1:16:32] what a condition to be in
[1:16:34] Italian Butler listen

[1:16:50] always there in the prison and power
[1:16:52] doesn't matter where you are
[1:16:54] what blessing God put upon you is
[1:16:57] blessing is blessed well God blesses
[1:16:59] bless oh what God anointed is Anointed
[1:17:03] when God anointed David you feel he
[1:17:05] didn't know David was going to go

[1:17:08] running around running failed for his
[1:17:11] life and so forth like that he had to
[1:17:13] play mat to get away from some of them
[1:17:14] praise isn't that right Hallelujah but
[1:17:17] God's blessing was still upon David God
[1:17:19] was just getting him ready for his
[1:17:21] throne all his taught us training him
[1:17:23] out there in hardship in trial and pain
[1:17:27] in torment though he can't see nothing
[1:17:31] though it's dark everywhere he can't see
[1:17:34] his hand in front of him he hiding in
[1:17:36] deserts and in caves and in dense but he
[1:17:39] always feared the Lord he always had a
[1:17:42] love for the courts of God and he always
[1:17:44] do the glove of God was set upon him
[1:17:46] because since the time when Samuel
[1:17:49] anointed him with that oil the anointing
[1:17:51] was upon David wherever David went the
[1:17:55] anointing followed him he was already
[1:17:57] anointed to be king and you tonight you

[1:18:11] but that presence was still there he
[1:18:15] doesn't take it away
[1:18:18] foreign
[1:18:20] because he had set his love upon me
[1:18:24] David said therefore when I offer him
[1:18:27] his Tabernacle
[1:18:28] sacrifices of Praise oh we ought to come
[1:18:32] into church every day and give praise to

[1:26:28] Baptist the prophet praise God he finds
[1:26:30] it here he said that's right he said

[1:26:50] is what we need oh Hallelujah is that
[1:26:53] what you need tonight is that what we're
[1:26:55] looking for looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:26:57] back in the church oh the Holy Ghost so
[1:26:59] bring reverence the main humility to
[1:27:02] bring respects
[1:27:04] Prophet actually said there's going to
[1:27:05] be another anunia sense of fire and a
[1:27:07] few of them when that church begins to
[1:27:09] get back into his mighty power
[1:27:11] isn't that right and what happened there
[1:27:13] the Holy Ghost took up residence in the
[1:27:15] heart of Peter
[1:27:17] isn't that right
[1:27:18] come in the church lying
[1:27:22] bring in something falsely telling them
[1:27:24] this is all the money pray he's gone
[1:27:26] it's not right and it wasn't praise God
[1:27:30] and and and and no matter what Grouse
[1:27:33] they had with Peter I don't know what
[1:27:35] relationship they had in the Earthly
[1:27:37] sense but they should have at least had
[1:27:39] enough respect to respect that man's
[1:27:41] office to respect the office that he
[1:27:44] held
[1:27:45] but they didn't understand the season
[1:27:46] they were in they didn't understand the
[1:27:49] time that they were in it wasn't a time
[1:27:51] for playing games it was not time for
[1:27:53] hiding and showing a false report wasn't
[1:27:56] a season for that the season had changed
[1:27:58] oh that is not right but they clearly
[1:28:01] were out of it because they lacked the
[1:28:03] respects the humility it took to
[1:28:05] approach that man of God
[1:28:08] despite how they knew him everybody know
[1:28:10] he's a fisherman he used to be this
[1:28:11] thing whatever
[1:28:12] it's not right in the Earthly sense
[1:28:14] praise God but forget about what he is
[1:28:16] in the Earthly sense when that season
[1:28:18] changed you got to recognize God's man
[1:28:20] on the earth identified by anointing my
[1:28:23] manifestation praise God by power praise
[1:28:26] God the prophet said if you can't
[1:28:28] respect the man respect the office he
[1:28:29] holds
[1:28:30] it's not right and they're coming there
[1:28:32] with disrespect lying to the Holy Ghost
[1:28:35] because Peter said you didn't lie to me
[1:28:37] you lied to the one who sits on the
[1:28:40] throne in the Shell of a body you're
[1:28:42] seeing there's a holy spirit sitting in
[1:28:45] the throne and because you come in here
[1:28:47] lying
[1:28:48] they've got got cut off isn't that right
[1:28:51] and the prophet said that will repeat
[1:28:53] again
[1:28:55] so we got to get our minds in our gear
[1:28:57] we gotta get get to practice in this
[1:29:00] presence of God and that's what it
[1:29:02] really means humility respects being
[1:29:06] humble before God forgiveness brotherly
[1:29:08] kindness having the right attitude
[1:29:10] towards one another
[1:29:12] not knowing maybe you might be
[1:29:13] entertaining Angels unawares you don't
[1:29:16] know you just got to have respects
[1:29:18] however you just got to have humility
[1:29:20] come with the right approach and God
[1:29:23] will bless you pray for your for your
[1:29:27] approach amen
[1:29:34] praise God and God's gonna try it so all
[1:29:36] of this been trial trial coming all
[1:29:38] these through these years what he's been
[1:29:40] doing trying to prove the word in you
[1:29:41] get you in a certain mind for it and a
[1:29:43] certain gear praise God said and that
[1:29:45] which is perfect is come because that's
[1:29:47] what you're in part will be done away
[1:29:49] with at that time praise God Amen we
[1:29:51] come into Perfection praise God it takes
[1:29:53] a certain mode a certain reality to
[1:29:55] bring that and gods have been trying to
[1:29:57] bring that to us all through the years
[1:29:58] praise God but he's going to manifest it
[1:30:01] praise God but you've got to have it
[1:30:02] inside David said Thy word O Lord have I
[1:30:06] hid in my heart said I might not sin
[1:30:08] against you hey hide a word in your
[1:30:10] heart tonight amen amen praise God
[1:30:13] hallelujah stay with that word amen oh
[1:30:16] my let's practice the presence of God
[1:30:18] amen I've loved one for another and in
[1:30:21] so much you love God Amen when you love
[1:30:23] each other amen is that right all right
[1:30:25] let me look to close out here times so
[1:30:28] far spent amen um
[1:30:31] he said cleans up set aside right then
[1:30:33] he doubted it too okay musician can get
[1:30:35] ready he said anything to do but God's
[1:30:37] Gonna confirm his word don't you worry
[1:30:38] God is able of these stones to rise up
[1:30:40] children to Abraham he said John watch
[1:30:42] then all of that then in all of that
[1:30:44] what taken place God was sure to bring
[1:30:45] it to pass because it was the season and
[1:30:49] the time it was at the season and it was
[1:30:51] at the time it's not right he said his
[1:30:53] words every Cog must fit in the same
[1:30:55] place with them prophetic Wheels to
[1:30:58] begin to roll together then it's got to
[1:31:01] happen oh so what has he been doing all
[1:31:03] these years getting the cogs in the
[1:31:04] right place
[1:31:08] in Christ when that prophetic will goes
[1:31:11] to Rolling together oh because brother
[1:31:13] may not be here but that prophecy Still
[1:31:15] Remains the Same what he said will come
[1:31:18] to pass so when those Wheels began to
[1:31:20] roll together every man could take his
[1:31:22] place in the body of Christ isn't that
[1:31:24] right amen amen it's got to happen the
[1:31:27] prophet saying when it starts moving and
[1:31:29] there is the coming of time prophecy see
[1:31:32] when right now he said in the near
[1:31:33] future he said that when that great
[1:31:36] judgment is going to come upon these
[1:31:38] nations that forget God America and all
[1:31:41] these things here isn't that right when
[1:31:42] you get put up with when when you put up
[1:31:44] with what I've seen the last few days
[1:31:45] seen around the country out in the name
[1:31:47] of religion living the way people are
[1:31:49] living He said no wonder communistic
[1:31:52] things breaking out and things are the
[1:31:53] way they are he said that the Bible
[1:31:54] teaches that's right he said we're
[1:31:56] letting down we're compromising but

[1:32:35] says on he said that sat upon the throne
[1:32:36] said behold I make all things new and he
[1:32:40] said unto me right for these words are
[1:32:43] true and faithful and he said unto me it
[1:32:45] is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:32:47] beginning and the end and I will give to
[1:32:49] him that is a thirst of the Fountain of
