[1:37:48] is what in spirits a harvest is the end
[1:37:50] of oneself and I got a freak on the
[1:37:53] Scriptures there is because the kucik
[1:37:55] Genesis one she does we shot 26 to 28
[1:37:58] percent with Genesis 2:7 explicit and
[1:38:00] send John 4:1 I think which brother a
[1:38:04] cigarette from last night is that where
[1:38:06] it says
[1:38:07] the Lord of the harvest has the word I'm
[1:38:11] looking for their mukacheve spray she is
[1:38:14] therefore the lord of the harvest ahead
[1:38:17] to do the monsoon aiming all the words
[1:38:18] for the pan I'm saying is asking you it
[1:38:22] would pray to him
[1:38:23] the PA already knows what they need is a
[1:38:26] secure loop this so why wouldn't he just
[1:38:28] be a coupon to the fan but because he
[1:38:30] wants you to pick up food to be part of
[1:38:32] the process but this is a benefit don't
[1:38:35] prefer your cooking a fellow laborer our
[1:38:37] love with a kiss hands with the king of
[1:38:41] kings a lot of law said pray ye a lot of
[1:38:46] they have read in other words but the
[1:38:49] threat to me I would not say ministers
[1:38:55] me this is a laborious order to the
[1:38:58] harvest for the harvest is plentiful but

[2:10:08] planted a thesis let the earth be cooler
[2:10:11] prints to reproduce so the seed is in a
[2:10:14] civilized person who can world
[2:10:17] what is the original see in a civil suit
[2:10:20] planted desires in the touch of the
[2:10:24] ground push through the purple shed into
[2:10:28] season incessant to turn on puto
[2:10:32] every see super sort of its time so the
[2:10:35] pro to distress is brought forth fruit
[2:10:37] Putin heavy fruit was very simple same
[2:10:42] and I can be planted against a man so
[2:10:47] you see right there
[2:10:48] she's a great husband man good a lot of
[2:10:51] a harvest in Genesis the principles that
[2:10:56] commonly have a song hallelujah
[2:10:59] hallelujah orator God watch usual
[2:11:02] because a lot of you have asked me to go
[2:11:05] to him fully understand
[2:11:12] it is the power of the power of the so
[2:12:22] fully honest and fully understand their
[2:12:24] origin is in the harvest do not once we
[2:12:27] have got to go to the lot of the Holly
[2:12:30] to let us understand about the origin
[2:12:34] water represents it Kelly please on what
[2:12:37] it means to you and if you don't think I
[2:12:40] just look because jesus said as she say
[2:12:55] harvest and what since the end of the
[2:12:57] world in our faith wounds
[2:12:58] amen I mean now this means many things
[2:13:02] develop
[2:13:04] should not be pillow amen a spiritual
[2:13:06] eye to look at the Word of God they can
[2:13:10] be a parallel length the breath DUSU
[2:13:14] flow then they hide loose oof now what
[2:13:17] the depth of a life to get a bird's-eye
[2:13:20] view
[2:13:20] of well a helicopter view of the Word of
[2:13:24] God holiday to to another world
[2:13:27] Penelope like a second co they set so
[2:13:30] that shoots that one stab more from that
[2:13:33] one stab goes on another five unit 1200
[2:13:36] meter goes and the five stances this is
[2:13:38] sick it is split seconds time is she was
[2:13:41] you have fallen all by stairs coup
[2:13:44] that's the power of a single rat since
[2:13:47] Angela we so silly to you does empower
[2:13:51] set up priests or the scripture the
[2:13:53] liquid to when Jesus said here since
[2:13:55] you're the harvest is the end of one so
[2:13:57] set up of the world of people that means
[2:14:00] many things sum total of it is this to
[2:14:04] the harvest is the end of one so
[2:14:07] cellophane of course Jesus was speaking
[2:14:09] she Paula about the great harvest final
[2:14:13] homage at the end of the age but how you
[2:14:17] can or even know me comments cook with
[2:14:19] so no place in the principal completely
[2:14:25] Polly thanks home from they have a
[2:14:26] sheikh abu talks about people from
[2:14:29] Genesis to Revelation from way back in
[2:14:35] eternity Jesus was speaking she pilot
[2:14:41] the harvest is the end of the world not
[2:14:43] enough anymore
[2:14:44] but here's the point here then what's to
[2:14:46] the point was principal the principal of
[2:14:49] the high branch Universal is that the
[2:14:50] harvest is the end one song a long term
[2:14:53] Bitcoin it has an end it automatically
[2:14:55] follows me sooner it has a beginning
[2:14:57] much Cuba solution so the principle here
[2:15:00] see the prince is that there's the
[2:15:02] beginning like como super on an end so
[2:15:05] everything in this wall here below such
[2:15:08] shows she said the pain in other words
[2:15:10] I'll put the harvest Nam what says the
[2:15:12] end of the world in a beautiful it can
[2:15:15] also be translated to mean soon opposes
[2:15:17] the harvest to the muscle is the end
[2:15:19] LFL of everything in this world the two
[2:15:22] choices she Saturday they harvest the
[2:15:24] most represents the present end of all
[2:15:27] anything you begin this process the
[2:15:30] harvest
[2:15:32] that's how they harvest but tsukasa's
[2:15:34] influence how you define is say in every
[2:15:38] single area of your life capisce that's
[2:15:41] why they have a swell up what was it say
[2:15:44] in every single day of your life
[2:15:47] shoot whether you realize it or not
[2:15:49] you're put in reality you are writing
[2:15:51] your story people are writing your
[2:15:54] harvest stories that creepy but this
[2:15:56] photo was one little action Oh
[2:16:00] hallelujah a man having an is this very
[2:16:06] simple principle is the principle that
[2:16:08] there's a beginning and an end to
[2:16:12] everything in this wall shows no subbu
[2:16:14] is this principle the supreme some makes
[2:16:16] the harvest he preaches origins notices
[2:16:19] concepts or constraints practice that's
[2:16:23] what makes it the story of us plus is
[2:16:24] the key because every single day asking
[2:16:27] such - it's not something to do in
[2:16:29] something it's not and the shoes is the
[2:16:33] big one is coming the final harvest is
[2:16:36] coming up you are who you are right in
[2:16:39] your hyper story goddamn right Oh every
[2:16:48] single one of you every man every woman
[2:16:52] every boy so every girl so once you get
[2:16:55] to that age of accountability right is
[2:16:58] your have a story whose it one day at a
[2:17:01] time
[2:17:02] shut you one little step at a time every
[2:17:05] single day you are writing your stories
[2:17:07] one or every day suctions one little
[2:17:11] step for a man one giant leap for your
[2:17:16] for your whole life story pull these two
[2:17:18] are the end of the day at the end of the
[2:17:20] age
[2:17:21] we are gonna find out loser on how you
[2:17:24] wrote your story hope I wrote your have
[2:17:26] a story for this powe hallelujah
[2:17:30] hallelujah the hacker story simply means
[2:17:35] every time Chuck form anything such
[2:17:38] shows any processes such as many
[2:17:41] activities systems axis anything at all
[2:17:45] you choose is this water that has a
[2:17:48] beginning has an end because they have a
[2:17:51] system has an end slow and see your
[2:17:55] results you can see your reward growth
[2:17:59] but upward or takes away from growth you
[2:18:01] see what I expose you just one decreases
[2:18:04] you your slope you can order you have a
[2:18:06] good average hallelujah so anything has
