[42:45] this morning in the Lord when a time
[42:48] last week to recognizing your D on this
[42:49] message and that was a love letter
[42:57] LeBron on being a messenger to send you
[43:00] a message you're the brain message come
[43:03] in to you so this morning we see what
[43:06] Lord will do and I know I guess many of
[43:10] you would have heard about this eclipse
[43:12] and I was speaking about a Gabriel stuck
[43:15] initiate something with me I want to
[43:16] share with you considering that this
[43:18] morning was the longest Blood Moon the
[43:20] special Blood Moon of July 27 the
[43:24] Eclipse that we just witnessed in is the
[43:26] second total lunar eclipse of 2018
[43:29] totality lasted 103 minutes making it
[43:32] the longest eclipse of the 21st century
[43:35] total lunar eclipses occur at full moon
[43:37] when the moon shadow of the earth the
[43:39] world is projected on the moon the
[43:42] longest eclipse of the century 1:03
[43:45] minutes which is the number 13 again
[43:48] which indeed we first the Revelation
[43:51] chapter 13 doing the total lunar eclipse
[43:54] the Sun did it and Moon line up in space
[43:56] as for war the greatest battle ever
[43:59] fought light versus darkness the Prophet
[44:02] said and the great message Shalom the
[44:03] world is in one of the most chaotic
[44:05] times of darkness that it ever stood in
[44:08] there's this red blood lunar eclipse
[44:11] speaks of total complete apostasy the
[44:15] church has gone into and this is where
[44:17] you know God has her to bring back that
[44:20] restoration anointing because the church
[44:23] fell away demon activity came into the
[44:26] church by preachers and men and on all
[44:29] these kind of things and crushed the
[44:30] church and drive it right on into
[44:32] darkness and Gotha to raise up looter
[44:35] a Catholic there was everybody was wiped
[44:38] out almost gone after going to Catholic
[44:40] Church a final man could imagine that
[44:42] God had to go into the Catholic Church
[44:45] the final man looking for breakthrough
[44:47] and from luta and Luther was a protest
[44:50] n't and that God was restoring to luta
[44:52] then Wesley then Pentecost and then goes
[44:55] on a prophet to gather all the word
[44:57] together that it can have a bright in
[44:59] the last days see we're not here to have
[45:01] church we are here to become bright it's
[45:05] two different things all together you
[45:07] could go to us anywhere today but this
[45:09] is different this is if you want to
[45:11] become bright and you can only come
[45:14] bright by his word so you don't come
[45:16] here to hear nice things and I'm floor
[45:19] everything to hear you come here to hear
[45:20] the word isn't that right so this will
[45:23] glue this with this red blood lunar
[45:25] eclipse speaks of total complete
[45:27] apostasy the church is gone and the
[45:29] message of Malachi 4 has been completely
[45:31] turned on by many of his followers
[45:32] however all these eclipses that occur
[45:35] every year a special signs that God
[45:39] showing us kind to remind his bride that
[45:42] in spite of gross darkness comedy earth
[45:44] and the people he the gritty over
[45:47] shallow is here to make his worth more
[45:50] positive in the midst of this great
[45:53] chaotic time and all the distress of the
[45:56] nation's his says he says to his bride
[45:58] Shalom my beloved Brian
[46:00] arise and shine for the glory of the
[46:04] Lord has come upon you peace be on to
[46:06] you I'm coming to take you home and to
[46:09] judge this sinful world like in said in
[46:12] Isaiah the morning comet and the night
[46:14] also I'm Wendy before the morning star
[46:17] comes out the darkness come first and
[46:19] then the mornings as the morning star
[46:21] come out it's not right so you're gonna
[46:23] get that the light first and then
[46:25] darkness gonna strike the will after
[46:27] Amen the moon turning red is very
[46:30] significant science is that whenever the
[46:32] sunlight passes through the atmosphere
[46:34] the air molecules filter different types
[46:37] of light for instant blues and purples
[46:39] are more easily scattered since they
[46:41] have a shorter we've linked while red
[46:44] and orange which have a longer
[46:45] wavelength can
[46:46] more easily passed your atmosphere they
[46:48] get bent redirected onto the moon
[46:50] service as we all know the profit
[46:52] message the color red represent perfect
[46:54] love anything I had a beginning has an
[46:56] end its door sting with not have any
[46:59] beginning has an end husband land and
[47:01] did you have a think of that gourd great
[47:04] master in what Isabella random in the
[47:06] skies we see like seven spirits of God
[47:09] red perfect love this home you must be
[47:11] born again and when that Great Spirit of
[47:13] God which is love God was like a great
[47:15] rainbow we would imagine when he looks
[47:17] like he looks like the rainbow dam
[47:19] spirits the perfect spirit of love red
[47:23] blue the poof experian of fellowship
[47:25] just all those proof experience and when
[47:28] they begin to cognizant coming down they
[47:30] come down all the way from a gap all of
[47:32] the feel your love and don't a lust and
[47:34] on to the lowest this great forerunner
[47:36] has gone before us making a way he
[47:39] become from spirit the great fountains
[47:41] of the rainbow of God who had no
[47:43] beginning no no end
[47:44] he was forever God this ray of life went
[47:47] thought it was a ray of love that's the
[47:49] main one read the spiritual application
[47:52] of this super blood moon is that in the
[47:54] midst of the total blackout as the
[47:56] church is feeling to shine and as
[47:58] everything is literally feeling in the
[48:00] earth God's perfect love it's glowing
[48:02] shining true a bride indeed charity
[48:05] never feel it this speaks of the great
[48:07] victory in the love divine that is no
[48:10] taking place in the bride right when the
[48:11] love of many is Watson coal for he said
[48:14] from a little group of the true seed of
[48:16] the word God will present Christ a
[48:19] beloved bride of vision to his word and
[48:22] true them here we go and by them will be
[48:26] fulfill all that has been promised for
[48:28] his word in the Virgin who knows no man
[48:30] man creeps
[48:31] isn't that right god bless you but a
[48:33] Gabriel is so please go we appreciate
[48:35] that this morning blessed be the name
[48:38] of the Lord oh praise the Lord
[48:42] 11 this morning we tango to be here is
[48:45] always a blessing privilege to be here
[48:47] they gather around the word the word is
[48:50] God and the devil is still a liar
[48:53] every time he's open his mouth this wood
[48:55] could transform you this would have
[48:57] power and weight a scripture in prayer
[49:00] meeting on Tuesday about a man who died

[57:21] Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 this is a
[57:25] great scripture a beautiful scripture
[57:27] let this mind be in you which was also
[57:31] in Christ Jesus who been in the form of
[57:34] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[57:35] with God made himself of no reputation
[57:38] and took upon him the form of a servant
[57:41] it was me in the likeness of men and
[57:43] being found in fashion as a man
[57:46] he humbled himself and became obedient
[57:49] unto death even the death of the cross
[57:52] the wherefore God also had highly
[57:55] exalted him and given him a name which
[57:57] is above every name that at the name of
[57:59] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[58:01] heaven and things in earth and things
[58:04] under the earth and that every tongue
[58:06] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[58:09] to the glory of God the Father and he
[58:14] won't and wherefore my beloved as he
[58:16] have always obeyed not as in my presence
[58:18] only but now much more in my absence
[58:22] work out your own salvation with fear
[58:26] and trembling and one verse in Hebrews

[1:00:12] tonight for healing there we go
[1:00:14] Jesus has to take something to do
[1:00:18] something with the first thing else to

[1:00:54] that one person breakout is like a it
[1:00:57] just light up the audience you ever sit
[1:01:01] in the service I know one person give a
[1:01:03] good praise of God and then it says like

[1:01:09] broke into the supernatural the broken
[1:01:11] already mentioned all together get the
[1:01:13] break inside not any mention here this
[1:01:15] morning and the person makes you don't
[1:01:17] even know but you break in there cause a
[1:01:20] hole rupture inside of this place it
[1:01:23] takes one person to make a difference it
[1:01:25] takes one person to light up the place
[1:01:29] you could be that one person this
[1:01:31] morning
[1:01:32] the set your ordinary you are son of God
[1:01:35] you are daughter of God don't set yet
[1:01:37] like we don't know who you are we know

[1:01:42] know you are son we know you a daughter
[1:01:44] of God we know God perfect inside your
[1:01:46] soul let's continue I noticed last
[1:01:56] evening when the man that was blind was
[1:01:59] brought up to the platform and receive
[1:02:02] his sight that struck fire right away
[1:02:05] the Deaf woman that come while I was yet
[1:02:08] holding a hand and asking the IVA to
[1:02:09] leave her she began to quiver all over
[1:02:11] she said I can hear you I can hear you
[1:02:14] I'm quickly extract fire and by the time
[1:02:17] I was leaving the whole building seemed
[1:02:20] to be illuminated with God's presence so
[1:02:24] that is why you come not to just sit you
[1:02:26] come to participate you come to see when
[1:02:29] they log on to speak to you and respond
[1:02:32] because if you don't respond you're
[1:02:35] messy healing your mission deliverance
[1:02:37] your mister blessing your mr. Brett row
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:42] one time the Prophet was spoken to
[1:02:44] somebody and they take too long to
[1:02:45] respond he said that's best the healing
[1:02:48] they have to respond
[1:02:50] it's God talking to you or cast a vision
[1:02:54] if you think is a man here talking is
[1:02:57] God talking to you cast a fish and you
[1:02:59] know what a gift is I give this to get
[1:03:01] out of the way so if he said better or
[1:03:04] whatever gift you have a gift instead
[1:03:06] get out of the way if I get out of the
[1:03:09] way who's in the way yeah I'm a man just
[1:03:16] like you I born in sin shape me iniquity
[1:03:19] but a gift is to get out of the way
[1:03:22] and if the man behind the pulpit gets
[1:03:24] all to wait and who's speaking
[1:03:25] who's inspiring who is pump in the world
[1:03:29] who is shaking is out there who's trying
[1:03:31] to set your soul on fire it's not the
[1:03:34] man so if you're looking at the man you
[1:03:37] in the flesh you natural you can begin a
[1:03:41] fight with ye I gotta fight with this
[1:03:43] one you in the natural you have nothing
[1:03:46] to get because those in the flesh cannot
[1:03:48] please God it's only those with faith
[1:03:54] can please God

[1:04:46] I mean
[1:04:46] he takes something to do something with
[1:04:49] now in order for him to get something
[1:04:53] somebody has to surrender something and

[1:14:19] received Christ Christ in you I'm taking
[1:14:26] my time tonight
[1:14:27] don't think I'm worried and know taking
[1:14:31] my time next time I come into church I
[1:14:36] wanted to bring a notebook and pen we
[1:14:39] were started take some notes now many
[1:14:45] people say I will go to heaven because
[1:14:46] my faith tells me so I belong to church
[1:14:51] and my feet trust me that I'm all right
[1:14:53] now I will even agrees of God to but
[1:14:57] look no matter what your faith is you
[1:15:01] are not going to be judged by your feet
[1:15:04] you're going to be judged by your works
[1:15:11] so the confession I believe brother
[1:15:13] Branham there is a conversion of it then
[1:15:16] too far from the Apostles Creed I
[1:15:19] believe the Bible
[1:15:21] never said he'd ever believed and
[1:15:23] trembles too so you have too far from
[1:15:25] what he believes so it's not a matter of
[1:15:27] what a confession you believe is what
[1:15:30] your faith brought you into the activity
[1:15:33] of works the proof is really the fact
[1:15:36] because your faith is expressed by by
[1:15:39] your works so these are a poor consent
[1:15:47] this is an active living fate catch the
[1:15:53] vision because when Abraham taught is
[1:15:56] his hip make him step out from his
[1:15:59] country come out from among his people
[1:16:02] and walk among a new people seeking a
[1:16:06] city whose maker and builder is God
[1:16:10] that's what it does it brings you all to
[1:16:13] comfort zone and bring you all the
[1:16:16] butcher a custom wind it breaks that
[1:16:18] circle that has kept you bound for all
[1:16:21] these years because you see like Samson
[1:16:24] a possibility do you get it catch the
[1:16:33] vision Samson caught something yes he
[1:16:37] paid a price
[1:16:38] yes the fool by Delilah yes he was in
[1:16:40] sin yes he was in prison but when he
[1:16:43] caught the vision with our eyes did you
[1:16:48] hear that
[1:16:49] he had no eyes I see a vision and the
[1:16:54] vision he had make him say once more
[1:16:56] Lord I see a possibility I know the
[1:17:00] anointing I know that power to come back
[1:17:03] upon me I'm down in the dumps where I
[1:17:06] know because I tasted it before

[1:37:19] made and I've been accepted and you
[1:37:27] can't get the token on the reward fee
[1:37:29] until you pay the price that's the only
[1:37:31] way you could not pay the prices to pay
[1:37:32] that's right believe it accepted follow
[1:37:34] billions to the whole Word of God in
[1:37:37] times of you to the token for obedience
[1:37:40] you have to be a reason why it's a full
[1:37:44] because Abraham didn't fully obey God
[1:37:46] and until you fully obeyed God then God
[1:37:50] bless him because God called him and
[1:37:54] invited him to be blessed and he bring
[1:37:56] along his family with him and he family
[1:37:58] and IV nurse near to him like a fly in
[1:38:01] the ointment the Prophet Khalid okay
[1:38:03] pull along luck with him and when they
[1:38:05] bless him falling upon you as a son that
[1:38:08] is called it gonna fall around those who
[1:38:10] was I wrong you follow billions not the
[1:38:16] part of it as far as the denomination

[1:55:21] the city he was at the street level he

[1:55:26] fission broke up on Abraham shall I hide
[1:55:28] from Abraham what I'm about to do
[1:55:30] because the elect have a vision it has
[1:55:33] to have a bigger picture presented to
[1:55:35] you because of who you are the Lord you
[1:55:38] should show them that this is not for
[1:55:42] every everybody this is for the elect
[1:55:45] that's why the angel came to Abraham to
[1:55:48] speak to him what was supposed to happen
[1:55:51] things that are to be
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:57] Oh glory no fur this is what we talking
[1:56:02] about one skip this I reckon that the
[1:56:08] present suffering of this world it's not
[1:56:10] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:56:14] that shall be revealed in the sea you
[1:56:16] can't even compare it what God wants to
[1:56:19] bless you with question answers if the
[1:56:31] church is saved even though she does not
[1:56:34] go in the rapture
[1:56:35] I believe you're taught she must go to
[1:56:36] the tradition for purifying but what
[1:56:38] about these that are dead
[1:56:39] how would it be purified answer Nirvana
[1:56:42] the bride taught need no purification
[1:56:46] she's already purified and those that
[1:56:49] are dead back there they never received
[1:56:51] the light that these church has received
[1:56:53] they live under the justification
[1:56:55] sonification so far like that they live
[1:56:56] to the light of the age maybe in a way
[1:56:59] they suffered whatever they went through
[1:57:01] and the persecutions but now here we go
[1:57:04] in this rapture in time she's called in
[1:57:08] prophecy a time he's gonna rupture in
[1:57:11] time they will have to come a time now
[1:57:14] that this bride he meant Church that
[1:57:19] reject the head part of the bride will
[1:57:21] have to suffer for her rejection so he's
[1:57:24] talking about in this message the church
[1:57:27] people in this message that reject the
[1:57:29] head part which is a headstone and the
[1:57:32] thunders capped the pyramid so ratandas
[1:57:34] is the headstone that comes in two part
[1:57:36] revelation and manifestation they fight
[1:57:39] the revelation because it is the word
[1:57:40] but it will be coming a manifestation he
[1:57:43] said what we see should make a church
[1:57:44] not from it a revival that we will find
[1:57:47] them everywhere saying the seven promise
[1:57:49] is manifested that's bright promise
[1:57:52] [Applause]
[1:57:56] thus the Tumnus mean that my bedroom
[1:57:59] then the Tumnus is this perimeter is
[1:58:02] capped by the seven thunders then the

[2:04:45] rejected the atonement in his fullness
[2:04:48] she is a believer a professed believer
[2:04:52] but she will have to go to the
[2:04:54] tribulation period because she didn't
[2:04:56] accept the fullness of the world or did
[2:04:59] the Lord a shout
[2:05:00] we can't go halfway it makes no sense
[2:05:03] you have to go all the way or glory to

[2:09:47] we gotta be one on one accord or we
[2:09:50] never serve God as people unless mean

[2:09:54] principles of the Bible and the things
[2:09:57] that God has said that was right you
[2:09:58] must always stand by them I hope I never
[2:10:01] announced this morning back there that
[2:10:03] it kind of come to my mind that the
[2:10:05] people seemingly I get to know me from
[2:10:06] deliverance you don't hear much about
[2:10:08] that any message yet people going to
[2:10:09] church and getting more knowledge and
[2:10:11] information but their need for
[2:10:12] deliverance yes the liver and some your
[2:10:15] habits for the attitude from your wisdom
[2:10:17] different demons cast out you don't know
[2:10:20] what kind of spirits upon your life Oh
[2:10:22] glow and what spirits haunting you and
[2:10:24] following you
[2:10:25] well glory to God let's continue here
[2:10:27] this little spot now that the people see
[2:10:30] me again from deliverance it seems to be
[2:10:32] something like the people seen it so
[2:10:34] they just push it to one side or God can
[2:10:36] do it but I study attitude I don't know
[2:10:41] if butter on the answer victorious
[2:10:42] yesterday yesterday the dog says okay
[2:10:47] okay man
[2:10:48] but I want to salute them they walk they
[2:10:50] coming up the corner on Tuesday night

[2:10:57] our children without even my car
[2:10:59] to put the church during the week yes
[2:11:05] and Sunday it had looked like like like
[2:11:09] a child and the card bought a midweek
[2:11:11] service no we were taught in them
[2:11:12] I remember toting Isaac on my shoulder
[2:11:14] walking into Kai well whoa we feared God
[2:11:17] we love the Lord
[2:11:18] I remember me pregnant but Isaac without
[2:11:20] barely walking and walking and walking
[2:11:22] in not taxi to go in walking in was two
[2:11:25] and a half miles and then to go up a
[2:11:29] hill to preach this gospel
[2:11:31] hallelujah Dupree on that gas lamp with
[2:11:38] water from the well so but we know where
[2:11:42] we come from we know what we fought for
[2:11:50] and then them times had no cellphone no
[2:11:53] what's up
[2:11:54] no Facebook people caught up in all them
[2:12:03] things now Moses when he was caught by
[2:12:19] God he was a Twitter complete prophet
[2:12:20] I went God sends a man to do anything he
[2:12:22] completely creeps him with everything
[2:12:23] that he has needed and caught cause a
[2:12:26] man to be a preacher he puts something
[2:12:28] in him to preach with if he calling to
[2:12:30] be a teacher he puts something them to
[2:12:32] teach with if he calls a meme to be a
[2:12:34] prophet he puts something in him to see
[2:12:36] visions and to be a prophet God always
[2:12:38] completely eclipses man isn't that right
[2:12:41] praise God
[2:12:43] and if you are Christian God don't make
[2:12:46] half recursions God make complete
[2:12:49] Christians go to make are free preachers
[2:12:52] but preachers can be halfway and God
[2:12:56] meets his children Christians and
[2:12:57] sometime they are halfway Christians
[2:12:59] which that God's intention for them to
[2:13:01] be that way
[2:13:01] it's they're always got mixed up with
[2:13:06] the plan of God for their lives so
[2:13:10] there's a plan of God for your life and
[2:13:11] you have your plans and your plans has

[2:17:00] rapido on the prices there or glory to

[2:18:08] the way they are gonna want them to be
[2:18:11] halfway Christians or halfway preachers
[2:18:12] compromising on either side he wants
[2:18:15] them completely stand in the breach now
[2:18:16] Moses God made him a company profit for
[2:18:20] completely liberals and more they was
[2:18:21] completely surrendered into the hands of
[2:18:23] God and that's the reason he was what he
[2:18:26] was he was so completely God till God
[2:18:28] could trust him anyway I wonder this
[2:18:31] morning as Christians if we have yield
[2:18:33] our own will and yielded ourselves so
[2:18:37] completely to God till God can trust us
[2:18:40] the place yes put us I wonder this
[2:18:42] morning or myself if I could be so
[2:18:43] heated to God he's talking with himself
[2:18:45] if I could be so even to God your God
[2:18:48] could trust me could trust but I never
[2:18:50] could trust our trustee board our Deacon
[2:18:52] board all members of our church we all
[2:18:54] have a place and we got a duty
[2:18:57] the minister has got a place to stand
[2:18:59] and preach the unsearchable riches of
[2:19:00] Christ without compromising if he is
[2:19:02] called to be a preacher he wouldn't
[2:19:04] steal one thing for a person he was
[2:19:06] called to be a preacher and a member of
[2:19:07] the church if he's caught to be a member
[2:19:09] of this sitting group then he would not
[2:19:12] compromise if the Church believes we
[2:19:13] should not gamble
[2:19:14] then member should never touch a deck of
[2:19:16] cards we don't believe in drinking he
[2:19:18] should instead complete home drinking
[2:19:19] we don't believe in gambling or smoking
[2:19:21] and so on if we will complete the level
[2:19:23] of stress into his hands then go and
[2:19:25] live in us Christ hope of glory and when
[2:19:27] one member we're talking is another
[2:19:28] member you know that you're all you're
[2:19:30] commanded death to pray for one another
[2:19:34] not talk about one another now see
[2:19:36] somebody's thinking about this thinking
[2:19:38] this thinking no pick them up create for
[2:19:41] them not not not telling ministry with
[2:19:47] elimination the telling ministry to tell
[2:19:51] nobody don't tell nobody
[2:19:55] and afterwards ap health it they pay the
[2:19:59] price for not seeing not talking and
[2:20:01] you're just as guilty because you're an
[2:20:03] evil in the wrong things
[2:20:04] it will keep silent I'd have a knowledge
[2:20:06] of sinner or whatever kind think they
[2:20:08] enable in that person and what they're
[2:20:10] doing some time parents enable their
[2:20:12] children and do wrong things
[2:20:14] it is so sad some time parents actually
[2:20:16] unable to destroy their own children any
[2:20:21] blows please gone so when one member
[2:20:25] we're talking against another member you
[2:20:27] know that's wrong you command it to pray
[2:20:29] for one another not to talk against one
[2:20:30] other but alone one another if someone
[2:20:32] is don't let's pick him up help him now
[2:20:34] that makes us a unified group of
[2:20:35] believers when we don't obey that we
[2:20:37] don't obey God we displease God
[2:20:39] therefore our church or people kind of
[2:20:40] prosper I just kind of go on as a just
[2:20:43] unified together now what we don't want
[2:20:45] to have Richard wanna be a real church
[2:20:47] or no church at all want to be real
[2:20:49] Christians or no questions at all we
[2:20:52] won't talk deliverance from our habits
[2:20:53] from our sins for more evil thinking for
[2:20:57] more evil doing for more negligence
[2:20:59] whatever we have done we want total
[2:21:01] deliverance so when the people come into
[2:21:03] this church to be prayed for there will
[2:21:04] be this little group maybe not over 100
[2:21:06] sitting here
[2:21:07] completely hands of God and when we
[2:21:09] breathe God will hear from heaven and
[2:21:18] the only way we can do that is unified
[2:21:20] our hearts together with brotherly love
[2:21:21] or be the offices of the church and the
[2:21:23] pastor the pastor obey God then God
[2:21:25] works to the pastor to the board known
[2:21:27] to the church and they all together one
[2:21:29] unit to the kingdom of God Fira wanted

[2:24:47] Bible says let this mind be in Christ
[2:24:48] that was in you who taught it not
[2:24:50] robbery to be equal with God he took on
[2:24:54] human flesh humbled himself and became
[2:24:57] obedient to death so we're not talking
[2:25:01] much as our sacrifices he made a
[2:25:04] sacrifice he abandoned Evelyn came to it
[2:25:08] he draws glory and except a robber flesh
[2:25:13] he took our sin your sin and my sin went
[2:25:18] on the helmeted and health and lawless
[2:25:20] character he had two bombs back up all
[2:25:23] flawed sin rose victorious and releases
[2:25:26] superlice that we can tap into it
[2:25:29] no wonder is a prophecy of a super
[2:25:31] church a super race because his life was
[2:25:34] a super life

[2:25:53] they're going through but God know what
[2:25:55] you're going through and he could
[2:25:56] strengthen you and the inner man he
[2:25:58] could shrink me in your soul he could
[2:26:01] strike you when they asked you about the
[2:26:06] kingdom he says not to you to know what
[2:26:08] with the kingdom I'm so like that he

[2:45:09] put on the doorpost the families was
[2:45:12] brought under the blood and everything
[2:45:13] was delivered when they were completely

[2:45:55] or the devil know that you're off and
[2:46:00] you know you're off it's not corrected
[2:46:02] yet until it comes under the blood then

[2:46:43] Holy Ghost and when you when you're just
[2:46:45] a church member shook the pastor's hands
[2:46:47] sometimes I'll experience of jumping

[2:46:50] have malice in your heart
[2:46:51] strange acts telling lies smoking
[2:46:53] cigarette lusting after woman there's

[2:50:48] from mother from his kindred what
[2:50:50] separated him not because it was a good
[2:50:52] man but because he believed what God was
[2:50:54] able to keep his promise he had give him
[2:50:56] oh my oh my
[2:50:59] let's go let's continue all these
[2:51:02] believers we could go on for always were
[2:51:04] like a bunch of change out of God's
[2:51:06] pockets in good hands you pull out a
[2:51:12] bunch of change their pennies nickels
[2:51:15] dimes quarters half dollars and dollars
[2:51:19] all in coins that is what the world is
[2:51:21] in God's hands there are some people
[2:51:24] just can't have a Penny's worth of it
[2:51:25] and go I can only use them in a penny
[2:51:28] way that's all they can buy are you
[2:51:32] ready don't reject them if they can't
[2:51:36] believe the real truth don't turn them
[2:51:39] down
[2:51:39] don't kick them out and see they're not
[2:51:42] in it because God uses and he's
[2:51:45] sometimes luck was a penny Abraham was a
[2:51:49] silver dollar so take a hundred lots to
[2:51:53] make a Abraham a hundred carnal
[2:51:56] believers will never stand in the
[2:51:58] presence of a genuine Christian that is
[2:52:01] separated from the currencies of the
[2:52:03] world living in Christ where the wood
[2:52:05] can flow to him he can only think a
[2:52:08] Penny's worth and that's all he's got
[2:52:09] you see people can say I do believe in
[2:52:11] healing how do I believe in these things
[2:52:12] that's noise a penny just a Penny's
[2:52:15] worth and that's all he can buy don't
[2:52:16] stop him just let him alone oh well if
[2:52:21] they were say he's a copper he can never
[2:52:22] be a silver so just let go of him God
[2:52:25] can use him I'd rather see him dong in
[2:52:27] church than the seaman a bear who
[2:52:28] standing in the corn
[2:52:29] just leave him alone go I can use it
[2:52:32] anyhow maybe not very much but you use
[2:52:35] him if he can use him
[2:52:36] Joseph was separated from his brethren
[2:52:39] without the coins what was the matter
[2:52:41] with them he was not willing to be
[2:52:43] separated it was his will it wasn't his
[2:52:45] will to separate but they separate
[2:52:47] themselves on him from his bright shiny
[2:52:49] dollar that penny would couldn't stand
[2:52:51] it it was jealousy they didn't want to
[2:52:55] break down because the quality and them
[2:52:57] were not the quality that was in him and
[2:52:59] because of it they were jealous because
[2:53:01] they were pennies and he was a dollar
[2:53:03] it's a total separation we are not to go
[2:53:07] into the world no more or engine do with
[2:53:09] the world but cleave only unto God Jesus
[2:53:12] coming after a bride listen who is
[2:53:14] coming after I want you to take this
[2:53:16] strong in your heart
[2:53:18] listen hooch is coming for he's coming

[2:53:31] believin she's separated from the cares

[2:54:27] the Lord God Almighty so close to this
