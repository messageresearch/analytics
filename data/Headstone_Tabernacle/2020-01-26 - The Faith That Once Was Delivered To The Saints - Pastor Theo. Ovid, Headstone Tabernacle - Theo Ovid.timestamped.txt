[1:10:56] okay so church-going people just know
[1:11:01] Jesus died for the sins right there safe
[1:11:03] but you will not judge when you are
[1:11:06] revelation believe in people you know
[1:11:09] Jesus did a little more than that here
[1:11:11] just died to save him his sins he died
[1:11:14] to get this book this book is the Buddha
[1:11:17] animal lost because God can't let a
[1:11:19] sinful man have that book so when Adam
[1:11:22] fell he lost the authority he released
[1:11:24] the rezonings that was supposed to be in
[1:11:25] him he was supposed to represent and
[1:11:27] bring sons like himself and sons like
[1:11:30] Adam was like sons of God which is men
[1:11:33] with dominion over the creeping things
[1:11:35] over what creep upon the earth men that
[1:11:37] was dominating that was in charge that
[1:11:40] was rulers over the situation that's the
[1:11:43] kind of man that God made in the
[1:11:44] beginning God wanted a dominant powerful
[1:11:47] man to govern the nature
[1:11:49] cover the earth that is what God wanted
[1:11:51] reflect that he is powerful but he
[1:11:53] conquers everything that rules
[1:11:55] everything he wanted a man in His image
[1:11:57] and his likeness having his intent
[1:12:01] having his the bus having his mind
[1:12:04] having his will that's the kind of man
[1:12:06] that God wanted and he's gonna have that
[1:12:08] kind of man
[1:12:09] Oh glory to God the Meseta again he
[1:12:11] gonna have that kind of a man
[1:12:13] Oh glory to God no you have your will
[1:12:15] and you have your choice because what I
[1:12:17] put robots on the earth and that's the
[1:12:19] core them in and said press play and you

[1:17:15] what you want you get in the phone book
[1:17:17] and I'm had the book and see if I was in
[1:17:20] trouble
[1:17:21] certainly you couldn't mess with Adam
[1:17:25] maybe sees anomalous prey animal spirit
[1:17:27] - and the gadna even then God said there
[1:17:30] was no man to till the soil picked us
[1:17:32] and blew you up and then that spirit man
[1:17:35] step into this dustman and I'm living on
[1:17:38] he's had a work until this soil
[1:17:41] he already of the world and when go
[1:17:43] check him out you ready for wife
[1:17:45] ya know work ya know would and you
[1:17:50] wonder wife
[1:17:55] I know wife SW in overseas work so when
[1:18:05] God Adam was ready he put Adam to sleep
[1:18:07] pull Eve out when Adam come out of a
[1:18:11] sleep discernment is there today is
[1:18:15] there who is that standing in front of
[1:18:16] him he's a flesh of my flesh he sa what
[1:18:19] denomination belonged in a lady went to

[1:18:32] forget the different kind of gender they
[1:18:35] want to kind of carry with me but this
[1:18:37] is a man this is woman and that's how we
[1:18:40] come here because man fell come not your
[1:18:42] sex and that's what we born here so
[1:18:43] Jesus come to the first gospel say I
[1:18:45] must be born again something I have
[1:18:47] money inside to reconnect you with the
[1:18:50] original bit of how you were supposed to
[1:18:53] be which is wood and spirit so that's
[1:18:56] why you come to church they got the wood
[1:18:57] and spirit to bring it back to the
[1:18:59] original bullet you built so the
[1:19:03] cinnamon which doctors and witchcraft
[1:19:05] people looking at least as you're from
[1:19:06] Pisces and if I'm Aries and what not and
[1:19:08] they wanted all this see me be me and
[1:19:10] all these stars story business but when
[1:19:12] you get new bit you're lost you not
[1:19:15] connected to those stars you connected
[1:19:17] to seven stars a different kind of stuff
[1:19:19] a different constellation altogether so
[1:19:21] in ours when you get the new birth that
[1:19:23] ever can find you in the stars you'll
[1:19:26] not be regular folks
[1:19:27] Oklahoma decor you belong to a different
[1:19:30] category altogether or glory to God you
[1:19:33] belong to the morning stars
[1:19:34] Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:19:37] thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah you
[1:19:41] belong to them angelic beings that
[1:19:43] rotated off of court that was not
[1:19:45] deceived you pick up that spirit
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] that's a big one that's a big one
[1:19:56] you belong to the angelic beings that
[1:19:58] rotated off of God that was not deceived
[1:20:01] you pick a bad spirit upon the earth
[1:20:04] that is why the parameter prophesied
[1:20:06] this pride will be invincible that mushy
[1:20:09] cannibal
[1:20:13] when she get to know who she is that she
[1:20:18] can do not just who she is but that she
[1:20:21] can do the greater works super Church
[1:20:25] super race I seen the other headstone
[1:20:28] they had Sun coming down with the power
[1:20:30] of love or going up or to anoint the
[1:20:33] Fate that's inside of you or glory to
[1:20:37] God the power of love but not the feet
[1:20:41] that's inside of you you may be seated
[1:20:49] listen to this the lump in the time of
[1:20:54] intercessory back tear know when Jesus
[1:20:57] died he had to intercede for the names
[1:21:00] that are coming listeners he knew that
[1:21:03] there were names in dere that was put
[1:21:06] India from the foundation of the world
[1:21:08] and as long as them names was never been
[1:21:11] manifested early it
[1:21:13] he had the Steve here as intercessor so
[1:21:19] all the time the lamb is written
[1:21:22] interceding they comin they comin the
[1:21:28] common Paul is the common Irena's age
[1:21:31] they comin martin age the common Columba
[1:21:35] little Wesley
[1:21:36] they comin he knew you were coming
[1:21:41] [Applause]
[1:21:44] the book was close to his chest
[1:21:46] the book is sealed romantic touch the
[1:21:49] book but their names in the book some in
[1:21:54] fornication some in adultery summoned I
[1:21:56] can summon all kind of thing but yet to
[1:21:58] find them I'm only the spirit could find
[1:22:03] them
[1:22:04] so therefore when Jesus died the spirit
[1:22:07] was loosed to find the seeds and when
[1:22:12] the seventy was brought the spirit was
[1:22:14] new seven spirits was used to go toward
[1:22:16] all the earth to find you so it's not

[2:24:29] thing inside of you that could keep you
[2:24:31] from a temp and anger and seen the wrong
[2:24:33] thing and have any wrong attitude the
[2:24:35] woman who had a daughter of X whatever

[2:24:45] the right spot where you'll be careful
[2:24:47] with your words you wouldn't lose what
[2:24:49] come to your mind I'm just seeing
[2:24:51] anything because you are Trinidadian but
[2:24:54] you would speak because you're Christian
[2:24:58] Shiina Dagon is a spiritual source

[2:25:31] watching me time only time right all
[2:25:35] right God wanted to please his church
[2:25:39] and his church something daughters of
[2:25:41] God God let me lift the see it is my
[2:25:43] prayer so close till I can just feel it
[2:25:46] in my hands almost look like it's right
[2:25:48] here that's what I've longed to see
[2:25:49] waiting for the time when we walked on
[2:25:51] the street girl is a crippled lame from
[2:25:53] his mother's womb silver and gold have I
[2:25:55] none waiting for the manifestation sons
[2:25:58] of God when God will make himself known
[2:25:59] when God will make himself known what
[2:26:04] will that be that will be the unfeeling
[2:26:06] of God and you cannot unveil what you
[2:26:09] have not filled so if God is veiled in
[2:26:12] you and I then that has to be unveiled
[2:26:15] and that's why we ready to test in John
[2:26:17] 14:12 he said he that believed in me the
[2:26:19] same works that I do shall he do also
[2:26:25] why because the same God is filled in
[2:26:28] you so what the unveiling of that God is
[2:26:31] God making himself known listen
[2:26:33] carefully by manifestation not by
[2:26:36] revelation not by teachings that is all
[2:26:39] good as part of God's plan but by
[2:26:42] manifestation this is what you have to
[2:26:45] look for when God will step out the
[2:26:48] pages and fulfill his word between
[2:26:50] Malachi and Matthew there was a space of
[2:26:54] time there was no profit there was no
[2:26:56] manifestation of God but the prophecy
[2:26:58] was one comment to manifest Christ God
[2:27:02] is not right so when John the Baptist
[2:27:03] came he was the same that Messiah is
[2:27:05] near God always bring us into
[2:27:08] duction when time it has him he don't
[2:27:11] just drop it on you he come to give a
[2:27:13] word the time for your deliverance is at
[2:27:16] hand and God give his son in the hole
[2:27:18] and the leader with joy because you know
[2:27:21] your britches at hand
[2:27:22] yeah the devil talked here last night
[2:27:23] and last week but you know when you get
[2:27:25] a word from the Lord

[2:29:57] bosses were each of their carcass before
[2:30:00] they even died
[2:30:01] cancer is a to teak to what's coming and
[2:30:04] cancers already dread but he says a to
[2:30:08] take that what's coming but that
[2:30:09] horrible thing was forbidden in that day
[2:30:11] the touch those that had the seed of God
[2:30:13] that is what we are striving for now to
[2:30:17] get in and be positionally please into
[2:30:19] the kingdom of God before these horrible
[2:30:22] plague strike are you striving friends
[2:30:24] to get into the kingdom and the Bible
[2:30:28] said the kingdom is preached and Men
[2:30:29] come on and say it out say it again men
[2:30:33] press your way into it what you present
[2:30:35] to a church and to the kingdom let's
[2:30:39] continue I will keep you long but
[2:30:41] Galatians 5:1 a success stand fast
[2:30:42] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[2:30:45] Christ hath made us free and be not
[2:30:49] entangled again with the yoke of bondage
[2:30:52] behold I Paul say unto you that if he be
[2:30:56] circumcised Christ shall profit you
[2:30:57] nothing for I testify again to every man
[2:31:00] that is circumcised that he's a debtor
[2:31:02] to do the whole law of God Christ is
[2:31:05] become of no effect unto you whosoever
[2:31:07] of you are justified by the law your
[2:31:10] fallen from grace so he was bossing them
[2:31:12] who own this legalistic thing
[2:31:14] of the law then he says but for we
[2:31:17] through the spirit wait for the hope of
[2:31:22] righteousness by feet for in Jesus
[2:31:26] Christ neither circumcision availeth
[2:31:29] anything nor uncircumcision are you
[2:31:33] ready
[2:31:33] but faith which book at my love's so
[2:31:39] what am I talking about d faith is not a
[2:31:41] faith by itself this quality of faith we
[2:31:45] talking about now is a faith that works
[2:31:49] by love so that brings the feet in a
[2:31:52] different category you've got a fear to
[2:31:58] move mountains and don't have this
[2:32:03] they've got no oil mysteries and don't
[2:32:06] have this love you could give your body
[2:32:08] to be burned you can give your things it
[2:32:10] goes to the poor but still don't have
[2:32:12] this thing in you have to have this
[2:32:14] thing we're talking about God want this
[2:32:17] love to come upon your feet or glory to
[2:32:20] God and I say again God want the love
[2:32:22] that come upon the faith hallelujah
[2:32:26] Malachi 4 came to turn our hearts back
[2:32:29] to the faith of the fathers God wants a
[2:32:31] faith that books my love he rebuked the
[2:32:34] seasons just not for words but for
[2:32:36] falling from the first love you have to
[2:32:38] get back to the first love to have the
[2:32:40] correct fit that God wants till the Lord
[2:32:43] our show could we go a little deeper and
[2:32:45] faith and love is relation because you
[2:32:48] can't have fit unless you got love Oh
[2:32:50] glory to God give the Lord a show
[2:32:53] Alleluia is a big one but earth-friendly
[2:32:55] it and love is relation because it can't
[2:32:58] have failed unless I got love because
[2:33:00] your feet isn't God who's the very
[2:33:02] essence of love faith and love who works
[2:33:06] together or glory to God
[2:33:08] so when byron went to India and he saw
[2:33:11] the man blame for worshipping the Sun
[2:33:13] plus he was barefoot it the first thing
[2:33:16] you do was to take off his shoes to see
[2:33:19] if his shoes / cornerman feet

[2:33:24] barefooted is it's just terrible so he

[3:11:49] say I don't care about this world I'm
[3:11:51] ready to go go to a different place a
[3:11:54] place where there's no more crying no
[3:11:56] more sighing no more bills and it's not
[3:11:58] because you want to escape from these
[3:12:00] things but it's because there's
