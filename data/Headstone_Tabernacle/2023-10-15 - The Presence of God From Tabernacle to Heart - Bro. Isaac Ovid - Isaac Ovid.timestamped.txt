[1:03:26] move so I'd like to greet one and all in
[1:03:29] the precious name of Jesus Christ and if
[1:03:31] you have your Bibles this morning would
[1:03:33] you turn with me to two
[1:03:36] portions of scripture this morning
[1:03:38] reading from Isaiah 6 I'm reading from
[1:03:43] Acts chapter 2 two familiar
[1:03:47] scriptures to
[1:03:49] connect small thought today for
[1:03:53] us by the grace of
[1:03:56] God reading from
[1:03:58] Isaiah 6 and reading from verse
[1:04:03] one in the year that King Uzziah
[1:04:07] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:04:10] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:04:13] filled the
[1:04:15] temple above it stood the seraphim each
[1:04:18] one had six wings with Twain he covered
[1:04:20] his face and with Twain he covered his
[1:04:23] feet and with Twain he did fly and one
[1:04:26] Cried unto another and said holy holy
[1:04:28] holy is the Lord God of hosts and the
[1:04:32] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[1:04:35] post of the door moved at the voice of
[1:04:38] him that cried and the house was full of
[1:04:41] smoke then said I woe is me for I am
[1:04:44] undone because I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:04:47] and I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:04:49] unclean lips for my eyes have seen the
[1:04:52] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[1:04:55] the seraphim unto me having a live coal
[1:04:57] in his hand which he had taken from the
[1:04:59] tongues from off the Altar and he laid
[1:05:02] it upon my mouth and said Lo this had
[1:05:04] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[1:05:06] taken away and thy sin purged also I
[1:05:09] heard the voice of the Lord saying whom
[1:05:11] shall I send and who will go for us then
[1:05:14] said I he am I send
[1:05:18] me and reading Acts chapter 2 and
[1:05:21] reading verse
[1:05:22] 1 and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:05:25] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:05:28] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:05:31] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[1:05:33] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:05:36] they were sitting and they appeared unto
[1:05:38] them clothing tongues like as a fire and
[1:05:41] it sat upon each of them and they were
[1:05:44] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[1:05:47] to speak with other tongues as the
[1:05:49] spirit gave them utterance may the Lord
[1:05:51] add a blessing to the reading of his his
[1:05:54] word you may be seated in the presence
[1:05:56] of the Lord this
[1:05:58] morning amen it's certainly a great
[1:06:00] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[1:06:02] and we are so thankful for what God has
[1:06:05] done is doing and is about to do and we
[1:06:07] are so grateful for his grace for his
[1:06:09] love for his Mercy to be in the land of
[1:06:12] the living and to be able to participate
[1:06:14] in this move of God in this season that
[1:06:18] many long to have been here the prophet
[1:06:20] wanted to be here when you read through
[1:06:22] the scriptures to know that this is the
[1:06:24] greatest age the greatest time that you
[1:06:26] could ever live in this is the time that
[1:06:29] God had to reserve a special group of
[1:06:31] people to be in this age because not
[1:06:32] everybody was qualified to be here so
[1:06:35] even though you may not be qualified as
[1:06:37] brother Raymond Thompson said you have
[1:06:38] been chosen to be here in this move and
[1:06:41] it's a difficult time it's a rough time
[1:06:43] brother the Bram called it a rough time
[1:06:45] for the unbeliever but a great time for
[1:06:48] the believer so when men's hearts are
[1:06:51] feeling for fear and there are Wars and
[1:06:53] there are rumors of War Wars and there's
[1:06:54] pestilence and there's stress and
[1:06:56] there's strains and there's struggles
[1:06:58] going on God is getting a bride ready
[1:07:00] not man getting a bride ready but God is
[1:07:03] getting a bride ready his way he is the
[1:07:05] one doing the fixing he is the one doing
[1:07:08] the moving he's the one doing the
[1:07:09] shifting and the prophet taught us that
[1:07:11] the angel of the Lord is on the earth
[1:07:13] now fixing things around for the coming
[1:07:15] of the Lord while you sleeping he's
[1:07:18] fixing when you're in your job he is
[1:07:20] fixing he doesn't need to be reminded of
[1:07:22] his responsibility the angel of the Lord
[1:07:25] is on the earth now the prophet said
[1:07:27] fixing things in order for the coming of
[1:07:30] the Lord he doesn't need an alarm clock
[1:07:31] to know what he's supposed to do he is
[1:07:33] doing what he is supposed to do and as
[1:07:36] Sons and Daughters of God we have to
[1:07:38] know what we're supposed to do and do
[1:07:40] what we're supposed to do it's that
[1:07:42] simple can the church say amen God is a
[1:07:45] god of order he's a god of systems he's
[1:07:48] a god of putting things in place that
[1:07:50] there's no room for things to fall apart
[1:07:52] can the Church Say Amen
[1:07:54] from the very beginning with god he's a
[1:07:57] god of order there's no Department of I
[1:07:59] heard somebody say recently there's no
[1:08:01] Department of angels that get up to make
[1:08:03] sure the sun is moving God made the sun
[1:08:05] to move a certain way can the church say
[1:08:08] amen he doesn't have to wake up somebody
[1:08:10] say going move the Sun and no no no no
[1:08:11] no no no no no the sun moves because
[1:08:13] it's part of a system it's it's part of
[1:08:15] a solar system the the Earth moves as
[1:08:17] part of a system There's No Angel
[1:08:20] responsible for gravity when you throw a
[1:08:22] ball up he hits it down no God put a
[1:08:24] system it's a law that's there this law
[1:08:27] called gravity means whatever goes down
[1:08:29] is supposed to come up but there are
[1:08:31] ways to defy the laws because butam
[1:08:33] taught us whenever you lift your hands
[1:08:35] in the sanctuary you defy the laws of
[1:08:38] gravity and you could only do that
[1:08:40] because you are a creature that comes
[1:08:41] from time so you can defy the laws of
[1:08:43] time and oh you don't hear me this
[1:08:45] morning when Jesus came he defied every
[1:08:48] natural law because he came from a place
[1:08:50] that was not governed by the natural law
[1:08:52] can the church came and that's why he
[1:08:54] could take Five Loaves and two fishes
[1:08:56] and he could feed 5,000 that is not a
[1:08:59] natural law he broke the natural law and
[1:09:01] he multiplied and when God's Prophet was
[1:09:03] on the earth he did what Jesus didn't
[1:09:05] even do because Jesus Took Loaves and
[1:09:07] fish and multiplied but that little
[1:09:09] Prophet where there was no squirrel he
[1:09:11] said let there be a squirrel showing
[1:09:13] that a restored sun was on the
[1:09:16] earth as a type to us that we are
[1:09:18] walking into that restoration that he's
[1:09:20] a wave sheath the first of many to come
[1:09:23] meaning he is not just the only one but
[1:09:25] there would be more who would step up to
[1:09:27] the plate and take their position as
[1:09:29] sons of God Daughters of God despite the
[1:09:32] opposition despite what the enemy does
[1:09:35] despite the resistance despite the
[1:09:37] rejection despite what takes place on
[1:09:39] your job in your family it's down to an
[1:09:42] individual Affair of God speaking to
[1:09:44] individuals and calling them out and
[1:09:47] you've got to know that that law that
[1:09:49] work it inside of you is a law of the
[1:09:51] seed that must bring forth after it it's
[1:09:54] kind that seed cannot bring forth
[1:09:56] anything else but what it's programmed
[1:09:58] to do oh you don't hear me this
[1:10:01] morning even your natural body you're
[1:10:04] not actively thinking right now of how
[1:10:06] to breathe Hallelujah because if you
[1:10:08] have to think about it but Steven one
[1:10:10] day you might forget about it if you're
[1:10:12] doing something important you're not
[1:10:13] reminding breathe breathe breathe no
[1:10:15] your body has a system that takes care
[1:10:18] of breathing your body have a system
[1:10:20] that takes care of digestion there's a
[1:10:22] solar system there's an economic system
[1:10:25] there's a political system there's a
[1:10:27] financial system these are all systems
[1:10:30] systems of God and manmade systems uh
[1:10:33] trying to put things in place uh to
[1:10:35] distract God's elect from seeing what
[1:10:37] God is doing that's why the Bible said
[1:10:40] when it looks a certain way look up for
[1:10:43] your Redemption draw it n don't look to
[1:10:45] the left don't look to the right don't
[1:10:48] look down but look up because only God
[1:10:51] is coming from above only he is high
[1:10:53] high and lifted up and I saw the Lord
[1:10:56] high and lifted up his train fill the
[1:11:02] temple can the church say Amen so we are
[1:11:05] so happy to be called we are so happy to
[1:11:08] be chosen we are so happy to be
[1:11:10] identified not just with a prophet but
[1:11:13] the whole Plan of Redemption because the
[1:11:15] prophet was a player in the great Plan
[1:11:18] of Redemption so you are not just a
[1:11:20] message believer or a church goer you
[1:11:23] are called unto Redemption you are the
[1:11:26] called unto adoption but without this
[1:11:29] Prophet there'll be no way for there to
[1:11:31] be complete Redemption without this
[1:11:34] Prophet there would be no way for there
[1:11:35] to be complete oh come on now somebody
[1:11:38] preach back to
[1:11:43] me so we are so happy to be in the house
[1:11:45] of God and but over called me yesterday
[1:11:48] speaking about a wonderful time in
[1:11:50] India he had to preach four messages
[1:11:56] Mikey I'm young and I felt tired for him
[1:11:58] I said cannot be human strength and
[1:12:01] after he preached twice he told me I'm
[1:12:02] feeling
[1:12:03] good you see my voice feeling strong and
[1:12:07] that can be human strength Hallelujah
[1:12:10] like Caleb I'm just as strong as when I
[1:12:13] first started out been in a battle for a
[1:12:15] long time but the devil can't take my
[1:12:17] joy he can't take my worship Hallelujah
[1:12:21] if I lose my teeth I'll gum the devil
[1:12:25] can the church say
[1:12:26] Amen so he's about 10 and 1 half hours
[1:12:29] ahead of us and so we thank God for the
[1:12:32] Victory and the testimony and how many
[1:12:34] were blessed with the service last
[1:12:36] Sunday with brother yadel Thornell and
[1:12:39] yadel Tabernacle being here what a
[1:12:40] blessing what an encouragement and he
[1:12:43] called me during the week and it was
[1:12:45] such a wonderful anointing and an
[1:12:47] atmosphere and a presence and and God is
[1:12:49] doing things God is moving things around
[1:12:53] if it's up to man man wouldn't do what
[1:12:55] God wants to do you know but when God
[1:12:56] starts to do it it's undeniable when God
[1:12:58] is doing it and you have to trust that
[1:13:00] God will do things in your life he said
[1:13:02] all things work together for good it's
[1:13:04] not you doing it but it's he shifting
[1:13:07] things around and God had his his own
[1:13:09] timing he has his time he wants to bless
[1:13:12] you he has his time to deliver you he
[1:13:14] has his time when he stops you from
[1:13:16] doing certain things because he knows
[1:13:18] the trouble you're going to get into if
[1:13:19] you go down a certain road but when God
[1:13:21] is ready to bless you forget about it
[1:13:25] David said my cup run it over he laid
[1:13:29] out a table for me in the presence of my
[1:13:31] enemy I couldn't even stop him from
[1:13:33] laying out the table he laid out the
[1:13:35] table for me in the presence of my
[1:13:39] enemies that's what God does when he
[1:13:42] wants to do it and I'm telling you bride
[1:13:44] of Jesus Christ God one day will pull
[1:13:46] you aside and give you something the
[1:13:49] world know nothing about and it will
[1:13:51] speak for itself you won't have to tell
[1:13:53] tell nobody about it but they will take
[1:13:55] note that youve been with Jesus you
[1:13:57] could be 12 years old 20 years old or
[1:14:00] 100 years old it's undeniable when you
[1:14:03] have been with the
[1:14:07] Lord notice I didn't say been to church
[1:14:10] I said been with the Lord because it's
[1:14:12] impossible for you to be with the Lord
[1:14:14] and walk out the same way you came can
[1:14:16] the church say Amen oh I'm so glad he
[1:14:19] set me free are you glad he set you
[1:14:22] free
[1:14:24] are you under expectation to be
[1:14:26] transformed are you under expectation to
[1:14:29] be changed are you looking forward for
[1:14:31] the gray hair to go back black are you
[1:14:34] looking forward for the heart of the the
[1:14:37] surgeon to go in your heart and pull out
[1:14:38] the Stony
[1:14:40] heart and put his spirit inside it yeah
[1:14:43] listen you can't do it or no but he
[1:14:44] could do it are you ready to give him
[1:14:46] permission to operate this morning to
[1:14:50] take his Tony heart out and put his
[1:14:52] Spirit then he he said I'll put my
[1:14:54] spirit in
[1:14:57] there are you willing to take part of
[1:15:00] the operation because that's what we
[1:15:02] came a church for to not leave the same
[1:15:04] way that we came to not leave with the
[1:15:06] same problems or at the very least leave
[1:15:09] with the same perspective of the problem
[1:15:11] because there are some problems God
[1:15:13] allows you to keep you
[1:15:14] know for you to change your perspective
[1:15:17] about the problem because if you don't
[1:15:19] have certain problems God can't keep you
[1:15:21] humble oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:15:23] morning this is not the kind of
[1:15:25] preaching we like but God leaves us with
[1:15:27] TS in our flesh to keep us humble for us
[1:15:30] to know that it's him doing the work and
[1:15:32] it's not you doing the work and it's not
[1:15:33] your Holiness and it's not your grace
[1:15:36] and it's not your power but it's his
[1:15:38] grace it's his power it's his ability
[1:15:40] it's his Mercy it's his love it's he
[1:15:43] keeping you you can't keep yourself so
[1:15:45] we always allow something to stay in
[1:15:47] your life so he can say it's me carrying
[1:15:50] you through the fire some through the
[1:15:52] water come through the flood oh come on
[1:15:54] some through great trials but all come
[1:15:57] through the blood that's the gospel
[1:15:59] without an agenda that's the great
[1:16:02] Gospel of Jesus
[1:16:04] Christ he came to change he came to
[1:16:07] deliver he came to set you free not just
[1:16:10] free physically but free in your mind
[1:16:12] free in your soul free about who you are
[1:16:15] free about yourself free about your
[1:16:17] purpose in God not your purpose you
[1:16:19] think you have but your purpose in God
[1:16:25] you may be seated that's why the Bible
[1:16:27] says all things work together for good
[1:16:29] to them who are the called according
[1:16:32] to his purpose you want to do your own
[1:16:35] purpose and expect things to work out
[1:16:37] but God has his purpose so we come to
[1:16:40] church to find out Lord what is your
[1:16:42] purpose for my
[1:16:44] life simple but important because God is
[1:16:48] a god of order he's a god of systems
[1:16:50] he's a god of process he's a god of
[1:16:52] procedure he say all that the father has
[1:16:54] given me must come and every son that
[1:16:57] come has to be
[1:16:58] chasen every son that come has to be
[1:17:01] chastised every son that come has to be
[1:17:03] corrected he corrected Moses he
[1:17:06] corrected Elijah he corrected the
[1:17:07] prophet even Jesus had to learn
[1:17:10] obedience by the things that
[1:17:12] he so what are we complaining
[1:17:16] about he didn't say well because it's
[1:17:18] Jesus I'll give him a past I my only son
[1:17:20] no Jesus had to learn obedience
[1:17:24] so obedience wasn't a natural thing to
[1:17:26] Jesus he had to learn
[1:17:33] it you ever thought about what Jesus had
[1:17:35] to suffer to learn
[1:17:40] obedience Hallelujah but for God to say
[1:17:43] this is my beloved Son he had to pass
[1:17:45] the exam because not God given that kind
[1:17:48] of power to if you
[1:17:51] be it's only the ones who could obey
[1:17:53] that's we say full obedience come on you
[1:17:56] know the word now full obedience what
[1:17:58] entitles you to the Token because when
[1:18:01] you fully obey God God is obligated to
[1:18:04] give you it's a channel open up to you
[1:18:07] you obey the Lord in everything you obey
[1:18:10] his Commandments and watch God bless you
[1:18:12] can the church say
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:19] Amen so just Tes any
[1:18:21] temperature Hallelujah just seeing who
[1:18:24] in church this
[1:18:25] morning to see who come to hear from the
[1:18:28] Lord or is just a
[1:18:31] social fulfilling an expectation to be
[1:18:33] in church or it's more than that so I
[1:18:35] have a title this
[1:18:38] morning the presence of
[1:18:40] God from Tabernacle to
[1:18:45] Heart the presence of God from
[1:18:50] Tabernacle to Heart
[1:18:53] it's been a burden on my heart for some
[1:18:55] time and it's so
[1:18:58] interesting but over had been on this
[1:19:01] thought in different ways on in his
[1:19:04] presence you know
[1:19:06] and there was this book on his desk and
[1:19:09] some of you don't even know how things
[1:19:10] have to connect together and for a while
[1:19:11] this book there and then but the yadel
[1:19:13] came in last week when he saw the book
[1:19:14] he said but that book boy there's
[1:19:16] something but in his presence and then
[1:19:19] this week he called me say that in his
[1:19:21] presence and and I said but something
[1:19:22] speaking to me about a few weeks now but
[1:19:24] in his
[1:19:28] presence how much God loves for you to
[1:19:31] be in his presence and what happens to
[1:19:34] you when you're in his presence and the
[1:19:36] change that you go through in his
[1:19:37] presence can the church say
[1:19:40] amen and how God wanted to move his
[1:19:45] presence because his present justness
[1:19:47] operate in any kind of a way can the
[1:19:49] church say
[1:19:51] amen God exist existed alone we know the
[1:19:53] scripture bear with me this morning
[1:19:56] self-existent one eloh there was nobody
[1:19:59] to worship him so he created the angels
[1:20:02] to worship and that made him God because
[1:20:05] God by definition is the object of
[1:20:07] worship so because the Angels worship
[1:20:09] him now he is God but God longed for
[1:20:12] communion he longed for Fellowship he
[1:20:15] longed for the ability to be a father to
[1:20:17] be a Healer to be a way maker to be a
[1:20:19] restorer to be a deliverer to be a
[1:20:21] comfort to be a in the midst of the
[1:20:23] storm to be all of this but there was
[1:20:25] nobody to
[1:20:27] deliver can the church say amen and I
[1:20:29] want to share to you how powerful is
[1:20:31] thing with Redemption do you know that
[1:20:33] the Angels who fell from heaven can be
[1:20:36] redeemed there's no provision for the
[1:20:38] angels to be restored you
[1:20:41] know because the penalty of sin is
[1:20:44] death and death means eternally
[1:20:46] separated from God separated from God so
[1:20:49] that angel can't come from the fall who
[1:20:51] fell who fought in that that great water
[1:20:53] that was in Heaven until I I want to
[1:20:54] come back now you
[1:20:56] know you you you heard what I said a
[1:20:59] angel can't come and say take my back I
[1:21:01] make a
[1:21:05] mistake can the church say Amen D made a
[1:21:09] decision and the consequence of that is
[1:21:12] death there's no hope for Angels who
[1:21:14] fell from their first
[1:21:19] estate but sons of God have a different
[1:21:21] relationship with
[1:21:24] God and if you fall there's a way for
[1:21:27] you to come back to
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:30] godallah that's one of the reasons the
[1:21:32] Demonic forces are so upset because
[1:21:34] there's no hope for them you make a
[1:21:37] decision in the spiritual realm there's
[1:21:38] a permanent
[1:21:43] consequence even if the devil wanted to
[1:21:45] make amends he can't make amends CU
[1:21:46] there's no provision for him to make
[1:21:49] amends those angels cannot make amends
[1:21:52] but but sons who fall out of position
[1:21:54] can come back into
[1:21:59] position because God is a judge and
[1:22:01] because there's blood on the Judgment
[1:22:03] seat it makes it a Mercy Seat but that
[1:22:06] blood is Kinsman
[1:22:08] blood that blood is only for Kinsmen
[1:22:13] only for sons and daughters and that
[1:22:15] blood come the church same will never
[1:22:17] lose its power there's no blood for
[1:22:19] those angels but there's blood for you
[1:22:21] this morning there's blood for your son
[1:22:23] blood for your wife blood for your
[1:22:27] childrenall can the church say Amen
[1:22:29] there's Mercy for
[1:22:31] you
[1:22:33] hallu and God longed for a relationship
[1:22:37] so when he put man there in the Garden
[1:22:39] of Eden that perfect man walked around
[1:22:41] God loved to come down and his presence
[1:22:44] was in the Garden of
[1:22:45] Eden I'm going to share a few things
[1:22:47] with you this
[1:22:49] morning Hallelujah and in the cool of
[1:22:51] the evening God as it were found a place
[1:22:55] a GPS location with a conle for his
[1:22:58] presence there in the garden on every
[1:23:01] evening every evening brother George in
[1:23:03] the cool of the evening you can find his
[1:23:09] presence because that was a relationship
[1:23:11] he wanted Divine Fellowship as it were
[1:23:14] he wanted to dwell among his people he
[1:23:16] wanted his presence to be
[1:23:18] accessible no wonder David cried or take
[1:23:21] not thy present take me not away from
[1:23:23] your presence oh Lord create in me a
[1:23:26] clean heart renew a right Spirit Within
[1:23:28] Me cast me not away from your
[1:23:32] presence how important
[1:23:35] presence
[1:23:39] wasu Adam and they when they fell they
[1:23:41] heard the voice of God so listen even
[1:23:43] when man fell his
[1:23:45] presence was still there relationship
[1:23:48] was broken but his presence was still
[1:23:50] there because they heard the voice
[1:23:53] walking unable the Bible said they hid
[1:23:55] from his
[1:24:01] presence
[1:24:04] Hallelujah when you go through Genesis
[1:24:06] even when Cain and Abel were commanded
[1:24:09] brother the K to bring sacrifice God's
[1:24:11] presence was still addressing Cain even
[1:24:14] though Cain was the son of the
[1:24:16] devil because the Bible said only after
[1:24:19] Cain killed Abel God drove him from the
[1:24:25] presence that's why you could be broken
[1:24:28] and in sin today and God still allows
[1:24:30] you to come into His
[1:24:32] presence hallelujah hallelujah as a
[1:24:35] means to bring Deliverance to
[1:24:38] you it's how you act in his presence
[1:24:41] that makes a difference so when Isaiah
[1:24:44] we read the scripture went into the
[1:24:45] presence of the Lord he recognize say
[1:24:48] who is
[1:24:49] me in his presence the prophet will go
[1:24:51] on in the message in his presence is
[1:24:53] when he had to recognize wait a minute
[1:24:55] there's some issues that I didn't
[1:24:56] realize I had but the more you come into
[1:24:59] His presence is the more playing the
[1:25:00] issues
[1:25:03] become friends you know we don't see our
[1:25:05] issues
[1:25:08] right in our minds we have a view of how
[1:25:12] the world sees us that's different from
[1:25:14] how the world sees us you
[1:25:16] know you ever see somebody but a punch
[1:25:18] walk in the street and ask them if they
[1:25:20] have a mirror at home
[1:25:24] because it couldn't be they didn't have
[1:25:25] a mirror because they thought they they
[1:25:26] had to have thought they left the home
[1:25:27] looking
[1:25:29] okay but when you see that person
[1:25:31] looking crazy you
[1:25:33] know I don't want to think they left the
[1:25:35] house like that thinking they were not
[1:25:37] looking
[1:25:38] good they left you home with a view that
[1:25:41] they were okay you say things and then
[1:25:43] somebody to tell you afterwards you know
[1:25:44] how you said it wasn't right maybe you
[1:25:47] meant something different by it but the
[1:25:49] way it came out was different from what
[1:25:50] you expressed is because it's very
[1:25:53] difficult for us to see ourselves
[1:25:55] because we are in ourselves it takes
[1:25:57] somebody outside of us for us to see
[1:26:00] what we are doing that's not right or it
[1:26:02] takes a perspective Through The Eyes of
[1:26:04] the word for example to say well that
[1:26:06] behavior is jealousy or is Envy or it's
[1:26:08] gossip or it's malice or it's something
[1:26:11] else so we talk about the the the the
[1:26:14] Prodigal Son the brother the brother was
[1:26:16] fine until his situation came to
[1:26:18] highlight there was an issue in his
[1:26:20] heart if the younger brother never came
[1:26:23] back and never went through that it
[1:26:24] would have never known what was in the
[1:26:26] older brother's
[1:26:27] heart are you with me this
[1:26:30] morning so in God's presence is a way
[1:26:32] for you to see but wait a minute
[1:26:34] something is wrong you
[1:26:37] know I've had young people say well I
[1:26:40] really don't Joy anymore you don't know
[1:26:43] why come into His presence come closer
[1:26:47] into his presence and the closer you
[1:26:48] come into His presence I can guarantee
[1:26:50] you you will find out why because you
[1:26:52] begin to see wait a minute from the word
[1:26:54] from the anointing and not praying and
[1:26:56] not crying and not seeking and not
[1:26:57] forgiving not holding all of God it's
[1:26:59] impossible for you to not come into his
[1:27:01] present and recognize there's something
[1:27:02] to change and that willingness to change
[1:27:05] has to come from you can the church say
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:12] Amen the presence of God but God's
[1:27:16] desire was not to be a presence in a
[1:27:19] garden God desire was always a
[1:27:22] Tabernacle his presence anybody with me
[1:27:26] but he couldn't do it there in the
[1:27:27] garden he couldn't do it there in
[1:27:28] Genesis because there was no way for him
[1:27:29] to do it because that tabernacling had
[1:27:32] to take a process can the church say
[1:27:34] Amen so God went from in the garden to
[1:27:38] when you look through scripture when the
[1:27:39] children of Israel left Egypt God was
[1:27:42] present the presence of God was with
[1:27:44] them how they knew he was with them he
[1:27:46] was a pillar of fire and a cloud you
[1:27:48] wake up in the morning you see the cloud
[1:27:50] you wake up in the night you see the
[1:27:51] pillar of Fire and you feel confident
[1:27:53] that the Lord is with me Caleb could say
[1:27:55] if the Lord is with me meaning if his
[1:27:57] presence is with me I'll be more than
[1:27:59] able to drive all the
[1:28:01] enemy God told Moses my presence will go
[1:28:04] before thee you know what it is to go

[1:28:44] communion with you can the church say
[1:28:50] Amen the great this desire of God to
[1:28:54] have
[1:28:57] fellowship and this process this journey
[1:29:00] as it were of God tabernacling
[1:29:04] himself you go through the scripture in
[1:29:07] Exodus God gave Moses instruction to
[1:29:11] build a
[1:29:12] tabernacle which was supposed to be the
[1:29:14] movable mechanism to move the presence
[1:29:17] of
[1:29:18] God because they were on the Move by the
[1:29:20] church so they have have a way to move
[1:29:23] with the cloud as it were and then put
[1:29:25] the pillar the the Ark of the Covenant
[1:29:26] and everything and there all of the
[1:29:28] instructions but that wasn't a permanent
[1:29:30] place for God to
[1:29:32] dwell and they had tremendous victories
[1:29:35] when they know the presence was there
[1:29:37] that's why when they had to cross over
[1:29:38] in into into the the the the the to go
[1:29:41] over Jericho that the ark had to go
[1:29:42] before them because that represented the
[1:29:45] presence of God going with them can the
[1:29:46] Church Say
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:50] Amen
[1:29:52] but God wasn't happy to be in a in a in
[1:29:55] a movable in a in a one day a day one
[1:29:58] day a day no no no no no God is looking
[1:30:00] for somewhere we could stay he could
[1:30:03] rest he could be comfortable to operate
[1:30:05] can the church say amen he wanted a
[1:30:07] presence of God to be to have a a place
[1:30:10] where he could be always there can the
[1:30:11] church say Amen anybody with me this
[1:30:14] morning we're going to get into a few
[1:30:19] things but we know through it through
[1:30:21] all the and all the stuff that happened
[1:30:23] with Moses and the Tabernacle and
[1:30:24] Through the Ages all through the judges
[1:30:26] and to the point where it reached to the
[1:30:29] Kings but abam said God always knew he
[1:30:32] wanted a king you
[1:30:33] know but man interrupted God's plan for
[1:30:37] a king he said the devil interrupted
[1:30:41] it and man looked around and said but
[1:30:43] all the other kingdoms have leaders why
[1:30:45] we don't get
[1:30:47] one and God have to tell Samuel they
[1:30:49] haven't rejected you they rejected me
[1:30:52] but God always knew he was going to have
[1:30:53] a king through the line of David but
[1:30:56] Saul stood there as it
[1:30:58] were until God finally have a better
[1:31:03] manall and while Saul is King David is
[1:31:06] learning to understand the presence of
[1:31:11] God Saul is there and an evil spirit
[1:31:14] come and when David come and play the
[1:31:16] H David is able to drive away the evil
[1:31:18] spirit and welcome the presence of God
[1:31:22] it's important that you know how to move
[1:31:23] in the presence of God do you know how
[1:31:25] to create an atmosphere in your home an
[1:31:27] atmosphere in your car one time the
[1:31:30] brandom said somebody spoke a Blue
[1:31:31] Streak into his car remember that talk
[1:31:34] about the present and the atmosphere and
[1:31:35] what's around you that's why always say
[1:31:37] you C be coming out of a prayer meeting
[1:31:39] and cuss somebody
[1:31:41] out because impossible to come from the
[1:31:43] presence of God and go into anger and go
[1:31:45] into because the presence has an effect
[1:31:47] on
[1:31:50] you
[1:31:54] when people walk to the prophet they
[1:31:55] will feel but said it's it's okay it's
[1:31:57] okay because they felt the presence oh
[1:31:59] come on now there was something around
[1:32:01] the prophet it was emanating from the
[1:32:03] inside so when you come close to him you
[1:32:06] would feel it he said that's okay that's
[1:32:07] just
[1:32:10] his anybody with
[1:32:12] me so there's coming a time brother
[1:32:14] George when he will walk and you walk
[1:32:16] the Cru and people just look at you and
[1:32:17] I don't know why they looking at you but
[1:32:18] what what they're feeling something
[1:32:19] different about you there's a presence
[1:32:22] that's pulsating from inside your soul
[1:32:24] you can't read it into there no no no no
[1:32:27] no it's come by an experience and a
[1:32:29] placing that God does something and he
[1:32:32] feels comfortable to step inside of
[1:32:34] there can the church say
[1:32:38] Amen come on now hallu so all through
[1:32:41] this David by the time David is King
[1:32:44] David in his heart David looking at this
[1:32:47] all these things they've been doing all
[1:32:48] they say this C be right and in his
[1:32:50] heart he have a bird I want to get a
[1:32:52] place I want to get a house of the Lord
[1:32:55] David was one in all the Psalms he said
[1:32:57] I was glad when they said unto me let's
[1:32:59] go to the house of the Lord he want a
[1:33:01] place that God could be present a place
[1:33:03] you could go and he could know that he
[1:33:05] is there can the church say Amen oh
[1:33:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:13] hallelujah but God looked at David and
[1:33:15] said David there's too much blood on
[1:33:17] your
[1:33:20] hands
[1:33:23] and God picked David's son Solomon to
[1:33:26] build the temple Hallelujah give him
[1:33:29] wisdom Beyond his ears give him Wealth
[1:33:32] Beyond what he asked for give him
[1:33:34] whatever he needed to be able to perform
[1:33:36] the task give the prescription and the
[1:33:39] order and to get the right elements but
[1:33:41] most importantly the Bible says that
[1:33:43] when everything was in place the glory
[1:33:45] of the Lord the presence of the Lord
[1:33:48] filled the house and they all knew that
[1:33:51] the presence of the Lord was in that
[1:33:54] place
[1:33:56] Hallelujah this was now the fixed place
[1:33:59] where you know the glory was because the
[1:34:01] presence was there the high priest had
[1:34:03] to move a certain way because the
[1:34:05] presence was there you had to operate a
[1:34:06] certain
[1:34:12] way but all of this is a journey because
[1:34:15] God don't want to be Tabernacle in a
[1:34:17] physical
[1:34:20] building can the church say amen God
[1:34:23] don't want to be locked up in a physical
[1:34:25] building he can't have an effect in the
[1:34:26] building he wants to have an effect on
[1:34:28] lives can the church say Amen so what
[1:34:32] was a Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:34:34] becomes a temple that Solomon build then
[1:34:36] we know about the whole Babylonian
[1:34:37] Invasion and the temple got destroyed
[1:34:39] and then through nemiah they restor the
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:43] temple and then Jesus comes in the
[1:34:48] earth and the Pharisees didn't realize
[1:34:51] who he he was because the temple the
[1:34:53] Tabernacle was not walking among
[1:34:55] them the presence the great presence
[1:34:59] that was there in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:01] that was housing the Tabernacle in the
[1:35:02] wilderness that was there when Solomon
[1:35:04] built the temple all of that was locked
[1:35:07] up in
[1:35:10] Jesus God and man come together and the
[1:35:12] temple was now moving and it was fixed
[1:35:14] at the same time can the church say Amen
[1:35:18] because his presence never left that
[1:35:19] Temple but that Temple could move that
[1:35:22] Temple could come to your house that
[1:35:24] Temple could meet you at the point of
[1:35:25] your need that Temple could walk to
[1:35:27] Blind
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:31] bmus that Temple could go to the temple
[1:35:34] and he didn't realize that the real
[1:35:35] Temple had come to the temple oh you
[1:35:37] don't hear me this
[1:35:39] morning friends there's no Temple or no
[1:35:42] Tabernacle without the presence of God
[1:35:43] but when Jesus was there all I was in
[1:35:45] God was locked up in Christ and he was
[1:35:48] that Temple oh come on now somebody say
[1:35:50] Amen Oh Glory to
[1:35:54] God the presence of God had moved from
[1:35:57] Tabernacle to
[1:36:00] heart so when Jesus stood there and said
[1:36:04] destroy this temple in three
[1:36:06] days they were so out of spirit they
[1:36:08] were looking at the physical
[1:36:10] Temple they didn't realize that the
[1:36:13] presence had been moving he had moved
[1:36:15] from In the Garden of Eden he had moved
[1:36:17] from pushing people out the garden he
[1:36:19] had moved into the wilderness to be a
[1:36:21] comfort for them in the trouble and the
[1:36:23] trials and the wars in the time of
[1:36:26] Solomon there was peace and stability
[1:36:28] when the Pres was Tabernacle in the
[1:36:30] temple all of this was signs and types
[1:36:32] pointing to what was to come but here
[1:36:35] was Jesus on the earth now bringing a
[1:36:37] new kind of Temple a new kind of
[1:36:40] Tabernacle that Paul and they would
[1:36:42] speak about don't you know that you are
[1:36:43] temples of the Holy Ghost don't you know
[1:36:46] that you are living Tabernacles don't
[1:36:48] you know that you are living
[1:36:50] temples
[1:36:52] God moving Dwelling
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:37:02] Place can the church say Amen somebody
[1:37:05] give God praise somebody worship Him
[1:37:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:37:13] [Applause]

[1:37:21] God in inde the dwell on the earth
[1:37:23] behold the Heaven and the heaven of
[1:37:25] Heavens cannot contain
[1:37:26] thee so God knew that the Earth can't
[1:37:29] hold his glory you know that's why when
[1:37:31] the power rise it'll be a short quick
[1:37:33] message that shake the whole nation this
[1:37:35] Earth can't take the power but these
[1:37:38] vessels these Tabernacles in here could
[1:37:40] handle the
[1:37:41] power all of God was locked up in Christ
[1:37:44] and he could handle the power and the
[1:37:47] Bride of Jesus Christ will handle the
[1:37:50] power

[1:39:20] his are ra it back up again because he
[1:39:22] knew the present that was in him it's
[1:39:24] the same way you could walk boldly like
[1:39:26] Paul said death where's where's your
[1:39:28] thing grave where is your Victory he
[1:39:31] knew what was in him he say if we cast
[1:39:33] down this body another body waiting for
[1:39:36] me because I know what's working inside
[1:39:38] of me it's not an intellectual
[1:39:41] understanding but it's a presence of God

[1:39:49] ending his presence bring brings life
[1:39:52] his presence bring healing his presence
[1:39:54] brings Deliverance one time Aaron left
[1:39:56] his
[1:39:57] rod in the holy of holies the presence
[1:40:01] was in there brother Anthony and when he
[1:40:03] came back that Rod that was a dead Rod
[1:40:05] had sprouted and blossomed and brought
[1:40:08] forth fruit he left it by accident and

[1:40:44] Amen 1 Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that
[1:40:48] he are the temple of God that's
[1:40:51] individuals in other words God has seen
[1:40:53] it fit that the body these human
[1:40:56] Tabernacles are more important to him
[1:40:58] than the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:41:00] these Tabernacles in here this morning
[1:41:02] are more important to God than the
[1:41:04] temple that Solomon built with all the
[1:41:06] ornate carvings and all the materials
[1:41:09] these temples in this room are more
[1:41:11] important to God oh you don't hear me
[1:41:13] this
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:17] morning somebody give God praise
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:31] the presence of God from
[1:41:34] Tabernacle to
[1:41:37] heart it's a heart matter it's always a
[1:41:40] heart condition it's not an intellectual
[1:41:42] presence it's not an idea of a idea of
[1:41:45] God or have an understanding of God no
[1:41:47] no no no no no no no no it's a presence
[1:41:49] that's why the prophet would say we we
[1:41:50] are waiting on
[1:41:53] him he said you know what I'm waiting on
[1:41:55] the prophet understood that he could do
[1:41:57] nothing until he was
[1:41:59] here he said we're waiting on him and
[1:42:01] then he would say he is here he said now
[1:42:03] I take every Spirit under my control
[1:42:07] because his presence is here because
[1:42:09] when his presence is here no demon could
[1:42:11] stand that demon of female condition in
[1:42:13] his presence it's finished that demon of
[1:42:16] high blood pressure in his presence it's
[1:42:17] finished and I'm declaring to you this
[1:42:20] morning by the testimony of Jesus which
[1:42:22] is the spirit of Prophecy that the angel
[1:42:24] of the Lord his presence is here he has
[1:42:27] been here all along when the prophet
[1:42:29] left his presence did not leave his
[1:42:31] presence sits on the word waiting for
[1:42:34] sons of God with faith to reach into the
[1:42:37] word he said one day the right thing
[1:42:39] will be spoken the right thing will be
[1:42:41] done oh come on
[1:42:44] now and we could Dash into the presence
[1:42:46] of
[1:42:49] God
[1:42:51] hallelujah hallelujah Young Brother
[1:42:53] young sister do you feel his presence do
[1:42:55] you know he's real what are you going to
[1:42:57] do about it Isaiah today said war is
[1:43:02] me this was a
[1:43:05] prophet a great prophet he said I'm
[1:43:08] undone I thought my laces was tie but I
[1:43:11] recog my laces not tie I'm undone that's
[1:43:13] what undone mean stuff that was supposed
[1:43:15] to be in place that I thought was in
[1:43:16] place I didn't realize it was done in
[1:43:18] place but I'm in its presence and I'm
[1:43:20] seeing stuff that I didn't
[1:43:30] realize and that impact was the presence
[1:43:34] outside of Isaiah but the popular that
[1:43:37] wasn't the pillar of fire in his heart
[1:43:40] that was him coming into contact with
[1:43:41] presence and God wants to do more than
[1:43:44] that for us because only when Jesus came
[1:43:46] and opened the door for his presence to
[1:43:48] not just be on the outside or felt on
[1:43:50] the outside you could because you could
[1:43:51] feel his presence and his presence not
[1:43:53] be on the
[1:43:56] inside many people feel the presence and
[1:43:58] they go back and they do the same things
[1:44:00] because they didn't allow the presence
[1:44:02] to move from the outside to
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:07] in and what we really want to get is the
[1:44:09] presence to move outside to in so that
[1:44:11] it could control from inside to
[1:44:15] out because when the Holy Ghost moves on
[1:44:17] the inside and begin to control from the
[1:44:19] outside in then it's no longer
[1:44:21] you that's why Peter could say he didn't
[1:44:23] lie to
[1:44:24] me you lie to the Holy Ghost because you
[1:44:28] thought it was me brother Peter I
[1:44:29] preached last week but this Peter today
[1:44:31] is a different Peter he didn't lie to me
[1:44:32] you lie to the Holy Ghost because he has
[1:44:34] tabernacled himself you're coming to a
[1:44:37] temple and he he holies the holies is
[1:44:39] here and the angel of the Lord is on the
[1:44:40] throne and he's the one taking the
[1:44:42] questions and the answers he's dealing
[1:44:44] and heing the thought of the heart he
[1:44:46] know what you came in with he knows how
[1:44:47] you want to
[1:44:49] leave
[1:44:53] friends we're going back to that you
[1:44:55] know ananas and Safa they came to church
[1:44:59] thinking it was a temple headstone
[1:45:01] Tabernacle and didn't realize inside the
[1:45:04] temple was another
[1:45:07] Temple inside the Tabernacle was a
[1:45:10] temple called
[1:45:12] Peter there was a presence in the
[1:45:14] Tabernacle but inside of Peter inside of
[1:45:16] that Tabernacle was the Holy Ghost
[1:45:19] itself
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:26] so we can call this the Tabernacle
[1:45:27] inside the
[1:45:29] Tabernacle the temple inside the temple
[1:45:32] is the thing in the thing the temple
[1:45:33] inside the temple inside they have a
[1:45:35] thing inside of it call the Holy
[1:45:38] Ghost the control tower he's the power
[1:45:41] that leads you to say things and do
[1:45:43] things that somebody don't want to do it

[1:46:46] presence friends could you take some
[1:46:49] more
[1:46:53] but the brandom speaks about losing the
[1:46:56] sensitivity or the sense of
[1:46:58] Consciousness or the sense of conscience
[1:47:01] he said that the still Small Voice the
[1:47:03] presence of God will speak to you and he
[1:47:05] said every time you ignore it the volume
[1:47:08] gets
[1:47:10] lower until you could reach a point
[1:47:12] where you can't hear it
[1:47:19] anymore
[1:47:22] the word teaches us that God doesn't
[1:47:24] send anybody to
[1:47:26] Hell God doesn't send any way to hell
[1:47:29] but the BAM said it this way he say you
[1:47:31] run all the red
[1:47:33] lights because God does every single
[1:47:36] thing possible to stop you from going to
[1:47:38] hell the Bible said God doesn't want
[1:47:41] anyone to be
[1:47:42] lost it is his desire that everyone be
[1:47:47] saved but he doesn't choose for us
[1:47:51] but the whole principle of
[1:47:52] predestination is based on for knowledge
[1:47:54] which knows what you will choose and God
[1:47:56] now writes his story based on your
[1:48:03] choice but it always comes on to your
[1:48:07] choice and the choice now to do what you
[1:48:10] need to do in his
[1:48:12] presence and that's why the but over and
[1:48:15] the service will always say come to
[1:48:16] church in the
[1:48:19] spirit
[1:48:21] come in the atmosphere don't wait for
[1:48:23] the song leader to put you in the
[1:48:24] atmosphere you have to come with your
[1:48:26] Revival because when you are in the
[1:48:28] spirit the spirit can now speak to you
[1:48:29] and deal with
[1:48:32] you and the word now could have a deeper
[1:48:35] impact and effect in you because you are
[1:48:36] now already open to receive and you're
[1:48:39] in his presence now God could say
[1:48:40] something to you to change your life not
[1:48:42] just for more information but to change
[1:48:43] your life because information don't
[1:48:46] change your life the world is to give
[1:48:47] you Faith to reach into the promise of
[1:48:49] God that's already given you know God
[1:48:51] not paying for the price now the price
[1:48:53] already paid

[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:33] here the Bible said that King Uzziah
[1:56:37] died and brother brandom taught us that
[1:56:40] Isaiah was leaning on Uzziah Uzziah was
[1:56:43] a crutch for him a comfort for him it
[1:56:45] was a place where he feel he could have
[1:56:48] confided and maybe share things with and
[1:56:51] all these
[1:56:53] things Uzziah was taken time from Isaiah
[1:56:56] away from time and say could have spent
[1:56:58] in the presence of
[1:57:01] God and it was only when Uzziah died and
[1:57:05] Isaiah was left
[1:57:07] alone he found himself being pushed into
[1:57:11] presence Hallelujah I wonder how many
[1:57:14] things God needs to remove from around
[1:57:17] us so we could be driven in into his
[1:57:29] presence in his message in his presence
[1:57:31] I'm getting ready to wind down but the
[1:57:33] BAM said in Exodus 3 we finded Moses the
[1:57:36] great servant and prophet of God when he
[1:57:39] was in the back side of the desert that
[1:57:40] man was a holy man he had been born for
[1:57:42] a purpose don't you know that you're
[1:57:44] born for a purpose he was born from his
[1:57:47] mother's womb to be a prophet
[1:57:51] he had tried to get his education and do
[1:57:53] everything he could to deliver his
[1:57:55] people because he understood that he was
[1:57:57] to deliver his
[1:57:59] people but he understood it by a
[1:58:01] theological standpoint he understood it
[1:58:03] from the word and the scriptures and the
[1:58:05] message of the hour he was trained he
[1:58:08] was well scholar he could teach the
[1:58:10] Egyptian wisdom which was the most
[1:58:12] smartest people in the world he knewed
[1:58:14] all the ins and
[1:58:16] outs brother Bram said he know the
[1:58:18] scriptures from to Z that's why you hear
[1:58:21] Spirit tell me don't matter how long any
[1:58:23] message how much quotes you know he said
[1:58:24] Moses knew the scripture from A to
[1:58:28] Z Moses would be the one God would use
[1:58:30] to write the first five books of the
[1:58:35] Bible it'll be Moses was there among
[1:58:38] Transfiguration he's a critical piece of
[1:58:40] God's
[1:58:42] puzzle hallelu but all of his knowledge
[1:58:45] and his experience was nothing
[1:58:48] Hallelujah until he came into
[1:58:51] presence hallu hallu brother bam said he
[1:58:55] know it from an intellectual standpoint
[1:58:57] he was a great military man but one day
[1:59:00] on the backside of the desert when he
[1:59:02] come into the presence of
[1:59:07] God he jerked his shoes and fell to his
[1:59:11] feet knowing that he was on Holy
[1:59:15] Ground in other words before God could
[1:59:17] even speak with him he had acknowledge
[1:59:20] he was on Holy
[1:59:22] Ground he had to have respect he had to
[1:59:26] recognize that God was present he had to
[1:59:29] recognize he wasn't in his
[1:59:32] houseall he had to recognize it wasn't a
[1:59:36] a casual
[1:59:38] thing it wasn't now well I going to
[1:59:40] church thing no he was in
[1:59:43] presence he couldn't stand upon his feet
[1:59:46] when he come into the presence of
[1:59:48] God
[1:59:50] he fell to his face like Abraham did he
[1:59:52] could not even stand in the presence of
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:57] God friends do you approach it with
[2:00:01] reverence do you approach it with
[2:00:02] respect it has nothing to do with me has
[2:00:05] nothing to do with man or no has to do
[2:00:07] with the presence of
[2:00:09] God ananas and saf approached Peter
[2:00:12] thinking it was Peter not realizing the
[2:00:14] season
[2:00:17] change right if they had realized a
[2:00:20] season changed it would have been
[2:00:22] different towards brother
[2:00:25] Peter and you don't know what day you
[2:00:27] walk into the church and the Deacon
[2:00:30] different the Usher different the
[2:00:33] musician different the technician
[2:00:35] different the minister different you'll
[2:00:38] see brother Anthony but it's not brother
[2:00:39] Anthony you'll see brother stepen but
[2:00:41] it's not brother Steven you'll see the
[2:00:43] pastor but it's not the pastor you'll
[2:00:45] see me but it's not going to be me
[2:00:47] because the Holy Ghost wants a
[2:00:48] tabernacle himself the presence went to
[2:00:51] Tabernacle himself you'll see your
[2:00:53] brother next to you and it's not your
[2:00:54] brother because it's the Holy Ghost
[2:00:57] itself be careful of what you say be
[2:01:00] careful of what you do this is not just
[2:01:02] a Ministry thing God wants a tabernacle
[2:01:05] himself in temples the temples in the
[2:01:08] temple the Tabernacles in the
[2:01:15] Tabernacle and that's why we fight in
[2:01:18] this church to create an
[2:01:20] atmosphere because the Bible say when
[2:01:22] the glory and the Praises go up the
[2:01:25] glory glory of God can come down this
[2:01:28] Glory can never come down without an
[2:01:31] atmosphere when the Praises go up the
[2:01:35] glory of God comes down it will never
[2:01:37] just walk into the room it's when the
[2:01:40] people begin to sing and worship and say
[2:01:43] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[2:01:47] who was and is and is to come the Earth
[2:01:49] is filled with his glory when they begin
[2:01:51] to sing praises and they say there is
[2:01:54] none like you the oh Hallelujah he is
[2:01:58] worthy of the praise when you create
[2:02:00] that atmosphere God feels
[2:02:05] [Applause]
[2:02:06] comfortable and then the healings take
[2:02:09] place and then the Breakthrough takes
[2:02:17] place
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:33] brother Bram said man in the presence of
[2:02:35] God realizes he's a
[2:02:45] sinner he said Adam recognized himself
[2:02:50] wrong Moses recognized himself wrong
[2:02:54] Israel recognized himself
[2:02:56] wrong Isaiah recognized himself wrong

[2:03:53] could be wrong to the ministry it could
[2:03:55] be wrong about your finances wrong about
[2:03:57] your job wrong about your prayer life
[2:03:59] wrong about gossip wrong about Envy
[2:04:01] wrong about malice wrong about
[2:04:13] hatred thank you for your
[2:04:15] pres brother bam say I'd like to stop
[2:04:17] here a minute and say that to thing you

[2:04:22] might be you might have went to church
[2:04:23] since you was a child you might have
[2:04:26] done all the religious acts there is but
[2:04:29] once in the presence of God you'll feel
[2:04:31] so little and no count oh God help me to
[2:04:34] feel

[2:04:51] zero Hallelujah he want to see you
[2:04:54] broken L he want you to say Lord I need
[2:04:58] you more Lord I'm wrong every good thing
[2:05:02] I've ever done is still
[2:05:07] wrong prise God
[2:05:11] Godus he said Paul realized that he was
[2:05:13] wrong and fell to the ground under the
[2:05:15] influence and the power and when he
[2:05:17] looked up and he seen the very God that
[2:05:19] he had been preaching against and
[2:05:20] thought he knew and seeing that he was
[2:05:22] wrong he fell from his feet to the
[2:05:24] ground because he was in the presence of
[2:05:26] God he had seen that Pillar of
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:41] Fire he said we could come to church and
[2:05:44] talk and praise God and so forth but oh
[2:05:46] brother when we see him coming something
[2:05:49] will be different in our
[2:05:51] hearts we might think we do our
[2:05:53] religious Duty by going to church and
[2:05:55] paying our tithings we might think we
[2:05:58] keep the laws of the church and recite
[2:06:00] all the Creeds but once let us get a
[2:06:02] look at him at him the whole things
[2:06:04] change all the way
[2:06:08] around the Bible said that John felt as
[2:06:11] if he was a dead
[2:06:12] man bring us back to that kind of
[2:06:14] sincerity you
[2:06:17] knowall thank you Lord thank you
[2:06:25] Lord we see Isaiah the scripture you
[2:06:28] read Hallelujah the Great Mighty Prophet
[2:06:30] Hallelujah one of the greatest prophets
[2:06:32] there is in the
[2:06:34] Bible Isaiah was one of the Major
[2:06:36] Prophets but one day I'm reading the
[2:06:38] prophet's words he had been leaning upon
[2:06:40] the arm of Uzziah the great king and
[2:06:43] Uzziah had been taken from him and he
[2:06:45] was down he was a pretty good fellow he
[2:06:47] was a righteous man
[2:06:50] Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet
[2:06:52] Isaiah preached the word he was a
[2:06:54] minister Isaiah was a holy man but one
[2:06:56] day standing in the temple he fell into
[2:06:59] a trans and he saw the glory of
[2:07:01] God he saw the angels with wings over
[2:07:04] their face Wings over their feet flying
[2:07:08] with wings crying holy holy holy is the
[2:07:10] Lord God
[2:07:12] Almighty the prophet realized he was
[2:07:17] nothing
[2:07:19] whoo is me for I'm a man of unclean lips
[2:07:23] brother said a prophet a mightiest
[2:07:26] prophet of the Bible one of them I am a
[2:07:28] man with unclean lips and I dwell among
[2:07:31] people that unclean lips woe is me
[2:07:33] because I see the glory of God
[2:07:35] hallelujah and he said when the angel
[2:07:37] cried the post of the temple Shook Back
