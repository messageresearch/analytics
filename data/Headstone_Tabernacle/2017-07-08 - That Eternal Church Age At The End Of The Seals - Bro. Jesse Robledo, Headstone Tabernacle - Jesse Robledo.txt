amen it certainly feels good to be in Trinidad amen hallelujah I think I would say Ghana is Far Far Away amen and just to be in Trinidad is a humbling experience to know that there's a people that love the Lord and to know that there's a people that sacrifice for God's people Amen to see brother ID making the trips to Ghana every now and then and to have to travel to Trinidad is quite a humbling experience he will never say no to comeing and it's far far away from Ghana amen we started the journey on Sunday and arrived on Tuesday so that tells you how far it is amen but we are happy to be here amen hallelujah and God is gracious to us I'm here with my wife sister Jane Nina and on behalf of her in the church we bring greetings to our precious brother ID brother Isaac brother Anthony and the the church and sister anarie and to say we are happy to be amongst God's people amen and so it's just the love of God and that love found us now we couldn't find that love because we were born in sin cut off from the love but that love found us and that love Made A Way amen and so I have a scripture this morning to greet you that is taken from first John chapter 3 you don't have to get it it says behold what manner of love the father has bestor Upon Us bestowed upon us this is a beautiful part that we should be called the sons of God Amen therefore the world know us not young people the world don't know you because you are not of the world because it knoweth him not Hallelujah beloved on the Eighth Day Hallelujah on the new day on the new beginning now are we the sons of God hallelujah if the devil has been lying to you tell the devil now I am a Son of God now I am a daughter of God because he has bestowed his love over me Hallelujah I have been arrested by the love of God I can't go to the right I can't go to the left I'm standing in the middle of the room standing with the word standing with that word in love with God hallelujah amen but the devil will tell you you not yet perfect look at you made a mistake and it does not yet appear what we shall be Satan hallelujah hallelujah made a mistake yesterday it does not yet appear what I'm going to be but in the back part of God's mind I am perfect Hallelujah I am standing there because there's a love Banner Over Me and when Divine love is projected brother what devil can stop you Sovereign Grace takes over I'm walking under the banner I'm walking under the shik glory of the grace of the Living God hallelujah that's why when Paul understood this law Paul asked the question what shall separate me from this law what shall separate me from this law shall tribulation shall cut me off shall Force anointed nothing present nothing past nothing future will separate me from this love of God it is not my love it is not a group love it is the love of God that chose me that found me that planted my feet on that rock to stay what shall separate me what shall separate me hallelujah oh brother we should be shouting this morning we should be jumping this morning because we are hooked up in the love of God not if you will you are hooked up not by your will by by his will oh blessed be the name of a living God hallelujah it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall be but we know that when he shall appear on the eighth day will be Spirit of his Spirit flesh of his flesh Hallelujah a reflection of his very image Faith all the way to charity when he shall appear The Headstone connecting with the body when he that love shall appear oh blessed be the name of the Living God there's going to be brotherly kindness manifested when he shall appear the bride will once more be the voice of God on the earth reflecting the seven spirits of God oh when he shall appear here when the headstone unites with the body we shall be like him we shall be in his very image faith will be manifested virtue will be manifested knowledge will be manifested Temperance godness brly kindness charity will be manifested what shall separate us from the love of God oh you love him when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is oh not another we shall see him as he is oh you love him this morning amen I'm about to leave this place amen but I'll just read a quote before I leave brother Braham said the way you may be seated the way of a true Prophet amen paragraph 217 he said when anything denies that word I'm against it all right amen when anything denies that word amen I am against it I believe you you are against it that's why we are gathered here today on the word not on systems not on organization not on men's ideas but a promise that there shall be a bride well that is the word a promise that the seven Thunders Shall Gather the bride together well that is the word hallelujah the seven Thunders will show the bride how to prepare well that is the word that is why we are here hallelujah looking for that glorious time Hallelujah another holy day is here another holy time is here where God's people will be United under the word not under system not under man's ideas but United under the word oh and anything against that word we are against it don't care who it is how it looks like where it comes from Brother anything against the word we against it Hallelujah there's going to be a bride United with that word that makes me said that makes me against every organization because it's against the word amen say ought to make every believer feel that way do you feel that way this morning oh I don't care how many poops and Prophets and what else you've got among you if you are of the word you are of the word hallelujah but thank God there's a pride that will recognize that word because there's a love bestowed upon you oh you love him this morning say how can God bless anything against his own word so get back to the word hallelujah oh a Holy Ghost a holy God watches over his word to vindicate that word you are part of the word so God Is Watching Over Us to vindicate that word to bring the bride to a manifestation now are we the sons of God to be made manifest cancer is going to be rebuked hallelujah hallelujah diabetes will be cast out because in my name you shall cast out devils and the prophet told that these are demon Powers well the sons of God are here to cast out these devils and I say this meeting we are in another holy time Hallelujah to cast out Devils because this is a Solem assembly and brother Peter told us that this is a no fly zone no sickness no trouble no mind battle no man's ideas no bills no sickness no worry nothing shall be able to stand before you Hallelujah oh blessed be the name of a living God cuz he's here to vindicate that word hallelujah and inclosing amen Joseph Joseph Hallelujah was a dreamer Hallelujah but Joseph couldn't help the father made him a quat he had to testify the brothers hated him for that coat amen but God gave him a dream upon that coat there was already a jealousy going on but God had to give him a dream Hallelujah of all the sheeps bowing to him hallelujah oh blessed be the name of a living God Amen and Joseph had to tell the dream he got more in trouble Hallelujah but here was the dream the dream had to be fulfilled but Joseph didn't know it was going to take a long process Joseph didn't know they would bind him in a well but that was part of that dream to be Vindicated Hallelujah they brought him out of the well sold him into slavery but that was part of the dream to be Vindicated Hallelujah Joseph was looking at the word he said I saw that Vision I saw that dream that's coming for the manifestation that's coming for the Vindication the world is not going to stop me slavery is not going to stop me the presence of pharaoh will not stop me because I am looking at the manifestation I'm looking at a Vindication oh hallelujah oh because Pharaoh was going to get a dream and there was a Joseph to interpret the dream Hallelujah because there was coming the eighth year or maybe the Eighth Day where there was been hunger there was going to be hunger all over the world but on the Eighth Day in the eighth year oh there was going to be plenty because Joseph had a vision Joseph had a dream but it was a process to bring the dream to a manifestation so there had to be Egypt there had to be a time of famine but there had to be a Joseph in Egypt in slavery but God was bringing the process of that dream to a Vindication oh there might be a time of reproach a time of Hunger but we are here in the time of the Vindication in the time of the manifestation another holy time a holy convocation maybe on the eth day there is plenty while there is hunger out there this is Joseph this is Joseph but he had a new name he had a new name but there was yet one part to be fulfilled there was one part to be fulfilled had to bow to Joseph they had to bow to Joseph they had to bow to Joseph because Joseph had to get into position oh on the E year they had to come all the way to bow to that Joseph and I say to you don't be weary don't be tired be the reproach this is the time for the Vindication of the manifestation of your faith may the Lord

wheel uh with men like that you see there are too many people that are building their own kingdoms here today amen but we're not here to build kingdoms we're here to be Witnesses amen you see the Holy Ghost was sent to be a witness Hallelujah without the Holy Ghost you cannot be a witness amen and I'm going to tell you something uh it's you shall be Witnesses unto me and me is the word hallelujah

God this building the God is all over the world amen amen I I always say you know I remember there was a a story that I used to read a genie you know you can't you can't stuff God in a Genie bottle

of man that's the work of God glory be to God amen hallelujah oh I feel good this morning amen hallelujah so I have enjoyed every service and the ministers that have uh testified and preached and surely my heart has been blessed uh I I have no words to you know you find try to look for uh the you know words in the dictionary to properly explain what is going on with the you know this is this is unspeakable you can't speak joy unspeakable and full of glory amen so praise this wonderful name I'm so thankful amen I want to thank uh and take this moment to uh thank brother oit for the invitation Amen to coming uh to come back to Trinidad is always a blessing for me to come amen and to share my testimony and my testimony I love this message with all my heart that's my testimony I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 14 years old amen I've been around the block a little B uh a few times amen and uh so this is my life I have nothing else amen you know if I would have found something better I would have gone with it right amen so I'm 57 now so you can imagine you do the calculation how long I've been around so therefore um I I have seen many things and one thing that I do appreciate is the sincerity of real godall men their objective their motive is to is to do their best to get people back to the word back to the word of God we have received a message in this end time amen and we now have brother Braham said the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication you see there's a lot of people say that they have the word but you see that's all good but God is going to manifest and prove because the head part can only rest on a True Body and that body has got to be the word amen amen and the head identifies a body as I have often said so you know there are many claims it's okay fine that's not a problem I I don't argue with no man brother Braham said I I argue with no man amen you preach the word and you just uh go on and love everybody because you see the trial that we many times face today from uh you know if you don't know a person for example if they run you down it's not a problem you don't know them but it's those that really are your friends and your Associates and things and then they that's the challenge you know right that's the challenge a a a and we have got to be mature enough and understand that these are trials to mold us and make [Applause] us to be more like Jesus Christ amen is written in the scripture where did you get these stripes in the house of my enemies no friends amen so praise the Lord hallelujah I'm so thankful for friends should I say that have helped me uh grow in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah every trial every tribulation listen to me right here right now nothing happens without God permitting it to [Music] happen and if God has permitted it praise God there must be a purpose for it that the purpose might be fulfilled and accomplished glory be to God you want to have faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance God cannot listen character is not a gift it is a victory you want virtue knowledge Temperance patience God has special design trials for you Hallelujah to give you the character of Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah amen I'm so happy oh blessed be his wonderful namej and and once again brother oit your family and uh the entire church I don't ever want to belittle or or or take lightly what has gone on behind the scenes because we realize that there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes and uh I want to say from the depths of my heart that that I do appreciate amen all the labors of Love behind the scenes and they I brother ID I think you've got this down to a science uh you know uh I mean mean just a smooth checkin and a smooth is just so wonderful praise the Lord God bless you and I appreciate men like uh brother oit and the family and the church here God bless you richly is my prayer you have made us very comfortable and welcomed amen so is is beyond my expectation and of course uh we say God rich ly bless you and if I would say this very uh quickly it is you know Paul uh said in Romans chap 1 and verse 8 he said I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world Amen your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world amen amen so stay with it it may not be many remember jesus' Church wasn't many he had 70 and and those 70s couldn't really uh accept the word of God Amen and when he turned over to Peter will you go also Peter had uh amen eternal life in him he had representation glory be to God he said where can I go I've gone everywhere where can I go for you alone have the words of eternal life and that's just the way I feel this message is correct praise God that's my testimony glory be to God I don't have to argue with nobody praise this wonderful name thank you brother Chandler amen representation by predestination Hallelujah Oh My My My you know if you don't have representation Amen in this day and age I doubt very much if you'll get too far you see because it's the grace of almighty God it's nothing that we have done amen tell me what righteousness have you done to earn what you have here today absolutely nothing and I'm so thankful that uh you know we have not chosen God he has chosen us amen and we're not holding on to God he's holding on to us we don't have the strength to hold on to God glory be to God and I'm so thankful and I that's why the scripture says all that the father has given me shall come and I will not lose not one praise God so brother Isaac also to uh last night possessing your individual inheritance and I was telling uh brother Isaac last night amen what a wonderful Masterpiece it was regarding Caleb now remember Caleb represents the believer you know amen so you know Joshua the Holy Spirit you know en type but Caleb he had his eyes on a mountain he had an eye his eyes on something that was promised to him as an individual he didn't represent the tribe is an individual Fair amen and today if you receive the Holy Ghost it's an individual experience you can't explain it to somebody else hallelujah amen it's something that God has done for you personally amen hallelujah and it'll speak for itself praise this wonderful name amen and I like what the uh brother Isaac said you know and brotherly kindness he said the brethren he amen that went with me amen he could have been on that mountain uh you know 40 plus years ago but the Brethren and we all know that the Brethren brought an evil report amen that's what the brother Brown says we have got to bring a good uh true report because Joshua and Caleb came back with the evidence the others did not they could only explain what they saw and what they felt and what you know but Vision Hallelujah Revelation Moses described the land flown with milk and honey and they saw it and that was enough for them Hallelujah and they came back with the evidence amen and we're now living by the evidence Hallelujah of that new land Hallelujah there is no way I can doubt it now praise God amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise God it's soul food now amen this is soul food this uh weekend God richly bless you amen and uh so our time is limited and we want to turn uh straight to the word and um May uh we can we can stand uh to our feet uh now as we turn to the word of God I trust that these few words would be a blessing to you amen and I want to uh under you to understand that as I said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and if we just read a scripture today that uh in my opinion is is uh enough I bring greetings from my wife I thank God for the specials by the way and all the testimonies that went forth if I should forget somebody or whatever uh it's not intentional there just our time is limited here and I just want to be obedient to I asked brother ID uh what I want to be in church order you know and and and back home I have a reputation of being uh well a little lengthy so I I don't want to do that here amen so but I do GRE uh bring greetings from my wife amen uh she wanted to be here of course uh she is uh working uh last week she was off but this week she had to go to work and uh if if I had worked out uh where the meetings were last week she would have been able to come but I do bring greetings from our little assembly in Valley Stream New York amen who is a group there that's waiting for the coming of the Lord amen you're waiting for the coming of the Lord amen hallelujah so God bless you and brother Solomon I had a a chance to speak to him just briefly on the on the bus and I heard his testimony God bless you I I amen you see I I listen but I also uh feel a person's spirit in which he he I like I like brother Solomon amen God richly bless you and prosper your ministry where uh when you go back home you see the bride can no longer be deceived you know amen because the word is in the bride and the word that's in the bride has got to compare now what what is going on around in the world today amen and you see your womb is closed because you have received the seed amen of this message you can't receive anything else glory be to God Hallelujah to the land I'm so thankful amen so quickly let us turn uh first of all let us uh I'm going to give you my uh title The Eternal Church age at the end of the seals amen that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals and so many have spoken about the Eighth Day and uh you know people's quotes are being uh taken uh I I hear I see ministers going around and just like oh my God my my my message is chopped up now but you know my message too is chopped up but we'll see how the Lord God we can't exhaust God's uh blessing see he always has something for us and the title as I said before I read the scripture that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals uh so let us read if we can I have two portions of scripture uh St John 14 I'll be reading the first four verses and also Revelations chap 21 and I think it's it fits it's very fitting for the theme that has uh been announced and we want to just stay on that line and that theme brother Jano had uh mentioned something in his testimony there's got to be a Place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we know that is a body a body has thou prepared me so there is a preparation you see so let us let us start here verse one let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me hey in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you now listen I go to prepare a place for you you see Jesus when he was walking with man could not make this preparation because the Holy Spirit had not been released but he had to go but on the day of Pentecost on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost poured out he begin his preparation he began his preparation and we have to understand his house amen this preparation we're talking about is your Tabernacle uh I go to prepare a place for you and if I go oh I love this and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way ye know next scripture verse found in Revelations chap 21 and I trust that uh I can kind of bring this across in a way that uh it had come to me because we have to understand that the Eighth Day is coming but let us look at how is written in Revelations chapter 21 and verse one now we know that we shall reign on the earth the earth as you know it today you're not going to come back to the same Earth there's got to be done something done to this earth H because then we're phasing into a new day now let's see what John says here and I saw a new Heaven ah new what happened to the old I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Earth and the first uh for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more seed and I John sold the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the temple of God is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their father and God shall oh I love this amen and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no death no sorrow no crying amen neither shall there be any more pain for the former things under the uh seventh day and all the in a a period of time our passed away amen this is the new law of the new day you see amen and he that that sat upon the throne behold uh said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful for and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto uh I will give let me see if okay I and I will give unto him that is a thirst amen of the Fountain of Water of Life and verse 7 he that overcometh shall inherit amen uh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us just bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord we have read your word dear God and I uh pray dear God that these words that would be spoken this morning Lord I pray that it would uh go forth and fall on good ground father we know that the spirit of God always follows the word dear God and I pray that only you uh we know that can make it uh H hundredfold and bring it to pass the time has come Lord is not just to preach the word we want to see the word manifested in our hearts and our lives Dear God so father I pray that you would bless each and everyone Lord for the next few minutes I pray dear God that you would uh Lord uh May every sea go forth and it find good ground in the hearts of the people we commit ourselves into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated how many are happy let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen hallelujah Glory Glory glory amen hallelujah so excuse me a second I am uh using this uh this uh Power PowerPoint and um it's just kind of not working for me a little bit but amen uh brother brandham said we have lived through seven Church ages amen and we all know that in every Church age they were Overcomers yes sir amen every Church age there were Eighth Day people amen every Church age there were e Eighth Day people that were predestinated to overcome in that age you take Paul irus Martin Columba and everything else it and down to this age and I hear sometimes so many people complain about the trials and tribulations and things that they they they think that God made a mistake in putting you here no listen I want to tell you something you're not a mistake no there is no oops with God God doesn't make mistakes oh you know amen he has Overcomers in every age Hallelujah and if he has Overcomers in every age there something to overcome that's what makes you the believer The Eighth Day believer eternal Hallelujah you come from God and you go back to God again and listen to me Hallelujah you have representation as brother uh uh Peter Chandler said you see the believer that was in God before the foundation of the world Amen uh he was Spirit man uh way back in the beginning we see and he come to Earth as Spirit man we all know those things we all know these things but then God Amen you have to come in a in a place of time because eternity is like a circle you know we all know that brother Bram said that is a circle but when sin came in it put a hickey or or or or a kink in this great circle Hallelujah and God was determined to fix this circle amen it was sin that dropped down hallelujah amen to inter to try to interrupt The Eternity but God is from eternal to Eternity to Eternity Hallelujah glory be to God so God has Overcomers in every age glory be to God Amen and they are the ones at this time and this final age will receive a Sevenfold reward amen there's no overcoming for the for for people who give up there's no overcoming amen there's no rewards for people who who who just say I cannot make it anymore oh my my my my but listen amen I want you to understand now what brother Bram says here in the seventh seal now we all know that the seven seal seven Thunder message has been unfolded and revealed by a prophet how many can say Amen to that all right but now let's let's look at what the seventh seal amen uh we know that the seventh seal had a beginning and has an end how many know that to truth the seventh seal has a beginning and it has an end brother Bram says in the seventh seal he said we must remember that the seventh seal is the End of Time Hallelujah the end of all things is that right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption amen from before the foundation of the world world Amen it all it's every bit ends see it is an end it is an end to the struggling [Music] nature amen hallelujah it is an end to a struggling nature it is an end to everything it is an end uh to the trumpets it is an end to the vows it is an end to the Earth amen thank God because God has a new Earth and a new it's the end of the Earth hallelujah amen see it's uh it's it's the end of all things time runs out the Bible said so see Revelations 10 uh uh chapter 10 and verse one and uh through 7 time runs out and the angel said there shall be time no longer Amen in the days that these great things are happening but now here is what need needs to be understood now the prophet revealed the seventh seal he revealed every mystery that's what I believe every mystery you don't have to say or you hear preachers to say well you know somebody has got to come behind come behind who on now I don't understand what you're talking about because you're not talking my language now amen I'm from I'm from the eighth day maybe uh I don't understand your language amen glory be to God Amen the prophet said Hallelujah according to the uh Revelations chapter 10 in the days of the voice when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished glory be to God and I want to say this if you can receive it I want to say this Jesus said of John now listen Jesus said of John if you can receive it he was more than a prophet you mean to tell me there was Moses and Elijah there was all kinds there was Jeremiah there was all all prophets throughout the Old Testament but Jesus himself testified amen any Prophet that for runs the coming of the Lord is more than a prophet glory be to God hallelujah what a commission what a amen what a responsibility glory be to God Amen but John listen John never said that of himself Jesus himself was testifying of John if you can receive iten Hallelujah glory be to God Amen Glory Hallelujah now I will say here today come on now if you can receive it this messenger of Malachi 4 yes he was a prophet but he was more than a [Applause] prophet if you can receive it if you can speak Eighth Day language Hallelujah more than a prophet praise God and you see throughout the internet they have criticizing their uh you know the Bible says there come a time where they will not be able to endure sound Doctrine and to endure means to hold on to Hallelujah which means that one time they had it but but you know time oh no maybe I'm going to let this go I I'm look I feel like Jacob today I'm not going to let this go until you bless me glory be to God Amen listen either this is right or it is wrong you cannot sit in the fence you've got to make up your mind Hallelujah your God will be my god when you're buried I will be buried Hallelujah glory be to God amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so brother oblo if the seventh seal is the end of all things amen why are why this and why this why are we still here why is nature still struggling why this I'm going to show you Amen brother brandom oh he doesn't leave anything unturn you know amen I like that he said he he continues to say that the seventh steel is like a rocket we we just we just celebrated the Fourth of July back uh in America and you know I was one night I was going to sleep and I hear boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and I would look out the window and brother there's all kinds of fireworks going on and you take one rock it goes up and boom it goes into 20 and and the 20 goes into 40 and the 40 goes into 80 it's still unfolding the seventh seal is still unfolding it will unfold to the coming of the Lord it will unfold Amen to the wedding supper it'll unfold Amen to the new uh hallelujah amen it'll unfold hallelujah it's still unfolding it's not done yet God is not done with you amen now let's see to to prove this point when God takes you in a rapture amen when God takes the bride to the Rapture do you think that nature is going to stop struggling no no it's still under time hallelujah oh I hope you understand this now amen that's a the seven seal it just ends of time see for the world it's the end uh of time time for this time for that see it ends the time for this it ends a time for that it's a ending of everything and everything ends at the seventh seal in other words time will be no more and the next thing is number eight because there only seven days in a week right amen and when you add one more it's eternity glory be to God remember that the Jubilee year was only uh you know seven sabbaths but they had to be add one more year glory and that was Year of Jubilee glory be to God Amen and oh I like what brother Isaac said all your task Masters and oh that made you do this and you have to do this and you have to do that oh there's coming a trumpet one and only the believer only the predestinated will be able to hear that trumpet Hallelujah glory be to God Amen Hallelujah I'm going to tell you something there some people don't want to go free they're Comfort they're comfort in in what they are now they're oh look I I can never be satisfied with what I am now amen I have no Kingdom of my own I don't build any Kingdom Lord I want to see you look upon your face amen dare to look uh Amen to be forever uh and sing forever of your Saving Grace now let me tell you something uh another quote here that statue of perfect man then we'll get into preaching uh now we are approaching the seventh seal amen we just finished the seven Church ages now this and people don't think I don't believe these things you rumors about this I mean look I've been around a long time ago and I know what I believe and I what I don't believe amen listen a and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in [Applause] ties them from s to 8 hallelujah amen glory be to God the ties a man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord and is going to be in that church age Hallelujah that Eternal Church age glory be to God oh Hallelujah at the end of the seals see Hal Hallelujah when the last uh when you get the rocket going up and it blows and blows and blows and you're wondering where's my family oh don't worry about it in one of those explosion there's your family amen hallelujah oh don't worry in one of those explosions there's a spoken word of God Amen House of Hell give way to the name of the Living God Amen don't think it's over is just getting started amen you wait till the anointing strike the Church of the Living God Hallelujah the word of God will be made manifest amen and I'm going to tell you something can I can I speak what's on my heart can I speak what's on my heart can I speak what was on my heart glory be to God people don't know what the anointing is I'm going to make it clear to you because I have scriptures and I have quotes and things amen people people fail to know what the anointing really is hallelujah brother Braham said that the greatest anointing that struck the Earth come was when Jesus walked into the temple he P picked up the Scrolls of Isaiah and he read the portion that pertained to him nobody was shouting nobody was you see people get confused with noise and think they have all that there is to have but the anointing and now listen please I'm not against shouting and glorifying God I I'm just making a point listen I want you to understand you can shout but at the end of the day you've got to understand that the anointing comes to make the word made flesh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God and he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me amen he has anointed me Hallelujah the preach to the poor and so forth amen glory be to God and he put the scroll away and brother brandham said oh you take these Pentecostals they would just love and run around that Temple and shout and speak in tongues and everything else but that was the greatest anointing the anointing comes upon the word to make it live it is the the Dynamics to our mechanics Hallelujah and brother Bram says you wait till the anointing really strike this church amen I doubt very much if it's just going to make us shout and glorify God although that is the after effects amen but we will rejoice because the word is becoming flesh hallelujah hallelujah amen glory amen listen so therefore without the statue of perfect man amen you will never make it you will never be able to uh be tied into that Eternal Church age amen and I believe the Thunders with all my heart you know why because brother brandom said it amen and I have to believe what he said amen but you see here and brother brandom says in the Seal of God he lived here once with us on Earth in the form of a man God lived in his son Christ Jesus as the God man and he returned into Glory leaving this world a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world now listen the person of the Holy Spirit returning in the form is that Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God listen he said he came out of Eternity am eternity is number eight amen he wasn't in time God was eternal and he's still Eternal amen but he had to drop into this Kink that the devil caused and through sin but here is what's so beautiful about this amen you can be seated a moment amen I come from God and I go back to God he came from eternity and stepped down into time amen went out back uh and went uh went out of time back into eternity I love that so now when Adam sinned you see in the beginning God said the day that you eat thereof you shall die the day and to God a day is a thousand years we all know that and we read in the Bible that nobody lived a thousand years Methuselah came close by he didn't but no God doesn't forget his promises you know he takes care of his promises don't worry about it hallelujah amen because he created man here to be Eternal in the beginning there was eternal Hallelujah Adam was eternal Eve was eternal they come from God and they were supposed to go back to God but Eve let down the bars unbelief came in and they caus a kink amen and that is what broke Fellowship between amen the early Adam and Eve and God but God had to fix that you know because he himself had to drop down into this little Loop Hallelujah to make sure that uh he pushes it back up back into [Applause] eternity and the reason for the Thousand-Year reign listen to me the reason for the Thousand-Year Reign is to prove that God had paid the price of restoration somebody's going to live a thousand years glory be to God Hallelujah at that wedding supper praise God oh Satan will be bound A Thousand Years we'll have no tempter then oh God takes care of his word oh Hallelujah glory be to God we would be rejoicing and of course the Great Tribulation is is taking place for three and a half years and Satan is bound and so forth but in the at the same time God oh is preparing a place for you and I listen but it won't be the heavens that we know today it won't be the Earth that we know today the Earth that we know today has water has seeds has trouble and so forth but Jesus uh but John was speaking about a new Earth for the old things has passed away glory be to God you talk about oh hallelujah amen amen see you can be seated if you can amen and we live through all these types here but when you hit the eighth number eight see you go back to Eternity you don't come from laws and rituals and orders as the brother uh already wrote amen or rather uh read you come by predestination amen I'm going to say I'm going to stop and say something here please without predestination and God is Not unfair you know he told Jeremiah before uh when you were in your mother's womb I knew you and I had ordained you to be a prophet to the [Music] Nations Hallelujah Jacob and Esa before they breathed a single breath hallah Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated hallelujah how can he do that because he knows his own God is Not unfair and I'm going to tell you the greatest Revelation that any man any Christian can have today is there true revelation of predestination Hallelujah to know that you come from God and you're going back to God again glory be to God Amen so let's take a story I've said this many times before the devil want to he's the accuser you know he's the accuser there's nobody else named accuser out outside of the devil he likes to accuse and there is no Redemption and accusation to accuse you he just wants to he's judge jury uh and he wants to just make you look bad he'll put you in the front paper and so forth that's an accuser you see but Jesus told the woman neither do I accuse you because his love was uh was a love of forgiveness and in her heart was a seed she was Ill Fame she was caught in adultery this is why I said don't we don't have the ability to judge any man anybody we don't have the ability to judge any person right the only reason God's judgment are true and they are pure and they are final is because he knows all things you present your case to a jury and all of you trying to get is some evidence evidence something um DNA anything amen and sometimes you get a bunch of it and sometimes you get a little bit of it but then you go to court amen and it's the proof amen that you present whether that case uh is is ruled for you or against you that's right amen but [Applause] [Music] God God knows all things amen but God knows all things and that's how he could judge and this is why he before uh Jacob and Esau lived one day he knew he knew that hallelujah oh that uh amen Jacob would have respect unto the birth right amen oh and everything that Jas that's the only thing he wanted amen was that Birthright but Esau he made light of it let us never make light of our Birthright uh this is the Holy Ghost it is your Birthright never make light of adoption never make light of perfection never make light this is your inheritance glory be to God hallelujah Glory oh praise be to God but when you're predestinated now the AC the accuser let's get back to the accuser oh you did this you did that to be predestinated means to be way back before before there was a star before there was a moon before there was an earth before there was anything an Adam before there was anything moving you were in the back part of God's mind and listen I want to tell you that he did not think of you in your condition now because he doesn't think incomplete thoughts now he saw you as a perfect amen image just like him casing out Devils uh Healing The Sick preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen standing for this message glory be to God Amen that's how he saw you amen and this is why when the devil said y you're not that well listen Devil he's still working on me don't worry about it don't worry you just hang around a little bit hang around a little while and you'll see he'll keep his word oh you're not in the book you're not in the book or what do you mean you're not in the book you know the devil don't even know whether you're in the book or not because because when the book was written he was even he wasn't even in existence so what he is doing he is guessing he is trying to make you doubt that you're in the book so you have to challenge your devil and say okay devil let's go back let's go back you want to take me back 5 years no no no no that's not enough let's go back 20 and 30 and 30 and then way before there was a star there was a moon way before where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning Stars sang together I was there Hallelujah that's why job one day oh when he got the re ation amen the devil took everything from him he took his family he took his wealth he took everything but oh one day God had a real man-to-man talk with with job get up job get up stop complaining speak to me like a man oh Hallelujah I like rug rugged talk with the Lord speak to me like a man where was thou when I lay the foundation of the world and when job got a revelation and he saw himself way before the beginning he said I know my My Redeemer liveth the hey Hallelujah the lord taketh and he giveth uh he taketh away blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord cuz the devil thought that he was only serving God because he was being materially blessed oh Hallelujah the lord giveth and he taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm going to tell you something this preacher you're seeing today it doesn't matter if I have a car or home it doesn't matter if I have whatever it is it doesn't matter if I have just dust in my pocket amen I know my redeemer living hallelujah praise be to God Amen you've got to have a fixed Faith let's continue amen you may be seated oh I love that amen now you want to know what you're called to amen there is a genuine holy convocation and we're entering into the seventh Church age the church age of Pentecostal age do you see it we've ENT entering uh uh We've enter we're entering in that Holy convocation we're entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called you're not called to a church you're not called to a denomination you're not called to a group our calling is to the Eighth Day Eternal convocation amen but into eternity amen with their Eternal King I'm going to tell you something about this with their Eternal King one day Mo uh rather Abraham amen after the battle of the Kings amen hallelujah he met a man that was called MDC oh Hallelujah and you know something about mzc and you know uh this is why brother brandom uh spoke a mystery that was a mystery you know amen who was this mzc oh my they tried to they tried to look for record of his existence on now where do you come from who is your mama where you appeared but the Bible says he had no beginning he had no win Hallelujah and he was the king of Salem no record Hallelujah I don't care what records they keep in time here I'm only interested in the record that he keeps up there hallelujah amen glory be to God Amen you come from God and you go back to God again and Abraham PID tith to this MDC amen and after a while he disappeared amen he stepped out of Eternity amen and went back to Eternity and he left no record oh oh hallelujah amen glory be to God oh Hallelujah glory be to God he was King MDC amen king of Salem amen let's let's look at another quote here just a moment amen see as as I said uh eternity is like a circle let's get back to that we all come down we are Eternal when the Holy Spirit comes into your heart and brother BR said that's the only way we can get back to Eternity because the Holy Ghost is eternal and you know what it it's called Zoe the very life of God the very person of God listen man I'm not just looking for blessing I'm looking for the person of [Music] [Applause] God hallelujah he dropped down in time but during that time he had to put blood across the uh Chasm there across the the whole length of timeall to redeem it to push it back up amen Jesus was uh when he come in a flesh amen and dropped into time it did not stop him from being Eternal no but he just come down into time now he didn't come into time just to just pay us a visit he came into time to redeem those that have fallen into this little Loop Hallelujah glory be to God and to redeem all those amen hallelujah and to bring it back up not for everybody but for the elected predestinated seat of God before the foundation of the world Jesus said I don't pray for the world but I pray for those that God has given me glory be to God hallelujah he had a mission he had a purpose he had a amen you come from God and you go back to God again glory be to God amen glory so therefore the chain amen this little loophole was was broken but he come down to redeem amen oh that was in that uh amen so he come from eternity listen to me he come Jesus come from eternity and stepped into a space of time and he come amen and made a flesh amen and through here in the order Sanctified uh and and a streak of blood went across this place to redeem it and to connect it back to God again all for the uh eternity do you see that amen so therefore he come in a step uh and step into this body of time could you imagine Hallelujah the god of Glory he's Eternal he steps into time he puts on a body he was the mystery of God revealed because all that God was he poured into Jesus [Applause] Christ hallelujah hallelujah he was the mystery of God revealed Hallelujah and the church has got to be the mystery of Christ revealed the world wants to see Jesus the world is Longing To See Jesus where will they find him it's a Jesus in you and I don't exp don't expect the world to understand you you are a mystery to them Hallelujah just like Jesus was a mystery to the to to his age now if this God of Glory you would expect him to have stadiums of followers he healed the sick he raised the dead he did every all the sign of the Messiah he manifested God in human skin why because eternity was in him the flesh was just time hallelujah amen this is why I have to tell you you haven't seen me yet I haven't seen you I see your flesh glory be to God but in you Hallelujah the real you oh the real you let me say it again the real you I see your flesh I see you in a suit I see you uh walking around in a dress whatever but I haven't seen you glory be to God Amen the real you amen comes from God and goes back to God again you don't know me I don't know you amen of course we know each other before the foundation of the world but listen uh the the world will never understand you so don't expect the world to understand you now uh okay this is my time can can you give me just 15 minutes is that okay brother the just okay preach on okay I have to stop here but just I just want to get to a point here see notice it is also uh upon the Eighth Day the last day of the the feast see the Tabernacle notice after that uh after the last Feast after the last Church age after the last completed uh seventh day upon the Earth after the Millennium after the Millennium that uh this holy convocation comes oh so we have to understand this Eighth Day I'm so happy right you see because was brother Bram said we're still worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles all the way through the Millennium that's gospel that's right but the Eighth Day you see because there's still time a thousand years are alloted there's still time amen but when the seventh seal pops his last uh explosion time will be no more it's the end of the world it's the end of a struggling nature is the end of all things that we know it today we know that when we go in the Millennium praise God and to the wedding supper and have a millennial rain is still under time because God wants to prove that God promise that you will live A Thousand Years he keeps his promises oh but after that I John saw the New Jerusalem coming down for the old Earth had passed away glory be to God the old Earth has passed away no more water not even Sun necessary because he was the light of the new city Hallelujah to the lamb amen you talk about a representation hallah oh Hallelujah that's where we come from amen see remember this is a Feast of Tabernacles this is what I was saying Gathering a place see amen where in the Millennium the Bible says they build houses and they shall inhabit of course there'll be peace but Satan will be bound what for still time [Laughter] time oh Hallelujah GL but I'm going to I'm going to close with this like brother Isaac said amen you know we're coming back and we shall reain on the earth on a new Earth not the filthy one we see today because the old Earth and the old Heaven has passed away it has served his time oh yes Hallelujah but this new Earth this new heaven amen is for Eighth Day people this New Jerusalem has a they lost hallu hallelujah amen you see in this seventh day we have pains and we have trials and we have this oh you see and then they say uh you go to the doctor and so forth you call it all kinds of names but brother BR said it's just a demon you can call it cancer it's still a demon amen but Satan will be bound a thousand years and at the end we come back after the Millennium the new landlords hallelujah king and queen Mrs Jesus Christ and we shall judge the Earth Hallelujah the books were open Hallelujah listen to me the books was open but I'm so thankful that the redeemed of God their names have been transferred to the Lamb's Book of Life where our wedding certificate [Music] is that's why we can stand up as bride because we have a wedding certificate oh the devil said oh I remember you did this okay let's play the tape blood red I never did it in the first place glory be to God he that's born again cannot sin glory be to God and sin is unbelief I

H glory be to God Amen who can lay anything to go God's elect it is God that justifieth praise God for I am persuaded that neither life nor death shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord we come from God and we go back to God you've got to believe that you've got to exercise that you've got to confess that glory be to God amen glory be to God Amen if it's that if that's not your confession I feel sorry for you you're not going to make it you better know who you are you better know where you stand glory be to God Amen oh amen never did it in the first place glory be to God hallelujah you know what I like here here's what I like there's a quote that brother brandham said my lordes that every sin has got to be judged we all know that I hope you I hope I hope you you're in the message now every every sin has got to be judged he said uh but when we make mistakes and we sin not willingly that sin still has to be judged he said but when it's put under the blood of Jesus Christ Glory Glory that sin is broken downall is broken down the chemistry chemistry of that sin is broken down and this is a good thing that I like Glory Hallelujah the prophet say he sends it back to the one who made you do it Hallelujah glory be to God Amen who can lay anything to God's elect amen Satan you're going to be judged amen glory be to God we are in that Eternal Church age or we're getting into that Eternal Church age glory be to God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen glory GL amen glory hallelujah amen God bless your heart amen listen what brother

songs amen amen amen listen oh my the seven wonders he of Revelations uh of Revelations may he show the bride how to prepare for great translation Faith so the revelation of the seven Thunders is to show the bride but the seven Thunders is not going to prepare you listen to me because the bride in Revelation says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him because the bride has made herself ready so you understand you can see it you can you can be shown it but you've got to get it into action and I'm going to close with this I am tired of sermons I'm tired of sermons I'm tired of the you know people telling you what to do and they don't do it themselves they tell you to love one another and they hate each you they hate you come on now the time has come amen if he has shown us how to prepare let us start to prepare because no matter how much God prepared Noah and gave him the instructions for the ark one day he had to get started he couldn't permit God to build the ark he had to you know and that's what shook the the the people around when they got when he got into action you see because at first it was a message next it was action amen this man is really building this Ark that that Ark shook them because he was putting his message into action Glory Hallelujah the time has come listen talk is cheap let us live our message that's the Thunder that shakes the devil all the time and I'm so proud to still be identified with the same kind of people same kind of group Eighth Day people amen glory be to God listen you can't preach this to somebody 7 day they're just
