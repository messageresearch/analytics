[23:44] I wanna read Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 it
[23:49] again equally Isis 11 if you're writing
[23:51] it down 4 to 6 Isaiah 55 60 11 and
[23:56] Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 acquiesce is 11 who
[24:06] is for he that observed the windin shall
[24:10] not sue and he had regarded the clothes
[24:14] shall not reap as don't know it's not
[24:18] what is the way of the Spirit know how
[24:23] the bones do grow in the womb of her
[24:25] that is with child
[24:27] even so don't know it's not the works of
[24:29] God who make it oil in the morning so
[24:33] dicey and in the evening with hole not
[24:36] in hand for thou knowest not whether
[24:39] shall prosper either this or that or
[24:42] whether they would be both shall be
[24:44] alike good Isaiah chapter 55 reading
[24:49] from verse 6 iike the Lord while he may
[24:52] be found call upon him while he is near
[24:55] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[24:58] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[25:00] return unto the Lord and He will have
[25:02] mercy upon him under our God for he will
[25:06] abundantly pardon for my torts are not
[25:09] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[25:11] ways saith the Lord for as the heavens
[25:14] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[25:17] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[25:19] than your tours for as the rain come at
[25:23] dawn and the snow from heaven and return
[25:26] it not thither but water ready it and
[25:28] make it at bring forth and bud that is
[25:31] made brief seated a sewer and bread to
[25:33] the eater so shall my word be that goeth
[25:36] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[25:39] return unto me void but it shall
[25:41] accomplish that which I please and it
[25:44] shall prosper in the thing wherein - I
[25:47] sent it
[25:49] another scripture from Ezekiel chapter
[25:52] 12
[25:53] reading from verse 21 and the word of
[26:02] the Lord came unto me saying son of man
[26:05] what is that proverb that you have in
[26:08] the land of Israel
[26:10] seeing the days are prolonged and every
[26:13] vision feel it tell them therefore thus
[26:17] saith the Lord God I will make this
[26:19] provoke to cease they shall no more use
[26:23] it as a proverb in Israel but say unto
[26:26] them the days are at hand and the effect
[26:30] of every vision for there shall be no
[26:33] more vain visions of flattering
[26:36] designations praise God hallelujah
[26:40] blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia
[26:43] praise be to Jesus there shall be no
[26:50] tell them for there shall be no more
[26:52] vain vision of flattering definition
[26:54] within the house of Israel for I am the
[26:56] Lord I will speak on the word that I
[27:00] shall speak
[27:02] it shall be prolong it shall be no more
[27:05] prolonged for ended in your deeds or
[27:07] rebellious hosts will I see the word and
[27:10] will perform it see it the Lord God
[27:14] again the word of the Lord came to me
[27:15] saying son of man behold day of the
[27:18] house of Israel see the vision that we
[27:20] see it is for many days to come
[27:22] and it prophesied of times that are far
[27:25] off therefore see unto them thus saith
[27:28] the Lord God they shall none of my will
[27:30] be prolong any more but the word which I
[27:33] have spoken shall be done see the
[27:36] lawless ballheads Heavenly Father we
[27:37] thank you for your word and we thank you
[27:39] for the inspiration here we target for
[27:42] your people and your manservants Lord I
[27:44] hear and come by the churches Lord may
[27:47] empower us to go as the laborers in your
[27:50] field and this time of harvest take me
[27:53] out to the wait tonight I may be
[27:55] glorified in our midst confirm your word
[27:57] with signs and wonders and miracles we
[27:59] ask in Jesus name Amen and amen so god
[28:03] bless you may be seated
[28:04] and I've been your greetings and my wife
[28:06] and they had some time and I got back
[28:07] home in Trinidad we're certainly glad to
[28:09] be here and all those fellow laborers
[28:12] here was minister of the gospel we had
[28:14] to put our shoulder to the wheel that we
[28:17] could press on towards the coming of the
[28:18] Lord
[28:18] our contact Scripture like to read it
[28:21] off define it it's on first Corinthians
[28:22] 347 and Paul was saying for one said I
[28:26] am of Paul another I am of apollos are
[28:29] we not carnal who then is Paul who is
[28:31] Apollo's but ministers by whom he
[28:34] believed even as the Lord give to every
[28:36] man I have planted Apollo's watered but
[28:39] God gives the increase so then neither
[28:41] is he that planted anything near the sea
[28:43] that watered but God that gave the
[28:46] increase
[28:46] today my context capitalist tonight and
[28:49] if a title so shall my word be that
[28:52] goeth forth out of my mouth as the title
[28:55] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[28:57] of my mouth and have a subject one so it
[29:00] another water--it but God gave the
[29:03] increase or praise the name of the Lord
[29:05] so we're looking forward to see what the
[29:07] Lord will not do tonight amen praise God
[29:10] I love the inspiration they that sow in
[29:12] tears shall reap in joy
[29:15] and I put some time on that that was
[29:17] like a burden in my heart to bring to
[29:19] the people you have to beat reveal you
[29:21] have to be a groaning you have to be at
[29:23] revealing you have to be a crying and
[29:25] sign the message has become very
[29:27] comfortable the message have become very
[29:30] flat where people are satisfied to know
[29:33] that they believe a prophet and there
[29:34] are books and tapes and it will Brown
[29:36] message no that's not the message you
[29:37] know your fire coming your your
[29:41] challenges is coming but a Branham out
[29:44] to face his own and so with the bride
[29:45] he said I'd rather be a hunted
[29:47] persecuted group or say I mean better
[29:50] over we're not going to sit down on a
[29:51] church bench I'm just gonna rupture no
[29:54] that's not happening that is not going
[29:56] to happen
[29:56] Oh glory to God the bride will go to a
[29:59] rough time or glory to God but we have a
[30:02] word from the Lord
[30:03] break that his wood will not return void
[30:06] everything spoken about the bride will
[30:08] come to pass it has nothing to do with
[30:10] your feelings there's nothing to do with
[30:12] your emotions it have to do with word
[30:14] court have said or glory to God it has
[30:17] what to do what God have said and one
[30:20] time a prophet hadn't got angry and
[30:22] upset Elijah and my god want to know
[30:25] what's the word for the Lord what is
[30:27] word of the Lord and he said bringing me
[30:29] a minstrel because he in an upset mode
[30:31] and once there's a upset it has to have
[30:34] an atmosphere to bring the prophet in
[30:36] the spirit so he get the right singing
[30:39] and the music he said does hear the Lord
[30:42] dig me a valley full of ditches you
[30:45] wouldn't see win praise God he wouldn't
[30:47] he'll win you wouldn't see rain but
[30:50] water going to come out and and ditches
[30:52] don't go by your feelings don't buy
[30:55] emotions don't buy your feeling tonight
[30:57] Oh glory to God hallelujah and that's
[31:01] why we had that scripture he that
[31:03] regardeth the will shall not sow we
[31:05] refuse the conditions are on us we
[31:09] refuse to accept what does are on us
[31:11] we're going to do what we have to do
[31:14] speak what have to be spoken and it
[31:18] shall surely come to pass we believe
[31:20] that even you will be seated oh praise
[31:23] God so brother Branham in Revelation
[31:26] chapter 4
[31:27] he was talking about the cherubims had a
[31:28] Freeman sword the Garden of Eden to keep
[31:31] the tree of the Tree of Life
[31:33] there was a Garden of Eden and this is
[31:36] the Cape right here swings out at the
[31:38] gate there was turbans
[31:40] it said cherubims and there was a god
[31:42] the way of the Tree of Life he said who
[31:46] is the way Jesus they kept the Tree of
[31:49] Life and gathered it the way of life now
[31:53] you must remember that there was an
[31:55] altar at the Garden of Eden
[31:56] it's an altar this must have been an
[31:59] altar at the Garden of Eden I will tell
[32:02] you why you remember Cain and Abel came
[32:04] to worship so that shows that God's
[32:06] altar was moved and set there at the
[32:09] Garden of Eden and the only way back to
[32:12] Eden is by the altar the only way back
[32:16] to Eden is true the altar so the way
[32:18] back to Eden is by the altar and through
[32:21] the altar and that altar had to be
[32:24] covered with blood he say all kind of
[32:26] people see it nothing but the blood they
[32:29] had to be an atonement they had to be a
[32:31] mercy seat this is the author of
[32:33] judgment that must become a mercy seat
[32:36] God in this gate so Cain went out of the
[32:40] presence of the Lord from the gate at
[32:42] the garden so the presence of the Lord
[32:45] must have been by the altar or glory
[32:48] their God where I guess in the presence
[32:49] of the Lord right by the altar and the
[32:52] altar was at the gate and it's coach
[32:55] dwelling place and Kim went out from the
[32:58] presence of the Lord from this place
[33:01] no God told Moses make everything on
[33:04] earth as a pattern after heaven so any
[33:06] may make that let's continue and when he
[33:09] did he made the Ark of the Covenant and
[33:12] put two cherubim cigar diac so he put
[33:15] two turbines like that he made cherubims
[33:18] representing the guards scene in heaven
[33:20] isn't that something there that God the
[33:23] mercy seat where God energy kind of
[33:26] glory where is the Shekinah glory at the
[33:29] mercy seat at the mercy seat is right
[33:32] the god that she kind of glory that
[33:35] there's a but I want to get to then it
[33:38] goes to show that every Scalia
[33:40] work cannot come in and take of that you
[33:44] have to be prepared before you come into
[33:48] the presence of it or glory to court do
[33:53] you get that tonight not any scallywag
[33:56] will access this presence
[33:59] so therefore the presence of God must be
[34:02] accessed you could read the books you
[34:05] could listen to the tapes but you have
[34:07] to be given access or glory to God
[34:11] because this presence is guarded Oh
[34:13] plural of God hallelujah glory to God
[34:17] amen
[34:18] the buff is in the mind but when that
[34:21] presence come into your heart it is
[34:23] settled the battle is over
[34:25] Oh glory to God once that's hip dropping
[34:28] in your soul your puffle is over that's
[34:32] like more they could tell the people the
[34:34] Egyptians you see today you shall see
[34:38] them no more forever the battle was over
[34:41] or glory Liguria man so you must be
[34:52] given access to the presence of God and
[34:56] right now his debt to be O sight of his
[34:59] presence Oh glory to God let's continue
[35:02] are you ready Israel was free from
[35:06] Pharaoh when they left Egypt the enemy
[35:10] Den was the system the enemy was he was
[35:13] Kingdom the enemy was external you could
[35:17] point to it you could talk about it
[35:20] because it is external you could discuss
[35:23] it you could share it with others
[35:25] hallelujah your enemy though excuses why
[35:31] it is justified what you do why you do
[35:34] it justified in your own mind they had
[35:38] an external enemy they were free from
[35:41] Pharaoh but were they free from
[35:43] themselves
[35:46] hallelujah
[35:48] that is my easy to point outside people
[35:51] as the enemy it easy to look at external
[35:54] enemies and external and this one add up
[35:56] 1 and up 1 and up 1 but they were free
[35:59] from 0 but there wasn't free from
[36:01] themselves a bigger past was coming it
[36:04] was not Pharaoh test it was that same
[36:07] self that put self all glory to God that
[36:13] message self or do I am still the truth
[36:20] the truth and the truth will set you
[36:24] free or glory to God hallelujah glory to
[36:28] God
[36:29] freedom carries a responsibility and an
[36:34] accountability but freedom you could lie
[36:37] you could cheat you could be underhand
[36:40] you could cut off for us you could
[36:42] create your own club to love your own
[36:44] Harley or care about your circle or your
[36:47] circle of family or friends and
[36:48] associate the wilderness Chile expose
[36:52] that they were free from Pharaoh but not
[36:54] for themselves and then first
[36:56] Corinthians tell us they were all
[36:58] baptized under Moses in the cloud in the
[37:00] sea they eat and drink of the same water
[37:03] and these things happen for examples to
[37:06] the intent you see the people and the
[37:08] message thing that they get away from
[37:09] everything because they are in the
[37:11] message listen it's not like that you
[37:14] know don't have a God of your own
[37:16] imagination you know you have to have a
[37:18] core of the word let me say it again
[37:20] don't have a God don't make your own
[37:22] garden you see like how better than and
[37:24] I talk about it having a God for this
[37:26] and you're carrying your own God don't
[37:27] do that
[37:28] this is the corner of the word the same
[37:30] people that God call out he killed this
[37:33] same people that he called out he
[37:35] destroy don't just say you're called
[37:38] many a call
[37:44] let me say that again many are called
[37:46] but few are chosen you want to be one of
[37:50] the chosen ones Oh glory to God
[37:53] hallelujah praise God may be seated
[37:56] leader these things will happen for
[37:59] examples to the intent we should not
[38:02] lust as after evil things as they lusted
[38:05] neither be the idolaters and some of
[38:07] them as written the people sat down to
[38:09] eat and drink and plain neither let us
[38:11] commit fornication as some of them
[38:13] committed under in one day three and
[38:15] twenty thousand near let us tempt Christ
[38:17] as some of them tempted and were
[38:19] destroyed of serpents need a murmur ye
[38:22] as some of them murmured or Gloria I was
[38:25] destroyed by destroy destroy all these
[38:28] things happen unto them therefore the
[38:31] examples that they are written for our
[38:33] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[38:36] world are come wherefore let him that
[38:39] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[38:42] fall Oh glory to God hallelujah
[38:46] they had no temptation taken you but
[38:48] such as common to man but God is
[38:50] faithful who will not that you suffer to
[38:54] be tempted above what you're able to
[38:55] bear but with that temptation make a way
[38:59] for you to escape it
[39:00] Oh glory to God you love him tonight Oh
[39:03] glory to God this is the message this is
[39:07] the word hallelujah hallelujah there is
[39:12] no free ride or Gloria what is the price
[39:16] to leave from Egypt to go into the
[39:20] Promised Land
[39:21] Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[39:24] hallelu may be seated
[39:26] glory to God hallelujah different colin
[39:29] is without repentance you can't make
[39:33] yourself something you are not but if
[39:35] God calls you you be the most thankful
[39:38] person in the world because he has
[39:41] called you then it becomes real to you
[39:44] or glory to God what attracts the Holy
[39:47] Ghost the character in you or glory to
[39:51] God hallelujah hallelujah your power
[39:55] must be from the source not the gift or
[39:59] glory to God it could have musical gift
[40:02] of play piano and play guitar and sing
[40:04] and everything else that forgived
[40:06] God give you a gift it could be raw
[40:09] talent playing the piano but if the
[40:11] piano player
[40:13] it's connected a source it's more than
[40:16] your talent
[40:17] it's the anointing Jim it's the Spirit
[40:20] of God or glory to God you can ever give
[40:24] the scene that's your gift that's your
[40:27] voice but if you cannot give get a power
[40:31] source the Holy Spirit going to anoint
[40:34] you and take it to another level
[40:37] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah

[40:52] exhortation become inspired everything
[40:55] you do become inspired or glory to go on
[40:57] the devil knows it because you are
[41:00] inspired

[54:24] William Branham he was guts enter reach
[54:26] the entire seat think about a Peter
[54:27] Chandler from Genesis to Revelation the
[54:30] seed of the entire Bible so the entire
[54:32] bed would have to be new and I support
[54:34] up to wrap the entire vibe as a seed and
[54:36] put it inside you and I so God put that
[54:39] seed like a miracle under the Seventh
[54:41] Seal put seven thunders under there and
[54:43] tied it right up inside of that on the
[54:45] nail not a devil will know nothing about
[54:47] it
[54:48] silence put the seed inside of you and
[54:51] the devil don't know what's inside of
[54:53] you because he can't discern ad hoc or
[54:56] the thoughts inside aha so what put his
[54:59] seed inside of your heart no the devil
[55:01] can't get inside idea to mess with that
[55:03] seed or glory to God out see this
[55:06] original that see this pure all glory to

[55:32] nothing is wrong with this message
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:41] that's why maybe Caesar don't like
[55:44] policy once I'm Apollo's I'm appalled
[55:47] and this ECI Scannell its flesh inside
[55:50] the way man getting in front ago to me
[55:53] affecting the flow of things and then he
[55:56] said one show one reap but one show on
[55:59] water but quad give the increase God is
[56:02] who want to bring the increase but
[56:04] somebody after soul and somebody after
[56:07] water if your so our seniors have tap
[56:09] water to bring it forward let's continue
[56:11] the Spirit of God comes forward to water
[56:14] the seed at this back up a bit you may
[56:16] be seated
[56:16] they don't smoke what is your own seed
[56:19] Jesus is the word of God and he was
[56:22] busted open the life is inside the seed
[56:27] and this life which is the spirit was
[56:32] water flowing over the spirit over the
[56:35] seed of God will bring forth the light
[56:36] of the seed and it bring forth something
[56:39] else there is some kind of seed there do
[56:42] you understand if the Spirit of God
[56:45] comes forth to water the seed if it see
[56:49] it is watering it reproduces the life of
[56:52] the sea so when Jesus died water was
[56:56] released which the spirit was released
[56:59] because seeds were coming and that water
[57:03] of release is to come to your seed so
[57:06] right now you haven't manifested what
[57:07] they're supposed to yet because you're
[57:10] waiting for the water to come to your
[57:13] sea and every seed will be for after its
[57:17] kind Oh glory to God so he said I
[57:21] believe the Bible is the whole truth and
[57:23] Jesus the word made manifest he was that
[57:27] seed that Eve should have produced he
[57:31] was the sea that Eve was to produce but
[57:34] she hybrid it by disbelieve in God's
[57:36] Word so he was the seed and the only way
[57:40] that life could be reproduction of life
[57:44] life had to come to that seed and in
[57:47] order to spread out the life can't you
[57:49] see it that is why the water was given
[57:52] water deceit the holy spirit that was in
[57:55] the Garden of Eden was the water the
[57:57] seed and that's what we will fight the
[57:59] holy spirit on the devil would fight the
[58:00] holy spirit and fight the atmosphere and
[58:02] fight the worship and have it on the
[58:03] connor intellectual just talk and talk
[58:06] and killing time with no atmosphere and
[58:08] the atmosphere made the difference
[58:10] that's why you come to create an
[58:11] atmosphere
[58:12] he said no minister grabbing a revival
[58:14] if the minister's can bring revival we
[58:16] should have it a long time ago he said
[58:17] every five I'll have to come by the
[58:18] people you have to bring revival from
[58:21] when you're home some in your lives and
[58:23] when you come and understand by
[58:24] revelation and inspiration that you have
[58:27] to bring the revival not only that you
[58:29] said God is written for the people to
[58:31] call upon God to get his servants into

[1:08:27] Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah poor
[1:08:31] glory to God
[1:08:32] just a little more oh my this one this
[1:08:40] one is something special to me once I
[1:08:42] remember he may be seated
[1:08:43] I remember still a year and six months
[1:08:44] in the book of Revelation and that is
[1:08:47] what I been teaching I love I just love
[1:08:50] teaching I think it's wonderful it gives
[1:08:52] the basis and settles the church know in
[1:08:56] preaching now there are some people are
[1:08:58] apprecia they can pick up the word with
[1:09:01] inspiration and sweet audiences that is
[1:09:06] watering the seeds that the teacher has
[1:09:10] taught
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:14] they're not soup so if we don't have an
[1:09:22] understanding of how the gifts operate
[1:09:24] we could mystic things so the teacher
[1:09:28] brings the seed and a lot of people like
[1:09:30] the boss and said you know the teacher
[1:09:33] positionally pleases you Coburn said
[1:09:36] that and the preacher the Evangelist is
[1:09:39] preached you're mine or something like
[1:09:40] that so they're making mockery in front
[1:09:42] of preachers and they have an affinity
[1:09:44] and a cruces that I want to teach us but
[1:09:46] my question is what are you being
[1:09:49] pleased for if the teacher is placing
[1:09:53] you and I then you have to be placed for
[1:09:56] to receive power not placed place that's
[1:10:00] why some of them sit in church so that
[1:10:01] night not the place the teachers need
[1:10:05] them into the place they can't move
[1:10:07] right now the taking notes in there
[1:10:09] please when they're supposed to listen
[1:10:11] to tape for my right and OSA and worship
[1:10:12] God and create the atmosphere get place
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:27] we had fifty years of work mystery
[1:10:32] mystery mystery mystery si si si
[1:10:35] where are the preachers to bring the
[1:10:37] water to the very seed one soul but God
[1:10:49] gonna give the increase my my my a
[1:11:00] little you may be seated
[1:11:02] I'm not brethren who like to see Baran
[1:11:05] say and he's almost like a mockery he's
[1:11:08] a he's a very forceful speaker and he
[1:11:11] just rocked back on a soft and a
[1:11:13] teaching and a teaching but when when a
[1:11:15] preacher come
[1:11:16] he's a very forceful you know but Rama
[1:11:18] wasn't like that
[1:11:19] good he was the Prophet yeah yeah oh
[1:11:25] watch it prophets prophesy let's
[1:11:26] continue an impression there are some
[1:11:28] people that are preachers they can pick
[1:11:30] up the word with inspiration and suite
[1:11:32] out there in places that's water in the
[1:11:34] seas that the teacher has taught now you
[1:11:38] got to put some Syrian first and then
[1:11:41] water it and the watering comes from the
[1:11:45] preaching of the word I want to hear
[1:11:50] bigger than that because if you want I
[1:11:54] could come back and teach you know I can
[1:11:59] rock back and teach teach or preach
[1:12:03] alright here we go
[1:12:05] I just teasin now watch there's a vast
[1:12:08] difference between a teacher and a
[1:12:11] preacher it is two different gifts of
[1:12:16] the Spirit altogether and as I humbly
[1:12:19] say this I have a gift of either he was
[1:12:23] a prophet he said no preacher I have no
[1:12:27] teacher but he he don't have the gift of
[1:12:29] either by two different gifts so do we
[1:12:31] get at church Mary's belief and I
[1:12:34] believe you notice one know Mary could
[1:12:36] have waited till she had some kind of
[1:12:37] sign
[1:12:38] that she was going to be mother and you
[1:12:40] could read after the meeting is over
[1:12:42] until you feel that you could move your
[1:12:44] crippled leg or a little better you
[1:12:46] could hear or that deaf air or cancer
[1:12:49] seemed to be it wasn't burn you so much
[1:12:50] that is not taking God at His Word to
[1:12:54] take God at His Word is the hairs word
[1:12:57] accepted and stop rejoicing in it
[1:13:01] your rejoice is evidence that you have
[1:13:04] to take one of this world
[1:13:06] because faith is the substance of what
[1:13:08] you open for it's the evidence of what
[1:13:11] you have not seen so once I receive it
[1:13:13] because a hallelujah thank you Lord have
[1:13:15] a healing me tonight thank every
[1:13:17] literally tonight glory hallelujah I'm
[1:13:22] somebody next to you don't know why you

[1:13:58] that's not taking Gordon's word to take
[1:13:59] out of this word is a hear his word
[1:14:01] accept it on some free choice Internet
[1:14:03] we can see five hundred rush to the
[1:14:06] altar tonight which would be a good sign
[1:14:08] that Rivera's gonna break we don't have
[1:14:10] to have family altar we just to take
[1:14:12] God's word for it start with Jason and
[1:14:15] something will happen

[1:14:32] preacher water and you water also
[1:14:35] [Applause]

[1:14:40] 5 all in heaven all my dreams could do

[1:14:49] Revelation 5 when the lamb took the book
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:15:00] yeah the forgive me human be seated I
[1:15:02] could never understand churches that
[1:15:05] claim to believe but a Branham on the
[1:15:07] Seas and so on and the can worship and
[1:15:09] John types the bride I'm John was
[1:15:12] weeping he was saved he was an optimist

[1:16:16] and you come and in spirit you lay hands
[1:16:19] upon them something began to move that's
[1:16:23] something different so when Jesus told
[1:16:26] them bye-bye and they went in the upper
