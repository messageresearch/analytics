[0:00] people looking depressed.
[0:02] That's the worst
[0:03] &gt;&gt; in this message.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Preaching and people looking depressed.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; How many people look depressed?
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Read what the Bible say, rejoice.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they were in the upper
[0:13] room praising and blessing God
[0:14] continually.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; When the wise men saw this, they rejoice
[0:20] with Bible scripture with exceeding
[0:22] great joy.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; They not normal smiling signing, you
[0:26] know. They not that exceeding great joy.
[0:31] What God doing? He's roughing you up.
[0:33] Let your rejoice be it happen. Let your
[0:36] shout be happen. You're not waiting to
[0:38] get a breakthrough to shout. You're
[0:40] getting your shout now. You shout and
[0:42] your breakthrough coming after. You
[0:44] shout your healing coming after you.
[0:46] Praise God. And you
[0:55] Hallelujah.
[0:57] All right, let's go. So Job now the only
[1:00] thing had to happen for was for
[1:01] inspiration to strike him.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; So these guys were positioning place and
[1:05] ready for the anointing to strike him.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; When he strike him so they could speak,
[1:09] right?
[1:09] &gt;&gt; That's the church. Here we go.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; If it's in order.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, the church have to come in order.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't hear much about that, but
[1:18] that is in the word. The church itself
[1:21] have to come into order.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; What order? Man's order or God's order?
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Order.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; In God's order. He said what? Watch. If
[1:28] it's if it's in order, it got the
[1:30] mechanics ready.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; It only need the dynamics.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Then he said this tonight, if we could
[1:37] get the mechanics ready,
[1:39] &gt;&gt; get our hearts right.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; So that the mechanics then,
[1:46] &gt;&gt; yes, not just text and mystery and words
[1:49] and quotes. No, get your heart right.
[1:52] There we go. The things that we can do
[1:57] &gt;&gt; and the things that you can do is the
[1:59] labor part,
[2:00] &gt;&gt; is the sanctification part, is the
[2:03] working part,
[2:05] &gt;&gt; is the hard part, is the grinding part.
[2:09] That is what you could do because you
[2:12] cannot produce dynamics.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach back to me. Preach back
[2:16] to somebody.
[2:19] Let's go a little deeper here. Watch
[2:21] this. Follow him. What? Follow him in
[2:24] baptism. Follow him in every order he
[2:26] told us to do. Get every mechanic ready
[2:29] and stand there.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Then we are ready for dynamics
[2:34] &gt;&gt; to be lit off.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; How you ready for dynamics and you order
[2:37] against somebody
[2:40] &gt;&gt; that can't work.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; You have condemning you.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; You know you have a hindrance. You know
[2:44] you have some obstacle inside your life.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; You have to be clear
[2:47] &gt;&gt; about your own objective motive desires
[2:49] and everything else.
[2:53] Look at those brothers. When say have
[2:55] oil somewhere
[2:57] &gt;&gt; and then brother said around if we get
[2:59] tell us where he said we can't use the
[3:00] gift of commercial.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; You see if we get we go do this for the
[3:04] Lord and that for the Lord.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; All right. He went and after they get a
[3:08] little oil what for the Lord?
[3:12] &gt;&gt; None for the Lord.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; They gone only to find out they get it
[3:15] dripping
[3:17] &gt;&gt; and it drop after a while.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; See God was testing them. They say they
[3:21] say with the mouth they do for the lord
[3:23] and when things people say you know when
[3:25] they get a bless they can do that for
[3:26] the lord which lord
[3:28] &gt;&gt; they are the lord
[3:30] &gt;&gt; they serve their own self
[3:32] &gt;&gt; you see and afterwards now somebody come
[3:34] now and strike the main vein
[3:35] &gt;&gt; to vindicate the prophet did see oil
[3:37] down there
[3:38] &gt;&gt; but them other guys church folks mind
[3:40] you
[3:41] &gt;&gt; they had the wrong motive and objective
[3:44] &gt;&gt; something was
[3:45] &gt;&gt; called heart issues
[3:47] &gt;&gt; is the inside job
[3:49] &gt;&gt; oh praise Go as B say get heart attack
[3:52] there inside job
[3:54] &gt;&gt; won't heart attack you in inside job.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; So watch then we are ready for dynamics
[3:58] to be lit off and only God can do that.
[4:03] So there's no need to manufacture
[4:05] nothing.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; When when Elijah challenged them, let
[4:09] God answer my father and be God and them
[4:12] fellas carry on because they're custom
[4:13] doing stuff. Them fellas is not they're
[4:15] afraid for the challenge. You know them
[4:18] seven old tell them fellas jump and cut
[4:20] their self and my god they carry on.
[4:22] They wasn't dead believers like me. No.
[4:24] Oh the word on fire. They off the word
[4:27] on fire. Blow off the word on fire.
[4:30] That's a different kind of group on
[4:33] When he like when he feel so he say go
[4:35] like go for a trip boy he go to bagel
[4:38] &gt;&gt; or go by the beach where God go you
[4:41] understand I'm saying go a little louder
[4:44] because he not hearing because I see no
[4:46] fire when his time come he say pour
[4:48] water he restore the altar he said pour
[4:50] water he said pour water again because I
[4:52] want them to know there's no kerosene
[4:55] there's no diesel oil there nothing on
[4:57] no wood there I want you to know it's
[4:59] water water it's so wet
[5:02] The fire had to come from God. Okay. The
[5:05] Lord I shout and God take the word.
[5:08] Seven seals, seven thunders. And we wet.
[5:10] We dripping with water. Water. Word.
[5:13] Word. Water. Water. They laugh at us.
[5:15] They mock us. Let them laugh. But we
[5:18] dripping with water. Water. But one day
[5:21] the Holy Ghost and fire. The Holy Ghost
[5:23] and power. Oh, hallelujah. Let the God
[5:25] that answer my fire. Let that God be
[5:28] gone.
[5:34] This is going to be a short quick
[5:35] message tonight. Don't worry.
[5:36] Hallelujah.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; So watch when you get your heart right.
[5:40] When you follow everything you could do,
[5:42] you in baptism whatever and you stand
[5:45] there, we are ready for the dynamics and
[5:48] only God can do that. Here we go. And
[5:50] this detail now that's to drop into your
[5:53] heart that faith
[5:55] &gt;&gt; that says I am now healed.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; That's it. So when when brother pray for
[6:00] the blind man and then spend come back
[6:02] in the prayer line because he hear other
[6:04] people heal say you're healed.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Now he's a Catholic his faith have to
[6:09] hold on to
[6:12] &gt;&gt; his faith hold on to so by stripes I'm
[6:15] healed. By strip I'm heal. So he's by
[6:17] stripe I'm healed. What is happening
[6:19] there? Mental faith at work.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; His mouth
[6:23] &gt;&gt; his mind.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; His mouth his mind.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; By faith I'm healed. By faith I'm
[6:27] healed. By faith, I'm healed. And one
[6:29] day in the barber saloon, it dropped
[6:31] onto his hand
[6:32] &gt;&gt; and he was healed.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Then he jumped on the barber chair and
[6:36] the man finish cutting here.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then
[6:39] that make it half z cut him. He's out
[6:43] because he's seeing now. He could cut
[6:45] his own hair. He's out of the barber
[6:47] chair because something connect from
[6:49] here to here. This is the problem. This
[6:52] is the unbelief. Subconscious unbelief.
[6:54] Unbelief you don't even know it's there.
[6:56] But when the word hit you, then you
[6:58] realize, wait a minute, when I look at
[7:00] myself, I have problems. I have issues.
[7:03] Do I believe what God said? It shall
[7:05] come to pass afterwards. I will pour
[7:08] out. I will restore. Oh, the Lord, I
[7:11] shout. When them conquer them, crack the
[7:14] teeth and break down the God's tree.
[7:16] When they come to the end,
[7:19] &gt;&gt; they say no more is a stump.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; They walk away.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; And God wait for it to come to a stop.
[7:25] And brother Van said nothing is stopping
[7:27] it now. I will restore Luther Wesley
[7:30] Pentecost William Bron and here comes
[7:33] the bride. Nothing going to stop this
[7:36] bride. It have false anointed. It have
[7:38] unbelievers. It have interpreters. It
[7:40] have bes
[7:45] come the message writing trying to take
[7:47] over trying to make unity and not unity.
[7:50] said faith just unity and if you don't
[7:52] hear him he vex he upset
[7:55] &gt;&gt; go say unity you know he say unity of
[7:58] defaith
[8:00] &gt;&gt; then you have to go back to def faith
[8:02] &gt;&gt; to get it united
[8:04] &gt;&gt; go give the lord a shout and you don't
[8:06] have six faith and four faith and three
[8:08] faith you know it only have one faith
[8:10] even has one lord
[8:12] &gt;&gt; them crazy but seven thunders give that
[8:15] one faith
[8:16] &gt;&gt; okay give the lord a shout in the house
[8:19] that's a Reserve faith. God leave that
[8:21] only for the brain. The church can have
[8:23] everything else. They can have trumpets,
[8:25] vials, woes, woman of the sun, pope, all
[8:29] kind of thing. They can have this
[8:30] mystery, hidden mystery, underground
[8:32] mystery, untuck mystery, all kind of
[8:35] mystery they could have. But you see the
[8:36] seven thunders that the mighty angel
[8:38] came and threw out. Oh, give the Lord a
[8:41] shout. It have resurrection in that. It
[8:43] have rapture in that. It have change
[8:45] your body in that. Oh, give the Lord
[8:48] some praises.
[8:49] I am preaching all this for no
[8:51] tribulation. Hallelujah. I'm preaching
[8:54] to lead correctly.
[8:56] [Applause]
[8:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; What will happen Sunday? Hallelujah. All
[9:08] right. Now, but preach perfect man
[9:12] preach blasphemous names. You can't
[9:14] really clarify or get it clean without
[9:16] really studying blasphemous names.
[9:18] blasphemerous names give clarity to what
[9:21] he preach in the morning and then the
[9:23] blasphemous names. No bless morning.
[9:26] Okay, it's bright. Then he preach that.
[9:28] So watch he said now when you talk about
[9:31] he say automobile.
[9:33] Now I've got several mechanics in the
[9:35] church and he said I'm not a mechanic
[9:37] but it has spo coils plugs points valves
[9:41] &gt;&gt; to make up the automobile.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Now when you talk about the baptism of
[9:44] the Holy Spirit
[9:46] &gt;&gt; there's a lot goes with that.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; He say there's a lot that goes with
[9:52] that. It have coils, blood and points
[9:54] into in the Holy Ghost too
[9:56] &gt;&gt; to make it up. It's not just one thing.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Peter, now he is putting it back in
[10:01] the word.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Peter said faith first.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Add to your faith, virtue,
[10:07] virtue, knowledge, knowledge,
[10:08] temperance, and from this bring in seven
[10:10] church ages and so on like that. Amen.
[10:12] Then he said he has built a bride, born
[10:15] a bride. Hear the words, begotten a
[10:17] bride on earth for Christ. And the same
[10:20] way he beggets his bride, he has
[10:22] begotten individuals.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; So the church ages is a reflection of
[10:26] what's supposed to work in you.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; The church age people didn't wasn't
[10:33] conscious and aware what they were
[10:34] living out.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; But they were rocking Satan's kingdom,
[10:38] &gt;&gt; thundering out God's life
[10:40] &gt;&gt; in every age.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; And what God sent the prophet to do was
[10:44] to gather the entire life.
[10:47] [Applause]
[10:49] Now the Holy Ghost was born at the river
[10:51] Euphrates
[10:52] &gt;&gt; because of priest and dogmas
[10:55] &gt;&gt; like an electric wire. You can't put a
[10:57] PVC pipe and say current flowing through
[10:59] that.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Water will flow through a PVC pipe
[11:02] &gt;&gt; not current.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; It have to have a wire for it to flow.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; And through the ages because the word
[11:06] was broken the wire was cut.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; What brother Brandon did? He stitched
[11:10] the wires together
[11:12] &gt;&gt; connected through seven ages. And once
[11:14] the wire line up and he jam it and flick
[11:16] the switch,
[11:17] &gt;&gt; it start to flow through the current
[11:19] start to flow.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; And this is the same thing he wanted in
[11:22] his last day that he said there is my
[11:24] spirit flowing freely from them men.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; That's why I keep saying the first sign
[11:29] of the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[11:30] virtue
[11:32] &gt;&gt; going out
[11:33] &gt;&gt; from the man's body.
[11:38] Because when virtue come out of Christ,
[11:39] the woman say he say he say um she say
[11:42] um he said who touched me?
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Watch this. The disciples say everybody
[11:46] touching you. Where's the point?
[11:48] &gt;&gt; They missed the boat clean.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; He said no. I felt I felt a withdrawal.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody pulled something out of me.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; That woman pulled virtue. And when Jesus
[11:57] saw the woman, he said thy faith.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Look where virtue is in the pyramid. And
[12:03] look where faith is. Faith is at the
[12:05] bottom. And what's next?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Virtue. So faith pulls virtue.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Virtue is power.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Power to stop the blood issue. Power to
[12:15] heal you. Power to give you the
[12:17] breakthrough. Give me a scripture. As
[12:19] many as receive him to them give me
[12:21] power to become.
[12:24] [Applause]
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Is that instant power to become?
[12:30] So God give you a start
[12:32] &gt;&gt; that you could run to the finish.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; So with your faith you pull down virtue.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Virtue left me feeling weak.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[12:46] now these things here talking about the
[12:49] temperance and everything else virtues
[12:51] must be in the Christian.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Before the Holy Spirit
[12:57] &gt;&gt; ever seals them. Hallelujah.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; And makes a complete unit.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the baptism. Now,
[13:04] &gt;&gt; he's talking about the person of Christ.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Come in and seal the virtues in.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Then you become a living moving
[13:12] monument.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Then you become a vindicated son. Then
[13:15] you become a vindicated daughter. Every
[13:17] devil in hell know your name.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. The Lord I shout ah
[13:31] Then
[13:32] &gt;&gt; sister gave him a dream.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[13:35] &gt;&gt; a shepherd.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; We know the dream.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; And she was wondering if she had the
[13:39] Holy Ghost.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; And in the dream, she said a dream, she
[13:43] was up on a mountain.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if I didn't feel it, let alone we
[13:45] know it. If I didn't feel tonight, I was
[13:47] going to say it.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Is a reason why I saying this thing
[13:51] tonight.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; I want to show the context of the
[13:54] message.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She dreamed she was up a
[13:56] mountain and this mountain she says now
[13:58] she saw a large man standing there with
[14:00] work clothes on sleeve rolled up bailing
[14:03] bailing the most pure water she ever
[14:06] seen
[14:07] &gt;&gt; pouring into this box
[14:09] &gt;&gt; this rock box sitting on the top of the
[14:11] mountain and the rock box would not hold
[14:15] the water
[14:17] &gt;&gt; it rolled right out of there and just
[14:20] boiled up all the trash and sticks and
[14:23] everything in there and boiled it out
[14:25] and rolled down the mountain and it
[14:28] rolled over her feet and she was
[14:30] standing there right in that stuff only
[14:33] it didn't stick to her
[14:35] &gt;&gt; and when she asked why the box didn't
[14:37] hold it the man said that is not water
[14:41] &gt;&gt; that's the Holy Ghost
[14:44] &gt;&gt; nothing will hold it
[14:46] &gt;&gt; and then he went and got another big
[14:48] bucket it was full of honey
[14:50] &gt;&gt; and he poured honey into there said now
[14:53] it will hold this.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message?
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Do people still believe what you're
[14:59] seeing here?
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Now, she thought the box was a rock box.
[15:04] It was going to burst out and spill the
[15:06] honey. But it didn't.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; It finally stuck together
[15:10] &gt;&gt; and held it.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; She turned, went down the mountain,
[15:13] going down the mountain. She stopped at
[15:14] the bottom of the mountain. She saw five
[15:15] streams of pure crystal water not
[15:17] contaminated with the things it has went
[15:19] through.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the dream, Sister Shepherd?
[15:22] No more. picked up the letter and opened
[15:24] it, I saw her dream.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; So now she wrote the dream but now he's
[15:29] seen a vision
[15:30] &gt;&gt; of the dream itself.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; So that is how we end up interpreting
[15:33] the dream.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go on now.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Now hear how he backdrop this dream. Now
[15:41] you cannot make a holy church.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy church.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; So so so you sisters wearing just above
[15:51] the knee. Well, I I I know that there's
[15:53] somebody coming inside here somebody
[15:54] seat that will tolerated and they
[15:56] judging the whole church by one person
[15:57] that they don't even know if they are
[15:58] saints you know or just come inside just
[16:00] get baptized in Jesus name you see what
[16:02] I'm saying
[16:03] &gt;&gt; and yet this prophet said you cannot
[16:06] make a holy church
[16:09] &gt;&gt; there is no such thing as a holy church
[16:12] &gt;&gt; or a holy organization
[16:14] &gt;&gt; the holy spirit can be preached in it
[16:16] &gt;&gt; but in there you find good
[16:20] bad
[16:21] &gt;&gt; renegade
[16:22] Yes.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Indifferent
[16:24] &gt;&gt; and everything else. Everything else
[16:26] means everything else.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; I would like to talk about everything
[16:28] else tonight. There's an ex sermon all
[16:30] together. Let me leave everything else
[16:31] alone.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold it.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; None of the rest of them has it. and
[16:43] minister preaching that
[16:45] &gt;&gt; not exact words but their life and the
[16:49] reflection of arrogance and pride on
[16:50] their believers reflect that they
[16:52] believe this
[16:54] &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that
[16:56] &gt;&gt; they're not saying these exact words
[16:57] they pull pit but their life and the
[17:00] arrogance and attitude and pride of
[17:01] their believers reflect this
[17:03] &gt;&gt; that we have it
[17:05] &gt;&gt; and the others don't have it so we are
[17:06] special and the rest of our like we
[17:10] &gt;&gt; we are living the rest is king That's
[17:13] exactly right.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; So watch. So an organization will not
[17:20] hold it. You can't say we got it. None
[17:23] the rest of them has it. No sir. The
[17:25] Holy Spirit is poured out on
[17:27] individuals.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you shout
[17:30] tonight. That should make you
[17:33] This should be the greatest revelation
[17:35] strike in you that the Holy Ghost, you
[17:37] don't need a church for the Holy Ghost
[17:39] because the Holy Ghost is import. You
[17:41] can pour it in your bathroom. You can
[17:43] pour it in your bedroom. You can pour it
[17:44] in the drawing room. You can pour it in
[17:46] the kitchen. He can pour it on your in
[17:47] your car.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; You get p
[17:54] on you in the church.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is poured on
[17:57] individuals.
[18:00] [Music]
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; So the man pouring the water was brother
[18:10] Brown.
[18:14] This was the seals,
[18:16] &gt;&gt; the thunders,
[18:17] &gt;&gt; the mysteries,
[18:18] &gt;&gt; the word,
[18:20] &gt;&gt; the revelation because the mysteries of
[18:21] God come from God is the word of God.
[18:22] And this word was supposed to boil out
[18:25] &gt;&gt; trash
[18:28] &gt;&gt; in order to receive
[18:30] &gt;&gt; the honey.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; I know people make light. You know
[18:34] anytime I talk about honey broadcast can
[18:36] somebody tell me I have fake b can them
[18:38] check my ban fake them have a
[18:41] thermometer that checks whether b is
[18:44] real or not any leave that alone
[18:47] now
[18:49] look where brotherly kindness is
[18:52] &gt;&gt; and on top of brotherly kindness is the
[18:53] holy spirit
[18:55] &gt;&gt; therefore you can't access holy spirit
[18:58] &gt;&gt; outside of brotherly kindness
[19:00] &gt;&gt; so let's change Jesus prayer a bit when
[19:02] you stand praying
[19:03] &gt;&gt; for Charity
[19:06] &gt;&gt; forgive
[19:07] &gt;&gt; if you have ought against
[19:08] &gt;&gt; any.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Let's change it further. When you start
[19:11] praying for dynamics
[19:15] &gt;&gt; because if you can't manifest brotherly
[19:17] kindness is short on mechanics
[19:19] &gt;&gt; because bly kindness the blood have to
[19:20] be displayed.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Because that's a virtue for our age.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; God put it correctly. So the bride Yeah.
[19:27] Listen carefully. Have to be
[19:28] positionally placed.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; On the seventh step.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:34] to receive the groom.
[19:36] [Applause]
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Do you get it tonight?
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Almost there. The
[19:45] bride has to be placed
[19:47] &gt;&gt; positionally sir.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; On the seventh step
[19:53] &gt;&gt; to receive the groom.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; What is below brotherly kind is
[19:59] godliness.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; To be like God. Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; That's a godly man.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; And yet on top of that godliness, God
[20:08] say you have to get some burden on top
[20:10] of that.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Godliness alone can't make it.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; You have to act to godliness. Brotherly
[20:24] kindness. God have to see the spirit of
[20:26] forgiveness.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph. The quoting him wasn't
[20:31] by chance. Look at Joseph when his
[20:33] brothers came. Now if Joseph was a train
[20:37] when he brothers come
[20:40] wood, not worthy would
[20:45] cut a piece of wood and licks. But
[20:48] you're so wicked
[20:50] so long.
[20:52] That mean unconverted unchang. It's
[20:55] plenty years since 17.
[20:58] You mean change? Like that temple? They
[21:00] old now and the same vi temper and anger
[21:05] talk about the man dying and the man of
[21:07] foolishness. That don't change you.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; If you're a foolish man, you're dead. A
[21:11] foolish man.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Joseph says to his brethren, these
[21:21] wicked men, they were wicked.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't wicked. He told those wicked
[21:28] brethren, "God,
[21:31] not you, God, send me ahead
[21:36] &gt;&gt; to preserve life."
[21:38] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful man.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; That's a man who have a lot of grace.
[21:41] But
[21:42] &gt;&gt; because that they make him learn a new
[21:44] language. They make him hit a new
[21:46] culture. They make him leave him in a
[21:48] whole new environment. They let his
[21:50] father grieve and father suffer in tears
[21:53] because he lost his favorite son.
[21:55] And yet he was sent ahead to save the
[21:58] entire world
[21:59] &gt;&gt; by putting a pyramid in Egypt. And when
[22:01] all other bands are empty,
[22:04] &gt;&gt; only Joseph B of green. Hey.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. How much have a time
[22:10] tonight when all the bands are empty?
[22:14] Only Jose B of green. What was Joseph
[22:16] sent for? To warn them.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; We have seven years plenty coming
[22:21] &gt;&gt; and seven years of famine.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Oh,
[22:24] give the Lord a shout. Malachi 4. What
[22:28] did he come to do? Judgment is coming.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Get ready. Get ready.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Today Putin had a dry run of nuclear
[22:37] warming warning for the entire nation
[22:40] &gt;&gt; because Trump Trump sent a nuclear
[22:43] he say he sent a nuclear submarine
[22:45] closer to Russia.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Now if he didn't say that he might do
[22:50] nothing but now that they say that
[22:54] as you see that.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; So, alarms went out all over Russia and
[22:59] they know what to do.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; We don't even have a basement.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; There are bunkers in
[23:13] &gt;&gt; things to go around to hide, to protect.
[23:17] We We We don't even have a subterranean.
[23:22] Forget it.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Bible says is a small thing in court.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; My lord. So we find out that the
[23:30] messenger, right? So watch this man.
[23:34] Okay. So this tabernacle we will see
[23:36] that's where she comes to church. This
[23:38] tabernacle, listen to these words
[23:40] &gt;&gt; and you could see if people really
[23:42] believe the prophet George. This
[23:44] tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost
[23:46] tabernacle.
[23:48] There is no such a thing.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Individuals
[23:53] that come into this church is Holy Ghost
[23:57] tabernacle.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; There are tabernacles that contain the
[24:01] Holy Ghost
[24:02] &gt;&gt; but not the church in the body
[24:04] &gt;&gt; or a group.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it runs out.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; So that's why the church the box
[24:09] couldn't hold the Holy Ghost
[24:12] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is not going into
[24:13] that box. and boil the trash out, but
[24:16] the Holy Ghost goes into individuals.
[24:19] [Applause]
[24:22] &gt;&gt; So watch, they are tabernacles contain
[24:25] the Holy Ghost, not the church and the
[24:27] body or group. Therefore, it runs out.
[24:29] Mission card, please. Now this man, here
[24:32] we go. Who was pouring the water, the
[24:35] messengers to the church,
[24:36] &gt;&gt; pouring the message into the church,
[24:40] &gt;&gt; that is the seals,
[24:42] &gt;&gt; that's the thunders,
[24:43] &gt;&gt; that is the mysteries, both written and
[24:45] hidden.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; They like to talk that talk. So I talk
[24:48] that talk too.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; It have written mysteries and hidden
[24:52] mysteries.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So that the whole message
[24:55] &gt;&gt; was poured into the church
[24:56] &gt;&gt; and the objective of it was to clean it
[24:59] out
[25:00] &gt;&gt; to pour honey
[25:03] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is only coming on
[25:07] &gt;&gt; honey.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Let them fight that.
[25:12] That's why that's why God tell John the
[25:14] one
[25:15] &gt;&gt; who you see the dove
[25:17] &gt;&gt; resting and remaining
[25:19] &gt;&gt; not one without order
[25:21] &gt;&gt; because sometime the dove rest and it
[25:22] not remaining
[25:23] &gt;&gt; true
[25:24] &gt;&gt; you see what I see a dove hit him
[25:26] &gt;&gt; and you look back so just gone
[25:31] the dove can't stay
[25:32] &gt;&gt; when you start to react so
[25:35] you catch so
[25:38] doing it this way he said do it the
[25:40] other
[25:42] know meow coming
[25:44] &gt;&gt; there a wolf you understand I'm saying
[25:46] so that dove
[25:49] landing think a cat think humble think
[25:52] it like and when the arrogance come up
[25:54] and the temper come up and the attitude
[25:55] come up dove say I gone
[25:58] &gt;&gt; and the dog fire the dog on a on a
[26:00] little waiting he's waiting for it to
[26:02] change
[26:03] &gt;&gt; he's waiting for you to adjust he's
[26:05] waiting for you to repent he's waiting
[26:07] for you to get a different kind of
[26:08] attitude and atmosphere and spirit
[26:11] because the lamb only hanging up with
[26:13] dove. Dove only hanging up with lamb.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Dumb and w don't mix together.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Let me finish here.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; This man was pouring the water, the
[26:22] message of the church, pouring a message
[26:24] into the church. But what was the water
[26:26] doing?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; It was boiling all the trash out of it.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; That is what the Holy Spirit does.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; It boils it out.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Now the honey. There we go. This is
[26:38] brother teacher not this brother over
[26:40] teacher the honey represented brotherly
[26:43] love
[26:44] &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness which is this age
[26:46] &gt;&gt; and you say I shout like brother Jones I
[26:48] shout like brother Jones sometimes but
[26:51] let something happen to him your heart
[26:52] is broke because we can obtain brotherly
[26:56] kindness and feeling for one another.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't be brotherly
[27:01] kindness by yourself. You can shake your
[27:03] hand and happy birthday to me.
[27:05] You wash in the mirrors and tell
[27:06] yourself I love you. That makes no
[27:08] sense. In a group is where there are
[27:11] issues, problems, you know,
[27:13] disappointment. That is where you get to
[27:14] exercise this thing called brotherly
[27:16] kindness. Why do you care for that
[27:17] brother? Because you broke bread with
[27:18] him.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; You were at the altar. I'm going to
[27:20] close. You fellowship with him. You
[27:22] shook his hands. Here we go. You worship
[27:23] with him. He's your brother. Now, he
[27:25] might do something in the flesh that you
[27:26] would disagree with. And because you
[27:29] just kind of stay which you ought to do
[27:30] and shun him a little bit but in the
[27:32] bottom of the heart if something
[27:33] happened to that brother it will nearly
[27:35] kill you.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; He said no and then he went and
[27:38] continuing on. Oh my. I'll close with
[27:40] this quote here. We continue on Sunday.
[27:46] Before this body can ever be perfected
[27:50] the spirit will bring it in submission
[27:52] to God
[27:54] &gt;&gt; to make you.
[27:58] That's a big one.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; It's a war all the time. A constant war.
[28:03] Paul said, "When I will do good, evil is
[28:05] near me." There's a constant war. The
[28:07] flesh against the spirit.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; But he prophesied that the spirit will
[28:12] bring it in submission.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; You got a soul beside your senses. God
[28:16] never gave you those senses to trust him
[28:18] with. God gave you his spirit to trust.
[28:21] Your senses is only to contact, see,
[28:24] smell, taste, and hear and so on. All
[28:27] right, I I had done here already. No,
[28:29] I'll leave it at this.
[28:32] But I'll close with this line on top of
[28:35] it. I thought I had here. The spirit,
[28:37] here we go, will bring the people right
[28:39] back to where they were at the
[28:41] beginning.
[28:42] So when God say I'll restore and you
[28:45] know the prophet said the the the uh
[28:48] when the church is believing that the
[28:52] same Holy Spirit
[28:54] &gt;&gt; is just as real
[28:56] &gt;&gt; as it was at the day of Pentecost.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; How they are born and positionally born.
[29:01] He is saying that we are going right
[29:03] back to that.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; I will restore. Let's all stand
[29:07] &gt;&gt; and give God some praise. Begin to pray.
[29:08] Father God, we thank you for tonight. We
[29:10] thank you for your presence and spirit.
[29:12] May you have the prayer minister among
[29:13] your people. We commit their lives unto
[29:15] thee in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[29:17] amen. God bless you. Thanks again for
[29:19] coming out tonight. Praise God. We
[29:21] appreciate you. We love you. God bless
[29:23] you brother and your daughter. God bless
[29:26] you all. Safe journey to Grenada and may
[29:28] the fire be with you. My God.
[29:30] Hallelujah.
[29:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise
[29:39] God. Brother, just sing a song for me
[29:40] and
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit.
[29:48] Pour out your spirit.
[29:52] Pour out your spirit
[29:56] on me.
[29:59] Won't you pour out your spirit?
[30:05] Oh, pour out your spirit.
[30:10] Pour out your spirit
[30:14] on me.
[30:16] Oh, sing it all your heart. Sing it.
[30:18] Pour out, oh
[30:22] Lord, pour out.
[30:25] Oh, pour out your spirit
[30:30] on me.
[30:33] Oh, won't you pour out your spirit?
[30:39] Oh, pour out your Oh, pour out your
[30:45] spirit.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Give him some praises and then you're
[30:49] going to have a seat.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Have a seat. I need your spit.
[30:56] I need your spit.
[31:01] I need your spirit
[31:04] in me.
[31:09] I need your spirit.
[31:13] I need your spirit.
[31:18] I need your spirit.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; One more time. Pour out your spirit. The
[31:24] prayer.
[31:26] Pour out your spirit.
[31:30] Pour out your spirit.
[31:35] Pour out your spirit
[31:39] in me.
[31:42] Oh Jesus, pour out my spirit.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit.
[31:52] Pour out.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. right now where you are. I
[31:56] want you to raise your hands and worship
[31:57] the Lord right now.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:07] Hallelujah.
[32:08] Yes, Lord.
[32:11] Need your spirit in me.
[32:16] Oh Jesus,
[32:18] pour out the spirit.
[32:23] Pour out the spirit.
[32:27] Pour out the spirit
[32:31] on me.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus told the one of the well, he said,
[32:34] "Woman, the hour come is when the true
[32:36] worshippers worship the father in spirit
[32:38] and in truth."
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. So we continue
[32:44] the word.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Brother, he talk about a man. He asked
[32:50] him he feeling the spirit of the
[32:52] churches today but rather it begin to
[32:54] drop down spirit dropping ministers
[32:56] coming from everywhere interviews asking
[32:58] what happened brother Brandham what has
[33:01] happened are they living off the spirit
[33:03] of Satan or what I said no the sucker
[33:07] lives off the strength of the vine it
[33:09] lives because the citrus lemon fruit
[33:11] will grow on orange tree it will not be
[33:13] orange to do it lives by by it life and
[33:16] the church so-called is only a grafted
[33:19] sucker
[33:20] living under this name of religion under
[33:23] the name of the church Catholic
[33:24] protestant just suckers and he said
[33:26] there wasn't in the original
[33:28] predestination plan of God Jesus say I
[33:31] am the vine the branches but if that
[33:32] tree ever put forth another branch
[33:36] &gt;&gt; it will bear the original fruit
[33:38] &gt;&gt; so the grafting orange they grafting
[33:40] tangelo and all kind of lemon and all
[33:42] kind of stuff but is the original tree
[33:45] &gt;&gt; was the orange tree
[33:46] &gt;&gt; and God said to put forth another orange
[33:48] branch It will produce the original
[33:50] fruit. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[33:52] Lord. So that's why you cannot look at
[33:54] other manifestation and all kind of
[33:55] crazy stuff around as if that the
[33:57] message. The message is the original
[33:59] word.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; The message is the original life. The
[34:02] message original seed
[34:04] &gt;&gt; that God put on the day of Pentecost.
[34:06] That is the message
[34:09] &gt;&gt; and that is what you're coming to fight
[34:10] for. You're not fighting for just
[34:12] church. You're fighting to get back to
[34:14] where you're supposed to be. Remember
[34:16] our ultimate destination is back to
[34:18] Eden.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; We are fighting for Trinidad. You know,
[34:20] we fighting to go back to Eden. You
[34:22] know,
[34:23] [Applause]
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; In Eden, Adam was in God's image and
[34:28] likeness.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; In Eden, Adam had dominion. In Eden,
[34:31] Adam was a god of the earth.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Small G.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; And God was the big G.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, if that tree ever put
[34:39] forth another branch, it will bear its
[34:41] original fruit. And here the prophecy
[34:43] now. And there has got to be a
[34:46] restoration of all these things right at
[34:49] the end of the vine.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; It watch there's to be light in the
[34:53] evening time. It takes light to ripen
[34:55] it.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; So God is comparing his people to like a
[34:58] seed fruit. Fruit could ripen. Faith
[35:00] could ripen.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Fruit could grow.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Faith could grow.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Fruit does mature.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Faith could mature. Fruit have a start.
[35:08] Faith have a start. So just as fruit
[35:11] come into maturity, you have to come to
[35:12] maturity. Just as fruit get right, you
[35:14] could get right or your faith could get
[35:17] right. You talk about Abraham coming in
[35:19] the fullness of believing. It means you
[35:21] growing in faith that God is going to
[35:23] perform this miracle. And you have to
[35:25] grow in faith. Coming under expectation
[35:28] every service, not just now and again
[35:30] every single service. Your job is to
[35:32] come in under expectation. Your
[35:34] expectation could move the minister.
[35:36] Your expectation could move the Holy
[35:38] Ghost. Your own expectation. Oh, give
[35:41] the Lord a shout. Praise God.
[35:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. Come here
[35:45] to take notes. You come here to be on
[35:46] expectation. You can write all your
[35:48] notes home. Oh, give the Lord some
[35:50] praises. You're coming to worship.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; You as believers come in a greater
[35:54] atmosphere.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I am not a priest. I'm not
[36:01] a Catholic priest. The college is upso.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; If just in case you're coming here by
[36:05] mistake.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Upso. You get the Catholic
[36:08] priest. He blesses you and do his
[36:09] crosses and stuff and but here is to
[36:12] preach the word and see you have faith
[36:14] to take it
[36:15] &gt;&gt; because God put a challenge in your life
[36:16] right now.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you are here this
[36:18] morning. You have a challenge in your
[36:20] life. You have to have it. If you don't
[36:22] have a challenge, something wrong with
[36:23] your experience. Something wrong with
[36:24] you. God put a challenge to see if you
[36:26] got faith to believe it. He challenged
[36:28] Abraham's body condition. He challenged
[36:30] Sarah body condition. He always
[36:32] challenges people. Oh,
[36:34] &gt;&gt; give the Lord some praises.
[36:39] Goliath was a challenge to Israel.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; It's just that David had reached yet.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; So Goliath parade in his beef for 14
[36:45] days and 40 nights
[36:46] &gt;&gt; on because David reach the only reason
[36:48] that he
[36:49] &gt;&gt; because David had reached you know
[36:53] &gt;&gt; and when David came he came out of
[36:55] timing when God wasn't there. And when
[36:58] his brother start to rough him up, they
[36:59] have no anointing to do nothing, you
[37:00] know,
[37:01] &gt;&gt; only talk,
[37:03] &gt;&gt; they facing no challenge. They only
[37:04] roughening up their brother.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; And as they about to leave, then Goliath
[37:08] step forward out of timing just stepping
[37:10] out of timing. Timing
[37:12] &gt;&gt; and they say, "Who is that?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Unircumcised."
[37:15] He start him already. He put a tag on
[37:17] him. Who is that uncircumcised?
[37:19] Philistine. He pinned him uncircumcised.
[37:21] That that pinn that on him
[37:23] uncircumcised. He don't belong inside of
[37:25] here. What are you doing inside of here?
[37:27] In my name shall cast out devils. Who is
[37:30] the uncircumcised pilline? In your
[37:32] house, in your life, in your home, in
[37:34] your mind, in your head. What is he
[37:37] doing dear? This body is mine's. God
[37:41] give it to me. Sickness is not mine.
[37:43] Sickness got to go pack up shop. Serving
[37:46] sickness, notice. Serving disease,
[37:48] notice. Serving depression, not
[37:53] glory.
[37:55] Hallelujah.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Be seated. Note in every age, every
[38:00] believer, their their senses was
[38:03] challenged
[38:04] &gt;&gt; to prove how faith is above senses.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So David watched Goliath and
[38:10] shall cut your head off and man have a
[38:12] sword. That when you talk in faith,
[38:15] that's when you're walking in faith.
[38:16] That when you speak in faith, that when
[38:18] faith come alive, you to speak things
[38:20] that are not as though they will. You
[38:22] just call things that are not as though
[38:24] they while cut your head off and he has
[38:27] seen the sword coming yet. Oh, glory to
[38:29] God. Give the Lord a shout. This is how
[38:32] he had to speak. Our God is able to
[38:34] deliver us. But if we don't deliver us,
[38:36] we are not going to bow down. And them
[38:39] guys walk in the fiery furnace and all
[38:41] the furnace do is to loose their bounds.
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Challenge of the senses.
[38:53] too much of you too feely feely.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; You're not in the faith yet. You're
[38:57] feeling
[39:00] &gt;&gt; God challenged Noah's senses
[39:03] &gt;&gt; to build an ark on a mountain
[39:06] &gt;&gt; and we never fall yet.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; We reading that normal normal Noah. I'm
[39:11] thinking about you. Could you imagine
[39:13] that?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; No. Yeshua,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; nor a billion only hammer nail going up
[39:18] according to specification. They're
[39:20] building a boat. Where you sailing at?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; How you going on float?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Behave yourself now. You're thinking
[39:28] right.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; You're looking like a cuck when you rain
[39:32] never fall them scientist put latest
[39:34] news in CNN. No rain up there.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; You know I say when you finish
[39:41] &gt;&gt; it shall rain.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; When God shut no into the ark,
[39:48] not one drop of rain fall down.
[39:51] What a piece of test for seven days.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; No one just waiting there. His children
[39:55] had to give him terrorize him on the
[39:57] inside. Daddy, are you sure
[39:59] &gt;&gt; going have a party this weekend,
[40:01] Saturday? You know,
[40:04] &gt;&gt; today is Tuesday
[40:06] and the store open
[40:08] &gt;&gt; and I want to buy a piece of garment to
[40:10] go to this. Are you sure? He says, "Son,
[40:13] I'm sure."
[40:14] &gt;&gt; God testing and people start to mock
[40:16] outside. Look, look, look, look. He
[40:18] going inside now. tire is heat, you
[40:21] know, air condition inside it.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Seven days
[40:27] &gt;&gt; and the ark preaching.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Seven days to the eternal loss.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Seven days Noah's third pull.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Ark preaching.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; God shut him in. What door God shut, no
[40:41] man can open. What door God open, no man
[40:44] could shut. God shut no in. Let's say it
[40:48] this way. God sealed Noah and the act
[40:51] stood there. To all them hypocrites, to
[40:53] all them church members, to all them who
[40:56] thinking about getting saved and wanted
[40:57] to get it right. It stood there
[41:01] and they couldn't be saved.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody get a dream. I got a dream last
[41:06] night. No, don't open up. No. No. I
[41:08] didn't close the door. You know,
[41:11] &gt;&gt; I can't open what God shut.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; So that dream can help you now. It
[41:15] should have dream before these seven
[41:16] days. You should have come in before
[41:18] that.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Then the rain begin to fall.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; You know people come out there are
[41:24] feeling led.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; They line up to be in church.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; This hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[41:32] Glory.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Too late.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; The rain is coming.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; But say after door is shut,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; God will anoint the church. Then
[41:43] &gt;&gt; how would it be to see signs, wonders,
[41:45] miracles, and people can't even be
[41:47] saved?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; But before that time,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; God have to get a ministry out to the
[41:54] lost in this message. There are people
[41:55] in message churches that are lost.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; They're not even saved. They're lost in
[41:59] church. They're dead in church. They're
[42:02] paralyzed in church. They're under cult
[42:04] leaders.
[42:07] But they are going to be delivered. When
[42:10] the spirit begin to move. The spirit
[42:12] coming for the seed in the elect. It
[42:15] will pull them out of every group, every
[42:17] hole, everywhere they hide them. Nothing
[42:20] going to stop it. The same God that put
[42:22] the seed under. And he said, "Let there
[42:25] be light." And when them light hit them
[42:27] seeds, those seeds came forth.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus called 12.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Build his ministry up to 82.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; 70 walk away.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Come back down.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Send a bunch of 120 up a room. And when
[42:55] Peter was loosed under the anointing of
[42:57] Joel, this is that the prophet Joel
[43:01] spake of when Peter was released under
[43:04] the restoration anointing of Joel. 3,000
[43:07] people said, "What shall we do to be
[43:09] saved?" Oh, glory to God. There were
[43:11] elected people under the anointing of
[43:14] this is that. And one of these days a
[43:17] church, bride church, elect church will
[43:20] say, "This is that that the prophet
[43:23] William Brandham spake of." They give
[43:25] the Lord a shook. Not I'm in a message,
[43:28] but this is that. Oh God, we here to
[43:31] fulfill the prophet's prophecy.
[43:35] Glory to God.
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] My God, it's a wonderful thing to be
[43:44] free. It's a wonderful thing to have the
[43:46] liberty in the spirit.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; We don't have to explain nothing away
[43:51] from you.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; We just bomb the word and you're saying
[43:54] amen.
[43:55] [Applause]
[43:57] [Music]
[43:57] [Applause]
[44:01] You may be seated.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Watch. Fruit
[44:07] &gt;&gt; cannot ripen
[44:09] &gt;&gt; unless the sun ripens it.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go deep.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; No matter how much you preach,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; whatever you do,
[44:17] &gt;&gt; it cannot be ripened. It cannot be
[44:19] manifested. It cannot be vindicated.
[44:21] Only by him who said, "I am the light of
[44:23] the world."
[44:24] &gt;&gt; So they could teach, they could preach,
[44:26] they could explain, they could mystery
[44:28] and mystery and mystery. Unless the
[44:30] light come, it's not going to ripen. A
[44:33] light have to come. Okay. Give the Lord
[44:35] a shout. Let's go. Let's go. He said it
[44:38] cannot be ripened. It cannot be
[44:39] manifested. It cannot be vindicated.
[44:42] Only by him
[44:43] &gt;&gt; who said I am the light of the world.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; So the word prophecy now.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; So there has to come forth a power.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Shout out power.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; The message was like a head but we have
[44:54] to say it.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Shout out power.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; We had word for over 50 years but it got
[44:58] to come a power.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Shout out power. One more time.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Act one say you shall
[45:04] receive power after the Holy Ghost come
[45:07] upon you. The Holy Ghost is going to
[45:10] come upon you. Power going to come upon
[45:12] you. Power to live, power to stand,
[45:16] power to overcome, power to heal the
[45:18] sick, power to raise the dead, power to
[45:21] cast out devils, power to set the church
[45:23] in order. But there is going to rise
[45:25] power
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:37] Let me be seated.
[45:43] [Applause]

[45:54] you can hear whatever you want to hear.
[45:56] But I talking about power. This is what
[45:58] is promised. I'm a disciple. We're not
[46:01] babes no longer. We're not in the womb
[46:03] no longer. We are men. We are sons and
[46:06] daughters of God. Be in the message. Oh,
[46:09] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Send your
[46:11] placement. Lord, send on the adoption.
[46:14] Father, send the spirit of adoption.
[46:16] Lord,

[46:19] may be seated. There's got to come for
[46:22] the power.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Then he say what the power is. A man
[46:27] coming from America. No, no, no.
[46:30] They come for a power.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; You want to know what it is?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit himself
[46:37] &gt;&gt; to ripen
[46:39] or to vindicate
[46:41] &gt;&gt; or to prove still reading or to make
[46:43] manifest what he predicted would happen
[46:45] for this day.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Shouting out.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; So then you don't have to look to me.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; You're looking to him.
[46:58] [Applause]
[47:01] You don't who God going to use.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Let me be seated.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible talk about don't pray for this
[47:07] one. They call this one here. Pray for
[47:09] this one. Pray for this ministry and
[47:10] pray for that ministry. Where the
[47:11] preference coming from
[47:13] &gt;&gt; you know who going to use
[47:19] &gt;&gt; it. Remind us talking a little bit about
[47:21] Jesus in the first marriage king of
[47:24] Galilee. JS was invited guest and they
[47:27] come and tell the wine round.
[47:30] She say I I wasn't part of the catering
[47:32] team.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; I know nothing about this marriage. I
[47:37] just come I get inviting. I come for
[47:38] food.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; See the blessing and what not. This run
[47:42] out. Do you say what I do with this?
[47:46] &gt;&gt; I have nothing to do with this. But you
[47:47] see miracles have to start some point in
[47:49] time.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus first miracle
[47:52] &gt;&gt; at a wedding.
[47:56] But the word was whatever he said do it.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; You know how much grapes to buy? He
[48:03] didn't ask for your advice.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; The grape shop open. He didn't ask for
[48:08] advice.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever he say do it.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; He said get water pots and go and draw
[48:13] it.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And you asking then what? Don't ask then
[48:18] what?
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Just do it.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And God giving instructions from this
[48:22] pulpit here. Just do it.
[48:27] Don't question it if it's the word. Just
[48:29] do it.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever he said, just do it.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; They follow the water pots.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; See, go and draw it
[48:37] &gt;&gt; and they pouring and they seeing wine
[48:39] coming out.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Now the people who draw the water pot
[48:42] know what went on.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Not the others.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; They only seen wine coming.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; One man when he tasted so he said he
[48:50] said everybody has give the good wine
[48:51] first and put the bad wine last. After
[48:53] people drink a little high and drink,
[48:54] they didn't know there's a good wine or
[48:56] bad wine. He said, "But this wine
[48:57] different,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; you leave the best wine for last."
[49:00] &gt;&gt; They may know that Jesus turned water
[49:02] into wine.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And when God turn your water into the
[49:06] wine of revelation, it will bring a
[49:09] stimulation. Your deadness going to
[49:11] leave you. Your paralyzed on the bench
[49:14] will leave you. You would jump up. You
[49:16] would raise your hand. You would praise
[49:17] God. You will get out your senses and
[49:20] your feelings and your emotions because
[49:22] wine brings stimulation of revelation.

[1:00:25] them. Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. People have
[1:00:30] paper gods. People have the God of
[1:00:32] imagination. But this God is a God of
[1:00:34] judgment. This God is a God of mercy.
[1:00:37] This God is a God of power and presence
[1:00:38] and redemption.

[1:02:12] running. Don't even look back.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; People waiting for a date because they
[1:02:19] don't want to get a change of life.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I remember in work say, "Oh, the
[1:02:25] Christians only want to go to heaven." I
[1:02:26] said, "No, no, not this one.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I want to see as a witness.
[1:02:30] against all what was going on. A
[1:02:31] witness. I don't want to escape. And now

[1:02:41] want to disappear.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; This is sinners telling me how they view
[1:02:47] Christians. Christian only want to get
[1:02:49] away. They want to go to the rapture.
[1:02:50] They want to go to the Lord and what I
[1:02:52] said. No, no, not this one.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; This one to represent Jesus Christ. I
[1:02:56] want to represent something because only

[1:03:01] nothing no grave you have nothing here
[1:03:02] is the m choice you know here is where
[1:03:04] you do something you know if you have to
[1:03:06] get the red carpet is here to get the
[1:03:08] red carpet you know if you want to do
[1:03:10] something not when you go on your side

[1:03:13] other side it's here sinners need to be
[1:03:15] saved people need to be delivered you
[1:03:18] need to become a witness you need to
[1:03:20] testify you shall be witness unto me
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah from Jerusalem to the
[1:03:24] uttermost part of earth. Get off your
[1:03:26] stinking flesh and witness it to
[1:03:28] somebody about the coming of the Lord
[1:03:30] Jesus.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. It is something when you testify.
[1:03:37] I remember a time I was struggling as a
[1:03:39] young Christian knewing Lord and whatn
[1:03:41] not and I feeling like I'm going
[1:03:42] backlide and I meet a brother older
[1:03:44] brother and of all the testimony tell me
[1:03:46] he going back slide. I said going back
[1:03:48] way
[1:03:49] I was so shocked because he's so much
[1:03:52] older than me mature. I go back. Now I
[1:03:55] begin to bust and rebuke. I don't know
[1:03:56] what was surprised.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I start to rebuke him and whatn not. And
[1:04:00] when I start to rebuke him and talk to
[1:04:02] him about the Lord, I get strength.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't know how much I was
[1:04:07] struggling. But when I see he who I
[1:04:10] consider like a soldier going and give
[1:04:12] up in this battle, I said, "No, that
[1:04:14] can't work."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; I light fire under him.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's good friendship. that when you're
[1:04:21] real good friends, there's light fire
[1:04:23] under you. They don't encourage you in
[1:04:25] slackness because I going to take you to
[1:04:26] hell. They light fire onto your under
[1:04:29] you to make you and provoke you unto
[1:04:31] righteousness.
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Look like service now start.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So you need a power the Holy Spirit
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; himself.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[1:04:48] I believe that the age has come now,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; the miraculous,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; the phenomenal,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; the baptism of the spirit
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and power and signs and wonders, great
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; pouring out of God's spirit in the last
[1:05:03] days.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; that will bring faith into the people
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; that will make a rapture faith
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; and take the church to glory.
[1:05:17] What the intellectuals like to read and
[1:05:18] preach is these divinely revealed
[1:05:20] mystery truths
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; is what will literally turn the hearts
[1:05:23] of back to the V as if that's all the
[1:05:25] prophets say
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; that's just one of the things
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; the transformation of disciples what
[1:05:37] came first manifestation or revelation
[1:05:41] revelation
[1:05:43] so revelation which is the word being
[1:05:45] unfolded Little reveal comes first to
[1:05:48] bring clarity as to what you must
[1:05:50] expect.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; They came out of Egypt. They don't know
[1:05:55] God.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Moses is the one who met God. Moses who
[1:05:58] spoke for God who spoke flies and frogs
[1:06:00] and fleas. Get them out of Egypt.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; God said, "Bring them here. I will
[1:06:03] reveal myself to them
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; by the word, the commandments."
[1:06:07] So Moses went to get the commandments to
[1:06:09] bring to the people to let them know
[1:06:11] what God thinks about life. How you
[1:06:13] treat your neighbor. Love God. Love your
[1:06:16] neighbor as yourself. Thou shalt not
[1:06:18] become adultery. Thou shalt not lie.
[1:06:19] Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt bear
[1:06:22] false witness. And so
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; they know nothing about that.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died and rose from the
[1:06:29] dead, the first thing he did in coming,
[1:06:31] he didn't come to among this and mong
[1:06:33] this and mong that and talk to this one.
[1:06:34] He came to his disciples. Because was a
[1:06:37] different ministry now was resurrection
[1:06:39] ministry. This ministry was only to the
[1:06:42] elect. It wasn't going to lepers and
[1:06:44] going to one. He come to disciples. One
[1:06:46] purpose to set them up to receive the
[1:06:48] Holy Ghost.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; So he opened their minds. He opened
[1:06:52] their understanding. He opened their
[1:06:54] word because if you open the word and
[1:06:55] you don't have an open mind, your word
[1:06:56] close to you, your mind still shut down.
[1:06:59] God had to unlock your mind. Open your
[1:07:02] understanding to the scriptures that you
[1:07:04] might know what is promised. So when
[1:07:06] Jesus finished with them, every man Jack
[1:07:08] know what was promised. So when people
[1:07:10] thought they were drunk, Peter step out
[1:07:12] and said, "These people are not drunk as
[1:07:14] you supposed, but this is that
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; that the prophet George spake of." Where
[1:07:20] did Peter get that from? Jesus.
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Peter got that from Jesus. Praise God.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; And Peter revelation gave him the
[1:07:32] authority to say this is the stone
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; that you builders refuse.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He identified Christ as the
[1:07:38] rejected stone which is the head stone.
[1:07:41] This is the stone you builders refuse.
[1:07:43] God has made it the head of the corner.
[1:07:45] It is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous
[1:07:47] in our eyes. Hallelujah.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Satan interpretation of the upper room
[1:07:53] experience is these people are excited.
[1:07:56] Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Don't bother with them.

[1:08:34] watching you for a long time.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; When the anointing come off and you
[1:08:37] leave the church and what I know I
[1:08:38] coming right back by you.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; I bring a cigarette back for you. I
[1:08:42] bring a drink back for you. I bring a
[1:08:43] boyfriend for you, a girlfriend, bring
[1:08:44] for you.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I come to offload.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So when when when Satan saw them
[1:08:50] standing up a room, he interpreted them
[1:08:52] as carrying on.
[1:08:55] Yes,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; he sleep.
[1:08:59] When Peter
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; saw the man
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; at the gate that everybody knew. So this
[1:09:05] no set up you know people set up
[1:09:06] miracles they no set up miracles now
[1:09:07] they know the man and when Peter
[1:09:10] gone Peter Peter because I'm g change
[1:09:12] when this apostle is the first poor the
[1:09:13] poorest apostle but look for money they
[1:09:16] man can't buy juice downstairs
[1:09:19] somebody buy some wish for me scrunting
[1:09:22] apostle he said silver and gold I don't
[1:09:24] have
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; I have something I have something I have
[1:09:27] something I have something I have
[1:09:29] something what I've have I could give I
[1:09:31] can't give it what I don't have I have
[1:09:33] something I have some I'm filled
[1:09:34] Something something inside my body.
[1:09:37] Something all over me. Something keeping
[1:09:39] me alive. I feel it in my hands. I feel
[1:09:42] it in my feet. Oh, glory to God. Silver
[1:09:45] and gold have I none. Such as I have I
[1:09:48] give it unto thee. He said rise up and
[1:09:50] walk.
[1:09:55] Listen. The man rise up and walk. You
[1:09:57] know the man said to jump and leap and
[1:09:58] praise God. You know the man said to
[1:10:00] make rock in front of the place. You
[1:10:01] know the camera start to come. Twitter
[1:10:03] start to light up. Hallelujah. Facebook
[1:10:07] people start to stream this thing. You
[1:10:08] know the man jumping and shouting and
[1:10:10] leaping and carrying. You know people
[1:10:12] come and want to worship Peter and start
[1:10:14] think hold. Sit down. Sit down for a
[1:10:17] minute.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; He said you think is my holiness. This
[1:10:20] man
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; don't go there. You know
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; tell that now
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; them ministers want the people to go
[1:10:28] there.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Peter say it's not me. is not my
[1:10:33] holiness. It's faith in Jesus name.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; This man is made whole.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm saying God is going to be
[1:10:40] with you.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I can't believe that for you. You have
[1:10:46] to believe that for yourself.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Now, when you leave here, God is going
[1:10:51] with you. You have to believe these
[1:10:53] signs shall follow. If your children
[1:10:56] don't want prayer, pray for them when
[1:10:57] they're sleeping.
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:03] There are one prayer not praying the
[1:11:05] devil deceiving you. Pray anyhow.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. When they sleeping, when
[1:11:10] they sn go over them if you can't touch
[1:11:13] them and lay hands upon them, put your
[1:11:14] hand over them. Say, "Lord God, the
[1:11:16] anointing is in my hands. I'm coming to
[1:11:19] pray." Praise God. Lord Jesus, deliver
[1:11:22] them in Jesus name.
[1:11:24] Every devil in hell know you're praying.
[1:11:27] Oh God, hallelujah. God want you to act
[1:11:29] upon your prayer. When Daniel was
[1:11:31] praying, the angel was coming. The
[1:11:34] prophet said, "Stop praying. The angel
[1:11:35] has to stop coming. Your angel is on his
[1:11:37] way." Come on, give the Lord a shout in
[1:11:39] the house. Your angel deliverance is on
[1:11:42] his way. Don't stop praying.
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; This coat
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; is hardly coated. This quote is hardly
[1:12:00] spoken
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; but this quote is from God
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; because man can't operate this.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; You see man can operate mysteries. Man
[1:12:09] can operate revelations and bring
[1:12:10] information
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; but said I'll say it again. See how wrap
[1:12:14] up. I believe that the age has come now.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; The miraculous
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; the phenomenal. The baptism of the
[1:12:22] spirit and power and signs and wonders.
[1:12:24] this great pouring out of God's spirit
[1:12:28] in the last days.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; If I preach for 4 hours and I give no
[1:12:35] room for the spirit
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; to pour out is Theo unfolding out,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; sharing out, talking out. There's no
[1:12:44] room
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; and singing two specials after a
[1:12:47] service. That's not the spirit pouring
[1:12:49] out.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That is like a replacement for that.
[1:12:52] Then
[1:12:54] What we want to see is while Peter yet
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; spake these words,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; fell,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; not talk, fell. He was talking word, but
[1:13:07] the Holy Ghost was falling.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost have fallen on the grass. God
[1:13:11] has said the Holy Ghost fall on carpet
[1:13:13] and bench and pews. He called send the
[1:13:15] Holy Ghost to fall on humans,
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; to fall on hearts.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; This man wasn't had a spoken word with
[1:13:21] book. This man wasn't even baptized in
[1:13:23] Jesus name. This man never went to a
[1:13:25] church. He was just giving, giving,
[1:13:27] giving, giving till heaven records how
[1:13:29] he gives.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen now.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Because you're stingy.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; He was not stingy then.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; He was a free giver.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; He was giving offerings. Giving, giving,
[1:13:40] giving, giving, giving. The Bible call
[1:13:42] it arms.
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And God recorded that.
[1:13:54] Peter
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; by pos being positionally placed by the
[1:13:58] Holy Ghost itself
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; was now a channel of God
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; to bring life from his lips. What Adam
[1:14:05] was supposed to have
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; what Adam was supposed to release. Adam
[1:14:09] was supposed to have sons just like him,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; word and spirit, image and likeness.
[1:14:14] Adam didn't get that opportunity because
[1:14:16] his wife throw him down. Or let's say
[1:14:18] this way. He follow his wife
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; out of Eden.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; But here is Peter. He's restored.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Power is now in his lips.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Eternal life coming out of his lips.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He don't even know what's inside of him
[1:14:30] fully.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; God sent him to continue house. And he
[1:14:33] don't know what the manifestation will
[1:14:34] be.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; He begin to testify.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And as he testify, Holy Ghost,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; the word he was testifying was seed.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; The word he was testifying was God. And
[1:14:46] the spirit bear witness of the word
[1:14:49] coming out of his mouth and they were
[1:14:51] filled with the Holy Ghost before they
[1:14:53] were baptized in Jesus name.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; God could fill you before you get
[1:14:57] baptized. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:15:00] Cornel's heart was right. He was just.
[1:15:04] He was devout. Oh give the Lord some
[1:15:07] praises. He wasn't a rascal. He wasn't a
[1:15:10] scamp.
[1:15:13] And God recognized his faith.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; So don't ever forget this
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; great outpouring of his spirit.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; That's the thing
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; that will bring faith into the people.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So after the mysteries is preached
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; or taught.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; We're not against mysteries or
[1:15:33] teachings.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; But after the mysteries is preached and
[1:15:35] thought,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; taught, then the spirit have to come
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; to fall upon that. Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You have a seed, you could give a seed
[1:15:44] in your house for 100 years, 50 years, a
[1:15:46] corn seed,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; nothing happening to that seed
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; until you put it in the ground and put
[1:15:50] some water on it.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That seed will grow.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; And he says, "So shall my word be
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; that come out my mouth." Just like that
[1:15:58] seed. Oh, give the Lord a shout. You
[1:16:01] have to begin to speak.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You have to begin to say. You can't be
[1:16:05] no dumb dog in Israel. Open your mouth
[1:16:07] and give God some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah. You can't talk this shy talk
[1:16:12] and you can't talk talk. You can't talk
[1:16:13] that talk. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Let me see how we can close off here.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I don't really want to close, you know.
[1:16:24] I'm telling you
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; this age started just at the turn of
[1:16:32] 20th century as it is to be the age in
[1:16:35] which the true church get the prophecy
[1:16:38] would return to being the bride she was
[1:16:41] at Pentecost.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; We know that there must of necessity be
[1:16:48] a return of dynamic power.
[1:16:51] The believers sense this in their
[1:16:52] spirits
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; and begin to cry out to God
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; for a new outpouring such as was in the
[1:16:59] first century.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; What seemed to be the answer came as
[1:17:04] many begin to speak in tongues manifest
[1:17:06] gifts of the spirit. It was then
[1:17:09] believed that this was indeed a long
[1:17:11] awaited restoration.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It was not.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the latter rain prophecy now
[1:17:18] can only come after the former rain
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; which is the spring or teaching
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; rain.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; The latter rain then is the harvest
[1:17:27] rain.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Do you understand now?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; The latter rain is what?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Harvest rain.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Watch.
[1:17:36] How could this be the real thing when
[1:17:39] the teaching rain had not come? Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet messenger who was to be sent
[1:17:46] to teach the people
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; and turn the hearts of the church back
[1:17:49] to the Pentecostal father had not yet
[1:17:51] come.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Thus what was taught to be the
[1:17:55] restoration
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; and final quickening unto the rapture
[1:18:00] had not come.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; So he's saying 1906 Pentecost
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; that was not the bride
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; because the teaching didn't come yet.
[1:18:08] How the harvest rain couldn't come
[1:18:10] because the teaching didn't come. The
[1:18:12] teaching is to put seed in you. The
[1:18:14] harvest is to bring spirit upon you.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The teaching is seed. Harvest is spirit.
[1:18:20] But look at where we are right now. We
[1:18:23] are in 2025. Elas is already come. We
[1:18:26] have had 50 plus years of teaching. When
[1:18:29] are we going to get this harvest rain? I
[1:18:32] want to prophesy to you. The harvest
[1:18:34] rain is on its way. Get ready. Get
[1:18:37] ready. Get ready. Glory to God. I read
[1:18:39] it to you in the scripture. It shall
[1:18:41] come to pass afterwards.
[1:18:43] I will pour out my spirit. After the
[1:18:46] teaching, after the explaining, after
[1:18:49] the revealing, after the time of the
[1:18:51] revelation of these things being made
[1:18:53] known, I'm going to pour out my spirit.
[1:18:56] Are you ready? Ready or not, it's
[1:18:58] coming.
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Be seated.
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:06] Watch this.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Thus, what was thought
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; to be the restoration of the final
[1:19:12] quickening
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; unto the rapture had not come.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; It was a mixture, Here we go. of the
[1:19:17] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[1:19:20] blessing
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; and manifesting in the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; As we keep pointing it out to you,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; in it also was devil power.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; As men were under the control of devils,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; yet no one seemed to realize it.
[1:19:35] Then to prove it was not real.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; These people
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; even before the second generation had
[1:19:41] appeared
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; organized and wrote their unscriptural
[1:19:45] doctrines and built their own fences as
[1:19:47] each other group ahead of them.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; So fences is a sign
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; of the noal spirit
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; and that is what these pastors have done
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; in the message.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; They build wrong fences as if those
[1:19:59] believers belong to them.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; But the seventh angel
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; holding the vial said, "Come, I will
[1:20:06] show thee the bride, the lamb's wife."
[1:20:10] Oh, give the Lord a shout. You don't
[1:20:12] belong to no man.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; You are not my wife. My wife's name is
[1:20:16] Anmarie. Behave yourself. Give the Lord
[1:20:19] some praises. Give the Lord a shout in
[1:20:21] the house.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are not my wife. Get
[1:20:24] that in your head.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Well, you know the the church is the
[1:20:28] wife of the pastor. Yeah. In context.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; But my wife is not you. My wife is
[1:20:34] Anmarie.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Still in love with my wife.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is this. You don't
[1:20:41] belong to no man.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You belong to Christ.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the body. Call the
[1:20:46] church.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Christ have no mini head. You know,
[1:20:49] small head under the head.
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Too much of beef on parade.
[1:21:01] too much of flesh.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; We need to see less of man
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; and more of God.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; The word have to come in such a way that
[1:21:08] men die out
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and you see God come on the scene
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; that God could speak to you. What you
[1:21:14] know is God speaking to you.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was on earth,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; so was Judas.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; All right, I won't skip down.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:29] Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; The people of God are being made ready
[1:21:39] by the truth. Word of truth from the
[1:21:42] messenger of the age.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; In her talking about the bride will be
[1:21:47] the fullness of Pentecost.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hear the bum. Sister June.
[1:21:53] For
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; will bring the people
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; right back to where they were at the
[1:22:00] beginning.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I am convinced
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; we're going to have another book of
[1:22:08] Acts.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And before you have a book of Acts, you
[1:22:12] have to have another day of Pentecost.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; The day of Pentecost is what wrote
[1:22:19] another book of Acts.
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] Glory. You may be seated.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Now comes the weight of what you keep
[1:22:29] hearing over and over. When a church is
[1:22:31] groaning
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; under the groaning of the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost is just as real
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; as it was in the Pentecost when they are
[1:22:39] born and positionally born. Then God
[1:22:40] said in the church, there's got to
[1:22:42] people in this message that believe the
[1:22:43] Holy Ghost is just as real. And no more
[1:22:45] than Holy Ghost. No message Holy Ghost.
[1:22:47] It's the same Holy Ghost.
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:53] Watch this.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; When Cornelius went back
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; to the other apostles and disciples,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; he told them,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; "These Cornelius people, they receive
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; the same Holy Ghost
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; that we receive."
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It was sons begotten sons
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; because Peter was in the body.
[1:23:18] The sea germ was in Peter.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Peter was a channel of life.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Even though the angel direct Peter to go
[1:23:25] to continuous, the angel couldn't
[1:23:27] release the germ
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; because the germ have to come from the
[1:23:30] body.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And Peter was part of the body. Peter
[1:23:33] had life resident in him.
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Do you get this?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand this?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; From Peter mouth b another son.
[1:23:49] Adam was supposed to speak for a son
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and Eve conceived and produced a son
[1:23:53] just like Adam
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; by word and spirit.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; God used nothing else. He said, "Let
[1:23:58] there be men in image and likeness."
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Then God in Genesis do get a dust man
[1:24:02] and throw the first man inside of there.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Other flesh man you're seen here. Now
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; first message Jesus come, he must be
[1:24:09] born again.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Word and spirit had to come forth. But a
[1:24:13] bron come and he come about word and
[1:24:15] spirit and spoke original seed
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; because the word was lost. So we
[1:24:18] couldn't get the true birth
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; until the word was found or the word was
[1:24:22] restored and God promised to restore all
[1:24:24] the conqueror woman that cut up in a
[1:24:26] locust. All them guys eat down and God
[1:24:28] said I'm going to bring it all back.
[1:24:29] Nothing going to stop this. I feel good
[1:24:32] this morning. I feel anointed with a
[1:24:34] spirit of restoration, a spirit of
[1:24:36] reconciliation. Oh, glory to God. Go get
[1:24:40] that bride. Hallelujah. Go get your
[1:24:43] loved ones.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close music, please.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Could you take a little more? You're
[1:24:54] tired.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; But George tell me go ahead. When you
[1:25:00] see brother George stand up and say go
[1:25:02] ahead. That's a serious thing. You can't
[1:25:04] That's not an idol thing at all. That's
[1:25:06] a rare thing.
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:11] All right, let's go. It says God is
[1:25:13] going to restore. The Luther age did not
[1:25:15] restore the church.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; It started a reformation.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; The res age did not restore. The
[1:25:19] Pentecostal age did not restore. But God
[1:25:22] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[1:25:24] word. This is not the resurrection of
[1:25:26] the church. This is the restoration.
[1:25:30] God will take the church right back to
[1:25:32] Pentecost of the beginning.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:36] Who said that? God said that. God said
[1:25:40] that.
[1:25:42] I don't care what the message we're
[1:25:43] teaching and preaching. God said that.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I want that.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; What about you? I want that. The same
[1:25:50] Holy Ghost, the same fire.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; See, what Abraham teach us? Somebody
[1:25:59] come to the Lord, they have a snake in
[1:26:01] their heart.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Not have a old snake.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; They accept the Lord. The snake is
[1:26:06] there. Hallelujah.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; They repent. The snake still there.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; They baptize in water. They come up. The
[1:26:10] snake is there.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; That snake will move my fire.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost come and blast that
[1:26:15] snake out,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; snake gone.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Then the dove could come and just drop
[1:26:19] inside your heart.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; If any man be in Christ, new creature,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; new behavior, no attitude. Nobody here
[1:26:25] fighting just saying, "I come to church.
[1:26:27] I know God long. I had I cut my hair. I
[1:26:31] I had to come on my knees." You have no
[1:26:33] fight at all. You You lost that fight.
[1:26:36] When I come to the Lord, I had a
[1:26:37] girlfriend. I drop it like a hot potato.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Because I come to the Lord, my heart,
[1:26:41] desire, everything change. So she look
[1:26:43] different. Mom, I she see different
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and I know what I seen is not what I
[1:26:50] wanted.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; What if I hold on to what I want? What
[1:26:54] what I seeing?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I never meet up with man.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; But I had to let her go.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I said bye-bye.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; You second boy. I come to the Christ
[1:27:04] when she her boyfriend.
[1:27:06] Go on.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; When you see you come to the Lord and
[1:27:11] Satan loses or he lost you know
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; but he don't see you as lost. He say as
[1:27:16] a runaway one

[1:41:32] The time is at hand for you to be filled
[1:41:35] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:41:37] fire. We've waited long in the vineyard,
[1:41:40] but now the hour come. We have a more
[1:41:43] short of prophecy. I will restore. Oh,

[1:41:50] expectation today? Oh, we are filled

[1:43:08] unspeakable

[1:43:15] Father, Lord, we feel sure of it today.

[1:43:22] in our lives. We come now, Lord, to

[1:43:29] your feet, Lord. Praying that you, the
[1:43:30] God of all things, word to bless us and
[1:43:33] help us, Father. Bless your people as

[1:43:37] they give unto your house. May you bless
[1:43:38] them. May you bless your house. May you
[1:43:40] bless the labors here, Lord, in the
[1:43:43] ministry here, Father, as they continue
[1:43:45] to put these things together for the
[1:43:47] kingdom of God. Grant it all, Almighty
[1:43:50] God. We we pray this blessing in Jesus
[1:43:52] Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise
[1:43:56] God. As they hand it out, let's sing it.
[1:43:58] Oh Lord, well now, Lord, send the rain.
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:04] Pour out your spirit.
[1:44:08] Oh, let the fire.
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:16] Oh Lord, oh Lord, we are the ones called
[1:44:24] my own. You say, "Lord, we are the one
[1:44:29] who we humble ourselves now and we pray.
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] Ooh, recounting every sin and wicked
[1:44:44] way." You sing every sing
[1:44:49] lift our voices, seek your face, and
[1:44:53] say,
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:57] "Lord, send the rain.
[1:45:00] Oh, won't you pour out your spirit?
[1:45:05] Oh, and let the fire fall. Fill us one
[1:45:10] and all. Oh, pour fresh on me.
[1:45:14] Lord, send rain, oh Lord, send rain.
[1:45:19] Oh, pour out. Oh, pour out your spirit.
[1:45:25] Oh, and let the fire fall. Fill us one
[1:45:29] and all. Oh, fall fresh on me. Oh, Lord,
[1:45:34] send the rain. Lord, send the rain.
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:39] Oh, you pour out your spirit.
[1:45:45] Oh, let the fire fall. Fill us one and
[1:45:49] all. Oh, fall fresh on me. Oh, one more
[1:45:54] time. Oh, sing it low and send the rain.
[1:45:58] Oh, pour out your spirit. Pour out.
[1:46:02] Let the fire fall.
[1:46:06] Oh, fill us one and all. Oh, fall fresh
[1:46:10] on me. Oh, one more time. Oh, Lord, oh
[1:46:17] let us send rain today.
[1:46:20] Pour out your spirit.
[1:46:23] Oh, and let the fire fall. Oh, fill us
[1:46:27] all. Oh, fall fresh on. Give the Lord a
[1:46:31] shout of praise. Lift your hand and
[1:46:32] worship him. Hallelujah. Oh Lord,
[1:46:36] send the rain. Lord, send the rain. Lord
[1:46:39] Jesus, send the rain. Oh God, send the
[1:46:43] rain on me. Oh Lord, send the rain. Oh
[1:46:46] God, send the rain. Hallelujah. We need

[1:47:05] Oh, tell us one another
[1:47:08] for fresh on him.
[1:47:14] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Give him
[1:47:17] praise, glory,
[1:47:19] glory, glory, glory. The shout of the
[1:47:22] king is in the camp. Can we give the
[1:47:23] Lord a shout of praise? What an
[1:47:25] atmosphere. What a move of the spirit.
[1:47:29] What an anointing to follow the word.
[1:47:33] What a time in the presence of the Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you, one of these days the
[1:47:38] service will just not be normal.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; God will just break the routine, break
[1:47:42] what your expectation is and do
[1:47:44] something exceedingly abundantly above.
[1:47:47] And that's what he promised to do above
[1:47:49] what we could even ask or even think.
[1:47:52] And there are many things we think
[1:47:53] because of what we have heard in the
[1:47:55] word. And God intends to beat that
[1:47:57] thinking to do exceedingly abundantly
[1:48:00] above anything you could ask, anything
[1:48:03] you could think. He's going higher than
[1:48:05] that. What a mighty God we serve. Can we
[1:48:07] give the Lord a hand of praise?
[1:48:12] Amen.
[1:48:14] We have three
[1:48:16] prayer requests we want to bring before
[1:48:18] the Lord.
[1:48:24] From Sister Rebecca Thomas, I'd like to
[1:48:26] ask the church to remember my family and
[1:48:28] I in prayer.
[1:48:31] Also for our company as we are
[1:48:34] experiencing a financial crisis, we want
[1:48:36] to remember our sister in prayer
[1:48:41] from sister Kangali. Please remember
[1:48:42] Steven Kangali in prayer. He's done with
[1:48:45] the virus
[1:48:47] and also from brother George Kangali.
[1:48:51] I've been diagnosed with a lung
[1:48:53] condition called bronchiais.
[1:48:56] I'm sure I said that correctly.
[1:48:58] Medicine has not found a cure but God is
[1:49:01] able. Please pray.
[1:49:03] And I could certainly say seeing brother
[1:49:06] George on fire like this, he's already
[1:49:07] declaring and walking in his healing,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; counting the things as not as though
[1:49:12] they were,
[1:49:13] thanking God in advance. And if there's
[1:49:16] anyone this morning you want to show by
[1:49:18] raising your hand as we approach the
[1:49:19] throne of grace. Maybe you were not able
[1:49:22] to put it down on paper, but there's a
[1:49:24] desire in your heart, a need, be it
[1:49:26] financial, be it health, be it something
[1:49:29] in your home, a situation that you're
[1:49:31] dealing with, something you could talk
[1:49:33] about, something you don't even want to
[1:49:35] talk about, though we want to take it to
[1:49:36] the Lord this morning in prayer as a
[1:49:39] church united, knowing that if two shall
[1:49:41] agree, touching anything, we could have
[1:49:43] what we ask for. Can we bow our heads
[1:49:45] for a word of prayer? Oh gracious
[1:49:47] heavenly father, what a fate we feel in
[1:49:49] the building this morning. Lord, to know
[1:49:52] that you promise to restore to restore
[1:49:54] all the years that the cankerorm and the
[1:49:57] caterpillar and the locust and the
[1:49:59] palmer worm. Lord, you promised to
[1:50:01] restore joy and peace and victory. Lord,
[1:50:03] you promised to restore us back to Eden.
[1:50:05] Father, Lord, they promise to take us
[1:50:07] into a condition, Father, where we could
[1:50:09] be raptured and we could experience a
[1:50:11] body change and through your prophet,
[1:50:14] you taught us how could we even have
[1:50:15] faith for a rapture if we cannot have
[1:50:18] faith for divine healing. So, Father, we
[1:50:19] are coming to you this morning looking
[1:50:22] for a miracle, a work of grace, a moving
[1:50:25] of the power of God, and a revelation
[1:50:27] and a recognition that on Calvary you
[1:50:30] already paid it all, Father. So we unite
[1:50:33] as a church this morning for every need,
[1:50:35] every cry, every plea, every request.
[1:50:38] Lord, from small to great, you are
[1:50:40] taking every request this morning. You
[1:50:43] taught us to cast all of our cares upon
[1:50:45] you. You are more than able to handle
[1:50:47] it, Father. So we bring our requests
[1:50:50] before you boldly to the throne of
[1:50:52] grace.
[1:50:53] knowing that you are ready to receive
[1:50:55] them this morning. Knowing that healing
[1:50:57] is a children's bread. Knowing that we
[1:50:59] are entitled and we have a right to ask
[1:51:01] this morning. Lord, he said we should
[1:51:03] ask anything in your name. We are
[1:51:05] signing our checks this morning. In the
[1:51:08] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:10] because you taught us in your name, Lord
[1:51:12] God, we can cast out devils. In your
[1:51:15] name, Father, Lord, the sick could be
[1:51:17] healed. So Lord, we bring the situation
[1:51:20] Lord with sister Rebecca Thomas Lord to
[1:51:22] remember our family in prayer Lord and
[1:51:24] for the financial crisis in her company
[1:51:26] Lord that you will change the situation
[1:51:28] around that you will work the situation
[1:51:30] out and you will get the honor and the
[1:51:32] glory in this situation. You know what
[1:51:34] we don't know. You know what has not
[1:51:36] been written here. But we hand the
[1:51:38] entire situation to you this morning. We
[1:51:41] bring brother Steven Kangali before you
[1:51:43] Lord down with the virus wherever he is
[1:51:46] right now. May the angel of the Lord
[1:51:48] touch him from the crown of his head to
[1:51:50] the soles of his feet. May healing move
[1:51:53] uh may healing rain pour upon him even
[1:51:55] now Lord and anyone else with the virus
[1:51:58] or anything like that. May healing rain
[1:52:00] move upon them now in the mighty name of
[1:52:02] Jesus Christ. And Lord for brother
[1:52:04] Kangali Lord with this condition that
[1:52:07] has been named Father. Lord we know
[1:52:09] every sickness has been named. Uh every
[1:52:11] demon has been named uh every
[1:52:13] principality has been named. Just as
[1:52:15] Goliath had a name, we say, "Who is this
[1:52:18] uncircumcised Philistine this morning
[1:52:20] that dare defy the army of the living
[1:52:22] God, Father, we unite in faith as the
[1:52:25] church of the living God. When medicine
[1:52:28] cannot find a cure, you are the cure.
[1:52:31] When the doctors don't know what it is,
[1:52:33] you know what it is, Father. Lord, may
[1:52:36] divine healing break upon him even now.
[1:52:38] May you touch him completely. May you
[1:52:41] heal him completely. May you deliver
[1:52:43] completely. May you restore completely
[1:52:45] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:52:48] already done. It's a finished work. It
[1:52:50] was finished on Calvary. And Lord,
[1:52:52] across the building, may you touch every
[1:52:54] son, every daughter, those on the
[1:52:56] internet, those downstairs. May the
[1:52:59] healing virtue of God. Move upon your
[1:53:02] people today
[1:53:04] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:06] Lord, may you bless your people. May you
[1:53:08] bless our pastor this morning. What a
[1:53:10] time in the presence of God. What a
[1:53:12] moving of uncction and inspiration, a
[1:53:15] burden to see the church rise. Go
[1:53:17] higher. Go deeper in love of God. Go
[1:53:20] higher in faith and revelation and be
[1:53:23] under expectation. May you strengthen
[1:53:24] him. May you bless his wife, the family.
[1:53:27] May you bless the officers, the helps,
[1:53:28] the governments, the church. May you
[1:53:30] bless the service this evening. May you
[1:53:32] bless the service this coming Wednesday.
[1:53:34] May you bless the Bible study this
[1:53:35] coming Friday. May you bring us back
[1:53:37] next Sunday. May you have the
[1:53:39] preeminence in our lives in the mighty
[1:53:41] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[1:53:43] church says
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And the church says
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated
[1:53:50] for a few announcements.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; God is moving.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Glory. Service continues this afternoon
[1:54:03] at 3 p.m. for the Lord's supper.
[1:54:07] This is part of not just being a
[1:54:11] believer, but this is a direct
[1:54:12] instruction from the Lord himself to do
[1:54:15] this in remembrance of me. So, we want
[1:54:18] to be part of that sacred vow, that
[1:54:20] sacred sacrament, that uh commitment
[1:54:23] that God requires from us. So, the
[1:54:25] Lord's supper at 3 p.m. this evening.
[1:54:28] Service continues on Wednesday evening,
[1:54:30] Wednesday night, Lord willing, at 8:00
[1:54:32] p.m. We encourage you to make an effort
[1:54:34] to be here. God is doing something
[1:54:36] tremendous and without question he will
[1:54:38] reward the sacrifice and the effort.
[1:54:42] Service continues this coming Friday at
[1:54:45] 8:00 p.m. we have our Bible study and
[1:54:47] we've had conversations around what the
[1:54:51] vision is for that. So we encourage you

[1:55:15] study. And this coming Sunday, invite
[1:55:18] someone out. Invite someone to the Bible
[1:55:20] study. And we are looking for God to do
[1:55:21] something tremendous for the people of
[1:55:23] God. We encourage you to continue to
[1:55:25] remember the ministry in prayer. Do
[1:55:28] remember one another in prayer by the
[1:55:30] grace of God. And I want to encourage
[1:55:32] you as well to pray for
[1:55:36] whatever desire you have in your heart.
[1:55:38] Men ought to pray and not to faint. Make
[1:55:40] it part of your daily practice to take
[1:55:43] it to the Lord in prayer. Maintenance

[1:56:00] a group, if you are so inclined to be
[1:56:03] part of what's taking place. Uh feel
[1:56:05] free to speak to brother Steven Olive or
[1:56:07] mention it to one of the deacons and
[1:56:08] we'll certainly be happy to have your
[1:56:10] support. We want you to take note that
[1:56:13] we will be having a church dinner in
[1:56:16] December. By next week, Lord willing, we
[1:56:18] will confirm the details, but we do want
[1:56:20] you to have it in the back of your mind
[1:56:22] that we intend to have a church dinner
[1:56:24] uh for the end of year this December.
[1:56:28] And do also remember those that are sick
[1:56:31] and afflicted and are needy among us as
