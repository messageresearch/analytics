[21:22] this is what this is all about this
[21:23] morning
[21:24] we going to do all what we got to do
[21:28] could we stand if you want to turn to
[21:30] the scriptures to james chapter two
[21:33] we want to read from verse 15 to 26 and
[21:36] one verse of saint john chapter 4 verse
[21:42] 34.
[21:47] thank you musicians thank you brother
[21:50] gideon for that
[21:52] inspiring worship
[21:56] this morning
[22:00] everything needs to be inspired the
[22:04] singing
[22:04] must be inspired the specials must be
[22:07] inspired the musicians
[22:09] must be inspired the choir must be
[22:11] inspired the people must be inspired
[22:14] and the preacher must be inspired and
[22:17] and when all that inspiration come
[22:19] together
[22:20] oh my god will be inspired
[22:27] reading james 2 reading from verse
[22:31] 15.
[22:36] if a brother or sister be naked and
[22:38] destitute of daily food and one of you
[22:40] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[22:44] and
[22:44] filled you speak in the word
[22:49] notwithstanding you give them not those
[22:51] things which are needful to the body
[22:53] what does it profit
[22:55] even so fate if it had not works
[22:58] is dead being alone yeah a man may say
[23:01] thou has faith
[23:02] and i have worked show me thy faith
[23:04] without thy works
[23:05] and i will surely my faith by my works
[23:09] don't believe us that there is one god
[23:11] don't do us well the devil also believe
[23:13] and tremble
[23:14] but will thou know o vain man that faith
[23:17] without works is dead
[23:18] wasn't abraham or father justified by
[23:20] works when he had
[23:22] offered isaac and his son upon the altar
[23:24] seeing thou
[23:25] how faith wrote with his works and by
[23:28] works was faith made perfect
[23:30] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[23:32] said abraham believed god
[23:35] and it was imputed unto him for
[23:37] righteousness and he was called
[23:39] a friend of god he see then
[23:42] how that by works a man is justified and
[23:45] not by faith only
[23:46] likewise also was not rehab the harlot
[23:49] justified by works
[23:50] when she had received the messengers and
[23:53] had sent them
[23:54] out another way for as the body without
[23:56] the spirit is dead
[23:58] so fate without works is death also
[24:02] a reading from saint john chapter four
[24:06] excuse me i want to read from
[24:10] one verse verse 34. and this is
[24:13] jesus disciples just before they came
[24:16] and said
[24:17] master eat he said i have meat to eat
[24:19] that you know i love
[24:22] and then verse 34 jesus said my meat is
[24:25] to do the will of him that sent me
[24:27] and to finish his work let's pray father
[24:29] we thank you for your word
[24:31] interpret it to our hearts inspire the
[24:33] word to your people
[24:34] and may this be a life-changing service
[24:36] lord may no one
[24:38] leave it the same way they came but may
[24:40] the word be
[24:41] effective to them in their spirits in
[24:44] their heart
[24:45] and may the word become flesh i may
[24:47] confirm the word with signs wonders and
[24:49] miracles
[24:49] but the anointing is so powerful that
[24:52] when they leave here
[24:53] it will go in their cars it will go in
[24:55] their houses it will go on the job
[24:57] wherever they go
[24:58] it will go with them and give them
[25:00] tremendous victory in jesus might ask it
[25:03] amen and amen you will be seated go
[25:06] praise the name of the lord
[25:08] blessed be the name of the lord i have a
[25:09] title
[25:11] my faith in god promises
[25:15] is expressed by my works
[25:18] my faith in god's promises
[25:21] is expressed by my works i have an
[25:24] inspiration
[25:26] doing all we can do
[25:29] now last week's the title was let us
[25:31] provoke one another to love
[25:33] and good works and
[25:37] we asked a question who is responsible
[25:40] for the bright seventh and the revival
[25:43] and i brought it to the part that you
[25:44] must play but there's a path that the
[25:47] ministers have to play and there's a
[25:49] part that god has to play
[25:51] so all together is what going to produce
[25:53] that bride's revival
[25:55] isn't that right and i have a thought i
[25:58] thought
[25:59] of god expect results and
[26:02] action is caused action don't
[26:05] just happen action is caused
[26:09] and today i want to introduce a new word
[26:11] which is like opposite to action that is
[26:13] caused
[26:14] and that new word is inertia i n
[26:18] e r t i e initial and we're going to
[26:21] find out a little bit
[26:22] in a while what that is now
[26:26] i just have this written here my
[26:27] commission this is me
[26:30] is to go into all the world and preach
[26:32] the gospel
[26:34] that is the instructions that jesus have
[26:36] given us
[26:38] so on the fields i know i'm in the will
[26:40] of god
[26:42] and but i say one once a minister is on
[26:44] the field he is
[26:46] in the will of god now i know i could
[26:49] stay in the newsroom
[26:50] and give comments on what is happening
[26:53] on the battlefront
[26:54] because that is what newsroom people do
[26:56] sometimes they have hurricane and
[26:58] earthquake and different things and
[26:59] somebody outside
[27:00] in a hurricane and they report into
[27:02] headquarters and the person in the
[27:04] studio did not get
[27:05] wet they are commenting on who is
[27:08] getting wet outside of the day
[27:09] and it's now we have a report from so
[27:12] and so on they could talk and sometimes
[27:13] have a big table
[27:14] and this one talking to this one and
[27:15] this one talking this one but they're
[27:16] not in a hurricane place
[27:18] they're not getting wet they're not
[27:19] feeling the breeze nothing in the storm
[27:21] they're just commenters
[27:22] or talkers or just uh that's all i'm
[27:25] saying
[27:26] i wasn't ordained to be in the newsroom
[27:29] praise god i wasn't
[27:30] ordained to be in the commentary box i
[27:33] was ordained to be a wrong
[27:35] morning edition along a table and people
[27:37] said on a couch and discuss what is
[27:39] happening
[27:39] no no no i am going to be on the
[27:41] battlefield
[27:42] for my lord hallelujah
[27:46] are you with me so therefore there are
[27:49] three kind of people those who are
[27:50] wondering what is happening
[27:52] those who are watching what is happening
[27:54] and do the commentators
[27:55] they're in the box they're watching what
[27:56] is happening and the last bunch
[27:59] is the part that i am in those who are
[28:01] causing things
[28:02] to happen now you've got to pick your
[28:05] you got to pick what you want to be
[28:07] identified with because everybody going
[28:10] to be identified
[28:11] one way or the other or give the lord
[28:13] some praises people hallelujah
[28:17] isn't that something so you ever always
[28:20] heard about a tax
[28:21] a task that was supposed to be done and
[28:24] everybody had a chance to do it
[28:26] anybody could have done it somebody
[28:28] thought anybody will do it
[28:30] but in the end nobody did it so
[28:32] everybody was looking for anybody
[28:33] and anybody thought somebody was going
[28:35] to do it so we don't want to be anybody
[28:38] and everybody and somebody knows
[28:39] somebody going to do the task
[28:41] because jesus said my meat is to do the
[28:43] will of him that sent me
[28:45] and to finish the work god will just
[28:47] have things
[28:48] god will just have talk god have things
[28:50] to fulfill
[28:52] jesus was a man with a mission that's
[28:54] why what brother branham said is this
[28:56] when god speaks to a man
[28:58] he gives that man ambition and purpose
[29:01] two things
[29:02] he gives that man ambition and purpose
[29:04] and when that man's got revelation
[29:06] one evidence you're gonna see is two
[29:08] things you're gonna see humility
[29:10] and fearlessness oh glory to god
[29:14] could we give the lord some amens to be
[29:16] give the lord a shout
[29:18] when god speaks to a man he gave him
[29:20] ambition and purpose
[29:21] and after that when god reveals himself
[29:24] he will see two things
[29:26] a humble man and a man praise god with
[29:28] the drive
[29:30] hallelujah fearless because he has been
[29:34] in the presence of god
[29:35] and he has heard from the lord oh glory
[29:38] to god that's when elijah stumped up
[29:40] he said not even you or rain will fall
[29:42] till i call for it
[29:44] i don't care what the weather is saying
[29:46] i don't care what the weather man is
[29:47] saying
[29:48] i don't care what the people are saying
[29:49] i shut up heavens
[29:51] and you had to wait till i called for it
[29:53] to get the rain that you're looking for
[29:56] i stop your blessings i stop the
[29:58] anointing
[29:59] i stop everything hallelujah heaven is
[30:02] shut until i
[30:02] call
[30:03] [Applause]
[30:06] that's when a man yes from god
[30:10] oh hallelujah oh glory coming to crunch
[30:13] time now
[30:14] this is when the tire hit the road it's
[30:16] coming to crunch time now
[30:17] when you have to choose whether it will
[30:19] be part of the solution
[30:21] or you'll be part of the problem because
[30:23] if you're not part of the solution
[30:24] you are simply part of the very problem
[30:27] itself
[30:28] but jesus said my meat is to do the will
[30:30] of him that sent me
[30:31] and to finish the work he just finished
[30:33] handing the woman at the well
[30:34] oh glory to god he sent his disciples
[30:36] because he couldn't let them see
[30:38] what he was about to do he was about to
[30:40] call a name in the book
[30:41] and he had to push them guys away to
[30:43] always they get to speak to this woman

[40:13] looking for that city it's not stop two
[40:15] children but you're looking for that
[40:16] city
[40:17] you're getting all but you're looking
[40:18] for that city degree here coming on but
[40:20] you're still looking
[40:21] for that city whose maker and builder is
[40:24] god
[40:25] oh john saw that city we are going to a
[40:28] city oh give the lord some praises
[40:31] people
[40:33] hallelujah praise god he said let's stay
[40:37] under the blood
[40:39] when that son had come to the age of 21
[40:42] we call it a day
[40:43] if the tutor had brought with the father
[40:46] and told him everything was fine
[40:48] this boy was a gallant man he was
[40:50] zealous here we go
[40:52] of the father's kingdom not just
[40:55] you know uh
[40:58] i don't even know who my father business
[41:00] is
[41:02] jesus could have said that when he was
[41:03] 12 years old he said i
[41:05] am about my father's
[41:08] business now if you are about your
[41:10] father's business it means you have to
[41:11] know the father's business
[41:13] you're getting a revelation of the
[41:14] father's will to execute the father's
[41:16] plan
[41:17] for business because sun has to be
[41:18] approved you can't be doing nothing and
[41:21] get approval
[41:22] there's no approval for nothing the holy
[41:25] ghost signing you off for nothing
[41:26] how was he he did nothing he prayed
[41:29] nothing he worshipped nothing
[41:30] he actually did nothing he just came and
[41:33] occupied a seat in
[41:34] church and worshipped sometimes i got
[41:36] how he felt
[41:37] he was never interested in seeking the
[41:39] father's business and reading the word
[41:41] to get the father's will
[41:42] for his life now watch watch
[41:46] that he was zealous of the father
[41:47] kingdom and he done all
[41:49] here we go he's done all he could
[41:53] to improve and in better the kingdom
[41:56] that is what the father is looking for
[41:59] hallelujah to see
[42:00] the sons that want to improve and better
[42:03] the kingdom
[42:04] then this boy the father take them out
[42:06] in the public place
[42:09] that means every true ordained
[42:12] predestinated
[42:13] ministry of god must become
[42:16] publicly identified
[42:23] it can't be hidden in a corner hiding
[42:26] under bushel
[42:27] saying god is with me no some point in
[42:30] time
[42:31] god himself will take the mask off of
[42:33] all of that
[42:35] he will push you into the position
[42:38] where you have to be publicly identified
[42:41] as
[42:41] his son
[42:46] jesus had 18 years of silence
[42:49] but when the silence was about to be
[42:51] broken god loosed
[42:53] john the baptist to make a way for that
[42:56] announcement
[42:57] that the sun is about to come forth so
[43:00] when john the baptist said behold the
[43:01] lamb of god
[43:02] god was ready to say this is my beloved
[43:05] son
[43:06] in whom i'm pleased to publicly identify
[43:09] myself with come on somebody
[43:13] i'm going to pull him out from the bunch
[43:16] i'm going to pull him out from the rest
[43:18] and let the world know i'm with him oh
[43:21] give the lord a shout the praise people
[43:23] that's what god gonna do for you one day
[43:25] that's what god is about to do for you
[43:28] maybe today is your day maybe today that
[43:30] fire that dove of identification
[43:32] gonna come down upon your life oh
[43:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:37] hallelujah are you ready
[43:41] the father take them out into a public
[43:43] place
[43:44] set him up before the public his same
[43:48] son that had been born in his home
[43:51] years before all the time his son
[43:55] here we go but his character and his
[43:58] conduct
[43:59] had brought him to another office
[44:03] notice not his summons
[44:07] not his mighty revelation
[44:10] an unfolding of many hidden mysteries
[44:13] [Music]
[44:16] no his character
[44:19] and his conduct had brought him into
[44:23] another
[44:23] office or position
[44:27] so all these messages is only
[44:30] part of it
[44:38] so god is not so much interested in the
[44:39] newsroom dictation
[44:41] and reading the script off of the prom
[44:43] screen
[44:45] ah something kind of good behind
[44:48] her as the news coming in the slaving
[44:50] the news station
[44:51] she's reading off of a screen
[44:55] this is happening that is happening you
[44:56] can't get character reading off a screen
[45:00] you're reading news in the newsroom
[45:03] to get director you have to get up the
[45:05] newsroom
[45:07] i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you
[45:10] reading quotes that's that connect the
[45:12] newsroom but when you're loosed
[45:15] into the situations and they could come
[45:17] true
[45:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[45:22] my god because character is a victory
[45:26] glory to god you've got to overcome
[45:28] something
[45:29] that means god has designed conflict we
[45:32] need conflict
[45:33] we need battles we need sword fighting
[45:37] we need issues because that is how
[45:39] character
[45:40] comes forward okay my god i don't feel
[45:43] like preaching
[45:48] glory hallelujah hallelujah
[45:52] hallelujah i told them in europe there
[45:54] are plenty people who don't like battles
[45:57] they don't like confusion they don't
[45:58] like to hurt anyone
[46:01] they still have anyone so they have no
[46:04] stand
[46:05] they don't ever sit they stand for
[46:08] nothing
[46:10] they have no witness in their mouth they
[46:12] please everybody
[46:14] they take no sides they hurt nobody
[46:18] they end up like dish rag you see i want
[46:21] the whole world to know what side i'm on
[46:24] i'm on the side of the word i will stand
[46:26] with any man who's with the world
[46:28] he don't even have to believe all that i
[46:30] believe but as much as he believed i
[46:32] will stand by him
[46:34] because the word is god i am not the
[46:37] revealer of the word
[46:38] the holy ghost is and if the holy ghost
[46:40] don't reveal it to that brother
[46:42] he can't get it because every man must
[46:45] minister
[46:45] according to the grace and fate that god
[46:48] gives that man
[46:49] and if god give me this small measure
[46:51] and give somebody a bigger measure
[46:53] god bless them but you see this little
[46:56] measure i have
[46:57] i'm going to use it because that's the
[46:59] measure god gave me
[47:05] glory you may be seated
[47:08] all those guys in the army had their
[47:10] sword some with nice hilt
[47:12] some with signature on it all of them
[47:15] sharps or some
[47:16] broad some silver hat sip some gold tip
[47:20] bronze tip what kind of tip
[47:21] and all david had was a little old sling
[47:24] and some stones
[47:25] just packing just in case he already
[47:28] killed a beer
[47:29] he already killed a lion in case a meat
[47:32] of anything
[47:33] i could handle myself i have something
[47:36] that i could use
[47:42] you may be seated that's the problem
[47:46] some of you have nothing to use
[47:51] safety bear come and call the pastor
[47:55] is the lion come you gotta call the
[47:56] elder
[47:58] if a mouse come and call your husband
[48:01] all right go there
[48:03] hallelujah but you have to call somebody
[48:05] because you're not prepared
[48:07] for issues and challenges you see if you
[48:10] understand this you would love
[48:12] when the issues hit you like that you
[48:14] will never back down
[48:15] you will say i born for this you know
[48:17] what it is to come back and meet your
[48:18] whole family taken

[48:22] all your mighty men depressed
[48:24] and discouraged and they want to stone
[48:26] you you know what the strategy that is
[48:29] but david encourage himself pull himself
[48:32] up by the bootstrap
[48:34] and sometimes you feel so battered and
[48:35] bruised so beat him to give up
[48:38] but don't give up not this morning not

[51:55] brought him into another position
[51:58] inertia
[52:01] let's deal with that word calling nature
[52:03] last week he did about action is cause
[52:05] i want to deal with another word word
[52:07] called inertia
[52:08] inertia is a tendency to do nothing
[52:12] or remain unchanged
[52:16] it speaks of inactivity passivity
[52:20] stagnation idleness
[52:23] sluggishness liturgy
[52:27] populity indolence
[52:31] laziness and slutfulness
[52:35] that is initial in
[52:38] physics it is a property of matter
[52:42] by which it continues in existence state
[52:45] of rest
[52:47] or uniform motion in a straight line
[52:51] unless that state is changed by an
[52:53] external force
[52:57] so in inertia means when that comes to a
[53:00] rest
[53:01] it stays rest it don't move
[53:04] it is rested nothing changes
[53:07] inertia means when it continues along
[53:09] the line it see the straightening
[53:12] same speed same time same channel
[53:15] no change whatsoever 20 years no change
[53:19] 30 years no change it's the inertia i
[53:22] come to challenge that break that
[53:24] bust that rip into that chop down that
[53:28] action is caused ignition could just
[53:31] happen
[53:31] we are here to cause something to happen
[53:34] the prophet will take up a rapid treat
[53:36] up in the air
[53:37] and don't come a whirlwind oh hallelujah
[53:44] [Applause]
[53:49] the tendency of a body to preserve its
[53:52] state of rest
[53:54] or uniform motion unless
[53:57] acted upon by an external
[54:01] force imagine what bahrain says if love
[54:03] don't get you
[54:04] desperate the external force will
[54:11] it also carries lack of movement
[54:14] or activity when movement or activity is
[54:18] wanted or needed
[54:20] a feeling of not having the energy
[54:24] or desire that is needed to move
[54:29] or change one of the saddest thing for
[54:33] me as a pastor
[54:34] is to talk to christians who don't want
[54:37] to change they are religious
[54:40] and they are spiritual but not happy
[54:43] spiritual are visiting they are
[54:45] spiritual but the discontented
[54:48] spiritual the thing they are because
[54:50] they are spirit and they love jesus
[54:55] but the thing to move them to where
[54:57] they're supposed to go
[55:00] they're not moving because this is
[55:02] always been all these years
[55:06] you call that inertia
[55:10] this is what i know and change is always
[55:13] hard hallelujah
[55:17] oh glory hallelujah
[55:20] moses know what willingness but you know
[55:22] what glenn land joshua
[55:24] was a man was the landman moses was
[55:26] pushed out into the wilderness
[55:28] and there's a beautiful scripture where
[55:30] jeju take him and lead him and
[55:31] she was seen about jethro's sheep
[55:34] leading sheep
[55:35] you think moses no he had to leave all
[55:37] them bunch of people out there moses
[55:38] were even thinking about going back
[55:40] and then leading sheep so god had to
[55:42] strip him
[55:43] humble him give her an experience not
[55:45] knowing all of this is background for
[55:47] what
[55:48] he's going to do
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:51] what if moses said i you know who i am
[55:53] jetro
[55:55] come on former prince of egypt
[55:58] and joshua said correct former
[56:04] [Applause]
[56:08] that's what you used to have this is not
[56:10] egypt you're in my territory
[56:12] and you see my daughter there she's a
[56:14] nice lady
[56:17] so relax herself settle down
[56:20] and he gets settled down leading sheep
[56:23] no burden for egypt then they own back
[56:26] there
[56:27] until the lord called out to him
[56:30] in the burden bush but before god called
[56:33] unto him
[56:34] the god sent the attraction to see if he
[56:36] will turn aside and see
[56:37] and the bible says when he turn aside to
[56:39] see because some people are even taken
[56:41] aside
[56:41] they're so fixed in their ways and
[56:43] inertia all kind of things happening all
[56:45] around them but they're going down one
[56:47] way one way one way
[56:49] you got to turn some point in time i
[56:50] hope this service is a turning point
[56:52] a changing point a different kind of
[56:56] point
[57:00] yeah the devil condemned you of what you
[57:02] did on your past and what not
[57:04] turn aside to see what god is trying to
[57:07] tell you because you want you delivered
[57:09] if your mind is crippled up your spirit
[57:11] is crippled up you you up
[57:16] your side to see when you're telling us
[57:19] to see god spoke to moses and said moses
[57:21] time up fella
[57:23] head down to egypt new commission for
[57:26] you
[57:27] hallelujah go down and bring the people
[57:28] out hallelujah moses i don't make
[57:31] excuses
[57:32] lord i can't talk lord you know what it
[57:34] is i settle down right now i get new
[57:35] furniture i have a new tent
[57:37] i'm a crook i have new goats i have a
[57:40] whole fresh block of sheep and so on and
[57:42] lambs and so on
[57:43] but business going real good god said
[57:45] you didn't hear what i said
[57:46] uh do i have to repeat myself we pack up
[57:49] shop and get down to egypt and bring my
[57:51] people out
[57:53] then when moses started to accept watch
[57:55] that would accept now
[57:56] accept that there's nobody else could do
[57:58] what he has to do and when you begin to
[58:00] accept that nobody else could do
[58:01] what you have to do stop running
[58:06] and accept responsibility that you have
[58:09] got a job
[58:11] hallelujah
[58:15] when when moses recognized god not
[58:16] taking no excuses
[58:18] moses had to talk differently who shall
[58:20] i seize on me
[58:25] who who because this is both of us
[58:27] talking here now but when i get down
[58:29] there
[58:29] i mean what i will tell them
[58:33] you should tell them i am tell them i am
[58:36] that i am sent
[58:37] you you saw someone say good ago

[59:07] long journey

[1:03:02] glory hallelujah
[1:03:05] you may be seasoned so i want you to
[1:03:07] move
[1:03:09] from this inertia from this continue
[1:03:12] along the same path
[1:03:14] and get into activity into movement
[1:03:19] into becoming a dynamo because from that
[1:03:22] directive is where you get the word
[1:03:23] dynamics
[1:03:25] come from dynamo is to be in constant
[1:03:28] motion
[1:03:29] to produce a result isn't that right
[1:03:32] you got to have a movement in order to
[1:03:35] get something going for you
[1:03:37] you've got to have a stern up a worship
[1:03:40] up
[1:03:40] a praise up you've got to do something
[1:03:43] jesus said the works that i do
[1:03:45] shall you do also we are talking about
[1:03:48] works
[1:03:49] let's call it this way we talk enough i
[1:03:52] said talk done
[1:03:55] holy love god we're going to do
[1:03:57] something about all this talk
[1:04:00] that we talk that's why we're having a
[1:04:01] prayer line next week
[1:04:06] we are we are serving notice that we are
[1:04:08] going to do more than just preach
[1:04:10] we're going to pray we're going to cast
[1:04:12] devils out we are saying it before it
[1:04:14] happened
[1:04:15] we are going to heal the sick yes
[1:04:19] we have authority to do that yes
[1:04:23] how many believe that
[1:04:28] my god all right
[1:04:32] so works but abandoned preach is faith
[1:04:35] expressed works show that faith
[1:04:39] has already took a hole and paul
[1:04:42] wrote about justifying abraham by what
[1:04:45] god saw in abraham which is fate
[1:04:47] and james justified abraham by works and
[1:04:50] people thought it was a conflict or
[1:04:51] argument
[1:04:52] but then the prophet brought out that
[1:04:55] one was what god sees
[1:04:57] and the other is what man sees so the
[1:04:59] thing of it is this
[1:05:01] if you claim to have faith that's what
[1:05:02] god sees they have to be works to prove
[1:05:06] and bring evidence of the faith that you
[1:05:08] claim to have
[1:05:09] and if the word is bringing faith to you
[1:05:11] there got to be evidence
[1:05:12] by your work by your life by your
[1:05:15] actions and attitude
[1:05:16] that faith has truly taken a whole so if
[1:05:18] we don't see a behavior
[1:05:20] that matches up with the faith you claim
[1:05:22] then you maybe don't have the faith that
[1:05:24] you claim
[1:05:24] because once that faith inside of you
[1:05:26] take a whole there's a behavior
[1:05:28] that goes with it the bible said abraham
[1:05:31] started not at the promise of god
[1:05:32] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:05:35] giving praise to
[1:05:36] god so when faith take a hold it give
[1:05:38] praises
[1:05:39] the evidence of faith is the ability to
[1:05:41] worship
[1:05:42] because you can't be condemned and
[1:05:43] worshipped so when all condemnation is
[1:05:46] ripped out of you
[1:05:47] faith taking the whole of you going to
[1:05:49] give god praise
[1:05:51] because faith is saying it's already
[1:05:53] done
[1:05:56] faith have no need to be worried
[1:06:00] because faith is the very substance of
[1:06:03] what
[1:06:04] you're hoping for for
[1:06:07] good faith is already the victory
[1:06:11] you ready to see that so watch this the
[1:06:14] people depressed
[1:06:15] david man they want to stone him david
[1:06:17] said you know what let me go and seek
[1:06:18] the lord and call himself he go on and
[1:06:20] go to listen go push you you'll get back
[1:06:23] all
[1:06:24] david comedy smiling
[1:06:30] put a jaw a while ago he's depressed
[1:06:32] he's discouraged
[1:06:33] he is struggling and after god speak to
[1:06:35] him he's smiling
[1:06:37] his wife is not there yet but he's
[1:06:38] smiling his children
[1:06:40] but he's smiling the people has not
[1:06:42] retained it but he is smiling
[1:06:44] why faith is the victory and
[1:06:47] faith listen is a revelation from god
[1:06:53] come on now
[1:06:57] that is why people love group revelation
[1:07:00] they like to hide because
[1:07:01] it saves them the burden of seeking god
[1:07:03] it saves them but guess what
[1:07:05] that's a group thing and faith never
[1:07:08] belongs to a group
[1:07:10] faith never god never gave a group a
[1:07:12] revelation
[1:07:13] so when the pastors mess up the people
[1:07:15] and inductionize them for a personal
[1:07:17] gain
[1:07:18] manipulate them all the group the old
[1:07:20] bunch saying the same thing
[1:07:23] and sometimes it plumb off the word of
[1:07:25] god that's why jesus would
[1:07:27] say i am some say you're there some say
[1:07:29] that men always have opinions
[1:07:30] men always have interpretation men
[1:07:32] always have ideas
[1:07:33] i can't do what other brothers doing i
[1:07:36] i'm don't get it brahms says some
[1:07:38] culture is oats some call the red sheep
[1:07:40] some call her with goats he said the
[1:07:41] reason we can't be placed
[1:07:42] is because this one want to do what i
[1:07:44] want doing so god blessing that brother
[1:07:46] with corn and everyone
[1:07:47] on the planet corn too god say you're
[1:07:48] not called to plant corn
[1:07:50] your land is not a corn land your land
[1:07:53] is to go grass to feed the sheep
[1:07:55] grow your grass and feed your sheep let
[1:07:57] that other brother see what is corn
[1:08:00] come on say him and somebody said god
[1:08:02] give me corn leave me with the corn
[1:08:05] hallelujah glory to god it's that simple
[1:08:10] give the lord a shout of praise i am not
[1:08:12] in defend with nobody
[1:08:14] don't interfere with me messing with the
[1:08:17] wrong guy
[1:08:18] oh hallelujah glory to god in it
[1:08:26] hallelujah you may be seated so watch
[1:08:30] listen brother branham he's saying they
[1:08:32] are pentecost they say these men are
[1:08:33] full of new wine
[1:08:34] it was a great thing to do as it was
[1:08:36] happening too why
[1:08:38] it was god listen revealing himself to
[1:08:41] individuals
[1:08:42] yet was a hundred and twenty in the
[1:08:44] upper room but was god
[1:08:46] here we go reveal themselves to
[1:08:48] individuals
[1:08:49] noted it wasn't a group baptism
[1:08:51] everybody gave the liquor fire
[1:08:56] the baby said tongues of fire sat on
[1:08:59] each on every one of them
[1:09:00] everyone got their portion
[1:09:06] so when mary got a portion she didn't
[1:09:07] feel like to preach
[1:09:13] she feel led to make a nice apple pie
[1:09:15] you know what i'm saying
[1:09:17] all right so the anointing have to come
[1:09:20] to produce what god said supposed to
[1:09:22] produce okay
[1:09:24] now here we go here we go noah works
[1:09:27] expressed to man
[1:09:28] what his faith was in god's promise they
[1:09:31] couldn't see noah's fate they could see
[1:09:33] him building a act
[1:09:34] so man could say wait a minute he's
[1:09:36] serious he is acting upon what he
[1:09:38] believes
[1:09:39] now here we go david the shepherd sling
[1:09:41] expressed to the whole israelite army
[1:09:43] the faith he had in their god notice
[1:09:46] when it's revealed david become fearless
[1:09:51] so when i see people frightened and
[1:09:52] scared when i see minnesota shaking
[1:09:54] and they're saying things because they
[1:09:55] don't want to upset the apple god
[1:09:59] i know they do have a relationship
[1:10:02] they just follow him you see because
[1:10:05] they don't want to
[1:10:06] be punished
[1:10:10] because the food bowl might be taken
[1:10:12] away
[1:10:13] and they crack the preaching of the
[1:10:14] convention
[1:10:19] and if they need the attention of a
[1:10:22] convention
[1:10:24] they have to conform to the group
[1:10:27] theology
[1:10:29] to fit in but you know what
[1:10:32] the people have been denied genuine
[1:10:35] operation of gifts
[1:10:37] to minister effectively to the people
[1:10:40] by people trying to tell them what to
[1:10:41] preach and what inspiration to preach
[1:10:44] we don't need all of that all of us are
[1:10:46] different anthony is different from
[1:10:47] isaac eisen from me
[1:10:49] all different ministers they're
[1:10:50] different we want the difference
[1:10:58] we want that difference because that
[1:11:00] difference is how
[1:11:01] we could get the help you all sitting
[1:11:04] here everybody here don't have the same
[1:11:05] need
[1:11:07] can i hear a big man i am preaching here
[1:11:10] but everybody here don't have the same
[1:11:12] need
[1:11:13] then another minister come and preach
[1:11:14] and meet this one need another man
[1:11:16] preached means this one need

[1:11:33] for you he said the revelation and the
[1:11:34] hidden mysteries
[1:11:36] are for us to be able to know how to
[1:11:38] bring the members of our body
[1:11:40] in subjection to the word to know how to
[1:11:43] conduct ourselves
[1:11:44] the mystery is not to just argue and
[1:11:45] talk about behind mysteries i know more
[1:11:47] than you
[1:11:48] i am more russian on you i deeper than
[1:11:50] you i lighted on you i floated on you

[1:12:16] subconscious level
[1:12:17] by messing everybody up nice poison that
[1:12:20] off that off that off that off and the
[1:12:21] way i off at the rate all them off

[1:12:33] wrong
[1:12:35] church have falls of course it's a fault
[1:12:38] this church is open
[1:12:39] it can have an armchair critic out there
[1:12:41] sit and listen to the services i don't

[1:12:44] have said that he got to say that of
[1:12:45] course i can say that

[1:12:52] for me to say it

[1:12:55] because what we are saying we have no
[1:12:56] private gospel we preach the word
[1:12:59] that's why after service we could put up
[1:13:01] on the internet and who want to hear it
[1:13:03] hear it who don't want to hear it they
[1:13:04] don't listen to it that's fine
[1:13:06] but we are free this church
[1:13:10] is free and i am free to preach the
[1:13:13] gospel
[1:13:14] the gospel is not bad news the gospel is
[1:13:17] the good news
[1:13:19] come on same as somebody the gospel has
[1:13:22] got bad news about this one and that one
[1:13:24] all them pastors struggling

[1:13:31] granted
[1:13:34] some of them have grand problems because
[1:13:37] the holy ghost not there
[1:13:39] so they'll take a human element they
[1:13:41] have turn lows are digging ushers
[1:13:43] spies assistance and associates people
[1:13:46] walking
[1:13:47] helping them nurturing them you had to
[1:13:49] want a ride home
[1:13:50] and everything else people almost live
[1:13:52] in an initiation all
[1:13:54] right so you never wouldn't get to them
[1:14:01] so i'm not even seeing other husbands
[1:14:02] the same body church
[1:14:05] they're serving the church they're like
[1:14:07] church nuns
[1:14:12] your daughter say amen it's destitute
[1:14:16] hallelujah and god wants to loose you
[1:14:19] out there
[1:14:20] to face the music
[1:14:24] wasn't god do jesus loose him into the
[1:14:26] wilderness let the devil tempt him
[1:14:30] amen do this do that you think god sorry
[1:14:33] god want to break your spirit
[1:14:36] yes god want to break this be too strong
[1:14:40] yes god went to break the spirit that he
[1:14:42] could get a yield in
[1:14:44] a position where you depend on him
[1:14:46] [Applause]
[1:14:49] it's good to be victorious but sometimes
[1:14:51] god has bring us to defeat
[1:14:52] for a purpose
[1:14:58] defeat this part of god's program
[1:15:02] i'm not hearing you some of you feeling
[1:15:05] dumb because you're defeated
[1:15:06] praise god defeat doesn't mean you're
[1:15:08] going to stay defeated
[1:15:10] defeat means you lost a battle that is
[1:15:12] not the war
[1:15:14] come on same as somebody that is only
[1:15:16] wrong number one
[1:15:24] give the lord a shout you're going to
[1:15:26] bounce back
[1:15:28] you're going to amen
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:36] struggling
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:43] you know i always preach just as the
[1:15:46] church of a vision
[1:15:47] or the prophet brought a vision a whom
[1:15:49] should have a vision
[1:15:51] that everybody have a vision connected
[1:15:53] to where we want to go
[1:15:55] what we want to achieve if i honed over
[1:15:57] vision the husband of a vision
[1:15:58] what do i help him into it
[1:16:02] is a man going nowhere
[1:16:08] because you're not seeking god for
[1:16:10] vision of where you want to go where you
[1:16:12] want to be what you want to accomplish
[1:16:15] because anytime you have purpose and you
[1:16:17] have a vision
[1:16:18] that is what will wake you up in the
[1:16:19] morning and say it is a great day
[1:16:22] because you are nearer than when you're
[1:16:24] first believer
[1:16:27] in other words sarah it was above for
[1:16:30] sure to get up
[1:16:32] because sarah was old and she didn't
[1:16:35] have a revelation
[1:16:37] so she had abraham saying don't worry
[1:16:39] sarah you're gonna make it
[1:16:42] and she problem is how and abram's story
[1:16:45] is i don't know
[1:16:47] but god said so so that that's the
[1:16:50] problem
[1:16:51] every so often does he fight with abram
[1:16:53] and syria
[1:16:54] because sarah don't understand why is
[1:16:57] abraham smiling like that
[1:16:59] because abraham only seen isaac and she
[1:17:02] can't see what he has seen
[1:17:04] because she don't have the revelation he
[1:17:05] has and that's a problem
[1:17:09] oh hallelujah so the stimulation of
[1:17:11] revelation
[1:17:12] that abraham had sarah liked
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:22] so when abraham come home and saying i
[1:17:23] feel like traveling on
[1:17:25] ask me something to drink this system
[1:17:27] when abraham singing that kind of way
[1:17:29] she don't understand why he could sing
[1:17:31] like that when she is feeling all
[1:17:33] and feel to go and lie down oh give the
[1:17:35] lord some praises
[1:17:38] oh hallelujah oh glory
[1:17:41] hallelujah but you know what annoying
[1:17:44] sarah fate
[1:17:45] when the three men came down walking it
[1:17:48] was a hot day
[1:17:49] it was about 12 o'clock noon and three
[1:17:51] men came walking
[1:17:53] and sarah went to made some big because
[1:17:55] sarah taught by some other man talking
[1:17:58] and abraham began to talk to that man
[1:18:00] another alive and that man began to talk
[1:18:02] he said i will return to you and sarah
[1:18:05] gonna have that son
[1:18:06] and sarah laughs because she was here in
[1:18:08] the conversation
[1:18:09] and the man said why did sarah laugh and
[1:18:12] she knew
[1:18:13] she laughed within herself she knew not
[1:18:16] a man could have known that she was
[1:18:17] laughing
[1:18:18] in her heart that had to be god
[1:18:26] glory hallelujah
[1:18:30] then to hear those notable words i will
[1:18:32] return unto thee
[1:18:33] according to the time of life and say i
[1:18:36] shall have a son
[1:18:37] after that visitation sarah was changed
[1:18:40] all together
[1:18:40] because she knew something went between
[1:18:42] the bone and the mirror something went
[1:18:44] beyond her spirit
[1:18:45] and he's in the very torso intense of a
[1:18:47] heart she knew that was almighty god
[1:18:50] she knew that was elohim and everyone
[1:18:52] said i'm going to come back
[1:18:54] not as man anymore but as power as
[1:18:57] dynamic civil mechanics
[1:18:58] and abraham knew his wife caught the
[1:19:01] vision
[1:19:01] come on say him and somebody just had to
[1:19:04] wait on the feeling
[1:19:05] but the wife caught the vision and once
[1:19:08] the pride
[1:19:08] catch the vision you're only waiting for
[1:19:11] the visitation
[1:19:12] but the vision is for an appointed time
[1:19:15] oh
[1:19:15] i will surely visit you
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:20] it's going to be a mighty mighty
[1:19:23] visitation
[1:19:24] oh blessed be the name of the lord you
[1:19:27] may be seated
[1:19:28] oh hallelujah sometime i want to tell
[1:19:31] you something
[1:19:32] you talk about pulsation work on that
[1:19:35] pulsation
[1:19:36] that spear of the moment joshua did it
[1:19:39] mary magdalene did it when something is
[1:19:41] revealed to you grab it
[1:19:43] in the spirit of the moment my work
[1:19:45] shows my fate
[1:19:46] your faith is what god sees on you your
[1:19:49] works is what other people see in you
[1:19:51] isn't that right so faith that doesn't
[1:19:53] produce works
[1:19:54] anyone has a right to doubt your
[1:19:56] testimony isn't that right
[1:19:58] works is married to fate so if you say
[1:20:00] you're married raise your husband
[1:20:02] and you're not producing them we could
[1:20:03] don't you testimony but once you have
[1:20:05] faith
[1:20:06] works always are wrong works express the
[1:20:09] faith that you have
[1:20:11] they work together i i faith abraham who
[1:20:14] is not right
[1:20:14] you keep testifying is that right here
[1:20:16] this part no
[1:20:18] watch watch he considered not his own
[1:20:20] body now dead

[1:23:44] remember joe they had no bible to read
[1:23:46] listen to this one
[1:23:47] he didn't have it as easy as we got
[1:23:49] today to read the words
[1:23:50] and see others who took it remember it's
[1:23:52] only by revelation
[1:23:54] joseph in genesis there was no bible
[1:23:57] moses or genesis leviticus deuteronomy
[1:24:00] none of those characters and they had
[1:24:01] any bible to read until after moses
[1:24:03] they didn't have a bible that we got to
[1:24:06] help us along in our crippled condition
[1:24:08] they were rugged men god revealed to
[1:24:11] them
[1:24:12] and they stood right there nothing moved
[1:24:14] them
[1:24:15] it's once nothing can move you once it's
[1:24:18] revealed to you
[1:24:19] but you just have to get a little start
[1:24:22] that's all you have to do
[1:24:24] just get your faith moving one time and
[1:24:26] god will do the rest
[1:24:28] oh hallelujah praise god he said the
[1:24:31] attitude
[1:24:32] is what brings the results if the
[1:24:33] attitude you take towards god
[1:24:35] here was a woman touches garment she was
[1:24:37] healed with a blood issue
[1:24:39] a soldier spit in his face and felt no
[1:24:41] virtue
[1:24:42] it's your approach the attitude is what
[1:24:44] it takes and that's what it is tonight
[1:24:46] dear friend
[1:24:46] it takes the attitude we are and believe
[1:24:50] that we are in the presence of jesus
[1:24:51] christ but it's our attitude that brings
[1:24:53] the results
[1:24:54] the mechanics is here here we go
[1:24:57] and so is the dynamics if you can just
[1:25:00] get started
[1:25:01] god will do the rest he didn't say get
[1:25:05] seated he said started
[1:25:08] in other words you got to get to moving
[1:25:11] i'm not hearing you

[1:26:58] as god was brilliant bringing israel out
[1:27:00] his people a nation
[1:27:01] a nation out of a nation a beautiful
[1:27:03] time of the day god is calling here we
[1:27:05] go
[1:27:06] a bride out of a church a christian
[1:27:09] bride
[1:27:10] out of a church isn't that right it's
[1:27:12] sometimes called the chosen
[1:27:14] the elected the remnant it was called
[1:27:17] the bride the four
[1:27:18] ordained and so forth isn't that right
[1:27:20] praise be to jesus
[1:27:22] so brother branham says that he will
[1:27:25] call you a side church
[1:27:26] if you'll only obey him and stay on the
[1:27:29] word
[1:27:29] he will place into the church before the
[1:27:32] coming of jesus christ
[1:27:34] all the powers that was in christ will
[1:27:36] be in the church
[1:27:38] isn't that right god wanted his work
[1:27:41] done
[1:27:41] he sent his son his son wanted the work
[1:27:44] done
[1:27:45] he sent it into the church at that that
[1:27:47] you will know i
[1:27:48] and the father yield me and i knew isn't
[1:27:50] that right
[1:27:51] and the same power that was in jehovah
[1:27:53] god rested in jesus christ
[1:27:55] the same power that resident jesus
[1:27:57] christ rest in
[1:27:59] placed sons in the body of christ
[1:28:03] that's the prophecy isn't it right
[1:28:05] placing of a son
[1:28:07] there will be a power put into the
[1:28:09] church and now it's coming in
[1:28:11] that the holy spirit will so anoint the
[1:28:15] people
[1:28:16] till they will speak the word and it
[1:28:18] will create itself
[1:28:19] right there like that we haven't seen
[1:28:22] power
[1:28:22] likes coming into the church i know it
[1:28:24] as a fact
[1:28:26] he know it was coming the holy ghost
[1:28:28] going to anoint the people
[1:28:31] how could the holy ghost anoint the
[1:28:32] people that means the people must become
[1:28:34] the word
[1:28:36] because the spirit comes on the word
[1:28:39] oh hallelujah glory to god in the
[1:28:43] beginning was the word isn't that right
[1:28:45] then the word became flesh and jesus was
[1:28:47] anointed with the holy ghost
[1:28:49] but he was the word and the bride will
[1:28:52] become the word
[1:28:53] then the holy ghost have to come upon
[1:28:55] you the dynamics will strike you
[1:29:00] because the dynamic is for the bride and
[1:29:03] the church hallelujah
[1:29:04] is going to strike you oh blessed be of
[1:29:08] the lord no he listen to this
[1:29:10] adoption iframe don't want to stay
[1:29:14] one of them over there we said man
[1:29:15] manasuba there
[1:29:17] god said wait a minute i'm supposed to
[1:29:19] raise oats i'm gonna get corn too
[1:29:21] you ain't got nothing to do with corn
[1:29:24] get oats
[1:29:25] oats is your power to raise you ain't so
[1:29:28] you're supposed to hurt sheep
[1:29:29] and you are supposed to hurt cattle god
[1:29:32] wants to place the church
[1:29:34] listen carefully i don't want anybody to
[1:29:36] miss this
[1:29:37] god wants to place the church but
[1:29:40] every one of them wants to do the same
[1:29:43] thing
[1:29:46] and you can't tell them nothing about
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] hallelujah they got that coty gotti but
[1:29:52] but but
[1:29:52] but now watch god can take a man
[1:29:56] adopt him into the family and give him
[1:29:59] something
[1:30:00] first try that
[1:30:05] see if it is right the bible said
[1:30:09] try the spirit so if any minister pastor
[1:30:13] apostle whoever claim whatever
[1:30:15] claim anything and they don't want to be
[1:30:17] tried that is not the spirit of god
[1:30:20] because if you're having what is right
[1:30:22] it could be tried
[1:30:25] try that we're supposed to try the
[1:30:27] spirits
[1:30:29] nobody say accept this no try it see if
[1:30:31] it's right
[1:30:32] amanda claim a certain thing try it see
[1:30:34] if it is right
[1:30:35] if it is right move right with it and
[1:30:37] say lord send us something else
[1:30:40] and that's how god going to place the
[1:30:41] church isn't that right
[1:30:43] oh hallelujah now watch god could have
[1:30:45] chosen
[1:30:46] to preach the gospel by the sun by the
[1:30:48] moon by the stars
[1:30:49] by will nature but he chose men to
[1:30:52] preach the gospel
[1:30:53] and that is where the voice of god will
[1:30:55] come from
[1:30:56] and you can judge the voice
[1:30:59] according to the word it expresses
[1:31:02] then you can see what kind of voice
[1:31:05] you're listening to
[1:31:06] if it is contrary to the word don't
[1:31:09] listen to it
[1:31:11] but if it is the word then god is
[1:31:13] duty-bound to back it up
[1:31:15] so god will always back up and confirm
[1:31:18] his word
[1:31:19] moses pharaoh look out the window and
[1:31:22] saw
[1:31:23] these bunch of madoba's moses look out
[1:31:26] the same window
[1:31:27] and more they saw victory he had focus
[1:31:29] himself
[1:31:30] though he was a prince he was a heir but
[1:31:32] he knowed god promised
[1:31:34] abraham that he would visit his people
[1:31:36] moses looked out his window and he
[1:31:38] believed it
[1:31:39] because moses looked out by faith and
[1:31:42] when you are focused with the word of
[1:31:43] god you are
[1:31:44] directly in line and zirin then that
[1:31:47] fate of god is in you
[1:31:48] isn't that right look at the church
[1:31:50] today god wants us to watch for the
[1:31:52] supernatural
[1:31:54] when his word is made manifest and
[1:31:55] vindicated
[1:31:57] now if the devil says for you now wait a
[1:31:59] minute wait a minute maybe tonight you
[1:32:00] might be a little bit better when the
[1:32:02] revival starts
[1:32:03] might be fear might be good but don't
[1:32:05] wait till revival start
[1:32:08] become part of the revival right now god
[1:32:11] want to start
[1:32:12] it in you how many believe that go i
[1:32:14] want to start it
[1:32:15] in the church the holy spirit will take
[1:32:18] the messenger
[1:32:19] and send forth a message isn't that
[1:32:21] right and this quote
[1:32:22] i got it from pastor but a cliff chima
[1:32:25] in nigeria
[1:32:26] he said uh brother branham there's some
[1:32:29] why i'm praying for the sick
[1:32:30] he said i don't come as a fanatic i do
[1:32:32] not believe in fanaticism i wouldn't
[1:32:34] stand for it
[1:32:35] i know you don't believe in fanaticism
[1:32:37] you believe in the truth
[1:32:38] here we go and truth will
[1:32:41] always speak for itself you don't
[1:32:45] ever have to strain truth truth will
[1:32:48] always be true your doctor try to prove
[1:32:51] truth and
[1:32:51] thin truth no truth will speak for
[1:32:53] itself
[1:32:55] i love that oh praise god amen
[1:32:58] hallelujah you believe that praise god
[1:33:01] so here we go
[1:33:02] he said no wonder god can send a revival
[1:33:04] he has got nothing to build it on
[1:33:06] then he will take individuals and build
[1:33:08] it on them individuals
[1:33:10] and declare them before the world who
[1:33:12] will stay with the word
[1:33:13] from god called man he said we hear all
[1:33:15] this cry for revival and so forth
[1:33:17] and it's uplifting but god made a
[1:33:20] promise if my people has called by my
[1:33:21] name
[1:33:22] shall i send themselves to get on pray
[1:33:24] then they'll hear from heaven
[1:33:25] now this is the other half of what we're
[1:33:27] talking about the minister can't bring a
[1:33:29] revival but listen to this part
[1:33:31] and before we can have a revival god has
[1:33:34] to call out and train
[1:33:35] men god train men to carry this message
[1:33:40] and they describe the kind of men that
[1:33:42] they are they don't care
[1:33:44] what the opposition is they are willing
[1:33:47] to go into fiery furnace and defeat
[1:33:49] or to the lion's den or wherever it is
[1:33:52] because they have been in the presence
[1:33:54] of god and they know he
[1:33:56] is whether it's victory or defeat they
[1:33:58] will stand the same
[1:34:00] and that's the kind of training god
[1:34:02] gives his men isn't that right
[1:34:05] god very seldom call smart men
[1:34:08] educated and intellectual they play
[1:34:10] their part
[1:34:11] they are great men but usually when god
[1:34:14] wants the job done
[1:34:16] you know men who could explain the job
[1:34:19] they they could explain a job
[1:34:20] description
[1:34:21] they could conduct the interview they
[1:34:23] could explain all what you're supposed
[1:34:25] to do
[1:34:25] but when talking about the job done god
[1:34:27] have certain kind of men
[1:34:29] to get the job done hallelujah my
[1:34:32] meat is to do the work the will of god
[1:34:34] and to finish the work
[1:34:36] in other words i have a job to finish to
[1:34:38] do isn't that right
[1:34:39] so what's something usually he gets
[1:34:41] somebody who hardly knows his abc
[1:34:47] look to the histories men that amounted
[1:34:48] to something with god were not men of
[1:34:50] great education
[1:34:51] but men who had no education only desire
[1:34:54] in their heart to serve god he got a
[1:34:57] plow man he got a shepherd
[1:34:58] he got fishermen he get hunters and so
[1:35:01] forth
[1:35:02] oh what we need is that kind of man
[1:35:04] today not polish scholars
[1:35:06] but men who know god in the power of his
[1:35:09] resurrection
[1:35:10] oh blessed let's all stand and give god
[1:35:12] some worship
[1:35:14] musicians come up please oh
[1:35:18] hallelujah oh glory
