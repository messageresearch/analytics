[30:18] and we want to go straight to the word
[30:19] of god your favorite bibles i'd like to
[30:21] turn to first corinthians chapter 9
[30:24] we want to read from verse 24 to 27
[30:28] we want to go also to philippians
[30:29] chapter 2 reading from verse 3 to 8
[30:33] and luke 15 verse 11-13
[30:36] this morning good to see all of you all
[30:39] tonight
[30:40] today it's good to be here
[30:44] so first coming just 9 24.
[30:48] know you not that they which run in a
[30:50] race run all
[30:51] but one receiver the prize so run
[30:55] that you may obtain and every man that's
[30:58] traveling for the mastery is temperate
[31:00] in all things
[31:02] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[31:06] crown
[31:06] but we are incorruptable i
[31:10] therefore so run not
[31:13] as uncertainly sulfite eye not as one
[31:16] that beats the ear
[31:18] but i keep under my body
[31:21] and bring it into subjection least that
[31:24] by any means
[31:26] when i have preached to others i myself
[31:28] should be
[31:29] a cast away and philippians chapter
[31:33] 2 reading for verse 3 let nothing be
[31:36] done through strife
[31:38] or vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[31:41] let each esteem other better than
[31:42] themselves
[31:44] look not every man and his own things
[31:46] but every man also
[31:47] on the things of others let this mind be
[31:50] new
[31:51] which was also in christ jesus who been
[31:54] in the form of god taught enough robbery
[31:56] to be equal with god
[31:57] but made himself of no reputation took
[32:00] upon him the form of a servant and was
[32:03] made
[32:03] in the likeness of sinful men like
[32:06] likeness of men
[32:07] and being found in fashion as a man he
[32:10] humbled himself
[32:12] and became obedient unto death even the
[32:14] death
[32:15] of the cross and our last scripture is
[32:18] from
[32:18] luke chapter 15 you want to read from
[32:20] verse 11
[32:23] to 13. and he said a certain man are two
[32:27] sons the younger of them
[32:28] said unto his father father give me the
[32:30] portion of goods that
[32:32] followed to me and he divided into them
[32:35] his living
[32:36] and not many days after the younger son
[32:38] gathered all together and took his
[32:40] journey
[32:41] into a far country and there
[32:44] [Music]
[32:45] wasted his substance which practiced
[32:47] living let's pray one more time father
[32:49] we thank you
[32:50] we have read your scriptures lord and
[32:52] it's strange texts and what to be said
[32:54] this morning and
[32:55] what i believe you want me to share with
[32:57] your people may you bless it and
[32:58] interpret it to their hearts
[33:00] and lives that no one would leave you
[33:01] the same way they came bless those that
[33:03] are connected live and those that would
[33:05] hear the message afterwards and jesus
[33:06] might ask it
[33:07] amen name god bless you may have your
[33:09] seats oh praise god
[33:12] i have a title this morning so
[33:15] run that you may obtain so run
[33:20] that you may obtain so it's not
[33:23] what you do but it's how and i didn't
[33:26] want to put it as an inspiration
[33:29] but the underlying thought behind this
[33:31] is
[33:32] uh fighting the spirit of entitlement
[33:35] and complacency
[33:38] it's very odd but this is what we have
[33:41] to share
[33:42] this morning fighting the spirit of
[33:44] entitlement
[33:45] and complacency habakkuk said i will
[33:48] stand up on my watch and set me up on
[33:50] the tower and
[33:51] will watch to see what he will see unto
[33:53] me and what i shall answer when i'm
[33:55] reproved
[33:56] amen and the lord answered and said
[33:58] write the vision
[34:00] make it plain upon tables that he
[34:03] may run that reason it not walk
[34:06] stop walking start a run but to run you
[34:09] have to get to see the vision plane
[34:11] and you would understand why you can't
[34:13] walk you have to run
[34:14] why you have to be enthused about all
[34:16] these promises
[34:17] and why if you get entitled and
[34:19] complacent you it wouldn't do you no
[34:21] good you'll get messed up
[34:23] o pray is the name of the lord so the
[34:25] bible says for the vision is yet for an
[34:27] appointed time
[34:29] so that is why you have to run with
[34:30] patience the race that is set before
[34:33] you can't be frustrated and fed up they
[34:35] can't take it no more you have to
[34:36] understand as a race
[34:38] it's not a sprint because there is
[34:41] nothing swift it's not a sprint
[34:43] it's a race a long race a long distance
[34:46] have
[34:47] mountains and valleys and things to
[34:48] climb but there's a race that we must
[34:50] win
[34:51] and we have to run it a certain way oh
[34:54] glory to god
[34:56] you don't want to be in it to be also
[34:58] ran you have no price for also ram
[35:00] you have to run to obtain you have to
[35:03] run to get to the mark and to the goal
[35:06] and that's why paul said i forget the
[35:08] thing that i passed i
[35:09] press towards the mark of the high
[35:11] calling
[35:12] so you have to have ambition you have to
[35:14] have aim
[35:16] you have to have some kind of desire to
[35:17] take you above where you are
[35:19] and further than where you are if you're
[35:22] satisfied with where you are you are
[35:24] messed up
[35:25] because you have to have a fight inside
[35:26] of you because you're wrestling against
[35:28] flesh and blood
[35:30] the devil is not under quarantine let me
[35:32] say that again the devil is not under
[35:34] quarantine
[35:35] he's alive and well and doing as much
[35:37] mischief as he has always done
[35:39] oh glory to god and if he's not on our
[35:41] current senior could be in our spirit
[35:43] under quarantine
[35:45] we may wear masks and take social
[35:47] distancing but in our spirit
[35:49] we are shoulders of the cross oh glory
[35:52] to god
[35:52] we intend to run this ways to win not to
[35:55] also run
[35:57] oh give the lord a shout we need to aim
[36:00] high we need to climb higher because we
[36:03] were born for the skies as eagles
[36:06] do you believe that this morning but
[36:08] abraham amen had relaxed he said
[36:10] the very name ephesus was a strange
[36:12] compound meaning
[36:14] and relaxed the high aspiration of this
[36:17] age that had begun
[36:18] with the fullness of the spirit the
[36:20] depth of god whereby they were aiming at
[36:22] the high calling of god
[36:24] begin to give way to a less watchful
[36:27] attitude
[36:28] a less added following of jesus christ
[36:31] began to manifest itself
[36:32] as an omen that in the future ages the
[36:35] physical vehicle
[36:36] called the church would sink into the
[36:39] awfulness
[36:39] of the depth of satan it had begun
[36:42] relaxed
[36:43] and was drifting already the age was
[36:46] backsliding
[36:47] it has left his first love when the
[36:49] bible said in the last days the love of
[36:50] many gonna wax
[36:52] cold prophet said only among the elect
[36:55] will have
[36:55] love the love of men are going to wax
[36:58] call because of inequity
[37:00] iniquity is knowing to do right and
[37:01] doing wrong you know better than that
[37:04] oh he said rather you're hot or you're
[37:06] cold if you're called you know you're
[37:07] dead
[37:08] if you're hot you're on fire but because
[37:11] you look warm
[37:12] oh glory to god complacent entitled
[37:15] people
[37:17] entitled believers entitled church
[37:19] members
[37:20] see that god owe them something and they
[37:23] deserve better
[37:24] and they deserve more oh my lord
[37:29] complacency meaning self-satisfaction
[37:32] especially when accompanied by
[37:35] unawareness of actual dangers
[37:37] or deficiencies
[37:40] danger unaware
[37:45] walking about like you're foolish and
[37:47] simple
[37:49] instead of being wise the foolish
[37:52] versions they wasn't studying
[37:53] about the extra oil they had enough to
[37:56] have the
[37:57] lamp lit for a while
[38:00] but the energy and the backup to have
[38:03] extra oil
[38:04] they failed deal they didn't have the
[38:08] wisdom of revelation
[38:10] to get the extra oil well you are not
[38:12] here to enter the wreath
[38:14] you are not here to be also ran you here
[38:17] to win
[38:18] you're here to run with a goal and a
[38:20] purpose
[38:21] paul said it perfectly oh
[38:24] hallelujah complacency
[38:28] a feeling of smug or on
[38:32] critical satisfaction with oneself
[38:35] or one's achievements let me read it
[38:38] again
[38:39] a feeling of smug a
[38:42] critical satisfaction with oneself or
[38:45] one's achievement
[38:46] no an entitlement is a right to a
[38:50] particular
[38:51] privilege or benefit if someone has a
[38:54] sense of entitlement
[38:56] that means the person believes he
[38:59] deserves
[39:01] certain privileges and whatever you
[39:04] feel you are entitled to question who's
[39:07] supposed to pay for that
[39:12] yeah you know they talked about vaccine
[39:16] and the vaccine were given on free but
[39:17] you know what the vaccine is free you
[39:18] know
[39:20] somebody paying faith you know if the
[39:22] government pay for it give any people
[39:24] free
[39:24] but somebody paid they call the
[39:25] pharmaceutical companies not doing it
[39:27] for free
[39:28] they're doing for a whole lot of money
[39:31] so what we take
[39:32] as for granted as what we're entitled to
[39:35] somebody paying for it so let's talk
[39:37] about that political son
[39:40] oh give the lord a shout let's let's
[39:41] talk about this this young man
[39:44] oh give the lord a shout could we praise
[39:46] him this morning let's talk about this
[39:47] young man
[39:50] who felt he was so entitled that he had
[39:53] the right not to wait
[39:55] but to go to his father say father you
[39:57] see what you have for me
[39:59] i want it now
[40:04] what i am entitled to all right like
[40:07] that what he spiritually said
[40:07] administration
[40:08] he take the money he head out to a far
[40:11] country
[40:12] nobody can counsel him advise him
[40:15] teach him share with him he just
[40:18] burned the money down to the ground
[40:22] he even invested he opened my business
[40:25] with it
[40:27] he didn't work for it he didn't earn it
[40:29] but he could burn it
[40:31] that's the spirit of entitlement
[40:35] yeah i'm in it you didn't label for it
[40:38] but you could burn it that is why god
[40:41] have no spoiled children
[40:43] because you know the human spirit that's
[40:46] why when people win lotto and lottery
[40:47] and whatnot within three years all the
[40:49] money burned
[40:50] because they never earn it they don't
[40:53] know how to handle it
[40:54] and that is why god are just dropping
[40:56] blessings of character
[40:58] oh glory oh god help me this morning
[41:02] maybe you didn't come for this kind of
[41:03] message but we have it for you this
[41:04] morning
[41:05] we got it locked barrel wrapped and
[41:08] prepared for you this morning
[41:10] oh hallelujah that's why god is dropping
[41:12] the blessings of the character
[41:14] he said karate is a victory not a gift
[41:17] that's why all them preachers with this
[41:18] blessing until blessed be stressed
[41:20] and all who bless and bless have no
[41:22] character because they can't manage when
[41:24] god give them that's why god wants
[41:25] somebody to manage power
[41:26] he needs to see character he needs to
[41:29] see what you go through
[41:30] or see him in somebody oh hallelujah
[41:34] hallelujah
[41:36] so you see what entitlement is to that
[41:37] young man
[41:39] make him lose everything not just lose
[41:42] the money
[41:44] worse than that what entitlement does
[41:47] it make him lose himself
[41:50] because the power in what he didn't work
[41:54] for
[41:55] or what he didn't end give him
[41:58] a certain right he could flash
[42:02] in his friends and flush with his car
[42:04] and flush with his house and flash with
[42:05] his mouth
[42:06] and flush with everything until the
[42:08] money
[42:09] ran out when the money ran out
[42:14] be it shame pride mixture all together
[42:16] shaken together
[42:20] the big house that they thought he was
[42:22] living he was living in the band behind
[42:24] that
[42:28] he said i had a few clothes for me he
[42:29] was flashing so he could flush try that
[42:33] but the eaton and the dining was with
[42:36] knife and fork
[42:37] and tablecloth was with the pigs
[42:41] he lost fission he lost
[42:44] focus he lost a sense of direction
[42:49] and he was there in his comfort zone
[42:52] nobody knew
[42:54] but this big food it's so bad after all
[42:58] i had some ketchup left over had some
[43:01] pepper left over
[43:03] and he was going through that for a
[43:05] while and the bible said he came to
[43:07] himself
[43:09] [Music]
[43:11] you see sometimes god had to do things
[43:13] for you to come
[43:16] to yourself no man can do that for you
[43:20] you go through enough stuff to recognize
[43:22] your own failures your shortcomings and
[43:24] your mistakes and so on when you go
[43:26] through enough stuff you have to come
[43:28] to yourself and when you come to
[43:31] yourself nobody could take you away
[43:33] from the connection and the reconnection
[43:35] with your father
[43:37] oh glory to god he didn't have no sense
[43:39] of shame anymore he was stripped
[43:41] and he was ready to get back home but
[43:42] really want to go there you want to go
[43:44] forward
[43:45] hallelujah so all you who have rights
[43:48] and privileges and feel this and
[43:50] i feel you are entitled to who paying
[43:52] for that
[43:55] some children they don't care all the
[43:58] concern of it is what they need
[44:00] what they feel what their parents
[44:02] supposed to give them and some parents
[44:04] foolishly give them everything that they
[44:05] want
[44:07] call them spoil children i'll see if
[44:10] they take parents that cut your tail and
[44:12] put some licks on your life will cut
[44:13] your tail
[44:14] and put licks on you because it's not
[44:17] the way
[44:17] god raises his own children and if god
[44:20] will raise his children that way do
[44:22] raise yours that way
[44:23] because there'll be spoiled rotten
[44:25] breaths that's why the first church was
[44:27] an experienced church with fire
[44:29] holy ghost cleansing and as the church
[44:31] move on it gets less watchful
[44:34] people have less experience they come
[44:35] and join and they become members of the
[44:37] church
[44:38] and the church just went downhill
[44:40] because no fire was present
[44:42] because the people kept complacent in
[44:44] sports
[44:46] many times teams that win championship
[44:50] most times next time they fail and flop
[44:52] because why
[44:54] they they get relaxed they don't seem to
[44:57] need to push
[44:59] to stay on top and that relaxed
[45:02] and that entitled they tell themselves
[45:04] they're skillful they have a lot of
[45:05] skillful men and another group
[45:07] they tapping the ball they're doing this
[45:09] thing they practice it every single day
[45:11] and afterwards they come to the court
[45:13] and when championship does come they
[45:14] cut the throat of the other team that
[45:16] won
[45:18] what happened relax
[45:21] taking it easy entitlement
[45:24] is a false impression of feeling
[45:28] i deserve it and i deserve
[45:31] more
[45:36] it's a condition that people deserve
[45:39] something special
[45:40] or someone owes me something
[45:43] and when you don't get that you get
[45:44] upset
[45:46] you get angry you get angry because it
[45:49] doesn't fulfill the expectation
[45:52] of what you think that you are entitled
[45:54] to
[45:57] so this entitlement affects your spirit
[46:00] it affects your marriage
[46:01] it affects you on the job it affects
[46:03] everywhere
[46:05] because because of your thinking you
[46:07] speak certain things
[46:08] and your attitude goes out a certain way
[46:11] because of that spirit of entitlement
[46:16] do you believe that people say it's my
[46:19] money i could buy what i want that's
[46:20] true
[46:22] but then when you buy things above where
[46:24] you could manage and handle
[46:26] put your hat you're not very hungry or
[46:29] you put your hat up there
[46:32] and you have to pay for the height very
[46:33] heart rich
[46:36] and it's your money but
[46:39] you're writing a debt behind you
[46:46] so then you live in anger
[46:49] resentment and frustration because
[46:52] others are not responding to the way you
[46:56] think you deserve katamata straight out
[46:59] of ministers overseas
[47:01] rip him and he find like i was unfair
[47:05] but he was off and what he was teaching
[47:07] and preaching
[47:08] i had to tell him the truth he
[47:10] challenged people if he preached
[47:12] anything come and talk to him
[47:13] i decided to go and talk to him with the
[47:15] other ministers he didn't expect that
[47:17] he was shocked but this is what i will
[47:21] do
[47:22] you make your boss and see if it's
[47:24] stinging wrong let somebody come and
[47:25] talk to us
[47:25] good fine i'm coming
[47:30] because this is my father's word and i
[47:32] am standing with the word
[47:34] i told ministers to understand about
[47:35] them as long as they stay with the world
[47:37] i
[47:37] we we are friends we go work together
[47:38] and whatnot you know but i'm staying
[47:40] with this word
[47:41] friend or no friend i'm not looking for
[47:43] friends i want to stay with this
[47:45] because i know god going to ride in on
[47:47] this oh glory to god you saw that one up
[47:50] in america fight him to try to change
[47:51] the election
[47:52] because you figure he's entitled to be
[47:54] in that white house
[47:55] and the people vote him out already he
[47:58] gone and you don't even know it
[48:02] fired and still on the throne that's
[48:05] what i'm talking about
[48:06] you think people doesn't get fired in
[48:08] god's kingdom they do

[55:55] his faithfulness
[55:57] we forget his trueness we forget how we
[56:00] kept us come on peace back to me this is
[56:03] a different kind of service there's a
[56:04] little interruption
[56:05] there's a pastoral kind of stuff because
[56:07] this is what i get for you this morning
[56:08] because i want you to get on fire i
[56:10] wanted to get all complacency i want you
[56:12] to know you're not entitled
[56:15] you have to fight for it
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:18] [Music]
[56:24] when i see what paul said it shook me up
[56:28] did you get what paul said this is paul
[56:31] who met the
[56:32] jesus christ this is paul who met pilaf
[56:35] fire you can't see him in killer fire
[56:37] this is paul called to be opposite of
[56:39] the gentiles
[56:40] this is paul saying how he's going to
[56:43] run
[56:44] he's not running just to run he's
[56:46] running to obtain
[56:47] oh come on now
[56:55] when you feel entitled you just feel
[56:58] like
[56:59] you could take things for granted you
[57:02] plant a promoter tree pump city tree
[57:04] what you take for granted
[57:07] the insects and worms depend on the
[57:08] country them they're not taking for
[57:10] granted
[57:12] they're working and when you snoring
[57:15] sleeping they're working
[57:17] and when you're coming no it's big worm
[57:20] big bees big buzz whatever it is bugs
[57:24] because they're working so what i'm
[57:26] beginning to realize
[57:28] is not a matter of taking your salvation
[57:30] for granted
[57:31] is understand the support systems that
[57:34] god require for you to maintain
[57:37] and uphold your salvation
[57:40] your redemption your blessing and you
[57:43] can't take it for granted so paul
[57:45] said clearly the reason he buffeted his
[57:48] body and
[57:49] end up tough does the purpose of that
[57:53] say tough some people are too soft
[58:00] too soft
[58:03] the devil's you feel sorry for anybody
[58:05] he will kill a baby he will kill old
[58:07] people he kill everybody you know
[58:09] because he's trying to cut people off
[58:11] from breaking through
[58:13] we are about to break you i know it i'm
[58:14] speaking it
[58:15] [Music]
[58:16] you hear what i said but this spirit
[58:19] have to go
[58:21] so we are fighting it we got to fight it
[58:23] because you see this is not going to
[58:25] keep you back from pressing into the
[58:26] revival fire
[58:27] i am not no catholic priest i'm not
[58:29] bringing a wafer for you
[58:31] oh glory to god every one of you are
[58:33] priests unto god
[58:35] every one of you have to connect to god
[58:37] you're not connecting to god through me
[58:40] sorry maybe other pastors he could
[58:42] connect through that but not that not
[58:44] here
[58:45] when the veil was ran from the top to
[58:46] the bottom he showed you to have direct
[58:48] access
[58:50] [Music]
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:53] god forgive you then you have to forgive
[58:54] your own self when god forgive you
[58:56] some people don't want to forgive
[58:57] themselves so they end up in a pity
[58:59] party you know
[59:01] my lord today something that bunks up
[59:03] here two of the biggest challenges
[59:04] confronting workplaces in 2020
[59:06] are complacency and entitlement while
[59:09] there are many
[59:09] external factors that can affect how
[59:12] someone feels and thinks
[59:13] complacency and entitlement are a direct
[59:17] reflections of one mindset amen
[59:22] pride which makes a person think more
[59:24] than himself
[59:25] more about himself or herself than what
[59:27] he actually is the bible specifically
[59:29] exhorted us
[59:30] let not amounting more highly
[59:36] so when your mind thinks you up dear oh
[59:38] jesus gave lots of parables you know
[59:40] he said when you invite your feast take
[59:43] this seat at the lowest table
[59:46] you see if your mind just tells yourself
[59:48] you're on and you're it
[59:49] and you're sitting on the high table
[59:51] they say if you take a city high table
[59:53] leave somebody more worthy than you
[59:54] comes
[59:57] no and they have to move you
[1:00:01] so if you take the lowest seat they
[1:00:03] could move you up
[1:00:06] but when you take the higher seat
[1:00:09] there's only one place to move you
[1:00:11] that's dung
[1:00:15] all these are principles of living
[1:00:18] let me say again all these are
[1:00:19] principles of
[1:00:21] living take the lowest seat
[1:00:24] let them promote you let them recognize
[1:00:27] you you're big
[1:00:28] oh sorry we didn't oh it's you sorry
[1:00:30] sorry
[1:00:32] and we could take you to your worthy
[1:00:40] seat
[1:00:42] and this is what somebody shared about a
[1:00:44] few examples of an entitled heart
[1:00:47] what was given to me was not what i
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:54] deserved
[1:00:56] others are blessed easily but why am i
[1:00:58] still struggling i deserve more than
[1:00:59] them
[1:01:01] i deserve that job because i'm more
[1:01:03] efficient than that person
[1:01:06] since i've gone through a lot from my
[1:01:07] challenges i deserve to be more blessed
[1:01:08] by god
[1:01:11] i am deserved to be treated well i'm
[1:01:12] working hard for the church
[1:01:18] entitlement the fruits
[1:01:22] of entitled spirit dinner different to
[1:01:24] the spirit
[1:01:26] is the fruit of entitled spirit is
[1:01:28] comparison
[1:01:31] and that's me so canada i better than
[1:01:34] she like better than she ever
[1:01:35] comparison discontent disappointment
[1:01:38] opinionated false expectation from
[1:01:40] people and god
[1:01:41] jealousy and envy so what is to be an
[1:01:43] entitlement you can't rejoice with
[1:01:45] somebody who get blessed with something
[1:01:46] because you figure that should be
[1:01:48] amazing
[1:01:51] so you can the bible say rejoice with
[1:01:52] your brother rejoice with your sister
[1:01:53] rejoice you can't rejoice because you
[1:01:55] figure is that where they get there
[1:01:59] are you coming to so long i should i'll
[1:02:03] have a husband long time i should have
[1:02:04] wife long time i should that this is a
[1:02:05] long time ago
[1:02:06] look a long time and you go through all
[1:02:08] of that oh my
[1:02:10] praise god amen one of the breakthrough
[1:02:14] to all of this
[1:02:14] is to be grateful and to be thankful
[1:02:18] because complaining weakens your feet
[1:02:22] you hear what i'm saying complaining
[1:02:24] weakens your fate
[1:02:26] so you begin to thank god for the day i
[1:02:27] wake up in the morning
[1:02:29] you should see me sometimes my father
[1:02:32] says so i don't hold my back a little
[1:02:33] bit so
[1:02:34] i'm just pause the feeling straighten up
[1:02:37] i thank god i could straighten up
[1:02:38] there's some people who got straightened
[1:02:39] up
[1:02:41] but i straightened up i could make one
[1:02:43] step two step
[1:02:44] take my time but i'm getting there
[1:02:47] because they get older the bones
[1:02:48] creaking
[1:02:49] as they're going all the things
[1:02:51] happening but you're pressing on anyhow
[1:02:54] oh give the lord some praises this
[1:02:55] morning hallelujah you love him
[1:02:59] oh praise the name of the lord my god
[1:03:04] so don't focus on your own life baby
[1:03:07] said
[1:03:08] mind the things of others and it's get
[1:03:11] away from your selfishness
[1:03:12] get away from your ungratefulness
[1:03:14] because you know represent
[1:03:15] ungratefulness
[1:03:17] my god and when jesus healed ten lepers
[1:03:20] one only one came back you know
[1:03:22] what was jesus first response where are
[1:03:23] the other nine

[1:03:35] are you grateful you see when you're
[1:03:37] grateful
[1:03:38] you're not going to be worried and
[1:03:39] stressed out about what's going to come
[1:03:41] because you're trying for what if god
[1:03:43] isn't if god healed you of
[1:03:44] uh um your foot was bend and your horse
[1:03:47] straight on your foot god could he lay
[1:03:48] your hand
[1:03:49] goku could heal other parts god bring
[1:03:50] you so far god could take care of you
[1:03:53] i'm not worried about people and i
[1:03:54] remember in kyogre with a few people as
[1:03:56] we pray for them pray for them pray for
[1:03:57] them i know god like a buddhism with 10
[1:03:58] people

[1:04:28] you went through that but god called you
[1:04:30] your backslide but god still called you
[1:04:32] the devil couldn't call you
[1:04:33] all who you for no you call that is why
[1:04:36] you could bounce back
[1:04:38] because there's a calling upon your life
[1:04:40] oh give the lord some praises
[1:04:42] oh glory to god you know what i said

[1:05:13] for that
[1:05:14] i'm waiting to see what's going to
[1:05:15] happen among god's people because i know

[1:05:22] thing about complacency
[1:05:24] and upon uh um entitlement
[1:05:27] and i recognize that have to shake
[1:05:29] people's lives and homes
[1:05:31] they come like a husband saying they

[1:07:55] i feel
[1:07:56] the devils backing up this morning
[1:08:09] we need a spirit of gratitude
[1:08:14] it cannot be that the trials block up
[1:08:16] not all what god have done for you
[1:08:18] you're so much you're so much in
[1:08:19] distress that you almost want to curse
[1:08:21] god that will the devil
[1:08:23] tell job tell god i'll make him curse
[1:08:26] you give me a crack at him
[1:08:28] and what the devil bring trials after
[1:08:31] trials after trump joe was real blessed
[1:08:33] everybody knew those were blessed only
[1:08:36] marketplace
[1:08:37] a fine words to the people but when he
[1:08:38] tries to come and hit him so
[1:08:44] the beginning was not too bad you know
[1:08:46] it was just drugs
[1:08:48] you see many boys come and his wife had
[1:08:51] to help him clean
[1:08:53] and then he had to kiss himself because
[1:08:55] afterwards she got tired
[1:08:57] but to show you the grace in that man he
[1:08:59] say you're she's like he's
[1:09:01] calling him dead maybe i'll get
[1:09:03] insurance afterwards but
[1:09:04] do something but but but
[1:09:08] but what's your grace upon job he said
[1:09:10] you speak like a foolish woman
[1:09:12] he knew he a minor foolish woman no
[1:09:14] foolish woman can be his wife
[1:09:19] god did not deem that god didn't set
[1:09:22] that up
[1:09:23] job job couldn't be where he was with
[1:09:25] all that kind of woman by him
[1:09:26] so he know his wife under pressure and
[1:09:28] under pressure he doesn't say the wrong
[1:09:30] thing
[1:09:30] so i want to ease the pressure so they
[1:09:32] can say the right thing

[1:09:41] ungratefulness is the source of one's
[1:09:43] own misery
[1:09:44] and people spread that misery ungrateful
[1:09:47] people are not only grateful to god but
[1:09:49] to their families and their friends and

[1:16:20] it wasn't only elected people in a whole
[1:16:22] about three kind of believers and more
[1:16:25] all kind of believers but they said all
[1:16:28] of the lord said come with me i'm still
[1:16:30] reading that's right
[1:16:31] he opened the earth and sold them up
[1:16:32] they were good people too sure they were
[1:16:34] they were fine people fine people
[1:16:36] swallowed up
[1:16:39] yes but that didn't do it not all said
[1:16:41] lord lord but the ones that do it the
[1:16:42] will of my father
[1:16:44] not he that starts is c that finishes

[1:16:51] disqualified at the end of the race
[1:16:54] so it's not running the race it's how
[1:16:56] you run
[1:17:01] you are no shortcut shaking hand joining
[1:17:03] church denomination or confessing
[1:17:06] confessing the message
[1:17:10] i'm a believer of the brother are you
[1:17:13] ever say but i believe too
[1:17:14] the bible babysitting never believes i'm
[1:17:15] tremble
[1:17:18] oh my hallelujah so paul
[1:17:22] paul says uh he said watch this is the
[1:17:25] amplified
[1:17:26] do you know that in a race all the
[1:17:28] runners compete but only one received
[1:17:30] the prize
[1:17:32] so run your race that you may lay hold
[1:17:34] of the prize
[1:17:35] and make it yours i love that run the
[1:17:39] race
[1:17:39] and lay hold of the prize and make it
[1:17:42] yours
[1:17:43] you have to want it as a possession
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:47] what we are preaching you have to want
[1:17:49] it as a possession
[1:17:51] as the owner of it you actually have it
[1:17:57] now every athlete
[1:17:59] who goes to training conducts himself
[1:18:01] temporarily
[1:18:02] and restricts himself in all things so
[1:18:05] what paul's saying now
[1:18:06] if you're going to training you have to
[1:18:08] come into discipline
[1:18:10] there's no training about discipline
[1:18:12] playing football
[1:18:13] well you practice when you want to
[1:18:15] practice
[1:18:16] it doesn't work so even
[1:18:19] waiting inside the america not cleaning
[1:18:21] the boots and shoes
[1:18:23] and you say what that had to do with i
[1:18:25] think is cleaning boots and shoes and
[1:18:26] making up your bed
[1:18:27] do you know that
[1:18:31] but somebody come inside and say but
[1:18:33] where are we fighting
[1:18:36] i woke up i want to fight the enemy
[1:18:40] but they start every morning better
[1:18:43] inspecting your dead makeup every single
[1:18:45] day
[1:18:47] every single day that's the routine you
[1:18:50] want for discipline
[1:19:01] you can imagine joshua is a bunch of
[1:19:03] people in this message when i bring you
[1:19:04] the show shout and somebody feeling led
[1:19:16] break the rhythm of the spirit
[1:19:17] everything fall down nothing jericho was
[1:19:19] i'm straight
[1:19:20] because you're breaking the order of the
[1:19:22] spirit you have to follow the orderly
[1:19:23] spirit
[1:19:24] because joshua heard from god and then
[1:19:27] if we hear from god you will get the
[1:19:28] supernatural instructions
[1:19:30] so paul said so paul was saying no every
[1:19:32] athlete who goes into training conducts
[1:19:34] himself temporarily
[1:19:35] restricts himself in all things they do
[1:19:37] it to win a wreath
[1:19:38] that will soon wither but we do it to
[1:19:40] receive a crown of eternal blessedness
[1:19:43] that cannot wither
[1:19:44] therefore here we go here we go
[1:19:46] therefore i do not run
[1:19:47] uncertainly without definite aim
[1:19:51] i do not box like one bit in the air and
[1:19:53] strike him without anniversary
[1:19:55] but like a boxer like a boxer i
[1:19:58] buffet my body i handle it roughly
[1:20:02] i disciplined my hardships and subdue it
[1:20:05] for fear
[1:20:06] that after proclaiming to others the
[1:20:08] gospel and things pertaining to it i
[1:20:10] myself shall be unfit not stand the test
[1:20:14] be unapproved and be judged as a
[1:20:16] counterfeit
[1:20:17] so you know what paul was saying here i
[1:20:19] am not seeing myself as
[1:20:21] entitled
[1:20:25] i hope you see that this morning so paul
[1:20:29] wasn't under the spirit of entitlement
[1:20:32] or had the sense of entitlement so he
[1:20:35] couldn't be complacent
[1:20:38] so he brought himself in order to keep
[1:20:41] what he got
[1:20:43] and to strive and run correctly or give
[1:20:46] the lord some praises
[1:20:49] paul could i rock back and said i'm an
[1:20:51] apostle i am a dis
[1:20:53] i am a doc paul could i rock back on all
[1:20:55] of that he did not
[1:20:57] he said the reason i'm doing this
[1:20:59] because he said because
[1:21:01] he's like a box i buffered my body
[1:21:02] handed roughly disciplined by hardship
[1:21:04] and chopped jewett
[1:21:05] for fear that after proclaiming that
[1:21:07] others the gospel and things pertain to
[1:21:09] it i myself should become unfit
[1:21:11] oh my hallelujah ephesians 4 amplifies
[1:21:14] to let him the team steal no more like
[1:21:16] thieves and children
[1:21:18] rather than be industrious making an
[1:21:19] honest even in his own hands let no foul
[1:21:21] or polluting language or evil word who
[1:21:23] should do it for you
[1:21:25] that is your mouth that you come out
[1:21:27] your mouth
[1:21:28] but only such speech as in good and
[1:21:31] beneficial to the spiritual progress of
[1:21:33] others
[1:21:33] as is fitting to the need and occasion
[1:21:36] that it may be blessing
[1:21:37] and give grace to the fever to those who
[1:21:39] hear it oh my
[1:21:41] and then there's other scripture this is
[1:21:43] a colossians chapter 3

[1:22:09] amplified of it

[1:22:24] impurity
[1:22:25] sensual appetite unholy desires and all
[1:22:27] greed and consciousness
[1:22:29] for that is idolatry the define of self
[1:22:31] and
[1:22:32] other created things instead of god oh

[1:26:55] subjections
[1:26:56] because i fear that i be a cast away
[1:27:00] having preached this gospel friends
[1:27:04] the bible talk about working your own
[1:27:05] salvation out
[1:27:07] with fear and trembling
[1:27:10] it's nothing to take lightly he came
[1:27:12] unto his own he don't receive them now
[1:27:15] these people were so arrogant when jesus
[1:27:17] began to preach
[1:27:19] the ball all sign has hit man in the
[1:27:20] wilderness
[1:27:22] and jesus sent everyone dead and that

[1:27:35] before ibram was i am. friends
[1:27:39] this is serious the people that he was
[1:27:42] supposed to come to and receive and
[1:27:44] rejected him amen
[1:27:46] the so-called elected people and israel
[1:27:49] and
[1:27:50] had the covenant and all the history
[1:27:52] behind them
[1:27:53] they rejected the christ and it gave the
[1:27:56] opening for us gentiles
[1:27:58] to receive him do you see now how easy
[1:28:02] it is for god to reconnect with the jews
[1:28:04] and go to call out 104 000. begin to
