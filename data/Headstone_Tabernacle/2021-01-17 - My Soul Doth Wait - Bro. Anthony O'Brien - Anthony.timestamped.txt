[41:00] spiritual wickedness and high places
[41:03] coming to crush coming to cut off the
[41:06] pride
[41:07] hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah
[41:10] isn't that right
[41:11] but god make a promise that when the
[41:13] enemy
[41:14] cometh like a flood the spirit
[41:17] of god the spirit of god
[41:21] hallelujah don't you be afraid of the
[41:22] spirit of god
[41:24] oh hallelujah isn't that right amen we
[41:28] talk about the word and
[41:29] praise god we preach a word for so many
[41:31] years but what are we looking for
[41:33] in this season is the spirit of god
[41:37] to come upon the word and make it live
[41:41] and make it manifest itself only god
[41:44] could do that
[41:46] that's what i'm waiting on my soul
[41:49] taught wait
[41:50] and in his word do i
[41:53] hope oh hallelujah
[41:58] glory so let's get to it my there's
[42:01] always a period in time
[42:04] in the christian journey when god gave a
[42:07] promise
[42:08] of something and then god makes us
[42:11] wait for that promise hallelujah isn't
[42:14] that right
[42:15] if he didn't make you wait there'll be
[42:18] no need for faith
[42:20] because he just give it to you right
[42:22] away but when he makes you wait
[42:25] the trial of your faith
[42:28] worketh patience waiting on god
[42:33] waiting for god to do as
[42:36] he said he would do you can't make it
[42:40] happen
[42:41] you can't force it to happen it's just
[42:44] got to happen that way
[42:46] amen is not right i remember the one
[42:48] time the prophet was saying something he
[42:50] show a vision of something and i think
[42:52] he shared it with the brother
[42:54] and so on something like that and the
[42:56] brother so only understood what the
[42:57] prophet is saying and
[42:59] and it began to play itself out in front
[43:01] of them
[43:02] and the brother praise god he saw it
[43:04] happening
[43:06] and he just held his silence he held his
[43:07] peace praise god and
[43:09] after a while everything worked out the
[43:11] way it was supposed to work out
[43:13] and the prophet turned to the brother
[43:14] and he said thank you for keeping the
[43:16] vision
[43:18] thank you for not for for not breaking
[43:20] your silence
[43:21] praise god because what was supposed to
[43:23] happen was supposed to happen
[43:25] praise god and it couldn't happen any
[43:27] other way but proving that what god
[43:29] showed a prophet
[43:30] could not fail it had to be done
[43:34] according to the vision and whatever
[43:37] vision
[43:37] god spoke upon in your life all in a cut
[43:40] to come to pass
[43:41] i don't care what the enemy says i don't
[43:44] care what the opposition says
[43:46] i don't care how it looks right now the
[43:49] vision
[43:50] is still true the vision is still to our
[43:54] appointed time
[43:55] through retiree wait for it
[43:59] it shall surely come to pass it will not
[44:02] tarry oh hallelujah hallelujah
[44:06] hallelujah
[44:08] so god makes us wait and i love how
[44:11] he makes us wait he reveals his plan
[44:15] and purpose for our lives and gives us a
[44:19] vision
[44:20] and then goes away leaving us only with
[44:24] the vision
[44:25] of how his word will unfold
[44:28] oh hallelujah isn't that right and when
[44:31] all
[44:32] else fails us when our reasonings fail
[44:36] when our emotions fail when our
[44:39] conscience fail
[44:41] oh when these five senses fail when
[44:44] these five avenues
[44:45] fail the only thing that's left standing
[44:50] is your faith in what god said oh
[44:53] hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah
[44:56] hallelujah
[44:57] we ought to walk by faith and not by
[44:59] these five senses
[45:01] we come into this world isn't that right
[45:04] sita is feel smelling here
[45:06] that is how we interact with this
[45:08] reality but this morning there's a
[45:10] greater reality
[45:12] that you cannot see with your natural
[45:14] eyes
[45:15] but it's right in front of you this
[45:17] morning there's something more real than
[45:19] this
[45:20] that's taking place right now in front
[45:22] of you that you can't see with your
[45:24] naked eyes
[45:26] but it's right in front of you right in
[45:28] front of you is the presence of god
[45:30] right around you is his angels oh it
[45:33] takes sense to keep charge
[45:36] to keep thee and all thy wage unless you
[45:39] dash your foot against a stone
[45:41] god is here this morning he's been with
[45:44] you even in the dark times
[45:48] even in the dreary times when you felt
[45:50] like you couldn't hold on

[45:57] giving your theophany a charge giving
[46:00] you a charge in your spirit
[46:02] saying come on you can make it
[46:05] come on you can overcome greater is he
[46:09] that is in you
[46:10] than he that is in the world oh a crater
[46:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah of faith in you

[46:29] come here by chance

[46:37] strategy
[46:38] according to god's divine plan he woke
[46:41] me up this
[46:42] morning and when he woke me up this
[46:44] morning

[46:48] all to destroy the works of the enemy he
[46:51] was raised up
[46:52] to declare the works of the lord the
[46:55] lord had chastened me sore
[46:57] but he had not given me over unto death
[47:01] open to me the cage of righteousness
[47:05] i will go into them and i will praise
[47:08] the name of the lord
[47:10] oh i come to praise him i come to
[47:12] worship

[47:17] at who's next to me and who's in front
[47:19] of me praise god
[47:20] i got my eye on the price
[47:23] i got my eye on the holy ghost
[47:26] oh he's leading the charge he's leading
[47:29] the way
[47:30] oh for whatever backward never
[47:35] no retreat no surrender

[49:12] for this morning
[49:13] we didn't bring our intellectuals we
[49:16] didn't bring all smarts and all know
[49:17] hows
[49:18] when god's ready to use a man oh he gets
[49:21] god called man

[49:48] of us are being tested this morning
[49:51] some to the waters some to the flood
[49:54] some two great childs but all through
[49:57] the
[49:58] blood oh he brings his sons and
[50:00] daughters

[50:04] something in your soul
[50:08] [Music]

[50:39] he says i am god and i change not
[50:42] and my soul taught weight and in his
[50:46] word
[50:47] do i hope isaiah 40 verse 8 says the
[50:50] grass withereth
[50:52] the flower fadeth because the spirit of
[50:55] the lord
[50:57] bloweth upon it surely the people is as
[51:00] grass
[51:02] all things all things of the flesh is as
[51:04] grass this morning
[51:06] all your cares all what you what you
[51:08] want and what you feel what you don't
[51:10] like
[51:11] all that is as grass this morning oh
[51:13] hallelujah all riches
[51:15] all powers of this world oh it has
[51:18] crashed this morning
[51:19] oh hallelujah what shall stand the grass
[51:22] withereth
[51:23] and the flower fadeth but the word of
[51:26] our god
[51:27] shall stand forever forever forever
[51:32] what word he have concerning you this
[51:34] morning
[51:35] it's gonna stand forever i don't care
[51:38] what principality
[51:39] what power what spiritual ruler
[51:43] in high places is against you this
[51:44] morning i'm here to tell you
[51:47] no weapon formed against you is gonna
[51:50] prosper
[51:51] the lord is upon your life you are
[51:54] promised to see the glory of the lord
[51:58] oh hallelujah attach your promise that's
[52:01] your expectation this morning
[52:04] oh hallelujah
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:09] there is great blessing
[52:12] in the weight
[52:13] [Music]
[52:15] there's a great work that's being done
[52:18] in the waiting
[52:19] room and there's a saying that goes i
[52:23] like this he says it's
[52:24] not about the destination but it's about
[52:27] the journey that took you there
[52:30] and i believe this morning that god is
[52:32] interested
[52:33] in our journey because our adoption is
[52:36] not
[52:37] based on not nice things and if people
[52:39] like us so
[52:41] people have elected us or voted us a
[52:43] great man or great woman but
[52:45] but your adoption is based on your
[52:47] conduct
[52:48] and your behavior how you conduct
[52:51] yourself
[52:52] amidst the trials that he in his wisdom
[52:56] permits to come your way oh isn't that
[52:59] right
[53:00] sounds a lot like job this morning oh
[53:03] hallelujah isn't that right
[53:06] god turned to the devil i said have you
[53:08] considered my servant job
[53:11] hallelujah isn't that right and the
[53:13] devil responded said yeah
[53:14] he's a blessed man but that's cause you
[53:17] got a hedge around him
[53:19] i see you got a protection barrier
[53:21] around him
[53:22] everywhere he go you are going with him
[53:26] you dispatch angels to go before and
[53:29] behind
[53:30] oh hannah to cut the enemy off the devil
[53:32] see him long time
[53:34] but he couldn't touch him because god
[53:36] had his hand upon him
[53:38] oh holland that's how you are this
[53:40] morning the devil could watch
[53:42] but he can't touch unless he get
[53:45] permission
[53:46] oh to approach oh hallelujah to come
[53:49] close
[53:50] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[53:52] hallelujah
[53:53] because god got his hand upon somebody
[53:56] this morning
[53:58] you might not feel like it oh you might
[54:01] be able to see it with your natural eye
[54:03] but his hand is there and when you feel
[54:06] like you can't carry yourself
[54:08] he carried you and when you look back
[54:12] at the footprints in the sand there's
[54:15] only one set of footprints
[54:17] that was jesus carrying you
[54:21] when you can carry yourself or
[54:24] somebody preached back to me this
[54:26] morning
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:28] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah
[54:32] all my hope is in jesus
[54:36] oh my soul thought wait and in his word
[54:41] do i hope oh
[54:44] is that the way you feel this morning
[54:52] [Applause]
[54:54] it's the journey that takes you there
[54:58] it's a journey that shapes you
[55:01] it is what molds you
[55:05] god finally gets an opportunity
[55:08] to put his hands upon your life when
[55:12] you're in that space of trying
[55:14] when you're in that place of great test
[55:17] of great tempest
[55:19] of great storm that's when he gets an
[55:21] opportunity
[55:23] to put his hand upon your life when you
[55:26] first come to the lord there's an
[55:28] excitement
[55:29] oh you're waiting for service right now
[55:33] and it's 3am saturday you're all excited
[55:37] you want to testify you want to share
[55:40] what the lord
[55:41] has done for you in your life but that's
[55:44] only the beginning
[55:46] that's when they're coming out when they
[55:48] were coming out of egypt
[55:50] brother there was a rejoicing in their
[55:51] hearts they were so happy to leave that
[55:54] stuff behind
[55:55] isn't that right that's how the
[55:57] christian journey is
[55:59] but it gets to a point when god takes
[56:02] you through the long way
[56:05] call it isn't that right he loves to
[56:07] take you through the long road
[56:10] because that road is designed to get the
[56:13] egypt
[56:14] out of you you might have come out of
[56:16] egypt
[56:18] but that egypt might still be there
[56:20] snake in the heart
[56:22] isn't that right sitting there quiet
[56:25] not saying nothing he's still there
[56:28] you're praising god you're coming to
[56:30] church
[56:31] paying attention but that snake is still
[56:34] in there
[56:35] attack fire to take him out take fire to
[56:38] burn him out
[56:39] and take hot childs hot testings
[56:43] thinking not strange the fiery trials
[56:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[56:52] but that's god's school of character
[56:55] training
[56:56] and development how god trains his man
[57:00] how god shapes his man oh won't he do it
[57:03] but the prophet said only god could
[57:05] train a man like that
[57:07] he'd take him to the wilderness take him
[57:09] to the valley
[57:11] take him to the mountain take him here
[57:13] take him there
[57:14] what is it it's the dove leading the
[57:18] eagles
[57:19] all the way to the adoption oh some to
[57:22] the waters
[57:23] some to the flood what god's gonna bring
[57:26] you through brother
[57:27] oh i'll wait until my
[57:30] change come that's what job said
[57:34] in the midst of his trial hallelujah
[57:37] i know my redeemer living though the
[57:40] skin worms destroyed his flesh
[57:43] but all fleshes as grass anyway why
[57:46] potter
[57:47] why why make why make a fuss holler i'm
[57:49] more interested
[57:51] in my soul's condition april brandon
[57:54] said i'd rather see my soul well
[57:56] then my body well anytime let me die in
[58:00] peace

[58:39] [Music]
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:43] all glory
[58:44] [Music]
[58:47] many many many many men
[58:52] proverbs 3 and verse 11 says my son
[58:56] despise not the chastening of the lord
[59:00] neither be wary of his correction
[59:03] for whom the lord love it he correct it
[59:08] even as a father the son and whom he
[59:10] delighted
[59:12] if you really love your children if you
[59:14] want them to go right
[59:16] you won't be afraid to correct them to
[59:18] instruct them don't go that way
[59:20] don't go that way oh isn't that right
[59:24] sometimes a mother scolds her children
[59:27] it seem harsh but she know the dangers
[59:31] because sometimes she walked that road
[59:33] before oh
[59:34] hastened to the word of your father your
[59:36] mother hallelujah they know the road
[59:39] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[59:41] right they've walked that road before
[59:44] oh isn't that right young young brother
[59:46] young sister
[59:47] hallelujah and if god love his
[59:50] uh if a father love his children so much
[59:53] how much god this morning
[59:55] is interested in your face how much he
[59:58] will correct you how much will he
[1:00:00] instruct you in righteousness don't be
[1:00:03] wary of his chasteners
[1:00:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah but have an
[1:00:07] open heart
[1:00:08] have an open amen open up your soul
[1:00:10] honor to receive
[1:00:11] god this morning to receive correction
[1:00:14] to receive instruction
[1:00:16] all harness that god could deal with you
[1:00:18] and show you the way
[1:00:21] because to be honest we don't know the
[1:00:23] way
[1:00:24] sometimes we try to act all brave we try
[1:00:27] to act all coy and like we know what's
[1:00:29] going on but the truth is
[1:00:31] we don't know we have not been this way
[1:00:33] before
[1:00:34] i never had to come to church in masks
[1:00:36] but we're in new territory
[1:00:38] praise god we in a new place god's
[1:00:41] getting ready to show us something
[1:00:43] to unveil his glory like never before
[1:00:46] no eye has seen nowhere has heard
[1:00:50] what god has in store for you oh
[1:00:52] hallelujah praise and if you don't know
[1:00:55] then lord show me where to go
[1:00:58] what to do give me the right attitude
[1:01:02] oh holy god the tutor the holy spirit
[1:01:06] is looking at your attitude in
[1:01:09] every test isn't that right
[1:01:12] before the sun comes to adoption he's
[1:01:14] got to go through
[1:01:15] tests and the tutor is what is there
[1:01:18] hallelujah isn't that right and then the
[1:01:21] natural lift is gone
[1:01:22] if men's got tutors to look over their
[1:01:24] sons
[1:01:25] before they come into position then how
[1:01:28] much god has got a tutor
[1:01:30] the holy spirit but this tutor is not
[1:01:32] limited by time and space
[1:01:34] no no no he can move anywhere he can be
[1:01:37] anywhere
[1:01:38] oh he's right where you are he's with
[1:01:41] you on the street
[1:01:42] he's with you in your home he's with you
[1:01:44] in your car
[1:01:45] he's listening oh hallelujah praise god
[1:01:49] amen hallelujah
[1:01:52] oh hallelujah
[1:01:55] he hears your cry this morning
[1:01:58] second peter 4 and 1 to 2 says for as
[1:02:01] much then
[1:02:02] as christ had suffered for us in the
[1:02:04] flesh
[1:02:05] arm yourself likewise with the same mind
[1:02:09] for he that suffered in the flesh had
[1:02:12] ceased from sin
[1:02:14] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:02:16] of his time in the flesh
[1:02:18] to the loss of men but to the will of
[1:02:21] god
[1:02:22] amen isn't that right so this suffering
[1:02:25] in the flesh is to bring into a state of
[1:02:27] deadness
[1:02:28] to self-debt to your ideas debt
[1:02:32] to what you think to what you feel oh if
[1:02:35] you're dead you're not supposed to be
[1:02:36] able to respond
[1:02:38] isn't that right then when the tests
[1:02:40] come you have no self to defend
[1:02:42] oh because you reckon yourself ted to
[1:02:45] the things of the world ted
[1:02:47] to what they say about you dead to the
[1:02:50] doubts dead to the fears
[1:02:52] dead to unbelief oh hallelujah and then
[1:02:55] god
[1:02:56] could put his hand in your life god
[1:02:59] becomes life to you
[1:03:00] because everything else is dead he beats
[1:03:03] it out
[1:03:04] he strips it out he boils it out oh
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] whatever he has to go you through to get
[1:03:11] you ready
[1:03:13] to be molded in the hands of the maker
[1:03:17] this morning isn't that right amen
[1:03:20] little vote down verse 12 says beloved
[1:03:24] think it not strange concerning a fiery
[1:03:26] trial
[1:03:27] which is to try you as though some
[1:03:29] strange thing happened to you
[1:03:32] but rejoice oh this morning
[1:03:35] inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ's
[1:03:38] sufferings
[1:03:40] that when his glory shall be revealed
[1:03:44] ye may be glad also with exceeding
[1:03:47] joy and if you be reproached for the
[1:03:50] name of christ
[1:03:52] happy i.e oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:56] you ought to be glad this morning to be
[1:03:58] reproached for the name of christ
[1:04:00] to bear to reproach hallelujah amen amen
[1:04:03] for the spirit of the glory of god
[1:04:05] rested upon you on their part he is evil
[1:04:09] spoken of
[1:04:10] but on your part he is glorified
[1:04:13] amen and the prophet was praying here
[1:04:18] excuse me prophetess praying he said
[1:04:20] then he said
[1:04:21] uh thinking not strange that these
[1:04:23] trials come
[1:04:25] they're only working out for all good
[1:04:29] and to perfect us and bring us into that
[1:04:32] place
[1:04:33] these great deserts of experience oh i
[1:04:36] love that
[1:04:37] these great deserts of experience
[1:04:41] where righteous men are molded
[1:04:44] into saints we thank we thank thee for
[1:04:47] these experiences lord
[1:04:50] for we would no mean no no wise want to
[1:04:52] do anything contrary to your will
[1:04:55] but we pray father that in this we'll be
[1:04:58] brought closer to you
[1:05:00] isn't that right amen just a few more
[1:05:02] scriptures and we get on

[1:05:22] you are not being tempted
[1:05:24] if you are not being tested be very
[1:05:26] worried
[1:05:27] because the devil has all oh hallelujah
[1:05:30] but there's an elect this morning
[1:05:32] that is on the earth that is being
[1:05:35] tested
[1:05:36] that is being tried oh holla he can get
[1:05:38] all but
[1:05:39] he can get some but he cannot get all
[1:05:41] this morning
[1:05:42] god's got some in his hand oh holla that
[1:05:45] he is using
[1:05:47] to shake this world one more time oh
[1:05:50] hallelujah tempted and tried oh
[1:05:53] halloween offbeat to wonder
[1:05:55] but all god is able to deliver he is
[1:05:57] able to restore
[1:05:59] he's only testing you to see if you will
[1:06:02] hold on
[1:06:03] to see if you won't let go of his
[1:06:06] promises
[1:06:07] to see if the faith in you could stand
[1:06:10] the test of time
[1:06:11] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:17] knowing this that the trine of your
[1:06:21] faith
[1:06:22] worketh patience but let patience have
[1:06:25] her perfect work
[1:06:27] that he may be perfect and entire
[1:06:30] meaning whole and wanting nothing oh
[1:06:33] isn't that right
[1:06:34] amen and amen hallelujah glory to god
[1:06:39] amen so god shapes us
[1:06:43] and he moves us and he makes us into
[1:06:45] what he wants us to be
[1:06:47] isn't that right hallelujah and i wanted
[1:06:50] to bring out this here what the prophet
[1:06:52] is talking about
[1:06:54] on the masterpiece amen
[1:06:57] and how he was talking about
[1:06:59] michelangelo
[1:07:00] amen isn't that right the great
[1:07:01] sculpture who sculpted that
[1:07:04] moses uh uh image
[1:07:07] isn't that right out of the rock and he
[1:07:09] says here in this masterpiece he had
[1:07:11] made it
[1:07:12] he said it cost him something to do that
[1:07:16] he said he was a great man and it cost a
[1:07:19] big part of his life talking about the
[1:07:21] sculpture himself
[1:07:22] because he was many many years in
[1:07:25] carving it out
[1:07:26] oh it don't come for free friends it
[1:07:29] come at a cost
[1:07:31] jesus dying for you came at a cost
[1:07:35] but he was willing to pay that cost
[1:07:37] because you was worth
[1:07:39] something you was worth taking the time
[1:07:43] you was worth looking at you was worth
[1:07:46] thinking about
[1:07:47] oh hallelujah he was worth dying for
[1:07:49] this morning
[1:07:51] it cost something but it was worth the
[1:07:54] cost
[1:07:54] because you are precious in his sight
[1:07:57] this morning
[1:07:58] oh hallelujah he loves you this morning
[1:08:02] don't ever make the devil make you feel
[1:08:04] like you are worthless this morning
[1:08:06] why did he die why did he pay all this
[1:08:09] price
[1:08:10] why would he do all that he did oh it
[1:08:13] was not for naught
[1:08:14] oh but your soul was worth saving
[1:08:17] oh i thank him oh because he delivered
[1:08:21] me
[1:08:22] he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:08:25] and i'm so glad he did
[1:08:29] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:08:32] the bible talks about the love of god
[1:08:35] that covers the whole world that covers
[1:08:38] all the sin isn't that right
[1:08:40] isn't that right but then the bible also
[1:08:42] talks about his elective love
[1:08:45] his predestinated love that's god's
[1:08:48] sovereign ability
[1:08:50] to choose whom he will he said jacob i
[1:08:53] love esau i hate how you gonna fight up
[1:08:57] with that
[1:08:58] that's god's elective love because god
[1:09:01] saw something in jacob that he loves
[1:09:05] jacob didn't care about nothing else but
[1:09:08] the bird right
[1:09:09] he had a thirst in his soul for the bird
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:13] and god's children this morning have a
[1:09:16] hunger in their soul
[1:09:18] have a thirst for something real they
[1:09:20] don't care about natural things
[1:09:23] they don't care about wild peas and
[1:09:24] honey they come for the good rights
[1:09:27] they need the birthright give me what is
[1:09:30] promised
[1:09:31] give me what is mine i come for the holy
[1:09:34] ghost
[1:09:35] i don't have strength this morning i
[1:09:38] need your strength
[1:09:39] i don't have what it takes give me your
[1:09:43] spirit
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:49] god's children ain't afraid to cry
[1:09:52] oh they gotta cry in their spirits a
[1:09:55] passion to know the word
[1:09:57] a filth and desire to please god
[1:10:00] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:07] and if you don't have it then pray for
[1:10:10] it
[1:10:11] because that's what you need in your
[1:10:13] soul that's what the young people need
[1:10:15] that's what the caleb's need that's what
[1:10:17] the deacon needs that's what the elder
[1:10:19] needs that what the minister needs we
[1:10:21] all need it
[1:10:22] oh hallelujah my soul thought wait
[1:10:26] and it is further what do i hope all
[1:10:29] his word is true this morning his word
[1:10:32] is real this morning
[1:10:33] oh hallelujah is just as true it will
[1:10:36] stand shore
[1:10:38] amidst the darkness amidst the trial
[1:10:40] amidst the temptation
[1:10:42] when all else is false all else crumbles
[1:10:45] when all else fails his word is the only
[1:10:48] thing left standing
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:52] brother branham said michelangelo had to
[1:10:54] get a vision in his mind
[1:10:57] of what he was trying to create before
[1:11:00] he created it
[1:11:01] and you know that excites me because i'm
[1:11:04] an artist i'm a designer
[1:11:06] amen amen and the way the prophet
[1:11:08] brought it out
[1:11:09] amen hallelujah i saw it so real he
[1:11:12] really caught the mind of an artist
[1:11:15] because that's what it has to be and it
[1:11:17] can't be wavering
[1:11:19] it has to be one vision you can't wake
[1:11:23] up the next morning and change the
[1:11:24] vision
[1:11:26] because five months down the road you
[1:11:28] get a
[1:11:29] shape-shifting sculpture
[1:11:32] isn't that right it's got to be singular
[1:11:36] single-eye single motive one objective
[1:11:40] one purpose you're trying to achieve
[1:11:43] isn't that right and you gotta keep your
[1:11:46] mind on that
[1:11:47] no matter what distractions come your
[1:11:49] way your focus
[1:11:51] on this one vision and when god created
[1:11:54] us
[1:11:55] when god had you in his mind he had one
[1:11:58] purpose
[1:11:59] one vision of how he was gonna make it
[1:12:03] of one vision of how you was going to
[1:12:06] look
[1:12:08] god had the end picture
[1:12:11] already painted in his mind before he
[1:12:14] even start getting to work
[1:12:17] oh hallelujah
[1:12:21] oh i don't want to take too long on this
[1:12:24] but hear me now
[1:12:26] now now now now it's it's a difficult
[1:12:28] thing
[1:12:29] to do this what he's doing here
[1:12:30] sculpting because
[1:12:33] it's like cutting hair like your
[1:12:35] brothers don't know it
[1:12:36] if you go to the bar and you cut off too
[1:12:38] much oh you're in trouble
[1:12:40] you can't fix it you can't add back
[1:12:43] peace
[1:12:46] take a screwball isn't that right
[1:12:49] so so so that's how it is it's that kind
[1:12:52] of a technique
[1:12:54] where he's taken away all that is not
[1:12:57] the image
[1:12:59] so that the image could remain so that
[1:13:02] the vision could remain
[1:13:04] now if you add in stuff you could feel
[1:13:06] free because you could add take away
[1:13:08] it's not but the nature of the thing
[1:13:12] is such that it's not like that you take
[1:13:15] away
[1:13:16] and that's it what's left is the image
[1:13:19] so you got to really take your time and
[1:13:22] you got to really know
[1:13:24] what your next move is every move has
[1:13:27] got to be
[1:13:28] strategic every step has got to be
[1:13:31] ordered
[1:13:32] otherwise you're going to mess it up and
[1:13:35] god can't afford
[1:13:37] to mess this up he's waited too long
[1:13:41] six thousand years a long time to wait
[1:13:45] on this masterpiece
[1:13:47] of a bride that he is making in this
[1:13:50] last hour
[1:13:54] oh do you hear me this morning
[1:13:57] that's why he loves to wait because in
[1:14:01] the waiting there's patience
[1:14:03] to know where to go next what to do next
[1:14:07] where to chisel sometimes he'd sit and
[1:14:09] stare
[1:14:10] the sculpture and look at this rock and
[1:14:13] people think he's crazy
[1:14:15] but he's just waiting to put the right
[1:14:18] chip
[1:14:18] in place to make it more perfect
[1:14:22] oh hallelujah to make it bad to make it
[1:14:26] blossom
[1:14:31] [Applause]
[1:14:37] this morning and we were sharing some
[1:14:38] things and and it came out to me you
[1:14:40] know he said
[1:14:40] that's how it is because you know even
[1:14:42] sometimes
[1:14:44] that sometimes when you're working on
[1:14:45] something i'll tell you this give it a
[1:14:46] little tidbit
[1:14:48] when you're working on a piece of work
[1:14:49] sometimes it's good to get
[1:14:51] out of the play get out of the way go do
[1:14:53] something come back
[1:14:55] the vision remains true but when you
[1:14:58] come back
[1:14:59] praise god the artist it gets a fresh
[1:15:02] a refreshing of what's supposed to take
[1:15:04] place
[1:15:05] and sometimes god seemed to go away for
[1:15:08] a while
[1:15:09] in our lives seems like nothing is going
[1:15:11] on
[1:15:12] but the artist is getting ready to make
[1:15:14] his next move
[1:15:16] and in order to make his next move he's
[1:15:17] got to be in the right frame of mind
[1:15:19] hallelujah hallelujah he was perfect the
[1:15:21] first time so
[1:15:22] so he's dwelling on it isn't that right
[1:15:25] hello isn't that right and in that
[1:15:27] silence you're there
[1:15:28] and sometimes you feel like you're
[1:15:30] forsaken like you're abandoned
[1:15:32] like nothing's going on but god's got
[1:15:35] his mind on you still
[1:15:37] oh he might not be where you want him to
[1:15:40] be
[1:15:42] but he'll be there on time oh hallelujah
[1:15:45] don't you worry he'll be there to rescue
[1:15:48] your soul
[1:15:49] oh he didn't promise that the road
[1:15:52] wouldn't get wary
[1:15:53] he didn't promise that you would meet up
[1:15:55] obstacles along the way
[1:15:57] but his promise this morning is to catch
[1:16:00] you
[1:16:00] every time you fall oh hallelujah to
[1:16:03] make a way for you
[1:16:05] or to see you through
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:10] hallelujah prophet said and when he got
[1:16:14] it all perfect
[1:16:15] every corner every place rubbed and the
[1:16:17] eyes just right
[1:16:18] every here every beard all the way it
[1:16:20] was talking about that sculpture he
[1:16:22] stood off and he looked at it
[1:16:24] the prophet said i think had many years
[1:16:27] of labor
[1:16:28] how he had to hold that same vision all
[1:16:30] the time in his mind
[1:16:31] of what he was going to do and just to
[1:16:34] think that vision on his mind for so
[1:16:35] many years
[1:16:36] to make it look just exactly to what it
[1:16:38] was and then he caught the vision
[1:16:41] isn't that right and when he got away he
[1:16:42] perfected it till he
[1:16:44] really caught perfect prophet said he
[1:16:47] stood and looked
[1:16:48] at it and when he finished up that
[1:16:50] morning
[1:16:51] with a hammer in his hand he was so
[1:16:54] inspired when he looked at it
[1:16:55] because a vision of his mind was
[1:16:56] standing before him in reality
[1:16:59] what he had seen and his conception of
[1:17:02] moses
[1:17:03] praise god in that the toils the hours
[1:17:05] and everything else he said write a
[1:17:07] vision until it's completed the prophet
[1:17:09] said he took a hammer
[1:17:10] and he struck that image and said speak
[1:17:13] oh hallelujah it was so real to him he
[1:17:16] felt like it could come alive
[1:17:18] he felt like he could speak but brother
[1:17:20] there's gonna come a real masterpiece
[1:17:21] one of these days
[1:17:23] that when the power of this church rises
[1:17:26] when the power of the dynamics really
[1:17:29] strikes his pride
[1:17:30] or she will speak oh she will speak for
[1:17:34] god
[1:17:35] or she'll be in his image she'll be in
[1:17:37] his likeness
[1:17:38] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:42] oh glory to god do you believe it this
[1:17:44] morning
[1:17:45] hallelujah oh my my my my
[1:17:50] hallelujah from god call man the prophet
[1:17:53] here says
[1:17:54] and we thought tonight and we think on
[1:17:56] that he's talking about revivals
[1:17:58] and he said and remember that in the
[1:18:00] midst of all this cry
[1:18:02] god cannot send a revival until he's got
[1:18:06] men in shape to take it
[1:18:09] we cannot have a revival there was his
[1:18:12] wisdom
[1:18:12] until we get men god
[1:18:15] called men god trained men
[1:18:19] that's not trained up in the schools of
[1:18:22] theology
[1:18:23] and of education but rugged
[1:18:26] men of faith that god has brought up
[1:18:30] in the school of his rugged training
[1:18:34] men who are not afraid to face the fire
[1:18:38] man who has come in the presence of god
[1:18:41] who knows his power who knows his
[1:18:44] omnipotence
[1:18:45] and who knows his healing power oh
[1:18:49] hallelujah is god's training such a man
[1:18:53] in this hour in this season oh
[1:18:56] isn't that right oh holla that's why
[1:18:58] he's got to take you through
[1:19:00] so that he could shape you for this
[1:19:02] great revival
[1:19:04] if you're talking about revivals then
[1:19:06] there's got to be a shaping
[1:19:08] that comes first there's got to be a
[1:19:10] molding that comes first
[1:19:12] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:19:18] even though david was anointed he had to
[1:19:22] be on the back side of the desert
[1:19:25] a long time i don't know how long he was
[1:19:27] there but but
[1:19:28] that's where god trains his men there on
[1:19:32] the backside
[1:19:33] in the deserts of the court experiences
[1:19:36] like the prophet said isn't that right
[1:19:39] where he trains you
[1:19:40] where he molds you where you face the
[1:19:43] lion
[1:19:44] where you face the bear by yourself
[1:19:46] ain't nobody around
[1:19:48] nobody to encourage you but david said i
[1:19:51] encourage myself
[1:19:52] oh i'll look at myself in the mirror i
[1:19:55] tell myself
[1:19:56] i'm going to church this morning oh hell
[1:19:59] you stay there
[1:20:00] i'm going to church this morning i'm
[1:20:03] gonna lift up my hands
[1:20:05] i'm gonna praise my god i'm gonna tell
[1:20:08] him
[1:20:09] how much i love him doesn't matter how i
[1:20:11] feel
[1:20:12] doesn't matter what's going on in my
[1:20:14] situation
[1:20:15] god's gonna get the glory in my story
[1:20:19] don't you worry oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:27] oh man hallelujah
[1:20:30] isn't that right some man that's trained
[1:20:33] to know
[1:20:34] the living god it's all right to train
[1:20:36] him by the word he said
[1:20:38] but the letter kill it the spirit give
[1:20:40] it life
[1:20:41] and before we can have this revival god
[1:20:43] has to call out
[1:20:44] and train men god trained men
[1:20:48] to carry this message he said and they
[1:20:51] don't
[1:20:51] care what the opposition is they're
[1:20:54] willing to go
[1:20:55] to the fiery furnace in defeat
[1:20:58] or to the lion's den oh i hear me this
[1:21:02] morning
[1:21:03] they're willing to go do he slay me
[1:21:06] yet i trust him it's god that's leading
[1:21:10] he won't kill you he'll just take the
[1:21:12] world out of you
[1:21:13] but go through brother some through the
[1:21:15] waters you've got to go through
[1:21:17] oh holla but in the waiting there's a
[1:21:20] blessing there
[1:21:22] in the persian in the prison of god's
[1:21:25] purification
[1:21:26] that's where god melts you that's where
[1:21:29] god molds you
[1:21:30] that's where god shapes you
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:38] david was supposed to be king he might
[1:21:41] not
[1:21:42] have looked like it when he was in the
[1:21:43] desert if you saw the end of david's
[1:21:46] story
[1:21:46] you would think how could a king be
[1:21:49] already
[1:21:50] in the desert taking care of sheep
[1:21:54] smelling like sheep huh it doesn't look
[1:21:58] like the end of the vision but god knows
[1:22:00] what he's doing
[1:22:01] god's getting it ready praise god knows
[1:22:04] how to shape how to mold
[1:22:06] david went quite to went through quite a
[1:22:08] journey but when he got
[1:22:10] to where god wanted him he was fit for
[1:22:12] the office
[1:22:13] he was fit for the position he was
[1:22:16] bright what god needed
[1:22:17] oh hallelujah isn't that right isn't
[1:22:20] that right
[1:22:22] look at joseph amen god
[1:22:25] give him a dream said amen the sheaves
[1:22:28] will bow to you isn't that right and the
[1:22:29] stars and so on
[1:22:31] and he's telling his brethren because
[1:22:33] because he's so excited about this
[1:22:34] testimony
[1:22:37] and his brothers are not so excited
[1:22:39] about his testimony
[1:22:41] matter of fact they jealoused him isn't
[1:22:43] that right they hated him
[1:22:45] without a call as the prophet said why
[1:22:47] did they hate him
[1:22:48] because he was the word oh and he was
[1:22:50] bringing them the word
[1:22:52] oh and they hated him for it oh isn't
[1:22:55] that right
[1:22:56] and it turned against him but all that
[1:22:58] was in god's plan
[1:23:00] because they sought to kill him and one
[1:23:02] of the brothers said don't kill him
[1:23:03] don't lay our hands on our brother let's
[1:23:05] tell him off to ishmael is not right
[1:23:07] isn't that right hallelujah praise god
[1:23:10] and god
[1:23:11] hallelujah isn't that right working in
[1:23:13] that plan
[1:23:14] hallelujah praise god lay not a harm on
[1:23:17] him
[1:23:17] i've got a work for him to do in the
[1:23:20] future
[1:23:21] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:23:25] and god takes him he ends up in
[1:23:28] egypt in the house of the captain of the
[1:23:31] god
[1:23:31] potiphar isn't that right and
[1:23:35] i you know in reading this story i
[1:23:37] realized that
[1:23:39] that in there the prophet uh the bible
[1:23:42] says
[1:23:42] that uh in the house of potiphar
[1:23:46] he was still blessed in that position
[1:23:50] even though he was far from home far
[1:23:52] from everything that he knew
[1:23:55] even though far away from his mother his
[1:23:56] father yet where he was
[1:23:59] god blessed him until potiphar gave into
[1:24:02] his hand
[1:24:03] to keep charge over his house and to see
[1:24:06] about his affairs
[1:24:07] god still blessed him there isn't that
[1:24:10] right
[1:24:11] and even when potiphar's wife came and
[1:24:13] began to
[1:24:14] stir up trouble because the bible says
[1:24:17] she didn't come once you know
[1:24:18] she came almost every day harassing
[1:24:22] joseph
[1:24:23] and he said no and every day she come he
[1:24:26] said
[1:24:26] no and he keeps saying nope oh until she
[1:24:29] was wrought
[1:24:31] until she sought to grab at him and
[1:24:33] that's when she ended up with the
[1:24:34] garment isn't that right
[1:24:36] the devil is not gonna ease it up on you
[1:24:38] brother
[1:24:39] he gone come every day the bible said
[1:24:42] he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:24:45] accusing us before all lord day
[1:24:48] and night bringing up your sin bringing
[1:24:51] up your past
[1:24:52] bringing up your sorrows but as fast as
[1:24:55] he bring it up
[1:24:56] the blood of jesus is there like a
[1:24:58] bumper
[1:24:59] bumping off your sin pumping off your
[1:25:02] filth
[1:25:03] oh brother thank god for the blood
[1:25:06] the blood prevails the blood of the
[1:25:09] bleed and lamb
[1:25:11] speaking better things on your behalf
[1:25:14] oh than even the blood of abel or the
[1:25:16] blood of bulls and goats hallelujah
[1:25:19] the blood of jesus christ
[1:25:22] thank him for the blood oh hallelujah
[1:25:24] hallelujah
[1:25:26] and we know the story he ended up in the
[1:25:28] prison house
[1:25:30] but even in that situation he was still
[1:25:34] in charge of things
[1:25:36] he found favor with the prison the head
[1:25:39] of the prison
[1:25:40] and was sent to keep charge over the
[1:25:42] prisoners there
[1:25:44] i'm saying all this to say that when
[1:25:46] god's favor is upon your life
[1:25:49] even when it seems like you're in a dark
[1:25:51] place
[1:25:52] even when it feels like you're in the
[1:25:54] shadows
[1:25:55] god's hand is still upon your life oh
[1:25:58] come on now
[1:26:00] he never let his seed peg bread oh
[1:26:02] hallelujah even though you might not
[1:26:04] have money in your pocket
[1:26:06] but you know god's been providing for
[1:26:08] you
[1:26:09] he bring you food he put clothes on your
[1:26:12] back
[1:26:13] he put gas in your car i can't
[1:26:16] understand it
[1:26:17] i can't even explain it oh it's just
[1:26:19] god's favor
[1:26:21] it's just god's mercy where would i be
[1:26:24] without his love
[1:26:25] where would i be without his mercy
[1:26:28] recognize
[1:26:30] the hand of god in your life this
[1:26:32] morning
[1:26:33] oh and give him praise give him thanks
[1:26:37] oh he made a way out of nowhere
[1:26:42] he provided for you he is jehovah jairo
[1:26:46] he provided for your every need
[1:26:48] according to his
[1:26:50] riches in glory oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:53] hallelujah
[1:26:54] oh in every situation
[1:26:58] he makes a way of escape oh he will not
[1:27:01] give
[1:27:01] you more than you can bear
[1:27:04] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:27:09] hallelujah
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:14] amen oh
[1:27:21] amen amen
[1:27:24] glory to god hallelujah
[1:27:28] when god gets ready to do something in
[1:27:29] the supernatural realms he usually gets
[1:27:31] a man
[1:27:32] that he can put his trust in and anoints
[1:27:36] him
[1:27:37] and sends him out and he's fearless at
[1:27:40] the job
[1:27:41] that's the kind of men we need today
[1:27:45] not polish scholars but men who know god
[1:27:48] in the power of his resurrection
[1:27:50] he said for instance there was a man in
[1:27:52] the bible by the name of moses
[1:27:54] he got all his training he knew all the
[1:27:57] theological theology he knew everything
[1:27:59] he should know
[1:28:00] but even if even if he would have needed
[1:28:02] education he could have
[1:28:04] teach the masters in israel he didn't
[1:28:06] need one thing isn't that right
[1:28:07] he could teach their scientists a thing
[1:28:09] or two isn't that right the prophet said
[1:28:12] he said but yet it take god 40 years
[1:28:16] to beat all of that out of him out there
[1:28:20] in the sands
[1:28:21] out there in the deserts and when he got
[1:28:24] all his intellectual conceptions of god
[1:28:26] beat out of him there in the sands the
[1:28:29] metal
[1:28:30] was ready to be molded over he said and
[1:28:33] that's the way god takes his men
[1:28:36] and beats out all of their fears all of
[1:28:39] their intellectuals
[1:28:40] and the great master potter puts them on
[1:28:44] the wheel
[1:28:45] and begins to maul them over again
[1:28:48] work men worthy oh hallow worthy for the
[1:28:51] master's use
[1:28:53] or vessels to be used for the master's
[1:28:56] use
[1:28:57] god wants to use somebody the spirit of
[1:29:00] god is looking this morning
[1:29:02] for hands that he could use feet that he
[1:29:05] could use
[1:29:06] the devil is looking for people and god
[1:29:08] is looking for people too
[1:29:10] oh i let the dynamics of this church
[1:29:12] getting ready to strike our body
[1:29:15] our bride body on the urge that he could
[1:29:17] move
[1:29:18] and say here is my spirit flowing freely
[1:29:22] i could use him i could use her
[1:29:25] there is my spirit this is my beloved
[1:29:29] one
[1:29:31] in whom i'm well pleased amen
[1:29:36] but it take a process to get us in there
[1:29:39] and that's what we're talking about
[1:29:40] this morning waiting on the lawn for god
[1:29:43] to perform his work
[1:29:46] in our lives and make us what he wants
[1:29:48] us to be
[1:29:50] amen men that great call that he's upon
[1:29:52] your life this morning
[1:29:55] not by chance god gave the vision isn't
[1:29:57] that right
[1:29:58] just like he gave to joseph and joseph
[1:30:01] was doing pretty good in possible house
[1:30:03] you know he he had a good job
[1:30:05] i don't know how long he was there but
[1:30:07] he was working for the captain of the
[1:30:08] guard
[1:30:09] he had a little apartment inside there
[1:30:12] pushing a little chariot
[1:30:13] it wasn't too bad but that's not where
[1:30:17] god wanted
[1:30:17] him and god caused situations
[1:30:21] god caused strife to come into his life
[1:30:25] for a purpose because because god wasn't
[1:30:28] satisfied with with joseph just having a
[1:30:30] good job
[1:30:31] no no he needed to promote joseph who
[1:30:34] already needed to put him early
[1:30:35] where he needed to be because there was
[1:30:38] a famine coming
[1:30:40] there was a famine coming joseph might
[1:30:42] have his nice job and he had his money
[1:30:44] to pay for his coffee but but there's a
[1:30:46] famine coming
[1:30:47] oh hallelujah and you might be doing all
[1:30:49] right but there's a famine coming
[1:30:51] and because there's a famine coming god
[1:30:53] it's got to put you in position
[1:30:55] got to put you in place oh hallelujah
[1:30:58] isn't that right oh hallelujah when the
[1:31:01] trials come
[1:31:02] that when the testing come oh hallelujah
[1:31:04] when the shadow falls
[1:31:06] you'll be in position that god be able
[1:31:08] to use you
[1:31:10] oh thinking not strange or are you
[1:31:12] raised up
[1:31:13] for such a time as this oh hallelujah
[1:31:17] hallelujah hallelujah courts call his
[1:31:19] men
[1:31:20] god's got his women oh where he needs
[1:31:22] them to be
[1:31:23] oh god's getting ready to put his hands
[1:31:25] oh upon his bible pride in the last days
[1:31:29] oh she'll be a mighty army she'll be an
[1:31:32] invincible army brother
[1:31:34] oh there'll be no sound of retreat
[1:31:36] there'll be no sound of surrender
[1:31:38] in this mighty army this morning oh

[1:31:49] or under any situation if it go to the
[1:31:52] fiery furnace
[1:31:54] oh my soul thought wait if i gotta go in
[1:31:57] the lion's den
[1:31:58] my soul taught which oh hallelujah
[1:32:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:04] the prophet said she'll have to save the
[1:32:06] lord
[1:32:07] or she keeps still oh you don't go by
[1:32:10] feelings you don't go by intellect we
[1:32:13] are not being led
[1:32:14] oh by your human mind this morning our
[1:32:17] mind is broke up
[1:32:18] there's nothing that we can rely on
[1:32:20] nothing that we can hold on to
[1:32:22] but all our hope is in jesus this
[1:32:25] morning
[1:32:26] all of our hope all of our faith is in
[1:32:29] his word
[1:32:30] and where he leads me i will follow
[1:32:34] where he leads me i will go
[1:32:37] oh he's calling this morning oh he's
[1:32:40] calling you this morning
[1:32:42] you mightn't think much of yourself but
[1:32:44] he's still calling you this morning
[1:32:46] because he put something inside your
[1:32:48] soul to stand the test of time
[1:32:51] and though the winds flow contrary yet
[1:32:54] in my flesh
[1:32:56] i shall see god i don't care what the

[1:33:40] won't pay no attention to nothing but
[1:33:43] what the lord says
[1:33:45] what what regardless of what what the
[1:33:47] pastor says the church or whatever
[1:33:49] he stands for god and for righteousness
[1:33:53] and his word that's the man we need
