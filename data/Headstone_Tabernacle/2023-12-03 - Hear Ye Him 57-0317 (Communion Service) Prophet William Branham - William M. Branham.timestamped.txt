[11:04] this evening we have a a tape you may be
[11:07] seated here you him from God's servant
[11:11] brother William BR God bless
[11:18] you what
[11:24] happened I just
[11:27] wondered a long time ago it was not
[11:29] wrong for a woman to put on a garment
[11:31] that pertains to a
[11:34] man G the Bible said it's an abomination
[11:38] in the sight of God hallu you Methodist
[11:42] I want to fire one at you when John
[11:44] Smith preached his last sermon a short
[11:47] one 4 hours so old he packed him to the
[11:51] platform and he said oh I don't know
[11:55] what's going to happen even the
[11:57] daughters of the Methodist Church are
[11:59] wearing rings on their fingers what
[12:01] about now with a bathing suit on
[12:02] stretched out on a beach before a bunch
[12:04] of man that's you
[12:07] Methodist all right you Baptist a little
[12:11] prayer one time now and then and John
[12:14] Smith the founder of the Baptist Church
[12:18] prayed until his eyes would swell shut
[12:23] and his wife would have to lead him to
[12:24] the table of the morning to feed him his
[12:27] breakfast shame when you
[12:30] Baptist and you methodists that don't
[12:32] believe in Divine
[12:34] Healing when John Smith I stood to this
[12:36] Shrine not unle one day he was riding
[12:39] his horse and it fell and broke its leg
[12:43] and he got off the horse and he took a
[12:44] bottle of oil from his pocket and
[12:46] Anointed The
[12:48] Horse and rode away on
[12:52] it you preach that in the Methodist
[12:55] Church and they'll throw you out the
[12:57] door oh you did run well what hindered
[13:03] you standing out Longo to a great
[13:06] Presbyterian man who was sitting by my
[13:08] side in some cult in
[13:11] California he said what do you think of
[13:13] that he didn't know me I said that's all
[13:15] right he said you know one time the
[13:17] Presbyterian Church was a Dominic Church
[13:19] on the west
[13:21] coast he said but then income the
[13:24] Christian Science and just tore it to
[13:26] pieces and now here come this man is
[13:29] tearing the Christian Science to
[13:31] pieces I I said then if you would have
[13:35] given the children the bread of life
[13:39] they wouldn't know when after such stuff
[13:42] as
[13:43] that but hungry children will eat from a
[13:46] garbage
[13:48] can the world's hungry today for the
[13:52] word of the Living God oh you people
[13:57] what you need you pastors is feed your
[14:00] sheep right with the word of the Living
[14:05] God then he kept bringing word oh how
[14:08] your children does this how he must feel
[14:12] imagine you being a teacher and have to
[14:14] go to the very M maker and report on his
[14:17] own child the discipline but now what if
[14:22] the child was a good job what if the
[14:25] child was just about the father's
[14:27] business that how gracious the tutor was
[14:31] he'd come and say oh kind
[14:33] sir your child is just a chip off the
[14:38] old
[14:39] block he's just like you he's just about
[14:44] your business oh you'll never find a
[14:47] better businessman for your kingdom here
[14:50] than that child how the father must
[14:53] sweat out oh that's my
[14:55] boy oh yes he's my son how that the holy
[15:00] spirit standing in the presence of God
[15:03] and says this man he is a real son he's
[15:08] about your business how do we say we
[15:11] about his business this is his program
[15:13] preach the
[15:16] word I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man
[15:19] to me how that he must feel great and
[15:23] feel happy then you know what happened
[15:26] if that son never did be behave itself
[15:30] it never was no more than just an
[15:32] outcast boy that's right I you know I'm
[15:36] a still a little bit of calvinist but I
[15:39] I believe if you're born a child of God
[15:42] you could be a disobedient child and you
[15:44] will Rel lose all your reward and you'll
[15:47] never be no more than just an ordinary
[15:49] Baptist Pentecostal Nazarene or whatever
[15:52] you
[15:52] are but if you be up and
[15:56] doing if you be all
[15:59] obedient and a real
[16:01] child now the Lutheran when you first
[16:05] found out the just shall live by faith
[16:07] you made a Doctrine out of it that's
[16:09] right and you Methodist as soon as John
[16:13] Wesley come along the pillar fire as it
[16:15] moved they built under him and when John
[16:18] Wesley come along you discovered the new
[16:20] birth or what they call sanctification
[16:23] the second definite work of Grace that
[16:24] was all right so was justification right
[16:27] but as soon as you not sanctification
[16:29] you draw a little line all your leaders
[16:32] did after the death of Wesley and as
[16:35] very and so forth and then you made a
[16:38] Doctrine out of it and you draw a border
[16:41] line God just moved the pillar fire
[16:43] right out the Pentecostal founding the
[16:46] restoration of the gifts they begin to
[16:48] speak in tongues you made a Doctrine out
[16:50] of it and you put your period down now
[16:53] the holy spirit's moving right on off
[16:54] and leaving you that's right oh brother
[16:57] when you isolate at yourself from the
[16:59] rest of the Believers God will move
[17:02] away you've got to love one another this
[17:07] will all men know that you are my
[17:09] disciples when you had love one for the
[17:12] other when the Methodist and the Baptist
[17:15] and the Lutheran and the Pentecostal can
[17:18] stand arm in arm and March forward
[17:20] you'll see one of the mest outpourings
[17:23] of the spirit of God that you ever seen
[17:26] the devil don't care as long as we're
[17:28] shooting at one another oh go ahead you
[17:30] just fight kill yourselves but let us
[17:32] unite in one big front watch what
[17:35] happens then watch what goes on now if
[17:39] this boy was a correct boy and he was
[17:42] obedient and he was industrious and he
[17:44] he liked to do the things the father had
[17:46] left for him to do then the tutor come
[17:48] and said oh he's a great boy then on a
[17:51] certain day when the boy become of age
[17:53] which the church ought to been a long
[17:56] time ago this boy was was brought out
[17:59] into a public place and had a road
[18:02] placed on him a beautiful Road and all
[18:06] the round about was called in now listen
[18:09] Clos and closing and all the people was
[18:12] gathered in at the front of the gate
[18:15] usually taken place he went up to the
[18:18] front of the Gate of the city and there
[18:20] he set his boy up on a high place and he
[18:23] put him on a robe and you preachers here
[18:26] I'm talking of the placing of a son you
[18:28] know
[18:28] in the Bible now in Galatians or
[18:32] Ephesians 1:5 for God has predestinated
[18:36] us unto the adoption or the placing of
[18:39] sons by Jesus Christ now he was a son to
[18:44] begin with but now he's so obedient let
[18:48] him be whatever denomination that has
[18:49] nothing to do with it it's obedience to
[18:52] the word obedience to God and then he
[18:56] was placed on this High seat and there
[18:58] was a great celebration and the father
[19:02] adopted his own son that had been in his
[19:05] family all these years had adopted him
[19:08] into his family in other words he had
[19:11] placed him give him his
[19:15] position in the family and then after
[19:19] that the boy's name was just as good on
[19:21] a check as his daddy's was or he was
[19:25] positionally placed now my Pentecostal
[19:28] brethen Baptist Methodist and
[19:30] Presbyterian whatever you are do you see
[19:33] where we're sharp
[19:35] today do you see we are fussing so much
[19:38] about our denomination about our
[19:40] Prestige and about our societies God
[19:43] can't do nothing with us we're children
[19:46] but oh made the day
[19:50] hasten when we can be set out before the
[19:54] public and roed in the power
[19:59] of his righteousness that our words our
[20:02] prayers will heal the sick and our
[20:05] preaching will save the lost and the
[20:07] great signs and wonders of the Bible
[20:09] will be restored back to the church
[20:12] again when we break down our little
[20:15] petty juvenile differences that's when
[20:18] God will do this notice he was
[20:21] positionally placed and then he become a
[20:25] full-fledged son then he name is good
[20:29] then that's the way with the church if
[20:31] we could get away from our little
[20:33] differences and come to Christ and
[20:35] forget about the outside world or forget
[20:38] about our denominations and so forth and
[20:40] be obedient children and be about the
[20:43] father's business to get Soul saved and
[20:46] to do the things of God after a while
[20:49] God will set us to one side and he'll
[20:52] anoint us with the Holy Ghost and then
[20:56] we're positionally placed in his Kingdom
[20:59] some has the gifts of wisdom some has
[21:02] knowledge some has Gifts of tongues some
[21:05] preaches the gospel some are prophets
[21:08] and other gifts but now God is moving
[21:11] the gifts in the
[21:13] church I might as well say it it's on my
[21:16] heart see I don't want to hurt you
[21:19] brother I don't want to hurt you sister
[21:22] but the Pentecostal church and you Full
[21:24] Gospel people these gifts you don't know
[21:27] how to control them
[21:29] there gifts are all right but you're
[21:31] going wild with them put them in their
[21:33] place look the first gift is wisdom what
[21:36] good it go to do you to have knowledge
[21:38] if you don't know have wisdom to know
[21:40] how to control your
[21:42] knowledge what good does it do you to
[21:44] speak with tongues if you don't have
[21:45] wisdom to know when how and to place it
[21:49] right see what I mean what good does it
[21:52] do to preach Divine Healing when it just
[21:54] goes to pieces you don't know what I've
[21:56] said I met two classes of people people
[21:58] in my life and that is the fundamental
[22:00] and the Pentecostal the fundamental
[22:03] positionally knows what they are but
[22:06] they haven't got any faith the word's
[22:08] never took root yet it's never come to
[22:10] life but positionally they know where
[22:13] they are the Pentecostals got the faith
[22:16] but they don't know who they are it's
[22:18] just like a man's got money in a bank
[22:20] don't know how to write a check in the
[22:21] other can ride a check and ain't got no
[22:23] money to B if you could ever get those
[22:26] together
[22:28] oh God give us either a spiritual
[22:32] fundamental church or a fundamental
[22:35] Pentecostal
[22:37] Church youve got lots of faith but you
[22:40] just don't know how to place it it just
[22:41] runs wide that way it brings me a
[22:44] reproach and it does good place it in
[22:47] the Bible this is the blueprint not what
[22:50] people want but what God
[22:53] wants line up with this program that's
[22:57] what's the difference
[22:58] that's why we are not going on the way
[23:00] we should be friends
[23:03] now while they were standing there
[23:06] noticed that when in the presence of God
[23:10] now in the Old Testament God never did
[23:14] ask man to do anything L he' do it
[23:18] himself when man was sentenced to death
[23:20] to Die the only way God could redeem him
[23:23] is come down in flesh and take his place
[23:27] that's the reason I preached the way I
[23:28] did last night Christ is more than a man
[23:31] he's God he had to come down and be
[23:34] clothed in flesh in order of tast in he
[23:37] couldn't send another individual he
[23:39] wouldn't be just in doing so he had to
[23:41] come himself and he overshadowed the
[23:43] Virgin and created a blood sell it
[23:46] brought forth the Sun and God dwelt in
[23:49] the sun Tabernacle here on Earth he was
[23:52] Emmanuel not a
[23:55] prophet but God with with
[24:00] us God was in Christ reconciling the
[24:03] world to himself it's the only way he
[24:06] could test taste sin and death was to be
[24:09] made Marty like man the kinsman redeemer
[24:12] of Ruth that of preached on so much
[24:14] Across the Nation as you probably read
[24:17] the sermons oh he had to be a Kinsman to
[24:21] be a redeemer and the only way that God
[24:24] could ever be a redeemer he had become
[24:27] kful to us and he become flesh and
[24:30] dwells Among Us he's our kin folks he
[24:34] was a flesh man like I am like you are
[24:37] but God dwelt in him to suffer and feel
[24:39] taste his and five senses like we are he
[24:43] become a
[24:44] redeemer then when he was standing there
[24:46] on Mount Transfiguration God was showing
[24:49] to the world what he had asked man to do
[24:52] back there under the adoption replacing
[24:54] of sons Peter got all excited usually
[24:58] men do when they're in the presence of
[25:01] Supernatural usually they can control
[25:04] themselves because they're creatures of
[25:06] the earth and yet they're creatures of
[25:08] Heaven too but that foraste just runs
[25:10] them wild that's what's happened to the
[25:12] Pentecostal Church see that forast you
[25:15] don't know how to control yourself you
[25:17] get all out of
[25:18] reason you don't know how to place those
[25:20] gifts of tongues those interpretations
[25:23] while a preacher speaking sometimes you
[25:24] raise your and speak while a preacher is
[25:26] speaking that's contrary to the
[25:29] Bible and you say oh God gave a message
[25:31] of this it's fresher than the Bible no
[25:33] it's
[25:34] not that your words will fail and
[25:37] everything else will fail but the Bible
[25:40] said if there be any spiritual or
[25:42] Prophet among you let him acknowledge
[25:43] what I write is the Commandments of God
[25:46] and if an angel from heaven would preach
[25:48] any other gospel in that which has been
[25:50] preached let him be a
[25:52] cursed you see what I mean so if you try
[25:55] to shake hands with pre people and get
[25:57] them into into the kingdom of God you're
[25:58] wrong they're borned in the kingdom of
[26:01] God by the Holy Ghost they're not
[26:03] baptized Face Forward backward sprinkled
[26:05] poured in one name or the other they are
[26:08] BN out the spirit of God into the
[26:11] kingdom of God Peter was excited he said
[26:14] Lord let's build three
[26:17] Tabernacles we'll build one for Moses
[26:20] and all wants to keep the law Moses
[26:22] represented the law all that wants to
[26:24] keep the law the Commandments and don't
[26:26] eat meat and so forth let them do that
[26:30] and we'll be one for Elijah and we'll be
[26:32] one for you now Moses represented the
[26:35] law all the
[26:38] laws and no man can be saved by the law
[26:43] the law was a savior the law was a
[26:46] school Master the law was a punishment
[26:51] the law magnified sin and otherwise the
[26:55] law was a jail house that the spirit put
[26:59] you in the jail
[27:00] housee but it couldn't redeem it had
[27:03] nothing in it to redeem
[27:05] by Jesus was a
[27:08] redeemer now Moses represent the law by
[27:11] the law no flesh is saved that's reason
[27:13] he brought the three Witnesses from
[27:14] heaven now Elijah represented the
[27:18] justice of
[27:20] God and my brother would you dare to say
[27:24] that you require Justice from God when
[27:27] you're borned in sin shaped in iniquity
[27:32] come to the world speaking
[27:34] lies and you want
[27:37] Justice God said the day you eat thereof
[27:40] that day you die that settles you got
[27:42] Justice You're
[27:44] Gone in law law only brings it before
[27:48] you said here you're under
[27:50] arrest you
[27:53] sinned you
[27:56] transgressed and your your prison is
[27:58] open for you hell itself go into it
[28:02] that's what the law said and the Justice
[28:06] didn't even require a
[28:08] law the word had already been
[28:12] spoken that's all God has to keep his
[28:15] word look at Elijah God's he was God's
[28:20] line of Justice he's setting up on a
[28:23] hill he said if I be a man of God when
[28:25] that captain of 50 comes to let come
[28:27] from Heaven went away went to 50 well
[28:31] the king said perhaps lightning struck
[28:33] them I don't believe in the days of
[28:35] Miracle so maybe it was lightning or
[28:37] something struck them it was just
[28:39] accidental I'll send another 50 that
[28:42] Stern old prophet of Justice stood up
[28:45] there and said if I be a man of God let
[28:49] Fire come from heaven and down come to
[28:52] Fire and consumed another
[28:54] 50 it wasn't an accident then
[28:58] why he was a line of God's
[29:01] justice dare any of you to try to stand
[29:04] the justice of God dare any of you to
[29:08] try to go to Heaven by the law look
[29:10] where we're standing Peter said let's
[29:13] build three
[29:15] Tabernacles look at the
[29:17] darkness we are doomed from the
[29:21] beginning God's justice requires
[29:23] recompense recompense requires a reward
[29:26] the reward is death
[29:29] La magnifies it and throws us under
[29:31] arrest and puts us in the prison what a
[29:35] dark picture for the human
[29:37] race but oh my dear poor decrepit friend
[29:42] turn your head this
[29:45] way there stood
[29:49] Jesus
[29:51] Jesus
[29:52] magnified like the sun back there under
[29:55] the Old Testament he was glorified
[29:59] potentially oh His Garment shine like
[30:02] the sun and a voice from Heaven said
[30:06] this is my beloved
[30:09] Son he ye him so all of our
[30:14] denominations all of our upsets all of
[30:17] our differences doesn't mean a
[30:21] thing Jesus represented God's
[30:25] love God's so loved the world he gave
[30:29] his only begotten son that whosoever
[30:31] believeth in him should never perish but
[30:34] have a eternal life so it doesn't lay in
[30:37] the Justice it doesn't lay in the law or
[30:41] what you've done it's in the mercy and
[30:44] love of God that Christ came to the
[30:47] Earth and taken your place God himself
[30:50] said now look I'm going to declare this
[30:52] before Heaven no man can be saved with
[30:54] the law it's done I declare that on the
[30:56] earth no man can be saved saved by the
[30:57] law no man can be saved but justice but
[31:00] this is my beloved Son no man can be
[31:04] saved belonging to the Baptist Church no
[31:05] man can be saved belong to the Methodist
[31:07] Church no man can be saved belong to the

[31:15] dwell in hear ye him why hear ye him
[31:18] he's the only one can save he's the only
[31:21] one can give peace he's the only one can
[31:24] heal the law can't heal neither with the
[31:26] Justice required
[31:27] but the Son of God can save and heal and
[31:31] give peace for he was wounded for our
[31:34] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[31:37] the testment of our peace was upon him
[31:39] and with his stripes we were healed here

[31:47] but hear ye him if you're a Pentecostal

[38:19] which also I delivered unto you that the

[38:56] do show the Lord's death till he
[38:59] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[39:02] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[39:05] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[39:08] and blood of the
[39:10] Lord but let a man examine himself and
