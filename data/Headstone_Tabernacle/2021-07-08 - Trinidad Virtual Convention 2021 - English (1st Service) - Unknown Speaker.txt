TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] on behalf of the headstone tabernacle in trinidad and tobago we'd like to welcome you to our virtual convention 2021 the dispensation of another ephesians this year we are going to experience four powerful days with ministers creators singers and worshippers from all around the world we stand on the expectation to have a glorious time in the lord may god richly bless you as you worship with us [Music] [Music] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself but we're promised according to revelations 10 and according to malachi 4 and saint luke 22 17 and so forth that there is got to come on ephesians to this there is promise to friends there must come an ephesians that these seven full mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded and it's in the ladies and age that this takes place believe that we're we're there i believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the son of god [Music] and at joshua just before uh the ephesians uh raised up so did john the baptist raise up just before the next ephesians and we're promised a another another uh ephesians is predicted here in the scripture therefore i think that we are living in the ephesians again back again to we are promised that what was left off doing over seven ages now you cannot add nothing to the book or take nothing from it revelations 22 18 says so whoever will add one word or take one word this part will be taken from the book of life now we cannot add or take so therefore we know that luther could not get to it west end and so forth the reformers knocked penny calvin on down so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the gospel truth but now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because is there a common ephesian age to it [Music] god bless you saints and believers around the world i want to read a scripture from first samuel chapter 3 verse 1 and it reads and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and but abraham talk about what a vision is then it's the direct word of the lord and we believe we have the direct word of the lord from our 20th century prophet that identify this big drama of the church coming to this dispensation of ephesians i want to share something with you he says so luta preached justification he let it run awhile because he didn't live long enough they organized the church luther never organized it after luther when the resurrection fought an afflue wesley they got the wesleyan church and after that come john smith the baptist alexander campbell and so forth but the men the reformers didn't live long enough to get it all together so you could see clearly there was something to get together because it was lost so this is what he said though so a lot of loose ends left like when they did it for instance the world of baptism that john smith brought back an immersion but using titles many of those things was left loose but then when we come to the end here we go the last message is supposed to straighten that all up to bring these things to one fate one lord one baptism see so what he is saying everything supposed to straighten it up to bring it to one lord one fate one baptism what is it another ephesians and he was speaking about a disability line and not knowing nothing about you not even knowing that's a strange man that come here it will absolutely be a paradox something done something you ought not to have done or something you should have done it would have to be a paradox because there's no way anybody to know that outside of the revelation of the unseen that's right and he will do that for you between you and i so that the audience not a show but they might see the ephesus is here and that this is the thing that bridges between denomination and glory land so this is what he says here not for sure but to see that the ephesus is here and this is the thing that bridges between the nomination and glory land he promised it so ephesians is the bridge that bridges between denomination and glory land so here we are at we see nations breaking israel awakening the signs that this bible foretold for this day we see the mechanical things taking place now the spirit here we go the dynamics of that promised word to get into his church and drive them to calvary yonder unto the rapture so it's not we going from word to the rapture know the spirit the dynamics of what what was promised the promised word to get into the church and drive them with the cavalry under and there we are the promised word is what another ephesians so this morning today it's a privilege and blessing for me uh to introduce and to have all these ministers both greeting and print ministers preaching the word and if you notice they're not pointing to themselves or to the group or ministry they're pointing the people to the promised land the kingdom the inheritance another ephesians by way of calvary and jordan and debt itself so before we begin we'd like to introduce you with [Music] greetings the lord richie bless you i greet you in the lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ both your local and international audience this is pastor albert green from bethlehem tabernacle trinidad and tobago appreciating the invitation from our precious brother theo ovid uh to bring greetings to trinidad virtual convention the inspiration the dispensation of another ephesian a careful look at the quotation supporting the inspiration another another is described as one or more of the same another speaks are very similar to the quotation further carries us tells us of an ephesian again and again is described as another time or once more it is therefore important of us to look at the ephesians the very ephesians that give rise to the inspiration that strike our precious minister and servant that quotation of an inspiration again that quotation of another ephesian it beholds us to look at that ephesians that gives rise to the thought this morning or wherever you are what hour of the day it is the ephesians were a solid gospel church the ephesians were at church in order the ephesians were not babies they were grown-ups the ephesian church was a church that was just 12 in number yet there is no greater record to surpass the ephesian church that is spoken of in the bible it beholds us to conclude how much was done with 12 completely surrendered what could be done today with us this is the group the apostle paul in his address a group that had certain characteristics a group that the apostle paul had no trouble with a group that never had to be put in order it beholds us to look and see are we that group god's prophet asked a question or draws in the question and answers on the seals to something that we need to take note of it tells us here we ought to live above the sort here and all this age now we are back into something now that god's revealing the hidden mysteries that has been put on the book before the foundation of the world and those who have obeyed in these small things amen will catch in these other things and if they haven't it will go over the top of your head as far as the east is from the west that are with that group amen are we that group why are we still fighting with the common things are we still having a fight with the carnal things you know it beholds us to get a glimpse this morning what is this message all about you know is the message just baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ but that's acts 238 that's written right in the script here as god's prophet tells us you don't need a revelation amen on water baptism it's right there steering you in the face so you know is this message just a mod of dress amen is it just that is it wearing garments put not wearing garments putting into a man or a woman do we need a revelation for those things those things are staring us in the face so this ephesian group since this is a group by the grace of the lord amen this is the group by the grace of the lord it's not like cain you see because cain had a knowledge of all these scriptures he had on our knowledge from the lord about what is the right thing to do and still he couldn't do it so we gotta look and and search ourselves to see if we are really that ephesian group the group for which amen the closed book has become an open book so we see here amen the apostle paul in speaking to that division as we look for another ephesians in speaking to that ephesians those things that are called saints that are preserved sins that are set aside here the speaking was not to unbelievers for we know of the truth the the words of this message cannot be quickened in an unbeliever's heart so we gotta understand when we're looking for another ephesian amen courts we can call them all they are not for professors but they are for possessors they are not for babies but they are for those who are meant to eat meat look at the message paradox paragraph 67 and god's prophet is showing us here from the inspiration there has got to be and ephesians also of this journey there's got to be an ephesians also of this journey just as there was of other journeys there has to come an ephesians an ephesians ephesus and ephesians of this journey we want to trust god this morning today wherever we are as we look at another ephesian as we look at an ephesian again as we look at these thoughts that are dedicated to the believer here it was these are people were told who they were before the foundation of the world this is the people was told what god did for them before the foundation of the world this was the people that paul spoke the great things too paul spoke to them the great mysteries of predestination of eternal security of unconditional covenant how god saw you in glory before the foundation of the world this is what is set aside for the overcoming ones so this morning as you look today whatever we are in the time zone the inspiration another efficient the inspiration and ephesians again because prophet tells us it is great when people can be taught the deeper things it is great when people can be taught the deeper things amen it is great it is great those of us who are looking for another efficient when people can be taught the real thing it is great when we can be taught the real thing it is great when the holy ghost can anchor great things in your heart as we come to a close we are stolen paradox paragraph 89 we are promised according to revelation 10 and paul into malachi 4 and so forth there's got to come an ephesians to this it's a promise there must come an ephesians that is sevenfold mysteries of god must be folded unfolded another ephesians friends and ephesians again amen it is for special people that god will share these truths too now remember as we close not another corinthians it's not another corinthians it is another ephesians and if another is used to refer to an additional person the same type the one already mentioned so it's not another corinthians corinthians as we know had to be spoken to us children corinthians cannot take orders the corinthians cannot be kept straight the corinthians were babies they had to be treated as babies they couldn't take the solid word remember another ephesians god bless you god bless the minister and servant so when you speak i was inspired to bring the word to the people ordained to be another ephesians again god bless your services amen [Music] so [Music]

thank you for it and may you guide these three words now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you may be seated and we are very happy to be connected with you in this international virtual convention hosted by us our precious brother theovid and his team brother theo we thank you so much for doing this for the bride of christ and may god bless you and your wife and family and the church and all the workers with you we love you we are all friends and we will always be friends in all eternity god bless you your inspiration was set the dispensation of another ephesians and as i said in my prayer may it become your personal dispensation in your life just to make a little background for the theme the dispensation of another ephesian we have to realize said when a church age ended a church dispensation like in the in the time of the law of moses and there was a change in the dispensation and we are again in another change of a dispensation and it is god's way to announce this change and he said he's sending a prophet he's doing nothing without sending a prophet and declare it to his people and he was sending a prophet in that time in the old time and the law changed to the new dispensation of jesus christ and this prophet john the baptist he introduced this new dispensation i call it the kingdom of god on earth and he said the kingdom of god is near it's coming near repent is the only way to to come before god with your heart open it and repent and if you don't have this i give you a clue how you can have it if you ask your heavenly father to give it to you an experience of dying at calorie this is the greatest experience that you can ever make because this finish your own life your own thoughts your imagination your own program see sometimes we we try to handle the promises with our own program the pharisees at that time say try to live the word but they had their program how to do it and when the whale of the temple rendon twain when jesus died at the cross then something new started a few days later he rose appeared to his disciples he went to heaven and he sent down the holy ghost on pentecost and then there it happened it started a new dispensation opened when the holy ghost came down and we call this new dispensation in ephesian ephesian the book of ephesians the letter to ephesians is not so much a letter to a local church as other letters in the new testament but this book that shows this dispensation that shows that dimension where jesus lives where we enter when we are dead to ourselves as we heard in the message from brother rename we cannot be born again without being dead before and so we have to have a personal experience of dying and it's very important and god gives it to us if we want that because it's his will and if we pray according to his will we have faith that he will give it to us so it's called an ephesian it's called the dispensation of the fullness of time it's written in ephesians chapter 1 verse 10 speaking about the dispensation of the fullness of time open for the newborn church and it actually was a love of god coming down in the hearts of the people god's own love where we were before the foundation of the world where i was maybe you can say it also in your heart you know it in your heart said you was there in his love then it makes it easy to receive it again that was blacked out through sin and through our birth and so we we actually killed the lamb we strangled it islam like nature and with our uh sexual born life when we when we came to this world speaking lies growing up and and uh it is actually the love of god coming down burning in its fullness and this this was holding about 25 years and it was holding in this ephesian church there was maybe only 12 12 brothers or what a small church but it was it was holding and then and then things crept in and paul writings with him because in revelation is told as the revelation of jesus christ says he have lost the first love and we are in a time now where we find back said first love i prophesy we will fall so in love with jesus said he can do us whatever he wants to do so this is because we are coming to this where ephesians started the fullness of his love his fullness of my savior's love the fullness of god's own love coming coming into a human being when he's going through the process at calvary that's the only way to receive it we cannot get it by our intellect we cannot get it by imagination it's not possible we cannot catch it but if we ask him in the name of jesus his son he will surely come and give it to us hallelujah so these believers realize their position in christ jesus it was direct and personal revelation the fountain of love say came from above before this world began this love became present tense there is no sin in that love no accusation no nothing no no shadow in it and this love is able to handle all things to forgive all things we are not able in our human life to handle all things when opposition comes we try to argue as humans and we fail but here in this ephesian time in this new ephesian time when when the love of god is abiding and brother brahm said it's since 33 years he is in heavenly places and never came out it was abiding he made mistakes we are making mistakes but it was in the foundation abiding this is love and this love is able to handle all things it is such a blessing to be delivered from myself if i'm delivered for myself it's such a blessing if you are delivered from yourself and people don't know what to do they know it's a problem they have a problem but ask your heavenly father to give it to you and he will give it to you because you are in the will of god and the assurance comes upon you he gives it to me and you can testify to others what happened to you and how everything changed in your personal contact to the lord jesus many times we try to handle the promises as i said according to our program we fail we have to fit in god's program and only the word the holy spirit by the word knows it what his program is we have to find out where god's word belongs in our life the prophet said we are we full gospel people he called himself he said we full gospel people we believe the promises but it's not enough it's not enough love is even greater than faith yeah no the bible says the greatest is is love so we have to come into that realm into that kingdom in this in they said abiding place of glory we have to stay there day and night and god will give it to us and we will find where god's word belongs in our life not only to know the promise and thank you and i believe it my theme is and i must finish but i want to say this as a theme song in my life is goodness and mercy will follow me all of my life as a theme song and but if this psalm only would stay in my knowledge i know it's written in the bible and will follow all of my life no i have an experience with it i i connect it to my life so we have to connect the promises to our life and we can only do it when we die at calvary and have an experience of dying so it's a new land and we will hear maybe much from all the other ministers and i am expecting to to enter into their messages and be with them when they speak and it's a new land it's another ephesian you live in that promised land and and i call it the love of god and i let me finish with this jesus prayed in john 17 26 father i declared unto them thy name and will declare do you feel something then you know when you have an experience with the name of jesus when you say jesus in your heart something happens jesus said i declared your name and will declare why that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and i in them this was the beginning of ephesians and it changed their lives god bless you [Applause] amen and amen hallelujah glory to god hallelujah amen you appreciate that this morning amelia appreciate those great things hallelujah thank you so

convention god bless your house brothers the privilege to be joining arms with you and we give god praise to be at this time amen when we can speak of the original bride thank you for every effort that has gone forth [Music] you've got to have it before you can give it hallelujah and i understand the original ephesian church was just a few people i'm not mistaken about 16. it says so but they were so powerful amen and we we give god glory to aspire to be like them and therefore the title the original bride we have been speaking just last sunday about israel and how very soon we shall go back to that original tree and we see uh we see the nations are breaking and uh we see israel's awakening uh the the the things we have seen online [Music] the taking [Music] and jesus to make himself known and to seal the 144 000. there you are bring back the original tree [Music] evidently something [Music] had left their mind it's called amnesia he says they have forgotten something be careful you don't forget something who you are that the rapture won't be long don't forget something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin and that's what i'm saying to you today go back to your point of origin god has predestinated you to be blameless before him in love where did you start don't leave that first love amen the origin of the first age was pentecost now they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and the wonder of it now it was time to go back in mind amen for me to live it's not success for me to live it's not just to to do things and to to to make money but for me to live is christ hallelujah for me to live the blessed be the name of the lord and i i i understand he said in gabriel's instructions that he will send elijah before that day comes at the end turn them back to the original that's what it's about amen that's why he came to turn you back to get your focus on what the original was this one [Music] [Music] to return to the place where i first received you oh lord take me back to the heart of worship when my worship comes from my heart and not just a church form amen yeah and look it might not we we've said malachi 4. the elijah but yeah it might not just be one person but it will be a message the church the holy spirit in the church to swing that faith back to the original faith back to the rock [Music] but we want to swing back that faith to the original faith that's my burden that's our burden and may god bless us as we keep that vision to get back to the original bride amen that's right he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen amen i thank god for our prophet malachi for because as we heard earlier all that was in christ amen that message will be a message of grace hallelujah amen that's what the prophet preached message of grace amen why he said because they started out with grace to begin with before they had law they had grace while they were in egypt without law no one down there but they didn't have any laws but god provided a prophet hallelujah and also grace provided an atonement the sacrificial lamb amen the atonement had been provided before there was any law are you ready grace was before lord during law and after law so friends you are saved by grace that is the original before there was any laws before there was keeping of anything you were originally saved by grace before law during law and after law and we have a message of grace who can say amen to that one hallelujah amen so those things are are what we have there will come a messenger in the last days follow closely will guide the people back to the first fruit back to the original faith granted the great christ the great christ the holy spirit made vivid made [Music] back to the pentecostal faith the face of that day it will take the guide to lead you even though you think and we think that we know the wilderness that you need a guide you have to have a guide and the great messenger among us now hey man the prophet went but the angel stayed behind to fix everything for the coming of the lord the great christ the holy spirit made vivid made understanding may he guide us that is our prayer today may god guide us the great messenger who is amongst us now can we say hallelujah amen greater than solomon is here so let's track the progress of the church now when the bride started my title the original bride there was a little stalk it's not the original grain it's just a stalk amen [Music] calvin none of them that was not the original they were still a message but uh what it was they didn't get the complete revelation of it he the [Music] but [Music] the original seed hallelujah amen glory to god we bless the name of the lord amen finally that comes back the original seed praise be to god what can we say to these things he said i will restore saith the lord no matter what the enemy does no matter what insects have eaten down the tree god said i will restore i will bring see the masterpiece is brought she was and she was perfectly perfect the second time she was like the first she was the first time oh god have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the grain thank god for the revelation of the original grain and let me be bold that is the original bride praise be the god the alpha is the omega that is our god amen it goes the same with the orange tree the orange seed goes in the ground and then he says you see that around today they will grasp a and grapefruit [Music] amen but it isn't original fruit because it is an orange tree amen turn to somebody say god bless you brother orange god bless you sister orange the original bride tell them god bless you original bride hey man brother orange sister orange god bless you but all the rest isn't the original fruit but when that tree puts forth a branch it will [Music] there [Music] amen it is the same it's the spirit of love that we need the spirit of love we need a love spirit to be in this church too much fighting too much gossip too much hatred too much revenge you have to have a spirit of love amen from the very beginning you were in love amen and you were blameless you take a spirit of love the great fountain of god from that came perverted love through the message of the serpent then it came to human love then it came to sexual love then it came to other loves and loves it keeps on perverting it just becomes faith and all those things had a beginning that's what we're preaching amen he says but all those things had a beginning but we want to be an original bride we need original love amen and someday it will wind straight back to the original it's eternal human love and passionate love and all those loves have to cease amen all these make believe of faith will have to cease there is one true faith all others will like to cease they were perverts off of this real fountain we have to get back to original love real love between the brethren between each other [Music] it didn't need hands later on it was in the shekinah glory and it came forth and your family will come forth hallelujah i mean look at this you say original love yes amen he says in the beginning those who had brotherly love one for another they would lay down their lives for one another the for me [Music] who love one another so much and more amen such divine love till they will even go to penitentiary jail i will go to prison for your for his friends that is the original church we need to change we need to change that where you are willing to lay down your life i mean the original seeds the original life the original bride the original word that is our message we are going back there to god be glory amen and when we go back there to the original you you see what makes a healthy plant [Music] [Music] let's preach don't have to be sprayed [Music] when i was a child i spoke as a child but when i become a man i put away childish things you get back to the original hallelujah amen the original bride smaller but stronger smaller but more resistant it's smaller but it's original it's powerful praise be the god that he says he's the original and the you've had your jab of love before the foundation of the world you're not afraid now you will never be deceived the elect cannot be deceived they've had a jab of love praise god hallelujah amen men are man till now much more has he promised he says he says how much more is leaving it in the bible to this very age that we're living of the church ages [Music] something modern modern message we need to get back to the original message of love amen hallelujah he says he says there'll be another ephesians and we're here amen you will understand when you are in the composer's spirit let me sing a new finish [Music] holy belief all things are amen i love him praise the lord and the bride the original bride is in the spirit of the composer we know where we're going hallelujah we shall never be a denomination that is the unveiling amen that is when things get unveiled when the composer's spirit is in the bride of jesus christ and the bride knows where is going because she has the composer's spirit hallelujah let's go a bit deeper as joshua just before the ephesians raised up john the baptist raised up before the next episode and we are promised another ephesian another ephesian the original faith it's got to be here it's predicted in the scripture we are living in the ephesians we are promised that what was left off message [Music] those divine mysteries are reserved for the end time we understand those things [Music] ephesians because we only have seven church ages we're not preaching eight church ages so we have to see it cannot be counted eight days you can't do it it cannot be counted because there's only seven days in the week count it anywhere you want to but [Music] [Music] we can't musicians where are you raise your hand musicians where you're sitting you tell me can i say a b c [Music] d e after two high f i've got to go back to the beginning i can sing a b c d e f g but then i i can't continue with i e a j h i can't do it i must go back to hey i must go back to the original if i don't then i'll be inventing new music i have to go back to me first amen this is the law of jubilee you have to go back to the beginning hallelujah after 50 years the year of jubilee came after the year of jubilee everything went back to his original beginning again all the slaves they went back to the original again in the jubilee [Music] what a great feeling i'm here now but i'm free like i was 50 years ago now brought free praise be to god we don't travel back in time we are here now but we are free amen what can we say to these things amen god is with us amen all the slaves they went back to the original beginning they just stopped [Music] what do we say to these things even if a man was homing in the field and the trumpet sounded he would throw down the hole he would say in 2021 [Music] on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all because the original it automatically automatically exposes the impersonator just like isaac automatically when you are the original you will expose everything because you are the original if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off that's all he got off the ground why who can [Music] amen you can't add to the bible as it was years ago [Music] [Music] god cannot make a decision today and make a better decision because his first decision is perfect his original decision is perfect you just have to go back there [Music] he says jesus he took the original five loaves and the two fishes he began to break them from the original he made bread is that correct and it fed 5 000 people is that right he said i got a fish give me a fish it was a fish to begin with and he took from that fish another fish and another fish and he fed 5 000. and it was there [Music] [Music] that is what we are preaching there was nothing i tell you even if it looks ridiculous speak the word it will come into existence hallelujah just say the word hey man let it be there he says oh his word is infallible it has to be fulfilled listen to this i could tell you things that would shake you [Music] and god drops the seed of this confession into the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and he replaces in that man the original [Music] he the creative power of god should be in the church amen you have nothing but you speak it that's the face we've got speaking conditions amen it breaks every wall of sin it breaks it down praise be to god now yes brother brad i'm talking amen in the message deep calls too deep if he can reveal what your [Music] and that spirit knows and i don't that's what the purpose is amen so so that's what it's about it says that that's what the reason is to show there was a spirit here there is a spirit here that knows you man that's what you need to catch there's a spirit here that knows you wouldn't be the man it would be the spirit and that's what god promised at the time of this ephesus a spirit will be here a spirit what about your life he says is it right with god it can only be made right by accepting that great preparation that god has made to bring human beings across the chasm the lord [Music] [Music] to get me across there and there's no bridge if you feel like that i've got some good news for you jesus christ himself is the bridge he is the bridge he is that spirit praise be to god nothing but the blood of jesus you watch that man what's he going to do he will fall you can't try you need a bridge you need a bridging spirit to take you across but jesus is the bridging spirit to take you and your family from a to b between you and the glory land is [Music] maybe your family needs savings jesus is the bridge he will take your family over and your children will receive the holy ghost the ephesus is here this is the bridge when he found out that there was coming one that would bring back perfection the word of god again that would would bridge the way jesus is the ephesians he [Music] he was a refugee and i tell you because of jesus i don't care how far it is jesus jesus can stretch [Music] glory to god he was that ephesians made manifest none other is this bridge but almighty god amen himself his word is him aren't you glad jesus laid down his life so that you're gonna walk across this bridge hallelujah we give god glory there's many expansions yeah that's british across bodies of water there is the big bridge of san francisco

could tell what was going to depend a harbour something bridge harbor sydney harbour bridge it says from north you know and south sydney they said it could never be done but an englishman said i know what to do the revelation was to get rid of the gravel once you get the gravel out the bridge whatever you do do it by revelation whatever step you take take it by revelation and if you go by revelation you will never be moved pray [Music] that god and man join together that men are still the sons and daughters of god it's in in man because jesus spanned the way he crossed over amen one day he [Music] he when jesus says come he will provide the bridge for you you can't see it but you're gonna make it by the grace of almighty god you are gonna make it we are gonna make it and our children are gonna make it by the grace of god why why because simon peter was doing what god told him to do and if you do what god tells you you will make it by the grace of god hallelujah there's
