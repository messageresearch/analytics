[16:16] are you happy to be in a house of the
[16:18] Lord tonight on this special Wednesday
[16:21] night service you know God is a God of
[16:26] suddenly you read the Bible it says
[16:28] suddenly he was there suddenly something
[16:31] happens and whenever a suddenly happens
[16:34] is God's Way of breaking the routine
[16:36] breaking the order of things and I
[16:39] believe that tonight is a break in the
[16:40] routine
[16:41] we're not normally here on a Wednesday
[16:43] night so the devil doesn't know what's
[16:45] going on he had no idea we were gonna be
[16:48] here tonight and we are gonna sing we're
[16:50] gonna show you the no worship so we're
[16:53] gonna keep the devil confused tonight
[16:55] we're gonna keep him confused because
[16:57] we're gonna smile
[16:59] we might be tired but we still gonna
[17:01] worship we might be weary but that's all
[17:03] right we know where we come from and we
[17:06] know where we're going
[17:07] can the church say Amen Oh blessed be
[17:10] the name of the Lord
[17:11] so I greet you tonight in the precious
[17:13] name of Jesus Christ and if you have
[17:14] your Bibles who'd attended me to but
[17:17] three portions of Scripture not going to
[17:21] be too long with you tonight but we want
[17:23] to read from the book of Genesis and the
[17:26] book of Revelation and brother Branham
[17:28] said that there are two books in the
[17:30] Bible and the devil hates which are the
[17:35] books of Genesis and the book of
[17:37] Revelation so we want to stay right
[17:41] where we give the devil problems because
[17:45] if we don't give him problems we create
[17:47] a room for him to give us problems so we
[17:50] have him on the ropes tonight and we
[17:51] want to keep him on the ropes tonight so
[17:54] Genesis chapter 6 and reading from verse
[17:58] five and God saw that the wickedness of
[18:02] man was great in the earth and that
[18:04] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[18:07] heart was only evil continually and it
[18:11] repented the Lord that he had made man
[18:13] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[18:15] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[18:17] man whom I have created from the face of
[18:21] the earth both man and beast and the
[18:23] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[18:25] for it repented
[18:26] me that I have made them but Noah found
[18:29] grace in the eyes of the Lord I'm
[18:32] reading Genesis 7 the next chapter
[18:35] reading from verse 1 and the Lord said
[18:38] unto Noah come thou and all thy house
[18:40] into the ark for thee have I seen
[18:43] righteous before me in this generation
[18:45] and going down to this the teen in the
[18:49] cell seemed a entered Noah and Shem and
[18:53] ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and
[18:55] Noah's wife and the three wives of his
[18:57] sons with them into the ark vien every
[18:59] beast after his kind and all the cattle
[19:01] after their kind and every creeping
[19:03] thing that creepeth upon the earth after
[19:05] his kind and every fowl after his kind
[19:08] every bird after every sort and they
[19:10] went in unto Noah into the ark two and
[19:12] two of all flesh wherein is the breath
[19:14] of life and he that went in went in male
[19:17] and female of all flesh as God had
[19:19] commanded him and the Lord shut him in
[19:22] an hour last reading from the book of
[19:23] Revelation chapter 3 and verse 8
[19:26] revelation 3 and verse 8 for I know thy
[19:30] works behold I have set before thee an
[19:32] open door and no man can shut it for
[19:36] thou hast a little strength and ice kept
[19:39] my word and has not denied my name can
[19:42] we bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[19:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[19:45] grace for your love tonight and law we

[19:49] hustle and the bustle of life and father

[20:39] over there and me you bring him back
[20:40] Lord safely and in strength to us father
[20:43] may you bless the services this coming
[20:45] Sunday and may you be with your people
[20:47] in the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[20:49] the church says amen you may be seated
[20:52] tonight so for a short title for this
[20:55] exhortation tonight the open door of
[20:58] deliverance the open door of deliverance
[21:02] and we read the scripture that God was
[21:05] looking at the urgent he realized that
[21:08] man had fallen from his position man had
[21:11] fallen out of order if God had a vision
[21:14] of what he wanted to see when he was
[21:16] looking at man it was it was not what he
[21:18] had wanted to see was not his desire and
[21:21] but the Brandon brought out that is not
[21:23] God desire that anyone would be lost see
[21:25] he doesn't look when somebody Falls and
[21:27] say it's good for you that's not his
[21:29] desire is not his attribute that you
[21:31] make mistakes is not his nature that he
[21:33] you wants you to be in trouble
[21:35] and as God looked he had seen that man
[21:37] was out of position husbands out of
[21:39] their position wives out of their
[21:42] position fathers out of their position
[21:44] mothers out of their position believers
[21:46] so to speak out of their position every
[21:50] imagination the Bible says was evil
[21:53] could you imagine every imagination
[21:56] every time their mind goes somewhere is
[21:59] evil every thought they had was evil the
[22:02] way their mind worked
[22:03] it just was evil the conclusions they
[22:06] came up with was evil the ideas they had
[22:09] was evil the dreams they had was evil he
[22:11] said every imagination it was not a
[22:14] minority it was not once in a while but
[22:17] when God looked at everything every
[22:19] imagination was evil
[22:22] but yet in the midst of all of that in
[22:25] the midst of that God for one man who
[22:29] found grace in the eyes of the Lord and
[22:31] his name was Noah and I could imagine as
[22:35] God looks at the world right now you see
[22:37] into every imagination evil
[22:40] young people evil you see on the news
[22:42] it's fight it's murder it's this is bad
[22:45] and I could imagine God shakes his head
[22:47] but I believe that there's some people
[22:49] who have found grace in the eyes of the
[22:52] Lord the Bible says if repented God that
[22:59] he made man in other words God almost
[23:00] regrets it even me man because what he
[23:03] made man to do man was not to him he had
[23:06] created man to worship but man was not
[23:09] worship him he had created man to have
[23:11] dominion but man was not having dominion
[23:13] he had created man to be happy but man
[23:16] was not happy he had created man to be
[23:19] sons of God but they were not acting
[23:21] like sons of korah
[23:22] there every imagination was taking them
[23:25] away from God so God said you know what
[23:28] I'm gonna destroy this time I'm gonna
[23:30] destroy manna because this is not what I
[23:33] created them for but God who is rich in
[23:37] grace and mercy whenever he finds
[23:40] somebody who finds grace and insight he
[23:43] could never destroy the righteous of
[23:45] with a wicked him that's why when he
[23:48] spoke to Abraham he say Abraham I can't
[23:50] hide from you what I'm about to do but
[23:53] what's happening in Sodom and Gomorrah
[23:55] has disturbed me so I've come down to
[23:58] take care of business up but Abraham was
[24:01] such a soldier he started to negotiate
[24:04] with God is there somebody tonight who
[24:07] answer negotiate with God
[24:10] Court had made up his mind I'm gonna
[24:13] wipe out Sodom and Gomorrah
[24:16] but Abraham Sarah wait a minute Lord
[24:18] wait one minute if there are 50 would
[24:20] you wipe it out he said no not for 15
[24:23] Abraham when he plays it they're 40
[24:26] he said no I'm gonna spit I can't do it
[24:29] even if it's 30 Abraham push and he
[24:32] pushes a lot of his 10 and when God
[24:34] investigated he sent the angels to
[24:37] investigate he couldn't even find him he
[24:40] and his family and he had to bring them
[24:44] out of because God can never destroy the
[24:47] righteous with the wicked if god has to
[24:50] send angels to pull you out of wherever
[24:53] you are he is clutch sirtuins up because
[24:56] that's what makes him god he is
[24:59] obligated to defend his name he is
[25:02] obligated
[25:05] you may be seated the message last
[25:08] Sunday but the dealer was speaking and
[25:10] he said when man fell yes man lost a lot
[25:15] but he said God had a lot more at stake
[25:17] because God wanted fellowship God wanted
[25:20] a family God had made an investment and
[25:23] when God looked at it he saw his
[25:26] investment going down the drain he said
[25:29] I can't lose all of this investment
[25:31] I can't lose all of this investment up I
[25:33] can't lose all the attributes that I
[25:36] poured into this man called Adam I'm not
[25:38] giving up that easy
[25:40] I spent time to make him I spent time to
[25:43] phone him
[25:44] I spent time to call him I put his name
[25:46] on the book a lamb was slain before the
[25:52] foundation of the world before Adam was
[25:55] even there I'm not about to lose this
[25:58] investment and God has made an
[26:00] investment up in you yes for you
[26:05] that blood price that was paid on
[26:07] Calvary
[26:08] God is not gonna lose his investment he
[26:11] is not gonna waste his investment he has
[26:14] paid for you because he saw you valuable
[26:16] he paid for you because there's
[26:19] something in you that's gonna come forth
[26:21] gonna be manifested gonna be made
[26:24] visible the world may not see it yet
[26:27] what is there you may not see it yet but
[26:30] it's there
[26:31] you'll name a minute see it but it's
[26:33] there your boss may not see it but it's
[26:35] there there's a seed in your soul and
[26:38] the devil is mad but I'm so glad
[26:43] halleluyah halleluyah
[26:46] you may be seated so I want you to
[26:49] understand no I didn't even know what
[26:52] was going on Noah was living his life
[26:55] just pleasing God he wasn't doing it to
[26:58] impress God you know he was doing it
[27:00] because it was his attribute to find
[27:03] siva in the eyes of god he wasn't
[27:06] thinking you know I think all couldn't
[27:08] judge the world this is why I behaving
[27:10] like that do we know as acting was
[27:14] normal living for him his normal
[27:17] behavior got caused attention he didn't
[27:22] know he was being observed he didn't
[27:25] know he was being monitored he didn't
[27:28] know an examination was going on but
[27:30] Noor was passing the exam with flying
[27:33] colors his life his parrot of his
[27:38] behavior his attitude caught us him that
[27:41] man I can't let that man lay not that
[27:45] son not that boy not that son and I know
[27:50] what the Bible says all these men we
[27:53] preach about were men of like passion
[27:55] meaning they were just like you and me
[27:57] but they defy the odds they were just
[28:01] like you and me but when the other was
[28:03] against them though he slay me yet still
[28:05] I'll trust him job was just like you and
[28:08] me but when he said other skin worms
[28:11] destroy my body he was sick but the odds
[28:15] were against him but he didn't give up
[28:18] he didn't backslide didn't go back to
[28:21] the world he got where he got tired but
[28:24] something kept going something kept him
[28:27] alive and that's why we are here tonight
[28:30] something has kept us alive when all
[28:33] hell is against you because hell could
[28:35] never stop you
[28:38] can the church seaman somebody give what
[28:42] a shot up phrase Oh hallelujah
[28:46] listen the devil has tried for thousands
[28:51] of years
[28:52] just stop God and up to know he can do
[28:56] it every time he tried to cut this woman
[29:03] off and cut this one off and cut this
[29:06] one off and the biggest mistake he made
[29:08] his when he killed Jesus because Abraham
[29:13] was troubled nor was troubled ruler was
[29:15] trouble Joe was trouble
[29:17] everybody was trouble in her own right
[29:18] when Shana was supposed to go this way
[29:21] and you know went at me it ever was like
[29:24] yeah you see I knew you wasn't gonna
[29:25] make it or is he gonna backslide
[29:30] Jonah's supposed to be preaching in
[29:32] Nineveh and to nasir not me I take any
[29:34] port towards this way and when Shana had
[29:37] in this way and he devil laughing god
[29:40] laughing loader because God know the end
[29:43] of the story you see the devil doesn't
[29:47] know how the story is going to end but
[29:50] God knows the end of the story
[29:52] that's what makes him God he is alpha
[29:55] and he is Omega
[29:58] he is the beginning he is the ending
[30:02] so don't give up in the middle of your
[30:04] story there's a bigger life going on
[30:07] it's a life of Jubilee it's a laugh of I
[30:10] know you're gonna make it
[30:11] don't wipe the tear from your eyes lift
[30:14] up your shoulders destroy your head back
[30:17] here sickness in the face and say yet in
[30:21] my flesh I shall see God that is my
[30:24] testimony that will be your testimony
[30:27] and the church semen oh and Juna Juna in
[30:35] the wheel do it on the ship rather and
[30:38] the ship began to rock she will not know
[30:41] one time that he is a problem because
[30:44] when you're not in position you know you
[30:46] are the problem
[30:46] your blessing only comes when you are in
[30:49] position so when I feel deep or shaky
[30:51] looking around them they trying to cast
[30:53] lots to see who it is it's Alisa
[30:55] forget all that I just threw me
[30:57] overboard throw me overboard I went to
[31:00] church on overboard there was a prepare
[31:02] the first GPS directed prepared
[31:05] submarine vessel that was ever created
[31:08] all I'm suffering they have no is trying
[31:11] to be immediate cost original vessel to
[31:15] transport sons
[31:18] because Jonah had a destination for some
[31:22] people to be delivered and God has a
[31:26] destination for some sons and daughters
[31:28] to be delivered that's why we having a
[31:31] deliverance service tonight for whatever
[31:33] is chaining you down whatever is binding
[31:36] you whatever is hole in you plaque for
[31:39] you to break free
[31:40] watch the chains and break free God
[31:43] never need to unlock it you have the
[31:45] power to break free you are superhero
[31:49] tonight whatever chain they put you
[31:52] could break free like Samson and chain
[31:55] him he broke free nobody had to help him
[31:58] but when the Spirit of the Lord came
[32:00] upon him and activated what was already
[32:04] in him you don't need something new you
[32:06] already got something you need something
[32:09] more more more than the church amen
[32:17] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and
[32:25] God he made away and a door of
[32:31] deliverance opened up to the people of
[32:35] nineveh jonah vigilant bondage moses
[32:40] came on a door of deliverance open up to
[32:47] them
[32:47] we heard it Sunday and I think I said it
[32:50] a Sunday before speaking about that man
[32:52] who got the pardon that was written from
[32:55] which we get a part is not a pardon
[32:57] until it's accepted there was a door
[32:59] that was open to him he chose not to
[33:02] step through that door and not accept a
[33:05] pardon so - in the days of Noah Noah is
[33:09] under the anointing he's inspired God
[33:12] didn't speak to his wife
[33:13] Gordon speak to his children God and
[33:15] speak to his neighbors God spoke to
[33:17] Noah's you know I'm gonna judge the
[33:19] earth build an ark and Noah went into
[33:22] action and defy the odds because what he
[33:25] was preaching had never happened that's
[33:27] a difficult message to preach it's
[33:30] easier to preach now because we are
[33:32] speaking of what has happened and
[33:33] there's going to repeat and bring back
[33:35] the old days back to Pentecost that's
[33:37] easy to preach no had it hard it will
[33:40] rain and rain had never fallen before
[33:43] there was no reference point for Noah
[33:46] we have many references David John job
[33:49] Jonah
[33:50] Elijah all examples to get inspiration
[33:53] when it Noah get his inspiration from it
[33:55] will rain but it was caught said soon a
[33:59] revelation in his soul that captain
[34:02] building building against the odds bring
[34:04] more go forward bring the table bring
[34:07] the animals bring everything and he was
[34:09] building
[34:10] and a door was open that anybody could
[34:15] have walked in that door was not
[34:17] exclusively for Noah and for Noah's
[34:21] family
[34:21] Noah's preaching was to get the
[34:24] attention of the public to come into
[34:26] that door
[34:27] Noah small ministry was about that door
[34:31] because once you cross the threshold of
[34:34] the door you were in the Ark of safety
[34:36] his Hall of gospel was come into the Ark
[34:40] of safety come into this door of
[34:44] deliverance if you are outside at all
[34:46] you're not gonna make it but if you step
[34:49] into the door you're gonna be all right
[34:51] and you step through the door you're
[34:55] gonna be safe if you step through the
[34:57] door
[34:58] you're gonna eat in plenty and be
[35:00] satisfied because a storm is coming up a
[35:03] flood is coming judgment is coming and
[35:06] Noah preached year-after-year service
[35:09] after service he had two preacher his
[35:12] children he had to preach to his wife he
[35:14] had to preach his friends he was a man
[35:18] of light passion I'm sorry he had
[35:19] neighbors I'm sorry of people that know
[35:23] I grew up with that people who used to
[35:26] call him no no what you doing come hang
[35:36] out this evening with us no see I'm
[35:38] building because the rain is coming
[35:42] what rain is talking about know what is
[35:46] rain laughing and mocking and Noah had
[35:55] to keep on going when nobody else
[35:57] understood it's one thing if you're in a
[36:01] group and the group has a understanding
[36:03] and revelation and you're doing it
[36:04] together but Noah had no help because he
[36:08] was the only one with a revelation his
[36:10] wife didn't have the revelation his
[36:13] children have the revelation he was the
[36:14] only one and he was standing in the gap
[36:18] for his wife standing in the gap for his
[36:21] children so don't think you come in to
[36:23] services and accidental by chance you
[36:26] are standing in the gap for your house
[36:28] you are standing in the gap for your
[36:31] family they may not be here tonight but
[36:34] you are the key to unlock in their
[36:36] future you are the key to unlocking them
[36:39] because the Jesus I will be failing you
[36:42] will be the Jesus that they will see
[36:44] there are people who are not
[36:45] predestinated to read the books and the
[36:48] tapes but when they see you they see the
[36:50] books and the tapes because you are
[36:52] written in missiles read unknown of men
[36:57] you may be seated
[36:59] I'm not gonna be too long with you just
[37:02] to shake you a little bit no I had the
[37:05] hardest message ever preached no one
[37:08] preached and nobody would come to the
[37:10] altar
[37:14] no one priest for the cars and nobody
[37:17] would repent no I had no fruits of his
[37:21] ministry beyond this family think about
[37:24] it
[37:25] could you imagine your ministry is over
[37:28] a hundred years and there's not one
[37:29] convert because things were so bad the
[37:34] Bible says every imagination was evil
[37:38] the minds of the people have been grown
[37:41] accustomed to being not about God and
[37:44] the things of God the devil a consuming
[37:46] like this deer that will consume the
[37:49] people minds with the styles and the
[37:52] fashions and the cares of life and being
[37:54] so PC your every imagination is being
[37:57] influenced by another and that influence
[38:00] is one of evil what is your influence
[38:04] tonight but there is hope there is a
[38:06] door there is a tour of deliverance we
[38:10] read the scripture in the book of
[38:12] Revelation 3 and verse it be all I set
[38:15] before you an open door no man open this
[38:19] door no man could shut this door and
[38:22] when the random brought out that after
[38:24] Luther and Wesley there was no messenger
[38:26] to the Pentecostal age Christ Himself
[38:30] dropped down and open the door that door
[38:32] was the door of the Holy Ghost no man
[38:35] had opened it and no man has the power
[38:37] to close it and that door has remained
[38:40] open so whoever wants to step into the
[38:43] Holy Ghost but if Adam said Christ is
[38:46] the door the church is not the door but
[38:48] the Holy Ghost is the door and you can
[38:50] step through the door tonight just as
[38:52] people have the opportunity let's
[38:55] capture the door in the days of Noah
[38:56] what will you do tonight will you
[38:59] outside or will you come inside I
[39:01] challenge you to come inside tonight can
[39:05] the church say man for the Branham said
[39:09] very ejected not Noah but they rejected
[39:14] Jesus Christ in North that's who they
[39:18] rejected they didn't reject MOA because
[39:21] but everyone said it was Christ in Noah
[39:23] but the balance said they rejected the
[39:25] Word of God for that each can the church
[39:31] shame Noah is Dan the Ark and the Bible
[39:39] says God shut him in he didn't closed
[39:44] the door he didn't lock anybody off it
[39:48] was God had shot him in and when that
[39:55] door was shut the opportunity for
[39:57] salvation had passed the day of grace
[40:01] had transitioned into a day of judgment
[40:05] the world didn't realize that for all
[40:08] the years Noor was preaching the
[40:10] judgment the plagues of flood was being
[40:12] held back until Noah could be sealed
[40:14] into Christ until he could be in
[40:17] position before God could shut the door
[40:20] no one had to be in his place and before
[40:24] God could shut the door
[40:27] Noah has to be in his place Noah this
[40:31] type of this bride who finds favor in
[40:34] God's eyes has to be in her place
[40:37] what place are you in tonight because
[40:41] the Bible said that comes a day when he
[40:43] who is righteous is righteous still he
[40:49] us filty is filthy still you know there
[40:53] are some people when they want to buy
[40:55] something buy a fridge buy a stove buy a
[40:59] car it has take that time and check
[41:02] things check it out good know because
[41:05] you don't to take any chances
[41:09] and it's amazing how people depending on
[41:13] the value of what they want to get they
[41:15] will spend more time investigating to
[41:17] not take chances chances about something
[41:22] that is temporary because no matter how
[41:26] you're investigating cloud the use guy
[41:28] won by to check the engine to check the
[41:31] spark plugs if they still have that
[41:32] whatever else they have no one near that
[41:35] car will not be able to start one in a
[41:39] car will not be able to go anywhere but
[41:41] it's an age of man to check it out in
[41:44] the natural it amazes me how in the
[41:47] spiritual people want to gamble with
[41:52] their souls and take a chance take a
[41:56] chance by not weighing your decisions
[42:00] not weighing what you're doing and
[42:03] service after service would come and the
[42:06] tour is preached every service the Doris
[42:09] preached and people choose one if you
[42:16] know where the Branham said when he was
[42:18] ministering to the audiences and the
[42:19] Holy Ghost would be there and he would
[42:21] be on the discernment and people would
[42:23] come to him and he'd say your name is
[42:25] so-and-so and you lived in so-and-so and
[42:27] then the ears are lowered pull him over
[42:29] there and pull him over there
[42:30] and he said there would be people who
[42:32] were to be healed that he would say it's
[42:36] over there and he said it did not
[42:38] respond fast enough and the angel left
[42:43] and they missed it
[42:45] could you imagine it's one thing to not
[42:50] know you miss it that's one thing it's
[42:54] one thing if you miss work one day and
[42:57] they were handing out checks for 10,000
[42:59] others and nobody tell you it happen you
[43:03] wouldn't feel a certain way about it but
[43:06] if the next thing I come you recognize a
[43:08] if I was here I would have gotten it
[43:11] then you live with this regret friends
[43:16] this journey of Christianity is a
[43:20] journey of choice and decision
[43:22] that could lead to regrets that you have
[43:26] the opportunity tonight to avoid those
[43:30] regrets I can imagine
[43:33] Noah's children because no one's
[43:37] children had not also they had not heard
[43:39] from God but they Brandon painted a
[43:42] picture that Noah had to slam the door
[43:45] the window on Noah's children hands
[43:48] because they wanted to go outside they
[43:50] wanted willing participants they didn't
[43:55] say I already want to be in the ark you
[43:56] know daddy already wants to come tonight
[43:58] to be in New York what time you were in
[44:02] that was my deposition but Noah's love
[44:06] for them had almost forced them into the
[44:09] ark and I tell young people all the time
[44:15] try to decision what the parents trying
[44:17] to do in them as human beings we always
[44:23] have differences you may not have to
[44:25] agree with everything but you have to
[44:26] respect and listen what is the motive
[44:29] and objective is it to bring you closer
[44:31] to God but you trying to get you away
[44:33] from good you have to discern the motive
[44:38] and the objective but I wanna know what
[44:40] happened when the door is shut and
[44:42] Noah's children here and their friends
[44:45] on the outside because they would have
[44:49] all heard Noah preached commented here
[44:51] cometh in the ark and I can imagine all
[44:54] those know what sure and being so
[44:56] grateful that daddy had said a or you
[44:59] better get in or else by whatever means
[45:03] necessary to get them in because he knew
[45:05] what was going to happen it would not
[45:08] have been easy for those children to see
[45:10] their friends one by one the flood take
[45:13] them right now in the u.s. there's a
[45:17] hurricane that has been the worst in
[45:20] years lives lost hoses devastated prop
[45:26] she come true I know the Bible said
[45:29] there be Wars rumors of wars different
[45:32] diverse places all kind of and he said
[45:35] he said and you know what the any not
[45:36] even yet there's more coming on but you
[45:41] know what that's not your fear look up
[45:43] your Redemption draweth man because what
[45:47] has happened to the earth has to happen
[45:49] legally earth is preparing to be
[45:51] cleansed for real ordinance to take
[45:54] their place the mountain no the real
[45:58] owners are the trees nobody real owners
[46:00] up we have been hiding for too long as
[46:02] the real owners of this earth because
[46:04] the Bible says we shall reign on it the
[46:07] earth is waiting for the kings the sons
[46:10] of God to walk on the earth but before
[46:13] God will allow you to walk he with the
[46:15] cleanses you were to make sure things
[46:17] and please
[46:18] but the Branham said the reason his
[46:21] sickness and sin he said Satan is the
[46:23] Prince of the power the air he said
[46:25] demons in the atmosphere he said it will
[46:28] take fire to destroy them and when the
[46:30] fire comes it it opens up the whole
[46:32] thing for the whole of creation to
[46:35] transform because some sons of God are
[46:39] coming back into position to walk on
[46:42] streets of gold and to take leaves from
[46:45] the tree see the nations and that's your
[46:49] inheritance eternal life is your
[46:52] inheritance joy unspeakable is your

[49:33] until its destination and it has to be
[49:37] packed a certain way to make sure
[49:39] there's no movement and it's packed
[49:42] right so that when it gets this
[49:43] destination the seal is supposed to tell
[49:46] the man or the other and that nobody
[49:47] tamper with the merchandise what has

[50:44] privileged to know what we know we are
[50:47] so honored to see what we see we ought
[50:49] to be the happiest people on the face of
[50:52] the earth how do we give the Lord a
[50:54] shout of praise
[50:55] that's only 50% can we give the Lord a
[50:58] shout of praise
[51:03] hallelujah I said to them in Nigeria
[51:08] especially young people when people come
[51:12] to church and they tired I doesn't buy a
[51:13] journal because ABC people pass enough
[51:17] to come to church tonight I pass a bar I
[51:19] see word trans and anything I say that
[51:22] there let me play let her and Nathan
[51:25] came tomorrow's holiday so I party all
[51:28] night long and watch them is something
[51:30] else my name is spirit or something when
[51:34] it's election time I see people 4
[51:36] o'clock any morning people who go to bed
[51:42] in the clock
[51:43] - am the up because it wants to know who
[51:46] in because this is the thing people eat
[51:50] p.m. they all call for Christmas night
[51:52] Christmas I forget it go away the
[51:56] harmony of cold how I could sleep I'd
[51:58] have how many other because in the
[52:01] spirit of Christmas I think we talk
[52:06] about it
[52:07] pressures but adjourn Philip went on to
[52:09] be with the Lord one Christmas he have
[52:10] not painted and not painting
[52:13] no Pete what Bible transitions no not me
[52:16] boy Christmas Eve
[52:18] it is he paid did you see kids nobody
[52:24] paying so fast because he spirits are
[52:26] easing it hit him when it hit hard and
[52:30] that's what some of us need to get to
[52:31] hit harder I recognize wait a minute I'm
[52:34] getting out of this place
[52:36] I don't know world forever that's not my
[52:38] passion is that would my personal
[52:40] rejoicing and worship and this is a
[52:43] testing ground to prove that I can make
[52:46] it that I'm counted worthy that I've
[52:48] found grace and save up in the eyes of
[52:50] Almighty God
[52:55] can the church same and the musician to
[52:59] get ready I'm almost finished so I
[53:03] challenge you tonight to make the right
[53:06] choice don't just put your foot here are
[53:10] people watchin eyes that's a very real
[53:11] happy people some time ago I told my dad
[53:17] I say you know sometime people walk into
[53:20] the church and there's something on the
[53:21] floor and for some people if you see
[53:23] something Freudian partyer you'll pick
[53:25] it up so you ask yourself the question
[53:28] why would somebody come into the house
[53:30] of God is at my front passage Street and
[53:33] say there has to be only one answer
[53:35] because in their house
[53:43] they have grown accustomed to pass in
[53:47] suffering wrong so to them is no it's no
[53:50] difference because this half waiting
[53:54] people like Newton have who you know
[53:55] every when I was young I was in the
[53:57] world I was delivered from Edward when
[54:01] amongst a clean up well join every one
[54:04] day I clean up little bit kappa damn
[54:06] police up under the covers
[54:07] I see the fastest cleanups ever clean up
[54:17] me room or else cupboard open and
[54:20] everything going up but you didn't know
[54:21] how it fit if you open that cupboard you
[54:25] wouldn't believe what coming only cover
[54:29] but that is what happens when they doing
[54:31] something halfway and God wants us to go
[54:36] all the way generally the race is not
[54:40] for the Swift but when you indoors until
[54:44] and endurance until the end is not a
[54:49] measure of test of strength it's a
[54:52] measure of test of willpower because you
[54:56] can be tired but still in BO they could
[54:59] be bruised but still endure he could
[55:02] have lost a lot but there's something in
[55:05] you that says you know what I'm gonna in
