service brother Joshua Philip God bless you amen wonderful my praise God well pastors put it upon uh put it upon me to come to you with a message this morning and the Lord has quick and some to my heart so we'll turn over now to the scripture amen and I want to tun to three portions of scriptures amen thank you musicians praise God Hallelujah um we want to go to the book of St Matthew Chapter 13 we're going to read from verse 3 to 17 and then we'll read a scripture in Isaiah and then Revelation okay so amen hallelujah praise God Amen St Matthew chapter 3en uh St Matthew chapter 3 uh sorry St Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 3 amen sorry about that mix it up um praise God so so you can find chapter 13 and um and then we read from three uh verse three so here he's talking about the parable of the the the S and the seed amen so from verse three it says and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a sore went forth to swow amen and when he swed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and fought with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold and some 30 fold who are THS to hear Let Him hear now hear this part and the disciples came unto him uh and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he had therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled a prophecy as is of of isas which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing he shall see and not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are full are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear Jesus said for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which he see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them amen so very privileged people we are this morning Amen to see what we see and to hear what we hear okay so let's go over now to Isaiah book of Isaiah chapter 55 familiar scripture and then we go over to Revelation chapter 10 uh 1- 7 amen Isaiah 55 reading from verse 6 amen bit lengthy with the scriptures this morning and do apologize but uh there's a few things that the Lord wants to bring out here this morning so we'll just go through amen but Isaiah 6 uh chapter 55 and: 6 says uh uh seek ye the Lord while he may be found and call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the righteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon Him unto our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but water the Earth and maketh it bring forth fruit uh bring forth and bird that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen now going over to Revelation chap 10 1-7 amen praise God and then we we'll pray once more amen hallelujah so Revelation chapter 10 from verse one talking about a little book says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it with the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried out a loud voice as when a lion Roy and when he had cried seven Thunders uted their voices and when the seven Thunders had uted their voices I was about to ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them down and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in are the earth and the things that there in are and the Sea and the things which are therein that they should be time no longer but in the days of the Void of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets let's bow our heads one more timeall Heavenly Father we've read your word Lord and Lord we pray Lord father you bring life to these scriptures here now Lord God here we stand in great need of thee Lord I stand here father with your people Lord may you speak with to our hearts Lord father Lord by Your Word Lord father May

hooked up this morning that we can't see physically but they are in the spirit this morning just as we are in the spirit waiting on the coming of the Lord hallelujah amen amen hallelujah isn't that right so I have a title this morning and my title is the greatest message on the earth amen and amen hallelujah praise God the greatest message on the earth we have received a message it's the greatest message that ever there ever to come in this age praise God hallelujah isn't that right and for every age there was a message that went forth but there's a people in the land to receive that

that time the Bible said lift up your head because Redemption draw it nigh a message come to us in the middle of Darkness a message of light let there be light a message have been spoken to our hearts God had predestinated a message to come to a people in this time now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh praise God Amen hallu oh Hallelujah we thank God for a message a message from God yes it is God communicating with us amen that's what a message means it's actually a written the the definition of a message is either a verbal or written or a recorded communication sent to or left for a recipient which is a specific person so God in his thinking had a message to send to us in 2016 so in his mind he knew that we would be here in his mind he knew that we would have mistakes he knew we would fall he knew we would grel through the mud he knew we'd be this way and that but in our hearts we were to be Sons and Daughters of God God knew that so God before the beginning had a message of redemption God before the beginning had a message of light to come to this Dark Age oh had the prophet put a little sliver of Light by faith knowing that a message would get to a bride in Trinidad a bride all over the world he had a message predestinated for us a message that was pre-recorded a message that was preent oh had to be delivered to our hearts oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal we were we were unaware of it we didn't know about it oh it was our inheritance but we didn't know we had an inheritance we thought we were bastard children we thought we were orphans we thought we were strangers and we only get to realize that God is our father oh Hallelujah and if God is our father then what does that make you this morning if you shall say to this mountain be moved there's a little bit of C in you this morning I can't hear you I can't hear you my people that are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray and turn from their Wicked Ways God will hear from heaven and God will answer the Cry of his children oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so it's a message I'm going to try to bring this real simple this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's a message for you it's a message for me it's a message to call us out of L this year out of this dark and cruel age

sinner such as I and made me a p a great price oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah God in his mind had a love letter for you God in his thinking had a message for you and the Beautiful part is he knew that you would receive it because there's not everybody that could receive it Jesus said I come not for the world but for them which thou have called for they are mine and all mine are thine and I will be glorified in them oh hallelujah hallelujah this message come to wake us up this message come to give us Faith this message

together he's doing it this morning but a prophecy is going out let these Dry Bones live let the SS come upon these bones and let breath come into you this morning receive you the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my praise God wow well that was our introduction blessed be the name of the Lord woo I feel like we're hearing from Heaven this morning forms of communication the Bible preserved for thousands of years waiting for you to read it oh just think about it when Peter was reading God said this is for her when John was writing God said this is for my children in 2016 they are going to read the same word and it will be life to them and my spirit will come upon them and make this word that has been laying in this Bible for all these years but the devil is going to see another Jesus intr in Europe in Germany in France Wherever Whenever that we walk in the streets Satan us Mountain be moved W who is this uncircum Philistine this morning there is another people another [Applause] people oh wonderful glorious amen is his name Jesus amen okay give me a break here amen amen okay so we on fire this morning amen that's good amen well the devil is outside praise God spiritual meaning of a communication spiritual meaning of a message listen to this it's a communication in a for from a prophet or a preacher that is believed to be inspired of God isn't that right that's a spiritual meaning of a message that is sent from God isn't that right so throughout human history man has tried to communicate his messages communication is a very important form of of how we operate here on Earth isn't that right in his Earthly way message sending is very important because we have to be able to communicate with one another to be able to get our ideas across and to be able to get our opinions across and to be able to achieve certain objectives we have to be able to send a message isn't that right and as far as history tells us the first form of communication was shouting isn't that right so they tried to shout they had shouting contests I heard and the furthest they ever got was 100 m which wasn't very far so they realized that a more effective form of communication was to run with the message Hallelujah isn't that right so they would give a messenger the message and that messenger would have to run with the message to the intended destination to the intended target isn't that right it was more effective than shouting because he couldn't get far with shouting but if you sent a messenger with the message it'd be a more effective form of communication so think about it Hallelujah God in this in these ages that have gone past had Messengers who ran with their message in their day Luther ran with his message oh Hallelujah when he got to a certain place he passed his message on to Wesley and Wesley ran with his message and when Wesley ran he ran and got to a certain place and he passed his message on to Malachi 4 and he ran with a message oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah who do you say this is praise God I say to you this morning the message has got home oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah I'm told I'm told in a time of War my God that's before they had the internet young people they had these Messengers used to run with the message and sometimes a camp would be be in trouble the enemy would be on approach and they didn't have enough to take out the enemy so they have to send a messenger with a message to go for backup to get help for them and sometimes if this messenger got seen by the enemy they would try to take them out they would try to wipe them out they would try to kill them and that's what the devil's been trying to do all these years he's been trying to kill God's Messengers he's been trying to cut them off he's been trying to cut them off from getting to us because if that message ever got to us if we ever got to realize who we really are the devil was going to be in trouble so the devil said don't let them get that message the devil shut arrows the devil shoot at them oh how he try to kill them but the message this morning is out the secret is out this morning the word is in the pride oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hall hallelujah hallelujah now they say that message sending or communication all right is based on a language okay so they say the sender and the receiver have to speak the same language in order for the message to be effective yes that's why the Tower of Babel was almost a success because they were speaking the same language isn't that right and they were able to communicate with each other and tell each other what the vision was and once they were unified on the vision then they began to build and even in a building process the communication had to be the same the language whatever the form of communication they were using had to be the same and everybody had to be on the same page in order for this thing to work and they were so in one mind that they were so in one Accord that it brought God to attention it brought God's uh alertness to the situation that was developing here on Earth with this city called Babel oh this Tower called Babel rather and God spoke and said the people are one they are in one mind they are in one Accord and they are going to achieve what they set up to accomplish so God changed language and had everybody speaking a different tongue and when that happened well we know the whole thing fell flat isn't that right yes now spiritually speaking we have to be speaking the same language if it is we're going to be unified on the vision that Malachi 4 had said and that Malachi 4 had promised so we can't be saying one thing over here and another thing over there and another interpretation over there and this one preaching that and this one believes this thing no it has to be whatever the prophet spoke that's what's going to happen word on top of word line by line here a little there a little until we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God into the measure of the stature of the perfect man oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so when we say seven tunders get fate we are speaking the same language when we say seven tunders gather a bride together we are speaking the same language when we say the Holy Ghost is promised to be poured out upon individuals we are speaking the same language when we say you are going to be delivered we are speaking the same language when we say you are going to be healed we are speaking the same language oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah they were in the upper room and they were praising in God's name because they understood the language they were speaking the same thing they were in one mind they were in one Accord they were single Eye Single motive single purpose and G heard from Heaven they heard the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's like a love letter hallelujah amen and the sender is sending the love letter this man or this woman who is in love is sending a letter to someone else else who loves them back just the same and they are speaking a certain kind of language now if you and I pick up the letter we may not understand everything that they are saying there are little idiosyncrasies in there there are little there little jokes in there there are inside jokes in there there are things that you don't know about but when that person who shares that special connection with that special somebody when they read the letter when they pick up the letter of whatever it is saying they begin to say oh my oh wonderful oh how wonderful oh Hallelujah they bubbling over you want to know what they're smiling about you want to know how long they could talk for but brother when you in love you don't care about the hours when you in love you fall asleep on the phone you read the letter over and over because you in love well your father in Heaven loves you so much that he had a love letter for you Hallelujah Hallelujah we are here to read it for you this morning Who Shall Believe our report his report says you are free his report says you are sealed his report says you are delivered his report says your family is coming his report says you are going to make it his report says you are one of them his report says not many days hence I shall visit you praise God oh oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what does a message do it gets you ready for what's coming next the world doesn't have a clue what's coming next but the prophet left us a message and brother we going to get ready for the coming of the Lord I don't know about you but I'm going to get ready oh isn't that right there once was a woman she was a washer woman she washed dishes that's what she loved to do she L to clean and keep the house tidy and they were having a party one time and all this great Duke was supposed to come by and visit them this great rich young man and everybody was ready for the party but she wasn't in that party thing praise God she had to wash her dishes she was in the back washing the wees and doing what she had to do and this great man came along everybody was all sweetened up and perfumed and they were all in the party and in the spirit of the thing and they were toasting their glasses and they were in the spirit of the

amen isn't that right oh my did I flip on here I think I missed something or did I amen praise God oh okay in every age God had a message isn't that right God gave a message to Noah isn't that right one time the world was so wicked evil it was Darkness all around and God had repented that he made it made man Hallelujah but Noah found Grace in God's side and Noah whispered a mess it was whispered a message by God saying that it will rain build me an ark of go for word Noah was the only one who received that message and from the time that that message was spoken Noah had a burden to build an ark as the Lord had said Hallelujah for 20 years he went with his message and he preached It Will Rain to a generation of people who had seen no rain because in those days the Mist Still Water the Earth like in Genesis so they'd never seen rain before they'd never seen water and for fall from the sky like that like rain and so on they' never seen that so this was a weird thing this was a strange thing to them they'd never known about this rain and so on and and Noah was preaching something at that time that was contrary to the people amen it was contrary that this rain message it will rain It Will Rain It Will Rain Hallelujah isn't that right and the people didn't know about this rain so they argued it they debated it but nevertheless it was a word from the Lord it was a word from God hallelujah it was God's word to the people hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right and it came through Noah it came through an unlikely vessel it came through an unlikely person but God hallelujah burd Noah with this message I knowah preached it in season out of season no matter what this one was saying no matter what that one was saying no matter how much doubt there was in the church he preached It Will Rain It Will Rain it will rain oh Hallelujah and one day it did rain one day the door was shut one day no more flesh could be saved one day no one his family was in the ark and the C manifested what he had spoken to them oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that was a message for that day Hallelujah isn't that right lat on down through the years God gave Moses a message that's right he said let my people go the hour of my Deliverance has come to the people of the children uh to the to the children of Israel down in Egypt Hallelujah isn't that right the time on God's watch was over for the bondage of the people of Israel down in Egypt praise God hallelujah they were slaving they were there 400 years but God had given a word a message to Moses to go down there and to let my people go all the time Moses is in the ordinary Moses is in his thing Moses is in his humanistic Moses is going to work and coming back home but Moses doesn't know Hallelujah that time is up for the Egyptians Moses doesn't know the same place he ran from is the same place he has to go back to Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah and God begin to cause an attraction on the mountain and when Moses said I turn aside to see what is this thing that God is calling me to Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah God begin to speak to Moses and say take your shoes from off your feet for the place where under out standers is Holy hallelujah hallelujah take your shoes from off your feet I want to speak to you I want to tell you something the Egyptians down there they have my people in bondage they have my people in slavery they have my people in in decimation but I have come down to deliver them according to my word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right [Music] hallu that was a message for that day let my people go now that seem impossible because as far as the Egyptians are aware the people of Israel have no hope they have no way of getting out of this slavery condition they have no way of being released from their bondage these fets and chains on their hands seemed like they would last forever they were big chains they were thick chains they were being beaten they were being mocked and scor but little did the devil know that those chains had a time limit on it the devil didn't know that didn't matter how big those chains was how much he beat them how much he whipped them it had a time limit on it and that time was ticking down ticking down oh and all that the devil tried to do to us all throughout the years oh but it has a time limit on it oh Hallelujah your sickness is not forever your trial is not forever your circumstance is not forever God in his own time is going to break the chains off of your life praise God hallelujah that's not forever no no no weeping mejoy for night but I say this morning Joy comes in the morning Joy comes to those who are willing to wait for him oh Hallelujah he will answer you according to the time of life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah here was Moses little old man with a stick and his his his his uh servant Aaron with him going down to Egypt Hallelujah what's he going for a little man with a stick and a old tattered robe and some old clothes on and a long bed he's over 40 praise God hallelujah he's in the desert but he's going down to take over he's an age man praise God 40 years have passed he can't do anything in his own strength but he had a message from God hallelujah he's not responding or believing in his own strength in his own will and power he can't do anything about those children down there but God is with him and the same God that spoke to him is the same God that's going to deal with this situation brother when God speaks to your heart when God gives you Liberty in your soul brother you can stand anywhere you could do anything because God is in control God is in charge of the situation God is in charge of the circumstance oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's why Shadrach mesach and Abednego were so confident in their exploits H they were so confident in that circumstance that they were in they were willing to hot the fire seven times hotter and they had a testimony that even if all God don't deliver us we will not bow down because we believe in this God we speak of this God we know this God hallelujah and we here to make a testimony for God Hal we here to make a stand for God whether he Deliver us or whether he don't deliver us we are going to stand anyhow praise God whether he come or whether he don't come even if I can't hear from God the devil is not going to move me is that your testimony brother I'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water I shall not be moved oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah that's why when we pray we believe that we have receiv and we shall receive it hallelujah hallelujah because the vict Tre is in your mind first then you go out to the battle that's what Jesus did you lay there in the G of Garden of Gethsemane and pleaded and crying what was he doing he was overcoming there on his knees his sweat like drips of blood but he was overcoming overcoming not my will Lord but thy will be done and that's what you have to do sometimes when your good self because your good self is rotten your good self is nothingness oh I'm not talking about bad self bad self is smoking and drinking and lying and fornicating but I'm talking about the good self that good self that doesn't want to die that good self that pays tithes that good self that comes early and that good self that don't spit on the sidewalk that same good self has to die one of these days if Christ is ever to live in you that good self that nice self that pretty self that one self you look at in the mirror every morning that same self has got to die not my will Lord but thy will be done you got to be willing to die oh isn't that right Samson said let me die with my Philistines I'm willing to give it up I'm willing to give it all up give up my life give up my will give up my desires give up all my hopes give up all my dreams for the one that save me praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah got be willing to die Jesus said unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abide alone that's right but when it die it bringeth forth much fruit oh Hallelujah there's victory in death yes there's Hallelujah an overcoming in death there's is a blessing in death don't look at death as a sad thing don't ever have a sad face when you talk about that spiritual death because that's where God thrives in you that's where God comes out in you the less of more of yourself you become is the more God becomes more and more inside of you the less of yourself you become the less the more God rips away from you and rips away your pride rips away your selfishness rips away your anger rips away the hurt takes away the pain takes away all that the past has done to you God is reforming you God is reshaping you God is transforming you there in the silence the devil cover you over with the dirt but he didn't know that you were a seed he didn't know that you had a promise of Life inside of you and and life throw dirt on you and this circumstance throw dirt on you and you can't see the sun no more but but but but there's a life there's a law inside of the seed Hallelujah and that law has got to live out that law has got to come forth oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hall praise God Amen silent period it's very dark and you don't see anything hallu there's no signs of life there's nothing to encourage you there's nothing to to to look up to there's just darkness everywhere Hallelujah but the real thing is not to look on the outside but there's something on the inside that God is getting ready to bring out and the Holy Spirit that watering spirit is really to come upon the seed inside of you yes sir and to bring out the qualities of who you are in it time and season yes sir isn't that right praise God hallelujah because when a message come it's a word and it's a word of anointing For That season and time and day isn't that right and in US is an anointing in US is a word that is to be come forth in his hour and season and in it time praise God hallelujah isn't that right so it doesn't matter what the circumstances and there's a time of lingering before God brings on his promised word hallelujah he's there and you don't know it Abraham stayed there in the spirit 25 years he didn't hear nothing he didn't see nothing yet he's journeying yet he's traveling and holding on to something holding on to that word that was spoken to him he nursed on the Promises of God it will be it will be I shall have a son oh Hallelujah he gave them a promise of it he changed Abram's name to Abraham which means father of Nations so every time sah was Coring in the morning and telling him something praise God and she utter his name he couldn't help but remember God's promise every time he spoke her name they remembered God's promise because they very names was to take on life one day oh Hallelujah and your name is not Lil your name is not John Jones but the mystery of what the book is while it is calling those names so every morning we come to church and say you are going to be filled every morning we say seven tunders give fi seven tunders gathered a right together and when we speak your name it renews your faith it renews the promise of God you get stronger and stronger because we are prophesying over [Applause] you oh it shall be it shall be oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so anytime we hear it it ought to renew us it ought to shake the world off of us it ought to shake the weeds off of us isn't that right we are journeying and sometimes on a journey you might have to pass through some strange places isn't that right sometimes you might even get some weeds on your clothes you know what they're talking about little bud bud and they have to pull it off your shoes isn't that right and sometimes the world has a way of putting things things on you sins and mistakes and faults and shortcomings and he gets stuff all over but this morning we come to pick it off one by one going to pull it off of you praise God hallelujah get those things off of you don't let those things hold you back Shine Your Shoes this morning your shoulder come on Hallelujah get to Stepping get to moving you're a Son of God hallelujah take the world off of you take those little things off of you don't let nothing hold you back don't let nothing keep you back keep going forward

Wonder wonderful Hallelujah let my people go he uttered his message yes what did Pharaoh do well he laughed because that was real funny two guys come in the middle of my Courtyard among thousands of soldiers to tell me to let his people go who is he is he God he speaks like God but he don't look powerful he's a old man praise God what does he has to do with me but they didn't see the size of the god that was with him HJ oh hallelujah hallelujah they didn't see the god of Israel Hallelujah he was getting ready to flex muscles oh they were laughing at what they could see but what what if they could see what they couldn't see they wouldn't be laughing then but God was getting ready to show himself strong God was getting ready see what God hated was their pride because if it wasn't for Joseph had sojourned in that land had they not survived the seven years of famine God is what put them in that position of prosperity and God is what had them in that place yes of power it was God that had them in that that that strategic economical position they were prospering because of the people that were in that land hallelujah hallelujah wherever you go God has your cup to run over your footsteps are ordered of the Lord God has blessings following you Hallelujah you don't even know about it that's why you're here this morning that's why the devil hates you cuz every move you make God makes a way of Escape for you every move you make God opens a door for you hallah the devil gets mad but he can't catch you Hallelujah he's running behind you but you keep on running as long as you're running and the devil's behind you it mean he hasn't got you so keep on running Hallelujah God will cut off your enemies praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and every time the enemy come with of blood the spirit of God raise a standard against it raise a standard against it raise a standard against it amen and the message of the hour went forth amen isn't that right hallelujah amen oh my taking up so much time here all right well let me speed on praise God so all these prophets were in Shadow of type and the one that was to come was Jesus Christ Son of God isn't that right I'll read here from um White had to be shepherd He said now remember the Messiah was already in the city born in a city in a stable right by the great Cathedrals where the high priests and the great priests and the theologians and the wise and the trained all was there waiting for the Messiah and there he was right in their midst but why then did they go talking about those angels He said why then did they go to out to the hills of Judea to unlearned untrained uncultured poorest of all look like like the most unfit person for such a task to reveal the message and to send send them out to bring the message hallelu brandom said you know my opinion he said it might not all Mount to very much but I want to pass my opinion he said I believe it's because of the wisdom of God that he knew that they wouldn't receive such a message because of the way it come they wouldn't receive such a message he said it wasn't in the taste of their learning he said it was different it was what they had been trained to believe he would be like oh my see what human interpretations does God gives a word a messiah will come and then man put his own interpretation to it as to how this Messiah would come and they got torn off isn't that right he said it wasn't the taste of their learning it was different it wasn't the way that they had trained to believe he would be like it was contrary to their theological understanding all their training all their learning was bypass become not he said I believe it was the wisdom of God that knew that they wouldn't receive such a message he said so the Messiah was here and they must be somebody to recognize it and he knew those who hadn't been mixed up in such stuff as that he he would be more able to get his message to an unlearned group that he would be uh uh that he would be that to a mixed groupall that was so set in their ways and that nothing could turn them on not even the word of God what a condition so there's two groups there's one that Hallelujah has got their own interpretation and there's another group a group of people who are simple humble looking for God to be made manifest in their own lives they don't feel worthy of it Hallelujah but this is the people that God could use these are the people that God could find and we may not much think much of ourselves but but you are one who God was looking for all the time Hallelujah if you're too much in your head oh Hallelujah God can't use you if you're too much in your own human reasoning God can't use you if you're too much in your own educations and in your own learnings and what you think and how you feel God can't use you but it's down in the heart a genuine desire for God a humble simple praise God recognition of God we need God in our lives and we're not ashamed of it praise God we're not ashamed to admit that we need God more and more we're not ashamed to admit that we need him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm not ashamed to admit that I need God this morning how many feel the same way this morning we need the Holy Spirit we need the power to make it in this hour oh Hallelujah see that was the wisdom of God cuz the wisdom of God is the foolishness of man and the foolishness of God is man's Wisdom isn't that right he knew they wouldn't receive such a message so the Messiah was here and it must have been someone but to recognize it now he says and now Christian F he let me ask this question With all sincerity and love he said I wonder if he would make the same act tonight and send us in this generation the promised word that's promised for this generation I wonder if our the theologians and Educators and wise would turn the message down just the same as they did then he said man doesn't change neither does God's word change he's the unchanging God he doesn't change isn't that right he said I wonder if God's doing the same thing today and he has God sent a humble little Prophet 20th century Prophet isn't that right to bring his word to 5 foot something not a very powerful man but God was with him God spoke through him every miracle was of God every word he spoke never fell to the ground every prophecy even to this day hallelujah hallelujah has never failed God isn't that right the prophet said not one word has ever fall to the ground and if God promised us the holy ghost that word cannot fall to the ground if God promised to deliver us that word cannot fall to the ground that's why we preach this word that's why we stay with this word that's why we stand with this word this word cannot fall to the ground it must come to pass in its time and in its season oh oh hallelujah hallelujah my word shall not return void but it shall accomplish isn't that right he said notice Angels coming amen Angels coming and giving their message to a man of such low estate where there were men much more Earthly thought of qualified than these poor illiterate Shepherds he said the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't know nothing but just uh about his sheep he didn't know mathematics he didn't know how to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship he just had to know about his sheep that's all that he needed to know and God the great wisdom and Fountain of resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that or persons rather and bypass all the well- trained Scholars that's trained to know that he said it speaks of one thing he said they were trained in the wrong field he said they passed up all the importance of the Land There were important people great teachers cus the high priest many other men all of Israel's Mighty learned all the denominations boasting of their theologians and so forth God bypassed every one of them he said now that's God's wisdom oh Hallelujah just think about it there are many nice people in this world there's wonderful people there's goodly people if I look around and look for nice people and think about myself in that context I wouldn't have stand a chance maybe I've made too much mistakes there's people who never spit on a sidewalk there's wonderful people people who get moral standards people who have nice families and yet God in his wisdom choose me to speak his word to God in his wisdom choose you if God is looking for nice people I might lose that contest if God is looking for goodly people I might lose that contest if God is looking for Bly people I might lose that contest but God bypass the great God bypass the mighty and God come to Humble little people oh hallelujah hallelujah that he could speak his word too oh Hal God look for Shepherds oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen amen amen amen oh isn't that right amen David was a Shepherd all David know about is keeping the Sheep his brothers was the one train for the Army his brothers was around writing quantum mechanics and trying to get their papers so they could apply for the Army and so on David wasn't in that realm David was still young in it David was a Shepherd boy playing his little hop Hallelujah but God was speaking a message to Samuel and says Samuel I have somebody I want to anoint he never tell him who he never tell him how praise God he just tell him go down and make a sacrifice and I will send you the one don't you worry I'll give you a witness I'll give you a witness of that King that is to be king over Israel Hallelujah and Samuel go down there he have no who it is he just know he have to anoint somebody so he come with his horn of oil and he's looking for a witness in the house of Jesse isn't that right he bypassed this one he bypassed that one he bypassed that one and God said don't look at the outward appearance God literally told him don't look at the outside God look tell him look at the heart God is looking at that outside appearance God looking at how big how tall how strong how how short praise God no no that has nothing to do with it but God predestined inated a little Shepherd boy to be king over Israel that was God's choosing that was according to the good pleasure of his own will in other words it give God a smile to choose David it made God smile in his heart to choose David to be king and it made God smile to choose you in 2016 it was according to the good pleasure of his will oh it made God happy to choose you because he knew you could do it oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Gideon didn't think much of himself me he start to State his case I'm the least of my brother and of the house and so forth and that's who God wanted God wanted the least because with less he could do more Hallelujah when you have all these num numbers it can't prove God it doesn't prove God's faith God had to cut down the numbers so throughout the years that what he was doing some fell upon Wayside some fell upon Stony some fell upon thorns and God was cutting down the numbers until he could get to that good ground that good ground that could show forth the Praises of his glory oh you are good ground this morning oh you're not hearing me this morning God bypass the great God bypass the intellect I look down in the heart and find good ground in our souls he found something that he could work with something that he could move with here's my spirit flowing freely God wants to flow unhindered God wants to flow unrestricted oh Hallelujah God wants to move in you praise God in a way that he's never moved before oh you are the cream of the crop this morning oh I the prophet said I'm only building I'm only laying a foundation for a short quick message that's going to shake the whole nation oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we say Amen this morning oh give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise amen amen hallelujah humble people that's right simple people that's who God Ed yes he said Peter love is thou me he said yes Lord surely you know I love you love is thou me Peter he said then feed my sheep see Prophet said always choosing Shepherds amen amen isn't that right Hallelujah my God okay let me skip on on here now uh all right hallelujah praise God you love him this morning amen isn't he wonderful okay well um amen praise God should I finish this all right I'll just go on Amen from message go tell amen said in the Bible time there was a jubilee year come he said people that were sold out to their debts that they owed they owed a debt and they couldn't pay it so they went and sold themselves to people for slaves and they had to be their slave their born slave all their life but ever so often he said there will come a day of Grace what was known as a jubilee year and when the Jubilee year was come they went a priest out and sounded a trumpet and that trumpet denoted to every slave no matter how long he had been serving or how longer he had to serve he said when that trumpet sounded that slave was made free he could lay down the hole and go home to his children he didn't have to work any longer because he was free when the Jubilee sounded he said that trumpet gave not an uncertain sound but it gave a certain sound he said and that man could lay down his instrument and go home free from slavery he said and this morning the Bible said that if the trumpets give an un certain sound who will know what to do he said and if the Bible has preached that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead he says he is the same yesterday today and forever and the trumpets that we are hearing sounded today said the days of Miracles has passed he said that's today's trumpets he says there's no such thing as Divine Healing he said who will know how to prepare themselves he said but what we need today is Anointed Messengers from God Amen Hallelujah he said that he is raised from the dead and that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said that's the message of the day he said oh there's been great messages he said but Easter C them all he said great messages praise God hallelujah he said but uh Easter was all of it he said when the dead was made preparation that The Last Enemy he seen we seen sickness healed in the Old Testament we' seen Miracles performed in the Old Testament there will Visions come in the Old Testament he said but every man went right to the Grave wondering if ever he would rise again but on Easter morning when these disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get he said what did he get go tell my disciples I am risen from the dead death has been conquered oh H go he said not only go but tell go and tell my disciples go and let my people know that I'm not dead but I am alive this morning just as I ever was we have a message from God this morning go tell my disciples I am not dead but I am alive this morning I'm here to fill you I'm here to seal you I'm here to break the chains I'm here to break the shackles stand still and see the salvation of your God this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah the greatest message on the earth oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever isn't that right he was the message he was a messiah he was a word anointed for that day isn't that right for That season and that time he said when you see me you see the father isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah and Jesus keep dropping off words to them isn't that right he said the works that I do shall you do also sing John 4 12 St John 14:20 he said on that day ye shall know I am in my father ye in me and I in you and you in me isn't that right keep dropping off words to them and they didn't know what he was talking about hallel they were messages but they didn't know he was trying to communicate with them but they didn't know all he could do was prophesy over them because their understanding was not open yet isn't that right he told them that in three days I'll raise this Temple up again and the Pharisees got confused and the Sadducees got upset because cuz they thought he was talking about the physical Temple but he was talking about his own body and they were confused oh Hallelujah and Jesus spoke in Parables and the disciples ask him why speakest thou in Parables and he says not for them to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but for you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom he said blessed are your eyes for what you see blessed are your ears for what you hear oh because you are going to understand everything that is being spoken every that is being said oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah but their Works did show that they didn't understand when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane he was praying and said not my will but thy will be done and they were sleeping in the corner isn't that right when he was arrested and tried hallelujah hallelujah before pilot they were Running Scared different ones Peter denied Christ you heard the story isn't that right Hallelujah didn't understand the message here they walk with him for three and 1/2 years but they didn't understand what he was trying to tell them they didn't know what they were going to receive they didn't know who they were all they knew as God called
