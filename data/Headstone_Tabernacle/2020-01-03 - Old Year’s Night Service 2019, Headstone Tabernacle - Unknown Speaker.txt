upon you and I have a special greeting for the members of the engine room I call them the prayer group the prayer warriors hello hello praise God praise God praise God blessed be the name Robert refer to the burden bearers well I'm sorry people who pray are the people who get a burden and the people who have the burden is the people who pray so is it goes from one you pray I get a burden you get a burden you pray amen I want to read a quote here from Bella Branham he said now to the lady to the lady we can't have a church less we got the lady amen you know the pastor can't do it all how many believe the pastor could do it all pastor can do it all amen blessed be his name it take it gotta take some members in the church now what who remembers do I leave it up to you to answer that each one of you has helped support this meeting with your finance you have supported with pray and tonight if scheduled walked out regularly and he paused he said to little women it has been hid away in these eight days of the meeting so they were having I ate their meeting and he was referring to two women who were hid away in the eight days has been fasting and praying for this meeting that's one of the reasons that it was a success that's right I trust that they're here tonight that was told to me by pretty good authority which I believe is authentic so I appreciate your sisters I appreciate you Friday night prayer warriors I appreciate you I appreciate you on behalf of the elders I said thank you the pastor cannot do it all we thank those who are supported the meetings the tabernacle here with your finance we thank you that I'm supported with your prayer because my god the pastor cannot do it all if you come looking for the pasta to do it all you are mistaken you know it was a time it has always been that way people when God first call out a church you know the first time when I BAM says the first time the church was called because the word church comes from the Greek ecclesia which means called out so Moses was the original pastor that God used to call a church out of Egypt no they were looking to Moses and when things begin to go seemingly order order there was a time they wanted to stone the pasta because they thought the pasta was responsible for what was going on but God was leading and you know we are told and we are taught that God likes to put his people in trouble so sometimes the church gets in trouble and it's not a pastor's fault is God doing that and some members when the trouble comes they run already church is the truth and they run to another church where they believe it have no trouble there but God is the one who does it they picked up they taught Moses was the one that was pausing when they see where Moses was carrying them actually but he was a pillar of fire leading he led them to a place where there was no water member they will go into a wilderness a desert area and you come to a point where there was no water and then someone had timed it got water I where they go to drink the water it was bitter water but God was leading it wasn't Moses it was a pillar of fire leading so God likes to put you in trouble someday individually he'll put you in trouble collectively he'll put you in trouble so thank God for the prayer warriors I my my my my my tongue study prayer warriors because my god the pasta cannot do it alone he has his part to play he will get the word of the Lord he will point it he will point you in a certain direction because if God shows him this is the direction to go he will point you but he can't carry you you have to realize that you gotta make the steps you gonna walk in that direction you gotta fight you gotta press you gonna when trouble comes what do you do you bend your knees you pray or cry out on to God amen so what bless you visitors god bless your head son tabernacle and especially god bless you engine room prayer warriors god bless you Jillian praise the Lord amen I'm

through in last installment of tonight's package praise God so I have a title let's go to the scripture firstly so god bless you brothers thanks so much I want to turn to three portion of Scripture real quick let me just kind of go through it a man and pray just be encouragement to you Joshua chapter 14 want to read from verse 12 and just with chapter 14 no Testament before we go over to the new and in Joshua chapter 14 wanna read from who's 12 and it says now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord speaking at thee for the horizon that be hoary anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced a man so the enemy had his things shut up and maybe he's planning maybe he's crafting right now even as we speak how to try to trap you in the future a man a man is all fence and walled up cities walled up but here's what he said now he said if so be but the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord had said and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance hair bran therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the kena's eye on to this day because they wholly followed the long code of Israel and the name of hebron before was could could harbour which arbor was a great man among the Anakin's and the land had rest from war amen any man I'll turn it over to Ephesians chapter one [Music] verse three amen Ephesians 1 and verse 3 and we find the book of Romans afterwards the key so if you use one from verse 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according up he as as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded to us toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him look at all things after the counsel of his own will amen and now turning lastly over to Romans chapter 8 and we want to read a couple scriptures in there Romans it going down to verse 35 it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter me and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord may God bless him to the ring of his word let's bar it one more time Heavenly Father we've read your word Lord we print out your presence come down for a few moments once more as we share the word and share some inspiration tonight Lord to encourage our hearts towards faith Lord that you would anoint us now Lord Lord anoint your wood father launch a people Lord father Lord and speak to our hearts Lord father God what we need to hear

chop up praise God hallelujah oh come on now so I hear the priest eight sake for your souls sake for a rapture fate for the Holy Ghost and chase fell to your system hallelujah praise calling man oh

well hallelujah one more time I'm getting rid of clothes mrs. musicians to get ready Samson can't help but think about something right now Samson lost his eyes sometimes when a pitiful condition Samson look terrible you'd have felt sorry for Samson if he was living in his day because he was a mighty man in his time but this wasn't that time now now he was betrayed and how he was piqued forgotten he was almost forsaken holidays now arrived in a terrible condition Samson an almighty remembered his glory days how he lifts up the gates of Gaza and pack them up on a hill such was the glory of God upon Samson and Samson was up wasn't a big Hulk fellow he was not man in big muscles he was like a TBT fellow who looked like everybody else but when the spirit of the law come upon Samson with his seven locks with the Covenant that he kept he could do great things he could move mountains halal is not right he could beat the Philistines runnin with the jawbone of an ass he was powerful when he was in the hands of God isn't that right but he mess around and gotten the wrong crowd and ended up messed up ended up looking forsaken had his head shaven challah is not right but I believe Samson remember the Covenant because sometimes waiting for a specific time for him to make his move he was in that prison but he knew that did that they stood there was a chance there was an opportunity and when he put his hair back and he felt those locks growing back he knew that there is a possibility there's a possibility for change there's a possibility for Carter to once more what he did before one smaller quarter to it once more a quarter fill a cottage seal that God to deliver that God to restore the clock at backlash nakaka change I gotta rearrange that got to raise up for such a time as this once more Lord hallelujah the devil to Delilah was planning for Samson I went to devil God Samson it seemed like it never stopped his planet but Samson's got to plan know how he was gonna get back at the enemy how he was gonna avenge the enemy for all I took place in his life Samson hallelujah and know exactly what he was going to do what he was waiting waiting for those locks to grow back with it boys covenant to be restored and tonight you might be fallen you might be shaven you might see long cheap misshapen and bent up but tonight holiday holiday here's my resolve

that seed will not rush it will not be satisfied until it is filled with all of the goodness of God until I've seen us quenched with the waters of life of God oh it's trying out it's pressing ouch
