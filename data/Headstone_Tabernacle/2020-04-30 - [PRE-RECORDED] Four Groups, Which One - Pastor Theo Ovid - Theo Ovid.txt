to be here it's good to be back among you all I've been greedy asam Argentina and what a time and I know but Isaac and Ghana had a tremendous time also when it's time come he would share with you but we had a real tremendous time in Argentina I want to thank on Antony I didn't get to get a message for the last Sunday service true seed of the world last Sunday and I thought you were really blessed inspiration the Lord look upon the heart and in Argentina I have no words and the testimonies were so very encouraging just want to read maybe just two for you but it's you I want to give you my personal testimony of the meetings in Argentina I hope this message of my brother last night I could hardly sleep because I was meditating on the messages that Holy Spirit brought this weekend and certainly what is mature we have received power in our souls our understanding was open to see the world in the present tense and God wants us to take us deeper into revelation but God has placed in my heart that we should give the importance to life and the right spirit I my brother met the Lord and I will never be the same I believe it out a doubt that your ministry will be powerfully occupied in this last ride the Holy Spirit has focused me to stand firm in the world in these meetings we can see a channel flowing free of anointed and Commission interpretation I encourage you to move forward looking only to Jesus we must give the true importance to our Lord Jesus Christ I appreciate you much of a servant of Christ for the building of us as Hispanics I think I will see you very soon I'll be praying for ministry you're farming at church but Joshua from Chile [Music] and I get this testimony to speak here and such as money without standing one of the Deacons that were standing by when you walk up to the pulpit on the last message he said as you pass by the presence of the Lord came upon him and his knees started to shake he was asking the Lord what was done but after the service he can't stop with disinterred people he has already won five souls for the kingdom all praise the Lord amen amen [Music] well this morning we have a tip we like to put on before but before that I wanna have a time of Prayer a small time of Prayer I felt that we after Friday permitting and all the time but a Stephen for hung in India for the permitting services were blessed even as a real tremendous time Friday we had a tremendous time in the Lord I was back on Tuesday but we are there for Friday permitting but this description red is for music a chapter 9 and Daniel I was understood by books in number of years where of the word of the Lord you see if you don't take time off to there's a echo up here if you don't take time off to go into the world to look at what is happening now you miss the whole thing you live in a normal like eating drinking going to work come back home like if nothing happening this day what not to take you on our ways we spoke a message the day of the Lord everything God gives you and released into your life it's a civil matter let me say that game everything that God has given you and released into your life is receiving better not to get food away from God but to get closer to God every single thing your husband your wife your children your family your job your money your car whatever it is God give you is to get closer to him [Music] the devil job is to get you further from God because the devil don't want you to come to perfection because a devil knew his time is short so you're going on more like a roaring lion seeking it to get you trapped in the churchianity because I got break material like church spirit and you have to come and fight that and look to God look to the angel looked at the Spirit of God looked at the power of God look at you meeting God looking for your personal picture coming together burden Alleluia and the problem if people don't have a burden I put in for service I've been for the things I've drawn a win for the revival you have to get the burden I set my face on the Lord to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and support and ashes and I pray them that Lord my God and made my confession and said O Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the covenant and mercy to them there's only had a Priam these are things yet to show you how to pray how to pray not just bring your own take Lord God and thing and you just go in your own Mary we because you praying that for 50 years or for 20 years you see we will pray and not it you know you have to switch be put in because God

hello all glory to God I'm gonna continue your Lord righteousness belonging to Z but unto us confusion of faces as of this day to the men of Judah heart of Jerusalem and and all Israel that are near that are far off to all the countries where that I was driven them because the ax trespass they have trespass against don't trespass against God to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness do do we have rebelled against him neither havi obey the voice of the Lord our God to walk in his laws which he set before us my servant the prophets ye all Israel have transgressed thy law even by the pattern that they might not obey thy voice therefore the crease is spotted upon us and the odor that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him he had confirm his words but he speak against us and against our judges that judges by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole of them had not been done as I've been done upon Jerusalem as written in the law of Moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God that we might turn from iniquities and understand that truth dear for the Lord watched upon the evil brought it upon us for the Lord what is righteous in all his works which he won't do it for your business voice and now O Lord our God that was brought by people for out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and cutting be renowned as of this day we have sinned we have done wickedly Oh Lord according to all I righteousness I beseech thee let her hunger and I theory we turn away from thy city Jerusalem by holy mountain because of our sins and for the iniquities of fathers Jerusalem my people are become a reproach to all that about us now therefore O Lord God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplication oh my oh go my god incline thine ear in here opening I shall be whole our desolations on the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies O Lord here oh lord forgive Oh Lord hacklin Duke defer not for their own sake o my god for the city and I people have a called by my name and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my god yeah while I was speaking in prayer even a man Gabriel whom had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about a time of the evil ablation and inform me and talk of me say no Daniel I am not come forth to give this skill and understanding at the beginning of ice application the commandment came forth and I have come to show D for the word greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision or praising him the Lord after Daniel had that Buettner prayer o my the Spirit came upon Daniel praise God to speak to Daniel to reveal things to Daniel you have to get into that spirit of Prayer you must want that spirit of prayer amen the tip that we have isn't long but I want to have a time a prayer a small time a prayer I just wanted you to connect the body I believe to connect with what happened on Friday night because something took place on Friday night oh praise listen Oliver Graham says and remember at that great day of judgment your prayers will be counted just as much in that revival as my efforts would be double bring them there are people like free things everything free long-standing church maybe I wanted free free things yeah kind of recourse Jesus a revival cost there's a price for breakthrough there's a price victory that is why character is not a gift it's a victory it's not for free so don't come for look for no free ride don't look for anybody else to make the effort and you wait in the ride and jump in the anointing but you're praying you're not seeking God then that is why you won't be able to take a bit you in you know the Old Testament on the law when you pass through a cornfield you can pick off the corn is not your field if you're hungry you can pick and there's no sin to that not the Court opinion larceny but I said fronting when the revivals begin to break out if you didn't put in you can't get a notional oh you mean daddy issue with the foolish virgins that's right they didn't take the enough will to turn the spirit to be the extra oil in them because the world is spirit and life and the extra oil is what the rise virgin have received and when that word kernels are you the fluent really could never get it because they

steal you gave me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked you clothed me not sick and in prison you visited me not then shall this uncertainty Lord when saw we thee an hungred and tasted strange and naked sick when prison did not minister the deed then shadi answered saying very nice unto you in as much as you did it not to one of these least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous under life script final scripture revolution chapter 13 verse 8 and all dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord I really wish I wishes on a Sunday I don't know why I'm purchase tonight but this is really like a Sunday message this is heavy but with but Branagh so this is a title for groups which one to be really identifying for groups so I want you to coffee huge masks you're not in headstone double angle take out your message mask yeah no no message your believer take up holy religious mastic take it off and just come and see what it would say tonight and receive what it would see tonight so it's not groups it's not it's not churches there's not any message and I believe what a brand know is not that is what God said in this hour Jana remember the kingdom of heaven is like none to these virgins five were wise five were foolish which group you in the wise God oil the foolish did not get oil what group you in what group you want to be because some point in time somebody had again people are get desperate you must want to know that they line up with the scriptures the people I just say what side you're on what good hook you in what church you in this is not this is different a bit different he said you know if we live in the end time is the age that the churches are going to come together and as even now on trollin wool things they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the World Organization of Churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you would lose all now these are weighted words tonight he said you would lose all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the final men of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft there will be presented to them a great temptation to give him preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist be system they will give into the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy but the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment Day there will be found naked they will not be given microbes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in spotted garments of the world holding their hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up and hear the voice of God crying come on tambour organisation religion and my people that you be not partakers of her sins God is speaking son the religions of this world like a Sunday plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance and the better than do it no for tomorrow might be too late Oh glory to God he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of the book of life hallelujah let's continue the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those born again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of the rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed is on-the-record will simply be blank as it was before an email be placed there this is 100% opposite to what the world actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world I feel pointed out shortly it's not a question of simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had the opportunity to receive it in a life where when one group received it and had their names placed on record and the others who refused it didn't have their names replaced we will actually show by scripture that multi-tools were not even born again we'll go into it in a life aha that's a big one multitudes will go on that are not even born again and get eternal life or is a big thing tonight this is not screamer tonight right we will also show that there's a group of people whose name haven't been placed on that record before the phone in the world cannot under any circumstances have those name removed and we will also show that another group who stays on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed to begin with there's no basis for the claim that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ book of life or even died book or the book of the living Unni names are written on it and the scripture he says quote revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 20:12 215 I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books are open and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead would out of those things which are written in the books according to their works under sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and hell but delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death many people don't even know there's a second death the first that is easy but every man that has died will be resurrected to be judged Oh hallelujah oh yeah tango tonight for the blood you can't go out for Jesus pin and accept him your judgment and my judgment and take upon himself dying on the cross that we could go three tonight that's why you should worship Him that's why you should give them praise that's why you should never come in the house of God with herself with the throng with any bad attitude or glory to God hallelujah you can see that door there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book container names it has caused the lamb Book of Life or the book of life then where is this book located scripture Luke's 1017 to 2400 centimeters with joy sin Lord even the Devils are subject unto us should I name he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding and this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your name are written in heaven or glory the Gordon that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that I was hid these things from the wise and the prudent and as we read them unto babes such as well hallelujah even so father it seemed good in thy sight or did the Lord a shout hallelujah so this book of life is located in heaven and will appear the white throne judgment in these verses Jesus said the names were written in heaven they were written in the book don't rejoice because Devils have taken to you but rejoice because your name is in heaven that's right if you know your name is in heaven if you know your name is written every service should be rejoicing just to have the opportunity do not worship in the beasts you're not worshiping some false prophet you're not worship in this world system or give the Lord a shout no wonder he said bring them seven thunders come forth then you'll be worshiping the Living Christ moving in and out among us but are we are fighting for every promise that God promised in this hour Oh glory to God amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God praise God now notice hallelujah Judas was one of those who were cast no Devils in Jesus name and we know that he was a devil son of perdition and Jesus said he that watcheth need not wash his feet but is clean every whit but you are crema not all but he knew who would betray him therefore he said you're not all clean I speak not of you all I know whom I am chosen under study scripture may be fulfilled these are eat that bread with me have lifted up his heel heel against me now if language means anything we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet he was not clean Oh glory to God hallelujah Judas was also given to Jesus by the father hallelujah notice that given is the exact parallel as the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau due east on Pharaoh Abbas for known they were predestinated a rat portable repres hallelujah and elect even to them that stumble at the word being disobedient Judas was numbered with the twelve and actually had a pact with them in the ministry previous the Pentecost or glory to God so those faithful ministry fight to being a bride come on give the Lord a show get the Lord our show this everybody should be caught up about that the faithful ministry fight to be part of this bride because we're the Ancient of Days haul them posters 10,000 tasty bride or glory the garden with the demon or get the lash out Jesus on his prey or glory that God let's continue my ox 117 men on bridge in the script Emma's needy fulfill wish the Holy One by the most of the image speak and he was numbered with us and obtained part of this ministry the part that Judas obtained among the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the Ministry of the other level no was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected among the ministry of the others so he was anointed and commissioned or get the Lord I shall do you feel like moving on tonight that he may take part in this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place Judas had ever lost a god-given Holy Ghost ministry and kill themselves and went his own place his name was even in the book of life his name was blotted out there are four groups or glory the Claudia has to be identified with one you have to be connected with one there's a word pride that is wise version or glory recordings of foolish versions such an resurrection for that there are the people that are good that will get eaten alive at the white throne judgment or poetic or and there are those names who was never in the book okay the Lord a shout or glory dog Claude you have to belong to one all glory they're gonna miss your name is on that book he an opportunity yes even left to put it in tonight that name was put there I will give the Lord a shout before the foundation of the world before you had a problem before a condition before your felon soon before you fail he put remember you have a right to shout right to sing praise your God hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah hallelujah the see give up their dead I saw the dead small and great stand before God think about it now my you unholy gongs tonight you are privileged tonight all them people who never stand a chance some of them gone some of them wish they could reboot and kick and get out the hell and take a seat in church to say give me one more chance just one more chance give me another chance there is no other chance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just continue there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment these righteous will not be the bride for the bride sit with him and judgment stop rewind but over the mean the brine will be part of the judgment yes he have a script a faith first corinthians 6:2 two and three do you know the scenes adjust the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that you shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life not a scriptorium 3:21 that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame an Isetta what my father his strong see the bride is written and in strong and she is to judge the world she wants to be sitting in judgment that's what Daniel saw Oh glory to God hallelujah and he caught descriptive II read I beheld until the truth were tossed down and the engines of these did sit whose garment was white as snow Oh glory to God hallelujah so you're a big statement to make now only the bride alone qualifies for the first resurrection all glory to God bless her that day that comfort in the first resurrection only the bride or the bride elect that is going on in the ground they come in in the first resurrection everybody has after wait for the second resurrection but there's to be a let the bride coming forth in the first resurrection all glory to God on you them that I sleep or guilt alors - oh he's never excitin tonight isn't that exciting tonight there is going to be a resurrection Oh God Lord I want to be in that number when the saints go marching him or get a lot of shout when the saints go marching him hallelujah hallelujah let's continue the question arises why are these righteous ones in judgment there is no other place they can come in for they are not - they are just about to resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come in the second resurrection unto judgment so the second resurrection is a resurrection of the judgment not the first one because the bride already judged and Christ Jesus the bride will not be judged the bride cannot be judge she will be with the judge okay the Lord a shout the bride is justified did you hear that the bride is justified as if she never did it in the first place [Applause] hallelujah today my stomach missile resurrection the ones who qualify for the first resurrection is the bride and I'm not in judgment and he could have scripted for at the back adoption John 5:24 verily unto you he that heareth my voice that believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life which is I believe a recipient of eternal life he is a possession of it right now and shall not come into judgment hallelujah but inspired from death unto life so Jesus must have yet another in mind a certain resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at that resurrection not having previously as a member of the bride and to prove that he ever scripture for that John 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is coming this is Jesus in which all data in the graves shall hear his voice all all and shall come forth neither have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation but all could hear that voice and to thankful to God tonight that you hearing the voice of God in the last days or glory of God you hear in his voice no you hear in the wood of the Spirit no God speaking to you know because the electrons the ability to hear direct from God give the Lord a show [Applause] you as he left have the ability from God or glory to God you are hearing from God tonight because God is the word and if you hear the word and receive the word you came from God that's the ability that God put in the lick hallelujah we all know that John 5:22 29 is not the rapture I just hope you just read for only the dead in Christ shall arise on the graves at the time along with the Living bride who still sits on the earth let's see back the scripture we just read Marvel not that this for the always come in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come for dinner of good or the resolution of life till have done evil unto the resident damnation that nothing rapture does not e rupture the rupture is 1st Thessalonians 4 for the Lord himself shall sing for me with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air or get the Lord a shock hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah let me get a lot of shots again because you wanna be caught up to meet them you have one of these change in a moment in a pickle and I I believe that I'm gonna preach that oh praise God praise God hallelujah you may be seated we now face the question as to why this should be given eternal life at the judgement since the epistles seen the conclusively point out that one must possess the Spirit of Christ or perish though it seemed us we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general direction or after it Paul does not evade this truth for he clearly says in Philippians tree-level if by any means I might attain the resurrection of the dead now this statement is very peculiar we all know and we are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so Paul could hardly be seen is by any means I might attain a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he's not seeing that the literal realness if by any means I might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the opinion to the general or self second resurrection but attending to the first resurrection and which he said blessed and holy is he who are passing the first resurrection on such the second death no power or glory to God hallelujah praise God don't you feel inspired tonight all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God let's continue he said no but they should I be like priests of God and Christ shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of a thousand years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death no we do not need to guess about those who are in the second resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the ground that they are being kind and good to the Brethren this is something worthwhile noting a long time I've heard this but this is some type something with Van Noten we are told it is given to them underground they are being kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast a lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the bredrin or test the Lord I show which group are you in which people because some everybody's gonna be in a group everybody give the Lord a shock if you never heard that before you're having it now Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah since this is the will of the Lord we simply accepted there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact we read the scripture when Jesus fasted eternal life he said when I was hungry you feed me when I was naked you clothed me and they say but when we do that he said when you do they literally Lisa them you Jesus turned to me Oh hallelujah all glory to God hallelujah praise God the rest was the direct opposite let's continue the further clarify notice specifically go on alike that porn the words in Matthew 25:31 to 46 which is what we read it does not see that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time why turn judgment the sheep are already in his fold they heard his voice they followed him they already have eternal life and he are not come into judgment but these do not have it in life they are in judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds to the enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have this life as does the bride but they receive it because it was time to his brethren they are not his brethren that will make them join us with Jesus they are not asked anything but life they share note role except over him their names must have been in the book of life are not removed but because of the love of the people of God they are recognized and saved oh man should know you know who you are I know you know people gonna treat you based upon who you are I will be saved and receive eternal life because of who you are okay the Lord a shout if the dead know who you are you better know who you are tonight Oh glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ okay the Lord show scallywags in us somewhere he put your name on the book he said mark I thought to call you out let's continue cause of their love of the people of God they are recognized and save no doubt these save that help the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in a time of trouble it's this seem smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked and not restored but turn into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed within the book of rice also but they were blotted out because they fail to honor the people of God who are the Living manifested word living epistle for their day oh you mean the bride could be the living manifested for this day your meal is not walking wrong with the book enough tape and say what you believe but it has to be the winner in the individual voices I believe that you know or you had except the other group if you don't want to accept that you have to become the Word made flesh then you have to find the next group you never said I know my group keeps spinning and see if you find a group it's only for it not 24 you know just for so you could pick which one that's what they want know what type L so which one now let's be clear here these are not Nations being judged and going to the Millennium because they have harbored and at the Jews this is very clear because of the conclusion of these verses that these do mintage shall go into everlasting punishment but the righteous into everlasting life there is no record of two judgments set where the wicked a cast on a lake of fire only the beast and the false prophet at the judge at the end of the Great Tribulation this is the white throne judgment and they are judged according to what is written in the book in the second recollection that's the souls under the altar that's in the fifth seal them coming second resurrection the carbonyl or voice how long Lord how long does not judge and avenge our blood these Jews under this altar we know that note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of Jesus they were not like Antipas who was slain for holiness fascist name these are not born again one but it's in life as a possession they come in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word notice how these are crying for vengeance they cannot be bright material that speaks volume nail them Jewish Canon for vengeance he said dynamite material so any person in this message sign of a vengeance you know we're on it you know accordion right then not in this bright group because the bride don't call for vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repair the break your contract the bride will turn the other cheek give the Lord a show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the bright the bright turn-the-other-cheek they have to because they are they have to watch so these Jews and born of the Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is Messiah but they were blinded by God for the Gentiles seek God give them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him they were truly faithful to all the word the new and died under Stalin and Hitler and yet they will die it is the second resurrection where in the five foolish virgins to come up oh my goodness this five foolish virgins Immunization they not denomination let's continue they they did not have the Holy Spirit so they miss been in the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being separated God loving people trying to abide in the world according to what they knew of it and I help in the work of the Lord will come at the end of time they will miss the Millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is more important and wonderful than we ever thought or belief though that you hear at this all I want to miss it that come like have a big banquet downstairs and you go home to drink water and Dom says have all seven course menu layout here and you go in to drink water tribulation and water and a thesis there it have a wedding supper yellow animal in am honeymoon this is more wonderful he said then we could think I imagine you don't want to miss it which group pool in there or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid hallelujah glory to God you could imagine know when you hit that scripture his wife a bit as already when you come into the church nobody could touch you no more because you know atmosphere all by yourself because you know who your husband is you know who you worship your know by your worship oh my let's continue Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all these people are their names in the book of life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be tools whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire so let's go to another step he said let's review our case thus far let's review these four groups one first of all we know assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purpose in himself it was God's purpose to prefer top people icon themselves that would be a would bright so that break I'm missing for nothing because God purpose it that is God intent to have a good bright no Bishop could stop it no country could stop it no Prime Minister no president no message poor poor Roman Pope it's not bought hallelujah not only puts any message or alter the message could stop this would mad from coming forth no force anointed no I'm anointed we are not dead preacher no reliant preacher nothing gonna stop this bride oh I feel good tonight God's war he's far by himself Simon Thomas trottle voices oh go get that bride going to break the silence over your life like he broke the silence off the Seventh Seal Oh glory to God amen let's continue hallelujah she was chosen this bride before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth to many ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into control all day here just know if I continue so I will cast a problem I won't let her continue preaching this thing this thing's sweet tonight did you hear what he just said here did you hear that okay the Lord a shout he's an ear let him hear what the Spirit is speaking tonight he said she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her dancin hallelujah scripture for that romans for it blessed is the man to whom god the lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judge in the world and even angels her name each other members was written in the such other Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's group number one that's you that's the word pride chosen and him before the song is the world before your smoke your first cigarette before your tell you first life before you commit adultery and fornication before your backside life or get the Lord a show that's why I found you just like it find you're not bad in a rum shop anybody could find you pick you up prostitute living before most man and whatnot that you wouldn't see any see don't wanna be wealthy he passing some area he know her name is on the book he had to call she out and Annie Frank huh he sent his disciples away I'm waiting for that woman Oh Bobby she I even know she is being waited on oh yeah glory to God you talk about the voice of God the last days there are people with Gloria caught the voice of clothes with the role once more I read from God God will speak God is speaking has spoken hallelujah hallelujah I feel her going free tonight I feel I see a higher kryptonite I see a see higher order tonight Oh glory to God there are those whose names are in the book at all that's not you get the Laura show that's why we could rejoice o halle-loo let's continue Oh God hallelujah halleluyah halleluyah that's the group you want to be identified in that's the coop you wanna be part of that's gonna have your Shoten well as though and the money together and the sons of God destroy that's that group that's for sure hallelujah gonna be ceases hallelujah let's look at his second group another class their names were also a lot of life but they will come up in the second resurrection such as the foolish virgins and the righteous are spoken much 25 in this class those who do not worship the beasts or become involve an antichrist system but die for their faith even though they're not not in the bride Oh hallelujah Oh God having been born again they will come in the system Resurrection unto eternal life thirdly there are the borderline Christians such that we saw Israel's covenant Egypt these had their names in the book of life and their works written in the books these haven't field to obey God being void of the Spirit - even the signs and wonders among them will have their names removed from the book of life amongst that group you'll find us entirely void of the Spirit religious will have manifestation in their lives although the books were not elected in him such as Balaam will be in that group and the fourth will be finally boys whose things have never been or never will ever be written in the book or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah all glory to God thank you Jesus hallelujah all my let's hit the home stretch now you did very well I'm amazed how we get you here Oh glory to God you can imagine pretty centers without the anointing hold dry and like Crick's biscuit you have to take it on try and put some water behind it but when the Shekinah is upon this wall but this will just come alive so smooth it will take a teacher for hours to preach what we appreciate about 45 minutes I'm telling you with audio 910 [Music] hallelujah hallelujah we will perish without this anointing can make the anointing make the difference The Anointed Prince the yoke the Spirit is just a big revelation for you which group hallelujah hallelujah so all the more awesome grudges will keep missing there hallelujah praise God God forgive them and didn't want to forgive nobody wish swing your group as God said if you cannot forgive neither will I forgive you or glory they go Daniel choose I'm going on that group well get the Lord a shout but the brag will be like Jesus when he was on the cross as a father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they know not what they do that's the bride okay the Lord I shoot because faith is based on forgiveness [Applause] somebody must be wrong hallelujah mama she said hallelujah but the bride could handle wrong because your ones wrong to say somebody wrong you you could forgive them I don't care what they do to you you have to forgive them if you are prophetess bride you have to be able to say I forgive you or to the Lord I soak them let it go let it go let it go [Applause] it's either people over there oh but they are not being tested you are [Applause] touches my Madonna may be season they

not but Jesus well you could do that not you real Jesus that I my name by Jesus Oh hallelujah maybe by Jesus mother Jesus Oh hallelujah praise God so his spirit let's continue let's come to this is took two good hallelujah yes a little more since this portion of the word is hard for the human migrants or this profit is good oh my goodness is this this is good it must be accepted and believed by feet somewhere be offended by what I have set forth because they fail to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is God and because he is God one cannot defeat his concerts or thwart his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all affairs and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore Paul said if God to take one lump of clay and make that seem love one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonour who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny he hath he went even further according to Roman's 14 sin 9 we have the irrefutable proof that Jesus paid the purchase price of the whole world therefore you can do as you will with his own and none of us liveth to himself Norman died himself but whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's okay the Lord I show you are being purchased you have been bought with a price do you get that tonight you are not your own keep a feel listen listen when the angel crowd who is worthy who is worthy and no man was from worthy and the lamb stood for bloody bleeding he said I died for them I come for a book I pay the price I come to bring back this inheritance from yet from my wife all glory of God you turn like a show tonight I grab restaurant tonight I can't worship tonight when the lamb took the book no wonder John say all in heaven Oh glory to God hallelujah we have enough crazy when I saw this tonight [Applause] somebody about it is that this end Christ both died and rose and revived but he might be the Lord pour out the dead and the living yes yes revolution here he said ownership not relationship is meant yet he is Lord over the river and the dead not relationship relationship with his bride but honest over all that's why when he speak every man-jack coming up all go be raised from the dead to be judged what poopa you will be in hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost done the quote Ephesians that's in the dispensation of the fullness of times he by karateka in one all things in Christ both which and have done even him in whom we are obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will thus if God so designed that there are those whose names are pleased in the section of the book of life that cannot be raised for the other names of his bride then we must accept it also states that there are those who names are placed in the record but in the foreknowledge of God they would have fail and have those name removed we must accept that and if there are those who name up there was those whole names was never placed on the record of life we must accept that also Oh Harlan or glory to God my God my God let's continue to understand this subject raise a cup of it even more clearly it will be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages remember some time us talk about conversion and people don't want to convert and the jesting and things are literally if they go to Mexico you can't use $30 yeah they converted to pieces so if you want to build the house the materials called building materials but around call them virtues building materials if you want to go into the King's presence they become steps you're not building materials one with the king you have seven steps to go up to the King because he's only seven step isn't that right if you want to see to the edges you need eyes so all of a sudden you have seven eyes and you want to see edges here one seven horns so is the currency of the conversion to what effect that you want now you can't preach spirit to preach the world and they would tell in the spirit know there are three Bibles the zodiac this physical Bible in the pyramid but you're capricious area you can't preach pyramid but you can preach the word and if this would come into you you have the pyramid you you have to buy all glory love God so brother Branham taking the book of life now and we bring in a different reference on a point to bring clarity for all what I've said of these four groups already just a little more again another finish let's go that's watch here what you see now to understand this now we want to consider not even Fisher now but the groups represented in the church to do this we would like the church to the ages Tobit plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce by itself to a certain process and during a certain period of time that single seed will die and in time the light that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or they carry of that life which is to come back to originality and multi-platform Jesus the great royal seed died the massless one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the Church of all seventy ages given his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end that this very life will be repetition bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seal will see many royal sees that come to himself so this is not already it the real glory will be ready at the resurrection where we shall see him like he is and we shall be like him okay the Lord I show this miserable fresh body I like him but in that resurrection we are going to be like this mortality this corruption put on interruption and be a change or glorious God let's continue we shall be like him no that is what John the Baptist was referring to that Jesus will gather the wheat into his gonna that was the resurrection where the redeemed who had been elected into life came in know the record of this wheat plant here we go whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplatform is the book of life so he is confessing it the holy plant he generated it is the book of life are you with me I repeat the history all record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a path of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is unflinchingly seen by examining the wheat plant a seed is sown so when I play this scene that is not to beat yet it grows into a stalk that is not a week yet life is there but not to reach then at the end of the store is a little spike that's another tassel still are we plant but no bit yet then the plant is Paula nice we see the child grow it looks mighty and the wheat but has not yet seed then forms a wheat in the husk it is now back to what is all originally know the ripen wheat is harvested Jesus died almost finish to bear with me and anybody sleeping just gave a big shock there's just no sleeping right now we're almost done alright so Jesus Christ died you give his life that life was to come back upon the church here we go and bring many sons like unto himself unto the glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed have to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied with seed even so there had to be a church which would be a carrier of the life of Christ the blade stock tassel husk were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church cooperate truly ages have been a carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say the book of life is the whole wheat plant or give the Lord a shout do you catch it tonight let's go over it again here is the original seed that was planted it produces a bleed that wasn't it if it is a store not at either he had come husk we to form the tassel appears then the pollen falls on something on those Pistons part of that plant is quickened something of the original seed came to the rest of the plant turns in the seed why didn't the whole pan go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because that part of the wheat grant is eternal life wheat [Applause] do you see it all the other processes carriers but that part come back to eat is the original grain that's the bad old glory to God he sent the prophet amos back original faith the original seed the original life all let's finish off here now well glory to God he said you have a perfect type Israel even Egypt the chemo 2 million strong all escaped the sacrificial blood or a baptized on the Red Sea all came out of the water and join holy spirit manifestations all angel food all drunk of the rock yeah except for few they were not but tires all Israel is not Israel all but a tiny minority and their names are blotted out of the book of life we have the same thing right in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names every blood another book of the eternal life for that is another record that contained in the book this is the record God had given us eternal life and that life is in his son he had hacked the Sun had the life oh my breaking he could come oh my you're being a tremendous audience tonight you applaud my mind I thought this might be too much for tonight but praise God praise God praise God hallelujah in concluding in concluding this for this time let me further statement that are merely beginning when I said that not one scripture spoke the Lord presently compiled in a record of names that is indeed so Oh

Jerry's voice or glory the shot about Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God amen oh my mind mind mind the rapture is not the only world called there's a second resurrection of the white tone judgment will names the confessed before the fallen angels and I've been told by those who know that the sweetest song to a human ear it's a song of that pieces name how people love to have their names before the public how they love a clean but no earthly voice will ever song your name as sweetly as well the voice of God if your name is in the book of life and remains there to be revealed before his holy angels what a day that will be when we are Jesus a father they confess my name before men in the days of the earthly pilgrimage no I will confess their name before thee and all the heavenly angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches once more the Spirit has spoken once again we have reviewed a record of what the Spirit set another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by it must fulfill exactly as he said it would be what a consolation that is to us who hope to be in the last debride for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform every promise if he was faithful and true the doors in his audition age then he will be just as true in our age if they're by His grace and power will receive the commandment
