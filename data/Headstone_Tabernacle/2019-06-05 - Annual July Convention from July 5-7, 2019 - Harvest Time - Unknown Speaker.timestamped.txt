[0:00] and he said so is the kingdom of God as
[0:04] if a man should cast seed into the
[0:07] ground and should sleep and rise night
[0:10] and day and the seed should spring and
[0:13] grow up he knoweth not how for the earth
[0:16] bringeth forth fruit of herself first
[0:18] the blade then a year after that the
[0:21] full corn in the ear but when the fruit
[0:24] is brought forth immediately he put it
[0:26] in the sickle because the harvest has
[0:28] come
[0:31] [Music]
[0:50] therefore said he unto them the harvest
[0:53] truly is great but the laborers are few
[0:55] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[0:57] harvest that he would send forth
[0:58] laborers into his harvest at the harvest
[1:04] time
[1:05] the seed is back to its visual condition
[1:07] and must have all all the word in order
[1:11] to be the seed I can't have a half a
[1:15] seat it will grow hmm
[1:17] it's got to be the hold see if Skott do
[1:20] not manifest say I think the Baptist
[1:22] knows how do I be speaking don't that's
[1:24] just part of the sea but now added to
[1:28] that not the gifts alive all the gifts
[1:38] see what I mean we're at the in time
[1:41] brother
[1:42] and God has never left his stuff on the
[1:47] earth without a witness that is always
[1:50] somewhere someplace had a person that he
[1:55] could put his hands on and would stand
[1:58] for wouldn't so if he's good that
[2:01] bearing since Genesis the beginning
[2:04] surely somewhere God has a man that he
[2:08] made him now bark
[2:11] he's more than one man now he has many
[2:16] names that he can lay his hand on
[2:18] because we are coming down to the
[2:21] gathering time the harvest
[2:24] [Music]
[2:48] they've been talking so much about
[2:50] mattering not just guarding you
[2:52] lettering brother but that's not ladder
[2:54] a new ladder a would have been yours a
[2:58] hopper garish stuff that thing you
[3:00] should trip to learn the latter rain fix
[3:03] in the Casa what's the matter
[3:05] the church has manufactured herself
[3:08] something just like he tried to do she
[3:10] tried to add more life to manufacture
[3:12] something we've done the same thing time
[3:15] to make something in herself keep your
[3:17] hands off of that stops do it take his
[3:20] word and believe it all right in your
[3:22] heart and when the rain against the fall
[3:24] life will take home and the word will
[3:26] manifest itself
[3:35] [Music]
[3:48] [Music]
[3:53] you
[3:54] [Music]
