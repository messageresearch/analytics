[14:18] you to turn to Revelation Chapter
[14:21] 2 we want to read from verse 1 to
[14:24] 5 Revelation chapter 2
[14:30] verse 1 to
[14:34] five take each service take each prayer
[14:39] session as something that is of between
[14:41] life and death is so important to get a
[14:44] hold upon what God is saying what God is
[14:46] speaking what God is revealing what God
[14:48] is unfolding Revelation chapter 2 verse
[14:52] one unto the angel of the Church of
[14:54] Ephesus WR these things sayith he that
[14:57] hold of the Seven Stars in his right
[14:58] hand who walth in the midst of the seven
[15:01] golden CS I Know Thy works and thy labor
[15:05] and thy patience oh th can not bear them
[15:08] which are evil and H has tried them
[15:11] which say the apostles and are not has
[15:13] found them Li and has born and has
[15:17] patient and for my name's sake has
[15:20] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[15:23] I have somewhat against thee because
[15:26] thou has left thy first love
[15:29] remember therefore from when thou art
[15:31] fallen and repent and do thy do the
[15:34] first works or else I will come un thee
[15:37] quickly and will remove thy candlesticks
[15:40] out of his place except I Repent may God
[15:43] bless his word praise the Lord I have
[15:47] something that have been placed upon my
[15:50] heart and the title of it is
[15:54] remember from whence Thou Art
[15:57] fallen and
[15:59] repent that is what I have for to share
[16:02] with you tonight remember from whence
[16:05] thou had
[16:06] fallen and repent you know it's is an
[16:11] uncomfortable
[16:13] thing
[16:15] when to hear we are falling short of
[16:19] God's plan or God's program it's not
[16:22] that easy to present this
[16:26] uncomfortable part of the Gospel but
[16:29] this is just what we have here tonight
[16:32] and many times when we are confronted
[16:35] with
[16:36] ourselves that the man with the
[16:39] individual with you we tend to be
[16:42] defensive or we tend to try to
[16:45] justify why we are how we are but
[16:50] tonight I want you to put down all those
[16:53] defense
[16:55] stuff and all that self-justification
[16:58] tough and take the word for what it is
[17:02] the wages of sin is still
[17:05] dead God is not afraid to kill
[17:09] people God give mercy God give Grace as
[17:12] we said I believe it was Wednesday two
[17:15] million people came out of Egypt but God
[17:17] only saw two going in the rest died and
[17:21] not just died physically but died
[17:24] spiritually the wages of sin is still
[17:27] dead people dying
[17:29] in church people dying in the pews so we
[17:32] want God to search our hearts out
[17:35] because that is
[17:36] what to
[17:38] remember that is what when you start to
[17:41] examine your own self what have you
[17:42] fallen from this church age the Ephesus
[17:46] Church they had labored they had they
[17:49] couldn't stand people who were evil but
[17:52] yet God said I have something against
[17:54] you I have something where you're short
[17:58] you're short of that first love that
[18:00] love you had for me when you started
[18:03] that love that you had for me when you
[18:06] were Justified when I pick you up when
[18:08] you were perceived and everything was so
[18:12] different and you were testifying and it
[18:15] had that glue on your face but that glue
[18:16] is no longer there uh that passion to
[18:19] know the word that that cry to get into
[18:21] the spirit that F desire to please God
[18:23] is is no longer dear and you know we
[18:27] want to see what God sees you want to
[18:31] get the eyes of God if you're
[18:34] proud you wouldn't want to see yourself
[18:39] you wouldn't want to examine yourself
[18:41] there are people who like to examine
[18:42] others they could see other condition
[18:45] and point fingers and carry on but when
[18:48] Isaiah came into presence Isaiah said
[18:51] whoo is me it was an examination that
[18:54] came to the person in that words us know
[18:58] where is them who is me because I'm in
[19:01] trouble I I'm NE of you I'm a man of
[19:03] unclean lips and I need cleansing I need
[19:06] pan I need to repent to be at your altar
[19:11] and the prophet in Ephesian Church age
[19:14] he read the scripture remember from when
[19:18] Fallen he said God tells them to
[19:21] remember evidently something had left
[19:24] their minds they had forgotten something
[19:27] he told them to turn back in their minds
[19:31] to their point of origin the origin of
[19:34] the first age was Pentecost that fallen
[19:36] from it they had forgotten the glory and
[19:39] The Wonder of it it was time to go back
[19:42] in mind and then in reality look how
[19:45] these words are placed it was time to go
[19:48] back in mind and then in reality in
[19:50] other words you have to stop with the
[19:52] thought first and then hit to head
[19:55] towards a reality back to where they
[19:58] could say for me to live is Christ back
[20:01] to Purity when anas and ZF were dealt
[20:05] with back to the gate
[20:08] beautiful what a reproach it is to drift
[20:13] from God and countenance those acts that
[20:17] defile his name let those who name his
[20:21] name depart from sin and keep their
[20:26] vessels pure for God for God look at
[20:31] what you once through in your heart and
[20:33] mind and in your life then go back to it
[20:37] on Wednesday nights you heard the
[20:38] exaltation you heard the word love the
[20:40] Lord with all thy heart all thy mind all
[20:43] thy strength and that's how God wanted
[20:46] because you could take God in with your
[20:48] mind hearing words but your heart is
[20:52] elsewhere God doesn't want that he want
[20:54] your mind and heart line up that you
[20:57] could correct
[20:58] serve him and worship him okay now what
[21:03] is the way back question what is the way
[21:07] back the way is the way of
[21:10] repentance the way is the way of
[21:13] repentance and you know when we hear the
[21:14] word repentance we think about sinner
[21:17] people who unsee repenting we don't
[21:19] think much of Christians needing to
[21:23] repent to truly repent and the prophet
[21:26] went on further to say if a sinner has
[21:29] to come to God by way of repentance then
[21:33] the
[21:34] lukewarm or
[21:36] backslider will have to repent that much
[21:41] more
[21:43] repent bring forth fruit me for
[21:47] repentance prove it by your life this is
[21:50] not as if you know sometime husband and
[21:52] wife have problems issues and quarrels
[21:55] and fusses and and it's sad I don't sign
[21:59] that this is right at all they're not
[22:00] talking to each other for days and then
[22:02] they stand back talking yes so that's
[22:03] not how things are corrected one person
[22:07] has to take responsibility say I'm sorry
[22:09] and forgive me and then we could
[22:13] normalize stuff that is repenting that
[22:14] is straight out thing that will not just
[22:16] start back so it's not as if we could
[22:20] sin fail God carrying with a bunch of
[22:23] nonsense and just start back talking to
[22:24] the Lord no he requires repentance
[22:29] because he has to judge sin his nature
[22:32] cannot fellowship with sin his nature
[22:35] cannot tolerate sin his nature cannot
[22:38] compromise sin the wages of sin is debt
[22:41] he told his son in the Garden of Eden
[22:44] the day you eat thereof that day you
[22:45] shall surely die there was no question
[22:48] about the law of God he said you could
[22:50] eat of every tree but that tree in the
[22:52] midst don't touch it if you touch it eat
[22:55] it you die and he died because God have
[22:58] to keep his word so the prophet said
[23:01] bring forth fruit meat for repentance
[23:03] prove it by your life if you do not
[23:06] repent said God I will remove your
[23:09] lampstand a church here we go in that
[23:14] condition can't give light to the world
[23:18] it's light has turned to Darkness wait a
[23:22] minute brother over you mean a church
[23:24] like to go out completely a church could
[23:27] go completely Into Darkness and yet
[23:30] people come in there every Sunday the
[23:31] pastor preaching messages but the church
[23:34] spiritually speaking is in total
[23:37] darkness God will then take away its
[23:40] faithful messenger its faithful
[23:42] Shepherds and lead them to leave them to
[23:46] themselves listen this now repent
[23:50] quickly don't
[23:51] hesitate evidently Ephesus did did
[23:54] hesitate for her lifespan was not very
[23:57] long
[23:58] the glory of God decreased ever so
[24:01] rapidly it was not long until the city
[24:04] was in Ruins this glorious Temple was in
[24:07] a shapeless Mass the land became Marsh
[24:10] inhabited by waterfall the population
[24:13] was gone except for a few
[24:16] unbelievers in a qualid village listen
[24:19] to this Aston astonishing statement
[24:22] there was not even one Christian left
[24:27] that lamp was rent from its place now it
[24:33] does not mean that she could not have
[24:36] repented it does not mean that we cannot
[24:39] repent we can but it must be quickly it
[24:42] must be a true heart cry to God in
[24:47] sorrow and then God will
[24:50] restore and the glory shall come again
[24:55] in other words you and I I we tonight
[24:58] the church we cannot look for God's
[25:01] glory in sin we cannot look for God's
[25:05] glory in
[25:06] unbelief we cannot look for God's glory
[25:09] if we haven't done all that we can do
[25:13] and the prophet taught us that is the
[25:16] mechanics when we can do all that we can
[25:20] do for example if you know you have
[25:23] something to make right you cannot
[25:25] really correctly be blessed until the
[25:27] right you have somebody to repent to you
[25:30] have somebody to straighten out you have
[25:31] something you're stole to take back
[25:33] whatever it is I don't care whatever it
[25:34] is but you have to know in your spirit
[25:38] that you have fallen from something you
[25:42] need to get back sometime I I think I
[25:45] preached something I was talking about
[25:46] get back on track get back in line the
[25:49] prophet saw a vision the bride getting
[25:50] out of order and he said get back in
[25:52] step and many times along the journey we
[25:55] drift here we drift here we we find
[25:57] ourselves on a how do I say a rocky road
[26:00] there not the Narrow Path some dirt road
[26:03] somewhere where we want to do our own
[26:05] thing we not willing to take up the
[26:07] cross and and come after him and go
[26:09] after him but tonight remember from when
[26:14] th had
[26:15] fallen and just remember repent he said
[26:18] now I have somewhat against thee because
[26:21] thou has left thy first love I have
[26:24] something against you you have been
[26:26] patient lots of patience you have held
[26:29] up my name I appreciate all of that I
[26:31] commend you for that I've seen that you
[26:34] try them who say the apostles from them
[26:36] Liars they don't cope with the word I
[26:38] appreciate all of that but there is
[26:41] something I got against you that is you
[26:43] have left your first love not the lovely
[26:47] they left the first love you left here
[26:50] we go that love that you once had for
[26:53] them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[26:56] meetings
[26:58] and I sure I don't the black man is
[27:01] around but many of us in the early years
[27:03] had no cars to go to service and whatnot
[27:06] but guess what we wasn't missing church
[27:08] we had to get there anyhow and we wasn't
[27:11] getting there just on a Sunday we were
[27:13] getting there on a Tuesday on a Thursday
[27:15] and what not we find ourselves because
[27:17] there was a deep there was a hungering
[27:20] there was a thirsting it matters it was
[27:22] our life it was our energy it was our
[27:25] strength it was our all that is what it
[27:28] meant to us so you left that love you
[27:31] once had for them good oldfashioned Holy
[27:34] Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of
[27:37] slide backwards into that formal and our
[27:40] father nonsense if God yeah we go had
[27:44] that against this
[27:46] church he has got it against that one
[27:49] too because you left your first love
[27:52] I've got it against you and you know
[27:54] it's a shame because we as parents
[27:58] and if you have old parents and whatnot
[28:00] you know raise your children a certain
[28:02] way you see how your own parents raise
[28:04] you as a child and what that and then
[28:06] you are slack with your own and not only
[28:08] that I know there's no school of
[28:10] parenting there's no school of of of of
[28:13] a wife and husband or whatnot but guess
[28:15] what we could pray to be better husbands
[28:18] we could pray to be better wives we
[28:20] could pray to be better fathers we could
[28:22] pray to be better mothers and you can
[28:24] judge yourself in that way in other
[28:26] words if somebody want to hear about me
[28:29] talk to my wife let my wife tell you the
[28:31] kind of person that I am I can't come
[28:33] and say I am this I am that I am that
[28:34] I'm living with her if you want to know
[28:36] about my wife come and talk to me and I
[28:38] can tell you about her because I'm
[28:40] living with her I'm living as a daily
[28:42] basis I'm not talking about the church
[28:43] front what you see going to church in a
[28:45] church dress or you see me in a suit I'm
[28:48] not talking about that I'm talking about
[28:50] living with that person and God knows
[28:52] our heart God know the condition of our
[28:54] hearts tonight we in this room and we're
[28:57] looking for God to answer prayer okay
[28:59] we're looking for God to fulfill his
[29:00] good in our lives and if there are
[29:02] issues there those issues should be
[29:04] addressed and be sorted out because
[29:06] listen to this sometime ago when I
[29:09] brought the word warn them from me and
[29:12] and Watchman and a tower R the righteous
[29:15] War the wicked that doesn't just apply
[29:17] to the pastor or the preacher that
[29:19] applies to the home in other words we
[29:22] have children we should speak to them
[29:24] they don't want to hear they have to
[29:26] hear they have to whether they hear or
[29:28] for they have to hear what God thinks
[29:31] say write it on your door post put it
[29:33] here let hear to be morning in other
[29:35] wordss that is what we supposed to be
[29:36] doing when they were small growing up to
[29:39] to guide them and to lead them and so on
[29:41] afterwards they get big man and they
[29:42] want to carry on or what not that's
[29:44] little different but we still to speak
[29:45] to them and let them know what God's
[29:48] will is and what God wants so what's
[29:50] something I have something against you
[29:52] that's my complaint you once had a great
[29:54] time you let the world begin to creep in
[29:58] and you got acting a little
[30:00] formal and you see sin is a a real over
[30:05] I'm say boy run from it um it's like
[30:08] death coming it's like a fast car coming
[30:11] it come to kill you really come to kill
[30:13] you it kill you in doses it kill you
[30:15] slowly it kill your desire for God it
[30:18] kills your love it kills your joy it
[30:21] kills the desire to pray to read your
[30:23] bible to read your spoken with books
[30:26] slowly like a like a like a suant like
[30:29] some Vine like a tentacle surrounding
[30:32] the plant very slowly very light and
[30:34] then gripping hard and harder and sin
[30:36] have a way that's corrupt the heart in a
[30:38] way where your heart get hard where
[30:41] you're no longer soft and sensitive to
[30:43] the spirit now they get hard and cold
[30:47] and judgmental and that sort of thing
[30:49] that's why it's sad to me back believers
[30:52] who know so much of wor and you can't
[30:54] tell them anything because they're
[30:55] arrogant in their back condition
[30:57] you want to be
[31:01] remember saying my my name you got a lot
[31:05] of patience your labor like a m your
[31:08] labor you said my you left Grace and
[31:10] Faith and swap it for labor and works
[31:12] but where is the love in other words
[31:14] you're doing stuff with no love behind
[31:15] it you're coming to church with no love
[31:17] behind it you come like you're giving
[31:18] your husband a plate of food but no love
[31:20] behind it you trying to serve and sweep
[31:22] beh house and but no love behind it it
[31:24] has to have l behind it he said as David
[31:29] said oh Lord restore unto me the joy of
[31:31] my salvation where is them all night
[31:34] prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks
[31:37] when else have you crying cry to God my
[31:40] goodness the Bible even dust it and got
[31:43] covers in it you read old love stories
[31:46] and news and things and things that
[31:48] oughtn't to be allowed to be published
[31:50] and put in a trash can we Pentecostal
[31:52] people pick them up and like LOF over
[31:54] them like bunch of flies and a garbage
[31:56] can
[31:58] he said now remember a warning remember
[32:01] therefore from when thou fallen from
[32:05] when you come from from Pentecost you
[32:08] fell down to where you are now
[32:10] backsliding and repent and do the first
[32:13] Works amen and he explained this way in
[32:17] other words if you got a god-filled
[32:18] pastor fill with the Holy Ghost and you
[32:19] try to hold him under your finger and we
[32:22] excommunicate him don't you worry God
[32:24] will do it before you get a chance he
[32:26] will go and preach stones on the street
[32:28] before he compromis with all that kind
[32:29] of stuff listen to this one here now you
[32:32] got a pastor that really tells you the
[32:35] truth you ought to honor God and stay in
[32:38] the spirit and worship God realizing
[32:41] that you are going to be lost if you
[32:43] don't hear that
[32:47] head you are going to be lost if you
[32:49] don't don't do what honor God and stay
[32:52] in the spirit and worship God if you
[32:53] have a pastor that tells you the truth
[32:56] okay I'm almost done
[32:59] L sentur he said I have need of nothing
[33:01] or the voice said right now when anybody
[33:03] says I have need of nothing he could
[33:06] very well be saying I have everything or
[33:08] he could be saying I don't want anym I
[33:11] am full now you can express this any way
[33:14] you want it all adds up to the fact that
[33:18] the church is
[33:20] complacent so when people feel satisfied
[33:24] when people feel they don't need this
[33:26] one they need I need this and whatnot
[33:28] and you need to hear from the pastor and
[33:30] what not and you don't need Ministry and
[33:33] whatnot the person become
[33:36] complacent being complacent is dangerous
[33:39] and as a pastor I fought against that
[33:42] all my life all the year and that is why
[33:46] I love to bring the promises that you
[33:47] can be reaching out like how Paul said
[33:49] forgetting things that are pass I press
[33:51] towards the Mark I always see a mark to
[33:54] press something because if you see you
[33:56] get yourself
[33:57] complacent you are how to say it like a
[34:01] real Target for deceptive Spirit and the
[34:04] enemy because that complacency would
[34:06] bring you into the spirit of entitlement
[34:08] and under deception that you are okay
[34:12] and you wouldn't even recognize what and
[34:16] where you have fallen from and that is
[34:19] what this is about tonight I find it
[34:21] very strange but as I said whatever he
[34:24] gives me I will give you remember from
[34:26] when
[34:28] the
[34:29] for watch almost done it adds up to the
[34:34] fact that the church is complacent she
[34:36] is satisfied what she has she either
[34:39] figures she has it all or has enough and
[34:42] that is exactly what we find today what
[34:45] denomination is not claiming that it has
[34:47] the Revelation and the power and the
[34:48] truth I have
[34:50] groups fooling the people deceiving the
[34:53] people that they alone have it they
[34:55] alone as the bride nobody doesn't train
[34:56] that nobody in the world when you're
[34:58] there like the bride and I the bride all
[35:01] kind of catchphrases and S of
[35:02] foolishness and people believe in that
[35:04] light you got a man telling them that it
[35:06] easier to be a believe a man than to
[35:08] believe what God said yeah what
[35:12] denominations that claiming to be it has
[35:14] the revelation of the power and The
[35:15] Truth Listen to the Baptist they all
[35:17] have it listen to the Methodist they all
[35:19] have it he what the Pentecostal say they
[35:22] have the fullness of the fullness now
[35:24] they are all saying here we go TR trying
[35:27] to prove that they have it all they had
[35:30] enough yet is that the truth and this
[35:33] the part I want to get to compare this
[35:35] 20th century Church to the first century
[35:38] Church go ahead do that where is the
[35:40] power where is the love where is the
[35:43] purified church that with stod sin and
[35:47] walked with faith towards Jesus where is
[35:51] the unity you can't find it if this
[35:53] church has all it needs why were they
[35:57] crying out for more of God in the book
[35:59] of Acts if this I say this way if this
[36:03] message Church Malachi for message
[36:06] pastors prophets teachers evangelists
[36:09] Believers have all the Mysteries have
[36:12] all the knowledge have the series open
[36:14] and open book and whatnot why would they
[36:17] crying out for more of God in the book
[36:21] of Acts as though they didn't have it
[36:24] all and yet they had far more than they
[36:27] have to do
[36:31] question I'm finished just three more
[36:33] scriptures to read and we be going on
[36:35] into
[36:36] prayer Proverbs
[36:38] 9:10 the fear of the Lord is the
[36:41] beginning of
[36:42] wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is
[36:47] understanding now we talking about
[36:49] repent from when th
[36:51] was do you know Judas
[36:54] repented do you know Judas was
[36:57] remorseful but it was too late is not
[37:01] repenting because you get exposed is
[37:04] repenting because you recognize where
[37:07] you have fallen and where you have fall
[37:09] short and I want to read this in Matthew
[37:12] 27 verse three speaking about Judas then
[37:17] Judas which had betrayed him Jesus when
[37:22] he saw that he was
[37:24] condemned repented
[37:27] himself and brought again the 30 pieces
[37:30] of silver to the chief priest
[37:33] and the Amplified say it this way when
[37:36] Judas his betrayer saw that Jesus was
[37:39] condemned Judas was afflicted in mind
[37:42] and troubled for his former Folly with
[37:46] remorse with little more than a selfish
[37:50] dread of the consequences he brought
[37:52] back the 30 pieces of silver to the
[37:54] chief priests and the elders saying I
[37:56] have sinned
[37:57] is that I have betrayed the innocent
[37:58] blood and they said what is that to us
[38:01] see th to that and he cast down the
[38:04] pieces of silver in the temple and
[38:06] departed and went and hanged
[38:09] himself
[38:11] and next scrip I have is Hebrews 12
[38:14] verse 14-1 17 follow peace with all men
[38:18] and Holiness which without which no man
[38:21] shall see the Lord looking diligently
[38:24] here we go least a any man
[38:28] fail of the grace of God least any root
[38:32] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[38:37] thereby many be
[38:39] defil do you understand that the Bible
[38:42] itself saying that you can be defiled by
[38:46] bitterness you become a defiled vessel
[38:50] by bitterness verse 16 least there be
[38:54] any
[38:55] fornicator fornicat is sin believer who
[38:59] not have premarital sex and having sex
[39:01] out of Covenant of marriage is
[39:04] sin least there be any fornicator or
[39:08] profane person as Esau so God Lin up
[39:11] fornicator profane with Esau who for one
[39:15] morle of me soul his
[39:17] Birthright for you know that
[39:20] afterwards when he could have inherited
[39:23] the blessing he was
[39:25] rejected for he he found no place of
[39:29] repentance though he sought it carefully
[39:32] with
[39:33] tears so you could actually cross the
[39:36] line where repentance is no longer
[39:41] valid I trust nobody does that and I'm
[39:44] going to close with this quote and we a
[39:50] finish in your hours of
[39:52] death when the death angel sitting at
[39:55] the foot of the bed
[39:58] instead of looking out Dear at a hideous
[40:00] thing and know that you refuse to come
[40:02] one
[40:03] time then your soul become black and
[40:06] smutty no more time no matter how hard
[40:08] you cry Esau send
[40:13] away his day of
[40:15] Grace and didn't get a chance he went
[40:18] bitterly trying to find a place to make
[40:21] it right but he couldn't do it God
[40:23] called him the last time but you forfeit
[40:26] all your rights all your friends all
[40:29] your feelings and everything this
[40:30] morning to come here you forfeit your
[40:33] rights to kneel down here and talk to
[40:36] God I am Telling You by the word of the
[40:39] Lord that Christ said he that comes to
[40:41] me I will know Wise cast out now while
[40:45] you are here on the altar
[40:47] repent tell him that you're sorry for
[40:50] what things that you did that's what the
[40:53] matter today people don't receive the
[40:54] Holy Ghost when they baptized they just
[40:58] don't toally repent so it have toally
[41:03] repent God is trying to give them the
[41:06] Holy Ghost he wants you to be meek quiet
[41:11] gentle and that's the reason you get up
[41:14] with the same selfishness in your
[41:16] heart he says you got to get up from
[41:19] there a different person you got to get
[41:21] from there gentle quiet Meek humble God
[41:24] Spirit dwelling in you and look back
[41:26] here we go this is important and look
[41:29] back down the trail to see how far you
[41:32] have come to see you are gaining grown
[41:35] all the time that is the Holy Spirit the
[41:38] holy spirit is love joy peace
[41:41] longsuffering meekness Gess patience
[41:44] Faith just repent and tell God you want
[41:47] that right now and there's the
[41:50] final God gave Abraham a promise Abraham
[41:54] believed God it was in put him for
[41:58] righteousness listen now and he sealed
[42:01] him the Covenant by the SE of
[42:03] circumcision and God give you a promise
[42:08] potentially that you will receive it and
[42:10] you are going to be raised up this body
[42:13] is going to be glorified with him at the
[42:14] end time but you see you have to get
[42:17] clearance under that deed and the
[42:20] clearance is when everything against it
[42:24] has been stricken off and you got the
[42:26] abstracted you got the seal it is yours
[42:30] everything is on it belongs to you and
[42:32] when we believe on Jesus Christ as our
[42:34] savior and repent and baptize and come
[42:38] to believe him here we go God recognizes
[42:43] our repentance and our faith towards him
[42:47] and sends down the abstract which is the
[42:49] Holy Ghost right is the guarantee that
[42:53] everything that was ever held against
[42:54] you you toally repented and the property
[42:57] is boughten and you hold the abstract
[43:00] for the Assurance so friends God is the
[43:04] one to recognize our repentance and I
[43:08] said get on in prayer
[43:09] tonight see how let God search you
[43:13] you're not studying others you are
[43:16] looking to get that experience like
[43:18] Isaiah did always is me so we're going
[43:21] to get down this prayer this time I
[43:23] trust then that this will be a help to
[43:25] you a blessing J you this is what was
[43:27] given to me to share with you and I did
[43:29] just that remember from whence thou
[43:32] fallen and repent praise the
