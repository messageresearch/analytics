[16:11] meet the bridegroom five of them were
[16:13] wise five of foolish they that were
[16:16] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[16:19] with them but the wise took oil in their
[16:22] vessels with their lamps while the
[16:26] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[16:27] and slept on a midnight there was a cry
[16:30] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[16:33] out to meet him then all those virgins
[16:35] arose and trimmed their lamps and the
[16:38] foolish said unto the wise give us of
[16:40] your oil for our lamps are borne out but
[16:44] the wise answered saying not so least
[16:47] yea enough for us and you but go ye
[16:51] rather to them that sell and buy for
[16:53] yourselves and while they went while
[17:01] they went to buy the bridegroom came and
[17:04] either were ready went in with him to
[17:06] the marriage and the door was shut
[17:09] afterward up came also the other virgins
[17:11] in Lord Lord open to us where the
[17:16] answered and said verily I said to you I

[17:35] your presence into your house and to
[17:37] learn of you and to receive from you and
[17:40] in this
[17:42] when we expect a dynamic power via come
[17:45] amongst your people Lord and baptize
[17:47] them and fire but the Holy Ghost tonight
[17:49] in GCM I ask it
[17:51] amen and amen you may be seated oh
[17:53] praise God thank you lord
[17:55] well said I still be choice him from
[17:58] Sunday I felt as a different turn
[18:01] a new season among us that the Lord went
[18:04] up blessed and I log on report mightily
[18:06] do we believe that tonight just three
[18:09] little words five wise virgins five wise
[18:13] virgins another inspiration get ready
[18:16] and still ready
[18:18] oh praise God get ready and stay ready
[18:22] this Christianity is not a part-time
[18:24] thing he's a full-time thing it can be a
[18:28] part-time Christian deliver the full ten
[18:29] devil or glory Liguria be fully
[18:32] committed
[18:33] oh praise God isn't that right no but a
[18:36] Branham he had seen earlier with his
[18:38] shop
[18:38] you see there's three woman carriers of
[18:40] the natural seed until it matured into
[18:43] Jesus Ishmael could not be he was born
[18:46] from the bonds woman and Isaac was born
[18:49] of sex between ciarán Abraham but then
[18:52] come along Mary by the vision put
[18:54] produced Jesus Christ that's gone the
[18:56] world no look there were three woman
[18:58] there are true women type here churches
[19:00] the woman always tied church's tree
[19:03] denominational ages carriers which must
[19:06] also die so therefore just like the
[19:09] shock and so forth to give room for the
[19:10] seed the seed cannot get right until the
[19:15] shock stalk leaves all dry that's right
[19:20] it sucks every bit of the light in them
[19:22] and so it's all it all it was is that
[19:26] plus or praise God so the seed cannot
[19:30] write until everything has died and what
[19:33] the sea does the seed draws all the life
[19:35] on everything so afterwards the life is
[19:38] contained in the seed
[19:40] the seed has the lights or blowing of
[19:44] God he said you cannot do it nor with
[19:46] the cetane or play time or glory the
[19:50] shocks are dead the shocks at Jaya this
[19:53] is the Virgin would time not touched its
[19:56] virgin remember it's a virgin good time
[19:59] if you're putting in the hands of the
[20:01] nomination it won't be a virgin it will
[20:03] be manhandled she's got to be virgin not
[20:07] touch my interpretation always I love it
[20:10] there'll be no denominational
[20:12] manhandling in the virgin bit of the
[20:16] brain or glory to God the bride will be
[20:19] pitted and there'd be no manhandling of
[20:22] the virgin put of that bride that's why
[20:25] the Lord Himself descended with a shout
[20:27] or chlorine I've got to get the bride oh
[20:29] we believe that hallelujah so when the
[20:33] Lord told him pick up a pen I was right
[20:34] he said no watch in the last days the
[20:37] true the church bride comes a headstone
[20:40] will be a super race as she neared the
[20:44] great headstone there will be so much
[20:46] like him that there will be in his very
[20:49] image in order to be united with him
[20:51] there will be one and that's why we say
[20:53] the Holy Spirit come back on drying the
[20:56] Holy sprit have to come down on a hat my
[20:57] sphere of praise and worship double
[21:00] United with Christ I have to be like
[21:02] Christ whole globe I really got that to
[21:06] realize it with Christ you have to be
[21:07] like Christ or glory to God so therefore
[21:11] in the upper room that wants to be
[21:13] worshiping to create the atmosphere for
[21:15] the holy s--t way to come down the water
[21:17] vapor coming up on dead
[21:18] Oh glory to God and never kill never not
[21:21] dead they come not in the atmosphere
[21:23] Oh glory that was fast user Street he
[21:25] was preached Villa's prayed for two and
[21:27] a half years for five hours every day
[21:29] the church was it was was was being
[21:32] channeling to prayer Liezel being
[21:34] challenged the prayer why it was power
[21:36] coming up on a sanctified life let me
[21:39] say it again
[21:40] it was power comment on a sanctified
[21:42] life and I separated life because God
[21:45] put Wesley in that position
[21:47] clean the touch up for your point of the
[21:50] spirit or chlorine upon justification
[21:53] pick up the duty class certification
[21:54] wash the dirty glass back to Holy Ghost
[21:57] pour milk into the glass or do you
[22:00] believe that or glory to God so the
[22:03] first son was a spoken C word of God he
[22:06] was given my brain
[22:07] oh my the bride was given to what to
[22:10] reproduce himself again another son of
[22:13] God
[22:14] so this terminology called bride it's
[22:18] for reproduction purposes so Jesus want
[22:21] to reproduce himself began a brain to
[22:24] produce more sons just like him so you
[22:27] had to become just like him how many
[22:30] believe that not a church member but a
[22:34] reproduction of the grain Oh God Lord
[22:37] hallelujah
[22:39] the bride was given to her producing
[22:41] self again another son of God and she
[22:43] fell by high breeding she fell and
[22:46] caused him to bang the second son spoken
[22:50] seed word was given a bright like Adam
[22:52] so Adam his Bridal fell right but before
[22:54] he could marry her she fall also okay
[22:57] then from a little group of the true
[23:00] seed of the word God represent Christ
[23:03] I've been love it bright of version of
[23:06] version of his word on tonight we sing
[23:09] on the positive five wise virgins Oh
[23:12] glory to God I want to touch the foolish
[23:14] I want to talk about the wise one
[23:16] Oh glory to God she will be a vision for
[23:20] the world
[23:20] isn't that right how do you believe that
[23:23] then what a virgin who knows no man-made
[23:27] creeps and dogmas what a virgin knows
[23:30] God said so God said so my side mom

[38:39] time they talk about the final written
[38:41] under the rapture he said but it wasn't
[38:43] because the seed has not come yet this

[49:04] going to call a church to perfection by
[49:06] his word Jesus Christ or glory to God we
[49:10] believe that
[49:11] hallelujah praise God praise God
[49:14] alright what time is that he said see
[49:17] time so let's look back on what we read
[49:20] on Sunday when the baptism of the Holy
[49:22] Ghost was presented a Methodist they
[49:24] couldn't take it no when the see tiny
[49:27] has produced a Pentecost she can't take
[49:32] it she's organized but she has been a
[49:34] carrier of the seed
[49:35] Oh glory look God you know people
[49:38] pastor's message in the 70s and 80s all
[49:39] around they pass through the message Oh
[49:43] glory to God hallelujah but you are seed
[49:47] glory record mmm so what did the Prophet
[49:51] prophesied see time will produce what
[49:53] another Pentecost hallelujah
[49:57] let's go but I'm talking about Abraham
[49:59] and where's that wife Sarah she's dead
[50:03] behind you he's I'm gonna visit you I
[50:05] please don't prolong I'm going to visit
[50:07] you according to the time of life and
[50:09] you're gonna have that baby that you're
[50:11] waiting on he said any breaking but
[50:13] around in prophecy the Lateran is fixin
[50:17] to fall you have held that seed in there
[50:20] long enough now believe in you are
[50:24] looking for a common son and he is
[50:26] coming why I can't see that the Lateran
[50:31] is fixin to fall oh give the Lord a
[50:34] shout on that do you believe that when
[50:38] you're born speak it to yourself
[50:40] pray about us and Lord I know the
[50:42] lettering
[50:43] it's fixin to fall get ready for I'd
[50:47] stay ready Oh blow you and I said get
[50:51] ready and steady Oh hallelujah the
[50:55] latter in is fixin to fall that's
[50:58] guaranteed
[50:59] we'll get the Lord I showed about that
[51:01] so the rain is not a problem it's what
[51:05] seed inside of you
[51:06] well can the Lord a shout and if that
[51:09] word seed inside of you you have you
[51:12] will you must reproduce the life of
[51:14] Jesus Christ or glory let go because the
[51:18] seed of God inside of you
[51:20] hallelujah praise God remember there
[51:24] will be such a denominational gathering
[51:25] pretty soon it will be terrific and they
[51:28] will bring themselves together in this
[51:30] Federation of Churches and then this
[51:32] kind of change will be put out of
[51:33] operation as far as they know it's at
[51:35] that time that Jesus appeared and he
[51:38] will show which is Brian which is not
[51:40] what we remember Christian friends I'm a
[51:42] man I can make mistakes but God being
[51:45] God cannot make a mistake all the words
[51:49] that have been written must be fulfilled
[51:51] so we have got things here in scripture
[51:54] that must be fulfilled and that is one
[51:57] of the things this point
[51:58] to come but before the boycott tantrum
[52:04] or the mocking of the beast there has to
[52:08] be a seat short for God to take a church
[52:11] out of it that's what's important these
[52:15] messages to sort of see that they could
[52:18] take out because the my words are spirit
[52:21] and my words are lies so Willard is also
[52:27] a spirit and you're gonna find out the
[52:29] foolish virgins they can't get the oil
[52:31] because they don't have the word the
[52:33] turn of the Spirit Oh glory to God or
[52:37] get a lotta show glory to go when you
[52:40] come to Simmons they come back extra oil
[52:42] God release the oil and wood form nor
[52:45] the oil I want to turn into spirit the
[52:47] oil I want to turn into power
[52:49] the realism of the fall and the world
[52:52] will live you know what brother I'm
[52:54] calling me up Aroon dry seeds he said
[52:57] they'd haul themselves in the upper room
[52:59] there were dry seeds waiting for real
[53:03] crises and they afraid crises and the
[53:06] fearful crises and awaken on the promise
[53:10] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[53:13] come my god the rain began to fall upon
[53:16] them dry seeds and the uppermost to
[53:19] Strong's feel smaller because I'm seeing
[53:21] him to grow and smell all praise God it
[53:23] was too small in the upper room or
[53:26] glowing and they were filled with the
[53:27] Holy Ghost when I found Reims hell on
[53:29] their season and this message you are

[1:00:53] Spirit that's why we had known a stick
[1:00:55] with oil oil symbolize Holy Spirit so
[1:00:58] the wise had oil in their lamps which
[1:00:59] was Holy Spirit so they were ready to go
[1:01:02] into the wedding supper okay and we find
[1:01:04] Ezekiel 9 he skipped oil Holy Spirit

[1:01:53] lamps your mystery a mystery of the
[1:01:57] lamps
[1:01:57] you don't fall any parts of the lamp but
[1:02:00] it needs oil in that lamp and the Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost if it's in there it produces it
[1:02:10] produces the very same kind of
[1:02:12] it did on Pentacles it's not on model
