this great love of god it is fathomless as the skies brother branham says there is no way to ever try to explain the depths of the love of god hallelujah for god is loving man his very being is love amen seven perfect spirits can we say amen this morning glory to god god's love is divine love a god pull of amen and hebrews chapter four amen brahma explained that there are four levels of love amen first is perfect love that's god's love pure and adulterated divine love amen praise god number two then there is fill your love amen which is earthly that's the love for your family but it has some perversion in it my number three then lustful love it has more perversion in it then number four there's filthy love it keeps on getting more perverted but by the look babaram said god's love agapo is million miles higher praise god every love outside of agapo is perverted love which has an end a couple of has no big beginning and it will never have an end can we say amen praise god hallelujah glory to god amen thank you jesus so in the garden sin perverted the pure love that adam shared with his family and with god in the beginning sin brought lust and fear and hatred and murder my in other words the heart of love in eden pure gentle divine soft passionate for god tenderhearted that kind of heart it changed it became a heart of stone perverted carnal hateful fearful my my my amen my my amen glory to god glory to god jeremiah 17 the heart is now deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it my my my my no wonder the songwriter said what can be done with this whole heart of mine please soften it up praise god with the holy ghost and fire hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god that old heart praise god but in ezekiel 36 we have promised a new heart a new heart

love pure love agape love back to a heart of love give the lord a hand of praise this morning [Applause] glory so love is key love is the objective paul emphasizes to the church how we must get back to love make no mistake about it don't fool yourself from divine love but ibrahim said no matter how much we try to bluff we are negative without love can we say amen amen and first corinthians 13 though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have no charity i'm nothing i've missed the mark completely praise god my god my god he said though i prophesy and understand all mysteries and knowledge i am nothing without love my god he said do i have faith to move mountains and have no love i am still nothing praise god my god my god he's trying to show the importance of love to the church amen my and some people feel that charity means feeding the poor but paul says though i give all my goods to feed the poor i am still nothing without charity my you say do i give my body to be burned and have not charity i am still nothing it will profit nothing whatsoever my so charity is not just feeding the poor some people say man this charity here is divine love the love of god can we say man praise god hallelujah amen and first corinthians 14 follow after charity we must get it somebody say must get it must get it praise god hallelujah the love of god amen that's the love of god even christ amen love love amen the perfect love of god and colossians chapter 3 says above all these things put on charity hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how many one charity how many

now amen glory so come on love is the key say amen love is the key amen hallelujah glory even the gifts of the church brother branham said perfect love brings perfect gifts he says so work first with love and then that brings fellowship and then fellowship brings gifts can we say amen hallelujah come on now he said one time i'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that then every spiritual gift operated in the church he was trying to show how important love is among the people amen a heart of love for god and his people thank you praise god he said you can have every gift and still be lost again he said i'd rather have that experience of love than all the gifts that god has in heaven my but paul kept talking about something that was perfect to come when that perfect thing comes brother everything else will fade away amen first corinthians 13 amen can we say amen so talking about the heart of love give the lord a heart of prayer a familiar story from urbana we remember the story of brother branham leaving his plane and just walking until he met the old shana mike type woman she said the lord gave my husband and i a lovely boy and i promised the lord i'd raised my baby for him but he took the wrong road a few years ago and now he has a venereal disease and now he's laying in the room dying the doctor has given him all kinds of shots and he can't get well he's been unconscious since yesterday she said i got down on my knees and i prayed oh lord if i am the shadowmind woman where is your elijah she said i prayed all night and the lord said to stand by the gate this morning she had a relationship with god amen she spoke to god and god spoke back to her amen praise god amen my relationship hallelujah and when brother branham reached he went into the house he saw the boy laying there making a song like he said mama is so dark she was patching him and loving him he was ramsay he was kind of unconscious but no matter how old he was or what he had done he was still mama's boy um yes lord he said no matter how filthy how the balch a real mother's love will wade right on through it hallelujah talking about a mother's love this morning amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said that old saint got down there and kissed her son and said god bless mommy's baby and baby said i thought if a mother's love will do that fill your love if a mother's love can do that how much more will the love of god do for us can we say amen this morning how much more will god's love do for us this morning hallelujah he said oh love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forevermore enjoy hallelujah the love of god hallelujah praise god if a mother's love can do that what will the love of god do for us he said yes a mother may forget her suffering baby but god said i will never leave you nor forsake you your names are written and engraved in the palm of my hands somebody give him praise somebody gave him praise hallelujah i will never leave you now forsake you praise god as i promised you amen oh glory she said person can we pray and that old saint knelt down and raised up our hands and poured out her heart to god but ibrahim said i never heard such a prayer in my life my he said i when i heard her pray he said i held the little iron post off the bed and cried like a baby to see the outpouring of love it moved the prophet to see your mother's love praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and when she was finished i said dear god i don't know why you sent me down here but you brought me here and you're in an obedience to the leading of the holy spirit i lay my hands upon this boy in the name of jesus christ he said next thing the boy said mama this getting light in here hallelujah and in a few moments he was up on his feet rejoicing somebody gave god praise hallelujah ah hallelujah he was perfectly healed thereafter hallelujah a heart of love just mother's love just fill your love the power of love praise god love is the most powerful force praise god amen brother when love is projected sovereign grace

story of the prophet with the maniac man killing preachers in oregon a 300-pound man out of this insane institution about six feet two there were over five thousand people in the audience about 300 preachers on the platform the man ran up the platform shouted you hypocrite you snake in the grass i'll show you how much man of god you are i'll break every bone in your body but abraham is a small man he said when that happened you could hear a pin drop in the audience hundreds of sick people were there he said i'm kept on speaking then a man rushed up to the to brother branham on the pulpit and spit in his face my and you know what happened the holy spirit came down and said you will fall over my feet and he did but from the message god provided a lamb he explained it a little differently brabham said what was it did i hate the man he said no i loved him a poor mortal in that condition that was not the man speaking that was the devil the devil made a challenge and the holy spirit challenged him back glory to god amen praise god all fear was gone love cast away all fear but you cannot bluff it you have to have it you cannot bluff love amen so we need it we must have it

likeness of god can we say amen hallelujah so adam had the love of god this is i'm seeing this it's not part of the quote so adam had the love of god amen the fellowship and harmony with god glory adam had dominion over every creature and over all the earth can we say amen genesis 1 glory there was perfect love he had not only the authority but the power to control glory to god amen he ruled it well he ruled it with love hallelujah oh glory to god and i believe the animals felt the love he ruled with love the earth felt the love the plants the animals the ocean nature itself felt the love

this ruler my the man that ruled with love before the fall glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it's not a quote but i'm trying to stick with what the bible said amen glory amen then sin came the true ownership of the earth never really changed because god still had it but the rulership the leadership change satan became the god of this world no wonder when satan temporarily took over and sin stepped in perfect love was gone the animals became fierce the leaves began to fall storms raged over the earth hallelujah hallelujah and praise god i i i had prepared this message since march 14th i was supposed to speak and i didn't know anything about wednesday night service amen all the quotes about the love and so on praise god so it was like wow amen praise god hallelujah
