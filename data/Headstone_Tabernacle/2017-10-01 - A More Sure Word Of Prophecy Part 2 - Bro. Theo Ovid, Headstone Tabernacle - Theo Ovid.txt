I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them when I heard him and seen I fell long to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things and he said unto me see thou do it not fire mothae soul o servant and have I brethren the prophets all of them which keep the scenes of this book worship God I

righteous still and here is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be Russian nineteen ninety ten it says earned to me write blessed the day which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him he said unto me serious not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy may God bless his word you may be seated just a little thought this evening seal not the scenes of the prophecy I love an inspiration the time is at hand what praise the name of the Lord you read a quote this morning I was down here seven thunders idle forbidden to write down who the voices and it's book was sealed the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed I hear the part now and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries were open to the church he's talking money seven thunders are because India the church prophecy would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and a mosque living among us we are then worship in the Living Christ data malas so friends your faith itself must be anointed this currency of purchase which is this faith must be anointed it has to have an applied feet and actually a feet God brother Branham was told people were told if you could get the people to believe that even cancer was done in your way so we have something but I don't think we understand the value of what we have that faith is it purchasing power shoutout purchasing power it's like you have a currency is like you have money it's like I could you need the bread you can't eat the money you'll need to get the bread the money is the purchasing power of the bread if you could get to the bakery you're gonna get the bread but in the meantime you have the pictures in power you could rejoice you can praise God you can you're hungry yes but you can be grateful because you have the purchasing power you are faced as a believer you have the purchasing power for your deliverance for your bridge route to get out of whatever in you have the purchasing power all that you are all that you ever build will be is based upon faith in his word you have to have fear to believe that God will to break you out now go get the bus y'all to watch your in you have to have it to believe that you will be healed you have that fear to believe that you will get a breakthrough that's what will lift you off that depression and that frustration you have that fear to believe that not the client if they believe dots don't believe can snow only believe oh praise the name of the Lord so do you believe that it's promised that he'll be moving in and out among us then we worship in the Living Christ hallelujah john was worship in the angel didn't say don't worship me I want to prophets him and don't worship me isn't that right hallelujah enough Christ to worship so we have no man to worship we come to worship Jesus Christ will begin to see Christ we come to worship Jesus Christ isn't that right so your faith has to be anointed to activate dynamics not just a dry fit it's a resurrection faith isn't that right praise God amen do you believe that so God praise God no listen to this you read this until see I'm moving back again I've tried I've been studying I told before the congregation I've been studying the early church and I watched the way those anointed men prepare the house of the Lord and the order of the Lord worship in the house and it struck me real good and I preached about it some time ago to the subject I'll restore and I begin the study on what these men did and the way they take care of the church that God had left them to overseer now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it about of five minutes to see what they did and then I can show you isn't the vision that I have for the future now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost I'm there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus are chosen twelve and one of them had fallen and they had to choose my tires to take his place here's the point here's the point now I'm the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it come understand this Judas was the hoff he hung himself so it was 11 they had to have 12 a to happy no Paul was ready these twelve men I was gonna find but for dynamics are strike you have to have 12 so they have to pick somebody it have a book of my tires it has nothing about Matias the chief Matthias I'm Matthias make up number twelve and then it was ready it was sent fire could fall no because everything is in order are you with me give the Lord a shout on that one though these are my words though this is a preface world God waited until they get Matthias in position for the fire to fall no this is brother Branham now he said the Holy Spirit waited until all this was in order before it can come they had to choose the bishopric of Judas that fell by transgression to fulfill Scripture and I believe here we go that all these things has a time of lingering waiting but it is waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right everything is in order Wheaton many times like a child we get impatient we have great anticipation and jump where hand and that hinders the work until the work that caught up we must move reverently have a purpose in heart to say if the Lord's will and so forth like that if he desires the users in such a way but wait until he makes an opening David had to hear the rustle of marbury tree he answer no God is going in front of him is not right children then hammocks is here today dynamics is here already in the form of the spirit of prophecy which is the testimony of Jesus and we have that today Oh hallelujah the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy that gives us the authority to know every devil up the Warner run to give us the authority to see the sick you will deal hallelujah the blind will see the Deaf gonna hear your family will be delivered by the spirit of prophecy that can't return boy you take authority by the word to prophesy from the book the book is already open we have the authority to go into the book and press the sign devil came up basilia notice get off our property get off my land give me my Mountain or give the Lord some praise as people Oh glory of God do you see it hallelujah so you have to go forward now to pick up the authority you haven't gone to claim your Mountain and the criminal inheritance and stop accepting the estate the way out right now oh my oh praise God so we can only prophesy according to the vision loosed by the spirit of prophecy oh my so Abraham received the word and anything was contrary to the world he call it a bit wasn't in other words everything with a lion symptom Sarah each their estates the rock body was lying to him I finally concerned nothing in Compton the Bible said he's tagged on another promise I've got you unbelief listen he had frustrations he had obsessed upside down with everybody else and what you would have but not at the promise because he was convinced the Bible said he was fully persuaded fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he promised tonight you've got to be fully persuaded gotta be convinced if your buddy you're feeling that's not having to do with it I have your foot not feelin it your eye not feeling it you're hot enough you're not feeling it it's not Sheila stop this it's the diva stone this my god I'm believing it's a substance that create the faith I want to sell it believe him it's a substance that create the faith thank you Lord Jesus so Jesus so but about me so back to faith he introduced the Messiah and reveal all the mysteries of God and I want to bring back this one the appearing and coming is another quote the different one of the cities one is two different things the appearing of the Lord is now the appeal appearing among his people we see him in his same work the apparent his Holy Spirit but his common here we go will be his physical being to catch the church up that's the Trump of God his coming his actual common is that right blessed be the name of the Lord want me along with you so there are five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those are called offices by God then in the local congregation there nine spiritual gifts that work among the people which include prophecy tongues interpretations and wisdom knowledge gifts of faith gives up healing all of that now in these offices and places and the offices you hear from the Apostle his ministry you hear from the Prophet his ministry from the evangelists from the teacher from the pasta each has a separate ministry so no matter PAC in all faith either here P my mind claims of all liars because I snuck the scripture it's a separate ministry and that is why God divided the land everybody can have all the land God here Judah here Ephraim here the land is divided the land got to be divided faster here prophet here teacher here evangelist here apostle here land divided to set the church in order you hear from the pasta you hear from the Apostle you hear from the prophet you hear from each ministry because Israel's you have a world to bring you to that perfection or Chloe require a ministry for ministry is a ministry for work what will fall protection of the Saints the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body till we all come in the unity of the faith or praise God isn't that right so then I'm almost done then in these offices and places you hear from the author and so forth each has a separate ministry and their ministries of God go ahead set them in a church for this purpose then God comes down in the form of the holy spirit among his congregation to speak with tongues another one interpret tells a certain thing to do and so forth then their gifts of wisdom knowledge interpretations or connect gets go to the church but the first way it has got to come first by the weight oh praise the name of the Lord did believe that so when you see the message nothing is matter you don't need interpretation and this idea you see the core thing that you have to be forming to the word image you have to get the word inside of you you're not a lesser son and somebody the higher son is sons and daughters placed in different positions hallelujah you get in calling you in the same God in this one and that one the same God Brahms and you have enough God in you you to speak in its world of existence go to our little parts I'm strong pass and repass the God is God you have a small light big like in the same light hallelujah the content of the ocean a little bottle is just as much material as what the entire ocean if you're born get a little bottle of ocean water everything in that little bottle is what the ocean having it what you have there is a measure and you have to come into the measure of the stature from a perfect man but everything is incited here all the power resided here all the glory is inside of you hallelujah all the powers inside earlier in your measure Oh give the Lord a shout glory know God do you see that do you see you of everything that the ocean has do you see you cap in your measure that's why Elijah had the feet the axe Elijah give me a double portion was the matter what I asked him for an act small he said double and then acting easysing over sudden is your man calling about W a big man question over you want to leave he said what I don't know what you have is double trouble enough to deal with so let me take the double one

Tracy's waiting for water if the devil to disconnect the season the water nothing nothing but once water hit that seed that's trouble because of me life have to manifest itself life help it it's an automatic law it's the law of God once this water hit the seal it has to it must it is necessary it is compulsory for that scene to produce itself because the law in Genesis say every seed must bring forth after its kind I wanna tell you you are different kind your different kind of species it have serpent seed annealed there looking like humans but it's not there vipers the family the snake and

seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself so friends you haven't seen me manifested yet all you've seen is prophecy all here is prophecy what we have had all these years has been the testimony

night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for us often as a this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the
