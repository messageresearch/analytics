[36:39] his presence we feel the anointing God
[36:42] bless you thank for coming out tonight
[36:44] if you have your Bibles I'd like you to
[36:46] turn to Ephesians 6 1 verse there verse
[36:48] 12 John 1 want to read from 11 to 14 and
[36:52] acts 1 verse 8 read in Ephesians 6
[36:56] verse2 and it says here for we wrestle
[36:59] not against flesh and blood but against
[37:01] principalities and against Powers
[37:04] against the rulers of Darkness of this
[37:06] world against spiritual wickedness in
[37:08] high places and we want to go to John
[37:11] chapter 1 praise the
[37:22] Lord and reading from verse 11 he came
[37:26] unto his own his own receive him not but
[37:29] as many as receive him to them give give
[37:31] he power to become the sons of God even
[37:34] to them which believe on his name which
[37:36] were born not of blood nor of the will
[37:38] of the flesh nor of the will of man but
[37:40] of God and the Word was made flesh and
[37:43] dwelt among us and we go to Acts chapter
[37:47] 1 one verse there verse 8 Jesus speaks
[37:50] but he shall receive power after that
[37:53] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he
[37:55] shall be Witnesses unto me both
[37:57] Jerusalem in all Judea in Samaria and in
[38:01] the uttermost part of the earth may God
[38:02] bless his word you may be seated oh
[38:04] praise God it's so glad to be here
[38:05] tonight always a blessing opportunity
[38:09] praise God to be in the house of God
[38:11] where we could hear present tense where
[38:14] inspiration could drop down and give
[38:16] unction to the word not just letter
[38:19] because if you play back Moses tapes
[38:20] right now is the word Elijah tapes is
[38:23] the word the scripture of Paul is the
[38:25] word but what we have here now is
[38:27] present tense when the spirit comes down
[38:29] to minister the word itself and make it
[38:32] alive and Quicken it praise God so
[38:34] tonight have a title you shall receive
[38:36] power and have inspiration who can tame
[38:39] that devil who can tame that devil the
[38:42] devil is on a rampage the devil is
[38:45] roaring the devil is doing whatever he
[38:47] wants to do like if he's in charge but
[38:50] who can tame that devil and remember the
[38:53] battle is not against flesh and blood
[38:55] the battle against principalities and po
[38:58] so you are not in a natural flesh battle
[39:00] in a battle for your soul in a battle
[39:02] for your spirit in a battle to keep the
[39:05] atmosphere you better to fight for the
[39:07] faith even the church IM man right where
[39:10] Jesus just not too long afterwards he
[39:12] said contend for the fith fight for the
[39:15] Fate because that's some ungodly men
[39:17] that come in and screw up things and
[39:19] mess up things fight for the original
[39:21] fight for what was brought to you praise
[39:24] God praise God praise God in the church
[39:27] itself
[39:27] you see things falling away and the
[39:29] prophecy was they're going to fall away
[39:31] but fight for it fight for the faith
[39:34] right down to this age God sent a
[39:36] prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[39:38] faith that he was fighting for and we
[39:41] still fighting tonight glory to God
[39:43] hallelujah we still fighting for that
[39:45] Faith because that Faith brings it more
[39:47] than a revelation but I'm say faith is
[39:49] prevailing power right Divine prevailing
[39:52] power but he we have a promise of power
[39:53] here now acts 18 that's not Revelation
[39:56] power that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[39:58] after Dynamics come upon you after the
[40:01] Holy Ghost come upon you something have
[40:02] to come upon you not upon your head but
[40:05] upon you something had to cover you like
[40:07] a robe like you drop down rain Joseph
[40:10] rainbow caught upon you oh glory to God
[40:12] something have to come upon you bride
[40:14] Church something have to come upon you
[40:16] not to your head upon you oh give the
[40:20] Lord some Praises upon you not to
[40:23] intellect upon you praise God I get what
[40:26] the other ministers say it has to come
[40:28] upon you this is a thing has to come
[40:30] upon you they were in the upper room
[40:32] they were under expectation because
[40:34] Jesus gave them Revelation he open the
[40:36] understanding to the scripture they had
[40:38] prevailing power nobody could take them
[40:40] from that anointing nobody could take
[40:42] them from that Faith but that was not
[40:44] enough oh the Lord I shout knowing a
[40:46] message is not enough having a book is
[40:48] not enough you have to receive power Oh
[40:52] Glory to God give the Lord a shout in
[40:54] the house and Jesus the Bible said he
[40:56] came to his own his own receive him not
[40:59] but as many as receive him who is him
[41:02] the word to them give you power to
[41:05] become the sons of God you don't come
[41:07] Sons by books you don't come Sons by
[41:09] tapes you come Sons by power oh give the
[41:12] Lord I shout let me say it again good
[41:15] you're not coming Son by books you're
[41:17] not coming Son by tapes you're coming
[41:19] Son by Power and Jesus said you shall
[41:23] receive PowerAll that's not man saying
[41:25] that that's not a prophet saying that
[41:28] that is word made flesh that is God
[41:30] Almighty that put the Breath of God upon
[41:33] the church and say receive the Holy
[41:35] Ghost he put the breath on top the
[41:36] church to put the church on the
[41:38] expectation of Dynamics to the
[41:41] mechanics the Lord have
[41:43] praise he is talking about men who
[41:46] preach men who win souls men who cast
[41:49] out Devils men who heal the sick he said
[41:53] Don't Preach until you get this thing
[41:56] from heaven amen Oh Glory to Lord men
[41:59] who the word open up to them who
[42:02] understanding open who have Revelation
[42:05] Hallelujah who have the knowledge and he
[42:07] tell them sit down Hallelujah don't go
[42:10] out there wait wait wait until you be
[42:17] endued with power from on high not power
[42:22] from a bishop from America not power

[43:12] promise tonight I am walking under a
[43:14] promise tonight let's go you may be
[43:20] seated my my my my
[43:23] my watch this we are like Abraham
[43:27] Abraham received the word and anything
[43:29] was contrary to the word he called it as
[43:30] if it wasn't and any true Born Again
[43:33] child of God receives the word of God I
[43:36] don't care what anybody say what the
[43:39] systems speak against the word the word
[43:41] is true anyhow then he said this God is
[43:46] obligated to meet you on the basis of
[43:50] them promises outside of them promises
[43:54] he can't meet you because you don't cut
[43:57] yourself off from him so every Minister
[44:00] every Pastor every Bishop preacher that
[44:03] move away from the promises of God they
[44:04] can cut
[44:06] off amen they preaching their own thing
[44:08] they get cut off they preaching their
[44:10] own Revelation they get cut off my duty
[44:13] is to watch what God
[44:15] promised I told this a minister he got
[44:17] shocked I said I'm not watching Jesus
[44:19] I'm watching what Jesus
[44:20] prophesied I watching the prophets

[44:29] tongues the never never said Jesus walk
[44:31] like a drunk man but the prophecy said
[44:34] they would speak in tongues the prophecy
[44:36] said they would stagger so if you

[59:11] fullness of the Holy Ghost he goes to
[59:12] the temple pick up the scripture the
[59:14] spirit is upon me for he ha anointed me
[59:16] and he read the scripture read what the
[59:18] scripture will do that was the
[59:21] text they thought he was expounding a
[59:24] text that night that day but he was the
[59:28] living text he was the Living Word the
[59:31] very word they were reading was now made
[59:34] flesh oh give the Lord a praise I this
[59:37] is this is this is too much for me
[59:40] tonight the very word they were reading
[59:42] for years the very word was laid in the
[59:44] book was now flesh in front of them and
[59:47] they were blind they couldn't see it
[59:49] because the word now was become flesh
[59:51] and the word will become flesh in you oh
[59:55] give the Lord I shout you I want you to
[59:56] say Amen on that tonight the word will
[59:59] become your flesh you will be the word
[1:00:02] made flesh the very prophecy that the
[1:00:04] prophet spoke will live itself through
[1:00:07] you oh that's why God sent a prophet
[1:00:09] that this world will live in a bunch of
[1:00:11] people called The Bride that's why he
[1:00:13] come to SW a seed that that seed may
[1:00:15] take root and go and drop into the good
[1:00:18] soil and produce
[1:00:21] fruit so don't bother what all the devil

[1:00:28] and your up and your down look at what
[1:00:29] God promised and take a hold of it look
[1:00:33] at what God say about you that's why I
[1:00:35] tell you there's power in the word and
[1:00:37] the devil trying to make you see like
[1:00:38] there's no power in the word because
[1:00:39] nothing happening that's how I see it
[1:00:41] only thing nothing happening it has to
[1:00:43] start with you it have to start with you
[1:00:45] holding on to the word tonight holding
[1:00:47] on to the word to now and believe in
[1:00:48] what God Said Jesus said you shall
[1:00:50] receive
[1:00:51] power not a man say that you know so you
[1:00:54] could look for that anytime yes you
[1:00:56] could expect that anytime power coming
[1:00:58] to you power coming upon you Jesus said
[1:01:01] the spirit is upon me he couldn't see
[1:01:03] that before before he come upon him he
[1:01:05] couldn't say that it came upon Him John
[1:01:08] saw the dove oh give the Lord a shout he
[1:01:11] saw the Spirit descending upon him as a
[1:01:16] do and he said God told him the one that
[1:01:19] is see the Spirit come upon and remain
[1:01:22] and remain some just hit and fly but

[1:02:48] it made it a hybrid creature we are born
[1:02:50] of sex human desire it's hybrid and
[1:02:53] that's the reason that God's DET in it
[1:02:55] he he said when God made his first man
[1:02:57] he never asked woman and man to get
[1:02:59] together he created him out of the earth
[1:03:02] he was a genuine plant his sin is what
[1:03:05] brought him into hybrid that's what the
[1:03:07] matter today the reason we getting so
[1:03:09] much hybrid Pentecostals you are
[1:03:11] listening to reasoning instead of the
[1:03:13] word come back there's a Gethsemane
[1:03:16] conference and the only one that could
[1:03:18] die come up to the hour and when that
[1:03:20] great time come he had to make his final
[1:03:23] decision what do we see about
[1:03:25] conferences conference come up with a
[1:03:26] decision if you have a conference with
[1:03:28] God and no decision is made something
[1:03:30] wrong yeah no conference a conference
[1:03:32] produces a decision and Jesus had a
[1:03:35] conference the father conference with
[1:03:36] his son concerning paying the price that
[1:03:39] was the offer on the table isn't that
[1:03:42] right and watch he had to make his final
[1:03:45] decision no doubt the father said are
[1:03:47] you still ready to go through it
[1:03:50] son he said it is possible father is
[1:03:53] there some other man you could find
[1:03:54] somewhere I love my people I love the
[1:03:57] Brethren you give me is it is it
[1:03:59] possible that some other man could no
[1:04:01] you the only one can do it you're the
[1:04:04] only one that's virgin born you're the
[1:04:06] only one that's born without sex no
[1:04:08] other man Bishop Pope no Cardinal no
[1:04:10] nothing can help you you are the one you
[1:04:13] are the only one that can do it then the
[1:04:16] Conference was held Satan was standing
[1:04:19] there conference going on Satan
[1:04:20] listening Satan standing there ready to
[1:04:23] claim the human race he said he had
[1:04:27] rights because they had
[1:04:29] sinned that's a big one punch Satan
[1:04:32] saying listen they you know I have
[1:04:35] rights to claim
[1:04:38] them oh God my you know there too much
[1:04:41] for me this is too much for me tonight
[1:04:43] Satan standing there looking at his
[1:04:45] rights he have rights to you know oh you
[1:04:48] didn't know that
[1:04:49] right when you s you all right
[1:04:59] he said he had rights because they had
[1:05:02] sinned so he had rights to claim the
[1:05:04] human whole human race because them
[1:05:07] Spirits is like them as spirit being
[1:05:09] without no bodies that's why they wer
[1:05:12] humans I was thinking about that today
[1:05:14] you know that these Devils could only
[1:05:16] really manifest through our next body
[1:05:19] then that why from the man with all them
[1:05:21] demons they went into the pig to do more
[1:05:23] Havoc so they they have to manifest
[1:05:25] their attributes and their behavior to
[1:05:27] human beings that's why they want the
[1:05:29] human race that's why they want to
[1:05:31] invade marriages and lives and homes and
[1:05:33] people and bodies they want that and the
[1:05:35] Holy Ghost looking to express through
[1:05:37] humans also that's why the Holy Ghost
[1:05:39] want you so you are special to God to be
[1:05:43] called aside and Sanctified to receive
[1:05:45] his spirit so you want to know God want
[1:05:48] to fill you more and you want to filling
[1:05:50] God want to step into your 16 element
[1:05:52] more than you want it Hallelujah because
[1:05:55] by and through the bride will be fulfill
[1:05:57] all Oh Glory to God God have to get in
[1:05:59] and buy through that person he get into

[1:20:25] people listen to these words Philip
[1:20:28] preached to them baptize them in the
[1:20:30] name of Jesus Christ though the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost hadn't Fallen upon none of them
[1:20:35] yet they sent up to Peter and brought
[1:20:38] him down they know they had great joy
[1:20:40] they were happy rejoicing had a great
[1:20:42] time and so on but they didn't have the
[1:20:44] Holy Ghost yet hearing isn't it Joy
[1:20:47] isn't it it's the
[1:20:51] experience you want the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] sensation we get to that
[1:20:56] not not so fast it's the experience you
[1:20:59] see they don't want to experience make
[1:21:01] them emotional they want to take dry in
[1:21:03] the message you want to be a Catholic in
[1:21:04] the message really dry cathol dry get
[1:21:07] dry
[1:21:13] standard now watch it's the experience
[1:21:17] it's the Holy Spirit it is Christ
[1:21:20] himself coming into you as a person
[1:21:25] and then he spoke about acts 10:49 we
[1:21:28] find Peter while he was speaking to the
[1:21:30] Gentiles while Peter yet spake these
[1:21:33] words the holy ghost or the
[1:21:37] Dynamics or the power we're not talking
[1:21:40] about Revelation now we talk about while
[1:21:42] he's speaking we not talking about
[1:21:43] Revelation coming on them or coming to
[1:21:46] them we talking about Holy Ghost fell on
[1:21:49] them and they were filled with the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost not the pastor spirit

[1:22:08] church and you see the Same
[1:22:11] Spirit while Peter SP this word fell on
[1:22:13] them for they heard them speak in
[1:22:15] tongues and magnify God and Peter said
[1:22:17] can we forbid water seeing they have
[1:22:20] received the Holy Ghost like we did at
[1:22:22] the beginning amen so that experience
[1:22:25] that the Cornelius had was the same
[1:22:27] thing Peter had amen it was no different
[1:22:30] but this time it came out the mouth of a
[1:22:33] GTI
[1:22:35] son it came out the mouth of a son that
[1:22:37] was in the body so it wasn't Peter's
[1:22:40] voice God it wasn't just words come out

[1:29:12] morning that has emptied themselves up

[1:29:17] in their own thoughts in their own
[1:29:19] ability trusting in the shrewdness of
[1:29:21] their own simple human mind which is
[1:29:23] nothing but filthiness before God may

[1:29:30] the spirit granted Lord there's only one
[1:29:32] thing left father that I can see that
[1:29:34] either you rise up somewhere with some

[1:32:19] Thunder against the enemy not mystery

[1:32:24] he said the devil don't care how loud
[1:32:25] you holler the devil don't care how much
[1:32:27] you jump up and down how much you can
[1:32:29] shout or do this what hurts the
[1:32:33] devil What Hurts The Devil is to see
[1:32:37] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[1:32:40] God say anything to him call him
[1:32:43] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[1:32:46] move right on my that chose them away
[1:32:49] that's the
[1:32:50] Thunder that shake the devil we want
[1:32:53] seven of that
[1:32:56] one we don't want Thunders that door
[1:33:00] Shake we want the Thunders that shake
[1:33:02] the devil you see Jesus oh God in the
[1:33:06] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:33:08] God the Word was God that was logos word
[1:33:12] and if I get it tonight that's living
[1:33:15] word it's not just text people getting
[1:33:19] misunderstand what that why he has
[1:33:21] telling them you have the Tex
[1:33:24] but you wouldn't come to me that you
[1:33:25] might have
[1:33:28] life now the text is the word the text
[1:33:32] is God in print but he was the Living
[1:33:34] Word he was the text made flesh yes sir
[1:33:38] and when the text made flesh it brings
[1:33:40] light on the text of the
[1:33:43] word so you say all the time you're in
[1:33:45] the light but when I come you reject me
[1:33:47] you go in darkness because I am the
[1:33:50] Fulfillment of what you reading in the
[1:33:52] book The text you are reading I am that
[1:33:55] and you could see how the bride will be
[1:33:57] rejected in this message because people
[1:33:59] have their own interpretation of how
[1:34:00] this would fulfill when the bride begin
[1:34:02] to Manifest this word they they reject
[1:34:04] her because the church have to reject
[1:34:07] the bride before the Press
[1:34:08] comes that's a hidden
[1:34:13] Mystery the Believers The Scribe and
[1:34:15] Pharisees rejected Jesus you know before
[1:34:18] pilot and the boys and them take over to
[1:34:19] press them down you the church World
[1:34:22] rejected the Christ in know well the
[1:34:26] church world will reject the bride in
[1:34:29] this message first
[1:34:31] am have to come against it I when to
[1:34:33] come against it the spirit to go outside
[1:34:39] now you say if I could preach like Billy
[1:34:41] Graham or Roberts or a great influential
[1:34:44] speaker some sometime the devil just
[1:34:46] laughs at that he don't pay no more
[1:34:48] attention than that like nothing you
[1:34:50] could get all the theology you want all
[1:34:52] the Seminary training and the devil just
[1:34:54] sit back and laugh at it but when he
[1:34:56] sees that
[1:34:57] life look at those disciples come down
[1:34:59] here that Maniac child with with
[1:35:01] epilepsy saying come out of heav devil
[1:35:03] come out of him come out of him the
[1:35:04] devil sitting there said no aren't you
[1:35:06] making a pretty shame of yourself you
[1:35:08] see what you're doing Jesus told you he
[1:35:11] commissioned you to cast me out I'm not
[1:35:12] one of you can do
[1:35:14] it so the devil was challenging them but
[1:35:17] here come Jesus here come a life Here
[1:35:20] Come Those voices here come some
[1:35:22] thunders walk from off the mountain
[1:35:25] devil had to pack up and Shop so
[1:35:27] therefore this word is active it's
[1:35:30] spoken it's a Living Word isn't that
[1:35:32] right so therefore in the beginning that
[1:35:35] word logos was made flesh and dwelt
[1:35:38] Among Us isn't that right for the word
[1:35:40] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:35:43] any two-edged sword so B used to quote
[1:35:45] this word and then go into the
[1:35:47] discernment showing the word is alive
[1:35:49] the word is God it's not how you say it
[1:35:53] uh the men mental telepathy it wasn't
[1:35:55] something he doing some kind of funny
[1:35:57] business it was God the word Discerning
[1:36:00] and telling people he could go back in
[1:36:02] your life and see where you make
[1:36:03] mistakes what happened and where you
[1:36:04] live and whatnot it had a one experience
[1:36:07] when somebody when tell him where
[1:36:09] somebody live and somebody thought it
[1:36:11] was a lie because they know the person
[1:36:13] somebody else and when they query it she
[1:36:15] said oh I forget to tell you a movie on
[1:36:17] her but God know where every fly B his
[1:36:21] ey God know the P present future he the
[1:36:27] one could only scope that the devil
[1:36:28] can't go back there he could go right
[1:36:30] back isn't that right praise the name of
[1:36:32] the Lord so the Bible talk about in Luke
[1:36:34] 4 they were astonished at his Doctrine
[1:36:38] for his word was with power it wasn't
[1:36:41] just the teaching you understand he is
[1:36:44] preaching and them guys being a paron
[1:36:46] and open up the roof and lower him
[1:36:49] down Jesus say oh God oh God give me
[1:36:52] some books here um you know load him up
[1:36:54] with some books and tapes no Jesus
[1:36:57] didn't talk that he come to manifest the
[1:36:59] word thy sins be forgiven thee Oh God
[1:37:01] that that they can't handle that now
[1:37:04] that's the word he presenting
[1:37:06] forgiveness to the man he say which one
[1:37:07] is easier he said man just pick up a bed
[1:37:09] and
[1:37:10] walk you understand what I'm saying then
[1:37:12] and the man pick up his bed and walk
[1:37:14] walk and God was vindicating what Jesus
[1:37:16] was preaching that coming back every
[1:37:19] service every service they will see the
[1:37:21] word being Vindicated the word word
[1:37:23] being confirmed brother had that we will
[1:37:27] have that as I were with Malachi 4 so
[1:37:29] will I with Ephesians 4 do you believe
[1:37:31] that you see if deep call to deep B say

[1:39:19] about the people who took revelation God
[1:39:21] became the living epis of all men
[1:39:24] the word was lost for organization tend
[1:39:25] to watch dogma and Creeds are not simple
[1:39:28] word they could no longer speak for God
[1:39:30] G Wesley he was the voice with the word
[1:39:32] in his day the people who took his
[1:39:34] Revelation from God became the living
[1:39:36] Epistles watch this the people who took
[1:39:37] wesle Revelation became the living
[1:39:39] epistle read and known of all men for
[1:39:41] their generation when the Methodist
[1:39:42] failed God raised up others so it has
[1:39:44] gone through the years until the last
[1:39:46] day there's again another people in the
[1:39:48] land who under their Messenger will be
[1:39:51] the final voice to the final age that
[1:39:53] mean the tape will not be press play
[1:39:56] will not be the books will not be a
[1:39:59] people will be the final voice I want to
[1:40:02] repeat that not press play not tape not
[1:40:04] books because people will not need the
[1:40:06] books when we have to identify Messiah
[1:40:10] the woman at the well tell Jesus she
[1:40:11] said we know when Mah this thing he said
[1:40:13] I speak he don't talk no book and
[1:40:15] texting and Jerusalem don't talk about
[1:40:17] that talk I talk the father seeketh such
[1:40:21] to worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:40:23] this is the reality now so when the
[1:40:25] seeds open it brings a reality the Bible
[1:40:27] itself becomes a new book as Isaac says
[1:40:29] are you with me now yes sir so there's a
[1:40:31] people in the land who under their
[1:40:32] Messenger will be the final verse to the
[1:40:34] final age yes sir the church in the
[1:40:36] message is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:40:37] God it is his own mouthpiece that why
[1:40:40] ministers preaching all kind of crazy
[1:40:41] Revelation and sprinkling with a like
[1:40:44] it's salt but it's really their message
[1:40:45] they preaching right so go because the
[1:40:48] spirit the prophet and the bride will
[1:40:49] say the same thing amen you have to be
[1:40:51] able to hear back what you are hearing
[1:40:53] back in the message I can come and tell
[1:40:55] dream last night and unfold the dream
[1:40:57] and this mean this and this mean that
[1:40:58] and I have no dreams to dream last night
[1:41:01] watch so God is turning on her people in
[1:41:04] the church he will confound her through
[1:41:06] the prophet and the bride for here we go
[1:41:08] the voice of God will be in her sir do
[1:41:11] you get that the voice of God was in
[1:41:14] Peter the voice of God was in Paul the
[1:41:17] voice of God was in the early church the
[1:41:19] voice of God will not be in the books it
[1:41:21] will be in the bride amen because the
[1:41:23] bride has to be given a voice to fulfill
[1:41:26] Revelation 227 the spirit and the bride
[1:41:29] say for the bride to say she has to have
[1:41:32] a voice oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:41:35] then he said this he quot it right here
[1:41:38] he quote ration 17 the spirit right say
[1:41:40] come once more the world will hear
[1:41:43] direct from God as at the Pentecost at
[1:41:46] Pentecost they didn't play a tape they
[1:41:48] didn't make out a scroll Peter said this
[1:41:50] is the stone you Builders refuse and a
[1:41:53] bride will identify this is the seven
[1:41:55] Thunders rejected as the Cornerstone
[1:41:57] which is the Bap Holy Ghost it has
[1:41:59] returned now as The Headstone and the
[1:42:01] stone the B refuse is what become The
[1:42:03] Headstone of the corner Oh Glory to God
[1:42:05] because the seven tunders is more than
[1:42:07] just a revelation he said what we see
[1:42:09] should make a church that will make a
[1:42:11] Revival that they could say the seven T
[1:42:12] being manifested so the seven tund is
[1:42:14] supposed to produce a manifestation of
[1:42:17] what of mysteries what Mysteries oh give
[1:42:20] the Lord a praise hallu once more
[1:42:23] the world will hear direct from God I'm
[1:42:26] going to skip down there are so much
[1:42:28] voices today in the earth I watch it
[1:42:30] causes the voice of God to be pushed
[1:42:31] back begin to play something and the
[1:42:33] voice of God they say how will we know
[1:42:35] it's the voice of God
[1:42:36] today then it wasn't the Vindicated
[1:42:39] Prophet today how will we know is the
[1:42:41] voice of God because it will be a
[1:42:44] manifestation of the prophet's word this
[1:42:47] is God's prophet and the true voice of
[1:42:49] God will only bring back that real
[1:42:52] living Supernatural god with the
[1:42:53] supernatural word and Supernatural
[1:42:55] manifestation of through it amen so
[1:42:58] friends what I'm saying the
