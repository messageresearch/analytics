of us here but we know that God where the two and trees are gathered God is in the midst a man pre God loves the twos and trees amen amen it's intimate and he could speak to us and talk to us by the way and woo are hearts closer to him amen please go and sometimes you know the crowds and God gets lost in it and you know the people they get all caught up in the numbers and you think that that's that's gone amen priests good but God loves when you when you when you get closer to him and he maybe you set aside time goal doesn't mind the numbers he may and praise God it could be hundred it could be two it could be ten thousand priests go but God moves at individuals amen praise God so people's perception of amen you know they think they see a lot of people and that's a wonderful thing but Amen God can do something right in the midst of us here tonight please God so I don't want you to lose faith tonight a man God is here a man regardless praise God praise God of the situation's around us we know that we have a few challenges tonight and we said one remember but the Hugh Williams and pray he was a feeling well tonight and he had to suffer from some swelling in the foot he man

that's our feet tonight and that's what we'd acclaim well I have a title tonight a man based on a script we read and Revelation chapter 3 and this 18 and I have a title called the evening time message amen and I have a small subject to him that overcometh a man priests gone and taking it right out of the scripture tonight as it was and it was kind of on my mind for a little while and I thought well maybe tonight that Amen we had the opportunity to speak that cordwood kind of spit our hearts tonight amen and but I really wanted to focus on that overcoming part even because I feel that's that's that's where we plug in praise gone that's where we draw strength from praise gone because the people of God praise God the people and know they're gone shall be strong and they will do great exploits praise God so if we're not strong and we're not doing great exploits then it means that we haven't come to our fullest potential yet but that word is a prophecy that had spoke over you tonight praise go regardless of how you feel regardless of how you see yourself you are overcomer tonight because that is the people that will be in the end time praise gone him and a prophet said there'll be such a people a man the prophet got so excited he said it was so close he could almost taste it you wish he could live to see it a man but God didn't allow him to see it praise God God took his prophet off the scene Amen sort of prophet is not here but the voice is still on the earth a man a man that voice that prophetic voice that hallelujah spoke that a bride will come into view in this evening in this evening tea hallelujah praise in it's evening time in this message and God would have a people on the earth like no other people praise corny man and those people with two great exploits amen is run and not be weary they will walk and not faint they will pray and it was fun because God will be upon them would it be in their hearts I'm God will anoint the within their hearts God will mount a bride hallelujah in the last day and ride her down into the resurrection oh do you believe it tonight praise God hallelujah praise God so I promise a mighty victory in the scripture the bride hasn't had a revival yet but it'll take these seven unknown thunders to wake her up he'll send it he promised it and I love a burro would brought on Sunday seven living voices amen thundering out in the bride in sweetness and in humility in power right and that's what you promised in the last day that's what's going to be praise God in this evening time when the evening shadows of the world is falling upon us a man is now a man we can look around and see the signs of his coming signs of his coming all around praise gone the red light is flashing as it was amen amen hallelujah dangers on the approach but we thank God that he sent a prophet with a warning hallelujah God always sends a warning before Judgment court always has a mercy hallelujah to go out before the people shall I had hide from Abraham what I am about to to in the last day hallelujah Oh chorus about to pull off I'm sorry manga more NRA hallelujah but God sent a word Holly warning halleluyah halleluyah is not right to abraham because of who he was and because of who you are tonight cause sena profits he's happy hall to you malachite for Elijah the prophets Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah turn the hospital children back to the faith of our fathers and it is these really Brian revealed mischief roots that literally trots back to the people of fathers oh those he finally revealed mystery truths Oh hallelujah by fate tonight o holid that these seven messages these seven angels that brought seven messages to seven church ages are the seven thunders hallelujah don't wake us up Oh hallelujah when

time message Amen hallelujah and we know that God always send a messenger at the end of the age Amen to blast the AG man and to bring a prophesy of what was to come is now right and that was Malachi forum come down at the end of ladies here there please go past any man is nothing heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God isn't alright but he was prophesying standing there in the breech prophecy sign of a pride I was supposed to come on the scene praise God and manifests all these promises that's hidden in the scripture a man is named hallelujah hallelujah praise God all right so we had to recognize our dear no message and we thank God for sending us a prophet to show us all day and no message a man to show us that time that we were living in and I love our beloved brought out Sunday at Luton Wesley and all these reformers was living out something and they didn't know but God was rising up in them with a faith with a message it's not right each one a star in the right hand of God and then God was using them blasting out at every age they were blasting out something but no one knew the whole picture of it yet they were just to learn out isn't that right every age Thunder now a thunder and a thunders a voice of God and all right so it's a voice of God in every age and it was seeing something but the whole picture wasn't reveal yet oh it wasn't seen yet in terms of what God was doing Tanner took the Prophet calm down the entity Ainge and show what was going on all the time what God was building up to praise got into position the pride hallelujah on what her ministry would be please go to the end of all these things praise gone and all be gathered up into the son of man hallelujah annotated when we living in a time of the revelation of these things being made known praise God which means to whom much is given much is expected so tonight we have a much to expect tonight we have a revival to expect we have an outpouring to expect we have dynamics to expect we have all children being delivered to be expected for we have the backsliders being restored are we are missing limbs to be restored that's what we are not expectation for tonight H brings expectation owners gives you pitch then it brings expectation for the true promise of the holy spirit to pour out upon the church as was promised by Malachi for profit so we're not just believing for a revival but theory fire that was promised in the last day amen hallelujah a 7-ton revival that would manifest all these promises have we looking to see happen in the church amen so we hit the pre tonight we don't call upon God are we here to pull a man from the angel tonight a man praise God because we can't do it in ourselves but it would take go on to make these things known hallelujah is not evil God manifests himself it would take God to prove his own word he spoke his word all these years he spoke his word over your life he spoke his word into your heart but not that same God lets him go to promised Abraham that he gave him a son that same God come down now and it's evening time to prove what he said it took car to turn back the clock on Sarah it's a car to turn back the clock on Abraham it took God to transform them to bring the pass of promise and he had upon them hallelujah Abraham could do it himself but what he could do was hold seed on believe in knowing that God was able to fulfill oh it took 25 years but Abraham's feat was right oh right to the promise right to the spoken word of God right to what courts had right to the prophecy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and all faith is Right tonight that these signs shall follow them that believe what signs the Holy Ghost healing pouring the Holy Spirit's baptism of the Holy Ghost signs one of the miracles the

fighting up praise God quarreling with these brethren who have no revelation can't get up man hallelujah I want to speak to you I want to speak to you praise God hallelujah let me talk to you for a few moments where was time when I laid a foundation layer well as thou in the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy who are these morning stars they were the sons of God from before the beginning early on when chop saw a revelation he saw himself up there with those morning stars shouting for joy shouting for worship that's why we worship down here because we are represented up in those stars tonight there's a star with your name on it praise hallelujah Oh glory hallelujah come on you morning sauce shine for joy shout for joy all right hallelujah job said I know my Redeemer liveth yet in my flesh I shall see him though the skin worms destroy this body praise God nothing I go to in this life could ever compare with a glory beyond the sky with the glory that's upon those morning stars hallelujah praise God a man before God does anything on earth he shows it up in the heavens verse those stars always reflect the oncoming Sun something is about to take place when Jesus was to get ready to be born those stars begin to line up Halle is now right and that's what let those wise men on a two-year journey hallelujah all the way from wherever they come praise God when it come to they come to the Messiah where is he born King of the Jews the Holy One amen the one I was prophesied the one that the stars foretold oh in watching those stars all these years they were watching themselves a long time and when they see the sign of his coming they begin to pack their bags they begin to pack their camels they say brothers we must go and see a revival upon them a revival of expectancy because they were expecting to see the Messiah oh and they got what they came for they found him in Bethlehem and they came and worshiped they came on around the baby king of the Jews or the creature of God the heavens tongue and flesh oh they had to worship they had to shout they had to scream they was making noise in the desert why because I've seen the Son of man coming in a sign Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my it's not right God is talking at your Brown he said come out Ibrahim said oh how can I be the father of Nations seeing I go childless God said come out I want to show you something they look up at those stars up there what do you see the countless stars he says so shall thy seed be as the stars of the heaven Oh hallelujah all those sons of God up

hallelujah those morning sounds were coming on isn't that right coming on to something what are you doing we're reflecting an oncoming Sun isn't that right many many men hallelujah amen praise God so my time here pretty school you man you love him tonight okay please call him and let me read this here quick from recognizing a dania message he said now on the papers he said you'll only get the six ages because it's allowed easier Church was blacked out completely he said now if you would notice the spiritual application as God set in oh man okay as God set it into heaven and when I set out there I left a little bitty space as you see just a teeny bit of light he said that was just before the very elect was to be called from the earth he said the reason I placed it on me it's a prophecy no he said the reason I place that slit of light and low DC there all right on the 7h for the 7h he said but when God put it in the heavens it was totally blocked out it means maybe the last one is call from that loud Eason Ange we don't know he said that could be a sermon on it he said but if that tree ever puts for another original branch or the best original fruit there it's got to be a restoration of all these things all these signs and wonders all these miracles hallelujah all he's moving on the spirit there's gonna be a restoration of all these things amen amen hallelujah and worried about what a prophet had the sentiment of spirit and healing a sick reason at that God is gonna restore all of these things what's gonna bring it back to the church Oh prophet said I represent that 5'4 ministry by way of a divine gift but when dr. his perfect has come God will have a ministry on the urge displaying himself God dresses himself in his commanding officers his faithful ministries and he'll be on the urge healing the sick raising the dead God moving here and there praise God moving in and out among us it'll be the living Christ a man you love it a man that's right
