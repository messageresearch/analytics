[43:32] god bless you this morning and welcome
[43:35] to service this morning if you have your
[43:38] bibles thank you by anthony thank you
[43:41] musicians
[43:42] would you tune with me to one portion of
[43:44] scripture reading isaiah 6
[43:47] reading from verse 1 to 8 inclusive
[43:51] isaiah 6 and verse 1.
[43:56] and isaiah 6 1 in the year that king
[44:00] uzziah died
[44:01] i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[44:05] throne high
[44:06] and lifted up and his train filled the
[44:09] temple
[44:11] above its to the seraphims each one had
[44:13] six wings with twain he covered his face
[44:16] and with twain he covered his feet and
[44:19] with twain he did fly
[44:20] and one cried unto another and said holy
[44:23] holy holy is the lord of hosts the
[44:26] whole earth is full of his glory
[44:29] and the posts of the door moved at the
[44:32] voice of him that crying and the house
[44:34] was filled with smoke then said i was me
[44:38] for i am
[44:38] undone because i am a man of unclean
[44:41] lips and i dwell
[44:42] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[44:45] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[44:48] lord of hosts
[44:49] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[44:51] having a live
[44:52] coal in his hand which he had taken with
[44:55] the tongues from off the altar
[44:57] and he laid it upon my mouth and said
[44:59] lord this had touched my lips
[45:01] and an iniquity is taken away and i sin
[45:04] purge
[45:05] also i heard the voice of the lord
[45:07] saying whom
[45:09] shall i send and who will go for us then
[45:11] said i
[45:12] here i am send me may the lord at a
[45:15] blessing
[45:16] to the reading of his word you may be
[45:18] seated this morning in the presence of
[45:20] the lord
[45:21] and it's certainly a great privilege to
[45:23] be in the house of the lord this morning
[45:25] to take time away from what's not
[45:28] important to spend time doing what is
[45:30] most
[45:31] important because we appreciate as sons
[45:34] and daughters of god that we are here
[45:36] temporarily
[45:37] temporarily to prove to the devil that
[45:40] even though this is satan's eden
[45:42] that this bride will not be deceived
[45:46] will not be like eve and in the midst of
[45:48] the sin
[45:49] in the midst of the evil in the midst of
[45:51] the adultery and the fornication and
[45:53] spiritual wickedness in high places that
[45:56] god is pulling out a bride out of
[45:59] satan's eden god is
[46:00] pulling out a people for his name's sake
[46:04] and he is more than able to do it he has
[46:07] done it before and he can do it again
[46:10] in every age and every dispensation in
[46:13] every season god has always
[46:15] had a witness he has always had somebody
[46:18] who he could send forth whether
[46:20] reluctantly or willingly he has had
[46:22] somebody that he could send forth when
[46:24] moses
[46:25] was here moses was somewhat reluctant he
[46:27] said i can't talk
[46:29] i can speak but but he still went forth
[46:31] because
[46:32] he was sent for a purpose gideon had his
[46:35] own complexes but god will always have a
[46:37] witness so
[46:38] rather willing or unwilling whether
[46:41] reluctant
[46:42] or pushed like jonah he had a ministry
[46:45] and he
[46:46] ran away from it he was the unwilling
[46:48] prophet but if god has called you for
[46:50] something whether you are
[46:51] willing or unwilling whether you are
[46:54] prepared or unprepared whether
[46:56] you feel like it or don't feel like it
[46:58] when god puts his hand upon you there is
[47:00] nothing that you could do
[47:02] about it because he calls base on his
[47:05] foreknowledge
[47:06] and his foreknowledge allows him to see
[47:08] what you cannot see
[47:10] his foreknowledge allows him to
[47:12] understand what you don't yet
[47:14] understand because his ability is to see
[47:17] your future
[47:18] his ability to see your past your
[47:20] present his ability is to know what you
[47:22] dreamt
[47:23] last night that you can't even remember
[47:25] because he knows everything about you
[47:27] he is concerned about the animals he is
[47:29] concerned about who's in government
[47:32] he is concerned about where you work he
[47:34] is concerned upon where you live
[47:36] he is concerned about what you ate he is
[47:39] concerned
[47:39] what happens tomorrow and he is able to
[47:42] factor
[47:43] every single thing into his plan and he
[47:45] is able to make
[47:46] all things work together for good to
[47:48] them that love
[47:49] god to them who are he called according
[47:51] to his purpose
[47:53] and the love to god you couldn't even
[47:55] put it in your heart
[47:57] because you could never understand love
[47:59] because he is love it takes a while
[48:01] to reach the kind of love that he had
[48:04] when you didn't even know him
[48:05] he still loved you when you had not met
[48:08] him he still loved you
[48:10] before you were born and you could even
[48:12] come to consciousness
[48:14] of who you were his love left glory
[48:17] and sent his son to die for you when you
[48:19] could not even appreciate it
[48:21] he died for you when you could not say
[48:24] thank you
[48:24] he died for you when you couldn't write
[48:27] your name up
[48:28] he died for you when you didn't even
[48:30] know yourself
[48:33] somebody say man hallelujah
[48:37] so don't let the suffering of this
[48:39] present time weigh you down
[48:42] for you to stay in spiritual amnesia
[48:45] it's one thing to have spiritual amnesia
[48:48] it's another thing to stay in spiritual
[48:50] amnesia
[48:51] we were born in spiritual amnesia we
[48:54] were born not knowing who we were
[48:56] we were poor not knowing who our father
[48:58] is we were born not knowing that we were
[49:01] royalty
[49:02] we were born not knowing that we were
[49:04] sons of the king we were
[49:05] born not knowing that royalty was
[49:08] flowing through our veins
[49:09] we were born could not appreciate of who
[49:12] our heritage was and
[49:14] understand that david and joshua and
[49:16] everyone who went before
[49:18] wish they could have been here we were
[49:19] born not understanding that
[49:22] because we forgot where we were we
[49:24] forgot where we came from
[49:26] and the same way god had to remind job
[49:29] where was thou when i laid the
[49:31] foundation of the earth
[49:33] morningstar sang together we are here
[49:35] this morning to be reminded
[49:37] of where we come from reminded of where
[49:40] we are going
[49:41] reminded of what's for us that's greater
[49:44] than what's against us
[49:46] that there's a power in you that your
[49:48] situation cannot stop
[49:50] there's a power in you that your past
[49:52] cannot stop
[49:53] there's a power in you that your
[49:55] mistakes cannot stop
[49:57] there's a power in you that your
[49:58] children cannot stop
[50:00] there's a power in you that your bank
[50:02] account cannot stop
[50:03] there's a power in you then your boss
[50:06] cannot stop
[50:06] there's a power in you that hypocrisy
[50:09] cannot stop
[50:10] there's a power in you that your sin
[50:12] cannot stop
[50:13] because the sin that you have in your
[50:15] members was already
[50:16] conquered by the mighty conqueror and he
[50:19] said because i live
[50:21] not because you live but because i live
[50:23] up you will live also
[50:25] you are the result of his life you are
[50:28] the result of his ministry
[50:30] you are the result of his victory you
[50:33] are the result of his overcoming
[50:35] and because he overcame you could
[50:37] overcome
[50:38] because he is victorious you could have
[50:41] the victory
[50:42] because oh somebody help me this morning
[50:55] [Applause]
[50:58] hallelujah so don't look next to you
[51:01] don't look who's around you that's
[51:03] totally unimportant this morning
[51:08] don't look backward don't look forward
[51:10] don't look left or right i want you to
[51:11] look up
[51:14] look up because that's where your
[51:15] redemption coming from your redemption
[51:18] is not coming from the pulpit your
[51:19] redemption is coming from god
[51:21] god will move every prop around your
[51:23] life he will move everything you're
[51:24] leaning on until you could only trust
[51:26] him
[51:28] he is not compromising his trust he's
[51:31] not compromising his love
[51:33] because this is bright time and because
[51:35] it's bright time
[51:36] it means it's an understanding of his
[51:38] husband time also
[51:39] because bride and husband have to become
[51:41] one can the church say man
[51:45] everybody feeling fine so i promise you
[51:48] today i'll not be
[51:49] too long with you i have a sunday school
[51:52] message
[51:53] this morning to steal our hearts to
[51:56] remembrance
[51:57] and to make us conscious of not only the
[52:00] battle that we face
[52:02] but the gravity of the situation that we
[52:05] are in this morning and i believe it's a
[52:07] crossroads for us how many appreciate
[52:09] that over this morning and the
[52:11] services for the last few services
[52:14] every service a masterpiece
[52:18] and i shared with him what my thought
[52:20] was going to be
[52:21] this morning so i want to take a title
[52:25] this morning
[52:26] woe is me for i am
[52:30] undone reading from isaiah
[52:34] 6 verse 5 and we understand that
[52:38] and we have heard it and i'll just talk
[52:40] for a bit
[52:42] that it is impossible for your walk
[52:46] with god to be
[52:49] one that's really genuine until you have
[52:51] an experience
[52:52] with god you could read about god you
[52:56] could know about god and until you have
[52:58] your own
[52:59] individual experience with god it's just
[53:02] heresy
[53:06] it is just hearsay you are
[53:10] rejoicing perhaps on what somebody else
[53:12] went through
[53:14] and you hear what peter went through and
[53:16] what moses went through and
[53:18] how david had an experience and moses
[53:20] had an experience and joshua had an
[53:22] experience and brother
[53:23] branham had an experience and the
[53:25] experiences over the years since the
[53:27] prophet
[53:28] left and yes they are an encouragement
[53:29] to us but
[53:31] all of that until it becomes an
[53:34] experience with
[53:35] us and god it's just hearsay
[53:39] but ibrahim said he said you cannot be
[53:41] warmed by a painted fire
[53:44] so knowing what happened over the years
[53:47] is great information it is a great
[53:51] understanding and there are those who
[53:52] have specialized and gotten their phds
[53:55] in
[53:55] church history but church history
[53:57] without a personal experience with god
[53:59] is just that church history
[54:01] and our whole desire is to have an
[54:03] experience
[54:05] with god moses had an understanding that
[54:09] that he was one of them doubles and he
[54:12] made his limited attempt to
[54:14] bring some kind of relief and he ended
[54:16] up killing one man and
[54:17] ran away and he had basically given up
[54:21] on his
[54:22] ministry given up on his objective given
[54:25] up on his burden because his
[54:27] human effort had failed but when he had
[54:29] an experience with god
[54:31] via meeting the burning bush there was a
[54:33] transformation that he could not undo
[54:37] and you cannot undo an experience with
[54:39] god
[54:40] you cannot reset an experience with god
[54:43] it will change you forever
[54:44] so if you find yourself struggling
[54:47] trying to
[54:48] make sense of what's going on in your
[54:49] life you need an experience and
[54:51] and if you have had one experience there
[54:54] is room for another experience and
[54:56] another experience and and and there's
[54:58] room to be filled and there's room to be
[55:00] refilled and and refilled and refill
[55:03] them
[55:04] and the room filled once more again with
[55:06] the present and the spirit of god
[55:08] can the church say amen
[55:12] moses had an experience joshua had an
[55:15] experience before he could go and deal
[55:16] with jericho
[55:18] there in his alone time here's nobody
[55:20] around him he's meditating wondering
[55:23] how to take it he is trying to figure it
[55:25] out because it's human nature
[55:27] to try to figure it out every time we
[55:29] wake up in the day we're trying to
[55:31] figure out how to live
[55:32] how to make it how to make ends meet how
[55:35] to pay the bills it
[55:36] it's in our nature to figure stuff out
[55:38] how to get marriage for work how to
[55:40] save more money how to fix the car how
[55:43] to make it through the traffic
[55:44] how to buy food how to cook everything
[55:47] is about figuring it out
[55:48] and joshua was there trying to figure it
[55:50] out he didn't have an experience but all
[55:53] of a sudden
[55:54] the captain or the chief captain came by
[55:57] to give him an encounter with god of
[56:00] hosts and
[56:03] and joshua as any vigil and soldier will
[56:06] do
[56:06] drew his sword and challenge one time
[56:09] because
[56:09] he want to make sure that he's done
[56:11] being deceived he wants to make sure
[56:13] that nothing slipped past him so he
[56:15] asked the question are you for us
[56:17] oh are you against us are you for our
[56:19] purpose
[56:20] are you for our plan because i want you
[56:22] to know we're about to take over jericho
[56:24] if you don't know it i'm here meditating
[56:26] on how to take these people
[56:29] to the land that was promised so are you
[56:31] for that or are you
[56:32] against that because if you are against
[56:35] the rapture and the resurrection and
[56:37] you are against perfection and adoption
[56:39] and you are against the manifestation of
[56:41] the sons of god
[56:42] then we have means and ways to deal with
[56:44] it but if you
[56:45] are trying to make it to canaan's land
[56:48] and you are
[56:48] trying to overcome them separate
[56:51] yourself from the world and
[56:52] [Applause]
[56:55] you may be seated
[56:59] and the angel of the lord responded i'm
[57:01] the chief captain
[57:03] i'm the one with the plan i'm the one
[57:05] who already has the tape of what already
[57:07] took place so
[57:08] i'm coming to just rewind the tape for
[57:11] you so you could know
[57:12] how to approach it we already know what
[57:15] you need to do
[57:16] we already know how you need to approach
[57:18] it so you don't have to worry anymore
[57:20] because i've come to give you a set plan
[57:22] on how to overcame this situation that
[57:24] you are trying to figure out on your job
[57:27] i'm come to give you plans from the
[57:29] world on how to deal with the situation
[57:31] that you're trying to figure out
[57:33] in your family this mountain that's in
[57:36] front of you this wall that's in front
[57:38] of you this
[57:39] barrier that in front of you there's
[57:40] jericho in your life
[57:42] and the angel gave him what he needed to
[57:45] do
[57:47] an experience with god gideon had an
[57:50] experience with god
[57:51] the mighty man of allah he didn't
[57:53] believe it just like many people come
[57:55] the series this morning
[57:56] and no matter what we say or what we
[57:58] preach it is all on an
[58:00] intellectual level
[58:04] until gideon say well listen if show me
[58:07] something give me a sign give me an
[58:08] experience give me something that i
[58:09] could rest my feet on
[58:12] because you have to have some of the
[58:13] rest your feet on that is between you
[58:16] and god alone nobody else has to know
[58:18] this is
[58:18] this is you and god and your confidence
[58:21] something that you rest your feet on
[58:23] because if your faith
[58:24] is on the pastor and something happens
[58:26] to the pastor then your faith will fail
[58:28] if your faith is on your mother or your
[58:30] father then if they are not there then
[58:31] your faith will fail
[58:33] that's why people backslide because
[58:34] their faith was on something that could
[58:36] not
[58:37] last but if your faith is on an
[58:39] experience a personal experience with
[58:41] god
[58:41] whether the pastor goes whatever it
[58:44] takes
[58:46] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[58:49] name of the lord
[58:51] brother francis can i get a little bit
[58:52] more on the monitors please thank you
[58:58] paul had an experience that was so
[59:01] powerful to him he actually kept it a
[59:03] secret
[59:04] for 14 years until the corinthians
[59:07] dragged it out of him
[59:09] so personal so unbelievable that he
[59:12] never said anything about it
[59:14] it was an experience where he was caught
[59:16] up in heaven to the paradise
[59:18] of god where he heard divine secrets
[59:20] that was almost beyond the capability of
[59:23] man to utter and even when he started to
[59:26] express it
[59:27] he shared it as if he was somebody else
[59:29] he was talking about
[59:31] he said i know a man in christ who 14
[59:33] years ago was caught up in the third
[59:35] heaven
[59:36] and the way he was talking about it they
[59:38] could have thought that he was talking
[59:39] about somebody else
[59:40] it was only after a while they realized
[59:43] that he was sharing an
[59:44] experience that he had what experience
[59:48] have you had
[1:00:00] the church say amen keep your mottos
[1:00:02] coming
[1:00:03] i'm not going to be too long with you
[1:00:06] but we're going somewhere this morning
[1:00:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:17] hallelujah if you have your bibles let's

[1:00:21] school

[1:00:26] corinthians 12.
[1:00:28] and verse 1.
[1:00:33] second corinthians 12 verse 1 it is not
[1:00:35] expedient for me doubtless to glory
[1:00:38] i will come to visions and revelations
[1:00:40] of the lord
[1:00:41] i knew a man in christ above 14 years
[1:00:43] ago
[1:00:44] whether in body i cannot tell or whether
[1:00:46] out of body i cannot tell god know it
[1:00:48] such and one caught up in the heaven
[1:00:52] something happened to paul and he is
[1:00:54] sharing it and i knew such a manner
[1:00:56] whether in the body or out of the body i
[1:00:58] cannot tell god know it
[1:00:59] how that he was caught up into paradise
[1:01:01] and heard unspeakable words which it is
[1:01:04] not
[1:01:04] lawful for man to utter of such and one
[1:01:07] will i glorify yet
[1:01:08] of myself i will not glory but in my
[1:01:11] infirmities
[1:01:12] for do i would desire to glory i shall
[1:01:15] not be a fool
[1:01:16] for i will say the truth but now i
[1:01:18] forbid
[1:01:19] lest any man should think of me above
[1:01:21] that which you see at me
[1:01:22] so paul was saying i've been keeping
[1:01:24] this thing to myself because i don't
[1:01:26] want no glory i don't want you to see me
[1:01:28] bigger
[1:01:28] than i am i don't want you to have no no
[1:01:30] fourth understanding of my ministry
[1:01:35] and paul goes on and on in this
[1:01:37] scripture so you read it as your
[1:01:38] homework
[1:01:40] but pauline experienced and it took him
[1:01:42] 14 years
[1:01:43] before he was willing to share it with
[1:01:45] the people that he was ministering to
[1:01:50] and these are the experiences that shape
[1:01:53] us
[1:01:54] these experiences these encounters is
[1:01:56] what makes us
[1:01:57] having a walk with god so different that
[1:02:00] you could weather the storm of time
[1:02:02] because you're not leaning on anybody
[1:02:04] can the church amen
[1:02:11] so can we talk about isaiah a little bit
[1:02:13] this morning
[1:02:16] isaiah the prophet said is one of the
[1:02:19] greatest prophets there is in the bible
[1:02:21] in the message in his presence there are
[1:02:23] 66 books of the bible
[1:02:25] there are 66 chapters in isaiah isaiah
[1:02:28] starts off in genesis the middle of
[1:02:29] isaiah he brings in the new testament
[1:02:32] at the end of isaiah he brings in the
[1:02:34] millennium just exactly genesis the new
[1:02:36] testament and revelation perfect
[1:02:39] isaiah was one of the major prophets
[1:02:42] those are the prophets words and he is
[1:02:46] meditating in the courts
[1:02:47] of the temple in jerusalem trying to
[1:02:50] gain some perspective
[1:02:52] on what had just transpired the recent
[1:02:55] death of king
[1:02:56] uzziah dangers and threats from foreign
[1:03:01] empires
[1:03:02] when all of a sudden he is caught up in
[1:03:04] his own
[1:03:05] experience and the bible says in the
[1:03:08] year that king uzziah died i
[1:03:10] also saw the lord sitting upon a throne
[1:03:13] high
[1:03:13] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:03:15] temple
[1:03:16] what it is to see the lord friends
[1:03:19] that's why we came here this morning not
[1:03:21] to see the preacher or to
[1:03:22] see one another but to see the lord and
[1:03:25] if you ever get an
[1:03:26] encounter to see the lord suddenly your
[1:03:29] world changes it will never be the same
[1:03:31] again
[1:03:33] but to understand the context
[1:03:37] of this buildup the book of second
[1:03:40] chronicle tells us that is
[1:03:42] that uzziah was 16 years old when he
[1:03:44] took the throne
[1:03:46] and he would reign in jerusalem for 52
[1:03:49] years
[1:03:50] under his leadership the nation rose to
[1:03:53] incredible heights of power
[1:03:55] military power financial power and as
[1:03:58] long as uzziah
[1:04:00] saw the lord the kingdom had prospered
[1:04:02] the people had flourished
[1:04:04] the kingdom was strong but king uzziah
[1:04:08] but ibrahim said he went above his
[1:04:09] estate he went above his station and
[1:04:12] and the king did something that the
[1:04:14] priest is supposed to do and he went
[1:04:16] into the temple and
[1:04:17] he offered incense and over 80 priests
[1:04:19] warned him
[1:04:20] king if you do that you'll be violating
[1:04:22] the way we operate
[1:04:25] and i want us to understand our history
[1:04:28] from
[1:04:28] the beginning of time god had ruled
[1:04:32] from the days of moses onwards and and
[1:04:34] drawed by the prophets
[1:04:36] it had never been god's plan to have a
[1:04:38] king over his people
[1:04:40] that was a manly king it was just before
[1:04:44] the dawn of the age of david that the
[1:04:47] children of israel had looked outside of
[1:04:49] themselves as is often the case
[1:04:51] looked at the kingdoms around them and
[1:04:53] said why don't we have a king
[1:04:55] like the philistines do why don't we do
[1:04:57] things the way the world is doing it
[1:04:59] why are we why are we restricting
[1:05:01] ourselves to hearing from the prophets
[1:05:04] and samuel who was the prophet at the
[1:05:06] time felt so
[1:05:08] bad about it god had to come for this
[1:05:11] prophet
[1:05:11] and say samuel they have not rejected
[1:05:13] you they have rejected me
[1:05:18] it had been god's plan to give them a
[1:05:20] king but that king was
[1:05:22] going to be king jesus that had been his
[1:05:25] plan to give them a king and his name is
[1:05:27] going to be jesus
[1:05:31] but the choice of the people they want a
[1:05:33] man they want a man they want a man to
[1:05:35] lead him
[1:05:38] and that's how we end up with king saul
[1:05:40] and then we know all the kings so by the
[1:05:41] time king uzziah is there
[1:05:43] these kings and the prophets supposed to
[1:05:45] be working hand in hand
[1:05:48] for different roles different
[1:05:49] responsibilities what the king is
[1:05:51] supposed to do is not for the priest to
[1:05:53] do what the
[1:05:54] priest and the prophet supposed to do is
[1:05:55] not for the king to do god has an
[1:05:57] order the kingdom has a order but usia
[1:06:00] went outside of the order
[1:06:01] and because he went outside of the order
[1:06:03] the bible said leprous seek him upon him
[1:06:07] brother branham brought out that isaiah
[1:06:10] used to lean on you sire
[1:06:13] rely on uzziah's counsel rely on
[1:06:15] isaiah's advice because
[1:06:17] for the most part he was a great man the
[1:06:19] prophet said he was a great man
[1:06:21] until he got too big for himself and
[1:06:24] once you get too big for yourself god
[1:06:26] has a way of
[1:06:27] stripping you down
[1:06:34] i want you to understand this is isaiah
[1:06:35] the prophet he's a prophet
[1:06:38] but gifts and callings are without
[1:06:40] repentance
[1:06:41] so there's profit as a call is profit as
[1:06:43] a gift
[1:06:45] but the gift and the call comes without
[1:06:47] repentance
[1:06:49] isaiah didn't realize what was happening
[1:06:51] in his life
[1:06:52] as a prophet this is not a church member
[1:06:55] this is not somebody in israel or
[1:06:57] judah or tribe this is a prophet
[1:07:00] a major prophet the prophet would say
[1:07:04] years later he would speak about a
[1:07:06] virgin shall conceive and be a son but
[1:07:09] this is not that time this is in the
[1:07:11] year that king uzziah died isaiah is
[1:07:14] troubled because
[1:07:14] his anchor as it were his support system
[1:07:17] as it were
[1:07:18] where he went for advice as it were
[1:07:20] where when he feeling down you want to
[1:07:22] talk to somebody
[1:07:23] that person who according to history was
[1:07:26] also family to him god had removed
[1:07:30] what he was leaning on god had removed
[1:07:33] that structure to force isaiah to be
[1:07:36] alone
[1:07:38] just like jacob had to be left alone
[1:07:41] just as moses had to be left alone
[1:07:44] just as paul had to be left alone jess
[1:07:47] and
[1:07:47] esther had to be left alone go through
[1:07:50] the bible
[1:07:52] god is a god of the individual he
[1:07:55] doesn't look at the group
[1:07:57] he doesn't even look at your family he's
[1:07:59] a god of the individual
[1:08:01] and wants an individual relationship
[1:08:04] can the church say man is this helping
[1:08:07] anybody this morning
[1:08:11] to show to what extent god is about the
[1:08:13] individual
[1:08:14] in acts 5 with ananias and sapphira
[1:08:18] even though ananias lied and died
[1:08:21] his wife was in judge because of him she
[1:08:25] was given the opportunity as an
[1:08:26] individual
[1:08:28] to represent her position to stand
[1:08:30] before the throne
[1:08:32] that was in peter's heart and she also
[1:08:35] lied
[1:08:35] and god judged her on the merits of her
[1:08:38] actions
[1:08:42] and god had wanted to deal with isaiah
[1:08:44] just as he wants to deal with every one
[1:08:46] of us he has individuals up
[1:08:48] but isaiah had been hiding behind uziah
[1:08:51] he had been leaning
[1:08:52] on uziah he had been depending on usaid
[1:08:54] if you died in core
[1:08:56] i don't know how he felt if he was
[1:08:58] troubled and god stripped it away
[1:09:06] everybody with me sunday school this
[1:09:08] morning
[1:09:10] we're not getting into too much of the
[1:09:11] deep things this morning but we are
[1:09:12] coming to your home
[1:09:14] we're coming to you in your bedroom
[1:09:16] we're coming to you when nobody else is
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:18] to you being alone with god and many
[1:09:21] times
[1:09:22] things block our vision of god
[1:09:25] sometimes we lean on our jobs we lean on
[1:09:28] the comfort of our home we
[1:09:30] we lean on on a leader we lean on
[1:09:33] somebody
[1:09:35] we know god we love god we trust god but
[1:09:37] we are not really depending upon him
[1:09:39] many times god has to remove our props
[1:09:44] allow us to become ill allow us to lose
[1:09:46] a job allow the leader to die
[1:09:48] allow chaos to happen to see how we're
[1:09:51] going to do and
[1:09:52] and isaiah did what was the best thing
[1:09:54] to do he found himself in the temple
[1:09:57] and in the temple something happened he
[1:09:59] said i saw the lord
[1:10:02] can the church say amen and the lord is
[1:10:05] was sitting on the throne
[1:10:07] hallelujah this is not any throne this
[1:10:10] is this room
[1:10:11] this is the throne above every other
[1:10:13] throne this is this
[1:10:14] is not just a throne but god was on the
[1:10:16] throne and once
[1:10:17] he is on the throne he is judged once
[1:10:19] he's on the throne he's the king of
[1:10:21] kings
[1:10:22] he is the presiding judge on the turn
[1:10:24] and isaiah stood there
[1:10:27] everybody with me this morning
[1:10:33] we make decisions and our decisions are
[1:10:36] judgments
[1:10:38] when a judge makes a decision it's
[1:10:41] called a judgment
[1:10:45] your choices your decisions with what
[1:10:48] you do when the day comes and who your
[1:10:49] friends are these are your judgments
[1:10:51] based on the information that's
[1:10:53] presented to you
[1:10:54] you make a decision this is going to be
[1:10:56] my friend and that's a judgment
[1:10:59] but as isaiah stood there in front of
[1:11:02] the lord
[1:11:09] and he saw the lord sitting on the
[1:11:10] throne
[1:11:12] and the throne was not empty god is on
[1:11:16] the throne he's
[1:11:17] in control in the presence
[1:11:21] of the lord isaiah started to feel
[1:11:25] uncomfortable
[1:11:29] isaiah started to feel naked as he
[1:11:32] decided to feel
[1:11:34] what he didn't realize all along
[1:11:38] and he screamed not woe is me
[1:11:42] in other words i'm in trouble before he
[1:11:45] saw the lord he didn't realize that he
[1:11:46] was in trouble
[1:11:50] whoa is me i am undone
[1:11:55] it was only in the presence of the lord
[1:11:57] that he realized
[1:11:58] that he was undone
[1:12:02] many people come to church and they
[1:12:04] don't realize that they are undone
[1:12:08] that word undone means unfinished
[1:12:11] unwound
[1:12:12] incomplete is like your shoelaces untied
[1:12:15] he thought everything was okay
[1:12:19] going through the routine in the absence
[1:12:20] of king uzziah
[1:12:22] but in the presence of the lord and
[1:12:23] there it was the bible said
[1:12:26] he sees the seraphims
[1:12:31] two wings over their faces
[1:12:35] in reverence two wings over their feet
[1:12:38] in humility and two wings they are
[1:12:41] flying they are in action and that's
[1:12:43] attributes of true worship and they're
[1:12:46] saying holy holy holy is the lord holy
[1:12:49] holy holy
[1:12:50] is the lord and the prophet said these
[1:12:52] angels didn't know what sin was
[1:12:55] but yet they covered their faces in
[1:12:57] reverence
[1:13:02] these angels are servants but yet they
[1:13:04] covered their feet
[1:13:05] with wings
[1:13:09] and these angels are in action
[1:13:14] many of us we have action without
[1:13:16] reference
[1:13:18] action without humility we come to
[1:13:21] church how we want to we
[1:13:22] speak to one another how we want to not
[1:13:25] realize that when we come into the house
[1:13:27] of god we are
[1:13:28] coming into the presence of god he was
[1:13:30] in the same temple
[1:13:34] not a different temple it was the same
[1:13:35] temple but then he saw something that he
[1:13:38] hadn't seen before
[1:13:40] may god uncover your eyes this morning
[1:13:42] to see
[1:13:43] what you have not seen before to see god
[1:13:46] upon his throne to
[1:13:48] see what's happening around us to see
[1:13:50] the signs of the time to see
[1:13:52] that no matter what you are going to
[1:13:54] right now
[1:13:55] there's still something that you need to
[1:13:57] do to be complete
[1:14:00] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:03] hallelujah
[1:14:05] isaiah was alone
[1:14:10] above the thrones to the seraphims each
[1:14:13] one had six wings between he covered his
[1:14:15] face
[1:14:16] and between he covered his feet and with
[1:14:18] twain he did fly
[1:14:20] and brother branham said in the message
[1:14:21] but when he got there in the temple that
[1:14:23] day
[1:14:24] and he's seen those cherubims waving
[1:14:26] these wings back and forth
[1:14:28] and realized that these angels
[1:14:30] ministered in the face of god
[1:14:32] and them angels didn't even know what
[1:14:34] sin was
[1:14:35] and to stand in the presence of god they
[1:14:37] had to cover
[1:14:38] their holy faces
[1:14:43] hallelujah to stand in the presence of
[1:14:45] god
[1:14:46] hallelujah how did you come to the house
[1:14:48] of god this morning
[1:14:49] are your faces covered in the presence
[1:14:51] of god this morning
[1:14:53] did you come with reverence in the house
[1:14:55] of god this morning
[1:14:56] did you come knowing that he is here
[1:14:59] this morning to heal
[1:15:00] to deliver to break the chains to break
[1:15:03] the curse of sin
[1:15:04] did you come covered did you come this
[1:15:07] morning in total reverence
[1:15:09] because you realize that he is god and
[1:15:12] this is not just a church
[1:15:13] service but there is an approach to god
[1:15:16] and he is sitting on his throne this
[1:15:18] morning his throne is above the prime
[1:15:21] minister
[1:15:21] his troll is above the precedent his
[1:15:24] throne is above your doctor
[1:15:25] his truth is above your natural father
[1:15:28] his throne is above the pastor
[1:15:30] his children is above the country
[1:15:33] he is the king of kings he is the lord
[1:15:35] of lords
[1:15:36] he got all by himself and he is still
[1:15:39] sitting on the trauma
[1:15:40] he is moving things around this morning
[1:15:43] to bring deliverance
[1:15:45] to set the captives free this morning
[1:15:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:55] and one cried unto another verse three
[1:15:58] and said holy holy holy is the lord of

[1:16:17] in psalms 99 the lord reign it up let
[1:16:20] the people tremble
[1:16:21] he sitted between the cherubims let the
[1:16:24] earth be moved up

[1:16:28] above all the people

[1:16:58] without a revelation that he is holy
[1:17:02] hallelujah and in his holiness it makes
[1:17:06] us weak in his holiness it shows who we
[1:17:09] really are

[1:17:37] holy is the lord of hosts
[1:17:39] and the whole earth is full of his glory
[1:17:42] church
[1:17:42] if the angels who don't know what sin is

[1:17:48] holy holy holy
[1:17:50] holy is the lord holy holy holy holy is
[1:17:53] the lord and they don't know what
[1:17:54] sinners they didn't make a mistake

[1:18:21] lord god almighty

[1:19:05] make mistakes of
[1:19:07] sing praises unto him what about us who
[1:19:10] were created the worship
[1:19:12] and with a different gratefulness of we
[1:19:14] could say worship that the angels cannot
[1:19:16] even sing
[1:19:25] hallelujah
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] he is holy
[1:19:39] he is holy he is holy
[1:19:44] he is holy because he is holy that's why
[1:19:48] you dress reverently to come into the
[1:19:49] house of god
[1:19:51] because he is holy it's why you speak a
[1:19:54] certain way when you come around the
[1:19:55] tabernacle
[1:19:56] because he is holy and you realize that
[1:19:58] he sits on his throne
[1:20:00] it's why you even in your house you
[1:20:02] operate a certain way
[1:20:03] it's because he is holy because he is
[1:20:06] holy
[1:20:06] is why the prophet would say there's
[1:20:08] clothes you're not supposed to even wear
[1:20:09] in your house
[1:20:10] you figure that out but he was speaking
[1:20:12] about the consciousness
[1:20:14] of the holiness of god the consciousness
[1:20:17] about the throne of god the holiness of
[1:20:20] god
[1:20:28] his holiness has nothing to do with your
[1:20:31] condition
[1:20:33] his holiness has nothing to do with your
[1:20:35] mistakes his holiness has nothing to do
[1:20:37] with how long you're in the message or
[1:20:38] how long you're in church
[1:20:39] he is just holy he is just holy
[1:20:43] so you have no excuse this morning to
[1:20:45] not worship
[1:20:46] what is your excuse to not worship this
[1:20:49] morning
[1:20:50] what is your excuse
[1:20:53] what stress you have that you cannot say
[1:20:55] holy is the lord
[1:20:56] what problem you have that you cannot
[1:20:58] worship and give god praise this morning
[1:21:01] you have no excuse this morning you have
[1:21:04] no excuse
[1:21:05] i'm not talking about you this morning
[1:21:07] i'm talking about him
[1:21:09] because that's what isaiah saw when he's
[1:21:13] when he saw the lord and he saw the
[1:21:15] angels
[1:21:16] and he saw the seraphims he was so moved
[1:21:20] when he saw the building begin to shake
[1:21:22] the bible said the pause of the door
[1:21:24] moved
[1:21:25] at the voice of him that cried and the
[1:21:27] house was filled with smoke
[1:21:29] the incense of worship the house was
[1:21:32] filled
[1:21:33] it was milky white because praise was in
[1:21:36] the tabernacle
[1:21:37] it was milky white
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:41] it may be seated it's a sunday school
[1:21:44] message
[1:21:49] the smoke and the worship and the praise
[1:21:52] didn't mean that sin was not there
[1:21:54] because the smoke and the worship and
[1:21:56] the praise uncovered
[1:21:59] uncovered the sin that was there because
[1:22:02] it was the smoke and the moving of the
[1:22:04] posts and the angels that were
[1:22:07] were flying around and the lord being
[1:22:09] present that that forced isaiah
[1:22:12] to stop looking around him
[1:22:17] the atmosphere had changed so much that
[1:22:19] isaiah
[1:22:20] stopped looking at the throne he stopped
[1:22:23] looking at the angels
[1:22:25] he had forgotten about king uzziah and
[1:22:27] all of a sudden he started to look at
[1:22:29] himself
[1:22:31] he was so overwhelmed with what he felt
[1:22:34] he was so overwhelmed with what he saw
[1:22:36] he was so overwhelmed
[1:22:38] with what he heard he was so overwhelmed
[1:22:41] that what was happening around him that
[1:22:44] he stopped looking around him
[1:22:45] and he looked at himself
[1:22:49] and when he looked at himself in that
[1:22:51] presence when he looked at himself in
[1:22:54] that anointing
[1:22:55] when he looked at himself in the
[1:22:56] presence of the king on the throne
[1:22:59] in the throne room and the seraphims and
[1:23:01] the angels around
[1:23:02] that he said war is me i didn't realize
[1:23:05] i was in trouble
[1:23:07] i thought i was okay i thought i'm in
[1:23:09] the message
[1:23:10] i thought i'm a worshiper i thought i'm
[1:23:13] a believer
[1:23:14] war is me i'm in trouble i didn't
[1:23:16] realize
[1:23:17] that i'm here in the temple he wasn't in
[1:23:20] a bar
[1:23:21] he wasn't on the street he wasn't with a
[1:23:23] prostitute
[1:23:24] he was in the temple and the temple
[1:23:26] uncovered
[1:23:27] the sin and the shame the temple
[1:23:30] uncovered the filth that was in his
[1:23:32] mouth the temple
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:41] but random said one day we have a church
[1:23:44] where sin cannot stay in the church
[1:23:47] because the king on this throne will
[1:23:50] uncover
[1:23:51] will expose will lift up what's going on
[1:23:55] in your life
[1:23:56] lift up your situation you see in that
[1:23:58] presence
[1:23:59] isaiah couldn't blame anybody people
[1:24:02] still talk about well
[1:24:03] it have hypocrites and this won't do
[1:24:05] this and this one do that
[1:24:07] and i don't know how he living and he
[1:24:09] deacon did this and the elder did that
[1:24:11] and the minister did this and this
[1:24:12] person say this
[1:24:16] but in the presence of god it was not
[1:24:18] about anybody else
[1:24:21] isaiah looked at jess himself
[1:24:25] not his child his wife his cousin his
[1:24:27] brother his neighbor nothing he said
[1:24:29] lord
[1:24:29] was me i didn't realize it
[1:24:34] i didn't think i was in this much
[1:24:35] trouble i thought i was all right
[1:24:38] i'm a spiritual man this is a prophet
[1:24:42] a major prophet who found that there was
[1:24:45] sin in his members
[1:24:47] a prophet who found it
[1:24:51] that he was in trouble and didn't
[1:24:53] realize it
[1:24:54] it was not that he didn't know the word
[1:24:56] or didn't know the law didn't know the
[1:24:58] scriptures
[1:24:59] yes was called for this purpose he was
[1:25:02] born for his purpose
[1:25:04] can the church say amen
[1:25:11] then said i worries me
[1:25:16] for i am undone he
[1:25:19] came to acknowledge his problem
[1:25:25] god didn't say this is your problem it
[1:25:27] wasn't the pastor saying this
[1:25:28] you know what your problem is here this
[1:25:30] morning
[1:25:34] you don't need a pastor to tell you what
[1:25:35] your problem is the word
[1:25:37] opens up what your problem is
[1:25:41] he said i am undone
[1:25:44] and he came to his problem
[1:25:47] he said because i am a man of unclean
[1:25:52] lips
[1:25:56] he identified what was his problem can
[1:25:59] you identify your problem in the
[1:26:01] presence of god
[1:26:02] what you need help with what you want
[1:26:06] change in your life can you identify
[1:26:09] your struggle that
[1:26:10] you know has been there but this morning
[1:26:13] the presence of god is lifting
[1:26:14] off the covers to bring you directly to
[1:26:17] confront who you are
[1:26:19] when everybody else because nobody had a
[1:26:21] reason to point at isaiah
[1:26:23] to question his life his integrity this
[1:26:25] was usaid's prophet
[1:26:29] this was an anointed man of god but in
[1:26:31] the presence of god
[1:26:32] there's a conversation taking place
[1:26:35] that nobody else is around for and my
[1:26:38] desire this morning for me as an
[1:26:39] individual
[1:26:40] is lord show me show me where i am
[1:26:42] undone this morning
[1:26:45] show me what i like this morning show me
[1:26:48] what i need this morning
[1:26:50] i didn't realize that i was just empty i
[1:26:52] didn't realize that i was this
[1:26:54] needy i didn't even know what i need but
[1:26:56] in your presence
[1:26:58] i'm a man of unclean lips i'm i'm a man
[1:27:00] struggling with
[1:27:01] whatever it is this morning oh god
[1:27:06] oh god oh god
[1:27:10] and isaiah the prophet said the prophet
[1:27:13] said
[1:27:13] he started to confess
[1:27:17] what was his problem he started to
[1:27:20] confess
[1:27:21] what was his need he started to admit
[1:27:25] what he was doing he started to confess
[1:27:29] where he had gone wrong he said i am
[1:27:31] undone because
[1:27:33] i am a man of unclean lips so he was not
[1:27:36] just saying well pray for me
[1:27:43] he was never seen remember me in prayer
[1:27:45] this was this was not that
[1:27:47] he had come to confront the reality say
[1:27:50] i am a man of on clean lips
[1:27:51] i'm not afraid to admit it i'm not
[1:27:53] afraid to confess it
[1:27:54] because i can't get help if i keep it
[1:27:56] hidden any longer but abraham spent a
[1:27:58] lot of time preaching about
[1:28:00] unconfessed sin but when you confess the
[1:28:02] devil cannot hold it
[1:28:03] on you anymore
[1:28:17] for i am undone because i'm a man of
[1:28:22] unclean lips and i dwell
[1:28:25] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[1:28:31] and then he places it into context from
[1:28:32] mine eyes have seen the king the lord of
[1:28:35] hosts
[1:28:37] so when people are hiding what's going
[1:28:40] on in their lives it's because they
[1:28:42] have yet to see the king
[1:28:45] the lord of hosts because once you see
[1:28:48] the king the lord of hosts it means you
[1:28:50] have stopped looking at man
[1:28:52] there are no more desires in your life
[1:28:55] and all
[1:28:56] that left to see that could help you
[1:28:57] along your journey to the rapture
[1:28:59] is to see the king because only in the
[1:29:02] presence of the king
[1:29:03] can you get the help that you need so my
[1:29:06] simple objective this morning is to
[1:29:09] point you to the king
[1:29:11] and to remind you that he is here and to
[1:29:14] remind you that he's on his throne
[1:29:16] and to remind you to check yourself
[1:29:19] because i'm trying to check myself this
[1:29:22] morning
[1:29:22] i can check you too
[1:29:27] oh let me say that one more time i'm not
[1:29:30] here this morning to tell you what
[1:29:31] you're doing wrong
[1:29:33] i'm trying to solve my problem this
[1:29:35] morning just like
[1:29:36] isaiah i'm trying to come to terms in
[1:29:39] the presence of god with what i
[1:29:41] need to do
[1:29:50] hallelujah
[1:29:55] i'm losing my i'm losing my voice a
[1:29:57] little bit
[1:30:01] because the devil doesn't like to get
[1:30:04] exposed
[1:30:08] switch on the light and all the insects
[1:30:10] and stuff go scampering
[1:30:13] we are here this morning switch on the
[1:30:14] light in your life
[1:30:17] because he is the light in the true
[1:30:20] room it's light there's smoke there's
[1:30:23] incense there's
[1:30:24] worship there's praises
[1:30:27] and friends don't be afraid of it
[1:30:31] don't be afraid of it it's like telling
[1:30:34] a child take the bitter medicine
[1:30:38] it might burn now but you're gonna get
[1:30:39] better
[1:30:41] if you don't take it you're gonna stay
[1:30:42] in trouble
[1:30:44] if you don't take it you're gonna stay
[1:30:46] in pain but if you take the treatment
[1:30:48] this morning from the master surgeon
[1:30:50] who's on the throne
[1:30:52] from the doctor on the throne this
[1:30:54] morning you'll be all right
[1:31:00] can we take a little more war
[1:31:03] is me i'm in trouble
[1:31:10] if a prophet could be in trouble
[1:31:14] don't you think preachers could get in
[1:31:15] trouble
[1:31:18] if a prophet could get in trouble don't
[1:31:20] you think ministers could get in trouble
[1:31:23] if a prophet could get in trouble don't
[1:31:25] you think elders would get in trouble
[1:31:28] if a prophet might get in trouble don't
[1:31:29] you think deacons are getting in trouble
[1:31:32] if you think a prophet could get in
[1:31:33] trouble do you think usher gets in
[1:31:35] trouble
[1:31:39] there are young people who look at their
[1:31:41] parents and they know that something is
[1:31:43] not right
[1:31:45] and instead of praying that god help
[1:31:47] them they disrespect them
[1:31:50] not knowing that their parent needs an
[1:31:52] experience just as the young person
[1:31:54] needs an experience with god
[1:32:02] the attitude changes when you get the
[1:32:06] picture
[1:32:07] that every single person in this room is
[1:32:09] not here
[1:32:10] to show but here to get an encounter
[1:32:13] with god
[1:32:18] i'm the first to say i'm undone can you
[1:32:21] admit it
[1:32:25] when the prophet spoke about they say
[1:32:26] i'm undone
[1:32:28] woe is me
[1:32:31] they stripped the self-righteous
[1:32:35] skirt to the floor feeling like nobody
[1:32:37] knows the trouble you're seeing and deep
[1:32:40] down inside you're
[1:32:41] being eaten up because you have been
[1:32:44] leaning
[1:32:46] on other stuff
[1:32:50] and god is systematically breaking all
[1:32:53] the stuff around you
[1:32:55] until you have nothing to lean on until
[1:32:58] nobody else when you look around you
[1:32:59] there's nobody there
[1:33:05] left alone
[1:33:10] i'm undone i am unfinished
[1:33:14] i am incomplete i am
[1:33:18] not okay
[1:33:25] all scriptures have to be taken in its
[1:33:28] correct context
[1:33:32] when moses was about to open up the red
[1:33:34] sea stand still and see the salvation of
[1:33:36] the lord
[1:33:37] that was appropriate then
[1:33:41] when potiphar's wife was coming to
[1:33:42] joseph
[1:33:45] you say stand still and see the
[1:33:47] salvation of the lord
[1:33:53] but did you say why quote in scripture
[1:33:54] isn't that what moses
[1:33:59] wrong scripture there's a time to say
[1:34:02] let the weak say i'm strong
[1:34:04] that has its context
[1:34:08] but it's a time to say lord who is me
[1:34:10] i'm undone
[1:34:12] i need help i'm not okay i'm here this
[1:34:14] morning
[1:34:15] because i need deliverance
[1:34:22] i'm not trying to impress anybody i'm
[1:34:25] not trying to people to think i'm i'm
[1:34:27] because i'm shouting i'm shouting
[1:34:29] that everything is all right lord who is
[1:34:31] me because i'm in your presence this
[1:34:33] morning
[1:34:34] and i cannot afford to go home the same
[1:34:37] way
[1:34:37] that i came
[1:34:52] i said it's a sunday school class this
[1:34:54] morning
[1:34:55] very simple i want to make sure i just
[1:34:56] nailed this down so you
[1:34:59] get a picture of that scenario that
[1:35:01] scene a vision of what took place
[1:35:04] not just to see it externally but to put
[1:35:06] yourself in that same place
[1:35:15] isaiah was a religious man spiritual man
[1:35:18] living in a religious nation a spiritual
[1:35:21] nation
[1:35:22] god's nation god's people there had been
[1:35:25] no switch from the
[1:35:27] jewish dispensation to the gentile
[1:35:29] dispensation to that time
[1:35:30] they were still god's people he had
[1:35:33] responsibility
[1:35:34] with the holy things of god yet until
[1:35:37] that moment he had
[1:35:38] never fully seen the holiness of god
[1:35:42] he had been operating in his ministry
[1:35:45] and had
[1:35:45] never seen the lord
[1:35:53] let me say that one more time isaiah had
[1:35:56] been operating in his ministry
[1:35:58] and had never seen the lord
[1:36:01] have you seen the lord have you had that
[1:36:03] experience with god that
[1:36:05] growls you and becomes your anchor that
[1:36:08] you could say
[1:36:09] like the old ones do but my anchor holds
[1:36:12] despite the storm because the storms
[1:36:14] will come
[1:36:19] suddenly in the presence of the lord he
[1:36:22] understood
[1:36:23] that all of our human righteousness is
[1:36:25] as filthy rags
[1:36:30] he understood that there's nothing that
[1:36:31] we can do of our own accord there's no
[1:36:34] sacrifice that we could make
[1:36:35] no good thing we could produce nothing
[1:36:38] that will ever give us the right
[1:36:39] to even stand in the presence of god he
[1:36:43] didn't even activate the presence of god
[1:36:46] god
[1:36:46] chose to show himself to isaiah
[1:36:49] like he has come to show himself to you
[1:36:52] this morning
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:37:00] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:37:05] may this still your heart this morning
[1:37:09] and for those who really catch it they
[1:37:10] will hold on to the horns of the altar
[1:37:13] and say lord who is me i'm undead
[1:37:20] the prophet and the messenger anointed
[1:37:21] once at the end time
[1:37:24] he is praying cleanse our heart lord
[1:37:28] is this your prayer cleanse our heart
[1:37:30] lord from
[1:37:31] all filth of the world lord i stand

[1:38:23] the earth
[1:38:24] it saint claims our heart lord from all
[1:38:26] filth of this world
[1:38:30] i want you to listen to the prayer
[1:38:33] because
[1:38:35] similar yes and i said what took place
[1:38:37] with isaiah
[1:38:38] it takes god to do the cleansing
[1:38:42] you cannot cleanse yourself that's your
[1:38:45] mistake you kind of cleanse yourself
[1:38:46] you need to come and lay at your altar
[1:38:49] for god to perform the surgery
[1:38:50] and you have to surrender all the
[1:38:53] problems we come and we put things at
[1:38:55] the altar
[1:38:56] and then we pick it back up and go back
[1:38:57] home with it
[1:39:04] take the calls cleanse my lips
[1:39:08] here i am that's why i asked but
[1:39:10] actually just sing that song because
[1:39:12] this is where this song comes from

[1:39:18] me past the outer court
[1:39:20] through the holy place into the holy of
[1:39:23] holies

[1:39:31] that place i realize that i'm empty i'm
[1:39:33] wanting i'm nothing
[1:39:35] and i pray that the angel will take the
[1:39:37] calls
[1:39:38] with the
[1:39:51] i stand lord i'm still reading a prayer
[1:39:53] from the prophet
[1:39:54] and asked for cleansing lord take me to
[1:39:58] the potter's house
[1:39:59] and break me up mold me a servant that
[1:40:02] you would want
[1:40:03] for lord jesus i'm a man of unclean lips
[1:40:06] as isaiah cried dwelling with people of
[1:40:09] unclean lips and war is me for i
[1:40:12] see the revelation now he's placing it
[1:40:14] in context for us in the message
[1:40:16] for i see the revelation of god being
[1:40:19] made manifest
[1:40:21] as isaiah saw the angels in the temple i
[1:40:24] see the
[1:40:25] end time lord and war is me and my
[1:40:27] family
[1:40:28] war is me and my people o eternal god
[1:40:31] have mercy upon us
[1:40:33] i plead for myself and the people let us
[1:40:37] not
[1:40:37] perish with those who believe not but
[1:40:40] may we live with the believers
[1:40:46] hallelujah is this your prayer this
[1:40:48] morning
[1:40:50] hallelujah hallelujah the musician get
[1:40:53] her get ready i'm not going to meet too
[1:40:54] much longer
[1:40:56] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[1:40:59] having a live coal in his hand which he
[1:41:02] had taken from the tongues
[1:41:04] with the tungsten of the altar and he
[1:41:06] laid it upon my mouth
[1:41:08] and said lo this has touched my lips and
[1:41:10] then iniquity
[1:41:12] is taken away and i sin perched
[1:41:16] in other words beyond isaiah recognizing
[1:41:19] his own
[1:41:20] uncleanness and that of the people
[1:41:22] isaiah actually saw the willingness of
[1:41:25] god
[1:41:26] to forgive anyone who would turn back to
[1:41:28] him
[1:41:29] anyone who would confess to him all god
[1:41:32] was looking for from isaiah was a
[1:41:34] confession
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:38] a confession of the desire to be changed
[1:41:40] a confession of what you know to be
[1:41:42] wrong
[1:41:42] a confession of your need isaiah didn't
[1:41:46] have to plead for it he didn't have to
[1:41:47] beg for it
[1:41:48] mercy came and touched him and he
[1:41:51] became aware that it was the delight of
[1:41:54] god
[1:41:54] to forgive and to cleanse in a message
[1:41:58] god's power to transform but iran said
[1:42:00] isaiah's lips he was just
[1:42:02] an ordinary man of unclean lips he said
[1:42:05] lord i'm among unclean people and i got
[1:42:07] unclean lips woe is me
[1:42:09] because i've seen the lord and an angel
[1:42:12] came down
[1:42:12] got the fire holy fire off of god's
[1:42:16] altar
[1:42:18] and transformed his lips from the lips
[1:42:20] of a wandering man
[1:42:22] to the lips of a prophet with thus saith
[1:42:25] the lord god's
[1:42:27] power hallelujah
[1:42:31] thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:42:34] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:42:38] lord
[1:42:39] in the message influence pretty much
[1:42:43] said then what you can begin to play
[1:42:44] something softly
[1:42:45] when he confess his sins then come the
[1:42:48] cleansing
[1:42:50] oh you cannot be con you cannot be clean
[1:42:52] from your sin until you confess it sin
[1:42:55] till you recognize it sin then come the
[1:42:57] cleansing as soon as he said woe is me
[1:43:00] for my eyes i've seen the vindication of
[1:43:03] a great god
[1:43:04] the angels the burners the sacrifices
[1:43:08] are here
[1:43:09] and the post is moving at their voice
[1:43:12] and
[1:43:12] here they are in this vision flying back
[1:43:15] and forth
[1:43:16] he had saw something real a vision had
[1:43:18] come down he said i'm a man of unclean
[1:43:20] lips
[1:43:21] and i dwell among unclean people said he
[1:43:23] cried out for mercy
[1:43:24] and called himself a sinner then what
[1:43:26] happened one of the cherubims
[1:43:28] went over to the altar and took the
[1:43:31] tongues you could be in a play take me
[1:43:32] into the holy of holies one more time
[1:43:34] and took the toms and pick up a live
[1:43:36] coal
[1:43:37] and picked it on his hand not carried in
[1:43:40] a tongue now picked up the call put it
[1:43:41] in his hand
[1:43:42] and come and laid it upon the prophet's
[1:43:45] lips
[1:43:46] and said that iniquity what is iniquity
[1:43:50] brother branham said iniquity is
[1:43:52] something that you know it's wrong
[1:43:54] and still holding on to it we know your
[1:43:57] creed's around or your behavior is wrong
[1:43:59] and still hold on to it
[1:44:01] he said that's iniquity but when he
[1:44:03] confessed that he was wrong there was a
[1:44:05] cleansing power
[1:44:06] he took a coal of fire we see how god
[1:44:11] sets his servants in order and what he
[1:44:13] fixed him with
[1:44:14] how he kept being humble reverent and
[1:44:17] put
[1:44:18] himself in action watch when he cleans a
[1:44:21] silver he never done it by a seminary
[1:44:24] he never done it by a bunch of books we
[1:44:26] find here that god cleans his servants
[1:44:28] by fire
[1:44:30] a call of fire touched a prophet cleanse
[1:44:32] his lips
[1:44:33] god cleans his servants by holy fire
[1:44:36] not by books not by education technology
