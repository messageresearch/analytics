[0:00] Amen. We happy to have you here with us

[12:36] you for your grace. We thank you for
[12:38] this opportunity that you could gather
[12:39] us together in this virtual room that we
[12:42] could talk to you and hear from you.
[12:45] Father God, I pray for Bill and Shirley
[12:47] Ferguson that you would visit them with
[12:49] your power and with your presence and
[12:51] touch them and deliver them from this
[12:53] cancer condition. Father, and may they
[12:55] come to the saving knowledge of Jesus
[12:57] Christ. May they get to know you by
[12:59] experience, by revelation. Father, speak
[13:01] to them, Father. Any person that is sick
[13:03] in this room here Lord, any family
[13:05] member and they have a need here, may
[13:08] you minister to their need, bless your
[13:09] word that we here tonight, bless it and
[13:12] inspire our hearts as we wait upon you
[13:15] and we look out to you in Jesus name I
[13:16] ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and
[13:20] welcome tonight to this time of prayer
[13:24] after this day of prayer and fasting.
[13:27] And I have a title that I like to share
[13:30] with you a few words. Present your
[13:33] bodies a living sacrifice. And I want to
[13:37] uh start with Exodus chapter 19. We want
[13:41] to read from verse 3-6. Exodus chapter
[13:44] 19 verse 3-6. You know, the Old
[13:47] Testament gives
[13:49] you a clearer picture of God in terms of
[13:55] how he thinks, how he see, what he sees,
[13:59] how he operates. And you could reflect
[14:01] it back in the New Testament. But let us
[14:03] see what is said here in Exodus chapter
[14:05] 19. And Moses went up unto God, and
[14:09] said, The Lord, and the Lord called unto
[14:13] him out of the mountain, saying, "Thus
[14:16] shall thou say to the house of Jacob,
[14:20] and tell the children of Israel, Ye have
[14:23] seen what I did unto the Egyptians." So,
[14:26] this is God telling Moses what to tell
[14:29] the people. You have seen what I did
[14:32] unto the Egyptians, and how I bear you
[14:36] on eagle's wings, and brought you unto
[14:40] myself. Watch those words. Brought you
[14:43] unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will
[14:48] obey my voice indeed, and keep my
[14:51] covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar
[14:55] treasure unto me above all people, for
[15:00] all the earth is
[15:01] mine, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[15:06] of priests and an holy nation. These are
[15:10] the words which thou shalt speak unto
[15:15] the children of Israel. Now I know
[15:17] brother Isaac have been some time in
[15:20] past spoke about the kingdom of priests
[15:22] and the kingdom of kings but I want to
[15:26] look at that preite tonight in a bit.
[15:28] God has
[15:31] many wonderful blessings and privilege
[15:33] and inheritance for us but his primary
[15:37] purpose is to bring us to
[15:41] himself. In other words, the outer
[15:44] court, the inner court, then the most
[15:48] holy place. So God wants us to journey
[15:53] to get to that place.
[15:55] God is interested in a personal
[15:58] connection with his people. Some stop
[16:01] short at religion, confined to a belief,
[16:05] and they're satisfied with that, what
[16:07] they believe. Some stop short at what
[16:10] they do. But God wants an inner veil
[16:15] relationship with you and I. And this
[16:19] relationship in a veil
[16:22] relationship
[16:24] this most holy priest relationship this
[16:27] will fulfill the second fold of the
[16:30] three-fold mystery of God that is to
[16:34] have the preeminence which is abiding in
[16:39] the vine that you can be fruit bearing.
[16:42] But Anthony wonderfully expressed that
[16:45] on Wednesday night about abiding, about
[16:48] fruit bearing and God interested in us
[16:51] bringing forth fruit. Not just a tree,
[16:54] not just to say that we exist, but we
[16:57] are our purpose is to bring forth that
[17:00] fruit and that our fruit
[17:02] remains. Where did Aaron's rod blossom b
[17:05] and brought forth fruit? It was in the
[17:09] presence of the shikana glory. So verse
[17:12] 5 again now therefore if he shall obey
[17:17] my voice indeed. So there is something
[17:20] about recognizing God's voice and
[17:24] dropping into obedience to that voice.
[17:26] There's two things you have here. You
[17:28] will obey my voice and keep my covenant.
[17:31] Then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[17:34] unto me above all people. for all the
[17:37] earth is mine.
[17:41] Now, excuse me. It's in John
[17:43] 10:26:27, Jesus speaks, but he believe
[17:47] not because you are not of my
[17:49] sheep. As I said unto you, my sheep hear
[17:54] my voice and I know them and they follow
[17:58] me. Let's go through that slowly. My
[18:01] sheep. Who is the my sheep? They are
[18:05] those who hear his voice and follow him.
[18:09] Not I'm in the message. Not I believe I
[18:12] believe the message. Not that my sheep
[18:16] want hear his voice and follow him.
[18:21] Follow Jesus for all the earth is mine.
[18:23] It shall be to me a you shall be a
[18:25] kingdom of priests, a holy nation. So
[18:28] God of all of this this vision that God
[18:33] seen for the for the nation as the
[18:35] kingdom of priests was in the Old
[18:37] Testament. It was the vision of God for
[18:41] his people to become a kingdom of
[18:45] priests. We'll see where we're going
[18:47] tonight. Now 1 Peter 2
[18:51] 9-11 Peter speaks but ye are a chosen
[18:56] generation a royal
[18:58] priesthood a holy nation. So Peter is
[19:02] going from Exodus drawing from what was
[19:05] in the Old Testament and bringing us
[19:08] bringing it into the New Testament for
[19:10] us. Ye are a chosen generation, a royal
[19:14] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[19:17] people, that he should show forth the
[19:19] praises of him who had called you out of
[19:22] darkness into his marvelous light, which
[19:24] in time past were not a people that are
[19:26] now the people of God which had not
[19:29] obtained mercy, but now have obtained
[19:32] mercy. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[19:34] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[19:38] fleshly lust which war against the soul.
[19:42] So Peter is quoting from Exodus 19. He's
[19:45] applying it to the New Testament
[19:46] believers and you are chosen generation,
[19:48] royal priesthood, holy nation where
[19:50] Moses said a kingdom of priests. Peter
[19:53] said a royal priesthood and royal is
[19:57] kingly. So we talk about royal king
[19:59] kingship.
[20:01] Revelation 5
[20:03] and6. Revelation 5 and 6. And from Jesus
[20:07] Christ, who is the faithful witness, the
[20:11] first begotten of the dead, and the
[20:14] prince of the kings of the earth, unto
[20:17] him that loved us, and washed us from
[20:20] our sins in his own blood, and has made
[20:24] us kings and
[20:27] priests unto God and his father. To him
[20:31] be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[20:34] Amen. So here it is. What was spoken by
[20:38] Moses, reaffirmed by Peter, confirmed by
[20:42] John in the book of Revelation that we
[20:43] are to be kings and
[20:46] priests. Romans 5:17.
[20:50] For if by one's man
[20:52] offense debt reigned by one, much more
[20:56] they which receive abundance of grace
[21:00] and of the gift of righteousness shall
[21:02] reign in life by one Jesus Christ. This
[21:07] verse in the amplified says, "For if
[21:09] because of one's man trans trespass,
[21:13] lapse, offense, debt reign through that
[21:16] one, much more surely will those who
[21:20] receive God's overflowing grace,
[21:23] unmmerited favor, and the free gift of
[21:25] righteousness, putting them into right
[21:27] standing with themselves, reign as kings
[21:30] in life through the one
[21:33] man, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the
[21:36] anointed
[21:36] So we see here that Jesus came to bring
[21:41] abundance of grace, overflowing of
[21:44] grace, unmmerited favor that we could
[21:47] get the free gift of righteousness. Not
[21:49] all righteousness is a gift of
[21:51] righteousness putting us into right
[21:53] standing with God. 2 Corinthians 5:21.
[21:57] For he had made him to be sin for us,
[22:01] who knew no sin, that we might be made
[22:05] the righteousness of God in him. So
[22:08] God's purpose is to place upon us by his
[22:13] grace, by gift, by unmmerited favor, his
[22:18] own righteousness that would make us
[22:20] righteous. is not our own righteousness
[22:23] but the righteousness of God which is by
[22:24] faith. Jesus was made sin with our
[22:28] sinfulness and in return we might be
[22:30] made righteous with his righteousness
[22:32] and it's a gift when we receive this
[22:34] overflowing grace and gift of
[22:36] righteousness. We are ready to be reign
[22:39] as kings in this time. Not only are we
[22:43] to be kings, we are to be a kingdom of
[22:46] priests. And the thing that identifies
[22:49] with this priestly ministry, what is it?
[22:53] It is
[22:54] sacrifice. The only people entitled in
[22:58] the Bible to offer sacrifice to God are
[23:01] priests. This is what this ministry,
[23:05] this priesthood ministry is about. We
[23:07] have to learn to offer sacrifice. We
[23:10] have to have this sacrificial ministry.
[23:13] 1 Peter
[23:15] 2:5, "Ye also as lively stones are built
[23:20] up a spiritual house and holy priesthood
[23:24] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[23:28] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
[23:31] Peter clearly identified as spiritual
[23:34] sacrifices. Why? Because in the Old
[23:36] Testament they offer physical sacrifices
[23:39] of goats and bulocks and different kinds
[23:42] of things like that. Physical
[23:43] sacrifices. So Peter was specifying that
[23:46] this priesthood is different. This
[23:48] priesthood is to offer up spiritual
[23:51] sacrifices that is acceptable to God.
[23:54] Hebrews 5:1 says, "For every high priest
[23:59] taken from among men is ordained for men
[24:03] in things pertaining to God that he may
[24:06] offer gifts and sacrifices for sin." So
[24:11] this is the objective offering gifts and
[24:14] sacrificing for sin. Now when they apply
[24:17] they said Jesus Hebrews 5 6 and 7 says
[24:22] he said another place thou art a priest
[24:24] forever after the order of MelzDC who
[24:27] speaking about Christ in the days of his
[24:29] flesh when he had offered up prayers
[24:33] here we go and
[24:35] supplications with strong crying and
[24:39] tears unto him that was able to save him
[24:42] of death. Let's go back again hear what
[24:45] this priest after the order of
[24:48] MelchzDC here what Jesus offered up who
[24:53] in the days of his flesh when he had
[24:56] offered up prayers and
[25:00] supplication with strong crying and
[25:04] tears unto him that was able to save him
[25:08] from death and was heard in that he
[25:10] feared though he be a
[25:12] You had learn who learn you learn your
[25:15] obedience by the things that he
[25:17] suffered. So this is
[25:20] incredible. He Jesus offered up
[25:24] prayers and
[25:26] supplications with strong crying and
[25:30] tears. So
[25:32] Jesus sacrificial ministry while on
[25:36] earth was to offer the sacrifices of
[25:39] prayer.
[25:41] Then came the time when he offered
[25:44] himself. So first he offered prayer,
[25:49] intercession with strong crying and
[25:52] tears and then he offered up himself.
[25:56] We're almost done. And this is where we
[25:58] get to Hebrews 7 verse 26 and 27. says
[26:03] this, "For such a high priest became us,
[26:07] who is holy, harmless,
[26:11] undefiled, separate from sinners, and
[26:14] made higher than the heavens." Here we
[26:17] go. Who needeth not daily as those high
[26:20] priests to offer up
[26:21] sacrifice first for his own sins, then
[26:25] for the people, for this he did once
[26:29] when he offered up himself. So in terms
[26:32] of the priesthood, he didn't only offer
[26:35] prayers. He didn't only offered up uh
[26:38] intercession, but Jesus offered up
[26:42] himself. Hebrews
[26:45] 9 13 and 14. For if the blood of bulls
[26:48] and goats and the ashes of Hepher
[26:51] sprinkling the unclean sanctifying the
[26:55] to the purifying of the flesh, how much
[26:57] more shall the blood of Christ who
[27:01] through the eternal spirit offered
[27:04] himself without spot to God purge your
[27:09] conscience from dead works to serve the
[27:12] living God. And Hebrews 13 almost
[27:15] finished 15-16. For by him therefore let
[27:20] us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[27:22] continually, not partially, not when
[27:24] you're feeling good, not when you get a
[27:26] raise of pay or you get a new car, new
[27:27] house or whatever. Let us offer the
[27:31] sacrifice of praise of God continually.
[27:34] That is the fruit of our lips giving
[27:38] praise, giving thanks to his name. But
[27:41] to do good and to communicate, forget
[27:44] not, for with such sacrifices, God is
[27:47] well pleased. So we see what pleases
[27:49] God. God is pleased with the sacrifices
[27:53] of praise continually. God is pleased
[27:55] with the sacrifice that we make. When we
[27:57] make the correct sacrifices that is
[27:59] right in his sight, for such sacrifices,
[28:02] God is well pleased. So our sacrificial
[28:06] offerings made with praise and
[28:08] thanksgiving. But there's also a
[28:10] sacrifice that Jesus made. And this is
[28:12] where I want to bring bring it to a
[28:13] close. And that sacrifice is with our
[28:17] own
[28:19] body. Again, the ministry of the
[28:22] priesthood. We like to talk about the
[28:24] king part. We shall reign on the earth
[28:27] and rule and reign and conquer and walk
[28:28] on the enemy and whatn not every place
[28:30] you put your conquer and so on. But
[28:32] there's also the priest part. And the
[28:34] priest part have to do with sacrifice.
[28:36] Are you willing to make a sacrifice? Are
[28:39] you willing to sacrifice? What are you
[28:41] prepared to sacrifice? And this is where
[28:43] you come to Romans 12 1 and two. I
[28:47] beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[28:50] mercies of God, that you present your
[28:53] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[28:57] acceptable unto God, which is your
[29:00] reasonable service. and be not conformed
[29:03] to this world, but be transformed by the
[29:06] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[29:09] what is that good and acceptable and
[29:11] perfect will of God. So what is the
[29:13] sacrifice that God
[29:15] requires? Just what he wanted of Jesus,
[29:18] he wants of us that represents our
[29:21] bodies. Our bodies become holy when it
[29:25] is laid on the altar of God's service.
[29:29] This body is more than what meets the
[29:33] arm. You know that woman right now
[29:35] talking about my body, my choice and
[29:37] whatn not said of foolishness. But this
[29:40] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[29:44] This is the house that God want to dwell
[29:46] in the spirit. Just as the evil spirit
[29:50] have to get bodies to do mischief, the
[29:52] holy spirit have to get bodies that he
[29:54] could work through to bring on
[29:56] righteousness and so on. He have chosen
[29:58] you. You didn't choose him. He chose
[30:00] you. He chose you just as you are. He
[30:03] chose you in the condition you're in. He
[30:05] chose you knowing all about you, your
[30:07] past and your present. And he chose you
[30:11] knowing that your future is already
[30:13] finished in God. It's a finished work.
[30:16] We just have to go through the process.
[30:19] But Anthony struck it. Those that bring
[30:21] forth fruit, no fruit cut off. Those who
[30:24] bring forth fruit, he purged to bring
[30:26] forth more fruit. And then here is my
[30:29] father glorified and they bring forth
[30:31] much fruit. This gospel is perfect. This
[30:35] word is perfect. This announcement of
[30:38] the kingdom of kings and priests. It is
[30:40] perfect. We have to grow in the
[30:44] ministry. Grow into the kingly ministry.
[30:47] Grow into the priest ministry. Jesus
[30:50] went past prayers and intercession until
[30:54] he could present himself. Here we are
[30:58] exhorted to present ourselves, our
[31:01] bodies, the whole man, body, spirit and
[31:04] soul as a living sacrifice which the
[31:07] Bible identifies as our reasonable
[31:09] service. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly
[31:12] Father, I was thrilled to bring this and
[31:14] share it with your people tonight to
[31:16] present their bodies a living sacrifice
[31:19] to go through the Old Testament, the New
[31:22] Testament that we are supposed to be a
[31:24] royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[31:27] peculiar people, a people called
[31:29] separated unto you, a people that you
[31:31] would find favor with you. A people that
[31:34] will be a treasure unto you. Oh God,
[31:37] your prophet you told in through by and
[31:40] through the bride will be fulfilled. All
[31:43] Jesus, may something supernatural take
[31:45] place tonight in the hearts of your
[31:48] children upon the lives of your people
[31:50] that they could see such a high calling
[31:52] that we are called unto not just to be
[31:55] in church, not just to be believers, but
[31:58] to believe the word that declares that
[32:00] we are to be kings and priests. May they
[32:03] as they go down in prayer tonight accept
[32:06] the reality that
[32:08] Jesus after the order of Melchzdc at his
[32:12] priesthood. He offer up much prayers
[32:15] with tears with oh God groanings and and
[32:19] so on crying unto God. The father of God
[32:22] if he went through all of that. What
[32:24] about us tonight? Give us the burden of
[32:27] the word. Give us the burden of praying.
[32:30] giving them the burden of of of crying
[32:32] on unto you for breakthroughs, for
[32:34] deliverance. And may they see it, may
[32:36] they feel it, may they experience it
[32:38] right in their homes, in their lives.
[32:40] May they not accept that how they are,
[32:43] but may they see what they are to be.
[32:45] But the devil is not challenged by what
[32:47] we are now. What he's challenged by is
[32:50] the possibility of what we can become.
[32:53] And Lord, you put prayer as an avenue to
[32:56] access heaven. You put prayer as an
[32:58] avenue to inspire faith. Anoint the feet
[33:00] of the people tonight as they get on in
[33:02] prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[33:05] amen. So God bless you and I trusting
[33:08] that these words would encourage you
[33:10] tonight to recognize that this calling
[33:12] is a high calling that God has given us.
[33:14] A high calling to surrender and yield
[33:16] ourselves to God. So as you get on in
[33:18] prayer, think on these things. God bless
[33:20] you. Praise the Lord. Amen. So we get in
[33:22] prayer.

[1:30:38] God, will you come and intercede and
[1:30:39] intervene in their lives, Father, and
[1:30:42] make it glorious and make it wonderful
[1:30:44] and make it inspiring that they'll be
[1:30:46] finding themselves to be privileged to
[1:30:48] be called a peculiar people, privileged
[1:30:50] to be called a holy nation, privileged
[1:30:52] to be called a royal priesthood,
[1:30:53] privileged to be called that we could
[1:30:55] walk and show forth your praises. That
[1:30:58] is marvelous light that you send our
[1:31:00] way. This evening light that you send
[1:31:02] our way. Oh God, bless your sons and
[1:31:04] daughters. Bless the Calebs in our
[1:31:05] midst, those that long in the vineyard
[1:31:07] struggling with gray hair and struggling
[1:31:09] with aches and pains. But may you
[1:31:11] minister and meet their very need. Give
[1:31:13] them the comfort, Lord. The comfort, the
[1:31:15] comfort of God. How you brought Israel
[1:31:17] out of Egypt. The destination wasn't
[1:31:19] just a journey. The destination was the
[1:31:21] promised land. But that in itself wasn't
[1:31:23] a destination. That destination was to
[1:31:25] gather a people unto you. You wanted the
[1:31:27] people for yourself. Not for some man,
[1:31:29] not for some church, not for some
[1:31:31] system, but to bring them to yourself.
[1:31:34] Oh God, receive us tonight and may we
[1:31:36] have a closer communion, a closer
[1:31:38] fellowship, a closer relationship with
[1:31:40] you, Father, tonight. Bless your sons
[1:31:42] and daughters. Lord, quicken them to
[1:31:43] your promised word and may they be
[1:31:45] inspired to come out, Lord, this coming
[1:31:47] Sunday to praise and to worship and to
[1:31:49] honor you and may honor their faith and
[1:31:51] their expectation in Jesus name I ask
[1:31:53] it. Amen and amen. God bless you saints
[1:31:56] of God and thanks for being here
[1:31:57] tonight. And I pray God that you have a
[1:32:00] blessed weekend. Looking forward to see
[1:32:02] you on Sunday and you'll be hearing the
[1:32:04] service by the grace of God and hear
[1:32:06] what God have to say to us. God bless
[1:32:08] you. We dismiss tonight.
