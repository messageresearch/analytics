[1:10:04] personal scripture
[1:10:22] oh okay
[1:10:29] I read numbers 13.
[1:10:32] I'll read verses 103 and then I'll skip
[1:10:34] them down to 26 2.
[1:10:38] 33
[1:10:40] and then I also will be reading from
[1:10:43] First Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:10:45] answer Matthew 22.
[1:10:49] so numbers 13
[1:10:52] verses one to three
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:11:07] would you know the story I don't want to
[1:11:09] take too much time in the scriptures so
[1:11:11] I don't register too long but we're
[1:11:15] talking about the abstract searching all
[1:11:17] the way back and so you don't understand
[1:11:21] the message brother Branham said that we
[1:11:23] see many strange things one of the first
[1:11:26] quotes I came across when I came in the
[1:11:29] message newly as a very very young boy
[1:11:33] um so we see many strange things but
[1:11:36] somehow we always find them in the Bible
[1:11:40] amen and the message is back to the
[1:11:43] Bible no matter how nice how sweet how
[1:11:46] reasonable it sounds on reasonable it
[1:11:49] sounds if you don't find in the Bible
[1:11:51] run away from it and that's why you send
[1:11:54] us a prophet to take us back to the
[1:11:56] Bible and the Bible is our homeland
[1:11:58] there's a line of promise
[1:12:01] turning around is a land of bible
[1:12:03] promises
[1:12:06] so we actually are living in the land of
[1:12:08] promise right now
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:11] so this line of Promise is promised to
[1:12:14] them and Moses sent this
[1:12:18] um was trying to send people out to go
[1:12:20] on search out the land and bring back a
[1:12:23] good report about the land
[1:12:25] and that's the same thing the holy
[1:12:27] spirit's still doing come down down
[1:12:29] Through the Ages but especially they
[1:12:31] stay here Holy Spirit come down in the
[1:12:34] ministry and the message of Malachi for
[1:12:36] the Prophet Elijah and goes to search
[1:12:39] all the way and bring a good report to
[1:12:42] us of the land not the physical land but
[1:12:45] a spiritual land of bible promises
[1:12:48] foreign
[1:12:50] so watch Moses here
[1:12:52] verse 1 numbers 13 and the Lord spoken
[1:12:56] to Moses saying
[1:12:58] send thou men that they may search the
[1:13:01] land of Canaan and for this day and age
[1:13:04] here
[1:13:05] this represents the holy spirit in the
[1:13:08] ministry of William Branham amen given
[1:13:12] a commission to a faithful Ministry to
[1:13:15] go on such other land and bring the
[1:13:17] report back to the people
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] to encourage the heart not to make their
[1:13:22] hearts
[1:13:23] you know sing with fear Amen to let them
[1:13:27] know the Giants in the land they are
[1:13:29] like grasshoppers to us amen that's the
[1:13:33] work of the ministry amen amen
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:42] send thou men verse 2 that they may
[1:13:45] search the land of Egypt not look at set
[1:13:48] when you are searching for something you
[1:13:50] are really looking every nook and every
[1:13:52] corner because you are searching
[1:13:55] foreign
[1:13:57] which I gave unto the children of Israel
[1:14:02] of every trouble of the father shall you
[1:14:04] send a man everyone a ruler among them
[1:14:08] and that's why types of the fire for
[1:14:10] Ministry today
[1:14:12] and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord
[1:14:15] send them from the Wilderness apparent
[1:14:18] all those men were heads of the children
[1:14:20] of Israel
[1:14:22] or because the heads origin of Israel
[1:14:25] does that mean they automatically bring
[1:14:27] a report that should be believed let's
[1:14:29] find out verse 26 skip on down to verse
[1:14:32] 26.
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:40] Moses
[1:14:41] unto Aaron
[1:14:43] and to all the congregation
[1:14:45] of the children of Israel unto the
[1:14:47] Wilderness of perin to Kadesh and
[1:14:50] brought back award unto him unto them
[1:14:53] and unto all the congression and show
[1:14:56] them the fruit of the land
[1:14:59] they had fruit and like let's get real
[1:15:01] these guys went into the land and saw
[1:15:05] the land exactly the way Moses said it
[1:15:10] would be Moises that never been in the
[1:15:11] land but he told them was the land was
[1:15:14] gonna be like and they went and found
[1:15:17] what it was like and actually brought
[1:15:21] the fruit from the land and the Bible
[1:15:22] said they needed how many men two men to
[1:15:26] carry the grapes heavy grips of the land
[1:15:29] they're eating and slobbering they saw
[1:15:32] the fruit of the land
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:40] but if that makes them believe
[1:15:46] when people talk about signs wonders
[1:15:49] miracles
[1:15:51] it's feet it's feeding the unbelief in
[1:15:54] their souls whether that's what they're
[1:15:55] looking for because the signs follow the
[1:15:58] believer
[1:15:59] they told Jesus show us a sign and we
[1:16:01] believe you
[1:16:03] Jesus said
[1:16:04] to them that there's no sign you know
[1:16:08] Begins the generation but the son of the
[1:16:10] Prophet Jonas
[1:16:12] Three Days in the Valley of the will and
[1:16:16] rose up again that's the sign
[1:16:20] is that this generation is a junction of
[1:16:23] sign Seekers
[1:16:25] but they don't believe still Jesus knew
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:34] this gospel has signs wonders because
[1:16:37] ingrained in it
[1:16:38] but you don't go searching looking for
[1:16:41] signs and the many in the message I mean
[1:16:42] forgive me the many who sit here too not
[1:16:44] many like plenty but they're one two
[1:16:46] three here that's all they look for
[1:16:49] it's unbelief in your soul that's
[1:16:51] feeding that these guys shove fruit
[1:16:53] fruit
[1:16:54] giant grips
[1:16:56] from the land did they make them believe
[1:16:58] no
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:04] it's back to the world
[1:17:06] the what first
[1:17:10] because with the heart with the heart
[1:17:12] not with the eyes with the heart man
[1:17:15] believes
[1:17:16] with the heart with the heart
[1:17:29] verse 27 and they told him and said we
[1:17:34] came onto the land without thou
[1:17:36] sentenced us
[1:17:37] and surely if Floyd will make an horny
[1:17:40] and this is the fruit of it
[1:17:43] the Holy Spirit Malachi first message
[1:17:44] told us that he told us about the land
[1:17:46] of adoption already what we're going to
[1:17:48] find in the land
[1:17:49] Are We There Yet was it there himself
[1:17:52] yet no but he told us about it and he
[1:17:54] actually went there later Ambrose the
[1:17:57] fruit of the land
[1:17:59] do they believe it
[1:18:01] they rather say they're looking for
[1:18:03] science but they'd rather say those
[1:18:04] signs did not happen
[1:18:12] verse 28 nevertheless nevertheless see
[1:18:16] they saw this they saw it they saw this
[1:18:19] land this these are the people who are
[1:18:20] complaining Egypt Egypt the promised
[1:18:23] land they saw the land and they were it
[1:18:25] wasn't in their heart
[1:18:27] the promised land was not in their heart
[1:18:31] all these guys bashing brother man I'm
[1:18:33] done before they've been believed for 40
[1:18:35] years he was never in their heart
[1:18:38] it was in their heads it was never in
[1:18:41] their hearts What attracted them was the
[1:18:44] signs in the prophet
[1:18:46] but not the world
[1:18:51] there's always a voice to the sign
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:57] let me not take some on all that but I'm
[1:18:59] sure you get the drift
[1:19:02] foreign
[1:19:03] nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless
[1:19:05] it's like you said all right but
[1:19:08] the people
[1:19:10] be strong that dwell in the land
[1:19:13] and the cities are world
[1:19:16] and very great
[1:19:18] and moreover we saw the chewing of
[1:19:22] anak there those are giants
[1:19:25] those are giants Netflix the Bible
[1:19:27] called the Netherlands giants like
[1:19:29] Goliath was from that um
[1:19:33] that that stock Giants with 14 inch the
[1:19:37] fingers were 40 inches long Mighty
[1:19:40] giants like 10 11 feet the basketball
[1:19:43] Styles today will be dwarves compared to
[1:19:45] those guys Giants
[1:19:48] just external focused people looking at
[1:19:50] the impossibilities what will make it
[1:19:53] not come to pass it's not for you
[1:19:56] it's not for you if all you focus on is
[1:19:58] how it's not going to be and that's how
[1:20:00] many people are
[1:20:02] they pray and they are looking for how
[1:20:05] the prayer their show is not going to
[1:20:06] get answered why do you bother to pray
[1:20:08] at all
[1:20:09] because you're sure it's not going to be
[1:20:11] answered so why bother to pray in the
[1:20:13] first instance
[1:20:15] if the god you serve is so weak he can't
[1:20:17] even answer a simple prayer why bother
[1:20:19] to pray
[1:20:34] so they continue with their testimony of
[1:20:37] unbelief
[1:20:40] the amalekites dwell in the land in the
[1:20:42] south
[1:20:43] and he touched on the jebusites and the
[1:20:46] amorites dwell in the mountains and the
[1:20:49] Canaanites dwell by the sea
[1:20:51] and by the coast of Jordan
[1:20:54] how are we going to take care of all
[1:20:56] those people yes it's what you said it's
[1:20:58] true
[1:21:00] but how are we going to take care of all
[1:21:01] those people
[1:21:05] and Caleb
[1:21:07] the end time believer brother calls him
[1:21:09] the one who stood with the holy spirit
[1:21:12] because the Holy Spirit moved on from
[1:21:14] Moses into Joshua
[1:21:17] and Caleb Still the people in other
[1:21:20] words he told them to shut up
[1:21:22] is still the people before moisden said
[1:21:26] let's go up at once and process it
[1:21:29] for We Are we are well able you know we
[1:21:32] are more than
[1:21:33] it to overcome it how many fields are we
[1:21:36] today
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:39] but more than able whatever it be
[1:21:42] whether it be spiritual natural whether
[1:21:46] it be whatever materials whatever
[1:21:48] spiritual whatever your your body your
[1:21:51] health whatever what is the promise what
[1:21:55] is the promise

[1:21:59] the promise say
[1:22:01] good health that's your land a promise
[1:22:04] we are more than able to take it amen do
[1:22:07] you believe that we are well able to
[1:22:10] take it are you well this morning
[1:22:13] are you ready defy
[1:22:15] every negative we are well able to take
[1:22:18] it amen amen
[1:22:22] amen you may be seated while I go on
[1:22:27] but the man that went up with him said
[1:22:31] unbelief doesn't keep quiet doesn't go
[1:22:33] away quick quickly because you insist
[1:22:36] unbelief doesn't go away they see the
[1:22:37] Miracles they won't touch them
[1:22:41] it won't touch them
[1:22:45] but the man that went on with him said
[1:22:48] we've been not able to go up against
[1:22:50] those people
[1:22:52] for they are stronger than we want the
[1:22:54] testimony what believers
[1:23:03] and they brought up an evil report
[1:23:05] of a land with that searched unto the
[1:23:08] children of Israel saying this these are
[1:23:10] like in modern day ministers so why are
[1:23:12] you surprised about people backing up
[1:23:14] for major 40 years after these are
[1:23:15] ministers they were chosen chosen men
[1:23:18] chosen to go and sell the land and bring
[1:23:20] a report back to the people like this
[1:23:22] morning go straight to the land
[1:23:23] ministers go study of the land the land
[1:23:25] of bible promises study read the word
[1:23:27] get inspiration bring nuggets there for
[1:23:30] you and bring it to the to the people
[1:23:31] and show them evidence of the land
[1:23:34] amen and show them what's in the land
[1:23:37] whatever for all of your life and
[1:23:39] godliness issues
[1:23:41] for sickness for health for your school
[1:23:45] for your work for your life with God
[1:23:47] your life your fellow man it's all in
[1:23:50] the land it's all taken care of in the
[1:23:52] land so we bring the report to you but
[1:23:55] is it a good report on the evil report
[1:23:58] once whoever things are
[1:24:00] good most everything is lovely
[1:24:03] bring this report to the people so they
[1:24:06] can think on this good and good reports
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:18] but the men that went up with him said
[1:24:19] we'll be not able to go up against those
[1:24:21] people for they are stronger than we
[1:24:24] and they put up an evil report of the
[1:24:26] land which they had searched unto the
[1:24:27] children of Israel saying the land
[1:24:30] though which we have gone to search it
[1:24:33] is the land that that eat it of the
[1:24:36] inhabitants thereof
[1:24:38] and all the people that we saw in it are
[1:24:40] men of great stature
[1:24:43] men of great stature
[1:24:46] and then we saw the Giants
[1:24:49] which come of the Giants and we were in
[1:24:53] our own sight as grasshoppers the Giants
[1:24:56] didn't tell them that
[1:24:58] Jonathan tell them that
[1:25:00] we were in our own sight as grasshoppers
[1:25:05] and so we were in their sight
[1:25:11] remember where coming from
[1:25:13] when people see their problems as being
[1:25:17] external based there's nothing troubling
[1:25:20] you that's from outside of you nothing
[1:25:22] nothing
[1:25:24] absolutely nothing
[1:25:26] there's nothing external that is
[1:25:29] powerful enough to trouble you nothing
[1:25:32] Jesus said as a matter of fact nothing
[1:25:34] is not the things that go into a man
[1:25:36] that defiled the man but the things that
[1:25:39] come from within the defrost the man and
[1:25:42] so a young man asked me before here one
[1:25:45] of the times I had a question that
[1:25:46] answers said so so if I smoke it's not
[1:25:50] the things that go in that defiles the
[1:25:52] man
[1:25:53] so I smoke then I'm not defiled so
[1:25:56] there's nothing wrong with smoking
[1:25:58] I said well
[1:25:59] before you did before you took the
[1:26:02] cigarette to smoke
[1:26:03] something told your hands to take the
[1:26:06] cigarette and that's something from
[1:26:08] within
[1:26:10] because when you are asleep your hand
[1:26:12] doesn't even know what is doing so
[1:26:14] something that's conscious lets your
[1:26:17] hand move and do what it does so that
[1:26:20] cigarette is only that is only a
[1:26:22] manifestation of a desire
[1:26:24] from inside
[1:26:27] the what of Jesus
[1:26:29] nothing external
[1:26:32] there's nothing until you and I stop
[1:26:35] looking on the outside as things that
[1:26:39] are going to get us they're going to
[1:26:40] there's nothing external
[1:26:43] that's going to get you
[1:26:45] unless you
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:47] allow it you nothing let me not run
[1:26:50] ahead of myself
[1:26:53] but these guys were so sure these Giants
[1:26:55] are going to get us but the one of the
[1:26:58] laws that they had was too small to meet
[1:27:00] the challenge of the hour too small not
[1:27:03] enough
[1:27:05] it's not big enough to face the
[1:27:10] conditions and the challenges that they
[1:27:12] had
[1:27:15] anyone that they didn't go into the
[1:27:16] Promised Land
[1:27:19] First Corinthians 2 verse 6-16
[1:27:23] how big
[1:27:24] we speak wisdom among them that are
[1:27:27] perfect
[1:27:28] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[1:27:30] princes of this world not of the prince
[1:27:33] of this world that come to not
[1:27:35] wisdom Holy Spirit searching and
[1:27:38] bringing our wisdom
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:42] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:27:43] mystery so the mysteries from Malachi 4
[1:27:46] is given to us the wisdom of God and
[1:27:49] wisdom is the principle thing the Bible
[1:27:50] says
[1:27:52] even the
[1:27:55] which God ordained before the world unto
[1:27:57] our Glory the three full mystery of God
[1:28:01] Malachi 4 brought out the hidden wisdom
[1:28:04] of God ordained before the world
[1:28:08] unto our Glory
[1:28:10] which none of the prince of this world
[1:28:13] knew for had they known it they would
[1:28:15] not have crucified the Lord's Glory
[1:28:19] in other words there's so many hidden
[1:28:22] that the prince of this world these
[1:28:23] Giants don't know that's what those
[1:28:25] person don't understand
[1:28:27] there's a path to Victory they do like I
[1:28:30] can't see a party success there someone
[1:28:32] said I can't say the path to the money
[1:28:33] some business I can see the parts of the
[1:28:35] morning here and somebody says that I
[1:28:37] can't say the path to literal Victory
[1:28:39] here
[1:28:40] these guys this spies did not see the
[1:28:44] path to success
[1:28:46] against these Giants
[1:28:49] but the Giants themselves did not see
[1:28:54] they didn't have a clue
[1:28:56] how these guys were going to beat them
[1:29:00] because that's hidden in God
[1:29:04] and only the Holy Spirit can score
[1:29:08] search that out and give it to
[1:29:10] whomsoever he Wills
[1:29:14] that's why he's such a little flock
[1:29:16] Little Flock too many are so fixated on
[1:29:19] what their eyes tell them
[1:29:21] was their eyes tell them
[1:29:24] and why is that because they don't spend
[1:29:26] the time enough
[1:29:29] with God in his presence with his word
[1:29:32] with a revealed word they don't spend
[1:29:34] the time they spend the time with
[1:29:36] Netflix home movie and all that how you
[1:29:40] gonna grow with that
[1:29:42] I cannot get away from natural what what
[1:29:46] you see around you is what makes you
[1:29:47] your heart Frets at everything that goes
[1:29:49] around you
[1:29:52] Glory
[1:29:55] but we speak the wisdom of God
[1:29:58] in a mystery
[1:30:05] even the hidden wisdom
[1:30:07] which God ordained before the wall unto
[1:30:09] our Glory which none of the prince of
[1:30:11] this world knew for they known it they
[1:30:13] will not touch Christ
[1:30:16] are going to kill him but
[1:30:17] in killing him they killed themselves
[1:30:20] that's this gospel
[1:30:23] that's the gospel of the supernatural
[1:30:25] you can't explain with your intellectual
[1:30:27] understanding
[1:30:32] phrase is written
[1:30:34] I have not seen nor ear heard neither
[1:30:37] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:30:39] things which God has prepared for them
[1:30:40] they love him but God has revealed them
[1:30:43] unto us by the spirit
[1:30:46] the spirit the abstract that can search
[1:30:50] the Deep things of God
[1:30:53] to shed light and shine light to Europe
[1:30:58] how did David know Goliath was going to
[1:31:00] go down how did he know
[1:31:03] to the Natural intellect there's no way
[1:31:06] Goliath was going to go down
[1:31:09] no way
[1:31:11] but was given and revealed to him
[1:31:15] pick up five rocks but you only need one
[1:31:17] of them but you need to pick up five
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:29] but God revealed lemon To Us by Spirit
[1:31:32] verse 10
[1:31:34] for the spirit such at all things
[1:31:36] yea the Deep things of God
[1:31:39] the spirit the abstract is interested
[1:31:43] only in the depth of God and so when you
[1:31:46] have this superficial Christian
[1:31:48] experience you know what is you have no
[1:31:51] real contact with thee
[1:31:53] abstract the holy spirit that shines
[1:31:56] Blood on the world
[1:32:00] and he's a gentleman he's not going to
[1:32:01] frost you
[1:32:02] and he doesn't need you he doesn't need
[1:32:04] me
[1:32:05] we are the ones that need him
[1:32:08] anything valuable God does it keeps on
[1:32:11] the inside your soul is on your on top
[1:32:13] of your head your household is inside
[1:32:15] in a place of death because God wants us
[1:32:17] to live from a place of depth okay
[1:32:21] and the Holy Spirit searches the Deep
[1:32:23] things of God and reveals it to
[1:32:25] whomsoever he Wills those who are
[1:32:28] interested in the Deep things of God
[1:32:32] for what men were the things of a man
[1:32:33] say the spirit of that man which is in
[1:32:35] him even so the things of God not no man
[1:32:38] but the spirit of God
[1:32:40] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:32:42] the world intellect
[1:32:44] but the spirit which is of god the Holy
[1:32:47] Spirit the abstract
[1:32:49] to the tattoo deed thou we might know
[1:32:52] the things that have freely given to us
[1:32:54] of God in other words the things that
[1:32:55] forgiven us God the world the the title
[1:32:58] did the what the message but just
[1:33:00] written it means nothing
[1:33:02] the Holy Spirit the abstractness to
[1:33:04] shine light on it so you might know a
[1:33:07] knowledge and understand and know so
[1:33:11] everybody can read brother brahm's
[1:33:13] message
[1:33:14] the pope can read it but he needs the
[1:33:18] Holy Spirit the abstract to search it
[1:33:21] out and give it to him that he might
[1:33:22] know the things that are freely given to
[1:33:24] us
[1:33:25] of God
[1:33:27] amen can you say Amen
[1:33:29] foreign
[1:33:39] given to us now we see them we freely
[1:33:42] speak them because freely you have
[1:33:44] received
[1:33:45] freely give which things also we speak
[1:33:48] knowing the word what which man's Wisdom
[1:33:52] teacheth
[1:33:53] are put into your intellect but with the
[1:33:55] Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:33:57] comparing spiritual things with
[1:33:59] spiritual for the natural man receiving
[1:34:01] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:34:03] their foolishness unto him neither can
[1:34:05] he know them because they are
[1:34:07] spiritually designed for either a
[1:34:09] spiritual judge of all things yet
[1:34:11] himself is Judge of no man for who had
[1:34:13] known the man of the Lord
[1:34:15] that he may instruct him but we have the
[1:34:17] man of Christ
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:21] finalists in Matthew 22 and verse 34 to
[1:34:24] 40. when the freshes that had that he
[1:34:27] had put these services to silence they
[1:34:29] were gathered together
[1:34:30] and one of them which was a lawyer asked
[1:34:32] him a question chanting him and saying
[1:34:34] Master which is the great commandment in
[1:34:36] the law
[1:34:38] Jesus said unto him thou shall love the
[1:34:40] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[1:34:41] all thy soul and with all thy mind this
[1:34:44] is the first and great commandment
[1:34:46] and the second is like until it thou
[1:34:48] shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:34:50] on these two Commandments hang all the
[1:34:53] law and the prophets amen Lord that is
[1:34:56] blessing to read all his holy words amen
[1:34:59] all right um
[1:35:01] let's try and see if we can wind
[1:35:04] it down today
[1:35:08] the last amount I chat this last
[1:35:10] scripture we read here and it's in the
[1:35:13] other goes supposed to I think Mark
[1:35:15] Matthew Mark and Luke has the scripture
[1:35:18] I mean the same story from a different
[1:35:21] context each one of them all of them
[1:35:23] talked about the two great Commandments
[1:35:26] and if you go to Deuteronomy chapter 6
[1:35:28] you'll see this great commandment verses
[1:35:30] 3 2 19 thereabouts
[1:35:32] more use than the people
[1:35:35] here all Israel the Lord that God is one
[1:35:38] and thou shall love the Lord that God
[1:35:40] with all thy heart with other soul and
[1:35:42] with other mind and then it breaks it
[1:35:44] down and explains what that means
[1:35:46] what that means which we talked about
[1:35:48] that before how it affects you when you
[1:35:51] lie down when you stand up when you
[1:35:52] sleep it affects every area of you
[1:35:54] that's how you love God
[1:35:56] not just on Sunday morning church every
[1:35:58] area of you go read Deuteronomy 6 when
[1:36:01] you are lying at home when you are
[1:36:03] standing when you are walking when you
[1:36:04] are going and when you're coming in
[1:36:06] that's how you love God with your heart
[1:36:07] soul and mind
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:10] it actually it it it it it it engulfs
[1:36:14] your whole life it affects your life
[1:36:16] every hour
[1:36:19] and Jesus said Jesus Jesus when he came
[1:36:22] he and this uh scripture we just read
[1:36:24] here he expanded on that father
[1:36:26] and said that's your duty to God
[1:36:31] that's a rich God because they came and
[1:36:33] asked him Master which is a great
[1:36:35] commandment in other words narrow up
[1:36:37] there's so many Commandments narrow it
[1:36:39] down to one commandment for us in other
[1:36:41] words
[1:36:45] and Jesus didn't tell them
[1:36:46] get you know we complicate things too
[1:36:49] much too much we have the rule for this
[1:36:52] rule for that rule for this rule for
[1:36:53] that look all of The Commandments in the
[1:36:56] Bible
[1:36:59] Jesus said every one of them can be
[1:37:03] narrowed down to these two things two
[1:37:04] things
[1:37:06] he said thou shall love the Lord thy God
[1:37:09] with all thy soul with all thy heart
[1:37:12] Lord thy mind
[1:37:13] and Deuteronomy shows you what it means
[1:37:15] to love the love thy God with that Soul
[1:37:17] heart and mind it engulfses your whole
[1:37:19] life
[1:37:21] when you're lying down when you are
[1:37:23] walking on the wall on the street in the
[1:37:26] neighborhood in school everywhere
[1:37:29] no one life at work another life at
[1:37:31] school another life at home your life is
[1:37:34] the same the love of God is oozing out
[1:37:37] of you everywhere you are
[1:37:42] and he said and the second is like unto
[1:37:45] it because you have very spiritual
[1:37:47] people who are very spiritual and love
[1:37:49] God but they they love God they live in
[1:37:52] a world a world of uh a world of
[1:37:56] and unreal world
[1:37:59] where they are alone in a war with God
[1:38:01] they I mean many people throw you quotes
[1:38:04] in a world along with God and all that
[1:38:06] Jesus said when you're in that world
[1:38:07] along with God
[1:38:09] it shows in the natural Realm
[1:38:12] because you are a Triumph being
[1:38:15] Spirit soul body because you Traverse
[1:38:17] the spiritual and the natural
[1:38:20] so because before you get too spiritual
[1:38:23] and too super duper the second
[1:38:26] commandment is like unto it
[1:38:29] thou shall Love Thy Neighbor
[1:38:33] as thyself
[1:38:35] and Jesus's life showed us how to love
[1:38:38] your neighbor as yourself
[1:38:41] and he said on these two Commandments
[1:38:44] hang all the law and the prophets
[1:38:47] I don't want to take your time I can
[1:38:49] show you many things in life there are
[1:38:50] so many so many I'll show you like the
[1:38:53] experts are putting on to two things
[1:38:54] three things two things three things
[1:38:57] all the principles in the Bible
[1:38:59] all the principles of life you can bring
[1:39:02] them the Bible bring them out to one
[1:39:03] thing
[1:39:04] what you sow you reap
[1:39:07] all the principles in the world
[1:39:10] brings them down to one
[1:39:12] because God know to simplify things so
[1:39:15] you don't say I couldn't remember 200 of
[1:39:18] the principles no bring it down to one
[1:39:21] and Jesus here brought all of life down
[1:39:23] to these two Commandments
[1:39:27] love the neighbor I mean love God and
[1:39:29] love thy neighbor as thyself and that's
[1:39:33] the story in the Bible
[1:39:35] that's a story in the Bible which is um
[1:39:39] which is
[1:39:40] which is
[1:39:42] all there is in life
[1:39:45] is narrowed down to your relationship
[1:39:47] with God
[1:39:48] I wish you a fellow man
[1:39:51] relationship with God
[1:39:53] must reflect in relationship with your
[1:39:54] fellow man if you don't have
[1:39:56] relationship with God you actually with
[1:39:58] no man means very little
[1:40:00] but the primary thing is that line with
[1:40:04] God
[1:40:05] shot in with God in a secret place there
[1:40:08] in the spirit behold in his face gaining
[1:40:10] no power to run in the race I'd like to
[1:40:13] reach I long to be shutting with God
[1:40:15] that's the primary thing the mystery of
[1:40:18] godliness how to be Godly in this life
[1:40:22] and in this world godliness
[1:40:25] amen
[1:40:26] and when you are that way it shows and
[1:40:28] reflects and the second is like unto it
[1:40:32] in other words same principle
[1:40:34] and the principle
[1:40:36] Moses showed us in the Old Testament
[1:40:39] when you walk when you stand when you
[1:40:42] are lying down everywhere in the field
[1:40:45] in the house on the in the yard
[1:40:47] everywhere love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:40:50] on these two Commandments
[1:40:53] hang on the law you can narrow all the
[1:40:55] law and all the Commandments into these
[1:40:57] two
[1:40:58] and that boils down to life and
[1:41:01] godliness
[1:41:03] that's why we spent the last last time
[1:41:06] doing that's what it is all about
[1:41:09] so you don't have people who are so
[1:41:11] spiritual
[1:41:13] they don't care they are Heavenly
[1:41:16] Creatures
[1:41:17] they forget their a twofold in one on
[1:41:20] the earth to die
[1:41:21] wanting heaven to leave
[1:41:23] they are just living in heaven right now
[1:41:25] forget like that they're human beings on
[1:41:26] the face of the Earth
[1:41:29] who need to interact with the wall
[1:41:31] around them and that's what God put into
[1:41:34] the elements of the training that he
[1:41:37] gave adam and he gave he gives us even
[1:41:39] though many of us don't recognize it but
[1:41:42] if we do we'll set up our lives and the
[1:41:45] lives of the people will train our
[1:41:47] children whoever else for greatness
[1:41:50] for greatness
[1:41:58] so God
[1:42:00] narrows it down and Jesus showed us to
[1:42:03] life ungodliness and the godliness comes
[1:42:07] first
[1:42:09] and so God every child that comes in
[1:42:14] he speaks to him for godliness a
[1:42:17] relationship with God and in that
[1:42:19] relationship God is showing them how to
[1:42:21] interact with the world around them
[1:42:25] showing them how to about affection and
[1:42:29] memory and reasoning imagination and
[1:42:32] conscience
[1:42:33] how to interact with the world around
[1:42:35] them
[1:42:38] godliness controlling the things you do
[1:42:40] in life that's why I deal with Adam put
[1:42:42] his soul there for us and putting their
[1:42:44] godliness godliness to the word of God
[1:42:47] the word of God and then he put him in
[1:42:49] body of Flesh and sometimes show him the
[1:42:51] things that put into this natural War
[1:42:53] here
[1:42:54] walk
[1:42:56] responsibility accountability
[1:42:58] relationships marriage
[1:43:03] how to love his neighbor as himself love
[1:43:05] God and love your neighbor yourself
[1:43:08] it's so clearly I can see it can you say
[1:43:11] amen amen
[1:43:14] so
[1:43:16] excuse me
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:23] second Peter says
[1:43:26] he has given us all things the potential
[1:43:29] life and goodness and my contention is
[1:43:32] that is that because you see that Faith
[1:43:34] virtue knowledge Temperance I don't even
[1:43:36] know what it means you don't even know
[1:43:37] what you're talking about
[1:43:38] my contention is that that's what got it
[1:43:41] for Adam and that's what God is for
[1:43:42] every single one of us
[1:43:44] every single one of us
[1:43:48] because he brought us into this world
[1:43:50] here and he made sure he gave every
[1:43:53] single man not just the seed of God
[1:43:55] every single man what they need to
[1:43:56] thrive on this face of this up here
[1:43:58] whether you are rich or you don't need
[1:44:00] to buy oxygen no you don't need to
[1:44:02] whether you are rich or poor you don't
[1:44:04] need to understand how to love your mom
[1:44:06] no you don't have to go and buy it if
[1:44:08] that was it many people would not be
[1:44:09] able to do it but God's grace gave to us
[1:44:13] all the potential life and godliness
[1:44:15] amen many people want the ones that
[1:44:18] penis in life but they don't want the on
[1:44:19] the godliness but God
[1:44:21] that is the godliness comes first
[1:44:24] because he created the man the spirit
[1:44:27] man for us the godliness
[1:44:29] and then he added the life issues in
[1:44:33] Genesis 2.
[1:44:35] 15-25 Man became a living soul and then
[1:44:38] began to teach him how to do this how to
[1:44:41] do that how to do this how to do that we
[1:44:42] got to teach him all of those things
[1:44:44] so he had a complete Hotel son who was
[1:44:48] programmed conditioned trained by God to
[1:44:52] be phenomenal in life and actually live
[1:44:55] like God on the face of the Earth
[1:45:00] for Adam it wasn't just
[1:45:03] nice words for Adam it was
[1:45:06] a training for life
[1:45:08] for Adam it was how he would be an
[1:45:11] amateur God on the face of this Earth
[1:45:12] here
[1:45:13] for Adam he wasn't just coming to church
[1:45:15] on a Sunday morning
[1:45:17] for Adam it was a life and death
[1:45:19] situation
[1:45:20] because he needed to be
[1:45:23] an amateur God on the face of this Earth
[1:45:25] for God his father amen
[1:45:29] so the two were connected together in
[1:45:32] the soul of man that's where the
[1:45:34] connection so
[1:45:37] God gave adam all that in there for life
[1:45:40] and godliness but for the spiritual and
[1:45:43] the natural how many understand I say
[1:45:45] amen amen all right
[1:45:48] and my insistence that he has given us
[1:45:51] also the same things the Bible says he
[1:45:53] has given us nothing all ever everything
[1:45:56] that we need for life and godliness like
[1:45:59] the song says all I have needed the hand
[1:46:02] hath provided
[1:46:03] if we actually
[1:46:06] really it will reduce our stress levels
[1:46:09] in many things we stress ourselves about
[1:46:12] to reduce the stress levels that we give
[1:46:14] ourselves
[1:46:18] many times we carry on as though this
[1:46:21] God will serve is sleeping somewhere or
[1:46:23] he doesn't even have ears to hear
[1:46:26] oh
[1:46:28] and when we live like that when you live
[1:46:31] like that you don't think you can do it
[1:46:33] he will not do it
[1:46:36] because that's it's not because I don't
[1:46:37] want to do it that's his nature You've
[1:46:39] Got to Believe
[1:46:40] you've got to absolutely believe for the
[1:46:43] problems that believe with all your
[1:46:45] heart believe with all your heart you
[1:46:46] don't believe and don't doubt in your
[1:46:48] heart
[1:46:50] as you're sitting there listening to me
[1:46:52] I want to be thinking back about your
[1:46:55] life don't bother by your husband your
[1:46:57] wife I'm not about you because I want to
[1:46:58] bring that down to you
[1:46:59] because if you're going to break the
[1:47:01] cycle and the inference of those things
[1:47:03] in your life you're going to do for
[1:47:04] yourself
[1:47:08] and you're going to be very brutally
[1:47:09] Frank with yourself
[1:47:11] amen
[1:47:14] so God has also given us the same
[1:47:17] without his God it changes not
[1:47:20] what he gave adam he gives us
[1:47:22] like I've been talking all the time
[1:47:24] about little children the natural and
[1:47:26] all that God gives every man liberally
[1:47:32] like Adam
[1:47:34] all the things that put into life and
[1:47:36] godliness
[1:47:38] will only build in US positive issues of
[1:47:40] life because it's in a source positive
[1:47:43] issues of life
[1:47:45] what's the program in conditioning for
[1:47:48] positive to live a great life to live a
[1:47:51] life full of successes and any challenge
[1:47:54] we call it as though it's not there
[1:47:57] amen
[1:48:00] they promised land but what did the
[1:48:03] promise say
[1:48:04] what is the promise say
[1:48:12] and Frankly Speaking personally I don't
[1:48:13] have too much interest in in
[1:48:16] uh
[1:48:18] um
[1:48:18] the gospel that only makes your yourself
[1:48:22] God you come to church you do this and
[1:48:24] then you don't do anything else
[1:48:26] because the Ephraim I have seen maybe
[1:48:28] you haven't seen that even that I have
[1:48:30] seen Among Us message groups and for us
[1:48:33] in the Thunders I saw that especially
[1:48:35] after the Julian episode
[1:48:37] we're very good on the spiritual
[1:48:40] the inspiration the world get baptized
[1:48:43] the Holy Ghost but there's nobody
[1:48:44] teaching us to live a Christian Life
[1:48:47] Israel almost forgot these things and
[1:48:50] not for your head or just to make you
[1:48:52] feel spiritual
[1:48:53] what is to believe in on the outside is
[1:48:57] a godliness showing out in your life
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:09] so we just we're very good at you know
[1:49:11] great mystery prick message that's gonna
[1:49:15] Maple's heads swell and wow great and
[1:49:18] people just just a few people Allah in
[1:49:22] my life but most of the people just for
[1:49:24] their heads
[1:49:26] and then you find us admiring Brothers
[1:49:28] the life he lived when is the same one
[1:49:31] he gave us that gives him the ability to
[1:49:33] leave that life but because nobody told
[1:49:36] us that this war here is not for your
[1:49:38] head is to drop in your heart and show
[1:49:40] forth in your life
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:52] so let's get back to the child
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:57] so God trains every little child
[1:49:59] and programs them fashion them for
[1:50:01] greatness tell me the child that doesn't
[1:50:04] have great hopes for the future
[1:50:07] tell me the child that doesn't hope to
[1:50:08] conquer the wall tell me the other
[1:50:10] doesn't hope to
[1:50:11] you know be phenomenal in their lives
[1:50:13] Jeremy the parent that doesn't want that
[1:50:15] child to be phenomenal tell me the
[1:50:17] parent the original child should be to
[1:50:18] do great things
[1:50:21] only problem many times that we want
[1:50:23] them to do great things in natural
[1:50:24] non-spiritual
[1:50:26] the spiritual we are comfortable with
[1:50:27] them having a so-so kind of life we are
[1:50:30] comfortable with that
[1:50:32] we're comfortable with it they saw so
[1:50:34] kind of life for our children but not in
[1:50:37] the natural and natural want them to be
[1:50:38] great
[1:50:39] whichever way
[1:50:41] show me the child or the parent that
[1:50:43] doesn't want the child to be phenomenal
[1:50:45] or doesn't want to be phenomenal in
[1:50:47] their lives show me the child that wants
[1:50:48] to be just a regular person
[1:50:51] I'll talk about brother Bailey and
[1:50:53] brother yummy and I've been in medical
[1:50:54] school together
[1:50:55] but nobody wanted to come out of medical
[1:50:58] school and be a doctor in some small
[1:51:00] place no we want to be the one that's
[1:51:03] doing great things I'm very successful
[1:51:06] whenever you go to school whatever study
[1:51:08] course you are studying that's what you
[1:51:09] have in your heart if you don't have
[1:51:11] that in your heart going to school
[1:51:12] there's something wrong with you
[1:51:14] there's something wrong if you want to
[1:51:16] have that first and hunger and you have
[1:51:18] to be phenomenal there's something wrong
[1:51:19] with you
[1:51:22] you don't have that in your heart to be
[1:51:24] excellent and ex live in this in the
[1:51:27] Stars there's something wrong with you
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:31] even if you're a laborer be the stand
[1:51:33] out laborer
[1:51:36] that's why you call Dignity of Labor
[1:51:41] if you're a cleaner be the best there is
[1:51:44] if you don't have that in your heart
[1:51:45] there's something wrong with you if you
[1:51:47] just work for your pay there's something
[1:51:48] wrong with you it's something against
[1:51:51] your spiritual DNA from God especially
[1:51:54] as a child of God that you're supposed
[1:51:56] to be Amen
[1:51:59] brother Brahms that God doesn't want his
[1:52:01] children to be ordinary he said I don't
[1:52:03] want my children to be ordinary talking
[1:52:05] about the ritual I said is wanting to be
[1:52:07] extraordinary that's what I want for my
[1:52:10] children that's what God wants for his
[1:52:11] children I mean how much extraordinary
[1:52:14] can you be than to be God on the face of
[1:52:16] the Earth
[1:52:19] we also be God on the face of the Earth
[1:52:22] that's phenomenal it has been the best
[1:52:25] there isn't anything best Christian

[1:53:10] Billy Paul
[1:53:12] and said but he wasn't going to be
[1:53:14] looking want him to be a preacher but he
[1:53:17] didn't have the gift I said but the
[1:53:19] Branham said
[1:53:23] but show me the code that negates that
[1:53:27] [Music]

[1:54:32] that scripture that's a spiritual man's
[1:54:35] life
[1:54:36] [Applause]
[1:54:39] he said even if you choose to be a thief
[1:54:42] to make the point be the best sin there
[1:54:45] is

[1:56:45] strong the love that God is with thee
[1:56:47] amen
[1:56:51] all right
[1:56:53] so that's how God programmed his
[1:56:56] children
[1:56:57] to be the best there is
[1:57:01] the best in Behavior the best in the way
[1:57:04] they talk look at the Bible look at the
[1:57:05] Bible look at the strings of the Bible
[1:57:07] get to make you just so so get to make
[1:57:09] you the best there is
[1:57:17] and that's how every child is that child
[1:57:20] is on the verge of accountability
[1:57:22] dreaming to Take On The World
[1:57:26] and those of them who get saved in that
[1:57:27] Asia want to be the best there is
[1:57:31] in terms of their Christian existence
[1:57:32] that's who God is
[1:57:35] how will God the great God of the
[1:57:37] universe make mediocre children
[1:57:40] Adam was a mediocre
[1:57:41] and I'm at Absolute Authority on the
[1:57:43] face of the Earth are you with me
[1:57:47] are you with me are you sure you're with
[1:57:49] me
[1:57:50] all right
[1:57:55] but then what happened to us what
[1:57:56] happened
[1:57:58] parents
[1:58:00] parents are what happened to parents
[1:58:01] happen to us
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:12] and I've seen enough of that myself I
[1:58:14] mean you have but maybe but we've all
[1:58:16] seen enough of that I've seen enough of
[1:58:18] that myself the parents are
[1:58:21] two medals so many times very medicine
[1:58:26] I admit many times it's because you
[1:58:28] think that's the best thing to do but
[1:58:30] but for Spiritual people should know
[1:58:33] better
[1:58:38] because parents are training and
[1:58:40] parental influence and influence of
[1:58:42] other people that we look up to our
[1:58:44] mentors like my little child
[1:58:46] you begin to Palm them with into these
[1:58:49] negative things there
[1:58:50] not from God there's no negativity in
[1:58:52] God God brought positive there that's
[1:58:55] why you don't come to church people
[1:58:57] negative things don't tell people this
[1:58:59] church is better this church there's
[1:59:00] something wrong with them you should not
[1:59:02] do that on a property in church
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:05] you should not come in here young men
[1:59:07] young woman and spread your Fields with
[1:59:09] your friends around here
[1:59:11] God God doesn't have God has nothing
[1:59:15] negative about him
[1:59:18] they should not come in this house here
[1:59:20] or
[1:59:22] and spirit evil and negative gossip and
[1:59:25] negativity that's not God's spirit
[1:59:28] God's spirit is positive if you have no
[1:59:31] important to say shut your mouth
[1:59:34] is
[1:59:37] okay all right
[1:59:40] this job that church this church here no
[1:59:44] this church I've told you before is a
[1:59:46] sick day
[1:59:47] is the sick Jesus said that in the
[1:59:49] physician not the healthy
[1:59:53] if you are healthy help us to make them
[1:59:55] healthy but don't say look at them here
[1:59:58] that church yeah look at what they think
[1:59:59] that church here stay and be help us to
[2:00:01] be the ones that know what is right to
[2:00:03] do and do it
[2:00:10] son of man has come to save
[2:00:12] and seek that which was lost
[2:00:18] but parents when they come to that child
[2:00:22] their parents have to interact with a
[2:00:24] child in the age of our country I mean
[2:00:25] that age of innocence and they begin to
[2:00:27] introduce negative stuff negative stuff
[2:00:30] negative programming
[2:00:35] and what that does it begins to bring a
[2:00:38] challenge to what God taught us on the
[2:00:40] inside
[2:00:45] to program us to live lives not of
[2:00:48] greatness
[2:00:50] but of negativity
[2:00:52] lives of mediocrity
[2:00:54] lives that have like you know values
[2:00:57] that shaded to what the family wants
[2:01:00] what their tribe wants what their you
[2:01:04] know Clan believes not what the word of
[2:01:06] God says
[2:01:10] and it's these negative issues
[2:01:12] that make up most what we call are known
[2:01:16] as generational crosses
[2:01:19] um says over and over and over again so
[2:01:21] you don't go after this and start
[2:01:22] thinking about somebody dinner there are
[2:01:24] people who try to do stuff to you
[2:01:26] I had too much of it in Christianity I'm
[2:01:28] just wondering like what kind of a god
[2:01:29] do we serve
[2:01:32] I've had message George is saying like
[2:01:33] that I mean
[2:01:39] I mean I'm saying it I mean I mean this
[2:01:41] season generational issues and all that
[2:01:43] because one of you with Netflix and all
[2:01:46] that you have gone to these Nigerian
[2:01:47] movies and you've seen like that how
[2:01:48] somebody is shooting you an arrow
[2:01:50] animation and so people are going around
[2:01:51] they see a botfly they see a boat on top
[2:01:53] of their house is somebody that's
[2:01:55] sending the board there all kind of
[2:01:56] crazy stuff
[2:01:58] [Applause]
[2:02:03] Go movie too much Netflix too much

[2:02:07] troubling you
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:11] she's a more spiritual attacks and all
[2:02:13] of that and things like that there is
[2:02:15] nothing from outside of you that has the
[2:02:18] power to keep you
[2:02:20] [Applause]
[2:02:21] that's the word of the Lord you may be
[2:02:24] seated
[2:02:27] you can afford to live fearlessly you
[2:02:30] can afford to live with abandonment
[2:02:33] there is nothing that can touch you
[2:02:35] because the Bible says no weapon
[2:02:39] no weapon that's passion against you
[2:02:42] shall prosper it shall not prosper
[2:02:47] Hallelujah you may be seated

[2:03:41] evidence name is not sin faith is
[2:03:43] positive tell me what about God that's
[2:03:45] negative people claim great faith but
[2:03:49] they are always gossiping they always
[2:03:51] seem what's not good about that person
[2:03:52] no that you don't have faith no you
[2:03:55] don't have faith that's the secret of
[2:03:56] William branham's life
[2:03:58] when you have faith you will see
[2:04:00] everything positive
[2:04:02] and negative when people are filthy and
[2:04:06] in sin you may be seated Glory Glory

[2:04:17] no you don't have breakfast when you do
[2:04:19] all the gossip you don't have great
[2:04:20] faith when all you talk about is what
[2:04:22] this person did what that person did
[2:04:23] whether personally just criticize you
[2:04:25] don't have great faith no faith says the
[2:04:28] things that are the things that be not
[2:04:30] as though they are and the negative
[2:04:32] faces you are not in the picture so what
[2:04:34] faith does faith includes righteousness
