[0:55] world Amen so God Rich you bless you as
[0:58] we hear the word of the Lord amen
[1:01] you can have your seats at it's
[1:14] time Jesus Christ his
[1:17] son and has given us all things freely
[1:21] in
[1:23] Christ we are grateful to thee Lord for
[1:27] the Privileges that we are granted by
[1:30] this great Supreme sacrifice that Jesus
[1:34] gave for us at
[1:37] Calvary that it reconciled us back into
[1:41] fellowship and to favor with thee that
[1:44] we might have this consolation of
[1:47] knowing that it's written if ye abide in
[1:51] me and my words in you you can ask what
[1:54] you will and it shall be done unto
[1:58] you I we're grateful for this and pray
[2:01] that you'll give us Faith to believe it
[2:04] with all that's in
[2:06] us now let us lay aside Lord every toil
[2:10] of the
[2:11] day every cure of this
[2:15] life all the way from the janitor to the
[2:19] pastor that there would be nothing in
[2:21] our minds now but be waiting listening
[2:25] reverently for the Holy Spirit to speak
[2:27] to
[2:28] us that we might accomplish something
[2:33] good to know more of thee by our
[2:36] gathering together for Lord truly that's
[2:39] why we come on this hot
[2:42] day speak to us through thy Living
[2:46] Word and let the Living Word dwell in us
[2:52] and abide in us that we might be shaped
[2:56] and
[2:57] formed not to the world but be
[3:01] transformed by the renewing of our
[3:04] spirit into the form of the Son of
[3:08] God oh our hearts
[3:12] tremble when we think in the joy floods
[3:16] our souls to know that we can be called
[3:19] Sons and Daughters of
[3:22] God we stand on the very brim of his
[3:27] second
[3:28] coming and All Nations and kingdoms
[3:32] quivering under our
[3:35] feet all things of the world is
[3:40] Vanishing but knowing that someday he
[3:42] shall come and shall take us to a
[3:45] kingdom where there shall never be an
[3:48] end or it'll never be
[3:50] moved and to think that we are now that
[3:54] the subjects of that
[3:57] Kingdom oh God circumcise our heart and
[4:01] ears today but by the Holy Spirit
[4:04] through the washing of the water of the
[4:06] word far we ask that in his name and for
[4:09] his glory
[4:18] amen I wish to approach the subject this
[4:23] morning
[4:25] for I was going to speak on something a
[4:29] little different if there was to be a
[4:31] healing service but we announced that
[4:35] the prayer cards to be give out at 8
[4:38] till 8:30 or 9:00 and I just Billy come
[4:43] up the house a few minutes ago and he
[4:44] said there was hardly anyone here so he
[4:48] didn't give out prayer cards so we'll I
[4:52] thought of taking this text for a
[4:54] correction of the
[4:57] church now I want to speak on the
[5:00] subject of a deceived Church by the
[5:05] world I wish to read some now out of the
[5:08] Book of Judges the 16th
[5:10] chapter beginning with the 10th
[5:15] verse and delas said unto
[5:19] Samson behold thou has mocked me and
[5:23] told me
[5:25] lies now tell me I pray thee wherein
[5:29] thou mightest be
[5:32] bound and he said unto her if thou bind
[5:35] me fast with new ropes that never were
[5:39] occupied then shall I be weak and be as
[5:43] another man Deli therefore took new
[5:46] ropes and bound him therewith and said
[5:49] unto him the Philistines be upon thee
[5:56] Samson and there was liars and weight
[6:00] abiding in the chamber and he
[6:03] break them from off his arms like as
[6:08] threads and delas said unto Samson
[6:12] hither to thou has mocked me and told me
[6:15] lies tell me where thou mightest be
[6:18] bound and he said unto her if thou weest
[6:22] Seven Locks of my head with a web and
[6:26] she fastened it to the pins and said to
[6:29] him the Philistines beyond the
[6:32] Samson and he awakened out of his sleep
[6:35] and went away with the pins of the beams
[6:38] and with the
[6:40] web and she said unto him how can thou
[6:43] say I love thee when in thine heart is
[6:48] not with me thou has mocked me these
[6:51] three times and has told me where in thy
[6:55] great strength lies and has not told me
[6:57] where in thy great strength lies
[7:01] and it came to pass when she had pressed
[7:04] him daily with her words and urged him
[7:10] so that his soul was vexed unto
[7:15] death and he told her all his heart and
[7:18] said unto her there has not come a razor
[7:21] up on my head for I have been a Nazarite
[7:24] unto God from my mother's
[7:28] womb
[7:30] if I be shaven then my strength will go
[7:33] from me and I shall become weak and be
[7:36] like another
[7:38] man and when Delah saw that he had told
[7:43] her all his heart she sent and called
[7:47] the Lords of the
[7:49] Philistines saying come up this once for
[7:53] he has sh me all his heart and the Lords
[7:58] of the Philistines came up unto her and
[8:01] sought money in brought money into her
[8:05] hand and she made him sleep upon her
[8:08] knees and she called for a man and he
[8:11] caused him to shave off the Seven Locks
[8:13] of his
[8:14] head and began to afflict him and his
[8:18] strength went from
[8:20] him and she said the Philistines be upon
[8:24] the Samson and he awoke out of his sleep
[8:27] and said I will go out as at other times
[8:30] before and shake myself and he wits not
[8:33] that the Lord had departed from
[8:37] him now I wish to read for a text for
[8:40] this subject found over in the Book of
[8:44] Revelations the 2
[8:47] chapter beginning with the 21st and the
[8:50] 23rd
[8:53] verses and I gave her
[8:56] space to repent of her fornications and
[9:00] she repented
[9:01] not behold I will cast her in to a bed
[9:07] and them that committed adultery with
[9:09] her un great tribulations except they
[9:12] repent of their
[9:14] deeds and I will kill her children with
[9:17] death and all the churches shall know
[9:20] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[9:24] and hearts and I will give unto every
[9:27] one of you according to your
[9:31] Works May the Lord add His blessings to
[9:35] the reading of his
[9:40] word Samson great deal liked the
[9:45] church started off
[9:48] right he started off in the right
[9:53] direction he started off and was called
[9:56] a mighty man of V
[10:01] he started out serving the lord and
[10:04] keeping his words and doing his
[10:09] Commandments and that was somewhat like
[10:12] the
[10:13] church it started off on as we would say
[10:17] as a world expression started on the
[10:20] right
[10:22] foot started to keep the Commandments of
[10:26] the Lord and as long as Sams son follow
[10:30] the lord the Lord you
[10:35] Samson for God can keep anyone and use
[10:40] anyone that will follow after
[10:45] him for it's God's
[10:49] business but when we turn to a side away
[10:53] from the things of God then God cannot
[10:56] use us any
[10:58] longer
[10:59] when we'll walk steadfastly after the
[11:03] Commandments of
[11:04] God when we'll stay in the pages of the
[11:08] Bible and worship by the written
[11:12] word worship him in the spirit and in
[11:15] the truth of the word then God can use
[11:19] any
[11:20] individual but when they take a notion
[11:23] to turn aside after something else then
[11:26] God cannot use that person any longer
[11:32] so Samson makes a and a very out
[11:37] standing representation of the Church of
[11:41] today when the church started God could
[11:44] use the church for the church walked
[11:48] diligently after the Commandments of the
[11:52] Lord kept all of his judgments and his
[11:56] statutes and done all of his commands
[11:59] and God was with the
[12:03] church but it seems to be
[12:06] that there is such a weakening place
[12:10] amongst the
[12:12] church remember we are not on a
[12:17] picnic but we're in a
[12:23] battlefield many people just think that
[12:26] when they become a Christian that that's
[12:29] all they need to
[12:32] do that that settles it
[12:36] forever if they are a Christian then
[12:38] everything's going to come
[12:40] easy don't never get that in your
[12:44] head where I become a Christian to
[12:49] fight fight the good fight of
[12:54] faith I become a Christian to get in the
[12:58] battle
[13:00] lines we are Christian
[13:06] Soldiers and we've got to be
[13:10] trained and brought
[13:12] up and know all the technques of the
[13:17] enemy to know how to fortify to know how
[13:20] to to fight the
[13:23] fight and we can only do that as the
[13:27] Holy Spirit Will re reveal it to
[13:31] us we cannot take what some other Nation
[13:34] tells us when we go to war some of their
[13:38] ideas but we got to
[13:40] take our own ideas the way the Holy
[13:44] Spirit would direct us and what ideas he
[13:47] would give us because he is the
[13:50] Commander in Chief of the army of the
[13:53] Christians
[13:57] God Samson did good he was a great
[14:03] man until he began to begin to kind of
[14:08] we would call it scallywag
[14:12] around until he began to get off of his
[14:16] own
[14:19] territory and the church didn't run
[14:23] well and was all right until they begin
[14:26] to get off of their territory
[14:33] story Samson begin to
[14:38] flirt and he was not flirting with
[14:41] Israel that his girls he begin to F with
[14:46] a philistin
[14:48] girls and that's somewhat similar to
[14:52] what the church
[14:57] did it never began to make love with its
[15:02] own it got off after
[15:05] unbelievers and begin to flirt with
[15:14] unbelievers that's where we made our
[15:17] great and one of the greatest
[15:22] mistakes as when the church begin to do
[15:26] things that wasn't right it begin to
[15:28] keep like Samson Bad
[15:34] Company Samson as long as he was in the
[15:38] company of the Lord's people he did all
[15:43] right but when he got to flirting with
[15:47] Bad
[15:48] Company then he got in
[15:52] trouble and that's the way it is with
[15:54] the
[15:55] church when the church followed
[15:58] reverently and daily after the leading
[16:01] of the Holy
[16:04] Spirit God blessed them and miracles and
[16:08] signs and wonders follow the
[16:12] church but when he begin to keep Bad
[16:15] Company with the
[16:19] world one of the worst things that done
[16:22] in the first things that done it begin
[16:24] to
[16:26] organize breaking up Fellowship ship
[16:29] amongst other
[16:31] believers because it found out that
[16:34] nations were
[16:37] organized but this great gospel is not
[16:41] dedicated to One Nation or one people
[16:45] it's dedicated to whosoever will let him
[16:49] come all nations kindreds tongues and
[16:54] people God never did intend for us to
[16:57] draw bound boundary
[17:01] lines but man wanted to be
[17:04] like the compare or to copy
[17:09] after go like the the world does say the
[17:13] things that they do make a
[17:16] success the way they were a
[17:19] success we cannot never be a success
[17:24] doing anything the world
[17:27] does
[17:29] we can only be a success as we follow
[17:33] after God's statutes and his way of
[17:35] doing
[17:38] things we can never be by pattering
[17:41] after the
[17:43] world if the cigarette company has met
[17:47] their greatest success by
[17:51] television and the beer and the whiskey
[17:54] crowds has made their great success to
[17:58] du the contribution of
[18:01] Television that's no sign that the
[18:03] church shall make its success by
[18:06] television amen the success of the
[18:09] church lies within the preaching of the
[18:11] Gospel of the power of God and the
[18:15] demonstration of the spirit praise God
[18:19] thank you Jesus we cannot say because
[18:21] that television done such and such for
[18:23] the cigarette company and the and the
[18:25] other companies we do not have have any
[18:29] Scripture to try to compare with them
[18:32] people and as long as we do we may draw
[18:36] great numbers of people but that's not
[18:38] what God ordained us to do
[18:42] amen we think because that we're all
[18:45] colors flying high great
[18:49] organizations causing great colorful
[18:52] things to take place that it's a success
[18:55] we are dying daily on our feet oh
[18:59] spiritually
[19:01] speaking if we stood 10 million strong
[19:05] this
[19:06] morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't with
[19:09] us we'd do well to stand 10 strong with
[19:12] the holy spirit with
[19:15] us we cannot compare with the world one
[19:20] of the first things was the church begin
[19:22] to organize
[19:24] themselves the first organization was
[19:27] the Catholic Church
[19:29] and then come to Lutheran
[19:32] Church when they organized in the
[19:34] Catholic church to make it an
[19:36] organization one day there was a
[19:39] cry the Philistines is on the
[19:44] Samson and
[19:46] Samson broke the cords of the bounds of
[19:50] the Catholic church and Martin Luther
[19:53] came forth amen with the
[19:57] organizations
[19:59] then they bound the church with another
[20:02] card as Delia
[20:05] did and they begin instead of having God
[20:08] call
[20:09] man man who were called by the Holy
[20:12] Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs amen
[20:17] but they know
[20:19] Christ amen then the church got
[20:22] stylished and fashioned after the
[20:25] political
[20:26] speakers and they had to give their
[20:29] preachers doctor's
[20:31] degree everybody had to be a doctor of
[20:35] divinity that was another card Divine
[20:38] the
[20:39] church man go off and study each
[20:42] Seminary tries to produce a better
[20:44] scholar so that their churches can brag
[20:47] our pastor is a doctor of
[20:51] divinity what did they do one try to
[20:55] have more knowledge than the other
[20:58] well that doesn't mean anything in the
[21:00] sight of God and there's no need for any
[21:04] man to try to take his worldly knowledge
[21:07] and ever please God with it it's an
[21:09] abomination in the sight of
[21:12] God Amen you'll never please God with
[21:16] the worldly Ambitions and knowledge
[21:19] because it's imity to God says the
[21:22] scriptures he cannot do
[21:26] it and each one try to have all the
[21:29] knowledge they know just what to do and
[21:31] the words to say and it becomes just a
[21:34] political speech instead of a powerly
[21:37] demonstrated Holy Spirit message that
[21:40] sinks to the heart of man and discovers
[21:43] the sins praise God they're trained for
[21:48] political
[21:50] talks and we don't need
[21:54] that Paul said the word come to us not
[21:57] only are the the gospel and word only
[21:59] but through the power and the
[22:01] manifestation of the Holy Ghost amen
[22:04] that brought the
[22:06] gospel demonstrating the powers of the
[22:10] Holy
[22:12] Ghost but all these men go off the
[22:16] seminaries and they learn great
[22:19] educations how they must stand before
[22:21] the people how they must present
[22:24] themselves how they must dress and how
[22:26] they must act should never use the wrong
[22:29] grammar now that's all right for a
[22:33] political
[22:36] speech but we are not after the
[22:38] enchanting words of man Paul said the
[22:42] gospel that I preached didn't come like
[22:44] that when it come to the renewing of the
[22:48] the Holy Ghost and the power of
[22:50] demonstrations
[22:52] [Applause]
[22:53] amen do come Hallelujah by right form
[22:58] speech praise God that your wisdom would
[23:01] be or your trust would be in the wisdom
[23:04] of
[23:05] man but it come through the
[23:08] demonstrations of the power of the Risen
[23:10] Christ Hallelujah that's the
[23:14] gospel Amen to know him in the power of
[23:18] his resurrection
[23:21] hallelujah praise God each one tries to
[23:24] think he's a little smarter than the
[23:26] other man each to denomination the
[23:28] methodists will say we got the smartest
[23:30] man the Baptist will say and the Church
[23:33] of Christ and so forth they all we we're
[23:36] the smartest we our our people we don't
[23:38] let just the ordinary man go out and
[23:39] preach the
[23:41] gospel but they handpick
[23:44] them oh God have
[23:47] mercy handpick them if they're indument
[23:51] with their certain Doctrine then they
[23:53] put him in the church God can't touch
[23:55] him in no way amen
[24:00] I want somebody to preach to me that's
[24:02] been handpicked by the Holy Ghost God
[24:06] has raised
[24:07] up Hallelujah not picked by man or
[24:15] denominations all knowledge they say oh
[24:17] we know all about
[24:18] it and some of them doesn't know the
[24:21] first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they
[24:24] deny
[24:26] it Jesus
[24:29] it reminds me of a little book I read
[24:31] one day in California about 10 years
[24:34] ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I
[24:37] forget who was the author just a little
[24:40] 10 cent
[24:42] book but it had some good sense to it
[24:47] though it seemed jokingly and
[24:50] cunningly but I found something in there
[24:54] that sounded like God to me
[24:59] and one of the little stories started
[25:00] out like
[25:02] this one morning in a great chicken
[25:07] pin there was a certain Little
[25:12] Rooster that thought he had had all the
[25:16] knowledge that there was to be
[25:18] known so he THS up on a box and beat his
[25:22] little bill against the Box four or five
[25:25] times threw back his little head and C
[25:27] like you never heard of rooster
[25:30] crow and the others he attracted their
[25:33] attention and he said ladies and
[25:37] gentlemen of this chicken
[25:40] pin I would like to speak to you all
[25:43] this morning on some great educational
[25:46] program we have just
[25:50] designed said I have required a lot of
[25:53] knowledge in my studying as he pulled
[25:55] his little glasses over his bill
[25:59] and he said I have decided that we
[26:02] chickens can better ourselves by a more
[26:07] knowledge therefore I can tell you that
[26:10] where if we will dig and work and a
[26:13] certain pin or hole we'll find a certain
[26:17] vitamin that'll make us Crow better
[26:20] prettier
[26:21] feathers and oh I can tell you how we
[26:24] can EMB better oursel in many different
[26:26] ways and the little pullets with their
[26:29] little red Combs they just cackled and
[26:31] said isn't he a
[26:35] darling and they certainly admired
[26:39] him oh he is such a brilliant
[26:43] rooster reminds me of some of these here
[26:46] Seminary
[26:48] preachers such a brilliant man there's
[26:52] no need of us hanging around the rest of
[26:53] chickens we all ought to go with
[26:56] him well before the little fell got his
[26:59] speech finished there was another little
[27:02] chicken that didn't have such bright
[27:06] feathers come running in from the rest
[27:08] of the chicken yard and said boys just a
[27:12] minute I just heard the latest bulletin
[27:15] on the radio chickens went up 4 cents on
[27:18] the pound we're all going to the
[27:20] slaughter
[27:22] tomorrow what good your knowledge going
[27:24] to
[27:26] do brother all the knowledge that we can
[27:29] accumulate what good does it do we're
[27:31] six foot of
[27:33] dirt
[27:35] amen we're all dying by inches and by
[27:41] minutes our knowledge means nothing we
[27:44] want to know
[27:49] him but they do that as I was remarking
[27:53] some time ago
[27:54] about a certain little canary
[27:59] and he thought he know all the knowledge
[28:01] that it need to be known and he knowed
[28:03] so much that he could tell all the rest
[28:06] of the canaries about the human
[28:08] beings so he flies up on his cage and he
[28:11] begins to speak about the human beings
[28:13] how he knowed all about them and all of
[28:16] a sudden a professor from Purdue walked
[28:19] up and begin to speak some high polish
[28:22] words to him and the little fell batted
[28:24] his eyes and turned his
[28:26] head now he had eyes he could see the
[28:29] professor he had ears he could hear
[28:32] him but of course he didn't know what he
[28:35] was talking about why he's got a canary
[28:39] brain he's just a bird
[28:42] brain that's all he's got he hasn't got
[28:44] a human brain so he can't think like
[28:47] human beings and neither can a human
[28:49] being think like
[28:51] God Amen you're human all the worldly
[28:56] knowledge of is no more than a canary
[28:59] brain amen all you do you just hurt
[29:03] yourself with
[29:05] it you got to have the mind of
[29:09] Christ
[29:10] Hallelujah the reason people go and jarn
[29:14] organizations and substitute a handshake
[29:18] instead of the new birth they're trying
[29:20] to bypass the new
[29:22] birth they don't want the new
[29:25] birth and the
[29:27] they know we teach it in the
[29:29] Bible so they want to substitute
[29:34] something for it and the Pentecostal
[29:38] people are just as
[29:42] bad trying to substitute something they
[29:46] want it in
[29:48] class it must be just so classy we'll
[29:52] shake hands and join the church and be
[29:54] sprinkled or baptized or something
[29:59] they're afraid of the new
[30:02] birth I sometimes believe the brandom
[30:05] Tabernacle is getting afraid of it
[30:10] amen now we all
[30:12] know that a birth I don't care where it
[30:15] is or what where abouts it's a
[30:18] mess if a baby's born on a sh pile on a
[30:22] hard floor or in a peak decorated
[30:25] hospital room it's a mess and
[30:27] anyhow amen a birth of a calf birth of
[30:31] anything else is a
[30:33] mess and the new birth is nothing less
[30:36] than a mess amen but people so starchy
[30:41] we'll go over where they shake hands
[30:43] we'll go over where they don't ball and
[30:44] cry and beat on the Altar and cry out
[30:48] you want to be too
[30:50] human what we need is birth dying out
[30:54] that brings forth
[30:56] life praise
[30:58] God a seed an old potato a seed potato
[31:02] you take that potato and put it in the
[31:04] ground until you can have new
[31:08] potatoes that old potato has to
[31:12] Rock Amen a corn cannot produce new life
[31:15] until it's
[31:17] rotten amen and a man or a woman can
[31:20] never have new birth until their
[31:22] intellectuals and their own self is
[31:24] rotten dead amen
[31:27] die out at the altar and
[31:30] scream get all messed up till a place of
[31:33] starch gets out of your collar and
[31:35] you're born again by the spirit of
[31:38] godallah I don't care if you Squall
[31:40] speak in tongue jump up and down flop
[31:42] like a chicken with his head off you're
[31:44] bringing forth new life
[31:47] amen but we substituted something for it
[31:51] amen we want the classical way praise
[31:56] God
[31:59] sure the other day Friday wife and I was
[32:03] going to the
[32:05] store I don't mean to harp on
[32:09] this but as we went down the street I
[32:12] just kept turn my head one way for the
[32:14] other naked
[32:16] women I promised God when I was a blind
[32:19] man if he'd heal my eyes i' look at the
[32:22] thing was
[32:25] right I keep people little cross hanging
[32:28] in my car when I see such as that I look
[32:31] at the cross and say oh God that's my
[32:36] refuge as I looked at the
[32:39] cross I seen those women praise God me
[32:43] said we haven't seen one woman today
[32:45] that's got on a
[32:49] skirt and she said bill look at that
[32:52] woman
[32:53] there with those little straps around
[32:56] her top of her body and said you mean to
[33:00] tell me that woman don't know that's
[33:04] wrong said if she doesn't know it's
[33:06] wrong then she's out of her right
[33:09] mind I said just a minute honey she is
[33:12] an
[33:14] American she does as the Americans
[33:18] do I said I was in Finland not long go
[33:22] sweetheart and I question there to a man
[33:25] that Set Me Down
[33:28] Dr Mion and and we were going to
[33:32] the the health
[33:34] baths What's called the
[33:37] Sund and they take you in and pour hot
[33:40] water on water on hot rocks and it just
[33:43] sweats you then they make you jump in
[33:45] ice water and then back out then you
[33:47] take you into a room and there's nurses
[33:49] and there women who scrub the man and
[33:51] them
[33:52] naked send them back into the pool I
[33:56] wouldn't go in
[33:57] I said Dr Mone then that's
[34:00] wrong he said all right then reever
[34:02] Brandon that's wrong then how about your
[34:04] American doctors that'll strip a woman
[34:06] naked and lay her on the table and
[34:07] examine every sex organ she's
[34:16] got how about your nurses in the
[34:20] hospitals I said excuse me brother n
[34:22] Mion you're
[34:24] right what is it it's
[34:29] Customs when I was in Paris I could
[34:32] hardly believe
[34:34] it that the urals for both men and women
[34:37] were the same
[34:41] one I couldn't understanded that the
[34:43] restrooms was on the side of the
[34:46] street for both male and
[34:50] female I couldn't believe that when
[34:52] women went to the beach to go swimming a
[34:54] boy and his sweetheart they had no
[34:57] dressing rooms they just took all their
[34:59] clothes to the last garment then turned
[35:01] their backs and put on a little strap
[35:02] when swimming but it's
[35:04] so they pay no attention to
[35:07] it it's a custom of
[35:11] France in
[35:13] Africa women and men young and old no
[35:17] clothes at
[35:18] all walking through the Prairies never
[35:22] know what a restroom was or things that
[35:23] never went out of each other's
[35:25] sight but they don't know the
[35:29] difference they don't know the
[35:31] difference but it's customs of
[35:35] Nations but I said honey we are
[35:38] different we are from another
[35:41] Nation we are pilgrims and strangers
[35:44] here that's what makes these things look
[35:46] so wrong
[35:48] amen for the Bible said they that
[35:51] profess such claim they show that they
[35:53] are pilgrims and strangers they are
[35:56] seeking a city to come amen a man or a
[36:00] woman in Italy in France in Africa in
[36:06] any other Nation that's ever born again
[36:10] of the Holy Ghost don't do those things
[36:14] amen they won't wear those clothes they
[36:17] won't act like that because they're of
[36:20] another
[36:21] nation whose ruler and maker is
[36:25] God
[36:27] we're from
[36:29] Heaven the spirit that's within you
[36:32] motivates your life if you are American
[36:35] you'll do as Americans
[36:37] do if you are a French you'll do as the
[36:39] French
[36:40] do and criticize the other but if you
[36:44] are a god you'll do the way they do in
[36:47] heaven because your spirit comes from
[36:51] above and it controls
[36:54] you a little something you might look
[36:58] at in the scripture those who sought
[37:01] this new
[37:02] city acted different they professed that
[37:06] they were pilgrims and
[37:08] strangers but on the side of King they
[37:11] become
[37:12] fugitives and
[37:15] renegades but Christians were pilgrims
[37:18] and
[37:20] strangers a fugitive has no
[37:23] home a renegade is a horrible person
[37:28] person but a
[37:31] pilgrim is something real and from a
[37:34] real land in another Nation trying to
[37:37] find his way
[37:38] home professing by his living that he
[37:42] has something that he's from another
[37:45] country there is the reason but yet
[37:49] those people who do so those people who
[37:52] wear those things let me tell you in
[37:55] South Africa when I saw
[37:58] 30,000 raw heathens naked blanket
[38:04] natives 16 18 20 year old girls boys
[38:08] with not one stitch of
[38:11] clothes standing there with mud in their
[38:14] faces and painted Up Bones through their
[38:17] nose and blocks of wood hanging from
[38:20] their ears and cross human bones or some
[38:23] bones in their hair animals teeth
[38:27] hanging over
[38:29] them naked as they come into the world
[38:33] and didn't know
[38:35] it but when they received Christ and
[38:38] fell on their face and received the Holy
[38:41] Ghost they got up and folded their arms
[38:43] to hold shame to their bosom as they
[38:47] walked away and found clothes to put on
[38:50] Amen why they become pilgrims and
[38:53] strangers to this world Amen Hallelujah
[38:56] praise the
[38:59] Lord hallelujah they were away from him
[39:02] yes
[39:04] sir oh yes these people call themselves
[39:08] Christians they belong to churches they
[39:10] go and say we are methodists We Are
[39:12] Baptist we're Pentecostal we're sday
[39:15] Adventist we're this that the other that
[39:17] doesn't have one thing to do with it
[39:20] your spirit the life that's in you
[39:22] motivates and tells what you are Jesus
[39:25] said by their fruit you shall know
[39:30] them the church has become like Israel
[39:34] first they seen all the Heathen Nations
[39:36] having a king God was their
[39:39] King and they seen the Heathen Nations
[39:41] having King so they wanted to act like
[39:44] the Heathen Nations and they bought
[39:46] themsel a
[39:48] king and as they did
[39:54] it they got in trouble
[39:57] gradually begin to come in gradually the
[40:00] world begin to slip into them finally
[40:02] ended up in
[40:04] aab one king coming just a little closer
[40:06] to it a little closer to it and finally
[40:08] squeeze the life out of them there they
[40:11] went and when they real king come they
[40:13] didn't know him that's the same thing
[40:15] the church has done it's adopted here
[40:19] are it's adopted politics
[40:24] educations it's adopted
[40:26] organizations Society big churches amen
[40:30] High confuting preachers and when the
[40:33] real King comes they don't know him and
[40:36] they're crucifying the very Holy Ghost
[40:38] that's their
[40:40] King they don't know him Hallelujah but
[40:44] they laugh at him and make fun of him as
[40:46] the Jews did their Messiah the church is
[40:49] doing their Messiah the same
[40:52] way they don't know
[40:55] it they haven't got the spiritual
[40:58] Insight because they're so indument with
[41:01] their eyes and what they see great
[41:03] buildings trying to compare with the
[41:05] world we are never exalt exalted to to
[41:09] compare with the world we're exalted to
[41:12] Humble
[41:14] ourselves and one is a majority in God
[41:17] and today in the healing evangelist out
[41:19] on the fields there're such a competi
[41:23] competitors one says well bless God I
[41:25] have so many thousands I got a bigger
[41:26] meeting than you have what difference
[41:29] does that
[41:30] make if we have one or one million what
[41:33] difference does it make are we true to
[41:35] God are we true to his word do we stand
[41:39] under test of the holy
[41:43] spirit is it true that's the main thing
[41:47] but we compromise upon the
[41:49] Bible lot of our Pentecostal people up
[41:52] on the fundamental doctrines of this
[41:53] Bible
[41:55] compromise yeah
[41:59] I don't want to hurt feelings I'm in my
[42:02] own church and I feel that I I could do
[42:04] just what in the church because I'm
[42:06] preaching the gospel but there's tens of
[42:09] thousands of Pentecostal preachers know
[42:12] that there's no such a thing in the
[42:13] Bible as a baptism in the name of father
[42:15] son Holy
[42:17] Ghost I challenge the Archbishop for
[42:20] anybody to show me where anybody was
[42:22] ever baptized in the name of father son
[42:23] Holy Ghost amen but they compromise
[42:27] because these organizations has did so
[42:31] there's not one person in the New
[42:33] Testament and for 300 years afterwards a
[42:35] history of what was baptized in the name
[42:37] of Jesus
[42:38] Christ what is it
[42:41] organization that's did it
[42:44] compromising and today theyve took all
[42:47] the street workers off the
[42:49] streets they've took the tambourine out
[42:51] of the
[42:52] church they've taken all the glory out
[42:55] of the church
[42:56] and God seminaries preaching little old
[42:59] rooster comb
[43:02] preaching all Polished in society and
[43:05] they're women wearing shorts and dresses
[43:07] that they're skinned into and men
[43:10] smoking cigarettes and gambling and
[43:12] telling dirty
[43:15] jokes it's a disgrace in the sight of
[43:20] God I know that's rough but it's time
[43:24] somebody said something
[43:28] Jesus
[43:31] compromising giving in acting like the
[43:33] world I don't care if I have to stand
[43:36] alone with nobody but God alone I'll
[43:38] preach the truth of God's Bible and
[43:41] standard if I die I'll still stand for
[43:44] the
[43:44] truth praise the
[43:47] lord we want truth I measure up not
[43:51] according to the church but according to
[43:52] the word of God I want to measure up
[43:57] but Delia did you notice she know that
[44:00] Samson had a
[44:02] power and she didn't know where that
[44:05] power
[44:06] laid she couldn't tell what that power
[44:09] was but there was some great power that
[44:12] Samson possessed and she wanted to find
[44:15] it and as Delia she kept wooing Samson
[44:20] after her
[44:21] beauty oh she dressed herself real sexy
[44:24] and she walked before him she teed like
[44:27] some of the little teenagers of the day
[44:28] and and so forth and just act like
[44:31] something other strip teas trying to woo
[44:34] Samson to
[44:36] her that's the same thing the world's
[44:38] done to the
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:42] church now where is your great power
[44:45] well if we'll organize that'll break the
[44:47] power the Catholic Church done it but
[44:50] the Philistines is on the Samson and a
[44:52] Luther come
[44:53] out and he organized again
[44:56] if you buy me with another card it'll
[44:58] hold me so they did and the fistings on
[45:01] the Samson what
[45:03] happened Wesley came out and broke the
[45:06] cards amen now you've deceived me all

[45:12] all right tell me the truth in your
[45:13] heart all right you buy me with another
[45:16] card all right now we'll do that what is
[45:19] that that's the denominational card you

[45:22] denomination then I tell you you have me
[45:24] broke so out come the
[45:28] Pentecostals amen where's your power
[45:31] fistin be upon me and he broke the cards

[45:39] Pentecostals to Big doctors of divinity
[45:41] for their
[45:42] pastors some great man they've got just

[51:29] shaved all your power
[51:31] off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but
[51:35] the world certainly shaved your power
[51:38] now it's just as starch as the rest of
[51:40] them what are we going to do what's
[51:43] going to happen there's one glorious
[51:46] thing that I can think of to end this
[51:48] text while Samson was bound we can't
[51:52] have a
[51:53] Revival listen to our loyal brother
[51:55] Billy
[51:56] Graham reviv in our day listen or Robert
[52:00] scream reviv in our
[52:02] day listen at the rest of them Reviving
[52:05] our day how can we have a Revival when
[52:08] we're
[52:09] bound amen we bound the holy spirit with
[52:13] our organizations and traditions and we
[52:16] can't have a holy ghost
[52:18] Revival here man I know that's scorching
[52:22] hot with the weather
[52:24] here but it's the
[52:26] truth how can we have a holy ghost
[52:28] Revival when you're so bound and
[52:31] starchy Farm of godliness the Bible said
[52:34] it have F of godliness but would deny
[52:37] the power thereof the power of
[52:40] what the power of the organization the
[52:44] power of the world the power of the
[52:45] church the power of the Holy Ghost
[52:48] that's the secred place in the church
[52:50] and when the church adopts educated
[52:53] preachers in big buildings and finery
[52:56] and instead of the oldfashioned Holy
[52:58] Ghost it better be in a mission
[53:01] again
[53:06] amen how you going to have a Revival of
[53:08] the Holy Ghost and people quench it and
[53:10] bound it in afraid of
[53:15] it there's where the trouble Li the
[53:18] Philistines is on the but the one
[53:21] blessed hope we have while Samson was in
[53:24] jail
[53:26] what's the first thing they've done when
[53:27] they caught him they bound him first
[53:29] they took his power away they found his
[53:31] secret they found your
[53:33] secret the world found your secret now
[53:37] you women all Bob your hair go it's like
[53:39] the
[53:39] world you men all go and act like the
[53:41] world it's all right tell jokes and
[53:43] dirty jokes and go out and smoke a few
[53:45] cigarettes and run out with the
[53:47] neighbors wives and everything else like
[53:49] that a little sociable drink to hold
[53:52] your job I'd rather lay on my belly and
[53:55] eat sod crackers and drink Branch water
[53:57] and stay clean and pure before God then
[53:59] the
[54:01] compromise for any kind of a
[54:04] job right thank you true stay true to
[54:08] God Samson the Philistines is on thee
[54:13] brandom Tabernacle whism is creeping in
[54:15] among you what about it have you exposed
[54:20] your secret have you exposed that secret
[54:23] that God give you when you were watering
[54:24] there in the sought us a few years
[54:27] ago have you let it creep out the social
[54:30] formal
[54:31] worship my God what's happened to you
[54:35] God can come down and perform a miracle
[54:37] and go right down to the audience and
[54:38] tell people the secrets of their hearts
[54:40] and everything and heal the sick and
[54:41] Afflicted and do signs and wonders and
[54:43] preach his word as hard as it can by the
[54:45] Holy Ghost and people say well I guess
[54:47] that's all
[54:48] right we enjoy listening to it once in a
[54:50] while we're not too
[54:52] tired that's brandom Tabernacle
[54:55] amen the Philistines is on the what used
[54:59] to be when the preaching of the word and
[55:01] the old Saints with the tears in their
[55:03] eyes would rise to their feet and walk
[55:05] sobbing maybe not saying a word just
[55:07] walking around two or three times and
[55:09] sit down so filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:12] the word
[55:13] fedom amen man shall not live by bread
[55:16] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[55:19] out of the mouth of
[55:21] God Philistines is on the brandom
[55:24] Tabernacle Philistines is on you
[55:26] Pentecostal of course the Philistines
[55:28] got you rest of you long time ago when
[55:30] you organize yourself so tight nothing
[55:33] can come unless you was a presbyterian
[55:35] Baptist Methodist Catholic or something
[55:37] you wouldn't have nothing to do with the
[55:38] rest of them so Revival in our day how
[55:40] can we have it when the regular Revival
[55:43] Giver is Bound By The
[55:45] World God won't come in where the world
[55:47] is you can just depend on that you
[55:50] associate with the world then it's it's
[55:52] all of it when you let the world creep
[55:54] in you go to act in act the world then
[55:56] you are
[55:57] finished but when you'll cut loose every
[55:59] fet from the world and come to God God
[56:01] will use you until you go to flirting
[56:05] again here's the only hope that I have
[56:07] this morning to wind up my message is
[56:10] this while Samson was bound a new shock
[56:14] of hair grow
[56:17] down God send us another
[56:21] church just before the end
[56:23] time that the power of the Holy Ghost
[56:28] can come into her in the demonstrations
[56:31] of the spirit in Mark 16 can follow the
[56:34] church
[56:35] amen Acts 2 and 4 acts 238 all of it
[56:39] will be following right along with the
[56:40] church signs and wonders accompany the
[56:43] apostles great signs of his resurrection
[56:47] accompany him while we're in prison
[56:50] surely God's growing a crop somewhere
[56:52] for the last great kill amen may it be
[56:55] you my Christian friend here this
[56:56] morning may it be your strength has
[56:59] begin to grow I pray that this message
[57:01] this morning and out into the land of
[57:03] where this will go I trust that this
[57:06] message will help bring the vitamin to
[57:09] your system that'll grow a spiritual
[57:12] power back into your life again Amen Let
[57:15] Us bow our heads and
[57:18] pray oh Lord
[57:21] God creator of the heavens and the Earth
[57:25] the author of everlasting life and The
[57:27] Giver of every good and spiritual
[57:30] gift take these words this morning and
[57:34] place them into the heart and water them
[57:38] Lord May the people pray over these
[57:40] things seeing that the world has woed
[57:43] the church and has finally found its
[57:47] power found its secret
[57:49] place found were it its secret
[57:53] lies and a shaved it off has taken the
[57:57] peoples that once shouted the victory
[58:00] once had the Victory and has shaved them
[58:03] off to stay home on Wednesday night to
[58:05] watch a television
[58:07] program taking the joy out of their
[58:10] hearts and given more love for the world
[58:13] than they have for God has given more
[58:15] world for worldly more desire for
[58:19] worldly entertainment than to have the
[58:20] preaching of the Gospel if there's not a
[58:23] great band in a L of carrying on and
[58:26] hooping and carrying on then they don't
[58:28] want the old gospel anymore that brings
[58:30] tears of joy to the soul that brings
[58:33] Divine Healing back that restores the
[58:36] apostolic gifts to the church that
[58:39] brings in the Risen Christ the Messiah
[58:42] of this day but as Israel was bound by
[58:46] by their kings that they could not
[58:48] follow the real king and their real King
[58:50] when he came they didn't recognize him
[58:53] so is it today oh Lord
[58:55] the king of glory has appeared in the
[58:57] form of the Holy
[58:59] Ghost and Lord they don't know it they
[59:02] don't recognize it they're so organized
[59:04] so tight that they do not understand it
[59:06] because it's not in their organization
[59:08] Lord this is a work of the devil that's
[59:11] done this to the people may the Samson
[59:14] of God May the true in heart those who
[59:17] are longing and crying and pleading and
[59:20] holding
[59:22] on May they stay with the Lord
[59:25] until this new crop grows out until
[59:29] there comes forth again a joy in Zion
[59:32] and there comes forth a group that can
[59:34] recognize and understand that can see
[59:36] the Messiah and the hidden Powers that's
[59:39] hid from the world that they will not
[59:41] understand now Grant Lord that they'll

[1:12:38] 23-32 for I have received of the Lord
[1:12:42] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:12:46] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:12:49] which he was betrayed took
[1:12:51] bread and when he had given given thanks
[1:12:54] he broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:12:59] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:13:03] remembrance of
[1:13:05] me after the same manner also he took
[1:13:07] the cup when he had SED

[1:13:13] my blood this do ye as often as he
[1:13:16] drinketh in remembrance of me for as
[1:13:20] often as he eat this bread and drink
[1:13:22] this cup ye do show the Lord's death
[1:13:25] till he
[1:13:26] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:13:30] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:13:32] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:13:34] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:13:37] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:13:40] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:13:44] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:13:46] eateth and drinketh the damnation to
