[11:36] 1 John 1,
[11:41] the elder
[11:43] unto the elect lady and her children
[11:48] whom I love in the truth. And not only
[11:50] I, but also they that have known the
[11:53] truth.
[11:55] For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in
[11:58] us, and shall be with us forever.

[12:15] And now I beseech thee, Lady, not as so

[12:22] it which we had from the beginning, that
[12:25] we love one another.
[12:30] And this love that we walk after the

[12:38] that we walk after his commandments.
[12:41] Father, make us more like thee.
[12:45] Elect lady,
[12:48] elected lady.
[12:50] I call you elected lady
[12:53] that walk in his commandment
[12:56] to be more like this, more like him, not
[13:00] more like your neighbor, not more like
[13:02] your boss, not more like your pastor,
[13:06] not more like this or this one, not more
[13:09] like the heroes. But Lord, there's only
[13:12] one.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; I want to be more like
[13:15] &gt;&gt; as the elected lady
[13:18] &gt;&gt; chosen before the foundation of the
[13:20] world.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I want to be more like you.
[13:23] Speak to me tonight.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; You know my needs.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; You know what we need.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; May you speak to us.
[13:32] May you bring your bride together.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; The elected lady.
[13:38] No one
[13:40] &gt;&gt; can take this election away.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; May be seated for just a moment.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Our sister was singing, "Lead me Lord."
[13:59] This is your desire. Lead me Lord.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; I will follow.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; I will go every door you open. I will
[14:08] go.
[14:10] I just want to greet you everyone who
[14:13] came to this meetings. May God richly
[14:15] bless you and be with you. May this
[14:19] meeting be something that something that
[14:21] is inside of you will get bigger. We get
[14:26] more fiery for the Holy Ghost. We get
[14:28] much deeper in the love of God. We got
[14:31] greater and at what he will perform.
[14:35] something that we can go out of this
[14:36] weekend and said, "Not only our hearts
[14:39] burned, but my life is changed. It
[14:42] brought me closer to him. I'm more like
[14:45] him. I LOVE HIM MORE. LORD, WHATEVER you
[14:48] want, make me more. May it be multiplied
[14:54] and replenished in this weekend. THIS IS
[14:57] THE WEEKEND TO multiply and replenish
[14:59] what is inside of you."
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Before we invite our
[15:05] precious brother oit,
[15:09] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says
[15:11] &gt;&gt; now here listen a human has to worship.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; A human is not to be quiet.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAYS A HUMAN HAS TO WORSHIP.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; He says you have to worship something.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; YOU IT'S JUST IN YOU TO WORSHIP.
[15:31] So a human has to worship something.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; So they and brother Brandham said in in
[15:38] the art wall 64. So in the churches they
[15:41] had no worship in their church. So God
[15:44] raised them up a nut. Elvis Presley a
[15:48] pat bone. They still hold on their
[15:51] testimony. Elvis and Pentecost and Pat
[15:54] bone and Christ of church. They
[15:56] absolutely not fulfill Jesus words here.
[15:58] But he said there's something in you to
[16:00] worship.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; So God raised up some nuts that they
[16:05] have something to worship. But here IS
[16:08] THE ELECT OF GOD,
[16:10] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WITH SOMETHING
[16:13] IN THEIR HEART TO WORSHIP HER SAVIOR,
[16:16] HER REDEEMER, HER BRIDEGROOM. WE HAVE
[16:19] ENOUGH TO WORSHIP HIM. WE HAVE ENOUGH
[16:22] BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF YOU TO WORSHIP
[16:25] HIM. [applause and cheering]
[16:27] HALLELUJAH.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Stephanos,
[16:33] how can we worship?
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in a prayer. Revelation
[16:38] chapter 5 part two. And as we come
[16:43] humbly,
[16:45] watch out
[16:46] &gt;&gt; and may God do it tonight.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Before the word comes for us, a short
[16:52] quick word. As we come humbly, we ask
[16:57] that you lay from our minds. He didn't
[17:00] say you lay from our minds. HE SAID THAT
[17:03] YOU, LORD JESUS, LAY FROM OUR MINDS AND
[17:07] OUR HEARTS ALL THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; LORD, may you lay them away
[17:15] all the toils OF LIFE.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TOILS OF LIFE. YOU HAVE TOILS
[17:21] OF LIFE. I HAVE TO OF LIFE. EVERY ONE OF
[17:24] US HAS TOILS OF LIFE. BUT LORD, MAY YOU
[17:27] LAY THEM AWAY, FATHER.
[17:29] [applause]
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And the worries,
[17:34] every worry, Lord, may you lay it aside.
[17:38] And that you after that he lays it
[17:40] aside. Oh God will put us IN THE STATE
[17:44] OF WORSHIP.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; LORD, may you take the toils. MAY YOU
[17:48] TAKE THE WORRIES. YOU SAID ALL THINGS
[17:50] WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD. I WILL BE WITH
[17:53] YOU. I WILL BE IN WORSHIP. ALL WORRIES
[17:56] AWAY. PRAISE THE LORD. LORD, FOR WHAT?
[17:58] AND THEN AFTER THAT, OH GOD, WILL YOU
[18:02] PUT US IN THE STATE OF WORSHIP THAT WE
[18:05] MIGHT WORSHIP thee through the hearing
[18:07] of thy word. SO BROTHER OID WHILE THE
[18:11] WORLD GOES FORTH IN OUR HEARTS, IN OUR
[18:14] MINDS, NO MORE WORRIES. This is TAKEN
[18:17] AWAY. JESUS PAID ON THE CROSS. THE PRICE
[18:20] IS PAID. He put us in a state of worship
[18:23] as we hear the word. May God richly
[18:26] bless you. May God bless you. [applause]
[18:29] Praise the Lord. The meeting is on. It's
[18:32] time to worship him, King Lamb. Praise
[18:36] [cheering] the Lord. [applause]
[18:38] Amen. Are you ready?

[18:56] &gt;&gt; NO ONE TOLD ME, STEPHANUS, YOU GOT TO
[18:58] MARRY HER. HERE YOU ARE. BUT I CAME TO
[19:02] HER AND SAID, I WANT TO MARRY YOU.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; She's my ELECTED LADY AND YOU ARE HIS
[19:08] ELECTED. HE CAME FOR YOU. HE CALLED YOU
[19:10] BY NAME. HE SAID, "I ELECTED YOU,
[19:13] PREDESTINATED YOU. YOU WILL ADORE ME IN
[19:16] A STATE YOU NEVER KNOW BEFORE."
[19:19] [applause and cheering]
[19:20] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; And as the elect lady,
[19:24] &gt;&gt; I have one testimony of elect lady.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; She walks in the way of her husband.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; We walk in the light.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; The elect lady is not working walking in
[19:36] darkness.
[19:37] And she's not working in darkness,
[19:40] &gt;&gt; but she's walking in the light.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; It transforms her
[19:47] &gt;&gt; like a seed like a plant gives

[22:14] Oh, [singing] comes when [music]

[22:29] all around us
[22:32] by day [singing and music] and
[22:35] by night.
[22:37] Oh Jesus,
[22:46] let's bow our heads [music] for a
[22:47] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[22:49] for your presence and thank you for this
[22:51] opportunity to be here and how we have
[22:54] been in this land for many many years uh
[22:58] knowing brother Ziggma [music] and
[22:59] seeing the fruit of his labor and the
[23:02] work here. I pray it touch his wife in a
[23:04] special way and bless the family and
[23:06] bless the Phillas and his wife and
[23:09] family in the church here in a special
[23:10] way tonight. As we come to your word,
[23:12] Lord, may you be with us and take me out
[23:14] of the way and be glorified in our midst
[23:17] in Jesus name I [music] ask it. Amen and
[23:18] amen. God bless you. Have a seat.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:23] [applause]
[23:25] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in Jesus name. I
[23:27] want to greet Sister Irene in a special
[23:28] way. God bless you. Uh certainly
[23:31] appreciate being here.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Uh
[23:36] yeah, forgive me a little bit for being
[23:38] a little emotional, but uh but Ziggman
[23:41] and I uh we went a long way and um I
[23:45] remember when he told me as a young man
[23:46] to take care of my family and um I
[23:50] receive him as a like an angel from the
[23:52] Lord. So I feel really blessed to be
[23:55] here tonight and I would see what the
[23:58] Lord will do and I am believing that God
[24:01] will work wonderfully among us tonight.
[24:04] Um uh I know him uh to be a genuine
[24:08] Christian, a genuine believer, a man who
[24:11] genuinely love the Lord. And you know
[24:15] God is not adopting the office.
[24:19] God is not adopting a position. God is
[24:23] adopting a man.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that. So the titles
[24:27] means nothing.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Whether it's pastor, apostle or teacher,
[24:32] evangelist, doctor, lawyer is who is
[24:34] behind that title.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; But life is behind that title is more
[24:39] important to God because when Saul
[24:42] failed, God told Samuel, I have found a
[24:47] better man.
[24:49] And God is always looking for better men
[24:52] &gt;&gt; is not what we do is who we are
[24:56] &gt;&gt; more than what we do.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; So who you are have to do with your
[24:59] character
[25:01] &gt;&gt; your person your inner being. And this
[25:04] is to me is what God looking for a man
[25:07] who heart is after God.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; So tonight if you want to stand we want
[25:12] to read three portion of scripture.
[25:15] One Ephesians 4 4-6.
[25:18] 1 Corinthians 12:13
[25:21] and Colossians 1
[25:23] 17-18
[25:26] reading Ephesians 4 reading from verse
[25:29] four there is one body and one spirit
[25:32] even as you are called in one hope of
[25:35] your calling
[25:38] one Lord
[25:40] one fate one baptism
[25:44] one God and father of all who is above
[25:47] all and through all and in you all.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:13.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized
[25:58] into one body.
[26:00] Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[26:03] we be bond or free and have been all
[26:05] made to drink into one spirit. And our
[26:09] last scripture from Colossians chapter
[26:11] 1,
[26:12] reading verse 17.
[26:14] And he is before all things, and by him
[26:18] all things consist.
[26:20] And he's the head of the body, the
[26:21] church, who is the firstborn, who is the
[26:25] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[26:28] that in all things he might have the
[26:30] preeminences. Let's pray one more time.
[26:32] Heavenly Father, I thank you for your
[26:34] word. And may you come now and bless it
[26:38] and interpret it to hearts of your
[26:39] people and confirm your word with signs.
[26:44] wonders and miracles I ask in Jesus
[26:47] name.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. God bless you. May have a
[26:50] seat.
[26:52] Praise God. I want to greet the
[26:53] ministers here tonight. God or bless my
[26:55] brother and all the others. We certainly
[26:57] appreciate you all being here and we are
[27:00] grateful to have fellowship one with
[27:02] another.
[27:03] So tonight I have a title,
[27:07] one body,
[27:09] one spirit.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; One head.
[27:13] That's the title tonight. One body,
[27:16] &gt;&gt; one spirit, one head of a subject, the
[27:21] body fitly joined together.
[27:25] And I have an inspiration
[27:27] recognizing Christ alone as the head of
[27:31] the bridebody.
[27:33] The Bible call it he is the head of the
[27:36] body called the church. So the church is
[27:40] not this building. The church is not
[27:42] displaced.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; The church is a body
[27:45] &gt;&gt; and by one spirit
[27:47] &gt;&gt; we are baptized into that what but one
[27:50] body.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; So the vision that brother Brandham
[27:53] brought this prophetic vision that the
[27:56] prophet brought he said I did not come
[27:58] to build another denomination.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; I came to build individuals
[28:04] &gt;&gt; into the stature of a perfect man.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; So he had a vision. It was a prophetic
[28:10] vision because this body was being
[28:12] formed through seven ages.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; This bright body and this body was a
[28:18] hidden mystery.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew but there was a hidden
[28:22] mystery but the prophet came to reveal
[28:24] it.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You may be seated.
[28:27] Brother Brandham,
[28:29] the importance of revelation by the
[28:31] spirit
[28:33] to a true believer can never be
[28:36] overemphasized.
[28:38] He is saying he's not talking about the
[28:40] book of revelation. He is talking about
[28:42] all revelation.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus asked his disciples who
[28:48] do men say I the son of man am they
[28:51] shared with him what men were saying but
[28:54] when he turned to his own disciples that
[28:56] had books and tastes for three and a
[28:57] half years that heard him for all these
[28:59] years they didn't know. And Peter broke
[29:03] through and said, "Do the Christ." And
[29:06] these were Jesus words. Flesh and blood
[29:08] had not revealed this unto you,
[29:11] &gt;&gt; but my father in heaven hath revealed it
[29:14] unto you,
[29:16] &gt;&gt; and upon this rock,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; I will build
[29:20] &gt;&gt; my church.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Now today, people go to groups,
[29:24] churches, fellowships, hear things,
[29:26] believe things. But the question is do
[29:28] you have a revelation
[29:30] &gt;&gt; of what you are hearing?
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Do you have a revelation of what you
[29:33] believe? Because only the Holy Ghost
[29:36] could give you revelation.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Only the Holy Ghost give revelation.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Now the devil himself fought worship.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; He fights worship.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like what what Brother
[29:49] Stephanus was saying to create the
[29:51] atmosphere of worship because in worship
[29:54] you are in the spirit
[29:57] &gt;&gt; and in the spirit the spirit could
[29:59] reveal things
[30:00] &gt;&gt; but if you're not in the spirit you will
[30:02] just be hearing intellectually.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; So you have to press your way
[30:06] &gt;&gt; and fight your way
[30:08] &gt;&gt; to get in the spirit to get in the
[30:10] atmosphere. And once you get in the
[30:12] atmosphere, Holy Ghost could reveal to
[30:14] you
[30:15] &gt;&gt; himself.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; And revelation
[30:18] &gt;&gt; is prevailing power.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[30:24] &gt;&gt; is prevailing power.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So brother Abraham
[30:28] said this way. You may be seated. Flesh
[30:30] and blood had not revealed it, but my
[30:34] father had revealed it. And upon this
[30:37] rock revelation, I will build my church.
[30:41] The church is built on the revelation on
[30:45] thus sayeth the Lord.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; So you realize now a lot of people don't
[30:49] have the revelation they claim to have
[30:52] &gt;&gt; because when testing time come, they
[30:54] fall apart.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Revelation make you stand.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Revelation makes you revelation make you
[31:01] stand flatfooted.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; If the Lord deliver me, that's fine. If
[31:05] he will not deliver me, I will not bow
[31:07] down.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; I will still serve him. I will still
[31:10] praise him. I'm not going to give up.
[31:12] I'm not going to backslide. I'm not
[31:14] going to let go
[31:15] &gt;&gt; because I have revelation.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; You be seated. Revelation make you stand
[31:23] anywhere,
[31:25] &gt;&gt; anytime.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. Revelation make
[31:28] you stand.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Revelation give you power.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation give you authority.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Because revelation is a
[31:36] substance.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; It's not imagination.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; It's not memory.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; It's a actual substance.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You may be seated. When
[31:48] Abraham got a revelation of Isaac,
[31:53] &gt;&gt; he had Isaac in his heart.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; His wife, God didn't speak to her. God
[31:59] didn't reveal himself to her. So Sarah
[32:02] didn't have a revelation. But Abraham
[32:05] had a revelation.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; But he can't show it.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; He can't get it out. He can't tell
[32:10] people, "Look at Isaac. Look at his
[32:12] face. Look at his picture." No, it's in
[32:14] him.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; It's a vision.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; It's an inspiration.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham knew that God said through
[32:22] Sarah, you're going to have that son.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Sarah had her own ideas, but Abraham
[32:27] knew it's true Sarah.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; So, he can't divorce Sarah. Yes,
[32:32] &gt;&gt; sir. He can't put away Sarah.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; He can't get vexed with Sarah. I don't
[32:36] want Sarah. Sarah's too old. No, he knew
[32:40] &gt;&gt; by Revelation.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; It's through Sarah.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; So, he had to be in harmony.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; With Sarah
[32:47] &gt;&gt; to keep this thing going
[32:49] &gt;&gt; for 25 years.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; And God has been checking us out
[32:55] &gt;&gt; to see how we have been going
[32:57] &gt;&gt; for all these years. And we LIKE ABRAHAM
[33:01] STAGGERED NOT AT THE promise of God
[33:04] &gt;&gt; through unbelief but we are holding on
[33:07] &gt;&gt; to our promise
[33:09] &gt;&gt; of dynamics
[33:11] &gt;&gt; to the mechanics.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; WE ARE HOLDING ON
[33:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD CAN'T LIE.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; WE ARE HOLDING ON BECAUSE God can't lie.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; So remember the Holy Ghost alone
[33:31] &gt;&gt; is the revealer of the divine revelation
[33:34] of Christ. You may be seated.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; So no man could claim uh I could reveal
[33:41] this to you.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; No, he could speak it to you.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; He could express it to you. But the Holy
[33:48] Ghost alone,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[33:51] &gt;&gt; is the revealer. Amen. I remember when I
[33:55] first read the message serpent seed that
[33:57] was scary and the devil used to bang my
[34:00] mind and I started to wonder what if I'm
[34:03] a serpent seed
[34:05] and I all kind of thoughts and one day I
[34:09] got a revelation of my sunship
[34:12] &gt;&gt; and when I got that
[34:14] &gt;&gt; the devil never brought that thought
[34:16] back to my mind
[34:20] &gt;&gt; because I know I'm a son
[34:22] &gt;&gt; and once a
[34:24] always a son.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Once a son, always a son.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said God is known by
[34:42] simplicity
[34:44] and of revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[34:47] most illiterate person.
[34:50] So that means revelation bypasses your
[34:54] intellect.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; So that's why you say illiterate person,
[34:57] a person who cannot read and cannot
[34:59] write could get revelation.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Because revelation bypass this here and
[35:04] drops down inside of here.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; So revelation make you speak from your
[35:10] heart.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; You're not a hypocrite.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; You're not a Pharisee. You speak from
[35:14] what's on the inside.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're walking
[35:20] in love from the inside,
[35:23] &gt;&gt; not mental. Isn't that right?
[35:25] &gt;&gt; So, but also said by lack of this
[35:28] revelation is why we have so much
[35:31] different divisions. So, divisions are
[35:34] not caused by revelation. Divisions are
[35:37] caused by lack of revelation. Because if
[35:40] we have revelation, we will see there is
[35:43] one Lord.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; There is one faith.
[35:47] There is one baptism. THERE IS ONE BODY.
[35:51] THERE IS ONE SPIRIT. AND WE ONLY HAVE
[35:54] ONE HEAD.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[35:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:02] Our head is not in Europe. Our head is
[36:05] not in America or South America or
[36:08] Africa or in the Caribbean. Our head is
[36:11] Christ.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; He is the head
[36:14] &gt;&gt; of the body called the church.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; He is the magnet
[36:20] &gt;&gt; THAT GOING TO MAGNETIZE US
[36:22] &gt;&gt; to take us out of here.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Do you get that now?
[36:27] &gt;&gt; He is our magnet
[36:29] &gt;&gt; that going to pull us up.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[36:34] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:40] [applause]
[36:40] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[36:43] Note,
[36:44] [snorts] so far in all what we have
[36:47] said, man is out the picture.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Man is out the picture. Revelation comes
[36:58] from heaven.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; The what? The Christ. Isn't that right?
[37:02] He is the head of the body
[37:04] &gt;&gt; called the church. Isn't that right?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; And there is only one body.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Not an African body, a European body and
[37:12] an American body. There's only one body.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; And to get into that body is one spirit.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Not two spirits. Not not a Caribbean
[37:20] spirits and African spirit and a
[37:22] European. No, one spirit.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; And that spirit make everyone in the
[37:28] body behave the same way.
[37:32] Oh, glory to God.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That spirit IS FIRE.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; THAT SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU WORSHIP
[37:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS THE OBJECT OF WORSHIP.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; HEY. HALLELUJAH.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; That spirit
[37:51] &gt;&gt; would move you
[37:53] &gt;&gt; and influence you.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight.
[37:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:00] Glory to God. [applause and cheering]
[38:02] You may be seated.
[38:04] We all have our own human spirit.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; We all have our own food taste
[38:12] &gt;&gt; that is allowed by God. You have your
[38:14] kind of food and dish. The Chinese will
[38:16] have it. The Europers will have it.
[38:18] Everybody have their own thing. That's a
[38:20] human spirit. But the Holy Spirit
[38:22] &gt;&gt; is higher than all of that.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our human spirit have
[38:28] nothing to do with the Holy Spirit.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Actually, God gave us a new spirit to
[38:32] work with the Holy Spirit.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; A new heart I will give you.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; A new spirit I will give you. And then I
[38:42] WILL PUT MY SPIRIT
[38:44] &gt;&gt; into your spirit.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:51] Because the spirit that we have cannot
[38:55] work with the spirit of God until God
[38:57] changes it.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So he has to give us a new spirit,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; a new heart towards God. A spirit that
[39:05] could work with his spirit. And in that
[39:09] context for us to work with loving
[39:17] into his love.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; If you note that brotherly kindness come
[39:21] after godliness. And to be in godliness
[39:24] is to be like God. But yet the word
[39:27] became flesh and dwell among us. Yet
[39:30] with godliness, we still need the
[39:32] brotherly kindness on top of that that
[39:34] we could express this love to our
[39:36] brethren because Jesus demonstrated it
[39:39] and say by this shall all men know that
[39:43] you are my disciples when you could have
[39:45] this love. If you notice right on top of
[39:48] brotherly kindness is holy spirit. So to
[39:51] access holy spirit you have to come
[39:53] through forgiveness. You have to come
[39:55] through dropping yours, forgiving your
[39:58] brother, forgiving your sister, letting
[40:00] things go.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[40:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; You be seated.
[40:09] You know, I said something in France and
[40:12] something struck me about the woman who
[40:15] was caught in the act of adultery
[40:18] and how something could go from public
[40:21] to private. And when they were trying to
[40:24] test Jesus,
[40:26] they said this woman was caught and she
[40:28] should be stoned according to Moses law.
[40:32] And Jesus said, "Amen.
[40:35] A I'm not here to fight Moses law, but
[40:36] just before you stone, which one of you
[40:40] without sin cast the first stone?" And I
[40:44] love what Jesus did. He didn't watch
[40:47] them, shame them, embarrass them,
[40:50] belittle them, abuse them, rebuke them.
[40:53] He did not. He turned his back to them
[40:56] and he be to write. We don't know what
[40:59] he was writing. Maybe he's writing
[41:00] faith, virtue, knowledge. I don't know
[41:03] what he was writing. He was writing
[41:05] something. But one by one, each one
[41:09] left.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And then when he turned around, he said,
[41:12] "Woman, where are your accusers?
[41:16] When she looked, she saw no one. So here
[41:18] it was. Everybody knew what she did.
[41:21] Everybody was there as a witness. And
[41:23] now all of a sudden, they're gone.
[41:26] And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn
[41:29] thee. Go and sin no more." In other
[41:31] words, he released her from her past,
[41:34] her shame, her guilt. She knew, listen,
[41:37] by revelation, his pardon and his love
[41:41] &gt;&gt; and his grace.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Nobody else was there to see that. So
[41:44] she was to walk back home knowing that
[41:47] she has been released, knowing that she
[41:49] has been set free. Knowing nobody else
[41:51] know about that. No other church person.
[41:54] Nobody knows. No, you have to know that
[41:56] by revelation. You have to know you have
[41:58] been released. You have to know you are
[42:00] forgiven. You have to know his pardoning
[42:02] grace has to be extended to you. That's
[42:04] the Jesus that I serve. That's the Jesus
[42:07] I want to see. He's the same yesterday,
[42:10] today, and forever.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Now this five-fold ministry
[42:22] according to Ephesians 4:11, apostles,
[42:25] prophets and so forth, they have a
[42:28] purpose. The Bible said the perfection
[42:30] of the saints for the work of the
[42:32] ministry, the edifying of the body till
[42:36] we all come in the unity of the faith.
[42:39] So there is going to be a unity of the
[42:42] faith. Not a unity of groups, not a
[42:45] unity of churches, not a unity of
[42:47] fellowships. No, a unity of the faith.
[42:50] Because there is only one Lord and
[42:52] there's only one faith. There's only one
[42:55] baptism. A unity of default. And William
[42:58] Brham came to turn our hearts back to
[43:02] the faith of the fathers. So we have to
[43:04] turn back, pick up the father's faith,
[43:07] and then come back and go to the rapture
[43:09] with rapturing faith.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have to
[43:13] we have to go back and pick up what they
[43:15] had because they had the original fate.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; How many understand that tonight?
[43:22] &gt;&gt; So, but Abraham didn't come to bring
[43:24] something new. He came to get us back to
[43:26] the original because you cannot change
[43:28] the original. The original is the
[43:30] original seed. WHAT WE ARE HAVING,
[43:33] LISTEN, WHAT WE HAVING NOW IS A
[43:35] REPRODUCTION of the original grain.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HAPPENING now is a reproduction
[43:44] of the original grain.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Now the prophets the the Bible says
[43:50] speaking the truth in love. Okay. So
[43:52] watch that we hencefor children. You may
[43:54] be seated. So this five for ministry is
[43:57] to assist the bride to come into
[44:00] spiritual maturity
[44:02] because if you are child you are not air
[44:07] until they come into maturity. So God
[44:09] don't want babes and children and
[44:11] pumpers and and and baby bottle and
[44:13] shaking and rocking and crying
[44:16] everything you only crying crying. God
[44:18] don't want that. God want spiritual
[44:20] maturity that you could handle your
[44:22] stuff.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; That you could handle your issues
[44:27] &gt;&gt; that you could face to your challenges.
[44:29] This is what spiritual maturity is
[44:32] about. In Galatians it said if a child a
[44:35] child is under tutors and governors
[44:39] until the time appointed. So even though
[44:42] all the land is yours or houses and
[44:44] money and everything is yours, you still
[44:46] have to wait until you're committed to
[44:48] that maturity. And waiting means you're
[44:50] under tutorship. You're under guidance.
[44:53] You're under leadership. This is what
[44:54] the ministry is all about to bring you
[44:56] into discipline. That's a word people
[44:59] don't like to use. [snorts] They want to
[45:00] just sit on the bench and go in the
[45:02] rapture. Oh, glory. It's not working
[45:03] that way. But a Brandon was brought into
[45:06] discipline. He lost his wife. He lost
[45:08] his child. He lost the anointing. He was
[45:11] brought into discipline by his
[45:13] experiences, by hard trials and harder
[45:17] trials. And it brought him into a shape
[45:20] just how God wanted him. So sometimes we
[45:23] have questions and I want you to let go
[45:25] of those questions and say, "God, have
[45:27] your own way. No more questions. You
[45:29] just have your own way in my life.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHY I'M GOING
[45:35] THROUGH THIS AND I BELIEVE YOU THAT ALL
[45:38] THINGS will work together for my good
[45:41] because I love God to them who are the
[45:43] called according to his purpose.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this five-fold ministry
[45:51] will not be men's ministry. You may be
[45:54] seated. This five-fold ministry will be
[45:57] Jesus ministry in men. I know the devil
[46:01] trying to slash and and execute and get
[46:05] rid of a five-fold ministry and just
[46:07] play tapes. But there's a genuine
[46:10] five-fold ministry because the same God
[46:12] say, "Behold, I send you Elijah the
[46:14] prophet and it had flesh on it called
[46:16] William Brham." It's the same God that
[46:18] said THERE'LL BE A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY.
[46:19] IT HAVE TO HAVE SOME FLESH ON IT.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises. The same
[46:24] God THAT SAY I SEND YOU ELIJAH AND PUT
[46:27] WILLIAM Brandon flesh on that scripture
[46:29] is the same God will take Ephesians 4
[46:31] and put flesh on that scripture.
[46:33] Apostles, prophets, teachers,
[46:34] evangelists, God himself would put flesh
[46:37] on those scriptures and make it come
[46:38] alive and make it real. And our bride
[46:41] will be edified. Our bride will be
[46:43] strengthened. OUR BRIDE WILL BE
[46:44] INSPIRED. OUR BRIDE WILL BE ANOINTED
[46:47] BECAUSE GOD WILL TAKE THAT AND MAKE IT
[46:50] ALIVE. OH, give the Lord some praises
[46:52] tonight. Hallelujah.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[46:57] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Now the body is not
[47:00] one. Your body is not a nose. You're not
[47:04] smelling alone. Your body is not eyes.
[47:07] You're not seeing alone. The body is a
[47:09] complex thing.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; It have eyes. It have ears. It have
[47:14] nose. It have mouth. Now if the nose say
[47:18] or the mouth say I the eyes say I don't
[47:20] like being in front. I want to go
[47:21] behind.
[47:23] I want to see what going on behind. So I
[47:25] I I I I I don't want to be in front
[47:27] anymore. We we have problems. So the
[47:30] bride body
[47:32] &gt;&gt; is a body.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; It's not one member.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; It's not one hand. Your body is not a
[47:38] hand. You have hands. You have feet. You
[47:40] have head. You have neck. Your body is a
[47:43] complex thing. The bride body is a
[47:46] complex thing. It's a body that's around
[47:48] the world. It's a international body. By
[47:51] one spirit you can't see into that body.
[47:53] You are baptized into that body as an
[47:55] individual.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; But it's the body of Christ. But the
[47:58] Bible said from whom the whole body
[48:01] fitly joined together.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So at some point in time it has to join.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; It has to connect. We have to respect
[48:10] and recognize that you are my brother.
[48:12] You are my sister and we are part of
[48:14] this great glorious body. You can't put
[48:17] me out and I can put you in and I can
[48:19] put you out and you can put me in. Do
[48:21] you understand what I'm saying? Because
[48:22] it's one glorious body.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:27] GLORY TO GOD. IT'S ONE BODY. [applause]
[48:31] HALLELUJAH.
[48:32] My God. My God. Brother Brandon says,
[48:36] "Dear brother, sister, there's only one
[48:38] church and that's the body of believers
[48:40] out of every church that are true
[48:42] believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:45] That's the only church there is. We do
[48:47] not come into church in the church of
[48:49] God. We become into this fellowship.
[48:52] Aha. Place it. When you come to a group,
[48:55] a lot of ministers don't don't don't
[48:57] think that. They think they own the
[48:58] people. They think they're controlling
[49:00] the group. When you come into a group,
[49:02] you come into a fellowship. This is a
[49:04] fellowship. But when you come in by the
[49:06] spirit, you come into the body.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; It's not the same.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; What we are having tonight is a
[49:13] fellowship.
[49:15] All the churches, all the churches
[49:17] around the world, they're having
[49:19] fellowship. He said in there you get
[49:22] good, bad, renegade, all kind of people
[49:25] in the church. Now, some ministers
[49:27] believe their church higher than others,
[49:30] better than others,
[49:32] top top and so on. That is foolishness.
[49:35] That is not what the program taught. And
[49:37] that shows they don't believe the
[49:38] message
[49:39] &gt;&gt; because he taught us that in the church
[49:41] I'm good,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; bad,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; renegades, all kind of types
[49:46] &gt;&gt; in the church. BUT THAT IS CHURCH.
[49:49] THAT'S NOT THE BODY. THAT'S THE CHURCH.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And let me say something strong here.
[49:58] Now, there's a five-fold in the body and
[50:01] there's a five-fold out of the body.
[50:04] It's two different things all together
[50:06] &gt;&gt; in the body is for the body.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; So there is no selfishness. There is no
[50:10] self motive. There is no selfpropelling.
[50:13] And you want your kingdom and you want
[50:15] your ministry and you want that and you
[50:17] want to do this. There is no politics
[50:19] because Christ have no politics.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Leave that for the politician.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[50:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; YOU may receive it. The book of Acts
[50:31] wasn't the acts of men. Yes,
[50:33] &gt;&gt; it was the acts of the Holy Ghost
[50:35] &gt;&gt; in men.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:43] [applause]
[50:44] THOSE MEN WERE LED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[50:48] MOVED BY THE HOLY GHOST. ANOINTED WITH
[50:51] THE HOLY GHOST. NOBODY stopped them.
[50:54] DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION. SHOULD I
[50:55] go here? Should I go here? Should I
[50:58] fellowship with this one? SHOULD I SHAKE
[50:59] HAND WITH THIS ONE? They had no
[51:01] confusion whatsoever.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were in one mind.
[51:05] THEY WERE IN ONE ACCORD. THEY HAD ONE
[51:08] VISION. THEY SAW ONE BODY. THEY HAD ONE
[51:11] HEAD.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAD ONE SPIRIT.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD a shout. [cheering]
[51:17] [applause]
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Let me see. And I'm saying tonight,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; every kingdom of man will fall.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; We see empires fall.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; We see the French Empire fall. We see
[51:37] the British Empire fall. We saw the
[51:39] Roman Empire fall. And you're seeing
[51:41] American Empire falling in slow motion.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; In real in real time,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; you're seeing a whole empire fall.
[51:53] Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Daniel saw a stone.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; That stone wasn't cut out by some
[52:00] technological company.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That stone was cut out
[52:03] &gt;&gt; without hands.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; God cut that stone.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And when God cut that stone, he struck
[52:09] the image and kingdoms begin to fall.
[52:12] Well, a stone is coming and we are
[52:15] waiting for that storm.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; A rock is coming and we are waiting for
[52:19] that rock. Dynamics is coming and we are
[52:21] WAITING FOR DYNAMICS. RAIN IS coming and
[52:24] we are waiting for that rain. The same
[52:27] rain that float Noah boat
[52:30] &gt;&gt; act kill the people and B said the same
[52:34] Holy Ghost we are worshiping and it will
[52:36] kill the people same Holy Ghost. Don't
[52:40] forget this church saints the same God
[52:43] that brought out two million people kill
[52:45] them.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat that. The same God that
[52:52] brought two million people out of Egypt
[52:54] is the same God that killed them because
[52:57] of unbelief.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a game. It's not because we
[53:02] have to spoke with books. We are in the
[53:03] bride. It's not like that.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; It's a little more than that.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The books means nothing if
[53:13] we don't apply it.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; The tapes means nothing if we don't
[53:17] apply it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE GOT TO APPLY IT
[53:20] &gt;&gt; to our own lives.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Noah had it rough because for 120 years
[53:29] he is building an ark preaching
[53:31] revelation. He have the drawings that
[53:34] God gave him. He have the specification.
[53:36] Noah can't feel led.
[53:39] God tell me 20 ft but I'm going to make
[53:42] it 10 feet. It can't work.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; It has to be according to what God said.
[53:48] We have to understand that God can't
[53:50] lie. God makes no mistake. You are not
[53:52] here by chance tonight. You are not a
[53:54] mistake.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil tell you that
[53:57] you are a mistake. There is no mistake
[54:00] about you. There's no mistake around
[54:02] you. There is no mistake about you.
[54:06] [applause]
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You are predestinated
[54:11] &gt;&gt; to face the challenge of the hour.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; You will be seated. Praise God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:16] Huh? In this hour, God needs special
[54:19] men,
[54:20] &gt;&gt; special women.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Call them special forces.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; He can't take any anybody. He has to
[54:25] take special people. That's why he
[54:27] called you to deal and to handle with
[54:30] what you have to deal with.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; No other age is so difficult as this
[54:33] age. You're still alive.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You're not dead.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You have activity in your limbs.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; You can still raise your hands. YOU CAN
[54:41] STILL SAY HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN STILL
[54:42] WORSHIP. GOD PUT YOU HERE FOR THAT.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; OH, praise the name of the Lord.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause]
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe season it.
[54:53] When you look at technology now, you
[54:56] can't help but wonder
[54:59] if God allow man to continue, where will
[55:01] he go? He will try to make manual. He
[55:03] will say, "Let us make manual." These
[55:06] guys, their intelligence and wisdom and
[55:08] wherever they're getting the source from
[55:10] is next level. So that is why God send
[55:15] them the eyes and after that is the
[55:18] intelligence. Now what they have now is
[55:21] AI artificial intelligence. The
[55:24] intelligence God going to give us is not
[55:26] artificial.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; We have the real thing
[55:29] &gt;&gt; which should be the mind of Christ
[55:31] &gt;&gt; to know what he wants done
[55:33] &gt;&gt; with the WORD OF GOD.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:37] Satan was waiting for this time to
[55:40] establish the beast system because the
[55:43] beast system have to know everything.
[55:46] And they get the technology now to be
[55:49] able to know everything. Everyone.
[55:51] There's no privacy. They know who you
[55:53] are. They know where your house is. They
[55:55] know what car you're driving. They know
[55:56] everything about you.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; That is how Satan will get the
[56:00] information.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; But God, the spirit of wisdom don't need
[56:04] that.
[56:07] Satan getting his information through
[56:10] knowledge, science and technology. But
[56:13] God look at prophet stand on the
[56:14] platform. He say your name is so and so.
[56:16] Your house number is so and so. There's
[56:18] no technology doing that. God have a
[56:21] higher technology THAN MAN'S TECHNOLOGY
[56:24] THAN ZION'S TECHNOLOGY. OH, GLORY TO
[56:26] GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[56:30] Discernment coming back.
[56:33] Yes,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; every gift will come back in the church.
[56:36] You may be seated.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; We would need every one of them. So, but
[56:40] the Bible is on the platform. You're
[56:41] going to pray for this one. But the
[56:43] pillar of fire, some faith pulling here.
[56:45] You see that woman there? God just heal
[56:47] you of kidney trouble. And he said, "Go
[56:49] just heal you of high blood pressure. Go
[56:50] God heal your diabetes." He's what what
[56:52] is happening there? He is tapping into
[56:54] the intelligence of God. There's not
[56:56] artificial intelligence. There's not
[56:58] some of these false prophets. They're
[57:00] looking on Facebook and see what people
[57:01] sick with who the neighbor is, who the
[57:02] brother is, and they say, "Your name is,
[57:04] oh, your name is right. Your brother
[57:06] Johnny, you have a brother named
[57:07] Stephanos." But they checking on
[57:08] Facebook.
[57:10] Lying prophets have things in their ears
[57:13] calling people name. And why they doing
[57:14] that? They're checking. They checking.
[57:15] They checking. Not brother Brandham. He
[57:17] don't check no Facebook. He could tell
[57:19] you where you're from, what you did, how
[57:21] far YOU DID IT, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
[57:23] WHY IT HAPPENED TO YOU, AND WHAT YOU
[57:25] NEED TO DO. What is that? THE
[57:27] INTELLIGENCE OF MAN. KNOW THE
[57:29] INTELLIGENCE of God
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and that INTELLIGENCE IS what is
[57:32] promised
[57:34] &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Even the mind of Christ give the Lord
[57:38] some praises.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:45] Maybe he said [applause]
[57:47] the Holy Spirit told Cornelius to send
[57:50] for Peter
[57:51] &gt;&gt; from Japa. Specific things
[57:54] &gt;&gt; specific to who to ask for.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; What happened there? The intelligence
[57:59] drop down on Cornelius. The intelligence
[58:01] dropped down on Peter, go and eat. He
[58:04] doesn't even know he have to go to the
[58:05] Gentiles. But God set it up. He arranged
[58:09] a meeting. And Peter didn't even know
[58:11] what is going to unfold. He was just
[58:13] testifying. And the Bible said while
[58:15] Peter spoke the words, the Holy Ghost
[58:18] &gt;&gt; fell on them
[58:20] &gt;&gt; that heard the word.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; What was the mystery behind that? The
[58:24] mystery behind that is that you could
[58:26] only get life from the body
[58:31] &gt;&gt; and Peter was part of the body
[58:36] &gt;&gt; and your blood cells flow through your
[58:37] entire body to your heart your pumping.
[58:40] So Peter was in the body of Christ so
[58:43] life could come out of his mouth.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So he spoke the word
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and then the spirit fell on the word
[58:51] &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy
[58:52] Ghost. and they have not been baptized
[58:55] yet in water.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; That is about to repeat.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; They will send for Peter.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[59:07] [applause and cheering]
[59:14] So this Holy Ghost we speaking about is
[59:17] not the just the birth 1906 what the
[59:20] Pentecostal claim to have. This Holy
[59:22] Ghost he's talking about is the Holy
[59:24] Ghost itself. The person of Christ in
[59:28] individuals. So Peter had that person.
[59:32] So when he spoke the word, God honored
[59:34] it. So it come like this. Right now we
[59:37] are identified with the message. We
[59:38] believe the message. We believe what
[59:39] Baram says. But one of these days the
[59:41] message will begin to identify stuff
[59:43] with us.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, it will switch. No
[59:46] longer you identify, but the message.
[59:48] This is him here. This is my son here.
[59:50] This is my daughter here. Look, look,
[59:52] look. You can't hide no more. You can't
[59:53] duck anymore. You can't avoid anymore.
[59:56] God will choose you and pick you out.
[59:58] That's what he did with Job. HE SAID,
[1:00:00] "SATAN, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY servant
[1:00:02] Job?" He said, "Yeah, you have a hedge
[1:00:05] around him." He said, "No, no, no. He's
[1:00:06] the best man on earth. There's not
[1:00:08] another man like him on earth. Test him.
[1:00:11] Try him and I'll prove to you." He said,
[1:00:13] "If you if you take a hedge, I'll make
[1:00:15] him curse you." And what happened there
[1:00:17] was the faith of God in Job that Job
[1:00:20] that God was bragging on. God is not
[1:00:21] bragging on you. He's bragging on his
[1:00:23] faith inside of you. He know you'll come
[1:00:26] through. He know you're going to break
[1:00:27] out. You're going to bust out your
[1:00:29] prison. Oh, glory to God. You're going
[1:00:31] to break OUT YOUR FEARS. HALLELUJAH. YOU
[1:00:33] ARE GOING to be delivered. I DON'T CARE
[1:00:36] WHAT YOU ARE BOUND WITH TONIGHT. YOU ARE
[1:00:38] GOING TO BE DELIVERED. God see your
[1:00:40] deliverance.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God.
[1:00:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:47] All right.
[1:00:50] Time run. Okay. So, we know when they
[1:00:53] were building the temple that they
[1:00:56] didn't have all the material in
[1:00:57] Palestine.
[1:00:59] And this is a good type. So, they had us
[1:01:02] to get the different material from
[1:01:03] around the world and get it cut
[1:01:07] according to specification
[1:01:09] because the Bible said there was not a
[1:01:11] hammer or saw herd. So when it came
[1:01:13] together, it was just fitting in it. And
[1:01:16] listen to what Baram says. Notice the
[1:01:18] material wasn't found only in Palestine.
[1:01:21] This temple because it just wasn't
[1:01:23] there. He had to go to the rest of the
[1:01:26] world known world. What a beautiful
[1:01:28] application that God here we go. Don't
[1:01:32] just cut his materials out of Jews only,
[1:01:35] out of white only, out of brown or red
[1:01:39] or black or whatever colors they may be
[1:01:42] or whatever just out United States, out
[1:01:44] of Canada only. But he cuts his
[1:01:47] materials from all the world. How many
[1:01:50] knows God doesn't speak English?
[1:01:54] God is not an English man.
[1:01:58] I hope you get that this tonight. You
[1:02:01] know people think God is an English man.
[1:02:02] He only speak a language. No. God can
[1:02:05] speak French. God can speak Russian. God
[1:02:07] can speak Spanish. God can speak any
[1:02:09] language. He can speak in other tongues
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; because he is God.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Now, if they were cutting the stone of a
[1:02:22] certain kind that was found in such a
[1:02:23] part of the country and cutting a stone
[1:02:25] over another nation to fit the stone and
[1:02:28] it might have seemed strange to the
[1:02:30] people passing by these odd stones being
[1:02:32] cut. Now watch, he is cutting them. Here
[1:02:35] we go. in the way that he wishes. And we
[1:02:39] find out that the materials being cut in
[1:02:42] their own native land was pecular to a
[1:02:45] material cut in another native land. So
[1:02:48] that means we can't go and tell people
[1:02:50] in Africa how to do it because God have
[1:02:53] his African brethren dealing with them,
[1:02:57] cutting them, heing them out. Same thing
[1:02:59] with in India. Same thing in wherever in
[1:03:02] America or Europe. You understand what
[1:03:03] I'm saying? So he knows how to cut
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and he is the one that going to fit it
[1:03:08] together.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Like the three wise men, one bought
[1:03:11] gold, one bought frankincense, one
[1:03:13] bought m. Now if you don't have
[1:03:15] revelation, you would ask what what you
[1:03:16] bringing?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, he bringing gold. I bring in gold,
[1:03:19] too.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; No revelation. Oh, you bringing
[1:03:22] frankincense. I bring frankincense, too.
[1:03:24] No revelation. If they wasn't wise and
[1:03:27] they had no revelation, the man with the
[1:03:29] frankincense will feel bad because
[1:03:31] frankincense is like the lowest. because
[1:03:34] that's for debt.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; The man will have gold will feel good
[1:03:37] but together their message says God in
[1:03:40] service to die.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; So together you saw the picture together
[1:03:44] you saw the message but each brought a
[1:03:46] revelation as God give it to them.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; This is what God want from us.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Walk with your revelation.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Speak your revelation.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Declare your revelation.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; But it must be in the word. Right.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Listen. So we find out the material cut
[1:04:05] in a in their own native land was
[1:04:07] peculiar to the material cut in another
[1:04:09] native land. We find out they were
[1:04:12] transported by ox cart and so on. And he
[1:04:15] says now but there was one stone to be
[1:04:18] restored. He said what there wasn't one
[1:04:21] stone to be restored. He talk about
[1:04:23] masonry and architecture. Now many of
[1:04:26] those stones look very odd. There was a
[1:04:29] place in the temple for every odd
[1:04:32] peculiar stone. And this to me is
[1:04:34] showing where you have to be able to
[1:04:36] show respects whether they come from
[1:04:38] whatever country. Because what you're
[1:04:40] looking for is to hear God and to see
[1:04:42] God and how God will use a man to help
[1:04:45] you, to bless you, to speak to you. So
[1:04:48] even though he might be odd in his
[1:04:50] words, in his pronunciation, odd in his
[1:04:52] language, odd in how he looks, it
[1:04:55] doesn't mean it's not God. I told him in
[1:04:57] France, not because God is silent, he's
[1:04:59] absent.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He could be hidden.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean because he's hidden,
[1:05:06] he's absent
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; because Jesus ministry from age 12 to 18
[1:05:11] was silent. Jesus didn't speak, he
[1:05:14] didn't work, he didn't do, he didn't
[1:05:15] explain. When he hear him teaching false
[1:05:17] doctrine in the temple, Jesus didn't
[1:05:19] say, "Yo, false." Jesus Jesus didn't
[1:05:22] argue with them. He just waited until
[1:05:25] his time came.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And when his time came, he is baptized
[1:05:28] with the Holy Ghost. He overcome the
[1:05:30] devil in the wilderness. Overcome
[1:05:31] privately, not with deacons and elders
[1:05:33] and other preachers only by himself.
[1:05:35] Overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust
[1:05:37] of the flesh and the pride of life. He
[1:05:38] overcome that privately. Nobody knows
[1:05:40] that.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Right now, the spirit is upon him.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; He returned in the power of the spirit.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; And they said, "We want somebody to read
[1:05:47] scripture tonight." And Jesus put up his
[1:05:49] hand first time. I said, "Okay, I'll be
[1:05:51] so glad Joseph Mary's son coming to read
[1:05:53] for us tonight." And he have to find all
[1:05:55] these big scrolls. You know, they had
[1:05:56] them rolls like that and he had to find
[1:05:58] Isaiah and then he found Isaiah and then
[1:06:01] get the chapter and roll it out. Then he
[1:06:03] begin to read. The spirit of God is upon
[1:06:05] me because he and they thought he's text
[1:06:07] he's reading. He's not reading text. He
[1:06:09] is the text he's reading. The spirit is
[1:06:10] upon me because he hath anointed me. Is
[1:06:13] that a quote? He is the court THEY'RE
[1:06:14] TALKING ABOUT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:06:17] FOR HE HAD ANOINTED me to preach, to do
[1:06:20] this, to do that. And then he rolled
[1:06:22] back the scroll, put it down, sat down.
[1:06:24] I said, "This day,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:06:29] ears.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; And all them have sleeping." What? Can't
[1:06:33] believe it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; But that was the fulfillment of the
[1:06:37] promised word.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And one of these days, you will have the
[1:06:40] privilege to say this is that that the
[1:06:44] prophet William Brandham spake of. Oh,
[1:06:46] GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT
[1:06:49] HERE TO VINDICATE A MAN. WE ARE HERE to
[1:06:51] vindicate God's word.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN the house.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT HERE TO VINDICATE
[1:06:58] A MAN. We are here to vindicate what God
[1:07:01] have said. God can't lie. We have many
[1:07:04] people who have gone on to the sixth
[1:07:06] dimension holding on to this promise.
[1:07:08] And they without us are not made
[1:07:10] perfect. They [music] are depending upon
[1:07:11] us.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Not all of us will sleep. We who are
[1:07:14] alive and remain. Give the give the Lord
[1:07:16] a shout in the house.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; There are going to be we who are alive
[1:07:20] and remain. Praise God. You may be
[1:07:23] seated.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, brother Brandon, now he's
[1:07:28] taking this type and he's switching it
[1:07:31] to ministries. Our ministries, which is
[1:07:34] a beautiful type here, shows our
[1:07:37] pecularity,
[1:07:38] our way of worship. Yet when the temple
[1:07:41] the real temple we will come to after a
[1:07:44] few minutes come together every odd
[1:07:46] acting person we may look a little funny
[1:07:48] to someone else act a little funny but
[1:07:52] remember it's the place there for us God
[1:07:56] is cutting out his church and every
[1:07:58] little stone have its place exactly to
[1:08:02] it and remember it was cut from the
[1:08:05] place that will be put together isn't
[1:08:07] that right so we
[1:08:09] of the spiritual how that every gift of
[1:08:13] God, every odd acting born-again
[1:08:15] Christian in their pecularity have got
[1:08:19] its place. It fits in the body, it goes
[1:08:23] to its right place. So then what is the
[1:08:25] issue? Who is really ahead? This is not
[1:08:30] Olympics. This is not 100 meters and 200
[1:08:32] meters and I win the race. That's
[1:08:34] foolishness. We are coming down to the B
[1:08:37] system. We are coming down to where they
[1:08:39] will shut down the churches. We are
[1:08:41] coming down where Satan is like a
[1:08:43] roaring lion to see if we devour the
[1:08:46] church. We are coming down to what Jesus
[1:08:48] said when the son of man cometh, shall
[1:08:50] he find faith on the earth or would
[1:08:52] people lose the faith.
[1:08:55] Think about it. Over 50 plus years
[1:08:58] believing this message and people
[1:08:59] getting weary and tired and people are
[1:09:01] stumbling and fumbling and going slow
[1:09:04] and just taking it easy like if this
[1:09:06] message is nothing and we are saying
[1:09:08] Elias is already come and the Lord
[1:09:10] himself has descended with a shout
[1:09:13] [applause]
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; AND THE SHOUT IS IN US.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE SECRET IS THE
[1:09:19] WORD IS IN THE BRIDE. THE SHOUT IS IN
[1:09:21] YOU. THE MESSAGE IS IN YOU. THE WORD IS
[1:09:23] IN YOU.
[1:09:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; But you're waiting for the spirit.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; But
[1:09:32] what I say, he said, if it's in Okay,
[1:09:34] I'll skip. There was one stone that
[1:09:37] actually was too odd to fool with. So
[1:09:39] the builders rejected it. They had built
[1:09:41] the building so high until they missed
[1:09:43] that stone. And they begin to look for
[1:09:45] that stone. And he said Jesus spoke of
[1:09:47] it. He said, "Have you not read of the
[1:09:49] stone? The stone that the builders
[1:09:50] refused was the chief cornerstone the
[1:09:53] head of the rest of it. And I think in
[1:09:56] building today of the spiritual house
[1:09:58] that God worship him. I think the great
[1:10:02] big failure today among the builders we
[1:10:05] have come with our denomination. We have
[1:10:07] laid them in sincerity. We have sent our
[1:10:10] boys to school to educate them to speak
[1:10:13] well. He says, "But we try to build it
[1:10:15] upon education, but these things will
[1:10:18] not work as long we have not accepted
[1:10:21] this odd stone." And that is where the
[1:10:23] builders are today. That is why the
[1:10:26] bride building here we go. Of Christ is
[1:10:30] not ready for the bridegroom is because
[1:10:34] the builders have rejected the chief
[1:10:37] cornerstone that was laid on their
[1:10:39] Pentecost, which is the baptism of the
[1:10:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:10:43] So flip it anyh how you want to flip it.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; We have a bunch of Baptists in the
[1:10:47] message now
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; believing that when they believe the
[1:10:50] message they have the Holy Ghost. Why?
[1:10:53] Because brother Brandham says and he was
[1:10:55] talking to the Pentecostals. The
[1:10:56] Pentecostals claimed to have an
[1:10:57] experience. He said if you have an
[1:10:59] experience and you receive this message
[1:11:01] then you have the Holy Ghost. I was a
[1:11:04] Catholic. I didn't know nothing about
[1:11:06] anything but the Holy Ghost. You see me
[1:11:08] jumping shouting. I came as I told her
[1:11:10] brother Janu Catholic. You ever see a
[1:11:12] Catholic alive?
[1:11:14] Catholic is dead. Pentecostal was still
[1:11:16] worship. And I come from Catholic into
[1:11:18] this message. I know nothing about
[1:11:20] Pentecostal.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; But something happened to me
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; that changed me.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not a Catholic. I'm a believer.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; A born again believer. A baptized
[1:11:29] believer.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And I see when the spirit fall, it have
[1:11:34] people behaving one way.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost way.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; One way. It make you shout. It make it
[1:11:42] that you know it blow my mind. But
[1:11:44] Abraham says when John saw his name,
[1:11:47] John say all in heaven all under the
[1:11:48] earth I praise God. And you go to the
[1:11:50] message and you see people not even
[1:11:52] praising, not even worshiping just
[1:11:53] watching.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name? Do you
[1:11:56] understand what this name thing is
[1:11:58] about?
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Do you understand your name was sealed
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; with seven seals?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; When the seals was broken, he broke your
[1:12:06] name. When the mighty angel came down,
[1:12:08] he came down with the book with your
[1:12:10] name in it.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; When the thunders were uttered, he throw
[1:12:13] your names out
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; and the thunders found you.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; SO, you ought to understand, you are one
[1:12:22] in a million truly.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] [applause]
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; My God, they rejected it. What they
[1:12:33] rejected the captain soon. I'm going to
[1:12:34] skip. Praise God. I lost track of time.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He says here, "A body has thou prepared
[1:12:42] me? What house will you build me?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Heaven is my throne.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Earth is my foottool. What house will
[1:12:50] you build me?"
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "But a body has thou prepared."
[1:12:53] And here, brother Brandham, a body of
[1:12:55] believers,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; a body that has been born.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:13:02] Amen. He said the people they are
[1:13:04] following after creeds and things and
[1:13:07] leaving off following the Holy Spirit
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; because people like to believe things. I
[1:13:12] believe this. I believe this as if that
[1:13:14] belief taking them to the rapture.
[1:13:16] Belief is not taking to the rapture. Oil
[1:13:18] is taken to rapture.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Power is taken to the rapture.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Elon Musk cannot send up those rockets
[1:13:24] with gasoline.
[1:13:26] He cannot light a fire and say, "Oh god,
[1:13:27] I'm going to light it like if it's um
[1:13:29] what you call it uh these things make
[1:13:31] noise. These things pop light and
[1:13:35] he can't light under the rocket and I'm
[1:13:37] going to I'm going to put a a matches on
[1:13:39] the rocket and going to take off." No,
[1:13:40] he has to have the right mixture inside
[1:13:42] of there for this because the rockets
[1:13:44] going out of space.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; And if we have to go in the rapture, we
[1:13:47] have to have a power
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; to take us out of here.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Books can't take us out.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Pressing play can't take you out.
[1:13:54] talking it can't TAKE YOU OUT.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; EXPLAINING IT can't take you out. You
[1:13:57] will need a power.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I don't have that power. He has it.
[1:14:04] [cheering]
[1:14:05] [applause]
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And I can give you a promise. I can give
[1:14:07] you a promise. Acts 18, you shall
[1:14:09] receive power
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, power is coming.
[1:14:16] Get ready. Get ready. Get ready.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Power is on its way.
[1:14:21] [applause]
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; So he designed us, here we go, to come
[1:14:27] together in heavenly [clears throat]
[1:14:29] places in Christ and have these
[1:14:31] supernatural workings of God outlets
[1:14:34] through gifts of the spirit such as
[1:14:37] prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and
[1:14:39] gift of healing and all these other
[1:14:41] different gifts is outlets that God let
[1:14:44] out his power and let out his revelation
[1:14:47] to the people. Not as individuals so
[1:14:50] much but as a unit. We are all together
[1:14:54] one great body of believers. And how do
[1:14:56] we get into this body, the mystic body
[1:14:59] of the Lord Jesus? By one spirit, we are
[1:15:02] all baptized. Praise the name of the
[1:15:04] Lord.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; What we need today, the greatest healing
[1:15:09] we need today is the healing of the body
[1:15:11] of Jesus Christ. his body, the body of
[1:15:15] believers that have been broke up by
[1:15:17] different denominations. They are
[1:15:20] different one from another. They don't
[1:15:22] have love one for another. What we need
[1:15:24] tonight is a uniting together. All
[1:15:27] Christians shake hands. Every
[1:15:29] denominations, then God will come down
[1:15:31] and visit us.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So if God want us to get us together,
[1:15:37] who want to separate us?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Satan. So his job is to divide us. His
[1:15:44] job is for us to holds and grudge. I
[1:15:47] don't know what you do here in in Europe
[1:15:49] if how often you have to renew a license
[1:15:51] if it's every 3 years or every year or
[1:15:53] whatever. But I see people like they
[1:15:55] renewing a grudge like when the grudge
[1:15:57] finish when it's supposed to expire or
[1:15:59] the odds they go and get a renewal and
[1:16:01] they continue this fight. It makes no
[1:16:03] sense. When you stand praying forgive
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; you're praying for what? for love, for
[1:16:09] charity, for dynamics, for the power,
[1:16:11] forgive if you have ought against any.
[1:16:13] We would have ought. We are natural. We
[1:16:15] are human. We have issues. Somebody may
[1:16:17] wrong you. Somebody may lie on you. But
[1:16:20] how do you manage? God is not testing
[1:16:22] them. He's testing you. He's looking at
[1:16:24] your attitude because he want to bring
[1:16:26] you through.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; There will always be issues.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; I hear ministers will run other
[1:16:32] ministers. This one, this one, that one,
[1:16:33] that one, that. And when I'm hearing
[1:16:35] that, I say, who is perfect to judge the
[1:16:37] others like that? Everybody will have
[1:16:39] their faults, their weaknesses, their
[1:16:41] fears, whatever it is. We can't judge
[1:16:42] like that. We have to let go and let God
[1:16:45] and say, "God, that is your man, that is
[1:16:46] your servant. Use him."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; David has his issue. Samuel has issue.
[1:16:50] All them has an issue. Some start off
[1:16:52] good and end up bad. Some start off bad,
[1:16:55] end up good.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Some some Sam start off halfway. Look at
[1:16:58] Samson. Samson had issues. He wasn't
[1:17:00] going to get somebody in his own church.
[1:17:02] He going to fool around with this one,
[1:17:03] that one. you know, with Delilah. He
[1:17:05] didn't see the devil upon Delilah. He
[1:17:06] saw a shape, a height, a color, whatever
[1:17:08] it is, what he was admiring. But Samson
[1:17:10] did not see how the enemy was going to
[1:17:12] use that woman because she had another
[1:17:14] force working with her. She had another
[1:17:16] power working with her. Samson had the
[1:17:17] power of God working with him. He was
[1:17:19] covenanted by seven locks.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; So when Delilah stripped him,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; the B and this part was this part is
[1:17:26] really moving for me. The Bible said
[1:17:29] when he woke up, he shook himself like
[1:17:31] before. He expecting the same results
[1:17:33] and when he shook himself he found out
[1:17:36] he was just like a normal man. That is
[1:17:38] when you leave the anointing and when
[1:17:40] you break the covenant. Sarapson didn't
[1:17:43] understand. He took for granted what God
[1:17:45] put on him. He took for granted he's
[1:17:47] been covenanted. And when his hair was
[1:17:50] cut, no more power.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; He was just like everybody else.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; God did not call you in this message to
[1:17:56] be like everybody else.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God called you to make you a covenanted
[1:18:00] one. God called you to be a bloodcovered
[1:18:03] one.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; God called you to be different.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Once a son, always a son.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Samson, he paid the price. His eyes is
[1:18:14] out. He's in prison. They want to make
[1:18:16] fun of him. And all of a sudden, they
[1:18:19] want to bring him to make fun of him.
[1:18:20] And Samson asks to be positionally
[1:18:22] placed before he called for power. I
[1:18:26] want you to think about that. He didn't
[1:18:28] ask for power. He asked to be put in the
[1:18:33] right position before the power comes.
[1:18:36] Church, we have to be in the right
[1:18:38] position.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Lead me to the pillars. And he's
[1:18:45] standing there. You may be seated. And
[1:18:48] he said, "Once more, Lord." Now, the
[1:18:50] only reason he can say once more is
[1:18:52] because he had it before. Yes.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And he said the dynamics of this church
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; that they have worked in a small
[1:19:01] measure.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; So the only reason we could ask for more
[1:19:04] is because we had it before.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a praise.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; We can ask FOR MORE BECAUSE WE TASTED IT
[1:19:14] BEFORE.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And what happened? Samson killed more
[1:19:18] and is dead than his life.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I think I want to close. I I I run out
[1:19:22] of time.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I have 14 pages. I reached six.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I have another message for tomorrow.
[1:19:27] I'll close with this.
[1:19:30] If God give a duck enough sense to know
[1:19:33] how to dodge the coldness,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; how he ought to give the church. If a
[1:19:39] duck and do that by instinct, what about
[1:19:41] the Holy Ghost in the church? It ought
[1:19:43] to lead us, we talking about the Holy
[1:19:45] Ghost now, out of old formalities and
[1:19:48] creeds and things into a glorious,
[1:19:51] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[1:19:54] brings virtue, knowledge, patience,
[1:19:57] godliness, and the Holy Spirit. That is
[1:20:00] what the real guide would lead us to.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] Hallelujah. I know a lot of brothers,
[1:20:10] they want to stay on the mysteries. They
[1:20:12] want to stay on revelations on Ukraine
[1:20:15] and Russia and the Pope and this mystery
[1:20:18] and the vials and and and Mr. Tariff and
[1:20:21] President Tariff and all the different
[1:20:23] characters that have a wrong but the
[1:20:25] point about IT IS THIS THAT CAN'T HELP
[1:20:27] US.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; What we need is to make OURSELVES READY.
[1:20:33] HIS WIFE HAD MADE HERSELF ready
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; and the only thing will make you ready
[1:20:38] is the gown of his promised word that
[1:20:41] you could wrap yourself in it and dress
[1:20:43] yourself IN IT.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD THAT JESUS COULD SAY
[1:20:47] THAT'S my bride.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like brother Stephan say I
[1:20:51] chose her. JESUS CHOSE YOU. THAT'S MY
[1:20:54] BRIDE.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; She walks like me. She talks LIKE ME.
[1:20:57] SHE LIVES LIKE ME. SHE ACTS LIKE ME.
[1:21:00] That is my bride.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, please.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you, Lord. So, the
[1:21:09] stone will not fit at the bottom
[1:21:11] foundation.
[1:21:13] I'm going to close. Musician come
[1:21:14] please. Jesus cannot come. Here we go.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Until a church, a body of believers
[1:21:23] get and the ministry that he wants will
[1:21:27] have to be the same. They must have this
[1:21:32] ministry to raise up the Lutherans, the
[1:21:35] Wesian all through the ages. What is he
[1:21:38] saying here? Among us, we must see the
[1:21:42] ministry of Jesus Christ back into the
[1:21:45] church. We have to come under
[1:21:48] expectation for that. Not more
[1:21:50] mysteries, not more men, not more
[1:21:52] revelations, but Christ walking among
[1:21:55] us. him moving in and out. He said, "And
[1:21:59] then we are worshiping the living
[1:22:01] Christ."
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Listen to these closing words. The very
[1:22:07] ministry that Jesus Christ was doing
[1:22:10] here on earth, when it comes back, the
[1:22:13] very same ministry at Pentecost will not
[1:22:17] have to widen itself out in an
[1:22:18] organization.
[1:22:19] It until Christ the headstone, the
[1:22:21] church will fit one to another. So he's
[1:22:24] prophesying over and over and over this
[1:22:26] ministry is coming. And if the life of
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ ever puts forth another
[1:22:31] body of believers, they will write a
[1:22:33] book of acts
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; behind it because it is the same life.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He was born of God. He's coming for a
[1:22:40] church that be reborn by the spirit of
[1:22:41] God cuz the strength of the headstone
[1:22:44] runs all through the church like a
[1:22:45] magnet. We have got to be the magnetized
[1:22:48] to the headstone. THIS BRIDE BODY MUST
[1:22:51] follow the head for it is part of the
[1:22:53] resurrection. Oh my. Hallelujah. I
[1:22:56] didn't finish this part. I have to
[1:22:58] listen to this one. Therefore, the body
[1:22:59] cannot recognize. Don't you fail this.
[1:23:01] The body cannot recognize any other
[1:23:04] headship but the word.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; So we have no headquarters in America or
[1:23:09] Europe or any part of the world. Our
[1:23:11] headquarters is in heaven.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the head of the body of
[1:23:14] the church. So we have one body, one
[1:23:18] spirit, one head. God bless you, brother
[1:23:20] Jonathan. [applause]

[1:29:51] [music]
[1:29:53] [applause]
[1:29:55] You
[1:29:58] I like to come from we. I like to come
[1:30:02] to you.
[1:30:04] Not only we but in the we are many you
[1:30:08] in the we are many individuals.
[1:30:11] You have the original word. You are the
[1:30:15] original seed. And you come back to the
[1:30:19] original faith
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and you will produce
[1:30:24] another book of acts. And together
[1:30:28] we will have a book.
[1:30:32] You you God chose you as individuals.
[1:30:38] HE SAID, "I CALLED YOU one out of a
[1:30:41] million, one out of this nation, one out
[1:30:43] of this nation, one from the north, one
[1:30:46] from the south, one from the east,
[1:30:49] another one from the west. I choose them
[1:30:53] and together they are the body of Jesus
[1:30:56] Christ."
[1:31:04] I love that
[1:31:06] when he said
[1:31:08] maybe one day
[1:31:11] you open a message book,
[1:31:15] you open the Bible.
[1:31:18] You start reading it to your wife. You
[1:31:21] start reading it to your children. You
[1:31:24] start reading in the church. And you
[1:31:27] say, "Today,
[1:31:29] today
[1:31:30] The power has come into my life.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; The situations is changed.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; What I was I no more.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; My sickness turned into hell.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; The night turned into the to light.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; The darkness has gone.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; The scripture
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Our brother Oid has a burn for the body
[1:32:03] of Christ.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; This is what our body of Christ will
[1:32:09] produce.
[1:32:12] So at the end of the day, there's only
[1:32:13] one question left.
[1:32:16] Are you in the body?
[1:32:27] There's millions of questions
[1:32:30] in this world.
[1:32:34] There's millions of question
[1:32:37] in the internet.
[1:32:39] There might be millions of question
[1:32:42] in the message.
[1:32:45] But there's one question. [music]
[1:32:48] It's one question.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Are you in [music] the body?
[1:32:54] Let's pray.
[1:32:57] Dear heavenly father,
[1:33:02] after a message that was so clear
[1:33:04] tonight, Father,
[1:33:07] Lord, if we can get a true revelation
[1:33:12] of the body of Christ, Father,
[1:33:16] and to know that you are shaping us,
[1:33:19] that you are forming [snorts] us,
[1:33:21] Father, while we are in the body,
[1:33:23] Father,
[1:33:25] Lord, and we become more like you, Lord
[1:33:27] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:33:29] Father God, I pray, Father, if there's
[1:33:32] anyone tonight here, Father
[1:33:35] that says, "I'm not sure
[1:33:38] or I don't know, Father."
[1:33:41] Lord, I pray, Father, that the Holy
[1:33:43] Ghost, Father, will come into your life,
[1:33:47] Father, and give them a confirmation,
[1:33:50] Father, into their life. Give them a
[1:33:53] seal, Father, that they know they know
[1:33:58] they know they are part of their body.
[1:34:01] Father, this body is going to be
[1:34:04] resurrected one day, Father. This body
[1:34:07] is going to produce another book of
[1:34:09] Acts, Father. Lord, I pray for everyone,
[1:34:12] Lord. Father, and I thank you, Father,
[1:34:15] as we've gathered together, Father,
[1:34:17] knowing that you are in our midst,
[1:34:19] Father. Lord, father that you are here
[1:34:23] with us, Father, your being is here with
[1:34:26] us, Father. Lord, may you speak to the
[1:34:29] individuals, Father. Lord, in a personal
[1:34:32] way, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come to
[1:34:36] them, Father, Lord, I pray, Father, as
[1:34:39] they go on their way, Lord, Father,
[1:34:41] Lord, may you answer that question,
[1:34:45] Father, in their life in Jesus Christ's
[1:34:48] name. Amen. And a church say amen.
