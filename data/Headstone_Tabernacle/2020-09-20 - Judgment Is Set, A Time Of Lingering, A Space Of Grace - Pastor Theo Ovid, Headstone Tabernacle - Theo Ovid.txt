entire world just to be in the presence you're not going to a president or a prime minister or some big shot or some big ceo you're coming into the presence of the king as we say come into church when the you changed the concept of coming into prisons right in your homes this morning that presence could drop down around you and then you know you're in his presence you're in church this morning oh praise god so this morning god bless you i have three portions of scripture like to read matthew chapter 25 verse 1 to 10. revelation chapter 8 verse 1 one verse there and revelation chapter 15 i want to read verse 1 to 4 first scripture reading this morning oh praise the lord it's so good to feel his presence matthew 25 universe 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be lightened up to 10 virgins which took their lumps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise i were foolish they that were foolish took their lumps but took no oil but down the wise to call in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept on at midnight it was a crime made behold the bridegroom comet going out to meet him then all those versions of rose trim their lambs to the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answer say not so this year be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shot revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about a space of half an hour and revelation chapter 15 reading from verse 1 to 4. i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues before in them is filled up the wrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god is son of the lamb great and marvelous that i works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways the king of saints who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only and holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you for your word today and it's such strange scriptures and and what to bring here this morning and i um just uh surrendering to you lord that you would release the unction and the inspiration to deliver this word father take me out of the way and be magnified in omits lord and confirm your word to the hearts and lives of your people by pointing out your spirit and given to them the baptism of the holy ghost granted lord in jesus name i ask it father me they come for testimonies right in their homes of people receiving the holy ghost granted lord in jesus name ask a demon you may be seated praise the name of the lord thank you jesus i have a title this morning a title is a judgment is set a time of lingering a space of grace that's the title this morning judgment is set a time of lingering and a speech of grace that was subject this piece of half an hour i'll have an inspiration and that's um joke 14 14 i will wait until my change come joe 44 is if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come i want to talk about anthony for message on wednesday night time tested fate god bless you my brother praise god that's just the word oh god faith that is not tested cannot truly be trusted so god have to be able to test our fate to have their proof the question was asked when the son of man commit not shall be fined deacons elders churches steeples and message churches he said when one son of man cometh on the earth and this is after the son of man had revealed himself and to the angel of the shish of laodicea he said buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich he said now these people have plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind of a goal that brought men lives and destroyed them it was the goal that wiped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil the love of it root of all evil but there is a goal first peter 1 7 that the child of your faith being much more precious than golden parachute the goal of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of a goal and praise somebody's another quote brom says when a man is half the holy ghost he'll be christ-like in his trial he will christ like his wife his family everywhere he go be christ-like i don't care what takes place he'll be christ-like because it's christ in the man isn't that right so you say you better come before it's too late and buy amigo try on the fire and then you will truly be rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it we are going to take something with us what that something is all we can take with us nothing less nothing more so we have better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless laureation people it's up to each of us for in that day every man shall bear his own burden i want to repeat that one in that day every man shall bear his own burden oh praise the name of the lord wherefore coming from among them and be separate see at the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters here the lord almighty there is a price to pay for those garments and that and that is the price of separation and repeat that one there's a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of separation oh glory to god and anoint thy side with thyself that don't mind the sea he does not say that you have to buy this ice out oh no there is no price tag on the holy spirit receiving the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing of faith galatians 3 2. here we here we go now of the word without the baptism of the holy ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to god and his truth how we thank god for his presence this morning hallelujah and i want to read the scripture and there's some revelation chapter four uh verse one and as i and this after this i looked and behold a door was up in heaven and the first voice which i heard was a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither i will show thee which must be a rafter and you know the prophet typed this as the bride the rapture and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne he was sat and was looked upon like a jasper and a sad iron stone and there was a rainbow wrong about a throne in the sight like unto an emerald i run about a throne were 420 seats upon the seats i saw 420 elders sitting clothed in white rain meant and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and this is the verse you want to get to now and before the throne there was a sea of glass like onto a crystal and in the midst of the throne wronged above the throne there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and here's the prophet now interpreting this sea of glass where the sacrifice is washed that's what that sea of glass represent that we are washed don't forget that he said wash by the water of the word then you have got to hear the word before you can enter there because only one way you can approach it and that's by faith and faith come by hearing the word so hearing the word is more than just hearing the word hearing the word is to produce a fate that you could go further oh praise god all things of god is of faith isn't that right washing your conscience not to meet a man not to meet father not to meet mother not to meet a baby he said no watch but the first thing we got to come is god's avenue of approach will be washed when we hear the word of god so every service you hear in the world you're being washed your mind being washed hallelujah you get mixed up with all kind of things out there but you get the word this morning and it washes you it cleans you cleanse your conscience your heart your mind isn't that right by faith we are walking grace god what god did for you that's right you believe god you believe on god as soon as you are sorry you already forgive him oh glory to god soon as you're sorry for what you do you're already forgiven isn't that right as i was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of get a little mixed up on it i said look brother if you said something to hurt your wife's feelings immediately you feel sorry for her you're sorry you did it you already repented in your heart that's right but you've got to go and tell her about it you've got to go and say honey i'm sorry i said that then you have totally repented now that's the way it is with god a man that go and say i hurt your feelings don't make any difference i tell i'm sorry but i'm not you're a hypocrite see that's right you will never be received by god you have got to thoroughly be sorry for your sins then when you know that you're sorry for your sins then repentance and baptism baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins you shall receive forgiveness and receive the holy ghost it is that simple god make it simple notice here this sea of glass is like unto crystal and the sea of glass is symbolized by the brassy this is a glassy and mo in heaven and moses brought made a brazen altar because god told moses what you see in heaven make a reflection on the earth and revelation the book of symbols so all these symbols in the book of revelation is a reflection of god's plan intent and purpose he hides it in symbols isn't that right he said you know what brah speaks of judgment he made a brass serpent a serpent means sin already judged isn't that right no we are the lava and you notice this lava was empty and was clear as christian why because the church has already been redeemed now we learn later on that's the scripture we read which is revelation 15 that he called him the tribulation saints in the 15th chapter and any quote in the scripture we read i saw another angel i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven inches having the seven last plagues for in them is filled the wrath of god and i saw a sea of glass mingled with fire now watch they have gotten the victory over the beast over his image over the map over the number of his name and stood on the sea of glass having the harps of god he said notice tribulation period so these are the saints tribulation saints they overcome the beast they overcome his name they overcome this number but they're still in the tribulation oh glory to god they should overcome self they can overcome and get the holy ghost oh glory to god hallelujah praise god you say watch we have got to come this gentile church into this word sea of glass water water of the word and recognize the word the way it is written then the sacrifice is received and filled with the holy ghost from the inside shining through the light of that age from here it goes out to the holy place into the star you get it now notice at the end of the age when he saw the sea of brass clay of crystal that's revelation chapter four it was clear as crystal the word had been taken from the earth raptured it was clear as crystal that's it what's the representation the rapture clears crystal no more blood the churches was over now in revelation 15. here we go the remnant of the woman's seed that's the foolish villages now that's the church people in this message that is those who don't receive the atonement in his fullness that is those who reject the cat path the head path of the capstone oh glory to god the head part of this message reject it hallelujah that is where all them but i'm talking about the holy spirit said many true ministers shall misunderstand that prophet that's all that inside of there too oh glory to god god has sent a prophet for us to misunderstand him but he has sent a prophet for us to get clarity of vision and purpose that we could hit the target oh glory to god hallelujah and in revelation 15 the remnant of the woman's seed which was the tribulation saints that went through the tribulation was found standing on the sea it was filled with fire blood red blazing licking forth the fire of god they have gotten the victory over the beast's room over his number over the letter of his name over his image the confederation of churches but had come out and through the preaching of moses and elijah those two prophets that will appear to israel to pull out their group then the tribulation since back then that time was brought in the church is done raptured now but remember the wife is on the throne the tribulation period now these tribulations spirit saints that come up that went through great tribulations the church will not go to the tribulation don't they already in glory here is the tribulation saints the sanctified one and then he said it being mine and your fault that they never heard the word they never heard it and rejected it if they rejected it they went on to hell they was cast into outer darkness because they rejected the word but if they never heard it god the tribulation period comes to them so there are people that i hear the word people that will be saved give me eternal life right your own judgment but tribulation hallelujah there are those who know they have to get the holy ghost they know they have to press on to god and they just ignore it they prefer to listen and read and understand and they'll seek the lord as what's required of us to ask god to fill with the holy ghost he get the holy ghost to them that ask him isn't that right notice now these saints washed by the same word because it's the same altar it's the same sea of glass it's the same word you know those remind me of all israel heard moses heard the message but they didn't mix the word with fate so it did not profit them they have books they have tapes but it's not inspired and that's why you have to come and get in the spirit even if you're sitting at home you can't say it's not full you have to sit in a way and you're hearing in a way that god could speak to you that you could receive from your father isn't that right now we we never took the word to them that's a reason we never took the word to them we are going to be held responsible so we we will not be able to catch all the peoples the church that's got the truth because they've got to go through the tribulation they're not the same that died back down there in the church ages they come up out of the great tribulation but the great tribulation is yet future after the church goes home so friends it's not just coming to church i'm going back home right there's a great tribulation that is coming for the escape and then they are the elected they are going to be the escape ones oh hallelujah so it's not good to say having victory over the beast over rome over the mark over the confederation of churches and they will press us out and we are standing for them or we are taking them back and have no power to go to rapture waste them time you'll be end up at tribulation saints you understand i'm saying because these tribulation saints had the victory over the beast had the victory over his mark the victory over his name is not right over the confederation of churches but they still make it to the rapture or give the lord a shout in the house oh here we go now and there's some 10 versions there's something beautiful doing these two changes there are two spirits working almost alike right down through here one is the nomination the other one is the holy ghost and jesus said these two spirits were deceived would be so close that they see the very elective possible these two spirits here we go american their people for future judgment let me say that again there are two spirits at work one is the holy ghost and i ain't talking about pentecostal and denomination i talk about people in the message one is the holy ghost and one is denominational spirits in the message that binding the people from the holy ghost just two because the message supposed to be a channel of the holy ghost because the seven angels come from eternity to gather the scattered word and tie it back in the word to bring down the holy ghost and holies couldn't couldn't flow just like that because they were going to bring us back to pentecostalism so the holy ghost disguise itself as the word on books and tapes to break a platform that the secret could be the word is in the pride and then that word turn to spirit and power and produces the kingdom is within you then you by revelation no it's not to go here have it and here have it and this minister have it and this one don't have it and you know this for sure this might just have it that's all that is nonsense then you gonna recognize that the word the secret is under the nose of the devil the word is in the bride hallelujah you have to have that first before you see any miracle you have to have faith in that first before you see the rainfall you have to believe that word is in you you have to receive that word the fullness of the atonement every promise god could drop on you you could receive it thunder's new name seven seals anything that got adoption character trials testing perfect faith hallelujah any promise god jump on you you could take a hold of it it is minds it is minds it is minds this happens it is still minds oh glory that happened it is still yours oh holly do you believe that so the two spirits are mocking their people for future judgment mark it now and i see this morning the judgment is set oh hallelujah god can't cancel it he can't reverse it oh god your name is not being written god is not feeling inspired this morning to put your name down in the book he put your name before the foundational world that before they get married before you had children before your sin before he was even born your name was in the lamb's book of life and you have to find you wherever you are in whatever condition you win to bring you out not to stay where you are but to bring you or do you believe that these two spirits are marking their people for future judgment put them mark upon them that sigh and cry hallelujah they will be sealed put them back upon those that reject it they will be they will be judged oh hallelujah so marking going on right now oh glory to god hallelujah praise god seal that faith in your soul seal that revelation that god put inside of you isn't that right thank you lord jesus now watch he says he said uh america doesn't want the gospel you know that we just might as well admit it this anglo-saxon people let me read it again you say america doesn't want the gospel you know that we might as just well admit it that this anglo-saxon people it is finished that's all there's no more gospel that america will receive you've got a few strugglings now and then just the gospel it is over you can't even preach to them you can't talk to them they won't believe nothing they got their own hard-headed ideas they are set the next thing for this nation is judgment she's going to have it too it may come true depression it may come to an atomic bomb it may be true a great plague a disease or something but she is ready it is coming thousands time thousands will fall oh glory to god that's out of the mouth of a prophet oh glory to god thousands times thousands gonna fall he says there's no more gospel he said right he said it may come true a great plague a disease or something but she is ready it is coming thousands times thousands will fall oh hallelujah you ask them they say we got television that's how we find comfort that's the american attitude we got television we got plenty of money we got fine cars we got nice home what do we need with the lord we don't need that that's the attitude and the only religion and salvation we have and love is amongst the real godly people you know the bible said that what happened the love will be so far away in the last days that the only love that will be left would be among the elect of god's people not church you know the elect hallelujah the father will be against mother mother against father children against parents different ones against each other and the only love will be left will be among the elect just the elect the wording let comes a word elected god's elected people all glory of god i feel like shouting right now so god elected people will have love it will take love to enter dear the elected have to have love not the church members the issues members have like but the elect to have love oh glory to god like who you want to like hallelujah but you say you have to love your enemies that's a different thing god don't know what liking you're talking about having love it take perfect love to enter dear oh praise god do we love him this morning he finished his work on earth he took his church he sends the judgment the world rejecting him and he sends his judgment he and the church has gone to glory oh hallelujah and john on the isle of patmos was the type of the church being lifted up into glory come up hither you say he represented the church to everyone that hears this word john represented him hallelujah glory feel like joking on that one to everyone that hear this word john represented him including revelation 10 8-11 i said to john the angel said go to the angel and take the book eat the book thom was prophesy again john was representing you and i he was representing the bride not one man inside of there prophesying not one man inside out there going to the angel not one man inside of there taking the book that doesn't work so hallelujah john represent the pride

something inside of you to hear dusty of the lord oh give him a shout wherever you and your house hallelujah praise god everyone that hears this word john represented him john was the representative of the blood of jesus christ the testimony of the world he was a witness of the baptism of the holy ghost with a personal fellowship with christ and he represent the entire church that every man woman boy or girl that ever received christ accept him on the same ground he'll be summoned someday come up hither and be caught up before the tribulation remember the tribulation time hasn't set in yet oh glory to god remember that it hasn't set in here oh pressure coming the weeds are going to turn you know we've seen a forties right now oh a special accelerates around the world this is the time setting up the judgment john was being showed how and what was going to take place after the church age oh glory to god and he said the holy spirit has been born by these nomination rivers for almost two thousand years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the event i message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time there are three stages of it the matter age hallelujah the reformers are now the calling out time oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god what is that revelation 10 according to laodicea revelation 10 the bride being called out isn't that right called by the word christ calling out that bride oh do you believe that praise god and the jews as they be called out hallelujah by the trumpet isn't that right praise god so but abraham says now it may almost pass feeling time because there will come a time like that when the spirit of god will be taken from the earth there will be no more the church will be remain a while preaching god just has to preach to the eternal laws if the spirit is off the earth where is the spirit then the spirit will be in the bride and the spirit and the bride could speak in mount zion will be deliverance and salvation that will be a space of grace to your family to your loved ones because the spirit will be bride resident resident in the bride oh glory to god hallelujah not the judgment already set nobody could change it you can't plea and change it you gotta cry and change it you cannot fast and change it is said the judgment those answers is set the judgment to america is set the judgment to the world is set people carry on because it doesn't seem the judgment made manifest but revelation 15 oh glory to god hallelujah what does it say here for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest in another way the bible talk about the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full so while they're carrying out with their foolishness thinking that god in his head thinking that god gordon butter with them he's waiting for the cup to be full and then he could pour the rat upon them oh glory to god saddam wasn't like that overnight suddenly was that for a long time and he heard the cries of the people you want to come down to investigate who really want deliverance who will he want to break through who fed up a deadness and coldness praise god and men who have no vision hallelujah and those who prophesy lies hallelujah praise god who want to get out of bondage who want to be free even the voice drop down come out of her my people oh glory to god babylon hallelujah come out of the motherhood come out of a daughter spirit come out of organization come on come on come out a voice oh glory to god no wonder there's a time

you have to come into christ and no man can't put you inside a deal all glory to god is by one spirit you are baptized into the holy ghost on fire oh hallelujah the church will remain a while preaching because it has to preach to eternal loss just like every ministry coming down there will be a ministry that will preach the people that cannot be saved cannot be saved and they have to hear it whether they come in the church building or hear it across the internet but they're going to still hear it oh glory to god i can imagine no one preaching for 120 years nobody wanted by the way noah no like a half crank he preached and it would rain there's no evidence there's no proof he's moving by revelation inspiration but you see his adam his building is going according to vision and constructing his action and tell them this man have to know where you're gonna join from how we know we're doing hallelujah it floored them glory to god when he got and used by somewhere to build the uh they say oh daddy kind of would he use in there oh i might have no revelation none if either rain was coming that would that would go sink because i would pour us that that is at that stage that is at that time you see there's a time for everything glory to god the school children are five years in school secondary school when that time is up his time is up are they catch you with subjects or no subjects and then you recognize if you waste your time or not we don't have all the time there's a time to burn our time to die we are moving with time space season hour oh glory to god so when people laugh at the balsam wood because porous when they saw the seal the the ceiling and seal it out to make it waterproof they couldn't laugh no more because they recognized it still unfolding oh glory to god that is why there's a time of lingering because things are still unfolding hallelujah god's stretching the time and cutting this one off taking this one off knocking this one off pushing this one off he is stretching it because more things have to unfold and many times people not catering for this thing called time or glory to god but when the seventy was broke there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour oh glory to god god loses space in heaven and while that space is being hallelujah placed in heaven there is something taking place on the earth or give the lord a shout the seventh seal is still being unfolded oh give the lord a shout hallelujah it is still being unfolded this morning oh hallelujah at the beginning the silence oh glory to god but to continue on on and on and on then it's at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be all the way up there all the way up there in that stature oh hallelujah still unfolding oh thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so god going to give your grace in this peace in this time of lingering go and go give grace to the elect grace in your trials grace promise your tears i miss your fears i miss your dunk your dream downtrodden and beaten and battered and you don't know you don't understand he gave it more grace when the burden go greater he sended more grace when the labor increase oh harlan's added afflictions he added more mercy to multiply trials he's multiply please oh what a song hallelujah his love knows no limit his grace knows knows no measure hallelujah his powers knows no boundary knows unto man for all of his infinite riches in jesus he give it and give it and give it more grace may god bless you with grace this morning grace to repent oh grace ask your pardon grace to ask for his presence oh glory to god when you don't reign wrong and when oh for the god will help you this morning help you in the home i'm not seeing you but you and your home you know what's going on in your heart in your life the pastor don't know the ministers don't know they come to see you in church you're balling him in your ball hallelujah you stand up you shout you say amen but you know what's rocking inside your soul you know the earthquakes in your system you know the tectonic movements and the shaking within you you know when you have your sleepless night hallelujah and you cry and nobody hear you cry you cry oh glory to god only knows he knows what you're going through may god release peace you say my peace i give unto you may god release peace to your spirit this morning hallelujah oh thank you jesus and the prophet in christ the mystery is talking about what are the purpose and his hidden ministry mystery and that's why i want to talk about the church this morning god great hidden mystery hallelujah his great his in secret he didn't know about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason here we go under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen oh glory to god it opened up yet to the sun it is silent when i'm coming oh glory give the lord some praises oh that silence connected with his coming he's coming connected with that stone caught up with all the hands of man his coming is connected and where the bride reached the top oh glory to god hallelujah you understand that he's not coming for you in the valley you have to you have to climb up the hmong pyramid that helicopter that that's that flying saucer i have to meet you on top of the mountain oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god that's where the rendezvous is hallelujah where the meeting place is at are you ready there's flying saucer coming to pick you up you have to be on top of the mountain oh glory to god the flying saucers ain't coming down on the valley you have to be on the mountain he said this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture not this sermon the man preached this being oh glory to god what being fate virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness bradley kindness charity that formed in you is what go in oh hallelujah not your body is what inside of you god putting that magnetism inside of you does he make this isn't he coming for oh glory to god he's okay what kind of skin is wrong with it could be chinese skin red skin white skin black skin it doesn't matter what skin beyond that covering it is the treasure is it earthen vessels the the vessels is not important the color of the hair not important the color texture or race or country that's not important is what's in there are the treasure have to be in earthen vessels goddess and a prophet to america he said behold i sent him to the world elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts he has done it your glory to god he put it in books and tapes that way he can see it is leading the messages hallelujah because every prophecy has to come from that prophet who gave the lord a shout so a man can't claim to take the book and eat the book and say something different what the prophecy he's a liar he's a false prophet he's a false messenger he's a false minister if you eat the book you could only speak the words from the book that's why he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing i challenge any man the same different from what the book say i don't want no explanation give me a revelation what has already been said identified back in the scripture you see all the international preachers out there they don't push by them it's motivation teaching all kind of crazy stuff what kind of weird nonsense vision false prophecy all meeting in general meeting this all kind of foolishness we can come here this last day and have that nonsense and go by your imagination you had a dream last night why are you with your dream last night bring it to the word bring your dream to the word bring your revelation to the word bring your diss and your ex bring it to the word let's let's see and check it out by the word oh there's a word bride you know oh hallelujah have to be in the word has to be in the scripture oh glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah so god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was forbidden to write it the coming of the lord that is one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't what abraham you are shown to revive it in every type in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ one goal he wanted to achieve on the bible the believers in the bible has been in tight expressing what god great goal is and now in the last days he has revealed it and he shows it now remember this this seven seal seventh seal is the end of time of all things the things written in the seven seals books sealed up of the plan of redemption before the foundation of the world it every it every bit ends it is the end so once the seven seal breaks the end is loosed how many sees that this morning don't study that this is 1963 now don't study that a thousand years is one day a thousand years is as one day with the lord half a day is 500 years i wouldn't go wrong there in that mathematics but what i mean to say 50 60 years is a short time so when god about to do his thing he break it and walk away it started to unfold now nothing could stop it the kingdom is about to be restored satan is about to be repo the deposed he about to be kicked out laker fire that's his destination the saints already on their way to the rapture it was so convinced in his eyes i believe the bride is called she is sealed into the kingdom of god oh glory he already see you sealed into the kingdom nobody can pull you out of that kingdom when god sealed you into the kingdom no man could put you there no book could put you there it takes god himself to do that so the seventh seal is the end watch is the end is the end of the struggling world is the end of struggle in nature is the end of everything is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vials is the end of the earth it even ends time because the angel said time shall be no more time itself runs out with this seventh seal so we are kicking and we are moving on something so temporary time is running out time is runs on you to do what god called you to do do you know what god called you to do or you're wasting time oh hallelujah he said everything runs out in this time the at the end of this seventh seal it is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it even the ends it evens the austrian of the millennium that's on the seventh seal and then you compare what it is it's like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here it goes up and explodes again they put on five stars and one of those stars explode and blow the fiesta from it and then this one of them explodes another five stars so each one just exploding exploding and then keep going exploding exploding you can't stop it hallelujah that's what's the seventh seal it just ends the time for the world it's in the time for this the time for that isn't the time for this it ends it ends the time everything just ended up in that seventh sea notice the breaking of the sea was so great that heaven was hushed by it silence for this piece of allah it was so great now half an hour might not be long if you're having a good time but in suspense between death and life it seemed like a millennium was so great jesus never mentioned it none of the rest that then did you know he was forbidden to write it and the four and twenty elders stood before god harp they quit playing their harps the angels hushed their singing they think the holy cherubims and seraphims the desire saw it in the temple and two wings over their face and over their feet and flying singing holy holy lord god almighty even when they walked in coming to the temple the post was moved and they hushed angels quit singing the flying angels the presence of god singing holy holy they shut no altar service no nothing there was silence deadly silence for half an hour all the hosts of heaven was silent for this half an hour when this seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption broke open it wasn't broke open manifestation you know just the book itself broke open it was silent hallelujah and when it broke open it has to be loosed and be unfolded that's why we need time go glory to god hallelujah to have a bright age you have to have a history you have to have a sign you have to have a voice you have to have a word you have to have a praise got a message oh glory to god every age had a messenger oh glory to god and the messenger of this age here is the chief messenger he is the head of them all among the messengers that's why the mighty angel was christ himself and seven thunders throw their voices out that's the husband talking to the bride oh glory to god christ your husband come down in revelation 10. oh glory to god first thessalonians 4 the lord himself descends from heaven with a shout to get that bride out or is not no man come for you is god come for you or give the lord a shout they say the word from no man it's the word from the lord hallelujah so christ is on the earth no six in things around the angel of the lord the holy spirit on the earth fixing things are wrong setting things up for his coming oh glory to god and before you come you have to appear oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord he said watch uh he said and the host of heaven was silent for this half an hour when the seven sea mystery of the book redemption was broke open but think of it it broke the lambs

hallelujah thank you oh my oh god i hope he's here tonight for every sinner the lamb being slain how can you oversee anything but that bloody lamb standing there and the lamb proceeded out of the vision no father's throne oh would it not be glorious thing if our sinful torch tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would advance all the way from glory to night to make himself known to any of you the lamb advancing from glory to make claims about the redemption remember he had been on his military work back there but remember oh boy these seals are ready to be opened and the lamb come from the sanctuary and advance forward and then he dropped this in wait till we get over there that one hour that one half hour that's silent this sanctuary is smoking there is no more intercession the sacrifice has left it's a judgment seat oh glory to god do you get that wait till we get over to that half an hour of silence the sanctuary is now smoking now guess what it was always a judgment seat it's only the blood on it make it a mercy seat oh glory to god the blood on it release salvation to you and i the blood of it produce redemption for you and i the blood produced forgiveness for you and i when the lamb step forward oh glory to god and that blood is removed it's no longer a mercy seat it's a judgment seat lightning thunder's voices that same seed that once give out mercy and grace that seat is now giving out judgment dies like a flame of fire fetus brass oh glory to god same jesus that savior same jesus come to judge you oh glory to god he's not a man we're dealing with to excuse you and say as is you and pastor oh glory to god god didn't say the wise virgins oh the foolish virgins i know he's a virgin he's a clean woman and so on all right come in no it's not virgin it's oil or give the lord a shout in the house when god set a requirement if we got to meet that requirement if god said oil is all he's talking about he's not talking about virgin he's talking about wise virgin wise enough to get the revelation to get the oil to get the holy ghost to press on in god that's what wisdom is all about the wisdom of revelation to possess your mountain and the claim the holy ghost oh my hallelujah no more intercession the sacrifice has left it's a judgment seat there's no blood in it no more for the blood-covered lamb has walked away don't you wait till that time remember the old testament as long as blood was off the mercy seat it was judgment as long as blood was dead there was mercy but ram knocked the pulpit five times but when the lamb walked out that did it what he was he was being an intercessor oh glory to god then the voice said don't weep john here come the lion he was the one that prevailed oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god and when the angel was going to stand there you wait till we get to the seals and time shall be no more that's right that half an hour silence watch what take place that half an hour of silence when the seven seal next sunday night you say he comes forth to take his claims now he comes forward to take his claims no he had done the kinsmen work he had come down and become man and died he done the kinsman worker redemption but had not yet called for his claim and now he comes on the scene to claim his rights now watch what take place oh my for which he had seen for us becoming a killman to man to die in his place to redeem him but the elder was right when he said he was a lion see the elder called him a lion because he had been a lamb as an intercessor a bloody lamb but now he is coming as a lion his days of intercession is over so when it switches off from the lamb anointing to the lion anointing it is judgment oh glory to god hallelujah when jesus went in the temple under the anointing of the holy ghost after overcoming lucifer hallelu in the wilderness he said the spirit is upon me for he hath anointed me oh to bring the good titans and he ran from isaiah 61. he stopped in the middle of the sentence to bring a year of jubilee and he stopped right there to leave the bride to declare the day of vengeance of our god hallelujah man can't do that if man do that man don't like me he's speaking out of existence he judged me he said we want to say man cannot do that it has to be the pillar fire veiled in the sons of god in the last days and there's a prophecy that the pillar of fire will be veiled in the adopted sons in the last days oh gloria not man the pillar of fire same pillow fire that knocked down paul same pillar fire that hangover brother branham same pillar fire that was in the old testament will be veiled in the sons of god just like the pillar of fire was veiled in peter and say you lied to the holy ghost it was judgmental over again or give the lord a shout they didn't lie to peter they lied to god because god was failed oh hallelujah and one day that pride will say come to the unfailing of the mighty god that god will be unveiled one more once more the world will hear direct from god god will speak god have a voice oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god god will speak god have a voice i'm not talking about the prophet voice i'm not talking about that i talk about the voice and the pride he said god will give the bride a voice that he's not playing a tape give the bride a voice and the spirit and the pride will say come revelation 20 70 is our scripture to take up that scripture to go into the temple this spirit is upon me judgment is set oh hallelujah i don't think the people get that i feel they're going in the human spirit believe in the message long time wearing long dress kind of grey-headed hallelujah don't understand got a requirement goliath was already defeated garage was dead before even started israel didn't know how to attack that oh hallelujah get goliath challenging them every day and night when david come david was on the back of the book he was he hit the seventh seal he had experience already being lying so he was ready for the third step he was ready for his stupid ministry he was saved saving stays of his ministry he not even knowing god loosened him into a situation that he didn't control the situation he he didn't make the situation god arranged it hallelujah his father hallelujah sat something that he didn't know was going to unfold he said take these things to your brother david didn't know what was going to happen he just come with innocence come with a pure heart to bring kingfish brothers his brother cycle humiliate him hallelujah holly bret message brethren trying to humiliate him brethren trying to humiliate him he's just come to do a blessing to them but he's trying to make him small he's all right i'm going back and that's when goliath stepped forward oh glory to god the clock was counting down on the lion his time was running out and he didn't even know it oh glory to god power was upon david the anointing was upon david thought glory to god he said who is that uncircumcised philistines oh glory to god and i'm telling you there'll come a bride that david hallelujah even christ will come upon a bride to challenge all these uncircumcised goliath that walking back and forth with their intellectualism in this message oh they will be defeated already defeated because when the spirit comes oh glory to god everything will change after that when the dynamic strike the mechanics oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah so when the lamb stepped forward and leave the throne room smoking blood off the mercy seat and then the prophet dropped this year his intercession days is over let him that is filled to be filthy still let him know that his righteousness be righteous still let him with holy holy still you can't change after that hallelujah you can't change after that it's like you get sick you like however you are and you cannot change the freeze i say judgment is set the picture is set the bride is the bride the shark is the church the church of the church or the elect is the elect nothing going to change that oh glory to god the spirit and the bride say come your loved ones that space of grace come and forget them oh give the lord some praises there's a real message oh there's another game thing hallelujah this is the truth oh my hallelujah thank you lord man hallelujah what god gave us now a time of lingering this time are lingering several things are supposed to happen this is the time of the revelation of these things being made known hallelujah revelation of the seven thunders together right together show how to prepare give up fate seventeen will be in the broad revival right and time the of lingering wait till them seven thunders after their voices to that group you see nothing yet people talking mountain sharing seeing what they want to see man claiming what can i think but wait kill them seven thunders utter their voices don't worry nobody either boasts about it or speak for itself because it will be a manifestation the time of lingering brings out who is who hallelujah let me say it again the time of lingering brings out who is who the time of lingering brings out who is who is a filtering because the shout message of seventh season seven thunders call all three kind of believers and three kind of ministers hallelujah unbeliever make believer and true believer hallelujah then have those true ministers and false ministers and many true ministers will misunderstand a prophet and miss it the true mr national who misunderstand that prophet because of misunderstanding that prophet must division he brought the prophet edges book bring books and tapes he brought a prophetic vision for the bride the vision is what puts it right yes that's why a man could have money and no vision he go nowhere with his money a man could have vision and no money and the vision produces money to fulfill the vision because the vision is a big vision vision is more important than you think the bible says without a vision my people perish without a vision write division and make it plain how do you get a vision a vision of your life a vision for your family a vision for your business your church a vision it puts you in the helicopter position to see the overall picture you're above the condition you're not yet in the details of it but the vision shows you where you're going the vision is going to give you courage because you're reaching but you know where you're heading you have a vision sometimes the vision is sealed it's sealed in you because you don't want anybody to mess up your vision you tell your vision to the wrong people there's messier sometimes you have to keep them all shut and keep silent until the vision begin to unfold hallelujah that's why some companies guide their secrets up to normal thing anger sure nobody knows how they make those bitters they won't have this pack no one have that part one have that part and nobody know how to put it together well that same god of secrets does do like that too he put a part here he put abraham here faith here jacob here oh glory to god joseph here he put a path here you have it all puzzle up jumble up he put silence here devil looking here you see nothing oh glory to god he put something here put a symbol here he put you here the devil clueless oh glory to god because he's hiding the mystery and christ is the mystery abraham faith isaac love jacob grace jordan perfection and he's building the body work and he's been john the baptist had the neck pack but jesus is the head cap of the old testament become the cornerstone of the new testament hallelujah and rama church back there alpha church and ephesians church and seven ages began to unfold the devil merchant of the place i think he's mashing the place but hurt not the oil and the wine oh give the lord a shout on your last days you see laodicea they ever read in the bible he said laurissa but he have a clueless about the bright age but a seventh seal open up a bright edge and put you in it or give the lord a shout hallelujah put you in a bright edge deserve as clueless about this is because it is come from under the seventh seal [Music] glory to god that holy spirit shut between brotherly kindness and love the capstone that spirit slot and be inside of there oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god thank you lord jesus this time a time to filter out from the shout to the voice brahms i wish i had the voice of that angel to bring it to a place where you can see it a time when this prophetic vision could be made clear and that's why the prophet said i'm only laying these seeds i hope these men bring it to life not not lay back more seeds again we have these seeds i'm not preaching my seeds i do have a message i preach in another man's message i don't have my own message i preaching a message that was sent from god that is what my authority is with this here hallelujah and i am hoping that it come to life i'm pushing for this service today to be a special service i'm looking for the outpouring of the holy ghost to come upon here and in your homes i'm looking for the spirit to fall upon you today not next week today oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord glory to god habakkuk two i will stand upon my watch and see how the tower and see watch to see what he will see unto me when i shall answer when i reprove and the lord answered me and said write the vision that means bring the vision into written that you could read it hallelujah write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that resident oh my hallelujah thank you lord you'll see what it's called virus will produce all them businesses without an online presence they find itself in hot waters because they they're not visible no more because people can't reach them so everybody has to jump on online they'll say i am here i ain't come out of existence i disappear i am here oh glory forced them into action if they had a vision they wasn't being online long before but the vision was not there they didn't see the need for it but the conditional wrong forces the need oh glory to god the foolish virgin didn't see the need to press on for extra oil they they were content to be in the message they were content to have lamps they were content with their pastors and the churches they were content with that but they was not fighting and present for the extra oil the wise virgin saw the need for that because the midnight cries coming hallelujah they cry coming at midnight it's coming on us oh and you think not oh glory to god and the voice said go yo to meet him that is when you have to scramble that is when you have to know what you have that is when you have to know that you know that you know that you know that you know and if you don't know what to know just messed up oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god and the lord answered me write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that reason for the vision hallelujah it's yet for an appointed time hallelujah and at the end it shall speak and not lie do it tarry wait for it oh glorious shanghai it will surely come oh thank you lord job said i will wait till my change come that must be our testimony wait till your change comes oh glory to god hallelujah men who run the head always causes

and see i have heard of thee by the hang of the air for 50 plus years but now my eyes i'm seeing oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus but abraham calls it the process of character development waiting on god and waiting for god but abraham was born a prophet born and yet god commissioned him to do the work of evangelists until he was positionally placed by god after being tested and tried he became a vindicated son and malachi 4 said these seven virtues of faith virtue knowledge etc have to be proven to be in us then we are vindicated and placed it's a whole day any man came to be a fightful ministry without that proven test and vindication and being placed this is not taken by faith this is a manifested reality me talking about fight who by faith and potential fight foot and potential son of god i'll protect your manifestation if i die in the morning whatever manifests nothing i'm dead are gone i'm potentially nothing hallelujah no more potential you know peter couldn't come to man

arena once rain began to fall seed have to meet manifest oh my hallelujah oh glory to god there is no true bible fifo ministry outside the process that was laid on by the prophet william runner there are no shortcuts it's not fivefold according to ephesians 4 11 thy scripture is fivefold according to what was revealed by the prophet malachi though of ephesians 4 11 which is the ministry of jesus christ this time of lingering produces that space of grace even revelation 22 17. amen where our families will get through there oh my hallelujah praise god thank you jesus thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus exodus chapter 32 and when the people saw that moses the lead to come down out of the mountains you see moses run up down with him with the um with ten commandments the people was in nice behavior right is that time of lingering that exposed how convinced they were of the god that brought them out oh this god punished phil they saw plagues they saw flies they saw dead they saw the red sea open they saw the pillar fire went behind them and cut them off they saw all of that they saw they were oh let's see open up the walk on dry ground now they're on the mountain of god god put a delay god put time to deal with moses on the mountain exodus 32 1 and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered himself together on the air and said unto him make us gods which shall go before us for us for this moses the man that brought us out of the land of egypt we don't know what has become of him and aaron said unto them break off your golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and your daughters and bring them on to me you don't feel anointed now and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in the ears and brought them to aaron and they received them at the hand and fashioned it with a graven tool after he had made a molten calf and said these be thy gods or israel which brought thee out of the land of egypt you know how almighty god will feel about that after they saw power after they saw the display of moses a man of god moses lingering a delay a time and the bible talked about the time will come when ben will say the lord delay is coming and they're gonna be chopping one at up this minister fighting that one that one fight in that one district fight then that church you know what they're saying the lord delay his coming they lack the revelation the lord already sent it with a shout or give the lord a shout hallelujah they miss that part that the angels on the earth now fix and things are wrong oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god so you see what time does do that's why my rams talk about how he didn't want them to see the shortcut to the promised land so you get them a long way to give them a time of lingering to see what's in their heart because only time does unfold what's in people's heart you see the children real nights and so on every father dead with land and property and money and things you see all that like this is lisa who greets that they come and say my father live for me i want this and so on i want that taiwan that time brings that out all the time the nice brothers and sisters but now we have land they have houses have cars have money to have wealth to be divided all of us suddenly watching each other like with daggers hallelujah hallelujah praise god we are seeing nothing yet you know wait till god begin to manifest power wait wait wait the anointings are to flake off like sparks of an anvil yes yes yes we'll sell the glory the glory of god decide to cover the church and god the glory cover you wait wait till the anointing when you walk inside the house the glory back in our devils devils had to scream hallelujah walking the streets endeavors flaking off here jumping off here because the sun is coming paul i know peter i know oh glory to god the devil know who you are oh glory to god because you are off the spirits that rotated off of god that never fell never fail oh glory to god give the lord a shout hallelujah no wonder he said the bride will be a super church a super race as he near the headstone oh glory today and the bride will be his own image in his own likeness oh glory to god but the brandon was so much like jesus they thought he was jesus all glory to god instead of baptizing his name he said no brethren no no don't go there don't go there don't go there don't go there don't go there don't glorify me where is that in scripture going back in revelation when you once looked and felt he's eye on thy fellow servants of the prophet don't worship me worship god hallelujah the angel has shown them things the prophet was showing them the things he said don't worship me worship god is any man looking for some man worship heal how high and mighty and what not just foolishness i call it the parade of the beef the parade number six go go flatten that goddamn number six we had enough flesh for all these years after all these years think i i'm wearing some beef parade some kind of man head so high like you have a fruit you're pushing a big head oh hallelujah can't come with that no you have to come with christ when christ cover your soul your fellow is one dead when you go you hit the dust so you must come out humble you must come out lowly you must come out different altogether when mercies have got to us you think i want to hit the tribulation when i see they walk in the sea of glass mixed with fire oh glory to god tribulation saints oh hallelujah i'm pressing for the rapture brother and i want you to press faith too fight for it hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god and the prophet said in the second coming when that time comes when the church finds his brotherly love when they find his whole decency when they should find his place in christ he will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god want the church to love him i'm on the home stretch here now and i believe but abandoned now that all these things and they will get the inspiration from the text from the title from has a time of lingering waiting so it's not just i guess that up i just imagine that this is what he said you know i believe that all these things has a time of lingering waiting and it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled everything gets right everything in order waiting and many times we get impatient like a child create anticipations and many times jump way ahead and that hinders the work until the work gets caught up we must move hear how reverently have a purpose in the heart that god if he's with desire to use us in such such but wait till he makes the opening for he has to go ahead of us you see that's the matter with the pentecostal today they have to manufacture something they can't wait they just can't wait oh my they want to wait for christ would have to come to his church he promised to do it god promised to multiply them but they had to wait until god's time and that's the matter today they don't want to wait till god's time i want to say this now don't feel are you ready you say when christ comes to his bride who glory when christ come they're not texts there's no word there's that message when christ comes to his bride she will be a virgin like mary was for god will not bring christ through the womb of a and neither will he bring a bride he can't bring his word through the whole of his word so what is he talking about here now when christ come to the bride that's your husband that is the spirit when the spirit comes to the bride hallelujah she will be a virgin he is not going to bring the bride god will not bring christ to the womb of a prostitute a he's not going to do that so you have to be a virgin to the word but christ has to come to you to manifest who you are oh hallelujah moses was not vindicated or activated until he met the pillar of fire when he met the pillar of fire it brought the seed in him to life and then he was activated as anointed prophet to deliver the people out of the hands of egypt could you imagine he went along there with older anointed because you see them have a power and you can't have they have power and you don't have they will finish you with their power you have to have the power to challenge their power oh glory to god you have to have the power of god so that is why when they show down mistakes moses gets excited and run away he stand up right there because he know that power he has his greater his snake eat up his their own two words oh glory to god are you with me now remember it's not intellectual that fellows have you know janice and jambres is not intellectual people you know them not reading texts you know them dealing with spirits and lucy lucifer behind them so moses have to have god behind him because the battle continues the battle that begins in heaven continues on it oh every force every war is battles spirit the watch he said no the pentecostal he said no right now he said uh i warned right at this time now it just happened so it could identify its presence talk about people it just happened it just happened it just happened so it could identify its presence among you but will not be used in a great way until this console begins to tighten up and when it does he said the pentecostal could impersonate anything that can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze come down then you will see what you are seeing temporarily will be manifested in the fullness of its power see i must continue evangelism as i was commissioned i must continue on evangelism and friends of mine keep still just keep moving on for the awe is approaching swiftly when something is going to be done so don't worry don't try to bring the pressure on yourself no no don't try to do crazy stuff to bring attention and boil the press to the precipice the press say come here hallelujah the press coming to you to you to die yeah like the press coming the pressure coming on your personal life for you to have a revival in your own home in your own heart let's continue here now watch sin is a transgression of god's law by breaking one word tonight my brethren your soul is overheld on a chain and that chain is not some theological seminary teaching that chain is not some denomination or some creed that you're living by that chain is god's word and jesus gave the human race his word to live by and eve only broke one little link of it a chain is no stronger than his weakest link when you take one word out that was first in the book jesus came in the middle of the book he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word i proceeded of the word of god that was in the middle of the book the last of the book said whosoever shall take one word mistranslate one word take one word out of here i will take his part from the book of life you are passing over hell hanging on the word of god hear this word here now if you go get anything else get this don't you let somebody squeeze something into you that is not dusty at the lord so i must gamble with a minister and a prophet apostle a pastor evangelist i don't care how much faithfulness they are how much anointing they say they are if it's not the same lord go with it paul says if an angel comes from heaven preaching any other gospel let him be a curse oh my hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh glory to god hallelujah he said if you can just keep quiet remember if he call you for this there's nothing can keep you from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what god's word will make manifest you are born for a purpose and nobody could take your place you might have impersonators everything else but they could never take your place god's word will triumph it cannot fail there is very christian understand knowing that and trials will come and seems everywhere to you but remember god has a purpose it will work out right as that woman that should have my woman said all is well it will be well o praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus they want to take a shortcut to heaven as much as the world as they can take you can't take any of it there are no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you actually die you say oh god why can't i see it right you die literally die to yourself die to the things of the world and are born on you there are no shortcuts this woman she's part of the word the bride she's watching for her life to manifest the word he said can't you see brethren i hope that didn't go over you the body is waiting for which is the word is waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive that is what you're waiting for then he says 1914 the world went to war there had never been a peace since wow he said holding back what holding the greeting i saw in a vision the whole thing become to destruction holding the atomic holding the war so that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until israel returns back and gets itself together and then a message will go to israel and she will be sealed with that seed of the holy ghost not just mysteries revealed to israel you know but sealed with the holy ghost and if the israelites have to be sealed what about the bride how are we going without being sealed and if that man with the ink on right about the holy ghost why so is this same angel coming down with the holy ghost the seed of the living god then he quote ephesians 4 30 grievous the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the redemption he said we crack jokes but god will give and a kong for every idol what you speak because brother you are letting the devil come in and put it over your eyes the first thing you know here we go almost done the time will come when god will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out of the kingdom oh my god what does that have to do with joining a group or join a church or saying my past is your husband which is which which is not not even balanced what have that do with it a message come that jam you in the corner to seal you in or steal your world oh hallelujah there are five wise virgins who had all in their lambs rapturing fate believing all the signs and one is everything else and these five cut out of the remnant was taken away and the rest of them were still virgins they will not be lost but will go through the tribulation period almost finished here the seventh angel message seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals what for call in the 11th hour gentile workers what for to receive the same pay that the first hour received how much mysteries peter had how much revelations peter had but guess what we going back to what he had before we could leave here what did he have christ the mystery of god reveal tree bible zodiac pyramid and written bible you can't preach zodiac hallelujah you're a follower i'm saying god took the spirit took the prophet to show him the virtues and slam it into the pyramid and say there's a bible too and when you get this written word than you you get that permanent inside of you oh hallelujah that zodiac starts with a virgin virgo and with leo the lion coming in judgment that lion king now version 10. oh my the evening light messages to restore back again to bring back that same thing again national force but israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the work of the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride i'm done my part for today i want to put on right now by the brand i'm giving instructions about receiving the holy ghost on a message god healing simplicity that message is a message he preached in april and that was after the seals that's that wasn't the golden simplicity i was in uh uh albuquerque i think it was god hides them in simplicity given instructions or receiving the holy ghost but in paul all praising you of the lord who thank you lord and give and and obey and follow through with what each other if you say stand stand raise your hands worship god whatever he said just listen i didn't want to get the words on the screen i want to just get to you to hear it to listen and enter in in the spirit oh praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen reign it lord many hands went up here tonight many men and women lord god i pray that you'll bless them i pray that this very night will find the peace of god in each one of their hearts that they'll be so filled with your spirit that they'll have faith to perform miracles faith to live a godly life to live a life so sweet that when there spoke evil of they speak not back evil uh that they can return a kiss for a slap that they can return good for evil grant it lord make man to be humble make man to come to know you in the power of your resurrection may your death not be in vain to us in this generation we pray now that you'll raise up your church lord glorified and magnified send it home to glory we believe these things father make many here tonight who seek god to find him in this hour we asked it in jesus name and while we have our heads bowed i wonder now if you would want to make another step towards that if you would like to stand up and say i'm not ashamed though i belong to church i'm methodist baptist or pentecostal or whatever you may be i'm not ashamed i realize that i have trusted a whole lot what i know but never have i got to a place where i could fully believe the full gospel and to make it work in my life i've seen things i believe their promises i want to believe it but he told me if i did believe it this would work so there's something wrong with me it don't work i've tried to make it work but i don't do it and i'm ashamed of it and i want the world to know i want the people here to know that i'm sincere and i want it in my life i want to be a true witness for christ with the full gospel manifesting self running my life will you stand to your feet and say i want to be a witness i'm seeking god god bless you that's right jesus said if you're ashamed of me before man i'll be ashamed of you before the father now as these people it's pentecostal or methodist or baptist has these true things have you crossed that chasm until you know positive that you're standing in the presence of god a redeemed son and daughter of god and the signs and wonders not to make belief but the genuine article of god the holy spirit burns within you and what you say to this mountain it moves you believe that if it doesn't now's your time how do you know this my you said well i've stood before but if you're really hungry for god you'll keep on standing until it comes there's no end to it you're persistent like this year if you open woman she couldn't take no she wanted it really are you ready to stand anymore before we pray that beautiful song he was nailed to the cross for me on the cross crucified there he died for me i wanted brother branham i wanted god i really wanted my life i want to change i've lived a guest so i've lived i hope so and i want something i wanted if those apostles could hit that zero mark every time so can i that's what i say if it worked for the apostles it works now if it wants to happen it happens again if he is ever god he's still god he's the same yesterday and forever that's my campaign theme if your denomination don't believe in it let your denomination believe what they want to you believe the bible you believe it will you stand about eight or ten more stood up to him god bless you god bless you more standing more standing ah really sincere brother branham i want it something happened the other day you read the i heard the tape the seven thunders what time is it sir they it happened the other day you know these things the time is at hand church the time is at hand don't don't wait any longer see how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time first thing you know it'll be past one disappearing here and there it'll be gone the first thing you know and your judgment will strike the world you say well i thought this was too late now you remember they didn't know it until the day they entered into the ark and then it was too late the foolish virgin didn't know until she come back and found the wise virgin gone and she was left for the tribulation period no good teacher believes that the church the bride the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through for purification sure on the sixth seal right israel does the same thing for the 144 thousand but not the bride there's the bride's forgiven she goes straight to glory in the rapture ryan she's my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you would know nothing about him remember it's a secret secret catching away you know come an hour that you think now you won't know anything about it she'll be gone be too late man you said i wished i would have stood if you ever intended to make a stand let this meeting in albuquerque let this be the time that you made the stand now if you really feel secured by christ you feel that you have got the holy spirit and the blood of jesus christ all the signs and promises is at your command and you see them manifested and working in your life and you know their truth if you sit there like that and you believe it i'll take your word for it that's up to you if you don't you should be on your feet but if you believe that and know that those signs and wonders that jesus said vindication of the messiah speaks to him if it isn't then you should be on your feet [Music] god bless you i'm a stranger to many of you many of you has regarded me to be a seer i've said nothing about that you know that i've kept that's not the hour yet but you believe me now you believe me as god's servant have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what comes to pass if it's so say amen [Music] it's never failed by the thousands of things never one time by what it's been true you know that the world around though you disagree with me many in theology i'm not a theologian i only speak what i hear and then when i hear it i look at the bible if it ain't recording the bible i wouldn't receive it but not one time has it ever been contrary to the word but with the word that's reason it's confirmed god vindicates now you hear me then if you believe me to be a messenger sent from christ to you you believe me if you're not in the kingdom of god you better press right quick it will not get better it will grow worse all the time i just mark that down just remember see whether that's right or wrong you see if it's going to be right or wrong it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the revival is gone you're only gleaning in the fields she's over how you say i disagree with that fine it's okay if you do that's all right that's my conviction that's my hearing from heaven i believe the lady of seeing age is the pentecostal age where she comes to the place of lukewarm and god spews her from his mouth that's where she's come right now the pentecostal movement has come to that place lukewarm not red hot not ice cold you're not cold in farming near they are you're high you're in the spewing stage and you're going jesus the only age he stood on the outside of the church their dogmas that put him out knocking trying to get back in the door lol i stand at the door and knock if any man will hear my voice i'm glad you've heard tonight now i can only ask you to stand he's looking at you jesus said that wherever two or three are assembling my name there i am in the midst of them if that isn't so there's no god there's no bible there's no sunrise there's no sunset there's no flowers there's no tree you're really not here you're in a dream life is not real you're not a human being so it's impossible for that to be so it's impossible for him not to be here and if you'll ask anything in my name faith believing he'll grant it to you now that's you now you stood for a witness that you wanted now in your own way the way that you pray the way that you want to i want you to say lord god in your heart now don't pay attention the the the campaign here will give you plenty time for this all the time you want now in your own way in your own way i know it's customary that one man stands there and stands the other kneels down this way but whatever way you want to i don't care what it is don't say lord let me do this let me do that and say lord fill me fill me with the holy spirit i'm sincere in this i mean it now if you do mean it it's got to come it's impossible for not he promised him and he's trying to press into your heart the only thing you just opened a little bit and say come on the inside and stand here but don't go around fool my private life see he wants you he wants all you are he won't ever compartment your heart he wants your private life he wants all your life he wants to be your lord lord's ownership he wants to own you so he can guide you directly take you use you are you willing to do that if you are he's wanting to come in or you wouldn't be standing there see so now is the hour for you to receive it now it's up to you now if you believe with all your heart it'll be settled from right now this will be a memorial night they probably will close these doors tonight you'll stay all night in here but if you do like this say lord i'm standing on my feet until you feel me according to your promise i'll never move from where i'm standing you mean business with god he'll get to business with you but until you do you're hammering lord will you give me the holy ghost night i don't feel nothing well maybe i'll try tomorrow night you're not going to get anything from god like that you've got to come desperate die then you get it right he promised it if it isn't what do you use your time for if that promise is not true that's how these things happen that's why i can stand and say to the world has the word ever failed god promised me in fact there's a kid that's the reason you say aren't you afraid of failing i'm never i'm always a failure he never does i don't speak my words i speak his that's reason always right that's the reason i asked the world show me one time it didn't come to pass show me one time of the thousands of things that he said not one time did it fail then it never will because it's god not man so god is here now christ is in our midst he's willing to give you the holy ghost if you're willing to accept it not pay the price the price is already paid the price was prayed this paid this afternoon 1900 years ago if you're willing to accept it if you are let your heart go now open up take out all fear all down raise up your hands to god and say lord god here i am i stand here i stand in the name of jesus christ i'm going to pray for you you pray too lord jesus in the way of humility in the way of humbleness i offer you this congregation that's on their feet i offer to you because they have stood and respond to the call they're seeking deeper things they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creating power because in them is the holy ghost and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things comes to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes god in action and lord i pray that you'll send the holy ghost upon every one of them just now and deliver unto them lord in the power of the resurrection of christ the things that they are desiring in their heart a better life the baptism of the spirit lord may it be so that this audience will be illuminated the hearts of the people will see the vision and be filled with the power of god i command them to you lord in the name of jesus christ i just keep your hands up keep your head praying keep your heart filled just saying lord i believe [Applause] [Music] [Music] bring your

praying don't pay attention to the music just keep praying that's the trouble of today we listen to music we listen to one thing another we're supposed to be listening for the voice of god keep listening he promised that if he promised that he'll do it amen how many times have i seen the eyes of 20 and 30 000 people come open how many times have i seen they're in durban salvatore i've seen 25 000 outstanding miracles at one time people standing right like that so they took seven big band loads of crutches and wheelchairs from blanket natives who didn't know right hand from them stood right up there and accepted christ and walked away crippled by death done if it will do it for a black african what would it do for you who are supposed to be living in a time in a church in a place where the holy ghost is being manifested amen [Music] humble humble yourself lord i'm believing i don't know what i'm you're not there's something wrong there's nothing wrong with god god promises so help me i can stand right here and go down the eyelid i'll tell you everyone where you're at what you've done i say that in the name of the lord jesus you know that's true and i see you're afraid to turn yourself loose you're scared of something there's something wrong god don't make a promise and go back on it it's the truth right here if you want it it's up to you it's your death it's your

remember you are you are saved of course when you accept christ you're saved but you're not converted until you receive the holy ghost now you know that that's right jesus told peter the night of the betrayal he is already safe so now after you are converted strengthen your brother trying well sure you accepted christ as your savior but when you're converted it's when you're really changed that's right and he wasn't changed yet he cursed before the lord and denied him and everything but after his conversion after thou art converting strengthen your brother that's right is that right that's what the scripture says anyhow that makes it right jesus told peter that had followed him he cast out devils and done miracles and everything said you're not converted yet but if you're converted then strengthen your brethren it's true now why don't you how could you turn down such a an invitation is that it's for you i don't want to see you leave here without it brother we may never have another
