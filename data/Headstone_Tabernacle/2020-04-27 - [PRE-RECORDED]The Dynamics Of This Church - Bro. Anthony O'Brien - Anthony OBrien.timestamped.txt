[40:57] hallelujah okay so my title demand
[41:01] dynamics of this church isn't all right
[41:03] a man of my subject God reproduces
[41:05] himself now I was reading this quote
[41:08] here and I was saying that he said the
[41:11] big machine you've got all the mechanics
[41:13] see all the world system government
[41:15] system right
[41:16] it's mechanic just leaning me he said
[41:19] any only thing they have to do is to
[41:21] have Satan get in here in there with his
[41:24] dynamics to force the marking of the
[41:27] beast so it's like the wires already
[41:30] plugged in everything is hooked up and
[41:32] all they waiting on is this Luciferian
[41:36] satanic spirit to come into it and to
[41:40] empower it and enforce this system but
[41:44] the devil has had a long time to set up
[41:47] his Eden and he has done it marvelously
[41:49] there's technology there's convenience
[41:52] there's buildings his architecture is
[41:55] government system structures to second
[41:59] coffee why would you want to leave this
[42:01] earth there has to be a vision greater
[42:03] than this that your heart is longing for
[42:07] but your soul is crying out for all
[42:10] these pills and all this mortgage and
[42:13] all this mess there's got to be
[42:15] something more than this that we are
[42:17] looking at for city this morning
[42:20] whose builder and maker is caught I'm
[42:24] not satisfied we just come in a church
[42:26] no but have you received the Holy Ghost
[42:29] since you believed Oh have you received
[42:32] the spirit it's a pill of fire burning
[42:36] in your heart if not then come to the
[42:39] altar and
[42:40] see the baptism of the holy coat
[42:42] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen
[42:47] amen
[42:48] glory glory hallelujah so we see the
[42:54] endgame we see what God is pointing us
[42:56] to back to the spirit before there was
[42:59] were there was spirit and that Great
[43:01] Spirit anointing spoke and out of it
[43:04] came lobos word which had to go forth
[43:07] first before anything materialized so he
[43:10] said let there be and then like
[43:12] materialize but before like a come a
[43:15] word had to be spoken holily and that
[43:18] comes from the awesome praise God
[43:20] original Spirit of God now that spirit
[43:24] hallelujah it's trying to call you back
[43:26] to himself but the only way he could do
[43:29] it was to the word so you have to speak
[43:32] let let a lot here you come in 2019
[43:38] ojala little pick up your word to pick
[43:42] up your spirit to pick up your anointing
[43:44] for your tale to run the Devils out of
[43:47] your life to let the devil know whose
[43:50] side we are to finish a battle that was
[43:53] started in heaven hallelujah praise
[43:56] calling man hallelujah hallelujah Jesus
[44:05] came it's not
[44:07] he said Spirit of God is upon me because
[44:10] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[44:12] isn't that right but he stopped in the
[44:14] middle part to the day of vengeance have
[44:17] all gone that was not his part to bring
[44:20] yet he was gonna bring a bride one day
[44:22] to do that part please Bob I hear you
[44:25] coming his first coming
[44:26] isn't that right and he was anointed
[44:28] isn't that all right he healed the sick
[44:30] he raised the dead he cast out devils
[44:33] but look what happened when he died on
[44:35] Calvary you know what happened an
[44:38] instant transaction took place

[44:44] the prophets could not undo that the
[44:46] Kings could not
[44:47] - but the sages of their time could not
[44:49] - Moses went underground
[44:52] Joshua went in the ground Solomon went

[44:55] Oh hallelujah it was God's people but
[44:58] there was pound
[44:59] Oh holiday because there was no perfect
[45:01] sacrifice for sin but here came the
[45:03] sinless one he gave me all-powerful one
[45:06] he gave me omnipotent one and when he
[45:09] lay on the cross he said it is finished
[45:11] and the Bible said he gave up the ghost
[45:15] and when that happened when that happen

[50:26] modernist that has failed mankind still
[50:31] believed God in the core of the prophets
[50:34] in the core imposes in the core of
[50:36] Abraham and hello we still believe that
[50:40] God don't care what the devil throw in
[50:42] our face don't care much how much
[50:45] internet how much TV praise court it
[50:47] cannot distract us from what chord is
[50:50] got to unveil in our hearts and our

[51:43] - strength from fate the fate growing in
[51:46] God right under the devils nose oh and
[51:49] he won't be able to do a thing about it
[51:51] because he's 6,000 years too late he
[51:54] took the book he took the keys right now
[51:58] this morning Jesus holds the keys of
[52:00] death and hell he's got the key to your
[52:03] purpose he has the key to your destiny

[52:13] key this morning all you've got to have
[52:15] a speech what sense the promises of God
[52:19] the access the keymaster and he could
[52:21] turn that key this morning Mary had a
[52:24] key one time she said I know hallelujah
[52:28] that Lazarus is dead four days old but
[52:30] even now you can still do something even

[53:40] without spot wrinkle washed in the blood
[53:47] that's what he died for oh my hey I'm
[53:53] still trying to read this quote here I'm
[53:56] taking my time this morning is that okay
[53:58] all right he said no when she's forced
[54:01] down then the dynamics is working so the
[54:05] dynamics is a working pump that comes
[54:08] upon the mechanics that comes upon the
[54:11] material parts it's nice to make the
[54:14] gears turn to make the pulse move to
[54:17] make the thing push up and down it's a
[54:19] dynamic that is working that's a dynamic
[54:21] power that is turning isn't all right
[54:24] the Prophet said the mechanics is there
[54:26] he said they've already got them will
[54:29] system and he said now let me say
[54:31] something too he said this u19 time to
[54:34] see churches uniting nations uniting he
[54:38] said it's a uniting time of God and his
[54:41] bride - and he said that I say this with
[54:44] reverence and respect here's a prophet
[54:47] hear this he said I believe that the
[54:50] pride of Christ is called
[54:51] oh right he spoke it yeah you're coming
[54:56] for it
[54:57] he's speaking you out he said I believe
[54:59] the pride of God is poor I believe
[55:02] holily he is he's standing in 1963 he's
[55:04] speaking because he know there's a bride
[55:06] in 2019 who's gonna hear this very same
[55:09] message this morning
[55:11] he said I believe the Pradas call I
[55:13] believe she sealed into the kingdom of
[55:16] God
[55:17] I believe the mechanics is there and
[55:19] they are waiting for the dynamics that
[55:22] will take her off the earth and into
[55:24] glory and in the rapture
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:29] I have caught the prophets pocket I
[55:32] believe it and that settles it
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:42] praise God a man a man he said we don't
[55:47] know he said I believe it with all my
[55:48] heart he's a man is not right he said we
[55:52] do not dynamics I'll take off the words
[55:54] in the glory an interruption he said I
[55:56] believe it with all my heart do you
[55:58] believe it this morning it's the only
[56:01] hope the church has today so I believe
[56:04] it with all my heart because there's
[56:06] nothing to go back to we've already
[56:08] burned the boats so there's no going
[56:10] back
[56:11] we gotta go for whatever back what never
[56:14] I'll take your sword and run into the
[56:18] battle hallelujah praise calling man
[56:20] they've caught be with me then I shall
[56:22] be able I believe it all my heart yes
[56:26] sir
[56:27] we don't know how he's gonna do it but
[56:30] he shall do it
[56:31] he is the dynamics or enemy say that
[56:35] again he is the dynamics so after he set
[56:42] up his own system court set up his own
[56:45] system in you putting all the lust and
[56:47] lies burns out the filth and trash burns

[1:00:25] Holy Spirit that we have worked in a
[1:00:28] small measure while the head spoon is
[1:00:31] coming down to unite with the body so
[1:00:34] while the headstone is coming down God

[1:02:52] a hundred percent on for God isn't that
[1:02:56] yeah they're the ones that God will use
[1:02:59] because God can't did never can't find
[1:03:02] an inch of space to work in you see you

[1:03:13] devil the Bible said make no provision
[1:03:16] for the flesh to fulfill the lust
[1:03:18] thereof and it makes me think about that
[1:03:21] rich young ruler when he come to Jesus
[1:03:23] he was a good man the Bible said she
[1:03:28] just loved him he come and he asked good
[1:03:31] master what should I do to inherit
[1:03:32] eternal life and so on
[1:03:34] are you gonna tell him well in obey the
[1:03:35] commandments and do what's right and
[1:03:38] it'll come to church be a nice Christian
[1:03:41] so he say well this I do from my youth
[1:03:45] I'm doing this since I'm a small man no
[1:03:49] I'm a big man and I still feel the same
[1:03:52] I come to church for a long time but I
[1:03:56] still feel the same I don't feel no
[1:03:58] change it's become a routine for me it's
[1:04:02] become an order for me it's become a
[1:04:05] schedule to wake up in the morning and
[1:04:08] to go to church I don't feel the spirit
[1:04:11] I don't feel the anointing there's
[1:04:13] something wrong and I just can't put my
[1:04:16] finger on it oh I need a change but must
[1:04:21] I need something good master I need
[1:04:24] something to make me whole
[1:04:26] I'm only patch hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:04:30] I need a full thing and at that point
[1:04:34] the Bible said Jesus loved him
[1:04:37] love projected itself and then in an
[1:04:42] atmosphere and not a holy holy spirit
[1:04:46] now was examining his soul almost like a
[1:04:49] x-ray on the outside people look normal
[1:04:52] but when you take x-rays it does expose
[1:04:56] some stuff
[1:04:58] we take an ultrasound it does expose
[1:05:01] some stuff that you didn't even know
[1:05:04] what's wrong with you I thought she was
[1:05:06] okay you know you feel a little funny
[1:05:09] you come to the doctor for a checkup and
[1:05:11] here was this man come to the good
[1:05:13] master because I'm sure he went to other
[1:05:16] rabbis and priests of that time maybe he
[1:05:19] didn't get the answer he wanted but he
[1:05:22] ain't come to the right place here you
[1:05:24] come at the right time and maybe this
[1:05:27] morning you come to the right place just
[1:05:28] at the right time to hear the right
[1:05:31] message hallelujah hallelujah yet jesus
[1:05:36] said you've got a money demon it's like
[1:05:39] a soul you better sell all that you have
[1:05:41] [Music]

[1:05:48] thing you put up on that pedestal that
[1:05:50] you have dong like those own now just

[1:05:55] night that thing sell it that thing that
[1:05:59] you idolize God said I will have no
[1:06:02] idols before me walk before me and be
[1:06:06] there for perfect that is the Commission
[1:06:09] that God is calling us to is now but
[1:06:16] some of us we keep idols keep things
[1:06:20] locked away and no one knows we're
[1:06:25] shaking hands and we're trying to be the
[1:06:26] best we can and that's alright what q
[1:06:31] yet Jesus n he that loveth his life in
[1:06:37] this world shall lose it but he that
[1:06:40] hated his life in this world shall keep
[1:06:43] it unto life eternal because he's gonna
[1:06:47] give you a new life a new walk a new
[1:06:50] talk to set your affection on things
[1:06:53] above
[1:06:59] halleluyah halleluyah

[1:07:05] could fully occupy the space and he has
[1:07:08] in there and he put in man for the holy
[1:07:12] ghost prophets it is a small compartment
[1:07:14] in the heart scientists don't know what
[1:07:18] it's for profits that I believe we've
[1:07:22] caught put a space there got to be a
[1:07:24] purpose for it I believe that's where
[1:07:26] that spirit wants to dwell in your heart
[1:07:29] you got to be able to take him to school
[1:07:33] with you to take him on the job with you

[1:08:03] mechanics
[1:08:04] what's mechanics wood wood a line upon
[1:08:08] line here a little there a little
[1:08:10] precept upon precept oh honey teaching
[1:08:14] is not right positionally placing you
[1:08:16] but not what you need is that Spirit of
[1:08:19] God to come and confirm his word what he
[1:08:23] spoke all those years what he was always
[1:08:26] saying to you oh my we'll get it free

[1:08:41] you wouldn't take too much time so let's
[1:08:43] go that he's a big dynamics we just
[1:08:46] become members of the Machine of his
[1:08:48] body that's a beautiful line amen
[1:08:51] forming ourselves into his image and
[1:08:53] then seeing him uniting himself with us
[1:08:56] in his works with his love gifts as he
[1:08:59] hands them to us before the wedding
[1:09:01] supper and we're waiting we're watching
[1:09:03] for that are you watching for that today
[1:09:05] Amen they're big churches to be United
[1:09:08] it's not right okay
[1:09:10] said no dammit dynamics of this year to
[1:09:11] be refilling the holy spirit that we
[1:09:13] work in a small measure while a
[1:09:15] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:09:17] the body but when the head on the body
[1:09:19] unites together the full power of the
[1:09:23] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:09:26] exactly like that my my my my my you
[1:09:33] know what that's like that's like you
[1:09:35] have a car all tuned up or a piece of
[1:09:37] machinery or something that's just maybe
[1:09:41] it's just missing a little part maybe
[1:09:43] just need one part to work and you're
[1:09:46] hunting all over looking for that part
[1:09:47] hey man that's how God is looking for
[1:09:49] you this morning he needed that pathway
[1:09:52] to work I know if it was a screw when it
[1:09:54] was a plug maybe it was the smallest
[1:09:56] thing but he just needed that one thing
[1:09:59] maybe it's a fan belt I don't know just
[1:10:02] needed something to get this thing
[1:10:05] moving they kept this thing into March
[1:10:07] and once it was in position he could
[1:10:11] turn the key and the thing would ignite
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:20] so this part is getting ready because
[1:10:23] she has to catch the headstone there's a
[1:10:26] void or cap up there that you will call
[1:10:29] out of this laude CH I don't have a
[1:10:32] permit here but he'll call out of that
[1:10:34] laude CH to fit into that void or gap
[1:10:37] chords Donahue stones stones out of
[1:10:41] different corners of the earth all over
[1:10:43] the place God is gonna call different
[1:10:45] ones that's why you come from different
[1:10:48] places and different backgrounds
[1:10:50] different society holla no but that
[1:10:53] doesn t tell me who you are but because
[1:10:55] God predestinated a bright God put a
[1:10:58] seed of predestination in your soul
[1:11:01] I see the perfection that you will not
[1:11:04] satisfy with who you are that you were
[1:11:06] called to so much more than this and you
[1:11:09] believe that with all your heart and God
[1:11:11] led you this way he let you that way he
[1:11:14] brought you this way you fell this way
[1:11:17] you have this trial you
[1:11:19] this chest you beat yourself up about it
[1:11:22] you felt all torn up but you are still
[1:11:24] coming on poor Ottawa still working his
[1:11:27] way out Paul was still working on you
[1:11:30] heart is still bringing you out he's not
[1:11:32] finished with you yet
[1:11:34] the work that he has started in you he
[1:11:37] is able to complete it this morning so
[1:11:40] that you could fit in to that point or
[1:11:43] cap in the pyramid to catch that
[1:11:47] headstone to complete the body work a
[1:11:55] man a man he could come down into it oh
[1:11:58] please you know take a little breather a
[1:12:08] man you love him
[1:12:09] Rory hallelujah so that's who we are
[1:12:15] call out as lively stones a man fitly
[1:12:20] joined together into this body mystical
[1:12:23] body of Christ for this last day to do
[1:12:26] the great work to finish the work a -
[1:12:28] alright
[1:12:29] praise God a Christ left off for us to
[1:12:31] do here now watch he said now for myself
[1:12:35] with this image okay alright a man the
[1:12:40] full power of the Holy Spirit so we need
[1:12:42] a full power to take us up however you
[1:12:46] need to connect hallelujah to bring out
[1:12:48] the dead in Christ we need a full power
[1:12:50] Hollan is now in order to have the full
[1:12:53] power God her to restore the full word
[1:12:56] back in this last day all our scattered
[1:13:00] throughout the ages right that's why God
[1:13:03] call a prophet in this last thing to tie
[1:13:06] up all the loose ends to finish all
[1:13:08] these hidden mysteries things that the
[1:13:11] people didn't know to reveal what Luther
[1:13:13] was doing the part that Wesley had to
[1:13:15] play the part of the Pentecostals had to
[1:13:17] play to reveal the open door age and to
[1:13:20] show her that whole thing come down
[1:13:21] right down into this last day the show
[1:13:24] that this last day prior she would have
[1:13:26] the dynamics of her mechanics holiday to
[1:13:29] go up into glory to connect with what
[1:13:31] back there hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:34] hallelujah
[1:13:35] all right that's why if we feel a
[1:13:38] prophet to reveal the full word so with
[1:13:42] the full word restored every single part
[1:13:44] now the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:46] could come down into the bodywork and
[1:13:49] seal the whole thing and make it live
[1:13:52] and it'll speak and it'll create itself
[1:13:56] hallelujah all these things that we're
[1:13:59] looking for
[1:14:00] Amen all right we will be fulfilled at
[1:14:04] that time when it connects isn't that
[1:14:07] right
[1:14:07] priests gone so I wanted to strike my
[1:14:10] subject here and I know that now God
[1:14:12] wants to reproduce himself I just want
[1:14:16] to stress on this for this a few moments
[1:14:22] and I think about sometimes our mother
[1:14:24] may be you know any mother would love to
[1:14:27] have children and soon and it's a desire
[1:14:30] of any mother any woman to come at a
[1:14:32] point where she where she wants to have
[1:14:34] children or to have a family of Hollens
[1:14:36] narrowing and how she wants to you know
[1:14:40] bring four children and to experience
[1:14:42] that and I feel how God maybe felt that
[1:14:45] way too at one time that he wants to
[1:14:48] reproduce himself he wanted to tirta to
[1:14:53] bring forth something like himself he
[1:14:56] had a desire to do it
[1:14:58] yes I don't know how long time wasn't
[1:15:02] measured then but he stayed alone with
[1:15:04] his thoughts and he had these wonderful
[1:15:07] thoughts about being a father Savior
[1:15:10] healer and I know we talk about it a lot
[1:15:13] but I want us to focus on the part where
[1:15:15] God's building and his idea is because
[1:15:18] he wanted to have sons he wanted to have
[1:15:23] somebody to talk to
[1:15:25] he wanted to have somebody to fellowship
[1:15:28] with Oh hallelujah
[1:15:31] no wonder he told Adam it's not good for
[1:15:33] man to be alone because he knew how that
[1:15:36] felt
[1:15:37] and that's why he laid Adam down on the
[1:15:40] ground in that deep sleep
[1:15:43] and out of his rib he brought for Eve
[1:15:45] and now the man who stole our Lord was
[1:15:47] happy but us please isn't that right
[1:15:51] that man was no longer alone it pleased
[1:15:53] God to see his creation come forth to
[1:15:57] see Adam comfort any time God look at
[1:16:00] Adam he would smile he would rejoice
[1:16:03] because finally after all of this time
[1:16:07] there was somebody on the earth that
[1:16:09] looked like him walk like him talk like
[1:16:14] him I could be like him he could talk to
[1:16:17] Oh God want somebody to talk to this
[1:16:22] noise and when we pray when we go into a
[1:16:34] closet what are we doing we are
[1:16:37] reconnecting with our Father we are
[1:16:39] reconnecting with our Heavenly Father
[1:16:41] who has a desire to talk to his children
[1:16:45] to talk to his loved ones to talk to his
[1:16:48] sons to talk to his daughters God wants
[1:16:52] to have a relationship with his
[1:16:54] hallelujah with his thoughts so there
[1:17:02] were no more thoughts
[1:17:03] God spoke it's not right we know all the
[1:17:07] logos comfort creation and man and
[1:17:10] everything else
[1:17:11] finally he was so pleased tele to caress
[1:17:18] because a man on the earth had the
[1:17:20] authority to sign a check he looked like
[1:17:23] him walk like him talk like him animals
[1:17:28] to what you want to do God come to such
[1:17:31] a point of rest that all he had to do
[1:17:34] any evening was calm down and asked out
[1:17:36] of our report how was the day well I
[1:17:40] changed this tree I didn't like this
[1:17:42] color so I found it look nice what do
[1:17:44] you think about it wow that looks good
[1:17:47] couldn't have done it better myself my
[1:17:50] Halloween
[1:17:51] nation ship they were having
[1:17:53] conversations Adam was given a report
[1:17:55] every evening
[1:17:57] hallelujah about how well he was doing
[1:17:59] and the father was happy
[1:18:01] hallelujah and corn was desire for a son
[1:18:06] was met through Adam true even so on
[1:18:09] what desires I have children then it
[1:18:12] became to hoever gaan quoted his family
[1:18:15] it's not right but now the devil stepped
[1:18:19] into the picture and now caught all Adam
[1:18:22] you gave him a commission what did he
[1:18:24] tell him he told to multiply and to
[1:18:27] replenish and subdue the elephant do
[1:18:30] have dominion over it it's not right you
[1:18:33] take control you take charge and the
[1:18:36] devil saw an opportunity to slip into
[1:18:39] God's program and to break is now right
[1:18:44] what God was coming on to so before God
[1:18:48] he could come into that multiplying time
[1:18:50] that season that was supposed to come
[1:18:52] around where God would reveal how that
[1:18:54] would take place whatever comments to
[1:18:57] put a stop to it isn't that right and
[1:19:00] that's how sin came into the picture and
[1:19:02] that's how the devil the serpent was
[1:19:04] able to corrupt this this being this man
[1:19:10] that God created and slipped us leader
[1:19:12] discrepancy in there isn't that right
[1:19:14] and all creation fell hallelujah so the
[1:19:19] devil was successful you could see
[1:19:21] temporarily in hindering God's work but
[1:19:26] that's okay because it's in the weakness
[1:19:30] it's in the fallenness it's where he
[1:19:33] shows himself to be strong sometimes we
[1:19:42] make a mistake and we feel like we can't
[1:19:46] come back or we feel like it's too far
[1:19:49] for us but right there is where God
[1:19:52] shows himself to be God Oh hallelujah
[1:20:00] how could he be the god of forgiveness
[1:20:02] if there's nothing to forgive
[1:20:05] but we were lost in sin we were stooped
[1:20:09] Alleluia we were town in the dumps we
[1:20:12] didn't know who we were real almost cut
[1:20:14] off his night but for the blood of Jesus
[1:20:17] that reached out his hand and pulled you
[1:20:21] up out of the darkest deepest depths
[1:20:24] that's the God we serve this morning
[1:20:27] that is Jesus that is what he can do
[1:20:32] oh but he couldn't do it Oh hallelujah
[1:20:35] hallelu
[1:20:37] if he didn't know guilt you wouldn't
[1:20:40] know that the liberty of the freedom of
[1:20:42] the sons of God when he reveals himself
[1:20:46] to you when he unlocks and opens the
[1:20:49] prison doors when he sets you free when
[1:20:52] his Spirit comes upon you when you feel
[1:20:54] the anointing of God because you know

[1:38:04] hallelujah we turn over to the spirit
[1:38:07] real soon you just ride the anointing he
[1:38:09] said now of course we know that God
[1:38:11] couldn't fulfill the promise to Adam to
[1:38:13] multiply the devil stepped in all right
[1:38:15] so God's plan was to always reproduce
[1:38:18] himself so when the prophets come Joseph
[1:38:22] and and all the stages of all isn't all
[1:38:25] right Abraham Isaac isn't all right
[1:38:27] they were only showing likenesses of
[1:38:29] Christ that was to come but when Christ
[1:38:32] come on the scene he was a magnificent
[1:38:35] one he was another Adam that God could
[1:38:39] look down upon finally got to continue
[1:38:42] his work that he had started on it's no
[1:38:45] wonder jesus told his disciples he
[1:38:48] called Philippi : drew they didn't know
[1:38:51] where they were being called but they
[1:38:52] felt something on their souls they felt
[1:38:55] something in their hearts they knew that
[1:38:57] this was a messiah they couldn't quite
[1:38:59] explain it it's not much but he was
[1:39:03] calling them why because he was getting
[1:39:05] ready to multiply a new plan
[1:39:08] Shh he was getting ready to reproduce
[1:39:10] himself he said a little while long my
[1:39:12] the world will see me no more but you
[1:39:15] are gonna see me and because I live you
[1:39:18] shall live also and as he got caught had
[1:39:21] sent me even so send I you
[1:39:23] no wonder he said on that day you shall
[1:39:26] know I am in my father here in me and I
[1:39:29] knew no one hallelujah well before God
[1:39:41] could pour out his Spirit upon them he
[1:39:44] had to speak at first he had to put the
[1:39:46] word out there first so he told them
[1:39:48] certain things and the treaty is the son
[1:39:51] of man will be lifted up and they into
[1:39:52] the hands of sinful man it's not riding
[1:39:54] a tree Daisy be raised up again
[1:39:56] isn't that right how he told them what
[1:39:59] what happened he told them what would
[1:40:00] take place a man is now right hallelujah
[1:40:05] he came unto his own the Bible said and
[1:40:07] it's all receive him not but as many as
[1:40:10] received him to them gave he power God
[1:40:13] knows who would receive him oh my do you
[1:40:18] know who you are this morning you are
[1:40:20] not just anybody but you are them who
[1:40:22] would receive him you are his hands you
[1:40:25] are the Sheep of his pasture or how can
[1:40:28] the devil block you from his hands we
[1:40:31] know the truth
[1:40:33] hallelujah and the truth is what sets us
[1:40:36] free Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:46] no wonder he told them unless a corner
[1:40:49] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[1:40:51] abideth alone but when it die it
[1:40:54] bringeth forth much fruit you keep
[1:40:56] dropping off the word speaking unto them
[1:40:58] all it might seem like they couldn't
[1:41:00] handle it because it couldn't understand
[1:41:02] it but he still had to speak it because
[1:41:05] he knew he was gonna come around in that
[1:41:07] resurrection ministry and begin to open
[1:41:10] their understanding to the scripture
[1:41:12] hallelujah hallelujah what he was
[1:41:14] telling them hallelujah
[1:41:19] that's why I told ya and when Christ
[1:41:22] died in some transaction took place so
[1:41:26] for three days he lay in the ground but
[1:41:29] on the third day by the word just as he
[1:41:32] spoke it he rose up holidays night the
[1:41:36] mighty Conqueror and in the evening
[1:41:39] service when they were shot in afraid of
[1:41:42] the Romans do with him Wheaton it was a
[1:41:45] appearance he didn't want to go sign it
[1:41:48] was a too afraid to pray it was a solemn
[1:41:50] assembly but all of a sudden here comes
[1:41:53] Jesus the Bible said he came in to them
[1:41:56] while the doors were shut let me tell
[1:42:01] you something there's no tour this
[1:42:04] morning that construct brought out if
[1:42:06] God wants to come inside he's gonna find
[1:42:10] a way to get in there Oh hallelujah
[1:42:14] because he wants to bless you Oh glory
[1:42:18] be to God
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:24] hallelujah people try to shut got out
[1:42:27] and they get despondent
[1:42:29] and they get you know its content three
[1:42:33] maybe or maybe get discouraged sometimes
[1:42:36] and it happens in the Christian journey
[1:42:38] and somehow you feel like we just shut
[1:42:40] everything out and we don't hear from
[1:42:42] nobody but there's no door this morning
[1:42:44] that you could close hard enough if you
[1:42:47] are predestinated God's gonna find you
[1:42:50] brother what's gonna find you sister God
[1:42:54] will make himself known to you oh you
[1:43:03] shut he'll find a way he came in and he
[1:43:07] spoke to his disciples and we can't
[1:43:09] encourage them and he breathed upon
[1:43:12] receiving a Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:43:15] because the transaction already took
[1:43:16] place now he could put in hallelujah he
[1:43:20] could issue out the warrants but it
[1:43:22] devil's arrest now because he's holding
[1:43:24] the keys he's got the authority over
[1:43:27] everything in heaven and energy and he
[1:43:30] kept them the Holy Ghost he said Terry
[1:43:32] in Jerusalem and wait for the power I'm
[1:43:36] gonna give it to you I'm going up so
[1:43:39] that he could come top hallelujah praise
[1:43:42] call him a man oh and they waited and
[1:43:47] they tarried and they prayed and they
[1:43:50] praise God continually oh it didn't
[1:43:53] happen on the first day right man but
[1:43:55] Isaac said I did not put on a second
[1:43:57] leading up on the third day but it
[1:43:59] didn't discourage them they knew they'd
[1:44:01] heard from God they knew they heard from
[1:44:03] Jesus they finally knew who this man was
[1:44:09] hallelujah hallelujah oh my
[1:44:13] imagine these brothers come at the
[1:44:16] church for three and a half years and
[1:44:18] didn't know who he was
[1:44:19] imagine you going to a church and you
[1:44:22] don't know who that man is
[1:44:23] but you just know this is real you just
[1:44:26] know this alive you know you never felt
[1:44:28] anything like this ever before

[1:44:36] Sonny keeps holding you something keeps
[1:44:39] holding arranged you don't understand
[1:44:41] all of it but you know God spoke to you
[1:44:44] you know God's doing something in your
[1:44:46] life you're not put y'all to be but
[1:44:48] you're not what you used to be you're
[1:44:50] coming over something and for all of a
[1:44:53] sudden after all those years that mine
[1:44:56] was unlocked
[1:44:57] I saw who they were and to what they had
[1:45:00] to receive brother you can imagine what
[1:45:04] kind of service they have that's the
[1:45:07] kind of service we have in right now we
[1:45:10] understand by revelation who we are and
[1:45:13] what we have to receive hallelujah that
[1:45:17] you have to receive the same penny the
[1:45:19] same Holy Ghost that Peter receive not
[1:45:22] Mary receives not John right Phillip all
[1:45:25] of them you know that that prophet came
[1:45:34] to turn us back to the feet of the
[1:45:35] fathers telling us back to the feet of a
[1:45:38] solid fathers that once more this bully
[1:45:40] had direct from God what we have to
[1:45:43] connect back to what they had hallelujah
[1:45:46] we have to connect back hallelujah
[1:45:48] hallelujah is now right to the Spirit of
[1:45:50] God the word stay on books and tapes for
[1:45:53] a long time Halloween is night but he
[1:45:57] our common now is when the true
[1:45:58] worshipers are gonna worship the father
[1:46:01] in spirit and in truth how because they
[1:46:04] will have dynamics and mechanics working
[1:46:07] together spirit and truth in the church
[1:46:10] or power of God working in the church
[1:46:13] dynamics upon the mechanics in the
[1:46:15] church callings sin out Oh hallelujah
[1:46:18] calling out the unbelief calling out the
[1:46:21] uncircumcised healing the sick raising
[1:46:23] the dead casting out Devils
[1:46:30] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:46:34] so he's spoken to them why he wanted to
[1:46:38] reproduce himself and in order to do
[1:46:40] that he had to give them the word the
[1:46:44] word has prophecy as to what he was
[1:46:47] about to do among them and in them and
[1:46:51] all it didn't quite understand it he had
[1:46:54] to say it he had to speak it before his
[1:46:58] resurrection ministry so here was
[1:47:03] another atom that please got in so much
[1:47:07] that the Spirit of God drop down and say
[1:47:09] here is my here is my son my beloved Son
[1:47:12] in whom I am well pleased to dwell he a
[1:47:16] him Christ isn't that right
[1:47:20] hallelujah was all at portland's God
[1:47:24] poured himself into this man
[1:47:26] God had another one like him on the
[1:47:29] earth and this man had a mission he
[1:47:33] couldn't stay like that because he said
[1:47:35] unless the corner wheat fall into the
[1:47:36] ground and die it's a vital own so God
[1:47:40] had to find a way to reproduce that same
[1:47:44] Jesus he had a dirt and the only way he
[1:47:47] could do it is to release the spirit
[1:47:49] that was upon that man because that's
[1:47:52] the only spirit that could come back
[1:47:54] upon the worshiper is now right because
[1:47:59] the blood of bulls and goats was only a
[1:48:02] temporal pardon for sin but the spirit
[1:48:05] of that animal could not come back upon
[1:48:08] the worshiper
[1:48:09] isn't that right because it was just an
[1:48:11] animal it was just a type it was just a
[1:48:14] sacrifice God temporarily received for
[1:48:17] sin at that time but God was coming on
[1:48:20] to the fullness of his sacrifice isn't
[1:48:23] that right I pull this up his atonement
[1:48:25] for sin and the only way he could do it
[1:48:28] was true Christ so here come he spoke
[1:48:30] another one into existence and he come
[1:48:33] through Mary a sinless one
[1:48:35] and he lived and he acted and he did and
[1:48:39] he pleased quad and he learned obedience
[1:48:42] by the things that he suffered and he
[1:48:45] grown with a headache he was tired yet
[1:48:48] at the grave of Lazarus he said Lazarus
[1:48:50] comfort he was a man yet he was more
[1:48:54] than a man because what was failing him
[1:48:57] was the power to release you from your
[1:49:00] guilt to release you from your shame
[1:49:04] hallelujah praise God praise God that's
[1:49:11] why he told them that the Son of man had
[1:49:13] to be offered up holidays now right at
[1:49:16] the hands of sinful men why his spirit
[1:49:19] had to be released because it was yet to
[1:49:21] go in the presence of God you remember
[1:49:24] with Iran the priests and everything
[1:49:25] they tied a rope around him and they let
[1:49:28] him go in blew it and sing it ringing
[1:49:31] holy holy unto the Lord Amen he couldn't
[1:49:34] go in themselves if anything happened to
[1:49:36] Iran in there they had to pull him out
[1:49:38] nobody could go in it's not right but
[1:49:42] now the veil was torn not that he had
[1:49:46] made a way this morning the same spirit
[1:49:50] I was in Christ because he came up the
[1:49:52] coast that holy Coast had not coming to
[1:49:56] you he released his spirit the same
[1:50:01] spirit that you could not catch that you
[1:50:03] could not access that made you strangers
[1:50:06] and foreigners but now through the blood
[1:50:08] of Jesus Christ
[1:50:09] we have been made kings and priests and
[1:50:13] fellow citizens of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:18] [Music]

[1:54:34] a power there to confirm that that's
[1:54:36] gasoline

[1:55:06] word he said it's the truth he said but
[1:55:09] without the spirit it won't move let it
[1:55:14] kill it but the spirit giveth life it is

[1:56:33] manifest and to bring to pass that this
[1:56:36] is gasoline the word isn't there oh my

[2:08:26] prophet said on the first seal at the
[2:08:29] end of the Pentecostal age he said we re
[2:08:31] supposed to receive according to the
[2:08:33] word as God helped me tonight to show
[2:08:36] you here that we have to receive a
[2:08:37] messenger that will take those loose
[2:08:40] ends out there and reveal the whole
[2:08:43] secret of God for the rapturing of the
[2:08:45] church I love her but Isaac said last
[2:08:47] week he said the purpose of the anti
[2:08:49] message was to lose the Holy Spirit it
[2:08:52] was to lose the Holy Ghost listen yeah
[2:08:55] he said Ananias comment 47 mysterious
[2:08:59] thunders that's not even written at all
[2:09:01] he said that's right he said and I
[2:09:03] believe to these seven thunders Ribeira
[2:09:06] feel in the last days it's in order to
[2:09:09] get up ride together for rapture and Shh
[2:09:12] because what we have right now we won't
[2:09:15] be able to do it we need the dynamic
[2:09:18] power this morning in order to be able
[2:09:20] to do it to do the greater works his 9
[2:09:23] he said but there's something he said

[2:09:32] for a fact

[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:38] my said there's something we've got to
[2:09:42] step a little further and that's what
[2:09:44] they're doing today and that's what
[2:09:45] we'll be doing this week will be step a
[2:09:47] little further a little further than
[2:09:49] prayer a little further push amen amen
[2:09:52] alright
[2:09:53] he said we can't have enough faith for
[2:09:55] divine healing hardly he said but we've
[2:09:57] got to have enough faith to be changed
[2:09:59] in a moment I've swept all the desert
[2:10:02] and we'll find out after a while the
[2:10:06] Lord willing we are gonna find where it
[2:10:08] is written and on birth pains he said I
[2:10:11] go God has set some in the church
[2:10:12] through the labor pains
[2:10:15] he said already got tremendous sometimes
[2:10:17] he said but when a church is growing on
[2:10:20] the persecution of the outside world
[2:10:22] believing on the Lord Jesus not the
[2:10:25] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[2:10:28] real as it was the Pentecost how they
[2:10:31] grown and how they cracked under labor
[2:10:35] pains but when they are born and
[2:10:38] positionally poured into the kingdom of
[2:10:41] God the Prophet said then the Holy Ghost
[2:10:44] has set in a church some apostles some
[2:10:48] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[2:10:53] evangelists then he given today speaking
[2:10:57] with tongues interpretation of tongues
