[19:32] greetings and happy father's day to all
[19:34] the fathers among us
[19:40] it's a privilege a blessing and honor to
[19:42] be a father
[19:43] [Music]
[19:45] it's part of what god himself desire to
[19:48] be
[19:50] but he is so longing
[19:53] in him to express
[19:56] fatherhood and he longing for us to
[20:00] become fathers
[20:02] in god in the gospel in maturity
[20:06] not children not young men but fathers
[20:08] amen
[20:09] adopted sons hallelujah it is
[20:12] good pleasure that will be adopted he's
[20:15] not scratching his head
[20:17] wondering he wants us to be adopted
[20:22] but because of his love and his honor he
[20:25] has to keep his word
[20:27] judgment is not god vexed with people
[20:30] it's not god angry with people
[20:32] judgment is the nature of god because of
[20:35] his justice
[20:38] unrighteousness hallelujah
[20:41] that is what makes him god
[20:44] and we appreciate him and we love him
[20:48] oh praise god so god bless you again and
[20:51] welcome
[20:52] we certainly appreciate each one of you
[20:55] coming out here this morning and we had
[20:56] a really powerful
[20:58] prayer meeting on tuesday night
[21:02] and i bought an exhortation
[21:03] [Applause]
[21:06] from isaiah 40 every mountain
[21:12] every mountain and hill shall be made
[21:14] low the crooked and even pace made
[21:17] straight level rough places made plain
[21:20] and then you're going to see the glory
[21:21] of god does he amplify the voice of one
[21:24] christ be pae in the wilderness
[21:26] preparing the way of the lord say clear
[21:29] away obstacles make straight and smooth
[21:32] in the desert a highway for our god
[21:36] so the valleys have to get built up the
[21:38] mountains have to get level
[21:40] the crooked places have to make straight
[21:42] and the rough places get smooth
[21:45] in order to make a way for the glory of
[21:47] god to begin to roll down
[21:49] upon your life isn't that right
[21:53] you talk about the mountains the fully
[21:55] hard
[21:56] resistant areas in your life of pride
[21:58] and unbelief
[22:00] critical attitudes and
[22:01] self-righteousness isn't that right
[22:04] talk about the rough places becoming
[22:06] smooth inconsistencies in your lives
[22:08] harshness in relationships to others
[22:11] being impatient and irritable
[22:13] but this one caught me second
[22:15] corinthians 7 14 with my people
[22:18] not not anybody if my people god is very
[22:21] specific
[22:22] he's not talking about others he said my
[22:24] people that are called by my name
[22:27] shall shall humble themselves and pray
[22:30] and turn from their wicked ways
[22:31] then you're going to hear from heaven
[22:33] god going to heal your land
[22:35] humble yourself and that speaks of
[22:37] brokenness
[22:38] pray pray to realize your dependency
[22:42] upon god
[22:43] i love this one to see god face intimate
[22:45] relationship
[22:46] i'm gonna do with friends and talk and
[22:48] you're watching in front of some i
[22:50] said silman listen no no that's you
[22:52] seeking his face
[22:54] turn from your wicked ways repentance
[22:56] that's the only way to turn
[22:58] from what you're doing you have to
[22:59] repent repentance in the wrong
[23:01] like something i preached a while ago
[23:03] about to please god
[23:04] you have to have an intent to please god
[23:07] if you want to improve on your marriage
[23:08] your relationship you have to have an
[23:10] intent for that you can't just say you
[23:12] want to improve you want to do this no
[23:13] you have to intent
[23:14] you want to study you have to have an
[23:16] intent and then the desire to study and
[23:18] other things will be added to that
[23:19] but if you don't have an intent to
[23:21] change you'll see just as you are
[23:24] and nothing could really move you and
[23:25] change you that is why we
[23:27] read the scripture last service about
[23:29] jesus asking that young man
[23:31] if you want to be perfect in other words
[23:33] i'm not going to force you
[23:35] you know yourself you you do this you do
[23:37] that you did it but if you wanna be
[23:39] perfect
[23:39] you have something to give up you have
[23:41] something to let go
[23:42] you have to release some of this stuff
[23:44] in your life in order to make room
[23:47] for perfection to really get a hole upon
[23:49] you because you
[23:50] really want this world to become flesh
[23:52] you really want that you have been
[23:54] church long enough
[23:55] but you don't want that no more you want
[23:57] this word to become flesh
[23:59] the bible said and the word became flesh
[24:01] and well among us it's got to come into
[24:03] your flesh
[24:04] do you believe that amen so four things
[24:07] here
[24:08] humble pray seek god's face
[24:12] turn from wicked ways that's on our side
[24:15] that's what god asked us if we could do
[24:16] that
[24:17] then revival is guaranteed on its way
[24:20] then if we do that
[24:21] he said he's going to hear our prayer
[24:23] he's going to forgive our sins
[24:24] and he's going to heal our land could we
[24:26] give the lord a shout our praise
[24:33] so pride flows and shows itself in
[24:35] independence self-centeredness
[24:37] arrogance when you're praying you show
[24:40] how much you depend upon god
[24:42] isn't that right and the answer to pride
[24:44] is brokenness
[24:46] broken
[24:47] [Music]
[24:50] brokenness is what i know for
[24:53] [Music]
[24:57] brokenness is what i need
[24:59] [Music]
[25:05] brokenness
[25:07] [Music]
[25:10] is what you want from me
[25:16] from me
[25:21] righteousness righteousness
[25:26] righteousness
[25:35] [Music]
[25:43] [Music]
[25:46] what you want from me
[25:53] from me
[25:56] my life
[26:17] [Music]
[26:22] it
[26:30] or give him some praise right now
[26:39] [Applause]
[26:45] [Music]
[26:50] yes
[26:53] oh jesus
[27:06] take my life
[27:22] [Music]
[27:28] [Music]
[27:34] [Music]
[27:40] you may be seated before we go into the
[27:43] scriptures
[27:44] [Music]
[27:46] i want to bring something to you
[27:58] but remember
[28:01] church you're living in the best day you
[28:03] will ever live in right now
[28:07] until jesus comes it will
[28:10] not gradually but rapidly get worse
[28:14] and worse when russia goes down there
[28:16] for that oil look out that all she needs
[28:19] that's what the prophet said it would do
[28:21] and then we're ready for it then
[28:24] in 1914 the world went to war and there
[28:26] had never been a peace since
[28:28] constantly swinging swinging swinging
[28:29] they're holding they're doing the very
[28:31] same thing yet
[28:33] what was they doing holding he said oh
[28:35] god have mercy
[28:36] holding that great thing i saw in the
[28:39] vision
[28:40] the whole thing becoming the destruction
[28:43] holding the atomic
[28:45] holding the wars that they don't destroy
[28:48] themselves
[28:49] until the thing come to destroy until
[28:51] israel turns back and get herself
[28:53] together
[28:53] then the message will go to israel and
[28:56] she'll be sealed
[28:57] with the seal of the holy ghost after
[29:00] the gentile is called out the people for
[29:04] his namesake will be called out
[29:06] and the israel receive a trina year
[29:08] six-month message
[29:11] so we know but i'm saying that seven
[29:13] visions which is a muslim the past
[29:14] before jesus
[29:15] comes again the seventh vision is where
[29:17] america was bombed up
[29:21] you still talk about i know we did this
[29:23] before but i feel that to do it again
[29:26] he said the america built two horns
[29:28] civil ecclesial powers
[29:30] lamb freedom of religion but after a
[29:33] while
[29:33] they spoke like a dragon people who
[29:36] follow the pillar of fire
[29:39] will certainly have a rough time but
[29:41] they are ready for the translation
[29:43] at that time ready to go
[29:47] so i want you to understand it's no
[29:52] picnic
[29:58] because they were called chosen and
[30:00] faithful the elected of god
[30:03] now watch watch
[30:06] there is a fear who knew not joseph
[30:10] what was joseph represented question
[30:14] answer the spiritual part
[30:17] of a spiritual exodus
[30:22] now bear in mind the first exodus was a
[30:25] natural land to a natural land
[30:26] to the land of canaan the second exodus
[30:30] was from a natural land canaan land
[30:32] into a spiritual baptism in the upper
[30:33] room the third exodus is from a
[30:36] spiritual baptism into the land of the
[30:37] millennium
[30:39] that's the third exodus so what ram is
[30:41] saying here is prophecy
[30:43] he said what does joseph represent
[30:46] he said the spiritual part in this
[30:49] spiritual
[30:50] exodus that is what joseph represents
[30:53] their watch their races up now we are
[30:56] freedom
[30:57] the woman nourished over time but
[30:59] finally
[31:00] a pharaoh dictator
[31:04] this is coming to america now
[31:08] who knew not the freedom of religion
[31:13] uniting them together don't let this
[31:15] pass you
[31:16] there come a time where there was a
[31:18] pharaoh first had to come
[31:23] there was a pharaoh who raised up who
[31:26] knew not joseph
[31:27] and that was the beginning of the
[31:29] beginning that was the beginning of the
[31:32] exodus
[31:34] so once you see pharaoh raising up you
[31:37] know we on our way out of here
[31:41] oh hallelujah because pharaoh raising up
[31:44] means
[31:44] moses is coming to deliver the people
[31:48] sethi had to die and the next man to
[31:50] raise up who knew not joseph
[31:53] i don't have to read everything here but
[31:55] while ramsay is growing in power
[31:56] moses growing in power while the
[31:58] dictator risen in power the pride rising
[32:01] in power
[32:02] god even leave us like this
[32:06] oh i'm feeling something now
[32:10] hallelujah so you recognize this is not
[32:13] for church members
[32:15] just all church remember what is the
[32:16] church to go to
[32:25] all right let's read a little further
[32:32] all right there's the pharaoh who raised
[32:33] up who knew not joseph
[32:35] that was the beginning of the exodus and
[32:38] when that thing began to form
[32:39] one under a political power
[32:43] begin to form form
[32:46] god begin to get ready
[32:51] the iniquity of the america was
[32:52] fulfilled the time that the promised
[32:55] abraham was fulfilled
[32:56] the time of deliverance was at hand god
[32:58] permitted
[32:59] a fear to rise up raise up who knew not
[33:02] joseph and ramsay was born
[33:03] after satikan ramses and ramses was not
[33:06] was the one who knew not the blessings
[33:07] of joseph
[33:08] he uh watched and he didn't know
[33:11] what the spiritual side was and i think
[33:14] if any man was spiritual
[33:16] could see what's taking place now we are
[33:19] getting a pharaoh
[33:20] who knows not freedom of religion and at
[33:23] that time he was saying this
[33:25] when our president took his office he
[33:27] would not swear that he believed in
[33:28] freedom of religion this is 963
[33:31] to exodus but there raised up affair who
[33:33] knew not joseph the same thing today
[33:35] a man has raised up took oat in the
[33:38] white house
[33:38] i will not swear to this oat will not
[33:40] take his oath that he believes in
[33:42] freedom of religion
[33:43] when this new pope you talk about i'll
[33:45] skip that let's go a little further
[33:47] at the time ramsay's in egypt was
[33:49] growing his power was growing
[33:50] the natural man ramsay was growing the
[33:53] natural man the antichrist is growing
[33:54] now
[33:55] through politics
[33:58] not religious yet
[34:02] oh my god all right true politics
[34:10] all right he already got to the white
[34:12] house in religion
[34:13] he got the people scooped up till they
[34:16] already they actually will
[34:17] fall right for it and the denominational
[34:21] leaders practically everyone
[34:23] every church that's in this nation is
[34:25] already in the confederation of churches
[34:26] ramses is growing
[34:27] they're all united together and what
[34:29] they have what does it do
[34:31] it makes a power a beast like the first
[34:34] one now there's a persecution coming
[34:37] upon
[34:38] all those who won't unite with it and a
[34:41] boycott
[34:42] it will be too late then
[34:45] you already took the mark don't say i'll
[34:47] do it then you better do it now
[34:49] ramses was growing remember while ramsay
[34:52] was going in power
[34:54] god had moses in the wilderness he was
[34:56] growing too
[34:59] so it has to have a bride on earth
[35:01] growing too
[35:02] they have to have a bride coming into
[35:04] power if the be
[35:06] system coming into power there's got to
[35:08] be a move
[35:09] of the spirit of god upon a bright bunch
[35:12] called by seven thunders because seven
[35:14] thunders canada right
[35:16] together get the bright faith to call
[35:18] for power
[35:19] to the god to have a seventh time the
[35:21] bunch
[35:21] [Applause]
[35:25] hallelujah they are brought growing
[35:28] it will be a shorter one of these days
[35:30] the time ain't far off when there will
[35:33] be a showdown
[35:36] so what's happening in your home there's
[35:37] a showdown they're not even a bear lion
[35:40] or even goliath
[35:42] you mean your little family issues and
[35:44] challenges you can't deal with it
[35:46] in a christian manner i didn't mean to
[35:49] go there this morning
[35:51] that's the pastoral part
[35:54] okay so watch look at the church now
[35:58] calling out coming into power oh man
[35:59] here we go watch
[36:01] as the scripture says the natural type
[36:02] is spiritual it's the truth
[36:04] look at the church now calling out
[36:07] coming
[36:08] into power this is but the holy spirit
[36:11] coming down
[36:12] the mysteries of god being revealed and
[36:15] set in order

[37:46] so are you ready for the word this
[37:47] morning or could we stan
[38:02] one or two of the bibles ephesians
[38:04] chapter four one verse
[38:06] verse 11 to 13 and hebrews chapter 10
[38:09] verse 11 through 17.
[38:24] ephesians 4 verse 11
[38:30] and they give some apostles and some
[38:31] prophets and some evangelists and some
[38:34] pastors and teachers
[38:36] for the perfection of the saints for the
[38:38] work of the ministry
[38:40] for the eddy fan of the body of christ
[38:42] to be all come in the unity of the faith
[38:44] of the knowledge of the son of god
[38:46] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[38:49] the stature
[38:50] of the fullness of christ and hebrews
[38:52] chapter 10
[38:54] from verse 11 we read every pre-standard
[38:57] daily ministering an
[38:58] offering of times
[39:02] the same sacrifices which can never take
[39:04] away sins
[39:06] but this man after he had offered
[39:09] one sacrifice for sins forever sat down
[39:14] on the right hand of god
[39:16] from henceforth expecting
[39:19] till his enemies we made his footstool
[39:22] for by one offering he had perfected
[39:26] forever
[39:27] them that are sanctified whereof the
[39:30] holy ghost also be a witness to us
[39:32] for after that he had said before this
[39:35] is the covenant
[39:36] that i will make with in those days said
[39:39] the lord
[39:40] i will put my laws into their hearts and
[39:43] in their minds
[39:44] will i write them and their sins and
[39:46] iniquity will
[39:47] remember no more let's pray father we
[39:49] thank you for your word
[39:50] blessed to our hearts lord i wait on you
[39:53] lord make the world be transformed
[39:57] into the lives and hearts of the people
[39:59] we ask in jesus name
[40:00] may your spirit come and confirm your
[40:02] word to them amen amen you may be seated
[40:05] oh praise the lord
[40:23] oh thank you lord jesus
[40:27] when the dynamic struck the pentecostals
[40:31] they could not come to perfection why
[40:36] this is very important
[40:40] because people looking for spirit
[40:43] they're looking for power but the
[40:45] pentecostal got
[40:46] power and spirit and it didn't come true
[40:50] that powerful testimonies they were
[40:52] speaking in tongues
[40:54] they were healing the sick cast now
[40:56] devils the other testimony woman one
[40:58] time they were cut people
[40:59] got so vexed they got shotguns and shoot
[41:01] at them and the bullet just fallen off
[41:03] their clothing
[41:05] without even harming them powerful
[41:08] miracles
[41:10] powerful testimonies the anointing was
[41:12] blocks away
[41:13] before you even reached a church people
[41:15] were falling on the streets
[41:17] from the dynamic power that was released
[41:21] 1906 pentecostal revival you heard what
[41:24] i said
[41:25] blocks away from the church itself where
[41:28] they were gathered together
[41:30] the people were being healed in the
[41:31] streets the people will fall along in
[41:33] the streets
[41:34] didn't even have to read the church the
[41:36] glory and the anointing and the power
[41:38] was emanating from inside out to the
[41:41] people
[41:42] you just had to be dear they had
[41:45] testimony piano playing by itself
[41:47] people got gifts of playing and music
[41:49] when they just get it they just have to
[41:50] play like if they always play in
[41:52] all kind of miracles and power yet they
[41:56] couldn't come to perfection
[42:02] hallelujah so it takes something more
[42:04] than just spirit
[42:06] [Music]
[42:08] it takes the word and the spirit
[42:12] so god sent the prophet with the word
[42:14] and the pentecostal rejected the prophet
[42:17] and to this day they still have all the
[42:18] gifts they had since way back then
[42:21] because you cannot come to perfection by
[42:22] gifts
[42:25] come on now come on now
[42:28] not your preaching gifts not your
[42:29] teaching gifts not your not your not
[42:31] your tongue speaking gifts
[42:32] you have to only come to perfection by
[42:34] the word jesus christ
[42:38] hallelujah you have to be caught in that
[42:42] perfection
[42:56] i feel blessed this morning to know out
[42:58] of millions of people
[43:00] not then i come to this message you know
[43:02] that i've been called to perfection
[43:05] it's a little more than just come into
[43:06] this message in an endless call to this
[43:08] message
[43:09] but praise god have no perfection that
[43:11] they're getting from it at all
[43:13] they have interpretation
[43:16] so the pentecostal
[43:20] did not could not take the word
[43:23] that brings discipline
[43:26] to be formed into the word image
[43:29] that god would approve sons
[43:33] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[43:35] pleased
[43:37] remember when brother bryan went through
[43:38] someone in pentecost he told he was
[43:39] among angels
[43:41] all supernatural and power of god this
[43:44] was the spirit of god and whatnot until
[43:46] a vision broke
[43:47] and he saw one of those gifted men
[43:49] living with somebody else who was not
[43:50] his wife
[43:52] then that toy meant a spin what on
[43:55] earth is this it was the genuine holy
[43:58] ghost
[43:59] it was genuine spirit operating but
[44:02] something was wrong in the inner man
[44:06] so he went into the cave to ask god what
[44:09] is this
[44:11] and the god opened the scriptures hebrew
[44:14] six i believe it was to show him the
[44:15] rainfall
[44:16] on the just and the unjust amen it's the
[44:19] holy ghost
[44:20] but the seed is not there it produces a
[44:22] different life
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:25] come on now come on now
[44:28] so it's not just spirit but a seed
[44:32] which is the word so then he had to
[44:34] reveal son of man
[44:36] who is the sower of the seed
[44:39] oh hallelujah so we today have a
[44:42] revelation
[44:43] of the words of the son of man come on
[44:46] now come on now
[44:47] come on now that's why we can quote it
[44:50] that's why we can preach it that's why
[44:52] we can stay with
[44:53] it because this is not the words of a
[44:55] man
[44:57] it's the revealing of the son of man
[45:04] oh hallelujah
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:07] some people say we can't preach we had a
[45:09] cold rap we can't preach
[45:11] um no quote no no we can't preach oh
[45:13] yeah we can't preach i can't preach
[45:15] i don't have my own message when the
[45:17] angel came in with the book open that
[45:19] was the message
[45:20] i am not the angel i didn't bring down
[45:22] the book i didn't open the book i
[45:23] couldn't look upon the book
[45:24] only lamb was worthy he took the book he
[45:27] opened the book he loosed the seals
[45:29] and he gave it to the prophet who gave
[45:30] it to us
[45:32] hallelujah
[45:36] did you get that he gave it to our
[45:38] prophet to give it to us
[45:40] and now we stand here in the book
[45:42] prophesying from the book
[45:44] because the word said prophesy again
[45:49] bring back the prophecies so you are
[45:52] sitting today under a seventh under
[45:53] revelation
[45:54] that gave us the insight of the seeds to
[45:58] show
[45:58] for seven thunder manifestation oh give
[46:01] the lord a shout our praise
[46:03] you're not sitting here in vain you're
[46:05] not believing here in vain
[46:06] you actually under a servant under
[46:08] inspiration
[46:10] that brings light on the word to show
[46:12] what seeds to show
[46:14] for our seven thunder manifestation in
[46:16] other words you have got this morning
[46:18] a capstone revelation waiting for a
[46:21] capstone manifestation
[46:23] nothing going to stop it daniel already
[46:27] saw the stone
[46:28] cut it without the hands of man no money
[46:30] bringing the stone
[46:32] oh i'll give the lord a scream a shout
[46:35] in the house

[46:44] ministers super preachers big preachers
[46:47] mighty men are all kinda gonna bring it

[46:50] after all these 50 plus years because
[46:52] they can't bring it
[46:55] no man could bring dynamics if they got
[46:58] to send it
[47:00] dynamic is going to be a reaction to our
[47:01] action
[47:03] oh glory to god did you hear what i said
[47:05] [Applause]
[47:08] oh
[47:12] [Applause]
[47:14] [Music]
[47:17] god deliberately shut up the heavens
[47:23] and loose sun's in the earth say sons of
[47:27] golden last days they're going to unlock
[47:28] the heavens
[47:29] have supporters unlock you know
[47:32] hallelujah is atmosphere talking to
[47:33] atmosphere
[47:35] that's why she is telling tyri in the
[47:36] upper room until he be drew with power
[47:39] from on him
[47:40] and revelation always brings stimulation
[47:42] and the reason the people not excited
[47:44] and in the spirit because they really
[47:45] lack revelation they have intellectual
[47:47] understanding but when you get
[47:49] revelation
[47:50] it makes you get excited it makes you
[47:52] get stimulated
[47:53] wine is revelation water is water but
[47:56] wine give it up
[47:59] oh yes oh yes oh yes
[48:03] why make you misbehave yourself this
[48:05] time i stagger a little bit
[48:07] you must stand up a little bit you can
[48:08] find a raising hand a little bit
[48:10] you might see him say smiling you don't

[48:17] drinking man

[48:22] because we're smiling with revelation
[48:25] that god made a promise
[48:27] he's going to bring it to pass
[48:36] you wanna be seated i didn't give your
[48:38] house burning last night
[48:40] if god gave revelation you'd be shouting
[48:41] this morning because another house is
[48:43] coming
[48:44] somebody stole your cat another cat
[48:45] coming you lose your job have a next job
[48:47] dear

[49:04] [Applause]
[49:09] i now realize i haven't given you the
[49:10] title
[49:13] my goodness the title is perfected
[49:15] forever
[49:16] them that are sanctified
[49:19] that's the title perfected forever them
[49:22] that are sanctified
[49:24] subject coming into that perfection
[49:28] inspiration let us go on to perfection
[49:32] so i know i didn't finish the message i
[49:33] didn't get in the message last week
[49:34] actually
[49:35] last week it was just like a call
[49:37] introduction
[49:39] also hoping that this morning we could
[49:41] get on into it
[49:43] praise god so but abandoned prophesied
[49:47] that the unfolding of the sevenfold
[49:49] mysteries of god
[49:51] would bring on another ephesians
[49:54] in ephesians what we read today
[49:58] we have a promise of a fightful ministry
[50:00] of pastor prophet teacher evangelist
[50:02] apostle
[50:03] plus the perfecting of the saints
[50:06] so god himself put the perfecting of the
[50:09] saints
[50:09] in ephesians he himself put it there
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:14] so we can't go around it we have to go
[50:16] into it all right
[50:18] in other words perfection will be in
[50:21] another ephesians
[50:22] that is the promise therefore the
[50:25] anointing
[50:27] will be only upon the promises
[50:32] the seeds that was promised for the
[50:34] bride
[50:35] i could stand here and give you
[50:37] information about
[50:38] time magazine jews israel that's not the
[50:41] promise of the bribe
[50:43] we can explain the vials the wars the
[50:45] plagues the woman and the sun
[50:47] between the first round is seven vial
[50:49] sex violence seven vile
[50:50] and one of those stuff that's not what
[50:53] we're here for
[50:55] [Applause]
[50:59] the seeds that are promised to the bride
[51:02] therefore all men's ideas
[51:05] all men's interpretation of what the
[51:08] prophet said would die
[51:10] every group every church that twists and
[51:13] turn and interpreted it will die
[51:16] the only thing that would stand is those
[51:19] that stand on the promises
[51:22] as the prophet said it and spoke it
[51:25] because peter said by these promises we
[51:28] become partakers
[51:30] of the divine nature
[51:35] so what the prophet came to introduce
[51:37] was a land of promise
[51:39] it's the holy ghost land of promise in
[51:42] the form of word
[51:44] word on top of word on top of where on
[51:46] top of words
[51:51] [Applause]
[51:53] as far as the devil is concerned you
[51:55] wasting time coming to church
[51:57] because that's fine what he's seeing
[51:59] you're not producing anything
[52:00] but he's a liar he don't understand what
[52:03] god is doing
[52:08] this is what the devil don't get my word
[52:13] shall not return unto me boy
[52:17] what did child accomplish
[52:19] [Applause]

[58:46] oh my god i'm in my own world here this
[58:48] morning
[58:49] i'm in my own world here this morning he
[58:51] said that great circle
[58:53] that chain of perfection was broken by
[58:56] time space
[58:58] time came because of sin
[59:02] the circle was eternity but time broke
[59:05] it
[59:06] listen to these words let's see a
[59:07] perfect circle
[59:09] and my wife was a little hicky a little
[59:11] drop in the chain
[59:12] eternity continues on but it's not
[59:15] in perfect condition there's a little
[59:17] gap
[59:19] breaks over this way god had to do that
[59:23] because satan caused it and it dropped
[59:25] down to space of
[59:27] time for trying and the perfecting and
[59:32] the persian of the loss
[59:40] remember remember we bypass our tiophony
[59:44] to be put on earth to be tested
[59:48] and tried that's why time space come on
[59:52] there's a purpose of times peace to get
[59:55] us perfected
[59:57] because when the devil kicked that
[59:58] little kick kicking and and we broke
[1:00:00] into time space we have to get back into
[1:00:02] eternity
[1:00:05] we cannot go back to eternity perverted
[1:00:09] we have to go back to eternity perfect
[1:00:11] but he has perfected forever
[1:00:17] them that are sanctified so you're going
[1:00:19] to understand why jesus died to bring
[1:00:21] blood
[1:00:24] my god forgive me
[1:00:27] i'm excited this morning jesus died to
[1:00:29] bring blood
[1:00:31] sanctifying blood blood that you could
[1:00:33] understand when he looked through that
[1:00:35] blood
[1:00:35] he don't see your thoughts he don't see
[1:00:37] your mistakes he don't see your failures
[1:00:40] he see you perfected
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:00:54] perfection guaranteed
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] okay so watch god had to do that
[1:01:01] because it didn't cause it to drop down
[1:01:03] to space time for the trial
[1:01:05] and the perfecting and the position of
[1:01:07] the loss that
[1:01:09] god by sovereign grace might someday
[1:01:12] lift that little hiki or gap back into a
[1:01:15] perfect circle
[1:01:16] then she rolls on just the same time
[1:01:20] now time is this little loop it loops
[1:01:23] down
[1:01:24] jesus was from eternity to eternity but
[1:01:27] he stepped into time space
[1:01:29] and was made flesh and came through here
[1:01:33] in order to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:01:37] blood all across the place
[1:01:39] to redeem it to connect it back to god
[1:01:42] for eternity you help me my god i feel
[1:01:46] like going across the horizontal rainbow
[1:01:48] my god i feel like that oh man this
[1:01:51] place don't have enough room for me this
[1:01:52] morning
[1:01:53] did you hear what he did jesus broke
[1:01:55] through time space
[1:01:57] come down here to bring the blood to
[1:01:59] redeem us
[1:02:00] to reconnect us back or to that ah
[1:02:04] and i cashed out this morning my god
[1:02:08] hallelujah
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:17] you see that's all time is
[1:02:20] then god when it started here the little
[1:02:23] kink in a perfect circle
[1:02:25] a little kink in it when god started
[1:02:27] here he was perfect
[1:02:29] everything was perfect everything he
[1:02:31] does is perfect
[1:02:32] now look before oh my goodness
[1:02:36] before are you ready before he ever put
[1:02:40] the printed word
[1:02:45] this is the mind of god here it is
[1:02:48] this is the mind of god that he thought
[1:02:51] before the foundational world was ever
[1:02:52] laid that's the reason he could put it
[1:02:55] on printed word
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:58] and say what it would be because you saw
[1:03:02] it
[1:03:03] before the foundation
[1:03:10] it's like you're reading the novel the
[1:03:13] novel of past personal future in it
[1:03:16] if it's a mystery book you could go on
[1:03:17] the end and see who who do what who's
[1:03:19] the mystery the person
[1:03:20] you don't want to read the whole thing
[1:03:21] you wouldn't get the joy of it of course
[1:03:23] who done it you go to the end and say oh
[1:03:26] okay
[1:03:27] she she done it close the book there is
[1:03:29] no joy whatsoever
[1:03:31] because why you are out of the book but
[1:03:34] you could read present in the book
[1:03:36] pass in the book future in the book
[1:03:38] that's god
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:42] because he is an eternity he could see
[1:03:45] past presence and future
[1:03:46] your future is already done god requires
[1:03:49] a thing that i pass
[1:03:51] my god your victory already won glory
[1:03:54] the quad
[1:03:56] halal you're already healed my already

[1:04:24] shout

[1:04:33] before the function of the world and
[1:04:35] knew just what it would be
[1:04:37] and spoke it out and he handed down his
[1:04:40] knowledge to the prophets
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:46] so heaven consists of the word so
[1:04:48] because god had foreknowledged
[1:04:50] he could drop back in time and the word
[1:04:51] of the lord came under his eye
[1:04:53] saying
[1:04:56] the word of lord came unto jeremiah
[1:04:58] seeing him so these men had the gift
[1:05:01] to go up into the space of god and pull
[1:05:03] down knowledge of god
[1:05:05] speak to the people prophesy son of man
[1:05:07] to prophesy what those seers
[1:05:09] i looked and i saw and i prophesy give
[1:05:12] them the gifts of vision and so on
[1:05:14] god have his people he has to get the
[1:05:16] word to the people because that's to how
[1:05:17] you're going to be redeemed
[1:05:19] you can be redeemed by his word why
[1:05:21] because you are thought
[1:05:23] and the word comes to express you the
[1:05:26] word come to connect with you
[1:05:28] so i do carefully as a professor if
[1:05:30] you're a gardener a farmer
[1:05:31] a kitchen worker i don't care what you
[1:05:33] are the world has to come to you

[1:06:18] gospel of jesus

[1:07:28] aren't you happy this morning to be a
[1:07:31] people called out
[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:38] you may be seated you see
[1:07:41] you see the others out there don't know
[1:07:42] the end from the beginning we don't in
[1:07:44] that sense
[1:07:45] but we know all things work together for
[1:07:46] good oh yes
[1:07:48] they see the self making more money
[1:07:50] getting more cars
[1:07:51] getting more houses i'm doing on killing
[1:07:53] the life out and they have seen 60
[1:07:55] coming for them 70 80
[1:07:56] and then they're sure they will see 90.
[1:08:00] and that encounter the same god we're
[1:08:02] preaching about here right now every day
[1:08:04] every day every sunday we preaching
[1:08:05] about that same god
[1:08:13] but if they cross that barrier and meet
[1:08:15] him
[1:08:16] they meet in him who we preaching about
[1:08:19] therefore if you get in contact with him
[1:08:22] and him call you
[1:08:23] you should be the most shouting
[1:08:24] individual in this building
[1:08:27] this morning because only who we phone
[1:08:30] you
[1:08:34] who he found you who is on you
[1:08:38] be called
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:46] but mine you may see that if i could
[1:08:48] sing this in your heart
[1:08:50] this morning the next stage of that and
[1:08:53] who he called
[1:08:54] he justified if that could hit you this
[1:08:57] morning
[1:08:58] you'd be running up and down this
[1:08:59] building justified
[1:09:01] it's as if you never did it as if it
[1:09:04] never fell
[1:09:05] as if he never sinned as if he never
[1:09:07] failed
[1:09:08] if you could get there this morning this
[1:09:10] was one of the most powerful churches
[1:09:13] on this island
[1:09:22] you may decide because justification
[1:09:25] will be clear to you
[1:09:26] before you could see perfection
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:32] because you are perfected forever them
[1:09:34] that are sanctified
[1:09:35] because when you understand this
[1:09:37] justification you would want to be
[1:09:39] perfectly completely sanctified to
[1:09:41] please him
[1:09:43] who has called you
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:55] every priest stand let me just read
[1:09:58] something here
[1:10:01] i want to read the amplified of that
[1:10:02] scripture we read from hebrews 10.
[1:10:05] furthermore every human priest stands at
[1:10:07] his altar of service
[1:10:09] ministering daily offering the same
[1:10:12] sacrifices over and over again
[1:10:16] which never are able to strip
[1:10:19] from every side of our sins that envelop
[1:10:23] us from taking them away
[1:10:25] what a vain sort of thing same
[1:10:28] sacrifices
[1:10:29] same sacrifices and you know no results
[1:10:35] in a certain sense wasting time
[1:10:39] whereas this one christ
[1:10:43] not some pastor not some bishop of
[1:10:45] canterbury
[1:10:47] not some pope this man christ
[1:10:51] after he offered a single sacrifice
[1:10:58] no i like how they describe a minute
[1:11:00] because they compared it to all them
[1:11:01] bloods and bulls and all them they
[1:11:02] often yeah and yelled yeah and yelled
[1:11:04] that not doing the work
[1:11:07] it's just giving a conscious well
[1:11:08] something take my place you know
[1:11:10] the lamb dead the ox killed
[1:11:15] i was supposed to go there but they
[1:11:16] killed that one so next year they had to
[1:11:18] kill the next one again
[1:11:20] because my heart deceitfully corrupt
[1:11:24] there was no power to bring a change
[1:11:26] within the heart system
[1:11:30] this man offered a single sacrificial
[1:11:32] sins
[1:11:33] that shall reveal for all time
[1:11:36] and sat at the right hand of god
[1:11:41] waiting for his enemies
[1:11:44] should be made stool on these feet you
[1:11:46] know they're coming
[1:11:51] that's the confidence of the blood
[1:11:53] that's the confidence of the world

[1:12:08] then fellas trembling before them
[1:12:09] clearing
[1:12:11] and no no wrong number two out they go
[1:12:13] because he said he's the greatest
[1:12:15] i ain't tell you to go and say the
[1:12:16] greatest now all i'm telling you is to
[1:12:18] believe what god said
[1:12:20] and you have to believe it so bad it
[1:12:22] slipped from your conscious into the
[1:12:23] subconscious
[1:12:24] [Applause]

[1:12:29] subconscious level

[1:24:19] see them in christ they're going to get
[1:24:22] in christ
[1:24:23] or i'll say it this way brahma said when
[1:24:25] the bride gets a revelation of
[1:24:26] opposition
[1:24:27] in the word in christ in other words
[1:24:30] there's two things happening here
[1:24:31] the word coming to you and you have to
[1:24:33] come to the word and you have to come
[1:24:35] into position to recognize who you are
[1:24:37] you're no longer a son of a uh uh mr mrs
[1:24:41] branham he said whose son am i now
[1:24:43] it was something was breaking into whose
[1:24:45] son of my know
[1:24:49] whose daughter are you now so when you
[1:24:52] break out of this family stuff
[1:24:55] that is so limited and you break into
[1:24:58] your sonship
[1:24:58] stuff you see peter was slowly getting
[1:25:02] it
[1:25:04] that's why people can say lord is that
[1:25:06] as you beat me to come
[1:25:08] because you're talking to me so long it
[1:25:10] looks like whatever you do i could do
[1:25:11] too
[1:25:12] come on now you don't hear what i'm
[1:25:13] saying come on come on preach back to me
[1:25:16] somebody
[1:25:17] peter a cinnamon say lord is that you
[1:25:19] beat me to come
[1:25:20] because i look like whatever you could
[1:25:21] do we could do too because you say we
[1:25:23] are sons of god
[1:25:24] and i want to do what you do and call me
[1:25:27] i ain't going all day on my own but you
[1:25:28] call me
[1:25:29] i ask you to believe if you call me i
[1:25:30] can do it too come on see me somebody
[1:25:33] come and give the lord a shout in the
[1:25:38] house
[1:25:41] well jesus said come amen and peace has
[1:25:44] to come
[1:25:45] walking on water
[1:25:49] no people putting glass and water
[1:25:51] hunting and walking on it and me because
[1:25:53] who can impersonation thing like if
[1:25:54] they're walking in the water
[1:25:55] then when you check out it's something
[1:25:56] like lasting the per day humans again
[1:25:59] trying to
[1:26:00] get some kind of notice
[1:26:04] talk about impossible impersonators
[1:26:07] people looking like trying to walk like
[1:26:08] like walking in the air like
[1:26:10] that chokers
[1:26:15] and right now you know what we're doing
[1:26:17] we're leaping over unbelief

[1:26:46] devil can't even try to bring back
[1:26:47] things to your mind

[1:30:30] isn't that right
[1:30:31] and here comes samuel after all them
[1:30:33] parried before him in a prayer line

[1:36:31] it's a genuine message it is real
[1:36:35] god sent a real prophet oh hallelujah
[1:36:41] remember when samuel was walking down to
[1:36:43] the village what are the elders i'm
[1:36:45] saying comments the whole piece to play
[1:36:49] because when a prophet comes on a scene
[1:36:51] is judgment
[1:36:53] it's a word from the lord men the
[1:36:55] trumpet when a prophet come
[1:36:57] but they don't come in with permission
[1:36:58] and and they have to go and take her
[1:36:59] back before they speak you know
[1:37:01] however they are they come you know long
[1:37:04] beard rugged looking stick
[1:37:06] oh looking but once they come down
[1:37:08] they're balling dust here they'll you
[1:37:09] better
[1:37:09] shake and trembling because god is with
[1:37:12] those men
[1:37:15] the only answerable to god no king no
[1:37:18] potential only god
[1:37:21] now the prophet said the church is no
[1:37:23] longer the voice of god
[1:37:25] so god going to turn against her he said
[1:37:27] there's another people
[1:37:29] in the land under the messenger
[1:37:33] which will only have one you only have
[1:37:35] one messenger
[1:37:36] not two one three and four everybody
[1:37:38] want to be their own private messenger
[1:37:40] but that i know what the prophet said
[1:37:41] under their messenger will be the final
[1:37:44] voice
[1:37:45] to the final age he said once more the
[1:37:48] world will get direct from god
[1:37:50] that's not on books and tapes
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:37:53] that is not books and tapes hallelujah
[1:37:57] once more the world will hear direct
[1:38:00] from god
[1:38:01] because the voice of god will be in her
[1:38:02] bride not some man speaking
[1:38:06] it's going to be god speaking the voice
[1:38:09] of the archangel
[1:38:10] will be in a pride seven living voices
[1:38:15] all glory to god hallelujah
[1:38:19] hallelujah there is going to be a
[1:38:21] manifestation
[1:38:23] of seven living voices that's the
[1:38:26] thunder they're gonna shake the devil
[1:38:28] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:32] glory to god amen
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:51] listen listen the law couldn't make
[1:38:55] anyone perfect
[1:38:58] perfection without a revelation is
[1:39:01] legalism
[1:39:03] that is what it has rampant especially
[1:39:04] in trinidad
[1:39:06] legalism trying to legislate
[1:39:09] righteousness
[1:39:10] or legislate perfection you can't do it
[1:39:14] it has failed it has to come by christ
[1:39:19] through christ by the blood
[1:39:22] through the blood that is what it's all
[1:39:24] about
[1:39:26] oh man because if what we do could make
[1:39:30] us perfect
[1:39:31] christ didn't have to die
[1:39:34] or give the lord a shout in the house
[1:39:38] did you get that it's very long dress
[1:39:42] and wearing tie
[1:39:43] and wear your hair long could make you
[1:39:46] perfect what what was the problem guys
[1:39:47] dying
[1:39:48] just wear long dress wear long tie wear
[1:39:51] long hair and you're good to go
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:02] my sister came up to me she said i want
[1:40:04] to show you her coat
[1:40:06] she generally quoted her she said i said
[1:40:09] i know it
[1:40:10] she said you know that i said yes she
[1:40:12] said nah i don't know
[1:40:23] now she's a bullhead she's disrespectful
[1:40:27] and i know it but she's trying to check
[1:40:30] my spirit
[1:40:31] to see if what she's seeing what she's
[1:40:33] seen in me what if i've seen it too
[1:40:37] so she could judge me by what she read
[1:40:39] in a book
[1:40:41] because she find this in a church and
[1:40:42] that nature at that time
[1:40:44] she didn't say you know church like a
[1:40:45] backseat
[1:40:47] i said i said the jewish i say better
[1:40:50] check yourself you must be back to it
[1:40:53] the world changed accident
[1:40:56] now that is that is how bad it comes
[1:40:58] where people could judge
[1:41:01] you can't judge a church by an
[1:41:03] individual
[1:41:05] that's crazy you can't judge somebody
[1:41:09] if there's somebody come and say they
[1:41:10] find this one find out you're the only
[1:41:12] person the visitor
[1:41:13] you're the only person baptized the only
[1:41:14] person is a real believer
[1:41:16] you don't need to put no coming back you
[1:41:18] don't even know
[1:41:19] and you're judging she's supposed to
[1:41:21] look so who's supposed to look
[1:41:23] when god called you how you were looking
[1:41:25] you was recognized
[1:41:31] when god called you was smelling nice he
[1:41:33] was recognized
[1:41:35] he wasn't born in sin he was born
[1:41:36] somewhere else he was born in the
[1:41:38] hospital
[1:41:42] well brethren whether you're born in
[1:41:43] hospital or in a bed
[1:41:45] in a mother house you were still born in
[1:41:47] sin
[1:41:49] leading the blood of jesus
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:57] so ika god knows i have a problem with
[1:42:00] men men
[1:42:01] men playing god
[1:42:06] men men playing god and people shaken
[1:42:09] under fear because they fear the man
[1:42:13] if you come against a man just go strike
[1:42:15] you that will strike you that will
[1:42:16] strike you
[1:42:18] all that's striking is fear
[1:42:24] not fear god you know and the preachers
[1:42:27] come and be praying pulpit they want to
[1:42:28] put the fear of god in the heart of the
[1:42:30] people
[1:42:33] and what end up happening is you fear
[1:42:35] the man in the heart of the people
[1:42:37] not the fear of god if you have man
[1:42:39] because we have to work with love
[1:42:42] let me continue friends
[1:42:46] there are so many things we could say
[1:42:47] tonight about the perfection
[1:42:50] we are always trying to gauge all the
[1:42:52] eyes of somebody else
[1:42:54] to make ourselves just a little holier
[1:42:57] than they are
[1:43:00] but if we only look at the picture it is
[1:43:03] only god's grace
[1:43:05] that we are what we are
[1:43:15] so nobody should come in here and feel
[1:43:17] uncomfortable
[1:43:19] no one should come here and feel like
[1:43:20] somebody looking down at them
[1:43:22] just look up at them if they
[1:43:26] look down at you look up at them i say
[1:43:28] what you playing
[1:43:32] anybody playing that up there will tell
[1:43:35] them the steps
[1:43:36] to come down come for you
[1:43:39] you have to come down and walk with all
[1:43:41] the rest of us
[1:43:43] out of the building you can't stay up
[1:43:46] there
[1:43:47] and float up there in some and that's
[1:43:49] the whole point everybody would
[1:43:50] want to be one up i'm ahead of you
[1:43:54] i am better than you i am more than you
[1:43:59] what is it god requires perfection
[1:44:03] he requires your repentance he requires
[1:44:06] your loyalty to him
[1:44:08] he's looking tonight no matter how much
[1:44:10] you have sinned no matter how much
[1:44:13] how little or how much you are still a
[1:44:18] sinner
[1:44:20] i seen this small and my brother here
[1:44:23] next door
[1:44:24] he's still in big sur
[1:44:28] so you have seen measurement now one
[1:44:31] half a centimeter sin i want to have two
[1:44:33] feet
[1:44:34] and that is another corner she had three
[1:44:35] feet a sin i don't talk about the
[1:44:37] brother behind here four feet
[1:44:38] and the other one you kind of count the
[1:44:40] other common yards and miles
[1:44:44] but big sin and small sin
[1:44:47] in god's sight the same sin
[1:44:51] could we give the lord a praise
[1:44:56] so big sin needs blood and small sin
[1:45:00] needs blood
[1:45:01] because god is perfect
[1:45:05] that's what the blood came for to bring
[1:45:08] that perfection
[1:45:15] so no matter how much your sin how
[1:45:17] little how much you're still a sinner
[1:45:19] and cannot get in no other way but by
[1:45:21] jesus christ
[1:45:22] god all sufficient sacrifice and in him
[1:45:25] you're perfected forever think of it
[1:45:27] it's nothing you do
[1:45:30] it's not new pages you turn it's not a
[1:45:34] new life you start
[1:45:35] it's a confession of your wrong and
[1:45:38] god's grace to you
[1:45:40] that brings you to perfection and then
[1:45:42] you are perfected in
[1:45:44] christ jesus
[1:45:49] wow
[1:45:56] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:45:58] perfection you have to be perfect to get
[1:46:00] there
[1:46:01] the bible said so it's a perfect kingdom
[1:46:04] it must be a perfect people come
[1:46:06] because you have to stand to be married
[1:46:07] to the perfect son of god
[1:46:09] and you must be a perfect bride amen
[1:46:12] so how can you do it through anything
[1:46:14] else but the perfect word of god
[1:46:16] the waters of separation that watches us
[1:46:18] from sins the blood of jesus christ
[1:46:21] think of it the dripping bloody word
[1:46:24] i love that description the bloody wood
[1:46:27] when you leave here this morning
[1:46:28] you must feel that dripping bloody wood
[1:46:30] upon your life
[1:46:32] you're not supposed to leave it with
[1:46:34] condemnation you're supposed to leave
[1:46:36] here
[1:46:37] even with a possibility of being
[1:46:39] restored
[1:46:40] being made whole be my will i can't
[1:46:42] solve every problem i'm not a
[1:46:43] psychologist or psychiatrist
[1:46:44] but god knows your problem god knows
[1:46:46] your situation and god love and care
[1:46:48] enough for you that
[1:46:49] that his spirit can withdraw you to come
[1:46:51] here this morning
[1:46:52] that you could be edified and blessed
[1:46:55] that you could be helped and you could
[1:46:56] be strengthened
[1:46:57] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:46:59] lord do you believe that
[1:47:01] oh glory to god thank you lord
[1:47:11] so therefore we are perfected
[1:47:15] absolutely spotless and blameless not
[1:47:17] one sin on us
[1:47:18] are you above temptation never do you
[1:47:21] sin every day yes sir but yet we are
[1:47:23] perfected
[1:47:24] because we are in him and god could no
[1:47:26] more judge
[1:47:27] us than nothing he already judged us in
[1:47:29] him
[1:47:30] when he judge christ he judged me he
[1:47:32] judge you he can't judge me again
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:40] that's the revelation that's the
[1:47:43] revelation
[1:47:45] that's the revelation that's the
[1:47:47] revelation
[1:47:49] christ was judged we were in him we have
[1:47:52] already been judged
[1:47:55] therefore this morning you are free
[1:48:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:08] denver i wish i had the voice of your
[1:48:10] angel to bring you to a place where you
[1:48:13] could see it
[1:48:14] you have to see it then you are free
[1:48:17] oh glory to god woman go and sing no
[1:48:20] more
[1:48:21] who the son of man set free
[1:48:25] is free indeed
[1:48:33] glory you may be seated
[1:48:37] this has been a tough one to really get
[1:48:40] through
[1:48:41] last week struggling i have 16 pages i
[1:48:43] don't want page three
[1:48:45] so you know i ain't get very far
[1:48:48] but brannon the god of this world is on
[1:48:51] satan eden
[1:48:54] the god of this world today the worship
[1:48:58] person of this world today is satan
[1:49:00] and the people are ignorant of
[1:49:03] worshiping satan
[1:49:05] it's satan impersonating himself as the
[1:49:08] church
[1:49:10] no this is deep this is not skim milk
[1:49:13] this is not the developer there were no
[1:49:14] two horn and red with a big fork
[1:49:17] we could see that one because that is
[1:49:20] him
[1:49:21] but this one here is one we want to
[1:49:23] focus on
[1:49:27] it is satan impersonating himself as the
[1:49:30] church
[1:49:31] they worship satan thinking that they
[1:49:34] are worshiping god
[1:49:35] through the church aha so now
[1:49:39] it come back now to what it really is so
[1:49:42] then
[1:49:42] they love their church they love what
[1:49:45] they see they love their dreams they
[1:49:47] love what they
[1:49:48] feel they love their emotions they don't
[1:49:51] love the word when they would come
[1:49:52] because the word checks them the word
[1:49:54] always come to check you
[1:49:56] that's what they would come to check me
[1:49:57] i'm not saying this to you you know
[1:49:59] i'm hearing it just like you do you know
[1:50:01] some of the things i'm hearing for the
[1:50:02] first time you know
[1:50:03] some of the things that jamming just the
[1:50:05] same you know but i've got to speak it
[1:50:08] i still have to say it i can't hold back
[1:50:11] because
[1:50:12] i've got to speak it still
[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:20] watch they worship satan thinking they
[1:50:23] are worshiping god through the church
[1:50:25] but it's the way sitting down and the
[1:50:26] way you say wait a minute we preached a
[1:50:28] word
[1:50:29] look back here at my text tonight satan
[1:50:32] was the one
[1:50:33] that preached the word to eve first he
[1:50:35] said god had
[1:50:36] said it was a misconstruing that part of
[1:50:40] the scripture
[1:50:41] that applies to the day he would let you
[1:50:44] know all jesus did was perfectly well
[1:50:46] he will let you know what all moses they
[1:50:47] were perfectly well when you take the
[1:50:49] promises that they give for this day
[1:50:50] then that was applied to another age
[1:50:53] people
[1:50:54] ignorantly worshipping satan thinking
[1:50:56] they are worshipping god
[1:50:58] as we are warned by prophecy and this is
[1:51:01] on paul and first
[1:51:03] thessalonians we beseech you brethren by
[1:51:05] the coming of the lord jesus
[1:51:06] and by the guardian they get of him the
[1:51:08] coming of the lord garden of him
[1:51:10] that yet you be not soon shaking or
[1:51:12] troubling spirit on your mind
[1:51:14] let no man receive you by any means for
[1:51:16] that day shall not come
[1:51:18] except the come are falling away
[1:51:21] first we're not talking about
[1:51:22] backsliding falling away now
[1:51:25] we're talking about a following from god
[1:51:27] and far away from the word
[1:51:29] are following from the promises are
[1:51:30] following from prophetic utterance
[1:51:32] are falling from that yes
[1:51:39] until the management be revealed he said
[1:51:40] now this deceitfulness of the church
[1:51:42] today
[1:51:43] the son of perdition now people
[1:51:45] worshipping satan in his this day
[1:51:47] thinking the worshiping god now let's
[1:51:49] let him tell us what that is
[1:51:51] they are worshiping him to a creed
[1:51:56] we believe this did he prophesy that no
[1:51:58] you can't find it but it revealed
[1:52:00] it's a hidden mystery well hide it from
[1:52:03] me please
[1:52:04] keep that one hidden watch
[1:52:08] their worship and through a creed are
[1:52:11] man-made denominations
[1:52:13] and queens that brought the people right
[1:52:15] down to the greatest deception that the
[1:52:17] world has ever known
[1:52:18] no matter how much the word of god
[1:52:20] promised for this day is preached and
[1:52:21] vindicated
[1:52:22] they still won't believe it you own this
[1:52:25] people
[1:52:27] we believe in signification and you're
[1:52:29] taking your own
[1:52:30] you just quit this and quit that unless
[1:52:32] christ
[1:52:33] opened the door and quickly to your
[1:52:36] heart
[1:52:36] and you come to a place where sin is
[1:52:38] dead and his eyes all gone
[1:52:39] it's self-righteousness
[1:52:43] so the next bottom right here the only
[1:52:45] close button right here they dress down
[1:52:47] to their ankle
[1:52:48] and they're holding these people and
[1:52:49] they don't press the hair and they don't
[1:52:50] wear makeup and they don't wear earrings
[1:52:52] they don't when they're doing that but
[1:52:53] that is the only self-righteousness
[1:52:55] until christ comes into your heart
[1:52:58] doesn't matter if you
[1:53:00] wear camel skin
[1:53:04] and you come out of the wilderness and
[1:53:06] you have beard for days
[1:53:08] christ is still in your life that's john
[1:53:11] about this
[1:53:13] hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah
[1:53:17] are you with me how can we be perfect
[1:53:20] true death of christ is not church
[1:53:23] joining
[1:53:24] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:53:26] when the new word come in
[1:53:28] you are changed you don't have to do
[1:53:30] anything to prove it
[1:53:31] your life proves it as you walk you will
[1:53:35] love
[1:53:35] peace long suffering gentleness meekness
[1:53:37] patience that's what you are
[1:53:40] and the whole world sees the reflection
[1:53:42] of christ
[1:53:43] in you but abraham i've seen visions
[1:53:47] sick healed dead rays when they were
[1:53:49] laying out there doctors walk away
[1:53:50] they are finished and go on lady a
[1:53:52] couple of hours and which will come back
[1:53:54] and show a vision go down there and
[1:53:56] raise that person up
[1:53:57] death dumb blind crippled walk that is
[1:54:00] not it that's just
[1:54:01] attributes
[1:54:05] oh hallelujah paul said we'll do all
[1:54:08] this but lay all that aside now
[1:54:09] let's go into perfection the church
[1:54:12] cannot be perfected through
[1:54:14] organizations
[1:54:15] it's get further away from god all the
[1:54:18] time
[1:54:19] or further away from each other we draw
[1:54:21] barriers we separate ourselves
[1:54:23] seemingly not having a faith and then we
[1:54:25] leave those principles of the doctrine
[1:54:27] if we move on to perfection then those
[1:54:29] little things become of nothing much use
[1:54:32] all right you see a cling tongue saw
[1:54:35] reduction doctrine doctrine
[1:54:37] but when you start to go to perfection
[1:54:38] them sword play account
[1:54:42] dealing with the bull is what counts
[1:54:44] dealing with the maniac man is what
[1:54:46] counts
[1:54:47] dealing with the bees is what comes and
[1:54:49] doctrine
[1:54:50] can't cut down the bull doctrine casting
[1:54:54] back the bees
[1:54:56] it will take perfection to do that
[1:54:58] [Applause]
[1:55:01] hallelujah so love came over him and
[1:55:04] then he tell the bull stop
[1:55:05] he loves and the bees love dealt with
[1:55:07] this love what is that
[1:55:09] that is perfection
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:12] but this is deep he said we go into a
[1:55:14] relationship
[1:55:15] and we find out the only way that we can
[1:55:18] be perfected is to be in christ
[1:55:20] we find out then by the teachings of the
[1:55:23] bible
[1:55:24] that's not how we get into christ not by
[1:55:27] water baptism
[1:55:28] not by leaning on hands not by teaching
[1:55:30] not by teaching
[1:55:31] but by one spirit we are baptized into
[1:55:34] one body
[1:55:35] and become perfected through a suffering
[1:55:37] then we look different we think
[1:55:39] different we act different
[1:55:40] we live different not because it's a
[1:55:42] duty or we belong to church
[1:55:45] but because the love of god is shed
[1:55:46] abroad
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:48] in your heart
[1:55:53] the love of god strike your heart
[1:55:55] charity bear it all things
[1:55:57] saw you so hasty you need charity
[1:56:00] amen got it exposing your haziness to
[1:56:03] say you're here he's easy
[1:56:04] no can i show you your need because
[1:56:07] charity
[1:56:08] suffered long and is kind it doesn't
[1:56:11] puff itself up
[1:56:12] it's not easily provoked and believe it
[1:56:15] all things that
[1:56:16] hope it all thinks it enjoyed all things
[1:56:18] charity never feel it
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:22] all right could we take a little more
[1:56:26] they gotta take a little more because
[1:56:26] i'm not finished yet until more is a
[1:56:29] holiday
[1:56:30] caught here caught here
[1:56:33] caught you red-handed you thought you
[1:56:35] was going to escape.
[1:56:38] all right okay here we go now
[1:56:41] god was this great spirit we pictured
[1:56:44] him a circle
[1:56:46] curvature of the earth but god is
[1:56:48] eternal
[1:56:50] he was the perfect perfect love perfect
[1:56:53] peace perfect joy
[1:56:54] perfect satisfaction here we go are you
[1:56:57] ready
[1:56:58] all those seven spirits as we get into

[2:07:33] i pray that i will seek daily
[2:07:36] without ceasing until i feel
[2:07:40] every one of these requirements flowing
[2:07:44] in this statue of minds till i
[2:07:47] can become a manifestation
[2:07:50] of the living christ for he became sin
[2:07:53] like me here we go
[2:07:54] that i might become righteous of god
[2:07:56] like him
[2:07:57] he took my place lord let me take his
[2:08:01] now
[2:08:02] because that's the purpose he died for
[2:08:05] how many will pledge the same thing
[2:08:12] i know you raise your hands but i want
[2:08:14] to read it again
[2:08:16] for you to know what you're pledging to
[2:08:18] he said i pledge this morning to him
[2:08:20] with all my heart that by his help and
[2:08:23] by his grace
[2:08:24] i pray i will seek daily without ceasing
[2:08:27] until i feel every one of these
[2:08:29] requirements
[2:08:30] flowing that's the whole difference
[2:08:32] flowing in this statute of minds
[2:08:34] till i become a manifestation of the
[2:08:36] living christ
[2:08:37] for he became sin like me that i may
[2:08:39] become russians of god like him
[2:08:41] he took my place lord let me take his
[2:08:44] now
[2:08:44] because that's the purpose he died for
[2:08:46] how many will pledge the same thing
[2:08:49] by the grace of god oh how i pledge it
[2:08:53] lord
[2:08:54] this church pledges it the full stature
[2:08:57] of jesus christ
[2:09:04] oh hallelujah i can't stop know how to
[2:09:06] finish this here now
[2:09:08] hallelujah so jesus
[2:09:11] he the spirit of god dwelt in the
[2:09:13] fullness of jesus christ
[2:09:15] jesus was the word and the words
[2:09:18] was invisible now listen close the word
[2:09:21] was invisible
[2:09:23] until it was made flesh then the word
[2:09:26] becomes
[2:09:26] visible so when you begin to see visible
[2:09:30] evidence and manifestation
[2:09:32] of god in our midst it would mean
[2:09:35] that the word is becoming flesh because
[2:09:39] as the word becomes flesh
[2:09:40] the invisible becomes visible
[2:09:44] you're gonna see god you're going to see
[2:09:47] god
[2:09:48] let me prophesy you will see god you
[2:09:51] will see the invisible
[2:09:53] become visible right in front of your
[2:09:55] eyes
[2:09:56] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory
[2:10:00] to god oh hallelujah so this invisible
[2:10:03] god
[2:10:04] is the word amen
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] ministry of the word but the visible
[2:10:10] going to be the ministry
[2:10:12] of the spirit from the guide around the
[2:10:15] holy spirit
[2:10:16] watch remember faith and virtue now
[2:10:19] remember the holy spirit
[2:10:21] cannot cap the building of god
[2:10:24] until these things are operated by the
[2:10:26] spirit
[2:10:27] he didn't say by revelation he didn't
[2:10:29] say by intellect
[2:10:30] he said the virtues you have to begin to
[2:10:32] operate by the spirit
[2:10:33] when that begins upon your spirit is
[2:10:35] subconscious behavior
[2:10:37] is nazis are coming to oh gosh a nice
[2:10:39] smile
[2:10:40] god bless your sister no that's you
[2:10:42] operating it
[2:10:43] doesn't operate by the spirit upon the
[2:10:45] spirit means it's thundering
[2:10:47] it's flowing it's living through you you
[2:10:50] can't even help it
[2:10:53] no i didn't read the story when bahrain
[2:10:56] said we're all trying to gorge
[2:10:57] somebody's eyes
[2:10:58] but he had an experience he went to a
[2:11:00] restaurant
[2:11:01] and there was a woman there in the
[2:11:03] middle age
[2:11:04] short pants on talking with some man
[2:11:07] music playing
[2:11:08] and he said god is this a place that
[2:11:10] you're going to raise up my children to
[2:11:12] be in why don't you condemn this place
[2:11:14] he felt a tap on his shoulder god pulled
[2:11:16] him to the side
[2:11:17] broke a vision upon him he saw himself
[2:11:19] as a child all the sins he doing and
[2:11:21] whatnot
[2:11:22] his sins come up to god he saw the blood
[2:11:24] of jesus as a bumper pushing it off
[2:11:26] he saw a book with all his sins in it
[2:11:28] and god mark pardon
[2:11:29] potency of forgetfulness and then go
[2:11:31] tell him i forgive you and you condemn
[2:11:36] her
[2:11:38] no i know preachers don't preach about
[2:11:39] that dinner because
[2:11:41] so much condemnation going on they they
[2:11:43] don't want to hear about that
[2:11:46] god told him i you condemn my life i
[2:11:49] forgive you
[2:11:50] god nothing more again nothing more
[2:11:53] nothing more that's testification
[2:11:55] let's see what he's going to do now so
[2:11:57] he comes to the woman i said woman
[2:11:58] listen
[2:11:58] listen listen i was just condemning you
[2:12:01] and i was saying this and saying that
[2:12:03] god show me this
[2:12:04] you want to break on tears she said i
[2:12:06] was a christian
[2:12:07] and this happened that happened on a
[2:12:09] backslidden and whatnot
[2:12:10] and right there on the floor they
[2:12:12] kneeled down in the floor
[2:12:13] in the restaurant and that one was
[2:12:15] restored back
[2:12:16] right there on the floor because the man
[2:12:19] gets a revelation
[2:12:20] that the blood is not only for him
[2:12:28] come on now come on now
[2:12:31] some people might walk inside that i
[2:12:33] want to see the woman carrying on so you
[2:12:34] walk back out
[2:12:35] not me and that banner not me on that
[2:12:36] restaurant
[2:12:39] but the experience changed brother
[2:12:42] madam's perspective
[2:12:44] to see through the eyes of god
[2:12:49] god don't see as man sees
[2:12:53] that's the problem today i
[2:12:56] don't have it here but but abandon said
[2:12:58] how would god take these
[2:13:00] unlimited fishermen to put them in
[2:13:03] ministries for the perfecting of the
[2:13:05] saints
[2:13:07] why would god bypass the theological
[2:13:11] exploits in the book of moses
[2:13:14] in the form of pharisees and sadducees
[2:13:16] who already know the word
[2:13:18] them listening to tapes since they're
[2:13:20] youth
[2:13:24] them reading scriptures from sunday
[2:13:25] babes these sins are the talk
[2:13:27] they need lineage of scriptures so it
[2:13:30] would have been sensible
[2:13:31] to get these educated scripture taught
[2:13:34] people
[2:13:35] to take on the ministry but god don't
[2:13:37] think the way man thinks
[2:13:40] god went first find people who was never
[2:13:42] in no scriptures peter was just
[2:13:44] i mean i know smoking grass whether it
[2:13:46] is smoking and drinking or whatever it
[2:13:48] is peter was just a fisherman
[2:13:50] and god said i come to call you to fish
[2:13:52] for men
[2:13:53] not not them fishermen thing different
[2:13:55] kind of fish come come come
[2:13:57] i'll make you a fisher of men come
[2:13:59] follow me
[2:14:00] james follow me philip follow me
[2:14:04] ordinary man that's collected too nobody
[2:14:07] loves exactly collector
[2:14:08] nobody likes caesar to come and contact
[2:14:10] from them but jesus make sure he picked
[2:14:12] that one too
[2:14:13] come come come come follow me too
[2:14:18] he set it up so so that they have the
[2:14:20] friends who they like to be following
[2:14:22] jesus
[2:14:23] jesus do you pick him
[2:14:26] if jesus said peter pick pick 12. peter
[2:14:30] pick family relatives friends all
[2:14:31] parents
[2:14:32] partners everybody i follow you jesus
[2:14:34] jesus and let peter pick him
[2:14:35] that's why he let them ministers do not
[2:14:37] pick him no convention do not picking
[2:14:40] they know brotherless and brother that
[2:14:42] apostles and personality
[2:14:43] prophets and prophet had no dominion
[2:14:44] picking he will do the choosing
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:53] look look look look look look holy ghost
[2:14:55] fell man upper room holy ghost fell upon
[2:14:57] them staggering what not the first thing

[2:18:22] that the ministry of perfection where
[2:18:26] the offices where the apostles
