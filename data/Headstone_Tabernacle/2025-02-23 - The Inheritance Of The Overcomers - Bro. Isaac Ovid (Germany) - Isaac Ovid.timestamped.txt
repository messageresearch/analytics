[1:11:59] morning something that will be
[1:12:02] said to encourage you along the
[1:12:06] journey can the church say
[1:12:08] Amen so for a title this
[1:12:11] morning the
[1:12:13] inheritance of the
[1:12:15] Overcomers the
[1:12:17] inheritance of the
[1:12:19] Overcomers so there are two things in
[1:12:22] there we are speaking to Overcomers
[1:12:26] because you are born to
[1:12:27] overcome and you're not just
[1:12:30] overcoming to say that you're an
[1:12:32] overcomer but you are
[1:12:35] overcoming and there's a reward for
[1:12:40] overcoming and that
[1:12:42] reward is your
[1:12:44] inheritance so we are speaking about the
[1:12:48] inheritance of the
[1:12:49] Overcomers can the church say amen and
[1:12:53] brother brandham told us
[1:12:55] Hallelujah that you got to have
[1:12:57] something to
[1:12:59] overcome just to be here this
[1:13:02] morning you had to
[1:13:04] overcome you had to overcome your
[1:13:07] bed to get up this morning you had to
[1:13:10] overcome the
[1:13:12] driving to come to church this morning
[1:13:16] life is about
[1:13:18] overcoming you had to
[1:13:20] overcome maybe you felt
[1:13:22] tired but you had to overcome that you
[1:13:25] had to overcome your
[1:13:27] feelings sometimes you don't feel
[1:13:29] good sometimes you feel like giving up
[1:13:33] but because you are an
[1:13:35] overcomer you overcome your
[1:13:37] feelings you overcome your thoughts you
[1:13:41] overcome your ideas you overcome what
[1:13:44] the devil says you overcome your
[1:13:47] past you overcome your

[1:13:53] morning a testimony I that you're an
[1:13:57] overcomer you can't help
[1:14:00] yourself because
[1:14:02] overcoming is built into you it's a part
[1:14:06] of you you were born to overcome can the
[1:14:10] church say
[1:14:11] Amen oh

[1:14:17] Lord so you're an
[1:14:20] overcomer and you have an
[1:14:22] inheritance Hallelujah
[1:14:25] God always
[1:14:26] knew that there would be
[1:14:29] promises for
[1:14:31] Overcomers Adam did not have anything to
[1:14:35] overcome so he could not have
[1:14:38] claimed a
[1:14:40] reward because he didn't have to
[1:14:42] overcome can the church say Amen Adam
[1:14:45] had no
[1:14:47] trials Adam had no
[1:14:49] testings Adam had no
[1:14:51] mistakes he had no problems he didn't
[1:14:55] have issues in his home he didn't have
[1:14:58] issues on his
[1:14:59] job because he was a perfect
[1:15:01] man but when man fell he had something
[1:15:05] to
[1:15:06] overcome can the church say Amen oh
[1:15:10] blessed be the name of the Lord what are
[1:15:12] you saying God has created
[1:15:16] situations for you to be an
[1:15:19] overcomer brother brandham said when
[1:15:22] speaking about adoption he said he could
[1:15:25] turn your wife against
[1:15:27] you he could turn the church against you
[1:15:31] he said I stomped
[1:15:32] him what is he doing he is looking for
[1:15:36] Overcomers you could overcome
[1:15:39] anything and you could stand
[1:15:42] alone there's no group
[1:15:45] overcoming you overcome as an
[1:15:48] individual you overcome as an
[1:15:51] individual if nobody else wants to
[1:15:54] worship
[1:15:56] you
[1:15:56] worship because you an
[1:15:59] overcomer if no one else want to
[1:16:02] believe you believe because you're an
[1:16:06] overcomer can the church say Amen oh
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:12] hallelujah
[1:16:14] hallelujah
[1:16:16] hallelujah in the Bible it says over and
[1:16:20] over in the Book of Revelation to him
[1:16:23] that overcometh to him not overcome it
[1:16:26] to him not overcome it you've got to
[1:16:28] have something to overcome you have to
[1:16:32] overcome that's how you have a
[1:16:34] victory you cannot have a
[1:16:37] victory unless you have a battle so
[1:16:41] thank God that you're in a
[1:16:43] battle oh can the Church Say Amen
[1:16:58] church if you're not in a battle this
[1:17:01] morning you should be very
[1:17:07] worried can the church say Amen if all
[1:17:10] hell is not against you you should be
[1:17:13] very worried because there's a seed in
[1:17:16] your soul brother brandham said you are
[1:17:19] not the believer but the seed in there
[1:17:23] that seed is the believer
[1:17:26] and everywhere you go the devil is
[1:17:28] seeing that seed there's a light over
[1:17:32] you when you woke up this morning that
[1:17:35] light was over you it's connected to the
[1:17:38] seed and that seed is going to bring
[1:17:42] forth after its kind there is nothing
[1:17:47] nothing P nothing present nothing to
[1:17:51] come that will stop you you an
[1:17:56] Overcomer false Doctrine could not keep
[1:17:59] you back what happened in the past
[1:18:03] couldn't keep you back your mistakes
[1:18:07] could not keep you back what people said
[1:18:10] about you could not keep you back can
[1:18:14] the church say
[1:18:16] Amen born to
[1:18:19] overcome you're an overcomer you may be
[1:18:23] seated it's built into
[1:18:26] you you are walking
[1:18:28] today you walked into the house today
[1:18:32] but when you are a
[1:18:33] baby you couldn't walk you creeped for a
[1:18:37] while you maybe stood up a little bit
[1:18:40] and you fell back down but no baby has
[1:18:45] ever stayed
[1:18:46] down when they fell back down it's built
[1:18:50] into
[1:18:51] them
[1:18:52] nobody has to tell a baby
[1:18:55] try again it's built into them they know
[1:19:01] that they are born to
[1:19:03] walk they know that
[1:19:07] creeping is
[1:19:09] temporary they know that they are born
[1:19:12] to speak when they are baby they are not
[1:19:16] speaking yet but the moment they see
[1:19:20] their mama speaking something in them
[1:19:24] tell tells them I'm going to do it too
[1:19:28] and something in US tells us we are
[1:19:32] going to be like him we have seen our
[1:19:35] father we have seen our names we have
[1:19:39] seen who we are and the devil cannot
[1:19:42] change
[1:19:45] it
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:51] Hallelujah you may be seated it's too
[1:19:54] late devil we have seen too much this
[1:19:58] message is too real we have seen too
[1:20:02] much we have believed for too
[1:20:06] long I might have my UPS I might have my
[1:20:10] downs but the seed in me that seed of
[1:20:14] predestination is bigger than your
[1:20:17] problem the seed in you is more powerful
[1:20:21] than your situation the seed in you is
[1:20:26] bigger than your trial the seed in you
[1:20:30] is bigger than the
[1:20:31] devil greater is he that's in you than
[1:20:36] he that's in the
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:42] world you may be
[1:20:47] seated Revelation
[1:20:50] 3 verse 5 to him that over
[1:20:55] overcometh not to him that comes to
[1:20:58] church not to him that's in the message
[1:21:01] not to him that read the books not to
[1:21:04] him that listen to the tapes but to him
[1:21:07] that overcome it to him that overcome
[1:21:11] the internet to him that
[1:21:13] overcome
[1:21:15] gossip for him that overcome
[1:21:18] lust him that overcome
[1:21:20] lying him that overcome
[1:21:23] backbiting to him not overcome it the
[1:21:27] same shall be clothed in white
[1:21:30] rment and I will not
[1:21:33] blot out his
[1:21:36] name of the book of life but I will
[1:21:39] confess his
[1:21:40] name before my father and before his
[1:21:45] angels can the church say Amen this is
[1:21:48] the mighty Angel the Lord himself he is
[1:21:52] looking for one person who is willing to
[1:21:56] overcome
[1:22:01] everything you may be seated so I'm not
[1:22:05] preaching to church members this
[1:22:12] morning I'm not preaching to message
[1:22:16] Believers the Bible tells me to him that
[1:22:20] overcometh I'm preaching to
[1:22:22] Overcomers I'm looking at
[1:22:25] Overcomers I'm watching
[1:22:28] Overcomers you know the devil is
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:36] afraid there's more power in your little
[1:22:41] finger than what the devil
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:49] has the Bible says you are more than
[1:22:52] conquerors
[1:22:56] friends it is a
[1:22:58] comfort to know that the Bible could
[1:23:02] say I'm a conqueror but the Bible
[1:23:05] doesn't say that it says you are more
[1:23:08] than
[1:23:11] conquerors not just
[1:23:13] conquerors you are more than
[1:23:16] conquerors when you sleep at night you a
[1:23:20] conqueror you wake up in the morning
[1:23:23] you're a conqueror
[1:23:25] can the church say
[1:23:29] [Applause]
[1:23:35] Amen from the message how can I
[1:23:41] overcome brother brandham
[1:23:43] said you've got to have something to
[1:23:48] overcome and what and what I might need
[1:23:50] to
[1:23:52] overcome would be different
[1:23:55] from what you need to
[1:23:56] overcome but we are all
[1:23:59] Overcomers what might bother
[1:24:01] you may not affect your
[1:24:05] sister but God could still
[1:24:08] say you are an
[1:24:10] overcomer your
[1:24:12] trial may not be my
[1:24:15] trial your test may not be my test but
[1:24:20] every one of us will go through a test
[1:24:24] and will be tested and we'll be tested
[1:24:27] and
[1:24:28] friends when you're in school to go to
[1:24:32] the next
[1:24:33] class the next level you have to pass
[1:24:36] the
[1:24:37] testest from one level to go to the
[1:24:40] higher level you've got to pass the test
[1:24:44] from high
[1:24:45] school to go into
[1:24:48] University when you're in
[1:24:50] University they're not going to give you
[1:24:54] a high school
[1:24:57] test can the church say Amen because you
[1:25:00] already did that when you're in
[1:25:04] University you supposed to get a
[1:25:06] University
[1:25:07] test and we are in the final
[1:25:10] age this is the last age there's no
[1:25:14] other age this is the highest
[1:25:18] University brother brandham is waiting
[1:25:20] on
[1:25:21] us the sleeping Saints are are waiting
[1:25:24] on us so we have some big
[1:25:27] tests because when we pass this test
[1:25:31] there's coming power there's a power
[1:25:34] that's coming to the
[1:25:36] Overcomers can the church say
[1:25:39] Amen you may be
[1:25:41] seated no wonder the prophet preach that
[1:25:46] power without character is satanic
[1:25:50] because God wants to make sure that when
[1:25:53] he gives you power
[1:25:55] you could handle
[1:25:58] it could you imagine if God give you
[1:26:02] power 10 years
[1:26:04] ago 15 years ago for some of you five
[1:26:07] years ago you knew how you were 5 years
[1:26:11] ago you knew how you were 10 years
[1:26:14] ago but all of our
[1:26:18] experiences all of the tests and
[1:26:21] trials has brought us to this spot
[1:26:24] because you're gonna have a final
[1:26:26] test you're GNA have a final test can
[1:26:30] the church say
[1:26:32] Amen you remember the
[1:26:34] prophet when that couple came into the
[1:26:39] Tabernacle that was a test for the
[1:26:41] prophet the Lord told the prophet
[1:26:44] whatever you
[1:26:45] say if you say blindness whatever it is
[1:26:49] and what did the prophet do he had the
[1:26:52] power to speak any
[1:26:55] but something in him maybe realized it
[1:26:58] was a test and he said I forgive you
[1:27:03] Hallelujah for many of us we preach
[1:27:06] about
[1:27:08] overcoming and it's not a physical
[1:27:12] thing for some of us it's just to say
[1:27:14] I'm
[1:27:15] sorry for some it's just to say I
[1:27:17] forgive
[1:27:18] you for some to say I love
[1:27:21] you and you overcome yourself
[1:27:25] you overcome your feelings you overcome
[1:27:28] what you're going through can the church
[1:27:30] say
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:36] Amen brother brandham goes on in that in
[1:27:38] that
[1:27:40] message brother mam said this call is
[1:27:43] not to the
[1:27:45] church he said it's he that overcome
[1:27:49] it the
[1:27:51] individual that will overcome
[1:27:54] friends as a Believer you must be able
[1:27:57] to stand
[1:28:00] alone if nobody else is standing with
[1:28:02] you God has never called out
[1:28:05] groups but from in the
[1:28:08] groups there's one over there there's
[1:28:11] one over there that's the Overcomer
[1:28:14] because overcoming keeps life in you
[1:28:17] come the Church Say Amen
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:26] notice overcome with the brandham said
[1:28:29] the god that's in
[1:28:31] you is greater than the one that's in
[1:28:34] him the God of this world is not as
[1:28:38] great as the god of
[1:28:39] Heaven
[1:28:41] Darkness cannot stand in the presence of
[1:28:45] light brother Bram said I don't care how
[1:28:48] dark it is light will put it
[1:28:51] out can the Church Say Amen
[1:28:57] Glory he that had an
[1:28:59] ear let him hear what the spirit is
[1:29:03] saying to the
[1:29:04] churches the spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:29:08] spoke in every
[1:29:09] age and that same holy spirit is
[1:29:13] speaking in every
[1:29:14] service that same voice the voice of the
[1:29:19] Archangel the voice of power is speaking
[1:29:22] to Overcomers
[1:29:24] speaking to the seed because this flesh
[1:29:26] is
[1:29:27] trouble but the seed in you is built to
[1:29:31] overcome we need to bring our
[1:29:34] bodies under
[1:29:36] subjection to obey our
[1:29:39] confession from the word seed because
[1:29:42] when you're in the right
[1:29:44] atmosphere the seed can only do one
[1:29:47] thing reproduce
[1:29:49] itself so take
[1:29:52] courage because you could not even be
[1:29:54] here unless there's a seed in
[1:29:57] you do you know how difficult it is for
[1:30:02] someone to just walk into
[1:30:06] this you canot just walk into the
[1:30:10] message it takes God to call
[1:30:13] you one in a
[1:30:15] million one in a million you don't just
[1:30:19] walk into this thing if God did not
[1:30:22] predestinate you you could never see it
[1:30:26] and if you see this message you should
[1:30:29] thank God that he put your name in the
[1:30:32] book and he made a way for
[1:30:36] you oh
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:41] hallelujah what a joy to know that
[1:30:45] almighty God before there was a world
[1:30:49] before there was a trial you were on his
[1:30:52] mind and he knew based on for knowledge
[1:30:57] that nothing will take you away from
[1:31:00] this can the church say Amen many people
[1:31:04] walked away but here you are still an
[1:31:08] overcomer Still Standing you might be
[1:31:12] tired but you're still standing you may
[1:31:15] have been here for a long time but
[1:31:17] you're still standing come to church say
[1:31:20] Amen you may be seated
[1:31:25] brother Henry good to see you God bless
[1:31:27] you
[1:31:29] friends Caleb can we talk about Caleb a
[1:31:32] little
[1:31:33] bit
[1:31:34] Caleb was one of the 12
[1:31:38] men who was
[1:31:41] identified to go and see if the land was
[1:31:44] a good
[1:31:46] land can the church say Amen Redemption
[1:31:50] is in two parts it's coming out of and
[1:31:54] going into so they were shouting and
[1:31:57] rejoicing because they came out of
[1:32:00] Egypt but God didn't bring them out of
[1:32:03] Egypt to have them
[1:32:05] circling he wanted these
[1:32:08] Overcomers to have an
[1:32:11] inheritance and they came to a
[1:32:14] crossroad where they say we got to send
[1:32:16] some people
[1:32:17] over to see if this land we heard
[1:32:21] about if it is as good as they say it
[1:32:26] is we have heard the preaching for many
[1:32:29] years that there's a Promised Land but
[1:32:32] we haven't met anyone who has actually
[1:32:35] been there so they got some
[1:32:38] brothers they got 12 Brothers one from
[1:32:42] each
[1:32:43] tribe can the church say Amen when the
[1:32:46] tribe of Judah
[1:32:47] came and they had to pick one brother
[1:32:51] they picked a brother named brother
[1:32:52] Caleb
[1:32:54] brother Caleb was
[1:32:56] special because brother Caleb was not
[1:32:59] even born in the tribe of
[1:33:02] Judah do you know that Caleb the Bible
[1:33:06] said was a
[1:33:08] kenite Caleb was a gentile who was
[1:33:13] adopted into the tribe of Judah he was
[1:33:17] the first Gentile
[1:33:19] Warrior read the Bible Caleb was a type
[1:33:23] of this Bride As a gentile bride getting
[1:33:27] to eat of the same land that was
[1:33:31] promised to Abraham can the church say
[1:33:35] amen and those
[1:33:37] Brothers they were all
[1:33:40] Overcomers up until that point but when
[1:33:43] they went into the land 10 of them they
[1:33:47] looked around and they saw the Giants
[1:33:50] they didn't talk to the
[1:33:52] Giants they didn't interview the
[1:33:55] Giants they stood in the mountain maybe
[1:33:58] with some with some
[1:34:02] binoculars because the Bible says they
[1:34:05] said to
[1:34:06] themselves we are
[1:34:10] grasshoppers the Giants didn't tell
[1:34:13] them that you are
[1:34:15] grasshoppers they did an
[1:34:18] analysis and the
[1:34:20] conclusion of their
[1:34:22] analysis is is we are
[1:34:25] grasshoppers can the church say
[1:34:27] amen and these 10 men went back and
[1:34:32] brought a
[1:34:33] report it's too hard we cannot win too
[1:34:38] many Giants too much problems people
[1:34:42] have
[1:34:43] backslid some people don't believe we
[1:34:46] don't know how long it's going to be
[1:34:48] they had every
[1:34:50] excuse Caleb and Joshua they didn't go
[1:34:53] back with them because they were eating
[1:34:57] grapes they were eating the
[1:35:00] honey they were eating the
[1:35:02] food Caleb's
[1:35:05] clothes was grape
[1:35:07] juice ju Joshua's clothes was grape
[1:35:11] juice the land was a good land they came
[1:35:15] back late and they say we are more than
[1:35:19] able let us go up at once let us go now
[1:35:24] we can take the
[1:35:28] land you may be
[1:35:31] seated I want to encourage
[1:35:34] you we know the
[1:35:38] story because of
[1:35:41] unbelief do you know the Bible said that
[1:35:44] when Caleb and Joshua said we could take
[1:35:47] the land the people were so
[1:35:50] discouraged the Bible said they wanted
[1:35:53] to Stone
[1:35:57] them and because of
[1:36:00] unbelief they did not enter into the
[1:36:03] land and Caleb and
[1:36:06] Joshua had to walk around with these
[1:36:09] people until that whole generation died
[1:36:13] out can the church say
[1:36:15] Amen Caleb did not
[1:36:19] doubt Caleb always believed
[1:36:24] but he had to pay the
[1:36:26] price of the unbelief of the rest of the
[1:36:30] people friends it wasn't easy for
[1:36:34] Caleb think about it he always believed
[1:36:38] he was a True Believer and he had to
[1:36:41] walk in the
[1:36:43] wilderness with everybody else because
[1:36:46] everyone did not
[1:36:48] believe can you are you with me Caleb
[1:36:52] had every reason
[1:36:55] to have
[1:36:56] arts and
[1:36:58] grudges he had every
[1:37:00] reason because he tasted the
[1:37:02] land it took him 45
[1:37:06] years to come back to the
[1:37:09] land when he told
[1:37:11] Joshua you know the promise that was
[1:37:14] given to me about that mountain now
[1:37:19] therefore give me this mountain he say
[1:37:22] I'm still a strong
[1:37:25] as I was 45 years
[1:37:27] ago I'm not ready to give up
[1:37:30] now that's why I say
[1:37:33] Church many of you have been here a long
[1:37:37] time maybe like Caleb you believed for a
[1:37:40] long time don't give up the promised
[1:37:44] land is in view we are looking at it
[1:37:48] today now therefore give me this
[1:37:52] mountain can the Church Say Amen come on
[1:37:55] you
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:38:05] [Applause]

[1:39:21] this that's why more than once in
[1:39:25] scripture he said kill the
[1:39:27] babies because he knew that if these
[1:39:31] babies grow
[1:39:32] up what they will become and the devil

[1:42:24] so Jesus is saying as I
[1:42:27] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[1:42:30] in his
[1:42:31] throne so
[1:42:34] overcoming puts you in
[1:42:36] position to sit upon a
[1:42:39] throne can the church say
[1:42:42] Amen Revelation 2 verse1
[1:42:46] 17 he that had an
[1:42:49] ear let him hear what the spirit said
[1:42:52] unto the churches

[1:42:57] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:42:59] Hidden
[1:43:01] Manner and will give him a white
[1:43:04] stone and in the stone a new name
[1:43:08] written which no man knoweth saying he
[1:43:12] that receiveth
[1:43:14] it it's an individual
[1:43:16] Affair just for the
[1:43:19] Overcomers Again Church this is not for
[1:43:22] those who attend
[1:43:23] services this is not for the make
[1:43:26] believer this is not for the unbeliever
[1:43:29] this is for the True Believer who
[1:43:34] overcomes Revelation
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:39] 2:7 he that in here let them hear what
[1:43:43] the spirit say unto the
[1:43:46] churches to him that
[1:43:48] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:43:50] Tree of Life
[1:43:53] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:43:56] God that's only for the
[1:43:59] Overcomers Hallelujah Revelation
[1:44:04] 217 he that
[1:44:06] overcometh shall inherit all
[1:44:10] things and I will be his
[1:44:13] God and he shall be my son so only the
[1:44:19] Overcomers get to taste the
[1:44:21] inheritance come on you Overcomers our
[1:44:25] inheritance is close at
[1:44:28] hand Oh
[1:44:30] Glory so you'll see when you look at the
[1:44:35] scriptures every Church
[1:44:38] age had its
[1:44:41] identification of what was for the
[1:44:44] Overcomers now in this last day all of
[1:44:49] these
[1:44:50] promises are gathered for us
[1:44:53] all of the overcoming
[1:44:56] power all that is Promised in our season
[1:44:59] and time every promise wrapped up for
[1:45:03] the
[1:45:04] Overcomers of this age can the church
[1:45:07] say Amen what a glorious time to be in
[1:45:11] we are living in the best time we are
[1:45:13] living in the greatest time it's the
[1:45:16] greatest time for the
[1:45:17] believer it's the worst time for the
[1:45:20] world but it's the greatest time for the
[1:45:22] believer
[1:45:23] arise and shine for your light has come
[1:45:27] gross Darkness over the Earth but you
[1:45:31] are shining in the
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:35] darkness Amen to him that overcome
[1:45:40] it you may be seated in the message how
[1:45:44] can I
[1:45:45] overcome brother brandom said even in
[1:45:48] that worldly Wicked Church age
[1:45:53] that
[1:45:54] overcometh so it doesn't matter
[1:45:57] parents how bad the schools
[1:45:59] get what they teach our children
[1:46:02] now they would have never talked about
[1:46:05] years
[1:46:06] ago it's evil
[1:46:08] everywhere Satan is everywhere we are
[1:46:11] living in
[1:46:12] Sodom but in the midst of
[1:46:15] Sodom there is going to be
[1:46:17] Overcomers in the midst of evil there's
[1:46:20] going to be Overcomers we said it last
[1:46:23] night the devil could have most but he
[1:46:26] cannot have all I believe I'm speaking
[1:46:30] to Overcomers
[1:46:32] today
[1:46:38] Glory but the brandom goes
[1:46:40] on we find here that God has always had
[1:46:46] Overcomers he has had Overcomers in
[1:46:48] every
[1:46:48] age there's always every time
[1:46:53] in every age that there's been on the
[1:46:56] earth God has always had
[1:46:59] somebody he could put his hands on as a
[1:47:02] witness on the
[1:47:03] earth he has never been without a
[1:47:08] witness though sometimes just
[1:47:11] one but somebody
[1:47:13] overcome so maybe you are the only one
[1:47:17] in your neighborhood maybe you are the
[1:47:19] only one in your family maybe you are
[1:47:22] the only one in your home God will have
[1:47:26] a
[1:47:26] witness God will have somebody who will
[1:47:30] stand up for him can the church say
[1:47:34] Amen oh
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:41] Hallelujah Glory Glory
[1:47:44] Glory brother bam said in the days of
[1:47:48] Daniel there was four
[1:47:50] Overcomers there were four four
[1:47:53] Overcomers that could stand the test of
[1:47:55] fire and the
[1:47:58] lion I just want to make sure we have
[1:48:01] it because many people believe that
[1:48:05] coming into the
[1:48:07] Lord It's supposed to be an easy
[1:48:10] Journey we serve a great
[1:48:13] God and many people believe that we're
[1:48:16] not supposed to have
[1:48:17] trials and we're not supposed to have
[1:48:20] problems and everything is supposed to
[1:48:22] work out
[1:48:24] fine the Bible said all things work
[1:48:26] together for
[1:48:29] good but that's at the end of it through
[1:48:33] the process God will take you through
[1:48:36] trials so the
[1:48:39] earlier you get
[1:48:41] comfortable with trials and
[1:48:44] testings is the better you'll
[1:48:47] be it's easier for you to know there's
[1:48:51] another trial coming
[1:48:53] there's another test coming but God
[1:48:56] promised to never give us more than we
[1:48:59] could
[1:49:00] bear there's no trial that could ever
[1:49:04] come your way that you do not have the
[1:49:07] strength to
[1:49:09] overcome brother brandham said we are
[1:49:13] expected to be
[1:49:18] tested he that cometh to God must first
[1:49:21] be tested
[1:49:24] that shows a true
[1:49:27] child you heard that so being
[1:49:30] tested shows you a true
[1:49:33] child so take courage in the midst of
[1:49:37] your
[1:49:38] test friends when brother the Brandon
[1:49:41] preach an
[1:49:42] adoption and said he could turn the
[1:49:45] church against
[1:49:47] you does anyone want to volunteer for
[1:49:50] that
[1:49:54] you want to
[1:49:55] volunteer I don't think anyone wants to
[1:49:59] volunteer for a bigger
[1:50:02] trial no one wants to
[1:50:06] volunteer when brother brandham said
[1:50:07] missing limbs will be
[1:50:11] restored no one wants to
[1:50:14] volunteer to lose a
[1:50:17] li to fulfill that
[1:50:21] quote no one chooses to hard a
[1:50:25] trial it's it's it's not
[1:50:28] normal our nature is to choose the
[1:50:31] easier
[1:50:33] way if there's traffic on the
[1:50:36] road and this other road is
[1:50:39] clear no one looks at the traffic and
[1:50:43] looks at the clear Road and says I'm
[1:50:46] choosing
[1:50:48] traffic our nature will choose the EAS
[1:50:52] your
[1:50:54] road isn't that right most people on
[1:50:57] their
[1:50:58] jobs if the boss says I have a hard
[1:51:03] job and I have an easy
[1:51:05] job line
[1:51:07] up for who wants a hard job and who
[1:51:11] wants the easy job I can guarantee
[1:51:15] you're going to have a long line for
[1:51:17] those who want the easy
[1:51:19] job and maybe a short line
[1:51:23] on no
[1:51:24] line for the hard job it's not our
[1:51:29] nature to choose the hard
[1:51:32] thing but with our
[1:51:35] Prophet God could tell the prophet
[1:51:38] because thou has
[1:51:40] chosen the hard
[1:51:42] way can the church say
[1:51:45] Amen you chose the way of
[1:51:49] persecution you chose the way of
[1:51:51] rejection
[1:51:53] you chose the way of standing
[1:51:55] alone because thou has
[1:51:58] chosen so only the True
[1:52:01] Believers could choose the hard away
[1:52:04] because they know that they are
[1:52:08] Overcomers can the church say
[1:52:10] Amen you may be
[1:52:15] seated so young
[1:52:17] people don't get
[1:52:20] discouraged don't give into the peer
[1:52:22] pressure in the
[1:52:23] school it doesn't matter what's
[1:52:25] happening now it doesn't matter what
[1:52:27] they wear where they go what they listen
[1:52:32] to what they talk about if it's cool or
[1:52:35] it's not
[1:52:37] cool if everybody is doing it if you are
[1:52:41] the only one who's not
[1:52:43] going that's okay it's better to stand
[1:52:47] alone and be named with the
[1:52:51] Overcomers than to go with everybody
[1:52:54] else we are swimming
[1:52:58] Upstream all hell is against
[1:53:00] us but come on you're going to make it
[1:53:04] keep on swimming Keep On Believing keep
[1:53:07] on coming it's too late to backslide
[1:53:11] now it's too late to give up now can the
[1:53:15] church say
[1:53:20] Amen brother brandham goes on
[1:53:28] when the test is
[1:53:30] given it's to see whether you can
[1:53:32] overcome or
[1:53:35] not to him that
[1:53:38] overcometh the test is the greatest
[1:53:42] thing that ever happened to you could I
[1:53:45] say that one more time the test is the
[1:53:49] greatest thing that ever happened to to
[1:53:53] you when somebody lies about
[1:53:57] you and you know you're
[1:54:00] right and you have to forgive it's one
[1:54:03] thing if you're wrong but when you are
[1:54:06] right and people talk about you and
[1:54:09] because the reality is God Is Not
[1:54:12] testing
[1:54:13] them he is testing you can the church
[1:54:17] say Amen it's about you coming to
[1:54:21] maturity it is about your
[1:54:24] character being formed into the word
[1:54:28] image can the church say
[1:54:32] Amen brother brandham goes on he said
[1:54:34] Peter
[1:54:36] said our
[1:54:38] trials are worth more to
[1:54:41] us than precious
[1:54:45] gold you know it's easy to thank God for
[1:54:50] the good things but when
[1:54:53] last when last have you thanked God for
[1:54:57] the
[1:54:58] trials when last have you thank God for
[1:55:02] taking you through
[1:55:05] experiences that he in his
[1:55:08] wisdom have sent your away friends when
[1:55:12] certain doors don't
[1:55:15] open and you say it's a trial you don't
[1:55:18] know what God is protecting you from
[1:55:24] there are many things we
[1:55:26] want and we go to God and we say Lord I
[1:55:30] want this and I want this bless me with
[1:55:34] this bless me with
[1:55:36] this and God sees way down the
[1:55:40] road that if you get that thing you'll
[1:55:43] get in
[1:55:44] trouble and God closes the
[1:55:47] door and God point you somewhere
[1:55:51] else and we sometimes we don't thank God
[1:55:55] enough for closing doors we thank God
[1:55:59] for opening
[1:56:00] doors when we read the notes of Praise
[1:56:03] in
[1:56:04] church thank God for a new job thank God
[1:56:08] for healing thank God and that's the
[1:56:11] notes of
[1:56:11] Praise there are very few notes of
[1:56:14] Praises that say thank God because I
[1:56:17] lost the
[1:56:19] job you don't hear me this morning
[1:56:22] because many times God makes you lose
[1:56:25] the
[1:56:26] job to find him oh you don't hear me
[1:56:29] this
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:33] morning that's why the Bible says in
[1:56:37] everything give him
[1:56:39] [Applause]
[1:56:49] thanks I want this to help you Church
[1:56:54] you may be
[1:56:55] seated because it's
[1:56:58] easy to come to
[1:57:00] church and see the
[1:57:02] promises and to see the word and to see
[1:57:06] your name and to catch a
[1:57:08] revelation but the reality is we have to
[1:57:12] go to work on
[1:57:14] Monday deal with family issues on
[1:57:18] Tuesday deal with a bill on Wednesday
[1:57:22] visit the doctor on
[1:57:25] Thursday and talk to the neighbor who
[1:57:27] doesn't like us on
[1:57:30] Friday and that's about putting the
[1:57:33] word to the test because the word is not
[1:57:38] just
[1:57:39] information it is to change us so we
[1:57:43] could deal with the issues of
[1:57:46] Life can the church say
[1:57:49] Amen you may be seated this message
[1:57:53] didn't come for us to have church
[1:57:55] services it came to change our
[1:57:58] life so we could live
[1:58:01] better not just with those who we
[1:58:04] like but to live like
[1:58:08] Jesus love your
[1:58:10] enemies do good to them that hurt
[1:58:14] you speak good to them that speak evil
[1:58:16] about
[1:58:18] you the word still says turn the other
[1:58:21] cheek
[1:58:24] that's still the
[1:58:25] word can the church say Amen you love
[1:58:29] him this
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:38] morning we are born to
[1:58:42] overcome there are many of
[1:58:45] us we talk very
[1:58:48] nicely to the people in our
[1:58:51] jobs and we don't even treat the people
[1:58:53] in our
[1:58:56] homes the same way maybe that doesn't
[1:58:59] happen in
[1:59:01] Europe maybe that's just in my
[1:59:04] country but it's easy to treat people
[1:59:07] who are away from you
[1:59:12] nice and you disrespect your
[1:59:16] parents you talk terrible to your
[1:59:18] brother your
[1:59:21] sister you come to
[1:59:23] church and you can't hear
[1:59:25] anything because you don't
[1:59:28] like the seat they put you
[1:59:31] in simple
[1:59:33] things and all of these
[1:59:36] things are for you to overcome
[1:59:40] yourself there are people who can't sit
[1:59:42] in
[1:59:43] church because they want to sing a
[1:59:46] song and the Pastor said not
[1:59:49] today they heard nothing after that
[1:59:54] they sat in church for the whole
[1:59:57] service and they still don't know what
[1:59:59] was
[2:00:00] preached because in their heart they
[2:00:04] want to sing a
[2:00:05] song and God wants you to live beyond
[2:00:10] that not caught up in
[2:00:14] emotions this brother didn't shake my
[2:00:17] hand this sister didn't shake my hand
[2:00:22] this person said
[2:00:23] this this person did
[2:00:26] that friends
[2:00:29] overcoming it's not just overcoming
[2:00:32] sin it's it's easy to see when someone
[2:00:36] overcomes dressing
[2:00:42] right you wear your skirt the right
[2:00:45] way you don't cut your
[2:00:47] hair you don't go to the club you don't
[2:00:51] drink out
[2:00:52] alcohol but that's one kind of
[2:00:56] overcoming but many people have stuff on
[2:00:59] the
[2:01:00] inside that nobody
[2:01:02] sees and they haven't overcome that
[2:01:06] yet anybody with me this
[2:01:10] morning The Prodigal
[2:01:14] Son it would
[2:01:16] look like he was the one who was
[2:01:20] troubled he said Daddy
[2:01:23] I want everything that's
[2:01:25] mine everything you promised me I want
[2:01:29] it now the credit card the car the bike
[2:01:35] the money
[2:01:37] everything and the Bible said his father
[2:01:40] gave him
[2:01:41] everything and he went to a far away
[2:01:45] land and he lived for a
[2:01:47] while until his money ran
[2:01:50] out and when his money ran
[2:01:53] out he found
[2:01:56] himself working for someone raising
[2:02:01] pigs and as a
[2:02:03] Jew you don't work with
[2:02:06] pigs what's
[2:02:08] worse he ended up eating the pig
[2:02:13] food so that's as low as you could
[2:02:18] go until he had to overcome himself
[2:02:23] he said wait a minute in My Father's
[2:02:26] House father's the
[2:02:29] servants eat better than this the
[2:02:33] servants live better than this I'm not
[2:02:36] even
[2:02:37] worthy to be called a
[2:02:40] son I will
[2:02:42] arise I will overcome my
[2:02:46] pride I will overcome my
[2:02:49] failure I will overcome my mistake
[2:02:53] I will overcome what people will say
[2:02:54] about
[2:02:56] me I will overcome what they say I'm a
[2:03:00] failure and I will go
[2:03:02] back he did not
[2:03:05] know that his father was always looking
[2:03:08] out for him can the church say amen and
[2:03:12] as this boy began to walk back home his
[2:03:17] father looking from a distance he said I
[2:03:20] know that walk
[2:03:23] it's far
[2:03:24] away but that looks like my
[2:03:27] boy he said prepare a
[2:03:29] party get my
[2:03:32] robe call the Family kill the fatted
[2:03:36] calf because my
[2:03:39] son my son who was
[2:03:42] lost is now back
[2:03:45] home you may be
[2:03:47] seated friends I'm not trying to talk
[2:03:51] about the prodigal
[2:03:53] son I'm really trying to talk about his
[2:03:56] brother who was in church the entire
[2:03:59] time he never went to the
[2:04:02] world he was in church every
[2:04:05] Sunday helping with
[2:04:08] everything nobody
[2:04:10] knew what was in his heart because he
[2:04:14] was always there but when his brother
[2:04:16] came back
[2:04:19] home and he heard heard the
[2:04:23] music and he smelled the
[2:04:26] food he said what's going
[2:04:29] on well they said your brother just came
[2:04:33] back what did they
[2:04:35] cook what's on the
[2:04:39] menu well they cooked
[2:04:42] rice
[2:04:45] snitzer and they cooked
[2:04:49] Cal he said he said
[2:04:53] SCF he said the fatted
[2:04:56] one he said the one I've been
[2:05:01] feeding the one I've been taken care
[2:05:06] of and you know what he stayed outside
[2:05:10] of the
[2:05:13] church his father had to go out to
[2:05:16] him and say why aren't you inside the
[2:05:19] church
[2:05:22] don't you
[2:05:23] know that your brother was lost and now
[2:05:26] is
[2:05:28] restored why are you
[2:05:30] bothered by the
[2:05:33] celebration for your brother being
[2:05:36] delivered in other words only when his
[2:05:40] brother was
[2:05:41] delivered showed the issues he had in
[2:05:44] his
[2:05:45] heart that he had to
[2:05:48] overcome so
[2:05:50] Church you have to to be able to
[2:05:53] rejoice when someone else is being
[2:05:56] blessed or you don't hear me this
[2:06:01] morning you must be able to

[2:06:08] blessed you may be
[2:06:12] seated I don't know how I'm saying all
[2:06:14] of this this
[2:06:16] morning but you could be in a
[2:06:18] meeting in a
[2:06:20] convention and you see God dealing with
[2:06:24] someone and you could Wonder Lord why
[2:06:26] not
[2:06:28] me and you could actually end up with
[2:06:30] bitterness in your
[2:06:33] heart and you really can't Rejoice for
[2:06:36] them because you want it to be
[2:06:40] you there is nothing wrong with you
[2:06:43] wanting your
[2:06:44] blessing but you must be able to
[2:06:48] rejoice when God has delivered someone
[2:06:51] you must be able to rejoice when God has
[2:06:55] blessed
[2:06:56] someone it doesn't make you any less of
[2:06:59] a person when you rejoice when God

[2:07:57] church maybe you don't agree with
[2:08:00] everything but that's why you got to die
[2:08:02] out because maybe you're not seeing
[2:08:05] everything God puts a pastor in his
[2:08:08] place for a
[2:08:10] reason you can't see what the pastor
[2:08:13] sees can the church say Amen so God
[2:08:16] takes us through

[2:22:48] things can the Church Say Amen
[2:22:51] what we see and what God sees two
[2:22:54] different
[2:22:55] things when the Apostle
[2:22:58] Paul was
[2:23:00] Saul the world the church they saw him
[2:23:06] persecuting the
[2:23:07] church God was looking at the same man
[2:23:12] and when God saw him he saw a
[2:23:15] star in the right hand of God the world
[2:23:20] was seeing him one way and God was
[2:23:25] seeing him another way oh you don't hear
[2:23:27] me this
[2:23:28] morning church don't look at your
[2:23:32] present
[2:23:33] situation don't look at the situation of
[2:23:36] your
[2:23:36] children don't look at the situation of
[2:23:39] the
[2:23:40] church it does not matter what it looks
[2:23:44] like God has a vision and that Vision
[2:23:49] must come to pass
[2:23:51] God has a vision and that Vision must
[2:23:55] come to pass every
[2:23:58] prophecy that God gave through that
[2:24:02] Elijah Prophet must come to
[2:24:05] pass this morning and in this season we
[2:24:09] are walking in the prophetic
[2:24:12] Vision we could not be here unless God
[2:24:17] gave the prophet the word say sweet
[2:24:21] the words to
[2:24:24] speak Church you're overcoming it's not
[2:24:29] based on your
[2:24:30] strength your overcoming is not based on
[2:24:33] your ability but the word seed is so
[2:24:38] powerful it doesn't matter what you try
[2:24:41] to do to it that seed it's only going to
[2:24:45] do one thing reproduce
[2:24:48] itself and when it does
[2:24:51] it'll be Faith virtue knowledge
[2:24:56] Temperance patience godliness brly
[2:25:00] kindness charity the seed in
[2:25:05] [Applause]
[2:25:06] you what did the prophet say the word
[2:25:11] the word is in the bride too late devil
[2:25:15] too late devil the word is in the bride

[2:25:35] backslid that
[2:25:37] seed could only bring for it's just a
[2:25:40] matter of
[2:25:41] time and just like the prodigal son you
