morning service we have one scripture to read this morning from Ezekiel chapter 7 we want to read verse 1-9 welcome again we're so good to be here and also the youth service the youth Gathering we had yesterday was a very very blessing to be there and we want to read Ezekiel chapter 7 reading from verse one moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying also thou son of man thus sayeth the Lord God unto the land of Israel and end the end is come upon the four corners of the land now is the End come upon thee and I will send my anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine Abominations and mine ey shall not Speare thee neither will I have pity but I will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine Abomination shall be in the midst of thee and he shall know that I am the Lord thus sayeth the Lord God and Evil and only evil behold is come an end is come the end is come it watched for the behold it is come the morning is come unto thee Oh thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountains now will I shortly pour out my Fury upon thee and accomplish my anger upon thee and I will judge thee according to thy ways and I will recompense thee for all thine Abominations and my ey shall not spear neither will I have pity I will recompense thee according to thy ways and an Abomination that in the midst of the and shall know that I am the Lord that Smite it let us pray father we thank you for your word and God I just pray you just come down in a special way and take me out of the way and speak lip to air to your people this morning in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated Oh Praise godall I have a title this morning an end the end is come that's the title this morning am an end the end is come and brother Braham was praying I believe in perfect strength by Perfect weakness and he was saying there's only one thing left father that I can see that either you rise up somewhere with some empty vessels and make this world ashamed of itself or send Jesus right quick that the end is here Lord there are only two things left to be done and we must see it right away for we know it's at the end either we will see something rise right away or we will see the coming of the Lord all prophecies fulfilled the last thing before the church was resurrected before she was taken up in Revelation the 3rd Chapter there's a comfort of messenger unto the Lan Church age that would turn the hearts of the people back to the early fathers hear this part get them back to the regular p cost that they claim to have So This Heart of the fathers is not heart back to education or information is to what they had and the church was bued on the day of Pentecost when they received God in them it was God above them Pillar of Fire it was God with them in Jesus Christ and God came in them and they were living monuments of God not church people not church folks they were representing God their lives were declaring God and that is what this message come to do turn our hearts back to that that we can reflect God H not reflect embarrassment and compromise and shame and you know as Christians no not that reflect God like how he wanted to be C but Peter they had to take note that they have been with Jesus because they were manifest in Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God there were thousands time thousands like it wasn't there a Noah Lord would be lost many of them would be lost amen so we know that this book that came ration 10 wasn't wasn't a normal book that was a book of names that book had your names in it that was the title lead of the earth that was the authority that Adam had that Adam lost and because the devil couldn't catch it because he was kicked out of from heaven and fell on the earth he couldn't hold the deed to claim anything it went back in the hands of the original owner God himself waiting for who is worthy to take the book and no man was found worthy because all of us was born in sh and sa iniquity but Christ came and when he died he was worthy to take the book so he took the book and he dropped down on the earth to loose your name on the earth that God could find you all that the father ha given me will come so because your name was in the book you had to find you wherever you was in Trinidad you had to find you where is Hindu Muslim Baptist Methodist je witness Pentecostal he had to find you because you are not a musl Muslim a Hindu a Baptist a Pentecostal you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God oh give the Lord some praises and your last days God have promised all these churches he promised Sons and Daughters of God and if God make another son it will be a Son of God if God make another daughter it'll be a daughter of God that daughter and son must be born Supernatural not of the will of the flesh not of the will of men but of God oh glory to go say something have to happen to you and if it never happened to you it can happen to you today glory to God do you believe that so Seven Seals first seal second seal third seal ceas had a break and the seventh seal Revelation 81 silence and the prophet said this here now remember that this seven seal is the end of time of all things the things written in the seven sealed book sealed up the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends you see from a fundamental level Jesus died to save us and we are saved but it's a little deeper than that Jesus died to get back sons that he for new [Music] am in other words he died that he could bring on our justification and Justified doesn't mean forgiven Justified means you never did it amen Hallelujah we are only here because of Adam if Adam didn't fall we wasn't going to be fallen Adam fell we all fell but when Christ raised up we all raise [Applause] up so we only are here because of what Adam did you say well how God blaming us for what Adam did like one man fall and all of us fall well what did Christ do he was one man too but he paid the price to get us back so don't talk about Adam fall talk about Christ did something to get us back that we wouldn't be Sinners no more we could be he answer the sin question we could be free from sin he said woman go and sin no more who the son of man set free is free free from your past free from your fears free from your sins free from complexes your mother do your father a do this one do and that's going to help you forget that foolishness who son am I now oh give the Lord some praise mother was a drunker your father was a whatever it is it does not matter what your mother was what your father was you are here and you have to deal with that same devil that was kicked out of heaven you are here what are you doing about it I'm not talking about church I'm talking about inheritance I'm talking about what God raised you up [Applause] for do you understand all the money you make all the house Car Land everything you can take it with you do you that go and make us like you haulers you you hauling your goods behind you amen I a see nobody have a UL in in that box in that box just have a to hand to hold the down no no you hold no hook I for them who live for amen so this seven seed book that held the Plan of Redemption it is the end it is the end of struggling world it is the end of struggling nature it is the end of everything is there is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vows it even ends time a lot of people don't know time right now the angel already said time shall be no more here it is we are preaching something this morning that is a little beyond what you going through right now there are times we preach on things that you're going through and situations and whatnot but I want to challenge you this morning to catch up in God's thinking because we are in time he's in eternity he has a plan and whether you conscious or not or ready or not this plan moving on so always be in mind there's a mind of God that is at work even amidst your dire situation and you are crying for relief but there's a mind of God and a purpose of God that is beyond a b little thing because he know when every fly B ey you ever think about that every muskito fly God know exactly where they are every lion every goat every dog everything he knows about it he knows about all your problems and all situation but this God baptized the world in days of Noah this God Sanctified the earth when Jesus was here and this God is about to send fire on the earth this God doing that that's right he's the god that Smite it he's the god that produce judgment because he's a God that exercised Mercy he put mercy first to give everybody an opportunity and when they reject that there's nothing left but judgment because he is God and God Alone he don't need our assistance to be God oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God you know you can hear a storm coming a hurricane coming but but the earthquake has come with no warning the Earth is their shake to let big strong man know he's not that big and not that strong as all oh give the Lord a shout you ever get a good shaking yet well God want to rock you and Shake you this morning to let you know the end is come an end is Come Oh Glory to God Noah preached 120 years and the people mocked him and laugh at him but an end that has come when God told Noah get into the a little though those people knew that the end was at hand it's not a joke it's that a amen a [Applause] mockery even youth is Vanity oh my hallu J 10 the angel said time shall be no more is the end of this fast is the end of the ocean of the Millennium on the seventh seal Lord hallelujah Luke 21 verse 8 says Jesus Jesus they saw the temple and they find was so beautiful normal people oh my look how nice it is Jesus said there'll come a a when not one stone will be upon another amen so all their natural enthusiasm and Zeal for what was physical and what was he was saying this is temporary here know here what going to happen Jesus begin to speak he said I take heed that you be not deceived amen first thing amen be careful for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time drath near go not after them when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is Not By and By so Jesus getting down in his sermon now he said for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom great earthquak shall be in diverse places famines pestilence fearful sights Great Signs shall be upon heaven and before all of these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you they Liv you up into synagogues into prisons being brought before Kings and rulers for my name's sake don't tell these motherly Christian that you they sign up for that but they what Jesus said and it shall turn to you for Testimony settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate therefore what you shall answer for I will give you amount and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain say nor resist and he shall be betrayed by both parents and Brethren not only parents alone Brethren too and kins folk and friends so don't fighting who next to is bright you make sure you bright you you understand that now shall be paid by both parents Brethren kins folks friends some of you shall they cause to be put to death and he shall be hated of all men for nine for my name's sakes so what you looking to be loved so much for you stand for the world people hate you if the world love you and people love you love you love you something cuckoo something really cuckoo because they hated Jesus Rabbi Rabbi Rabbi the class he turned one into wine the glad he sick heal and everything else but the end of the day eat five low two fishes multiply and and feed everybody and what every day it's crucify crucify crucify after all that feeding the multitude is crucifying crucify him whatting they will do with you if he was the master who are we this is word now this is genuine Christianity now this is what we sign up for when we sign up to serve Jesus there's a military operation Oh Glory to God this is War real war this is spiritual war oh this the Kentucky fi chicken gospel this is not that this is the prophecies that needs be fulfilled [Applause] Hallelujah you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake and there shall not a hear of your head perish in your patience possess he your souls and when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh then let them which is on Judea flee to the mountains let them which in the midst of it depart out let them not that are in the countries enter there into for these be the days of Vengeance and all things that are written may be fulfilled now we know when Jesus came to the temple and he says the spirit is upon me for he anointed me to preach the gospel and good tidings and so on he left out a certain part and declar the day of Vengeance of our God why because when Jesus came he came to introduce the liberty and the Jubilee but it's almost 2,000 plus years since that time that Jubilee have been blowing all every time you hear the gospel is Jubilee trumpet you could go free you could go free you hold on to your o you hold on to your Grudge you this one do your that you hold on hold on hold on but you can go free if you want to he can't force Freedom upon you he can't force repentance upon you he can't force you to be forgiven you have to want it you have to want a breakthrough you have to want that Deliverance you have to want they all your rotten self CU that's what you have a rotten self you might put a coat in it or a dress in it but it's still your old self Oh Glory to God you have to want that and that could make you a better husband a better wife a better mother better father a better citizen of the country Oh Glory to God a better representative a representative of of the earth that is what they going to make you no Christian and no dud no Christian and no fool Hallelujah God raised Christians to reflect light he want you to be the S of the earth when you walk people must get thirsty oh give the Lord a shout in the house they must want to be like you oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah this is what the gospel is about he are the light of the world and a light you don't put under Bush you put it on top the Give the Lord a shout Oh Glory the god look at me excited inside of here you put it on the [Applause] [Music] lampstand for these be the day of Vengeance and all things which are written there in may be fulfill but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and rat upon his people and they shall fall by the Ed of the sword and they shall be led away captive unto all nations and Jerusalem shall be Tren down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so God cut off the Jews to give us Gentiles a chance and he called that time the time of the Gentiles and they come all when that time going to be up and end is come an end for the Gentile dispensation and for God to go back to the Jews when that time come not another Gentile will be saved so don't sit here as if we wasting time we know what's coming what make the Bible such a different book from every other religious book is not just a book of ethics and morals and behavior and attitude and life it's a book of Prophecy that is what make it so distinguish from every other is a book of Prophecy that's why Ezekiel was told to say thus sayth the Lord not thus say Ezekiel thus say the Lord and end the end is come Hallelujah Jesus Matthew 13 He gave a mystery of the tears and wheat Jesus was busting Parables and Par is hidden mysteries in story form Jesus was a Mastercraft Storyteller he tells stories call them Parables their stories another Parable he put forth saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like not a man which swed good seed in his field but while men slept sometime when you sleeping you who L inside of here you are talking to other people can high huj they don't do it when you're up and alive and around and is while men slept some you sleep inside of here you

gather him up he said no n Le he got up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest watch these words and in the time of harvest so it have Harvest and the actual time of harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles and to burn them and gather the wheat into my B so let hidden Mystery here you know that God let both the true and the false grow together until the time of harvest hear these words the weat and tears which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested what NAA set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organization the false Church turns from any V of Truth with their political might reinforces herself with State backing church back by state and set out to eradicate Forever The True Believer but just when she is about to accomplish a cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the Ghana no longer will the wheat and tears go side by side no longer will the tears receive the blessings of God because of the presence of the wheat hold it whole it you mean tears get blessings of God because of the presence of the wheed that's right God come to bless the whe in but because the tears are there they get blessed also for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out in the six seal which will end in the utter destruction of the wicked now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came in full fruit sh in this age her fruit would mature and ripen and if you haven't listened to Wednesday night service about the question of growth Christian maturity you should listen to it yes because we have to come to maturity God see baby a certain way children a certain way young men a certain way and God see fathers a certain way all of them is stages of growth and God want us to get when I was a child I speak like a child I understood like a child when I become a man I push aside put away childish things you're coming into maturity you cannot get inheritance to a child God can't give power to a child so God want his children to come mature that he could place them in a position of power and authority Oh Glory to God and before you get power and authority over others you have to have power authority over yourself so God want that discipline that internal discipline within you so don't mind Nobody Business you have yours enough to mind oh give the Lord some Praises you have to deal with you glory to God you have to watch the mirror of the your mirror and see how you are doing and don't compare yourself with nobody else all right let's go so her fruit which is the false Vine fruit will mature on right that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where in large all the fogs of the air at a head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bright church WIll mature so therefore when the message is not an idle message the bride church WIll mature the bride church will come into maturity to manage you know what God want done with his word isn't that right and her rightness bright church will be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and ah head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and Demon of Darkness they El strong you is a three cord they have political force they have physical Force plus they're empowered by Demons of Darkness to come against this True Vine that is why the prophecy is they will close us the type of churches they will close us down they have to because we represent something completely different when they were looking for Jes Jesus to come to have to make up an army to fight Rome Jesus come and say my kingdom they backing Jesus in we have a new we have a new leader only fores say my kingdom is not of this world don't come with me in this room thing at all I come to tell you about a higher Kingdom Hallelujah watch this the people looking for deliverance from Rome and Jesus come to bring them deliverance from themselves you say you have heard time I for I to for by sent to you love your enemies do good that's a terrible thing in man look at the sh cut receive Jesus having cut last to to fight and and fight Rome and bomb and and and exploding and rebel and that would looking for you know they're looking for a fighter a revolutionary and she said bless those who curse you do good to them who do evil to you if somebody ask for one coat give them two if somebody ask you to walk one mile walk two miles with [Applause] them completely contrary to what the expectation is and Jesus was so much like them so ordinary Judas had to say you want to kiss when Judas come Jesus said but gosh I was in the temple all the time you bring all these mental to get me you could have you could have S for him and said Jesus we want to see you you want to charge in charge room come with Force to take him so this church have political force physical Force Demons of Darkness come against the True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did and they are ministers today who denying this know because they are dead in their sins they don't believe that the bride will do the very works that Jesus did I want to Rapture just like that dry dry dry biscuit rapture we going we we we want to escape so we want to go I teacher tell me over all Christians want to go and I said I said not this one I said I want to be here for a testimony I want to leave here and leave what you leaving here for I want to have a testimony you want to be able to beat that devil you want to beat that devil running you want to have a witness that you're living a life worthy of the Gospel above sin above unbelief that you're growing in God that you are what God say you are and like Paul say I can do all things through Christ who strengthen at me if God put you in Afghanistan you will survive if God put you in Pakistan you will survive if God put you in China you could survive if God put you in Iraq you can survive you don't have to be in Trinidad can survive anywhere anytime any place under any condition you're going to stand because God raised you up to stand Give the Lord a shout in the house Glory Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I am longing where I can hear no complaints from Christians they only say Amen to the word amen to the word amen to God when the trials when things goone low you're still saying amen when things getting difficult you say praise God anyhow you show God your faith you exercise your faith we have opportunities exercise our faith right now you're going through some stuff and you don't even want to open your mouth to give God praise praise God Paul was in prison and he began to worship and praise God while in prison and then the prison B open up glory to God don't wait till you be free while you're bound give God some Praises give God some worship give God some expect if you have cancer today if you have tumor if you have some sickness the devil the doctors give up on you no was it's time to rejoice and show the doctor he's a liar oh go God can't lie Oh Glory to God if there's one thing God can't do go can't lay sick is going to be healed I believe all my heart God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God is a way maker God is a lawyer God is a doctor give the Lord I shout heasy I am that I am whatever you need him to be he could be this morning oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah so the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus didl then as she nears her headstone becoming like him with the through the word Jesus will come and the bride and groom will be United forever oh my hallelujah praise God thank you then when Jesus had sent the multitude away he went into a house and the disciples came at him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field is still a mystery to them and then Jesus break it to them he answered and said un them he that Sweat The Good Seed is the son of man all right the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked One Stop brother over it you the wicked one had children that's what we saying if the good sees his children the wicked one have his [Applause] own so how you want to connect with that sir hallu the enemy that s them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world the reapers are the Angels so Jesus was very specific in revealing the mystery of this Parable and therefore the tears as a garded and burn in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity Hallelujah and shall cast them into the fire a furnace of fire they shall be weeping or willing nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who had an air to hear Let Him hear oh my thank you Jesus on Sunday morning month was June year 1933 brother Bram was given a series of seven Visions he called them major events that must happen or would happen before the coming of the Lord amen we want to look at some of those events some already passed some Is Yet To Come the first Vision was that of musolini he said that musolini would invade Ethiopia and the nation would fall at its steps that Vision surely did cause some repercussions and some were very angry when I said it and would not believe it but it happened that way you can put it up brother Nicholas he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over that's the dude musolini the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said that musini will come to a horrible end with his own people turnning him and that came to pass exactly the next vision for told was an Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as a dictator over Germany and he would draw the world into war it showed a signf find line and how our troops would take a terrible time to overcome it then it shows Hitler came up to a mysterious end the third Vision was in the realm of world politics for it showed me that there would be three isms fascism Nazism communism and it was swallow up into the Third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North a next picture keep Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North and the man himself Vladimir Putin anointed inspired Hallelujah you have the bums ready to do what he is driven to do the Ford Vision showed a great advances in science that would come after the World War World War it headed up in a vision of a plastic bubble top car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that the people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing in some sort of game to amuse themselves the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering motion around women God showed me that the women begin to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off the here which signify that they no longer under authority of a man and insisted on equal rights in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing went into a state of undress and the last pict I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig Leaf apron with this Vision I saw a terrible perversion and moral plight on the whole world then the sixth Vision There Rose in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Catholic church and I though I believe I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to the popular vote by women the last and seventh Vision was wherein I heard a a most terrible explosion and as I looked turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over America and he also said that the Four Angels holding back the wars holding back World War II is holding back the vision of Destruction that will be coming to America are you still with me this morning yes I want to look back at the fourth Vision today the fourth Vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the second world war it was headed by the vision of a plastic bubbletop car which was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of game to amuse themselves I know a couple of months ago I think was in January or early February I spoke a message about the intelligence and I was showing you one of the most advanced robot that they have talking and relating and so like that and even at that time they had already speeded up advancement in artificial intelligence and so like that but what I want to show you right now is connected to this for vision is the reason why I'm doing this and you'll see afterwards but this uh El M same guy with the chip in the brain and so on and Tesla and so like that uh they had up to what they call I think version 11 of the software trying to get to what they call FSD which is full what they call it full something driving um full full self-driving where the car will drive itself so what they had was codes written by humans saying where the road is and different things that if not turn so and whatnot whatnot but with this new version they have version 12 they remove all those quotes and they put in artificial intelligence that is now learning the roads and learning and whatnot so I want to put on that clip and you will see and get an idea of what it's look like but Nicholas I had the opportunity to write along with hullar's catalog who is one of the very few non-tesla employees who has version 12 of the full self-driving software installed on their car and he let me spend our afternoon choosing random way points around San Francisco to stress test it I'm going to do my best to describe how it actually feels when you're sitting inside the car and then a little later we're going to look at a couple of drives we did with both of our cars navigating the exact same route so we can get a real idea of differences between versions 11 and 12 a quick summary for people who don't keep up with this stuff version 12 is so important because it gets rid of the 300,000 plus lines of human written code that current versions of FSD rely on and replaces it with an endtoend AI architecture that learns from realworld driving Clips taken from good human drivers and then does its best to mimic that behavior that means that there's no specific code telling the car what Lane lines are how to stop at stop signs or red lights how to yield or who rideway it is absolutely none of that it's more of a Monkey C Monkey Do approach and saying it's a big change compared to how current versions work would probably be the understatement of the century many people seem to think think that changing the way the system works from the ground up like this is a negative thing but I assure you this is just how Tesla operates when I was an employee there during the beginning of the model 3 production ramp I witnessed Engineers standing on the side of the production line watching in horror as the systems they probably spent months or even years of their lives developing were literally being removed with a hacksaw because they were slowing down production the same thing is now happening to the autopilot team sometimes starting fresh is better than pouring massive resources into making something work better and if there's a better way to do something Tesla wastes zero time in doing it which I personally believe is a major contributing factor in why they've become so successful I have a feeling that in the Noto distant future we're going to see AI do many things better than humans ever could which is a thought that really does keep me up at night with all that said let's get into my initial impressions of version 12 in a word I got to admit it's incredible it feels like the robot that used to drive the car has been replaced by a competent human and all the little micro adjustments and odd steering inputs I've gotten so used to while testing the beta over the years are either drastically reduced or completely eliminated it no longer feels like it's calculating what to do all the time and instead it just does it even when the car was dealing with something unexpected that would definitely trip up current versions like this light turning yellow while we were in the crosswalk it behaved naturally and confidently the full self-driving beta has been getting more and more smoother over the years but this thing's on a completely different level I kept waiting for the moment it was going to screw up and do a hard break like it usually does when pedestrians walk out in front of you but that moment never came here you can see it's not even stopping as these pedestrians cross the street just a smooth slow down and a smooth speed up I can't overstate how much better the interactions with pedestrians are it still treats them with additional caution but doesn't feel scared of them anymore this is something pretty hard to get across when you're just watching a video like this but when you're actually in the car it will become immediately apparent there were some parts of the drive where it was truly hard to believe that the car was doing it all itself here you can see it completely ignoring the lane lines and drives this road the same way the human ahead of us does I mean I guess it shouldn't really surprise me seeing how the only thing it knows is human driving behavior but to actually experience it in person is just crazy it's also gotten significantly better at controlling for Speed bumps older versions of the the beta were pretty hit and miss depending on the type of speed bump it was but version 12 seems to be consistently good this is finally the version of full self-driving that your wife will let you use while she's in the car I don't use current versions when I have my dogs in the back or there's people riding with me unless I'm on the highway or they specifically ask me cuz it can be a rough experience sometimes but this is more comfortable than the vast majority of Uber drivers I've ever had which is something I didn't think I'd be saying about the beta for a very long time and to me the wildest part about all this is that during elon's live stream we learned that V12 has only been in development for about a year one year of training this and this is what it can do can you imagine what this is going to look like in another year or two from now so we are getting there we are getting to and you know I ask myself the question why is all of this coming at this point in time 5 years ago we wasn't hearing about artificial intelligence 5 years ago we wasn't hearing about some of these things but now it's it's the thing they say you don't even need to code you could tell the artificial to code and write this and code and do that and it's doing it so I want to put on another one that you could look at and we'll put in the next one just see where you want to go so we going put on the next clip and after that imagine having a car where you just say where you want to go and the car takes you there that's what exists today with Tesla any Tesla can do this let me demonstrate for you take me to the Filmore Heritage garage all right here's where I want to go and we're off simple as that so we're in a pretty Narrow Street it needs to make a right turn here you can see in the visualization here it sees people it sees buses it sees everything it needs to make driving decisions so we're making a right turn here but we've got a pedestrian who's Crossing in the crosswalk we've got a car driving we need The Pedestrian to finish Crossing before we can make a right turn and there we go tons of traffic buses cars no problem a lot of people don't know you can just uh enjoy your commute it does highways it does city streets you just sit back relax and watch it make sure it's not doing anything crazy making any mistakes but they can pretty much do everything for you definitely makes it the drive a lot more relaxing you can listen to music listen to a podcast and kind of zone out a little bit and not worry about things okay A little bit of heartbreaking there possibly because of the people sitting in that Cafe or maybe this bus you can see there's a bus stopped here so it's going around the bus now there's some people walking on the side of the road it looks like we got some construction here we got got some people on bikes no problem for the software it can handle it all so it looks like we're going to have to make a right over here where there's a lot of construction so let's see how it handles this most systems they would be toast with this type of construction there's no way you know most driver assistance cars would even be able to attempt something like this but as you can see even a complex construction environment that's Dynamic there's construction workers here bg& workers working on the line it's a very narrow street it's still able to navigate it all right a little bit slow to go over there but looks like there's this truck trying to park okay very good we made it through the construction zone it looks like it's all very smooth and comfortable all right here's another car on a narrow road let's see how it handles it okay it's creeping forward trying to get through looks like this car was waiting for us as best it could no problem pretty much any driving scenario it can handle it you'll be amazed it's actually trained from Human driving so they put millions and millions of clips of people driving they showed it how real humans handled these same driving scenarios and the computers actually able to learn from that footage how to drive in a new scenario that it's never encountered before next up we've got a left turn onto Fair Avenue very hilly road here we're going uphill you can't really see what's on the other side of the Hill which is kind of challenging so you can see it's slowing a little bit being cautious as it Crest the hill all right now we're going to be making a left onto Fair Avenue which is right here makes me think of uh Facebook AI research praise the Lord so these two clips give you a clear indication of what was seen as a major event before the coming of Jesus Christ and these cars of course in the 30s and 40s that didn't even exist anything close to this because what these cars are is really like a computer on Wheels but the last clip and this is the final clip that we have I want to is that Tesla is bringing up something called Robo Taxi and I want to go straight into that one by a Zam musk has hyped up this robot taxi yet again Elon Musk says there will be a robo taxi Tesla Robo taxi unveil on 88 Elon Musk has done it again this time the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has announced that his company is developing a revolutionary new technology that could change the way we think about Transportation a fully autonomous tax taxi service we achiev democratization of AI technology the project which musk has dubbed the Tesla Robo taxi would allow customers to summon a self-driving car that would take them to their destination without any human intervention but there's more to watch out for and we have it all compiled into this video let's find out the big announcement Elon Musk made the exciting announcement that Tesla plans to reveal the Tesla Robo taxi on August 8th 2024 in Austin Texas Elon Musk captured widespread attention by revealing plans for an exclusive Robo taxi model this dedicated vehicle as described by musk would embody a markedly futuristic aesthetic signaling Tesla's bold leap into the next era of autonomous transportation we have been able to get fresh details regarding the robo taxi following Elon musk's response to a tweet from Sawyer Meritt Sawyer shared that Tesla's upcoming 25k vehicle and the robo taxi would share the same platform suggesting the robo taxi would essentially be the 25k car without a steering wheel musk that's the part I wanted to get to you the car without a steering wheel and I want to put up two tweets to um we put up the clips Elon said Tesla is considering model 2 not just having a steering wheel and pedals and just roll the dice and FSD which is first step driving and the next quotation no mirrors no pedals no steering wheel this is me taking responsibility for this decision let me be clear this vehicle must be designed as a clean Robo taxi we going to take that risk praise the Lord so that is where we are at speaking about this fourth Vision that the prophet saw it is nearer than we first believe it is right here then how late is it when all these Visions is just Hitler is already gone mus is already gone a lot of things already gone but it's just so I BNG this up two more things to be fulfilled this is by faith Moses listen to this carefully picking up the other day an old book here reading some of the things that the Lord had told and foretold already come to pass about this juvenile stuff and about the war that would come out and all these things as a hit just two things left in one of those great prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control looking like an egg only you don't drive it it controls itself this what we are identifying this morning is a major event not a minor event this is Major for the cars to be reach this spot that you see here this is not game now and this is going to be released August the 8th this year it means that they have to have the technology the computer power and just recently I think this week uh El M said that they're no longer computer constraint that mean they have tons of computer power that taking all the data from the 6 million electric cars that they have and Computing that data from each car all way they drive and everything else it's incredible but just read this again just two things left in one of those great prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control looking like an egg and only you don't have to drive it it controls itself and then that's one two and then there will be a great woman rise up because America is a woman's Nation a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total Annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out he said just two things left the car and this woman Rises let's get the first picture there brother Nicholas four years ago this couple um president and vice president that woman don't look at her smile don't look at her he don't look at anything look at what the spirit says going to be they came into Power President and Vice President she broke the glass ceiling to become the first woman to be vice president and another quote the prophet said that person might be president or vice president but why you look at the guy on the left so she is just a Heartbeat Away from becoming president how I think about that what year we are in we're in 2024 ahead of us is August 8th the launching of this Robo taxi you know what that means on your phone we have a app and you want to go somewhere you could send for it of course have the payment whatever it is and that will take you to your destination without you there is no need of pedals there is no need of steering wheel and old people already said this could the real thing they can't handle the road and think this is the real thing self this is what we waiting for I will take it and I not old but what they're saying then I want you to see the logic behind it where they would present the need to have something like this it is safer the ey getting tired feeling tired got a tired I whole night last like you have nothing like that you know you could sleep and it can't take you right to where you want in front of your house this is where we are at let's get the next picture that is what we'll close off with that woman okay that's all the clips that's all the pictures we have don't look for any more we finish with that let's finish the message now brother Bram he said come Lord Jesus catch away your church and if it Be Your Will Lord just before the church is raptured May there Rise power oh God fill these vessels raise them up Lord shake this world once more we know it will be P time there'll be no repentance it'll be too far for them but show your power Lord fill those vessels and shake this world like it never been shook before take your church then leave the world in a chaos that she sets in oh God how they struggle now I hope this kind of wake you up this morning to realize with all your plans and visions and the future and what you have in your mind that God have a plan and God have a program and nobody is changing that the Judgment that God pronounced in America he's not canceling that that is not changing America is a finnished Empire even Daniel saw the stone cut up the hands of man to crush every other Kingdom we are not here permanently Wake Up and Shake Yourself that we are nearing the coming of the Lord hallelujah but brandham there will be a Ministry that will show great wonders Joel said so but there will be no time for Redemption it is all over the lamb took his book and his redeemed is Redemption is over as Jesus first preached and was rejected all right here we go so Jesus preached on earth right Pharisees and scribes and whoever else rejected him right he died but he didn't stop preaching you know that right he went to those that was down there and preached to them who could not be saved they heard the gospel from Noah and all down through and Jesus still had to come and preach to them and he prophesied that there's going to be a bride that will preach the people that cannot be saved they will see the power they will see the signs they will see the Wonders they was see the witness and they can't do anything about it that's a terrible thing to be in that's a terrible position to be in you can't change on the other side you have to change here this is the place for you to change because death only changes your Dwelling Place death doesn't change how you are you're crooked you're miserable you're terrible here you'll be terrible across day so you're not going to be making it are you do you I'm saying there's no Kentucky Fri chicken thing you know you will not make it because heaven a have problems and trouble that's not what heaven is about oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God you have to change here you have to change now you have to want to change we can't force you people coming here they're not changing and if they're not changing they're not growing to grow is to learn to grow is to change to grow is not just just sit here and get old or give the Lord a shout in the house you have to see growth in your life you have to see changes in your life I how you're born what environment you grow up in something has to happen that you have to want this thing oh give the Lord some Praises in the house Oh Glory to God so Jesus turple ministry he went to preach to those that were in prison that could not be saved God shut the door after his third after the third had Sodom the doors were shut there was no more Mercy when Noah preached for 120 years and invited people to come to the ark they rejected what happened the Bible say God shut the door not no Clos the door God shut them in the ark and the Ark sat there for seven days somebody get Revelation Noah I see it are ready to come Noah didn't open Noah can't open a door because he didn't shut and the door that God shut no man can open so Noah didn't have Authority or the power to open that door no no no no I didn't shut the door you know God shut it I can't open it they lost and the ACT preaching lost and the gospel still going forward there are people in this message have to be preached to they will fly in church and know when things start to take place when those Angel sink Earth start to rock and things start to take place they come to pray they pray for me Pastor pray Pastor Lord yeah that's right but an end has come that's why you have to understand your time and your season and do not despise your time of visitation I could read it there a scripture say the time has come time is short that those who have Vives do like they have none oh there a scripture too yes that's in the Bible [Music] yes Zechariah 14:12 says and this shall be the plague whereit the Lord will Smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and they eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth they have nuclear pumps and weapons now that could destroy people on the inside and leave the building intact have all kind of man Wicked you know and them is demons and devils in Kings all them kingdoms and thing there you know taking fighting one another for power you know first p 4:7 as they prepare to go to that last clip Nicholas 1 Peter 4:7 says but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer I want to close off with a clip from The Prophet's message souls in prison I want you to listen I want you to take it in he was talking about he has children and he's studing the coming of the Lord he knew things are pressing you are living where we going to see the manifestation of God in his sons and the manifestation of judgment you are in the generation to see things happen that others only dream about seeing you would live to see it we shall not all sleep some Breen have died and gone on and to be with the Lord but you alive and remain you are here to see things Hallelujah and witness things so let's go into that clip by God's grace so take a god represented for this day God representing human flesh made the last sign perform the last Duty it's all over then Noah preached his last sermon the door closed behind him that was all they laughed at it and made fun of it think the people can go right on preaching The ecumenical council can join up with the Catholic church just as it promised to do all organizations can come on but the mark of the beast is already there amen they take it in that see and they say oh Hallelujah bless God there so many got saved last night they did they danced in the spirit they spoke in tongues that don't mean one thing am oh they're meek and gentle and humble yes sir they got the fruit of the spirit that's no sign amen not a bit let me give you the fruit of the spirit between Jesus and the Pharisees see which one had the fruit of the spirit what if I stood as I started to say a while ago against Christ now for a minute God forgive me for even saying see but just to show you something what if I come to you and say say you congregation who is your friend who shows the fruit of the spirit your kind old priest who comes to you in a hospital when you're sick you're a gentle old priest that's right who is it that always loans you some money when you're up against it in a tight place you members of his congregation don't you go to your kind old priest and he loans you money who is is always loving and kind and showing the fruit of the spirit your a kind old priest who is it that's studied for years and years in the synagogues down here where his great great great great great great grandfather come from all the way down who is that studied and got worked hard and got doctor's degrees and phds and llds to know this word and stand here and deliver to you over Sunday morning in his congregation you're kind old priest who is this Renegade called Jesus what school did he come from what school is he out of where is his Fellowship card what organization does he belong to what does he do when you all have a family argument who comes to you your kind old priest to have try to and you have a argument against this neighbor over here and your kind old priest comes and makes you up said you are a children of God you shouldn't do that that's what he what's this Jesus of Nazareth does cares the thing up what does he do L blast your organization what does he do called your priest a blind leader of the blind he called him a snake in the grass he took the sacrifice that God ordained and kicked the tables over and throw the money out and looked upon him with anger did you ever see your priest look like that now where's the Fruit of the Spirit mhm not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by jaring church not the fruit of the spirit Christian Science cannot smother any of you on that amen and deny even Jesus Christ was divine amen that but it's a word living am that is if they only looked he was Messiah he was a Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all man is that right could the third pull be [Applause] on tape people that you listen to this tape I wish you could look at this congregation this [Applause] time I hope you're feeling the same way what if it is look at the scriptures p in here could it be is the third pull to preach to the Eternal doomed that's rejected the message of Salvation well you say the church is go yeah they will they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned what he had redeemed that right amen it's always been that third pool three is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot oh think people could go right on preaching thinking they're getting saved believing they're doing right believing they're organization are growing sure and not even a array of Hope and if that Vision was that and it's been so hard against women we have come to that hour amen doors closed gone already the book is in his hand think of it let me tell you this just before closing now I'm closing it was was told about in Ireland facing the waters there's a great reef that goes down along the side of the bank and up on this great Hill and there was a man going walking along there one day just just at the time for the tides to come in and there was a noble man who lived on the hill that know these Tides he know the time of day that the tides are supposed to come he knew what time the tide set in this guy didn't care what time he is one of these know it alls he had his own idea he's an athleticals was right when the moon had dropped its back from the earth and when God ever drops his Spirit from the earth brother she's gone it's all over that moon ever move out place the waters would cover the Earth like it was when God started in Genesis 1 but the moon sat there and when he just even turns its head the tidde start running in this wise old man who lived there in the presence of it know what time that was this guy didn't know he never studied it he didn't care about it and this wise old man ran out and said my good man darest thou go any farther turn back quickly there's a wall you can't get up the wall your perish the it's the signs are on the time the the title gushing all at once and you cannot return don't go any further and the man turned around and laughed at him said go take care of your own business I know what I can do and what I can the Tide's caught him it may be later than we think you catch you don't go any further don't you do it people if you've always believed in me as being God's servant take my word this morning if you ever did it might be already too late so much scripture shows it that way now remember I don't say that it is I don't know but just look and I've cut off about 10 pages here that I was afraid to tell you Mrs Woods is a record of that Mr woods and I went down this morning to see him I said I I can't tell him can't go that far I just put this much scripture and leave it with them because it's going to be taped it'll go on to people will laugh at this message it's all right it'll be a past turning back one of these days go on just be a church member cut off your hair paint your face go on take father son Holy Ghost you want to that make it three gods and be he go on stick to your organization do so if you want to say I danc the spirit I spoke in tongues I got it I've seen Devils do the same thing I've seen witches speaking tongues and interpret it and writing unknowing tongues interpreted who drank blood out of a human skull and caught on the devil danced in the spirit Mam's dance in the spirit like that until they can take Spinners and run around their fingers and take a lance and run up through their face like that and pull it out and not even a drop of blood will come out of it the Indians will walk on fire barefooted three foot deep and four three or four foot across blow wave cold so they're white hot and never get a Scorch on their feet and deny there is such a thing is Jesus Christ no no friend it's the word that tells it the people and the word has got to be one amen Jesus and the Word was the same he was the word and when Jesus lives in the human being that makes him and the word the same don't your life tells what you are now just look at yourself in God's
