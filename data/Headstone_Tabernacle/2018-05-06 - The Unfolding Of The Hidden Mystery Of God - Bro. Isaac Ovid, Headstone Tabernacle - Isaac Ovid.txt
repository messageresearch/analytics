the church says and the church says [Music] one more request for brother papa stepdaughter sister Latoya major surgery coming up one more time Heavenly Father Lord in the enemy has attacked Lord and every sigh but Lord you said in your word that where the enemy comes in like a flood of spirit we raise our standard Lord father is not just for us but for your name's sake Lord you promised it you

morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ special greetings to the waldron family and the visitors and our kids this morning or bless you we're happy to have you with us in fellowship this morning amen so if you have your Bible the lights go straight to the word just one portion of Scripture this morning reading from the book of Revelation chapter 10 and just reading verse 7 revelation 10 and verse 7 just one scripture reading but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets my lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen we'd also like to welcome Samuel James and Cheryl James invited by brother Alexis welcome to the head Sun Tabernacle this morning and also Kristiana arendelle in right away brother George Mahone welcome to the headstone tab on this morning we're happy to have you with us so I have a title this morning the unfolding of the mystery of God the unfolding of the mystery of God because it is a mystery it has to be unfolded because a mystery unless it isn't full it will remain a mystery but God cannot unfold it all at once so it takes time to unfold it but before I touch the text this morning I want to remind the church that brother Branham said in every church there are three kinds of believers he said they are unbelievers he said they are make believers and they are true believers this is just the encourage of fear this morning in a message the Queen of Sheba brother Branham said now some people look at their symptoms my pastor prayed for me last night but my hand is no better but everyone said that has nothing to do with it if you are really a believer then you don't even look at that it's already settled forever God healed you what if Abraham would have looked that next month to see if Sarah was going to have the baby he never noticed that he just noticed what God said and any true believer looks to the promise not what the symptoms are around them they look at what God said and that's an encouragement to you this morning because if you want to find sometimes you'll find symptoms but they're random said when you come to church if you want to find problems you'll find problems but if you're looking for Jesus you'll find Jesus so I'm not here this morning to accentuate the problems and the symptoms and the troubles and we can spend a whole service talking about how rough things are and how much pressure we had this week and what didn't work out and what you who are disappointed you and what expectations you had that didn't seem to work out because when all service talking about nobody knows that trouble I see them and maybe there are times we could spend time talking about it but this morning I want to focus on the promise this morning I want to focus on what God said this morning I want to be a true believer I want to forget the symptoms I want to forget the past I want to forget what went wrong I want to forget what happened yesterday I want to forget what you disappointed with I wanna forget about it this morning and I wanna look power power ever blackwood never he has brought us too far to leave us the problems you'll always have the problems but I have seen this morning that greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world it's time to put the problems of and the symptoms and the doctors reports and what your neighbor said and and what it doesn't matter this morning Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah and I'm also this morning I'm not preaching to everybody Oh hallelujah but the Branham said and the father said the gospel will be preached and then the end will come but the preaching of the gospel is really to the true believers will always have made believers will always have under leave us but in every age there always be a true believer somewhere and the true believers they are minority or they are few but for the Planum said in every age they were true believers and I believe in this day in 2018 they are still true believers they are still believers who will stand on the promise of God they are still true believers of who will hold on for their families hold on for their loved ones hold on for their children hold on for their husbands hold on for their wives hold on for the church there tarry until this heap our deal tarry until every word comes to pass up deal hold on you're not gonna give up you're not gonna see and nothing is happening they're gonna hold on to the promise of God until the promise is manifested until the promise is real Oh hallelujah Oh all true prophets in the message my kinda prophet all true prophets all true Christians all true believers stay with that word no matter what anybody says you stay right with the world when they see the days of miracles has passed don't you believe it for the Bible said he's a see me yesterday today and forever that's why I say all the time I'm tired of church up because church has become a formal ritual I have to get up on Sunday morning but that's not what I came for this morning I didn't come to have another service I came to see this Bible come alive I can't see this message because I'm a true believer and I will wholly go to the world not one of these days this mortal will put on immortality that one of these days the headstone will unite with the body one of these days your son your daughter he could be in the bar they could be a prostitute but a word will find them and the word is better than any police officer the world will arrest them the world will lock them up the Word of God will bring them to the house of God deal come whether they want to or not because once the word of God goes forth that what cannot return for halleluyah halleluyah oh brother Clarence good kind of even take back his word if you wants to the moment it's spoken it's like an owl it cannot come back up and every time God shoots up he never misses the target whenever God shoots up into take time if you take a season but it's gonna hit the target and God has shot from glory a promise of revival yes shot from glory a promise of restoration he has shot from glory a promise of deliverance and no devil could stop it no demon could stop it your makeup can't stop it your pants where it can't stop it you're cutting your hair can't stop it because all of that is in the flesh but yes blood yes not for the seed in your soul I'm not looking at the symptoms I'm looking at the circumstance all hell is supposed to be against you what all heaven is with us just smaller oh we serve notice to that demon of sickness we serve notice that that demon of cancer we serve notice to that demon of female condition we serve notice our eternity Manasa we serve notice to your posture we serve notice to condemnation we serve notice to ungodly spirits we serve notice to every foul spirit we serve notice to every holder that the enemy wants to have in your house up in your life yes power in the blood yes power in the name of Jesus to break every chain to break every shackle [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah time up double time up double Oh hallelujah Oh glory glory glory you may be seated for a minute when Jesus I love to preach about this because it broke the routine it brought the expectation when Jesus said let us go to the other side I love preaching about it because it was the other side it was not decided it was expected that Jesus would be on it was the other side it was not where the Jews congregated because the Jews didn't congregate where the pigs will what are the other side is where the pigs were when the prodigal son left his father's house to go to far away he was the living among his people because his people didn't have pigs among them so Jesus had to go and find that man where he was he had to find a prodigal where he was Jesus himself said he that I well have no need of a physician we didn't come this morning because we are all right we came this morning because we need help I don't know about you but I need help I need Jesus today more than yesterday somebody helped me this morning I need strength to breathe I need strength of walk and he's trying to preach and in strength of worship I wish I had more energy I wish I had more of a voice up because when John saw dilemma he said all in heaven or near to all an idiot because the lamb was don't worry I wish I had a voice of some this morning because I want to shout I wanna sing I wanna worship [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated oh I'm not trying to work nobody up that's not what we're about this morning but when something changes in your soul we just trying to wake up the sea that's inside of you that's what we tryna to wake up the seed that's already inside of you because if there's no seed you could never see this thing let me say that again if there's no seed you don't stand a chance but if there's a seed even if you're backslidden you're coming because the seed must bring forth after its time the seed has got to produce you may be seated Oh hallelujah and God knows about how the law of reproduction works so when you want to plant the seed it can you put manure but stuff on it and all this stuff in your life when the devil thought he was destroying you it was only cleaning an environment for God to work through the cedar because he will share his glory with nobody he will share his honor with nobody he is the one to bring you into a manifestation he is the one to call you from the world call you from your family call you from your situation call you from your chest [Applause] [Music] you may be seated [Music] hallelujah so I don't know what the mission he came in here with but something happens when God is here no matter what type of entity it is when God is here there's a response when Jesus crossed to the other side the man didn't know who Jesus was but the spirits that were upon him knew immediately because the Bible says he ran and worship he ran that man didn't know who Jesus was but those spirits recognize that the maker of the wind and maker of the sea and the one who made the sixteen elements together to make man had dropped down the sim thority that created the Sun the same authority and one of these days this mystery of God will be unfolded because you are not even what people see when people look at you they see burnished in and they see by the mic and they see better Alexis and the devil wants to keep it that way even Moses when people when people saw Moses he say Moses but the Bible said that Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter the moment he realized that he was not what they were calling him for all of his life they were calling him Pharaohs that's the son of Pharaoh's daughter that's Allah that's a son as Moses a son but when he got a revelation there passed and he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter don't call me that don't put that name on me don't tell me I'm not gonna make it no no no no don't tell me I'm gonna miss the rapture don't call me that the tribulation is not my name oh come on now swathi kita is not my name adulterer is not my name that we have been who I was but now that I know who I am I refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter I reject my past because my past on this earth is not a real me I come from God I'm going back to God I was there when the devil was kicked out oh come on what pass you're talking about what happened what are you talking about I'm all the time the devil I'm all attented demons because I was there before there was a moon before there was a star what part are you talking about you may be seated halleluyah halleluyah somebody you gotta celebrate the devil he made me see the ones to pull your book wants to pull your file and tell you about ten years ago on and fifteen years ago and I'm not sure are you and should be or you know you and and I say no problem you keep doing with it done let me talk because I want to pull the book that says before the world was a lamb was slain I wanna pull the book that's weeks of when Michael fought and there were angels that represented us that we were there I wanna go black if you want to go black let's go all the way back to go the boss today years ago fight let's go all the way back because I was there and you were there and God when he looked at us he said you last day you last day you blasted I like the way you fight you last day you last it Moses you I want you here for a purpose for you but it is not lasting special unit Navy SEALs special forces special training [Applause] he may be seated I'm gonna get to the text another manager but anybody knows who knows me I love to talk about the Navy SEALs it just amazes me because Navy SEALs part of the US Navy and at any point in time they're on average 1 million sailors in the u.s. Navy and on average they're about 300 Navy SEALs 300 out of 1 million as part of the training but a popular to become a Navy SEAL there's a bell that hangs in the middle of the training ground and they tell you don't stress yourself out if you don't have what it takes go ring the bell and if you ring the bell it's no problem you could go home we're not forcing nobody to be a Navy SEAL but if you clap what it takes you gotta be able to survive you're not able to fight if you are the only man left you got a complete the mission because you are the best of the best there's no other soldier like you but if you can't take it going the bell and many times when the Navy sees tell their stories he was anywhere on the edge of they almost couldn't make it and the instructors would tell him don't worry ring the bell [Applause] we will laugh at you ring the bell giver but those who make it that given up can stick giving up is not in our vocabulary backslide and listen the problem is not backsliding on the problem areas theorem and they don't get back up but these guys you have to go on the water yes sir you may be seated Platinum is your training is they will tire your hand on your foot and Troy you're in the water this is not a test of swimming I will feel instrument test me it's a test of getting out of the rope answer me now God knows where I'm not only this is any natural but in the spiritual the amount of time that ever tie you up show you in the water and look at you you don't know how you swim you don't know how you made it you oh god help me somebody help me help me help me this morning he may be seated the Navy SEALs they're gonna practice they have to hold their breath for certain period of time cabbie five seconds out to breathe because you'll die so you have to hold your practice at extreme gotta take pressure just hang in there when only also can shoot and touch your Christian journey because situation will come to test you unless you own a lovable God the natural education system the skip classes sometimes if you're real bright see well you you too bright for form tree to go straight up on five there's natural eyes man but Gordo skip no classes so because he wants to make sure every son in stride because the fighter you have to face listen you haven't identified yet but underneath someone I'm not believe me Goliath is coming some of us we haven't reached lion and bayit we said the 11 mosquito and spider I'm big butterfly when I see you lying there like lord have mercy I was any better I never sequel i waver faint but every trial every test is to bring out the attribute in you that caught but there you didn't put it there is your responsibility is to keep the atmosphere some the very appearance of evil be in the word so that you would know to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks because he's not gonna come to you that you will see devil come in devil come and ever come in he don't give out of advance warning look at me I'm a devil I want to talk to you you would run it's you and fall for that but he has to finally had to use your friend use your beretta use your school friend use the teacher and you could use anybody at all never could use anybody here's fine his way and if you don't recognize it look at Jesus Matthew fix 16 pizza can revelation to her Christ and after that Jesus had to open the revelation to them this is what's gonna happen is what's gonna happen Peter I said no no it's not true see fide Jesus a boy with no I don't know how to break it to Peter and the off you would on this one Jessie just get behind me Satan know plenty people can have a lesson because how do you think bit of you five minutes for mighty testimony five minutes later glutes Academy hi miss Eton so if you take a recognize he still missing something despite the revelation where the random said a supernatural element she still remained that's the prophets world so despite the fact that Peter had a revelation of the Christ he was missing a supernatural experience to teach him something deeper than the revelation he had something that would sustain him how many I would carry him something that he could share with other people something he could demonstrate he's not what you want it's not what you're looking for hallelujah this gospel is real friends you say there's gonna talk a little bit before I start about to preach I was I was speaking I was speaking on Tuesday night and they go Martin I was speaking about Noah and you know I said the mystery of God is so fast that if every word is to be written we would never be able in our human life to read it it's too much so God had to choose what he wrote so by faith Noah that's it by fate and within those few words speaks up and sums up Noah's whole life so I was preaching about getting into the act of safety but the man said Christ is the Ark of safety but I was bringing it because I love to see the God's will become real to people because a lot of people come to church they come to service and they're disconnected they hear intellectually but they haven't identified with it so even the process of the lamb and the sacrifice was for the believer to identify with the sacrifice he couldn't be detached from it because he would not be remorseful and repentant because it was just another lamb being sacrificed it became casual because they couldn't identify with him so I was speaking about Noah and I moved from Noah to Noah's family because I said listen God spoke to Noah he didn't talk to know why he didn't talk to Noah's sons he didn't talk to Noah's daughter-in-laws and I asked the question I said imagine I am sure Noah had family relatives people who went to school it people who would have known him next on me but even if he didn't talk to them he know them I said Noah's wife would have known people Noah's sons would have known people know as daughters-in-law would have known people and not one of them was able to convince anybody to get into the ark for all the years I've no appreciate because nobody acted on it I'm sure Noah did all he could do to tell people this thing was coming because but the Branham said for you to be concerned you must be convinced convinced and concern that's how he preached it so I'm challenging my spirit because I'm asking myself have me done enough for our families for our friends because when the class boom went out in the days of Exodus in the days of Moses it was a loan for a house and the Bible said if your house was too small team up with somebody else but in other words make sure you get into a house where it was blood the gospel has never change the message has never changed it has always been to get into the safety get into the ark get out of Solomon get away from it get into the hub's with the blood how convinced are you because when you are convinced your life begins to reflect it your walk begins to reflect it your talk begins to reflect it it's not to have knowledge but the brother said there was no difference between the Egyptians and the Jews except that the Jews were given a way out they were given a way of escape if an Egyptian had done the same thing he would have had the same result because cause would is consistent it wasn't only because it's you if you do this no that's why if the Jew did not do it he was dead because a death angel wasn't asking what tribe you are in who told you about it was not it and all of this is the mystery of God that was unfolding because was a type of the perfect lamb that would come and that blood would be applied on our lives as a life that people must see until said in the last days I poured my spirit upon all flesh and he goes and then he said my people shall never be ashamed never be ashamed and I shared with them on Tuesday that never be a shame as a powerful thing because too many of us were ashamed because I said to display the blood on your house it was a public display most of us who want to live a private Christian life we don't want nobody to know we don't wanna buy to ask us any questions we want to be secret Christians and when God's requirement is that when the world looks at you they must know that there's blood so I gave the believers in big amounts in homework two weeks ago if your neighbors don't know you're Christian there's something wrong if your coworkers can't tell you a Christian there is something wrong if your family cannot tell you are Christian there is something wrong I don't care how much books you read I don't care how long you're on your knees if there's no display of a life that could persuade somebody that your pen with Jesus you need to go back the father is all that's the kind of preaching people don't like to hear because we would like to be comfortable but the reality is this they took note that they had been with Jesus the inspiration of this convention we have coming up is apply the token because by the branham's of the evening time message is supplied a token and the token must be on display you can talk about display until you've applied it and you have to apply it a certain way well well I want to put the blood on the back of my house I don't want nobody see but tell our tele angel check the back I didn't find it was much in with my colors my house is white white enough that's irrelevant but over preach the message last week about the ceiling angel and a seal of God it's a painful thought friends to think you want to make it and you don't make it because you took something for granted I have a burden this morning the burden is not to preach the book is a sigh and cry until there's a change in your soul I'll tell it'll change with how I speak to their husbands change with her husband speak to their why as a cheat with how children speaks to your pair you can tell me there's blood on your house and you're disrespecting your parents that's not what the blood is supposed to produce the Holy Ghost life must be a Christian everyday in every situation in everywhere there are no exceptions [Applause] it is either we want the reality or we want a kind of a gospel and the brother said judgment begins in my sanctuary in the house of God he's not judging outside it begins at the ancient men who know better - ah - establish the prayer altar in the house even if the whole family don't want to come to the altar you are there having a testimony that the altar has been re-established in the house no excuses no excuses even if you don't know the prayer long still kneel there as a testimony Lord I wanted establish I don't have to burn any yet but I'm doing a sign of I'm doing something because we cannot go on the way we have been going [Applause] [Music] knowing all the mysteries knowing all the quotes knowing having all the books and the tips and your life can't even match up to a pentecostal who just loved the Lord and God hasn't opened their eyes of this truth but you don't mess with their prayer you can't mess with the in sanctification you can't mess with what they understand they're a hundred percent and God by His wisdom didn't show them this and this and what they know God will treat to them according to what he revealed to them but you are brought a higher calling because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery is finished and his expectations of us are higher [Applause] Oh somebody help me this morning bring back the altar bring back to reality I don't know where I'm gonna get it but I'm depending on him this morning I don't even know I'm gonna go back to the notes but as chorus I'm feeling himself when Jesus came he said in vain do they worship Ritchie was teaching the commandments as if this is anything and it sounds crazy Noah's message became boring enough everybody knew was Noah's preaching before he pissed at the bridge for you to even come and sit there every Sunday if you were coming you know you're coming here DC message because your messages is gonna rain and with the banner plays such an importance on the message a token we could spend time talking about the vials and the plagues on the walls and it's it's all there but where the Bremen said their seeds for the bride what good is it - no but the plagues and the fires on the wars if you're not gonna make the rapture what good is it to know all of this if the whole purpose of the message of the hour is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father and we miss that because we are so busy with the cares of life we are so busy with our cell phones we are so busy with the news we are so busy with social gatherings we are so busy with staying up-to-date on the politics and government and the wars and when there's no cry there's no sign but I said why can you preach was to shout and jump what good is it the shout and jump if there's no crying even so come Lord Jesus there's no desperation in your soul there's no you have becoming used to living tano how much minutes did you pray this morning did you even pray if you pray yesterday did you pray today before how do you grow as a christian radio by when i'm praying every day there's no debt amidst other tears you miss attendance that is a Miss Britton and I've read in sadena try it now and as this flesh depends on oxygen your soul depends on the Word of God your soul depends on the relationship with God you looking for a break you in your house you look at if I break you in your life you're looking for a break you in your marriage you looking for break you on your job I'm gonna say and seek me first and everything else will fall in place that's real gospel [Music] [Applause] you know what people miss God will make all your efforts feel deliberately he will crumple your business if it takes you away from him he will destroy it again and again and again and again until you realize that it's not your efforts and he is the one to provide if you put him first he will open doors you never fought it open that's how much he's interested in your soul because this flesh has a time limit on it but your soul is eternal so he will put this flesh into whatever it has to do that's why that's why the promise that if love doesn't get you desperate then conditions will we need to be more sincere we need to be desperate I asked the question all the time if God were to come right now to grant the desires of your heart what is that desire it's going to come to Grand the desire of your heart what is that desire when since the haughty right was speaking to the Prophet the Prophet was testifying of the experience he had I believe it was with the squirrels and when Cincinnati right said that's nothing but the truth the angel of the Lord was so pleased and he said whatever you asked for you could not get it the Prophet said if you act some money you get it and she said then say I want the salvation of my two boys do we have Christians like that I want the deliverance of my soul I want my family to be under the blue that one I want two revival in my children that's more important than anything else if you don't have the Holy Ghost friends you should be so desperate so desperate above all else let everything else fall apart because you need the token but if I said we are lost without it we are gone without it all the church calling is in vain if you don't get the equal sign though I know all mysteries do I speak with tongues do I give my body to be burning and it equals that if I don't have charity I am nothing all of this is to bring an equal sign some time ago I said I want to preach a message called the equal sign because we add up everything in life and we hope that the equal sign it will echo something good we hope it will equal good good score in life well lord I do distance what I do that when the Bible says people come and say but lord I did this in your name and you say well depart from me you worker of iniquity because all of it left an equal sign where you still living like a rascal still living like a devil still disrespecting your husband your wife your children the house of God live in any how you want and want to come to church because pretend the season changes and people didn't realize there was no longer pizza but angel had sat on his throne and the pillar of was there so because the new pizza and everybody knew everybody he said you haven't lied to me a lie to you holy goes it's out of my hands and Friends every day that passes we're getting closer to the rapture so we ought to walk more carefully now than yesterday we ought to be more desperate now than yesterday we ought to be more sincere than yesterday even the Prophet core told him you have to be more sincere what about us oh lord help us can the church say man so can I strike my text a little bit remember it over it said he really wants us to have a time of prayer time I crying out I turn my sign he said if you don't make the time we'll make the time here in the house of God because the Prophet said we could sing too much we could preach too much we could dance too much but we can never pray too much just to remind you church Matthew 24:40 then shall two be in the field and one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left I want you to recognize what this scripture it is not as if they were two in the physical church this is a type of normal living as in you're going about your life but then the hour comes that you didn't expect it what's there for for you know not what hour your Lord that come the Bible makes it very clear but notice that if the Goodman of the house had known and what watch the thief would come he would have watched I would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh a reality check friends are you ready if the rapture were the take place is evening are you ready so God had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what we're speaking about this morning that's the prophets words the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we are living in then you will understand clearly then I believe what is being done and I've spoken on this many times how scientists are trying to figure out and the world's gonna figure out and how this God if God has read of God it's not real and this and this and and God over time because he was too big he was too powerful because he couldn't be captured in any way he had to unfold himself over time he didn't want to be complicated he wanted to be accessible he wanted to be accessed he didn't want to be misunderstood he didn't want that you have to have a degree to talk to him he didn't wanted you have to go through somebody to get to him so he had a mission to bring himself to the people that they can relate to him personally and individually he could do it in Genesis or or in the early part of scripture so it's a time for him to unfold himself that he gonna fellowship with individuals the same way he have fellowship with Adam in the cool of the evening and when Adam fell he disconnected that relationship with God I knew that every evening God would come to fellowship with him I didn't have to worry about his condition because the Bible said he was naked not ashamed he had nothing to hide he had nothing to defend he didn't have to prepare because God was coming in the cool of the evening to talk with him he didn't have to get psyched up and let me get ready because he's coming because sin was not in a picture he was in a condition that he could commune with God but the moment sins chapter the picture and I'm recognized that he was not in a condition for God to see him that way so he went into hiding until God see Adam where are you not his physical location because God knows his physical location he said why are you not in the position I left you in a position of power a position of authority a position where you were not ashamed now you didn't have to hide from me you didn't have to hide in the church you didn't have to sit there wondering what was going on because you were covered by the word you were protected by the word you were living something but all of a sudden you have ventured where I told you not to go and now you're feeling ashamed and now you're hiding what sure is all unfolding of the mysteries when Peter undernea Pentecost said this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel where my people will never be ashamed and I'll poured my spirit the Holy Ghost comes to remove that shim to remove your floors and your mistakes and not to cover it up prints but through the blood it dissolves your sins your mistakes your pass and restores you to a spiritual being with eternal life that the devil can't even touch you because the scene in your soul is activated by the Spirit of God and that's why the great mystery could be Christ in you the hope of glory and that's what the devil wants to stop by sending all kinds of situations your way can the church see me hallelujah so the attributes of God that he had himself that he demonstrated through the ages those same attributes are to be demonstrated by his children in this day because he says that in this time you won't have to lay hands and see in Jesus name but his name will be in you so you could command another bility to command the devil is just like your father or just like your husband however you wanna put it it's the same thing because you are him and he is you the same works that I do you shall do also because you are united with him can the church Shaymin and that's cause desire to see your life reflect feet virtue knowledge temperance patience godly bills not animosity jealousy envy your flex in the morning you don't want to pray you're tired you know Lord let these virtues live in me it's my prayer live or die sake or drone if I can't in my family let me maintain Christ Oh hallelujah hallelujah whoo and we are counting down friends you are the mystery of God you are the mystery that caught held secrets in the back part of his mind when Daniel and Abraham all wondered how this will come to a great end how this will come to a final climax could imagine they all wondered how this will work itself out and God kept this secret mystery locked up through all the ages how this thing will come to a climax how the headstone will unite with the body what people will be the people who would have the voice of God in these last days to think we are that people hallelujah you are mystery to your family I'm taking my time I'm not done yet I'm taking my time people watch movies for our two hours you do all kind of nonsense we're gonna take time this morning because we have a rapture to go to so buckle your seatbelts strap on get ready because we are gonna give the devil a knockout punch don't let the devil tell you're tired or this or that I'm nothing to do with that I'm not even really a flesh this morning I must be give me your soul because that's what God is gonna pull this motor will have to change to immortality but we shall be changed Christ was a mystery in his day and you are a mystery that's why young people you could never enjoy the world because there's too much of God in you you could never enjoy it we could try we could never fit in because there's too much of God in you so take it out your mind what you wanna do who you want to be friends with what you want to achieve get rid of it it's never going to happen God is not gonna allow it to happen [Applause] you may be seated look at Jonah caught that you are now closer than ever you know it this is a young people service you know Gordon never no see I'm Johnny I'm not going see if I'm good do what you want all right young people do what you want do not born in next week he hadn't straight down to what every party effect whatever the correct they life whatever he taught was gonna take him away from where God tell him to go because Jonah thought he had some kind of control he thought he could have decided his destiny surely didn't realize his purpose had already been written Jorah didn't realize if his life story had already been written and listen what Jordan realized is that part was also written Oh Jonah would spend some time trying to find himself Oh Jonah will come to an existential crisis of who he was in Gordon and Hojo no attorneys black and all of that is written because he is the author and the finisher is he allowed it to be written and that's how we can predestinate based on what is going to happen somebody give her a shout of praise [Applause] so Jonah take the ship - it attaches how many of us have our own touches oh yeah I am Anita - it's not because I have to go to tosha's and they've all got a different definition of time today I can make this I can make this prayer meeting because after what the transition they can't testify but a good is a look I'd have to go to Tarshish they're doing good presentation in school when I can't tell anybody jesus loves you and Jonah get a nice boat a nice room any boats resting comfortably any boats until God say well here's what I already know hole is holding plain old SATA shake the boat we know I love about Jonah and that's what God loves about you when they said to go wrong do they say no one knew who it is boy I don't know I wonder I wonder why it is happening I wonder I wonder why it is happening Jonah get off his bed when she the man say fellas here's what I'm the problem throw me overboard Rapunzel you done know any problem throw me overboard and Jonah didn't even know that his subtle resistance was all part of God's plan because those people in the never had a respect for some fish good so when Jonah pull up in a fish limousine 10 people say well this this had to be God and Jonah could preach a message repent and the whole nation change so young people God could have chosen anybody for this D but he picked you not to be a practice EPO just a casual onlooker this is not a easy one looking this is the ears for action four sons of God to give the devil a final knockout punch so all of your training all of these services all of what you're going through is to prepare you for your fight so to help your family to help those that God identify that you will be wants to deliver can the church amen so you are God's mystery it's a mystery why you have to grow it here it's a mystery why you dress the way you do it's a mystery and even if you don't understand it by living it God blesses you and you wait for the revelation I'll be understanding to come but don't take chances I said to young people some time ago people when they run back are nobody ever watch a car especially a used car and say I like that are taking it anybody ever did ya ever at least open the hood and check me if it have an engine not even if the engine good if it have an engine you say walking it used-car lot I'll take that one over there in the corner there whatever the priority it is yeah what the check this even have a spare tire you don't want to check anything that's not how we do things people want to buy a fridge and they gonna check 15 stores to buy one fridge because what to make sure this new one they want and your soul people want to take it for granted and think because you're come to church is going to be all right no friends what is the mystery of God God in you the hope of glory shining force that gives you the Holy Spirit and when these things take place time shall be no more Oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord the band I'm sending a message witnesses if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes whoo let's get in such an atmosphere friends in the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation but the band said what is it the mystery of God God in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the Holy Spirit then he said when these take place time shall be no more they'd have no their courts settle in the last days many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase but didn't know their God shall do exploits in the last days he shall do exploits see we come out of eternity we was before there was a world we have said this but I said having the prophets age did you know that God made man in his own image where was you he said to German job thought he had some wisdom where was you when I laid a foundation on the world before I laid it when the sons of God sang together and the morning star shouted for joy so when you go to school friends that's part of the mystery on your job that's part of the mystery you have to live something and you are not even a believer the Prophet said the word in you that's the believer so you didn't come to church this morning because you you felt comments as we're over would say but you came this morning because the scene in your soul was looking for something looking for reality looking for an experience looking for a change that mystery in you of who you are is trying to express itself pull on the same way didn't know who Jesus was it's the same way you don't know who you are Jesus is going to church normal normal until they called Jesus to read he thought it was just another service he thought I was just another reader this it was just another scripture until Jesus said this day the scripture is fulfilled and then you realize something was different and one of these days you will come to church and the scripture will go forth and with a Branham said one day the right words will be spoken and we could dash into the presence of God love what trucktown maybe one of these days friends maybe today that the Wrightwood would be spoken then we conceived this day this scripture is fulfilled oh this day it's a manifestation Oh hallelujah could you imagine brother Clarence Jesus in church because the Bible said as was his custom so he was in a temple all the time people shaking Jesus hand people saying god bless you afterwards the Jesus Jesus going home Jesus walking around and nobody know who he is he's just like everybody else but in the season change and the same prophet effort was just another brother was not just a different brother this was the Messiah himself how could Almighty God come under cover slip into the tabernacle and eat bread with them I didn't even realize who it was but when the season changed the season changer and when your season change friends you can never go back the way you were before when you break free when you break out when God delivers you you can never go back to where you were before hallelujah brother branham preach he said when our chicken is about to break on the egg you cannot help it he said if you help it you kill it but when that chicken breaks out you try to put it back in the sugar you try to put it back on it could never go back and the devil is trying to keep you in this shell the shell of no worship this shell of no praying this shell of no praises his cello if you're not gonna make it and you're doing if you're gonna make it but when you break out you can never go back you are persuaded fully persuaded I'm going to the rapture I'm gonna be healed I'm gonna manifest seven living voices nor devil nor demon nor tiredness no sickness no black pain no acquaintance could stop you because you are broken free you are broken loose and who the Son of man set free is free indeed [Applause] she made me see that hallelujah that's why you have to be so careful because how the brother next to you or the sister next to you is now it's not how they'll be when their season changes you don't know who sitting down next to you different thing altogether right on it might look ordinary but let the spirit take a hold of them oh forget it it's a different person you could be sitting down next on apostle right now you could be sitting down it's a preacher you could be sitting down next to somebody calls gonna be used to turn San Fernando Hospital upside down Peter was walking and people were healed and Peters shadow PETA's mama never told him people would be healing your shadow but when the Holy Ghost claimed the pizza it wasn't it's a claim in it when the Holy Ghost huh claim the pizza leader did things he never thought would happen oh come on church come on church what is it the mystery of God [Applause] it'll be a different deal for you that's what the Holy Ghost is given for with a brand of reason what is the Holy Ghost given for is it gives you power to pray power to speak power the level holy life that's not mental that's not you making a choice that's the Holy Ghost displaying itself living himself out giving you power with the random dramatized he said he take a woman she can't get to pray answer but filled with the Holy Ghost what's the difference in her life what's the difference in her walk you've caught filly with the Holy Ghost your whole life your family life your marriage everything will change because you won't be alone he promise will never leave you he promised to never forsake you he has to give his word he must keep his word [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh my what God has for you your parents could have never told you that's powerful you may be seated Rita's mama never told Pizza Pizza one D gonna walk and people be healing your shadow she never knew this she couldn't tell me this but when the Holy Ghost dropped upon pizza Pete I was living like a mystery dismiss she was already established before the world that he would walk and people would be he's in a shadow John's mama never told John they're gonna put you in oil to boil you and the cowboy allele if you told John this you would have never believed it but when the Holy Ghost took a hole at John the mystery that was in John lift itself out somebody help me respond Oh hallelujah listen even the Prophet didn't even know what he was going to live out because God only shows things in part until the time comes to reveal it in its fullness [Applause] you've ever seen it so when the fish was dead it wasn't the prophets idea to speak to the fish the Lord told him speak and all of a sudden he realized he could have done something he didn't know he could have done before oh come on church so I want to tell you this morning there's stuff in your life that you don't even know you have right there you're struggling and you're struggling and you're struggling and you know if you don't know how you don't know when you don't know why but that's trust in you that the devil cannot stop but one of these days the Holy Ghost itself not a bus but the Holy Ghost itself oh we want to break free this morning you want to break free this morning freedom time Liberty time because the Prophet said when you get to know you are you'd be an invincible army unstoppable cannot be defeated Devils run from you [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated you see radiation and certain types of bombs and stuff they give off a certain signal that you could use cameras to see that's all if you go to the airport but something is gonna pick it up but as a bomb is about to explode as radiation gets more intense they get brighter and brighter and brighter so you know it's about to happen but Jesus before the spirit with gesture would when he waited in the wilderness The Devil's arena picked up a signal that warranted a question if they'll be because it Ares to brightness yet for me to know for sure but if thou be then do this now because I'm familiar with these signs because Moses and even and fls was showing signs but and I look up all of them but I do I want to look you up early and Jesus Jesus to play with what he'd ever ask you to do something go do it they talk about well the devil asked me to pray sir what what devil actually to Jesus a man channela by bread alone and and he the devil ball in devil and she's just part 4 6 it is written never try again he's written double trying it is also written and with a random city devil left for seasonings yes I think our less let's take a break you see that was come come back down and say listen fellas I've gone on a vacation do know what that is never met a man like this before he not trying to impress somebody nothing to look at that you would desire him he just different I offered him power because it filled offer I was if you're borrowing to me I give it a whirl at him he's he first honey devil make that make that offer to anybody he said know who this man is but it's mine refused you whole world but he didn't understand that this man came to claim the whole world he didn't come to get it ever permission for the world he came to clean me that his own what the devil didn't understand is when it noah's d because the devil is not privy to this mystery so when Noah came it was water all of Noah's experiences must bring this type of water to wash the it it's only afterwards no one could look back and say boy wait a minute all them trials and testings was just me being used B instrumentally time for for you to be baptized what Oh glory if I don't even known but it was a mystery being unfolded and it never didn't understand the mystery of even Jesus because if he caught it right there that blood was about to fall blood for man blood for redemption blood for restoration not for power blood for salvation blood for deliverance if the devil understood that when he lived and continues he made sure no blood put them in the incubator but wrap him up in something catch every droplet one drop for but God is a strategist he knows how to do things he knows when to do things he knows what to do in your life to make sure you get the Holy Ghost Oh glory [Applause] friends if your whole life is revealed to you in advance there'll be no mystery listen Abraham go to the ring you you won't have a son oh just make sure this sticks you can have a son in court to Libra Abraham in 25 years no you know you were if God had told me about him in 25 years you're gonna have discern what you wanna do don't do Toma Abraham's first respond maybe Lord 25 years in no no two years oh no it's not you yeah this is no no listen when God told Abraham another son Abraham's expectation was nine months later it Remora little time against him and Sarah what God waited on but god unfolding a mystery and you know what the Bible says abraham staggered not at the promise so Iran and Ola and I thought if he stopped evey stagger physically and but is he promised don't mess with Abraham and not promise his resolve Abadi promised in year one was as strong and as in here 24 because by a year 24 Iran said well this thing had to be closer this one has to be would you wait [Applause] so you can imagine when the Sun comes and Abraham rejoicing in this and when God's a tender offer be son you could imagine Abram would feel but I love and somebody as I say yesterday and it's really true and that I sing it to my own self the certain was I want to stop singing because we here let the weak say I am strong let somebody see yesterday I'm so tired and I say I need to stop seen it because the Bible says to community that are not as though they were let the weak say I am strong because when you see a time you are solidifying it at is you know even Gary Tanner's an opportunity to to be resolved because you know I am this becomes that that I am is powerful that I am construct is what God told Moses to tell people who he was so how you finish that sentence is very important [Applause] how are you doing I didn't want to say it I am sick oh you could finish that sentence when Moses the different of God I say who shall I see sent me is it tell them I am I am that I am finish that sentence I am whatever you need I am healing so when people ask you how you're going I'm getting stronger I am getting better I am going to make it I'm gonna be here don't tell me you're sick you defeated your tire let the weak say I am [Applause] and you watch your life let the poor say I am we say I'm poor I'm poor I'm Eunice anointing is anointed and I'm just I'm saying that you know if you know and your Chinese already if you know how sick your over bah bah bah mean when I tell it's not normal and Chinese there's no normal different what what spirit in what I have it been a new anointing this thing [Music] when you said the change will you talk the devil said that that's what confusing devil because the sacrifice of praise is when you go oppositional this sacrifice means it is not normal for you to give this phrase it's not expecting that you give this phrase but the praise itself becomes a sacrifice because it goes against what is expected so I may not have money but I praise him anyhow my buddy I have to be careful Oh see there now I because we are just enough we started and speak like him oh come on somebody help me this morning listen after a while as you mature as a Christian that's what is not a walk like him he said a talk like him was a act like him so why not practice from today how is your wife she's being delivered right now she brings deliver she don't know it but she been delivered right now how is your son he being delivered to where is he right now he's right where God have him as he being delivered your daughter still when miniskirts I'm not talking about what that is all I know she been delivered give me another example this woman bboy dead any cherish you know but she maven criminals who is always well all is well Belle Grove circulator only thing all is well she not have nothing to do with Belle groves with Allen's whoever it is all is well you go tear up Jes I'm going to the rapture and after a while you make that your way of life you didn't ever say you know what I fed up I live in you just leave in your first season I'm gonna try somewhere else because when I give you stress your worship when you have no sense your worship when you're up your worship when you don't your worship you are slowly persuaded it has come to you as a revelation of who you really are the

you have to repent that's the season we're in you could begin to play something very softly then Daniel in the message revolution becomes symbol at the last he's seen an angel come down put one foot on the land and wanted to see a rainbow over his head you raise up his hands and swore by him that lives forever and ever that time shall be no more at the finishing of that time that he told him in other words this defining of time and we're living in now from the time and coming of the printer to this day and at that time the mystery of God to be finished and the world groaning waiting today people don't know the mystery of God why they've not been taught the mystery of God the only thing they've been taught is joined church put your name on the book be a good fellow treat your neighbor right that's all right but you must know the mystery of God no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book and the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost listen to the Prophet this grand old holy ghost church is going to come out one of these days and shine like you've never seen that's my expectation that's my hope that's my promise God in this last days does the Prophet is going to draw true hearts from everywhere no matter how much counterfeit and Schaaf the devil has God will rise his church right out of it it'll be a ceiling for sure as I'm standing on this platform and the hour is at hand the coal and the formal is weaning away the Evangelic on and the social gospel and all these other things are born the fantastic side is going in such a radical fanaticism till anybody blank and see it but God is pulling his church out Lord I want to be pulled out the Prophet cause unlike the great waterlily the little tiny seed born way down in the bottom of a mire II mucky dirty frogs come upon and it winds its way up through the darkness through all the mud and all this scum and becomes the finest thing that you ever looked into the face of with a radiance like the sunshine so is the Church of the Living God that's being born down in the muder fanaticism and chaos but she's wound her way should a crime until she's on top of the thing just waited for her wings for the flight many shall run to and fro and the people that know their God shall to exploit set still little flock positionally stay where you are that's what's hauling back the coming of Christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really is dormant in the church the Prophet said is here he said after and faith is laying in the message the power is there Oh hallelujah oh my come on church are you ready let's get ready let's get ready let's get ready to leave this whole world behind leave all our cares behind I just want to place these quotes in context for message a guide the Holy Spirit always speaks of the wood I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time bring us into the full statue of sons and daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ that's pork without money is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ come on our church hallelujah Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah now you see the seals friends even if you don't understand it say Amen now this is the word of the Prophet to tie it all together because the word and spirit is going to come together and the spirit can only annoying the word sees in your soul the profit in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said now you see the seals when he was in his minute Oriole work back there redeeming but someday he comes forward to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him but that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that in that he comfort for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb number the bread and said that book doesn't say all mine ever or leave here but that book is a book of mystery and we preached it here before that when the Bible said of virgin shall conceive that was a mystery but that was Mary's name rittany when the book said the voice of one crying in the wilderness that was a mystery but William branham's name was written there so he comes to claim the book and the words in the book oh come on now when he said I'm with the delivering of Israel that was a mystery but Moses name was written there brother sister my name is written there we are the words in the book [Applause] oh when the Bible says the same ones I do shall you do also he is talking about me when he said because I live up you are gonna live also that's my name I refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter that's my name every promise in the book is mine hallelujah Oh sister Christine when the book says about opening the blinded eyes that's where your name is oh come on now find your name this morning find your

never give you more than you can bear there's no trial that can ever overcome you that's impossible stand still and see the salvation of God there's a way of escape this morning there's a sigh from God that you are elected that you are called that you are predestinated the Bible said to comfort one another with these words that we shall not all sleep Oh hallelujah we shall not all sleep for the Lord himself shall descend on heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise there's a rapture coming we which are alive and remain shall
