the bands of wickedness break the bands of evil father said let the captive free father God in the name of Jesus we invite you to have the preeminence 'as reason we ask a demon god bless you and welcome it's good to be here this tonight a leaf of your Bibles I like it a turn to Revelation chapter 7 and you want to read one two for Revelation eat first one one first year an easy kill chapter 9 we want to read 1 to 6 and reading from Revelation chapter 7 says after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth and on the sea nor any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God the cry aloud for his to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in defiance and I heard the number of them which was sealed and they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel revolution did this one and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about his peace of half an hour I won't quote Ezekiel chapter 9 will from verse 1 he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying caused them the half charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold the six men came from the way of the high gate which slide towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man crowed was cluttered with linen with the writers inkhorn by his side and he went and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was calling from the cherub whereupon he wise to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which are the writers inkwon by sight and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and he unto the others he said go here after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither heavy pity slay utterly all and young would means a little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house may God bless his word you may be seated but tonight is strange what we have to share with you tonight but God is good our title the angel from the east that's the title the angel from the east of a context scripture I'm Luke chapter 11 are gonna read it out if you want to read it and this is this one Luke chapter 11 and he came the past as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of these sciples said unto Him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray see our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thus worship unto God knowledge in his name and thy kingdom come you expect in the kingdom and I will be done in as in heaven so into it then the requests give us this day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins what's the condition for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said to them which of you want to get to this which of you have a friend and Charles go on to him at midnight and siient am friend let me try loose for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me I have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and said trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee see and I say unto you doll listen door he will not rise and give him because he is a friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needed and that importunity is because of his persistence because of his nagging he will give as many as he needed and then he said this I see on do you ask it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth so you know we put the foot again not now ass kept receiving he that seeketh find it and he that knocketh it shall be opened so he make it clear is not one knock is not one seek is not one ask is ask seek knock it in other words you're keepin on till you get what you have neither because that friend is not a friend is not gonna come off from his bed because he's a friend he's gonna come up because they are asking that person I have nothing to set before me like that family and I have or that guest that I have I need help I need some bread could you kill me that bread oh gosh I know you're tired I know you had a hard day's work but my friend come from overseas and I have nothing all the stores are closed the restaurants are closed I know you have bread inside the day I saw you buy the bakery you can't tell me to have no bread you have bread inside the dear don't lie you have bread inside there dear bring it out and knead it I cannot move in stay in here good meet me any morning all glory to God your horizon there all glory of Jesus put that parable to give you an idea of your attitude of your persistence of your importunity well glory to God go says Jesus my friend no no you have something I need you have something you want yes something I've got to have Oh glory to God hallelujah he has a Mac he have a seal he have a baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a promise for you Oh glory to God and to your children and the temple afar off even as many as a lot of a God shall call you have an experience for you he have a fire for you he has a powerful you do you want it Oh glory to God know what Jesus is back running this he said he give the all-father prayer I forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us and then you get this parable about a man of a long journey a long journey come to see have nothing to set before me describe this scenario a friend of mine is journey a long journey come to me I have nothing set before him and then the persistence and then he come and said well this is the attitude no he's breaking it on ask it shall be given to you and seek and ye shall find and knock shall be opened to you and to the lazy people who say they went and knock and nobody opened the door and they asked and they didn't get and they seek and didn't find he answer all that lazy behavior he comes out the next level here in that ask at him that knocketh him that seeketh not him that not oh god you're lazy that's why you're not not yet you're not knocking enough hallelujah not seeking enough yeah well I pray no no no yes seek him enough you're not seeking you have to see no there's a reason why I'm reading this because he had a next line here if a son shall ask bread of any of you disease of father will he give him a stone if he ask a fish will he for fish give him a serpent if he asks for an egg will you give him a famous scorpion then he said this if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit them that ask him to them to them that check the pasta ham to death that come and sitting in church and listened and read the word no to them that so this is personal to them that ask him so you get the whole background to show you what is happening and why is the foolish version will remain foolish and while the wines version will be made wise because the wise not taking nothing for granted the wines have extra oil and there's a reason why the wise have extra oil and the foolish oil ran out the Hat you know yes they had a portion you know yes the atmosphere they had it but what they had ran out or dried out hallelujah but this wise version she going to ask she's going to receive many others just talking the talk this wise version going to walk that talk Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God is that pulling a bed one taken one left make sure you are the one that's taken it's an individual affair you have to see it go glory to God Amen let's continue is so much question none says Mr Bowen dong he said to me I couldn't read a revelation there was a bride standing on the Mount Sinai there's a bride up yonder he said there was a bride and the water and the dragon sweating water his mode to make war with her I said miserable and the first thing of it is you've got the wrong thing calling it the brine I said the Jews will stun among Sinai 144,000 the bride correctly was in heaven with Jesus on the dragon that splitter water out of his mouth will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that was this group here that had to go down the remnant of the woman seed and his describing it the sanctified Church without receiving the Holy Ghost that's the ones who make war with that's the people belong just and oppress the here and any message and the fester can clean and they believe God's in a profit and then it just yes this sanctified they have the books they listen to the tapes but they don't have the oil they have nice ministers nice pastors nice elders nice details but when that came come God not ask him for who the pasta who's the elder who is the deacon when that time comes when that time comes God send them angels he said go her glory to God one angel was in the myths he had a cane corn writer he said before these slaughtering angels go go and put a Mac upon those that cyanide or glory to God you have to see something you have to feel something that you must want this I and cry or put a Mac upon them or glory of God hallelujah hallelujah the orders are coming the orders the other angels are coming but they say an angel with the ink one writer same angel is the angel from the east having the seal of the Living God a hundred and forty-four thousand was sealed that was the Jews but before they are sealed there's a Gentile try to be sealed and that's where you come in or glory no God no money put on a mark upon you no manner controlling the smack it's the angel from these that have this seal well glory to God I believe that angel it's going to move tonight I am on an expectation for angels are coming up tonight to put a mass hallelujah there is going to be a bride that's gonna be sealed by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or glow either cords so this is where the Lord the tire hits the road Oh Lord this is a joint church now this is when the tie gets the road this is what the message come to be paid for or glory the seventh seal when it broke it was silence or even half an hour but once that silence is broken everything's happy beneath that God have you undercover in haryana cocoon what have you under something oh and the time of the revelation of these things being made known but once it's completed it's time for the dynamics it's time for the Holy Ghost it's time for the angel from these glories of God hallelujah Oh glory to I - out in the house Oh hallelujah praise God praise God the vision is clear to me hallelujah [Applause] listen to the prophecy here are three tribes always keep them tree in mind this 144,000 that great redeemed bride and the remnant that was left there is to choose there is the seal 144,000 and here the ones that are sanctified that refuse to get the Holy Ghost oh god help us tonight the chase refused to get the Holy Ghost let some man talk them all to receive an Holy Ghost let some man tell them they have it already who

will persecute and and the Roman Church will persecute them but the bride is already raptured and in heaven there they are place exactly so the hundred and forty-four thousand are Jews God's servant and when the Holy Ghost has preached to them they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like they did in the beginning the Gentile dispensation is finished the church is seal away the

are able to pray along little more ask the more that's what the wise was involved in or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah let's continue he said what the doors is about shut the messages went forth is about it's last time just a few to pull like that to get into the kingdom of God notice his words not get the church get into the kingdom of God the doors are closing then the next thing the Jews have got to receive the Holy Ghost and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ along they were pursued made fun of and as soon as the Holy Ghost is represent presented to them they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Gentile church is raptured and those who refuse just walked under just a fiction the dragon drew man powers puts the water which will unite with communism and tip the church into position like that then the gospel goes back to the Jews right there at that time then there will be a revival among those huge right there that will carry thousands and tens stoves 144,000 is the kingdom God will be sealed by the sealing angel so the angel from the east is the ceiling you mean we're over there's a c-major yes I mean you don't hear about that any message you hear about pasta angel and apostle angel and evangelist angel and and and to say Angelica danger but what would this in Julia what what is one here is this silly ninja you know Nathan if I fall or get the Lord a shout of feeling good tonight this Ames have not any fight for this angel from the east is not an if I fall does the angel from the east who God calling this silly angel don't forget them tonight hallelujah is a silly angel and he have a mission to see you he's coming to put a smack upon you Oh glory to God you believe that do you believe that are usually an expectation wrapped a hundred and forty-four thousand into the kingdom of God will be sealed by the semen angel I trust that he is coming from the east and that's the way he is from now on with the ceiling as and I want to be guarded in the air I have sent a persecution here alright and I've got all the 144,000 standing there that's gonna receive the bat Holy Ghost and right there as soon as that's that ceiling angel begins to seal the hundred four thousand the Gentiles door is closed so anytime themself conceived then shadows over close and the Jew secure Holy Ghost reduce the revulsion and they will have a revulsion the entire world and the power of God will be manifested among the Jews power of God all right so what the Holy Ghost is it is your assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's your seal it's your sang I'm heaven bound don't care what the devil see I'm heaven bound why he sealed me he give it to me his see made his kingdom I am glory bum let the winds blow let's see it under what he wants but don't see me til the deal my Redemption that is what the Holy Ghost is you should want it I couldn't go on without it Oh glory to God hallelujah we believe that now this church is the message is being poured into the church this is after Schippers she sits as a shepherd dream was a vision of a man with with water and point only water leaking out then he take our big bucket of honey and pour it into this big rock box and it held and he said the Holy Ghost that represented the Holy Ghost in the church no church could hold it whoa let's go now and about a honey this is good hold the honey is free to forgiveness all right watch in this church is a message the important to the church but the church but in itself here we go this tabernacle we would see that's where she comes to church this tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing the Holy Ghost in okay individuals that come in the discharge is Holy Ghost tabernacle they added Tabernacles that contained the Holy Ghost but not the church in a body or group so that's why nobody could say here is it Jesus already he said when they say look here go follow them look here come here that is not it he said behold the kingdom is within you come on we gotta make sense yours key all that kind of Revelation is it look nice it's so good and so on but it off it's not the word the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals give the Lord a shout on that [Applause] Parabellum should we speak in tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes it a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God this rock mud if you choose now has to be first and when you have faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and coordination but love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he sees the church ages as a unit so the church ages has to be sealed as a unit hallelujah hallelujah and the individual has to be seen as a unit so them seven things had to be in you then Duncan the Holy Ghost and seeing the whole buildin love seal all the virtues in that Nunley coat he said because a little patience they can leak out temperance you can leak out this and Rico that but when that holy was come and sealed the whole thing you become a sealed unit of the Lord God Oh glory with a mark on you with an address with a destination grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption glory to God God put that mark and said redeemed Oh glory to God a redeemed son he ticked you off [Applause] let's continue then the holy ghost come down and ceaseless unit the same as you seen the church is the unit the way he mix the way he makes his bride okay the way he makes his bride is the way he makes this individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from his side he has the things that you have to have faith here we go you can't impersonate them god bless you Brenda sweetie sweetie spirit somebody who take too much of sweets like something an amount ice talking night adversity unity katsu and cap me when you started with so say meow meow change

imitation only country causes confusion to be taken a lot more listen to this his brain in the second Lord he said look let us pray he's a blessed heavenly father tonight at the beginning of this revival as our time I wrapped up now on a little pass I pretty to be merciful to these people and grant Almighty God here tonight at least twenty hands went up in the building that I needed Christ Oh God it's their souls the spirit the oil the oil is just about burned out there won't be much more when the last drop is gone from the bucket or the cantina there will be no more oil put in lamps they

the holy spirit and make them raise your hands and see them from a life of sin granted father he's talking about that bucket when the last drop is gone from the bucket or the container there'll be no

take its turn with the Holy Ghost Bunch he calls a bunch of people and last days a Holy Ghost Bunch not no message bunch of Holy Ghost Bunch I want to be patted at Holy Ghost Bunch or glory to God some some drunk looking people the trunk with new line the trunk but revelation the cave keeps still because it's the Holy Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive all over me it's the Holy Ghost and fire this is Bella Brennan when the enemy come like a flood I'll read the Sun's up against it that's right and the church has taken a stand I mean the Holy Ghost Church and that is what I'm interested in friends when I'm here oh dear I'll pray for the sick but in here I'm interested in one thing that is God's born-again Church that is what I'm interested in anyhow I am NOT interested in bylaws Deacons and so forth like that orders of churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day that we are living in go to the Lord and show yes the Lord has show hallelujah not by laws or glory to God but the Holy Ghost upon the church the Holy Ghost upon you I am NOT the Holy Ghost I come upon you okay the Lord comes upon you has to come upon you Oh glory to God you may be seated [Applause] [Music] when Jesus was walking with them pizza and all I'm gonna say I have the Holy Ghost because I will goes with them even Jesus tell them he say I will not leave you comfortless come when I was with you but shall be in you so what was with them had to come in them let me say it again because the dynamics is yet power is here everything you see here up to you see everything present tense God is here everything is here but that to be translated Jesus had was a recently dead give them clarity of understanding by Oprah understanding open the seals of the Old Testament that I'm the word they had the understanding open the wooden open didn't know what they had to get he didn't give them the understanding educate them in only no more than the Pharisees that wasn't it wasn't it was revelation that they could come under expectation for their manifestation so when God identified with stammering lips and another tongue identify Jewish Scripture shall come to pass support my spirit Jesus taught descriptors to them he was reading the courts he was bringing an Old Testament prophecy and said this is what have to come that's why when Peter come he said this is that because Jesus should exact that the Prophet Joel speak of peace our could identify this manifestation is because of this prophecy here Laurie [Applause] [Music] when Jesus overcome Satan in the wilderness and he came to the chamber what did Jesus do he find the place where it was written he found his scriptures and he said the spirit upon me and they thought he was just reading scripture then he said this is that this scripture is fulfilling your ears so Jesus thought was to find his scripture to identify himself with the bride has to find her scriptures to identify yourself with we are not going to identify with foolish virgins remnant of the woman's seed revolution since we not identify with that I call them jubilation since let's continue there are two types of Christianity's seem strange I would not say two different types I say two different phases will be a better word to use not two types two phases simcha sanity but two phases of it one of them is an intellectual or mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart and ported him going to church but didn't believe the message both her and her books and tips but one have an experimental experience here and the other one of a heading but not missing services Oh give the loss embraces intellectually is hunger in one he's feasting on God his feet doesn't allow the other one seems that the victory all the time nothing but us then they're just a solid an anchor as they can be no trials no storms bother them at all but they seem to have something about them the people who are Christians trying to live for God admire that type of Christian and I often wondered Lord what is it that these people have that the others create so much for oh my hallelujah something is in the heart same aside shells in manager no but something is new heart he's a denied Christ because runaway Pittacus but something happened in his heart in the upper room the devil got kicked told this snake got firebombed and God sat down on the tool of his heart and Peter was a changed man same pictures I take a picture of him on Instagram be the same brother Peter same face him kiss him everything but he had change Oh glory to God somebody else inside of that man Oh glory to God His Holy Ghost and fire inside of that man it proved different and NASA Sapphira came lion in the church it come out of him it's a power it's a hidden power it comes out as we might need Peter was looking to give the man money at the gate called beautiful he had no money but he remembered what he had he had his selves and all right number what I have I can give you man folklore I could give you that thing what I have will glory rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ because I am now connected to the source itself or whoever sourcing me other power in me I'm an efficient well in me Oh 20 on tech or glory dog or I am connected director diviner I am a branch and the power from the vine flow through me as my father send me jesus said so son are you he was a powerhouse he was connected to the very source itself or glory to God so the Spirit of God was flowing through the line through that branch to whosoever will or give the Lord a shout this is what caught one for you will see profit look in the second chapter of Joshua find out here that I believe in harlot named Rahab Gentile harlots across the river and when they come into the Promised Land the spies went over the spout all of our family was safe under the talking now remember listen God's destroying angel on earth at talking and when the churches went down the mayor fell the city went down the king went down the governor the educated the pretty woman the handsome man the important all-sufficient everything went wrong that wasn't under the token so will it be in the coming of the Son of God his destroying angel will destroy everything who hasn't got the total of the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon them to show that you are being identified and died yourself to your sacrifice and are born into the Spirit of God and seal there by the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah take a debt born and they're sealed in there by the Holy Ghost oh my do you believe that and in the last days there'll be only two kinds of people two classes of people then that has the seal and the others that will have the mark of the beast so the seed of God is the Baptist of the Holy Spirit and the mark of the beast is not a stamp on your hand the mark of the beast is rejecting the scene of God you take the mark of the beast the first thing you know the time will come when you will be God will give a message that annual beasts Tilden or CeeLo the kingdom of God oh my I wonder if that time is on a zipper currently a fresh message a fresh prophecy of the prophecy Oh hallelujah prophecy a message of the seed of God Oh hallelujah oh man read it again the time will come when you call it will give a message who will give a message God will give a message now what the percentage is he said one he said the world will hear direct from God once more he's not talked about himself now he talked about the spirit and the brand the Prophet will say the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the world once more the world will hear Tigra from God how will you know it's the voice of God it will be a manifestation of the prophets world that is how you're gonna lose the voice of God not I explained this that we in this new a manifest this is that that the Prophet William Branham speak of or give the Lord a shout in other words here is a seventh on the revival this is that that the Prophet said that there will come a time when people fly from everywhere to see the seven thunders being manifested this is that that the Prophet take of the bride had my revival yet it will take them seven thunders to wake up the bride again there has been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it then we have to sit this is that that the Prophet said look he's in it look at here or give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah identifying what the prophet prophecy is Oh glory to God because when you take the book from the angel the only prophesy according to the book you can't have your own prophecy give the Lord a praise I think I want to see that again the voice that John good means you take the book and almost prophesy again Jose well you know what I go to defeat the prophesied this and prophesy that he's just et book the words in his mouth he has to speak from the prophecy of the book prophesied the nation to tongue to Kings that wake ago any part of this world and prophesy or yes we could prophesy to Kings and portentous and countries and nations or glory and prophesied to the bright rule until the church member we could prophesied judgment to the church and deliver us a redemption to the bride we could prophesy deliverance for your family we could prophesy The Times front of the Jubilee of the grace of God Queen Alia loved ones the spirit of the bride say come or glory the club after that closing time is judgment to declare the day of vengeance of our God let's continue quickly there brother if you have them if you haven't got the bathroom all he goes this morning run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can the ceilin time is on one day I'll have a message that title the Sicilian time is on oh what a time he prophesized the time of the revelation of these things being made known come and dine ella was prophesied there's a long time 50-plus years of the revelation of these things being made known this message on books and Tifa to go in all languages all the world how to have a period of time God is you wonder controlling time because it's a time and season for everything under heaven we could want this and want that but if God has any time is not yet it's not yet sometimes what have a lingering time Moses gotta be in a manner an action but guacho 40-plus years the true Moses in the wilderness to give him some time to the bay coat and right mode and get ready to go back to Egypt Oh glory to God as much as the people want to deliverance data wait until movie was ready well glory record because Moosa was immature and he didn't have the mindset yet he never met the pillar fire yet he wasn't activated yet he was just intellectual Oh glory recovered the knowledge of the word of what he was supposed to do but until the fire come he can go on commission he got a feeling let the world be Egypt but no power with fear of a lake up failure will lick you up you can't go down there with no power first man that guy Moses just brushes off the tongue run straight out and take a 40 years vacation and after that God's the time up I had because my people attend the call this man this man cool cool cool seen what sheep and goat and buying furniture or anything like that we actually relax relax go see this this is the Kiowa till a fire come and drop down there Moses walking down Rama II see fire and he said with this bodies in the Berlin I gotta see this thing he gone with camera to take pictures say you go and put that on Facebook when he hit so God said take off your shoes recognizes a different experience or they get a fire stick that man transform that man when he going down there why pass him when you're going he said to Egypt he said to take over it's a five minutes all this long long long weary nonhumans five minutes in the presence of that teller fire taught Moses more than the forty years or how much years in Egypt fibers and what we mean we have five minutes I've already messing this five minutes not two hours that four hours five minutes everything changes all Waker overcome or lavinia fight and you can stop this unsub that five minutes decide - nothing my presence you know and the presence of the pillar far just life just five minutes at that John fellows one dead Daniel fellows dead but a venomous packed in a corner numb for days he say nobody blessings but your tone about the power who give the Lord a shout this five minutes just just five minutes nice the games thanks the play in church this is five minutes in the press of the purifier like completely change and transform or glory no clock no wonder why PETA was tough what's what's believe I upside down after that fire come inside and they don't care no more they beat them and they're still come to church they are prideful sick leave and stay on Wednesday night they still come to church understand Lord God send back power that we could go back out there and every filled with the Holy Ghost these are the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost [Applause] say brother sister if you haven't got the back lawn he goes this morning rather to the kingdom I've got as quick as you can the Stephen time is on the enemy come like a flood he's raising the standard again set the drama is set the church is going home just as certain as anything see you haven't got to wait long with the wait friend you haven't got all the time to hurt he said did you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast Antichrist anyone knows that the Antichrist his mark is a mark of power you see a piece is a power there's a power of the Catholic Church there's a power of the Methodist Church the power message that's the Beast power the Baptist Church the same Carmelite Lutheran all of them Pentecostal as bad but grieve not the Holy Spirit Ephesians 4:30 wherever you are sealed until their Redemption now what does Eden mean season is a sign of completion so why would God put the seal and you're not completed see you see you see what seal what is finished seal what is completed so got put in a Mac by the wood on you to fill you with the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah now to explain that part listen to the reference but a random make you so Jesus made a reference I body the man that came late and and went in even ask for Lowe's and they went right don't see you Court give the Holy Ghost I would ask him he do all that that but I can read to bring Mountain to show that you have to activate him listen to Power Man unknown he said well you did you ever see a real rude alluding the cars this will work ours he will go out and will set so much dear I'm so much dear then the inspector comes back and looks in and if this a little loose it shakes nope I won't seal it got to tear it out and do it over again next thing he would try to load it again he will get this one wrong he's become back wrong do it again that is what God has been doing with this church for a long time you load up and you're going to heaven you're taking everything with you your card games every other thing you can load into the church you're trying to take with you God just condemns it you ain't ready for Ceylon but when God sees a man contrite you don't hear what I would no more broken spirit sincere heart don't let the altar you do see that no more nobody's in no Holton or more God closes the door to the world to him and seals in India by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus come I am a preaching Pentecostal I am preaching the Holy Ghost which is what is God promised this has nothing to do with the Pentecostal church we're not talking about that Oh glory to God God didn't kick out justification because I profit come he didn't he called sonification because I profit come you need justification you need sanctification you need a bath only goes and the middle word Oh give the Lord a shout let me say that again not because the Prophet come you dismiss everything else when that box car doors closed and the government see this put on it it cannot be opened no more on televisions finally the destination he said now when a greenery falls on the earth no matter if that gonna be dice itself it can't produce a Taco Bell to save its soul a greener eat will bring forth a green or wheat and the Holy Spirit leading the church leads it in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's men who leave us leaden Oh glory to God so but over the Holy Ghost is the power exactly the Bible is a road map the road map the power feet takes you there Oh glory to God power to do what reproduce a promise ain't ain't power cometh out the shakin just for long it's the produced a promise power come to identify the promise when Paulo come upon Jesus the Bible says he returned in the power of the Spirit and then in the power of the Spirit define the scripture what was promised the Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me or glory to God that was the promise of the hour he identified with it and the power push through the channel of that prophecy and there's a book the manifestation the Messiah or give the Lord a salt India was this commission under bright commission to declare the day of vengeance of our God to finish the Commission Oh hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh I love him he said no when you hit a bone you're the trouble chicken away it really blown away so if I preach tonight I've appreciated hit a bone if we see that the bone just put it one aside you eatin cherry pie you're on the seat you know Charlie Parra we just recently so you do the same thing in listen to this I believe the reason there is so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it is not correctly taught I believe the baptism is taught and just say baptism but when you say automobile no I've got several mechanics in the church I don't know one thing about it so if I make a mistake is I'm another mechanic there are coils plugs points vowels everything else that makes an automobile so when you talk about baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot that goes with that so you can all the experience and says you're one do one without transition I want to feel I want to move you come from a Methodist or in some holiness people don't think the same yeah I'm talk about somebody went about hallelujah some some fiery Holy Ghost and everybody acoustic look to me but just how do you do that twice I mean if every night turn back after what you want to leave after a feeling very uncomfortable because for months preceding with spiritual this is equal informal fanatics you hear that spirit for nothing to you know but have formal want to tell me one stiff before the ominous what usually does and they say they see their name on the book but is not doing what John do I taught John's at the dance and shout and praise God because in America but em check Italians took it out of them don't you watch ensue and the name on the book I didn't even know what good put my name on a book and I can't praise and worship god I can't bless God I can't value the love of God yeah yeah yeah born in sin she of iniquity the grace of God come and take my eyes over the Catholic I was any pizza room go ahead put extra materials to get me on today extra extra power come Monday it's not easy to leave the garbage using room that's lucky Tonia if you're more than 8 your father Mitch of everybody in it will even go when I call the whole family might but boy you don't enjoy you don't want freedom I was glad the whole family mad No one by one game baptized in Jesus name then we'll get glad to it will give me Joyce because one son crossover or Gloria and God will rejoice when you cross over to my mind now watch he still of Peter said faith know what should not reclose we're gonna teach this for a few minutes feet now and act your faith virtue and virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience to patience godliness God miss brotherly love very loved and loved anyone knows that love is God no then then that then that brings this into seven church ages God is building seven inches a Bride of Christ true Philadelphia anti-terror and so on like that right he said then watch and if the bridegroom awake in the first watch of the seventh watch all these versions are weak they walk the verges of Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia Odisha did you notice that it was the seventh age when he came woke up the sleeping virgin that brings them all the way back down to there but in test to the years ages he has built a bride born a bride be caught in a bridal hood for Christ and the same way he baguettes this bride he has to be got individuals so the bride was was formed to seven ages so therefore he is seen the individuals have to be formed to seven steps okay now let me hear what I'm back drawing in this you know he says know these things formally virtues here absolutely must be in the Christian before the Holy Ghost ever seals them before this comes down on top and makes a complete unit these things have to be in hallelujah I'm gonna finish this Omniguide he said a reason the comment of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who what is what he is how he lives his nature his being you supposed to be all the way up there by that time and that brings us to the full statue of sons and daughters of God a church just washing the blood that's bottled money not at the start at the finishing of the seventh seal we supposed to be we up dear right David brotherly kindness right there with the spirit of forgiveness right there without street and no interment a woman come to full nine months she's pregnant come to full nine months and that sweet spirit come around her right up to

for the dynamics that will take her off the earth into glory in the rapture I believe on my heart he is the dynamics not no man is the dynamics he is the dynamics that's like no man kept in the revival he is the dynamics or plan of God we just become members of the machine of his body formula ourselves in His image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper we are waiting on watching for that the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have work in a small measure while the
