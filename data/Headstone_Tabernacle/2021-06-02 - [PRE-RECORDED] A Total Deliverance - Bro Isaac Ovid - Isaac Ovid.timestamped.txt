[19:27] name of jesus christ

[19:32] amen amen amen give the lord a hand of
[19:36] praise
[19:38] amen so i greet you this morning thank
[19:41] you musicians
[19:42] in the precious name of jesus christ
[19:44] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[19:46] in the house
[19:47] of god once more i'd like to get
[19:50] straight to the word if you have your
[19:51] bibles
[19:52] we're going to read from one scripture
[19:54] this morning
[19:55] from the book of exodus we're going to
[19:58] read from
[19:59] exodus chapter 3.
[20:04] i really want to acknowledge the
[20:06] messages last sunday
[20:08] but all his messages what uh what a
[20:10] sunday last sunday was
[20:12] amen amen may god give him strength in
[20:14] his body
[20:15] as he continues to fight the battle and
[20:18] if you haven't heard those messages i
[20:20] encourage you to listen to
[20:21] those messages from last week and you
[20:23] will be blessed amen
[20:26] so really from exodus chapter three
[20:29] and reading from verse seven
[20:33] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[20:35] affliction
[20:36] of my people which are in egypt
[20:40] and i've heard they cry by reason of
[20:42] their task masters
[20:45] for i know their sorrows and i am come
[20:49] down to deliver them out
[20:51] of the hand of the egyptians and to
[20:52] bring them up out of
[20:54] that land onto a good land and a large
[20:58] under a land flowing with milk and honey
[21:00] under the place of the canaanites and
[21:02] the hittites
[21:03] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[21:06] the hivites and the jebusites
[21:08] now therefore behold the cry of the
[21:10] children of israel has come
[21:12] unto me and i have also seen the
[21:14] oppression wherewith the
[21:16] egyptians oppress them come now
[21:18] therefore and i will send thee unto
[21:20] pharaoh
[21:21] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[21:23] the children of
[21:25] israel out of egypt shall we bow our
[21:28] heads once
[21:29] more for word of prayer lord god i pray
[21:31] that you bless the reading of the word
[21:33] this morning
[21:34] open our understanding and lord we're
[21:37] not just here to have a service for the
[21:39] formality of it but we are here to see
[21:41] the gospel preached in power
[21:43] and demonstration may you walk out the
[21:45] pages of the bible and
[21:47] speak to your people this morning in the
[21:49] precious theme of jesus christ and the
[21:50] church says
[21:52] amen you may be seated this morning
[21:55] so i have a title this morning and my
[21:58] title this morning
[21:59] is a total deliverance
[22:02] and my inspiration is the egyptians you
[22:05] see today
[22:07] you shall see them
[22:08] [Music]
[22:10] no more and i took a
[22:13] similar thought on wednesday night in
[22:16] the martin and i spoke on
[22:17] coming out of egypt
[22:21] and i brought a thought to the church
[22:23] that
[22:24] no doubt while the children of israel
[22:26] were in egypt
[22:27] they would have observed certain customs
[22:29] and certain traditions that
[22:32] they were used to even if they had to do
[22:33] it in secret there were certain things
[22:35] that were ingrained in them as a people
[22:37] but even though they would worship and
[22:39] even though they would talk about god
[22:41] they were still
[22:42] in bondage and they were still in egypt
[22:44] and there are many people who are
[22:46] in church and they are in egypt but the
[22:49] wrath brother ovid spoke last week and
[22:51] he talked about people
[22:52] walking with the ball and the chain they
[22:54] come in the church but they are tied up
[22:55] they come at the church but they are in
[22:57] bondage and
[22:58] i have a great burden and a great desire
[23:00] to see a total deliverance because
[23:02] that's what jesus came for that's what
[23:04] the message came for and that's what
[23:06] brother branham preached he preached a
[23:07] message
[23:08] called a total deliverance and and
[23:10] that's where i want to strike on this
[23:11] morning because
[23:12] whenever you find yourself in your
[23:14] christian journey and
[23:15] you can't shout and you can't pray and
[23:17] you can't worship and
[23:19] you need to get somebody to support you
[23:21] and push you and move you
[23:22] there's something that needs to be
[23:24] delivered because if you are
[23:26] free you all of a sudden things look
[23:28] different things sound different the
[23:30] world has a different meaning to you you
[23:32] are so excited
[23:33] it doesn't matter what the country does
[23:35] what the government does what your boss
[23:37] does
[23:38] because nothing is tied to you you are
[23:40] delivered from the things of this world
[23:42] you are delivered
[23:43] from the lust of the eyes the laughter
[23:45] the flesh the pride of life you are
[23:46] delivered
[23:47] from trying to make money you are
[23:49] delivered i'm trying to please somebody
[23:51] you are delivered
[23:52] from trying to impress somebody you are
[23:54] delivered from trying to be like
[23:55] somebody else you are delivered
[23:57] from just being like everybody else you
[23:59] are delivered from your past from your
[24:01] failures from your mistakes from your
[24:04] sin from your condemnation
[24:06] and that's what the devil holds over so
[24:08] many of us he holds it over us
[24:11] but when jesus died of blood the blood
[24:14] came to bring a total
[24:15] deliverance god doesn't want
[24:18] part deliverance god don't want you in
[24:20] here shout him and you're gonna go back
[24:22] home to deal with stuff
[24:23] at home god wants to bring a total
[24:25] deliverance up
[24:26] in your house in your marriage in your
[24:29] children
[24:30] your wife has got to be delivered i
[24:32] don't care what condition she is in
[24:34] your husband has got to be delivered
[24:36] doesn't matter to me what's going on
[24:38] your children they've got to be
[24:40] delivered
[24:42] oh can the church say man and you are
[24:45] going to be delivered
[24:47] you are going to be set free the joy of
[24:49] the lord
[24:50] will be your strength the joy of the
[24:52] lord will be all over you
[24:54] nobody's going to have to push you
[24:56] you're going to be pushing your way
[24:58] power because the law and the prophets
[25:00] were until
[25:01] john but since that time the kingdom is
[25:04] preached
[25:05] and every man pressed into it so we are
[25:08] talking about pressing
[25:09] to your deliverance pressing towards
[25:11] your portion
[25:12] pressing towards the holy ghost i can't
[25:15] press for you
[25:16] the pastor cannot press for you the
[25:18] minister cannot press for you
[25:20] your husband can't press for you your
[25:22] children cannot press for you
[25:24] your wife cannot press for you but the
[25:27] kingdom is preached
[25:28] up and every man he pressed himself up
[25:31] so you he came this morning to press up
[25:33] we came this morning
[25:35] desperate because we need to be
[25:37] delivered
[25:39] you may be seated oh it's starting to
[25:41] get a little warmer here this morning
[25:44] and all you holier endowed christians
[25:46] who say i'm already delivered
[25:48] don't you know this body has to be
[25:50] delivered for you to go into the rapture
[25:52] we all need deliverance at some point in
[25:55] our journey
[25:56] we are talking about a total deliverance
[25:58] up you are not totally delivered
[26:00] until you are on your way to the rapture
[26:02] because this flesh
[26:03] has sin built in but one of these days
[26:06] that
[26:06] god is going to change this flesh up
[26:08] he's going to change your mind up
[26:10] he's gonna change your heart he said a
[26:12] new heart i'm gonna give you
[26:14] and i'm gonna put a new spirit inside of
[26:16] there
[26:17] and i'm gonna put my spirit inside of
[26:20] here
[26:20] that's what i'm talking about not coming
[26:22] to church
[26:23] i am tired of church i'm not here to
[26:26] hear a good sermon
[26:27] i'm not here to hear a new mystery i
[26:29] want total deliverance
[26:31] i don't want to be the same way no more
[26:33] i don't want to come to church the same
[26:35] way no more
[26:36] i want to wake up in the morning and say
[26:38] satan where you at
[26:40] i'm coming for my children i'm coming
[26:42] from my family
[26:43] i'm taking back up every inch of ground
[26:46] i've been in punish for so long but i'm
[26:49] crying i'm
[26:50] i'm tired and god has heard the cries of
[26:53] his people
[26:54] and he has come down to deliver you are
[26:56] not doing to deliver him
[26:58] but he has come down and he will deliver
[27:02] he will deliver he will deliver he
[27:06] will deliver he will deliver i don't
[27:09] think you get it but he will deliver
[27:11] it's not your might it's not your power
[27:14] but it's by the spirit
[27:16] of the lord you are going to be
[27:17] delivered from that no praise
[27:20] demon you are going to be delivered from
[27:22] that lust spirit
[27:23] you are going to be delivered from that
[27:25] man in the world that woman in the world
[27:28] the lust of the eyes glory to god

[28:05] of jesus

[28:22] your way

[28:32] house we will
[28:34] serve the lord i'm not in the message
[28:37] i'm in the pride
[28:38] and there's a rapture to go to there are
[28:40] some sick people that need healing
[28:42] there are some black sliders that need

[28:45] supposed to be
[28:46] in the house of god this morning but the
[28:48] devil has them chained up
[28:50] tied up tangled up wrapped up but this
[28:53] morning
[28:53] we send the bloodhound after them we

[29:11] and it's got to come
[29:12] forth it's got to bring forth it's got
[29:15] to be manifested
[29:16] because god said so and so shall it be
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:23] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[29:26] you may be seated i'm tired this morning
[29:30] i'm tired this morning enough is enough
[29:33] in my life this morning
[29:34] that's how i feel what good is it to
[29:37] come to church
[29:38] and go back home the same way you came
[29:40] you're wasting your time
[29:42] but this morning i want to go back
[29:44] different i don't want to be part
[29:46] delivered
[29:47] but lord i'm ready this morning for a
[29:49] complete breakthrough
[29:51] a complete deliverance
[29:56] hallelujah you may be seated
[29:59] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[30:03] help us this morning jesus i've heard
[30:06] the cries of my
[30:08] people by reason of their task masters
[30:11] by reason you may be seated in the bible
[30:13] says of their taskmasters
[30:16] their cries were not by their own choice
[30:19] their cries would not impress anybody
[30:22] the cries were by reason
[30:24] of their taskmasters the oppression of
[30:27] the taskmasters
[30:29] was so painful was so traumatic
[30:32] was so deep into their lives that they
[30:35] were compelled to crime
[30:37] talking about it didn't work anymore
[30:39] reasoning about it didn't know
[30:41] anymore the only cause of action that
[30:44] was left to them was to cry
[30:46] and god somehow he connects like any
[30:49] father
[30:50] when you hear the baby crying there's a
[30:52] deep call into her teeth
[30:54] and there's a tip to respond up that's
[30:56] why the bible said if my people
[30:58] who are called by my name
[31:01] will humble themselves and pray
[31:04] [Music]
[31:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[31:11] cry sigh desperate
[31:15] desperate no longer accepting things
[31:18] the way they are as if that's your
[31:21] portion
[31:21] your portion is not in egypt your
[31:24] portion is not in the world of
[31:26] what does it profit a man to gain the
[31:27] world and lose his soul
[31:30] but but isaac this is a simple message
[31:32] yes it's a simple message
[31:34] because people know a lot of stuff but
[31:36] there's still stuff in their closet
[31:42] i'll say that again people know a lot of
[31:44] scriptures
[31:45] but there's still stuff hiding in the
[31:47] closet
[31:50] i'll say it again people read the
[31:52] prophet's message
[31:53] but you could quote me on this there's
[31:55] stuff hiding in the closet
[31:57] well i got news for you the total
[31:59] deliverance
[32:00] is to empty out the closet there's no
[32:03] longer anything
[32:04] hiding in the closet there's no more
[32:06] guilt
[32:07] there's no more shame there's no more
[32:09] condemnation
[32:10] it's underneath the blood underneath
[32:17] oh anybody know what i'm talking about
[32:19] this morning
[32:20] because when it's under the blood and
[32:22] there's no more condemnation with a
[32:24] stephen
[32:24] you could go boldly to the throne and
[32:26] say god it's my promise
[32:29] and i want it there's no condemnation
[32:31] you can come to a prayer meeting
[32:33] different
[32:34] when there's no condemnation but my
[32:36] bible tells me
[32:37] there is therefore now no condemnation
[32:39] to them that are in christ jesus come on
[32:42] now somebody
[32:43] oh the devil's got you tied up
[32:46] tangled up but there's a way of escape
[32:49] this morning
[32:50] that's what the blood came for to pull
[32:52] you out of your condition
[32:53] to deliver you from your situation and
[32:56] to place you
[32:57] positionally in the body of christ you
[33:00] are going to be adopted
[33:01] you are going to be perfected you are
[33:03] going to have seven living virtues
[33:05] can the church say man
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:14] you may be seated
[33:18] you have to forgive me but i have it out
[33:21] for the devil
[33:22] it's a real difference in your walk when
[33:25] you start looking for trouble
[33:26] and this morning i'm looking for trouble
[33:29] because when the children of israel
[33:31] had to go into the promised land they
[33:33] were looking for trouble
[33:34] the enemy didn't expect him but god told
[33:37] them in the bible
[33:38] i come to bring you out and take them up
[33:41] out of that land onto a good land
[33:43] and a large onto a land flowing with
[33:45] milk and honey
[33:47] they didn't get milk and honey in egypt
[33:49] but there was a promise of milk and
[33:51] honey
[33:52] and unto the place of the canaanites and
[33:55] the hittites
[33:56] and the amorites and the parasites and
[33:59] the hivites
[34:00] and the jebusites in other words it's
[34:02] not going to be an easy walk
[34:04] to get to that land flowing with milk
[34:06] and honey
[34:07] you're going to have to deal with the
[34:08] canaanites and all of their spirits
[34:10] and all of their situations and when you
[34:13] overcome them
[34:14] you're going to have to deal with the
[34:15] hittites and when you finish with them
[34:17] you're going to have to deal with the
[34:18] amorites so i don't know who you
[34:20] fighting this morning but i've got news
[34:22] for you keep on fighting
[34:23] maybe it's the parasites but they're
[34:25] going to be finished too
[34:26] maybe it's the heaviest but we are
[34:28] coming for them maybe it's a jebusites
[34:30] up but every inch of ground
[34:33] we are taken back this morning come on
[34:35] you sons of god
[34:36] draw your swords this morning wherever
[34:39] there's a item
[34:40] tell them we are looking for them we are
[34:43] not back in town
[34:45] there's no compromise to the baptism of
[34:47] the holy ghost
[34:48] there is no compromise to total healing
[34:51] there's no compromise
[34:52] to sister christine's eyes of being open
[34:55] i will not
[34:56] compromise on the young people's revival
[34:59] i will not compromise
[35:00] on the young people being delivered i
[35:02] will not compromise
[35:04] until i see everything
[35:06] [Applause]
[35:14] every name written shall be delivered
[35:18] every name shall be delivered that's my
[35:21] scripture
[35:22] that's my promise that's my inheritance
[35:25] every name shall be delivered of every
[35:28] name
[35:29] shall be delivered how do you know your
[35:31] name is there
[35:32] there's a connection to the word when
[35:34] the word is preached you say amen
[35:36] there's something it's not your literal
[35:38] name but when i talk about the holy
[35:40] ghostland

[38:14] in every kind of church there are three
[38:17] kinds of believers
[38:18] i understand that brother branham taught
[38:21] us that
[38:21] but you see the true believers in this
[38:23] church we have a responsibility
[38:26] to make a revival to turn the
[38:28] temperature
[38:29] in this place so hot that the
[38:31] unbelievers will be uncomfortable
[38:33] and the make-believers will be
[38:34] uncomfortable don't let
[38:36] somebody gummed up with condemnation but
[38:39] eat and
[38:39] wait into the service you worship god
[38:42] downstairs
[38:43] outside in the back you praise god
[38:46] because the promise of the holy ghost is
[38:48] for you
[38:50] [Applause]
[38:57] you may be seated
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:02] i feel like brother over this morning my
[39:04] guns are loaded this morning but
[39:05] deterrence

[39:08] rocket launchers
[39:09] i'm heavily armed i'm almost dangerous
[39:12] there's a fugitive look out for me right
[39:14] now i'm a fugitive of the devil's
[39:16] kingdom
[39:17] i escaped this morning i escaped
[39:21] they're looking for me this morning but
[39:22] i escaped and i'm
[39:24] armed and dangerous i'm almost dangerous
[39:27] because i'm here this morning to help
[39:29] other sons
[39:30] escape to help other daughters escape we

[39:42] portion
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:45] oh hallelujah we are the escape ones
[39:50] you may be seated from a message of
[39:52] total deliverance
[39:53] but the branham said and this is why i
[39:55] feel so radical this morning
[39:57] but the brandon said we want complete
[40:00] deliverance
[40:01] we don't want to be a halfway church we
[40:03] want to be a real church
[40:05] or no church at all send me home if you
[40:08] want to play games but if you want to be
[40:10] a real church
[40:12] [Applause]
[40:15] you may be seated but the brandon said
[40:17] we want to be real christians
[40:19] or no christians at all we want total
[40:22] deliverance
[40:23] from our habits from our sins from our
[40:27] evil thinking
[40:28] from our evil doing from our negligence
[40:31] when you neglect to pray and you neglect
[40:34] to read
[40:34] and you neglect the fast and you neglect
[40:37] to be in the spirit
[40:38] we want deliverance so it's not about
[40:40] coming to church
[40:41] but it's about that daily walk up
[40:44] walking like jesus
[40:45] talking like jesus living like jesus
[40:53] we want total deliverance from our
[40:56] habits
[40:57] the stuff that is hard for you to break
[40:59] that's what we come against this morning
[41:02] the stuff that you act you accepted as
[41:04] this is who i am that's what we're
[41:06] coming for this morning
[41:08] the stuff that you wrongly claim that is
[41:11] how god make me and
[41:12] my attitude that's what we're coming for
[41:14] this morning
[41:15] that part of you that can't talk to your
[41:17] brother can't talk to your neighbor
[41:19] can't love your enemy that's what we're
[41:21] coming for this morning
[41:23] any behavior any attitude any action
[41:27] any conduct that is not christ-like we
[41:30] serve it notice this morning
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:38] and listen to what the prophet said
[41:41] we want total deliverance
[41:44] there's also a purpose so that when
[41:47] people come
[41:48] into this church to be prayed for
[41:51] they'll be just this little group maybe
[41:54] not over a hundred or two setting here
[41:56] but they'll be completely in the hands
[41:58] of god
[41:59] and when we pray then god
[42:02] will hear from heaven god wants somebody
[42:06] that he can hold in his hands
[42:08] somebody that he can say i got
[42:10] confidence in
[42:11] i can send this my sick servant to the
[42:14] branham tabernacle at jeffersonville
[42:16] and this morning i could say i could
[42:18] send this my sick servant
[42:20] to the headstone tabernacle in trinidad
[42:22] and that group of people
[42:24] and one are called i claim it for this
[42:26] church
[42:28] that's my job to claim it for this
[42:30] church every minister should claim it
[42:32] for their church
[42:32] but i'm claiming it for this church that
[42:34] the sick could walk in here
[42:36] and we pray and they are healed
[42:40] [Applause]
[42:42] hallelujah
[42:43] [Music]
[42:47] [Applause]
[42:50] [Music]
[42:56] a total total
[43:00] surrender total
[43:03] commitment total sacrifice
[43:07] completely yielded only his will
[43:11] only his plans only his words
[43:15] only his places that he wants you to go
[43:25] redemption we know is in two parts
[43:29] it's coming out of and it's going
[43:32] into you can't go into until you come
[43:36] out of
[43:38] and within the church there are people
[43:40] at different stages those who have come
[43:41] out of stuff
[43:42] and you have yet to go in
[43:46] those who haven't come out they're those
[43:48] who doing the death walk
[43:50] walking around in circles
[43:55] one day you're in the victory and you're
[43:56] conquering and shouting then
[43:58] two weeks later you can't find yourself
[44:02] you have lost the joy you've lost the
[44:04] zeal you've lost the passion
[44:06] you find yourself like david but david
[44:08] didn't just sit there and say lord i'm
[44:10] depressed
[44:11] he said lord restore unto me
[44:14] the joy of my salvation
[44:17] your salvation supposed to come with joy
[44:21] you can be saved and you're sad and
[44:24] depressed there's
[44:24] there's joy that's supposed to be
[44:26] complimentary with your salvation
[44:29] so when david found himself in a deep
[44:31] hole he said lord
[44:33] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[44:36] and renew renew a right spirit because i
[44:39] had it before but lord i lost it but
[44:41] this morning
[44:42] renew a right spirit
[44:46] a right spirit to your word a right
[44:50] spirit
[44:51] to church a right spirit about prayer
[44:54] right spirit
[44:55] to the neighbor a right spirit to the
[44:57] co-worker right spirit to my husband a
[45:00] right spirit
[45:01] to my wife renew renew a right spirit
[45:03] [Music]
[45:06] friends this gospel is something that
[45:08] has to be lived somebody must feel the
[45:11] effects
[45:12] of this gospel you must leave this
[45:15] service and your wife must say you are
[45:17] different towards me your husband
[45:19] must say you are different towards me
[45:21] your co-workers must realize that
[45:23] there's a difference
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:28] because you are coming towards the right
[45:30] spirit
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:36] christ
[45:39] [Music]
[45:41] something begins to stir in your life
[45:43] and we're going to get to the quote
[45:45] i'll read it maybe later on but i'll say
[45:47] it now but the branham said the
[45:48] disciples were
[45:49] totally delivered because
[45:53] and listen carefully they were
[45:55] completely
[45:56] filled with the holy ghost
[46:05] no that's a powerhouse
[46:10] so their lives were a certain way
[46:12] because they were
[46:14] filled with the holy ghost
[46:18] amber branham said if you claim to have
[46:20] the holy spirit
[46:22] or you claim to have the holy ghost and
[46:24] your life is then lining up with that he
[46:25] said yes you have a ghost
[46:28] yes you have a spirit but it's not the
[46:30] holy ghost
[46:31] it's not the holy spirit because the
[46:33] holy ghost can behave itself in one
[46:35] person
[46:35] and misbehaving somebody else or holy
[46:38] ghost has a certain conduct
[46:40] holy ghost a certain behavior the holy
[46:42] ghost could only agree with the word the
[46:44] holy ghost could only love and forgive
[46:46] and
[46:46] drop oughts that's that such a
[46:48] achievement of the holy ghost
[46:49] somebody's saying man
[46:51] [Applause]
[46:53] and that is why the devil fights this
[46:55] holy ghost
[46:57] so much because it's all right to come
[46:59] to church but
[47:00] don't let them get the holy ghost
[47:03] because the moment you get the holy
[47:05] ghost
[47:05] but the man said it gives you power
[47:08] power to pray
[47:11] that's not you saying our father that's
[47:13] not you saying a simba that's power to
[47:15] intercede power to
[47:16] enter in power to enter into somebody
[47:18] else's suffering to give you power
[47:20] to live a holy life oh is there anybody
[47:23] in the house wants to live a holy life
[47:25] well then your cry your prayer your
[47:27] desire should be lord i want the holy
[47:29] ghost
[47:30] i want to be completely delivered can
[47:32] the church say man
[47:38] i pray this morning that in some way you
[47:40] would get jolted back to reality
[47:44] friends it is a struggle i was sharing
[47:45] with my wife and i believe i shared it
[47:47] on
[47:47] thursday night in the canopy service i
[47:49] said that
[47:50] the hardest thing is to keep the dove
[47:54] the hardest thing is to keep focused the
[47:56] hardest thing is to keep this as the
[47:58] priority
[47:59] because the devil is so good at the
[48:01] distractions you have to work and you
[48:02] have to do this and you have to do this
[48:04] and you find yourself going around
[48:06] in circles and at the end of the day
[48:09] you have nothing to show for it
[48:13] because the house can't take you there
[48:16] the car can't take you there the family
[48:18] can't even take you there your academic
[48:22] qualifications cannot take you there
[48:24] your status in the world cannot take you
[48:26] there being a deacon elder minister
[48:28] or pastor is not taking you there only
[48:32] perfect love can take you there
[48:35] only the holy ghost itself can take you
[48:37] there
[48:38] only the life of christ itself can take
[48:40] you there only the token itself
[48:42] could take you there and that's what we
[48:44] are doing striving
[48:46] to enter him before the terrible plague
[48:50] strike
[48:52] oh hallelujah
[48:55] come a message a total deliverance for
[48:57] the balaam said that's the way moses and
[48:59] his group did
[49:00] they got over there and got under the
[49:03] blood you notice
[49:04] until they got under the blood there was
[49:07] no total deliverance
[49:09] moses himself he was unified with god
[49:12] but israel wasn't
[49:14] there still was sin and they murdered
[49:16] against moses
[49:17] and they said why do you care about this
[49:18] you bring more trouble upon us
[49:20] because pharaoh said to tally to double
[49:22] the bricks and so forth
[49:24] but that was moses he was completely in
[49:26] the hands of god
[49:27] totally delivered from sheepherding to
[49:30] heard god sheep
[49:31] he was totally delivered himself but the
[49:34] people wasn't delivered
[49:35] because they were still murmuring among
[49:37] them
[49:39] but then brother brother went to he said
[49:41] but that one night when god ordained
[49:42] that the lamb should be killed
[49:44] a type of christ and the blood was
[49:47] dipped in hyssop
[49:48] which is like weeds come and humble and
[49:50] put over the lintel of the door and on
[49:51] the post
[49:52] and that's when israel become completely
[49:55] delivered
[49:56] not a hoof left behind all that belonged
[49:59] to them was delivered
[50:01] their families their loved ones and
[50:03] everything was delivered
[50:04] when they completely come under the
[50:07] blood
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:10] but the brandon said that's when the
[50:12] church shall be completely delivered
[50:14] when everything comes under the blood
[50:17] when your sins come under the blood when
[50:19] you're smoking when you're gambling when
[50:21] you're cheating when you're stealing
[50:22] when you're lying when everything is
[50:24] brought under the blood
[50:26] then there'll be a total deliverance if
[50:28] you have wronged
[50:29] somebody make it right you can't bring
[50:32] that under the blood it won't stay you
[50:34] can't bring it
[50:35] something won't let you do it when
[50:37] yourself is completely
[50:38] totally brought under the blood there'll
[50:41] be a total deliverance
[50:43] then you'll have a freedom like you have
[50:44] never known before
[50:46] when everything's brought under the
[50:48] blood brought
[50:49] in submissive to the kingdom of god then
[50:52] there'll be a real deliverance
[50:54] can the church say man with abraham said
[50:58] all jesus works was complete
[51:01] jesus was never halfway never did
[51:03] anything halfway amen
[51:08] i love it when the man with the palsy
[51:10] was brought by his friends and they
[51:12] couldn't get him into jesus because the
[51:13] place was crowded
[51:15] and he they dropping through the ceiling
[51:17] the first thing jesus did your sins are
[51:20] forgiven
[51:23] it's after the movement and the
[51:25] pharisees see who is this man to forgive
[51:26] said he said pick up the bed and walk
[51:29] and god was saying here's what i'm here
[51:30] to give total deliverance
[51:34] deliverance from your sickness
[51:35] deliverance from your mind deliverance
[51:37] from
[51:37] sin amen and it's a powerful statement
[51:41] because jesus was telling people go
[51:43] and sin no more and he hadn't even died
[51:45] yet
[51:48] and he was speaking of listen a lot of
[51:49] people don't understand that you can
[51:51] live without sin you know
[51:52] amen amen
[51:56] that when christ himself is feeling you
[51:58] and you only speak in his words and you
[52:00] only live in his walk and you only talk
[52:01] in his store and you are now perfect
[52:04] watson watson
[52:07] completely redeemed total redemption
[52:11] the weight of saying no has no more
[52:13] effect on your life
[52:14] the devil can't reach you because you
[52:16] are different viewer just like your
[52:17] father
[52:18] can the church say amen so all jesus's
[52:21] work was complete
[52:22] everything was complete total
[52:23] deliverance he totally delivered the
[52:25] leper from leprosy
[52:27] hallelujah he totally delivered the
[52:29] woman with the blood issue from her
[52:31] issue he totally delivered the world
[52:33] from sin when he died
[52:34] at the day of the atonement he totally
[52:37] delivered every sin
[52:38] he delivered the church so there's no
[52:40] need for us to live
[52:41] on the privileged people there's no need
[52:43] for us to live in a defeated state
[52:46] because he defeated the devil and took
[52:48] all the principalities and powers
[52:50] and subdued them under his feet and they
[52:53] have no
[52:54] legal right to rule you they are only
[52:56] squatting they have no legal rights to
[52:58] be there but the balance said we
[53:00] are christians filled with the holy
[53:02] ghost we don't have the devil dictate to
[53:04] us
[53:07] let me say that one more time we don't
[53:09] have the devil dictate to us
[53:11] christ delivered us some total
[53:13] deliverance delivered us from evil
[53:15] delivered us from sin delivered us from
[53:18] habits and delivered us from talking
[53:20] he delivered us from all kinds of smarty
[53:22] things up
[53:23] he totally delivered us up and put us
[53:25] into his holy hands
[53:26] of complete total deliverance
[53:31] can the church say hands and is where
[53:34] brother branham said
[53:35] the disciples had total deliverance
[53:37] absolutely total deliverance why
[53:39] because they were completely and totally
[53:41] filled up
[53:42] with the holy ghost and when you chest a
[53:44] church member
[53:46] and shook the pastor's hand or had some
[53:48] kind of a little experience of jumping
[53:50] or shouting or speaking in tongues or
[53:52] something another and still have malice
[53:54] in your heart strange acts
[53:57] telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting
[54:00] after woman there's something hasn't
[54:01] happened yet
[54:02] there's something wrong can the church
[54:05] say man
[54:06] but this morning we want to make it all
[54:08] right this morning
[54:09] by seeing the holy ghost bring a total
[54:12] deliverance
[54:12] that there will be evidence that you
[54:14] have met the pillar of fire
[54:16] somebody say amen so we are not just
[54:19] talking this morning
[54:20] about the god of yesterday it's easy to
[54:22] talk about what god did
[54:24] but this morning i want to talk about
[54:26] what god is doing right now
[54:27] because right now it's present tense
[54:29] redemption you are being redeemed by the
[54:31] word of
[54:32] you are being redeemed by blood but
[54:34] there's coming power
[54:35] redemption by power to push you into
[54:38] your inheritance
[54:39] can the church see man
[54:42] oh hallelujah oh glory to god
[54:46] you didn't find this message you didn't
[54:48] find this place
[54:50] but this message found you because you
[54:52] were predestinated
[54:54] with such a time as this and god will
[54:56] never give you more than you compare
[54:58] he told peter satan has desire to sift
[55:01] you like wheat
[55:02] but i prayed for you i pray that your
[55:05] faith don't fail
[55:06] when you feel the breath don't fail when
[55:08] you feel like giving up don't fail
[55:11] because i've prayed for you that says
[55:13] the devil trying to sift you
[55:14] but keep focused focus on what on the
[55:17] holy ghost
[55:18] keep focus on what on the promised land
[55:20] keep focused on what on the inheritance
[55:23] can the church say man this morning we
[55:26] are talking about a jubilee
[55:27] that's what the total deliverance is up
[55:29] it's a jubilee time again
[55:31] it's another time of life it's the devil
[55:34] have to let you go
[55:35] and he can't put you back no more
[55:37] somebody say man
[55:40] [Applause]
[55:43] [Music]
[55:43] [Applause]
[55:46] oh glory to god you may be seated
[55:57] i hear everything you say but you don't
[56:00] know how much licks i'm under
[56:02] you don't know how much whip the
[56:04] taskmaster hit me last week
[56:06] you have no idea how much the pressure
[56:09] has intensified
[56:11] you don't have any clue of how much
[56:14] problems and situations i have to deal
[56:16] with well i've got news for you this
[56:18] morning
[56:19] and i share this last week as well i
[56:21] said listen when the time for the
[56:23] declaration of emancipation was coming
[56:26] the slave owners knew that there was a
[56:28] cow long on
[56:29] so naturally as the time is cutting down
[56:32] they would intensify what they were
[56:33] doing to the slaves they would beaten
[56:35] them more because they didn't want to
[56:36] see them go
[56:37] but i want to encourage you the more
[56:39] intense it gets it means you're getting
[56:41] closer to being free
[56:42] because the devil he doesn't want to
[56:43] lose you he never let you just walk away
[56:46] so if it's getting hot in your life you
[56:48] better be confident that your
[56:50] breakthrough is right there
[56:51] the more the trials get hot and the city
[56:54] wasn't getting hot
[56:55] it's your breakthrough is right there
[56:57] because satan knows he's on a countdown
[56:59] he knows
[56:59] his time is up time is already no more
[57:02] we are breaking into eternity satan you
[57:05] could do your last punch
[57:06] but this is it in three days i'm out of
[57:09] here
[57:10] two more days you can beat me how much
[57:11] you want but it's a countdown
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:16] somebody say man oh
[57:19] glory glory glory glory glory so you are
[57:22] going to go
[57:22] free you want to be free from sin free
[57:25] from
[57:26] your doubt free from your past free from
[57:28] condemnation
[57:30] free from the stuff that you want to
[57:31] give up and you can't give up
[57:33] yes you're going to be free from that
[57:34] too but abraham said i believe that the
[57:37] church
[57:37] of the living god is moving into a
[57:39] sphere now that's going to shake the
[57:41] whole world
[57:42] that's the first time it's happened
[57:44] since the days of jesus he's talking
[57:46] about this group right here
[57:47] right now the devil thinks he has you
[57:49] but satan just keep watching
[57:51] just keep watching the story because god
[57:54] already knows the ending
[57:55] listen that should be the greatest
[57:57] encouragement to you
[57:58] satan doesn't know the end of your story
[58:02] but god knows the end of your story
[58:04] because he's the author
[58:06] and he's the finisher and he's the one
[58:08] writing the story
[58:09] you might think the middle of the story
[58:11] is a rough patch but there's going to be
[58:13] an ending
[58:14] and god is in control of the ending
[58:16] somebody's saying man
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:21] oh glory glory glory glory glory
[58:24] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[58:28] so what what are we contending for
[58:31] the holy spirit today the manifestation
[58:34] of the holy spirit
[58:36] is that angel trying to get the people
[58:38] back to the world
[58:39] because the holy spirit will only
[58:41] vindicate
[58:42] the word so we are trying to make sure
[58:45] that the world is preached
[58:46] with such power and such effectiveness
[58:49] that you can leave this place and you go
[58:51] into your prayer closet
[58:52] and you begin to plead the promises for
[58:55] you and for your house some
[58:56] something has to happen when you leave
[58:58] service you have a responsibility
[59:01] every single day but ibrahim said as
[59:03] long as god's got a people
[59:05] god's got a church god's got the holy
[59:07] ghost marching with it
[59:09] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[59:11] intellectuals will rise
[59:13] but god's got a minority somewhere god's
[59:16] got a little church listen
[59:18] that will move right on with the baptism
[59:20] of the holy ghost
[59:21] to claim in the light that's why i said
[59:23] we will settle for nothing less
[59:25] than the baptism of the holy ghost i
[59:28] don't want nothing less
[59:29] than the baptism of the holy ghost if i
[59:31] gotta hold on
[59:32] i'll be home to the altar every day i'm
[59:35] not compromising
[59:36] without receiving the holy ghost
[59:37] somebody's saying man
[59:57] the egyptians you see today he will see
[1:00:00] them
[1:00:02] no more the task masters really did a
[1:00:06] number
[1:00:07] on the children of israel because as
[1:00:10] they were running out of egypt
[1:00:12] and they thought they were free pharaoh
[1:00:14] said you know what i'm not going to let
[1:00:15] them go that easily
[1:00:18] and he'll lose the chariots after them
[1:00:23] the children of israel were not soldiers
[1:00:25] they were not fighters
[1:00:27] and as they felt cornered by the shame
[1:00:29] with the red sea in front and mountain
[1:00:31] on both sides
[1:00:32] some were wondering why did we come out
[1:00:34] here
[1:00:36] why are things so hot in my life why am
[1:00:38] i facing so much trial
[1:00:40] maybe we should just go back and tell
[1:00:42] them we're coming back in peace
[1:00:45] hallelujah and even moses got caught up
[1:00:49] in the euphoria of the moment on
[1:00:50] saturday cry he said oh gosh oh gosh
[1:00:54] and god say why cry just speak
[1:00:58] and move forward don't cry this morning
[1:01:01] just speak
[1:01:03] to your situation and move forward god
[1:01:05] already brought you out
[1:01:07] of that situation god brought you out of
[1:01:09] the nomination god brought you out of
[1:01:11] the world
[1:01:11] god brought you into this holy ghost
[1:01:13] message land and
[1:01:15] and just keep speaking and moving
[1:01:16] forward
[1:01:18] and moses stretched out his hands and
[1:01:21] the reds he opened up and
[1:01:22] he uttered a prophecy i don't even know
[1:01:24] if he if the people really understood
[1:01:26] what he was saying but he said the
[1:01:28] egyptians you see today you will see
[1:01:30] them no more
[1:01:31] forever and the children of israel did
[1:01:33] what they had never witnessed before
[1:01:35] they began to walk
[1:01:36] through the red sea you can imagine the
[1:01:38] jubilee
[1:01:39] the shouting because this was it now
[1:01:41] this was god in display
[1:01:43] but the brand i'm calling redemption by
[1:01:44] power it was redemption by blood with
[1:01:47] the token
[1:01:47] and the death angel but it was
[1:01:48] redemption by power this was god's power
[1:01:51] to take them
[1:01:52] through the journey brother what a
[1:01:53] jubilee what a shout and know that
[1:01:55] listen
[1:01:56] the enemy is behind me but god has made
[1:01:58] it away from me
[1:01:59] and nothing could stop me when it looked
[1:02:02] like i couldn't keep on moving
[1:02:03] god moved this society push this society
[1:02:06] push this
[1:02:07] aside he pushed this assad because i'm
[1:02:09] on my way to the promised land
[1:02:13] but listen while the oppression while
[1:02:15] they are pushing
[1:02:16] pharaoh says don't let them get away
[1:02:18] don't let them get away and he begins to
[1:02:20] run after them
[1:02:23] but i got news for you this morning
[1:02:25] whatever demon is still running after
[1:02:27] you
[1:02:27] we serve them notice this morning
[1:02:30] they've got
[1:02:30] to call they've got to go they've got to
[1:02:33] go
[1:02:33] [Applause]
[1:02:43] hallelujah and god destroyed them that
[1:02:46] day
[1:02:47] and brought a mighty victory to the
[1:02:49] children of israel
[1:02:52] mighty victory deliverance from the grip
[1:02:56] of satan deliverance from egypt
[1:03:00] so friends i encourage you this morning
[1:03:02] no matter what the challenge is the
[1:03:04] trial is the situation is your life keep
[1:03:07] fighting
[1:03:08] keep pressing keep the promise real in
[1:03:11] your heart
[1:03:12] but ibrahim said in the message shalom
[1:03:14] they always here either if i've
[1:03:16] if i could have been back there before
[1:03:19] the days that the world was created
[1:03:21] and looked down and seen the whole thing
[1:03:23] and the father had said to me what day
[1:03:25] would you want to live in
[1:03:26] i'd say no right now this is the hour
[1:03:29] this is the greatest hour that the
[1:03:31] church has ever moved into
[1:03:32] just before the coming of the bridegroom
[1:03:35] oh the real church of the living god
[1:03:37] ought to be on fire
[1:03:38] burning with the light of the gospel
[1:03:40] being vindicated
[1:03:42] among them that's how we are supposed to
[1:03:44] be every single day
[1:03:45] on fire every single day pray it up
[1:03:48] every single day
[1:03:49] reading every single day on the
[1:03:51] expectation because we are counting down
[1:03:53] to our jubilee we are counting down to
[1:03:56] leaving this place
[1:03:57] we are counting down to no more sin to
[1:03:59] no more sickness
[1:04:00] to no more depression to no more no more
[1:04:03] no more
[1:04:04] can the church say amen
[1:04:09] god's desire is to have a bride that
[1:04:13] would walk like him
[1:04:14] act like him live like him and most
[1:04:17] importantly speak
[1:04:19] like him can the church say amen
[1:04:24] now notice
[1:04:31] brother branham said in the message
[1:04:32] redemption in completeness and joy he
[1:04:34] said we are
[1:04:35] taking israel now in their journey
[1:04:37] coming out of egypt
[1:04:39] and brother branham said putin every
[1:04:41] week i sat down and read through the
[1:04:43] book of exodus
[1:04:44] if i can oh as much of it as i can
[1:04:48] i love it because it's a perfect type of
[1:04:50] the church today the condition
[1:04:52] and how god is moving what he did in a
[1:04:55] natural then he's doing in the spiritual
[1:04:57] now
[1:04:59] now we are moved now that now there he
[1:05:01] led israel natural when the scene looked
[1:05:03] moved
[1:05:04] out of a certain land into another
[1:05:06] natural land but now we are moved by the
[1:05:08] holy spirit
[1:05:09] into the promised land and we are on the
[1:05:12] road
[1:05:13] to the promised land can the church say
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] but ibrahim in the same message
[1:05:18] redemption and completeness and joy he
[1:05:20] said then what's the next thing for the
[1:05:21] believer the next thing is the baptism
[1:05:24] of the holy spirit then
[1:05:26] amen and we want to keep focus on that
[1:05:30] it's the baptism
[1:05:31] of the holy ghost then
[1:05:34] now notice this is by the branham
[1:05:38] he said i wanted this to sing deep here
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:45] i'm going to let this sink deep down i
[1:05:46] hope it goes way down moses the greatest
[1:05:49] prophet
[1:05:50] ever lived oh just let me pull back a
[1:05:52] little bit every believer when you come
[1:05:53] in and you are saved accept the blood of
[1:05:55] jesus
[1:05:56] you still try to hang on to this and
[1:05:58] hang on to that
[1:05:59] and you can give up and you can give
[1:06:01] that up and this
[1:06:02] up and while god may do good things for
[1:06:05] you you just can't give up certain
[1:06:06] things
[1:06:07] but what you need to do is pass through
[1:06:09] the red sea and when they come out on
[1:06:11] the other side hear this i want you to
[1:06:13] see it as they come out on the other
[1:06:15] side
[1:06:15] crawl up on the bank and look back and
[1:06:17] seeing all those task masters
[1:06:19] who had beaten them killed some of them
[1:06:22] and when they looked back and saw all
[1:06:23] those things struggling helpless and
[1:06:25] dying and i said brother
[1:06:26] you talk about the meeting they had
[1:06:29] could you imagine a day when you are
[1:06:30] completely free from everything you've
[1:06:32] been struggling with
[1:06:33] fighting with but everybody said you
[1:06:34] gotta pass through your red sea
[1:06:36] and look back and see listen they're all
[1:06:38] dead they're all finished what a joy to
[1:06:41] look back
[1:06:41] and say for all these years i've had to
[1:06:44] deal with this situation i had to deal
[1:06:46] with this back pain i've had to deal
[1:06:48] with this problem
[1:06:49] i've had struggles with this but now you
[1:06:50] can look back and say listen
[1:06:52] it's not just a world only but they are
[1:06:54] actually dead they are finished no more
[1:06:56] holding me no more
[1:06:58] can the church say amen
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:02] oh hallelujah
[1:07:06] moses but ibrahim said oh i'm going to
[1:07:08] let this sing deep i hope it goes way
[1:07:11] down moses greatest prophet ever lived
[1:07:13] outside of jesus christ never was a man
[1:07:15] that god ever spoke to like he did moses
[1:07:18] outside of christ he said if there'd be
[1:07:20] one who is spiritual or prophet among
[1:07:22] you i'll show him visions
[1:07:23] and make myself known to him but not my
[1:07:25] servant moses i speak lip to ear with
[1:07:27] him
[1:07:28] moses this dignified man as soon as he
[1:07:30] come
[1:07:31] through that experience he's seen all
[1:07:33] those masters dead
[1:07:35] he knowed all them things was gone
[1:07:37] forever then
[1:07:39] oh my all those things that had drove
[1:07:41] them and
[1:07:42] beat them and whipped them around was
[1:07:44] finished he
[1:07:45] raised his hands and sang in the spirit
[1:07:47] oh my
[1:07:48] never been typed won't be until we get
[1:07:50] to glory of yonder
[1:07:52] when the completion was made there he
[1:07:54] sang in the spirit but the brother said
[1:07:56] that was a type of the holy spirit
[1:07:58] coming at pentecost
[1:07:59] when we passed through the sea it was a
[1:08:01] type of pentecost hallelujah are not
[1:08:03] when
[1:08:04] that body is perfect redeemed without
[1:08:06] our soul is perfectly redeemed cannot
[1:08:08] perish
[1:08:09] god everlasting life oh but the man said
[1:08:12] oh i feel good notice why
[1:08:13] because i know it's just saith the lord
[1:08:16] just anchor my soul there and walk and i
[1:08:18] say satan
[1:08:19] jesus all you want to to me but don't
[1:08:22] bother me because i know
[1:08:23] whom i have believed i'm persuaded he's
[1:08:26] able to keep
[1:08:26] that which i've committed to him against
[1:08:28] this day can the church say amen
[1:08:34] said notice then when our bodies are
[1:08:36] redeemed which we got divine healing now
[1:08:38] was a shadow
[1:08:39] in other words but the bible said divine
[1:08:41] healing is just a shadow
[1:08:44] of being redeemed because his body is
[1:08:45] going to be changed
[1:08:47] that was just a shadow of pentecost can
[1:08:49] the church say amen
[1:08:51] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:08:52] you amen
[1:08:56] said coming out of the fiery furnace was
[1:09:00] a shadow of what was to come
[1:09:02] away from the lion and alliance then was
[1:09:04] a shadow of what was to come
[1:09:06] everything was a shadow by the shadow of
[1:09:08] pentecost but now
[1:09:10] we have perfect redemption through the
[1:09:12] blood of christ
[1:09:13] he said they in those days couldn't have
[1:09:15] perfect redemption
[1:09:16] because it was under the blood of bulls
[1:09:18] and goats it will not take away the sin
[1:09:20] it only covered the sin
[1:09:22] but when jesus blood was shed the most
[1:09:24] holy righteous blood
[1:09:25] sin wasn't covered no more they were
[1:09:27] divorced and done with
[1:09:28] and the believer goes in the presence of
[1:09:30] his makeup can the church say amen
[1:09:35] and but the brethren said now he said if
[1:09:37] they acted that way
[1:09:39] in the shadow of moses singing in the
[1:09:41] spirit
[1:09:42] when he saw the egyptians dead then what
[1:09:45] about us
[1:09:46] talk about the holy ghost meeting when
[1:09:48] they got over that bank over there he
[1:09:50] talked about miriam beating a tambourine
[1:09:52] and they were just talking about
[1:09:54] deliverance from the natural task
[1:09:55] masters
[1:09:56] what kind of singing we will have with
[1:09:58] the terence when we make it on the other
[1:10:00] side
[1:10:00] when we are delivered from this body and
[1:10:02] delivered from this mind
[1:10:04] can the church say man
[1:10:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:12] so what are we talking about we're
[1:10:14] seeing a total deliverance
[1:10:16] is complete redemption that's what we're
[1:10:18] talking about not just you delivered
[1:10:20] from smoking and drinking
[1:10:21] that's the baby stuff we're talking
[1:10:23] about deliverance to one day you just
[1:10:25] walk and you're not found no more
[1:10:27] just like enoch we're talking about
[1:10:28] complete deliverance that you are no
[1:10:30] more just 16 elements
[1:10:32] but there's another element called the
[1:10:34] holy ghost supercharging these 16
[1:10:36] elements
[1:10:37] we are talking about a new walk a new
[1:10:39] talk a new way
[1:10:41] a new life can the church say
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:51] the substance our bodies are groaning
[1:10:53] and we have an inheritance
[1:10:55] and we are children now heirs of the
[1:10:57] kingdom kings and priests unto god
[1:11:00] offering spiritual sacrifices what's a
[1:11:03] spiritual sacrifice it's a sacrifice
[1:11:05] when you don't feel like doing it
[1:11:07] that's what makes it a sacrifice when it
[1:11:09] costs you something
[1:11:10] that's what makes it a sacrifice and
[1:11:12] coming to church is supposed to be a
[1:11:14] sacrifice
[1:11:15] because it against your natural nature
[1:11:17] but when you get a new nature
[1:11:18] you can't help but come to church you
[1:11:20] can't help but rejoice with the word
[1:11:22] you can't help but be in fellowship what
[1:11:25] does a priest
[1:11:26] do he makes a sacrifice that's what
[1:11:28] these sons and daughters do which are
[1:11:30] kings and priests
[1:11:31] they are making sacrifices offering to
[1:11:34] god spiritual sacrifices
[1:11:36] you say brother branham i just don't
[1:11:38] feel like praising him
[1:11:39] that's the time to make the sacrifice
[1:11:42] praise him anyhow
[1:11:44] kings and priests sons and daughters
[1:11:46] offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:11:48] i just don't feel i praise him praise
[1:11:51] them anyhow
[1:11:52] i don't feel like shouting shout anyhow
[1:11:54] i don't feel like praying
[1:11:56] pray anyhow i don't feel like dancing
[1:11:58] dance anyhow
[1:12:00] that's how you confuse the enemy when he
[1:12:02] expects you to be depressed
[1:12:04] you wish you praise god anyhow you shout
[1:12:07] anyhow
[1:12:09] you are under fire but there's something
[1:12:11] on the inside
[1:12:14] keeps you moving whatever you do don't
[1:12:16] stop moving
[1:12:17] whatever you do don't stop moving
[1:12:23] can you maybe see that but the battle
[1:12:26] goes on while we are groaning
[1:12:29] for the kangaroo veil in this tabernacle
[1:12:31] of humiliation
[1:12:33] this tabernacle that has failed we have
[1:12:35] the earnest
[1:12:37] of our perfect complete redemption back
[1:12:40] like we was in the beginning when god
[1:12:42] created adam in the garden of eden
[1:12:44] in other words god is longing for us to
[1:12:46] be completely delivered
[1:12:48] to put us in the position we should have
[1:12:50] been if adam hadn't fallen
[1:12:52] god is looking for the day when sons in
[1:12:55] this day
[1:12:56] could be just like adam we already saw
[1:12:58] but the brandon was a type
[1:13:00] doing things that adam would have done
[1:13:02] but one of these days we're gonna have
[1:13:03] some more
[1:13:04] sons we'll be just like adam we're gonna
[1:13:06] have some more sons
[1:13:08] that will be completely delivered who
[1:13:10] will beat back into their position
[1:13:17] he may be seated so malachi 4 left
[1:13:21] us a shout message with the promise of
[1:13:24] dynamics
[1:13:25] to our mechanics which is present tense
[1:13:28] redemption with power
[1:13:30] can the church say amen he gave us a
[1:13:33] shout and the shout was the fullness of
[1:13:35] the atonement
[1:13:36] in the church ages they had the
[1:13:38] atonement but malachi 4 brought the
[1:13:40] fullness
[1:13:40] of the atonement which is the blood
[1:13:43] which
[1:13:44] loses the holy spirit which was bound
[1:13:46] for two thousand years
[1:13:47] and then give us a promise of dynamics
[1:13:49] to our mechanics
[1:13:51] so now we are stepping forth boldly
[1:13:53] that's why we could preach the promises
[1:13:55] because we are looking for the spirit
[1:13:57] that will be on the pride to come down
[1:13:59] here as dynamics to the mechanics as the
[1:14:02] holy ghost itself
[1:14:03] to give you a chance to anoint the word
[1:14:06] seas that have been in your soul for
[1:14:08] all these years you've been coming and
[1:14:10] hearing the word
[1:14:11] there's more to it than just hearing the
[1:14:13] word there's coming a day that the rain
[1:14:15] the holy spirit
[1:14:16] will bring the world to life and then
[1:14:18] all
[1:14:19] all that you couldn't do you'll be able
[1:14:21] to do and even greater than these
[1:14:23] because that's a promise created and
[1:14:25] these shall you do
[1:14:27] that's your promise of dynamics to the
[1:14:29] mechanics that's the total deliverance
[1:14:31] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:36] you may be seated what are you saying
[1:14:38] brother isaac
[1:14:39] i'm not saying you just want to be
[1:14:41] delivered and get healed
[1:14:42] no we're talking about being
[1:14:44] positionally placed
[1:14:46] we don't have being adopted we're
[1:14:47] talking about being a condition and when
[1:14:49] the time for the rapture comes you're
[1:14:50] ready to go
[1:14:52] brother said divine healing is a shadow
[1:14:55] that's that's that that's a that's a
[1:14:56] simple thing but the venom said if you
[1:14:58] can't even have faith for divine healing
[1:14:59] or you're going to have faith for the
[1:15:00] rapture
[1:15:01] but we want to make it to the rapture
[1:15:03] that's our promise
[1:15:04] rapture is my promise change our body is
[1:15:07] my promise
[1:15:08] my family is my promise on the way to
[1:15:11] there
[1:15:11] i'm going to be healed i'm going to be
[1:15:13] delivered my son is going to be restored
[1:15:15] my wife is going to be that's on the
[1:15:19] journey but i have a destination
[1:15:21] and no devil is going to stop that
[1:15:22] destination no team is going to stop
[1:15:25] that destination
[1:15:26] no friend no boy no girl nothing will
[1:15:29] stop that destination
[1:15:37] [Applause]
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:45] one day there will come a blast from
[1:15:47] heaven and the dead in christ shall
[1:15:49] rifles
[1:15:50] them old testament scenes back yonder
[1:15:52] who are waiting
[1:15:53] will blast forth and come up to their
[1:15:55] fullest and go into the resurrection
[1:15:57] and we drop right in line going into the
[1:16:00] sky
[1:16:00] those old mortal bodies change and made
[1:16:03] like unto his own glorious body
[1:16:05] what a parade that will be when it
[1:16:07] starts heaven one some of these days in
[1:16:09] that
[1:16:09] rapture in time that lays ahead oh
[1:16:11] listen proudly displaying
[1:16:13] the blood of jesus christ upon their
[1:16:15] chest the message of god
[1:16:17] in the hour that they lived in that's
[1:16:19] all we're looking forward to
[1:16:21] so the blood of jesus christ on their
[1:16:23] chest is the message of god in the hour
[1:16:26] they lived in
[1:16:27] so we have to live our message we have
[1:16:29] to live it because this is the age we
[1:16:31] are living in
[1:16:31] and in this age we have to live every
[1:16:34] age gone past
[1:16:35] because of the final age this is the
[1:16:37] final voice this is the final people
[1:16:39] and everything that worked in every age
[1:16:41] now gathered in this age of
[1:16:43] what was in paul's age in martin luther
[1:16:45] colombia everybody
[1:16:46] is now in this age and now we will told
[1:16:49] you
[1:16:50] we were proudly we are sons of the
[1:16:52] living god
[1:16:53] we are daughters of the living god we
[1:16:55] are gonna have faith
[1:16:56] we're gonna have virtue we're gonna have
[1:16:58] knowledge we're gonna have temperance
[1:17:00] we're gonna have
[1:17:01] patience we're gonna have calliness
[1:17:03] we're gonna have brotherly kindness
[1:17:04] we're gonna forgive we're gonna have a
[1:17:06] super church we're gonna have a clean
[1:17:08] church we're gonna have a church without
[1:17:11] spot without wrinkle washed by the blood
[1:17:13] of the lamb
[1:17:14] a real church a super church a delivered
[1:17:17] church
[1:17:18] a restored church can the church say
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:22] oh hallelujah oh i'm getting ready to
[1:17:25] close out in a short while
[1:17:27] god wanting to place his church in
[1:17:29] position
[1:17:30] in the masjid adoption god let me live
[1:17:32] to see it is my prayer
[1:17:34] so close till i could almost feel it but
[1:17:37] the pranama's looking for it
[1:17:38] to see the church come back into power
[1:17:41] all these years the church has been
[1:17:42] backslidden
[1:17:43] from that alpha church the church went
[1:17:45] on in the crowd
[1:17:46] and never had the same power that the
[1:17:48] alpha church had
[1:17:50] but god was restoring this fallen church
[1:17:53] this church that was buried this church
[1:17:55] that died up because god doesn't want to
[1:17:57] see anybody backslidden
[1:17:58] he doesn't want to see you down he
[1:18:00] doesn't want to see you defeated
[1:18:02] but also god knows that he can't deliver
[1:18:05] unless there's somebody to be delivered
[1:18:07] he can't restore
[1:18:09] unless there's somebody to be restored
[1:18:11] up and god knew all along
[1:18:13] he said that they are mountains and they
[1:18:15] are valleys and they are blue flowers
[1:18:17] and they are red flowers so god in the
[1:18:20] passage of your life
[1:18:21] allowed all kinds of things to happen to
[1:18:23] bring to the spot
[1:18:25] that he could get the glory for
[1:18:26] delivering you from the lion's den
[1:18:28] delivering you from the fiery furnace
[1:18:31] delivering you
[1:18:32] from goliath if the lord is with me i
[1:18:35] would be able to drive them out
[1:18:37] that's what caleb said and we will have
[1:18:39] the same testimony
[1:18:40] if it wasn't for the lord we wouldn't be
[1:18:43] here today
[1:18:43] if it wasn't for the lord we would not
[1:18:45] have made it
[1:18:46] he is the deliverer of he is the mighty
[1:18:49] conqueror
[1:18:50] he delivered daniel he delivers shadrach
[1:18:52] he delivered meshach
[1:18:54] he delivered up and nicole he delivered
[1:18:56] joseph he delivered samson
[1:18:58] he delivered elijah he delivered noah he
[1:19:01] delivered abraham
[1:19:02] he delivered isaac what about me he is
[1:19:05] still a deliverer
[1:19:06] he delivered
[1:19:10] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:19:14] hallelujah you may be seated that's why
[1:19:17] when the children of israel were locked
[1:19:19] up in egypt
[1:19:20] god was troubled he said i've heard
[1:19:23] their cries
[1:19:24] by reason of their task masters and i
[1:19:26] didn't send a representative
[1:19:28] i don't want to send anybody else but i
[1:19:31] have come down
[1:19:32] i want to be here for this one i'm not
[1:19:34] going to trust anybody else
[1:19:35] but i have come down to deliver them
[1:19:38] i have come down could you imagine
[1:19:40] almighty god
[1:19:42] he left heaven and sat on a mountaintop
[1:19:45] to say i have come down on the earth
[1:19:48] because my people
[1:19:49] the first time god used the word my
[1:19:52] people
[1:19:52] was in exodus three he said ma i've
[1:19:55] heard the cries of my people
[1:19:57] and i believe in 2015 there's a cry
[1:20:00] that's going out and god has heard the
[1:20:02] cries of his people
[1:20:04] and he has already descended he is
[1:20:06] already here
[1:20:07] a south message he already here
