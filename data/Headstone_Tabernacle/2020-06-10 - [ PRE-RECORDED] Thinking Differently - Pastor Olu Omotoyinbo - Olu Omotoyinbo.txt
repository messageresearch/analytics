but a preload on your bless your people this morning I pray you bless your word it's already blessed but I pray your bless the reading of it and as we endeavor to take a context that we love may you pledge it to the hearts of your people you know the needs there be in the midst Lord may you minister under each one of us accordance we have need may your Holy Spirit Lord speak to each one of us Lord so that one will live here at the end of this share which Lord and at the end of this convention we will cry out like those two on the road to emails did not our hearts burn within us while he

on to each one of us Lord as only you can Thank You Father and we'll be careful not just at the end of this service but all the days of our lives as long as you Linda's breath we'll be careful to be in our right minds to give back to you alone or the praise of the horn and all the glory for we actually with thanks given in Jesus Christ's name in my mind God should bless you Emma and if you have your Bibles matching attention to a few personal Scripture of proverbs 23 and verse 7 and also wanna read from Romans 12 verses 1 until proverbs 23 and verse 7 for as you think it in his heart that's man so is he a man in Romans 12 Romans 12 verse 1 and verse 2 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and perfect what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen I mean what are you supposed to renew his holy words bless you please be seated god bless you good morning I trust you are doing good and you are well is Bella Chelsea doors open I warned o'clock and brother always preaching so you gotta pray for me again all right like brother Dale I said it's the message of the hour so you gonna take at least one hour so brother whew you teach me how to do those short you know short quick and powerful stuff you know anyway god bless you and it's so good to be back in a new girl whoever the child's mr. Dyer the family the church is always make us feel so welcome and I know I can speak for I know I'm speaking for every one of you if I say that we felt more than at home it couldn't be better in our own homes if we were at home you know own different churches over this weekend so pastor charles Okeechobee thank you so much for having us here one more time is the dial wherever you're at thank you so much for all you do to make our stay here very comfortable it's not easy to plan a convention to get people together and attend to so many needs at the same time I want to say thank you it's not lost on all the efforts you have to put in and to the church and on the power of Christ assembly I know you want to say thank you also for all they hear in here is a small group but what you do is so much bigger than what even many big groups come together so wants you to know that we appreciate it we thank you for your kindness for your cooperation with the pasture and for the unit's you host Nigeria all these years passed for so many years now and we always consider a rich blessing over here until my mainstream brethren pastors ministers they were just introduced who are also here I want to say God bless you and it's been many of us have been isolated from way back and coming to these dimensions down through the years I have made quite a few more brothers precious brothers who we didn't get a chance to know before but since we got to know them fernanda they're really lovely brothers you know kindred spirit and we thank you for being here again this year and for my mentioned brethren who were spoken ahead of me who wanted to thank you for your reward for your messages for testimonies and I have two shrimp pick up the crumbs this morning and transforming into crumb cake so I trust that go help me I always do that because a minute not because I'm trying to talk nice and be humble I really wish that was true but really when you come up to this message here it's tough to you it's tough to find anything else left to say but anyway our trust that girl helped us again this morning anyway I I have a few conduct scriptures Isaiah 55 I think it's verse 7 maybe let me read that brother over the thing read that yesterday because I want to come our this subject of sowing and reaping from a little different angle alright let the wicked forsake his thoughts now let me read it from verse 6 the thing that's way brother theory from last night SiC year the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon I like the way the babble is you know researched things and is a is a rich guys and abundant God and he he has all the works and he and he means every single thing that he says he is an abundant God is a God of abundance so he will pardon he there is nothing there's no sin no wrong that he can't he doesn't have the pattern for his pattern is abundant oh my verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways here the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts that's really saying something I forgot to say that his thoughts and our thoughts on a totally different level so I got a little for this morning and a little excitation to admonish you to think different and I trust and pray and hope that by the time this convention is done and I know girls really tremendously a bit blessed us in a tremendous manner I wasn't here the first day so means for the Akers message but I suffered a challenge message online when we were coming and I think he was low here is it for you totally outstanding and then yesterday morning brother Isaac there's some that there preaches and there are approaches there are those of us who pretend to preach and they are those who real preach and brother Isaac is one of them ma and charlie is here to reap and they yesterday afternoon the test mission the brothers with an undisturbed so wonderful wonderful so good to meet you to know you but little was with you last year right and so so god bless you brother so glad to meet you and to know you and thank you for those words brother brother lon C and brother Emil thank you so much for your words also and last night they rely on the word thank about the fear for those lovely words last night so I who I in a convention after Trina who are in brother Wes estimation in West Palm Beach and brother Theo was there myself but array thumbs in for that chance we are a tremendous John Cena was totally of the chats but always Commission totally of the chats and then when West bumping the phone weakened and immobile Wescoe many of Ross member was performing way back in the past and he had this convention he was absolutely mind-bending stuff it was totally outstanding also and brother fuel myself brother Ray was talking and said we really thoroughly enjoyed the convention I know because we're not preaching so yes come for the service like you do and you go to the room you are relaxed and you come back and you come you get in the service when you have to preach and you see your notes being taken away from you word on top of world on top of world on top of world it's tough to enjoy the convention that way anyway proof for me I don't have much of a message but I so pretend like we're I hear any message okay I'm not trying to tell a lie so just pretend like you're having a you're in a message okay will you do that for me all right so the preachers are already preached all right and the preachers are coming after me to preach so both for those of us who try to make like we are preachers just pretend like you are hearing a message okay all right say preaching Jesus the Bible said when he met those two on the road to Emmaus and he was going he made like he was gonna go beyond because he's decent he won't say I'm gonna come to your house now have any meal for me he wanted them to invite him so just do like Jesus be just make like you are enjoying the message okay all right so my tattoo is a little unusual and I hope I will be able to like you know get my thoughts together macelli's thinking differently thinking differently and I blood chels had this inspiration just like we came from Trina and Bovie you know the the harvest and it was really totally tremendous and and but the child you know grows here with sowing and reaping that are so in tears shall reap in joy and it's a bit about sowing and reaping is more important to you than you possibly will ever realize but a choice and hope that through this course of these meetings from other channels I mean brother Akos message through the channels you are getting a bit of a glimpse of what it is all about showing and reaping because it's a is a principle of life that affects you more than you would ever think of it's affects you more than you catch you understand or care to like you know or you might know maybe not maybe you care but you might not realize the effect is so much like that so I just want to talk to you a little bit about that and how that you know all put together into you thinking differently thinking differently as a Christian as a believer as a minister whoever you are whatever your life's purpose because that's how you are going to come to perfection amen you can do this regular thing like everybody else is doing and then hope to be you know in the rapture it's not gonna walk that way the price a little different like what the challenge said super rich super brannis anyway super brother super sister so we're super we're a little bit above the regular shade amen you are not like everybody else you were different from them amen and I can't say that our are strong enough for young people because there's so much attack on the message these days that you really wonder and you see the cooling off especially among the younger folks not everybody just if you can if you there but Moses said we will not leave one hoof behind so even if it's one person is a concern to us but if you understand and know and believe the revelation of God in his word that you were different you and not like everybody else God has a special Pope was special place for you and bringing you in here if you're really honest and I believe that and shake yourself and pull yourself back then you might begin to understand like that is a privilege there hanno to be calling to this intimation of the hour amen because this message is not for everybody this makes for a special breed a special group of people and you are that special group of people Oh glory to God amen amen let me get my but a few is not seen me so let me get my loose sheets together here with you you're not looking okay this one is you know I mean I'm struck with this one here okay let me let me let me remove my jacket can I thank you it used to be years ago I would preach only one put on the jacket but I grew up and became more cultured so I put a jacket on and once again the poopit I remove it so my jackets last a long time okay no seriously sir so don't feel sorry for me or but always good I gotta get my jacket don't don't don't spare yourself the thought my jacket feels very very new so anyway sowing and reaping and I just talked to you is the principle of life like I said that means much as I could maybe you realize because we got seed and Jesus said the Word of God is a seed and seeds are sown and planted not the words sown and planted there's a sewing that they planted the two different things a little different a little different and what is soul you are going to reap amen so this principle yeah you wanna apply it in every single area of our lives more than we ever might understand or realize because this principle comes from before the formation of the wall comes from God's mind before the foundation of the wall and this principle is table is a standard is a principle that permits every single area of life this principle produce the creation this principle of sowing and reaping produce a perfect world a prophet earth that God created this principle of sowing and reaping produce a perfect garden of eden' with a perfect man there is son of God on the face of the earth standing there and I mature God on the face of the earth with spoken word power God's or Adam and reaped a perfect man because Adam was a seat of the world and God read a man a son of God that became the flesh of the world though what made flesh was sowing and reaping amen amen so this is a very powerful thought here America it comes from God's mine this principle produced a profit man on the face of the earth amen this Mapleton Adam from his seat of the world into the flesh of the world the world made flesh a perfect man stain on the face of the earth this critical here mere Adam this Supreme Being the supreme create the top of God's creation on the face of the earth and this same principle is here walking on you and I and you know Turner's Amen into the capstone bride of Jesus Christ the top of God's creation in the seven church age is sowing and reaping amen if we go in Eden but the Bronco actually called Genesis the seed chapter of the Bible every seed was planned in Genesis imminent that's what that's what I prefer him to show us to let us know that every seed was then Genesis because before if you want a manifesto of anything it's gotta be planted somewhere there's gonna be a sowing frost before there is a manifestation or a reaping amen glory to God amen glory to God amen amen so sowing and reaping is an eternal truth of God Amen that works in all of life it works within the church it works without the church unbelievers used the principle and it works for them Christians use the principle and it works for them the husband used the principle arranged is what he works for him wife uses he works for her the businessman used he works for him the students use he works for him is the principle of life because God put it there if a Christian from a source and it was nestlings he will reap a harvest if an atheist farmer source and observe the same principles he will reap the same Habash is that right can I get a witness back amen amen so this principle is not for believers alone though we are focusing on the believers because that's what we are by the grace of Almighty God but I'm just going to show you this principle is the principle that comes from God and God put this principle there to work for men and walk in man and walk through and is by this principle that you and I at the day the people are sowing and reaping amen now Jesus said the Soraa went is sow the seed I had by the rail read a quote one time differentiating sowing and planting your sewing is more like topsoil it doesn't go so deep but planting goes much deeper and that's what we are similar for planted and sowed the seed of the entire Bible so whether it's planted or sword it up to you you can change that and the Bible says nothing but the Oviedo somebody coulda died yesterday so break up your fallow ground so you have the seed is sword and ready break up your fallow ground for it's time to seek the Lord because as you do that then the city coasts and dip down and takes root in your soul and out of your belly shall flow the Tree of Life growing again Oh hallelujah glory to God amen so Prieta seamen are talking about the sewing together in my name and sowing and reaping amen amen produce a harvest in Eden and Adam was the fruit of the harvest and this same principle will produce in this end time here a bride a bride and that's why God had a caller after the Prophet initiative saw the word to go into the prophets message and amen and check off his words that he already sold and take the same words and and speak them back to you and what are those words those seeds with tears of revelation and inspiration think people over there was so much clearer last night as beautiful those beautiful bringing the seed the watering amen but the preacher the watching by the praises outstanding so much clarity on the world support Malachi 4 brought the world he brought the revelation and we come a ministry commenting on the prophet and with tears of revelation inspiration they have water the seats in your soul and you take the same word and pick up your final crown of your heart and let the word go down deep because if the series tops all you are not gonna last much longer you are not gonna last very long if the series topsoil thus it can be the best seed if you take a good seed and put on this ground here and put some soil here on this one here you have you have sowed the seed but for that seat to really become what it's supposed to be you need to a break up this ground and let that sit go down deep but God God the sower the preacher like through this conversion shows the world Malekith already solid so we just come back to recycle it back so the word and when you what comes to you in frozen different kinds of our hearts different kind of sorrow but you have to take the words the seed and say no this little beat-up soil you'll break up your fallow ground and drink of the word of the Spirit and the word goes down deep in your soul and begins to germinate because the ticke roots and you became like solid and no man can shake here no man can took up of that word because only certain your soul is planted in your soul so I say Malakoff already come and soul and planted the seed of the entire Bible and it's in your soul this morning can you say amen amen [Applause] you may be seated Susu in Ripon police in Eden a perfect man on the face of the earth Adam with preeminence sees on the face of the other working my subject realism living in preeminence easy amen so so in Ripon producing Adam a perfect man who was living in preeminence ease and this same principle Parisian the right at the enzyme here a perfect bride living in 3 eminences you're gonna find out what it means to live in preeminence is Amen before we finish I trust that God will help us Amen sowing and reaping you and I here today Justin leaving believe in God that we will be harvested like Adam was a perfect man on the face of the earth even because the seed has been playing our souls and we are respond to that seed and we are doing all we know to do to pick up a fallow ground so that sheep goes deep down and takes root in a source on our hats Oh hallelujah and like brother Isaac with charities get a reap and Charlie will reap all of God's Saints have been planted and sewed by Malecha for and you are one of those sister being plan and super melaka for so by this principle amen so in a reaping man in every area of life achieve the purpose that desire every purpose of man is as cheap by this principle in all of life's areas inside the church outside the church you're unbelievable friends everybody because man is wired by God to live by the principles of God whether they acknowledge God or not because the one the rules and reigns in the affairs of men he created man and this babble works this gospel works even when they don't acknowledge it issue what's in their lives Laura dough God amen oh brother amen amen so by this principle here amen sowing and reaping the Prophet Malachi 4 has come and a sword and planted the seed of the entire Bible in order that a perfect brow will come forth and by this same principle this bride is gonna be reaped have a said like Adam Wars by charity which is yet a reap now amen you know reap a perfect man stand on the face of the earth in the beauty of his audience don't ever let the message become a cliche to you just words that are spoken don't let it become a cliche to you and the way to do that is gonna break up your fallow ground your shallow ground break it up let the seat go down deep you can't afford to be a so-so believer you can't afford to be a wishy-washy Christian you cannot afford to be a fellow crime believer you cannot afford to be a shallow ground believer you gotta break up your fallow ground leather watch check roots if you are the only man in your school only get on your Street amen your roots are deep and your roots are deep and they go way back in to Elohim is mine and the devil can shake hear the devil can shake hear you believe that lorry so like I said soil ribbon is a simple principle of God and it comes from way before the finishing of the world is it third God and God have thoughts thoughts thoughts on his mind I seen a reaping he was one of his thoughts one of his principles amen and God's thoughts is there are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways as a field for the Richie or say my thoughts are not your thoughts in other words my thoughts on sowing and reaping and not the same as your thoughts on sowing and reaping and I put that you in a minute if some my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways because you have thoughts and then you have ways to make those thoughts come to pass amen and God said for as the heavens are high above the earth so are my thoughts and your thoughts and my ways higher than your ways I have thoughts I have ways of going about my things that are so much higher than your ways and your thoughts that if you take on this up here you will never understand what I'm about and that's why Jesus came those religious people were so earthbound they could never figure him out and that's why people cannot think of this message out because this message here is the manna God is the Son of God from the formation of the world in so much higher than anything this world has ever found a man you may be seated if you understand what you are received what this message represents and I hope God will help me to be able to show you I hope I don't keep it your one o'clock to where you will understand and know that the Christian life is easy say easy it's easier than living I don't believe in life he says hard life is hard you may be seated life is hard go as the baby in the womb waits protected everything it wants to eat it kicks his mother some more makes the mother feel hungry the mother eats food and the baby gets fed but once the time comes the baby comes of age that baby comes on the face of the earth here it's very first second on the earth you say welcome to the world baby is it to fall you are in so don't tell me Kristen is tough because going to school is tough going to work is tough going to the family families talk everything is tough life is tough but compared to all of that this cosplay is easy because god is your enabler combated easy for you to live a Christian life unless you don't want to is not hard on us it's easy can I use a man or a you may be seated it'll be so out of character for God to make living a Christian life force under knowledge difficult so out of character for God you say he will abundantly pardon he said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly so he's he had to give you a Ponton help you are the only one in your school is he here to give you a pond on hell what you cannot do for you sir the practical do for yourself he cannot do that for you because you can plant a seed and pick up the fallow ground in your natural and your natural one and put the seal in there but if the seed has to do some things of itself you pour water and over but thats it has to break out itself die and Jesus says in John 12:24 I believe accept the current without falling to the ground and dad it applies alone boy falls to the ground I I shall bring forth fruit and more fruit a much fruit that's your you get a break up your fallow pee on yourself and do the dying yourself I can't do the time for you you can do the time for me your pastor can do the time for you you can do the damn for yourself for anybody else you get a do the time for yourself that's a break up your fallow ground break up your spirit break up your own ways break up yourself styles break up your spirits upon you you may be seated or glory amen so like Adam where God's seed got seed of his word I like Adam we're gonna be reap as the flesh of the world the word made flesh and that's why I say Malaka for already sold and planted the seed of the entire Bible and we have the see we have the word on people GN like but an analyst yesterday how dare you speak against the message but if you want to go on ahead but the angels here in it not threatening you not wouldn't fail you but the angel is hearing it when Ottoman is so we're higher than the closest which is panic oh so much higher they are fine painting cross-reference fine they pretty water God you here wow this is incredible this is great but when it comes to it is top speed yo it's subsea it doesn't go way back before the finishing of the world only one man William Branham have their ministry revelation 1 if you say stop william branham you gotta find that man or you're gonna stay at pounds because Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him and which is sent by his angel unto his servant John you've got to find who that angel is if you say so Malachi 4 that's fine but you gotta friend that angel because that revelation is going to show you things that are to be things that were before the words were formed things that are the things that are to be no man no other man has done ministry to check you to the man of God and bring God's thoughts down to you and I so we are the privileged this morning we are the thoughts of God in the form of a message so far higher than anything this world can ever produce so far higher than anything regular Christianity can ever produce that you say [Music] [Applause] so let me show you that God's thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts so much higher than our ways because I'm got sword I'm planning his world he rip perfection he saw his word let there be light and there was light and he has never had to make this song any better since he did it one time it's been as perfect as puffy could be if man could touch the Sun they would have changed it but God made sure you can't touch the Sun you just bask under the glories of the Sun God spork let there be light and there was light and it's never had to work on it his sword I'll read right away a perfect Sun that's been there ever since and the Bible says I believe in in Sam something he said is said as for God his way is perfect so when go saw some plants he always comes forth on the other side are they have a sweet perfection is that clear do you believe that the source he plans it comes out with a prophet fruit mother harvest glory Oh glory but us nothing man does it's perfect the same principle sowing and reaping God applies the principle it comes out perfect world first day God created at the end of the day God saw everything he did was good in other words was perfect second day God said let there be this and let the other bring forth and all that and God saw it was good in other words was perfect the sword and the spoken what is the original seat that is sword the sword let their animals comfort let me let me let the sea bring for us and all of that and God saw that it was good every song I'm planting God did was perfect I'm good so why is I also implying not producing the same results because we are on a different plane from him or rather is on a different plane from us say as they have reserved of the earth so I my waist up of your wish I my foot above your thoughts Oh God Almighty already glory so each time God sort his word he said he reflects in every single time and we also saw in reap but unlike God we don't reap perfection nothing man does is perfect amen but like some 18 and verse 30 says as for God his way is perfect but we have never been able to come to that yet and we'll come to that because he is sent a word the maracas for some planning all of that a prophet Brad will come forth to where she will speak and the Warwick reserved just like that and you will see and see that it is good exactly what your sport will come to pass nor will goddamn hand that's why when got a precious gift in a proper to whoever there's no magic Vera wanker splits into a profit is exactly on the spot if it doesn't happen one time he is a problem there and these guys are spent all their lives leno show and see what brother brahma said some they're not happen you won't find it you can't cook stuff up and disappear all who are tune of disobedience while you will not be see the bride because the bride shall never be deceived a man or a god swords and rips perfection or the challenge we sow and reap and with re perfection it means therefore the gosh thoughts also in a ribbon I wish superior to our thoughts on so in a ribbon far higher than our thoughts on sowing and reaping does that make sense to you hallelujah nor will God so God's thoughts are totally on a totally more elevated level than our thoughts because it's those produce a perfect health it was produced a perfect game of Eden is the produce a perfect creation it starts produce a perfect man stand on the face of the earth Amen and we've never been able to do that just yet little God now that's the difference between your thoughts and your thinking let me make that clear before I go on but as I'm speaking I'm using them interchangeably but as a difference very bit differently your thoughts and your thinking the opposite I have thoughts first in my mind I'll show you how those thoughts come but God had thoughts on his mind how thoughts in mind I was no quitter all what was gonna be like thoughts in his mind who was gonna be saved who was gonna be saved but that wasn't his thinking thousands thinking the file is a powerful thing but the thinking is more powerful I was no really scripture I think I forgot let this mind be in you I believe it's Philippians the second chapter verses 5 to 11 you can read when you get home ask if it was on my contacts and wanama scriptures let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God that's a very perplexing scripture but I'll show you that's captured speaking about nothing about what the three for mystery of God because it's only by the three for mission of God that you're gonna see like that it's not robbery to be equal with God because God determined before the nation of the world God in Christ Christ in the bride going back to Eden a perfect man on the face of the earth I'm not your God's on the face of the earth so that was the three from Misha's was being spoken out there Jesus Christ sorry no robbery to be equal with God he needs us women I just go and take it something that your labor and fight for it's not a gift it's something you labor and fight for but it's already given to you Amen oh my lord I saw your thoughts all kinds of first come in your mind you can say I have thoughts I have bad thoughts first the devil's job to put bad sauce in your mind but if you don't understand that's what you're thinking that they will fool you because that is not your thinking amen another scripture says Amen I believe that is a Philippians 4 and verse 8 say whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things of a good report in other words there are different thoughts pure thoughts lovely thoughts good thoughts good reports all those thoughts are there this how you can you're thinking whatsoever things appear a lovely a harness of a good report think on these things you choose deliberately choose the thoughts you think on [Applause] any thought can come in your mind you can't tell the devil don't put this funny money on your mind heels chopped up what's on your mind but it's your job to choose your thinking let this mind be in you whatsoever things are pure that's what you think of that's what you think on these things glory glory can somebody shout hallelujah well let me say let me say that again you maybe see that I'm just talking to you Amen the preacher the preacher right LEM just what y'all started to you they may be seated are you following me are you falling out story the beautiful story of redemption your thoughts and your thinking two totally different things and brother Branham said your thoughts that's in your mind your mind that's the battle ground you have good and you have bad there the devil pushes for there goes forsythia - but it's up to you to choose your thinking and he said whatsoever things appear in other words of all the thoughts in your mind be deliberate be intentional to take the good thoughts the pure thoughts the harnessed thoughts the good reports that if he hear you think those thoughts will know you have a good report take those and think on those things and meditate on those things and as you do that those thoughts become your thinking as a man thinking in his head so easy that's not you from who you are that's how you become who you are the devil can make you what he wants to be no he don't have the power the devil don't have the power and brother Brown said make yourself a Christian being tensional be deliberate I will be a Christian I will have my thinking straighten out [Applause] but double camp or whatever thoughts but I will not think on those thoughts I would change my thinking I would change my thoughts am I thinking will become Who I am because I see man think it it is that so easy you maybe say that [Applause] that's what this gospel is not a gospel of do's and don'ts I can tell you don't do this here don't do that here that's not you yet who you are is comes from the inside as you think in your hat as you take those thoughts amen and meditate on those thoughts and let those thoughts come in and you think and focus and freeze on those thoughts in from your thinking from the inner man on the inside of you and that becomes who you are same way you couldn't do one thing wrong you could never do one thing wrong unless you became me thinking in your soul the devil don't have the power to make you do one thing wrong did you hear me but devil don't have the power to make it you one thing wrong may be seated I'm talking to you with Christian this way I am weak my money so mess up could you stand like a man face that devil say I'm a son of God here from here on out I'm gonna begin to choose my thinking and can who I am and make myself Christian make yourself a Christian by changing the thoughts by taking your thoughts that you want but a good lovely harness good report I'm forming them in your thinking you may be see that all glory [Applause] so God have thoughts of everything that will happen from a tiny budget and again when his thinking was special thoughts and UI in his thinking a man so I said you ain't got first all that you got to understand sin and all his evil was also in God's thoughts got new what's going to happen when he's thinking in his mind on the back panel his mind that's where he's thinking was and you're thinking the devil can't touch it because the water god is the incorruptible seed of the word of God nor man nor devil nor speak--and corrupted and the delicate corruptible porn with Fitness with music unless you'll allow him to do it he don't have the power [Applause] young man young woman he didn't have the power you may be seated Laurie cigar starts and goes thinking we higher than regular man's thoughts and thinking so when we come to the Lord when joined to think his thoughts and not our thoughts Isaiah 55 why are we in general thing his thoughts because we're going back to Eden his thoughts is thinking produce the gamma vinum produce a perfect world and we are going to get back to that perfection we can do this same kind of thinking like everybody has here Christian it'll shake yourself too many times within la-de-da our mission accom I never don't change sure I never change but it's a growing up there's a grown up into him in all things you can crop into him been a mediocre and Christian Bellamy joke at a Christian been a regular table a Christian no you cannot be because we're a super race to a super bright you a super Church as you're near the great headstone I am super that's what I think of me and you were super you a super tell your neighbor but the challengers arms in the cemetery neighbor you are super others boys and Gazan school you are not on the same level [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] Ori amen let me see that [Applause] [Music] so welcome to the Lord the Scriptures and join us to let this mind be in you which was also any question who's fighting a robbery to be equal with gonna like I said that's speaking right there of a three full ministry of god that was the only revelation that who will make Jesus Christ the nothing is robbery to be equal with God he knew the process you don't just break in and get the character of a son of God he knows the process the steps the procedure I know that God by spearonation Amen church with him before the formation of the world and he knows the priesthood not to be equal with God when his wasn't robbery he was president of people come with God but I know he's not robbery there's a process that the step in successive steps now to get there and jesus knew that so that's speaking about the fee for ministry and when we become a Christian I said when come in this message here we enjoined to get rid of our thoughts and begin to think his thoughts because we're going back to Eden amen we've got to go back first to the thoughts and the thinking that produce Eden in the first place or we'll never go about there that's what won't you everybody else talking the my vision is always a very popular topic um offer any concert mentioned songs I've gone I'm supposed to go like but the fuel pellets and they can have like temper already power but permanent power stays with you the only cause bothersome thinking the produce it in the first instance but the perm said if you split the world by the same thinking that produce the word in the first place you will get the same resource and this process here is about God walked in on the inside of us to get us to move our thinking to a totally different level by his preeminence is in our souls in our hearts in our lives the water God living in you and I in preeminence Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh mama amen lorry let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus whatsoever things appear think on these things because the man thinketh in his heart so he adds and leaves so is he your thoughts your thinking that's your inner man that's your spirit man on the inside of you there's a spiritual heart on the instead of you I don't which flow all of your life all the issues of the life come from that thinking in that spirit man on the instead of you Oh unfortunately too many of us funny very difficult to elevate our thinking to God's level of thinking does never love thinking for you your second senses your life your job your Christian walk your family your career your job for every area of your life we find it so difficult to elevate our thinking to the level that goes is my thoughts are higher than your thoughts I'm always higher than your ways and when you come up to his level of thinking you will see the way how he achieves that thinking to make it coming to a manifestation but why you stay and your level of thinking you'll be struggling against the booze and trying to make those thoughts come to pass I'm a Christian and you are struggling there's no struggling Christian if you are struggling as a Christian some is not right young man hear me young woman hear me if you are struggling as the Christian something is not right the only way a Christian struggles your struggle and prayer with God to get on your knees bagi at the knees you are laboring soul shall fail with God but a Christian don't struggle to not sing glory to God a man can I get a witness back I can hear you a Christian don't struggle to not sin because the speed of God this speed are cut off a came the devil how are you going to struggle against the devil anymore the daily struggle against Goliath Israel struggle but not David they will run into the army grunting aloud with confidence that's a fast shadow of a Christian hallelujah there's a challenge we don't deny that a challenge there but we face it an elevated level of thinking God's level of thinking and we said to every challenge this Egyptians your city there you shall see them no more forever you say like David you come against me the name of your gods but I come against you in the name of the Lord color they have a very earth whom you have defied don't you understand you may be seated don't you understand you may be seated [Applause] don't you understand that every challenge that comes at you to make the water god looks like it's a lie don't you understand that that challenge is to find the god of the heavens and the earth and David without the Holy Ghost he said I will not stand for it I will not let you to find my god or defy his armies and David went to face Goliath every challenge I was like a Goliath you face it at an elevated level of thinking we are not going to print like Israel we're going to face it and we're gonna profess how's it go on you'll fall at my feet those are not man's words as my thoughts are higher than the earth so are my thoughts on my ways higher than your ways [Applause] proceeded israel and saw their thoughts where grasshoppers before Goliath to forego lieth you need years of experience that's the way to to bring this victory the comparison is years of experience you need this ammo that you wear the ammo you are called by everywhere that's man's thoughts and his ways to achieve what he thought what needs to be achieved but come to a man who has reached that level the elevated level of thinking thinking differently than the rest of the group who care nothing about being popular with the rest of the group mi wash can alone if you have to stand alone stand alone hallelujah and David came he began to speak like no no other manner ever spoken baby said your servant so I am your seven but is on second self listen I will go and fight him I will kill him today so cringe don't talk like that young man don't talk like that don't talk like that he's a man of war from his youth oh not just a small boy because I was living at this level here I wanted to keep David at that level of thinking don't let them do it to you don't let no challenge no circumstance nothing keep you have a level of thinking you are neither flop your eagle wings and soar into the heavens you're not kicking you wanna add banquet you're flying to the skies where thoughts are higher than man's thoughts race ways are higher the man's ways hallelujah [Applause] there is bogus thoughts and he showed us ways of confronting the challenge my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways my thoughts are way higher on a different level I think different than you think on my ways

Malachi for with a message from the man of God to elevate you into the level of thinking you have to think differently you got to think different from the regular man until it is your example so many
