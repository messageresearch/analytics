you for your presence Lord we thank you for guiding us together that we could guide our own your word in this end time our Lord Isaiah prophesied a gross Darkness would cover the Earth growth stocks have been cover the people but they're going to be a light and the bribe will arise and train father may you shine light on your word today that we could see where to place our feet and as we grow closer further as we get nearer to your coming I believe that everything will be made more and more clear even as the disciples told us Jesus one time you have played you have spoken plainly speak plainly to us tonight by Your Word by your spirit in Jesus might ask it God bless you thanks again for coming out it's a problem to be here you want to go straight into the wood St John 6 we want to read from 51 to 63 and also Matthew chapter 25 we want to go from uh verse 1 to 13. praise the Lord so we see what Allah will do we thank God for blessing on Sunday [Applause] while the end is nearing so we can call a warning okay uh Saint John 6 reading from verse 51 I am the living bread this is Jesus which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread which I shall that I shall will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore stroll among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily sun to you except he eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth My Flesh and took it my blood had eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood to other than me and I in him as the living father had sent me and I lived by the father so he that heated me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came not from Heaven not as your father did eat mana and are dead either eat it of this bread shall live forever these things that he in the synagogue as he taught in caperna many therefore of his disciples when they had heard they says disa is a heart who can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if he shall see the son of man ascending up where he was before it is the spirit that quickness the flesh Prof the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and their life so they are hearing is tough but you tell them your words I'm speaking it's not just normal words they are spirit and their life you want to go to Matthew chapter 25 familiar scripture then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be lightened under 10 virgins we took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lambs took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels put their lamps while the prayer groom tari they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom cometh go here to meet him then all those versions of rules and trimmed the lamps and the foolish said unto the wines give us of your oil for our Lambs are gone up and but the wise answered saying not so least there have been not enough for us and you but going rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were already went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut and afterwards came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us he answered and said verily I see unto you I know you're not watch therefore for you know neither The Deen or the hour where the Solomon commit father may God bless his word in Jesus name amen praise God he may be seated we have one prayer request we take after this okay so tonight I have uh these four words the oil the spirit so the message from uh Sunday and this message for tonight this came to me some while now when I was working on it but so that was part and this is like a continuation of it the oil the spirit the Holy Spirit praise God the oil the spirit the seed the rain season and time of habits seed need a sword son of man seed real mechanics Dynamics the word the spirit for marine Lottery husband man praise God seed need rain and then see go through process if there is no rain there's no process to go through the sea just remain a seed but once you have seed you need rain Hallelujah and as a for marine and lettering for marine is the dictionary so you have to have teaching room and then you have to have Harvest or lettering to make manifest what have been taught it can't be just teach and rain all these years it has to have a harvest ring it's not right the bread the message the book so if we talk about the book which is the bread that came along in relation 10 and 17 destroy the voices out from that book now have the bread of life that the bride gonna partake of praise God so the book itself is seed but the back is spirit that means the seals the seed but the seven thunders of the spirit that they hit the seed from the inside the book the book was written within on the back side have no writing it was sealed with Seven Seals which are seven Thunders from under the seventh seal o glory to God so some point in time we have to go back to Spirit isn't that right no this seed we're talking about is not just any word it's so Original Seed an original seed only comes from the mouth of God and the Mountain of God Is His prophets not pastors not teachers not evangelists it's prophets so whatever said a prophet out of his mouth have Original Seed and other men have to take from his mouth Oh Glory for what's not the monk of God to preach the same thing that's why he said the spirit the prophet and the bride have to say the same thing because your Original Seed has to come from the Mount of God that's how you know his Original Seed other than that is intellectual and gray matter trying to interpret what is sealed in the book oh give the Lord a praise offering glory to God this Original Seed note my words original didn't reveal Liars charlatans Oh Glory to God hallelujah con Men Behind the pulpit praise God the original see who received that seed the bride receive it how hot is the ground that the seed must come on therefore they have condition has to be prepared to receive the seed so God is the one who set the grounds in order Oh Glory to God and when they have a rough time coming he said break up the fallow ground glory to God that you could get seed in that gun goddess [Applause] they had people still after all these years still going around it still have water in the heart and the in the message oh glory to God no see they're growing them back no rain has fallen on that you have to get rid of them rocks out to your system or you have to break up the fallow ground this method of breaking up oh glory to God I'm messing up amen and attracted to come with some and turn up the soil before foreign they never really believe they've never had a real Revelation Revelation they can't move you from that oh glory to God you can backstride but they can't move you from the revelation of Jesus Christ that God put inside your soul Oh Glory to God Upon This Rock I will be my church no man could give a revelation it's tilted the Holy Ghost they get the Revelation the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the revelation of Jesus Christ you need a revelation of Jesus Christ Oh Glory not I belong to no message yeah belong to no message without the revelation of Jesus Christ and the Revel limit is always brotherly kindness all glory will give the Lord a shout in the house if they don't have that give nothing a message because the blood kindness we'll give the Lord a shout in the house or glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God praise God so you need seed Hallelujah see from where to where from whose hand the son of man these are sore but we don't know the name is another man did it Hallelujah but the sower is the son of man when they get seized he's the sower of The Good Seed you have other seeds but the good seed the son of man who glory to God Hallelujah so the rain comes to activate the growth process in the heart of man and heart you have rocks you have Stony grounds you have hard grounds you have all kind of grounds in the heart of men so no no Minister controlling that people coming to church and claim to be bride and the other spoken book and reading that is foolishness God knows what's inside their heart only the word the devil carries in your heart and that's why he call you who if on you he call and the back part of his mind when he saw you then he could call you now and the devil becomes a liar to you when you get the revelation of your calling he's a liar every time you open his mouth the devil not even a picture if you wrestling with what God promised devil outed the picture he can't stop nothing okay the Lord here they get permission to even approach you or give the Lord a shout in the house you him name your own self we call it Justified we justify you already glorified okay the Lord I shout in the house when Elijah dropped the mantle of Elisha Elisha went down brought everything behind him he said as the Lord live it I will not stop I ain't letting you go I will stay with you praise God he says stay I said stay away I stay in here oh give the Lord I shout why he had a revelation he had an inspiration but when Court give you a revelation that brings a vision okay the Lord a shout in the house do you get what I'm saying a real Revelation bring the vision [Music] when when when Abraham get the relationship Isaac being a vision so you can get all digital Mountain she already here follows your head till she ain't coming on she bet that they changed nothing because he had a revelation that God said so and there's going to be a price Revival I become a dead people Insider here how much slumbering and sleeping how much foolish version and sleeping position inside of here oh give the Lord some prayers go to the Revival why because contact oh God what can't lie like [Applause] hey [Applause] I'll be 65 years old this year now it could give me 21 years of life you'll be hearing the same thing for the next 20 years so sparkle your seat belt and hang inside the deal because we preaching the same thing okay the Lord I shout give it up 20 more years again I will be pumping for 20 more years in courtship so the devil is still a liar there's gonna be a Rapture I'll give the Lord some Praises amen so the seed life the seed that need rain to activate the growth process is not what the same church it was about the seven Church Ages was the unfolding of God's seed that was planted on the day of Pentecost which was the original seed that is why brother Ram couldn't bring something new he had to turn our hearts back yeah to the feet of the fathers because the faith of the fathers was the original you can't go outside of the original you have to go back to the original Oh Glory the god things weren't perfected from the original so to go back you talk about the poor you have to go back to pay a Pentecost you have to go back to Spirit you have to go back to Power because that is where the church full started out okay the Lord that praise offering Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah but that first church didn't live for the coming of the Lord we are going to be living for the coming of the Lord [Music] so that first church did not have the oil that is required now for who also have in our lamps and the reason is oil and land is nighttime they all stumble and set but at midnight a wake-up call came Oh Glory to God the bride had no Revival yet it will take them seven thumbnails to wake up the price wake up call not just by Revelation but by a manifestation he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival that we would find from everywhere they say the seven thunders of Revelation is being made manifest manifest not resilience manifested the Lord some shout I know we don't have those words but we've seen it like it is oh glory to God it has to come to that spot my God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so this seed is what God promised to restore to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to bring back the oil the spirit Jewish members with books and tapes messages revelation Mysteries do you get that Revelations no oil Mysteries annoying churches are no oil pickings and posts no oil trying to control the Bride of Jesus Christ good luck with that Noel Manu take the position outside the local church man trying to say dear bride their bride who what put some money what kind of food human that they in authority to control man and ministers and the power the following five foreign [Music] on the way to the tribulation no oil where is the oil where is the spirit the oil is the spirit not text not Mysteries not Revelations the oil spirit okay the Lord some praises not messages not nice sermons not nice title of sermons but the oil is the spirit let's save that there's kneel at him tonight the oil is a spirit the Oilers are coming to his soul Tabernacle we always are having spoken with books the ordinary person play on a Sunday morning we press and play the playback oppressible the oil is the oil the oil is a spirit he said not by might not by power but by my spirit Oh Glory the god of the elderly yesterday whether your husband living right or not they're still looking at the Spirit whether a white person is trying to get the spirit be all in the spirit to go into the Rapture you have to get the spirit because the spirit is often said that the Lord has shout in the house definitely started tonight Oh Glory the god inspire me Hallelujah Oh Glory they're gonna hope the fire follow you want me to caught him in spirit is power spirit is Witness spirit is confirmation the anointing is to confirm the word so when God released the anointing they still confirm the word and they are not Mr prick the Yoke the break of wickedness to break plans the brakes on the leaves the brick sickness to break your bondage to get your days humbering that's what your anointing come to do praise God by Slumber when the end is near him fill me lamps behold the prank won't come out hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory and the reason the call after trim the lamps is to see properly because after the lamp is burning you have to shoot and have a product from that and you have to clip it and you have to get a clip in your life that you could shine this light May many many men there must be a time of harvest it must be a time to sow there must be a time to reap there must have a time of teaching I have a time of harvest Harvest rain is not right the rain to have is the crop oh my the bite has not revived us yet after the last time we close our flash service there has been no Revival there no manifestation of God to steal the bride yet he said it specifically there is no other explanation there is no other interpretation no money vision of God no no man come from nowhere not some books from Jacksonville no no manifestation of God there's still the bride listen not for the random message this is whatever message manifested the book there has been no way is it manifestation of quarters to the bright I'm not talking about the Revelation manifestation [Music] when Elijah getting mantle he said I want a double portion if you see me go ahead and have it I'm watching me watch any Focus he ain't making a move he ain't watching all other stuff here watching on Sideshow he could focus because he said if you see me go you can have it Hallelujah chat a fire drop down Elijah drop down the mountain the man of God talk of that matter talk of his old robe throw it on only to realize if you see him he had the books he had the tapes he walked away like a walk he put his foot and realize your foot and he had no power on any other recognize he had to make a difference between a switch now he thought the mantle had it because you see I'm pleasure with that mantle and when he recognized it wasn't the mantle it was the god of Elijah he took the same mantle he said oh and so this thing does work and he strike the totem where is the Lord color Elijah I have the word but where is the spirit look look at the Lord I shout in the house I have mechanics but where's the Dynamics oh give the Lord a shout or party all is a spirit be all in the spirit and when he struck the Jordan Jordan opened up and all them prophets all them wise men all their message men who were looking for us when he walked you they say the spirit of Elijah don't press the body Elijah and I'm telling you there's going to be a pride abide in Trinidad and around the world where the world with power of men and women who cause children there is a spirit of nature but that's the population or give the Lord some Praises that Pride will be that Elijah oh my God Glory [Applause] no manifestation of God to wake up the bride that means let's drill a little bit they say we'll take them seven dollars then the seven Thunders is to produce manifestation of God just to the bride then the seven dollars had to be God himself I hear you praise God you're trying to have a bigger shop inside here today the seven dinners had to be called himself God Almighty not some man interpreting anything or call unknown tongues are known Thunders Christ himself rocked seven Thunder soccer voices well John couldn't write that one I see about the right is a sealer don't write it they go manifested Oh Glory to God are feeling good tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah it will take those seven unknown conditions to wake her up again because she was dead and then he said he will send it who looking for it looking for America from Europe from Africa from South America looking for somebody he who is he he but but but you have to bring it oh [Music] you say but that's not working yeah you will send it you know how I don't know when does he promised it all my job is to look for it Hallelujah when them when them three wise men saw these started so we have seen this time it is we have come to be stargazers we are completely send me a text and say we see our stuff but we come to worship we come to identify Messiah we know it's time and seasoning if all kind of things taken place will show this is the end time the drive has to be coming with the shape to receive the oil because she have to have extra the Packer with despite after a relation of the extra oil the foolish versions them just want to be church members but the pride not in that church membership thing oh glory to God Hallelujah the brighten the oil thing the pride in the spirit thing gives me oil in my time to get me burning Oh Glory love God give me oil in my lump I pray glory god you had

some Praises we pump them this more but every partner tonight the oil is a spirit the spirit Victory Fighter the spirit bring conviction the spirit brings healing the spirit being quick man Jesus said the spirit is what quickly foreign [Applause] the spirit of quickness and brother kindly the devil's job over the years was to keep the church open the spirit the devil drop over the years was to make sure and come intellectual stiff and starchy hardly could say Amen how they could shout I'll make a praise God there's a bunch of deaf church members and their people like it too because the preachers I get so because they can spend followers explaining what they don't know or glory of God how could you explain the spirit will a spirit move it over there what look what the spirit does what it wants hey Hallelujah [Applause] you think God didn't know this word was gonna go on print and when it Go and print it would be an argument and debate and more motivation who you think God didn't know that he knew that my Bible tell me Abel offer unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King and God sent fire and Even's offering the Revelation lead him to the right expression of worship that God could Vindicated by saying fire on it Oh Glory to God fire on Abus Altar and God rejected what came out to offer of his interpretation of his ideas Oh Glory the god of his intellectualism thank you Jesus what about him now remember let me stop you a minute the Great Tribulation is those people that are sleeping virgins that didn't have oil in their lamps yet they belong to an organization good people went to church everything else but they come for oil too late to throw in the Great Tribulation hallelujah praise God the sleeping version going back to buy some oil but that is when he come while

slaughtering angels Sam for the slaughtering angels the one among them had an incorn in cornwriter he said put a mark Upon Our certainty like bunch of people upon those that sigh and cry that Mark was

life will never come to life he say this just remember I speak it in the name of the Lord and this is on tape they will never never come to life they are done so that's the reason I am not interested in them programs I'm interested in wanting blasting just as hard as I can to whosoever will not resurrect a denomination but bring back Jesus Christ bunch of insecure pastors and ministers all the kids own church to defend their own church be free they lose sheep and with the insecurity the preaching message to their level of insecurity to protect themselves and the prophet said Force anointed bang the People by fear to them entering that false teaching that the people married to the pastor somebody else they get all three liars false teacher false Doctrine as I said already my wife is Sister Anne Marie not them three cannot believe oh give the Lord some praises all right for the brown and we find out that this six seal now being opened it was for a triple purpose here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through tribulation period for purification which is sexy judgment well the tribulation is the reward of the foolish vision for being so foolish having a person like this and being foolish with it we're not talking about Pelicans we're not talking about baptist and methodists we talk about message foolished versions amen amen we read books and tips on the oil yeah be with nice churches annoyed condition churches passes and everything else any message but no oil preaching to tribulation Saints without oil [Music] but George is not easy what Hallelujah she had to be purged over sins of unbelief and rejecting the message and and deeper he said the bride dominant church members foolish version who reject the third part of the Bride yeah have to suffer for it so that means the revelation of the Cornerstone that becomes the headstone rejected in this message they have to suffer for this because the stone they both refuse has become and in the full church that was the Cornerstone in the full church is the Capstone yes to the Capstone which is holy spirit that Holy Spirit slaught when that comes now from Revelation to manifestation is rejected the rejection would form first when the spirit of the word come they reject is already rejected Oh Glory to God because you are marked not to be sealed oh God Holy Spirit mocking you by the word to be sealed first you are seen by the word then you are seen by the spirit Jesus said the word that I speak they are Spirit their life [Applause] [Applause] within you that's the kingdom of God that's why she has to tell them if you say hello here lawyer go here go here forget them behold the kingdom is within you what can the Lord I shout in the house [Applause] Glory

said you get those wounds they will ask him he's in the house of my friends not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected him as Messiah it will be a mournful time for those who left the Gentiles who rejected him a savior of this day they'll be weeping and willing the sleeping virgins will be willing d represented the church that refused to get oil symbol of the holy spirit in the lamps symbol of the body or hold of the oil until it was too late it wasn't that it wasn't good people they were virgins that signified a high high moral order but it didn't have oil in the lungs so they were cast out where they were wheeling and Wheeling a nation of teeth oh my God all right time running no Minister Cana being a Revival there's no preach I can bring a Revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is be loyal to God and his word and the Revival has to come by the people prophecy direct word has to come by the people so this seventh on the Revival has to come by

seen them as a priests and them you know they they were sitting on that I say we arrested on that but Paul appreciated I want you to be like an Ephesian Church find who claim to be a person in front of you to be Liars say USA [Music] but overnight but I trained by the word yeah what he would say I appreciate it or just tell everybody what to say will you say nothing Bible God help me if they invite me and they started talking to that craziness I hope I could hold him a piece I'll keep him peace he says um member is to revive what's in the church like the water or the sea are only 500 Degrees it's enough and spacing things up to the shore I Revival boil the trash of the church cleans us up it brings our Holiness it brings our presence to bring in a weakening to bring up quickness a man preaching his best preaching the best but when the five God trip inside of there there's something completely different you rather explain somebody you only want to talk and the explanation only person gone God flush around his head praise God they just disappear they get convicted they get they get arrested by the spirit of God oh my God hallelujah praise God but I'm sorry remember my brother when coming back from the sea old battlefields and things those old veterans they come in the site of the Statue of Liberty and roll them cripples up there so they could see the Statue of Liberty you could see first on the ship and it was so high and you can see the arms standing up and then man began to bring on cry just like great big man standing fall right over the Decks that what was it a sign of Liberty everything that they ever loved laid right behind that sign oh but what will it be when I hear the old chip of Zion blow that morning I see the banners waving when the battle is over and the victory's won and we're coming home where deaths in hell is conquered where there's no more sin No More Death no more sorrow I can just hear the whistleblowing we are nearing the city the breakers are coming in The Old Ship is moving into place God help us to live for that hour and then he began to pray he was praying and then some God doesn't call a man to judgment he was praying Lord Jesus we are a people who are trying our best with all that's in us to walk in the light of the Gospel of your great gospel that you die to make right we are so thankful to seeing this evil that is that we live in now in this hour as we see the signs appearing oh God as we know that Deliverance is closed at him we preach we cross the country we see you work with Great Signs show yourself yeah every year that's not a year pass and a supernatural sign is striking it not many in number but what a powerful group got eternal life they shall run through a troop and leap over walls yes the truth of that will have no wholeness to it she'll run right through it leap over the wall between natural and human going to the arms of God I pray God Prophet praying that tonight if there be some here who doesn't know you who have never made their peace made tonight while we are speaking a little voice has been speaking down in the heart I feel a warning I can't be around much longer oh God may they put the hopes in order right now may everything be set May the coldness maybe they are Christians they have lived under this so long seen so much things they have lost the value of it the things that take lightly instead of deeply and sincerely I'll hear the part I want to get to he said oh God let us check up tonight granted knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapturing church and if we are leading with sin and with unbelief and with snot fullness we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you will burn into us the Holy Ghost going into our hearts oh God set our souls on fire preacher blessings help us to understand oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah you say we know if we're laying down with sin with slothfulness and so on we will not make the Rapture it has nothing to do with I am in the message or give the Lord some prisons I want to nail that down it has nothing to do with how long you're in the message all right let's go Spring Lake and let us pray blessed Heavenly Father tonight at the beginning of this revival as our time was stripped up now a little past that praising to be merciful to these people and Grant almighty God that here tonight at least 20 hands went up in the building that they needed Christ oh God it's their souls the spirit the oil is just about burnt out there won't be much more when the last drops is gone from the bucket or the container there'll be no more oil put in lamps they realize that during the last days there's not a Hope on Earth for us outside of Christ I pray tonight Lord that somehow in the summer some southernness of this moment the solemnity that you will now send the holy spirit that made them raise their hands and save them from a life of sin oh my Hallelujah way be out some of the time I finish the message too much he's talking about watch them 10 virgins five had no oil what is oil the holy spirit amen they were all virgins left good and clean both our books both have tips both listen to The Prophet would go to churches would listen to nice fine preachers and so on both are nice people they ain't carrying on they're not playing lotto and gambling and carrying on both our versions when I was amen amen hallelujah brother I don't go to dancing I don't go to the show that's just moral things unless there have been a supernatural not because you shouted not because you're smoking down not because you jump up and down not because you did this but something supernatural has to happen here that change you and put you a seed as you a sealed love in God you are uncut there's a wise virgins virgins who had oil in the lamp rapturing feet my God that is where I could sign off tonight so now the process which is spirit and put the oil as wrapped in feet how could you go in the Rapture without you in feet Oh Glory to God do you see it come on come here again there's a wise virgins who are all in their lamps Rapture and faith believe in all the signs Oneness prophecies everything and these five cutout of the remnant was taken away and the rest of them were still virgins will not be lost but will go to the tribulation period so if you want to be not going to be lost group and you want to choose that heads up to you but your bride have to have Rapture and faith we should find out tonight is the oil and the oil is the spirit Oh Glory to God Amen he said that's the reason we anoint with oil it represent the Holy Ghost the oil of the spirit now these have the Holy Ghost these were Sanctified these were Sanctified plus the Holy Ghost Plus it's bright Plus Holy Ghost Hallelujah top of the line Oh Glory to God top of the lane right these are the Holy Ghost these were Sanctified these were signified plus the Holy Ghost these in all the phenomenals and everything of God's power everything was spoken they had to believe in it they were taken out they said give us no they say we're just not enough for us in Rapture he said go to them who sell and they went to try to pray through them to receive the Holy Ghost try to what oh so we're supposed to preach we know I am you mean the people have been treated here and here what a word I never hear anything like that you know and people still going with the foolishness nobody else have it like we you know hey the kind of mysteries and the scripture in Jeremiah see my people like it so the only type in the spirit they want to take notes you could take on listen Baptist one but when you better cry for the spirit there's only one way to get it you say Mary had to lose that dignity in the upper room why didn't God get them 14 days for my days God gave them your problem for to get rid of stuff they say oh God is staying too long but somebody feel led somebody feel good I feel like with I'm moving on we're here today ain't going nowhere he said yes no wait until oh my are you with me watch they went to pray through then to receive the Holy Ghost but the gentle disposition had been finished and the persecutional rules my God then he said what's the remnant we talk about that the cloth cut out and what is God's election got elects his church God predestinated his church God for ordin his church and he takes the church out and the remnant is left to go through the tribulation period now what is the oil question the oil was the Holy Spirit not a tip not a book not an unfolding mystery the oil is Holy Spirit still need despair after the Revelation you still need oil is spirit virgin means Purity they were all good people every one of them virgin 35 verses of court but those who are all in the lamps went in the others was left out they were all virgins everyone people and you couldn't put a thing on anything wrong they believed in the coming of the Lord they were ready to go to meet him but some of them let their oil go out so they had a portion of spirit portion of oil and they let it go out don't let that be your case if you don't get nothing else tonight get this part don't let that be your case keep all in your lap oil is the spirit the Holy Spirit never let a Dream from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and the cause quickly go to him who has the function of oil and buy for yourself a feeling of the Holy Spirit oh give the Lord a shouting out no minister no Pastor could put doctors inside of you you have to have that taste you have to say like all the FSA created me a clean heart and take not to hold my hold of my salvation and renew a right Spirit Within Me Oh Glory to God has the heart Panthers to the water book so my soul just after living God [Applause] but God could give you that oh my God hallelujah I'm gonna close your son but this is important this is this is gold are you ready everybody alive all right fire is the confirmation of the light coming from the word higher [Applause] shout out tonight fire is the confirmation of the light coming from the word the swice Virgin at all in the lamp and she trimmed her lamp and lit it no what is it God is the word the oil is the spirit the fire is the Gospel Light on that oil Oh Glory my god do you get that let me say it again God is the word the oil is the spirit and the fire is the Gospel Light on that oil God said so that's the vessel the oil is in the vessel and the fire burning it shows it's reflecting the light of what the word said the fire glory to God but a punch the frick the fire what she said burning it shows it is reflecting the light of what the word said that's the reflection the wise version could do that the foolish can't do that Glory the gods of the wise version glory to God to take the same scripture same thought and put fire on it foolish Pastor Minister can't do that what can the Lord I shout glory to God what did Jesus says when he took the book he said the spirit is upon me I can say the oil is upon me yellow oil down from the Congress head to the soil's feet oil was just beating him down he said the spirit is upon me for he hath anointed me well Gloria caught to bring good parents [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and that same God that anointed Jesus going to anoint you with the oil give me all in my lamp I pray oh give the Lord of soap the oil is the spirit tonight Hallelujah and everything is a mistake the prophet make he ain't make no mistake you can hear what he said afterwards the foolish versions was on the outside had no oil and they couldn't reflect nothing but just their church and their denomination hey reflect is what the pastors do to reflecting the church our denomination Give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah now you say the word was Spirit yes sir God said my word is spirit oh my God oh my God Hallelujah tonight [Applause] the people are in the spirit of the last days that's how we know judgments Sodom sodomites are to come in the spirit yes and and the United Nations have to get in the spirit it's a spirit atmosphere and for the bride have to cut get into the spirit of the coming of the Lord see all right now watch he said well you say well all Christendom is looking for the coming of the Lord and the Wrath of the church all that's got any knowledge of the word well here we go if we can't have faith enough for Divine Healing how are we going to have rapture so there has to have a Revival of healing again it has to have I'll write this trailer once more it has to have the power of God demonstrated because let me read it because he said that he's a small partner yeah okay let's go to you there was a lie all right he said I believe there's a great calling going forward you say when we see the hand of God moving on to signs and wonders let's start falling on I believe we are on the Borderland tonight and I was wondering about all my meetings and things I had to cancel them out I truly believe here we go before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have Rapture in feet we can't eat my faith for Divine Healing lesson Faith you've got to have faith that will change and Quicken this body and we take no way and I believe there's a children's root tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there it will flush like lightning and our church is coming out not a psychologist not some put on make believe but a real genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church all right I have a little testimony before the prayer line just at the time they promised about to be fulfilled the Israelites were fearing presumptuously down in Egypt they were getting along all right a great Prestige that Joseph had before the King by Stephen Egypt in the seven years of family and God had given fever but when there come a time for the promise to be fulfilled there is about pharaoh who knew not Joseph and they begin a persecution and it caused in the persecution is that cause that the people had to go to crowding together and praying what did it the persecution no no the persecution caused the people to get together and praying and always always persecution strengthens the cause it's been to the age persecution I have there's an echo yeah I have a great faith to believe that one day our little [Applause] Liberty principle I got faith so he's talking about the persecution time right he said I have great faith to believe that one day before the coming of the Lord that our differences will be settled God may have to let communism sweep us together but something will take place that will make us all one heart in one Accord then he goes down if we cannot Faith No for healing how are we going to have Rapture and faith you've got that fit for the little things please before the greetings he calling healing and English greetings there will be something that will cause he said okay I'll ask Jesus said to this mountain and so on he said we are now road now sooner coming to the Lord Jesus we have got to have Rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in the treatment of an eye to go out or we will not go but don't worry it will be there it will be there then here come the prophecy when the power of this church Rises [Applause] [Music] not explanation not for our messages explaining what they don't know when the power of this church Rises what man could bring the power if you understand when the power rise he said it will bring the Brethren when the power of that's just right it will bring his Brethren but that's just right you bring the veteran both that's just right you bring the other bedroom and there'll be a general Resurrection we've United on the power oh give the Lord a shout and persecution had to drive us to pray pressure when I press come down closers don't have free whatever it is pressure to come hallelujah hallelujah my God hallelujah now watch this here watch this the other Angel was message of the Earth this is the design but it's angel to the angels of Ephesus but this one didn't come from the Earth he come from heaven because the mystery is finished and when the mystery is finished time shall be no more and seven Thunders throw their voices out Oh Glory to God mystery finish Mighty Angel romantic version 10 won't come down seventh and destroy the voices out then he said this what if it is something to let us know how to enter into Rapture in fate we run and leap over walls is there something fixing to happen yes that these old man five bodies are going to be changed can I lift the seat oh Lord is this so close is this the threat the generation says my brethren what time is it where are we at oh my I don't know I don't know says I'm only honest with you my brothers I don't know if it's time the mission is all finished because there's something all over is that really them seven Thunders fixing out to utter something that the little group that is gathered together will receive a rapkin fate to go in the Rapture when he comes for we will be changed Oh Glory to God my prayers God if this be so I don't know Lord I was just telling the church if there'd be so long prepare our hearts make us ready Lord for that great hour Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus in that same service there's a time he said I feel like Isaiah in the temple when he saw the wings flying back and forth he says war is me my God first seal almost finished here we go it's something that we have heard for years but I hope that you hit a different way tonight and there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that are not even written at all and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing feet [Applause] what is the spirit so the seven times we revealed in order to get the bride together for what to hear some mighty man coming from me some oh Yoho he had to go right back to Oyo the seven Thunders Garden right together for the pride to get wrapped twin feet because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it who said so brother to you no the prophet said so he says there's something we have got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we have got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment to be swept off of his Earth and after a while the Lord will find where it is written oh man [Applause] [Music] look upon the churches and find out don't deny your action speaks louder than words they love the things of the world your big muscles won't meet the chance of the hour the Rapture and feet to take the church out of this thing before judgment come judgment is fixing to strike and I say as my friend Jack Moore said if God lets America get by with the thing is doing now he'll be morally obligated to raise up song tomorrow and apologize to him for building up and we don't know as a man asked me a few moments ago please I bought it coming up and the rapture we have lived the time out at the time of the Raptors at hand and we are looking here we go for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in and then he dropping something here when we see a god that can raise the Dead off of the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that eats a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give Rapture and Faith to the people he doesn't say when we see a message preach and he rarely bring that good word he didn't say that he pointed to a manifestation that would light the people of Fire into a rapturing feet and I am looking for a Time fought of the spirit of God in last days that we're now living in for another search of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapturing feet before it comes oh my Hallelujah my God let me close off of this begin to play something you know remember we earned horsepower too talk about calm down the church is moving up the holy ghost power is the holy ghost that we are justified by the Holy Ghost sanctify us your Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture and faith who does that the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture and Faith all right so we right down to the end here now did you notice how we backed up everywhere by his living presence consciously yes see that shows you don't have to just think we're just trying to say something some kind of mythical something what the what the Bible promised that's the truth let's talk about your anointing coming and confirming the word all right here it is bye we trust that God will give us great faith and tomorrow there will not be a feeble person left in the building when they come to you for prayer we just believe that no we will believe it no I've seen it so many times what about the true seed is what happened just as we have said people of God are being made ready by the word of Truth from the messenger to this age in her talk about the bride will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord I don't know I'm gonna close

have their own thoughts and the people feeling impressed with his ideas as Paul said I didn't come with you which entitled speech of man's Wisdom that your faith rested me you're good I never hear Paul preachers we are the best man in the hour not that foolish as Paul was not that he's a preaching that your feet will rest and the power of God here now being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord last quote so we got through everything tonight it says God is going to restore Lutheran age did not restore it started a Reformation president age did not restore the president restore but God has to restore for a candidates word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning what notice verse 25 it tells why we need restoration the Lucas can go on caterpillar have eaten all but the root no we are told all these insects are one of the same in different stages they are Antichrist spirit manifesting in organization denomination false Doctrine to the ages and that poor little root and stalking under his thought God isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring his original plantain back to original seed he is
