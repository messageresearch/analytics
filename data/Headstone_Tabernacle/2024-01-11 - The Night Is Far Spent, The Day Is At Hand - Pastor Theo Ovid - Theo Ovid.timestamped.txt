[40:29] Provisions for indulging the flesh or
[40:31] put a stop to thinking about the evil
[40:34] Cravings of your physical nature to
[40:37] gratify its desires and lust oh blessed
[40:41] be the name of the Lord so that is what
[40:43] this is all about this is when the tire
[40:46] hit the road this is where we coming
[40:47] into genuine Christianity praise God how
[40:51] God want us to be and Paul said warning
[40:54] and teaching every man to be perfect in
[40:55] Christ Jesus
[40:57] and his objective of the Gospel was to
[40:59] get Christ into the people his objective
[41:01] of the Gospel was to point them to Jesus
[41:03] Christ and that's why he said I come
[41:05] among you not with enticing words of man
[41:07] wisdom because when you come with man's
[41:08] Wisdom it look very impressive the man
[41:10] who bringing that wisdom but he said I
[41:12] come with you with the power of God that
[41:13] your faith May rest not in the wisdom of
[41:15] man but in the power of God when you see
[41:17] the power of God you know that is not
[41:19] Man's power that is God's power and man
[41:22] can't do that it's only God could do
[41:24] that so then you have faith in God Give
[41:26] the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[41:28] hallelujah when the man come out wise
[41:31] with his intellect and his knowledge and
[41:32] his information and his Revelation then
[41:34] he's very impressive he know more than
[41:36] any anybody else but when God come and
[41:38] do is shut the M of the critics and take
[41:40] take let let the intellectual take a
[41:42] seat oh give the Lord some Praises
[41:44] Hallelujah Revelation 71 after these
[41:47] things I saw four Angels standing on the
[41:50] four corners of the Earth holding the
[41:51] Four Winds of the earth that the wind
[41:53] shall not blow on the earth nor on the
[41:55] sea nor any tree and I saw another Angel

[42:28] number of them which were sealed and
[42:30] they were seal 144,000 of all the tribes

[47:06] day is at hand praise God
[47:09] hallelujah all right let's hit the road
[47:12] running tonight brother Bram he said we
[47:15] believe that all these great benefits
[47:17] that we enjoy today in this Christian
[47:19] economy we have was purchased at Calvary
[47:22] by the Son of God Jesus Christ he was
[47:25] wounded for transgression he was Bru all
[47:27] iniquities the chastisement of a peace
[47:29] was upon him and B CH we are healed it's
[47:31] all past tense it is something God has
[47:34] done for us at Calvary and as Christians
[47:36] we have a right to enjoy these blessings
[47:39] that he purchased for us oh God help me
[47:41] tonight we have a right don't tell me I
[47:44] can't have joy don't tell me I can't
[47:47] have peace don't tell me I can't have
[47:49] Revival don't tell me I can't have the
[47:51] Holy Ghost don't tell me don't tell
[47:54] me
[47:56] if the Lord I
[47:57] shout glory to God if your wife
[48:00] miserable you don't have to be miserable
[48:02] if your husband Cy you don't have to be
[48:04] cranky God purchased this thing for
[48:12] you it is
[48:14] something God has done for us at Calvary
[48:17] and as Christians we have the right to
[48:20] enjoy these blessings that he has
[48:21] purchased for us so therefore no man
[48:23] could save another it have to be so
[48:25] Jesus didn't have to die and when Jesus
[48:28] died at Calvary he settled the sin
[48:30] question forever and every man every
[48:32] creature on earth when he died was saved
[48:35] at that very minute the price was paid
[48:38] completely it was so met that God
[48:40] identified that it was true and the only
[48:42] thing we have to do is to receive this
[48:45] to accept it to believe it and accept it
[48:49] and no matter how much he died for our
[48:50] Salvation we must ourself accept it as
[48:55] our own own personal experience as our
[48:57] own desire praise God that's why the
[49:00] Bible can explicitly say haven dear for
[49:02] these promises let us cleanse ourselves
[49:06] from all filthiness of the Flesh and
[49:09] spirit you can't be Godly one day and
[49:11] filthy next day you can't be in and out
[49:13] and no no no no no he has be holy for I
[49:16] am Holy he said cleanse yourself
[49:19] sanctify Yourself clean your act up oh
[49:22] pull yourself together pull yourself up
[49:24] by the bootstrap don't stay as you are
[49:27] come on man we born in sin shape
[49:29] iniquity he don't expect us to stay in
[49:31] iniquity and stay in sin the gospel come
[49:33] to wash us to purge us to cleanse us to
[49:36] send fire upon us that is what the
[49:38] gospel come to do oh give the Lord a
[49:41] shout I'm not worthy to un loose his
[49:43] shoes but he that cometh after me he's
[49:46] going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[49:48] on Fire Fire cast the demons out fire
[49:51] cast the lust out fire cast this out
[49:54] that out whatever you have said of you
[49:56] fire handles
[49:58] it you are here Shou in the house
[50:01] Tabernacle glory to God do I hear
[50:03] somebody saying
[50:06] amen all right
[50:09] Hallelujah we must want to be saved and
[50:13] believe that upon the basis of his shed
[50:15] blood that we are saved after we met the
[50:18] recomends of the Bible here we go I
[50:21] believe in the Bible being the full
[50:23] revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:26] nothing to add to it nothing to take
[50:28] away it it is the full revelation of
[50:31] Jesus Christ now I do believe that God
[50:34] can do things that are not written in
[50:35] the Bible because he's God but as long
[50:38] as we can find it in the Bible as a
[50:41] promise then we know it's true because
[50:44] the word is true always so we believe
[50:47] him to keep his promise now we believe
[50:49] he's infinite being infinite he know all
[50:52] things he know all things he know he
[50:55] will be sitting right here tonight right
[50:57] he is is he's he is go he or if he's not
[51:00] infinite he isn't God so we believe that
[51:02] the word this Bible is the word of God
[51:06] and therefore you can hang your soul
[51:08] upon any phase of it that's the only way
[51:10] you can have faith is to believe faith
[51:13] has to have an anchor place somewhere it
[51:16] must anchor on a place and nothing could
[51:18] be more solid than the word of God
[51:21] because the word is God that's what the
[51:24] Bible teaches remember Sunday service
[51:26] not your feelings not your emotions not
[51:27] your color not your hair not your height
[51:29] not your complexion the word is God not
[51:31] your dream not your thoughts not your
[51:32] ideas but the word is God as long as the
[51:35] word said it you could hold to it you
[51:37] could say God you said so you could say
[51:40] God you can't lie you say God you
[51:42] promised me the Holy Ghost oh God you
[51:44] promis the Deliverance if I cry out unto
[51:46] you you will answer and I come to you
[51:49] tonight oh glory to God give the Lord
[51:51] some Praises now because him being
[51:53] infinite omnipotent omnipresent he
[51:56] cannot be one without the other infinite
[51:59] omn poent omnipresent isn't that right
[52:02] and to be God he has to be all of it
[52:04] therefore being finite as we are this
[52:07] year we can work on something we think
[52:09] we got it perfect next year we have to
[52:10] change our mind is different we found
[52:12] something better because we are finite
[52:14] but he is infinite and and and when he
[52:16] says a word is forever that way he could
[52:19] never be improved it could never be
[52:21] taken back if God was calling the scene
[52:23] in any case and the way God acted on
[52:25] that scene the first time he must
[52:27] forever act the same way when he's
[52:29] calling the scene again because if he
[52:31] act different if he did the first time
[52:33] then something is wrong it would not be
[52:35] perfect therefore he acted wrong when he
[52:37] acted the first time isn't that right
[52:39] therefore when God made a remedy for man
[52:42] to be saved in the Garden of Eden they
[52:44] tried to improve this remedy through
[52:46] 6,000 years and could never touch it he
[52:49] made it upon the basis of the shed blood
[52:51] Oh Glory to God in kangali he never
[52:54] changed it he never tried to educate
[52:56] people to Christ we Tred to denominate
[52:58] them to Christ we try all kind of
[53:00] systems and it all failed we will never
[53:03] be all one group we will never be all
[53:05] one church is by one Spirit we are all
[53:08] baptized into one body oh give the Lord
[53:11] a shout glory to God give the Lord a
[53:14] shout in the house is only the spirit
[53:16] can baptize all into one body glory to
[53:19] God Amen there's only one place that man
[53:21] can meet on the common ground of worship
[53:24] that is under the shed blood of of Jesus
[53:25] Christ it's always been that way from
[53:27] the beginning because he cannot change
[53:28] it it's always the blood isn't that
[53:30] right and today we think that we are
[53:32] different from the other fellow and so
[53:34] forth it does not work we must still
[53:37] accept the basis of the shed blood and
[53:40] therefore when God has called on the
[53:43] scene to heal a man he heal a man on the
[53:44] basis of his feet and when he call on
[53:47] the scene again he will heal the man the
[53:49] same way or he acted wrong if God ever
[53:52] did heal a man because he believ the
[53:54] next man call calls upon the same kind
[53:55] of faith God is obligated to do the same
[53:58] thing for the next man if not he's a
[54:01] respector of persons and acted wrong in
[54:03] the first place oh glory to God you see
[54:06] back to the world I believe it with all
[54:08] my heart now we expecting God to do
[54:10] great things for us how many can say
[54:12] Amen to that I want everybody in the
[54:14] church but here who would hear the tape

[1:03:47] to God
[1:03:49] amen amen amen amen he's the one on
[1:03:52] obligation because he's the the one who
[1:03:54] said it amen and we're only quoting what
[1:03:57] he said he's the same yesterday today
[1:04:00] and forever that is why I express it the
[1:04:02] first time the Bible is either truth or
[1:04:04] it isn't truth therefore in when the
[1:04:06] Bible say anything you can hold on to it
[1:04:09] for God is obligated to this word so if
[1:04:11] the Bible said behold I send you Malachi
[1:04:13] for Elijah the prophet if the Bible said
[1:04:16] that that's God's word a man have to
[1:04:18] come out of that to identify as that
[1:04:20] Elijah and if God said in he he placed
[1:04:23] gifts in the body pastors teachers
[1:04:25] Prophet evangelist some men have to come
[1:04:27] and manifest that that is not just a
[1:04:29] scripture you know that is word made
[1:04:30] flesh praise God that go unveil and have
[1:04:33] a name on it oh give the Lord a shout
[1:04:35] Christ go be veiled in that fightful
[1:04:37] Ministry it will be the ministry of
[1:04:39] Jesus Christ we give the Lord some
[1:04:42] Praises Hallelujah let's go he was born
[1:04:46] St John CH chapter 1 he started the
[1:04:48] first chapter he was born we know his
[1:04:50] birth how the angel Gabriel announced it
[1:04:52] Mary's mother how she conceived by the
[1:04:55] Holy Spirit how at the age of 30 years
[1:04:57] old he was baptized by his second cousin
[1:04:58] John the Baptist immediately he was
[1:05:00] taken to the Wilderness for Temptation
[1:05:02] for 40 days then returned back in the
[1:05:04] power of the spirit in the power of the
[1:05:06] Holy Spirit he returned to his
[1:05:10] ministry you see what that
[1:05:14] phrase so he can come and Messiah
[1:05:16] explain John and explain Moses and
[1:05:19] Ezekiel and here no God make Jesus pass
[1:05:21] the
[1:05:23] RO
[1:05:24] he had to go and face Lucifer one on
[1:05:28] one no Elder no Deon no py behind him
[1:05:31] some men like to walk py you know see
[1:05:33] walk about 10
[1:05:36] men you know 10 man plus one go to face
[1:05:39] the
[1:05:39] devil 10 +
[1:05:42] one py plus one Jesus
[1:05:46] alone and when he finish so he returned
[1:05:49] the power of the spirit yes sir he
[1:05:50] returned to his ministry now remember so
[1:05:53] but I'm tying watch this he just
[1:05:55] identified the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] how
[1:05:58] God administered it or how God unfolded
[1:06:02] it and listen to what he says right
[1:06:04] after that and remember he forbid the
[1:06:06] disciples to preach anymore or do
[1:06:08] anything until they went in the power of
[1:06:10] the spirit is so he connected when he
[1:06:13] get to the Wilderness he came what in
[1:06:15] the power of the spirit so now brother
[1:06:17] bandam is tying it with the promise of
[1:06:19] the upper room now he said remember he
[1:06:21] forbid the disciples to preach anymore
[1:06:24] or do anything until they went in the
[1:06:25] power of the spirit wait ye in the city
[1:06:28] of Jerusalem until be do power from on
[1:06:30] high you are not to go out until it's
[1:06:34] not
[1:06:35] you but God the people can see the
[1:06:41] reflection of Jesus Christ in you so
[1:06:45] this is more detailing what this power
[1:06:46] is all about now because Peter deny
[1:06:48] Christ Peter cuss Peter cut off man ears
[1:06:52] that's brother Peter that's not Jes
[1:06:56] Jesus so whatever they was to get in the
[1:06:59] upper room was to transform
[1:07:02] that that instead of brother Peter have
[1:07:04] a reflection with his anger temper and
[1:07:05] his bad behavior Christ could
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:10] be in other words other words God didn't
[1:07:13] want Peter's
[1:07:14] eloquence eloquence and no life could
[1:07:17] talk nice eloquent speaker he want to
[1:07:21] know what life is there amen all right
[1:07:24] so let's let's let's go again let's
[1:07:25] let's dig deep here now so God watch so
[1:07:28] you are not to go out until it's not you
[1:07:31] but God the people can see the
[1:07:33] reflection of Jesus Christ in you then
[1:07:37] the people will
[1:07:38] believe then because it won't be you it
[1:07:43] will be
[1:07:46] him they had to take note that they had
[1:07:50] Jesus been with Jesus not take note P
[1:07:53] that I know I know him no no take note
[1:07:57] that been with Jesus because they start
[1:07:58] to resemble Jesus and start to do what
[1:08:00] Jesus did we say Amen tonight all right
[1:08:04] so then the people will believe then
[1:08:06] because it won't be you it will be him
[1:08:09] and all he he will call they will see it
[1:08:12] my sheep know my voice now we notice
[1:08:15] then immediately when he entered into
[1:08:17] his
[1:08:19] ministry so you see now we have to enter
[1:08:22] into this new ministry
[1:08:24] by the spirit because the prophet
[1:08:26] prophesying message of Grace the church
[1:08:28] will be
[1:08:29] rebuilt in the power of the spirit and
[1:08:32] that is how your hearts will be turned
[1:08:34] back to the Fai of the
[1:08:35] fathers so right now the church has been
[1:08:38] built by the word which is mechanics but
[1:08:41] the rebuilding of the church is by
[1:08:42] Dynamics and the ministry has to come
[1:08:44] into Dynamics for the church to be
[1:08:46] rebuilt and the ministry of the spirit
[1:08:48] is what quickens the word to the bride
[1:08:51] so right now you're still on your way to
[1:08:52] your quickening Oh Glory to God so when
[1:08:55] the ministry per comes now and and and
[1:08:58] this is what happens now when that
[1:09:00] Ministry comes you find what happened
[1:09:03] Cornelius acts 10 why Peter yet spake
[1:09:07] these words the Holy Ghost fell Holy
[1:09:11] Ghost fell not not talked fell they
[1:09:15] don't like that in the message because
[1:09:16] it's not Fallen among them but the Holy
[1:09:17] Ghost fell say fell you like water fall
[1:09:21] on you right the Holy Ghost to fall on

[1:09:33] in it you may fall right down on the
[1:09:35] ground with it you may roll on the floor

[1:09:38] tongues with it but it have to fall on

[1:10:20] love of God Amen this a wine of the

[1:10:31] Spirit you know the bride is on on the
[1:10:33] march my Lord my Lord wooo Glory all
[1:10:39] right let's continue here now Matthew 25
[1:10:41] familiar scripture then was T the
[1:10:43] kingdom of heaven like not the 10
[1:10:44] virgins we took the lamps went forth to
[1:10:46] meet the bridegroom five of them in the
[1:10:48] message were wise five of them in the
[1:10:50] message were
[1:10:52] foolish squat in here but both in the
[1:10:56] message just making sure it get clear we
[1:10:58] don't want to take five foolish get
[1:11:00] something out there a missed no we don't
[1:11:03] want message folks five stripp message
[1:11:07] five foolish
[1:11:08] stripp however you want to say it that
[1:11:11] doesn't sound polish Bible say foolish
[1:11:13] foolish songs more
[1:11:15] elegant but it's
[1:11:17] stupid because they know he's
[1:11:21] coming they have the own interpretation
[1:11:24] he coming just now so I don't need extra
[1:11:28] oil
[1:11:31] ouch you'll hear how the bridegroom
[1:11:33] carried you see there Revelation say it
[1:11:37] happened so so so so so so so and their
[1:11:39] preparation comes with their
[1:11:42] Revelation but that is not what God
[1:11:43] coming God doesn't come to man's
[1:11:45] thinking and man's idea so let's read on
[1:11:49] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:11:51] and took no oil with them
[1:11:54] they have
[1:11:56] confidence they confidently
[1:12:00] foolish they
[1:12:02] not they
[1:12:04] took the
[1:12:06] vessels with no oil in
[1:12:09] there but the wi took o in the vessels
[1:12:12] with the lamps while the bridegroom
[1:12:15] tared watch that word
[1:12:17] t they all slumbered and
[1:12:20] slept so as far as we concerned always
[1:12:22] positive bre yeah we slumbering we
[1:12:24] sleeping we are lamp we are
[1:12:26] oil at
[1:12:28] midnight there was a cry
[1:12:31] made behold the bradom coming go you out
[1:12:35] to meet him then all the virgins arose
[1:12:39] trim their lamps so they had
[1:12:42] oil but they didn't
[1:12:44] have extra oil they were content with
[1:12:48] what they have they were content with
[1:12:50] their minister with the Revelation with
[1:12:53] the interpretation with the
[1:12:55] understanding they were content with
[1:12:57] what he explained them
[1:13:00] away he explain them away from the Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost so they had the word the word more
[1:13:07] word on to of word word on top of word
[1:13:11] and no Spirit to light of that word no
[1:13:13] water for the word he said
[1:13:16] Rebecca she had watered the camel and
[1:13:19] the same camel she water is what took
[1:13:21] her to Isaac and he said you water the
[1:13:23] cam water the word by your
[1:13:25] Praises so every dumb church and every
[1:13:28] church with Satan sitting down on on top
[1:13:30] the lip but can't praise and worship God
[1:13:32] you know what happening there Revelation
[1:13:36] material material there material have
[1:13:39] oil in it have spirit in it have Worship
[1:13:43] in it have atmosphere with it all those
[1:13:47] version last and the foolish said unto
[1:13:49] wise give us of your oil for our Lambs
[1:13:53] are going out the Greek says our lamps
[1:13:56] are going
[1:13:57] out what a terrible thing to
[1:14:01] know that what you have you have it's
[1:14:04] not that they have nothing in they any
[1:14:07] message they have the books they have
[1:14:09] the tapes they have Revelation they
[1:14:12] understand the trumpets and the V and
[1:14:13] the words lots of mysteries oh my God
[1:14:15] they could explain that to the
[1:14:17] pope but the oil running out you're
[1:14:20] watching your oil running out and the
[1:14:23] bridegroom not there yet you can't go
[1:14:25] out and meet the bridegroom because it
[1:14:27] going
[1:14:29] out but the wise answer not
[1:14:33] so I could see a fool say
[1:14:36] kindness wrong time said that 5 years
[1:14:41] ago the wife said not so least they're
[1:14:44] not enough for us and you I would like
[1:14:48] to give you but what I have here I had
[1:14:51] to make sure this take me through amen
[1:14:53] go rather to them that
[1:14:56] sell and buy for
[1:14:59] yourselves while they went to buy they
[1:15:03] understood then in the message that a
[1:15:07] price had to be
[1:15:09] paid to break
[1:15:12] through into the Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost they were willing now to pay the
[1:15:17] price it's just it wasn't
[1:15:21] available Brown one time the last drop
[1:15:25] in the bucket will be
[1:15:27] finished there be no more Holy Ghost so
[1:15:30] I hope this still you
[1:15:33] tonight I hope there still your desire
[1:15:35] tonight yes sir for God to fill you with
[1:15:39] his
[1:15:40] Spirit while they went to BU the
[1:15:43] bridegroom came and did that were ready
[1:15:46] shout out
[1:15:47] ready ready that's what the message come
[1:15:49] to do not get us churchy get us ready
[1:15:53] they that were ready went in with him to
[1:15:55] the marriage and the door was
[1:15:59] shut afterwards came the other virgin
[1:16:02] saying Lord open to us and he answered
[1:16:05] said I know you
[1:16:09] not but
[1:16:11] brandom the first thing you know the
[1:16:13] time will come when God will give a
[1:16:16] message and you'll be sealed in or out
[1:16:19] of the kingdom of God that's right we
[1:16:22] need the oldfashioned gospel back in the
[1:16:25] church back to the word of God and a lot
[1:16:28] of this nonsense and foolishness cut
[1:16:31] off he said it a lot of the nonsense and
[1:16:35] foolishness cut off a seal of God is a
[1:16:38] sign of completion that's right that's
[1:16:40] when they put on the seal when the thing
[1:16:42] is completed you stamp it and you seal
[1:16:44] it you approve it a sign is completion
[1:16:47] isn't that right and you talk about the
[1:16:48] box car when the inspector comes he
[1:16:50] looks in to see if everything is tight
[1:16:53] or he won't seal it you got to tear it
[1:16:55] down and do it over again and that is
[1:16:57] what God has been doing with his church
[1:16:58] for a long time you load up you're going
[1:17:01] to heaven you're taking everything with
[1:17:03] you your card games everything you can
[1:17:05] load into the church you're trying to
[1:17:06] take it with you god condemns it you
[1:17:09] ain't ready for sealing so you have to
[1:17:12] be ready for sealing he said but when a
[1:17:15] God sees a man contrite broken Spirit
[1:17:18] sincere in heart D at the altar God
[1:17:22] closes the door the world to him and
[1:17:24] seals him in dear by the baptism of the
[1:17:27] Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus come
[1:17:30] not from one Revival to another but
[1:17:33] until the day of your Redemption could
[1:17:35] the church say Amen could the believer
[1:17:37] say Amen so the Seal of God is the
[1:17:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30
[1:17:43] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:17:45] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:17:47] your Redemption without the Holy Spirit
[1:17:49] you are not sealed let me say it again
[1:17:51] without the Holy Spirit you are not
[1:17:53] sealed but the holy spirit is God sealed
[1:17:56] Oh Glory to God Hall the holy spirit is
[1:17:59] God's sealed Oh Glory what's the Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:18:04] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:18:06] isn't that right seven perfect Spirits
[1:18:09] oh the Lord I shout and the bride will
[1:18:11] be sealed by those seven spirits seven
[1:18:14] births Oh Glory to God Seven births
[1:18:17] Hallelujah sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:20] hallelujah hallelujah the Seal of God is
[1:18:22] the birth right the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:25] Ghost that's what Jacob fought for he
[1:18:27] wanted that Birthright isn't that right
[1:18:29] that's why God say I love Jacob because
[1:18:30] he want the birth right it was the Holy
[1:18:32] Ghost brother brand the mark of the
[1:18:34] beast is on today and the Seal of God is
[1:18:36] the Holy Spirit to reject it is the mark
[1:18:38] of the beast in the message whoever who
[1:18:41] sees the holy ghost that you are
[1:18:43] supposed to receive and don't do it
[1:18:45] automatically you take the mark of the
[1:18:47] beast because there are only two classes
[1:18:49] that exist all that didn't have the seed
[1:18:51] of God had the mark of the beast so to
[1:18:53] receive the seed of God is to receive
[1:18:55] the Holy Ghost to reject it is to take
[1:18:58] the mark of the beast praise God he said
[1:19:02] we ended off last night in Ezekiel the
[1:19:04] 9th chapter how many read it he said he
[1:19:06] seen six men come from the higher gate
[1:19:09] and they had slaughtering weapons
[1:19:10] remember did you notice it was
[1:19:12] designated only to Jerusalem but watch
[1:19:14] because God deal with the Gentiles as
[1:19:16] individuals now we find out before the
[1:19:19] slaughter went forth listen now don't
[1:19:20] miss this before the slaughter Slaughter
[1:19:23] when fought that word is used in the
[1:19:24] Bible
[1:19:27] Slaughter but the BR said millions will
[1:19:31] die
[1:19:32] Millions he seen a man come with dress
[1:19:34] for in white what does white represent
[1:19:37] righteousness of saints now a writer
[1:19:40] incor by his side he went through the
[1:19:42] city first Jerusalem set a seal upon
[1:19:44] those who s and cry for the Abomination
[1:19:46] and then the city that's right you Bible
[1:19:47] readers and then when the slaughter went
[1:19:50] forth he said don't spare old young
[1:19:52] children Bab babies whatever it is
[1:19:54] utterly destroy everything that doesn't
[1:19:56] have this Mark was nothing left they
[1:19:58] either received the seal or they did not
[1:20:00] have the seal and that's the reason this
[1:20:02] day we coming in we are coming right to
[1:20:04] it in a minute here in the New Testament
[1:20:06] the seed of God is the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:08] outside of that is for the slaughter
[1:20:10] amen did you hear that he said we come
[1:20:14] into that into the New Testament and the
[1:20:17] seed of God is the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:19] outside of that is the slaughter want to
[1:20:22] read Ezekiel 9 now he called this is
[1:20:25] Ezekiel 9 he cried also in my ear with
[1:20:27] the Lord voice read on Sunday cause them
[1:20:29] that have a charge over the city to draw
[1:20:31] near every man with his TR weapon in his
[1:20:33] hand and behold six men came from the
[1:20:36] way of the higher gate which Li towards
[1:20:37] the North and every man a slau a weapon
[1:20:39] in his hand and one man among them was
[1:20:41] clothed with linen with a writers incor
[1:20:44] by his side and they went in and Stood
[1:20:46] Beside the briis alar my Lord my Lord
[1:20:49] there's not a pastor there's not a
[1:20:51] brother there's not an elder this is a
[1:20:53] man with the ink horn isn't that right
[1:20:56] watch and the glory of the god of Israel
[1:20:58] was G up from the Cherub where upon he
[1:21:00] was to the treas of the house and he
[1:21:02] called to the mantle with linen which
[1:21:04] had the righteous inor inside and the
[1:21:05] Lord said unto him go through the midst
[1:21:07] of the city through the midst of
[1:21:09] Jerusalem and set a m so let's say this
[1:21:11] way go in the message
[1:21:13] amen go through every Church in Trinidad
[1:21:16] every church around the world go to
[1:21:18] Every
[1:21:21] pastor
[1:21:23] and set a mark upon the forest of the
[1:21:25] men
[1:21:26] that s and cry for all the
[1:21:29] Abomination that turn in the midst
[1:21:32] thereof until the others he said in M
[1:21:34] air go ye after him seal comes first
[1:21:40] Slaughter after seal come first judgment
[1:21:46] after the true gets anointed first and
[1:21:49] the false get anointed
[1:21:51] after go have a clear distinction of the
[1:21:54] bright from the
[1:21:57] church go you after into the City and
[1:21:59] smite let not your eyes spear neither
[1:22:03] have you P so this is a destruction
[1:22:06] angel angel come to W through God tell
[1:22:10] the angel do my pity here who to
[1:22:13] slay and I hope this bring a burden here
[1:22:16] tonight and those who would hear it
[1:22:20] those in this church here who are
[1:22:21] slackers we talking about slack
[1:22:23] parenting poor parenting no bden
[1:22:26] whatsoever the children get away with
[1:22:27] murder all kind of
[1:22:29] crap slay utterly old and
[1:22:32] young old people in it young people in
[1:22:36] it both maids and little children little
[1:22:41] children and wom everybody covered old
[1:22:47] grandma grandpa children little children
[1:22:51] so what that means
[1:22:53] that us parents have to have a burden
[1:22:56] for them because little children can't
[1:23:00] apply it to themselves the parents have
[1:23:03] to be the token for them to get the Seal
[1:23:06] of God upon them and burden for them to
[1:23:09] get that
[1:23:11] Mark I hope everybody in the church will
[1:23:15] say Amen to that
[1:23:17] amen then they begin at the ancient men
[1:23:20] which were before the house because
[1:23:23] judgment
[1:23:24] begins in the house of God but when you
[1:23:27] see the Abomination making desolation
[1:23:29] stand in a holy
[1:23:30] place after the coming of Titus after
[1:23:33] Jesus had left the Holy Spirit was the
[1:23:35] man with the incor at his side so
[1:23:37] identify who that is the holy spirit was
[1:23:41] that man with the incor at his side and
[1:23:45] he went to Jerusalem and set a mark upon
[1:23:47] the people now I want you to notice
[1:23:49] something church member and you CL clim
[1:23:52] to have the Holy Spirit he said don't
[1:23:56] seal any of them but them that s and cry
[1:24:01] for the Abomination down the city in
[1:24:04] other words don't seal the
[1:24:06] filthy don't seal the unrighteous don't
[1:24:09] seal the ungodly don't seal the liar
[1:24:12] don't seal the disrespectful don't seal
[1:24:15] the unsanctified don't seal the
[1:24:17] sodomites don't seal the backbiters
[1:24:20] don't seal the haters in the message
[1:24:22] don't seal the bullet sisters don't seal
[1:24:25] them they that don't listen to their
[1:24:26] husband don't seal
[1:24:31] them is this the
[1:24:35] word don't
[1:24:38] seal butam now where is anybody so
[1:24:42] burdened about the world now and their
[1:24:45] condition well I'm a Methodist I'm a
[1:24:47] Baptist I'm a presbyterian so what
[1:24:48] difference does it make I'm many
[1:24:50] message my pass so I go to this church
[1:24:54] what difference you have this
[1:24:57] seal is this real or
[1:25:00] not that's why any church that think
[1:25:02] that they are it is Liars The People
[1:25:05] deceive they the bride here right where
[1:25:07] stre and Believers there what you
[1:25:08] talking
[1:25:09] about Pastor
[1:25:12] cuckoo he under delusion in his head he
[1:25:15] is deceived and he de the people with it
[1:25:17] to like if they are
[1:25:20] special I a special group in that where

[1:32:42] shall know the truth and the truth is
[1:32:44] what going to set you
[1:32:46] free so I want to encourage you get a
[1:32:49] love for truth don't want a love what
[1:32:52] you want to hear as a confirmation to
[1:32:54] your lust or your Idols in your heart
[1:32:56] that's what we read on Sunday God say I
[1:32:59] will answer them by their Idols in their
[1:33:02] heart there some people come and they
[1:33:04] have certain things in their heart and
[1:33:05] the minister say that a confirmation to
[1:33:06] inside their heart I know a brother say

[1:33:33] Vindication because dream about the
[1:33:34] violence and I'm preach the vience and
[1:33:36] you confirmation because you about the
[1:33:39] vience I remember years ago a man say
[1:33:42] going preach on v i i myself
[1:33:46] I
[1:33:49] let he sent to confirm this of God God
[1:33:51] he will have a son his wife was pregnant
[1:33:56] when he talk about that V I fly the
[1:33:58] church you know he had he had a
[1:34:03] daughter but at that time as a as a
[1:34:06] young believer I just wasn't prepared

[1:34:11] vials to me I just feel he was going and

[1:34:28] receive not the love of the truth that
[1:34:31] they might be saved for this cause God
[1:34:34] shall send them a strong delusion that
[1:34:37] why they say God say show them and God
[1:34:39] show them and God show them and they ly
[1:34:41] on God they they see an
[1:34:43] illusion and they believe that they
[1:34:45] should believe a lie and that they might
[1:34:47] be damned who believe not the truth but
[1:34:49] had pleasure in unrighteousness because
[1:34:51] because you cannot believe the devil lie
[1:34:54] unless they reject God's truth God has
[1:34:56] present the truth first and you have to
[1:34:58] reject truth to receive a li all right
[1:35:01] let me just close up
[1:35:06] here each Church age is describe of its
[1:35:09] spiritual condition talk about the
[1:35:10] church ages each Church age can hold
[1:35:13] behold Itself by its scriptural and
[1:35:16] spiritual speaking to them as the spirit
[1:35:18] speaks each age can behold itself each
[1:35:21] age bore the True Vine of
[1:35:25] Christ I never saw this one before this
[1:35:28] particular each age bore the True Vine
[1:35:32] of Christ the wise
[1:35:34] virgin each age bore the grafted Vine
[1:35:38] the foolish virgin so the foolish virgin
[1:35:41] is grafted in to the same
[1:35:43] Vine oh give the Lord some
[1:35:46] Praises I'll close this question here
[1:35:48] brother brandham question are the five
[1:35:50] foolish versions of of Matthew 25
[1:35:52] counted as a gentile Remnant I
[1:35:54] understand that the fivefold virgins
[1:35:55] were saved but have to go through the
[1:35:57] Great Tribulation period is this correct
[1:35:59] if so what will be their final
[1:36:02] destination could they be the Sheep
[1:36:04] which are divided from the goats in
[1:36:06] Matthew 2533 224 pretty good toosan but
[1:36:09] R says the sleeping virgin is the
[1:36:12] remnant spoke of in Revelation of the
[1:36:13] woman seed that keep the Commandments of
[1:36:16] God have the testimony of Jesus Christ a
[1:36:18] woman will take a piece of goods lay it
[1:36:19] down what has she cut in takes her
[1:36:22] pattern and lays it wherever she desires
[1:36:24] which way she going to cut that and then
[1:36:27] what she has left over is called The
[1:36:29] Remnant and she chooses to cut it from a
[1:36:32] certain place by her own free thinking
[1:36:35] what is left over is called The Remnant
[1:36:37] now if you notice there were five
[1:36:38] foolish five wise virgins all of them
[1:36:40] virgins made out of the same material
[1:36:42] but by election that's why you can
[1:36:45] Rejoice tonight God chooses bride by
[1:36:49] election before the foundation of the
[1:36:51] world put the names on the lamb Book of
[1:36:53] Life slay before the F of the world
[1:36:55] before the world ever began God in his
[1:36:56] mind being
[1:36:58] infinite so then the foolish virgins
[1:37:01] begin to play something was the one who
[1:37:04] did not have oil in their lamps that I
[1:37:08] believe that was cast into outer
[1:37:10] Darkness where there'll be weeping and
[1:37:11] willing nashing of teeth and if you
[1:37:13] compare that with your footnotes it will
[1:37:15] run right back to the Great
[1:37:17] Tribulation I think they are the ones
[1:37:19] who stays back and goes through the
[1:37:20] Great Tribulation
[1:37:21] yes so
[1:37:23] friends in the message you will see them
[1:37:26] come and said give me some of that oil
[1:37:31] you would lift to see that people
[1:37:33] actually asking for the oil yes but
[1:37:36] guess what the spirit is the
[1:37:40] word and the word is the spirit so you
