this morning it's a different time is a different season and it would have been perfect if we could have been together here in fellowship in the house of the Lord but as we see prophecy unfolding and the signs of the times and these things we are forced to make adjustments we are forced and and an interruption has come into our lives that has forced a different order of things so right where you are in your homes wherever you are if it's in an office wherever you may be this morning I challenge you to forget everything else wherever you are right now we are declaring it to be holy ground and we want to bow our heads in a word of prayers a body of believers can we pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord that we could come together Lord in a different kind of a way but we are still together United in faith and united under the blood and united as sons and daughters in this great season that we lived in that does not come as a surprise to us because we have been training for this day we have been preparing for this day all these years of hearing the message of your great prophet and Lord messenger brother Branham we stand here sons and daughters of God Lord both here in Trinidad and Lord all over the world Lord we're sons and daughters are gathered at different times in different ways as Lord we seek to be ready for your soon coming Lord this whole situation as it were came upon us all of a sudden Lord and before we could even realize the magnitude of it order of the world has changed Travel has changed work situations have changed the way we do church has change the way we meet and interact with family has changed and it will never be the same again because Lord you are putting things in order for the coming of the Lord and lord I want to challenge your people from everywhere to see the spiritual happenings that are taking place that Lord at what's happening in the spiritual realm is being reflected in the natural realm in the economic realm in the ecclesiastical realm in the Lord every facet of the world is being Lord touched Lord by the divine plan of God to do things a certain way Lord many of it will be beyond our understanding but through your word Lord you have taught us how to prepare Lord I pray that you would bless the service today that Lord you will touch your people that you would touch your sons and daughters father Lord those that need an extra touch those that need an extra encouragement there are those that are wondering about their jobs and wondering about their lives and wondering about their situations law but as the psalmist even said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging comfort in knowing that you are more than able to take care of your children Lord as we find ourselves under the law the message of the hour we take comfort in knowing that we know what's unfolding before us and we come this morning law to be reminded in a simple way that we can Lord and this Sunday morning law we don't know where next we'll be able to come together we don't know Lord but we know who holds tomorrow and we know that you're in charge of everything and you are in control of everything so Lord we come here this morning Lord just a handful of brothers just handle everything that we could do this live stream service may you be with your people Lord anyone that is sick and in need of a touch in their bodies father many healing virtue me the angel of the Lord walk into the room where they a medium feel the presence the August presence of Shekinah glory walk into the room where they are me you touch them from the crown of their head to the soles of their feet father those that need a touching their mind Lord people are being fed all this information every day this is happening this is happening this is how many people have the virus this is happening and it gets overwhelming may you lift him up beyond the beyond the situation Lord to look up for redemption Troy and I load me you touch Lord our pastor this morning before he comes to minister this morning father to bring a word to the church and those under this ministry and Lord our friends and associates around the world who choose to be connected in some way love me you are knowing what he says Lord may you speak through him in a special way this morning and may you be with your people Lord and father we want to remember the Coleman family in a special way Lord that you will continue to come for them touch them be with them father Lord it's no doubt Oh Lord a very hard situation but we know heaven is rejoicing but Lord those that are on this side Lord we need a touch from you so may you minister to the Coleman family lomi you touch her brother pop well Lord who had that situation Lord or God with the accident Lord and we thank you for preserving him below me you heal him completely may you move through the church let me you move through your body of believers around the world Lord if they can just catch a hold of feet so what is being said this morning and know that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord your your power is beyond time is beyond distance it's beyond being in one physical location and you are more enabled this morning to minister to the heirs of salvation lomi you bless the reading of the word and bless the speaking of it we ask in a precious name of Jesus Christ and the believers say Amen honey men any men I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles just before I say a few comments before we're over comes to speak this morning I just want to read from one portion of scripture from first Thessalonians 5 first Thessalonians 5 and from verse 1 first Thessalonians 5 and verse 1 but at the times and seasons brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but he brethren and not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are the children of light and the churun of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not anointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also he do be the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word if you're standing in your home's you may be seated there's no one standing here in the church so it's quite a time that we are living in so I greet you once again in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know it's interesting for the last few months I in closing out many of the services I've been seeing that one of these days we'll have the last service we never really knew how that would unfold and we didn't know that this is the situation there's no way at the beginning of this year 2020 that we would see this is the situation that we're in that we have to speak through technology to be able to address the church but this is this is it and what we have been speaking about for all these years and what the Prophet spoke about for all these years so quickly we see that in different ways different things have changed people who love to be call it outside as it were love to be doing whatever they want to do in in meeting people and doing these things suddenly there's an interruption that no matter what plan you had in life you are forced to adjust the adjustment was not a willing adjustment it was an adjustment that was forced upon you because it became an issue of life and death we have countries governments leaders here in Trinidad and Tobago our own prime minister call for National Day of Prayer and people are trying to connect to that the Pope is calling for prayer different governments are calling for prayer and sometimes it seems that if it was only true crisis people want to turn to God and in the midst of all of this we are being challenged to get ready to leave here suddenly people have time on their hands being forced if it's to stay at home forced and we now have new words and phrases that we never knew about social distancing self-isolation these things never existed before in common language as it were or normal language but here it is it's something that every day is is into us stay in your home don't go outside because if you go outside you don't know what's gonna happen to you if you go outside you don't know what you're gonna meet if you go outside you don't know if you're gonna catch this virus and as all of this is unfolding I'm looking at the spiritual side of it because in that day in Egypt when the death angel was about to pass you have to stay in the house with the token applied on your doorpost and you could not go outside if you wanted to you had to stay inside to stay under the token and I was looking as it unfolded and as airports begin to close and as planes began to come down from the end and now airports are parking lots for planes people can fly where they want to go business meetings are canceled conferences are canceled companies have to close because what they offer is no longer needed we now use languages as essential services and non-essential services and people ask themselves the question is what I do essential or not essential but yet in the midst of all of that God is doing something because as everything unfolds he who knows the future and he holds tomorrow he understands what has to happen and what is happening as Paul said in the scripture we read I have no need to bring to your consciousness what has taken place because you should know this thing because this was prophesied by a prophet and was written through the world all these years of a time that would come when they will close down the churches when you can't buy or sell unless you take the mark on you can't do what you want a new system a new world order and all these things are performing the foundation of it former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown I believe said we need one government in the world because in trying to enforce the quarantine and the isolations not all countries are moving as he should and if we had a one-world government we would have more structure more system will be able to more effectively deal with this everything that has to unfold needs a trigger needs a spot Dawid what happens next right now there are people who are from this country Trinidad and Tobago who cannot come home because our airports are closed they are pleading from different countries bring us home and our Prime Minister says no we cannot open the door because we have to keep it closed to keep the country quarantined in their minds have a right or reason or in their hearts to see where we deserve to be here but he says no the door is closed you cannot come in that's man shutting the door what a time we're living in when man makes a decision that we're not gonna open the airport we're not gonna fly a plane we're never because safety and peace is what we trying to create and I think back to the days of Noah it wasn't Noah who shut the door but it was God who shut the door doors that were outside could not come in those that were inside could not go out these are all shadows and all examples of of what's about to be greater because even though we cannot meet physically this morning you can still hear what I'm saying but a brand I'm spoke of a time when we won't even be able to speak we won't even be able to explain what's happening we won't be even able to tell you what's about to take place can the church say man will come to an end and end of the systems of this world and enter the way things operate can the church say man so I just want to take a quick thought and we've been having some technical challenges with the internet and if you tracking it in different countries governments are asking the companies that handle the streaming and things to put controls on the internet because everybody's at home watching something everybody's at home looking at something and the reality is we have time if I can say that on our hands and we have to make a choice with what we do this is a season when being a Christian is not based on who is looking at you it's based on you looking at yourself and looking at the word because there's nobody around there's no gathering of people to to hold you accountable to what you did and what you see I'm not the preacher this morning but I want to encourage you this morning before the minister comes to the pulpit that this is a season that is different and we don't know how long it's gonna last but we want to be ready when he comes I preach a message some time ago positionally placed before the terrible plague strike and that's a quote from the Prophet when he spoke about we are to strive to be positionally placed before the terrible plague strike and if this is something then I believe in my heart there's more to come this is just a first wave of more to come because demons are working on every hand and with a random and a message demonology religious realm he said and today my dear Christian friend demons are working on every hand and God's Spirit moving right out on the other hand to corrupt to counteract it every single time and it's a foreshadow of the great showdown that's coming pretty soon between God and the devil but abandom Christ I'll get on go outside and be right in your heart but the Randleman adapter he said we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us and we should be so sweet and so pleasant and so kind so christ-like in our lives but over in the prayer meeting on Friday night you were saying don't spend all your time watching movies now you have time any hands what are you doing with your time in the natural realm jobs that existed before this may not exist after this so young people what are you doing are you just gonna sit down home and say when I'm home if you've never spent time on your knees before this is the time to spend on your knees as you have never done before take the time and stay at home and in the self isolation to look into the world and see the examples that God had set before us that we could take strength from the heart of the diligent and from the way that we ought to be a sons and daughters time such as these all of what is happening reminds me of the story of Noah and if I could take a thought it's get into Christ the Ark of safety just for a few minutes that's what I want to speak on before bird overcomes get into Christ the Ark of safety and in Genesis we know the story of Noah man had fallen from his position the man that God had placed on the earth was not where God had set him up to be he had fallen and fallen and fallen until God was moved to do something about it home life was not what it was nothing was that it wasn't God was push to do something about it he was pushed to intervene father's fallen from their position mother's fallen from their position now what's the excuse now it wasn't hard to go to work so I couldn't have family prayer I had to go to the grocery souk I couldn't know what I want to do but now that we were all locked into our homes and at midnight tonight we have nowhere to go unless it's critical what's your Excuse the time to travel to work that time is now your time the time to meet somebody that time is now your time the time to gather with friends that time is now your time and we have a choice a space of grace as it were to make sure that your calling and your election is sure and only a few will take the opportunity as it were because even though Noah preached for year upon a year that judgment was coming and people heard the cry they did not take action they did not respond I wonder out of this situation how many people will respond I wonder how many people would have to see more of this before the cry goes in their heart that they must have the Holy Ghost that they cannot depend on their knowledge of the message they cannot depend on the knowledge of the Bible without the Holy Ghost you are lost you are finished it was said and you hear these viruses respect politicians this viruses in respect aegis viruses in respect country this viruses in respect immigration laws this virus has respect customs laws this viral Pharaohs can move from country to country it can move from family to family it can move from house to house and in the same way this virus is contagious it's the same way the forces of demon are also contagious moving from father to son moving from brother to brother evil spirits and the same way we are being challenged to quarantine ourselves and self isolate from this Corona of Harris is the same way I challenge you to make your house a safe zone to make your family a safe zone by applying the blood by putting a token upon your life put in the token above your family shame on you if you haven't had a family altar shame on you if you haven't come together and begin to cry say Lord we need you more than ever before come to church say man we need more we need more we need more and we having some technical challenges but we'll upload the service when it's over you make sure on watch that you make sure and share it you make sure one play it play it today play tomorrow instead of Netflix and YouTube and do it all these other things you get onto the channel and you watch the services catch up on what you missed make every day a service day for you we have been locked in and this is not strange on the day of Pentecost leading up to the Pentecost they hadn't locked themselves in the room because I didn't want to interact with the world the pilot said they were afraid they had locked himself up but you have prayer of fear but they were in there crying out for something and then all of a sudden the Bible says no Holy Ghost fell upon them on the day of Pentecost could it be that in the same season all of a sudden the Holy Ghost could drop down into your home all of a sudden the Holy Ghost can trap down you to your family all sudden the holy ghost overnight up he couldn't move the same way this virus has moved overnight it's the same way we tryna start another kind of contagious effector of the same holy lows could fall upon the Apostles you could fall upon the Christians can the church say man hallelujah every attack that attacked Isis is a force that's moving it's a force that we cannot see the US president says we are war and we are fighting an invisible enemy this is not new terminology we have been at war and we are fighting an invisible enemy but we are not ignorant of Satan's devices so we are very careful we are looking to see how he's moving so that not only can we defend but we could also attack and I say we need to be on the offensive this morning not to in crazy think what are your ffensive and prayer the offensive evaporation because the time is at hand I'm getting ready to close out are you in the Ark of safety God has allowed us to be called aside call aside from groups call aside from doctrine and the way we do things to us being in our homes as it will call aside from our understanding of the message to confronting the reality of how will I eat next month or two months if I lose my job it requires not a dependence on the pasta but the dependence on God it requires not only dependence on government because soon the government will run out of money can the church here ma'am and it will force us back to the gold standard all these things are not foreign to us it has been prophesied and so shall it be fear not little flock it is my father's goodwill it's his pleasure it's his desire to give us a kingdom and I say this morning the kingdom of the Lord is at hand it's right there every day we are getting closer to the rapture because call will not allow yes bright oh go on she's gonna be raised up that's what the rapture is for hallelujah where the Brandon preached it the death angel wasn't asking what trial are you in that that angel wasn't asking what church you go to the Death Angel wasn't asking who your pasta is the Death Angel was just looking for the token and in this first wave of attack that we are seeing and there'll be more to come only their tokens only their token only their token if there's one prayer you have in your heart let it be for the token apply it upon your home apply it on your life apply it on your daily walk you have to work from home apply the token Oh hallelujah God has given you a space of grace you know when you got in a job all that's happening in the workplace God has allowed you to bribe to be pull aside now you can take lunch I know buddies deal with you somebody help me this morning I don't have a group here to give me back but you give back response when you at your home Oh hallelujah the gossip that takes place on a lunchtime in your workplace that can't affect you right now you could take your lunch time and you can tarry with Jesus come on now come on now young people I remember young people asking questions how do you deal with the music and the maxi when you're traveling home from work and you're traveling home from school and the distractions in the mall and all these things what happens when these things don't affect you anymore there's no more to go - there's no maxi to take there's no taxi to take oh I'm preaching myself this morning I don't need people in the church to have to preacher it's in the inside of me the world is coming to an end are you ready to get out of here are you ready God has cut the ties cut the attachments cut away the friends from you it's time to connect to Jesus it's time to connect to God it's time to connect to the sauce because he can feed you when the cross he has no food he can make away when there seems to be no way and he is to the Great Physician he is still the best doctor that the world has ever seen hallelujah you have to forgive me but I can't stop I can't stop trust in God I can't stop serving God I can't stop praising God I want to know that I know that I'm in the Ark of safety I don't want to take it for granted God has brought us face to face with the reality that is not about a group it's about the individual it's a reality that you could be in your house and ready to do what you want to do you choose to do what God wants you to do that's the real Christian hallelujah hallelujah what will you do friends what will you do with this grace what will you do with this opportunity what will you do it this time because I believe we don't know what I believe that this situation will also pass but there'll come a time when the situation will not pass because God promised a judge this world and he said it but Abraham said even God doesn't judge this world he'll have to go tEEX fundament Amaro and raise it up again and apologize for them but the court I serve as a see me yesterday today and forever and the same reason he judged Sodom and Gomorrah is the same reason you touch this world now the develops an America rejected God and country is not just America every country have heard people who have no relationship with God putting a post about praying and putting a post but God help us and heal our nation and heal our land and the next post is their drinking next pose they're trying to drown their sorrows because God is yes this talisman for them this this this thing you cry to and every problem and hope things work out but what is happening now is unprecedented in history because every situation Scimitar is in the past did not the technology we have now to make us conscious of the gravity of what's unfolding before us knowledge has increased sounds familiar that's the Bible and in the age when knowledge has increased riches have increased and in a this Laodicean age I have need of nothing now whether you're rich or poor you have to isolate yourself I saw some drone footage of different parts of the world where there's nobody on the street where you have money or you don't have money you cannot go outside on the street because somehow no matter what people have achieved they value their lives more than going out to get money they value their lives more than and then there are those who who are just simply I don't even know how to describe them foolish foolish because they air all the announcements they see all the cases of death being spoken about around the world and yet still they don't want to take the right action so it doesn't surprise me when people come to church for years and they don't take the right action when we tell them get into the Ark of safety and they still want to go out and do something else politics is not important I took my wife a few days ago I said I do want to see the news anymore because it doesn't help the situation it's just more information more noise it's more distraction not that I don't have sympathy or empathy or concern or desire but the reality is when you're locked in your house what can you do but pray when you're locked in your house what can you do but seek the Lord for you and your house is just what cried out as for me and my house we will serve the Lord as a musician began a play I just wanted to greet the church and share something with you because after tonight at midnight at least for the next two weeks we are more restricted and we were before so we don't know we'll use the technology to stream and different things but I pray that you will take this time to get called a sight of God it is not God's desire that this is how we operate in this kind of a way because he wants us together even as they approaches and we know that the end is not yet because he said this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come but we are closing on to the final chapters of this book so when we get to come back out we have to push more than we ever push before we are required to do more than we ever done before to keep your job in this economy you need to do more II ever did before because the demands of change the requirements of change people are realizing that what they thought was important was not important oh god help us draw me nearer Jesus draw me nearer I spent a bow a heart somewhere has one more time as I pray before the passing is ready to come up I don't know how many are hearing me right now I don't know how many are connected and if it will be the team that you will listen to but whatever you're doing right now I want you to stop stop the distraction this is not the time to cook and watch your service clean and watch the service that's not it half Church let it be Church in your house let it be Church in your life take away every other distraction bow your heads close your eyes this is you and God the same presence Jesus to the end from the Centurion and he spoke and that Centurion knew that we're servant was that the presence of God had a veil himself and done something that he got us at what time that cigar we serve [Music] may his presence move through your room right now may his presence move into your home right now every head bowed every eye closed Heavenly Father we come this morning as a people trying to do what you said to do and still be in compliance with the law of the land rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's Lord law said no more than 10 people and Lord we wish we could have had every one but we have to have a musician somebody behind the camera somebody behind the streaming somebody behind a song service and Lord we had to choose just a handful of brothers Lord be able to have this service that Lord we can fulfill at the same time being in your house but at the same time being in fellowship with our brothers and sisters in their homes that we could still be one church one group of people Lord connected by blood connected by predestination and law we don't take this for granted Lord their time is Lord in the past when we should have been in church and we didn't make it important so we miss church and now Lord we can't even be in church we don't know how long it's gonna last but father we repent Lord I'm not doing all that we can do and take him for granted lower the opportunity to be together in fellowship we many of us took it for granted law we won't do that no more we can't afford to do that no more because Lord we want to be ready we want to Lord be with the people who are being on the other side Lord Lord the world is just distractions it's just trying to pull us this way and that way but Lord you give us grace that we could look up Lord to a Redemption Lord I pray you visit every father Lord

sons of God and you have not received the spirit again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him Oh glory to God that we may also be glorified together so in other words he has a portion of suffering that God has guaranteed to work with his people hallelujah and then pullman Tennessee for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the

be here we are happy to be here this morning and I'll read something from what but Isaac referred to from the British former Prime Minister Gordon Brown you spoke that this is on Thursday 26th a one-world government needed to cope with kovat 19 seized former British prime minister a former British prime minister has called for the creation of a global government to cope with the corner of the corona virus pandemic Gordon Brown who was both prime minister and leaders of Britain's left-wing Labour Party from 2007 until 2010 told the British media that the world government he proposed would address the medical and financial crisis caused by kovat 19 it will direct efforts to find a vaccine for the virus organises production and purchase and stop profit ears it will also direct the response of central banks protecting emerging world markets and agree a joint approach to use of government spending to boost growth The Guardian reported that bran would have liked the United Nations Security Council to have been invited to an emergency online meeting of the g20 countries today the meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia is tackling the issue of the north novel coronavirus oh my this this is words this is not something that can be dealt with in one country Bronk said there has to be a coordinated global response so you see how it's being set up now that is a need to get this super leader to get this world government that will cover a thority over the entire world Oh hallelujah doing the worldwide financial crisis of 2008 then Prime Minister Brown convinced the other global leaders of the need to bail out the banks then he hosted a g20 countries at a summit in London which came up with a one point one trillion rescue package contemplating the emergent financial crisis Brown believes that there should be advocacy for the emerging world markets within the g20 countries through this purple grocer task force we need some sort of work in eggs give if I were doing it again I would make the g20 a broader organization because in the current circumstance you need to listen to the countries that are most affected the countries that are making a number of people to be affected such as those in Africa he said also that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund need as the garden preference and increased it a financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis impact of low and middle income countries oh my so what has been proposed here is a world government to deal with pandemic and the economics the conditions that we are seeing around us now is confirming what this 20th century prophet said this is a preview of the press right now right now all of a sudden almost overnight around the world churches have to be pushed aside everything shut up this is a preview you know this reminds me of when jesus told his disciples when you see Jerusalem compassed the wrong with armies flee to the mountain Oh glory to God and when they came and surrounded Jerusalem they couldn't go out but something had to happen Oh glory they've got to pull it the Army's back and then the guy had to go back because they had a new emperor back in Rome or wherever and when the armies pull back the true believers fly out Oh glory to God that took that as a rehearsal they took that as a sign because jesus said when you see Jerusalem compassed with armies get out idea or glory to God but you saw what's around already armies but they remember Jesus words and as soon as the army pullback it give a little interest to get out of the air all glory and here we are because in a preview it is live this is not a rehearsal this is live a live preview of things that are to be or Chloe got caught and it wouldn't be a national thing you know it would be an international thing every law will be enforced and if they go to enforce their laws we have lost also that God is going to enforce because the Holy Ghost is here enforce the laws of God or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah praise call so we understand now by prophecy the churches will be closed down we understand the reason why there will be a force in he said national force put Israel in the

food from each other we drop barriers we separate ourselves seemingly not having a feet here is bad but then when we leave those principles of doctrine if we move on to perfection then those little things become of not much use here is Bom we go into a relationship maybe ceases that statement is super super super that is off the charts you know they say me I'm a Baptist we could have about this doctrine I'm a Methodist I'm at his doctrine I am sexy you know see half seal I'm a pre and press either way call time and who playing tape in the church yes we just press on play I'm a press on play

La Silla little appetizer distillery flavor distilleries Torah please still away later he's still a conqueror he's still over comma so then when they come to doctrine when you move on to perfection those little things become much use we go into relationship and we find out the only way that we can be perfected is to be in Christ and we find out in by the teachings of the Bible and how we get into Christ not by water baptism not by laying on hands not by teaching yeah people being taught and taught until the big thought right of the Spirit not by playing tips you get them to Christ you still hear any word to give your feet to get into Christ Fiat coming here in the world you could hear tips hello you hear fall off and you could speak back only tips literally it's giving your feet to get into Christ the object is to get into Christ the object is the captain for the Holy Ghost the object is that get into the token real is again we find on him by the teachings of the Bible and how he gets into Christ not by water baptism not by little hands not by teaching but by one spirit we all baptized into one body and become perfected she is suffering that's a big one no there's a there's a next door let's go inside idea perfect head through his sufferings he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised or does you only really like it come out God he was stripped he was beaten he was bleeding but I the only way the reefs could come out he was caught ship diamond that the light could reflect seven colors or chlorine a coterie team you and I hallelujah to break seven seals seven stages of redemption or glory to God holiday spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption oh my it's Munna to change he said I scripture relation to nine I know thy works at I tribulation and poverty but thou art rich I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan the key to this age is most evidently tribulation if there was revelation and the first age has not predicted an intensified tribulation surely second age there is no doubt here we go that what the following words of Paul applied to the mass of Christians wherever they were in the world and in every age now the Lord Almighty say I know there is walking in the mists of his people there is the chief Shepherd of the flock does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people occasionally one that if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watching his people suffer that is what they ask in Malachi 1 1 2 3 the burden of the world would have the law to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet we see where it has thousands of this was not Esau Jacob's brother see it the Lord yet I love Jacob and he said he saw and laid his mountains and his heritage we's fat dragon you see here we go they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen on the salvation because God had chosen the salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did poor he may commit you to suffering as the job that is his prerogative here his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with the purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would not he would be the author of frustration and not peace his purpose is here we go that after we have suffered a where we would be made perfect be established and wrinkled and settled so after all this all this drama OVA or the church had to be stronger not meat not more backsliders my people giving up but that should be established not to be perfect but to be established like all glory their gods open to this morning all glory hallelujah hallelujah but what I said to him then he would be the author of frustration on a piece his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established Trenton and settled as job said he put strengthen us you see he Christ Himself suffered and he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered now I know this is not the kind of girls or people like the water had a blessing and they want to hear riches from the wicked and keep it to the poor and like listen I'm serious and calm I bless you and multiply you and after you but you see power after do the character and character have to do it suffering not mysteries I am Empress already and I hear not that at all the most no Calvary no and I swore until I look for assuming you know when they see at a day with me here at this and that and that and that and that it may be ceases you know the challenge of people is the process Gordon in Genesis say he said my people shall soon a strange land I would a mighty and I'll bring them out he kept the end game but he didn't identify the process he said the serpent ruinous he pushed his head with his heel and he didn't say I'll identify the process through Abraham actually generation of Jesus Christ God God God there's always a process you want to get seven subjects you wanna pass an exam there's a process you know walking school on ball - I claim it in Jesus name you better study in Jesus name - I'm doing homework in Jesus name and boil your lessons in Jesus name and then he will pass in Jesus name Oh glory to God is the process see one young woman she she's Mick McCready corner us and she tells me she a boy when she gets she come on with it unless young man say vkd gate here on spring break by the beach with a bunch of them and game afterward he repented because his foolishness you not seeing the news you're not listening people are dying you're not understanding what it's a plane your idiot but people miss very descriptive for you for merchants after nine and the fifth angel sounded I saw a star from heaven for South fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke ordered a bit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and they came out of the smoke locusts upon it unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the earth have power it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green tea so this is not natural Lucas they could not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads and today I was given that they should not kill should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months have a time do you know five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it strike at a man thy spear you know that is pain torment for five months and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and get some flee from them there's a piece of torture in pain and you can die you're in pain and you're waiting your wish to die to get all that pain or glory of God on the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepare for battle or the heads were crowns like gold their faces were like faces of men and they had here a woman the teeth was a teeth of a lion they had breastplates as were the brass bit of iron the sum of the wings was the song of shouts of many horses running the battle and in their tears like unto scorpions there were stings in their tails and their powers to hurt men five months and the other king over them which is the angel of bottomless pit so when people talk about angel dies why we has acts we want to know where he injured come from people talking about they have in Zelda meet angel stop the engine because this angel come from a bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the Greek tongue had a name apollyon one always fast and behold become pure hafter and a sixth angel song that I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are pong in the great river Euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men so boy this is only the beginning hallelujah and the number of the army horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard a number in there I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire of jacent and brimstone and the heads of the horses was has a lion order their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone and by pees tree was I was by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire by the smoke by the brimstone which issued on the mount for their power is in the amount and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and their heads and which to hate but this is the Parowan I get to depart and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of their works of the hands that's what we deliver it now men see in it seeing the destruction scene and the still would repent the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of the hands that the shipment worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood neither which neither can see nor hear near the repented they of their murders nor their sorceries nor the fornications know of their tests just as them demons can change the bride of who she is the bride can change them their people you can change that is how they are oh my oh so Jesus he learned obedience by the things which he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered and Hebrews 5:8 9 says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and peered made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation under all that will be him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that day - by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection question why would he want this James 1:2 the for my brethren compt it all joy you see everything is back to the world back to the scriptures Compton all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that a China of your faith look at patients but that patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanted nothing why does he stand by the reason is Roman 1718 it Shirin then heirs heirs of God and joint Israel Christ if so we suffer with him that we may be glorified together if I reckon of the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which I be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign you have to suffer terrain terrain is the rule the conquer to overcome Taupo don't worry adoption no glory to God sons of God been restored into a position of power to reign with him to rule with him you have to suffer with him do you believe that the reason for this is there's a reason for that but you always suffer to suffer Oh God God God want you to suffer bad no it's not that the reason for this is correct simply is never made without suffering that's why parents sometimes buy the best for their children by this pious do this and it's here and still do the one thing and misbehave and be if terrible because we believe that if we help them and bless them and what are you gonna work out we don't want them good and good to pain you don't want them go to issues and challenges and you see because you suffer in your life you're given them a break and what it doesn't work notice Gordon give none a son don't break him every son that commits record straight because if God don't do that you have a bunch of spoiled children yet discipline or discipline Joshua dissipated Moses everybody come under the rod of God hallelujah so what the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering practice of victory not a gift a man without character can reign because power apart from character is satanic but power wit character is fit to rule let's get them think it not strange that the fiery trials are to try you that's what Peter said it is a stranger is it is it strange that God wants to develop a christ-like character that comes true suffering does it have so many people like to argue on the beat because there's no life there so the strength is what they know and the knowledge that they have but what God warns is a character life watch and God warns us develop a christ-like character that come to suffering but and we all have trials we all try to chase the sons but not not one goes through the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God for Hebrews 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth and if you read or chastisement then your bastard sons oh my now you see why I read in Smyrna and tribulation here's why here's why I read that this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no it's free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of God this is the will of God and it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we have to suffer and be christ-like and doing it not fight like not Not Bombs I like we had to fight back on the other make exclusive not defending like Christ like above it love suffer it long and this kind o charity suffereth long and is kind not in cus nothing carrying on hallelujah scripture Matthew 5 blessed are ye when men revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is a reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets which were before you the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God is approval neither are the bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he has for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for a process to himself give us of his spirit placed on us as sons and now how shall I prove my love they evolved oh how you prove yes how I prove it now by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy and mr. Giles that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass oh my hallelujah tighter in church age he said I know your faith he says no he does not say here as he did to the church you hold my feet he is not talking about his feet now he is commending them for their faithfulness as he goes he also mentioned their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact peace is the outcome of faithfulness it seasons in James one tree the Train of your feet look at patience there's absolutely no way in which the game patience it has to come by the trial of your feet and Romans 5:3 tribulation does work patience Google God isn't that descriptions the trying of your faith with patience hallelujah emulation in his word patience hallelujah your patient stablish another word mapped hallelujah hallelujah let alone some money revelation at the work that or glory that was of this change of perspective as a Christian you walk and talk this happened that happened it happens stuff happens is what you do now what happens well glory to God you can stop what I owe you but you could handle hope you actor watch what happen around you will give the Lord a shout in the house or glory the chord you often know Romans 8:24 we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them what he called equality purpose I don't feel like preaching Oh hallelujah hallelujah stuff happens it's not what happens it's how you react to what what happens or glory to God amen amen amen how highly God regardless of working of our patience is seen in James 1 for let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection could we give a shout on that God want you to be perfect not to be miserable not to be surviving not to be really making it he wanted to be perfect or glory to God hallelujah boys will first is perfection and that perfection is patience and then he explained what is waiting on God and waitin for God this is the process of character development oh I'm finished with that you know so look at that waiting on God are waiting for God so in the time of uncertainty that is where Trust come in the or Trust is only applicable when things are uncertain when you can't have the answers when you don't know the way and you're unsure that is where a release a trust to God because he knows the only Road he has the overview I know the end from the beginning you had down here seen is that the road level but he is higher than you call like a helicopter he seein down the corner around there two months three months six months you can see down he knows already and he know it gonna work for you but you hear biting your fingernails you hear all tense all worked up and God has not worked up because you
