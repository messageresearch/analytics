hallelujah hallelujah amen an amen with such an atmosphere you are going to rob me the opportunity of greeting the church you just had me feeling like you should go straight to preaching but bear with me by God's grace to be seated [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord thank God for the atmosphere [Applause] atmosphere is created for us Amen to receive the word and continue worship by the grace of the Lord amen so God bless you this morning the associate ministers the officers and the congregation amen thank God to be with you this morning amen I bring greetings from Bethlehem Tabernacle amen I could distinctly remember the good old days when we did not have technology there were two brothers from here but a barrier Terry we used to use the name interchangeably who is Barry and who is dairy but in the 80s they would be back in the church with us week after week to collect tapes Amen to make sure the people are fed so we have a long Association by the grace of almighty God Amen my first visited here but you had invited me to join in a prayer line when he was out on convention amen and more recently you have had me on many occasions bringing greetings amen and the meetings outside by the grace of the Lord amen amen your familiar faces here that I know very well but as Steve has been a very helpful young man a blessed young man assist us in a realm of music for a long while amen and I'm here with my immediate family my wife and three of my four children my last son is out at work on a rig but he is ably represented here with by his wife so I am totally represented by God's grace I did invite sister elizabad to be with us because I know she's a part of this fellowship and it's certainly appreciate she and her husband being with us by God's grace I have a young associate with me brother UL amen he made me recognize some time ago I'm an old man I hear why I mean maybe people that you already experience before but I sat down the church here and then preach and I said wait I dedicated that baby I baptized that baby I know I have to sit down and listen to that baby please so I am getting an old man amen amen so he is here by the grace of the Lord with some sins dear to him I cannot explain who they are but one of the scenes who dear to him used to be my nurse in tutor many many moons ago so I happened to be another 55 years ago so I could tell you how long ago she was my tutor but I certainly appreciate you being here with us by the grace of the Lord amen amen so let us go to the world maybe I'll Stand Genesis chapter 1 Romans 8 29. Genesis chapter 1 verses 26 and 27. let us read together just two verses of scripture and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he male and female he created them Romans 8 29 amen and amen and amen for whom he did for new he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren may the Lord God bless his precious words to our hearts amen you may be seated I see what God's Prophet once said he said that I ministers never preach a message yet they they take notes they write down things but as the Holy Spirit by inspiration that preaches the message so so we pray God that the Blessed Holy Ghost amen will bless our hearts amen so I'm reminded as God's Prophet said you know you take care when you come before God's people say because if I have a drop of the literal blood of Jesus in a charger how I take care of that how much more you the purchase of the blood God helped me this morning I would like to identify a taught by God's grace the unveiling of God's masterpiece better yet when will God Masterpiece be unveiled when when will God's Masterpiece be unveiled amen we start with this thought that when a Sculptor going to produce a work that is in his mind he has a work in his mind and when he's going to start to produce that work the Sculptor covers the work this this work means nothing to the other people it means something to him you coming along my work the sculptor's work will confuse me it's like The Boatman who said I had to throw it ate both in in a rubber ship because everybody want to come and tell me how to build a boat but the sculptor covers his word his word wrong he has a vision of what he is going to he has something in his mind so he hides the work you don't expose it he masked the work he put on a mask on what he is doing amen because he he who have something in his mind it is in his his mind and he has something he wants to achieve Hallelujah so he now keeps this piece of work covered amen he covers the mask whatever he's doing he don't want nobody get involved with it he don't want nobody to interrupt him you don't want nobody to him come on Church division is his vision the vision is not somebody's Vision his speechland is his vision so because it is his vision anybody else will interrupt it is not a cup it is not a collective Vision it is this Vision so he is working on his vision Hallelujah to The Outsider it would look like nonsense hallelujah it's a nonsense to them some mad manafulla trying to do something in a bad day that's to The Outsider man it don't look like very much and even the outsider get a peep even if you get a peep it confused so it is hidden from him so this sculptor going to go through a period of distress he's going to go through sorrow you're going to go through sweat he going to be confronted with critics maybe even from his own family but he's going to go through critics amen but he's going to stay with his vision you can God is a personal revelation it's a personal Vision you know this is not a collective work this is a personal work blessed be the name of the Lord Glory so sculptor is going to stay with this Vision until his vision is complete hallelujah amen amen so he's going to cover the work until the time come to take off the coverage until the time come to unveil until that time you cannot see what he's doing you cannot grasp what he is doing glory to God amen so when does culture's work is complete amen he unveils the work he takes off the Veil it is a time that he will going to expose what he is doing to the onlooker the onlooker have a time they have to wait their time they have to wait in the background amen until the time comes for the onlooker it's a church this morning the day will arrive amen his work got to be unveiled the day will arrive when the curtain will be taken off the day will arrive when there be an unveiling when there will be an uncovery church this morning I hope you're seeing ahead I hope you know what we're talking about I hope you have an idea where we going in this morning blessed be the name of the Lord so the day will arrive when the cloth will be taken off to expose what he was doing dear is what I am this is my product this is what I was doing the day come that he is going to identify amen amen is going to be exposed the day come when it's going to be revealed what is behind of you [Applause] a lot of people only see in the Veil but they don't know what behind of you you are available [Applause] but what is behind that Veil glory to God Amen and amen so the question this morning is when will God's masterpieces be unveiled when will God's Masterpiece do you believe you are a God's Masterpiece do you believe that he's what you are one of his masterpiece when when this morning will God's Masterpiece be unveiled when his work will be unveiled when will it be exposed to the onlookers when will the curtain be taken off amen so this is where we're going to be this morning the Lord help us when you talk about sculpting to outcome on the money called Michelle Angelo great sculptor amen and it is said of him when he was an infant he was nursed by a sculptor's wife so as he and he got breast milk from a sculptor's wife implying sculpting was really in his blood grew up in a sculptural shop amen it is also said of him he never marry his wife was that art of sculpting amen so Mr Angelo want to sculpt Moses there was no picture of Moses nobody know how Moses looked like and he was going to work on this vision of making a skunk of Moses amen and amen and it took him a great part of his life it taken many years to produce Moses Hallelujah Mitchell Angelo had no picture but he had inspiration yard inspiration hallelujah what Moses look like so he did not have a picture but he had a picture in his mind you had a picture in his mind what Moses looked like so yeah after yeah he worked on the image of Moses that was his his vision is that image of Moses and one day one day Vision was no longer Vision one day Vision was no longer Vision one day Finland became reality glory to God Larry so Vision then became reality amen and this Vision looks so real this thing looked like it had life in it the pattern Looks So Perfect it looked like this thing had feelings whatsoever he brought forth his work drilled him he was thrilled with that production of Glory to God Amen come on church is God producing you thank you is God walking on you is God doing something with you get the picture this morning glory to God Hallelujah so Michelangelo got beside himself it was not easy for him to take he got beside himself glory to God Amen and amen he got beside himself and he take a Harmony he said that is not that that not make believe and that thing her life Hector doesn't speak he was so taken up with what he produced he wanted to bring Linda blessed be the name of the Lord Glory Glory Glory but remember we want to check the pattern the pattern is Michelle Angelo had something in his mind it's tatted with something in his mind it started with a vision glory to God and the vision is to create the image of Moses that's what he wanted he want to create the image of Moses he come on church he he had displayed it before he created he got to create the image of Moses he got to have that image for us and when he have the image then he's going to display and that image was so good to him it wasn't an image you get them he was so thrilled that the image became a person he thought the image at life so that is the road he could that's why you know in search of a perfect man God's Prophet tells us derelicts ministers as well as a lady right you can't reflect Jesus or you can't serve the Lord without Force reflecting him you have to first have a reflection of him amen so Michelle Angelo amen but we want to talk about the greatest culture amen Michelangelo is an illustration to us but we want to look to the greatest sculptor Hallelujah the one that's called Eternal things and this great sculptor he had in his mind what he wanted what he wanted is a man in his own image like what you want that is what he wants Glory [Applause] a Man In His Image glory to God for the great sculptor Oh Glory to God he made creeping things amen he made fishes he made buds he made animals and finally he came to perfection he came to a man that reflected himself Hallelujah glory to God here it is the Mighty God achieved a man in his own image Hallelujah but we know this man was by himself so God took the masterpiece I made him a helmet out of the Masterpiece he made a helmet God struck the Masterpiece Hallelujah and Adam had himself a wife and then God take his Masterpiece to the split you see you don't have a masterpiece and hide it you don't hide your Masterpiece so God is ready now to display God displaying his work of art God is plain his work of heart glory to God so he found a great place a wonderful place to place his Masterpiece a beautiful place there cannot be a more beautiful place he placed it in the Garden of Eden amen and there we have God and His Masterpiece having Fellowship Hallelujah now this man we know had Dominion yeah dominion over the Earth he was the god of the earth hallelujah hallelujah so the Earth was man's Dominion amen everything will be a man Hallelujah man that bless our God Amen even for all man do you know every animal afraid you as well as running as we just run we frightened but even for all man amen hallelujah they have that thing in them that you man is the ruler man is a Dominion amen so here it is God made man amen the Lesser God and give him Dominion made in the image of God Amen so what we've seen again God image before you get Dominion you have to have image image confirm [Music] image come fast and then comes Dominion glory to God now here we know that the Masterpiece of God was mad there was a marine of God's Masterpiece A Hallelujah that man that came from the dust of the earth he fell amen that man who was in the image of the Beast that man fell and the great culture don't stop okay [Music] [Applause] come on Church isn't he still working on you is he didn't work with you Hallelujah [Applause] so that great Sculptor in his Masterpiece mod the great sculptor seeing the fall of his family Hallelujah he's started to work immediately on man a man in his own image God rebuilding his Masterpiece Hallelujah [Applause] God reveal him God working on that Masterpiece oh God walking on another man God walking on another man [Applause] and God was working on Noah God working on him God working on him again that more end up to be a drunk but boy didn't give up God I give up God continue his work God had a David he's working on this game he's working on this day baby yeah amen woman ruin him but God continue working God had a Moses god walking on Moses everything went good but Moses after a while take the glory for himself he's not to glorify himself and here again amen God going to work God never defeated God never give it up God working by the grace of the Lord Larry Larry this morning glory this morning [Applause] then then came our Lord then came our Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] and came the perfect reflection of the world then came the one that there's no fault in him no fault in this one oh glory to God hallelujah then came the one who always do that that pleases the father is that your aim this morning is that your aim this morning is that your desire this morning I I is that for you is that for me it's not for us is that over that the testimony to have is nothing of our church we are talking about Masterpiece we are talking about unveiling his Masterpiece his Masterpiece got to have a testimony I always do that which pleases the father Glory [Applause] [Music] what a testimony this morning what a testimony this morning I always do that I always that is what we are living in the REM Church that's our vision our vision is to keep the word our vision is to live the word do all that please at the father that's why we repent that is why we're making we don't wait for the preacher don't bring conviction to us we get convicted when we're going wrong we repent because our desire come on Church our desire is going to please the brother next to you please this sister next to you oh please the church no our desire is to please the master [Applause] we are not looking upon who looking at us the master is looking at us we cover our church we are his work we are his work this is his work this morning this is not going to your work this is our green work this is his work how about the time we get up to a position to recognize our relationship is with him our Union is with him we thank God for pastors we thank God for church but recognize you have a relationship with him [Applause] Oh Glory [Applause] Hallelujah Glory so God was so pleased with his masterpiece that God identified himself in that body Glory when the Lord said I and my father are one we are one God has identified a body that do always what yeah we have again a perfect reflection of God Amen the first Masterpiece Adam he was placed behind the wood but this masterpiece is doing glory to God this one is the word Oh Glory to God Amen this is the perfect one the perfect one our masterpiece that weed in perfect could be made perfect Hallelujah so God in the beginning he smote Adam to give us naive Hallelujah we thank God the smoothing of Christ was to present present a bride and that Bride is a part of Christ we are part of Christ that is why we must be the world as we come from the world if our birth is our world birth we come from the word Hallelujah so we must be the one Hallelujah clear Church the Masterpiece was struck and the stroking of that masterpiece please present us with many masterpieces many masterpieces by the grace of the Lord so the second Eve judge the bride yes was created a new at Pentecost and just as Eve fell on the word the second Eve fell at night see a room accepting dogmas and Creeds is dead of the word of God and then came a Martin Luther glory to God with a message the just shall live by faith hallelujah what it was going on Church the great sculptor going back to his world the great sculptor is at his work he is working again [Applause] amen and after the death of Luther we see amen they made a denomination and then God gave us a whistling yeah man with another truth to reflect him in that second work of Grace sanctification so Wesley did what luta did they did all the same thing then we see God pick up a colored one-eyed man pouring out the restoration of gifts amen all a part of the work of God Amen and amen then came the Fulfillment of the world Dan came already quote number one [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] now if that child then did not obey what and was not about the father's business God will raise him another son and that's what he done Through the Ages God raised up Luther Hallelujah raising up methodists raising a Pentecost Pilgrim Holiness reason of Pentecost he will keep on raising raising and raising amen and amen until he gets one he's not going to stop the work is not going to stop God going to continue his raisin until he gets one glory to God hallelujah I hope to live to see that church she when she rises in the power and the beauty of the Resurrection so God's Prophet identified to us God is going to continue the resin until the time he get that church when she she rises in the power and the beauty of the Resurrection with the power of God walking through her signs and wonders following the Believers like it did in the New Testament Oh Glory to God glory to God hallelujah God continue in his work how about church he is still working on me he is still working on you not working on what in his mind the image to see his image by the grace of the Lord amen and amen so the world continue from Luther to Wesley to Pentecost amen and amen through the restoration of the gifts and here comes the time for the Fulfillment of the word the scriptures for today a Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. the world continuing until we have a message that will bring back the original it'll bring we have the message now Wesley did not have that Luther did not have that Pentecost did not have that no they did not have it Glory Luther asked amen about justification but he did not know what justification meant he did not have the full revelation of justification it is today we learned that justification is as if you never did it on you the devil cannot put a scar on you the devil cannot bring that to you no we now know we now know we now know what it is to be a Justified person there was a mysterious part there was a mysterious Sparkle justification glory to God Luther did not have it Luther did not know what it is Glory Hallelujah glory to God today we get to know what justification means it is like you never did it it is like you never did it [Applause] oh brother you may have Cuts in your hand you may have scars in your hand it reminds you of something yeah I think that you have done in your life a gun in your heart it will remind you of something but somebody tell me tell me I can't understand that it is not fine to understand it is a mystery it's a mystery of our church it is not you that's not you it was that the real you that's not the real you the real you is a part of God the real you is a part of God Lord lift me up and let me stand is the word to give you a correct picture you have to have a correct vision you know you have to have a correct vision you've got to have the vision you've got to know what's the correct vision in the head otherwise the devil will tell me what I did what I did and everybody could tell me what I did but God said you didn't do it and that's not you that this you was not you the real you is your Gene you read you is your deed glory to God thank God we could enjoy Christ in this perverted body that is why Greta is he that is in you than in this world Oh Glory to God glory to God come on come on Church we got to recognize something this morning we got to recognize something this morning the light of what God has done for us what God is doing for us through his word amen is not for carnal people it is what a spiritual believer it is what a genuine daughter God the genuine Son of God somebody could take the word of God and pain the tongue red that is carnality but with us this morning we will say I love him too much I love it too much to Break My Vow I love it too much what a takeaway brought me from when I take away lift me up from oh I love him too much I love him too much this morning [Applause] I like to tell the local church we pastors could be fooled the church could be fooled I could fool my wife I got full my family but I can't fool God I can't fool God there's a people that's the difference is our people who in this plan of God they don't have a desire to do wrong I've never said they wouldn't do wrong come on Church come on Church which one of you could discern my desire there's a relationship between you and God know who he's talking about God know that individual well no I will sleep I will fall you will slip you will fall but God know if you have a desire God God is judging you by what you see or what I see God is judging you by what he see all right bless the Lord this morning [Applause] Glory so I will save your state identified Luther had justification Wesley brought with us sanctification amen and his sanctification had hold your way of closing how to wear your dress and and Etc but today we get to realize real sanctification amen amen real sanctification sin is unbelief sin is not whole dress sin is not necessarily what you do sin is unbelief if your belief is going to put off there's power in believing there is power is believing what
