[13:30] pray you will come down in a special way
[13:32] speak to the parents the mothers the
[13:34] fathers the brothers and sisters the
[13:36] husband the wives and God before there
[13:38] was church there was family
[13:40] and you are interested in the family
[13:42] you're interested in our homes you're
[13:44] interested in whole things operates law
[13:47] because you wanted man to be such as an
[13:50] example son and Jesus because of the
[13:53] Fall he came as that second Adam and
[13:56] became this example seed Sons as example
[14:00] seed son and in his last days you will
[14:04] have some more example seed Sons make us
[14:07] two examples true testimonies of Christ
[14:10] May that word so live in us that it
[14:13] shall reflect what your Savannah Prophet
[14:15] said all we need tones of live voice
[14:17] walking around the world the day world
[14:19] of blemish and sweetness and in Holiness
[14:22] and Purity bless your word tonight in
[14:24] Jesus amen and amen God bless you and
[14:28] since welcome it's good to have you all
[14:30] tonight and uh to me it's always a
[14:33] privilege and a blessing and even though
[14:35] uh we may not express
[14:39] um tiredness and awareness we do get
[14:41] where we we do get tired we consider it
[14:44] a great privilege to minister to you and
[14:49] share the world with you tonight I have
[14:51] something special I'd like to share so I
[14:54] have some scriptures a lot of scriptures
[14:55] to read if I hear battles with you and
[14:58] come like we do some heavy lifting that
[15:00] we could present this wood to you
[15:02] tonight
[15:03] so if you have your Bibles I'd like to
[15:05] turn with me to one scripture here at
[15:09] first Luke chapter 18.
[15:11] 9 to 14.
[15:14] Luke chapter 18
[15:16] 9 to 40. I don't think I ever use this
[15:21] scripture
[15:22] in a prayer meeting or a prayer so as
[15:24] before
[15:25] but somehow
[15:28] uh it came with me Luke chapter 18
[15:33] reading verse 9 to 14.
[15:36] and he speak this Parable unto Satan
[15:39] which trusted in themselves that they
[15:42] were righteous and despise others
[15:45] this is Jesus speaking now two men went
[15:48] up into the temple to pray
[15:50] one of heresy
[15:53] and the other are publican
[15:55] the Pharisees student prayed us with
[15:58] himself
[15:59] gone
[16:01] I thank thee that I am not as other men
[16:04] are
[16:05] extortioners
[16:07] unjust
[16:09] adulterers or even as this public
[16:13] I fast twice in the week
[16:15] I give tights of all that I process
[16:19] and the publican
[16:21] standing affairs
[16:23] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[16:25] under him
[16:27] but smoothies rest upon his breast
[16:30] seeing God
[16:33] be merciful to me
[16:35] Asylum
[16:36] I tell you
[16:37] this man
[16:40] went down to his house
[16:42] justify
[16:45] rather than the other
[16:47] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[16:50] be a beast
[16:51] and he that humbles himself
[16:54] shall be exalted may God bless the
[16:56] spirit
[17:00] tonight I have a word
[17:04] five letters Pride
[17:06] that would call Pride
[17:10] I don't know how to explain it
[17:12] but somehow
[17:15] this has been right in me for the past
[17:17] you know two days
[17:19] try and goet before full
[17:22] and
[17:24] the way I begin to see it I
[17:28] if I guess I never saw it that way you
[17:30] know you see people backslide people get
[17:33] into all kind of issues and challenges
[17:34] and you want to know how that comes
[17:37] about
[17:38] but Pride truly goes
[17:42] before a fall
[17:44] and I want to
[17:46] look at pride in a certain way tonight
[17:49] trust that your help they refine and
[17:52] assist you in your Christian work and
[17:55] assist you particularly in praying in
[17:57] your prayer life
[17:59] what is pride
[18:01] of dictionary meaning other resources
[18:03] pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or
[18:07] satisfaction
[18:09] derived from one's own achievements
[18:13] the achievement of those with whom one
[18:15] is socially associated
[18:17] or from qualities or possessions that
[18:19] are widely admired
[18:21] that's Pride
[18:23] the prophet said pride is such a
[18:25] Christian so awful pride is evil
[18:29] and that probably going before a fall
[18:31] really comes from Proverbs 16 18 and 19.
[18:35] pride
[18:36] going Before Destruction
[18:39] and a haughty spirit
[18:41] before
[18:43] so when you see the needle of one's life
[18:48] and and most of the times we come from
[18:52] nothing we come from low estate we come
[18:54] from like sinner level then and God
[18:56] bring us and bless us and whatnot and
[18:58] afterwards people sometimes trip they
[19:00] get tip over with money with finances
[19:02] with buildings houses lands cars
[19:04] whatever
[19:05] and they begin to feel a sense of
[19:07] superiority
[19:09] and a haughty spirit before better it is
[19:13] to be of an humble spirit with a lowly
[19:15] than to divide the spoil with the probe
[19:20] well the Bible speaks here in verse 18.
[19:22] of a haughty Spirit what is this 40
[19:27] and citizen is out it says blatantly and
[19:30] distinctly proud
[19:32] having
[19:33] or showing an attitude of superiority
[19:36] and contempt for people or things
[19:41] perceived to be
[19:42] inferior
[19:45] so a haughty person acts Superior
[19:48] look down on others
[19:50] 40 people are disdainful
[19:53] prideful
[19:55] obnoxious
[19:58] and they are unfriendly and they
[20:01] consider better than other people
[20:03] so now you're getting a closer picture
[20:06] of how this man could pray that we I am
[20:08] not like that public idea
[20:12] the adjective of proud produce feeling
[20:15] pleasure of satisfaction
[20:17] over something regarded as highly
[20:19] honorable or creditable to oneself
[20:23] having proceeding form
[20:26] or showing a high opinion
[20:29] of One's Own dignity importance or
[20:33] security
[20:35] Pride leads to ruin and don't fall
[20:39] and those who are arrogant
[20:42] will face God's judgment
[20:45] James 4 6.
[20:48] but he gave it more grace
[20:50] wherefore he said God
[20:53] resisted the proud
[20:56] but give Grace unto the humble
[20:58] and this scripture here
[21:01] struck me a certain way
[21:03] now here it is
[21:05] a person in their pride in their Holy
[21:08] Spirit they're praying
[21:09] I want to say praying they are uttering
[21:12] words
[21:14] but it's not true prayer
[21:16] because God actually
[21:19] resists the proud
[21:22] so I don't know
[21:24] Pride can't really pray that
[21:26] I'll see it that way
[21:28] approach Spirit cannot really pray
[21:32] Philippians 2
[21:34] you could write it down if you want
[21:37] three and four says let nothing be done
[21:41] through strife and or gain Glory but in
[21:44] loneliness of mind
[21:46] Let each esteem other
[21:50] better than themselves
[21:53] look not every man on his own things but
[21:56] every man also the things of others
[21:59] that any Amplified sale do nothing from
[22:02] factional motives through contentious
[22:05] Strife
[22:07] selfishness or for unworthy enemies or
[22:10] trumped by conceit or empty arrogance
[22:13] instead
[22:15] inner the true Spirit of humility
[22:19] loneliness of Mind Let each regard the
[22:22] other as better than
[22:24] and Superior to himself
[22:27] thinking more highly of one another than
[22:31] you do of yourself miss it again
[22:33] thinking more highly of one another
[22:37] than you do of yourselves Let each of
[22:40] you esteem and look upon and be
[22:43] concerned for not merely his own
[22:45] interests
[22:47] but also each of the interests of others
[22:52] I
[22:54] some things
[22:56] can't be preached
[22:59] it has to be shared
[23:01] and some things are more caught than
[23:04] taught
[23:05] so in Sharon you could catch something
[23:10] the sin of pride is a very serious thing
[23:14] because this is a great obstacle
[23:17] for prayer for your growth
[23:21] and pride
[23:23] as one right to say is a form of
[23:25] idolatry and I see it
[23:27] where one worship oneself instead of God
[23:31] and I call it
[23:33] powered by self
[23:36] powered by you
[23:39] your thoughts
[23:41] your ideas
[23:43] what you think what you feel
[23:45] self-powered
[23:49] and because pride is what it is
[23:53] Pride doesn't give an opportunity to be
[23:57] Dependable to dependent upon God
[24:00] and that is why this is so very
[24:02] important
[24:03] I want to repeat that
[24:04] Pride
[24:06] doesn't allow one
[24:08] to be dependent upon God say for
[24:11] instance somebody who get into some
[24:13] money they get sick they see they get
[24:16] Petty doctor they don't even
[24:19] want to send in a prayer requests
[24:22] because they feel they are in charge of
[24:24] themselves they have the ability to do
[24:27] this and do that
[24:29] um they don't really need God they have
[24:30] money
[24:31] they don't really need God they have
[24:33] power and they use it until it runs out
[24:37] then oh God help me
[24:39] pride is what does not
[24:42] so let's continue
[24:44] okay
[24:46] Pride
[24:48] manifest in many ways
[24:52] in self-righteousness
[24:53] in contempt
[24:55] in Rebellion
[24:58] Pride
[24:59] is what
[25:01] make people refuse to admit one's faults
[25:06] and in Ministry we haven't talked to
[25:08] that so many times people who when they
[25:11] are brought a task or when things are
[25:14] brought to them not me
[25:16] I ain't taking blame for that I take it
[25:19] that that's just Pride on this plane
[25:22] they will not say thank you a glad you
[25:25] put out some attention I will work on it
[25:27] always an excuse
[25:29] always something different no acceptance
[25:33] for what is being pointed to them
[25:36] of their Falls or the attitude of the
[25:38] behavior no they reject that
[25:41] and
[25:43] it's like a rebellion
[25:47] the Bible
[25:50] warns about judgment how God eats Pride
[25:55] and God
[25:56] opposes the proud
[25:59] and will give FIFA to
[26:02] humble
[26:04] but pride is like a door
[26:08] that leads to other sins
[26:10] lion cheating
[26:13] hatred
[26:15] Pride
[26:17] could also blind you from
[26:19] your own sinfulness
[26:22] you know I see people years ago you meet
[26:24] Brethren the boxing
[26:27] and because they really not spoken with
[26:29] books because there have been a message
[26:31] long enough
[26:32] I have a season I've seen my soul and
[26:35] my son now come back and like if they're
[26:37] controlling
[26:39] the powers that be on the outside and
[26:41] they don't
[26:42] some of them to this day 20 years 30
[26:44] years is still out there
[26:46] all what they were talking about will
[26:48] just talk
[26:50] because no man could come in the father
[26:52] draw
[26:52] and they take quotes to keep you
[26:55] so Pride
[26:57] cause people to despise others and look
[27:00] down on others
[27:03] the cure for pride is humility
[27:06] true humility which is to realize how
[27:11] much we are dependent upon God
[27:13] now you could wake up in the morning
[27:16] don't pray starter
[27:19] go drive pick up your work
[27:22] at the Montgomery salary money buyer
[27:25] groceries eat live
[27:27] have your friends
[27:28] no you can come to church from the
[27:31] church when you want anytime you want
[27:32] you know you have to know what's going
[27:34] on
[27:35] you come and you do that religious
[27:37] activity and you can live so month after
[27:40] month year after year three years
[27:44] but when
[27:46] you're stripped
[27:48] at some point in time if you are in
[27:50] Pride mood
[27:53] you have a visitation coming I'm gonna
[27:54] read it from the scriptures you have a
[27:56] presentation coming those who are in
[27:58] Pride mode
[27:59] they have a visit coming
[28:02] God will visit you
[28:05] so this is an opportunity to rethink
[28:08] look in a mirror
[28:10] and examine your heart
[28:14] humility
[28:16] put us in a position to receive Grace
[28:20] to receive God's love
[28:23] but where did Pride come from
[28:25] another thing we know but I feel led to
[28:27] do this tonight
[28:28] I believe in my heart this is going to
[28:31] help someone there
[28:34] where did Pride come from Isaiah 14
[28:36] tells us verse 12.
[28:38] and God was addressing Lucifer how adult
[28:41] fallen from Heaven Lucy for Son of the
[28:43] morning or without cut down to the
[28:45] ground which just weakened the Nations
[28:47] so that was said in thine heart
[28:51] what did I know I will ascended to
[28:53] Heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[28:56] stars of God I will sit also upon the
[28:58] monk of the congregation and the size of
[29:00] the north I will Ascend above the
[29:03] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[29:05] most high yet though shall be brought
[29:08] down to Hell to the size of the pit they
[29:12] that CD shall not only look upon me and
[29:14] considerly saying is this the man that
[29:16] made it to tremble and did she kingdoms
[29:19] that make the world as the Wilderness
[29:21] and destroy the cities thereof that open
[29:24] not the house of his prisoners there are
[29:27] churches that feel that they're better
[29:29] than the others they're treated the
[29:30] field they're on top and we rest below
[29:32] are working on nonsense and pastors put
[29:35] that evil spirit upon the people I go to
[29:37] the evil and the people walk in Pride
[29:39] they walk in Pride of the church that
[29:42] they end of the pastor that they have of
[29:43] the system that they have and God has
[29:45] nothing to do with this and when you
[29:48] consider the scripture we read about
[29:50] this Pharisee and Scribe because Jesus
[29:53] the Bible says he humbled himself from
[29:56] the King obedient
[30:00] I have no reputation but he humbled
[30:04] himself and became obedient so in other
[30:07] words in order to become obedient you
[30:10] have to humble yourself I have seen
[30:12] Brethren that have been blessed others
[30:14] watch them they want the bless them but
[30:16] they don't want to follow in obedience
[30:18] they believe that in their own mind they
[30:21] can accomplish and get the blessing the
[30:24] blessing that others got by obedience
[30:26] and to get into that place of opinion
[30:29] you have to find your place of humility
[30:32] and humbling and humility and humbling
[30:35] and having a humble mind is something
[30:37] you could do something you could
[30:39] exercise something you you make an
[30:41] effort or effort
[30:45] humility humbling being respectful good
[30:48] morning good evening God bless you how
[30:51] are you and you know it doesn't cost to
[30:54] be nice it doesn't cost to be kind it
[30:56] doesn't cost to give a good word it
[30:58] doesn't cost a smile
[31:00] and there are people who don't do those
[31:02] things just to be
[31:04] or they said clear to us uh full of
[31:08] virtue full of character full of grace
[31:12] just to be like that and this to me is
[31:15] how God wants us to be so I want to
[31:17] challenge you tonight if you're not like
[31:19] that say God have mercy do like this
[31:21] Republican upset say God help me praise
[31:25] the Lord
[31:26] this is Buddha Brown
[31:28] speaking about Mary Magdalene
[31:31] Mary Magdalene she knew his power she
[31:34] knew there was something about him that
[31:36] was different from anyone else she had
[31:38] Seven Devils cast out of her everybody
[31:41] that ever been free from the Devil by
[31:44] the power of Jesus Christ knows where
[31:46] they are standing you no one can ever
[31:49] come in this great divine presence and
[31:51] ever be the same person anymore you are
[31:54] changed there is something happen to you
[31:56] you can stand off psychology imagine
[31:58] this accept this certain thing some
[32:01] theories and that but we believe in the
[32:04] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[32:06] Christ when you come into His presence
[32:08] there is something that happens in your
[32:10] life that changes you and you're never
[32:13] the same anymore a man that has ever
[32:15] been in the presence of Christ so she
[32:18] had seven Devil's caption of her
[32:21] pride and envy so he just in this
[32:25] particular court he identified two pride
[32:29] and envy and she thought she was so
[32:32] pretty
[32:33] and there was no one like her
[32:35] but when Jesus spoke and said be thou
[32:39] clean
[32:40] all that left her
[32:42] question and answers is on a quotation
[32:45] here and she's saying this and tutors of
[32:48] the earth is in sin
[32:49] and more than that which two tools of
[32:53] the Angels was kicked out
[32:55] and those demon spirits
[32:58] there we go come into people
[33:02] and habitate their body
[33:04] see what I mean
[33:06] they are demons they once existed
[33:10] and they come into the people and give
[33:13] them a nature
[33:15] and Jesus cast seven out of Mary
[33:19] Magdalene Pride boast
[33:23] unclean filthy
[33:26] vulgarity
[33:27] emulation Strife all these things so he
[33:31] identified
[33:33] all these things are spirits Pride
[33:36] unclean filthy vulgarity emulations
[33:41] Strife all these things them were
[33:46] spirits that was made back up back there
[33:50] when God began to make man off of there
[33:53] in his own image
[33:54] created those subration being those
[33:57] spirits
[33:58] so Pride
[34:00] this closet this secret closet despacito
[34:04] closet where the Lord said I'll meet you
[34:07] in dear or when you pray pray to your
[34:09] father who's eating secret Pride
[34:13] doesn't feel any need to go inside idea
[34:16] because privacy I'm fine I'm okay I
[34:20] don't need that pride is
[34:22] is busy
[34:24] pray have its plans its Ambitions Pride
[34:28] have it's it's uh what is that it has
[34:32] achieved so there's no need to pray and
[34:35] ask God and depend upon God for every
[34:37] inch of the way you want God to be dead
[34:40] no Pride don't need to do that pride is
[34:42] self-satisfied
[34:45] but if you have to get a virtual Pride
[34:47] us to die
[34:49] prayers today
[34:51] Proverbs six
[34:53] team
[34:56] we read it
[34:58] these six things that the Lord hate ye
[35:03] seven abominational to him
[35:06] proud look
[35:08] a lying tone
[35:10] hands that shed innocent blood a heart
[35:14] that devised Wicked imagination
[35:17] feet that are Swift to run into mischief
[35:20] a false witness that speaketh lies
[35:23] are needed so at Discord
[35:26] among brethren
[35:30] in the amplifier that first thing that
[35:33] was identified out of the seven
[35:35] proud look the spirit
[35:38] that makes one
[35:40] overestimate himself
[35:43] an unestimate others it goes together
[35:47] so it's not a matter of the person just
[35:48] proud
[35:50] overestimated themselves they
[35:53] underestimate others so when the man was
[35:55] talking about oh he is so righteous and
[35:57] he's not like the adulterers and not
[35:59] like the foreign
[36:07] see that is what that is about
[36:11] okay
[36:12] Proverbs 16 5.
[36:15] reads everyone
[36:18] that is proud in heart
[36:21] is an Abomination to the Lord
[36:24] though hand join in hand he shall not be
[36:29] unpunished
[36:31] the Amplified
[36:33] everyone
[36:34] proud and arrogant in heart is
[36:38] disgusting
[36:40] hateful
[36:41] and exceedingly offensive to the Lord
[36:45] be assured and I pledge it they will not
[36:49] go unpunity
[36:52] Jeremiah 9
[36:54] 23-24
[36:57] this this one's
[36:59] is very very interesting
[37:02] Jeremiah 9
[37:04] 2-24
[37:06] thus fear the lord
[37:09] so this is
[37:12] the Lord let not the wise man glory in
[37:16] his wisdom
[37:18] neither let the Mighty Man
[37:22] glory in his might
[37:24] let not the rich man
[37:27] glory in his riches
[37:30] but let him that Glory it glory in this
[37:35] that he understand it and knew at me
[37:40] and that I am the Lord
[37:42] which exercise love and kindness
[37:46] judgment and righteousness in the Earth
[37:50] for in these things I Delight
[37:53] see at the law
[38:00] the Lord
[38:02] let not
[38:04] the wise and skillful person glory and
[38:08] boast in his wisdom and skill
[38:11] let not the mighty and powerful person
[38:14] glory and boast and his strength and
[38:17] power let not the person who is Rich
[38:20] in physical gratification and will be
[38:23] wealth
[38:24] glory and boost in his listen
[38:27] temporal satisfaction
[38:30] and let's be riches
[38:32] but let him who glories glory and this
[38:36] that he understands and knows me
[38:39] personally and practically
[38:43] directly Discerning and recognizing my
[38:47] character
[38:48] that I am the Lord
[38:49] who practices love and kindness
[38:52] judgment
[38:54] and righteousness in the Earth
[38:57] for in these things I Delight says the
[39:00] Lord
[39:02] so you have to understand
[39:04] that wherever somebody is whether
[39:07] they're in power whether it enriches
[39:09] whether in government whether whether
[39:11] it's a king or prime minister or
[39:13] whatever Minister doesn't matter is God
[39:16] who allow them to be in that position
[39:19] so they can't and he said don't do it
[39:21] don't glory and here is a man
[39:24] has returned to Daniel 4.
[39:26] we want to look at a man whose heart was
[39:28] lifted up
[39:34] Daniel 4 28 is his name is
[39:38] Nebuchadnezzar verse 20 said all this
[39:40] Came Upon Kingdom Nebuchadnezzar
[39:43] at the end of 12 months
[39:46] the bill is big
[39:47] Palace and everything else at the end of
[39:49] 12 months he walked in the Palace of the
[39:51] kingdom of Babylon
[39:53] the king speak and said it's not
[39:56] discreet Babylon that I have built for
[39:59] the house of the Kingdom
[40:01] by the might of my power
[40:03] and for the honor of my Majesty
[40:08] look at the arrogance look at the pride
[40:12] look at the confidence you manage
[40:14] walking
[40:16] in this Palace
[40:18] and he is giving glory to himself
[40:22] the king speak and said this city is not
[40:25] discreet Babylon that I have built for
[40:27] the house of the Kingdom by the might of
[40:30] my power and for the glory of my Majesty
[40:33] verse 31 listen to this now while the
[40:37] word
[40:38] was in the king's mouth
[40:41] their fellow voice and they haven't seen
[40:43] O King Nebuchadnezzar today it is spoken
[40:47] the kingdom
[40:49] is departed from thee
[40:52] verse 32 and these shall Drive thee from
[40:55] Men
[40:56] and I dwell in shall be with the Beast
[40:58] of the field
[41:00] they shall make thee to eat grass as
[41:02] oxen
[41:03] and seven times shall pass over thee
[41:06] until you know
[41:08] that the most high
[41:11] Roulette in the Kingdom of men and give
[41:15] it it to whomever he will
[41:19] the same hour was the thing fulfilled
[41:22] upon Nebuchadnezzar
[41:24] he was driven from Men
[41:27] and did it grass as oxen his body was
[41:30] wet with the Jew of Heaven till his ears
[41:33] were groomed like eagles feathers and
[41:36] his knees like buried clothes
[41:38] and at the end of the days
[41:41] I Nebuchadnezzar
[41:43] lifted up mine eyes unto him
[41:46] and my understanding
[41:49] returned unto me
[41:52] and I bless the Moose High
[41:54] and I praise and honored him that liveth
[41:58] forever whose Dominion is an everlasting
[42:01] Dominion
[42:02] and his kingdom is from generation to
[42:05] generation and all the inhabitants of
[42:07] the Earth are reputed as nothing
[42:10] and he do it according to his will and
[42:13] the army of Heaven
[42:15] and among the inhabitants of the earth
[42:17] and none can stay his hand or say to him
[42:20] what was thou
[42:22] at the same time
[42:24] my reasons return unto me
[42:27] and for the glory of my kingdom my honor
[42:30] and brightness return unto me and my
[42:33] counselors and my Lord sought unto me
[42:35] and I will establishing my kingdom an
[42:38] excellent Majesty was added unto me
[42:44] an external and honor the king of Heaven
[42:48] all whose books are truth and his ways
[42:52] judgment and those that walk in Pride he
[42:55] is able to abuse or get the Lawson
[42:57] Praises tonight all this King
[43:00] fell from that high level and God
[43:04] stripped him and when he got finished
[43:07] with him and his mind came back he gave
[43:09] glory to God and he acknowledged that
[43:13] this is the king that is the real boss
[43:15] isn't that something tonight blessed be
[43:18] the name of the Lord so I trust the Lord
[43:20] will help you as you look you know
[43:22] earlier I want to talk about a
[43:24] visitation
[43:25] to the proud
[43:26] and I get that from Reading Jeremiah 50.
[43:30] 29-32 it says call together the actors
[43:32] against Babylon all leader then the bull
[43:35] Camp against it wrong about let none of
[43:37] beer will escape recompense according to
[43:40] a work according to all she had done do
[43:43] unto her for she had been proud against
[43:45] the Lord against the Holy One of Israel
[43:47] therefore shall our young men fall in
[43:49] the streets and all the men of War shall
[43:51] be cut off in that day saith Lord behold
[43:54] I am against thee who thou most proud
[43:57] said the Lord God of hosts for thy day
[43:59] is come the time
[44:02] that I will visit thee
[44:04] and the most proud shall stumble and
[44:07] fall and None Shall raise them up I will
[44:10] Kindle of fine cities
[44:12] and it shall evolve all around the
[44:15] broken so friends
[44:17] Pride
[44:19] will get a visitation
[44:21] of this season of judgment
[44:24] humility
[44:26] keeps in eyes on God
[44:29] blessed in the point spirit
[44:31] is that what Jesus said loneliness
[44:34] meekness
[44:36] so this parable
[44:37] of the Pharisee and the publican
[44:40] it's a parable of humility
[44:45] and pride
[44:46] the Pharisee
[44:48] was caught up and seen his own
[44:50] self-righteous Deeds that's why he could
[44:53] identify adultery and Sinners and
[44:55] identify all these things like that
[44:57] he could list his virtues he went to
[45:00] service he pays tithes he did this he
[45:02] did that he had a list of things he
[45:04] could identify as that he could take off
[45:09] and
[45:10] this poor publican
[45:13] just to the far off
[45:16] couldn't raise his head
[45:18] but he went away
[45:20] Justified
[45:23] Maybe
[45:25] that poor Publican didn't even make it
[45:29] inside the church
[45:30] maybe he was hearing the sermon from
[45:32] outside
[45:34] maybe that Pharisee of course he is
[45:37] regular and everything else but his
[45:39] heart is not right
[45:43] pride is prison
[45:46] Traders reason the times and same time
[45:48] you're Jesus
[45:49] what pride is doing
[45:51] and he left unjustified
[45:55] condemned
[45:57] and rejected by God
[45:59] Republicans saw no good thing in himself
[46:03] Republican
[46:05] was just saying Lord have mercy upon me
[46:08] he was donkas God be merciful to me a
[46:13] sin
[46:14] he wasn't saying that to be humble he
[46:16] was saying that because it was truth
[46:18] that is what humility does humility
[46:21] acknowledges truth
[46:24] and Jesus
[46:28] he wanted to clearly bring this Parable
[46:30] to show this story I know we say
[46:34] parables are stories that have mysteries
[46:36] in it hidden things in them and Jesus
[46:38] said I tell you that this man went down
[46:40] to his house Justified
[46:43] rather than the other
[46:47] and
[46:49] it's amazing
[46:51] that God is attracted
[46:54] to Humble Hearts
[46:56] God is attracted to humanity
[46:59] sometimes people pour and they get
[47:02] blessed and they get overwhelmed I have
[47:05] seated my own self in Ministry somebody
[47:08] get promoted Before Time
[47:10] and it reacts them
[47:12] and you'll hear it on jobs
[47:14] they are nice workers they're working
[47:16] but
[47:17] they have to get the character to go to
[47:20] the next step because if they're placed
[47:22] in a position of power they abuse that
[47:24] power they misuse the power and screw up
[47:27] the whole thing
[47:29] so pride and fix our prayers
[47:33] God
[47:35] is close to a humble heart scripture for
[47:38] that Isaiah 57 15.
[47:41] for God say it the high and lofty one
[47:45] that inhabited eternity
[47:47] whose name is Holy I dwell
[47:51] in the high and holy place
[47:53] but who but who with him also that is of
[47:58] a contrite
[47:59] on humble spirit
[48:01] to revive the spirit of the humble
[48:05] and to revive the heart
[48:08] of the contract ones
[48:10] what kind of heart do you have tonight
[48:15] Pride
[48:18] Bible said I think they're coming to God
[48:20] must believe that he is
[48:23] and he is a rewarder
[48:25] of them that presently seek it
[48:29] I believe Jesus pleased this problem
[48:32] as a powerful teaching on humility
[48:35] because I believe humility
[48:38] was part of Christ
[48:40] character
[48:42] it was a big feat of his character
[48:45] in so much
[48:46] that you couldn't could hardly
[48:50] distinguish him from the rest of the
[48:52] disciples
[48:54] I think was Judas had what they say the
[48:56] one that I kissed that's him
[48:57] he just blend in with the rest
[49:00] the Bible says
[49:02] he had no form no complaints that we
[49:04] should design
[49:06] there was nothing that made him stand
[49:08] out
[49:09] because humility doesn't try to stand
[49:12] out even though he doesn't try to be
[49:14] recognized humility not looking for
[49:17] attention
[49:19] so it was important
[49:21] that this parable of this two men went
[49:26] to pray
[49:27] and
[49:28] and how it unfolded
[49:31] because that Pharisee he he's supposed
[49:33] to know to pray he in this thing long
[49:36] time in Bible studies
[49:37] he's been trained
[49:39] he's not Pharisee and we call a
[49:41] Pharisees just half-heartedly he's
[49:44] labeled that because he come to stuff to
[49:46] qualify him to be that
[49:48] but watch something prayers are not
[49:51] uttering words we could utter words but
[49:54] that is not praying
[49:55] we're saying things to God but that is
[49:57] not praying we could be wasting time the
[50:00] Bible said in vain do they worship me
[50:02] teachings and doctrines the Commandments
[50:03] of men
[50:05] so words could be like almost like Creed
[50:07] and death like out of that promotion
[50:10] life or death words not talking to me no
[50:13] you're talking about talking to God I
[50:14] don't want you to wasting time so if we
[50:16] say let's pray and you dear and your
[50:18] pride and your arrogance and your
[50:20] attitude and you've seen in mumbling
[50:21] mumbling that words that you're mumbling
[50:24] going nowhere is still in your drawing
[50:25] room kitchen bedroom wherever you are
[50:27] hearing it tonight it's saying right
[50:29] there it's you and your own words those
[50:32] words that that Pharisee article God
[50:35] that went nowhere it didn't have no
[50:38] change in them it didn't really
[50:40] upon him it could even justify him he
[50:42] was inside the Tabernacle and that
[50:43] Pharisee was public and was outside and
[50:46] Jesus himself said the man on the
[50:47] outside went away just in life and here
[50:50] have no shake you have no specials you
[50:53] didn't have no you get whatever but he
[50:55] pronounced by God justify
[51:02] and the other one says remember me the
[51:04] other one says a lord he rebuke his
[51:08] other
[51:10] man he says we did we stop not this man
[51:13] and he said to Jesus said Lord remember
[51:16] me and those words
[51:18] Jesus response was today you shall be
[51:21] with me in Paradise man never went one
[51:23] to two to one church service never held
[51:25] the Bible never get back in Jesus name
[51:27] or never press play and listen to some
[51:29] tape he just said the right thing he had
[51:32] a heart to know you know what really
[51:34] feel this but not this year it's not
[51:37] something praise be that Jesus or give
[51:40] the Lord some praises to mine
[51:42] you know
[51:44] the Publican must have been conscious of
[51:48] his own sins
[51:49] conscious of his own failures are you
[51:51] conscious of your own arrogance wise
[51:54] with bad attitude towards your husband
[51:56] and they're not even conscious enough to
[51:58] repent of your behaving attitude you
[52:00] think you are not watching that husband
[52:02] love your wife you didn't record and
[52:03] watching that we're talking about God
[52:05] we're not talking about being in church
[52:06] and and going through a message or or
[52:09] joining an adoption or teaching you know
[52:11] what I'm talking something so beautiful
[52:13] and he said I want to point out
[52:15] something to you not on a point of
[52:18] Doctrine and he's talking about Jesus
[52:21] being invited by Simon and there was no
[52:24] foot watching flunky to watch Jesus feet
[52:26] and he sat there and Simon have all his
[52:29] rich friends all around and so on but
[52:31] they make Jesus something like a
[52:33] spectacle is he dirty and this
[52:35] prostitute woman come and begin to cry
[52:38] and and wash his feet and everything
[52:40] else and they're watching on Jesus
[52:42] saying you're talking is nothing and
[52:44] then mumbling grumbling among themselves
[52:45] if you only know what kind of one that
[52:47] is this that that
[52:49] and after a while she said Simon have a
[52:51] word for you I'm saying come in here you
[52:54] serve me terribly was terrible this
[52:57] woman whose sins are many
[52:59] no forgiven now watch Simon have sins
[53:03] but this woman a sins are forgiven she
[53:07] is doing order a service she's crying
[53:10] she's repentant she's getting it right
[53:13] oh my
[53:15] God and this have nothing to do with
[53:17] doctrines Mysteries histories and
[53:19] Revelations this have nothing to do with
[53:20] that this he says was a point in time in
[53:24] Jesus light
[53:25] this is present tense this is real this
[53:28] is not teaching anything
[53:30] this is something unfolding I'm showing
[53:33] you the contrast of when people have
[53:35] wrong objectives wrong motives and they
[53:38] have it all to get you because that's
[53:39] what they're trying to do here try this
[53:40] get it sign a fault and just stick your
[53:43] finger find a fault and point all this
[53:45] and point all that and God allow that
[53:48] woman to come to confirm this man is
[53:50] truly the Messiah is not something else
[53:53] praise the name of the Lord so humility
[53:57] comes from having a real
[54:00] low estimation of yourself
[54:03] Pharisees breed but there was no
[54:06] humility in his plan
[54:08] the Publican prayed and he prayed in
[54:12] humility
[54:13] humility
[54:16] is because we know we are little that we
[54:18] could pray that way we know we unworthy
[54:22] we could feel and we could know
[54:25] and then we could approach God
[54:28] ah about the rapper
[54:30] what about this last day Prophecy in the
[54:33] church
[54:34] the last day prophecy concerning
[54:42] this perilous time shall come for men
[54:45] shall be
[54:46] and this from this point here is church
[54:49] people
[54:50] lovers of their own selves church folks
[54:53] Covetous Church Foods boosters church
[54:57] folks proud Jewish folks blasphemers
[55:01] still in church disobedient to parents
[55:03] still going to church on thankful Unholy
[55:06] still going to church without natural
[55:08] affection they still heading to church
[55:10] true Springers false accusers
[55:12] incontinence fears despises of those
[55:15] that are God traitors heavy high-minded
[55:18] still you want to church
[55:20] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[55:22] God
[55:23] and how we look good to go to church
[55:25] with faith having a form of godliness
[55:29] for denying the power thereof
[55:31] all right
[55:33] so we come to the very end now
[55:36] are we going to pray out
[55:38] first Peter fight
[55:41] we don't have verse 5.
[55:43] and Peter's saying likewise he younger
[55:45] submit yourselves unto the Elder
[55:48] yea all of you
[55:50] be subject one to another
[55:53] and the clues
[55:55] flows it with humility
[55:57] for God
[55:59] resisted the proud
[56:01] and give it Grace and humble humble
[56:04] yourselves therefore
[56:05] under the mighty hand of God
[56:08] that he may exalt you in due time
[56:11] casting all your care upon him
[56:13] so he cared for you let's read that in
[56:16] the Amplified
[56:20] it says likewise
[56:22] you who are younger
[56:25] and of lesser rank
[56:27] be subject to the elders
[56:29] the ministers
[56:31] and spiritual Guides of the church
[56:35] given them due respect
[56:38] and yielding to their counsel I want to
[56:42] stop right on that one and yielding to
[56:45] the country I have talked to many a
[56:46] young one
[56:48] and they don't want to listen
[56:50] they don't want any Council they don't
[56:52] even want to talk
[56:54] they're going through stuff and they say
[56:55] nothing
[56:57] so why do you think there's a Ministry
[56:59] in the church
[57:00] is our parents tell each other don't
[57:02] tell don't tell Brotherhood don't tell
[57:04] the ministry don't tell you don't tell
[57:07] and they're tearing a building on the
[57:09] way to hell but don't tell don't tell
[57:12] but you see that parent or parents they
[57:14] don't care
[57:16] what they care is the control that they
[57:18] have over their children right
[57:20] the manipulative control someone in this
[57:23] helicopter parents over and over over
[57:25] and over they're married and they're
[57:27] still over nobody still they still over
[57:28] the sun they're still over their
[57:30] daughter over it not giving their own
[57:32] chance to develop and grow I know I
[57:34] always preach this sometimes I talk it
[57:35] in in marriage or services and so on
[57:38] that the job of parenting is to bring
[57:40] the child to maturity for this course
[57:43] shall a man leave his father's mother 50
[57:47] is white
[57:49] you know sometimes you hear me talk
[57:50] about all I want is jehoma Mothers
[57:53] should be in a position to teach their
[57:55] daughters
[57:56] and bring their daughters in a position
[57:58] that they could cook wash and handle a
[58:02] home down the road
[58:04] but some mothers or father help
[58:08] God have mercy what there isn't you have
[58:12] to know what the reason in your own
[58:13] house
[58:14] and if you don't know how you ask God
[58:16] because none of us born with the gift of
[58:19] child reason or or being an excellent
[58:21] father or great father a great mother
[58:23] but we have to learn along the way and
[58:25] if we don't know we ask
[58:27] let me repeat that if we don't know we
[58:29] have we ask for guidance we ask for
[58:31] leadership we ask me and we and I we
[58:33] went through what kind of stuff in
[58:35] raising our children but now we're in a
[58:37] position where we could tell people and
[58:38] give people best practice or what we
[58:40] think are better tools sometimes we talk
[58:42] about getting a toolbox I like to refer
[58:44] to that sometimes you do the best that
[58:46] you can you use the tools you have but
[58:48] there are other tools sometimes no
[58:50] modern times you go in a store and you
[58:53] see their fresh equipment that you never
[58:55] taught was even there and when you use
[58:57] it forget it it improves it shortens the
[59:00] kind of thing you have to do well in
[59:01] life there are spiritual tools they are
[59:04] marital tools they are different kind of
[59:06] tools that if you get it you say oh my
[59:08] goodness I could use it one time I was
[59:11] constantly a husband and wife and I said
[59:13] but you using a three-quarter in spanner
[59:15] to two and a half inch not it can't work
[59:17] if pushing your swim you're swinging it
[59:19] it's not working you have to get half
[59:21] inch to two and a half inch so if you
[59:24] don't have the right tool you're using
[59:25] tools you know you say trying your bag
[59:27] yes but it's not the right tools
[59:29] so let's go again
[59:31] be subject to the Elder Minister
[59:33] spiritual guys of the church given them
[59:36] due respect and yielding to their
[59:39] country
[59:41] clothed
[59:42] yourselves
[59:45] clothed apron yourself all of you
[59:48] with humility as the Garb of a servant
[59:52] so that is covering cannot possibly be
[59:55] stripped from you
[59:57] with freedom from Pride diverse humility
[59:59] is from you that you will be free from
[1:00:02] pride and arrogance towards one another
[1:00:04] for God sets himself against the proud
[1:00:08] the insulin the overbearing the
[1:00:11] disdained the presumption the boastful
[1:00:14] and he opposes
[1:00:17] frustrates
[1:00:19] and defeats them and you ask yourself
[1:00:21] the question why are so many Christians
[1:00:23] unhappy I have seen that
[1:00:27] some of them have money and The
[1:00:29] Honorable they are whole school why
[1:00:33] Pride
[1:00:36] and God is opposing them
[1:00:38] God is frustrating them and God defeats
[1:00:41] them let me read this again
[1:00:43] so okay where do we get this from
[1:00:46] it says likewise you're younger submit
[1:00:48] yourself unto the Elder yeah all of you
[1:00:51] be subject one to another be clothed
[1:00:55] with your reality for God resisted to
[1:00:58] proud and give it grace to the humble
[1:01:02] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:01:05] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:01:08] in due time
[1:01:09] casting all your care upon him
[1:01:11] for he cared for you and that is where
[1:01:14] this comes from any Amplified likewise
[1:01:16] you who are younger of lesser rank be
[1:01:19] subject to the elders the ministers and
[1:01:21] spiritual Guides of the church
[1:01:23] giving them due respect and he yielding
[1:01:27] to their counsel in other words you have
[1:01:29] your own thoughts you have your own
[1:01:31] ideas let me share this with you tonight
[1:01:34] there are many times people might come
[1:01:36] in the office or who might speak to me
[1:01:38] and they have a problem or situation
[1:01:41] and honestly I don't have a clue what to
[1:01:45] say to them
[1:01:46] but while they are speaking
[1:01:49] something drops
[1:01:51] and then I speak
[1:01:53] and then I will know
[1:01:55] is not my thoughts that was presented to
[1:01:58] them
[1:01:59] when they walk out of the office they
[1:02:01] have a choice
[1:02:02] to yield ticket
[1:02:04] or ignore it some you
[1:02:08] some ignore those who who yield the
[1:02:12] council they see the fruit of it those
[1:02:15] who ignore it
[1:02:16] they see the fruit of the decision of
[1:02:18] ignore because when we make our
[1:02:21] decisions
[1:02:22] there are consequences seen and unseen
[1:02:24] known and unknown they are secondary
[1:02:26] consequences before you make decisions
[1:02:30] consider and we what are the
[1:02:33] consequences of resizations many times
[1:02:36] you hear about Isaac striking it a lot
[1:02:39] could have managed Sodom not his wife
[1:02:43] not his children not all his children so
[1:02:46] even though he cannot manage being in
[1:02:48] Sodom as a mayor or whatever they get
[1:02:50] not his family
[1:02:52] he lost his family by the decision that
[1:02:55] he made
[1:02:56] be careful
[1:02:58] so what God sets himself against the
[1:03:01] proud repeated I know the insolent the
[1:03:05] overbearing
[1:03:06] the disdainful
[1:03:08] the presumptuous the boost for and he
[1:03:11] opposes frustrates and defeat them but
[1:03:15] gives Grace
[1:03:16] fever and blessing to the humble
[1:03:19] therefore
[1:03:21] therefore
[1:03:23] therefore
[1:03:25] humble yourselves
[1:03:26] how do we go demote
[1:03:29] lure yourselves in your own estimation
[1:03:33] under the mighty hand of God
[1:03:36] that in due time he may exalt you
[1:03:39] casting the whole of your care all your
[1:03:43] anxieties all of your worries all your
[1:03:47] concerns once and for all on him
[1:03:49] for he cares for you affectionately
[1:03:53] and cares about you watch for me maybe
[1:03:57] give the Lord some praise this tonight
[1:03:58] and Thanksgiving God bless you I trust
[1:04:01] tonight this was helpful to you
[1:04:05] yeah
[1:04:07] and
[1:04:10] I
[1:04:12] I'm amazed at whole the spirit of God
[1:04:14] works
[1:04:16] how
[1:04:18] the needs in people's lives
[1:04:21] when it comes to the front when it's
[1:04:23] brought out
[1:04:24] holy spirit will pick it up
[1:04:26] and bring answers and solutions and my
[1:04:30] mind will be bloom
[1:04:32] my mind going to be blown and I've seen
[1:04:35] it unfolded in that way and all I can do
[1:04:38] afterwards is bless God
[1:04:40] because I know
[1:04:42] God is weakening their fears of man
[1:04:45] just think
[1:04:47] God put us in time
[1:04:49] but he
[1:04:52] operates
[1:04:54] in eternity
[1:04:56] so when David asks God about the
[1:05:01] prospering of the proud and the boastful
[1:05:03] and the wicked God say have you
[1:05:05] considered the end
[1:05:06] because David is not in the Viewpoint to
[1:05:10] see what that end will be
[1:05:12] but God see in the end from the
[1:05:14] beginning
[1:05:15] so he's seen when somebody stopped he's
[1:05:17] seen when people breaking out and
[1:05:19] they're going here and you know things
[1:05:21] will come out for them and they see men
[1:05:23] all of that comes to an end now remember
[1:05:25] once we are in time and we are
[1:05:29] everything is not going to last
[1:05:32] you may be strong no but that could not
[1:05:35] always be
[1:05:36] things working out perfectly you know
[1:05:39] will not always be you may you may be in
[1:05:43] perfect health right now
[1:05:45] and that will not always be you may be
[1:05:47] in youth your Prime of Youth
[1:05:50] but next 50 years talk to me
[1:05:52] that will not always be
[1:05:55] time and we said it sometime in some
[1:05:57] service God put on the time summer until
[1:06:00] winter spring he put Seasons under there
[1:06:03] meaning that they are time for you to be
[1:06:06] between three and five between five and
[1:06:08] ten between 10 and 15 and you have your
[1:06:11] changes and challenges he put that there
[1:06:13] just as you plant a coincidence of his
[1:06:16] time to unfold and the leaves and come
[1:06:18] back to Corn you put that in there
[1:06:21] everything is not instant it unfolds it
[1:06:24] reveals
[1:06:25] to time
[1:06:27] so with us
[1:06:29] being given as a free moral agent on the
[1:06:33] earth to make our own choices and live
[1:06:34] how we choose to live we don't have to
[1:06:37] accommodate God in our lives
[1:06:39] we don't have to yield
[1:06:41] we don't have to Humble ourselves we
[1:06:44] could continue as we are and God will
[1:06:46] leave us
[1:06:47] self-powered
[1:06:51] become like somebody grandfather
[1:06:55] who had business and whatnot and leave
[1:06:57] as much our inheritance and then pass on
[1:06:59] to the children and the grandchildren
[1:07:01] and this next Generation now they're
[1:07:03] born into West they never in it it's
[1:07:06] their grandfather labored and they
[1:07:09] benefit from that and they can do
[1:07:11] whatever they want they could blow some
[1:07:13] smoke some cooking some and whatever and
[1:07:16] they still have roommate
[1:07:18] but eventually it comes to an end their
[1:07:21] lives come to an end
[1:07:23] and right now eventually this little
[1:07:26] service we have here tonight comes to an
[1:07:29] end
[1:07:29] and we end it right now let's ball heads
[1:07:32] heavenly father I thank you for your
[1:07:35] precious people here tonight that
[1:07:37] patiently listened
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:41] of your word of your truth
[1:07:43] I don't have a dream to give I don't
[1:07:45] have my own thoughts to give me I have
[1:07:49] your word your scriptures
[1:07:51] to declare this to them that you resist
[1:07:55] the problem and give grace to the humble
[1:07:57] God may we change our push the night
[1:08:01] as well as I believe in it brought out
[1:08:03] Ohana
[1:08:04] she wanted Vengeance she wanted
[1:08:06] Deliverance she wanted a breakthrough to
[1:08:08] head back up to the other woman in the
[1:08:10] house
[1:08:10] but all of a sudden a prayer changed
[1:08:14] and when she changed her prayer
[1:08:16] everything changed
[1:08:18] when she changed a prayer she changed a
[1:08:20] prayer that you went to bless her with a
[1:08:24] man child that she will give back to you
[1:08:26] it wasn't a personal Vendetta it wasn't
[1:08:29] a pride it wasn't Vengeance it wasn't
[1:08:31] trying to head back to those who were
[1:08:33] mocking up
[1:08:34] but it was something that would
[1:08:37] declare you and bring glory to you
[1:08:40] Lord if you're blessing with a son
[1:08:43] I will give them back to you
[1:08:45] and somehow when she finished a prayer a
[1:08:48] continence was different
[1:08:50] she wasn't stressed out
[1:08:52] she had a joy she had a smile it's like
[1:08:55] something broke
[1:08:57] father you know how you said
[1:08:59] fit either coming to God must believe
[1:09:01] that he is
[1:09:02] and that he is a rewarder it is
[1:09:05] something when we connect to feet and no
[1:09:08] it's going to unfold the way you want it
[1:09:09] to unfold but I mean you bless the
[1:09:11] people tonight your sons your daughters
[1:09:13] the elders didn't
[1:09:16] the visitors the people who are
[1:09:18] connected here maybe for the first time
[1:09:20] God bless them may their cup run over
[1:09:23] maybe
[1:09:24] have a heart to do your will
[1:09:26] I made the other heart that will be
[1:09:28] humbling before you
[1:09:30] the great things confront us when they
[1:09:33] come to us we would make excuses and say
[1:09:36] you know that's not me and and it's my
[1:09:39] husband or my wife or not me or because
[1:09:41] somebody and that is why and that is why
[1:09:44] and that is all these
[1:09:45] Nazi excuse will be out the door
[1:09:49] and all will be a humbling father one
[1:09:52] time there was this
[1:09:54] Soldier
[1:09:56] who had leprosy hiding it for years
[1:10:00] covered it up but every night to go to
[1:10:03] the armor
[1:10:04] and a god there was a little sister who
[1:10:07] told her told him about Elijah
[1:10:09] that that he could be healed
[1:10:11] that was wanted to acknowledge the
[1:10:13] information to know it is possible
[1:10:17] then when he went to see Elijah I just
[1:10:19] said go to the
[1:10:20] River Jordan and dip seven times and
[1:10:25] God is pride affected him at first
[1:10:29] to obey
[1:10:31] he didn't want to do it he was angry he
[1:10:32] was upset he taught angels will lead
[1:10:35] upon him and This Is Us Lord we always
[1:10:37] have our own ideas or we're supposed to
[1:10:39] be what is supposed to be done who's
[1:10:42] supposed to do it and that's not how you
[1:10:44] work
[1:10:45] and he was encouraged
[1:10:47] but sir
[1:10:49] if the prophet said go and dip sometimes
[1:10:51] why would you just do it
[1:10:54] why don't you just obey it
[1:10:56] and finally he dropped his pride in
[1:11:00] dismisses arrogance and he humbled
[1:11:02] himself and did seven times and when he
[1:11:05] came out
[1:11:06] he was whole
[1:11:08] he was well
[1:11:09] the leprosy was gone father tonight
[1:11:12] I pray leprosy would leave the people's
[1:11:14] preach on the preset prayer that
[1:11:16] something strike I pray that something
[1:11:19] changed no this was right in me I didn't
[1:11:21] know why and I just thought it was to
[1:11:23] get down into it it just couldn't leave
[1:11:25] me and this is the fruit of it what
[1:11:29] could release me they come testimonies
[1:11:30] from this particular special service may
[1:11:34] come testimony of of Lies being changed
[1:11:36] and hearts being drawn closer to you in
[1:11:39] all Humanity granted father
[1:11:41] in Jesus I asked it bless the service
