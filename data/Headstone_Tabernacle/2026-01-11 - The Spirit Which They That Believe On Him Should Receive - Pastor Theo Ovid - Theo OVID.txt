We thank you for being here among us as you promised you would be have the prayer minister this morning and we approach your word. May you speak to our hearts in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. You be seated. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight today. Praise the Lord. Uh if you haven't heard the exhortation from Friday, you should listen to it. Go back and listen to it. Praise God. Is a very very important something that I believe that God put upon my heart to share with you. And um praise the Lord. Amen. So I wonder if I could get something from that this morning. Didn't plan to, but Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise be to Jesus. um uh spoke about what excuse does how excuse and shifting blame like what Adam did keep you away from repentance because you're looking for escape hatchet into what you have done and so on doesn't make any sense and we show how David when he was accused when he was caught David said I have sinned I have failed and then mercy was extended to David &gt;&gt; so where was Adam and Adam was very crafty Uh he said when God say what have you done you know how you know you're naked he said the woman you give me making sure God understand you give me that woman and if you think that woman that's never going to happen so you see that's what excuses does it gives a justification and it gives something to minimize sin or justify your present position by making excuse by blaming this and blaming that but when you own up then there's mercy extended to you and grace extended to you so this to me is very very important and we come to the spot that we get deeply sincere here and you hear me over and over saying maturity is when you accept responsibility for your actions and your attitude. I'd like to blame anyone and say this and that but no but I take a choice a responsibility to act and to do like I used to teach my children share my share with my children you want to be able to have no regrets from this standpoint you treat somebody right treat somebody loving and caring if they treat you badly that have nothing to do with how you treat them &gt;&gt; is a choice you make and you're not taking back your choice you must never say I'm sorry I help them sorry I give them I'm sorry you must never say that it must be your choice because when God choose to love you. It was his choice. When you wasn't loving him back when you wasn't expressing mercy and grace to God, back love back to God, he expressed love to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God want us to do that to one another. &gt;&gt; God want us to help one another and pick each other up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, praise God. We are grateful to be here this morning. Praise God. We didn't have that special, right? Did we? &gt;&gt; We could do it, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we have a musical that we like to instrumental rather we like to play for you. Sister Naomi going to play something for us this morning and then I'll come back into the word. Praise to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. N. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Glory. Hosana. Hosana. Don't sleep. One more time. Hallelujah. Jesus died and rose again. God bless you. Amen. At this time, I'd like you to turn your Bibles to three portion of scripture. We want to read from John chapter 7 verse 37-39. If you're writing it down, Acts chapter 19 1-2 and Acts chapter 8 14-17. Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you once again for coming out this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We look and see what the Lord will do for us. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Reading from St. John chapter 7, reading from verse 37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this spake he of the spirit, &gt;&gt; all right? &gt;&gt; Which they that believe on him should receive, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For the Holy Ghost was not yet given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was not yet glorified. &gt;&gt; Acts 19:1-2. It came to pass that while Apollos was as current, Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples, he said unto them, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; since he believed?" And they said unto him, we have not much so have heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 8, reading from verse 14. And when the apostles written by Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, who when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them. &gt;&gt; Note the words. &gt;&gt; Only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word this morning. And I pray it would enlighten, inspire, bring revelation, inspiration, and transformation to the lives of people gathered here. May you break the bands of wickedness. Unlock their understanding. Open up your word to them. Bring clarity to your people. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be seated. And I want to invite you to give God some praise as you sit down. &gt;&gt; I have to fight for every inch. That's what I'm doing here right now. &gt;&gt; So when I tell you sit down and praise God because I want some no praise demon to take their exit. We have no praise demons to fight. No praise demons is them that are sitting on your top lip and don't and you can't say amen and you can't rejoice and you can't raise your hand because you're worried about what happened out there. That's them demons we talking about. We want to kick them out. Want to get them the boots like how Satan get kicked out of heaven. We want to kick them out of heavenly places inside of here. And when you do that, you create an atmosphere of praise and thanksgiving that angels could come down and the glory of God could fill the house and God could fill it with joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Good to see you, Sister June. God bless you. Welcome back. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. All right, let me get the title. The spirit which they that believe on him should receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the title. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit. &gt;&gt; Glor &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him &gt;&gt; should receive. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus own words now. &gt;&gt; Do you get it now? &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. So this here was a prophecy &gt;&gt; because the Bible went on next to say but this spake he of the spirit &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him should receive &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given &gt;&gt; because that Jesus was not yet glorified. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is something that is given &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is something that you must receive &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is something that must fall upon you. &gt;&gt; Where I get that scripture from? Look it right here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria received the word of God. &gt;&gt; So they had the word. &gt;&gt; They had the books. They press and play. They had the tapes. They had exorters and preachers. But they had the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; Do you shout in the house? &gt;&gt; So they have to send for Peter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have to send for Peter. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? and John who when they come down prayed for them &gt;&gt; that they might receive this thing called the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; For as yet he was fallen upon none of them. &gt;&gt; And to the group in Acts 19, it says we have not and much so heard &gt;&gt; about any Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We don't even know we have to receive this thing. &gt;&gt; I thank God hearing about it because I know if I hear it, &gt;&gt; I could receive it. If I don't hear it, if I don't hear about it, I don't even know it's for me. Okay, the Lord I shout. Hallelujah. He said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost?" Since you believe, not when you believe, but since you believe. Are we in the word this morning? Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the title from Jesus words the spirit &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him should receive &gt;&gt; and have an inspiration another book of acts &gt;&gt; not another message church another book of acts not another denomination another book of acts we are going to have another book of acts and the holy ghost is who wrote that book of acts that wasn't man's doing that was god's doing that was the operation of the spirit of god oh give the lord some praises. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "The works that I do, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; shall you do &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; greater." &gt;&gt; And we were taught that this greater &gt;&gt; is to impart eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a powerful That's a big one. &gt;&gt; That's beyond signs and wonders. Now, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, this is the prophet saying here now. How much greater is it to say that this sick woman laying here, I can pray a prayer of faith and she'd be healed. That's a great thing. And that's what he was doing then. He said, "Greater than this shall you do. I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while, but to give him eternal life &gt;&gt; which will be eternal forever." &gt;&gt; Poor, blind, wretched people. How do you miss that? Don't you see what the greater thing is? That's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people. &gt;&gt; What is eternal life? The life that he lived, the life that was in him impart that to others. &gt;&gt; Can a man do that? A son of God can. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit to them that remitted. Whosoever sins you retain, to them that retain." And here is where the Catholic Church and many others make their big mistake. They go out and say, "I forgive your sins." That that wasn't it. How did they get their sins forgiven in the Bible? Peter answered the question of the day of Pentecost. What can we do to be saved? He said, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins." And if you're inside of here and you haven't been baptized, you have to repent and get baptized in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Not in father, son, and holy ghost. in Jesus name &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sins and you shall receive &gt;&gt; this thing called the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You shall receive. You have somebody to receive. If we tell you downstairs we have cake or we have food or whatn not when you when you go downstairs don't miss it. Go and receive it. It's up to you to walk out and don't take none. &gt;&gt; If there are boxes of sandwiches and whatnot, we say when you leave the service you have sandwiches to pick up and you walk through the door and walk out fast. That's your business. But everybody who want it will go and take it and receive it because it's a promise if you go downstairs there is this there for you. Well Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because the promise give the Lord a shout it's a promise. It's a promise. It's a promise. It's not something we have behind the pulpit here. It's a promise. The promise is unto you and to your children too and to them that are far off. &gt;&gt; It means everybody supposed to get this thing. &gt;&gt; It's not only for us these apostles. It's for you &gt;&gt; and your children and them that are far off. It go even further than that. As many as the Lord our God shall call. Oh, give the Lord a shout. It's not only for the Jews, it's for the Gentiles also. It's so the good. Hallelujah. So the wretched is to the miserable. It's for the prostitute. Whosoever well could come and receive of this thing. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; And this Holy Ghost is just as real as it was in that day. Do I shout in the house? We are not imagining anything. Hallelujah. We not figuring out anything. &gt;&gt; You see why Satan is so against the book of Revelation, &gt;&gt; spiritual revelation. He's against it. &gt;&gt; He's against the ministry today. &gt;&gt; Why? It's revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; Let the church go on with this great denomination and organization. It's little flowery messages and so forth. Let them go on with that. Satan won't bother with that. His ears are talking this talk. &gt;&gt; They don't have no troubles. Everybody pat them on the back. &gt;&gt; But when there comes a time &gt;&gt; when God through the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; reveals Christ back in the church &gt;&gt; with the power &gt;&gt; and demonstrations of healing the sick and making the signs that he said would follow the believers come to pass, then Satan turns over in his bed and he does something about it. Just like him for years. I'm telling you, they will not close us down for doing what we doing this morning. &gt;&gt; We are just another church, another group, another fellowship, another &gt;&gt; Satan not interested in that. Satan don't believe we who we are. &gt;&gt; The press come down and the press and the press. What press? &gt;&gt; You pressing your own stuff with your foolishness. &gt;&gt; Devil is not coming down on you. You doing your you, you doing you. &gt;&gt; And if you doing you, the devil hands off. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look how they acting stupid. Leave them alone. &gt;&gt; I touching them. Leave them. They been the folly. Let them fight one another, cuss one another, hate one another, bit against one another. I ain't touching that. I have other work to do. He busy, you know, two and four over the earth, you know, &gt;&gt; but let them strike the unity of the faith. Let them strike forgiveness. Let them strike brotherly kindness. Let them come under expectation. Let them come just and devout and sanctified worshiping God. Fire going to fall in this place. Signs and wonders going to be the going to work right in this place. Blind will see right in this place. Don't get me started this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to roll? You know, &gt;&gt; you may be seated. And Friday prayer meeting we read to you &gt;&gt; God's servants can't get into action &gt;&gt; till the people pray &gt;&gt; if you put the anointing on the man alone you're not praying know &gt;&gt; you're waiting for your bishop to come &gt;&gt; he not here this morning you know &gt;&gt; bishop missing you're wishing for some pope to come &gt;&gt; but if you recognize as a believer &gt;&gt; you have an opportunity unity &gt;&gt; and a part and a purpose to light the match &gt;&gt; of this revival fire. &gt;&gt; You will change how you talk in your house. You will change how you pray in your house. You will change what you do in your house because there's an angel watching you. The Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Did you hear that? There's an angel watching you. &gt;&gt; We preach certain quotes for years because we want you to know the word. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he is marking the people now. &gt;&gt; Some to get the Holy Ghost and some to be judged. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Satan comes over in his bed. He does something about it. Until that time, &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how much church you join. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; See, look. He he he joined that one. He joined that one. He going that one. He going to one. He got this one. He he like the pastor. They looking more messages and he have more mysteries and he's deeper and he speak some long long services. T them preaching too short. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how much you join. &gt;&gt; He don't care how much. But when Christ here we go reveals to you that he's the son of God. &gt;&gt; And the works he did you do also. Not some other works but the same works. They are not giving out books like the works. Hallelujah. The same works that I do shall you do also. You have to believe that and these signs shall follow the pastor. No, them that believe some pastor don't even believe. Okay, the Lord has shout at the house but them that believe. Come on you believers. Let me say amen. Don't watch and stare. Say amen. Open your mouth and say amen. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me the works that I do &gt;&gt; shall do also &gt;&gt; do the same works and greater than this &gt;&gt; here we go. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We warming up. &gt;&gt; Christ could not preach &gt;&gt; the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given. &gt;&gt; So he told them, &gt;&gt; "If I don't go, &gt;&gt; the comforter is not going to come." So you can't receive this once I'm here in this way. &gt;&gt; But I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to you. Okay. The Lord I shout a little while the world seeth me no more but you are going to see me today. This spirit that they had to receive it was on its way. Oh glory to God. Give the Lord a shout. And I say this morning, it's on its way. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My God, the praises of God's in the house this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So Christ couldn't preach it, but his disciples could. His ministers could, his apostles could, his pastors could &gt;&gt; something stretch, something strike my freshman Clarence. Jesus &gt;&gt; in his postresurrection ministry when he raised from the dead and appear and appeared to the private meeting with disciples all he could have said was &gt;&gt; receive he the Holy Ghost oh this is powerful he couldn't give it to them he said receive ye the Holy Ghost behold I send the promise of my father upon you but t in the city of Jerusalem until you receive power from on high going to bust your kind of spirit. You're going to break your kind of nature. You're going to break. Oh, you can't do this and you can't overcome this and you can't get victory over this. You're going to bust that. Oh, give the Lord a shout. All what you can overcome. You're going to overcome. It's the Holy Ghost on fire. They're going to keep you alive. They give you power to pray, power to overcome, power to say, "I'm sorry." Power to say that you're wrong. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May be seated. &gt;&gt; So this this morning is loaded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You might have to go back and listen to the tape, but this is loaded this morning. &gt;&gt; All right. He could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given. But when Jesus came and sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost returned, then they could impart eternal life to the people. And that's the greater. &gt;&gt; But the signs and wonders Jes Jesus plainly said in Mark 16, go into all the world, preach the gospel. How far? All the world, every creature. As long as the gospel is being preached, these signs shall follow them. that believe. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So Moses was rejected and Jesus was rejected and they rejected the message from Samuel. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham says, "This is the law of God to receive a vindicated servant." Note his words, not servant, but vindicated servant. &gt;&gt; Moses was vindicated. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus was vindicated. Samuel was vindicated and he turned them down. &gt;&gt; So then he said this here. Now this is a law of God. The law is to receive a vindicated servant. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily I say unto you, he's quoting scripture. &gt;&gt; He that receive whosoever I send &gt;&gt; receiveth receives me. And he that receives me receive him that sent me. A vindicated servant. He said there's a thousand servants laying there. is the law of God. So Jesus said, "He that receives them that I send receives me." And now them that he send them that receives me receive and send me. Wish we had time to linger on that. &gt;&gt; Then he said these words, "You can only serve God &gt;&gt; as you do and believe the servants that God sends." &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. You can only serve God on earth as God's servants that are sent on earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you. &gt;&gt; So God vindicated this man called William Brham as the 20th century prophet as Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Revelation 10:7. He was the vindicated prophet that interpret the word by divine inspiration to us. &gt;&gt; And he said when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world that this Holy Ghost is just as real when as it was in Pentecost when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church not before God sets in the church pastors and prophets and teachers evangelists by what the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; not man anointed not manappointed but God called man. Oh God, if God call you, God call you. God can't cancel his calling upon you. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. If God elected you, God elected you. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. I enjoy that message Isaac brought in Malachi. He said, you say, "I don't love you." Praise God. Let me show you. Praise God. It wasn't Esau Jacob's brother. Let me show you what hate looks like. Oh, glory to God. Don't talk about I love you. My love is elective love. Praise God. I could send you through the flood. I could send you through trials. I could send you through whatever you want to go, whatever you have to go through. But don't tell me, don't ever say it's not my love. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So therefore, &gt;&gt; God's channel is men, servants, that he vindicate those men. &gt;&gt; Vindicate those servants and then you believe them to be genuine servants of God. All right. But Abraham said that proves that his message is through his servants always has. Now the power of the believing church. &gt;&gt; Christ has all power in heaven. He said all power is heaven is given to me. Christ have all power. He is the seed word in his body. &gt;&gt; And he in us becomes the seed word in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that was in God, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the power. &gt;&gt; Now, remember God's law of reproduction after its kind. The seed of Christ, the word must come through his body. &gt;&gt; That is why that sent for Peter and John &gt;&gt; because those bunch of people only had books and tapes. &gt;&gt; They only had the word alone. They believed the message, but they didn't have the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost can only come &gt;&gt; through the body. This is after Pentecost now. There's not going to be another 120 in no room. That happened back there. Not going to happen again. The Holy Ghost now is poured out on individuals. Come on now. Come on now. Come on tabernacle. Give me a shout. This is the word we talking about. The Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals. So you can sit there telling yourself, "The Holy Ghost could pour out on me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It could happen. You know, &gt;&gt; not next week, today. &gt;&gt; So all this thing about they need no pastor, they want no pastor and and whatn not on there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch it. You know, &gt;&gt; it has some bent up people that come into this message. You know, &gt;&gt; it has some bent up minds twisting this word. You know, &gt;&gt; we have a pattern. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is another book of acts. &gt;&gt; We have a pattern which is the Bible. &gt;&gt; Brother didn't come and preach outside the Bible. You know, &gt;&gt; he came to reveal what is in this book. &gt;&gt; This book is the the typost. &gt;&gt; This book is the anchor point. &gt;&gt; Wherever the angel tell him, you got to check it here. And Paul said, "If an angel come down from heaven and preach any other gospel, oh give the Lord a shout, let him be a cursed much as a trillion that angel." Oh, give the Lord a shout, much less a smoke out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This one come from heaven and Paul said light them a fire. &gt;&gt; Paul went and put himself on the line. He said I come back &gt;&gt; and preach something different that I originally bring. Let me be a curse. &gt;&gt; Wipe me out too. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. We coming to the word. You know I want a church with discernment. I want a church with revelation. I want a church that is anchored. I want a church that wind can't blow your hair and blow your hair. I want a church rooted and grounded. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A new season is here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You hear what I said? &gt;&gt; A new season is here. &gt;&gt; I believe all my heart. &gt;&gt; These are thing I preach already. And listen, this my I just like you know sometimes you know this book, &gt;&gt; this Bible, this message &gt;&gt; it just sometime you it right there. But when it's time for you to see God, open your eyes. And and I am hoping that you see what I see how I see it. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping you catch it this morning. &gt;&gt; Brother, the seed of Christ, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; must come through his body. &gt;&gt; Not through a denomination, &gt;&gt; but through a bornagain seed of the word. It must come true. Remember that. &gt;&gt; How does my seed come? Through the body. How does the apple seed come? Through the body. Seed is through the body. &gt;&gt; And the church is the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; You see how we bring it? &gt;&gt; The body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus talked about how he build his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said flesh and blood has not revealed unto you and upon this rock &gt;&gt; I will build my church. So he have a my church. &gt;&gt; Not everybody church is Jesus church. He have your own my church. I will build my church and with my church he gets a hell prevail against it because my church is built upon revelation. When God reveal it to you, there's enough devils in hell to throw that off from inside of you to move you from that. There's a song like I like old song faith of our fathers living still in spite of fire, dungeon and sword. &gt;&gt; The faith of our fathers is living still. Money can't change it. &gt;&gt; Riches can't change it. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Nothing can change that faith. &gt;&gt; So, how does the apple seed come? Through the body. Seed is through the body. And the church is the body of Christ. And when he's talking about the church, he's not talking about this tabernacle here. He's talking about the body of Christ. And by one spirit, that's how you get into that body. &gt;&gt; You can't join that body. You join your family. You wake up as a baby with your D power and just sign up and just can I join? You're coming. You're coming through. No hands. Somebody give you birth. Somebody bed you &gt;&gt; and they tack a name on you. You born into a name. So if your name last name is John, you are born into John. &gt;&gt; And then your name Harry John or John John &gt;&gt; or tall John or Mr. whatever they put attack on you. But those two names are not important. The next name, partter name is the name you make for yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on now. &gt;&gt; They they could name you Esau. &gt;&gt; They could even name you Kane. Say, but you you can't. That don't mean you king with you. &gt;&gt; But the name you make for yourself, &gt;&gt; that's different all together. &gt;&gt; That speaks volume. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like in in funerals I say, "Oh, some people die as if they never live." &gt;&gt; No track, no record, no nothing. Just nothing. No footprints on the sands of time. No legacy, nothing you could say while there live a life out. No, you don't want to be like that. &gt;&gt; Leave some footprints. &gt;&gt; In in Lagos, I you heard me preach about the lighthouse. The lighters don't argue just stand there and shine. &gt;&gt; Darkness coming, darkness going, rays roaring. What the light stand that what good that that put light for. &gt;&gt; And Jesus say you are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Stand up like a lighthouse. &gt;&gt; You said if you're moving, you're old, but you're still like a lighthouse. You're still shining some light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go over your old and you stay old. You have a old for purpose. You have to have some wisdom is coming out your mouth. Some people just get old, you know. No wisdom at all. You know, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like a 70-y old man in a 50-y old body. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; A 70-y old man with a 15y old mind. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about he don't want to get old and crabby. &gt;&gt; One of the worst thing to become is a crabby crabby person. &gt;&gt; You're grumpy. You're grumpy. Everything is a grump. Is a grump is a grump. &gt;&gt; Nobody want to be around you. Help us God. &gt;&gt; But Ion say the right thing. Help us. Help us. Help us. Help us. The children. So the children. So I remember years ago tell say do yourself. No. I say forget them you know. I said don't get big and old and leave. Fix yourself up and encourage you because I say serve Christ. And they were small when I said look at them now. Everybody child that child here come big man on inside your house &gt;&gt; all right let's go &gt;&gt; Paul Jesus &gt;&gt; was afraid that the people would watch some kind of big words he would say &gt;&gt; some kind of education so Paul was educated &gt;&gt; because God needed that gift and that talent to expound on the old testament and write the you &gt;&gt; Peter couldn't do that. He was a fisherman cross body got read or right &gt;&gt; like issues you can't put a pen and paper and a man say write and things like that you understand I'm saying so Peter would have been limited &gt;&gt; to write these apostles this epistles but Paul was gifted &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; to do that &gt;&gt; and God used him to do that so it's not like God don't interested in somebody educated or education no it's the capacity and the yielding that we have that yielding to God &gt;&gt; so because of that Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man wisdom &gt;&gt; that your faith may not rest on the wisdom of man because when I bring that word so and twist &gt;&gt; never see it so I didn't come with that never see it so thing &gt;&gt; I came that your faith may rest in the power of God &gt;&gt; and my preaching and teaching reflected that &gt;&gt; so he said it here now I never come to you in speaking words intellectual you that but that your faith might be some sinary thing but I come to you with the simplicity in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost that your faith should rest in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if God pull the rug under me and I gone tomorrow when I say gone out of here &gt;&gt; you go backside. &gt;&gt; I never preach me. &gt;&gt; I hope me is not in none of your heart but I that won't preach in here at all. In other words, if I go on tomorrow, the word is still God. You know, nothing changes. The shout continues. The promise continues because we laying a seed and hoping it come to life. That's what brother talk about. Give the Lord a praise in the house. &gt;&gt; We put in a tape. &gt;&gt; Oh, your tape this morning. You back. If you say that, you back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a tape playing here. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; You can watch it on the screen here. Right now, you're seeing a tape playing right now. You're not here to see me. You're here for the word. You're here to get something inside. Your training is not to a leader. Your training is to the word. &gt;&gt; I told her brother, every cult leader, whether in this message or out, when they fall, the whole thing fall down. That's true. That's true. &gt;&gt; I said church in America went from 15,000 to about 1,000 people and then out, close out &gt;&gt; in four months time &gt;&gt; because the cult leader got flattened &gt;&gt; by what is in man &gt;&gt; and the three things they have to deal with. Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, &gt;&gt; and the pride of life. And them hit get them get hit with all not just one, you know, all all. Let's hit them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the incredible thing about these guys, they have the money, &gt;&gt; they have the cars, they have the private jets, they have the campuses, they have the fame, they even write books and all. &gt;&gt; They are multi-millionaires. And &gt;&gt; Satan collapsed them. &gt;&gt; The god of this evil age. &gt;&gt; What did our prophet taught us? He taught us that if the Pentecostals had received the word, rapture rapture take place already &gt;&gt; because the word is what gives character &gt;&gt; not gifts &gt;&gt; and we have seen enough gifted people &gt;&gt; with no life. &gt;&gt; We not interested in so much how much gift you have. We love your gift but do you have something else besides that? &gt;&gt; What else you bring to the table? &gt;&gt; What else do you bring to the table? I have a gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; That what the man had very talented. &gt;&gt; He give him the gift. He g him to do what thing and he come the master come back and say hey oh master so glad you come back. The same gift you give me. &gt;&gt; He dig it up and give him. &gt;&gt; He say wicked he call wicked you know. &gt;&gt; We just take it easy on people you know. &gt;&gt; But God see wickedness you know. &gt;&gt; At least they could have put it in the bank. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know it's half% they're giving now &gt;&gt; of getting one at least at least I'll get a.5% on my money but to bury it &gt;&gt; inflation is more than that you know &gt;&gt; then Jesus made an astonishing statement &gt;&gt; when he said give it to the man who made the most give him him &gt;&gt; then he said to him that had not the little that he have &gt;&gt; will be taken away from him &gt;&gt; don't be in trouble. You know, &gt;&gt; you better come good. You know, &gt;&gt; God want productivity. You know, &gt;&gt; God want your praise and worship. You know, I look at if your roof blow off last night and you're supposed to be sad this morning, show God your faith by giving him praises right here in this house right now. Give the Lord a shout because this is what demonstrates faith. Not when things going smooth, not when things going good. When you don't have the answer to the question that you're asking God, you don't have the answer, you could trust him still &gt;&gt; because he knows best. And Romans 8:28 still applies. And we know that all things work together for good. Glory to God. You want this, you want that, but let God's will be done. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. The denominational churches will not the the denominational churches will outnumber the bride a thousand to one. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And he quote a scripture Isaiah 54:1. Sing, O baron, thou that does not bear, breathe out into singing and cry aloud. Thou that not travail with child. For more are the children of the desolate that the children of the married wife sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; More are the children of the than the married wife. Outnumber us many times. Though there be more in numbers, they have no true father. &gt;&gt; The denominational kinds is represented in Jude 8:13. That's a secular church. &gt;&gt; Jude call them clouds without rain &gt;&gt; forming in their own shame. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church I'm still reading is represented by second Timothy 3. &gt;&gt; That is in the message now. &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness &gt;&gt; but denying the power because they have seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have words. &gt;&gt; But they don't want the power of God. You see, because the power of God handles all of us, you know. &gt;&gt; The power of God doesn't make the minister bigger and the sheep smaller. You know, the power of God come to flatten everybody. You know, &gt;&gt; notice all of them was in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Peter saying I'm Peter. You know, I had to go up there. No, I outside the room and I want to show that I have a higher post for I with Mary Mary Magdalene in that crowded room the door closed and door shut. I'm not in that. I am brother Peter. I walk with I walk on water. I want you to know I walk on water. &gt;&gt; And somebody will say talk all Peter talking somebody say deny Christ three time. He said all right all right all right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see all have sinned and come short of the glory. And you inside of here who feel you're a big shot above anybody else because you're they're dressing longer or brighter or taller or whatever it is. You think in your own mind you're fooling yourself because all of us have come short of the glory of God. All of us need this Holy Ghost, the spirit that God promised that you have to receive &gt;&gt; the sealed church, the real church, the true sperm. &gt;&gt; That's why when God told the prophet pick up right, he said out of a group, &gt;&gt; out of the church, a group will of the true seed of the word, &gt;&gt; God represent Christ, a beloved bride. So it has to come the true seed of the road word and that true seed means no man's idea interpretation. Man shall not by bread alone but by every word from the mouth of God means by the words of the prophets. &gt;&gt; This Bible is the words of the prophets &gt;&gt; because God big enough to ensure that whatever words he want in this book it's in this book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he want these words for a purpose &gt;&gt; for our examples. All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let's see how this book of acts working here. Now &gt;&gt; there's from Acts chapter 8. We want to read from verse 25 to 38. I know a little teaching this morning but I feel this is important foundation for what God is about to break out among us. &gt;&gt; He will break it among us. Acts 8 28-38. And they when they are testify and preach the word of God return to Jerusalem and preach the gospel as many villages of the Samaritans. &gt;&gt; So now the church is unmoved. The gospel is spreading. These disciples and apostles, they are lit up with the power and presence of God. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philillip, not the minister association. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not some man overseas talking to Philillip. &gt;&gt; The angel spoke to Philillip &gt;&gt; and said, arise, &gt;&gt; go towards the south unto the way that go from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is the desert. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he arose and went. And behold, a man of notice the angel will tell him everything to do. &gt;&gt; Just arise. Go there. &gt;&gt; Philip goes there and watch verse 27. He arose and went. Behold, a man of Ethiopia and Enoch, Enoch of great authority under Candice, Queen of the Etopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to for to worship, was returning, sitting in his chariot, reading Isaiah's the prophet. Then the spirit said unto Philillip, note again who is directing this thing. &gt;&gt; Go near and join thyself to this chariot. Philip rant to him, heard him read the prophet Isaas and said, understand this thou what those readers? He said, how can I except some man should guide me? And he desired Philillip that he would come and sit with him. The place of the scripture which it read was this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter like a lamb down before a sharer. So opening not his mouth. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away. Who shall declare his generation? For the life is taken from the earth. And the uno answered Philillip and said, I pray he of whom speaketh the prophet of this of himself of another man. Here we go. Then Philillip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture &gt;&gt; and preached unto him Jesus. &gt;&gt; You hear what he preached? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; People preaching Brandham. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham came to introduce &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Brother Bram came to do what? Introduce who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. Introduce who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; One more time. Introduce who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. As John the Baptist was sent to Veron the first coming, you have a message that would forun my second coming. Brother Brandham came to introduce Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not message popes, message wars or church wars. He came to introduce Jesus. &gt;&gt; Says we want to see Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they went their way, verse 36, they came unto a certain water. And Uno said, "Here is water." What hinder me to be baptized? That man was desperate. &gt;&gt; That man was a seed. &gt;&gt; That man was a son. God wasting time. He has sent Philip to waste time. When a man see water, he say look water there. &gt;&gt; What? What hinderest me to be a baptized? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch this now. And Philip said unto him, "If thou believest with all thy heart, thou meest." &gt;&gt; And he and said, "I believe &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is the son of God." &gt;&gt; And he commanded the chariot to stand still. &gt;&gt; And they went both down into the water, both Philillip and the uno, and he baptized them. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelu Brandom. Now remember the gospel was never committed to angels. God never committed his preaching of the gospel to an angel. &gt;&gt; So the angel, praise God, is wrong if he's different from the word. &gt;&gt; Notice Philillip was at Pentecost Jerusalem to worship. &gt;&gt; How many say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. The uno has been with the deities and the elders and everything else. Why didn't he get something but a punch? But what I'm saying he was with the deities. He was the best of the best in the message, but he didn't get nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came back studying the prophecy of Isaiah. Although, here we go. An angel directed Philillip to him, &gt;&gt; but the germ of life &gt;&gt; had to come through the body. &gt;&gt; And Philillip, give the Lord a shout. Where did the germ come from? &gt;&gt; Through the angel. &gt;&gt; The angel train where to go. An angel is a messenger. But here is a son. Philip had the germ, the message, the word. That is how a child can be born. And Philip laid hands upon him. And he was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And there comfort the spirit of God. Now the German to come from the body. What body? Christ's body. And Philillip was a member of that body. There's going to be another book of acts. Give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's going to be another book of acts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And this is the same thing happened with Peter in Acts 10. Peter was in the ropes and rotop angel direct him to Cornelius's house. And the Bible said while Peter speak these words. Not the angel, not the canon. While Peter spake these words, he was in the body. He had the word and the angel directed it. But the life come through the body. And you know what happened? Amen. &gt;&gt; They were filled &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and didn't get baptized yet &gt;&gt; because his heart was right. &gt;&gt; He was just he was devout. He was a giving person. He gives so much that God had a memorial for that man &gt;&gt; and he ain't saved yet. But God watching. You think God not watching you and your selfishness? There's not God watching you the behavior. God watching you know. &gt;&gt; You think me pastor watching you? Pastor don't have them kind of eyes. &gt;&gt; I not watching you. Gal &gt;&gt; if I watching you get away because I ain't seen you. Much time I come here and ask me this person said she said yes. I say I ain't see them. That person say yes I a see them. &gt;&gt; I not like they downstairs they upstairs and I a see them see me play do so sometime. &gt;&gt; All right. So Paul on his way to Damascus a vision directed him to Ananas. Ananas had the gym. &gt;&gt; Paul get knocked out his horse blind like a bat &gt;&gt; and God tell him go by an ass &gt;&gt; boy. What if an ass was contrary and then the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that wicked man boy persecuting the church and you touching that man? &gt;&gt; Nah. God cast on that man to me. &gt;&gt; You see how you have to be different? &gt;&gt; You saw people have to be converted. &gt;&gt; This man, he was Saul &gt;&gt; persecuting the church. &gt;&gt; He is the message. He gets the inspiration. Here's the revelation. He fighting. &gt;&gt; He was witness to Steven's death. &gt;&gt; That man got flip over. Turn upside down. Smoke him out &gt;&gt; and tell him go ass. &gt;&gt; What if an ass didn't have the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Just bad behavior. to train that behavior but thank God he was not trained that natural kind of human he had a man filled with the Holy Ghost when I finished with him he received his sight and he received the Holy Ghost too the Lord I shout what I'm telling you you are going to receive the Holy Ghost it's a promise &gt;&gt; but I saw the Lord appear to you in the road coming down here &gt;&gt; where the Lord came to the prophet prophet side and said, "He come, he has sent me here that I might lay my hands upon you that you would be healed and receive the Holy Ghost, receive your sight." And the scales fell off his eyes. He rose and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And Paul was going to raise up to be one of the mightiest prophet, the original prophet in the early church. &gt;&gt; No other man stood in Paul's position. But yet Paul had to be humble enough to go to Annias because that is what God want because Anias had the germ. And when he received the Holy Ghost, he now have germ. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet talk about the birth this born again going from mouth to mouth. &gt;&gt; From the mouth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the angel directed it. Paul had seen him. It takes the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the seed to give it life eternal. &gt;&gt; Could we continue? &gt;&gt; All right. Good. &gt;&gt; St. John 663. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quickenth. &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks. &gt;&gt; The flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit &gt;&gt; and they are life. &gt;&gt; So words are not just words. &gt;&gt; So while Peter spake these words, The Holy Ghost fell. &gt;&gt; Acts 10. Right. &gt;&gt; Peter spoke the word and the Holy Spirit is the word. &gt;&gt; Because Cornelius received the word and the seed germ was in Peter. &gt;&gt; So God God disguised the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in the form of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said it this way. Um in the beginning was the word. He said, um, what? As many as receive him &gt;&gt; to them, &gt;&gt; give he power &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; As many receive who's him? The word &gt;&gt; to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word is spirit also. &gt;&gt; All right. So God hid the Holy Ghost as the word. What did the prophet say? The secret is &gt;&gt; the word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's where the devil can't touch you now. when that word get inside of you. &gt;&gt; The devil can't touch that now. &gt;&gt; It's in the bride. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So all these years &gt;&gt; we have been sowing the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in the form of word promises. &gt;&gt; Peter said it this way. By these promises you become partakers of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; So you come to church to receive promise after promise after promise. Afterward is inside of you now. &gt;&gt; You are jammed with the word. &gt;&gt; You are full with the word. You are pregnant with the word. You are pregnant with God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch the real message has been sown into you as a seed. &gt;&gt; But Ram says that's why I'm so zealous of the seed that I sow. He said he come to bring the Bible. The Bible has a seed. The entire message is really the Bible. Seed form placed inside of you. The revealed word. Isn't that right? So those that receive the seed, the word, &gt;&gt; the spirit, which is the oil, &gt;&gt; now you could understand &gt;&gt; in the parable of the wise and foolish virgins why the foolish cannot get the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they turn down the word &gt;&gt; that could change into spirit &gt;&gt; in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. 1 Corinthians 4:20, the kingdom of God is the word made power. I'm still reading if you want to put that down. What is the kingdom of God? It's within you. &gt;&gt; The kingdom in you. And Jesus told them say low here, low there, it here, it here. He said don't follow them. &gt;&gt; I say that you know. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that you know they say it's here. It here come across here. &gt;&gt; He said don't bother with that. &gt;&gt; The kingdom is &gt;&gt; he told his own disciples that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But said here now when the word comes in here, &gt;&gt; what does this word begin? It turns itself into power. &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus knew what he was talking about. He knew because when he prayed in St. John 17, he said, "Father, I have given them thy word. &gt;&gt; And to receive it, &gt;&gt; sanctify them by thy truth. &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth." So he knew the word was in the disciples. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they already had power in them &gt;&gt; in the form of the word &gt;&gt; but it will take the spirit &gt;&gt; to activate. &gt;&gt; Activate &gt;&gt; that was in them. &gt;&gt; So when you get a brand new cell phone &gt;&gt; and you don't get activated they can't make no calls. You know we don't talking about WhatsApp. Leave WhatsApp out of this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't Wi-Fi thing. You have to go to the company, get it activated &gt;&gt; for it to be valid. Then other than that, you might as well put it block the door or something. So like the rest on paper or something. It can't do nothing then. &gt;&gt; But once it activated, you could make calls and you could receive calls. &gt;&gt; So when God activate what's inside of you, you could make calls &gt;&gt; and you can receive calls. We talking about horizontal now, vertical now. You could call heaven and heaven could call you. Okay. The Lord I shout Hallelujah. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This activation make you be calling vertical. &gt;&gt; They could call up and up could call down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Back in tune. &gt;&gt; Because when Adam fell, he said line break. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't call and God, you know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thorns and thistles and you know trouble. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Trouble is serious life. &gt;&gt; Old age, &gt;&gt; back pain, &gt;&gt; death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go and work &gt;&gt; by the sweat of thy brow. All the time he speaking the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh it by the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat bread. &gt;&gt; Dust thou art. Dust thou art and thou shall return. &gt;&gt; There's a sentence in there. You know, watch. &gt;&gt; What are you looking for, friend? Now they are looking for a kingdom. What is the kingdom? It's on earth now. It's a spirit. It's the mystical body of Christ in there. They come out of Presbyterian, Methodist, Pentecost, and everything else. They are in this kingdom. They are born in there. They come in there by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And they're in the kingdom. It have nothing to do with joining no church &gt;&gt; and joining. No, they come into the kingdom. I don't care what titles they have over them. Bapt Baptist, Methodist, and whatnot. Or this interpretation, that interpretation. The spirit makes us brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because only one Lord, there's one spirit, there's one baptism. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, how can the foolish virgin get the oil when the oil was veiled as seed and they fight it and reject it? So then when the Holy Ghost begin to baptize the people, what can you say? The oil is the word. &gt;&gt; So this germ we're talking about now is connected to the ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the ministry of Jesus Christ will be that germ, that sea germ in the body &gt;&gt; that will be given out &gt;&gt; that will be released. So the ministry of Jesus Christ will be the seerm and that will actually be in the five-fold ministry body. &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart we have to see evidence of this virtue from Christ because Christ had it in him. &gt;&gt; It wasn't temporary. It was permanent. And not just permanent, it was resident because the woman with the blood issue who told herself, if I could just touch the hem of his garment and she touched his garment, she got whole. &gt;&gt; She was healed. And Jesus said, "I felt virtue left me." &gt;&gt; Before he said that, disciples said, he said, "Who touched my clothes?" &gt;&gt; That was his reaction. &gt;&gt; Who touched my clothes? Disciples said, "Everybody touching you." He said, "No, I felt virtue. Somebody pull out. Somebody withdraw. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She didn't she didn't have to have a long dress. She didn't have to look in messages and what not. No. Was that an ordinary sinner, a simple person who fed up give the doctor all the money and it didn't work. It's pressure pressure. Her husband telling her don't go to that small church. Don't hear that old noise. Husband terrorizing her. She said this time it dies it. When she wake up in the morning, she look in the mirror. She said I am going to be healed today. I'm getting a breakthrough today. I'm getting Holy Ghost today. I'm going to be touched today. She told herself. Some of you not even talking to God and God help me. Help you. You're not talking to yourself. Start to talk to yourself now. Tell yourself something now. I coming for a breakthrough. I coming for victory. I coming Hallelujah. to be inspire. Don't talk that. Talk to yourself. This woman, she told herself if I could touch. I know scripture for that. You know, she make up your own scripture. Okay. The Lord has shout. She believe what she said. If I could touch his garment. &gt;&gt; Not the man. &gt;&gt; She wasn't trying to touch his flesh. Not the man. &gt;&gt; Just the garment. &gt;&gt; I will remain whole. &gt;&gt; And God set it up. No, that's right. The him. &gt;&gt; Not even the garment. She going to hug the man. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. She said the hem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. him &gt;&gt; and God set it up that Jesus was standing there all alone and the woman come up to him and just touch him. Hallelujah. Glory. She touch him and she walk by hold and she come to church give her a testimony. Saints I was walking I see Jesus all by himself. And I touched him was made whole that not in the Bible you know. &gt;&gt; The Bible had that you know it had the crowd around Jesus. &gt;&gt; It had skeptics people from the papers news. has Facebook people people everybody has selfie now they see fight going on instead stop the fight they taking to get the fight &gt;&gt; they see in trouble instead of helping they they videotaping &gt;&gt; to put it on Facebook and put on their feet &gt;&gt; filming Jesus &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; big hardback men standing there some with hands folded &gt;&gt; some twiddling the bed some have their tall hats and whatn not all religious people there could some hard face some clueless some looking to see if he had bread around or fish Everybody had different inspiration around them. This woman pushing. Oh, excuse me. Hallelujah. Maybe she had a handbag and you throw it through the leg. She said, "I come in. I want me handbag." She pushing. She pushing. She have to get there somehow. I don't know how, but I have to get there. This Holy Ghost, I have to get there. I don't know how, but I got to get there. Are you desperate this morning? You've got to get there. Don't just look at me and stare. You got to get there. Hallelujah. Shout in the house. Hallelujah. She push. She press. She push. Some little church girls say, "Oh God, channel behavior." Forget that. Oh, give the Lord a shout. She push. She press. Well, she has some more decency. I like how she closed looking. You have so much of petty foolishness. I want us God to smoke that out to you. Who do you think you are? &gt;&gt; You think people not touching Jesus, &gt;&gt; but they gain nothing &gt;&gt; cuz they is no faith. &gt;&gt; The only no withdrawal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bank teller, they have no job to do. &gt;&gt; They're like an idol bank teller. When you go to the bank and you put your paper and you have money in the bank and you sign that paper and you put that there the bank tell get the money for you know &gt;&gt; that's how the law supposed to work but people touching Jesus and the paper sign and nothing coming out &gt;&gt; but when this woman touched he said who touched me &gt;&gt; who who touched me everybody touching it Jesus he said no no no no then he saw the woman &gt;&gt; oh god he saw her he said woman &gt;&gt; thy fit Lord, &gt;&gt; not my virtue. You know, he said, "I felt weak." Because when you withdraw, oh, give the Lord a shout, it have an effect. Oh, glory to God. How many want to make a withdrawal this morning? If you withdraw, it have an effect. He said, "I felt weak. I felt virtue left me." But when he took, look at the woman. He didn't talk about his virtue. He said, "Woman, die faith." And why did a prophet man be seated? Why did he send Malachi 4? To turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers, not to sitting on a bunch of bench and and have everything up in your head. &gt;&gt; Something have to move in this place, man. &gt;&gt; Someone to move in this message. Got &gt;&gt; some real intellectual giants in the message, &gt;&gt; not intellectual dwarfs. &gt;&gt; This is Goliath family. &gt;&gt; It's giants. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And put a man and prophesy that David's coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not e David. David's plural. &gt;&gt; They coming for them. &gt;&gt; Got them giants strong, you know. &gt;&gt; They big. They bad. They bold. They aggressive. They know the word. They know the mysteries. They have all kind of stuff behind them. You know, &gt;&gt; but they have no power. &gt;&gt; They have no real inspiration. &gt;&gt; God will deal with that. Every man-made system will fall. &gt;&gt; Every man-made kingdom would fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this morning, we serve and notice the giants. &gt;&gt; To every giant, &gt;&gt; there's a stone. &gt;&gt; There's a rock. &gt;&gt; We coming to get you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Why? Why we saying that? Because these giants pins down the church &gt;&gt; and pin down God's people. That's the issue with the giants. &gt;&gt; If you're by yourself and you have your giant fellowship and you have your giant party and and and weddings and so on, that's fine. &gt;&gt; But when the giant &gt;&gt; have God's people bound, &gt;&gt; that's different. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what David encountered, you know, &gt;&gt; 40 days. That's that's more than a month. &gt;&gt; More than a month Israel under pinn all send me a man to fight me. He's so big and bad. You a you ain't talking. &gt;&gt; Everybody silent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the sharpening sword. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They're fighting nothing. Polishing boots. &gt;&gt; Doing push-ups. &gt;&gt; Doing push-ups. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doing barbells. &gt;&gt; Going to the gym. &gt;&gt; Right. Training and whatnot. Nobody going to fight Gol. &gt;&gt; And when David come, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They try to belittle him. &gt;&gt; Don't let that belitting spirit be upon you. You know, be careful. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they start to be David. What you doing here? &gt;&gt; Who think? &gt;&gt; Who? Who think she? &gt;&gt; You come to see the battle. No battle going on, &gt;&gt; right? They're like a TV show for them. You know, 40 days, 40 nights, they watching Goliath on the screen. They watching TV. &gt;&gt; Hey, you come tomorrow, you know, same time, same channel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They telling David, you come and see the battle. They say, "All right. Okay, okay, okay. My father sent me some food. I bring it to church to chicken Kentucky fries. &gt;&gt; Little pizza. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I come to drop it. I gone. I gone. I gone. And as David said, I'll go. &gt;&gt; That day Golad come out. Send me a man &gt;&gt; to fight me. Well, David was so shocked &gt;&gt; because David didn't understand what's going on. David never saw Golad before. I know. So David see who is that &gt;&gt; uncircumcised &gt;&gt; Philistine &gt;&gt; in this message for so long. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is that? Then that go &gt;&gt; man. Man man get in trouble to pronounce your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go. Can Can you speak it so well? &gt;&gt; David had to give a testimony. &gt;&gt; I had sheep and and a bear come to take it and I kill him. &gt;&gt; A lion come and I kill him. &gt;&gt; My God. body feeling anointed. They hear his words voice his words anointed. They start to tell Saul this man here say Saul said come come. They want anybody to fight when they desperate something else. You know David is one of the smallest guy he qualified for the army. Said come come at take take away some shame for me &gt;&gt; because Saul offered him his daughter. All them brothers say they like her. Afterward stop liking all together. All they like you know friend nice sister nice. When they hear the man who go and fight Goliath, they say no no no I know nothing remember they like her lying offer David nothing come for money I come for woman I come for popularity then so offer David his armor it's freshly minted he a fighting himself and he bigger he tall &gt;&gt; he should he should have go out there &gt;&gt; he put this thing on David and David like them robots They walk in. So David walking. So David say um excuse me sir I this is pressure you know I think I can handle this thing you know this kind of break dancing kind of thing. So he can doing kind of thing. So David said I can't praise God with this thing. &gt;&gt; Let me get it off. &gt;&gt; They obliged to take it off and David go there. When David see Golad so and then then Golad recognized the man coming for him. He said am I a dog? &gt;&gt; This no respects. He he getting real vexing now. &gt;&gt; That is no respect. How you can find a little fella to fight me. &gt;&gt; He needs to finish reading seals. &gt;&gt; He never even complete his church's book. &gt;&gt; I'll feed him to the birds. &gt;&gt; And and David heard that. You see when the devil talk to you talk back. &gt;&gt; If you don't talk back, devil have you. &gt;&gt; David said cut it off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And David know he knew one stone be take up five. I love that. &gt;&gt; Take up five smooth stones. And the Bible said he ran to meet Goliath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's when you have revelation. That revelation no sword but cut your head off. That's f talking there. He ain't know where that sword coming. But he know that Golath is finished. Yeah. Walking timling foot buckling on him. Not that run. He know victory is nigh. I say we can run this morning because victory is nigh dynamic to the mechanics. The spirit of God will pour out. See that? We know the story. David loose David looses his sling. God directed his stone. Goliath fall down. &gt;&gt; Israel didn't move. You know &gt;&gt; when Goliath fell they didn't move you know &gt;&gt; you know when they move when they saw the head cut off &gt;&gt; they want to make sure the man dead there they moving you know &gt;&gt; that's how fearful they were there the man get knock out he get conscious yeah heart attack he get high blood pressure he get some kind of thing he brains going whoopsy and he come back again when they saw that head rolling down we win we win we win all of you And you know what happened to Saul? When them sisters bust a special s kill a thousand David 10,000 wrong special you know that special cause so much trouble in that camp after s go that man come from a crown want to kill him but David already anointed &gt;&gt; to be king and I want to tell you the prophecy over your life this morning you are already anointed whether you feel it or you don't feel it. It's over your life. Hallelujah. Let God work it out. &gt;&gt; But it's over your life. Kings and priests unto God and we shall reign on the earth. There's a power to strike the church. He said when the power of this church rises, it will bring the brethren. May it rise today. May it rise with you. May it rise in your heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be born of the water and spirit &gt;&gt; brings us back to the spoken word &gt;&gt; like it was in John 3. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be born of water and spirit. What does it do? It bring you right back to the place where you should have been from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Let's go back now in Genesis. Adam was to reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; The wife given to him was to reproduce another son. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By spoken word. &gt;&gt; So Adam was supposed to speak into Eve. &gt;&gt; She conceived and another spoken word son comes out. &gt;&gt; Because of the fall it fell into sex. &gt;&gt; So then it fall now into the human six sense five five senses and so on. The first teaching Jesus brought was you must be born again &gt;&gt; of the word &gt;&gt; and the spirit. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was pointing them right back to what it was supposed to be in the beginning. &gt;&gt; So when you are born again is not of your mother, &gt;&gt; not of your father. &gt;&gt; This is a second birth. &gt;&gt; This is the new birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the question Nicodemus have, can a man enter his mother's womb a second time? Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus say, but oh gosh, you in this business long time and that's where you going to talk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How supposed to work? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let me read it. Acts John 3. There was a man in the Pharisees named Nicodemus. &gt;&gt; John 3 chapter one, a ruler of the Jews. &gt;&gt; The same came to Jesus by night, said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou were a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him. And Jesus answers unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom." &gt;&gt; Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born?" And Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of the water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. &gt;&gt; So clearly he is saying you sir are born of the flesh. &gt;&gt; The birth I'm talking about is of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; I'm happy tonight to know that there are people that still believe in the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; I do not believe in the social gospel we have today. &gt;&gt; These cults going around saying there is no such thing as the blood and the Holy Spirit. You are not a Christian when you do that. You can't be a Christian without being born again. &gt;&gt; That's right. You can't be no matter what you try to pro profess. He said no man can say Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you're just taking what somebody said, you're going to be that what someone said. You will never know it until the Holy Ghost has filled you with his presence and witnessed to you that he is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and it is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. You are a time being until you are born again. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. &gt;&gt; You are a time being until you are born again. then you are eternal being &gt;&gt; and the only way you can get it is to have part of God in you &gt;&gt; which is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. Now remember he didn't say you ought to be born again. He said you must. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is absolutely you've got to do it. Not you ought to. Not you're better off if you're dead but you must. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then if it is that essential and that great and it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until we born again and so many different interpretations of that word born again, we ought to seek it out with all our hearts to find out what it means. &gt;&gt; So no matter how we try to think we are right in saying a creed or joining a church, you are still what you were until you are born again. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So people joining churches, joining groups, changing their beliefs does that doesn't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; You are what you are &gt;&gt; your soul by what's in your heart. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So he said now watch until you actually born again of the spirit of God. It doesn't change you. Your creed joining church changing your ideas your good intentions as good as it might be is still not right. There is something got to happen. There's the key here. Something have to happen. The new birth is an experience. something taking place. So it can't just be a hearing the word. Something have to happen operational in your heart. An experimental experience where men get right with God. Something happen on the inside that nobody can explain. You can't explain it. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise God. Praise God. There's a song they sing. Something got a hold of me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something got a hold of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was in that meeting that night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my heart went bright, but something got a hold of me. It was the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost. Oh, give the Lord a shout. I the message don't want but we want it. It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something must take place. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Brother Abraham says, "We reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us that we were all born in sin, shaped iniquity, come to the world speaking lies." Then that shows our nature to begin with is sinful to start with. &gt;&gt; So you can't start with you and your good behavior. Leave a child on his own, the child will go in one direction in the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you you could be pastor pastor child deacon child that child doesn't matter &gt;&gt; because of their nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bible say they born in sin you know. &gt;&gt; So how your children is sin this sin that &gt;&gt; how you think your child is so special &gt;&gt; that is foolishness. &gt;&gt; How you think you are special so special better than who? serious. &gt;&gt; I want to preach something and tell them I want you to think there's not emotions. &gt;&gt; I want you to think through. &gt;&gt; You are better than who? Your children or child is better than which child? &gt;&gt; Think about time and chance happen to all men. &gt;&gt; Time and chance happen to all men. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; Then it shows our nature to begin with is sinful to start with. We are no good to begin with. So we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness, our sincerity, how great we are or how little we are. &gt;&gt; We are all together wrong to begin with. &gt;&gt; We are all together &gt;&gt; wrong. There is nothing at all we can do about it. Jesus said who by taking thought can add one cubit to his statue. You can think all your thoughts, all you're dreaming, read it, study it, examine it, everything else. That can't help yourself one iota. So just throw it all out. &gt;&gt; I have a word for you. Throw it all out. I am so glad it does. He said because it laid in the thought of knowing something smart, we poor illiterate person be left out. All right. The churches always make it complicated. God makes it simple. &gt;&gt; And I said something I think last service. God likes clarity because his burden was that his sea is so mysterious. He want to know how to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; So therefore say God revealed himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; So God is interested in clarity even till two habac right the vision and make it plain &gt;&gt; not make it complex. So as we get nearer to the coming of the Lord it's supposed to be simpler &gt;&gt; less complex &gt;&gt; because we getting nearer to love &gt;&gt; and love doesn't make you act a little stupidy you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I say stupid in the sense of when brother Brandon faced the bull, he spoke to the bull. &gt;&gt; Who speaks to the bull? &gt;&gt; Not madness. Can you say bull between the vials and the woos and the trumpets and the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet just between have something inside of there and the six v six seed and seven seed. If he had told her to the bull, the bull lick him up and &gt;&gt; he forget to kill a bull. &gt;&gt; Walking through the field, he forget his gun. He said if he had the gun, he shoot the bull, pay for the bull, no problem. &gt;&gt; There's a there's logic. &gt;&gt; Pow. &gt;&gt; Not kill a bull. You know, I killed the bull. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But something came over him &gt;&gt; and love take a hold upon him. He had no fear for the bull and the bull snorting coming for him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Bull, I'm a servant of Jesus Christ. I'm passing through the field to pray to pray for some man that's sick." He said, "I didn't mean to disturb you. &gt;&gt; Go back and lie down." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, when he said go back and lie down, the bull was on his way. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the bull saying all right. You know that, you know, the bull was already charging heading down for the prophet. No, it screech. It match breaks &gt;&gt; and then turn around. I'm going to lie down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I wish this could happen &gt;&gt; all the time." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it means that same veil that Adam had, that Eve had before the fall, that anointing, that covering, that cover your imagination, your conscience, your memory, your affection, your reasoning, that Holy Ghost. Hey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That that's coming back. That is coming back. &gt;&gt; That is coming back. &gt;&gt; So if if you in your senses, you ain't talking to no bull. &gt;&gt; Because humans don't talk to bull. &gt;&gt; That's what it looks like. But when you go back to the garden of Eden, when you see where God tell Adam have dominion over cattle and the beast, Adam could tell the B move so so so all your head. So &gt;&gt; mountain move so he was in speaking terms and he had the spoken word and that's why Jesus could say if you shall say to this mountain sin mark and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say &gt;&gt; because he know we are sons. Notice the angels are servants but we are sons. The angel directed Philillip, but Philillip had the germ. &gt;&gt; God called you. You are sons. Angels are here to assist you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Give the Lord a praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, watch. &gt;&gt; I love this one. &gt;&gt; Now, no man could save the other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's one B. It makes no difference what anyone's tried to say. No man can save another no matter how smart what his office is. Let him be a pastor, priest, bishop, cardinal or pope. He cannot have one thing to do with savings any man's life because he's a sinner himself. So all these message popes who think you know Simon the sorcerer thought he was a very great man. Bible said that you know Simon the sorcerer this man doing magic voodoo obia wherever they have necromancy whatever they have now whatever they call witchcraft &gt;&gt; and he joined the church &gt;&gt; he get baptized &gt;&gt; he get baptized in her &gt;&gt; and when he saw the power demonstrated &gt;&gt; he say how I getting that &gt;&gt; he offer money &gt;&gt; he was willing to pay because he wanted to Stay great. &gt;&gt; He was an image consultant. He was an image man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He want to keep that great image. &gt;&gt; He doing magic. Now he that kind of magic power that I don't have &gt;&gt; God judged that foolishness in &gt;&gt; because he wanted to continue his foolishness in the church. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we got to keep our eye out for for Simon the sorcerer. &gt;&gt; All you laugh. That's the book of acts here. &gt;&gt; We still in the book of acts now. &gt;&gt; There's going to be another book of acts. &gt;&gt; So you have to expect analysis of &gt;&gt; you can expect dynamics. You can expect ton of the sorcerer. You can the whole gamut of the book of acts you know but we going to write the this will be a continuation of the book of acts. &gt;&gt; All right. What? So regardless of the office a man holds be it pastor, priest, bishop, cardinal or pope, he cannot have one thing to do with man's s in life because he's a sinner to begin with. Born in sin and shaping iniquity come speaking lies. He's a liar to begin with and any word that he would be a lie if it's contrary to God's word and plan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we go. If the Virgin Mary &gt;&gt; had to go in the upper room &gt;&gt; and stay there &gt;&gt; till she was filled with the Holy Spirit in such a way till she staggered like a woman that was drunk &gt;&gt; under strong drink. &gt;&gt; How are you going to get in anything less than that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now this Mary mind you the same Mary that say turn unto me according &gt;&gt; years ago I was telling us about the Holy Ghost not the church and she tell me about Mary say word I say that Mary upper room she said I never thought about that you see it's cool to say word &gt;&gt; it done no experience no fire no nothing bride ghost without sensation But Mary has to go in the upper room. Hear what the prophet says here. &gt;&gt; The reason Mary had to go in the day up at the day of Pentecost and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like the rest of them did is because she was born here as a mortal &gt;&gt; and had to be born again before she could go to heaven &gt;&gt; and she give birth to Jesus. So our humanness cannot make it. &gt;&gt; Our effort cannot make it. &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags. So we cannot present ourselves. We have to present the blood sacrifice &gt;&gt; that Christ has died for us. &gt;&gt; And that blood is what is speaking on our behalf. &gt;&gt; To give us the victory over the world and over sin and over everything else. &gt;&gt; Could we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be born of the spirit. Here we go. is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And a man that is born of the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what traditions tell him. &gt;&gt; What to be born means to be birthed from above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then that kingdom is so much higher than this kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit. is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is the Christ and this is the word &gt;&gt; and no other words can be added to it or taken from it without your name taken out of the book of life. That's a strong one. Born again means birthe it from above. &gt;&gt; So your vibes, the atmosphere you live in is from above. &gt;&gt; So when Bar is on the platform and he's praying for the sick people and you see a man come up there &gt;&gt; and he said you're not here for sickness. He said, "You're a preacher. &gt;&gt; You're a Christian. &gt;&gt; You here for revival." &gt;&gt; What what what what is he picking up? What what what is the discernment of that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The man's spirit. &gt;&gt; So I like to say this way. Somebody's spirit, let's say it is like colors then. So if you're dishonest, that have a color vibration. &gt;&gt; If you're insincere, that have a color vibration with it. &gt;&gt; And somebody in the spirit could see that see see it. And if you're clear and honest, that that also vibrates. &gt;&gt; So people actually walk with atmospheres. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said there some people you don't want to be around them at all &gt;&gt; just because of the atmosphere that's around them. &gt;&gt; So you could create the atmosphere you want around your life. &gt;&gt; By the things you say, by how you live, by what you think, by what you speak, &gt;&gt; it create a certain atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Do you want that? &gt;&gt; Remember we born with a certain nature. You know, &gt;&gt; so you may want you may have a lot of temper. You might be a temper fighting a bus show and whatnot. But that don't mean that you evil or wicked. You know that just how your nature is. &gt;&gt; Our next person might be very impatient. They can't they can't wait. They blow the top if somebody come late or something. So our next person So all of us have different qualities, different things. But all of us need help from the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Say sweet your temper with prayer. Sometime your grandfather had it, your great grandfather something passed down. I don't know how it does work but it is passed down &gt;&gt; but you want to have the right attitude &gt;&gt; because you want your breakthrough. And if you see all kind of contrary take passing down. You see how it stop right here? You know &gt;&gt; you don't want to pass it down any further and stop right here. You know you kill it. &gt;&gt; You said this d right here. So &gt;&gt; all right. &gt;&gt; So I trust you blessed this morning. &gt;&gt; I ain't finished yet. You know I'm feeling strong like a &gt;&gt; I feel like a good two three four hours right now. They say woo &gt;&gt; I'm to the pastor today boy. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to dismiss already? Are you ready yet? I am so relaxed this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for your prayer. &gt;&gt; Some it means that you're praying for me. All right let's go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch this here now. What is the seed of life? The word of God. His word is a seed. &gt;&gt; Here we go. And his spirit is the water. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word of God. And he was busted open that life. The life is inside the seed. And this life which is spirit, water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; He Jesus was the seed that Eve should have produced. So he was that seed and the only way life could be in the reproduction of life had to come through that seed. That seed had to die in order to spread out the life. &gt;&gt; So that is why come back to the scripture we read Jesus said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. This spake he of the spirit &gt;&gt; that they would receive because the Holy Ghost was not yet given. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was not yet glorified. For him to be glorified, he have to go and die. &gt;&gt; And when he die, the spirit released and that was the beginning of the end of Satan. &gt;&gt; Because once his spirit is released, he going to pick up the seeds upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is you &gt;&gt; that was hidden &gt;&gt; under darkness. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh God have mercy to. Do you get that now? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When darkness covered the earth, God's darkness and and and darkness was upon the face of the deep, the spirit of God moved upon the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; But the sea was already under there. &gt;&gt; Do you understand the sea was already there? &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be light." The light break forth so the sea could come forth. So God put you in Laia. God put you in this world. God put you under darkness. And this message come with even light. Let there be light. And here you are. You are going to come forward. Give the Lord some praising. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Oh, we on your home stretch. &gt;&gt; Let me So, um I'm now on page 12. Uh 15 pages. So, just pages. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. &gt;&gt; The reason that God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus is because he was the seed word. All right. &gt;&gt; The germ word itself, the germ that was inside the seed and the life in the seed. He was the germ word of God. So Jesus had to be broken open in order for that seed to let forth his life to water other seed that was coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So he just died on Calvary for my sins. He died to release the spirit. This spirit that you are to receive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; Watch. He said, watch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In order for that seed to let forth his life to water other seeds coming even he said other sheep I have of this fool. This they were going to see that they are going to get that word and say right with it and I'm sending forth my spirit to water it. &gt;&gt; All God sons must be the same. &gt;&gt; To be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to the spoken word again. Almost done. What was he? He became a man. God made flesh dwell among us. Isn't that right? And washed by the and then in him dwelt in him. There come the life of God manifesting himself through Christ. God was in Christ. The anointed one. Christ being the anointed one. A man that was anointed. God dwelling in him. What was it? Here we go. The germ with the flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The anointed one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Flesh &gt;&gt; being anointed &gt;&gt; with the spirit of God &gt;&gt; produced the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when you say the spirit is upon me &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me. &gt;&gt; He being that germ word, &gt;&gt; the fullness of the spirit, &gt;&gt; he was full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He had the fullness of God dwelt in him bodily. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Then the Holy Spirit was in him &gt;&gt; come down to water the word to make it grow. What is it? God manifesting continuing the work of his first son, his only begotten and died for our high breeding life that he might reconcile us back to be sons of daughters of God that through the church. Here we go. Might flow the same life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the word continue to work and manifested in Christ. The Bible has got to be in you. The word is a seed. As long as it's laying here, it won't do nothing. But when it comes into here, when it comes into the heart, it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit. The works of God, then vision comes, then power comes, then humility comes. All you know it all is gone. You become nothing. Christ becomes alive. You die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There it is. Cuz he died, I live. When I die, he lives again. When I die, he promised me life. And I died out of myself in order that I can have life. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Almost done. So then you watch. So the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ. Cuz you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was. &gt;&gt; Just like Christ was. Just like Christ was. You are today a predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Are you ready? Oh my. He said now though these disciples were predestinated seed and they hauled themselves up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the upper room, &gt;&gt; these seeds, &gt;&gt; the word was laying there without life in it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember earlier we talked about the kingdom. The word turned into power and spirit. &gt;&gt; Mission come please. &gt;&gt; Remember that. &gt;&gt; Here he said the disciples had the word in them &gt;&gt; laying in them without life. And watch something. And all of a sudden, here come a sound from heaven. &gt;&gt; As the waters begin to gush down, it actually fill all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow. It begin to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; So I am seeing how the birth is coming now. &gt;&gt; The seed can only come through the body. I'm closing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1 11-14. in whom also we obtain an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. That we who should who who we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted. Here we go. After you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not when you believe. After you believe, God put the seal upon you. &gt;&gt; That seal of the Holy Spirit promised, which is the earnest of inheritance until the redemption of the purch possession, &gt;&gt; unto the praise of his glory. &gt;&gt; I'm finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want to close off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With this story from Cornelius. And I'm going to read first Acts 1:2 and then go down to 21. Let's read it quickly and we're going to close. There was a certain man in Cesarian named Cornelius, &gt;&gt; a centurion of the band called the Italian band. description of this man. &gt;&gt; A devout man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One that feared God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With all his house. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which give much arms to the people and pray to God always. &gt;&gt; Acts 10:21. So we find out this is what we want to get to to be like him. just &gt;&gt; devout, &gt;&gt; giving, praying always, &gt;&gt; fear God. &gt;&gt; That is the atmosphere that Cornelius was in. &gt;&gt; God tell him send for Peter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The angel dealing with Peter to go to Cornelius's house. &gt;&gt; Now watch how this match now the condition. Cornelius is not rotten in spirit. He means the devil getting trouble. He carrying any cussing. No, no. Just devout, worshshiping, freegiver, helpful, a man who have a testimony. That's the man who sent for Peter. &gt;&gt; Begin to close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter went down to the men which was sent unto him for Cornelius. Behold, I am he whom you seek. They said, Cornelius, he had the testimony. A centurion, a just man, not so church member, you know, not no man told in Bible. He's a centurion, a just man, one that feared of God, of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by holy angel to send foreign to his house and to hear words of thee. Then call ye him, lodged them, and on the more Peter went. And what Peter took him up and saying, okay, I'll skip down. Let me go down there. Verse 30. And Cornelius said, four days ago, I was fasting. All right. He say I want to do church fasting this week. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; his fasting was personal. &gt;&gt; His fasting because he want to seek God. He want to hear from God. He didn't know God yet, but he is fasting. &gt;&gt; And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour. And the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me a bright clothing and said, Cornelius, thy prayers heard. that arms uh had a remembrance in the sight of God. His giving was remembered by God. God recognized the heart of that man. &gt;&gt; Let's go. All right. Send unto Japa. Call Simon whose name is Peter. He lodged in the house. And immediately I sent for thee and is well done that thou would come. Now therefore we are present before God to hear all things that are commanded of thee of God. Then Peter opened his mouth and said, "Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respector of persons, but in every nation, he that feared him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him. The word which God sent in his children." And he began to preach how God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost from with power went about doing good and healing all that oppressed the devil. And we are witness of these things. And they slew him, hang him on the tree, and God raised him on the third day and whatnot. And he commanded us to preach the gospel to him gave all the prophet witness. And while Peter spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word. And they that of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came of Peter because on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. And I'm saying to you today from this day go forward expect come believing that God will pour it upon you the Holy Ghost because you heard the word you received the word and God going to fill you with the Holy Ghost. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh give the Lord some praise. Could we stand? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Brother Kelly, share something with me. He said this message called the unpardonable sin. I don't believe there's any man or woman could ever face Jesus Christ and truly repent of their sins with a true full surrendered heart saying, "Lord, I truly believe. But what God would place on them, the baptism of the Holy Ghost right at that time, let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I've preached your word. I've shared what I believe you put upon my heart to share with your people.

Draw me deeper and deeper that I may your heart. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? You appreciate the Lord today. Appreciate the service. You appreciate the presence of the Lord. You appreciate your pastor this morning. What an anointed, timely, in season message. As brother OIT said as he was speaking during the service, he said you have to go listen to it again. There is so much that was said this morning. And God bless you, brother O. May God strengthen you. May he anoint you, continue to use you, and we pray that the word finds good ground. &gt;&gt; We do have a note of praise this morning from Sister Stephanie Knights. Greetings in the precious name of the Lord. I want to thank God for our safe return and for allowing Somaya to see another year. Happy new year to all and may God richly bless you. So, welcome back. May God bless you richly. We do have two prayer requests. One from sister Anmarie Steel. I would like that you can pray for my granddaughter Zaniah. I believe she has fallen under the sickness of constant fever, headache, and other medical problems. And I would like for you to pray that she would get better. And we also want to uh remember, please pray for my dad Andy DDA. He is a dialysis patient and has developed an infection. We are trusting God for complete healing and strength. from Sister Abigail uh DDA Harry. So, we want to remember them in prayer. And if there's anyone this morning that you want to show by raising your hands as we approach the throne of grace this morning, you know, as brother preached, that woman uh who wanted to touch the hem of his garment, you know. So, if you have a need this morning and you want to make a withdrawal this morning and you want to raise your hands, you might be here in the sanctuary downstairs on the live stream or even if you're watching this tape after the fact as we approach the throne of grace this morning. Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning for words of eternal life and how it quickened our hearts Lord to be reminded Lord of who we are and who's we are and the promise that belongs to us and the requirements for us and Lord the great divine purpose that you express through your word and father that you send this great Elijah prophet to ensure that we could see in the word what's applicable for our day our time our season and how you use your manservant our pastor to Lord bring a present tense reality of spiritual food in due season. Lord, our hearts are truly burning within us and rejoicing to see Lord the unfolding of every promise in the word and to see the signs and the times and all these things and we have stood behind this sacred desk so many times and brought Lord prayer requests to you and time and time again we have seen your healing touch. We have seen your miracle working power. We have seen prayer requests become notes of praises, Father. And Lord, we want to bring Lord Zaniah before you, Father. Lord, under this sickness of fever and headache and all these medical problems. And Lord, there's no medical problem you cannot handle. There's no sickness you cannot deal with. And Lord, there are so many others struggling with these same symptoms. Lord, we pray there God for a complete and total healing in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord, Lord, not just for her, but for everyone else with these same symptoms, these same issues, these same challenges, Satan, the blood of Jesus is against you. We apply the blood. We plead the blood. We make a withdrawal this morning, knowing who we are, knowing that the there's power in the church of the living God, over every sickness, over every disease, Father. So Lord, may this request come back as a note of praise and for Lord Andy DDA, Father. Lord, coming down with an infection, Lord, with the dialysis condition is an infection on top of a problem that's already there, but Father, we plead the blood this morning. And we say, Father, not just deal with the infection, but the very reason for dialysis in the first place. Lord, you are a miracle working God. You are still a mighty healer. You are still Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah Ni, you are still El Shai. You are still the everpresent help in time of trouble in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord, may we find Diddy wherever he is. And may the angel of the Lord move into that room, Father, and touch and heal from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. And for Father, every request that was raised here this morning, every hand that was raised this morning, every plea, every cry, whatever it might be, be it physical, mental, financial, family, situation, there's nothing you cannot handle. We bring your people before you. We bring every request before you. We say, Father, may you do a work upon your people, Father. May you touch each brother, touch each sister, touch those that are here, touch those that are connected online, touch those that would watch the tape. May you bring strength back to Lord, your son and servant, our pastor, brother over this morning. May you touch him with the crown of his head to the soul of his feet. May you bless his wife, Lord. May you bless the ministers. May you bless the elders, the deacons, the ushers, the trustees, the musicians, the technical team, the Sunday school team, hospitality, parking, every ministry, every office, every help, every government. We hand the church to you, Father. May you have your perfect way upon your people. And may you bring us back at the appointed time, Father, in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ, Father. Lord, may you be with your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, "Amen. Amen. And amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. Amen. Firstly, we'd like to welcome brother Kurt Beckles. God bless you, brother Beckals from Lighthouse Tabernacle Tokco. God bless you. So happy to have you here with us in fellowship by the grace of God. Amen. So for we have a few announcements uh well that we'd like you to take uh note of. Uh firstly uh this coming Wednesday there will be no physical service here at the tabernacle. It'll be a live stream service. So uh please note there'll be no physical service here at the tabernacle. The service will be a live stream. So connect uh have uh uh create that space that level of reverence and we'll connect to that service live uh this coming Wednesday by the grace of God. This coming Friday there will be no service this coming Friday. Our next service after our live stream on Wednesday will be next Sunday Lord willing back at the house of the Lord. Next Sunday Lord willing in particular we will have a special baptism service after the service. There's already one candidate that's under schedule to be baptized next Sunday uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And after the service today uh or during this week, if you are interested in being baptized, speak to one of the elders or the deacons so we can uh add you to that list. If you are interested in being baptized uh next Sunday, Lord willing, we'll have a special baptism service after this service next Sunday. Uh Lord willing uh you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. And just uh continuing a bit um in two weeks exactly which is on the 25th uh the final Sunday of this month. After that service we will have a special question and answer service. Uh this came out of a burden for the young people but by extension we know that there are many who would be blessed by it as well. there. It is not a question and answer on a specific topic. It is if you have a question and answer on your heart, we cannot guarantee we'll get to answer every single question. But we do want to have a pulse and certainly um an understanding or a means to be able to help you along the journey. The Bible says to be ready to give an answer, you know, and if there's a question, brother Brandham himself had many services that were around questions and answers so he could help the people along the journey. So we did this some time ago and we want to be able to have another session again. So the last Sunday of this month we have dedicated to having a special question and answer service. So if you have a question on your heart um we have also made it easy. You don't need to put your name. You don't need to come and and disclose it directly. There's a box downstairs. Uh it currently says suggestion box. Um don't be stumbled by that. It is the question and answer box. All right. So feel free to write your question and submit it anonymously. Um you can start doing that as early yesterday and certainly next Sunday as well so that during the course of uh next week Lord willing we'll prepare the responses and by the grace of God have a time where we could um help the church along that way. Um in keeping with that as well on that day we are trying to put together a very small refreshment package for those who would be interested in that type of refreshment. a very nominal cost of $25. Um so if you're interested in um participating in that refreshment activity, we'd ask you to reregister so we could make provisions. Alternatively, you are free to walk with your own refreshment if if that's the case. Um but we certainly want to have the option available to you um if you want to participate in that as well. Um again, it is open to the entire church and we believe and trust it'll be a blessing to the entire church um with a focus on the young people uh in particular as well. So we trust that that communicates that clearly. We'd have sent this out via the WhatsApp group, but this just brings a bit more clarity and a bit more focus uh upon it as well. Um let me just check something here. Okay. So, those are the main ones. So, in addition, we'd ask ROI and myself, we're asking you to remember us in prayer um during the course of this week. Uh he'll be traveling to the US. And I'm heading over to Nigeria. So, remember us in prayer um as we enter this new year uh trusting the Lord to take care of his people and his purpose and his plan. Remember us uh in prayer as well. and maintenance team group three is carded to serve today. Please meet with mother Andy Henry after the service and next week uh Lord willing group five is carded to serve which is uh brother Blackman's group is carded to serve. I also have a a note here if we just want to go back to prayer one more time. Brother Anthony O'Brien is not feeling well. So we want to remember him in prayer. Let's just bow our heads one more time. Heavenly Father, we want to remember your servant, brother Anthony, at this time, Lord. Lord, not feeling well and praying that the angel of the Lord would meet him at the point of his need and touch your servant completely from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, Father. May you restore his strength. May you, Lord, bring a speedy recovery, Father. And Lord, we commit, Lord, him completely into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. So, I believe I have everything covered. So, just one more time, uh, service will be a live stream service only this coming Wednesday. There'll be no service this coming Friday. Next Sunday, Lord willing, after the service, there'll be a baptism service. We already have one candidate scheduled. If you are interested in being baptized, speak with one of the deacons or the elders and we'll uh work towards facilitating that. And then the last Sunday of this month, special question and answer service. Uh we invite you to submit your questions anonymously in the suggestion box downstairs. And if you are interested in participating in the refreshments that will be made available, the cost is $25 and we'd ask you to register for catering purposes. Outside of that, you're free to walk with your own refreshments. So may the Lord richly bless you. Have a wonderful week by the grace of God and may God keep you. Brother Jason. Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus, come ushers. Even so, and take your bride away. For my soul longs to be with you, my Lord. Even so, even so. Come Lord Jesus come. Oh, even so, come Lord Jesus come.
