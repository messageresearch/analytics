your word when the enemy come like a flood the spirit raises standard father god we prayer is the standard this morning in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you and welcome if your bible is allocated to any bibles to two portions of scripture this morning acts 1 verse 8 and 1st corinthians chapter 12 i want to read 12-14 just two scriptures this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord acts 1 8 it's in red jesus speaking but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you so you tell you when you get in power and you shall be witnesses unto me so she's telling me who you're going to be with yourself when you get this holy ghost to come upon you by giving your power you shall be witness unto me both in jerusalem and north judea and in samaria and the uttermost part of the earth first corinthians chapter 12 1 verse 12. paul for us the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ so he's given a comparison here okay for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many may god bless his word you may be seated so i think by now you know how we operate we have no extra boost this morning we go straight to the board all right um i know some ministers and you're on the way to run donkey take off the machine that we have here is a little different let's take off someone just zoom like that have no runway there okay so the amplifier the descriptor we read first corinthians 12 because the title this morning is by one spirit are we all baptized into one body that's the title this morning by one spirit we are all baptized into one body so this is the amplified for just as the body is a unity talk about our bodies and has many parts and all the parts though many form only one body so your body are many parts but it's one body okay so it is with christ the messiah the anointed one for by means of personal agency of one holy spirit we were all whether jews or greeks slaves are free baptized baptized united together into one body and all made to drink of one holy spirit that's why we say the holy spirit cannot behave in one person and believe in another person something is wrong it's one holy spirit isn't that right for the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many your physical body is not a han only or knows only it's of many and that's how christ's body is so you can say you don't need the foot you don't need the hand you're feeling like of our nose this morning because you ain't want to smell that is your business god put all these different parts in the body to make up this body and that is why you're beginning to see that you need the brethren you need others you need everybody to come into this into that place not church but the body oh give the lord some praises hallelujah let's go [Applause] then each night we want every person that's not a christian hope something will be said or done that you become a christian and if you're not if you already believe in the lord jesus and accept him and have been baptized that is in water now and you haven't received the holy ghost as yet don't let this get by just let this be your night because remember there is just so many names on that book and when the last name is added that's all of it and yours might complete it oh blessed be the name of the lord there are so many names on that book and your name might complete it no and the last name goes on that book and then he changes it or the last name that's redeemed that was put on that book oh glory to god the last name that was redeemed that was put on the book that settles it he comes to claim what he has redeemed and it might be a strange time did you ever think people will go on right on preaching the church will go right on even thinking they're getting people saved it's too late then it's over see the message will go to the total lost oh praise god so there's another game this is the word of god oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him this morning blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord how do we get into this christ by one spirit he said not even one fellowship this is brother the first thing comes first by one church no by one letter no by one creed people pumping the creed pumping the teaching is by one teaching we all believe the same thing tick tick tick like if it's a ticking course it's not by one creed it's not my one church it's not my own teaching it's by the spirit the baptism of the spirit and just as you go down in water baptism and go yes the man take you and dip you down and you come back up god has to take him deep in the spirit and you come back up oh that's what the baptism is like just as they go along in water the others gotta go down and come up with it oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory that's what calvary is about that's why jesus died to make sure and ensure that the spirit reaches you oh glory to god when he says finish the devil didn't understand that the devil was finished that's why he could find you in your sin find you an adultery fornication back sitting he could still find you because there's seven spirits going throughout you all here that spirit found you in trinidad you will find this message this message from you oh give the lord a shout you're not called by a man you're called by the spirit of god no man could come except accept no no fightful call you it's the spirit call you not no man call you is the spirit call you man could speak the word but the spirit makes the call when the spirit make the call or glory to god the devil can't stop when the spirit makes the call not by might not by power but by my spirit all glory to god god went to baptizing this morning god went to failure today god with the seal you want to bomb the devil out of your heart and blow up all the corruption in your spirit and put fire in your soul he wants to put you in oil and put the other path on you on fire god want to do that this morning you don't want to be a church more smack back member oh glory to god just going to church until you're going in some rapture because you believe a message you're all glory to god you are believing a lie you have to be filled with the holy ghost oh glory to god only the holy ghost phil go in praise god vaccine or no vaccine whether you take the vaccine or not it doesn't matter only the holy ghost goats fail this going glory to god not taking the vaccine is the seal not taking the vaccine the holy ghost the devil deceive you with that foolishness oh glory to god you're gonna be filled with the holy ghost well if you're ready to go over yonder you could take and get coronavirus and die and go over yonder that's your business but we will alive and remain shall not hinder them that our sleep oh glory to god i'm going to be here i want to be here i'm fighting to be here if the devil could take you out he will take you out but god must have somebody who's alive and remain oh glory to god hallelujah my god my god this message is real oh god really delivers god could really set you free the five god god to touch you this morning

church and more talk and more long drawn out service boarding ahead with mysteries we're not journeying for that we journey in all the mysteries out to become spirit we are turning into our kingdom that's what abram was looking for he was seeking us he was making god he wasn't looking for more people praise god a city who's making belarus god and when jesus came he said when they say here go there go they say forget it he said behold the kingdom of god is where within you who give the lord a shout what is jesus talking about he's talking about the holy ghost that they don't want to touch he's talking about the holy you know what the holy ghost does it takes the man out of the way okay the lord i shout you could study and preach where you want to preach i could study and study and study but when the holy ghost comes it pushes man out the way because the holy ghost wants to have the preeminences in your life [Music] and to get that and to get there you have to die die to

he have the things to unlock he has the key and when the kingdom of god is being unveiled you have to get the man that is in the body there are people out the body and in the body there are five four ministers in the body and there are those who alter the body all glory to god but by one spirit you are baptized into the body when you're baptized into the body you have a spirit connection you have a source you have a power source that not from foreign not from overseas not from some church not from some man but you see what here today always a source that is here it's an anointing that is here i am drawing from that and has he give me i could give you oh glory to god as you anoint me you could be anointed as it flow as it flow as i give as i get i could give i can't give you what i don't have oh glory to god god i can only give what is released to me to give to you or give the lord some praises and he said as my father sent me so send are you we gonna get some sent ones or people just went but there are doors that god will send or give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah are you gonna find out this is a team of every apostle there are people playing that puzzle saying they are possible what is your team there's a team of every apostle what's the team have you received the holy ghost since you believe this is the team of every are possible not how much mystery you believe how much teaching you receive but have you received what you sensed you believe you have something to get or give the lord a shout out [Music] if we are non-slaying the pulpit after service there's cake and ice cream downstairs anybody could get the whosoever will that's the word from on top here if you see ice cream and kicks you downstairs and you walk past it that's your business you don't want it it's free you don't have that knowing i'm just saying that don't even think about it i just making a point but up to you to go and receive it now when you receive it now you see somebody eating ice cream and cake you don't know how it tasted because you're not tasting it you have to get it yourself you say what tasting real good oh there's a nice but you would taste it your lips could be dripping and dribbling dribbling your mouth watering for this thing but until you taste it you don't know what tasting like i tell you this thing eating nice this thing tasted nice if you never taste it before come and taste it come and get it your husband can't give you this your wife can't give you this your children can give you this the money in your bank i'll give you this the job you have can give you this just think about it but you could get it oh glory to god give the lord some praises amen my god he said not by the known of hands not by teaching but by one spirit we are all baptized into one body not by teaching yes all this teaching position peace believes by teaching not by teaching but by one spirit hold up one spirit one spirit we are baptized into the body which body some church this is not the church christ billionaire this is the building we built with concrete and cement christ i built this and we build this the one at the church he's talking about upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it that's the body he's talking about [Applause] all right question by one spiritual baptized into the body of christ he said you remember that was the question i was on now that's found of course in first corinthians 12 at the time you reached somebody asking the question we received the new birth this takes place is this the baptism of the holy spirit or is there a later baptism or is it a filling but a brand of answer no this is quite a question we could spend the rest of our time right on that one tonight and tomorrow night and so forth but it would take and tie the entire bible together every scripture must probably be tied together every other scripture in the bible but just trying to make it just as briefly plain as i know how to make it no when you believe in the lord jesus christ then you have the new birth when you believe on the lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the holy ghost see you got the new birth when you believe you've got eternal life it's a gift of god that's given to you to sovereign grace by accepting the gift of god given to you he that here at my words and believe it on him that sent me heart eating a life as everlasting life that's the new birth you have converted this means you are turn around but the baptism of the holy spirit puts you into the body of christ subject to the gifts for service it doesn't make you any more of a christian it just puts you into the body of gifts now by one spirit first corinthians 12 we all baptize into one body now says paul said there are different gifts and in this body is nine spiritual gifts in this body you have to be baptized into the body to possess one of these gifts they come with the body but now as far as having eternal life being a christian you're a christian the moment you believe no not not make believe that is truly believe on the lord jesus and accept him as your personal savior you are born again right there and have eternal life god comes into you but watch eternal life you don't hear my words and so on now then then then they had then they had them a preacher up there a converted lawyer by the name of apollos and apollos was a mighty man in the scriptures and was proven by the scriptures that jesus was the christ now what apollos through the word was proven by the word faith come by hearing and hearing the word he that heareth my word and belong to him that sent me has ever asked in life but apollos by the word was proven and they were christians they were followers disciples and apollos was proven by the word jesus was the christ and they had received god great joy and received the word yet knowing only the baptism of john and when paul passed through the upper course of ephesus he fined his disciples and said have you received the holy ghost since you believe are you know what they say but we haven't heard of any holy ghost but we really believe we have all the books we have all the tips we hear all the mysteries we have all the revelations we really do but we are here about this thing called the holy ghost he said now what he said no i want and um he said noah and he said have you received all sins you believe now when you believe jesus said you have eaten the life that's the new birth that's your conversion changing but the baptism of the holy spirit is the power of god that you are baptized into and are subject to these nine spiritual gifts to work through you such as preaching evangelists apostles pastors prophets and all the gifts of the body come into this and then you are baptized into this body doesn't make you any more christian it just sets you positionally in the place to be a ministering spirit in the church of the living god no you get it oh praise god no by one spirit we are baptized into one body that's correct the baptism of the holy ghost is different from the new birth one is a birth one is a baptism it brings you eternal life and the other ones gives you power it gives power into your eternal life and that's why we're at acts 1 8 you shall receive power not recycling see that church bench or poached pew or church seat you shall receive power power for what power to say i am sorry take part to the direction of some people carry repent at all paul did say please forgive me for what to pray for to forgive power to love power to act right oh praise god he said i knew what i will give you because you have a heart heart towards god a new spirit i will give you because your spirit you can greet your husband you're so terrible you're carrying your white your tear up terrible people pray they come in the church terrible people the spirit he give you a new spirit a sanctified spirit you can agree with your neighbor you could you be nice of people and then you have to put his spirit inside of there too we'll give the lord a shout oh glory to god your new spirit is a nice near up to prepare your heart for the holy spirit oh give the lord a shout or give the lord some praises a new sanctified spirit a spirit that will agree with the word oh give the lord a

hallelujah hallelujah glory to god yes yes [Applause] glory glory to god amen hallelujah i believe in this old time singing shouting preaching business praise god long time in the early years i don't know whether george conley is not here but he will know that everybody other mod was a preacher once they read two books once again women talk about anything but i'm saying your picture and they're going back all kind of characters but what kind of filthy life what kind of characters going to call what they talk to i think ezekiel god said to them prophets who i did not speak and they're speaking in my name and people hearing them he said don't hear them you know they're kind of wrong but you know partly right these are no gambling well ninety percent item ten percent wrong false are you lucifer hiding right there lucifer hiding behind the thing you can't god can't lie if god gave a word he cannot lie it is one ability of god he don't have what it takes to lie whatever he speak is truth god cannot lie oh glory to god hallelujah god cannot light it caught you he'll deliver you he'll deliver you if god shall heal you he would heal you if god are you gonna baptize you with the light there's no devils in hell no sin past present or future going to stop you from getting the baptism of the holy ghost oh give the lord a shouting of god come at light david said go glory i was young no i'm old i have never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed big bread you talk about generations to come okay the lord i shout never never [Applause] don't forget you know go to see the two three generations backing him god see me coming since my grandfather was around i wasn't born yet and god said to you coming you'll get the devil thunder when she come true oh glory to god i put an agent on the earth oh god build them a certain way oh glory to god not training i think you know god thing hallelujah ain't speaking that's the kicks and carry on you know but praise god to put fire in people's soul it's long time i'm preaching like this you know i until you are fair to take it you don't like it you have other churches you don't like it like the exit you don't like it bye-bye praise where you want to go but we're not here to please any man we have to tell you the truth because only the truth goes set you free oh god your husband can't give you this your wife can't give you this you can't get this in a supermarket but to get this on the word of god forget bbc and cnn and forget all the news out there this is the good news this morning we have a land to possess it's the land of the holy ghost it's the land of power why are we so weak we need power look at the lord i shout oh glory to god [Applause] you know money is power you say which one does me happy that's a lie and people receive the thing the spiritual and the poor and it's more spiritual than anybody else irishman oh god he happy you can buy whatever you want he has the power to do that that's power he had the power to go on p for doctor p for this and people can't pee for this and play for triple he had power i will monitor them and with the power now he could be arrogant he could be uncaring like the man who lazarus said give me some water on the front thing see a rich man he could be uncaring he don't care who who survived and so on because he's her power so god want power to release his people but he want character because power apart from character is satanic so god have to go through the grind of changing us and remaking us and quran saying looking for a man that the more he blesses is the more humble he becomes why because usually when people get blessed they get puffed up oh glory to god you got that usually when people get blessed they get puffed up and god hates a proud look one thing you hate to spread you know [Applause] are we knowing something this morning boy one thing god hit his pride you know hallelujah hallelujah he said i am the high and lofty one that dwell with him that have a humble heart and a contrite spirit as lucifer said i will ascend and be like the most high oh glory to god he's the one that was puffed up in pride and godzilla go humble you he gave me the boots and kicked him out oh glory to god and he fell in the earth oh glory thank you big mischief among the sons of god on the earth but we are coming back sons of god are coming back the book that was sealed in the garden of eden has now been unsealed and now we have access oh glory to god by the cross access to the innervale access to his glory access to his presence access to his spirit [Applause] oh my hallelujah let's say we wrap this up here now this part here friends we are not promised a system jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we were promised what was we promised a kingdom how do you get into it by one spirit we are all baptized into this kingdom it's the kingdom of god a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal king given for his word with an ever eternal people predestinated to eternal life we are baptized into it oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god give me some praises oh hallelujah so believe it or not that's what i got before coming out here that's what i share with you all right all right nobody brown we see nations breaking israel awakening the signs that this bible foretold for this day we see the mechanical taking place now now the spirit the dynamics of that promised word to get into his church and drive them to calvary yonder unto the rapture oh so you mean the people not going to the cross no the duck and the cross the duck in calvary because calvary is where you die it's not just die and you go free him you have a cross for you too you see but he said the spirit and then he identified what the spirit is the dynamics of the promised word so when we preach the promised word there's spirit in it and that spirit is what going to drive you to calvary now when the spirit came upon jesus and gave him his baptism oh jesus baptized yes he was baptized at the river jordan not just in water but by the spirit when he got the spirit fullness of the godhead fullness of the spirit he was led by the spirit into the wilderness he didn't say lord is that you is that really you no he was led by the spirit to encounter lucifer one on one and when you're finished with the devil who is man oh give the lord i shout so when jesus overcome the devil by it is written by the word he was ready for ministry he was ready to go into the temple he was very defined in scriptures to say the spirit is upon me would the bride have that sure she will the spirit and the bride have to say come or give the lord a shout therefore the holy ghost itself the dynamics have to come upon a bride to go into the scripture to say the spirit is upon me because he has anointed me oh glory to god to open the eyes of the blind to cause the death to hear to cause the tongue to speak you mean the private level ministry yes or give the lord some praises before they could close us down before i enclosed myself don't get to close me down but before they could close us down we have to have a witness we have to have power the car closes down clapping hands and singing nice to jesus songs that is not everybody doing that the car clothes has done because we are bibles they can't close us don't be all we have nice teachings everybody are teachings but you know what they're closing them for when the reproduction of the original grain when they say jesus come walking in trinidad silver and gold have i none such as i have i give it under thee which man on the earth right now could do that not one [Applause] only more champions [Applause] this was casablanca you know this was denying peter you know this is peter who denied christ three times you know this was peter who was struggling and everything else you know he come and says silvan gold have i none such as i have what did he have he did not sell van gogh he had no money he was a poor person scranton a person suffering a person but such as i have he had the kingdom he had the key he had power he had the artisan well he had permanent power it was resident in him and he knew it and he could give what he have you can't give what you don't have he got something it happened in the upper room he could testify where it happened when it happened how it happened it's a silver and gold have i known such as i have i give unto you rise up and walk we can't be afraid of that that has to be reproduced here say oh say if i go have i know i haven't got you hold a book i wanted to hear this tip it's not taking him i want to hear you know he want deliverance from that condition and there are people out there they might ordain to hear no book or no tape they want to see a manifested life like the woman at the well i that speak unto you i'm here word made flesh good manifested so now we get it now the dynamics of the promised words that drive them oh god to calvary then to the rapture but abraham said this you know you know it he said no what is the holy spirit now the reason i've taken these subjects uh in this line you cannot come and receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is one two you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it is given to you and it is for you three you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know the results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is to what action it brings when it comes then you will know what you got when you get it there's a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost filled christian now we're gonna get this from the scripture and place it exactly in the scripture the first place there's a christian profess to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost now we're not talking about teaching and mysteries we're talking about experience of god that is promised to you if this person has not been filled with the holy ghost he is only in the process of being a christian he is professed to believe it he is working to it but god has not yet given him this spirit of the holy ghost he has not yet reached that goal with god so when god made a common abraham we know what he did he gave him a covenant and after abram was found faithful to the promise that god gave him he that he would a child give him a sign and that sign was a sign of circumcision and a circumcision is a type of the holy ghost and that is why i i think it was stephen say you stiffneck and uncircumcised you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did that was stephen bust them with those circumcision type of the holy ghost now watch it's a sign of the sacrificial circumcision of the heart it's a distinction to separate them from other peoples now the holy spirit that makes god's church a separated church what it is the holy spirit right now watch and from all other creeds and fates and denominations they are in all kinds of denomination and yet they are separated people hear the bomb you let me talk to a man two minutes and i can tell you whether he received the holy ghost or not how much mysteries a man could go back in two minutes how much information a man could give two minutes you saw a deep cause of deep right most of you would have seen it i believe you saw where i'm on the platform see a preacher come up there and bram say you're not sick he said he said you're a preacher and then they're supposed to talk about i feel that christian spirit so it's a spirit atmosphere so he doesn't have to say hey who your pastor is well you believe yes teach this take no you know that he said you're a christian then he said tell him one next woman he said my spirit be a record with your spirit that you're a christian you're a child of god so it's not what you're saying with your mouth you don't want to talk you advise it oh give the lord some praises so what your vibes in now if you're good vibes the holy spirit revives your christian life you could advise jealousy envy malice we gotta talk you know but you're feeling it a jealous spirit upon you on it your vibe's in it right if it's color you see any color it's because he colored god bitterness all that ah brother time said why are you so bitter yeah you said no they come they almost smell it you see you don't have to say a word he said two minutes i could tell where you see the holy ghost or not it separates them it's a mark and any child that refused circumcision in the old testament was the fourth shot of the holy ghost was cut off among the people he could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised what is the holy ghost it's a sign we come in to get on a little later on the message and watch it's the holy ghost it's a seal it's a sign god gave you give to his chosen children to reject it is to be cut off from the people and to receive it is to be finished with the world and all the things of the world it's to be a product that god has put a seal approval on and peter described jesus jesus a man approved of god so when it is approved is the proof of god a man approved it by god and that's what god wants to do for you to say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased okay now watch and but i'm talking about the railroad and when the car being loaded inspector come to find anything loose and if and if it would fall or break you would not seal the car so he's talking about the candles he's switching natural tight about box car on the railroad and they put things in it and when the inspector come the inspector have to come the inspector i have good news for you you will like this one this species not a pastor so so leave me out of this thing so dof get up fight with me oh god i gotta get a fight this morning boy why what you're going through something else you are going on to it i'm going to this inspector now he could come and he come and come and come in so watch now he said the reason that we don't get sealed so much we are too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life or you've been here respect life yes not your words you could talk talking to anything but inspect your life see if you are not just a little loose about things and he sat and they find some things loose about your prayer life oh you mean we supposed to have a sort of discipline and having a prayer life yes yes loose about your prayer life loose about that temper loose about your tongue to talk about others that's a big one that's a that's a huge one he will never see that car so he's a gossiper whether he has a professional or not um no steal for you he's have official and unofficial you know praise the lord watch some dirty habits some vile things some vulgarity mine he can't seal the car so this now brings the whole thing different now you can't hide in church there's not people to see somebody in front of the slide down slowly that the only person sees them good i'm not seeing you you could have put some function at all but this is not this year the inspector at tall or short he right there he's seen you every move and if you take that consciousness you would not do what you have done or will do because your conscious the lord is on your right side the lord is watching you the inspector watching you if we could leave it with the conscience this morning there's an inspector oh glory to god when nobody else sees the inspector's seen it comes somebody after they sweep the floor and you sweep the floor they look around like that and you raise up the big mat to the carpet and throw the dust on insert it so coming back when parents come home they see it sweep they hate sweep but it does under the carpet they see it yet that is man see but god's seen everything oh blessed be the name of the lord so watch now what something no he has purchased us every promise in the bible is yours it belongs to you then this token is upon you and god has sealed you now we want to check ourselves for a moment when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit then the life of jesus christ is within you now that's true it's the new book you are born anew of the holy ghost because that god has did this and you know you are no good in yourself you accept what god has did then he seals you into the kingdom by the holy spirit oh praise god and everything that jesus purchased and promised you in the bible is yours it's your property because it's paid for and when you understand by revelation you pray differently then you say healing his mind he paid for it he lost yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it heaven is mighty paid for it everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds that token oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so then he is showing you in connection with the true holy ghost and this is very important listen carefully he said the way god is expecting the individual to grow is the way he brought his church to grow how did he bring his church to grow look at right here fate virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness this is not a fast food product god have god put abraham faith isaac love jacob grace through the perfection upon that the prophets the body work john the baptist come the neck pact jesus come the head part he kept the old testament become the cornerstone of the new testament here come paul martin arenas columba luther wesley praise god the pentecostal and william marion bram and the same way he brings his church through he's going to bring you through you can't skip any classes peter said after your faith virtue and the virtual knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and the patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and on top of brotherly kindness is the holy spirit oh glory to god the person of the holy ghost to come upon you to give you power hallelujah so i am not talking about pentecostal baptism i am talking about the power right on the top of bradley kindness which is perfect because god know the amount of rob and crab and all kind of characters that are going to step on your toes and god will see if you have the ability to forgive them to give you access to that holy spirit just above brotherly kindness give the lord a shout this is the message oh glory to god my [Music] brother that's the key because that is the blood for this age so if somebody can't forgive they're not really any message let me say it good if they can't forgive they don't not really even any message because this is a evidence or a display that you understand this is your age this is the age of forgiveness how much times must the brother offend you 70 times a day how much time do you go forgive your brother oh give the lord a shout gloria no slacker with unforgiveness in his heart [Applause] that ain't that no adoption for that i don't care what the brother did it doesn't matter to me amen god save me and the same blood for me is for my brother i want to hear a bigger amen than that the same blood for me is for you it's not blood for you and no blood for that brother oh he might be dung in the ditch but blood for him too you have to see that that way [Applause] people not under the blood as they think you know because if they're under the blood we could have fellowship on one another and the blood of jesus cleanses us not them us from all sin oh glory to god frees you to love oh my so watch the same way god is expecting us okay and the way god is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he brought his church to grow you see every church age becomes one big church right now what these fellows wasn't required what these fellows are there was no kind of this that he brought his church up the same way his church up the same way he's bringing his people up then peter here says seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godness brotherly kindness add broadly kindness and then the love of god we know there's a prophecy instagram of the lord when the church finds his brotherly love he said they lost it brother fight then brother they saw the lord in his comments so they could fight one big buccaneer this jewish fight in this church this pastor by his pastor everybody forget they're more revelation all kind of crazy people god said they had to find the brotherly kindness because the husband come and they don't have the coin he's not he divorcing you keep putting you away his message long time with books and tips and you have a heart bitterness and people renewing like the renewing diagnosis permit we know they hate every year we need an ought every year we ruin the grudge every year against this one against that one they're just renewing it and some of them put it on the congregation too so the correction fighting for the pastor too a set of foolishness oh glory to god hallelujah as i said already go to the ordained man and he had a hand carry bag and open the door for him like if they passed some kind of celebrity or something what kind of foolishness is that oh glory to god you know what all that happening and braham didn't live that oh glory to god they're saying what the prophet said but they didn't live holy prophet live he lived a certain way you know oh glory to god he had a life you know it was christ you know hallelujah start to resemble christ after a while you know they thought he was christ you know so the bride had to become you know oh glory to god judas had to kiss jesus for the authorities to recognize who jesus was you know all of my beard all in my long he said the one who will kiss the easy one or give the lord a shout jesus didn't have a special thing on top he heard i said i jesus you know hallelujah give the lord some praises brother oh glory to god we have to come now people are too high up dear it's better you step down and come now where we are oh give the lord a shout you're up there are watching you oh clock goggle bring you down and you go walk where everybody is walking oh glory everybody fighting inside of here we fighting for our eyes called me that promise i didn't make the promise the promise have to come to pass coronavirus oh no corona virus variants on ovarians they get the next one in france i don't care what name they have same devil different versions same lucifer but it's the same jesus same power that was in the early church going to be here all glory to god new bodies on the earth but same jesus same power same anoint him look if the lord has shown glory to god let them developers keep coming he said they're gonna be coming some adopted sons they're gonna stop cancer they're gonna stop diseases he said stop them plagues oh give the lord i shall let them come let them come let them come somebody gonna be here [Applause] somebody will be answering that somebody will hear around the world in america and europe and africa and south america every part of the world will have sons of god that was baptized into the body of christ [Applause] with the spoken word of god [Music] [Applause] glory my god by the punches your foolishness for somebody say lord not he you could stop god they say not he don't bless him don't bless you who you controlling that you know what suffering means suffering he's a boss he could do whatever he wants he raised up fear and trade on pharaoh failure didn't promote himself god raised up pharaoh there was a bad is bad he was the he was the supreme power big power in them time superhero pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh and god make him so big everybody feared pharaoh all these nations are wrong bombing the pharaoh moses and all run away from pharaoh but when god said moses with pure fire left with books and tips you know with fire off the mountain with a hot tempered wife he make sure you're the right way for him oh god to put some heat on him we'll give the lord a shout some men lazy some men they don't want to press they want to push god give them some kind of wife to put fire under them you have to move sometimes and when moses went down to egypt i didn't know why i go on it but they didn't go on there already come out hallelujah when moses went down to egypt he said pharaoh let my people go pharaoh say say i'm the boss you know i am i'm president pharaoh i am prime minister phil they say but god moses said it's god that's hit me i am that i am send me the one who put you dear the one who promote you dear he sent me to tell you let my people go and i am telling you that anointing will come in trinidad to release god's people from the hands of these bunch of pharaoh ministers okay the lord let my people go oh god gonna let them go god gonna get good shepherds they're gonna feed their sheep or give the lord a shout [Music] [Applause] if pharaoh only knew the type of destruction that was coming to his empire he might tell moses early leave a blessing for me now take the mango one time oh glory to god when moses finished with him he said take your flock take a go take your people and go take your plagues with you take everything with you i want nothing to do with moses no and i'm telling you when we finish in prayer in faith he said wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group they're gonna slice and cut they can shut the heavens they could open the heavens they could do whatever they want to do oh glory to god you think your children could stay where they are when we got the word of the lord just as lazarus comfort was the voice of the archangel calling lazarus from the dead god gonna call your son god gonna call your daughter and they can't say no or give the lord a shout oh hallelujah glory to god i see a great deliverance coming what do you see [Music] brotherly kindness then the love of god and then he said it this way the holy ghost christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in you so the true baptism of the holy ghost is when all these virtues is sealed in you you recognize this is not skim milk you recognize this is not small talk you recognize does not come and join church this is you and christ christ living in you the mystery gonna be christ in you the hope of glory not mystery to talk not mystery in your head but christ in you [Applause] are you ready for the big bomb when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him what is acts 1 8 you shall see power after the holy ghost comes upon you when a man possesses these things i'm reading then the holy ghost comes upon him you better believe that this morning that's thus said the word that's thus saith the lord no matter you might speak in tongues you might impersonate any gift that god has got you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you are still off the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues grow in look at the words and you added that to that then you are a living monument [Music] not imaginary a living faith a living virtue he's going down he's drilling down a living knowledge a living temperance and living patience how we could know it living if we had tested nothing tested we don't even living a dog lying down there you don't know if your dog alive or dead touch sensina if it bites by children thing you know they're alive you better move it dead living faith living virtue living knowledge and it makes a living man a living image in the statue of god and that brings us back to genesis 1 26 let us make man in our image and likeness so you mean this book that adam had is connected to these virtues that is in this pyramid in the second bible oh give the lord a shout you mean that's a revelation you mean when you have that you have the entire bible in you yes it's just three bibles this second bible and this written bible is the same bible this is the living bible that will be living in you word made flesh god made flesh all glory to god and the word was invisible until the word becomes flesh and when the word becomes flesh the invisible give the lord a shout becomes visible [Applause] all right and watch the same thing that jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary there's a reality that proves that and every man today that has received the true baptism of the holy ghost is anointed with the same spirit that jesus of nazareth was and went about doing good and healing the sick he said that makes me feel good to know that he lives today oh glory to god and then he being a prophecy he said when that light struck little rebecca she knew something between her that brought her to isaac she failed her face she wanted norma to do with her own thinking isaac was a thinking from then on and the church itself when it strikes the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost and he's identifying where so you're going to know it's not pentecostally talking about is that charismatically talking about listen to what he said when it strikes the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost out of the nominative churches out of the catholic church wherever it is when the baptism of the holy ghost is made real to the people them that are predestinated like you people here to eternal life sees it and walks in it what is it a super sign so there's a prophecy here brother lyndon that this baptism going to be made real to the people it has to be made real to the people i need it i want it i got to have it as promised god said it [Applause] you know why people follow false doctrine or i'm saying become a man naked man make it you see this we're talking here man can make that man can make that transformation see what preaching here man can produce that just got to do that oh my you talk about a woman let's go i want a home stretch i mean on

seven seals because your name was on that book and the only way you could be delivered is to release your name and god put the book in the prophet and the prophet put the book the names in the word on books and tapes and then you have pastors and events in a fightful ministry come to preach the word of god and as you hear the word of god you hear your name and as you hear your name you begin to

don't want them that screaming hollering blabbering accident miserable creatures that they think they are it will ruin her educated ethical scientific society church she belongs to they were trout she can't have it hear the bum so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth [Applause] the word could only bring forth screaming shouting hallelujah

david tells you woman wait till tomorrow come on if you figure this is dancing he's here wait until tomorrow come on there's more dancing going on you know god for you for my life i said you can't dance you want to give us free cancer where is that i i really accept that much just for god you go all god do for you and you can praise and worship your god you can give god praises and thanksgiving and blessing for his name what do you think you may be seated jesus openly understands the scriptures he opened mysteries revelations old testament he dropped everything on them he opened the word and opened the understanding that he could understand the word because he didn't open the understanding they understand nothing and so it make you waste the time within the word so you understand how to be open to understand what he's telling you and he tell them very simple behold i send the promise of my father this is not only promise this is the promise of my father the other terry and he sees jerusalem until you've been with with some pastors spent and just tracked through the book to the window no until you get paul from one high that's all he knew now when jesus died all them said oh god oh good who would multiply bread again he dead go on so them in a sad mood when jesus opens scriptures to them opened the understanding and he was leaving the ball by by hallelujah no heartache no grief he was taken up in a cloud and they went into the temple praising and blessing god you see god calcum melon dry you ever prayed for somebody who's dead half dead at the altar you ever lay hands on somebody who really want to be there the family but they send them they say go up there and you're praying there like a plane on a stone no spirit atmosphere you see when somebody want deliverance and they come up to the altar to be prayed and they're in the spirit and you put your hands upon them to pray for them you feel a connection there's a deep inside of them calling oh glory to god hallelujah so the holy ghost can't come and dry so he put them together atmosphere in the upper room for 14 days they were praising and blessing god maybe mary didn't feel she had the praise god in the beginning but by time they finished she was praising god too old man jack mary mother of jesus and mary magdalene both mary's insider there oh glory to god virgin mary and prostitute mary all their names in the book say mary had to raise and praise raise and praise and if you think you getting anything without raising and praising you have nothing to get oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god we gonna have a revival in the church no dead church no half dead sermon no half dead preacher oh glory to god everybody alive unto god hallelujah hallelujah church joining us is of a man who it is of god but about him we will never get in on the intellectual we have to come in by the holy ghost because that's the only kind of a spirit that the holy ghost church bears so the pregnant word of god true word gospel could only produce this screaming shouting oh glory to god a bird i mean hospital is is is a messy thing i don't care if he's a king daughter prince anne prince elizabeth prince whoever prince or princess i don't care who given birth is a mess and these spiritual birth is a mess too they may fall along and might roll on the floor you might fall out clogged on my wheat you might cry whatever it is but it will be a mess glory to god your week might fall off and all you ever been a mess oh glory to god but jesus was born oh glory to god is a mess a bread is a mess and this new bird will be messy too this holy ghost thing will be messy people are going to like it but it could be messy oh give the lord a shout in the house oh but when you're finished you're a new creature in christ jesus when you're finished you're born again you're born anew you're born of the holy ghost you're born of the spirit you're connected to heaven [Applause] themselves from the true baptism of the holy spirit and the word of god unto what onto the cesspools of the church of dogmas and creeds and innovation differences so you see it's easier to preach something for somebody to hold his apostle creed this particular is that nomination again you know man preaching their own thing is that private popes you know proposed to be bigger than other thousand people in the church and two thousand and ten thousands you know there are people who are five people and they poop i'm almost done i have a lot i could preach [Music] it easy to pray three hours and see nothing else is not this is the word now if you know my different books to fight to get all these things to put it together [Music] because i want you to know what the prophet said when you finish you must know god said so and you believe it put it right now my rejected friend this morning have you got something different to live for something to bring you out of the world something that means more to you than all the world is the live for christ if you haven't cut that why don't you come and receive it now just to go to church and say i want to be a good person don't do that you want to be a christian if there is something always been in your heart telling you you're not right i want to be right you're always long to be something that you're not now don't you know that god is calling to you don't turn your back on it for if you he said come come with jacob regardless of what is going to cost you if it costs you your home if it costs you your job if it costs your husband costs your wife costs your children if it costs anything get the boot right that's what comes and if you feel that way about it this morning would you like to have this boot right listen to these words i can't give it to you god can this is very important but branham is telling them i cannot give it to you god can he's the only one that is talking to you would you raise your hand up and say pray for me brother branham that boot right god bless you everywhere the right hallelujah and he said lord in the light of your word i command every person that's not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ to hasten to the water quickly while you have a chance you who have not been filled with the holy ghost so he's dealing with water dealing with those who are not filled with the holy ghost you who are not filled with the holy ghost i command you in the name of the lord jesus christ fall to your knees and don't get up until the holy spirit has sanctified you thoroughly and filled you with his love and goodness until your soul is so satisfied in the presence of god that your whole desire is to seal him and walk for him and work with him all the rest of your life oh my hallelujah he said if there's any sitting that feels their knee tonight feels that they need to be baptized or needs the baptist holy spirit you know your need it's been revealed to you you want to be remembered in prayer there is none of us can give it to you oh we can baptize you in what he's talking about but the only thing we can't give you is the holy ghost god does that alone but you feel your need that god is speaking to your heart and you need it and you want us to remember you in prayer would you stand up so we can know you i know who you are god bless you and to see all these people standing i'm trusting one of these days i'm going to find my name tonight in that seal yonder dear from the foundation of the world something struck my heart and i'm standing i want you to reveal to me my name over there fill me seal me into yourself by the holy ghost you who have already been sealed i want you to raise up turn around to them lay hands upon him and to pray for them you say heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus let the great holy spirit move upon this audience as a russian wind museum cometh please and called every heart here and send on the baptism of the holy spirit upon these people oh glory to god let me say he said heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus let the great holy spirit move upon the audience as a russian wind and call to every heart here lord and send down the baptism of the holy spirit upon these people oh glory to god hallelujah praise god the spirit is the token you fight you shall be filled with the holy ghost not many days hence that was the team of every apostle have you received the holy ghost since you believe oh glory to god the attitude is what brings the results it's the attitude you take towards god we are and believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can just get started god will do the rest oh glory to god and that prophet in a vision said i believe the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is here they are waiting on the dynamics to take them off the earth he is the dynamics we become members of the machine of his body the dynamics of this church will be refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body the dynamics is the holy spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord listen to this and when we have met these qualifications and become full of the virtues of god and the things of god then the holy spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom don't worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well glory to god i know i got it like all these impostors know claiming to be adopted and they're not they have to announce the adoption god do have to say this is my beloved son hear him them announcing their own self oh praise god the holy ghost is a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it is peace it is rest it's it's goodness it is healing it is god's open door oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god god knowed it would take the baptism of the holy ghost to prove his latter day sign and to see the holy spirit level there we go i'm almost finished you know must be alive in the church to make this church live its day it must be here today to confirm this latter day ministry latter day signs latter-day part of the holy ghost it's got to be here to do that and you cannot get it through working of systems god has a system he is the one who give us the holy ghost oh glory to god he said give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year but all the tears you failed to do in 2000 years you wait until the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful little remnant after the daughter of the gentiles is closed call will anoint the church them oh glory to god hallelujah national force we'll put the children in the work we'll put the churches in the world comes our churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride play something softly oh my i'm going to close you

zoom bible studies at 8pm so come under great expectations this coming tuesday our zoom uh bible study wednesday live streaming service uh make it important it's a critical message that we're going to have and this coming friday we have a special zoom service this coming friday at 8 pm we have a special zoom service so this week tuesday at 8 p.m via zoom wednesday night streaming service friday night zoom service and of course lord willing this sunday we are back into the house of the lord maintenance group five uh you're on duty today please meet with brother mike blackman after the service we are also soliciting some additional support so if you are available to assist with the cleanup after the church service we will appreciate that very very much as you know we have a greater level of compliance requirement given the ongoing pandemic so every help every support and we also want to take this opportunity to remind the believers of the compliance requirements you know to monitor or social distancing washing your hands wearing your masks and i know at times it may you know get a bit exciting but we do remind you to keep wearing your masks uh at all times and it is just good practice in discipline you know so bear that in mind and um maintain all of the protocols not just here but as part of this journey uh it's akin to going into the arc of safety you know so noah couldn't say well i have the occurrence staying outside because i'm anointed he had to be in the ark so he had to do what had to be done to preserve life so as much as we can do to preserve life we will do so amen church wonderful next week uh group four brother marlon alexander's group is scheduled uh to clean so you wanna take note of that and may the law already blessed you this week and i see from the way the lord has been leading but it's a season being declared friends of that difference with being a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian uh it's a higher challenge to us with how we walk and that holy ghost life is christ in you and berube said it and the prophet say the holy ghost can behave in one person and misbehave in another person the behavior has to be christlike so we are encouraged and we are challenged in our prayer lives in our walk with god to walk closer to walk carefully to walk because we don't have much time left every day there's a news report that reminds us that we are leaving this place and it kind of just be words to us that we are leaving it it must become a reality to us that puts us into a spirit of expectation and anticipation and consecration and dedication for this holy ghost to be real to us individually not just real to the church and to the believers of the church but it must come personal to us as individuals that i want this thing and not just wanted but i want to live this thing so i challenge you those that are here and those that are online as well give this your all this is what we are here for but always said it seven years is like that so make your life a testimony while you're here let people know you're a christian let your house know you're a christian let your neighborhood i'm not saying they're walking around trying to preach to people but your life must thunder and that's what the prophet said that's a thunder that shakes the devil walking around in sweetness and humility so may the lord richly bless you stay on fire and robert said it in the service we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth so this week i challenge you to smile more than you smile last week to laugh more than you laughed last week i don't care how bad things get as david said i've never seen the righteous forsaken there's no strength in worrying about anything god is in control and he who started the work is more than able to bring it to completion so may the lord richly bless you stay on the firing line brother anthony praise the name of the lord we appreciate that amen amen as the ushers come are you in the church triumphant are you in the savior's bride as you leave praise the name of the lord glory to god god bless you are you in the church i'll take it a little bit are you in the church triumphant oh are you in the savior's bride oh i'll come and be baptized into the body oh and forever [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] on [Music] desire pay me that jesus had before oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
