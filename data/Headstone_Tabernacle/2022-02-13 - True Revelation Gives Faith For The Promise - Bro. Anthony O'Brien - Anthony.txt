hallelujah amen and amen blessed be the name of the lord well god bless you amen and sydney a privilege to be in the house of the lord amen praise god we certainly thank god for his presence this morning so thank god for that song service but it's steve moly very god bless you thank you so much and the musicians amen we feel the presence of the lord amen so god bless you without much further ado uh we want to dive into the scripture amen and see what the lord will do for us this morning amen city and privilege should be here i want to thank the pastor in the ministry and praise god they uh have been feeding the flock amen praise the near lord even reverend isaac over last week appreciate that message the seven compound names amen of jehovah what a masterpiece praise god just felt such a convention kind of anointing in that service i felt like i was in a convention amen really wonderful amen so god has been blessing us thus far so we're gonna turn our bible down to uh deuteronomy 29 also to saint john 1 and hebrews 11 for scripture reading so firstly if you could look at deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 29 familiar scriptures but just something that the lord uh well has just inspired me to so praying that god will bless us this morning to uh see what he's saying to us this morning amen deuteronomy 29 29 says the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law amen now saint john 1 new testament we'll read the last portion of scriptures there saint john 1 2 3 we'll read inclusively amen and saint john 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen and amen diving over to hebrews chapter 11 reading from verse six man we're familiar with that chapter but we just want to pull this voice out here amen to for context hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen and amen let's bow our heads one more time praise god oh heavenly father lord we come into your presence today lord cognizant of the fact lord father that we are nothing this morning we are but tools in your hands lord that you could use father and lord we offer ourselves for you before your lord as a living sacrifice lord may you come and bless your people lord father lord as lord as we read these scriptures father we pray that your holy spirit would just come and lord give me the words to speak to your people father i can do nothing without you lord these people wear nothing without you father so lord we surrender to your will and to your way father make me a servant today and father highway behind your presence father may you speak your word only oh god father and come behind it lord anoint it afresh give us a fresh anointing a fresh inspiration for the hour that we're living in father for our great charge is upon us granted almighty god may bless your heart to the people now as we dive into the scriptures lord to see what you would speak to us lord may you anoint us and inspire us one more time we pray and ask these things in your precious name amen and amen you may be seated praise god amen [Music] hallelujah amen praise god so for title amen we've chosen true revelation gives faith for the promise amen that's my title this morning and advice but i had for inspiration here lord increase my faith amen lord increase my faith amen as inspiration i have here it's kind of like a prayer that i'm setting it out ass and i'll just give a little extra experience praise the name of the lord but lord increase my faith and uh you know i was just worshiping and this thought came to me just about early january early to mid-january and um you know i was just in the car kind of worshiping and stuff like that and i was listening to some worship and i i heard someone say lord increase my faith you know and i began to think on that because i'm asking myself well lord what does that really mean you know and so i'm asking lord what does it really mean to increase your faith and we know many times the prophet talk about faith and revelation and he says it's one and the same isn't that right and that so what when someone asks lord increase my faith what are you asking him to do really what he asked him to do is for him to reveal himself to you in a way that your faith could take a hole is not right because the more of himself is revealed is the more faith you can have in what he said isn't iran and it come like what brother isaac was preaching last week as god unfolded himself and became jehovah jireh as he became jehovah rapha the people's faith increased in who god was as he continued to unfold himself amen there was more of him to unfold and as he unfolded himself he became more to them if they needed healing he became a healer he became their deliverer he became their shepherd he became their righteousness he became their isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah so that's what i'm talking about lord increase my faith what we're really talking about is god giving you an experience praise god of unveiling his word to you praise god so that you could see more of him so that the more of him you see is the more your faith can hold oh you don't hear me this morning hallelujah hallelujah because what has been revealed to us in this age is more than the other ages had gone past luther had a tip of it wesley had a tip of it but what has been revealed to us in this day we can see the whole program of god oh hallowed from faith all the way to charity and that ought to give us our faith oh hallelujah our seventh and faith to claim the promises of god for this day oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right praise god amen hallelujah so i certainly appreciate that message amen praise god hallelujah i'm backing you up brother amen each one back one another up praise god hallelujah that's another ephesians break that's what we're coming to praise god and we see the unfolding of his word and what does it do it ought to give us faith amen it ought to increase our faith as we see more of him unfold isn't that right so this faith we're talking about what is it it's a revelation and as god is god given faith isn't that right it's something that's divinely revealed to you it's to the individual isn't that right virtue could pour out knowledge could pour out but faith is revealed oh reveal to you as an individual who you are who god is who the devil is and when you get that revelation fate it gives you power to possess your promise because you see by revelation what you have to possess oh somebody's saying man this morning i'm not here to warm a church bench i'm not here to be a church member but i'm here to find out what i'm here to possess i'm here to possess my mountain god didn't bring you this far just to bring you this far no no no no he brought you out to take you in to your promise to your holy ghost and fire all our redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into i didn't come for no halfway gospel i didn't come for no halfway redemption jesus didn't die halfway he died the whole way he unveiled a whole temple it was rent hallelujah to give you access to your promise to your heavenly father somebody say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory do you believe it so in order for you to have faith you have to see something you have to see something your faith must rest in the word reveal the word presented to you in truth hallelujah then god anoints that he cannot anoint your own thoughts he cannot anoint your flesh but he can anoint his word oh hallelujah isn't that right luring your faith is based on what has been divinely revealed to you isn't that right so let's ride through here quickly amen your faith takes a hold of that and says god said so isn't that right that's why faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god and then when it revealed to you it belongs to you oh let me say that again when it's revealed to you then it belongs to you so if god reveal your healing it belongs to you if god reveal your ceiling it belongs to you if god will reveal the holy ghost to you then it belongs to you it is your portion oh hallelujah hallelujah oh because the secret things belong to god that's his secret that's his secret to keep he's suffering he can choose to reveal whatever he wants to so if god withhold back something you can't fix it god that's his secrets that's the father's secrets that's in his time to do that is in his time to reveal whatever he wants to do isn't that right nobody can question him although he is called supreme but whatever he revealed to you that is yours the holy ghost is yours seven thunders is yours the anointing is yours your theophany oh hello your place in christ if god reveal that to you then that is yours this morning then no devil on the universe can take that away from you if god revealed to you this morning that he's going to deliver your family i don't care how many devils oh your faith will stand oh because revelation is fulfilling power oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he revealed something to you that you didn't know before isn't that right you're born in sin shape and iniquity come in the world speaking lies you came into this world clueless not doing anything but god know everything so when god reveals something to you you start to jump and shout because you now see in it but god already know that a long time and guess what you have more to show if you stay with that word here more to show you you think you see something god just pulled back a little thing so and you jump in and shouting when god pull it back and he pulled it back and he pulled it back oh how do you begin to scream and shout oh because you're seeing more of god unfolding oh hallelujah on the seventh seal will continue to unfold unfold and explode and explode until we see christ reproduce himself again in the natural that's what we're looking for that's the time we're living in praise god hallelujah oh amen amen glory so we've been living in a time of the revelation of these things being made known so that you could hook in praise god to malachi fourth third paul the opening of the word the mysteries reveal to know who you are who god is and who the devil is praise god your faith is not based on signs and wonders but your faith is based on your name and epoch because whatever your name is in there that's what you're going to receive oh hallelujah we have not received connelly devised fables praise god but there's a name in the book praise god concerning you not your natural name you want you to get that it's not your natural name as brother branham said not leave ale not all roberts but the mystery of what the book is while it is calling those names so when the word is preached and the word is being revealed and the word is being anointed something inside of you connect with the name on the book and you see what you are supposed to be by revelation oh hallelujah hallelujah then when you come to church you make your mind up that no devil can stop you no demon can stop you you come to worship you come to bow down you come to create an atmosphere because you know you have a holy ghost to get doesn't matter who on the left won the right i come from my mountain i come for my portion i come for my inheritance not enough temples and hell can stop what god has for you this morning he wrote it in blood somebody shout [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my keeping the time here amen okay so with revelation it gives you the power to see what you're supposed to see and it gives you ability to possess what you know is your own when caleb see he had a mountain to get he said let's go up at once and take the land i have a mountain i hit up with kill time i hit a mark time i hit the dilly dally i'm here to get what i came for may you get what you came for this morning may you get what you come for one thing about is hired that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord or forever forever forever i don't want to be nowhere else but in his presence in heavenly places hallelujah what is heavenly places the believer's position in christ that's when you're in heavenly places when you can find your place some apostles some prophet some teacher your place the church is striving today to find her place god may you send a revival to shake the church into their place shake the church into a position shake you out of the natural shake the foolishes off shake the latachi off and get on fire for god bless start to burn day and night praying in season out of season lords and the fire lords and the anointing lord send the culture of the altar here am i send me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you feel him he's anointing your faith amen i'm trying to get off page one amen what god is now showing you is not new to him it's not new things you know he's been thinking about this a long time how long we don't know it's undefined it could be thousands of years it could be millions but when elohim sat alone with his thoughts he knew what he wanted to do he knew how he was going to do it he knew who he was going to choose that's why it pleased god it put a smile on his face to choose you because the devil look at you and see a pony one who's struggling and can't pay the pills but when god looked down he see a mighty mighty marching army [Applause] [Music] amen oh my you know recent recently i was studying the book of moses and moses as a character you know the scripture kind of gives glimpses of who he was based on how we express himself and talk and different things so if you go through the scripture you really see you get a glimpse of his his his his character his his disposition you know as he talks talk to god you know in his conversation as a scripture accounts it and when you really look it over moses was moses was a mess you know i started off song and real good i mean his story song sort of real nice and he was pulled out of the water you know he was brought into the king's palace raised up as an egyptian in his mind he really thought that he was going to be deliverer to the people he thought so he when he saw the egyptian doing wrong to the hebrew and so forth like that he looked this way he looked that way the bible says and he went and slew him you know and then his own people uh confronted him on it i said will you be a judge over us you you you assumed that position over us in a way they rejected him amen is there as some kind of leader or something because he was prince of egypt but when god stripped him of that title when he say surely this thing is known and he frightened because pretty soon the videos and images gonna start to pop up on facebook he'd take a leave before that happen he run out before they print a wanted poster you bust out and you run in with us and hide for 40 years and name his son gershom which is to mean a stranger in a strange land among a strange people his son was praise god a sign of who how he felt at that time praise god and he was out there in the wilderness mining jeffrey's flock imagine you out in the wilderness 40 years and you don't have your own flock you might have chapters [Music] 40 i mean huh he was a mess but when that man same man met the pillar fire when that man met the opponent bush he came back different upon his countenance was seen the glory of the lord i have seen the face of god god has spoken to me and told me to go down to egypt land and tell pharaoh let my people go that same how couldn't talk that same i couldn't do nothing watch god take that man and use that man for his honor for his glory oh i say this morning there is more to you than meets the eye you think you can make it you think you can overcome all you need this morning is five minutes in the pill of fire and god will change everything he'll change your walk he'll change your talk he'll change your behavior he'll change your action he'll change your attitude oh hallelujah oh god bring back another five minutes bring back a burn and push experience oh hallelujah where the people could reside where you could be immersed in the presence of god so much that they consume all your fears putting up all your ideas putting up all your opinions putting up everything hallelujah you see something supernatural and that gives you faith to believe that god is able to do right now now faith is for your healing for your deliverance for the holy ghost now faith is for whatever you asking for now faith is not tomorrow you don't have to wait another minute if you can see god working in your situation god is able to do it right now listen to me church the god that created the moon created a stars created man in his own image he is able to do anything this morning i challenge you to release your fetch into god's word give it over to god and watch what he does with it watch what he can do with it oh hallelujah i can pick something out of nothing he can make somebody out of nobody let your faith rise this morning [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah mine [Music] so it's not always it's not new it always was your healing always was your deliverance always was your breakthrough it was there you just have to have enough faith to claim it but it's right there waiting for you this morning whatever you have need of you need strength you're feeling weak it is their strength is there you just need a strong hand of faith to cut out enough of the promise and you can have it right now you don't have to wait for tomorrow you don't have to wait for next week you don't even have to wait to feel it faith is not by feelings faith is what god said hallelujah hallelujah come on now somebody praise him somebody shout i know i'm talking to somebody in here praise god holla he didn't bring you this far to leave you he didn't teach you to swim to let you drown no no no no no no the car that is in you now he is able to complete the work that is started in you your steps are ordered of the lord a man could make his plans but god will establish his work oh hallelujah he didn't allow what he didn't allow for a reason he let things go i'll go on for a long time oh but maybe today maybe your hour this morning is your day of visitation think it's not strange oh but the day here my voice heart not your heart hard not your heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen do you feel it my god psalms 119 verse 8 9 says forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven it's already settled whatever he had planned is already settled whatever he had a purpose in his heart to do it's already settled up there he's not gonna think it over he's not gonna have a new thought no no no no whatever he says that is what's gonna happen that's what's going to take place when omnipotence speaks the miraculous just take place because god packs up his own word and he is his own interpreter he don't need no other interpretation he will interpret his own way and the manifestation will be the interpretation of what he said of what he promised when he comes and fulfills it so then what is it your faith is being tested to see if you could hold on long enough to what he said and then he fulfills it and proves what he said and proves that your fate is ripe and proves that your fate was real and that you did surely believe in the god that spoke to you oh hallelujah pray what a confirmation what a vindication when god proves his word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man can make a promise but he breaks his promises but god cannot breaks his promise because he is god and he has the ability he has the ability to keep his own word oh so if he said he's gonna deliver you he's gonna deliver you if he said he's gonna fill you he's gonna fill you with the holy ghost if he said he's gonna heal you if he's sad i'll bring you out with a mighty hand if he promises he is going to do it oh hallelujah so here we are on earth in the context of time isn't that right beginning and end we were born in sin shape and inequity isn't that right we didn't know what truth was so it was only when god's truth was presented to us then we caught something then that something in you responded to the word of god's truth presented as the word of god then that's how you got faith isn't that right we get faith when god would reveal to us something we didn't see before something previously hid but in god's mind was always there isn't that right isn't that right on the rapture the prophet said but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her that's right it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture oh hello it's a revelation isn't that right now it's a revelation he said what for the revelation is faith here he says it here you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation oh hallelujah so says the prophet amen and we believe it amen because it's something that's revealed to you isn't that right faith is a revelation he says it again faith is something that's revealed to you like it was revealed to abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so isn't that right he didn't see a son he couldn't feel him he couldn't hear him but what's amazing about faith is that it's a super sense faith could do all the things the five senses can't do so when god told abraham he would have a son his eyes couldn't see it but faith could see it his ears couldn't hear it but fate could hear it his hands couldn't touch it but his faith declared that it was real and it counted everything else as a lie and took god's word as truth and abraham staggered not of the promise of god hallelujah hallelujah but was strong in faith giving praise to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my because it was revealed not based on an idea not a theology or a creed or a doctrine but what god said he just took it for what it was no explanation needed no injection of man thoughts or man's ideas hallelujah and so he produced a promised son isn't that right isn't that right even though sarah herself doubted that it would be so god revealed to abraham didn't matter how much faith sarah had abraham's fate stood in the gap for sarah abraham's face was counted for righteousness and even though his wife touted the word hallelujah god still revealed to her who she was and what was going to happen and next 28 days not a time of life something going to take place something going to come over you hallelujah hallelujah you're gonna be overshadowed oh with the holy spirit oh glory glory glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah [Applause] my it's not right so faith is a super sense it sees the promise when you can't see it it goes the distance when you get tired it stands a test when you get weary when you feel like you can't go on your faith says there's still something out there i know it's got to be i know god spoke to me when i think back about how lost i was and then he spoke to me he told me something he told me he was gonna do something for my family for my son for my daughter for my husband for me he was gonna fill me with the holy ghost he told me he was gonna seal me when you see god speaks to you in his scripture you cannot doubt it there's something in you that has faith to stay with that word oh hallelujah hallelujah and god is forcing the issue because nations are breaking israel's awakening signs of the prophets foretold are coming to pass right in front of very eyes it ought to get us desperate to see this word fulfill god will not be slack concerning his promises he is not as men are he is god he lies not whatever he said shall come to pass if his judgment is judgment and if his righteousness is righteousness oh hallelujah hallelujah but on that day michael is going to stand up and he's going to begin to deliver every name that is on that book and if your name is on that book this morning happy hallelujah because your redemption draw at night look up this morning look up for your redemption destroying night there's a reason to celebrate there's a reason to praise your god this morning there's a reason i have faith there's a reason to lift your hands there is a reason to try one more time because god is not slack concerning his promise he will fulfill it he will do it god said so i came this morning because i know he can do it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] come on amen okay quickly now revelation gives fate that's right revelation of what his word amen now what is god revealing what was locked up in his mind a long time ago isn't that right so revelation it means to reveal means to uncover i have this here or show something previously hidden amen to uncover to show it in the open to you praise god as an individual isn't that right the bible said uh no sorry the prophet said here and is this a sign at the end sir it says a mystery is scripture it's a previously hidden truth but now divinely reveal amen that's what it is sorry excuse me amen a scripture you read a scripture it's a word praise god but it only becomes the word to you when you could believe it by revelation isn't that right so it's nice to say god is a healer god is a deliverer god is a restore but unless that is revealed to you you can't really possess that you can't really walk in that you can't really anoint that to yourself that's just a word like floating like a weird cloud over sangri grande or something that's all that is to you but until revelation strikes that god wrote that word concerning you concerning your family he said you shall receive power you when you realize that god is speaking to you malachi 4 said behold i send unto you elijah the prophet you have to know that he is your prophet that god sent him to you to speak to you to anoint your faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh god no you can claim it no you can say it's mine joy is mine peace is mine i claim it because i have revelation i have faith to claim what god has said and that's what we're here to do this morning not just to hear the word but to get into action and to begin to claim the promises of god for this day because if you don't claim it it'll just remain there on the shelf of your mind and you want and you'll take it for granted huh think about it huh think about it now it's really serious i think about so many years ago about a man who left that child in his car in the back seat you remember that story it was on the paper and he went to work and forgot the child in the back seat and the child died he had something more important to do then the child in the back seat and how many times how much things we leave in the backseat of our minds praise out that we don't do that we don't confront that we don't get done or we leave it in the back seat thinking somebody will take care of it you so caught up in the natural that you forget what god is doing but god is always moving you might not heal him you might see him but he is here this morning you better get desperate or it's gonna die in that backseat if you don't get next to yourself if you don't get desperate and seek god's face for the baptism of the holy ghost time is short [Applause] [Laughter] hallelujah time is short it's running out russia's getting ready to make their move you better make your move this morning and get desperate prophet said in russia go down there for that oil oh how do you better get ready the evening time is close at hand but god promised that in evening time there shall be light in the evening time oh god spoke to a prophet and said there shall be light and that's you and i this morning oh you are the light of the world god's getting ready to activate his kingdom in your heart and you are gonna be written epistles read of all men people are gonna take notes that you have been with jesus oh hallelujah by a manifestation of the holy ghost on fire missing limbs will be restored the sick is gonna be healed the blind is gonna see the will walk and the devil will be running out of the church when the gospel is preaching his power [Music] oh hallelujah oh my when we see another ananias and sapphira huh god's gonna bring that kind of church back a move in power and then as you see god move your faith ought to rise in god as you see him move but abraham says on a platform and he's doing miracles he's doing miracles and as he continues to do miracles the faith of the people actually begin to rise till the prayer line wouldn't even matter anymore telling what people had to pull the pillow fire from off the platform say he started to pray for somebody said there's somebody praying hold on one second that person got diabetes hey man you believe god heal you raise up quickly receive your healing holy spirit moving moving moving after a while he said the place get milky white with faith till till the devil no longer moving in individuals and he started moving groups he said all whoever i tried to stand up receiving healing a bunch of devils just went outside oh holland all you have crippled conditions all the other stand up devils are running they're running because your feet is rising as we see god move our confidence in the holy ghost ought to rise when we see healings signs deliverances great baptisms oh i tell you church something that's going to happen it's only fixing to take place all of this background is only laying up for a short quick message that won't shake the nations it won't last long but it'll be here oh get ready get ready get ready get ready make he holly prepare the way of the lord he said i'll ride this trail one more time oh and he will and he's gonna do it you better get ready for it oh somebody got on fire this morning somebody praising this morning somebody shot this morning i know he's talking to somebody in here oh my little time left christ mystery of god reveal god is known by simplicity of revelation to jesus of jesus christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church is now right this rock of revelation that's what he's building his church on not your idea not your doubts not your fears cast all your fears aside cast all your daughters aside this morning and take confidence in the word of god this morning and what he said if you need a healing rise up and claim it if you need deliverance rise up and claim it this morning don't be afraid listen to me fear and faith cannot occupy the same space when faith comes in there fear knows what to do fear have to get out pack up leave fears are rested fears bound hand on foot fears thrown out when fake comes into the building oh hallelujah hallelujah light and darkness cannot occupy the same space oh harlow that's why god said let there be light and when he spoke the darkness knew what to do the darkness pushed back they cannot stand in the atmosphere of light true light god's light and his light is here this morning his light is in this temple his light is in this room no look at your natural eyes close our eyes and lift your hearts before him and see him come down see him descend upon you with his eternal light with his supernatural element that remains despite the revelation what you need is a baptism of the holy ghost and fire in your soul [Music] as he had revealed [Music] hallelujah amen no other thing no other rock but on exactly what a revelation of jesus christ is through the new birth he's born in there he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of jesus christ is projecting itself through you with preeminences with the oversight he has supreme control oh just like the prophet said i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god god wants to do that in you you want to take control of every high thought every spirit hallelujah to help you conquer every philistine that you've been fighting with that you've been struggling with this morning the struggle is over for you god is gonna fight your battle your battle the battle is not yours this battle is the lord it is the lord's doing it is marvelous in your eyes this is the day that the lord has made for we will rejoice and be glad in it for the cornerstone has become the headstone of the corner hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah preminences see that they see the very life on the works and signs on one as he did he's doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest is not even called to it at all watch god's great revelation unfolding i'm getting ready to close out my lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us here's our divisions why for a lack of revelation and so much mockery and things so so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation see they lack that revelation the teachers isn't that right what's the bible say without a vision the people perish so god had to send a 20th century prophet to reveal to us what our promises were that is written in the book he said he is obligated god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you cut yourself off when you don't anoint those promises isn't that right one time the children of israel are crying up unto god and the bible said god heard their cries by reason of their affliction but it also said he remembered the covenant that he made with abraham that my people would churn in a strange land but with a mighty hand i would bring them out and when god remembered his promise he realized that he was obligated to hitch so when the people cry went up to god it shook god because something had to happen he was guilty of his promise until he brought it to pass oh and if god promised a revival here the prophet said we're going to have it make no mistake he said get ready for it there's something fixing to take place real soon i can do it for a fact he said oh hallelujah praise god oh i'm getting ready to close musicians get ready hallelujah hallelujah i'm about done amen my new ministry he said we're expecting i have a great inspect expectations this morning a great expectation at most any meeting i've ever been on because i believe we're just at the ease of something fixing to happen he said i've looked forward for it for a long time and i believe that we're right on the verge of it now for something that god is going to do to help his children a little further up the road how many want to get put up the road this morning he said you know the bible said that when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of god would raise a standard against it oh hallelujah it's nara he raises a standard isn't that right no one take on the whole arm of god here's the prophet he said but god doesn't have to do anything more to his to make it any more appealing he doesn't have to do any more to his word the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word and catch the enemy and when the bible said that when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it the prophet said what does he do you begin to stand he said he takes that same word that he's already said that word is already spoken oh he said he filled it with the holy ghost he said he deliver you he said he restore you he said he baptized you he said he'll give you something what does he do he takes that same word that is already said and makes it more positive the prophet said and take his same word and just make it more positive oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory i'm about done you can begin to play something softly oh hallelujah do you know that god is fixing the move this morning that god is fixing the power of the holy ghost he promised to have a revival he said the pride hasn't had a revival yet it will take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up again he will send it he will promise it he's gonna speak to you direct and you're gonna see it and when you see him you shall be like him even in his image even in his likeness oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hey man i'm going to play something softly oh first there was a spoken word out yonder now here it is you could touch it it's made flesh and when the enemy is still coming like a flood he poured the word into the person being the form of the holy ghost there's your one two three again justification signification then the baptism of the holy ghost like father son of holy ghost and so forth imperfection see it's all there together now notice the spoken word god above us god with us and now what is it god in us the word above us the word with us and now the word in us the word is in the bride oh that's the secret this morning and god getting ready to unveil himself in you and show his pride off to the world isn't that right hallelujah he said you are god's army prophet said marching on god's spoken word above us in a pill of fire god's manifestation of his word and flesh but now today what is this pyramid all about isn't that right it's god's spirit spoken word in us amen pray even the mystery it's been hit from ages and ages colossians 1 and generations but now is made manifest to his saints may the lord bless you this morning i'm finished hallelujah may god increase your faith this morning hallelujah as you claim your promise as you claim oh hallelujah your portion of the holy ghost amen this morning god bless you amen amen hallelujah oh glory hallelujah hey give him praise this morning
