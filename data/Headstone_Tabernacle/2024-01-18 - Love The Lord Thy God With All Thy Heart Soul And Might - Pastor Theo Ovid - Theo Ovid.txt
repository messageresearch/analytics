portion of scripture Deuteronomy chapter 6 we want to read verse 1 to7 and Matthew chapter 22 verse 35- 40 it's always a blessing to be in the house of the Lord always a blessing to be in church amen praise God okay so Deuteronomy 6:1 now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that he might do them in the land where you go to possess it so God has given them teachings and instructions before they actually possess the land verse two that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his command statutes and his Commandments which I command you thou and thy son and thy son's son that's down to the grandchildren all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore o Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that he may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers had promised thee in the land the float with milk and honey here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shal love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up and we want to go to Matthew chapter 22 and you want to get there to Jesus Matthew 22:35 35- 40 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said unto them thou shal love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself and these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and I pray that you would come and Speak Life to your people and bring a mighty deliverance and breakthrough and filled with your Holy Spirit tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you will be seated praise God we are grateful to be here tonight Hallelujah we are thankful to be alive amen in the land of the living yes you have no promise of waking up in the morning and when we wake up in the morning we just have to say bless the Lord oh my soul praise God there's no guarantee that when you open your eyes in the morning you'll be all is well there's no guarantee we don't have that guarantee God is in charge of that isn't that right he said boundaries that we cannot pass tonight have a title strange title love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul and might that's the title love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul and might God tell them the Lord our God is one Lord he's a jealous God remember we talk about it uh speak to my people and he talking about when I pick you up and nobody care for you and I pick you up from the day and I care for you and when you start to grow up now you're act acting acting part of a whole and different things like that praise God and God said teach it diligently to your children isn't that right that what we called to do so love is a choice love is More Than A Feeling lot of people feel in love they love this one they love that one after the marriage afterwards they don't know where the feeling going through praise God because love was like a feeling love is more than that love is a choice for God so loved the world he watched The Wretched and the Sinners down there and give his only begotten son that was a choice of love that he did he act so love is not a talk love is not a feeling love is an action it's not right to love is to act the love is to do it's not the love and just talk and talk and talk he not talking about love love have an action goes with it praise God he said by by this shall all men know that you might are my disciples by What You Do by by by treating one another right by washing each other feet by this shall all men know that he are my disciples oh praise the Lord Give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord isn't that right oh glory to God so it's a feeling and it emanates from thoughts and intentions and your attitude it emanates some deep from it inside of it is that right so our mind is part of what directs the rest of our being and influences what we love and what we choose our mind starts somewhere a thought strike you and you like that and you like that you like this kind of car you like this kind of house and it drop a desire inside of deal and God say I want you to love me Hallelujah with all your heart with all your mind with all your might that's a serious kind of love to love him with

personal appointment with the supernatural Give the Lord some Praises a personal appointment with the Lord thy God oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be seated after Moses run from Egypt after wor from his parents at the intellectual level that he's a mighty deliver and everything else he kill a man and run because he had no backbone behind him his seed was right inside his soul his seed there move and go no way but his seed wasn't Quicken or Made Alive like a bunch of church members in this message who claiming seed on the soul and word on top of word on top of word on top of word they s their dead church mouse praise God but when Moses after 40 years after a relaxed season with his wife and family normal Living God interrupted by the pillar of Fire coming in a burning bush and God will interrupt your normal living let me prophesy over you let me tell you this message world will be interrupted this world will be interrupted there is going to be an interruption it will be a god Interruption and through that Interruption Moses went aside to see and when he went up onight the sea the very first thing God told him is whose GRS he is on oh G God is not a Trinidadian Give the Lord I shout in the house God Is Not An American Hallelujah God is not an English man God is God he said take off your shoes for the place you stand is Holy Ground wherever God is is Holy he said be holy for I am Holy wherever God come now is a holy place oh give the Lord a shout there is no holy man it's a holy God in her man oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah Glory Glory Hall you may be seated Moses encountered with God anointed him for the commission to free two million people from pharaoh of generations pharaoh of Generations set whoever he is was on Throne that time he belonged to next Pharaoh king and a king and a king all the generation behind the Pharaoh building cities building this and building that when Moses come now what kingdom are you from the kingdom of the most high what have you brought for us the word what word let my people go it was a order it was a summons it was not a request it wasn't a favor God were asking him it was a commission that's the same as telling cancer go Lema go tumor go dry up freeze up fried BRS dry up freeze up oh give the Lord a shake Give the Lord a shout in the house the prophet said we pray for the sick now but then we command it did you hear that we pray for cases pray for sick but then we command it them Devils waiting to be called out to be cast out sickness waiting to leave glory to God could you imagine on Tabernacle sick can't St sick inside of here oh give the Lord I shout in the house blind can't St blind dumb can't St dumb death can't stay death and you know what God told Moses I've heard the cries not of everybody you know my people and that's what God hear yet in the message because his people is satisfied and they feel entitled because they two books and a tip go and a prophet and going in the Rapture they going straight to the tribulation P tribulation sins unless we meet God's requirement sir for rapturing condition I want to make it with you if you want to go there that's up to you I'm not trying to compete with you you know let's go we know that the battle WR is in the mind he said your soul back in your mind that open the mind is the gate to the spirit your mind opens up and accept the spirit or reject the spirit so if God would say to love the Lord thy God you have to have a desire Lord I want to love you and I want the things that hinder from loving you to come out because I want to serve you according to your word you don't have to have that love now but you can desire it it have to start for desire you have to desire it that's why we bringing the word to you the people didn't know what God thinks and God nature and God so God say instruct them tell them have no other gods before me tell them love the Lord thy God with all their heart let it be in their heart when you leave here you can't say you didn't hear it God I love what you love with a feelings you know man Jesus is so that is foolishness J is not a human it's not human love it's not fil your love we talking about it's a genuine heartfelt Love Oh Glory to God this is what they had a love that will make them go and die for him oh glory to pay the price for him Peter didn't have that love that's why he denied Christ when he said nails and crucifixion and CR and Tes he said I not me I wasn't say something last night I was not there I did not hear Pastor preach at all not me three times he deny he you I saw you there me at a cur C mistaken identity Peter run and cry but guess what when that love hit Peter in the upper room and the token sealed or capped his pyramid and his seed was quickened and made alive he was crucified upside down even Deacon Steven and all they not listen to the they have their own sins this one is extra don't even bother with that lay not this into their charge and and see see feel no stone you know he just rocked Back In The Arms Of God and was taken home to Glory oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God so that's why the Bible speak about the renewing of your mind if your mind don't change you are not going to change if you believe you can't you can't if you believe you can't make it you can't make it or give the Lord a shout and I'll agree with you you can't make it you have no hope you're helpless you're hopeless if you believe you could make it you can make it if you believe you could be delivered you can be delivered you have to start somewhere start with the Mind start with the thought start with the desire it has to start somewhere oh give the Lord I shout believe us th this amen amen amen may be seated the mind is the gate to the spiritu your minds open up and accept the spirit God or reject the spirit you can have little conscience and little feelings and little sensation all these things that has nothing to do with it little sensation but when it become a reality your mind open it up your mind either accept it or reject it you have to know what come to you this tonight you have to know if there's a word coming to you if you're accepting or rejecting it you have to act part of it you have to accept it or reject it if you accept it it become effective to you because that's what happened to the CH of Israel the word wasn't effective to them because they didn't properly receive it they walk with unbelief so when God saw 2 million people coming out he only saw two going in did you hear that Formula 2 million people coming out but only two going in so all God concerned with is how much babies they making along the way that's why he sent them to the Wilderness because them unbelieving Rascals that did not believe what God promis after he deliver them with a mighty hand he said they're not going over but their generation the Next Generation their children will go over over because I S to Abraham that my people will hit that land oh give the Lord a shout if the Lord a shout in the house he knew we will make it William brandham died 1965 knowing that there's going to be a bride that will cross over into the promised land oh gave the Lord a shout in the house he knew we will make it to the land of adoption to the land of

and knowe it God he that love not knowth not God for God is God is God is love the love W PC there but I'm bringing a point tonight in this was manifested the love of God towards us because God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing is love not that we love God but he loved us and sent his love son to be the priation for our sins beloved if God love us we ought to also love one another oh my no man has seen God at any time if we love one another here we go God dwell in us and his love is perfected in us so God have no love perfecting and you can love

has given a a polished way to say this liar Li in the message now don't call them Li but but the John saying here now he he had hat his brother a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love God whom he have not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who love God love his brother also Luke 14 wo verse 8 we going fast we going fast for verse 25 and they went on a great multitude with him he turned and said unto them great multitude this the crowd now if any man come to me Jesus and hate not his father mother wife wife and children and Brethren and sisters and his own life also that's the grinder you when Jesus roll you over so gr he cannot be my disciple now he is saying don't put nothing in front of me keep me Center keep me in front if you have a h mother father brother children whatever then verse 27 he said whosoever do not bear his cross and come after me oh waiting on the Lord he said come after me that's what the love have to make you do you're seeking him you're inquiring of him you're longing for him so God I want to meet you tonight I want to fellowship with you I want you to Wrap Me In Your Arms I want you to speak to me oh you're going after him and you're bearing your cross your cross amen don't look like the man you know he had the cross and he come he complain to God and the cross so big and heavy and God bring him and he say you have somebody talk about it like he come in a big room I know it's a story tale and and had lot of crosses he said pick pick the pick pick whatever one you want and he come and see the smallest one he pick it up he said buty want to come it same find the smallest cross to carry when he car said but same cross you're coming with you get smallest and you're complaining all right I believe but I'm closing that the Christian Life is a continual sacrifice he that will come after me let him deny them daily every day not 46 days but I'm reading but every day take up his cross and follow me Christian Life is one continually the Christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with a grudge he does it with a feeling that he loves God he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice let's go it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to stand for the right and move from the wrong it's a joy to praise him it's a joy to abstain from the things of the world it's in their [Applause] heart Glory you got to forsake everything you have to take your choice now are you ready to forsake everything and follow after him if God goes to put in a thirst in your heart you'll forsake everything in the world I walked away from my own father and mother a home I got a wife and three children sitting right now if they would tell me no more preaching I'd walk right away from that home as much as I love them I'll die for them right there easily but Christ is all he's my objective my motive to him is to sacrifice everything that I have to follow him whether they call a fanatic whether they call me Divine healer a Holy Roller whatever it just be oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God I'm almost done long as you are tied up with a bunch of unbelievers that don't believe these things you will never never be able you'll be blind as a bat don't know how to rephrase that but blind as a bat that's how they going to be better hang blind like a bat if they don't believe all these precious promises the Beast waiting for them Rome waiting for them the mark of the beast waiting for them but the Seal of God is waiting for you oh give the Lord some Praises cut yourself away from everything from mother from father from sister from brother from denomination whatever it is he that won't forsake his own and come after me is not worthy to be called mine praise God praise God praise God hallelujah praise God Jeremiah 29 for thus sayith the Lord God that after 70 years be accomplished at
