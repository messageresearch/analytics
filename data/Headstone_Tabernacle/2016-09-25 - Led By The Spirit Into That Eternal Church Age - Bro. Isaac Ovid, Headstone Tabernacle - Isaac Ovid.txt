meeting God gave us a tremendous CL Max with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and great deliverances the people did not want to leave so that tells you something they did not want to leave they didn't want the music playing the worshiping that they singing and Africa they know how to worship so it was a tremendous time and the sisters from our church they had a tremendous time also praise the name of the Lord I was showing them God sat behind us and you know he do songs to his brother will come straight down and run to the front and be dancing and everything as worshiping I said look at that I if it's 5 minutes to taking that you know don't stand in their way so we had a tremendous time and I know that the Lord is working everywhere with his people amen so this morning you're going to be blessed but Isa going to bring the word for you this morning but I do have something upon my heart that i' like to speak before he comes and if we could stand I want to turn to Proverbs one scripture Proverbs 22:28 first scripture reading I want to bring that to you you just one verse Proverbs 22 verse 28 it says remove not the ancient Landmark which thy fathers have set let us bow our heads almighty God we thank you for your Divine love and this privilege that you have given us humans to make ourselves available to your spirit and there one time we need to hear from you you is this time just one word from you father May the Breath of God come down Among Us and breathe upon me and breathe upon your people and refresh us with your presence and your love God in this world today there's so much negative news bad news terrible news Lord we here to hear good news the gospel of the Kingdom father speak to our hearts and transform our lives and mind May the church May the atmosphere be a ois where people can come and be refreshed from the hot son of the world and the things of the world and the cares of the life may this be a refreshing a refreshment from the presence of God coming upon the people's lives to change and transform we wait upon you in Jesus name we ask it amen I just sit down Let Jesus is the sweetest name I [Music] know and he he's just the same as His holy [Music] name that's the reason why I love him so for Jesus is the sweetest name I know thank you you know and we have to know it's all about Jesus brother EK he uh spoke the first service and he spoke about the three witnesses that came went up the mountain with Jesus and when the cloud spoke hearing him they and they saw the glory and the presence and the power right away Revelation or inspiration or intellectual whatever come to them to make Tre Tabernacles and the voice it come like not now please now is not the time for Tre Tabernacles just hear him amen time to see Jesus and I feel it has to come to that spot where it's not built to glorify any man or build up any man but for us to really see Jesus okay so this morning I a thought be strong and of good courage and I want to speak a little bit about returning to the landmark based upon the scripture that we read remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set amen a landmark is an object or feature of a landscape or Tong that is easily seen and recognized from a distance especially one that enables someone to establish their location amen you you can't even know where you're going unless you know where you at and based upon where you act you will know what direction to turn if it's East West North and South amen so when you come to church you come to find out where you at Landmark is also a marker an indicator a Guiding Light a signal a beacon is also the boundary or area of land or an object marking this all that pertain to Landmark boundary marker Dem marcor boundary line picket it's also an event or Discovery marking an important stage or turning point in something that's a landmark a turning point in your life a landmark when God arrest you and and put a stop right where you are and and it has a change all that's a landmark for you isn't that right it's a milestone a watershed a critical point and historic event a major event a crisis of divine now I want to go to Joshua 1 we know the scripture but I want you to listen again Joshua 1 chapter 1 after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of n Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the sto of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I sent to Moses he the boundaries from the Wilderness of this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river euph frees all the land of the Hittites andto the great sea towards the goinging of the son shall be your C am so what Joshua got was The Landmark and the boundaries of what he has to possess am not what he didn't have to possess what he had to possess and for all these 40 plus years God by the word has been revealing and unfolding what we have to possess from Faith to Virtue to knowledge to Temperance to patience the godliness to brotherly kindness yes sir don't move that Mark Hallelujah Perfection adoption the power of God Dynamics don't move that Mark holiness rightous consecration dedication devotion don't move that Mark am it's a Mark that God have set and he sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers the ancient fathers All foref fathers the fathers way back there that established faith in Abraham isn't that right Grace and Jacob isn't that right amen love with Isaac isn't that right and perfection in Joseph they establish certain landmarks along the way yeah oh hallel I'm saying we have to go right back to that forget all This Modern Age forget all the things that all wrong there's a requirement of God that we got to meet and tally up with oh hallelujah praise God and you got to have a heart to go back to that to connect with that to want that man changed but God has not changed his word has not Chang his power has not changed his Deliverance has not changed man has changed he changed clothes he changed cars he changed house he changed Nations and whatnot but God has not changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah GL a man on his way to a possession a people on their way to a possession that's how I want to see what you to see yourself not just a people but a people on your way to a possession not a profession which you're in the message that's talk I'm not talking about that a people on their way to a possession if you have six more months to live see yourself like that you're on your way amen if you have 24 hours to live see yourself like that because you could come and possess your healing you can come and possess your deliverance you can come and possess your restoration yes yes yes you can come and possess your breakthrough never give up be strong have a great courage Hallelujah we had to encourage you this morning oh hallelujah praise God don't give up don't give up to possess you have to be strong to possess you have to have courage to get the victory to overcome you have to be courageous Hallelujah courage doesn't mean lack a fear courage mean you did do it despite the fear come on say Amen somebody courage does not mean no [Applause] fear let going be seated they were in the upper room they were fearful yes that's why they shut the doors that why they wasn't outside they were fearful they didn't have it yet they were on their way to a promise they didn't have the power of Courage yet but they under way to it Peter denied Christ he know if he continue like that he will continue to deny him he know he needed something more than having a book and listening to a tape he know he had to something more and he was in a position to receive something more he had to have courage and G to say I'm waiting on it because Jesus said wait till the promise of the father come upon on you carry until receive power from on high hallel not power from below power from on high oh give the Lord some praise His people so take courage this morning if you're sick take courage God Is A Healer if you're bong take courage God is a way maker or if you're poor if you have need something God is a provider take courage this morning if you're struggling to en courage he's a strengthener oh come on now Hallelujah you're tired and weary but they that wait upon the Lord shall Ren you their strength they shall Mount up with things as Eagles come on take courage this morning don't you give up don't you even think about giving [Applause] up Glory hallelu Hallelujah I'm not preaching butall I want to feel a little light courage I remember one of the meetings one of the brothers preached about there four lepers was four lepers four lepers outside the Gate of Jerusalem for how much years Judah was surrounded by the enemy they were eating one another children people were dying and perishing amen the prophet came and says thust say a lot tomorrow food a man make mockery out of it he say what what you know and carry on he said you going to see it tomorrow but you can't eat out of it but that is dust say the Lord hallelujah it look impossible but God said it to a prophet and that word can't return void when that prophecy is spoken over your life I don't care what devil holding you down I don't care what binding I don't care long in sin it doesn't matter I don't care where you have been what you have done it doesn't matter when time come time come break through time come break through time come Deliverance time come Deliverance time come let be seated and some lepers on the outside say listen if we go if we still here will die because they had to be outside their lepers you have fellowship with lepers and and and having dinner with lepers lepers are separate from the people they say if we stay here we'll die the city dying if we stay here we'll die let us go out to the enemy and when they start to walk towards the enemy God caused the enemy to hear some thunders and some Rumblings and they drop everything and start to run for the life Hallelujah by the time the lepers leave the camp there was no man there just gold silver food barbecue Roy chicken rice macaroni pie you name it salad you know the whole seven course menu everything was there Hallelujah you talk about a jubilee you talk about a shouting you talk about rejoicing they were so in the spirit after a while they said no this is too much for us we we got to give a report we got to go back home and give a testimony we got to go into the City and tell the city that there is food up here the land is a good land they don't have to be bong no more they don't have to starve no more you don't have to be hungry no more they don't have to be back no more oh give the Lord some Praises people you may be de [Applause] seated when the report came back food food food good land you know who they put in charge of the organization to get stuff the same man who doubted and the people run straight over him saw it but he couldn't eat it saw it couldn't participate of it don't do that you come too far to turn back now you come too far to give up now you come too far to let go now I won't be long there shall not be able any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee but be strong of a good courage For unto this people shall thou the life inheritance the land which I sway un to their fathers to give them now it's one thing to be a follower but it's another thing to be in a leadership position because it's not like Joshua has done this before everything is brand new he's now about to cross over amen now about to lead a people in into a land that he himself never walked on every step he made as a leader had to be a step of Fate every step he made it had to take some courage to say you know what we are moving this way we are moving this way all he knew is that the bungies were set from the river Euphrates straight on up all is yours amen and we want all that belong to us somebody shout all somebody shout all again one more time say all you want all your healing you want all your breakr you want all your blessing you want your cup to run over you don't want the devil to hold back anything that God has promise you could we hear a shout in the [Music] [Applause] house so I realize that we have to get real radical oh yeah amen we have to get a different approach alog together to what belongs to no you're not asking for what don't belong to you you know you see sickness don't belong to you you mean negative that don't belong to you depression and frustration that's not yours so we're not talking about what doesn't belong to you we talking about the Breakthrough and the deliverance and the Victory and the overcoming and the power over the lust of the eyes and the power over the lust of the Flesh and the power over the pride of life I'm talking about the these are the things that belong to you oh your possession is not just natural hallelujah praise God give the Lord a shout listen the world we going through is a real world this is not our real world oh hallelujah praise God God tell him watch uh only thou be th strong courageous verse 7 that thou May observe to do watch according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn here we go not from the right or to the left in other words don't let nobody shake you off the mark that the fathers have set don't let nobody turn you from the left or the right hallelujah it's not what this Minister feel or this pastor feel or this group feel is what the word says and as long as the word said it I could stand on it I could prophesy on it I could die on it or I'll rise on it as long as God said it that's it oh Hallelujah well I feel that's your feeling well I think that's your thought but what did God [Applause] say we have to come to that spot you know because some of you like to talk what the doctor say but what did God say then you got to challenge what the doctor say by what God say by his stripes I I am healed that's what God Said and when you come to that spot where you're returning back to walking by faith when brother bam claimed his healing he was eating and he had stomach problem and he was vomiting back out and come back out he push it back down because he was believing and acting as if it already done he was feeling worse but he was claiming the best he was feeling bad but claiming the promise of the father oh come on now that he's a Healer come on say Amen [Applause] somebody you always have to act before God react I shout it out again you always have to act before God reacts because your God coming to you is his reaction to your action you can't sit and do nothing that's why God tell Joshua every place you put your foot is come on now do I hear Believers in the house I want you to reject your present condition I want you to arrest your situation I want you to say to yourself the devil is truly a liar and a bluff I want you to believe that you could get your own I want you to believe that you could move into an actual possession from profession I want you to believe that you could be empowered [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] not I commanded thee oh oh verse eight this book of the law my Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong of a good courage and Be not Afraid neither be thou dism for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest amen so the people have to be strong amen and have good courage that they're not being led astray that they been led the right way yes but said the spirit speak expressly this is from results of decision results of decision there was a message he preached he said the spirit speak expressly in the latter days that some shall depart from defeat literally depart from it or they in the message they're in the Thunders but they depart from it what what what they depart from defate the Fate is what the prophet came to turn our hearts back to the Fate is what the fathers have set the faith is where the ancient landmarks have been set hallelujah praise God add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance put seven poles and put down your steak I a move from there I've got to have Temperance I've got to have patience I got have God is God yes yes to be like God if God said that's a promise that's a word that's a virtue that's a light that's a life yes I can live it yes I can have it there is a liar God said every place I put my foot that's mine I can have faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness I don't have to be rude to my husband I don't have to be abusive to my wife Oh Glory to God I don't have to have a spicy tongue oh give the Lord some praise His People I could be like Jesus walk like Jesus talk like Jesus Live Like Jesus some shall depart from the faith giv heat to seducing spirits and so forth how they will be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God we need people who are lovers of God they're radical they don't care they're single and they're still serving God they have no boyfriend but they're still serving God they have no girlfriend but they're still serving God hallelujah no wife no husband but you're still serving God doesn't matter you love God God first you're testifying about it you're expressing your love for God that's why you come to worship him that's why you have a joy to come in the house of God hallelujah mother have a child she have joy praise God to have a child but having a child is not easy you go through bird pains seeing about the child every day is not easy but the joy of the child takes you above the pain of the strain Oh Glory to God the pain and the strain and when you love God that Joy takes you above the stress the press the pain The Strain because you love him and you know that all things going to work together for your good to them that love God to them who are be called according to his purpose oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah Glory or you could go through pain and strain when there's love in the mix and there's no love there's that difference look at the church today still on Wednesday night to look at television don't go to prit no more no more altars the upper room has turned to supper room to boy enough tough chickens and sell it for 50 cents to pay the pastor the preacher that's not God program at all you're out of line God will never vindicate anything like that notice what God Said the last days heavy High minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despiser those that are good that's why I some mean nasty evil spirited so-called Christians amen amen amen because the Bible said they're going to be that way that's not Christians that's church members but amidst all of that there's going to be a people that hungering and tasting after righteousness because we don't have that righteousness belongs to God so you're not coming with your self-righteousness you don't do this you don't smoke you don't no you're not coming with that you come with a confession that you are wrong and he is right he's the one that's right he's the ones that worthy he's the one that deserve all the honor and all the praise Oh Glory to God if we going to make it it going to be the grace of God it wouldn't be our prayer it wouldn't be our kneeling down it pray all night no it will be the grace of God and if there's Grace here to enter in I'm saying jump in when the angel trouble Waters because the Angel going to trouble Waters this morning jump [Applause] in I want more is done but what you need is a prayer meance get woman and woman back to God to oldfashioned human line that's the truth I know it's scorching but better Scorch you now than you have to burn after a while amen now God looked down upon sacrifices God blessed Israel because he was with Israel here they come up now to the border line Moses had died Joshua was the new leader he was going to take the children across the other side he said get back and spy out the land 40 years had pass get back to the human line but Brandon he's crying out to the old Landmark again come back to believing in God Amen not your pay packet in God not in your husband and your money in your house believing in God for miracles for

to God you get in an atmosphere where people are disbelieving and fasting and St among one another arguing whether they belong to this church you will never hat out Christians all you hat out is sectarians bunch of denominational hateful division people praise God like Donald Trump they want to build walls but there's a prophecy against walls but brandham said the walls will come down it just need Joshua it just need the captain of the host it just need a bunch of people who willing to take orders to walk to walk to walk down them Jericho walls it just it just a thing of people they want a pastor they want the best educated man the best dressed one the one who can get on the platform and look the best great tall guy six-footer ha flowing like that he said brother you got to get away you got away from the human line I'd rather have a man preach to me with a pair of overalls on with mud on his shoes and know God that all the DD and PhD and whatever you could put before me get back to the human line where's the Full Gospel where's divine power where it's divine revelation where it's inspiration upon the promises because Peter by these promises that's what you come to church for you don't come to church to hear some dream or some idea or talk about Pluto and Mars and Jupiter that's not what they come the church for so we notice Jehosaphat had seen the results from the kind of life from his father when he served the Lord and when he didn't serve the Lord so all of that together taking us under under consideration Jehoshaphat had purpose in his heart to serve the Lord and to cling to the things that his father did at the beginning this is Jehovah jfat I like that at the beginning in other words he went back to the old landmark and then they clean out the rose it will be good for Pentecost to go back to the old Landmark it will be good for all of us to go back to the old landmark and clean out the rose what would happen if actually the Church went back to the old Landmark you talk about a cleaning up there already be one a Pentecostal to the sure word how many knows that true how people would be acting different yes sir Here We Go dressing different amen talking different it just would be altogether a different church if we went back to the old Landmark where we started from so God blessed him here we go God will bless anyone who will go back to the old landmark of the Bible amen and start from the Bible not according to theology with the lot of theology has come to the message now but some manmade theology but the true Bible theology that starts from the old landmark and move up God will move with you so God begin to bless Jehoshaphat and the first thing you know he begin to prosper him and I've noticed something but people with Prosper prosperity and people with big churches and the the tendency is to become like like they are God they are they are uh like independent in themselves like they their own absolute and so on B say a trap ministers feel that they could do anything I get away with it he said but you must still continue serving God it's God that we are serving he told David I took you from feeding sheep to serve my people and so on is God that take us and bless us and place us is God doing that you know you get this you get that you study and have your education and you get his job is that right and a stroke taken the morning you have what job something happen and God FL your straight hospital bed what job you have so you better start to worship and praise God for health for strength for Grace so you can't go in the power of your own might so what josepher begin to prosper almost done and he built up garrisons here we go he began to prosper and he built up all the garrisons so that the uncircumcised could not come in and that's what the churches need today is a Garrison of the oldtime apostolic teaching yes sir so this lukewarm formal in and out up and down doesn't get into our church amen what I say he say that's right that's right we have permitted too many things to creep in Brethren too many things that we left the old Landmark from the beginning to creep in amen we have never gared the church brother the time has come we in the last age we in the atomic age the time has come that they got a weapon that can shake this world from the orbit in 5 minutes into the Sun and cause a total anation they couldn't have done it before but the time has come the time has come for falling away the Bible said except they come of Falling Away the manine won't reveal himself the time has come for signs to follow the Believers we are the end time we in the latter rain we at a time when men will be hey High minded lovers of Pleasures one lovers of God truth Breakers and false accusers the time has come when they are teaching doctrines of devils perverting the Bible teaching into theories and theologies to draw groups of people away after them but the time has come that God will gather his church together under the one great Banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his powers among them and the great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the the time has come for the Pentecostal Church to make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and cut out all this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old Landmark the time has come out for the outpouring the time has come to Gathering the people the time has come for Jesus to come time is be here to give all his rewards Oh Glory to God hallelujah he said brother be careful that your clown isn't set on someone head the time has come where the end time time if they ever was going to do anything Brethren we're going to have to do it now because the time is hum Oh Glory to God hallelujah do you believe it am praise God so brother talk about the Waters of separation and then is a kitchen where you feed on the word you eat the next place is a kind of relationship of this type where you embrace your wife you stand there maybe in the paror you put your arms around her you tell her you lover her she's going to be the most darling in the world you have your marriage vow and so on and whatnot and then you are ready to enter into real Fellowship excuse me for this rude expression but that's not complete yet Fellowship complete can only come through relationship and the only way you can completely fellowship with your wife as your wife she never become your complete Fellowship to you until she has an abide in a relationship and that's the bedroom that's where life begins and that's the way it is with the church today we can never take Creeds and things and ever bring back real genuine Fellowship until we come into a relationship with God to be born Sons and Daughters of God you say that's rude preacher but it's the truth oh praise God what you need here in this Valley is an oldfashioned God sent sky blue sin killing religion the power of the Gospel back in the church again back to the blood of the Lord Jesus into Fellowship by relationship not Fellowship because you're in this church or in any church but Fellowship because you have a relationship with Jesus Christ may the Lord bless you let's all stand praise God and let's sing praise God hallelujah we are Marching over to Jerusalem we are Marching over to jerus turn around going to greet somebody as the preachers come to us oh [Music] jerus we are Maring over to Jer Jerusalem oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Jerusalem oh we are Marching over to Jerusalem oh we are Marching over to jerus jerus M oh Jerusalem

him oh and worship them hallelujah oh let's forget about ourselves concentr pray on him and worship Christ Our Lord oh worship Him worship Christ the lord can we give the Lord a hand of Praise one more time amen amen amen so I'd like to go straight to the scripture reading three portions of scripture reading from Romans 8 reading from 2 Peter 3 and also reading Revelation [Music] 21 thank you musicians reading Romans chapter 8 and reading verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we s uer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall reveal shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God I reading second Peter chapter 3 and reading from verse 1 2 Peter 3 and reading from verse verse one this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of Remembrance in other words he's saying I'm writing this to you to bring back this to your memory that ye may be might mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scuffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant in other words they are choosing to be ignorant that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standed out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and pedition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved here's the question what manner of persons ought ye to be in all conversation and Holiness all conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the Longs suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction so Peter is exalting and he starts to speak about what Paul is saying in the other letters and he said ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall it from your own steadfastness but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen and our last scripture Revelation 21 and reading from verse 1 Revelation 21 and verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the water of of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen amen amen amen so I have a title this morning led by the spirit into that Eternal Church age LED by the spirit into that Eternal Church age and my subject the destination of the Overcomers the destination of the Overcomers and an inspiration he that overcometh shall inherit all things now my title I took my title in part from the message a statue of a perfect man where brother brandham said now we are approaching the Seven Seals and we have just finished the seven Church ages and then he says something profound he said this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in that church age that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals so what is an age an age is a period of time so what is a church age a church age is a period of time that's reserved for a specific church and the first time the word church is found in scripture is in Matthew 16 where Jesus says Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it so but the brandom is coming at the end of all of this and he's saying that this message that I'm bringing the seven Church ages the Seven Seals is a message that's going to tie the man that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's going to be in that Eternal Church age so he's not talking about being in Leia because leosia has a beginning and it has an ending he's not talking about being in Ephesus because Ephesus has a beginning and has an ending but this eternal Church age that he's talking about could have never had a beginning it could never have an ending because it's Eternal and anything that is eternal can not have a beginning or cannot have an ending can the church say Amen so he's talking with the people to go into a specific age now we understand when we read scripture God existed alone he is in eternity he is by himself he's a self-existent one he can't even be called God because God is the object of worship but when he creates the Angels now he is God because the angels are worshiping him but there are certain attributes that he want to express and we have heard this preach before but it take a great God to put a pause to slip from eternity and create time so almighty God from eternity made a little crack and says in the beginning now remember God cannot die he cannot disappear he is God he is eternal and he is in eternity but all of a sudden time is created because in order for God to express his attributes fully it cannot be in eternity he could only express his attributes in time in eternity there is no time there is no morning there is no evening so God couldn't come in the cool of the evening to fellowship with than anybody in eternity CU there's no morning there's no evening there's no night there's no summer there's no spring there's no winter in eternity there's no sickness there's no pain there's no heartache there's no struggle so in Genesis God starts time and that same God if it took God to start time it'll have to take God as the mighty Angel to end the time that's why the devil hates two books he hates the book of Genesis and he hates the Book of Revelation because Genesis is where time began and Revelation is where time is going to end because there are some people who are walking the Earth who are not creatures of time but they are creatures of Eternity and they're just passing through from point to point but one day they're going to reconnect to who they really are one day they're going to reconnect to where they really come from somebody say Amen you may be seated so in Genesis in the beginning Let There Be and let there be time began to tick for the first time there was no clock before Genesis there was no calendar before Genesis there was no morning and the first day and know that all started in Genesis for the first time there came something that God could measure there was a first day there was a second day there was a third day for the first time there's something that could be measured there's a fifth day there's a sixth day and on the seventh day God rested anybody with me this morning but what God was doing and I'm seeing it so clar the prophet said God is a God who he loves to show what he's doing in secret but it's only when it's finished and you look back to it he's been saying the same thing over and over and over again uh God had certain attributes that had to be displayed uh he had certain things in him that he wanted to give to his children but how could he do it unless he had children how could he save unless somebody fell so with the brandham said everything was in God's mind as his attributes he said you were in his mind he said the birds were in his mind the animals were in his mind uh the moon was in his mind uh the sun was in his mind the Earth was in his mind and God expressed it and because God expressed it it came to pass and God allowed the devil to run around in his Eden and Satan took his best shot his best shot and man fell and God smiled to himself because God said now I'll be a savior now I'll be a redeemer now I'll be a [Applause] [Music] restorer you may be seated but what the devil doesn't understand the Earth was not his thought because brother brandham taught us the devil cannot create he can only pervert so you come into God's creation and try to pervert God's creation and you're playing in time which God created time in the first place it's a losing battle because whenever God is ready he could say time no longer and he could end the whole cycle and I say s is this the time for time to be no more s is this the time for some individuals to go to that Eternal Church age that age that always was that age that never began that age that could never end a place where there's no sickness a place where there's no sadness a place where there's no depression a place can the church sayen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so when Adam fell because every mystery was not known to him he didn't know what was going on so when he fell Adam went into hiding and that's what happened to so many of us whenever something goes wrong we go into hiding we hide at home we hide in the group we hide somewhere we hide in our work we do something because we can't figure it out Adam didn't realize that there was blood for him that there was Mercy for him on the Judgment seat and instead of Adam looking for God God is now looking for Adam Adam where are you Adam I'm looking for you every evening I come down to talk to you I spoke to you yesterday where you are today and there was Adam hiding covering himself he said I heard your voice and I hid myself because I was naked he said who told you you were naked have you done what I told you to not do but this was all God's plan being unfolded but God made a promise to himself I will restore I will restore Eden I will restore Fallen man I will restore the son no wonder the whole creation is groaning it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God can the church say Amen I'm just warming up Hallelujah so there's blood Adam didn't know that there was blood for him he didn't understand that there was blood on The Mercy Seat he didn't know about the blood he covered himself but God had another covering for him there was a blood sacrifice of lambs that could cover him but there was a perfect sacrifice to come that was going to remove his sin completely as if you never did it in the first place uh can the church say amen and once you are under the blood the devil could only point and he could point but he can't touch you you know why because the Devil Himself cannot come under the blood you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me today when you are under the blood he could only point and try to accuse you but he can never touch you because you are under the blood and the devil cannot come under the blood because to come under the blood you had to have representation by predestination to be under the blood to be under the blood you have to repent and accept this gospel and the devil cannot repent and accept this gospel so he can only watch you but he cannot touch you your pastors doesn't matter your mistakes don't matter because there's blood for you this morning there's blood for you tomorrow there's blood for you until the day of your Redemption can the church say Amen you don't hear me this morning you may be seated can I preach a little bit I just trying to test the temperature a little bit because I want to make sure you understand that you have a destination and this destination is only for the Overcomers it's not for the church members it's not for people who stay there in the message there's a destination there's a destination it's an eternal Church age you may be seated what are you talking about brother Isaac we read the scripture I John saw a holy city I saw a new Heaven I saw a new Earth listen our inheritance is not out there somewhere this Earth belongs to manifested sons of God that's why the Bible says we shall reign on the earth the devil is squatting on our property sickness is squatting on our property sin is squatting on our property and we come to serve the devil notice that we know who we are we know what belongs to us you may be seated Hallelujah brother branam he made the connection clear he made the connection between the Natural Earth and between this Earth so he said listen this Earth was the attribute of God and because the devil came and messed it up God has to he is obligated to redeem it and this Earth Hallelujah is also the attribute of God and God has to redeem it because it's part of himself he can't leave listen if your hand get burnt and it's getting burnt you would leave it getting burnt all the time you will pull it back you will redeem your hand from that position that it's in because that hand is a part of your body you don't hear me this morning if your hand is caught in a door and the door is squeezing your hand you're not going to say oh God are getting squeez squeeze squeeze no after while are you going to redeem your hand because it's a part of you it there's some pain there there's some sensation so when you go through your trials he feels it he knows it he understands it so he is obligated to redeem you from your sickness redeem you from your condition redeem you you don't hear me this morning you may be seated don't use your intellect this morning don't use your mind this morning we are called to something higher we are called to something greater we are going to a new city we are going to New Jerusalem can the church say Amen you may be seated what are you saying preacher I hope everybody gets it this morning A lot of people are in the message and they don't understand what this whole message is about it is not even about a message because the message is a part of the whole story that started in Genesis and ends a very specific way in Revelation Hall [Applause] the ending of this story is not the church the ending of this story is not pastors and teachers and evangelists those are on the journey to the destination you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning so wait a minute we are born for a destination and along the journey you might pick up a job along the journey you might pick up a car along the journey you might pick up a wife a husband pick up something but that's not that's not it you're in church for a season church is temporary because that new Earth and that new heaven there's no church there it's the holy city New Jerusalem and in that City it's a kingdom there's a king that sits on the throne and that King has subjects those subjects are not pastors teachers it's not that those subjects are princes Sons They are Kings and priest that's why he is the king of kings because we are Kings and we are priests don't you know who you are you may be seated you are Kings you are priests he is the high priest you are a king he's the king of kings because we are Kings you don't hear me this morning there's power in you right now that the devil is afraid of when you walk Angels walk with you because you you are son of the king you are a king you are a king can the church say Amen you may be seated is there anybody in the house with me this morning I know you thinking about your bills and your problem and your back pain but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a new city there's no back pain in that City there's no pain in that City there's no Mortgage in that City you may be seated I'm going to jump ahead of my myself the Bible said Jesus said I'm going to prepare a place for you he said in my father's house are many mansions and but the said when you read that house don't mix it up he's not talking about a house that you see as a house he said that word house means Kingdom so my father's Kingdom there are many mansions there's no small house for you everybody gets a mansion you get a mansion you get a mansion you get a [Applause] mansion listen you get a mansion that you didn't even build because he's preparing a place but the Bram said he wants to prepare a place for his wife to her liking just the way she likes it so God knows your heart he knows what you like and he went to prepare a place in this new city and [Music] it's you may be seated so where are we at this morning we are back to the leadership of the spirit for [Music] what the spirit has to lead us to somewhere and that destination is New Jerusalem that destination is that new Earth that new city can the church say Amen we're going to go somewhere this morning hallelujah hallelujah so Genesis there's a fall everybody with me you have time today put on your seat belts so we're going on a journey this morning Genesis all the way to Revelation and Beyond can the church say Amen tell your neighbor get ready get [Music] ready so led by the spirit to your destination So Adam Falls and God begins to lead because you cannot find your way unless God leads you you don't know where you're going can we admit that we don't know where we're going and without the leadership of the Holy Spirit Joshua said it like this we have not passed this way before so anybody who is moving without the Holy Ghost is really guessing that's right and I don't care how good the guest is I don't want the guess I want the guide can the church say Amen so we must be led by the spirit to rightly divide the word because if you are part of the word you must know which part of the word you are because if you know which part of the word you are then you know what to expect then you know how to prepare yourself then you got to know where to tell the devil to get off because you are in your position can the church say Amen so here we find a man that God finds to lead by the spirit and this man is Abraham and what does Abraham do the Bible said he is seeking a city that's right this same city I'm talking about whose Builder and maker is God could it be the holy city could it be a special City could it be the New Jerusalem listen to the prophet in the message future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said are you ready this is the city that Abraham was looking for so this city that John saw coming down from heaven is what Abraham was looking for listen being a Prophet The Prophet said he know the city was somewhere so way back in Genesis he was a man of God and his first inclination when he gets led by the spirit is I'm looking for that City because this world is not how it's supposed to be there's got to be something more than this this cannot be what I'm called for and he's looking for a city the Bible said he forsook the city he lived and he went over and look where he went he was looking for a city whose Builder and jaob was God hallah listen to The Prophet Jesus going to prepare with the Divine hands a Divine City Divine architect for a Divine bought people for a predestinated people he is going to prepare so Jesus is not is doing something he's preparing for some people everybody with me this morning and listen Abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger oh yes that's good now that's powerful because many of us we want to be citizens of this world we want to make sure we have a good presence our name our reputation what we are but but not Abraham he said I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger he said I don't belong here I don't need what you have to offer because I'm on my way to somewhere I'm seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God do you know where it is can you tell me where it is do you know somebody who knows where it is because that's where I want to be I don't want to be here it's all right to have a house but that's not my house that's temporary that's that's going to end one day Heaven and Earth will pass away but this city I'm talking about whose Builder and maker is God I've got to get there I want to see it I want to be there can the church say Amen listen brother B said that Prophet knowing it was somewhere he said John saw it coming down but listen to The Prophet but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then so Abraham is now starting out the journey this is the beginning of the story and he's seeking for that City and he's like where is it but the said he thought it was there right then brother Bram said I'm looking for that City just like my father Abraham did are you looking for that City this morning but the BR described the city said streets of gold Avenues and Parks if you want to read it the tree of life will be there with 12 different kinds of fruit one for each month you have a different diet every month he said the people that eat these fruit they change their diet every month he said it's only for the Overcomers it isn't for denomination can the church say amen he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit say to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God Overcomers only that overcome the Beast overcome his mark That's Catholicism protestantism denominationalism who overcome the Beast his Mark the letter of his name he'll have a right to the tree of life that's what Adam had access to the Tree of Life to enter into the gates where nothing that defile could ever go in see hallelujah hallelujah the tree of life will be for Overcomers only the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations and the kings that live in there bring their honor in when they bring their honor in and lay Before the Throne of God one for each tribe when they bring their honor from the Blessed land in there they'll reach from the Tree of Life this must be real to you friends and break off a leaf from the Tree of Life and they'll walk out together because there'll be no more war everything is at peace so what is brother Bram saying in that new city there are people who are on the inner circle and the people on the outside and those on the outside the King Alone can come in to get a leaf but that's not the bride the bride is on the inside access to the Tree of Life all the time access to the fountain all the time access all the time you don't hear me this [Applause] morning listen to The Prophet there was a tree of life in the Garden of Eden and talking about Adam he might have eaten from it might have eaten from it if he hadn't fell the tree of life was to remind him all the time his youth was continually going on same with the Nations the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations can the church say Amen am sh Hallelujah

leave this place we're going to have power you may be seated with the brandom said throughout all the ages nobody nobody you may be seated could have stopped the devil they pushed them back they pushed him back they pushed him back but every time they push them back he always came up again even when Jesus was here he pushed the devil back but he came back again but this time is different because the ages time is coming to an end there's an eternal Church age and the devil has to be finished [Applause] [Music] before you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me tonight I feel so good the devil is going to be finished the finish the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever we have had them from every age they were in osus in smia in pergamos in tyy in sadis in

you are creatures of Eternity who belong to an eternal Church [Applause] age you may be seated if you can let me give you the secret why this is possible hallu why this age is so significant when you read the book of Revelation there were certain secrets to the Overcomers in each Age come on now but because you are not from Leia and because you are from what we call the bride age or the Eternal Church age and you're from eternity you have access to pick up everything that those in the other ages had you could pull up their power you could pull up the anointing you could pull up the inspiration you could pull up the promises for the first time you may be seated no wonder Abraham was searching but he couldn't see it yet because time had to unfold some more but now we the end of time but the brand call it the fullness of time when time runs out all the power that was in Jesus is poured into his bride you may be [Applause] seated Hallelujah you may be seated listen friends in each age I'm talking about the church ages now and there are so many types in scripture you read The Book of Leviticus there are seven feasts the Feast of Tabernacles and the Feast of and all the different feasts said each Feast represented a church age those in that day didn't know what they were representing Hallelujah Paul irenius Marth Columbo Luther Wesley they had no idea what was going on there were pieces that were being played on a board but your position is different you are now looking at the board for the first time there are people on the Earth who can look back and know every [Applause] mystery because those things which are revealed belong unto us every loose end has been tied up why because God sent a prophet to tie up the Loose Ends to reveal the secret things of God so that there could be some Overcomers the revelation of how to overcome is not for church Wars and to have conventions no it's to put us in that new city you may be seated I am so excited [Music] huj Overcomers amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the Rapture is a revelation not to a group to an individual if I'm the only one in Trinidad to go I'm going is there anybody else is there anybody else is there anybody [Applause] else you may be seated you got to know your message you got to understand what this is all about Hallelujah so let me drop this in here because understand my title led by the spirit into that Eternal Church age my subject the destination of the Overcomers because only Overcomers are going to make it so this is an encouragement to you because if you have something to overcome that already makes you a candidate Hallelujah because if you don't have a trial God a even looking at you and the bigger the trial you have the better it is because it makes you a real over come up oh you don't hear me this morning turn up to heat somebody seven times hotter brother kangali seven times hotter because I want to overcome why do I want to overcome listen here Revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the sameen these Overcomers shall be clothed in white remit Hallelujah and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life Hallelujah but I will will confess his name before my father and before his angels so when you overcome a little trial this is what's going on your name isn't getting blood out your name is being confessed why because you're an overcomer Revelation 3:12 him not overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out what's that no more backsliding no more you're feeling this way this day and next day you're feeling Sunday you're feeling on fire you charge Eternal City Eternal Church by when say what age is this again but to him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem so you get in a stamp New Jerusalem new city Eternal Church age you're going why because you overcome which cometh down out of Heaven from my my God and I will write upon him my new name Hallelujah huj is this getting home to anybody this morning brother nice you see why the Trials Come hot and heavy so you could prove to the devil you could overcome and the more you and listen it's it's harder and harder you know nobody goes from standard five to stand three to stand two to first year anybody ever did that Hallelujah but when he finish first year is second year and the standard one then it's under two then it's lion then it's bear then it's Goliath Hallelujah so count yourself blessed because there's a bigger trial coming but he who started the work in you is more than able to finish it in the scripture you read he said I am Alpha and Omega I am the beginning and the end I'm the one writing the story I'm at the beginning of the book When Your Story starts and I'll be there the end of the story to make sure you're going to make it you somewhere in the middle and you feel like you're swimming in the deep end but you're going to be all right you're going to be okay you're going to be all right turn to your neighbor and tell them you're going to be all [Music] right [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah so we talking about Overcomers Hallelujah goes on but I want you to understand this because brother Bram typed out he said each of these scriptures of overcoming was given to each Church age right but you are not from those Church ages so these overcoming scriptures are actually your collection your badges so let's keep building now to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne Oh my he that had an a let him hear what the spirit said to the church him that overcome will I give to eat of the Hidden Manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it not even your pastor know it the bishop don't know it but he himself looking at you overcoming say I'm going to give you a new name you're no longer going to be called Jacob you're going to be called Israel you're no longer going to be Saul you going to be Paul you're no longer going to be Abraham you're going to be Abraham because you overcome you're no longer going to be Sarah you be Sarah because you overcome are there any Overcomers in the house this [Applause] morning Hallelujah he was so powerful a brother in the convention was speaking about Jacob and Israel and and we spoke about how Jacob through deceit he was able to get inheritance but the charge or the crime or the indictment or the prosecution was against Jacob but when Jacob wrestled with the angel and he overcame he was no longer Jacob he was now Israel and you cannot charge Israel for what Jacob did because he had a you don't hear me this morning you can't put a charge on Israel for what Jacob did so when this holy ghost thing we talking about takes a hold of you and change your inside what sin what sin what you talking about it wasn't [Applause] me you may be seated come on we going somewh to him that overcometh I'm going to give a new name it's your promise let me give you another one let me give you another one God told Abraham the same Abraham you're going to have a son all right but because his wife doubted you say use Hager and Abraham and haga had ishmail you will not know why when God told Abraham Abraham I want you to offer your son your only son Isaac only son what happened to ishma you know what happened you can't charge Abraham for when he was Abraham you can't charge a new man for what the old man did the brother asked what was ishmael's surname and what was Isaac's surname Isaac's name was Abraham is s was Abraham that was the old man you can't charge the new man for what the old man did somebody help me preaching you want to know where this is going let's let's let's keep it going Saul and Paul sa of tus Prosecuting the church he have a reputation wherever he go pray meeting shut down people going to hide him but when he met God on the journey and his name changed CH listen to Peter Peter in his script says and beloved brother Paul had exalted you he wasn't saying that man who was no you cannot charge Paul for what Saul did Satan take your hands off of God's Property we belong to God we are going back to God my past is over your mistakes are over your sins are over your failures are over who can lay a charge to God's elect it is God that justify it you may be seated feeling good in here this morning feel like we going somewhere this morning you still have time right told Brother but a feeling life some like some some longer Services you know because we see we measure thing in time but I already to switch to Eternity when you switch to Eternity clock don't matter time don't matter anymore we don't belong here we go to Eternity Fellowship David waiting on you Moses want to fellowship with you Joshua want to hear how you make it he just had to deal with Jericho but you had all kind of evil spirits on your job in your neighborhood but you overcame just as they overcame and all the Overcomers from every age will be in that new [Music] [Applause] city you may be seated but the brandom said the types brother Knights must be perfect throughout scripture perfect throughout scripture so when even when Jesus was at Mount Transfiguration brother Bram said it was also a type because who did he have with him Moses and Elijah why Moses and Elijah because Moses was representing the saints that were died that were were going to be resurrected Elijah was representing those that were in the Rapture he said that mount Transfiguration was a type of Mount Jerusalem the new city with Jesus on the top of the throne and with him those that from all ages were resurrected but also the bride who were raptured which there's only one group being raptured it's us that's right Elijah and Enoch that's the Rapture crew amen [Applause] only Enoch Elijah and this bride will have the testimony of rapture no wonder Abraham say he wish he could have been here and David say he wish he could have been here because we shall not all sleep we have the testimony we shall be changed so if that's no wonder the prophet say if how could we have faith for the Rapture if we don't have faith for Divine Healing when at the end of the day this body have to change anyway so if his body to change to the Rapture cancer have to back down your blind is have your arthritis have to back down your back pain have to back down what is migraine who's who's send migraine back to the devil it came from let him have a migraine that's his own it's not yours what female condition you talking about that's not your promise you are daughter of the Living God rebind rebuke send that back to where it came from we are children of the most high we are Sons and Daughters of a living God it's time the sons of God stand up and take their position on the earth because we shall reign on the earth let me hear you say it we shall rain on the earth one more time we shall on the earth one more time give the Lord a shout of [Music] [Applause] praise I don't think I'm going to finish this message today but what I would say when you start a break in The Eternity that church here the food just get better and better it just get juicy the food just get good you know say listen the Mana the hidden Mana Us hidden Mana yet hidden Mana coming new city food coming this is just a little taste there a little taste of what to come the upper room was a taste of what to come amen that's right and brother was so excited wow Hallelujah he that had an air I'm still stuck there he let me hear what the spirit say to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God he that overcometh all shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son now these were the promises that the Overcomers in every age now all the promises of every age are gathered in this time the time of the manifestation of the seven Thunders that's right because that has to happen before we leave this place that's right seven Promises to the Overcomers of each age and now to the Overcomers I will inherit all things my my my my my but the B said there will come a time friends listen people we not Gathering here in vain we're only waiting for that time it is it is very very late but Jesus is still very very near and His glory is wonderful hallelujah hallelujah my my my my my so we talk being led by the SP I'm going to skip we're going to skip some parts so friends the Holy Spirit has to lead you to the revealed word of your day remember the BR did a type he said a th Years is as one day and a day is a th years so he says so the first day back in Genesis first the second third fourth fifth 6th 7th day was the resting day and he said throughout the ages and he goes to the type he said your word for your day if you have the wrong word is as if you living on the wrong day yeah so your day is Thursday but you you you you already think it's Monday and you reach late to the appointment cuz you on the wrong timetable you looking at the calendar the wrong way yeah because if a day has an expectation then you have to know the word for your day so you must be led by the spirit to the word for your day just as Simeon was led by the spirit to the word for his day which was Messiah and blind Anna was led by the spirit without seeing and this is types in scripture to show that it's not even natural eyes but it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit not man's leadership you're not here because of man I pray that you will not hear because of man because man will always fail but this Holy Spirit can never fail he's the comforter he's the guide he said I will never leave you I'll never forsake you can the church say Amen but expectations he said the same reason that you are here tonight you see I'm so used to checking for my time but I'm not even amen you you can take some more right the same reason you are here tonight you sick people the same holy ghost that led Simeon the same holy ghost that led Anna has led you here for you believe that there's a fountain open somewhere for healing it's here God moving among his people so the Holy Spirit friends could only lead you to the word that's right the young sister the Holy Spirit cannot lead you to cut your hair the Holy Spirit cannot lead you to wear clothes that's so tight that you could see what's going on the holy spirit will not lead you to wear a skirt that barely cut in your knee and I've preached on this a few times I want to make sure it clear so I want to I I don't say just I want to be very very clear you see cover your knee is not standing up covering the knee is not the the measurement of Co cover knee is not when he when he sitting down I'm speaking in my office this morning but over said this morning the pastor is in the house well the assistant pastor is in the house so I want to be very very clear I cannot speak for any church but holy decency and modesty you know what the Bible says present your body's a Living Sacrifice which is your reasonable service so God is saying this is not no rocket science no hard trial oh gosh did is your reasonable service amen amen because you cannot go to the new city dress the way s want to dress when you're not dressing for church you can't speak in the no City the way you want to speak when you're not speaking to people from church that's and let me give you notice now there will be no WhatsApp in in New City there's no Facebook in the new city there's no Snapchat Instagram Periscope trust me I know YouTube in the new city those things don't qualify for the new city even if you love them those things that you love not making it to the new city because but said nothing un rightous nothing contaminating nothing sinful nothing engineered by the god lowercase G of this evil age can make it to the new [Applause] city Heaven and Earth will pass away John said heard I saw the whole thing burn and destroy all of that going with [Applause] it I'm feeling good every gift has its place some always find myself in this in this groove but that's that's that's a requirement the holy spirit will never lead you to drink and smoke and people justify all kind of stuff and you want to go to the new city when it's dripping with blood the people going to be there the blood of disciples who stood for the truth and he want to barely make it in on on your little story and you didn't know what I was going through and that is that is why I drag myself Overcomers that's what I'm speaking to this morning the Overcomers who went to cut everything off and say listen I don't care what you have to offer I am seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God that's my focus that's my [Applause] priority can the church say Amen Hallelujah from the message return and Jubilee the church is a born against bunch of Believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God that's the definition I love it the church is a born again bunch of Believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God they are not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world that's what makes them what they are their life is dead and they are HID in Christ dead in Christ and hid sealed by the Holy Ghost sons of God are led by the spirit of God not led by some other fanatics or some organization or something or other they are led by the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise the children of God not our Bishops and Cardinals and big ministers and so forth but the Holy Ghost but the B said I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or a Pentecostal preacher I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believed it God promised it and there be a CH without spot or wrinkle can the church say Amen my my I'm going to skip some stuff we're going to touch it some of the time I wanted to hit on how the Spirit Led each individual the holy Spirit led Abraham the Holy Spirit Led Moses the Holy Spirit Led all through the scripture every type was the Holy Spirit leading them to the word for their day and you have to be led to the word for your day so let me just strike my text a little bit and we're going to begin to wind down in the message of future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride the brandom said these two scriptures we read from second Peter the 3r chapter and Revelation 21 they both speaking about the same subject but John didn't write it the way Peter [Music] I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea Peter goes a bit deeper but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up but when the Brandon begins to connect the dots because a lot of people believe that this means a world is being destroyed and but the bible say that is not the case the word pass away doesn't mean destroyed or annihilated it means transformed or changed amen so he goes back to Isaiah because Isaiah was the prophet that wrote the entire Bible in Prophecy so there are 66 books in the Bible and Isaiah wrote 66 chapters basically from Genesis to Revelation so around the middle he started with creation around the middle of the book there's John the Baptist and he winds up in verse 65 speaking about the Millennium and saying this is Isaiah in the Old Testament for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come in mind amen but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall no more more be heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more than an infant of days nor an old man this is in scripture in the Old Testament no more infants no more old men that had not filled his days for the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner of being 100 years old shall be a curse and they shall build houses and inhabit them and shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them and they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and he goes on speaking about the Millennium so but brandham brought her with the help of the holy spirit that the Earth is not being annihilated but it's the atmosphere and I want to get into this a little bit and it's the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed Hallelujah so what does it do butam said these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits that will be gone away amen because we are going to live right here amen so God is Not destroying the planet he's destroying the atmosphere the prince of the power of the air he's destroying sickness he's destroying evil he's destroying sin he's destroying demon powers and by the B go he say right now there are demons in the atmosphere pointing accusations at you but because of the blood God is seeing through the blood and they can't even get true to you that's the word that's the scripture people don't study the message but that's it amen but the B said now notice germs sickness and these things will all be completely taken away all that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heavens above us contaminated with evil spirits all that exists in the heavens and the atmosphere and the Earth this whole earth but the say it's holding stuff that wasn't it wasn't made for he said the purpose of the Earth was not to hold sin the purpose of the atmosphere was to hold Sin Sin caused it to be like that it was made by God the Creator and by the bom now brings it to our Earth he said and these bodies that we live in now that was put in the earth you are from the dust of the earth and sin come into your body that's why you get old sin come into your body that's why you get sick so he said the same way God redeems the Earth it's the same way he redeems the individual I'm not preaching any this [Applause] morning so he says the first step for man is this you repent you get baptized what for for the remittance of your sins and it's very clear because people don't get this remitting of your sins is your past sins so when you repent and you are baptized that takes you of the past it doesn't touch the present or the future years ago there was a brother who came to me said brother Isaac my son got baptized but he's still behaving the same way read the message repent and be baptized with the remittance of your sin so your sins of the past wiped away but by the brandham said in this same message there's still a snake inside the heart the repentance and the baptism that just the first spot that had taken that touching snake that dealing with remittance of your past he said something else must happen first he said you must go through sanctification because you have be set aside for service he said sanctification gets your mind right no only the Bible say be transformed by the renewing of your mind you have to have different company you have to have a different talk you have to put prayer in its place you as I said to them in the Nigeria convention when you wake up in the morning the first thing you reach for shouldn't be your phone you got to get your mind right he said that sanctification set aside for service then brother brandham now he makes a subtle separation between Holy Ghost and Fire he says because the fire comes to burn the steak and the Holy Ghost comes to dwell in there anybody with me this morning so as an individual you repent you baptized so that baptism washes away the old man but now you got to get Sanctified set aside for service and then the Holy Ghost and Fire comes down and burns the snake and all of a sudden the snake is no longer in there it's not a dove it's the Holy Ghost are you with me and that's the process for man to be redeemed but the B said that's the same thing God is doing with the Earth she said every 2,000 years in two days something happens so God baptized the Earth with water everybody with me on this right and then the next 2,000 years he sprinkled blood no wonder the Bible said this Earth is reserved for fire because water and blood not taking the sin out it'll have to take fire to burn the devil to burn the demons to burn the spirits to burn and wherever they hiding you can't hide from fire fire going to find it once you lose the fire that's why you got to have fire in your life you got to have fire in the church you got to have fire in your walk you may be seated friends this is to help you along your Christian Journey because if you have been baptized and you repented of your sins you now you now barely stting because after you repent and you baptized you get Sanctified then you get filled with the Holy Ghost and the brandom goes deeper he said now there's a baby and that baby has to grow up because a birth nobody born as a big man so you are baby in Christ when you're born again no wonder the Pentecostal they had a birth they had a birth but they never became mature so that baby has to grow up and now by the tutor watching your conduct and your behavior with what you have done with the gift of God in you now you can head to adoption Amen to now a son that can have the authority of the father when you speak and you say unto one go he has to go say unto one come he has to come why a son in position proven tested tried character development as the pastor loves to say can the church say Amen so the Bram in the message future home of the Heavenly bride and the Earthly bride he brings a connection he said water blood spirit as it is with man it is with the Earth as it is with the Earth it is with man God cannot change he is the same he is the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever can the church say amen he said if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions are met he cannot change can the church say amen he said if he ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever filled a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if you ever Raise A Man from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle he doesn't change there's no shortcut it's got to be that way can the church say Amen am amen amen hallelujah amen hallah glory amen so the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost in so with the brandom brings a connection clar he said listen how could the Holy Ghost dwell in this vessel if there's sin and lust and enmity and anger and jealousy in there it has to take fire to burn it out and how could a holy God come to dwell on this Earth if there's sin and lust and Evil on the Earth so we already had the Earth baptized with water Jesus already came and dropped blood to sanctify it it's just went with a fire to burn and when the fire consumes everything now all of a sudden there could be a connection now once more that City could come down from heaven and rest in its place amen everybody with me this morning amen I believe somebody's understanding where we're going friends Hallelujah skip a little bit here I have a I have a lot of stuff here I'm not even halfway through praying from Marathon so the heart has to be cleansed the prophet said like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost amen which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it first must be repented it must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the holy fire and holy ghost from God comes down burns out all the desire of sin all the nature of the world Amen everybody clear with me on this amen can the church say amen amen skip through here I already touched a lot of the things already see the Earth redeem it goes back so brother bam is saying now that when the fire claims the Earth the Earth redeemed go goes back to its original owner he took it from Satan he pulled taking the Earth away from Satan just like he took you you away from Satan like he took the little woman at the well away from Satan there stood a priest he thought he was okay with God but that woman had representation and Satan will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you that's good that's good can the Church Say Amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen skip through here Glory so brother brandham goes in this message and I really encourage you friends it is really important that you get into these messages I mean when you get into the word it's such it's such a joy and a blessing to see everything begin to jump out and when you out of the word you ready you come to church you're lost in this should be your food every single day I wish I could go into all of this with you today but you need to get this and and this is your homework for this week future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride that's your homework for this week and we will test it next week Lord willing that's good brother Bram said and the heavens will pass away to Great noise he said the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases in the earth and explode it Peter said the heaven will pass away and the Earth with a great noise is such an explosion will rock it because it's got to kill this is why it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn everything there is the fire will burn it up he said it's a holy fire it will take away Satan and all of his Devils both Heaven and Earth will pass away killing all the germs insects all natural life around it even the water talk about a noise and brother BR said there's always noise when I said you when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there she said fire on the earth fire in your life there's going to be noise because something is happening is anybody want a Holy Ghost Fire [Music] experience Hallelujah so this is part of teaching message I know a lot of young people they don't know this stuff this is this is the Caleb some some of the calebs I I'll leave that comment Hallelujah so brother brandham goes deeply in Heaven and Earth will pass away and he talk about the passing and what and what the word means what it means a transformation a change he says uh Jesus us a same word for a pastor he says a change of man he's a changed person so he goes to say it's it's the same you it's the same your same height but now there's a holy ghost in there it's a different man so you look at jaob one day and look at Israel the next day he looks the same but it's a different man because a change took place and that's what's happening to the Natural Earth as well brother B said one time I was the devil's property I was his property but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now can the church say amen hallelujah I want to skip down begin to wrap up here like he did us his creation of the living before he could come in it he had to give us the baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost come in and live the baptism of fire then then and then when you get that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can come in that's what he was talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear understanding watch it vindicate itself it can't work sometimes and then don't work other times it has to vindicate itself every single time it's got to be the entire word to be the bride you have to be a part of him because he is a word and what a part of him is it it's a word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride can the church say amen amen I want to skip through here so brother Brandon brings a type he says listen we know it's seven days but he said when it goes back to the eighth day which is the first day we are now into eternity so but the B said the Millennium is not that Eternal Church age he said because in the Millennium is work he said after that after the seals after the Millennium it's that new time now it's that new age now and that's your promise a holy time a holy convocation that's your promise that's your inheritance that's where we are going can the church say Amen there's your holy convocation the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the Eighth Day Hallelujah your holy convocation another Jubilee time again whole creation Gro in for that day it's the kingdom of God with eternal life creatures of Eternity that's what you are born for it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved because you are a creature of Eternity can the church say Amen my my my my my brother said a trout fish cannot be a tadpole he was always a trout it doesn't matter where he is he's always a trout so on the a day friends it's eternity amen the musician can get ready Hallelujah through here hallelujah so much been said already you can't recognize somebody else's message if Moses would have come with Noah's message Noah was a part of it but it wouldn't have worked if Jesus would have come with Moses message it wouldn't have worked see it was a different age it was a different prophecy a different part of the word had to be fulfilled there was another day of the week I want to just get this in there not Tuesday's work cannot be done on Wednesday that's how the prophet said it and Wednesday's work has got to be done on Wednesday Saturday has to be Saturday's work so you have to know what day you're living in and what God requires from you for this day amen that's good can the church say Amen so the whole creation is groaning waiting for somebody to step forward to take their position yes sir to see cancer go to backing up to see sin go to backing up somebody has to break out May It Be this day may it be here friends May somebody break through in the name of Jesus but ROM talked about a new city 1500 square miles he said 1500 this way, 1500 that way 1500 high and on there and that's why I ask the song leader to sing song like going to Jerusalem and in that city where the lamb is the light because that's going to be the light of that City is nothing like you have ever seen before and I want to be there I'm going to be there hallelujah hallelujah all the ages heading for that day heading for that City do you want to be there friends there'll be no more Graves there'll be no tear drops there'll be no more Bloodshed there'll be no more walls there'll be no more clouds of winter no more hot sun the grass will never burn the desert shall bring forth roses God said so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said when will it be after fire strikes this world it's going to happen Satan's sin and sinners will be gone forever we would have blended into eternity can the church say Amen oh no more sin no more sickness no more old age no more perversion nothing will ever touch that s but Holiness the Redeemer I just feel so good but the but the brandom said God and His creation and his creatures of this creation is Redeemed by his own blood cleansed by his own cleansing process his germ killing sin killing process and when this process finishes sin sickness nothing will stand it it's your sterilized the best sterilization we have ever had has been fire oh my but say you could take anything and wash it with soap suds and all these chemicals that they talk about about it's still ain't free but you burn it once it's a whole different story he said when the Holy Fire of God sterilizes the Earth with the chemicals he has to lift his bride which can come into heaven with him while this is going on and comes back to Earth again a new Heaven and a new Earth the cold winter can't stop it the hot summers can't hurt it the devil is not going to be thereare to even stop you no more mind battles no more

Lord oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my my my my my my my Liv God oh my brother Bram said imagine a Divine architect will build a city he said you could imagine any man marrying a wife that's able he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch just what she would like now the Divine architect has designed a new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the apostles said eyes has not seen ear has not heard or neither has it entered the heart of man let's see if we can probe into it the Divine architect has designed a way for you has designed a place for you he said remember it's not heaven he said John saw it coming out of Heaven it's to be on this Earth this Earth is going to pass away it's a redeemed the Earth God didn't say he was going to raise up a new generation he's going to redeem the one that's here he ain't going to raise up a new generation he redeems the one that he's already called Hallelujah God isn't looking to replace you he's looking to redeem you he's going to restore you he's going to baptize you oh you B slider you going to make it you going to make it hallelujah oh my my my my mind that Great Pyramid he said that new city is going to be a pyramid he talks about the three Bibles he talk about Enoch left a sign of that pyramid and that's where the new city is going to be it's a mountain and it's my it's it's just too much to get into right now 1500 miles this way 1500 miles up there will be all the redeem houses of pure gold Avenues and parks and Gardens and the River of Life coming trickling down from the throne and running through the little chasms All Over The Terraces and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bearing fruits 12 times a year a different fruit each month that's your promise that's your inheritance can the church say Amen a city with a throne on top they need no light for the lamb and the Lord God is the light the Lord God is a pillar of Fire the same fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness he's ascended on his throne and because of fire he now connect with his bride in that new city that New Jerusalem that Holy City that's your Dwelling Place in eternity come on you sons of God don't you know who you are don't you know what you are born to do it won't be long but the Bram said it's not going to be long we are getting out of here hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and in here will dwell the redeemed amen hallelujah these Avenues and big freeways as it was parks in a River of Life will draw right run through it and every house will be made of transparent gold I know it sounds crazy but this is real this is our reality we've gotten so used to accepting what this world has to offer we've gotten used to being time we' gotten used to being sick we got used to the routine of taking medication every day but that's now not what it's supposed to [Applause] be he said the tree of life will be there and will bear 12 manners of fruit and the Kings and the honored man of the earth that's not the bride now that's those outside the city shall bring their honor and glory to the gates and the Gat shall not be shut by night because there is no night there no more night right now weeping may endure for a night and joy com in the morning but over there there is no night no more weeping no more crying no more sighing no more pain no more feeling depressed no more feeling discouraged a different [Applause] [Music] vocabulary only to the Overcomers it'll be worth it hallah Hallelujah Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time and not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be seen in US amen amen amen oh my h brother B said there is one bride not a doesn't denomination but one bride as the elect out of the earth that's been predestinated to this amen only the elect that predestinated to this will be in that new city amen listen how he defines them the ones who can recognize their place in the Kingdom you know what the prophet said one day she will recognize who she is and then the Rapture will go one day you will know that I'm in the father he and me and I and you one day you're going to have a revelation that Satan cannot hold you anymore your past cannot hold you anymore your mistakes cannot hold you anymore your failures cannot hold you anymore they have have to release you the same fire that releases you will release this Earth from the grips of Satan forever finally the lamb could eat with the lion finally we could walk into our place once more oh God help us but the brand said on this Throne look so high the new city 12 gates Jesus The Headstone he said no wonder Enoch didn't cap the pyramid because that new city Jesus alone sits on top of the pyramid in that city where the lamb is the light and unto them that overcome it will sit with me in my Throne that's your promise that's your inheritance led by the spirit all these years into that Eternal Church age oh my oh my the said the Pyramid of Enoch cast no shadow no time of day he said I've been in Egypt at the pyramid it's so geographically fixed and in the dimension of this great geometrical figure that no matter where the sun is there's never a shadow around the pyramid he said there'll never be no night there with him on top of the mountain it floods with all of his glory the glory of God all around no more shadow in your life no more darkness in your life no more confusion in your life no more wondering am I going to make it am I going to get the Holy Ghost is my son going to be
