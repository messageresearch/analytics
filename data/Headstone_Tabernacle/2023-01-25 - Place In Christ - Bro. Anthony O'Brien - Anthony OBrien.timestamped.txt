[24:07] Saints for the work of the ministry
[24:10] for the edifying of the body of Christ

[24:41] and toward the end
[24:43] to pick this up
[24:46] what Paul says here so what and what
[24:49] shall I more say for the time would fail

[24:57] Samson and of Japan
[24:59] of David also and Samuel and of the
[25:03] prophets
[25:05] who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote
[25:08] righteousness obtain promises stop the
[25:12] mouth of lions quenched the violence of
[25:16] Fire escape the edge of the sword
[25:20] out of weakness were made strong waxed
[25:24] Valiant in fight
[25:26] turn to flight the armies of the aliens
[25:28] women received their dead raised their
[25:31] life again and others were tortured not
[25:35] accepting Deliverance that they might
[25:37] obtain a better Resurrection
[25:40] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[25:43] and scourgings yay moreover of bonds of
[25:48] imprisonment
[25:49] they were stoned they were sown asunder
[25:52] were tempted were slain with the sword
[25:55] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[25:58] goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[26:02] tormented of whom the world was not
[26:05] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[26:08] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[26:12] earth verse 39 and all these are these
[26:15] all having obtained a good report
[26:17] through faith received not the promise
[26:21] God having provided some better thing
[26:24] for us that they without us should not
[26:27] be made perfect may God have blessing to

[27:25] you breathe life into it father and Lord
[27:27] may you minister to your people tonight
[27:29] Lord what you would have to say what you

[27:49] praise God
[27:51] [Music]
[27:55] amen you love him tonight praise God
[27:58] it's great to be in his house amen once
[28:01] more we never take it for granted amen
[28:03] every opportunity we have to come into
[28:06] the house of God Amen praise God so I
[28:08] greet you one more time and I thank you
[28:10] so much for your faith
[28:11] and tonight I have a thought here my
[28:14] title is please in Christ
[28:16] my inspiration Heroes of Faith
[28:19] amen that's my little thought here
[28:22] tonight amen praise God it might seem a
[28:25] bit odd but I just this is how it come
[28:27] to me praise God that uh we are Heroes
[28:30] of Faith here tonight and what we are
[28:32] fighting for or placing Christ praise
[28:35] God I feel like uh God is identifying
[28:37] him and by the word who we are praise
[28:39] God what we are fighting for what we are
[28:42] pressing to achieve amen isn't that
[28:45] right and when you look at the Bible you
[28:47] always it always Marvels me it always
[28:49] confounds me how praise God these men
[28:53] that are spoken of in Hebrews 11 praise
[28:56] God how they had so many different
[28:58] battles in every age and every situation
[29:02] they had their own trials to deal with
[29:04] praise God they were men of like
[29:06] passions they were men just like you and
[29:09] I an ordinary man praise God but in the
[29:12] hand of God God could do something with
[29:15] those ordinary man and make them
[29:18] extraordinary it wasn't the man it was a
[29:21] spirit of God working in the man and
[29:24] rotting amen his righteousness through
[29:25] them isn't that right subduing kingdoms
[29:28] amen praise God doing this doing that
[29:30] that was God working through them amen
[29:33] and it always inspires me and it amazes
[29:35] me that no matter how much we get down
[29:38] into this Modern Age and there's all the
[29:40] technology and everyone's empowered by
[29:42] this and that but still it Remains the
[29:45] Same man is still the same as he ever
[29:48] was back then and he still needs God's
[29:51] help he still needs God's counsel he
[29:54] still needs God's instruction he still
[29:56] needs God's wisdom he still needs God's
[29:59] Mighty hand oh hello matter of fact he's
[30:02] probably worse off now than he was then
[30:03] praise God because he's not so much
[30:05] Creature Comforts that they've got
[30:07] further away from what's genuine they've
[30:10] gotten further away from what's real and
[30:13] not have gotten so caught up in their
[30:15] Modern Age that they fail to find the
[30:18] time for their family for things that
[30:21] are important much less for God they can
[30:24] hardly find it anywhere but God promised
[30:26] to have another people in the land and
[30:29] under their messenger they will be the
[30:31] final voice to the final age and on that
[30:35] third step that pride is gonna have an
[30:37] individual walk with God in other words
[30:40] you are going to come into a condition
[30:41] where God will have somebody he could
[30:44] put his hand on he can have a witness on
[30:47] the earth and say Here's my spirit
[30:50] flowing freely God will have people on
[30:53] the Earth that he could just touch their
[30:55] hearts and say stop right there turn
[30:58] right turn left there's something I want
[31:01] you to do I don't have to explain
[31:03] everything but just one little not from
[31:05] God and Away you go because you'll have
[31:09] those virtues in you to respond to the
[31:12] spirit of God oh
[31:15] the spirit of God tonight is getting
[31:18] ready to move are you ready are you
[31:21] magnetized are you anointed oh
[31:24] Hallelujah are you ready tonight are you
[31:26] a sanctuary for true and living God to
[31:30] come down in his last day and make you a
[31:33] witness of his resurrection power the
[31:36] sick he's getting ready to be healed the
[31:38] dead is getting ready to be raised up
[31:40] the blood is getting ready to see the
[31:42] get ready to walk God will have
[31:45] a church without spot without wrinkle
[31:47] washing the blood of the Lamb a church
[31:50] with power in it a Church of Jesus
[31:52] Christ walking in it Hallelujah he
[31:55] promises and so shall it be my words
[31:58] shall not return for it but it shall
[32:01] accomplish the purpose and have sent
[32:04] Fortress to accomplish and if your were
[32:06] if God's word is in your heart tonight
[32:09] that it cannot fall to the crown the
[32:12] same God that spoke it is the same God I
[32:15] will bring in a pass somebody say Amen
[32:18] [Applause]
[32:19] [Music]
[32:24] oh Hallelujah
[32:30] oh so it intrigues me
[32:33] oh it's amazing
[32:35] how that man fell from the beginning
[32:37] isn't that right
[32:39] man was spoken in there
[32:41] we planted a garden the Bible said and
[32:43] he put a man in it
[32:45] to rule that Garden is that right
[32:48] but he fell into sin we don't even know
[32:50] a story and since that time
[32:53] man has been out of place
[32:56] he's an out of his position
[32:58] and that creates a certain kind of a
[33:00] Feeling

[46:07] that's what those Heroes of Faith
[46:09] believed
[46:11] that we all know hope
[46:13] there was a god out there somewhere who
[46:16] can answer our prayer
[46:18] I'll stay here until he come
[46:21] I'll pray until he come I believe until
[46:24] he come Elisha when he met the without
[46:27] the mantle was nobody else was just a
[46:30] man Elijah and Elijah was told to do it
[46:33] because Elijah will do nothing haphazard
[46:35] he don't talk all the timing and he
[46:37] don't do nothing unless God show him
[46:39] so it was God working on Elisha's life
[46:41] and he knew what he felt he knew the
[46:44] anointing had come upon him that's why
[46:46] he could talk the way he talked that's
[46:48] why he could walk the way he walked with
[46:51] which there was what kid in battle it
[46:53] was in kilgar together they were still
[46:56] journeying Elijah knew he hadn't got
[46:58] what he wanted yet and he was not
[47:01] satisfied until he got it so he stayed
[47:04] with that man of God because he never
[47:06] recognized that man have something he
[47:09] might have thought it was a mantle but
[47:11] he was after that something and we are
[47:13] after that something tonight we don't
[47:16] might know fully what it is we might
[47:18] can't explain it but we know there's
[47:20] something oh something about that
[47:22] Malachi for message something about that
[47:25] word something about our prophecy
[47:27] something about that anointing when that
[47:30] true anointing strikes a pride
[47:33] up into Glory
[47:35] as I promise lay in there in Scripture
[47:39] amen we believe it
[47:43] somehow we believe it
[47:49] pick oh you can pick anyone out of the
[47:52] Bible
[47:53] they believed it
[47:55] I always admire Mary
[47:57] such a young lady
[47:59] such a caution
[48:01] such
[48:02] wow such tenacity that's Admiral
[48:07] oh she told her parents this child is of
[48:10] the Holy Ghost that's what he told me I
[48:13] don't care what your interpretation is I
[48:15] don't care what you thought I did I know
[48:18] who spoke to me I know what's growing
[48:20] inside of me I know you're under
[48:22] persecution though you're trying
[48:25] Hallelujah trial you're fail to the
[48:27] devil and look like you're nobody but
[48:29] you know who you are you know who spoke
[48:31] to you you know why you're here tonight
[48:34] you're here to meet Jesus you didn't
[48:36] come here to meet me oh I live in arima
[48:39] you could have met me in arima praise
[48:40] God Amen you didn't come to meet me
[48:42] tonight you came to meet the Holy Ghost
[48:44] you came to meet Jesus Christ amen you
[48:47] came to me that same one that made the
[48:50] promise to you he's gonna fulfill it in
[48:53] his time and season oh do you believe it
[48:56] tonight
[48:57] Glory Hallelujah
[49:00] praise God image Heroes of feet
[49:04] and this is what we become when we begin
[49:06] to walk
[49:08] in this way
[49:09] you didn't set out to be a hero
[49:12] he just wanted something
[49:14] you just recognize something that the
[49:16] world didn't recognize
[49:18] you just became conscious of something
[49:20] you became aware of something that not
[49:23] everyone else was aware of God put
[49:26] something a little sliver Hallelujah of
[49:29] Hope in your soul hallelujah hallelujah
[49:32] and it wakes you up in the morning it
[49:34] makes you try again even though you're
[49:36] fail you try again oh because there's
[49:39] something inside of you that just won't
[49:41] give up that just won't believe the
[49:44] devil's lie oh that's that Angelic
[49:47] representation that you have when before
[49:50] the beginning hallelujah amen Michael
[49:52] and the angels fought praise God you
[49:55] resisted the devil's lie up there that's
[49:58] why I don't hear you can't judge you
[50:00] stuck just can't stomach his lies you
[50:02] can't believe it for too long because
[50:04] you know there's something more than
[50:05] that there's something more real than
[50:07] that the Holy Ghost for real there's a
[50:10] power more real there's a word
[50:12] hallelujah concerning your life
[50:15] Hallelujah
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:20] great faith
[50:22] that's what they had
[50:24] and Hebrews 11 Paul
[50:27] starts off talking about faith
[50:29] isn't that right
[50:31] he actually starts the scripture off
[50:33] talking about faith
[50:35] and then he shows by that same fate
[50:39] how these men of God
[50:42] stood
[50:43] stand the test yes in their time and in
[50:46] their day
[50:48] throughout scripture Paul is I mean I
[50:51] can't really read it all but he's he's
[50:52] coming through all down to the scripture
[50:54] by faith Eva by faith Enoch by fed Noah
[50:58] he's skipping uh uh chasms of time
[51:03] and yet in every dispensation by Fate
[51:06] by faith they come out by faith the
[51:09] Bible says Abel offer them God a more
[51:12] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[51:15] he obtained witness that he was
[51:17] righteous it was by a revelation that
[51:19] God put in Abel's heart oh hell is that
[51:22] and by pitch he offered a more excellent
[51:25] sacrifice oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[51:32] by faith Enoch walk with God and was
[51:36] translated that he should not see that
[51:39] isn't that right when you read the early
[51:42] part of the Book of Genesis it's like an
[51:44] obituary this one died
[51:48] this one died and this one died but when
[51:51] you come down to Enoch they say Enoch
[51:53] walk with God and was not because God
[51:56] took him oh hallelujah hallelujah all of
[51:59] a sudden God interrupted this one died
[52:02] this one died this Wonder to introduce a
[52:04] new thing pray someone who walked with
[52:07] God so close praise God that one day he
[52:10] was missing one day he was just gone and
[52:13] that's how the bride is gonna be here
[52:15] one day you're gonna be missing one day
[52:17] you're gonna be gone little bit of
[52:20] secret going away of this great pride
[52:22] being caught up to meet him in the air
[52:25] oh
[52:26] I want the power of this church Rises
[52:28] power of that church power that church
[52:30] it brings a Brethren and then up we go
[52:32] praise God Amen Hallelujah isn't that
[52:36] what the prophet said amen
[52:38] that's right
[52:40] see and
[52:41] Paul skips down through
[52:43] years of scripture talking about by
[52:47] faith Noah
[52:48] prophet Abraham and Sarah by faith Isaac
[52:51] by faith Jacob by faith Joseph when he
[52:54] died I made mention of his departing of
[52:56] the children of Israel giving
[52:58] Commandments concerning his bones he
[53:01] told them don't leave my bones down here
[53:03] in Egypt but take it with you when you

[53:09] bones hey praise God somewhere I want to

[53:55] personal revelation to the individual
[53:57] God was always going to fill you with
[53:59] the Holy Ghost
[54:00] long time ago he predestinated it but
[54:04] when he reveals it to you he pulls back
[54:07] the little sliver of understanding and
[54:10] of knowledge concerning your life and
[54:12] give you just enough Faith to keep
[54:14] holding on to keep pressing on to keep

[1:20:43] go over and get the Holy Spirit or not
[1:20:45] right you say is that a promise yes
[1:20:47] Peter said repent and be baptized every
[1:20:49] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:25:53] read that right amen oh man do you see
[1:25:56] it now wonderful amen so where the
[1:25:58] church is now he said this is my purpose
[1:26:00] of doing this the church is always
[1:26:02] trying to take somebody else's corner he
[1:26:04] said but don't do that you could never
[1:26:06] raise corn in ephraim's corner that's
[1:26:08] what you're talking about is it right he
[1:26:09] said if you are Manassas what you've got
[1:26:11] to take your place in Christ
[1:26:13] positionally take it he said oh it gets
[1:26:15] deep and Rich when we get in here how
[1:26:19] that God puts one in the church to speak
[1:26:21] with tongues and then another something
[1:26:23] else right he places them that way so
[1:26:26] it's not up to me it's not up to anybody
[1:26:29] else here is who God plays to do what
[1:26:30] praise God that's their position respect
[1:26:33] the brother love the sister they're in
[1:26:35] that position praise God doing what God
[1:26:37] called him to do amen
[1:26:39] amen we believe it's not right oh man I
[1:26:42] know you've been taught many times
[1:26:43] Hallelujah he said we all have to speak
[1:26:46] with tongues see how respect is so
[1:26:47] important amen as I get closer to this I
[1:26:50] realize respect so important see because
[1:26:53] you've got to respect each other's
[1:26:54] position God wants to place the church
[1:26:57] and it takes humility respect to
[1:27:00] reverence what God's decision is
[1:27:02] concerning brother so and so sister so
[1:27:04] and so whatever it's it's very very
[1:27:06] important praise God break because the
[1:27:08] disrespect that is to disrespect God's
[1:27:10] order of things
[1:27:12] oh and that's a great offense
[1:27:14] amen so let's take Heat tonight amen my
[1:27:17] God Amen said oh wonderful we all have
[1:27:20] to speak of tongues that's wrong no we
[1:27:22] don't all God to do it no we don't
[1:27:24] taking prophet and he said they all
[1:27:26] didn't do one thing each one was uh each
[1:27:29] each land was divided up by inspiration
[1:27:31] is that provided and divided
[1:27:33] amen each land each portion of land was
[1:27:36] divided and provided by inspiration each
[1:27:38] one he said I can take the scriptures
[1:27:40] show you how exactly how you put them in
[1:27:42] place and so on like that but we're
[1:27:43] going to get through that but he said
[1:27:44] you know he said how the two half tribes
[1:27:46] this way across River and so on and so
[1:27:47] forth like that and each Place how that
[1:27:49] each place was supposed to be he said no
[1:27:51] after you're in he said that don't mean

[1:28:23] end right so now we have to see and they
[1:28:25] don't mean you're free for more you have
[1:28:26] to fight for everyone so see Canaan
[1:28:28] didn't represent that great heaven but
[1:28:29] it's because it's war and troubles and
[1:28:31] killings and fightings and so forth see
[1:28:33] it's not this new millennium thing see
[1:28:34] it's still this fight but it's this
[1:28:36] represent this and that it must be a
[1:28:39] perfect walk amen praise God it's not in
[1:28:42] order to overcome amen or final quote
[1:28:45] I'm finished you could play something so
[1:28:47] please now right Ephraim don't want to
[1:28:49] stay one of them over here he said fine

[1:29:09] you're supposed to hurt cattle and so
[1:29:10] forth like that see showing each one
[1:29:12] take their place right Oh my he said so
[1:29:15] now it's not true he said he can't place
[1:29:17] a church Prophet said see the church is
[1:29:19] supposed to be predestinated onto the
