[58:20] after shift had snow from Le
[58:26] greetings to all here today today is a
[58:29] special day want to welcome Pastor Nigel
[58:31] alert and his church Miss
[58:33] Tabernacle to be here with us here this
[58:38] morning we consider it a blessing for
[58:40] you all to be here we warmly welcome you
[58:44] all of you for giving us this
[58:46] opportunity to
[58:50] serve I think that from don't have
[58:54] Fellowship don't talk to this one don't
[58:56] talk to that one don't talk to this one
[58:59] to come to this place and that that
[59:01] don't talk and don't Fellowship have
[59:03] nothing to do with the kingdom of
[59:04] God that have to do with mans and man
[59:07] boundaries and man issues and and and so
[59:10] on that have nothing to do with God's
[59:12] kingdom because the Bible said the
[59:14] kingdom is preached
[59:17] and Every Man Press into it so this
[59:21] kingdom is open Hallelujah and men do
[59:23] have a a heav more hell to put somebody
[59:26] in or put somebody out so there are many
[59:30] challenges
[59:32] ahead challenges as
[59:35] individuals as churches as a
[59:38] people we must become
[59:41] stronger in
[59:43] Fai and this FEI is not what we have for
[59:47] the last 50 years sorry to disappoint
[59:50] you is the Fate that works by
[59:52] love come on come on it's not just f but
[59:56] Fe that works by something it's
[59:58] interesting how the book of Jude small
[1:00:00] book is placed just before the Book of
[1:00:03] Revelation and in that book of Jude it
[1:00:06] said and of sum of
[1:00:08] compassion making a difference between
[1:00:10] brute beasts and those that are failing
[1:00:13] In the Flesh and struggling and so on
[1:00:14] make a difference and of some have
[1:00:17] compassion there a difference there so
[1:00:20] Jude the book of Jude is correctly
[1:00:22] placed in the
[1:00:23] Bible because it identified this Spirit
[1:00:26] of forgiveness and brotherly kindness
[1:00:29] and we know that faith is based upon
[1:00:31] forgiveness and if people don't cross
[1:00:33] you or do your wrong or whatever to you
[1:00:36] there's no opportunity for you to say I
[1:00:38] forgive you right or please forgive me
[1:00:41] and I don't believe the Christian walk
[1:00:43] God would allow you to walk this whole
[1:00:45] journey without saying I'm sorry without
[1:00:48] saying forgive me without saying I was
[1:00:51] wrong got people but Pride will keep you
[1:00:53] from doing that and you'll go to hell
[1:00:55] with The Pride not the
[1:00:58] Purgatory to hell because that is what
[1:01:01] it happened in heaven Pride overtake the
[1:01:03] the devil he wasn't the devil yet he was
[1:01:06] Lucifer a well handsome beautiful
[1:01:09] Archangel that's right but he got boots
[1:01:11] and he got kicked out because of that
[1:01:14] pride and God hates that that thing
[1:01:18] called Pride he resists the proud always
[1:01:21] but you always give grace to the humble
[1:01:23] so once you prepare to humble yourself
[1:01:25] go God is prepared to bless you and so
[1:01:28] like that so just before Revelation
[1:01:32] breaks that Holy Spirit slot there is
[1:01:34] brotherly kindness has to be
[1:01:37] displayed I remember long time M was s
[1:01:41] fighting when you when you meet a
[1:01:43] brother
[1:01:44] so his blade you know SW and that that
[1:01:49] was supposed to be in the message that
[1:01:50] not the message you know that's
[1:01:51] foolishness that just
[1:01:54] foolishness when Christ comes it makes a
[1:01:57] whole difference we want to see Jesus
[1:02:00] which one a train that Jesus or the
[1:02:02] Jesus in the Bible they have a Jes in
[1:02:05] the Bible that forgive the one of the
[1:02:07] well that tell that woman who was caught
[1:02:09] in the act go and sin no more that Jesus
[1:02:12] who watched a man who a crooked Wicked
[1:02:14] man said coming home to the house and
[1:02:16] that man just say I'm going to straight
[1:02:17] up everything you Jesus didn't tell him
[1:02:19] go and straight up everything you know
[1:02:20] he said come to your house tonight and
[1:02:22] that man just decided to get activated
[1:02:23] already they said I'm going to fix
[1:02:25] everything
[1:02:26] we want that same Jesus that could go to
[1:02:28] the other side and cast a thousand evils

[1:22:58] finished work we are walking in the
[1:23:00] pages of a book that is already written
[1:23:02] because you are the author and the
[1:23:04] finisher of our faith father so we thank
[1:23:06] you this morning may you take me out of
[1:23:08] the way and speak lip to a to your
[1:23:10] people in the precious name of Jesus
[1:23:12] Christ and the church say
[1:23:15] amen I want to read the scripture while
[1:23:17] you're standing so when we sit we could
[1:23:20] sit so reading uh Romans 8 God bless you
[1:23:24] you welcome I will keep my greetings for
[1:23:26] after this scripture Romans 8 reading
[1:23:30] from verse
[1:23:31] 14 for our scripture this
[1:23:36] morning familiar portion of
[1:23:38] scripture Romans 8 verse4 for as many as
[1:23:42] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:23:44] the sons of God for ye have not received
[1:23:47] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:23:49] you have received a spirit of adoption
[1:23:51] whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit
[1:23:54] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:23:56] that we are the children of God and if
[1:23:59] children then ears ears of God and Joint
[1:24:02] ears with Christ if so be that we suffer
[1:24:04] with him that we may be also glorified
[1:24:07] together for I reckon that the
[1:24:09] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:24:11] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:24:14] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:24:16] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:24:18] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:24:21] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:24:23] subject of ity not willingly but by
[1:24:26] reason of him who had subjected the same
[1:24:28] in Hope because the creature itself also
[1:24:31] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:24:33] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:24:36] the children of God for we know that the
[1:24:38] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[1:24:40] pain together until now and not only
[1:24:43] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:24:45] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:24:48] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:24:50] for the adoption to wit the Redemption
[1:24:53] of our body for we we are saved by hope
[1:24:55] but hope that is seen is not hope for
[1:24:57] what a man see it why do he yet hope for
[1:25:01] but if we hope for that we see not then
[1:25:03] do we with patience wait for it likewise
[1:25:06] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[1:25:09] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:25:11] as we ought but the spirit itself make
[1:25:13] it intercession for us with groanings
[1:25:15] which cannot be uttered and he that
[1:25:17] searched the hearts knoweth what is the
[1:25:20] mind of the spirit because he make it
[1:25:22] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:25:24] the will of God and we know that all
[1:25:26] things work together for good to them
[1:25:28] that love God to them who are the called
[1:25:30] according to his purpose for whom he did
[1:25:33] Forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:25:36] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:25:38] we might be the firstborn among many
[1:25:39] Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:25:41] predestinate them he also called and
[1:25:44] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:25:46] and whom he justified them he also
[1:25:48] glorified may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:25:50] the reading of his word you may be
[1:25:51] seated in the house of the Lord this
[1:25:53] morning
[1:25:55] are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:25:56] Lord the psalmist David said I was glad
[1:25:59] when they said unto me let us go into
[1:26:01] the house of the Lord and we are so
[1:26:02] delighted this morning to be here and to
[1:26:05] be together in fellowship and we know
[1:26:06] Satan is mad Satan doesn't like this if
[1:26:10] the devil could keep us separate he has
[1:26:12] already won the battle but the moment we
[1:26:14] come together then something begins to
[1:26:15] move the Bible said if two shall agree
[1:26:18] touching anything you could have
[1:26:19] whatever you ask for and one will put a
[1:26:22] th to flight two will put with 10,000
[1:26:24] the flight that's in mathematics you
[1:26:26] call it a geometric progression if you
[1:26:28] add three to the equation it's 100,000
[1:26:30] you add four to the equation it's a
[1:26:31] million so with what's happening here
[1:26:33] this morning all the Devils on this
[1:26:35] island are already finished because
[1:26:37] there's more for us than against us and
[1:26:39] if the true church could ever work
[1:26:41] together in harmony then the devil has
[1:26:42] no room so I'm excited this morning cuz
[1:26:45] I'm identified with Believers of like
[1:26:47] Precious faith we are not now seeing
[1:26:49] each other we saw each other a long time
[1:26:52] ago before there was a moon before there
[1:26:54] was a star before there was a molecule
[1:26:56] before there was rent before there was
[1:26:58] mortgage before there was back pain
[1:27:00] before there was old age before there
[1:27:02] was governments and political turmoil we
[1:27:04] were there before the foundation of the
[1:27:06] world and we were represented Hallelujah
[1:27:09] when Lucifer was kicked out we were
[1:27:11] there we were represented there we were
[1:27:13] part of the operation that threw the
[1:27:15] devil out of heaven and created oh come
[1:27:18] on now and we are here on the earth
[1:27:20] doing the same thing we did before this
[1:27:22] is not new to us we just forgot it but
[1:27:25] the word of God to Elijah the prophet
[1:27:27] brought back memory to us and broke the
[1:27:30] spiritual Amnesia so we are walking with
[1:27:32] faith and confidence and assurance that
[1:27:35] we are children of the most high and
[1:27:37] this message is very much alive this
[1:27:40] message is not washed up this message is
[1:27:42] not defeated we are only just getting
[1:27:44] started oh you don't hear me this
[1:27:46] morning we are just warming up we are
[1:27:50] just getting started all the years since
[1:27:52] the prophet left was a warm up was a
[1:27:54] warm up for you to be here we were not
[1:27:57] here in the 60s we were not here in the
[1:27:58] 70s but here we are in
[1:28:01] 2025 when the lead of hell is uncovered
[1:28:04] demon powers over the Earth Satan thinks
[1:28:07] he has the world in a choke hoold but
[1:28:09] here you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:11] waiting for the power of God to strike
[1:28:13] home and the moment the power of God
[1:28:15] strikes home it's on the inside working
[1:28:18] on the outside your sickness has to
[1:28:21] subject itself to the power of God
[1:28:23] that's in you your old age has to
[1:28:25] subject itself to the power of God in
[1:28:28] you your bald head have to subject you
[1:28:30] don't hear me this
[1:28:33] morning you may be seated I'm just
[1:28:36] testing the temperature Hallelujah just
[1:28:39] making sure because the Bible said he
[1:28:41] rather you hot or you're cold but if you
[1:28:43] lukew he spew you out of his mouth I'm
[1:28:45] looking for a people who knows that he's
[1:28:47] unveiled I'm looking for people who are
[1:28:49] radical in their belief that this gospel
[1:28:52] is just as real as it was on the day of
[1:28:55] Pentecost I'm radical about the
[1:28:57] sovereignty of God to bring people
[1:29:00] together from this place from that place
[1:29:02] and call them from prostitution from
[1:29:04] drinking from porn from pornography from
[1:29:07] fornication from the Baptist Church from
[1:29:10] the Methodist Church from The Message
[1:29:11] Church it didn't matter where you come
[1:29:13] from but we are caught up in the realm
[1:29:15] of God because there's one Lord One
[1:29:18] Faith one baptism one hope of our
[1:29:21] calling one destination one enemy and
[1:29:24] you know what we already have the
[1:29:26] victory we already have the victory we
[1:29:29] are just showing the devil that we have
[1:29:31] the victory we are walking in our
[1:29:33] Authority walking in our position I
[1:29:35] don't know how long this service is
[1:29:37] going to be but I know by the time this
[1:29:39] service is over sickness has got to go
[1:29:42] depression has got to go being defeated
[1:29:45] has got to go can the church say Amen
[1:29:48] you may be
[1:29:50] seated I'm trying to get to the
[1:29:52] greetings you have to forgive me
[1:29:55] but we need people who are reckless in
[1:29:56] faith that's the prophet I didn't say
[1:29:59] that take don't have a problem with me
[1:30:01] the pro the BR said we need a reckless
[1:30:03] Faith he said Faith got here on its
[1:30:06] chest Hallelujah we have become too
[1:30:09] comfortable in the message we got to go
[1:30:11] take the war to the enemy we got to take
[1:30:14] back from the enemy what the enemy stole
[1:30:17] from us if you lost your joy take it
[1:30:19] back you lost your Victory take it back
[1:30:21] you lost your worship take it back you
[1:30:23] lost your shout take it back you lost
[1:30:25] the dance in your
[1:30:27] step take it back maybe you didn't dance
[1:30:31] for a long time take it back maybe you
[1:30:33] didn't lift your hand for a long time
[1:30:34] take it back brother brandham said when
[1:30:37] you lift your hands you defy the law of
[1:30:39] gravity you saw that you are creature
[1:30:47] from but the N Gil we're about
[1:30:51] 60% testing the temperature we what we
[1:30:53] got to get up we got to get to 100% when
[1:30:56] we get to 100% then then then then we
[1:30:58] can start to preach Hallelujah the devil
[1:31:01] try to tell you belong to him and your
[1:31:03] mistake is going to keep you back and
[1:31:04] you fell here and you did this I don't
[1:31:07] care about it that's a sea of
[1:31:09] forgetfulness when God look through the
[1:31:11] blood he doesn't see your mistakes
[1:31:13] because the blood is speaking for you
[1:31:15] you have a lawyer this morning and your
[1:31:17] lawyer is also your judge your judge is

[1:32:09] short quick message shake the whole
[1:32:11] nation you got to see yourself in the
[1:32:13] word somewhere there are different
[1:32:15] measures different gifts different
[1:32:17] callings you know but we all have a part
[1:32:19] of the body we all have a role to play
[1:32:21] we all have a part to play and when
[1:32:23] every brother finds his place then the
[1:32:25] enemy can't move Hallelujah can the
[1:32:28] church say Amen so I greet you this
[1:32:30] morning in the precious name of Jesus

[1:32:50] him contending for the faith that was
[1:32:51] delivered to the Saints restored by
[1:32:53] Malachi k for who see the land ahead and

[1:32:59] that's how we feel there remain it much
[1:33:00] more land to be taken and as our sister

[1:33:43] our song leader this

[1:33:58] thank you so much for all the
[1:34:00] specials
[1:34:02] amen and my friend brother Michael who's
[1:34:06] singing that song and that song for the
[1:34:08] last few days has been my song I want to
[1:34:11] go where you want me to go Lord I don't
[1:34:14] want to go where I want to go but I want
[1:34:17] to go where you want me to go because
[1:34:20] wherever God wants me to go I'm better
[1:34:22] there than anywhere else
[1:34:24] if all of hell is there but that's where
[1:34:26] God wants me then all of hell has to be
[1:34:28] subject to my feet because I'm the
[1:34:31] safest wherever God wants me to go I
[1:34:33] don't care what the enemy looks like I
[1:34:35] don't care what the situation looks like
[1:34:36] I don't care what's happening in your
[1:34:38] job in your marriage in your home in
[1:34:40] your finances if God wants you there
[1:34:42] then he's there with you the psalmist
[1:34:44] David said if I make my bed in hell he
[1:34:46] is there with me he understood the
[1:34:49] relationship he had with God can the
[1:34:51] Church Say Amen
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:59] so I have a little title this morning by
[1:35:01] the grace of God and we are just looking
[1:35:03] to Fellowship around the word of God
[1:35:06] nothing that will be said is outside of
[1:35:09] the message of the hour I have no new
[1:35:11] revelation I'm not a prophet I'm just a
[1:35:14] brother with a revelation who's been
[1:35:17] through some stuff and I could testify
[1:35:19] it's the grace of God for me and if it's
[1:35:21] a grace of God for me and I know it for
[1:35:22] myself I could say it's a Grace of God
[1:35:23] for you and we are all here trophies of
[1:35:26] the grace of God there's nothing we have
[1:35:28] ever done could ever do that could
[1:35:30] warrant or qualify us for what God has
[1:35:32] called us for but the Bible said who he
[1:35:34] forew he called past tense who he called
[1:35:36] he justified past tense who he justified
[1:35:39] he has already glorified so in God's
[1:35:41] mind you already have the Holy Ghost you
[1:35:43] already adopted he's seeing a finished
[1:35:45] work you are walking through the process
[1:35:47] of it but in God's economy he knows the
[1:35:49] devil is already defeated you are on top
[1:35:51] of your home you in the right position
[1:35:53] Oh Come come on
[1:35:55] now amen so for a title this morning the
[1:36:00] restoration of divine
[1:36:02] order Divine position and divine
[1:36:07] power for a little thought this morning
[1:36:09] the restoration of divine
[1:36:12] order Divine
[1:36:14] position and divine
[1:36:19] power God is a god of order but the
[1:36:22] random taught us that
[1:36:24] where the ROM he says there's nothing
[1:36:26] halfhazard with God God wake up and
[1:36:29] decide to do something this morning no
[1:36:30] he's a God who plans he's a God who
[1:36:33] anticipates he's a God who puts things
[1:36:35] in place and but the mam said setting in
[1:36:37] order for the coming of the Lord so you
[1:36:38] are not here by chance there's no chance
[1:36:41] with God this service we having today
[1:36:43] God already saw this thousands and
[1:36:45] thousands and thousands and before
[1:36:46] eternity all of that this already
[1:36:48] happened in God's plan for his purpose
[1:36:50] we may not seen all of it only when you
[1:36:52] look back you can see what on ve but God
[1:36:54] is a god of
[1:36:55] order and when God in Genesis and
[1:36:58] brother brandom taught us there are two
[1:36:59] books that the devil
[1:37:00] hates Genesis and Revelation because
[1:37:04] Genesis speaks of the beginning and
[1:37:05] Revelation speaks of his
[1:37:07] ending and we know that God is a god of
[1:37:09] order so in the Gen Book of Genesis he
[1:37:12] on the first day second day Third Day
[1:37:14] fourth day God is putting things in
[1:37:15] place everything is in order everything
[1:37:17] is in its position everything is there
[1:37:20] by the power of God can the Church Say
[1:37:23] Amen
[1:37:24] the picture at that time is a picture of
[1:37:26] divine order Divine position and divine
[1:37:30] power because God spoke it and it came
[1:37:32] to be he put the sun where he wanted it
[1:37:34] he put the moons where he wanted it he
[1:37:36] put the Earth exactly in place he put
[1:37:38] the stars in its place he put the
[1:37:39] animals in their order everything in
[1:37:41] place and then he put man there a spirit
[1:37:43] man and the church say amen and then he
[1:37:47] took a flesh man and put that Spirit man
[1:37:49] inside the flesh man we know this can
[1:37:50] the church say amen and man was in
[1:37:54] position he was in order he had power
[1:37:58] because he was in his position that's
[1:38:00] that's good your power is tied to your
[1:38:02] position your Authority is tied to your
[1:38:05] position oh you don't hear me this
[1:38:07] morning Hallelujah brother the brandom
[1:38:09] said perfect faith is based on your
[1:38:11] position it's a difference if you are in
[1:38:13] your home on your property and you're in
[1:38:15] somebody else's home what you allow to
[1:38:17] do or can do is different but when you
[1:38:19] are in your house you are in your
[1:38:20] position you have certain rights because
[1:38:23] it's your
[1:38:26] your rights are limited when you are in
[1:38:28] somebody else's
[1:38:31] house you see what's happening in the
[1:38:33] world America revoking visas doing this
[1:38:35] they're basically saying this
[1:38:37] jurisdiction has certain things
[1:38:39] happening here and because it's their
[1:38:41] jurisdiction they have the right to
[1:38:43] accept they have the right to reject
[1:38:44] they have the right to Grant visas they
[1:38:46] have the right to shut down visas
[1:38:47] immediately because it's their
[1:38:49] jurisdiction but if you are born there
[1:38:51] they can't throw you out
[1:38:54] all the countries trying to go to
[1:38:55] America need permission to go there
[1:38:57] because it's not theirs they come from
[1:38:59] somewhere else that's right everybody
[1:39:01] with me this morning but when you were
[1:39:03] on your land nobody could throw you out
[1:39:05] of
[1:39:06] Trinidad nobody could throw you out of
[1:39:08] Trinidad because you're born here you
[1:39:11] grow up here your pitch you you build s
[1:39:14] Castle you do this is
[1:39:16] yours the president of the United States
[1:39:18] cannot chew you out of Trinidad because
[1:39:20] this is yours and when you are son of
[1:39:23] God
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:27] no devil can come and throw you off of
[1:39:29] the oh you
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:34] don't and when you are in the
[1:39:36] jurisdiction that belongs to you there's
[1:39:38] an authority that comes with that
[1:39:40] jurisdiction you may be
[1:39:42] seated and and just to understand the
[1:39:45] context because we're talking about
[1:39:46] divine order there's a order there's a
[1:39:48] way that God operates and when we order
[1:39:50] in that way when we operate in that way
[1:39:52] something happens there are positions
[1:39:54] that you're supposed to be in you can't
[1:39:55] be where you want to go your blessing
[1:39:57] when you go to a bar you really not in
[1:39:59] your
[1:40:04] position remember brother Bron give the
[1:40:06] illustration of the young lady who went
[1:40:07] into the bar and thing and and she was
[1:40:09] living at some when she went she she was
[1:40:10] off of her ground but when you on your
[1:40:12] ground that's why the Bible say don't
[1:40:14] forsake the assembling of yourselves
[1:40:16] together because when they come together
[1:40:17] in a kind of atmosphere like this it
[1:40:19] reminds you that you're a creature of
[1:40:21] heavenly places
[1:40:23] you don't hear me this
[1:40:25] morning this is a reminder that we were
[1:40:28] doing the same thing before the
[1:40:29] foundation of the world listen on the
[1:40:31] others oh come on now it's only
[1:40:32] worshiping Glory blessing honor might
[1:40:36] power Dominion holy holy that's the
[1:40:39] envirment to
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:47] know you may be seated but when you on
[1:40:50] your
[1:40:51] jurisdiction and even and and just to
[1:40:54] understand the power of jurisdiction and
[1:40:56] the power of position if you if if if an
[1:40:58] American is in a foreign country and
[1:41:00] they're under pressure of brother punch
[1:41:02] they could be anywhere in the world but
[1:41:04] they want to know where the US Embassy
[1:41:06] is because if it could just make it to
[1:41:08] the US Embassy because the ground that
[1:41:10] the US Embassy covers belongs to the
[1:41:12] United States they will defend that they
[1:41:15] will send planes for that they will send
[1:41:16] soldiers for that because that little
[1:41:18] piece of ground is their it could be a
[1:41:20] small spot but the moment you cross the
[1:41:22] line into that area you know you're safe
[1:41:24] you could watch the people who chasing
[1:41:26] you and look at them and smile because
[1:41:28] you know you cross this one line oh you
[1:41:30] don't hear me this morning Hallelujah So
[1:41:33] Young Brother young sister if you've
[1:41:35] been living in the world I want to
[1:41:36] invite you to cross the line this
[1:41:38] morning and come back on your territory
[1:41:40] because when you're in your
[1:41:42] territory the Holy Ghost is there
[1:41:44] blessings is there healing is there the
[1:41:47] Deliverance of your family that's why
[1:41:49] they had to leave Egypt and get to the
[1:41:51] promised land because the blessing was
[1:41:52] not in EG Egypt the blessing was in the
[1:41:54] promised
[1:42:00] land
[1:42:04] huah and since the prophet left we have
[1:42:06] been living by the evidence of the new
[1:42:08] land so we know it's a good land we know
[1:42:11] it's flowing with milk and honey but I
[1:42:12] don't I don't want to keep looking at
[1:42:14] the land I have permission I have access
[1:42:16] because only Sons as many as are led by
[1:42:18] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:42:20] God not everybody could walk into that
[1:42:22] land but you me us we have permission
[1:42:26] because we are Of The Bloodline come on
[1:42:28] now somebody help me this morning they
[1:42:31] can't reject me my passport says
[1:42:33] Promised Land my Visa says Promised Land
[1:42:36] the Philistine know I'm from the
[1:42:38] promised
[1:42:39] land can the Church Say
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:49] Amen hallu
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:42:54] so when man fell brother Powell he fell
[1:42:57] out of order out
[1:43:01] of now it changes the reason why you can
[1:43:04] see the prophet could preach conduct
[1:43:06] order and
[1:43:08] Doctrine because conduct is about
[1:43:10] Behavior order is about God's order and
[1:43:12] Doctrine is the foundation of our
[1:43:15] faith because when man fell we fell out
[1:43:18] of
[1:43:19] order the trees knew it the animals knew
[1:43:22] it that's why I read this scripture the
[1:43:24] whole of creation groaning since the
[1:43:26] fall of Adam because they knew the son
[1:43:28] fell out of
[1:43:33] order you know when you are in order and
[1:43:36] when you're not in order you know when
[1:43:39] your life is in order and when your life
[1:43:41] is not in order you know when your
[1:43:43] prayer life is in order and when your
[1:43:45] prayer life is out of order you know
[1:43:47] when your marriage is in order and when
[1:43:48] your marriage is out of order you know
[1:43:50] when your worship is in order and your
[1:43:52] worship is out order you know as a
[1:43:54] priest in your home when you could bring
[1:43:56] spiritual sacrifices that God would
[1:43:58] accept because it's in order and you
[1:44:00] know when you're not in
[1:44:02] order anybody with
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:07] [Applause]
[1:44:08] me I'm just encouraging you this morning
[1:44:12] of what you already know so man fell out
[1:44:14] of order and he also fell out of
[1:44:18] position because God had to come and say
[1:44:20] now Adam Adam where are you where
[1:44:26] adou this is God we talking about the
[1:44:28] omniscient omnipresent omnipotent God
[1:44:32] asking Adam where are
[1:44:35] you he's not asking for a GPS location
[1:44:38] he's not saying send me a WhatsApp
[1:44:40] location of where you
[1:44:41] at send me a location
[1:44:44] pin that wasn't the question he say Adam
[1:44:46] you're out of
[1:44:48] order Adam you're out of
[1:44:51] position father you're supposed to be
[1:44:53] priest of your home where are
[1:45:01] you God knew where he was geographically
[1:45:03] he's walking in the garden but he knows
[1:45:06] this man is
[1:45:09] broken sister broken because you're not
[1:45:12] in order not in the position God left
[1:45:15] him in order God left him in position
[1:45:17] God left him in power and when he came
[1:45:19] back around he said Adam you're not
[1:45:22] where I left you when I spoke to you
[1:45:25] yesterday there was a sincerity in your
[1:45:26] soul there was a fervent desire to
[1:45:29] please God there was something about
[1:45:30] your walk and your talk that can
[1:45:31] identify looking that you are looking
[1:45:33] for you and I'm not seeing that anymore
[1:45:35] where are
[1:45:37] you and from that time has been a
[1:45:39] journey for a restoration of divine
[1:45:43] order Divine
[1:45:46] position to release the divine power
[1:45:49] because God is not going to release
[1:45:51] power unless you're in your position
[1:45:54] God not releasing power with you halfway
[1:45:56] in the world one foot in the world
[1:45:58] you're dressing like in the message but
[1:45:59] one foot in the world you're singing
[1:46:01] songs like in messy but one foot in the
[1:46:03] world there has to be the right order
[1:46:05] and the right position so it's not good
[1:46:07] enough to just be in church you could be
[1:46:08] in position in church but your life out
[1:46:10] of order you don't hear me this morning
[1:46:12] divine order Divine position to release
[1:46:16] divine
[1:46:19] power it's not good enough to believe
[1:46:22] the message that devil
[1:46:23] believes and trembles some of us don't
[1:46:26] even
[1:46:31] trembling God wants us in divine order
[1:46:35] in our divine position and position is
[1:46:38] multi-purpose you're supposed to be at
[1:46:40] your post of Duty but you have a
[1:46:42] position in your home husbands have a
[1:46:44] position wives have a position deacons
[1:46:46] have a position they have a position on
[1:46:48] your job everything there's a right
[1:46:49] position are you in your position
[1:46:52] because if you ask God for power he can
[1:46:54] only pour out power if you're in your
[1:46:56] position and if in your right order when
[1:46:59] you're out of your position it hinders
[1:47:01] the
[1:47:02] flow of the blessing of God can the
[1:47:05] church say
[1:47:07] Amen position is important you can do
[1:47:10] what you want and Trinidad is unique you
[1:47:13] know Trinidad is
[1:47:14] special having traveled to different
[1:47:16] countries Trinidad is really unique this
[1:47:17] small little island we very own way very
[1:47:20] independent I say if they could sign up
[1:47:23] for the Oscars and for the Grammys and
[1:47:24] think we win all the awards because we
[1:47:26] could act we could we could do things a
[1:47:28] way Trinidad is special we blessed
[1:47:29] that's wonderful but there God has his
[1:47:32] way you can't serve God the way you want
[1:47:34] to serve him you have to serve God the
[1:47:36] way he wants to be
[1:47:40] served he said present your bodies a
[1:47:42] Living Sacrifice that is your reasonable
[1:47:44] service it has to be acceptable to God
[1:47:47] not acceptable to the
[1:47:49] church many of us live and we pleasing
[1:47:52] one another and looking all right but is
[1:47:53] does God
[1:47:56] accept because the acceptance is in
[1:48:02] God my concern is not if you please with
[1:48:05] the message
[1:48:06] today I have just one concern if the
[1:48:09] Lord
[1:48:10] please because if the Lord accept it
[1:48:12] that's all I have to
[1:48:14] do as a husband as a father as a
[1:48:17] minister as a deacon whatever you are
[1:48:19] there God accepting it can the Church
[1:48:22] Say Amen
[1:48:24] so there's a blessing in your
[1:48:27] position Jesus Will him T in
[1:48:30] Jerusalem until he be endured for power
[1:48:32] from high well I feeling to go
[1:48:34] Galilee I feel in led to go to Galilee
[1:48:38] yes because I had an experience in
[1:48:40] Galilee would say t in
[1:48:45] Jerusalem I going on to Bethlehem
[1:48:47] because the last time the Lord spoke to
[1:48:48] me was in Bethlehem T in
[1:48:51] Jerusalem I hear a voice last night and
[1:48:54] just whisper
[1:48:55] Bethlehem T in
[1:48:58] Jerusalem the blessing was in a
[1:49:01] position until you receive
[1:49:10] power if everybody had their own
[1:49:13] interpretation of that and went way they
[1:49:14] want the scripture wouldn't read the way
[1:49:16] it
[1:49:17] does but you had to be in the right
[1:49:19] thing at the right place at the right
[1:49:22] time because God had a vision of what he
[1:49:24] wanted to be able to achieve and God has
[1:49:27] a provided place and that place not a
[1:49:29] physical location that place is in
[1:49:31] Christ Hallelujah no church could claim
[1:49:33] to have it and any church that say this
[1:49:34] is it something wrong I want to tell you
[1:49:37] this is not it
[1:49:40] here het Tabernacle is not a mispa
[1:49:43] tabernacle there's no physical
[1:49:44] Tabernacle are you in Christ because
[1:49:47] that's God provided
[1:49:49] place can the Church Say Amen
[1:49:55] God honors his word god honors his order
[1:50:00] God honors his position can the church
[1:50:03] say
[1:50:06] amen and even faith faith has a position
[1:50:09] because Bram teaches about mental
[1:50:11] faith and Faith so Faith could be in
[1:50:14] your mind that's the position of Faith
[1:50:15] but when Faith moves from here to hear
[1:50:17] is a
[1:50:18] different so when that man came to he
[1:50:20] prayed
[1:50:21] for blind man and then he came back to
[1:50:25] get prayed for again he said you I
[1:50:26] already prayed for you're healed just
[1:50:28] say by Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm
[1:50:30] Healed because his fate was here but he
[1:50:32] keep saying extra extra Read All About
[1:50:34] It by Stripes I'm heal extra extra read
[1:50:36] until one day the Fate changed
[1:50:39] position and it was no longer a mental
[1:50:41] faith it became a faith in his soul and
[1:50:43] all of a sudden he his eyes popped open
[1:50:46] can the church say Amen Oh
[1:50:51] Glory so Adam went from strength and
[1:50:54] power order into
[1:50:58] defeat and his position
[1:51:01] changed what he had enjoyed before
[1:51:03] unbroken Fellowship eternal life and
[1:51:06] Authority was now gone his position was
[1:51:09] protected under God's word and from his
[1:51:12] position flowed the power to rule the
[1:51:15] power of dominion tied to his position
[1:51:18] if you put someone on a certain seat no
[1:51:20] matter if you like them or not if they
[1:51:22] in the position the position comes with
[1:51:24] certain things so if you become the
[1:51:26] Prime Minister the Prime Minister has
[1:51:28] certain Authority whether you like him
[1:51:29] or not like her or not it doesn't matter
[1:51:32] the position comes with power the
[1:51:34] position comes with authority can the
[1:51:36] church say Amen Adam in his position was
[1:51:39] an amateur God Adam in his position
[1:51:42] could name Adam in his position had
[1:51:44] Dominion can the church say amen and if
[1:51:46] we are out of opposition now and we see
[1:51:48] what we're able to do imagine when you
[1:51:50] get into your opposition because when
[1:51:51] you get into your opposition it comes
[1:51:53] with authority it comes authority over
[1:51:55] your home authority over your life
[1:51:57] authority over your family can the
[1:51:58] church say Amen authority over your
[1:52:00] sickness and when that time come but the
[1:52:02] BAM said you w't even lay hands on the
[1:52:04] sick you will command the Devils to
[1:52:06] leave because you're in your position
[1:52:08] and I believe the bride is going to get
[1:52:10] into her position can the church say
[1:52:12] amen
[1:52:14] glory there's something about the
[1:52:16] position you remember the story of
[1:52:17] Aaron's rod aon's rod was dead for years
[1:52:20] but overnight in the right position
[1:52:23] in the presence of God it brought forth
[1:52:24] buds it Blossom and it brought forth
[1:52:27] fruit because it was in the right place
[1:52:29] friends you got to be in the right place
[1:52:31] you got to be in the right position you
[1:52:32] got to be in word and spirit together
[1:52:34] you got to be in the right atmosphere
[1:52:36] because the word seed is in you and you
[1:52:38] got to water that seed can the church
[1:52:40] say Amen bring that seed into the right
[1:52:42] environment what did Brother brandom say
[1:52:44] they take a chicken egg and put it under
[1:52:47] a dog once the environment is there the
[1:52:49] chicken would hatch didn't he teach us
[1:52:51] that because it's in the right position
[1:52:53] take any Son of God and put him through
[1:52:55] a test he can stand the test because
[1:52:58] he's a Son of God can the church say
[1:53:00] Amen you know sometimes you may be
[1:53:02] seated we talking about position tied to
[1:53:03] power but you know sometime position is
[1:53:05] also tied to
[1:53:10] trials God could send you into a
[1:53:12] position to test you you might say but
[1:53:14] if you only know the test I go through
[1:53:16] right now that the right
[1:53:17] position because out of that trial out
[1:53:19] of that test going to come forth
[1:53:21] something wonderful can the church say
[1:53:23] Amen but in your position you stand in
[1:53:25] your position having done all to stand
[1:53:28] stand can the church say Amen Give the
[1:53:30] Lord a shout of
[1:53:32] Praise oh what are you saying preacher
[1:53:35] God doesn't want to replace you God is
[1:53:37] not in the replacement business God is
[1:53:39] in the restoration business you are
[1:53:42] predestinated for this thing you are
[1:53:44] going to overcome you are going to make
[1:53:46] the Rapture you are going to make the
[1:53:47] breading supper you are going to make it
[1:53:50] Hallelujah because you are not even the
[1:53:51] believer the word seed in you that's a
[1:53:54] Believer
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:06] Hallelujah
[1:54:07] glory
[1:54:09] glory in position in Christ brother B
[1:54:12] said God trying to place his church in
[1:54:14] position to manifest himself getting one
[1:54:17] of he could walk through like this so
[1:54:19] God is actually waiting for the bride to
[1:54:21] get into position
[1:54:23] and the whole Devil's job is to keep you
[1:54:24] out of your position if he can keep you
[1:54:26] a church member he
[1:54:27] good but when you get into bride
[1:54:30] position then the devil is finished if
[1:54:32] your position could be one of staying in
[1:54:34] arts and grudges the devil is good but
[1:54:36] if your position is brotherly
[1:54:37] kindness if your position is forgiveness
[1:54:40] if your position is Unity if your
[1:54:42] position is love then the devil is
[1:54:44] finished can the church say Amen brother
[1:54:47] Bram said get another one over here and
[1:54:50] place him I can place him adoption
[1:54:51] placing man festing take him out there
[1:54:53] and put a ceremony on him Hallelujah so
[1:54:56] God is looking to place Sons and
[1:54:58] Daughters into position because in your
[1:55:00] position comes your Authority can the
[1:55:02] church say
[1:55:04] Amen So Adam fell from his position as a
[1:55:07] son to a fallen state but God promised
[1:55:10] to restore and he gave the promise that
[1:55:13] the seed of the woman would come to
[1:55:15] crush the head of that serpent can the
[1:55:17] church say amen and Jesus as a second
[1:55:19] Adam came to win back everything that
[1:55:21] that first Adam lost
[1:55:23] where the first Adam failed to hold his
[1:55:25] position Jesus held his position of
[1:55:27] obedience unto death to the cross and
[1:55:29] through Christ our position before God
[1:55:32] is now restored can the church say Amen
[1:55:35] what the first Adam lost the second Adam
[1:55:37] restored on the cross Jesus regained the
[1:55:40] title de to the earth and the church
[1:55:42] amen hallelujah he endured it he fought
[1:55:45] for the position Hallelujah can the
[1:55:48] church say amen and in the resurrection
[1:55:50] he demonstrated absolute Dominion he
[1:55:53] said destroy this Temple and in three
[1:55:55] days I'll raise it back up again he knew
[1:55:58] who he was death couldn't even hold him
[1:56:01] and death will not be able to hold you
[1:56:02] you will look death in the face just
[1:56:04] like
[1:56:07] Paul now as many as receive him let them
[1:56:10] give you power we are raised back to our
[1:56:12] position never before this time was the
[1:56:15] position as accessible as it is now
[1:56:17] because brother brandham showed that
[1:56:19] Sons can get back into position
[1:56:23] let there be a squirrel sun in position
[1:56:25] sun come out and shine sun in position
[1:56:28] little fish here give you back your life

[1:56:34] God in position as a wave sheath to us
[1:56:36] that restored sunship is now against
[1:56:39] accessible to the wave sheath can the
[1:56:41] church say
[1:56:43] amen and brother Brandon was just a
[1:56:45] first example in our day to show that
[1:56:47] more sons are coming and I believe this
[1:56:50] morning I'm looking at some Sons I'm
[1:56:52] looking at some daughters they are about
[1:56:54] to get into their position and the
[1:56:56] moment you step into your

[1:57:17] go to the ceremony all the powers of the
[1:57:19] office are pass to
[1:57:21] him

[1:57:26] matter if he feeling sick it doesn't

[1:58:06] explain I am Jesus the moment he step on
[1:58:08] the ground Legion knew who he was can
[1:58:11] the church say he didn't need no
[1:58:12] introduction he didn't need no
[1:58:14] announcement yeah he yeah he no the
[1:58:16] moment he dropped there The Authority
[1:58:18] was all over him the light was flowing

[1:59:58] say there's a son on the earth can the
[2:00:00] church say Amen that was the first time
[2:00:02] since the Lord Jesus Christ walked that
[2:00:04] there was a sun showing this kind of
[2:00:05] power Hallelujah Satan taught when Jesus
[2:00:08] died I was it to
[2:00:10] know if Satan knew what would have
[2:00:12] happened when Jesus died he would have
[2:00:13] tried to keep him long long long and
[2:00:15] keep him there but when Jesus died it
[2:00:16] allowed the power to be multiplied and
[2:00:19] Peter cusb Peter fisherman Peter Peter
[2:00:22] who had his ups and down with a Brute
[2:00:24] Force fate Peter could now walk by the
[2:00:26] gate called beautiful because he was in
[2:00:28] the upper room he was in the right place
[2:00:29] and Peter had an experience with God and
[2:00:31] when he had that experience with God
[2:00:33] Peter didn't even really understand how
[2:00:35] much power was coming with the
[2:00:37] position Hallelujah and when he stood
[2:00:40] there he say silver and gold I don't
[2:00:41] have I don't have links I don't have
[2:00:42] cash I don't have nothing but such as I
[2:00:45] have I have something I give it to
[2:00:48] you can the church say Amen Peter was
[2:00:51] walking in his position he was living in
[2:00:53] order can the church say amen and that's

[2:01:17] church say amenallah
[2:01:21] hallah God longing for someone to come
[2:01:25] into
[2:01:27] position huj the power of position
[2:01:31] Church don't stay
[2:01:36] home the Bible say forsake not the
[2:01:38] assembling of yourselves together
[2:01:40] there's no way you can take that out the
[2:01:45] Bible as the manner of
[2:01:50] some that the manner of some but the
[2:01:53] Bible say forsake not the assembling
[2:01:56] because when they assemble there's
[2:01:57] something that happens like The Upper
[2:01:59] Room wasn't one over there one over
[2:02:00] there no they were in one place on one
[2:02:03] Accord one mind because for this power

[2:02:42] demonstrate forgiveness if you locked in
[2:02:44] your room all day watching a stream CU
[2:02:46] you have nobody to forgive because for
[2:02:48] you to forgive you have to have some rub

[2:02:55] so God want issues he say you turn the
[2:02:57] church against you he can't turn the

[2:04:06] trial because if we could choose we
[2:04:08] choose the best looking trial Lord I
[2:04:10] want this one give me this particular
[2:04:13] trial don't touch my finances
[2:04:17] Lord whatever trial it give me just
[2:04:19] don't touch the finance you know the
[2:04:21] finance stuff these
[2:04:25] is but God don't give us the Authority
[2:04:29] or the access to choose our
[2:04:34] child but we read the Bible all things
[2:04:36] work together for good to them that love
[2:04:39] God to them who had he called according
[2:04:41] to his purpose some through the water
[2:04:44] some through the flood some through
[2:04:46] great child but all through the
[2:04:52] your trial is designed you may be seated
[2:04:57] you see when UPS come with something to
[2:04:59] sign your trial come with your name your
[2:05:02] picture your email address your phone
[2:05:05] number your ID card it looking for
[2:05:09] you your trial is not for everybody else
[2:05:13] or for anybody else and God promis to
[2:05:15] never give you more than you could bear
[2:05:17] it's designed for your shoulders it
[2:05:19] designed for your feet it or common us
[2:05:21] somebody help me this
[2:05:27] morning the Bible said think it not
[2:05:31] strange this is things we know you know
[2:05:33] when some fiery trial come some of us
[2:05:36] will be if you only know happened to I
[2:05:37] get 82 flat tire think it not
[2:05:41] strange hallelujah what the tire people
[2:05:44] name mileage Mark have a soon they see
[2:05:46] me they know the problem
[2:05:52] Hallelujah think it not straight that is
[2:05:54] really this renewed by the
[2:05:56] transformation of your mind is a process
[2:05:58] you know because things happen to us to
[2:06:01] throw us off and many of us have been in
[2:06:03] the message too long to be acting as if
[2:06:05] these trials are
[2:06:07] strange we let easy things throw us off
[2:06:10] little thing happen here and oh God pray
[2:06:13] for when David comforted himself in the
[2:06:16] Lord
[2:06:21] saying don't reach out for prayer and
[2:06:23] don't call somebody for prayer line and
[2:06:24] support this kind of thing you know but
[2:06:26] there has to be a point where you reach
[2:06:27] a level of maturity that you realize
[2:06:29] that this test is designed to make you a
[2:06:31] better son a better daughter because
[2:06:34] your adoption is based on you passing
[2:06:36] the test of the tutor watching your
[2:06:39] response to the issues of life that God
[2:06:42] and his wisdom sent your away somebody
[2:06:44] preach back to me this
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:48] morning though he slay me yet I trust
[2:06:52] him oh Hallelujah somebody preach back
[2:06:55] to me this morning he'll turn your wife
[2:06:58] against
[2:06:59] you God help us I
[2:07:02] see Brothers have a hand
[2:07:05] up I not I'm not driving on there going
[2:07:07] to hit the
[2:07:11] rivers God knows what trial to send
[2:07:15] because the tutor the Holy Ghost but I'm
[2:07:17] taught this you noce it in the message
[2:07:19] is watching your behavior you know
[2:07:22] so in the midst of a child he hurt me
[2:07:24] and she said this God not testing them
[2:07:27] he testing
[2:07:29] you and he want to see if you could live
[2:07:31] in divine order if you could stay in
[2:07:34] Divine position so you could demonstrate
[2:07:36] and display divine
[2:07:43] power somebody give the Lord a shout of
[2:07:45] praise
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:52] so I know it's a mixed audience and my
[2:07:54] mixed audience because we know in every
[2:07:56] church have three kind of
[2:07:59] Believers have some message just sing
[2:08:01] there only one type of
[2:08:03] believer I know but Niger it on the same
[2:08:05] page with this because Prophet taught us
[2:08:07] and Believers in every
[2:08:11] church cuz even Jesus had a
[2:08:18] devil and Jesus never deacons St him out
[2:08:23] Judas was there down to the end you
[2:08:26] know brother George whole time in church
[2:08:30] he a missed a service
[2:08:32] yet Judas was given power you
[2:08:35] know he was there for all these
[2:08:43] services so it's important that you are
[2:08:45] in your position when a father is in his
[2:08:48] position the home is different
[2:08:54] when fathers are priests in their
[2:08:59] home the
[2:09:01] home is
[2:09:04] different When the Children See their
[2:09:07] father operate as priests in their
[2:09:11] home the world speaks of the absence of
[2:09:14] men and being male is not being a man
[2:09:17] but we are not dealing on that level we
[2:09:19] are Beyond male and Men We dealing with
[2:09:20] priesthood because we are priests and
[2:09:25] Kings when the man in his home is king
[2:09:27] of his home not with the authority of I
[2:09:31] am the boss and bring my food
[2:09:34] and because a king don't have to say I'm
[2:09:37] the
[2:09:39] boss I preach about it many time that
[2:09:41] African slave in America when they try
[2:09:44] to find out that he slaves the the the
[2:09:46] the buyers looking and say I want that
[2:09:49] one say not for sale
[2:09:52] the way he carried
[2:09:53] himself you go anywhere in the world you
[2:09:56] know who bosses are you you know a
[2:09:59] boss I travel a lot and in the airport
[2:10:01] you see people move a certain way and
[2:10:03] you can know that man is a
[2:10:05] boss and he had no ears he don't even
[2:10:08] have to be dressed fancy and it's just
[2:10:09] the way he walk there's an authority
[2:10:11] with it there's a presence with it you
[2:10:14] know he's a man under
[2:10:18] Authority when a father is king of his
[2:10:20] home Tre of his home the home is
[2:10:23] different when a husband loves his wife
[2:10:26] because that's God's order in position
[2:10:30] there's a power in the home there's a
[2:10:32] different love in the home when wives
[2:10:35] reverence their
[2:10:36] husbands all of that is part of order
[2:10:39] all of that is part of the right
[2:10:40] position in the message we have been
[2:10:45] guilty of deep service boy deep mystery
[2:10:47] deep message deep mystery deep message
[2:10:49] deep service and no love
[2:10:55] home I will hit the
[2:10:57] reverse say I come for that kind of
[2:10:59] service this
[2:11:02] morning just just Lift Us Up Lift us
[2:11:08] up when the wife reverence the
[2:11:12] husband husband love the wife as Christ
[2:11:14] loved the church not as your father love
[2:11:16] your
[2:11:18] mother not as the movie say am well I
[2:11:22] see a movie and the husband they love
[2:11:25] the wife and this this and the wife did
[2:11:27] thing thing and thing is see Hollywood
[2:11:30] say shoot
[2:11:32] DTV we have no license for gun and here
[2:11:35] like that you have to get permission
[2:11:37] but because if your
[2:11:40] playbook if the way you want to run your
[2:11:42] home is based on your
[2:11:44] co-workers and the old people this why
[2:11:47] just say the tradition of the elders
[2:11:48] alone is that itself is problem much
[2:11:51] bless with this generation of internet
[2:11:53] and WhatsApp and oh go see this is that
[2:11:55] Bible
[2:11:56] order is that what he Prophet taught us
[2:11:59] I don't care how nice the what I don't
[2:12:00] how nice the music is behind the words
[2:12:02] they saying is that the
[2:12:07] word hallelujah divine order Divine
[2:12:11] position has divine power Divine love
[2:12:14] divine Authority can the church say
[2:12:19] Amen the absence of Kings and Priests
[2:12:23] have forced mothers in
[2:12:24] homes to step into positions that
[2:12:27] they're not supposed to be
[2:12:33] in I don't know how I saying
[2:12:36] this
[2:12:38] but there's a order there's a position
[2:12:42] so when the brother not doing what he's
[2:12:43] supposed to do the wife by her love triy
[2:12:46] to step up but he could step up and end
[2:12:48] up out of position
[2:12:51] I want you catch that but Theon preach
[2:12:54] doing God our
[2:12:55] service without it being his will so the
[2:12:59] mother trying to do her best for the
[2:13:00] home but she actually end up out of
[2:13:02] position because the father not in
[2:13:08] position let me pull the car back out of
[2:13:11] there and get back onto I don't know who
[2:13:14] this is
[2:13:15] for but this is the
[2:13:18] word it is important that you are in in
[2:13:21] your position because your inspiration
[2:13:24] your anointing your strength in your
[2:13:26] life you will struggle when you're out
[2:13:28] of position you could never be blessed
[2:13:30] in the world I said to the young people

[2:13:58] chicken you trying to go to a party I
[2:14:01] trying to try out the
[2:14:02] world you big like four
[2:14:05] chicken
[2:14:08] Hallelujah because you build different
[2:14:11] and you know too much you've been in too
[2:14:13] much

[2:14:17] Services you know what real worship is
[2:14:19] even when in a back sitting condition
[2:14:21] you know that's not your
[2:14:23] [Applause]
[2:14:30] position and as much as you try to fit
[2:14:32] in you will never fit in you try to put
[2:14:35] in the mini skirt you imagine how you
[2:14:39] looking hallu you are

[2:14:46] cut out for thatall
[2:14:51] I hope this helping
[2:14:54] somebody Hallelujah because I don't want
[2:14:56] to take it for
[2:14:58] granted that because people looking good
[2:15:01] on
[2:15:01] Sunday that on a Monday they behav good
[2:15:05] on a Tuesday they behav good I preach a
[2:15:06] message some years ago called between
[2:15:11] Sundays because God are really marking
[2:15:13] the papers on the service here now you
[2:15:15] know but you see
[2:15:17] tomorrow Tuesday Christmas time parang
[2:15:21] time Carnival

[2:15:33] it
[2:15:34] out figure it
[2:15:40] out guard your heart because out of your
[2:15:42] heart are all the issues of
[2:15:45] life you acting like you don't have
[2:15:48] something to protect your soul is worth
[2:15:49] a thousand words
[2:15:51] we have something to protect we have
[2:15:53] something to defend there's an order God
[2:15:55] will bless you when you are in
[2:16:01] [Applause]
[2:16:02] order so I can't understand how people

[2:16:25] Lord but BR say at least take half a
[2:16:29] loaf
[2:16:33] now take something now because plenty of
[2:16:37] those people who so after what they back
[2:16:39] know but say if you don't testify and
[2:16:42] evangelize you will find yourself back
[2:16:43] one day you

[2:17:17] you are persuaded of this thing have you
[2:17:19] told your family about it have you told
[2:17:21] your neighbors about it have you told
[2:17:22] your co-workers about it because you are
[2:17:24] here because somebody told
[2:17:26] you who is carrying on the Bon of this
[2:17:29] gospel until Jesus

[2:20:14] even in death and Bones could come to
[2:20:16] life can the church say amen glory
[2:20:23] you know it Moses would have come I
[2:20:24] think about 200 years or so isra years
[2:20:27] after Joseph died was he Exodus or
[2:20:31] no and somehow he impressed him mean
[2:20:33] enough to say don't leave my bones here
[2:20:35] there's a place that the resurrection is
[2:20:37] going to be and it's not here make sure
[2:20:40] that I'm the place where the
[2:20:41] resurrection is and friends this message
[2:20:44] is the place where the resurrection is
[2:20:46] this message of the yah is the place
[2:20:47] where the life is there's nothing else
[2:20:49] outside of this that will take take it
[2:20:50] to the Rapture but the brand I'm Tau us
[2:20:52] Rapture in faith is laying in the
[2:20:54] message and that's why can say If I Die
[2:20:56] Tomorrow leave my bones in this
[2:21:00] message
[2:21:02] Hallelujah I keeping this because this
[2:21:04] is real can the church say
[2:21:07] Amen Joseph bones with them was a
[2:21:09] reminder of a resur Resurrection coming
[2:21:12] know when you look at it say why we have
[2:21:15] that Daddy because Joseph tell us don't
[2:21:17] leave my bones here I want to go in the
[2:21:19] place where the resurrection is going to
[2:21:20] be the church say amen
[2:21:24] glory
[2:21:26] hallelujah it's
[2:21:28] important that we in the right
[2:21:31] position the right
[2:21:33] order
[2:21:37] Samson had a vow Nazarite
[2:21:40] vow once he didn't cut his hair he was
[2:21:42] in order his position was to serve God's
[2:21:46] people Samson find finding the sisters
[2:21:49] in church here nice
[2:21:53] I no sisters in church
[2:22:23] talking about that the message preaching
[2:22:24] for itself
[2:22:31] there and Samson went out of
[2:22:35] order went out of
[2:22:38] position and had to deal with the
[2:22:40] consequences of
[2:22:45] it the problem with many of us we don't
[2:22:48] understand that God is a judge
[2:22:51] and even though God has Mercy it's
[2:22:53] really a judgment seat with blood on it
[2:22:55] that makes it a mercy
[2:22:56] seat actions have
[2:22:59] consequences people want to play with
[2:23:01] the world and then come to church and
[2:23:02] then this is a serious
[2:23:05] thing it's not as if Samson didn't
[2:23:08] know Samson knew his parents spoke to
[2:23:11] him he understood exactly what it
[2:23:14] was but it was in his heart he was
[2:23:17] anointed but there was something in his
[2:23:20] he was called but there was something in
[2:23:24] his what's in your
[2:23:28] heart he was gifted but there was an
[2:23:31] issue in his
[2:23:33] heart many of us gifts callings anointed
[2:23:38] but there are heart issues that if we
[2:23:41] don't address
[2:23:42] it it will destroy
[2:23:46] us and if you are left vulnerable you'll
[2:23:49] end up out of position out of
[2:23:51] order and with judgment so close upon us
[2:23:54] we come into a time like the Bible says
[2:23:56] in the Book of Revelation he who is
[2:23:58] filthy be filthy still holy holy still
[2:24:02] where a snapshot or a picture is taken
[2:24:04] of your life at that point in time and
[2:24:07] no more change is possible I'm
[2:24:09] challenging the church don't play
[2:24:11] games don't take it for granted this is
[2:24:13] not just another service but it's a
[2:24:16] warning and an encouragement to us to
[2:24:18] ensure that our lives are in order
[2:24:20] and our heart is right with God and we
[2:24:23] are in
[2:24:26] position Samson life he lost his power
[2:24:31] his strength because he was out of
[2:24:34] order and out of
[2:24:40] position blind and
[2:24:43] humiliated a man who once had
[2:24:45] Philistines
[2:24:48] running found himself grinding at the
[2:24:51] middle while his hair grew
[2:25:01] back the only
[2:25:03] way that he could work his way back was
[2:25:06] true
[2:25:08] repentance and while there when nobody
[2:25:11] was watching he starts to pray remember
[2:25:14] me I pray the end strengthen me only
[2:25:16] this once
[2:25:22] avenge me of my two eyes we we
[2:25:24] understand
[2:25:27] this what I want to draw attention to is
[2:25:30] the Bible
[2:25:32] said in this is judges like 16 19 and
[2:25:37] 20 Samson didn't he wish not that the
[2:25:41] Lord was departed from him in other
[2:25:44] words Samson didn't even
[2:25:46] realize when God left him
[2:25:53] you know what it is to be living under a
[2:25:56] covenant and anointing and you don't
[2:25:57] even realize when God are talking to you
[2:26:02] anymore you even realized the anointing
[2:26:04] you thought you had you don't have
[2:26:05] anymore Samson didn't even realize it
[2:26:08] was
[2:26:16] gone but the BAM said every muscle he
[2:26:19] ever had was still his body but the
[2:26:21] blessings had left
[2:26:23] him because he was out of order and he
[2:26:27] was out of position it's a warning to
[2:26:31] us it don't matter the church the size
[2:26:33] whatever going on people have mus
[2:26:35] framework systems all this going on but
[2:26:38] if there's no power there power to live
[2:26:40] a holy life there's something wrong can
[2:26:43] the church say Amen what we are looking
[2:26:45] for is a
[2:26:47] restoration of you coming back into
[2:26:49] order
[2:26:51] coming back into
[2:27:03] position brother Bram said there's a new
[2:27:05] generation coming on now Samson hair
[2:27:07] growed out that's this generation
[2:27:10] here God will restore the consecration
[2:27:12] of his
[2:27:15] people when Samson prayed and positioned
[2:27:18] himself right he said lead me to the
[2:27:23] pillars he wanted to be in
[2:27:27] position he had repented he made things
[2:27:29] right he said lead me to the place he
[2:27:30] say I'm willing to die let me die with
[2:27:33] the
[2:27:35] Philistines I don't care what I have to
[2:27:37] give up once I'm in order and I'm in
[2:27:39] position so if I have to die let me die
[2:27:41] with them but I want to be in order and
[2:27:43] I want to be in
[2:27:44] position I don't care what I have to
[2:27:46] give up once I'm in order once I'm in
[2:27:48] position if I Lo
[2:27:51] friends I'm willing to lose friends once
[2:27:53] I'm in order once I'm in
[2:27:55] position whether I maintain my family
[2:27:58] let me maintain Christ that's what the
[2:27:59] prophet said friend or no
[2:28:05] friend can the church say
[2:28:11] Amen God's
[2:28:13] order we talked a little bit about when
[2:28:16] fathers could you take some more when
[2:28:19] fathers are not in position the mothers
[2:28:20] have to step
[2:28:22] up and throws the whole home out of
[2:28:25] balance out of the goodness of her heart
[2:28:27] she does it but she also ends up out of
[2:28:28] order because the father is supposed to
[2:28:30] be doing things a certain
[2:28:32] way and we
[2:28:34] see that in the Old Testament as we know
[2:28:37] the ark represented God's presence and
[2:28:39] His glory among the people and we see
[2:28:42] that David had a desire to bring the ark
[2:28:45] to
[2:28:47] Jerusalem but the method he approached
[2:28:50] with was out of
[2:28:53] order and it resulted in a
[2:28:55] tragedy and only when he fixed the order
[2:28:59] and position of it did God even bless
[2:29:04] it they set the Ark of God upon a new
[2:29:08] cart we know that right and they brought
[2:29:11] it out to the house of abinadab and
[2:29:13] there's a wonderful brother named
[2:29:15] brother
[2:29:17] usza and when they came to Nation
[2:29:20] stresing floor you could read
[2:29:23] it the ark looked like was going to
[2:29:28] tip and the brother did what anybody
[2:29:31] might do he put his hand to stabilize
[2:29:37] it and the anger of God the Bible said
[2:29:40] was kindled against us and God killed
[2:29:43] him
[2:29:45] there David was had broken because he
[2:29:48] was the one who in instructed this to
[2:29:51] play out that way usza didn't volunteer
[2:29:53] and say let we do with this we no David
[2:29:55] was the one who set it up so this was a
[2:29:56] lesson to
[2:29:58] David about order and
[2:30:02] position they were enus the motive David
[2:30:05] had was right you know let us take the
[2:30:06] ark back to
[2:30:07] Jerusalem it wasn't a bad motive but it
[2:30:11] just underscores that you can't worship
[2:30:13] God serve God do this message in your
[2:30:17] way there's a way that God has
[2:30:19] prescribed for it to be done and as
[2:30:22] enthusiastic and as excited as David and
[2:30:24] Israel
[2:30:26] were who death shook
[2:30:31] David David would later confess to the
[2:30:33] priest if he had done it the right
[2:30:38] way for the Lord Our God made a breach
[2:30:40] upon us for that we sought him not after
[2:30:42] the due order that's the words used
[2:30:45] because the ark had rings and a stage
[2:30:47] for a reason set out there for the leis
[2:30:50] in the book of
[2:30:53] Exodus after Us's dead they put the ark
[2:30:56] down into the home of Obed Edom for
[2:30:59] three months the Bible says and that
[2:31:02] house was blessed blessing after
[2:31:04] blessing after blessing because the ark
[2:31:06] was in the
[2:31:08] house and it made me think what kind of
[2:31:11] house was that
[2:31:13] house that they could leave the Ark of
[2:31:16] the
[2:31:17] Covenant into somebody's house
[2:31:23] could the Ark of the Covenant be brought
[2:31:25] into your
[2:31:28] home what kind of brother was
[2:31:31] this that God would have been pleased
[2:31:33] with the black
[2:31:34] man to say leave the Ark in this home
[2:31:37] for three
[2:31:40] months is your home conducive to the Ark
[2:31:43] of the Covenant being left in your home
[2:31:47] you know what you're watching on the TV
[2:31:50] you know the books but ROM say show me
[2:31:51] the books show me how your Bible written
[2:31:53] up show me who comes to your house and I
[2:31:56] know who you are so it made me think as
[2:31:59] we talk about order and position for
[2:32:01] three months the ark stayed in this
[2:32:04] brother's
[2:32:05] home blessing after blessing and I asked
[2:32:09] myself could the ark live in my
[2:32:14] home am I talking to my wife the right
[2:32:17] way am I living the right way that God
[2:32:19] will be
[2:32:20] pleased to leave the Ark in my home this
[2:32:23] is the ark that was in the holies of
[2:32:28] holies what kind of home should we have
[2:32:31] what does being in order look like what
[2:32:34] does being in position look like that
[2:32:37] God could be pleased he just killed a
[2:32:40] man for touching it and the man who
[2:32:43] touch it was trying to save it from
[2:32:44] falling and he killed him because that
[2:32:46] man was not supposed to touch it but
[2:32:49] here's another another brother whose
[2:32:51] home has to be in order for God to be
[2:32:54] able to leave the Ark of the Covenant
[2:32:56] not death for a day not just for a
[2:32:59] Sunday not just for a week but for three
[2:33:03] months how do you live in a home with
[2:33:07] the Ark of the Covenant inside of your
[2:33:12] house because the priest had to prepare
[2:33:15] himself a certain way to enter the
[2:33:17] holies of holies he had to be in order
[2:33:20] he had to wash a certain way he had to
[2:33:22] not have done certain things he had to
[2:33:24] dress a certain way he had to have been
[2:33:27] Sanctified they even approach the holies
[2:33:29] of holies or there was
[2:33:33] death he would tie they would tie a rope
[2:33:36] around him and they didn't hear the
[2:33:38] bells ringing they knew he was dead and
[2:33:41] they would pull him out but here's a
[2:33:43] brother that for three months the Ark of
[2:33:48] the Covenant is in his
[2:33:53] home how would you talk to your wife if
[2:33:57] the Ark of the Covenant is in your home
[2:34:01] who would you bring into your house if
[2:34:03] the Ark of the Covenant is in your home
[2:34:07] what movies would you watch if the Ark
[2:34:10] of the Covenant is in the middle of your
[2:34:12] home what books would you read if the
[2:34:16] Ark of the Covenant is in the middle of
[2:34:19] your home home what would you watch on
[2:34:21] your phone if the Ark of the Covenant is
[2:34:25] in the middle of your home would you
[2:34:28] pray before you go to bed if the Ark of
[2:34:30] the Covenant is in the middle of your
[2:34:33] home would you just get up in the
[2:34:35] morning and go to work if the Ark of the
[2:34:38] Covenant was sitting in the middle of
[2:34:42] your home would you say what you want in
[2:34:46] your own home if the Ark of the Covenant
[2:34:49] was sitting in the middle of your home
[2:34:54] huj it wasn't one day it wasn't two days
[2:34:57] it wasn't one week it wasn't two weeks
[2:34:59] but for three months the Ark of the
[2:35:01] Covenant was in this man's
[2:35:13] house God had made very clear
[2:35:17] instructions of how the temple must be
[2:35:20] and how the Tabernacle must be and the
[2:35:22] order it had to be to protect the Ark of
[2:35:24] the
[2:35:26] Covenant but yet God could find a
[2:35:28] brother whose house was in order that
[2:35:31] amidst the mistake that David made he
[2:35:34] could say put it in that brother's
[2:35:36] house put it in that house over there is
[2:35:39] there a house that we could find today
[2:35:41] in Trinidad that God could drop the Ark
[2:35:44] of the Covenant
[2:35:46] [Applause]
[2:35:52] [Applause]
[2:35:54] Hallelujah can we find our home in order
[2:35:57] is there any home in order is there any
[2:36:00] house in order is anybody's life in
[2:36:02] order that we could bring the Ark of the
[2:36:04] Covenant and we can knock on your door
[2:36:07] and say we need a place to rest the AR
[2:36:09] of the Covenant is this house is this
[2:36:12] house in order is this house in order we
[2:36:15] are dealing with the grief of losing
[2:36:17] brother usza we messed up we didn't
[2:36:20] handle it right but we need to rest the
[2:36:22] ark here until we put things in
[2:36:24] place and this brother could say please
[2:36:28] it's okay bring it in my home I don't
[2:36:32] know how long you need to stay but as
[2:36:33] long as you need to stay Lord you could
[2:36:35] say as long as you need to stay we
[2:36:37] welcome your presence in my home I want
[2:36:39] your presence in my home I want you to
[2:36:41] be in my home I want to
[2:36:45] hallelu
[2:36:48] hallelujah thank you
[2:37:00] this is the same Ark of the
[2:37:01] Covenant when the Philistines took it
[2:37:04] they put it in a room and God knocked
[2:37:07] down their God the same Ark of the
[2:37:09] Covenant that went before them when they
[2:37:11] went into war this is the same Ark of
[2:37:13] the Covenant where the glory the kind of
[2:37:16] Glory was upon the Ark of the Covenant
[2:37:20] [Applause]
[2:37:24] God is looking for a home a temple a
[2:37:30] body can he drop the ark into your
[2:37:34] socket of your heart is there space in
[2:37:36] there that could fit the ark of the
[2:37:38] covenant could the holy God step into
[2:37:41] your 16 element know ye not that he are
[2:37:44] the temples of the Holy
[2:37:47] Ghost Hallelujah
[2:37:58] [Music]
[2:38:12] this is the story friends that led to
[2:38:15] David dancing before the
[2:38:17] ark Hallelujah because when brother usza
[2:38:20] died they found a home that was worthy
[2:38:24] to keep the ark Hallelujah for 3 months
[2:38:27] some of us can't go a day without
[2:38:30] misbehaving some of us can't go a half
[2:38:32] day without getting out of character
[2:38:35] because we have not yet been converted
[2:38:37] Lord I want to be converted Lord I want
[2:38:39] to be changed Lord I want to be
[2:38:41] transformed I don't want it to be a show
[2:38:44] I don't want it to be words only because
[2:38:46] he let her kill it but the spirit gives
[2:38:48] life I want experience so that the Ark
[2:38:51] of the Covenant I could be near it it
[2:38:53] could be near me and I'll be found
[2:39:02] worthy and after three months the Bible
[2:39:06] said David UNC came again but this time
[2:39:10] it was in order this time it wasn't
[2:39:13] Brothers this time it was the Levites
[2:39:16] this time they had the staves this time
[2:39:18] because they had a c the first time but
[2:39:21] this time it was on the shoulders of God
[2:39:23] anointed men it was in the shoulders of
[2:39:26] Levites who were of the right tribe they
[2:39:28] were of the right lineage they were Of
[2:39:30] The Bloodline they were of the ironic
[2:39:32] priesthood they had been anointed and
[2:39:34] prepared for such a time as this and
[2:39:36] here they are walking with the ark and
[2:39:39] God is pleased God is pleased and David
[2:39:43] feeling this he start to dance he start
[2:39:46] to dance as they coming into Jerusalem

[2:39:52] coming up the road can the church say
[2:39:54] amen he couldn't contain himself he

[2:39:59] that God was pleased because everything
[2:40:01] was in
[2:40:03] order God give us a church in order give
[2:40:06] us a home in order give us lives that
[2:40:09] are in order for the coming of the

[2:40:32] you want
[2:40:35] to some people can't find their
[2:40:41] Bible I preach about this when I talk
[2:40:43] about the war of altars and
[2:40:47] Priests technology has changed
[2:40:50] I have no problem with you use your
[2:40:51] phone to search a scripture and now we
[2:40:55] have the table app and these things but
[2:40:58] this is a corrupt device this cannot be
[2:41:01] your only means of seeing the
[2:41:04] wordl can I
[2:41:07] preach because you can't be a priest and
[2:41:10] your whole Ministry on a
[2:41:13] phone
[2:41:15] amelu that brings a level of casualness
[2:41:18] to this thing amen I have no problem you
[2:41:20] search things on your phone and your
[2:41:21] iPad and your tablet I'm using a tablet
[2:41:24] to preach from there's no problem with
[2:41:26] using technology but as a priest because
[2:41:28] you are Kings and Priests as a priest
[2:41:31] you must have your altar as a priest you
[2:41:33] must have your your moment when you
[2:41:34] spend time with God you must have your
[2:41:36] sacrifice you must approaching a certain
[2:41:38] way there must be something about you
[2:41:40] that's not like everybody else there
[2:41:41] must be a secret closet that you go into
[2:41:44] where it's you and God alone because you

[2:41:58] back Holiness God hasn't I am the Lord

[2:42:07] yesterday today and forever he is still
[2:42:09] holy he still hates
[2:42:12] sin and as much as the world wants us to

[2:42:16] it there's still a holiness you come to
[2:42:20] the house of God with reverence you
[2:42:22] appro you approach to prayer with
[2:42:23] reverence you come to the altar the
[2:42:25] Bible say if you come to the altar to

[2:42:36] bring back the oldfashioned way bring
[2:42:38] back the sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost
[2:42:42] kind of church because God is looking
[2:42:44] for a church that sin cannot stay in the
[2:42:47] church because the church is in
[2:42:59] so as anointed as David was the first
[2:43:02] time he couldn't just move the ark the
[2:43:05] way he wanted to even though his motive
[2:43:08] was right I want to serve God I want to
[2:43:10] sing a song I want to do this make sure
[2:43:12] it's in order that's why brother
[2:43:14] brandham says conduct order Doctrine
[2:43:16] there's a way to do things
[2:43:22] could you take some
[2:43:25] more
[2:43:28] Hallelujah there's a law of
[2:43:32] position yes brother po that that hit
[2:43:35] home three months Boy could the ark live
[2:43:38] in your home for three months think
[2:43:40] about that all week what do we have to
[2:43:43] do in our home some people when a guest
[2:43:45] come in they do what kind of thing to
[2:43:46] prepare for the guest if somebody say
[2:43:49] but Michael we want to bring the Ark of
[2:43:51] the Covenant into your
[2:43:52] home what type of preparation brother
[2:43:54] George we want to bring the Ark of the
[2:43:56] Covenant into your
[2:43:59] home but Anne we want to bring the Ark
[2:44:01] of the Covenant into your home what type
[2:44:04] of
[2:44:05] preparation should we be doing the ark
[2:44:07] want to come there this evening Lord
[2:44:08] help us like woman who lost the coin you
[2:44:11] had a sweep rast the Neighbors in the
[2:44:14] dust
[2:44:16] flying because the Lord could drop in
[2:44:19] anytime we want to be
[2:44:22] ready I don't know how much warning but
[2:44:24] the terance they gave that brother with
[2:44:25] the ark that they coming
[2:44:27] in because these brothers were operating
[2:44:29] in a
[2:44:30] crisis a officer just
[2:44:33] died trying to do what you thought was
[2:44:35] right we need to find a place now Lord
[2:44:37] help
[2:44:40] us right
[2:44:42] order right position right power the
[2:44:46] Prophet Elijah sat to get ready to
[2:44:50] land when he confronted Israel's
[2:44:53] backslidden condition on Mount Caramel
[2:44:56] the nation was out of position the
[2:44:59] nation was out of order they worshiping
[2:45:02] Bal all the prophets all them all kind
[2:45:04] of
[2:45:05] foolishness well the first thing that
[2:45:07] Elijah did we know it he
[2:45:09] repaired the
[2:45:11] altar he put it back in order the altar
[2:45:16] was broken down lord
[2:45:20] all of us have a
[2:45:21] responsibility to repair broken
[2:45:30] altars it's one thing for your altar to
[2:45:32] be broken it's another thing if you
[2:45:34] don't fix
[2:45:35] it make this may this be your burden in
[2:45:38] this service and from this day on to fix
[2:45:41] the broken
[2:45:43] altar fixing the altar will lead to a
[2:45:46] repair of your marriage fixing the altar
[2:45:49] will change the situation in your job
[2:45:52] fixing the altar will change the
[2:45:54] situation with your family your
[2:45:56] financial breakthrough is tied to fixing
[2:46:00] the altar because as a priest the altar
[2:46:03] is the mechanism by which you could even
[2:46:06] offer anything to
[2:46:09] God he repaired the altar he put 12
[2:46:12] Stones representing the 12 tribes in
[2:46:14] unity you he about the Nigel said it's a
[2:46:17] Unity there has to be a Unity of the
[2:46:19] spirit before the unity of the faith is
[2:46:22] one Lord One Faith one baptism different
[2:46:24] gifts different administration of the
[2:46:25] gifts different parts of the body God is
[2:46:28] blessing all over the world no one has a
[2:46:30] monopoly on this thing but there has to
[2:46:32] be a point because we are one
[2:46:37] body so Elijah stood there 12 tribes
[2:46:40] bring the stones together symbolically
[2:46:42] setting things back in divine order and
[2:46:45] only after the altar was put back in
[2:46:47] place could the fire of God fall and
[2:46:52] this shows that when we restore the
[2:46:54] broken altars in our lives only then
[2:46:57] could true worship be offered unto God
[2:47:01] can the church say Amen
[2:47:04] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:47:08] Hallelujah blessed in the right position
[2:47:11] blessed in the right
[2:47:13] order every believer has a position in
[2:47:16] the body of Christ that's right so we're
[2:47:19] moving now Beyond upper room and
[2:47:21] physical position and order to you
[2:47:23] having your place in the body there are
[2:47:25] many quotes on it there are many
[2:47:27] messages in it position in Christ and
[2:47:28] all these cours adoption placing being
[2:47:31] positionally placed we know the
[2:47:33] message but you have to find your place
[2:47:35] in the body God sets his commanding
[2:47:38] officers his Generals in place pastors
[2:47:41] Prophet teachers evangelists for the
[2:47:43] perfecting of the Saints but every
[2:47:45] believer has a place he talks about the
[2:47:48] adopted wife
[2:47:50] housewife the farmer it doesn't matter
[2:47:52] what your station is in life you are
[2:47:55] placed into the body having gone through
[2:47:58] your place of trying and testing and God
[2:48:00] can give you stamp of approval to say
[2:48:02] there is my spirit flowing freely not
[2:48:04] there is the message in knowledge and
[2:48:06] you know the quotes flowing freely but
[2:48:07] there's my spirit flowing freely and the
[2:48:09] spirit flowing freely is one that could
[2:48:10] forgive and love and and and demonstrate
[2:48:13] the attributes of God because you
[2:48:15] realize that this is not our home we are
[2:48:17] creatures of Eternity
[2:48:19] in
[2:48:20] time can the church say Amen the
[2:48:23] adoption or placing of a son to place us
[2:48:26] into the position giving you the
[2:48:29] authority to use the father's name can
[2:48:32] the church say Amen bringing us to
[2:48:34] maturity into opposition to exercise
[2:48:38] Authority Hallelujah adoption position
[2:48:41] he placing this is my son in whom I'm
[2:48:44] well pleased that is going to repeat
[2:48:46] again here on this island I can't speak
[2:48:48] for any other country because God put
[2:48:50] this Earth here this is my home this is
[2:48:52] my country but I have to believe that on
[2:48:54] this island God will find sons and
[2:48:56] daughters that he could place into
[2:48:58] position and give them power and in that
[2:49:01] experience they will have what it takes
[2:49:02] to go to the Rapture to be changed
[2:49:05] because the Raptor is on the Inside Out
[2:49:07] Hallelujah these 16 elements going to
[2:49:10] have a body change can the church say
[2:49:14] Amen the adoption or placing cannot
[2:49:17] happen if you are out of order
[2:49:19] if you are
[2:49:20] out of
[2:49:23] position it's a Divine Law the right
[2:49:27] position will attract the promised
[2:49:30] power the musician will get ready
[2:49:36] Hallelujah and that's why I asked for
[2:49:38] that song I want to
[2:49:40] go where you want me to because I want
[2:49:43] to be in the
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:49:45] place because that's the only blessing
[2:49:47] the blessing is in the place it C be in
[2:49:50] my place if the Lord say Isaac stop
[2:49:53] preaching tomorrow I'm happy with that
[2:49:55] because if that is where God want me
[2:49:56] that's where I to go but if he say go
[2:49:58] and preach and tell the world that God
[2:50:01] is real then I have to do it whether I
[2:50:03] feel like it but an has a great
[2:50:05] responsibility but over that all the
[2:50:06] ministers all those who are called to
[2:50:08] serve in this time some do it and you're
[2:50:11] feeling good but you have to do it
[2:50:13] because you want to go where he wants
[2:50:15] you to knowing that the blessing is in
[2:50:18] doing what God wants you to do whether
[2:50:20] your family support whether your boss
[2:50:22] support whe it doesn't matter because
[2:50:24] you want to be in divine order you want
[2:50:26] to be in a Divine position for divine
[2:50:28] power can the church say Amen so the
[2:50:32] whole world the creation is groaning for
[2:50:34] the sons of God to come into
[2:50:38] manifestation Hallelujah the
[2:50:40] manifestation of the sons of God and
[2:50:42] that's what this whole message is about
[2:50:44] to turn the hearts of the children who
[2:50:47] are out of position
[2:50:49] back to the faith of the fathers because
[2:50:52] the fathers were brought into position
[2:50:54] at that early church because that's what
[2:50:56] Jesus did it was the acts of the Holy
[2:50:59] Ghost in the apostles that church was in
[2:51:02] order Paul was the gold standard that
[2:51:04] Alpha church was a template that was set
[2:51:07] in order and this end time Prophet had a
[2:51:10] mission a Ministry and God doesn't take
[2:51:13] a man home unless his job is done so he
[2:51:15] did the work he was supposed to do to
[2:51:17] point us back to that Al church so we
[2:51:19] could know exactly what it should look
[2:51:21] like and he could say the promise of the
[2:51:23] Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on
[2:51:25] that
[2:51:26] day no for us it's the fullness because
[2:51:29] everything has been restored there's no
[2:51:31] mystery that is yet to be unveiled
[2:51:33] because he revealed every mystery every
[2:51:35] mystery was revealed in that Elijah can
[2:51:37] the church say Amen so we are not
[2:51:39] guessing this morning we know we have
[2:51:41] the word we know the promises that have
[2:51:44] been preached now it's time for us to
[2:51:46] get into our position
[2:51:49] because our blessing is in our position
[2:51:52] can the church say amen and amen can we
[2:51:55] give the Lord a shout of
[2:52:04] Praise when the bride is fully restored
[2:52:08] into her position only then could she be
[2:52:12] ready for the climax of power which will
[2:52:15] bring on the resurrection and the
[2:52:17] rapture can the church say Amen coming
[2:52:21] into the statue of a perfect man the
[2:52:23] fullness of Christ the church ultimate
[2:52:26] position as the bride United with the
[2:52:29] bridegroom Hallelujah can the church say
[2:52:32] Amen can we give the Lord a shout of
[2:52:35] Praise I'm
[2:52:38] finished God is a god of restoration he
[2:52:42] is restoring today he's restoring you
[2:52:44] into your position to take us straight
[2:52:47] back to Eden Hallelujah let's all stand
[2:52:49] and give God a hand of Praise I'm
[2:52:55] finished you love the
[2:52:57] Lord then let the redeemed say
[2:53:00] so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:53:04] hallelujah
[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:13] Glory you can play something Softly
[2:53:27] the prodigal
[2:53:32] son he was fine at
[2:53:37] home it would seem he was in order it
[2:53:39] would seem he was in his
[2:53:42] position until one day he say father
[2:53:44] give me everything that's mine
[2:53:48] we don't know what his motive was what
[2:53:50] his objective was but he got what was
[2:53:52] his and he left to go to a far country
[2:53:56] and he found
[2:53:58] himself out of order out of position a
[2:54:02] Jew eating pig
[2:54:03] [Music]
[2:54:09] food I don't know how long it took him
[2:54:12] to realize that this is not
[2:54:14] right because the Bible says he came to
[2:54:16] his senses
[2:54:19] which meant for a while he was out of
[2:54:21] his
[2:54:23] senses maybe he thought he could handle
[2:54:25] it maybe he felt
[2:54:27] ashamed he say n
[2:54:29] [Music]
[2:54:32] boy I make my bed I want to lie in
[2:54:35] it until one day he said you know what
[2:54:39] I'm not even worthy to be called a
[2:54:42] son and many of us we go through
[2:54:44] experiences and we start to Discount
[2:54:46] ourselves
[2:54:48] at what he did he say I'm not worthy to
[2:54:49] be called a son and in his mind he
[2:54:53] classified himself as a servant he say
[2:54:55] even the servants get better treatment
[2:54:58] than
[2:54:59] this I will arise and I will go back
[2:55:04] home in his mind in his heart he was
[2:55:07] willing to accept servant level
[2:55:10] treatment because he felt he had
[2:55:12] forfeited the right to be a
[2:55:16] son he did not come to the Revelation
[2:55:19] yet once a son always a
[2:55:22] son so in his broken condition he starts
[2:55:25] to make his way
[2:55:27] home with each step he took home he was
[2:55:30] coming closer to be back in order and
[2:55:33] closer to be back into
[2:55:36] position little did he know that his
[2:55:39] father was there looking out for
[2:55:42] him the father made it his business he
[2:55:45] said this boy one day is going to going
[2:55:48] to find his way
[2:55:49] home it wasn't a lookout s son it wasn't
[2:55:52] a watch s son it was the father because
[2:55:55] the father knew that this boy had a
[2:55:57] place had a family had a home had people
[2:56:01] who cared for him people who loved him
[2:56:03] and one day something would happen to
[2:56:07] bring him back
[2:56:08] home I don't know who this is for I'm
[2:56:11] not trying to force anything but there
[2:56:13] are many broken people who have been
[2:56:17] through a lot and I want to say to you I
[2:56:19] don't want you to Discount who you are
[2:56:22] because of the mistakes that you made
[2:56:25] because that's what the prodical son did
[2:56:27] he was coming home to accept less than
[2:56:31] he
[2:56:32] was and when the father saw him he
[2:56:35] didn't
[2:56:36] say the servant is home he said my long
[2:56:40] lost
[2:56:42] son his
[2:56:44] home he said go kill the fatted calf go
[2:56:47] get the music ready get the robe get the
[2:56:50] ring get the celebration going because
[2:56:52] my son is coming home my son is coming
[2:56:56] back in order my son is coming back into
[2:56:59] position there's safety in his home
[2:57:02] there's safety in his home he don't have
[2:57:04] any money but he's still safe here he is
[2:57:07] welcome home and I want to encourage you
[2:57:10] Church you are welcome to make things
