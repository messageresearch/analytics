[53:36] words or a few words so I will try my
[53:39] best
[53:39] and I really feel sorry for me if you
[53:45] don't feel sorry for me I feel sorry for
[53:47] me
[53:48] amen what so I got a new title this
[53:52] morning God shall declare a lamp again
[53:56] amen
[54:10] okay I'm trying to keep track of my time
[54:12] here so I don't hold your too long so
[54:17] God shall declare lamb again and a
[54:19] little inspiration lamb for one house
[54:21] which of course but the fuels
[54:23] inspirational is the inventor message is
[54:28] to apply the talking and we know the
[54:31] even 10 messages brother branham's
[54:32] message that God sent to us through that
[54:35] great larger profit of Malachi 4 ma now
[54:38] we call it the message the even term
[54:40] message but the evening time message if
[54:43] you don't know what it is is to apply
[54:44] the talking and the main sense have
[54:46] tried in the series of services to like
[54:48] let us understand what it means to apply
[54:51] the talking and I'm gonna carry on the
[54:53] same trend this morning and brother
[54:56] Branham said and he's been quoted back
[54:58] and forth so I don't really have to quit
[55:00] but maybe I just read to you but the
[55:02] balance said the talk and when you pray
[55:03] the talk in September in France 1963
[55:05] started talking when it came in the
[55:07] night and picked desperations he said
[55:09] the talk in the message this morning he
[55:10] said it was the highlight of my ministry
[55:13] is in terms of regular service preaching
[55:15] the message this money was the cap
[55:17] impact of my ministry the talk in the
[55:21] cotton pad amen
[55:23] let me just let me just get a call for
[55:26] you from Allah Branham here
[55:38] all right he said this morning the
[55:40] message this morning was to me the
[55:42] highlights of my entire ministry this
[55:44] morning see a highlight message of my
[55:46] entire ministry
[55:47] some day I'll tell you how it come about
[55:48] and I know that everything has worked
[55:51] for months and months and months up to
[55:52] there one message moving up to come to
[55:55] that place that was the cap in of time
[55:57] of it you see and I'm sure I hope you
[56:01] get what the talking meant the talk is
[56:05] the sign that the blood has been applied
[56:08] now that the price that's been asked
[56:11] required of God Jesus paid the price by
[56:14] shedding his own blood he did that then
[56:17] from his life came the Holy Spirit and
[56:20] when the blood is applied to you the
[56:23] Holy Spirit talking that your price is
[56:25] paid
[56:26] God has received one does the talking
[56:29] remember that is the talking now what is
[56:32] saying here is that God gives you the
[56:35] token which is the Holy Spirit when you
[56:39] have applied the blood amen very simple
[56:46] very simple but you know too many times
[56:48] so many of these things become clichés
[56:51] tours we just say the things without
[56:52] really looking at what it means and if
[56:55] we just hears the word and you don't
[56:58] really apply it the Bible says if you
[57:01] hear the word and you don't apply it you
[57:03] are like a man who looks in the mirror
[57:04] and straightaway he forgets what he
[57:07] looks like so we look into the mirror of
[57:10] the world and see what it tells us and
[57:12] we go from there and apply to our lives
[57:14] to let the word mix with our lives amen
[57:18] glory to God amen amen
[57:22] nice Shepherd of 28 now this man I told
[57:24] you been not with you I thought we had
[57:26] another two or three a message this
[57:28] morning but I just don't stand it and I
[57:31] thought I just carried that over for
[57:32] tonight but it was just such a menace I
[57:35] don't know what other people got it or
[57:37] not I hope the two every I hope they do
[57:40] everywhere and I hope there was some
[57:42] good tips on it so he can be carried out
[57:44] to be known that I believed all the
[57:46] mister I ever brought that that that
[57:49] that apps
[57:51] was ordained of God outside of a cause
[57:54] the regular Commission like the seven
[57:55] states and things that was directly the
[57:58] Word of God I'm talking about a message
[58:01] to preach I believe that one was it see
[58:04] the one that's needed to follow these
[58:06] seven seals
[58:08] now watch what's come after the seven
[58:11] seals that uniting of the people your
[58:14] Nana shines red light flashing you know
[58:16] he said you know he said after the
[58:19] mysteries in the book of finish and
[58:22] finish on all over then it's time for
[58:24] the sis on the backside which is the
[58:27] seven thunders on the back of the book
[58:28] because Malachi fought the great and
[58:31] larger profit he had the authority the
[58:33] seven thunders and put them before the
[58:36] back of the book in the world but it
[58:39] said when the inside with the mysteries
[58:42] are finished then it's time for the
[58:44] backside seven thunders so watch what is
[58:47] saying here
[58:48] he said now watch what's come after the
[58:51] seven seals the you none of the people
[58:53] united signs the red light flashing in
[58:56] the last days the son of the women
[58:58] getting prettier and man what they would
[59:00] do all these signs of the holy sprit
[59:02] leenock then come right back here to the
[59:05] capping off of all those messages in the
[59:08] seven seals is capped off in this one
[59:11] thing the token that we are all right
[59:16] now put a pedal prick the token you can
[59:20] be sure you can you're talking I don't
[59:21] know it's all right is the right talking
[59:24] for the right Johnny at the right price
[59:26] you cannot make sure amen
[59:29] the talking that way all right see just
[59:33] check ourselves and see if we're in the
[59:36] faith they make and it was a man in the
[59:40] Bible Jesus was called the Lamb of God
[59:43] when John saw him coming he said behold
[59:47] the lamb of God who takes away the sin
[59:49] of the world not the scenes of the world
[59:52] but the parent chorus sings the
[59:54] attributes of sin
[59:56] since a lion fornication and all that
[1:00:00] stuff those are attributes of sin but
[1:00:03] sin is unbelief so Jesus Christ the lamb
[1:00:06] came to pick sin at its roots to get sin
[1:00:12] at its origin to uproot and root at
[1:00:15] unbelief that's why Jesus came
[1:00:18] behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[1:00:20] the sin of the roll
[1:00:22] glory to God a man when you see the lamp
[1:00:26] on the scene
[1:00:26] you're no redemption is taking place
[1:00:28] when you see the lamb in the picture
[1:00:31] you're no sin has made its master
[1:00:33] I said sin has met its master when you
[1:00:37] see the lamp of God on the sin Oh Lord
[1:00:42] oh god hallelujah amen glory the holy
[1:00:50] man
[1:00:50] so when the lamb comes in the picture
[1:00:53] you know right away it's time to be
[1:00:57] talking to yourself to be having a
[1:00:59] conversation seer yourself that sin has
[1:01:01] met its master seen as marriage Waterloo
[1:01:04] and to rejoice them too tense numbers
[1:01:07] shout because you know the difference
[1:01:09] there at the door the master is come and
[1:01:12] they call it for thee oh well are you
[1:01:16] here this morning
[1:01:17] you got some sin problem because some
[1:01:19] pundits problem you can still rejoice in
[1:01:22] the master is in the house master Jesus
[1:01:26] the great lamp of God is in the house
[1:01:33] behold the lamb of God we together with
[1:01:36] the scene of the world he will get your
[1:01:39] sin and it's very roots and root it out
[1:01:43] and set you free Morry
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:50] whoa riddles caught him men amen you
[1:01:57] know in the Bible when you see a lamb
[1:02:00] right down through the Bible when you
[1:02:03] see the lamb the animal the lamb is a 10
[1:02:06] if our Redemption every papal reader
[1:02:08] knows that but the bleeding blood lamb
[1:02:11] like we see in Revelation 5
[1:02:13] that's the Redeemer because not just a
[1:02:16] lamp is the lamb that has shed his blood
[1:02:18] so the lamb represent Redemption amen
[1:02:22] but the real embody lamb represents the
[1:02:25] Redeemer who are shed his blood that if
[1:02:27] people can be redeemed Oh hallelujah
[1:02:32] question why would God use the lamb and
[1:02:37] an email to the pure Redemption
[1:02:41] why would God like many times use the
[1:02:44] lamb to depict his children you and I
[1:02:46] why would God use even himself as a lamb
[1:02:51] behold the lamb of God which takes away
[1:02:54] the sin of the world very simple answer
[1:02:56] simply because this animal the land got
[1:03:02] the critter created like every other
[1:03:04] generation but the animal of the lamb
[1:03:06] has the qualities that God expects to
[1:03:11] see in sons and daughters of God who are
[1:03:14] walking the road to redemption and
[1:03:18] that's why he uses the lamb as a symbol
[1:03:22] of redemption
[1:03:23] it is the lamb as the article of
[1:03:26] redemption
[1:03:26] use the lamb to represent Redemption all
[1:03:28] the time that's why I call him stuff
[1:03:31] also the Lamb of God amen
[1:03:34] Oh glory to Claudia man I know the story
[1:03:39] another story is Miss Edna smells
[1:03:42] already so crumb cake or sponge cake now
[1:03:48] animals I to fall bean you know that
[1:03:55] you know that's the amen Aya's don't
[1:03:59] have soooo
[1:04:00] and we human beings that go use the
[1:04:05] redemption i mean they are the lamb to
[1:04:08] represent our Redemption we are three
[1:04:11] full beam we have a soul and the animal
[1:04:14] doesn't have a soul now there's a
[1:04:17] disconnect lesson we're all for the Old
[1:04:22] Testament years all through the course
[1:04:24] of many years from their sojourn in
[1:04:26] Egypt all the way to when they came out
[1:04:28] and God will reap our of them immemorial
[1:04:31] down through the years when they came
[1:04:33] out of Egypt the talking and in the
[1:04:36] author's many years in the wilderness
[1:04:37] yes all around the world have the
[1:04:40] ceremony and every year they will come
[1:04:43] to the high priest and lay they bring
[1:04:45] their lamb
[1:04:46] leave their hand upon that lamb or he
[1:04:48] could or whatever and it would take it
[1:04:50] has seen away for one year and they'll
[1:04:51] come back again which we know the story
[1:04:54] what I'm going to show you something I
[1:04:56] want to show you something you know we
[1:05:04] know that the life of the lamb could not
[1:05:08] come back upon the believer the
[1:05:11] worshiper how many know that say Amen we
[1:05:14] know that so why will God do it when the
[1:05:19] life of the lamb could not come back
[1:05:21] simply because the lamb doesn't have a
[1:05:24] soul and we have a soul so ways the life
[1:05:28] the life can come from a spirit of the
[1:05:30] lamb into man soul does it is connect
[1:05:33] there but God led forces happen to let
[1:05:36] you see there's a need for Redeemer and
[1:05:40] this is just a substitute that we are
[1:05:43] gonna go to no pick+ gonna allow and
[1:05:46] accept and that alone lets you know
[1:05:48] there's a real thing to come in there's
[1:05:51] a real lamb coming down the road this is
[1:05:54] not the real am all those substituted
[1:05:56] autism and I'm not the real thing and
[1:05:58] there were only a super until the real
[1:06:00] lamb become a man the Lamb of God which
[1:06:03] is away the sin of the world
[1:06:05] amen I want to follow up on the dealing
[1:06:11] number the Peter so I'm all school but i
[1:06:14] feels try to get me to a new school all
[1:06:16] these years and so i want to can you
[1:06:22] give me the first because up okay all
[1:06:25] right all right
[1:06:25] i do this one once before in about three
[1:06:28] years ago in some information nigeria it
[1:06:31] feels good to or I take a look at this
[1:06:37] take a look at this an animal has a body
[1:06:41] and a spirit all animals have their own
[1:06:45] nature - just like you have your nature
[1:06:47] a lion is the king of the jungle
[1:06:50] it will grow back oh and every other
[1:06:52] animal will keep quiet and don't go back
[1:06:56] you know it could will do whatever they
[1:06:59] have the different nature's animals
[1:07:03] everybody and their spirit that's where
[1:07:06] the nature is controlled from because
[1:07:09] they have no soul but look at man that's
[1:07:12] you and I we have three compartments a
[1:07:15] body I mean a soul a spirit anybody for
[1:07:22] us our our nature is controlled from the
[1:07:25] soul and that's what the branch that the
[1:07:32] soul is the nature of the Spirit in
[1:07:35] other words the soul gives them give a
[1:07:38] spirit its nature
[1:07:40] so whatever nature you sure you have
[1:07:43] it's hiding somewhere in your soul
[1:07:45] that's the origin that's the control
[1:07:47] center that gives you the attitude thing
[1:07:50] character whatever it is that you have
[1:07:52] is right in the soul is not the things
[1:07:56] that I Amanda pollute man is the things
[1:07:58] that go from inside man to the outside a
[1:08:00] pollutant can you say a man nor in a god
[1:08:07] so here's the problem this animal here
[1:08:13] even though it seemed less but it can
[1:08:17] transfer its fear
[1:08:18] into men's so we're men's nature's
[1:08:23] control from so all the to do was lay
[1:08:27] hand on your sacrifice identify your
[1:08:30] sacrifice and course is the innocent
[1:08:32] life of that lamb and forgive you for
[1:08:35] one whole year but because the lamb
[1:08:38] didn't have the power to transfer its
[1:08:40] own power to not seem to them they just
[1:08:44] go and I cannot show you right a few
[1:08:46] days after they were back doing the same
[1:08:48] things again back doing the same things
[1:08:52] again and just hoping that next year
[1:08:55] we'll go again and put a handle it was
[1:08:57] almost like a license to the scene there
[1:09:02] was no real labor and effort to like
[1:09:04] steal the tool that's why Israel so many
[1:09:08] times so many times
[1:09:10] Israel pursuing title Israel sinned
[1:09:13] Israel ditched off when Coe will punish
[1:09:16] them right after they'll go back again
[1:09:18] because the blood of bulls and goats did
[1:09:21] not have power to take over to take
[1:09:22] helsing and so their men perpetually
[1:09:25] sinners can you say man thus I was in
[1:09:30] the Old Testament years and anybody and
[1:09:33] everybody knew this cannot be the
[1:09:35] prophet pattern no it can be this was
[1:09:38] just a substitute amen to just show they
[1:09:41] had a clear conscience they don't want
[1:09:43] to do wrong and go in Chris forgive them
[1:09:45] that's how it was amen on to the Lamb of
[1:09:48] God Jesus Christ came but why Israel Wow
[1:09:52] will they not be able to do even though
[1:09:57] they know what is the right thing to do
[1:09:58] why don't they do the right thing what I
[1:10:02] want you and I to the right and even
[1:10:03] though we know they were thing to do
[1:10:05] that's why the talking come class while
[1:10:08] the talking come behold the lamb of God
[1:10:10] who takes away the scene of the wall it
[1:10:13] comes to you today comes to you tomorrow
[1:10:15] come see wherever you are to take care
[1:10:17] of the same problem I'm not talking
[1:10:20] about being the message I'm talking
[1:10:21] about the same problem
[1:10:23] Carroll because Israel knew what was the
[1:10:27] right to do but they could not do it so
[1:10:30] it's not it is not knowing the right
[1:10:32] thing to do
[1:10:33] it is not knowing the message is the
[1:10:36] power to leave about the scene that's
[1:10:41] what we are talking about that's what
[1:10:42] the talking is about the supraorbital
[1:10:44] preach Redemption by blood and by power
[1:10:48] oh you know why Israel could not even
[1:11:03] though the new could not leave above the
[1:11:05] wrong and they say you know why the
[1:11:07] emotions the emotions università for
[1:11:13] image crumb cake thank you I know you're
[1:11:25] trying to make me feel good you are very
[1:11:27] kind of very lovely
[1:11:34] all right just bear with me my you know
[1:11:41] but but I want to show you why Israel
[1:11:47] the new water I need to do and they
[1:11:50] still won't do the right thing you know
[1:11:52] when the man fell in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:53] the Bible said ah nothing but regret
[1:11:56] over the deal if somebody mention it but
[1:11:58] Adam knew what was right Adam wasn't
[1:12:01] deceived Adam noon and the same way many
[1:12:04] times we were not deceived when you're
[1:12:06] doing wrong
[1:12:07] you know that can I get a witness can I
[1:12:10] get a witness Adam wasn't received Eve
[1:12:21] was beguiled the see but Adam was not
[1:12:23] deceived so what happened emotions
[1:12:32] emotions the next slide please next
[1:12:38] picture all right
[1:12:45] forgive me I did a few years of medical
[1:12:47] school so you gotta forgive me I'm an ex
[1:12:54] doctor don't tell me I have a headache
[1:12:59] watch it I have a headache
[1:13:00] drink some what a lot of water or
[1:13:03] something I mean forget it now
[1:13:05] forgetting all of America has to cool
[1:13:06] stuff I forgot me
[1:13:07] I wasn't in Goodson in school anyway so
[1:13:09] - leave it for so many years together
[1:13:11] forgotten
[1:13:12] - forgive this now Israel like you and I
[1:13:19] human beings don't make easier they're
[1:13:22] very rebellious just like you and I are
[1:13:24] very rebellious and that's what the
[1:13:25] token each one knew was what to do and
[1:13:30] even do the right thing when Adam sinned
[1:13:33] Genesis 3 oh I didn't get my conduct
[1:13:35] creatures but when Adam sinned and
[1:13:38] either sin and the fair and God drove
[1:13:41] them out of the garden God said God said
[1:13:44] now that the man has become like one of
[1:13:47] us knowing good and evil
[1:13:53] let's drag him out so he won't take his
[1:13:56] him and totally of life and live forever
[1:13:59] and then the Bible says for eternal
[1:14:02] roaring do testament to his that nor to
[1:14:05] do good and to I did not dream in the
[1:14:08] scene can somebody give me an amen
[1:14:12] no you didn't hear me you did not hear
[1:14:14] me no he did not hear me
[1:14:16] God sent Adam out because he has become
[1:14:19] like one of us they are pleased to be
[1:14:22] like God is to know good and evil like
[1:14:26] God looks upon the earth it is the scene
[1:14:28] it is the wrong is this the fitness but
[1:14:31] doesn't kill who is he still does good
[1:14:33] all the time but landed the money come
[1:14:36] like one of us and he knows the man
[1:14:37] doesn't have the capacity to do good all
[1:14:40] the time like that and just straight his
[1:14:43] head in his bullet instead to the tree
[1:14:45] of life and live forever don't drop him
[1:14:48] out
[1:14:52] these were only shown improve the Adams
[1:14:56] children turn by the same atomic nature
[1:14:59] that the fall brought in knowing good
[1:15:03] and evil but no ability no power no no
[1:15:07] no no no where we fell to shun the wrong
[1:15:12] and to the right not just Israel to use
[1:15:15] in the same spot today amen already
[1:15:21] talking about the talking but delay one
[1:15:26] my lot about husband wife and you know
[1:15:29] your family try to get I mean I'm gonna
[1:15:32] see along there but I want to focus on
[1:15:34] you on you to make sure that the talking
[1:15:38] really is significant your life our
[1:15:46] emotions nobody teaches us how to manage
[1:15:50] them how to take care of them how to
[1:15:53] recognize them how to overcome them how
[1:15:56] to dominate them nobody did you sense
[1:15:58] that we're gonna screw Berlin all the
[1:16:00] MBAs do all the things I'm gonna go into
[1:16:02] the workforce going to life nobody
[1:16:05] teaches how to a hand let me turn on in
[1:16:06] German in school and many times on at
[1:16:08] home either but the Bible says Bible
[1:16:14] says Paul Romans seven that lovely bit
[1:16:20] about Paul Roman seven where was he was
[1:16:22] he saying it or not still know that I'll
[1:16:23] answer that question for you
[1:16:29] Paul said what I would I would not when
[1:16:36] could is present with me when I wanted
[1:16:38] to good evil is very present what's
[1:16:41] wrong with me who shall deliver me from
[1:16:44] the body of this death who shall deliver
[1:16:48] me Paul cried out the great Apostle Paul
[1:16:51] but we make like Norma me I'm overcoming
[1:16:54] I'm overcoming I'm overcoming lie
[1:16:57] many times sly norther when overcoming
[1:17:04] what by the bantha is the little silly
[1:17:06] fun tone those are things of eternal
[1:17:08] destination Booya
[1:17:15] wait Ryan bean and I see the head let
[1:17:21] you know all the senses of the body see
[1:17:27] smell taste hear feel or touch whether
[1:17:35] you recognize it or not when you see or
[1:17:37] feel or hear what happens they're sent
[1:17:41] into your body by what they call
[1:17:44] electrical impulses going to your body
[1:17:46] your body don't your body that's why you
[1:17:48] can't see my electric show because your
[1:17:50] body's like an electric city station so
[1:17:53] you can receive a shot because it get
[1:17:54] connected and you get shocked so when
[1:17:59] you see all your feelings what you see
[1:18:02] is a feeling when we talks filaments
[1:18:05] everything's just the touch no it's
[1:18:07] beyond the torch what you see what you
[1:18:12] smell
[1:18:13] if you smell good food it's a feeling if
[1:18:16] it tastes that sponge cake mMmmm it's
[1:18:20] the feeling that's right
[1:18:24] if you have a sound like brand lares
[1:18:28] causing you know boundary like a six or
[1:18:31] something I had a push out is a feeling
[1:18:35] and every feeling what happens a pass
[1:18:39] through your body and go is going to the
[1:18:41] brain is headed for your frontal lobe
[1:18:43] right behind your forehead that's where
[1:18:46] all of the signals are interpreted I'm
[1:18:51] sorry Lou science labs right
[1:18:54] you know senseless but he's okay all
[1:19:05] right why do you do this to me so
[1:19:08] because you took it away like the Megan
[1:19:10] see the delay take it away
[1:19:12] Anya took their way so but delicious
[1:19:20] right for these signs one zero one class
[1:19:22] this morning so when the things they
[1:19:25] enter this is your spinal cord they call
[1:19:28] ranchers man code and enter through the
[1:19:29] base of your brain they're headed for
[1:19:32] the frontal lobe where you can think and
[1:19:35] this feeling is like smell
[1:19:37] well this flame is like a torch this
[1:19:40] feeling like a dish this is what I'm
[1:19:41] hearing
[1:19:42] are you with me all that is can trust in
[1:19:45] the period here in the frontal lobe but
[1:19:48] here's the problem I read this Jesus
[1:19:52] even that any much will generate by man
[1:19:54] because he knew all men and he knew also
[1:19:58] what was a man like this he made us
[1:20:03] equally knows he knows what we're made
[1:20:05] of he knows how we are wired consumerism
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:21] so all these sensations and feelings I
[1:20:26] had a frontal lobe to interpret them he
[1:20:31] has the problem they have to pass
[1:20:33] through what they call the limbic system
[1:20:36] where your feelings take place where
[1:20:39] emotionless ticklish that were really
[1:20:42] should issue emotions why emotions take
[1:20:44] place so splittsboro Lawrence hey and
[1:20:52] that sound comes to him as a feeling and
[1:20:55] it goes through his spinal cord base of
[1:20:57] his brain and before I guess the frontal
[1:21:00] lobe like that over the always talking
[1:21:02] to me for my own good it goes with
[1:21:04] emotions look at how I shouted at me
[1:21:07] Cheryl I mean I feel bad and you took
[1:21:13] back what she shot at me like that
[1:21:15] weight added to you La Perla telecine
[1:21:20] yesterday husband gets home wife gets
[1:21:22] home watch this honey
[1:21:25] great well the process in it by you it
[1:21:32] comes here enters here emotions rather
[1:21:35] and so what
[1:21:40] yes I had it so so
[1:21:52] later later this office business splits
[1:21:56] the confidence in my field my wife is
[1:21:59] just trying to compliment me too we know
[1:22:02] how we are we do the action first stupid
[1:22:07] irresponsible and then we think later
[1:22:12] that's who we know that's who you are me
[1:22:15] I'm not like that that is who you are
[1:22:17] that's how you are wired can you say
[1:22:21] Amen I'm almost done seriously I'm
[1:22:36] almost done so we are wired to react
[1:22:48] before we think our emotions just
[1:22:51] reacted before we think I know what
[1:22:55] that's how animals are because the
[1:22:57] animal only has the brain don't have a
[1:23:01] soul I must have a brain and their
[1:23:04] thinking center is very primitive but
[1:23:08] animals are based on especially the most
[1:23:10] well two human beings the chimpanzees
[1:23:12] and all that they are like people who
[1:23:14] study mama
[1:23:15] I mean primal behavior knows our brains
[1:23:17] that fashion the same way this primitive
[1:23:20] brain here is all about your emotions
[1:23:22] your feelings and unfortunately for us
[1:23:25] we are wired to respond by emotion
[1:23:29] before we even think and that's where is
[1:23:31] the problem that is the problem it's
[1:23:35] your problem my problem is a human
[1:23:38] problem it is not just your watch
[1:23:40] problem is your problem to you he's not
[1:23:43] your husband swap it's your problems you
[1:23:44] and when it gets this put here you don't
[1:23:47] care who else has the problem you see
[1:23:49] Lord I have a problem I want my problem
[1:23:52] solved
[1:23:54] remain so we have come to the great
[1:24:02] convention applying the talking that's
[1:24:06] the event a message and we know all
[1:24:08] these things but that's here that's here
[1:24:11] the frontal lobe so won't we leave here
[1:24:14] tomorrow morning and we go home we think
[1:24:17] automatically we're going to stop doing
[1:24:20] the things no no I'm not going to pour
[1:24:27] cold water on your excitement just
[1:24:31] trying to tell you the truth because the
[1:24:38] same session would happen exactly it's
[1:24:40] just a hotel her husband and that
[1:24:42] emotions care of him while he's reacting
[1:24:43] he's thinking right a will at the action
[1:24:45] between this but he just can't stop
[1:24:50] himself so that's our problem there
[1:24:57] that's the problem right there before
[1:25:04] the ticket of just take a look at it for
[1:25:05] image
[1:25:11] crumb cake class right just be ready for
[1:25:14] a few minutes and just think about you
[1:25:17] all the things you've read in this
[1:25:19] meeting here the boy speaking to you
[1:25:21] like that
[1:25:21] son daughter you're gonna make you got
[1:25:23] to make amends here you gonna change
[1:25:24] here this here he's gonna stand in the
[1:25:33] way
[1:25:34] amen Thank You brothers so God knew all
[1:25:43] of this can do that and that's why you
[1:25:47] know men will hardly ever be able to
[1:25:55] live by the commandments of God on their
[1:25:59] own because of the way they are
[1:26:01] structured because of the way they are
[1:26:03] made and that's why he will let them
[1:26:08] come every year I wouldn't tell them why
[1:26:11] did you listen again why didn't I listen
[1:26:12] again because you know that's just how
[1:26:14] they are structured is waiting for the
[1:26:16] time when the Lamb of God who's gonna
[1:26:19] take away the sin is gonna solve for you
[1:26:23] this problem the Lamb of God will solve
[1:26:27] for you this problem can you say Amen
[1:26:31] and he has already solved our problem ma
[1:26:50] amen so what he got do what he got do
[1:26:56] what he got you God in the beginning
[1:27:02] when he made Adam and Eve he knew right
[1:27:06] away that this year he's gonna make them
[1:27:10] have a pram with even keeping the word
[1:27:13] so what he did they had a control center
[1:27:17] outside of the brain a control center
[1:27:21] which is an S soul like the king when he
[1:27:26] speaks these ones will ran up when he
[1:27:34] speaks emotions Lana when he speaks
[1:27:38] feelings manner when he speaks reason
[1:27:41] lines up so God you made money 3 for Ben
[1:27:56] let me have this frosted picture back
[1:27:58] again I'm in the soul of man he put the
[1:28:08] control center you know was this the
[1:28:10] person that I put there we each know the
[1:28:12] story already God before the foundation
[1:28:14] of the world and all of that I don't
[1:28:16] want to go over that because you know
[1:28:17] that but God you put your seed which is
[1:28:22] the person of himself which is your
[1:28:24] connection with God they put that seed
[1:28:27] in the soul
[1:28:32] and let's see I don't wish that all the
[1:28:35] time but a sheet is what will bring from
[1:28:37] the miracle hallelujah is not a sin like
[1:28:41] your mango seed is a sin of God and
[1:28:45] everything is in that seed and that seed
[1:28:48] will bring for his own kind and it's got
[1:28:52] seed it will people of God's kind and
[1:28:54] whatever you are supposed to be is
[1:28:57] already in that seed so what happens
[1:29:14] what happens the feelings come into your
[1:29:23] body dry motions we want to react the
[1:29:27] control center in the soul tells it no
[1:29:30] don't do that
[1:29:31] these are split-second things but that's
[1:29:34] exactly what happens that's what a
[1:29:36] Christians behavior is different
[1:29:38] that's why Christian dozens you can't
[1:29:40] even explain yourself because the sinner
[1:29:42] power remains in you the sinner God the
[1:29:46] sinner God contains every bad behavior
[1:29:49] until every part habits let me redo some
[1:29:55] things let me do some things in here
[1:30:00] memory some things here but the promise
[1:30:07] said intellectually we're hearing the
[1:30:12] message and intellectually we have heard
[1:30:15] all these things here not because we're
[1:30:17] the lecturers no it simply means by our
[1:30:19] brains we understand these things but
[1:30:22] don't let the devil fool you but because
[1:30:26] you are understand actually is automatic
[1:30:28] you will do them because your emotions
[1:30:30] are gonna stand in the way
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:34] Oh glory let me read you this go for
[1:30:44] mother banner I'm almost done when I say
[1:30:48] I'm almost in that means that I've got
[1:30:49] about one foot of the way thank you for
[1:30:57] your kind of understanding all right so
[1:31:03] that's right that's two three quarters I
[1:31:04] have from the deli once after what is
[1:31:06] the message of the hour it's not message
[1:31:11] message of the minutes measure the hour
[1:31:12] so I should do at least an hour but
[1:31:16] Peter I gotta come to your school I can
[1:31:18] two of us in 45 minutes with two minutes
[1:31:20] I say man is like gurantee playing games
[1:31:24] all right great run oh ho chi long are
[1:31:28] you following me all right let me just
[1:31:31] read this good here intellectually we
[1:31:34] have fought we're hearing the message
[1:31:35] but the Branum said here
[1:31:37] Amazing Grace this is from God's brave
[1:31:40] little warship polypropylene is our
[1:31:42] washing he said Amazing Grace how sweet
[1:31:44] the sound see just know we're ever
[1:31:47] explain what it is just take my word if
[1:31:49] you believe me he was talking about you
[1:31:51] know put me on the cotton of time be
[1:31:53] sure to make sure upon every breach of
[1:31:55] the wall behind you I believe the church
[1:31:59] is begin to hear the message and begin
[1:32:02] to understand it people say we don't
[1:32:06] have to understand it's true in other
[1:32:09] words you don't have to do intellectual
[1:32:11] honest time to do it that's right but
[1:32:13] the Holy Spirit gives you some little
[1:32:14] understanding that will help you along
[1:32:16] the way but truly we don't have to
[1:32:18] understand like you explained by your
[1:32:20] intellect and all that but it's not a
[1:32:23] chore to be to understand the message
[1:32:25] but friends listen but you're on your
[1:32:28] intellectually
[1:32:29] understanding we've got to lay in the
[1:32:32] prints of a song we've gotta be ripened
[1:32:35] our faith even after you read all these
[1:32:38] glorious things this weekend our faith
[1:32:40] isn't a rapper yet intellectually we're
[1:32:45] here in the message
[1:32:47] God has given us and seen the science
[1:32:49] that is showed us
[1:32:50] I'm proving it by the pebble is there
[1:32:53] but all how the chat needs to lay in the
[1:32:57] presence and it's presently ten days of
[1:33:00] you know and gets within the spirit to
[1:33:03] come beat down sometimes in speaking the
[1:33:05] message you get hash you'll get hash and
[1:33:10] that limbic system emotions and say like
[1:33:12] what are they talking to me like that
[1:33:13] doesn't say that you know it's my good
[1:33:16] it's the message it's the talk in
[1:33:21] sometimes with the message you can hash
[1:33:28] you have to break in like that because
[1:33:31] you've got to clinch and nail to make it
[1:33:33] home but well when the chat once gets it
[1:33:36] the locker is called out and separated
[1:33:40] then in the presence of God I know it
[1:33:42] means something like oh people was there
[1:33:43] when it takes its rapture so let's have
[1:33:47] the talking deal with this problem for
[1:33:50] all put emotions in its place so that
[1:33:54] would be you know after what we know so
[1:33:55] that we will not be found sinful because
[1:33:59] it he that knows what to do and to a did
[1:34:01] not is not iniquity the Browse it to him
[1:34:03] it is seen that's why other was driven
[1:34:07] are they got a villain and we are not
[1:34:08] going to go back to Eden doing the same
[1:34:10] thing learn what's right and not to in
[1:34:13] it expect to go back to even that's why
[1:34:16] the talkin share the Lamb of God that
[1:34:19] takes away all the scene of the world
[1:34:22] Oh hallelujah it will take your every
[1:34:27] problem he will deliver every package or
[1:34:30] it'll caught
[1:34:34] many men all right now I emotions and
[1:34:47] sickness is a big issue because we rise
[1:34:51] and fall on the ability to control our
[1:34:55] emotions what was in first Romans seven
[1:35:00] the motions of sin is the emotions of
[1:35:03] sin most every sin that you and I to our
[1:35:08] emotions make us do it so they can learn
[1:35:14] to master and control our emotions we
[1:35:19] will live much better than many of us
[1:35:22] are living even though we know the
[1:35:23] message we know what better plan I'm set
[1:35:25] to do we know love your brother love
[1:35:27] your sister we know all of these things
[1:35:29] don't make more young people know go to

[1:36:07] controlled by these emotions we explain
[1:36:10] them away we justify them sure the
[1:36:14] reason why we act before we think and
[1:36:16] because of our ego because of our pride
[1:36:19] even when we have caught ourselves that
[1:36:22] what we did or said or or acted is wrong
[1:36:25] we will not say I am sorry

[1:44:16] only just live your life you look back
[1:44:23] 10 20 30 years just regrets like that
[1:44:26] Jim
[1:44:29] each of these emotions the limbic system
[1:44:33] or some day even when you know that's
[1:44:39] what was bomb said when the humanistic
[1:44:40] realm just walking by the deepest of
[1:44:42] your mind you can make real progress as
[1:44:45] a Christian you were like any other man
[1:44:47] as man you are like an animal
[1:44:48] because animals only listen from this
[1:44:51] year they live from this year that's
[1:44:53] that's what you were like Amen glory to
[1:45:00] God amen
[1:45:02] and slip by emotions you can see right
[1:45:06] away
[1:45:07] emotions can be a very very destructive
[1:45:10] force are you can see in the fall in the
[1:45:14] for what happened sitting him to Eve
[1:45:18] have God said so sure what I said you
[1:45:22] shall not she's quoting from her frontal
[1:45:27] lobe what she need to be the right thing
[1:45:28] and she was right and the devil knew the
[1:45:32] Bible said but the venom said the
[1:45:34] serpent man he understood the principles
[1:45:36] of life
[1:45:38] he understood the principles of life he
[1:45:42] knew a prince that close to that's why
[1:45:44] you just a friend
[1:45:46] it was on his feet like a chimpanzee
[1:45:48] they're driven by the emotions and most
[1:45:51] our brains are close to that so what did
[1:45:54] he do to get her to drop what she knew
[1:45:57] God said what'd he do he said you shall
[1:46:00] not surely die you said no I shall die
[1:46:03] so he took it to her eyes and when she
[1:46:07] saw that the fruit the tree was Pooja
[1:46:13] and to make one wise have feelings she
[1:46:20] saw it she smelt it it put his help on
[1:46:24] her it felt good
[1:46:27] he felt it felt good so she began to
[1:46:31] sitting here this was good she was good
[1:46:33] disconnecting her from what she knew to
[1:46:36] be what God said disconnecting her
[1:46:39] disconnecting her
[1:46:40] and the Bible said when she tasted so it
[1:46:45] was a fruit to make one wise she took of
[1:46:48] it clean her mouth and give to a husband
[1:46:54] with her and that's how Cain and Abel
[1:46:59] came forth our parents who came straight
[1:47:03] from God could not beat this pathway and
[1:47:08] the devil knew that make them slaves to
[1:47:13] their emotions make them round up to the
[1:47:17] emotions and with any time so
[1:47:21] intellectually we had a message it's not
[1:47:23] enough there is not enough just too many
[1:47:27] things you and I know is right to do and
[1:47:30] yet we will not do it because of our
[1:47:34] emotions can somebody say
[1:47:37] Oh hallelujah
[1:47:42] God amen amen amen
[1:47:46] Oh glory all right I'm skipping all this
[1:47:52] here amen
[1:47:55] so what are we here in this convention
[1:48:00] for we're here in this convention to
[1:48:05] meet the Lamb of God who takes away the
[1:48:08] sin of the world in other words he gets
[1:48:12] seen at it's very roots no sins those
[1:48:15] that just those that just a small
[1:48:17] characteristics of sin to get at his
[1:48:20] various and I'm telling you the very
[1:48:22] roots of it but Jesus knew all men here
[1:48:26] know what sin man they knows why they
[1:48:28] are acting the way they're acting where
[1:48:30] they are and where they are reacting
[1:48:31] where you understand these things you
[1:48:33] don't understand why your wife can't get
[1:48:34] angry when there's no need for anger why
[1:48:37] your husband can be mad I mean when
[1:48:39] there's no need for it you know what's
[1:48:41] going on you know why your husband has
[1:48:44] been mean nasty the way he's or your son
[1:48:47] is just crazy the ways you understand
[1:48:49] those things because you understand
[1:48:50] these things here can you say Amen let
[1:49:01] me review in France at you from Romans 7
[1:49:09] Paul said verse 4 wherefore my brethren
[1:49:13] you also have become dead to the law by
[1:49:15] the body of Christ
[1:49:17] there should be married to another even
[1:49:19] to him who is raised from the dead that
[1:49:21] we should bring forth fruit unto God for
[1:49:23] when we were in the flesh humanistic the
[1:49:29] motions of scenes which were by the law
[1:49:32] did walk in our members to bring forth
[1:49:35] fruit unto death but now we are
[1:49:38] delivered from the law that being dead
[1:49:42] where we were held that we should serve
[1:49:44] in newness of spirit along the ordinance
[1:49:47] of the letter let me tell you here
[1:49:48] we know those we know that Peter Peter
[1:49:55] the great Apostle Peter who would
[1:49:58] mention that Alesana many now are the
[1:50:01] christ the son of living and i just
[1:50:04] given the keys you should have the keys
[1:50:05] of the kingdom peter knew you know he
[1:50:08] had a revelation so is not it not to
[1:50:10] have a revelation a revelation is not
[1:50:13] enough because with cheapen I have a
[1:50:16] revelation and they will leave anyhow
[1:50:19] the talking is coming and calling me
[1:50:21] halt to all of them Peter had a
[1:50:26] revelation but what did you Jesus want
[1:50:32] him
[1:50:33] Jordan a mystery transmitter he said not
[1:50:35] me me and when the battle came to it
[1:50:39] Peter denied the Lord three times he
[1:50:41] cursed he denied Christ you talk about
[1:50:44] Christ in the third person
[1:50:45] I don't know that man when Peter came
[1:50:50] face-to-face with death these emotions
[1:50:53] fear gripped him and what he knew he had
[1:50:56] been warned what in you
[1:50:57] he pushed aside said no no I'm not to
[1:51:00] die yet that man I don't know him and
[1:51:02] yet we have the keys
[1:51:05] you have the keys to the kingdom so
[1:51:08] don't tell me I have a revelation it is

[2:10:25] Book of Life when the regular section
[2:10:28] angels represented our spirits we every
[2:10:31] one of them and the one who see became
[2:10:34] there were those who fail and this group
[2:10:37] here involved the foolish virgins
[2:10:43] involve the bottom line believers and
[2:10:46] foolish virgins very coasters and all
[2:10:49] those people who were not given the
[2:10:51] question coming to the message of the
[2:10:53] hour in the age have you ever wondered
[2:10:55] why they receive the Word of God while
[2:10:59] they can respond to the gospel because
[2:11:01] there's a space in there like Pilate Lee
[2:11:04] I think you say about science founded in
[2:11:08] the heart there's a space the soul of
[2:11:11] man and in the so there's a space to
[2:11:14] receive the Word of God that's where
[2:11:17] your seat is at and the series the Word
[2:11:20] of God but if they don't have a seat
[2:11:23] like they are not in the bride in the
[2:11:25] age they have that space there they can
[2:11:29] receive the Word of God but as it
[2:11:31] doesn't remain thus it doesn't remain in
[2:11:34] other words they can go all the way with
[2:11:39] a fool
[2:11:40] God they can receive a portion hey
[2:11:43] partially a person a person there that's
[2:11:45] not the Citadel remaining remaining to
[2:11:48] remain all the way to the very end
[2:11:51] hallelujah for you
[2:11:55] the see decorum means in you Oh
[2:11:58] hallelujah hallelujah and because the
[2:12:04] City of God is in you today that's why
[2:12:06] you'll know you will overcome every
[2:12:07] temple because you got a promise in
[2:12:10] prison I will bless thee and in
[2:12:12] multiplying I will multiply thy seed and
[2:12:16] thy seed shall possess every king of the
[2:12:20] enemy every gate every kitchen they care
[2:12:24] of your emotions together of your human
[2:12:27] reasoning you know filthiness sex of
[2:12:29] godliness your seed shall possess it
[2:12:32] hallelujah because they love governments
[2:12:35] in you and you shall not seen seen shall
[2:12:38] have no dominion over your glory to call
[2:12:42] a man Oh hallelujah glory to God and so
[2:12:56] when Adam sinned and God declared lamb
[2:13:00] in Eden and Adam reached back his
[2:13:06] fellowship reach the back eternal life
[2:13:07] and drove him out if I was we stop back
[2:13:10] in flesh with God what an lamb was
[2:13:12] declared when grunting presently the
[2:13:15] libros is on the scene
[2:13:19] [Applause]
[2:13:21] when the credit lamb in Israel the
[2:13:24] talking deliverance was on the scene as
[2:13:27] well as George Minjae when he drove Adam
[2:13:35] out I've said this so many times but let
[2:13:37] me go sister a picture number three and
[2:13:39] I'm don't glory laughing this is
[2:13:50] beautiful I wish like men about to eat
[2:13:51] in the Bible said when he drove Adam out
[2:14:00] of you didn't I say declared lamb there
[2:14:03] you drove out I'm out
[2:14:05] if you see the story of your Redemption
[2:14:08] when he drove Adam out the Bible said he
[2:14:11] planted a garden eastward in Eden so
[2:14:13] this walkin is on the eastern part of
[2:14:15] Eden right I'm waiting to Adam out so
[2:14:20] that Adam will not touch the tree of
[2:14:22] life again what he did he put kilims on
[2:14:26] the eastern part of Eden the the Gann
[2:14:30] was interest part of Eden the to develop
[2:14:32] was in the middle of the garden on the
[2:14:34] eastern part of Eden and the eastern
[2:14:35] part is like the backside I damaged it
[2:14:41] all the time
[2:14:44] this Bible here you know you know he's a
[2:14:46] book of symbols the book of life that
[2:14:49] she of life and if it have the Bible
[2:14:53] this way this part here is it northern
[2:14:56] that this Puryear is a sound path this
[2:14:59] front part here is the Western map this
[2:15:02] back part here is the instant match
[2:15:04] so this Caribbeans were on the eastern
[2:15:07] pat on the back pad or The Tree of Life
[2:15:12] on the eastern part of Eden those things
[2:15:16] mean something and I put Cara babies
[2:15:20] there with a flaming sword to make sure
[2:15:23] they drove Adam out and make sure Adam
[2:15:26] will not come back to that tree of life
[2:15:39] and I McDermott eyes you can see Adam
[2:15:41] walking away and God looking at his son
[2:15:45] walking away he had no uncle to go to
[2:15:48] no auntie to go to no friend he was the
[2:15:51] only man on the face of the earth and
[2:15:53] his wife have you ever thought of that
[2:15:55] was they launched some war for Adam but
[2:15:58] he had sinned and sin has its
[2:16:00] consequences young people see in the
[2:16:02] house consequences and God drove him out
[2:16:06] too many times we want a lot more than
[2:16:10] God loves let me leave that alone
[2:16:17] so God Adam was gonna solve those
[2:16:21] Carrigan's the flaming sword I knew he
[2:16:25] couldn't strike for his hand to the Tree
[2:16:27] of Life that's the place that's the
[2:16:31] place where that book because it shared
[2:16:33] life was it was the life the Adam has
[2:16:37] open access to the book of redemption
[2:16:40] the bucola was open to him he had open
[2:16:43] access and this is where the book became
[2:16:44] closed and went back to the hands of
[2:16:47] original owner right here right here the
[2:16:51] flaming sword throw them out and seal
[2:16:54] the book on his back pad by the Cubans
[2:16:58] kerubim out you went back out Cara beams
[2:17:16] if you go through the Bible nothing
[2:17:19] about this book of symbols go through
[2:17:20] the Babel one of these cannibals
[2:17:24] cherubims eastward you know the flaming
[2:17:27] sword and the lamb was there and the
[2:17:32] book went back to the hands of original
[2:17:34] owner God the Lamb of God himself
[2:17:41] and you'll see down through the Bible
[2:17:44] this book got opened
[2:17:46] temporarily many times Elijah quite a
[2:17:48] Lord I'm the only one God temporarily
[2:17:50] open the books Elijah and he saw there
[2:17:53] were seven thousand names under the seal
[2:17:55] of life who are not bad on to Bill and
[2:17:58] could open the book at answer that but
[2:18:00] the book was sealed closed because of
[2:18:02] the key Robbins the major sinful man
[2:18:05] will not get this Tree of Life
[2:18:11] who are these Robbins
[2:18:13] I mean this of therefore this comes only
[2:18:16] through the Bible Ezekiel one in
[2:18:18] particular shows you these cupboards
[2:18:19] that got the throne of God that God is
[2:18:22] one of God so there were four killings
[2:18:30] it called them beasts cherubims it good
[2:18:34] revelation five you see the throne of
[2:18:37] God running through your Bible you'll
[2:18:38] see therefore these skill beams are for
[2:18:41] guarding the throne of God run about the
[2:18:44] throne of God my mom taught us who those
[2:18:47] kingdoms were thanks amen glory know
[2:18:55] when you're getting the book of
[2:18:57] Revelation now you see the book in the
[2:19:00] right hand of the order see it on the
[2:19:03] backside with seven seals on the
[2:19:07] backside is the book of symbols those
[2:19:09] are those four key ribbons on the
[2:19:10] backside because but the Panem said
[2:19:12] those four kilograms represent the four
[2:19:14] anointings through the seven churches a
[2:19:17] lawyer I said that allowing anointing
[2:19:20] the office anointed a man anointed and
[2:19:22] the equal anointing on the backside of
[2:19:24] the book seven straps on the back of the
[2:19:28] book for anointings put several straps
[2:19:31] on the back of the book
[2:19:37] and those sevens trust made sure man
[2:19:40] cannot get into this book
[2:19:41] but the Brahms I want you those terms
[2:19:43] are broken you cannot get into this book
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:19:52] [Applause]
[2:19:54] and then when you see revelation 5 right
[2:20:02] from the Ganymede and the crabbing going
[2:20:06] forth for redemption claims who is
[2:20:09] worthy to take the book and to loose the
[2:20:14] seven seals thereof in other words who
[2:20:16] is worthy to go past these Kirra beams
[2:20:18] and take us back the Tree of Life they
[2:20:20] might have eternal life and sonship
[2:20:23] Authority but on the face of the earth
[2:20:25] again who is wanted to do it who is
[2:20:27] wanted to go past Oh square rooms you
[2:20:29] know you and I cannot do it you know we
