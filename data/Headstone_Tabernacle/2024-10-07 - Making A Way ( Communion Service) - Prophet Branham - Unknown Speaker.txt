God bless you amen so the whole world has become our Parish am the whole world and we are his servant so let us just remember friends that this may be the last night this may be the last year or maybe the last generation see we don't know but anyhow we do know this of a fact that the living know they have to die it is once the point under man to death and after that the judgment and if there be any here tonight who isn't ready to meet that and has not this blessed hope may this be the night that you'll decide for the Lord Jesus once for All For Eternity now shall we pray our heavenly father we want to thank thee from the very depths of our hearts knowing that we are waiting here not flustrated at all no matter how many atomic bombs they make and how many civil service people they put out to watch the PLS the world nervous and shaky we are resting upon this blessed hope that we had we're trusting in the finished work of God at Calvary through Christ knowing this that after this Earthly Tabernacle is no more we got one already waiting under more glorious far more where there's no pain or suffering sickness no old age will ever strike it never a gray hair hey never wrinkle but will be young there forever the Blessed Bible which cannot tell nothing but the truth as give us this Blessed assurance and the Holy Ghost also is a witness bearing record of the same our hearts long for that and we know the Bible tells us so which is the word of God the seeds to be planted upon this fertile ground to let us rest in this hope God I pray that you will touch every person tonight outside of Christ and bring them to this close marvelous walk heal the sick sitting here tonight Lord no doubt this many people there's bound to be sickness in the midst of us and we pray that you'll heal everyone now come to the word father take the word which is a Lifeline the Grassroots Lord of all civilization we pray that the holy spirit will take each word and give it to the heart just as we have need may we Fellowship around the word far we ask it in Jesus name amen for a little reading of the scriptures tonight for just a a little text to try to hunt a context and be swiftly right to the word so we can have the communion tomorrow being Monday I know we don't like to think of those things of having to go back to work but we have to face that and many times you know but after all this is more essential in jobs and everything else or your job will play out someday and you'll play out with it but if you got eternal life you'll never have an end it's Eternal amen Liv on Perpetual think of it a Perpetual life has no end on aons of time has passed on by we'll still be there oh and the millions of years Roll by we still be there so just for a few days here on Earth jobs doesn't amount to so much just to help us along buy our little food and so forth eat which we have to have it now in First Corinthians the 10th chapter beginning with the 12th verse therefore let him that thanketh he stand take he lest he falls there has no temptation taken you but such is common to man but God is faithful who is not who who willing that you not to suffer you to be tempted above as which you're able but with every Temptation also make a way of Escape that we may be able to Bear it what a beautiful verse may the Lord at his Blessing blings to that making a way would be what I'd like to speak on tonight you know may add his Blessing to his word as we listen now to the word it's my opinion that if the word which is the Grassroots which is the thing that takes hold many times in my healing Services I I try to even after the teachers is already went through it all I try to come back and and take the word and lay a foundation a few nights ago I got a little letter of criticism which was fine a man told me he said brother brandom you're just a boy yet said I was preaching the gospel before you was born and he said I all my 46 years but yet he he was a teacher of some Bible school he said but a a man that of your kind that teaches people and yet would make a remark that you made the other night said I think it's ridiculous said you said that the devil didn't have no power to heal he said perhaps what if I tell you that the devil has got power to heal said now you'd ask me if you were standing present why I know said I'll tell you said in our town There's a woman lives there which has a a bad spirit and she people comes to her for healing says she'll pull hair out of their head and she'll pluck blood from their veins and wrap it up in his hair walk down to the river and cast this thing over her shoulder and not look back if she looks back said then the disease remains with the person but she has to throw to the river like his forgetfulness and walk away and said 60% of the people we kept count are healed so not if the devil can't heal what about that so I answered him I said my kind beloved brother with all due regards to your years see all due regards to your years of teaching but I'll tell you now that Jesus Christ said that the devil has no power to heal and if Jesus said it that settles it with me he said if Satan cast out Satan then his kingdoms divided and it has an end and he cannot cast out Satan and you'd ask me why was these people healed why it's not the person the witch had nothing to do with it no more than I'd have to do than any other man it's the people that's approaching thinking that they're coming God's provided Way for their healing it's their individual faith and God that does the healing see that's the approach that they think it isn't the witch or no more than it would be the man so therefore the gospel can only maneuver or it can can only reach out as the word of God is taught and man base their hopes upon God's Eternal Word Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word amen Dr Ada here in the city my beloved friend said to me one day he said Billy don't you think if people had Faith to touch the tree out there you get the same results I said how could you have faith in that if you could have the equal amount of faith believing that it was God's provided way for you to touch the tree and it would do then they could do it but who's got faith in the tree I got faith in what God Said and I just take that so Faith isn't built up on the Shi and Sands of of emotional uh conceptions but faith is built upon the standard God's Eternal Word the Rock of Ages there's where Faith they solemn resting place and never moves amen when it's built right there now making a way I don't believe that God ever run his offices the haphazard way I I wouldn't run mine you wouldn't run yours Jesus didn't die at Calvary just to say well now maybe people feel sorry for me that I come go to Earth and take on the farm of Flesh and they'll really get saved maybe if they see how pitifully I die God didn't do that Jesus died for one purpose and that was to save those who God for knew would be saved that's right God knew there was going to be somebody saved and there had to be a preparation or a way made for them to be saved if there wasn't salvation wasn't possible so God for knowing that people would be saved knowing who they were he had to lay a plan down now you'd say to me brother Brandon then God knows exactly who will be saved correctly well why does he say he's not willing that any should perish he isn't he isn't willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance but to order to be God he has to know who will do that or he wasn't God because he is he's omnipotent he's he's om apres he's om a mission he knows everything he's at ever placed and all powerful so four knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and know that's reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing at all these marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things that we see now God had to make a preparation for the other night was so amazed the little woman come up to the platform that big $300,000 PL there and she had a little makeup stuff on her face she stood there and she started trembling I said you're a Lutheran by the Holy Spirit she said yes sir and I said you're here to be prayed for and the reason you're walking way you are both knees have been broke I said that was caused by a car accident and a car that you were driving in 4 years ago she said that's true I said your doctor's a little Shar fell Baldhead and wears glasses said that's right now I said he's doctrin because that in the the knees the bone has become too berler and even the flesh is rotten around the bone she said that is right and she says is there a hope for me I said that depends on your approach to the Lord Jesus I said she said can you help me I said no man no one can help you now but you have to help yourself to God's provided blessings for you and she said I now believe with all my heart said the Lord heals you sister it's thus sayith the Lord you're healed she said Mr branom I haven't been able to kneel she said for 4 years while weeping standing there rubbing her hands the great audience of people weeping watching her Lutheran Presbyterians and I said why don't you go down to the Altar and kneel down she said let me kneel right here right where I'm Healed she never moved from her steps but she knew she was healed something took place she knew it there wasn't any guessing about it I said kneel down and for the first time four years with both knees broke and all calloused over made over the bones together that woman like a young woman knelt on her knees with the tears streaming from her cheeks raised up her hands to God or just raised right up from there just as easy like a little girl and tipped off the platform what was it God had to make a way for that now he sent doctors that's right and doctors are fine and they had done all they could do but God had made a away amen that's it after the doctor had failed in his way God's way is so much higher and our way what a wonderful thing now to think tonight that you and I W don't want to thank this but we were actually natured after the world say like pigs and tonight have become Saints something had to be done now we couldn't go into heaven as pigs we'd have to go into heaven as Saints so a preparation had to be made for this and God gave it so beautifully in the Old Testament back in the Book of Numbers about the 20th chapter and over Exodus about 3632 and we find out that on the day of atonement God in the types for showing what he would do in the anti type when it come which was Christ the high priest was commanded to take two goats little goats and take them in for Aon moment a offering and a bullock for his own family and many of you readers here and studiers of the Bible know just how that the atonements was but then one goat there had to be a lot cast and the lot fell on one goat it died and then the blood of this goat was placed upon the other goat with the hands of the high priest confessing the sins of the people upon the living goat and then a man who was worthy taken the living goat under his arm and went way into the Wilderness where the goat would have to perish and go into an isolated out of the way place never no more in that state to come back into the family of his own again but to be isolated forever bearing the sins of the people away now I know many scholars perhaps are sitting here and especially in the Adventist they they say that one goat was Christ and the other was the devil brethen I have to differ a little on that we can't sacrific to the devil both goats represented Christ both of them was Christ Christ is our he bled for our sins and he bore them his away amen devil can't bear my sins Christ is our sin barrier get it straight then your faith won't move Christ is our sin barrier and the sins of the world Christ was the dying animal at the cross listen the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Amen thank God and all only the types we were drawing dividends knowing that the end of type would come someday why was he slaying from the foundation of the world because God perceived in his mind how them things would be and what the church would be and what everything would be and he spoke the word amen and when God speaks the word it's as good as done right then so he was SL from the foundation of the world you see praise His holy name when you get down to that now I let your faith rest solemly not up on man not upon theologies of man not upon church denominations as good as they are as good as man is let your faith rest alone in Christ finished works at Cal for both sin and salvation you see it notice Christ came and he was the dying animal for he was already and prefigure slain before the foundation of the world you see it God spoke it and said it would be so so when God speaks it's forever confirmed in heaven amen the word the that's where you ought to have faith if you believe this to be God's Eternal interchangeable word than every precept that's spoken God's word is a seed amen and everything that God has spoke of in the word is already confirmed in glory god and it's been given to you to act upon so don't be afraid to take any phase of God's Eternal blessed work Hallelujah and anchor it in your heart now it has to be in soil now for instance I took a GRE a corn and put it in um blue pummy stone or something like that it perhaps would not grow because it's a wrong kind of soil but if it goes into good fertile black top soil it'll grow as sure as it's placed in there and when the word here it is now when the word of God falls into a Heart full of faith it just has to grow amen it's got to take hold that's the reason the woman standing there with both knees cast them over like that from the deposits and the breaking of the knees where both was mashed and the bones rotten with tu berler and the also the flesh she wasn't afraid to Bow her knees for what the word had fell in faith God Springs up you get it God before the foundation World said that Christ would be here and he slay die the innocent for the guilty and when God spoke it it was already confirmed when God spoke it now before it can be a word it has to be a thought for a word is a thought expressed and then if the god in his mind p receive these things then they were in his mind then he spoke them and they're as good as finish when God speaks C he's infallible amen and can do nothing else then God's attitude if God Saves Sinners back there on the base of accepting the burnt offering the sacrifice provided he's got to do the same thing today or he did wrong when he took the first man in amen if God heal the sick back there upon the bases of the shed blood of an animal upon the basis of the atonement he's got to do the same today or he was wrong when he heal the first person amen see he can't change we grow we mature we find better things we talk of better things we wear better clothes drive a better automobile we're progressing but God cannot progress in that way because he was perfect to begin with amen and Perfection cannot progress anymore amen it's already Perfection thank God Amen so he don't have to say well this is a different age we've got a better thought now if it is he can't be God so if he is God what he spoke back there he has to stay with it because he was perfect there and it's perfect now Hallelujah see GL for that you see it amen hallelujah and he can't progress he can't what I mean he can't EMB better things make this a little of say this would be a little better you say what about the old lamb and this lamb that was a type waiting for it and he said it was he spoke of the lamb slain the foundation of the world in the beginning I'll put imity against her seed and the serpent seed and then to wait till that fullness of time came God gave a propitiation of sin through the shed blood of the Lamb pointing he gave the same thing to the moon at night of the being the sun in the daytime the Moon being a shadow of the sun of the sun shining on the moon making a shadow the moon and the sun is husband and wife and while the sun is gone away it throws this light against the moon to give us a smaller right until the sun comes and when the sun come the moon Fades out amen Christ is the sun who's gone to glory and shining on the church with the same kind of light he shined when he was here and the church is the light of the world until Jesus comes and it all melts together praise God like the Moonlight the sunlight becomes one light when it emerges together when Christ and his church comes together at the great Millennium they emerge into one amen and today ye are the light of the and his presence and his absence rather he is giving you the light to shine with while he's here all the old things all the things of the Earth are a type of the Heavenly even to spiders and lizards and snakes and so forth are only types of evil spirit reflecting back why was a cancer called cancer because it has the form of a crab and the word cancer means crab now you see all those things which are types and shadows so the scapegoat that was put away Into the Wilderness in an isolated Place separated PR his fell citizens bearing the sins of the people upon his head was a type of Christ being SE separated from God and out of his presence and bore our sins to hell and there God wouldn't suffering David said I'll not suffer my Holy One seek corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and on the third day rose again for our justification amen but he tiped the goat the scapegoat and also the goat for the sin offering god making preparations and a provided way God always makes a way of ES C every time sickness pin you into the corner Satan pin you down to a place after you become a Christian maybe been a gambler you see it the cards are on the table come on John we know what in you Satan is there to tempt you but God in every every time will make a way of Escape if you just accept it maybe you've been a a drunker and the glasses under your nose ah come on John now if you want to heed to that voice you'll go right straight out to your Waller again but God is always there turn your mind towards heaven and look towards Calvary amen and say blessed Holy Spirit come to me I'm in need amen watch what takes place God Will Make A way of Escape every time for he will God has always did it and now notice before the destruction of the world when man were sinful and the people were sinful in the world God made a way of Escape for those who desired to escape by it God had an ark built PR prepared Noah buil away on an ark for the prepar ing this Ark for a preparation of way listen from a far away of Escape has a wrath and the Judgment of God was piling up in the Heavens to be poured out upon a sinful nation and a sinful people who rejected and stiff neck walked against the Commandments of God all the time this wrath was being piled up in the Heavens to be poured out upon the the people in judgment amen the merciful god made a way of Escape for those who desire to walk in it amen the way of Escape now we've come to the place again where the judgments you're piling up and of that day in the Andel luian how much more of today when the ending of The History of Time when the ending of history of the Nations and we're coming to a climax how much more is the wrath of God upon millions of more people heing together until sin has heaped in the world until she's a toing like a drunk man stagger home at done gone beyond the moon stars until it's reached the the garments of Jehovah yes of Sabbath and she's staggering her the load of her own man-made theory of her own self-preservation of her own theologies if taking the Commandments of God and making them an non effect by teaching their traditions of man loving the Praises of man more than the Praises of God our teachers have become lukewarm and placing up on joining church and saying that's all right long as you belong to church just forget about it but brother God made a way of escape and you'll have to come to God's terms and that's through Christ Jesus our lord no other Foundation is laid but that which has already been laid no no one to build up on any other Foundation is like stubbles and mud the floods of War it away and great will be the fall but Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it what is it he Build It Up on on the spiritual revealed truth that he is a son who does man say I the son of man am some say Elias and some say Moses and some say John the Baptist and so forth but who do you say I am without hesitation without taking a second listen in here that's the way you receive it he had been with him he knew what he was and then before he could even think the second time the Holy Spirit got a hold of him and he said th the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah said th blessed art thou Soul Simon bar for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned this from somebody's theology ever come from a Seminary with it but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail again amen the floods may come and the atomics may fall and all but he who safely in Christ right the storm of the atomic Ascend as Noah did the storm of the flood safely in the AR thank God hallah I sure Faith dropped down into that once oh see what takes place on God's Solid Rock on the ties God makes a way of Escape every time he has to make a way of Escape when the Strategic time comes God is the god Jehovah J Jehovah Gyra means the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice or the Lord will provide for himself a way of Escape amen God can provide it because he's the Creator and God once for all the calvary amen hallelujah there there when the archangels of Heaven all the reges of demons trembled when the earth took a nervous proration and shut the grave and when the sun had convulsions and hung by cter and turned into Blackness when the moon and stars shuck out of their places her redeemed of all ages and Through the Ages will come will'll recognize that hour amen when the Son of God died there stripped Satan of every Power even death and Hell the grave and all fear was swallowed up there Calvary when he paid the Supreme price and when the lamb died and the sins placed upon him he was a sin barrier Tu him to hell where they belong and God raised him up on the third day and by believing that we're justified by faith on the bases of the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen God making a way of Escape oh brother as you see the hear the am screaming every time you hear one it's a marker that you're going that way every time you pass a graveyard it's a marker you're going that way every time a wrinkle appears in the face and a gray hair in the head it's a marker you're going that way no wonder than Paul could say with that real hope rooted in ground him in like this H when he got down to the end of the road he said i p a good fight I'll finish the course I've kept the faith henceforth there's a for me a crown of righteous the Lord the righteous judge will give me it that day not only me but all that love his appearing amen when you're sick and tired of this whole life praise and you love the appearing of the Lord Jesus better than you love your food at the table or your wife or your children Hallelujah and there's a crown laid up for you not a crown of Gold Crown to put up on your head but a body free from Pain Hallelujah crowned in the glory of God crowned in the immortality of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what's laid up for you at the Lord the righteous will give you at that day amen that's the day we look forward to God has made a way of Escape for everyone of us certainly he has when Daniel the Prophet God's child was throw into a lion's den there was the time that Daniel being faithful who raised his windows and wasn't afraid of what the king said and when they prayed regardless of what the Proclamation was made Daniel Prayed anyhow as he faced Jerusalem and prayed if man faced Jerusalem and prayed the city where the burnt sacrifices made that's the reason Daniel looked that way and prayed for the Lord had already said the people be in trouble at any time and look towards this holy place and pray then here I'll hear from heaven when Solomon dedicated the temple that's the reason Jonah had the faith he did when had seaweeds wrapped around his neck and standing in vomit in a belly of the way away down down in the Deep of the ocean on a stormmy sea he said there are lying vanities but once more will I look to your Holy Temple God God did something he made a way of Escape for Jonah what he did nobody knows that's God's own secret but no matter where it was impossible God can can alter circumstances amen he can make the impossible become a profitable not only profitable but can make it a reality when man take God at his word and accept by way that God provided for the man God did something he might have put an oxygen tit down there I don't know what he did in the belly of that whale but he kept joning in there for three days and nights as a t that Christ would lay without oxygen in the belly of the earth and on the third day he'll come out again was a type he made a way of Escape he always will when Daniel stood there and the lion coming running to him there was not a fear in that old Saint's heart but he stood there and God wasn't finished with him and just before the Lions grabbed him an angel spread before them no doubt but a same burning light that appeared to Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus a big light shined out and they looked and they didn't know what was taking place and Saul fell from his heart and a voice came from the light say Saul Saul why persecutest thou me said who is it Lord he said ah Jesus you're persecuting it was the Hebrew children that had been faithful to the promise of God that was laying down there in the fiery furnace or in Babylon rather going to the Fier furnace One Step between them and death how much that may be to man here tonight there may be one day between you and eternal separation you'll make your decision now the Way's provided for you if you'll accept it one step said Jonathan to David when they shot the the the Bowl One Step between me and death One Step between them and death but just at that crucial moment Hall God provided a way of escape and he sent into that fiery furnace the Lord Jesus Christ and kept the fire off of them he was Enoch who claimed that he walked with God for 500 years and had a testimony he please God he had a faith that he wouldn't see death how could God do it there wasn't even a jet praying in those days to get him off his feet but God provided way a translation that took in out from Earth the glory that's receding death amen thank God it was Elijah who stepped across the old of the Jordan River that day but dividing from one side to the other praise the Lord why when Elijah was ready to go to heaven without dying hey it was God provided a way for him Hallelujah not a jet plane but he sent a chair of fire my heart as a fire huj god provided the way in the minute a way of escaped from Death it was Moses I believe who followed the children of Israel who led them following the light the pillar of fire through the Wilderness it was Moses who endured to the end his boses 120 years after 80 years of service for God who stood up on the mountain and looked over into the promised land with the tears rolling down his cheeks of an old man 120 years old he'd come through the Bri patches he'd waited the Deep Waters he tasted the bitter cup of G and sorrow he'd been with the disobedient PE people as their Pastor he led them from place to place and put up with their Merm and throw himself in the breach and said God take me before you do the H was Moses who stood there as an old man knowing that every way he was a type of Christ knowing somehow some way God Sur would take him because he had to bring him up again as the type of Christ he was born as a prophet as Christ not only a prophet but leader and so forth he was HD away the bull rushes and so was Christ taken into Egypt he was the law Giver as Christ was from the Mount of olive him from son every way he was a type of Christ and when he was old and death T in the face how would he ever bring forth the resurrection but just as a Cru moment come God provided a way when the breath was leaving and gurgling in his neck he looked Lan by his side and there stood The Rock God provided a Rock The Rock was Christ Jesus who is in the wild amen Moses endur to the Rock God give me Grace to endure to the same thing and when my life breath is being drawn from this body let me see the Rocks standing there stepped over on the Rock and the angels come and packed him away 800 years later he was standing in Palestine with Elijah standing there talking to Jesus before the cross God made a way of escape two of the greatest things in the Old Testament that I can see in the prophecies two great factions was this the people look forward to a time that when the Messiah would come and then if the Messiah come they look forward to a time that the Holy Spirit Spirit would come finally in due time all the types back there that they had through the prophets and everything all the types in the atonements they had finally Messiah come and it was settled because God had said so then they look forward to a time to a great glorious church that would be without spot or wrinkle that would shine in the Earth as a star they look for that time how's it going to be he've been dead for three days and nights he rose again he appeared in the 500 and then he ascended into heaven he left him on Earth here alone how could it be this glorious church when the leader was gone God promised the church how could it be the light that would shine in this place after him being gone when he said there a little while and the world sees me no more yet you will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world the things that I do shall you also go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them and believe how can they do it with Christ absent from them how can they do it when God given the promise look God provided a Pentecost when the Holy Ghost in person came down and Tu over mortal man's body after they been cleaned by the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost took that person into his own control and sent him forth with signs and wonders and miracles are fallowing amen God provided a way they couldn't do it in themselves they were man like you and I how could they do it they couldn't but God provided a way of Escape when they were in the upper room they thought the people would make fun of them they thought they'd be this side other they had the windows all closed and the doors locked how could they do it they were cowards they had no backbone they had a chicken wishbone and not a real Holy Ghost backbone they had the doors locked they was afraid they was ashamed to walk out and face the public how could they do it but God sent a Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost they form the windows and doors open and in the streets he went God promised it when God promises God will keep his word he'll make a way of Escape he'll never suffer you to be tempted above anything that he won't make a way of Escape for you feel good here we are we've lived through the day of a dismal day cloudy rainy the church is halfway in and halfway out they wonder how can they do this and how can they do had no light but the prophet said it'll be light in the evening time amen how can it be we the church in this day that glorious church that's to be here on Earth when Jesus comes to receive a glorious Church we're receiving the latter rain to pour out a double potion of the Holy Ghost is coming on the earth is sing every nation and Revival poers are burning on from China Japan from Korea the dark Africa and everywhere the holy spirit is being poured out upon the people

are pilgrims and strangers like David David was going through the battle he didn't go flated he didn't go with a halfway mark he didn't go thinking maybe it'll do it but he waited in the mberry bush until after a while it was death silent nothing going after a while away back in the distance he heard the lead start got louder and louder and louder after a while a great garer wind went all before him he know that was God in a holy host of angels going before him and he grew his sword and tucked the battle and set the enemy to fight Amen brother don't jump up and think something when you're not right to go yet stud it and see that it's not joining a church not shaking hands with a preacher neither's it been baptized in water but it's accepting God's provided sacrifice Jesus Christ as a person into your heart amen the Holy Ghost will move on before you like a Russian wind moving everything from the way Hallelujah amen thank you Lord that's it then be Christians you who are in the way
