[35:18] take the little book which has opened
[35:20] the hand of the angel it standed upon
[35:22] the sea
[35:23] and upon the earth and i went
[35:25] under the angel and said unto him give
[35:27] me the little book
[35:29] he said unto me take it ease it up i
[35:31] shall make thy belly bitter
[35:33] but it shall be nine monk tweeters honey
[35:35] and i took the little book out of the
[35:37] angel's hand ate it up
[35:39] it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[35:41] and as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was
[35:44] bitter he said unto me down must

[36:27] when i had heard and seen i fell down to
[36:30] worship before the feet of the angel but
[36:32] showed me these things
[36:34] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[36:40] for i am thy fellow servant and of the
[36:42] brethren the prophets and of them which
[36:44] keep the scenes of this book
[36:46] worship god

[36:53] of the prophecy of this book
[36:55] for the times at hand
[36:56] he doesn't just
[36:58] let him be unjust still he did which is
[37:01] filthy
[37:02] let him be filthy still he that is
[37:04] righteous let him be righteous still and
[37:07] he that is holy
[37:08] let him be holy still only from amos
[37:11] chapter 3
[37:13] reading from verse 6.
[37:19] shall the trumpet be blown in the city
[37:21] and the people not be afraid
[37:23] shall there be evil in the city and the
[37:24] lord had not done it
[37:26] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[37:29] revealed a secret
[37:31] unto his servants the prophets
[37:33] the lion had roared
[37:35] who will not fear
[37:37] the lord god had spoken
[37:39] who can but prophesy let us pray one
[37:41] more time father we thank you lord and
[37:44] you know what's up in my heart and how
[37:46] this came and i pray a blessed
[37:48] interpreter to the hearts and lives of
[37:50] your people in jesus name i ask it amen
[37:52] on amen you may be seated praise god
[37:56] hallelujah
[37:57] thank you lord jesus
[37:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[38:02] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah just
[38:05] give him some worship and some praise
[38:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[38:10] glory to god
[38:12] hallelujah
[38:16] it's so good to feel his presence this
[38:18] morning
[38:19] praise be to jesus
[38:24] there's an echo we have here
[38:35] and in revelation 19
[38:37] is the scripture here
[38:39] um you say right this is it from boost
[38:41] nine
[38:41] write blessed day which are called unto
[38:44] the marriage supper of the lamb
[38:46] and he said unto me
[38:48] these are the true sins of god
[38:50] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[38:52] and he said unto me see i'll do it if
[38:53] not i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[38:56] brethren that have the testimony of
[38:59] jesus worship god
[39:01] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[39:05] of prophecy
[39:06] the testimony of jesus is what
[39:09] this period of prophecy to this morning
[39:11] i have a title
[39:12] uh
[39:13] the lord had the lord god had spoken
[39:16] who can but prophesied
[39:19] of a subject
[39:20] the bride will have thus saith the lord
[39:24] because he said the spirit the prophet
[39:26] and the bride will say the same thing
[39:28] and i have an inspiration the testimony
[39:31] of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
[39:34] now you read the scripture
[39:35] that the time is at hand don't seals the
[39:39] saiyans of the prophecy of this book
[39:43] what makes the bible different from
[39:45] every other holy book
[39:48] it's because it's the book of prophecy
[39:51] this is not just a book of good behavior
[39:53] it show you what was what is
[39:57] and what is to come
[39:59] so this defines the scripture more than
[40:02] just a holy book
[40:03] more than just a book of ethics or
[40:05] behavior or attitude it's a book of
[40:08] prophecy
[40:09] hallelujah and the spirit of prophecy is
[40:11] the testimony of jesus
[40:13] because john was on the isle of pasmos
[40:15] for the testimony of jesus
[40:17] oh glory to god isn't that right no he
[40:20] read the scripture scene of the scene of
[40:21] the prophets of this book for the times
[40:23] at hand here is unjust let him be unjust
[40:26] still he which is filthy let him be
[40:28] filthy still he that is righteous as me
[40:30] writer still here is holy letting me
[40:32] hold his still
[40:34] now regardless of what you do the clock
[40:36] still ticks
[40:37] whether you don't want to go to work
[40:39] whether they want to sleep where they
[40:40] want to do whatever the clock still
[40:42] ticking
[40:43] so this prophecy is still taken
[40:45] nothing stops it
[40:46] so there is prophesying of an hour
[40:48] coming where things will be set
[40:50] and nothing could change righteous
[40:52] righteous still holy holy still things
[40:55] move him but everything's said
[40:57] oh hallelujah do you believe that
[41:00] then he said he which is filthy let him
[41:02] be filthy still
[41:04] no you would want to think that maybe
[41:06] the 30 people outside and whatnot but
[41:07] that's not what you're talking about
[41:09] so that's why we need a prophet
[41:12] to interpret what this word really is
[41:15] isn't that right now who's the filthy
[41:17] you know who the filthy is the foolish
[41:18] virgins
[41:22] let's read it we're in the homeland the
[41:24] jews are in the homeland we are at the
[41:26] end of the age ready for the rapture the
[41:29] rapture comes watch the church goes up
[41:32] and we are caught up to meet him in the
[41:34] air we all know that the stone that was
[41:37] cut out of the mountain is ready to come
[41:39] at any time
[41:41] and when it comes what does it do it
[41:44] does away with the gentile age
[41:48] you heard me preach more than once the
[41:49] coming of the stone closes the gentile
[41:52] dispensation
[41:53] so when we talk about covenant with
[41:55] stone and dynamics and all of that
[41:56] you're talking about the closing of the
[41:58] gentile dispensation that he could go
[42:00] across to the jews are you with me now
[42:03] hallelujah watch and the stone that was
[42:06] cut out of the mountain is ready to come
[42:08] at any time and when it comes what does
[42:10] it do it doesn't work where the gentile
[42:11] is it's all over and god completely
[42:14] quits dealing with them
[42:17] let him that is filthy be filthy still
[42:20] let him be holy be holy still what does
[42:22] he do then he takes his church the holy
[42:25] ghost filled
[42:26] his church is what the holy ghost taught
[42:28] no the holy ghost filled
[42:30] holy ghost filled somebody shout out
[42:33] phil
[42:34] you have to be filled with this thing
[42:36] with the call the holy ghost go give the
[42:38] lord some praises
[42:40] let's continue what's the filthy
[42:44] the sleeping version and then that comes
[42:46] up for judgment way over and here
[42:48] we'll get back into another map when we
[42:50] continue to this one over when she comes
[42:52] up to the wide shown judgment and has to
[42:54] be judged by the redeemed
[42:57] the foolish virgin had to be judged by
[43:00] the redeemed
[43:02] you know who the redeemer is the elected
[43:04] the perfected the bride of jesus christ
[43:07] because your blood price was paid at
[43:09] calvary and you are redeemed you are in
[43:11] christ therefore god can't judge you you
[43:14] already judge he took your judgment
[43:16] already oh give the lord some praises
[43:18] that's why we could shout this morning
[43:20] that way we could praise god this
[43:22] morning that's why john can say all on
[43:24] earth all under the earth heard i john
[43:26] praise god saying blessing and honor
[43:28] mind power dominion he had a revelation
[43:30] that we shall reign on the earth oh
[43:33] glory to god the earth belongs to
[43:35] [Applause]
[43:38] redeemed oh hallelujah hallelujah who is
[43:42] going to be into that new city that
[43:44] premier city the redeemed
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:47] praise god
[43:49] so we he said no
[43:51] all right he said paul told us not to
[43:53] take a matter of the court because the
[43:54] saints were judged all right let's go
[43:56] now did you notice
[43:58] he said you you have among those or you
[44:00] say they are jews but you found them
[44:02] liars

[1:04:55] a crazy attitude god go mash you up he

[1:05:02] blood business no no no no no no i for
[1:05:04] the kingdom thing i waited for the
[1:05:07] angels to escort me on this platform
[1:05:10] oh glory to god and bring your devils
[1:05:12] and come
[1:05:13] bring your sickness and come bring
[1:05:15] whatever and come
[1:05:16] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:05:19] oh
[1:05:20] god promised these things
[1:05:24] let me be seated
[1:05:29] 24th of november
[1:05:31] 1963.
[1:05:33] what shall i do with jesus call the
[1:05:34] christ buddha brown he said the book is
[1:05:36] already open
[1:05:38] that's right just waiting
[1:05:40] for the seventh
[1:05:41] seal
[1:05:42] to be identified of the coming of christ
[1:05:46] now he knew the seven sea wasn't
[1:05:47] truthful
[1:05:49] three phases thunders
[1:05:51] then he said invented unknown language
[1:05:52] and so on three steps right
[1:05:55] first step was seven dollars but he says
[1:05:58] waiting
[1:05:59] for the seventh seal
[1:06:01] to be identified
[1:06:03] in the coming of the lord
[1:06:05] now the coming of the lord is first
[1:06:06] thessalonians 4 16.
[1:06:09] the lord himself
[1:06:10] shall descend from heaven
[1:06:12] with a shout
[1:06:14] with a voice
[1:06:16] and with the trump
[1:06:17] and on the message the rapture just
[1:06:19] before he left
[1:06:21] it was all connected together
[1:06:23] then he said what is the shout he said
[1:06:26] that's the message of the hour
[1:06:27] the living bread so then we understood
[1:06:30] by revelation the shout is the seven
[1:06:33] thunders
[1:06:34] so then we could go back to revelation
[1:06:35] 10 and saw what the mighty angel came
[1:06:36] along with
[1:06:38] a message
[1:06:39] to gather the bride together
[1:06:41] to give the bride feet to show how to
[1:06:43] prepare to call a bride out the message
[1:06:46] is the shout out the message is the
[1:06:48] seven thunders not the seventh and
[1:06:50] there's a thing in it no it is the seven
[1:06:52] thunders and then seven thunders come
[1:06:54] from the mighty angel which is christ
[1:06:56] oh glory to god to catch a bride isn't
[1:06:58] that right
[1:06:59] oh glory to god isn't that right
[1:07:02] so it was the lord himself version 10
[1:07:05] the living bread
[1:07:06] to gather the people together
[1:07:09] by those seven thunders
[1:07:11] so revelation 10
[1:07:13] seven thunders the message
[1:07:15] the living bread the guy that i write
[1:07:17] together the shout
[1:07:19] the see of the lord a message of
[1:07:21] preparation
[1:07:22] danny we say the angel of the lord is
[1:07:24] unearthed now
[1:07:26] fixing things are wrong
[1:07:28] for the coming of the lord
[1:07:30] so this prophetic message of malachi 4
[1:07:33] is a message of life
[1:07:35] l-i-f-e
[1:07:36] this l-i-f-e is what the pentecostal did
[1:07:39] not have
[1:07:40] because they couldn't have it because
[1:07:41] it's along the word
[1:07:42] end up with gifts so god sent the word
[1:07:45] in him was life and the life was the
[1:07:47] light of men and the word became flesh
[1:07:49] and dwelt among us and when the word
[1:07:51] became flesh the invisible become
[1:07:52] visible so therefore god sent a prophet
[1:07:55] with the word that when you receive the
[1:07:56] word you become the word when you
[1:07:58] receive the word that's the secret the
[1:08:00] word is in the bright the word is in you
[1:08:03] oh glory to god so the word is in you
[1:08:05] and you are crying out for something
[1:08:07] what are you crying out for second peter
[1:08:09] four two seven for fate virtue knowledge
[1:08:12] the church member not crying out for
[1:08:14] that the bride is because that's the
[1:08:16] goal of his promised word and that's the
[1:08:18] wedding garment look at the lord i
[1:08:20] showed hey hey
[1:08:23] what yes
[1:08:24] that's the wedding comment what are you
[1:08:27] talking about i'm talking about faith
[1:08:29] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:08:32] godliness bodily kindness that is the
[1:08:35] wedding comment oh glory to god and the
[1:08:38] bridegroom will come
[1:08:39] oh give the lord a shout
[1:08:42] his wife had made herself ready by
[1:08:45] putting on the gun
[1:08:47] of his promised word
[1:08:49] it is still promised that is why we
[1:08:51] prophesy
[1:08:53] we got it to get that is why we prophesy
[1:08:56] it's on its way that is why we prophesy
[1:08:59] all glory the dynamics is coming that is
[1:09:01] why we prophesy
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:09] let's continue
[1:09:11] you see why
[1:09:12] i've been so zealous
[1:09:14] of the kind of seed that i planted for
[1:09:16] the body
[1:09:18] the rain
[1:09:19] is going to fall pretty soon now
[1:09:21] i mean the real rain
[1:09:22] before you leave he said the church is
[1:09:24] not beginning to get the message
[1:09:26] he said your fate isn't ripe enough
[1:09:28] intellectually hear any message you know
[1:09:30] he put the seed out rika ready for rain
[1:09:32] i'm the pentecostals advancement because
[1:09:34] there's no god give some drying time
[1:09:37] plus 50 years and drop some lingering
[1:09:40] time and lingering you know what

[1:09:44] through you must crazy house and crazies
[1:09:46] pass through and nut cases
[1:09:49] and all kind of cuckoo spirits pass

[1:09:54] mixed multitude
[1:09:55] oh glory to god but few
[1:09:59] many are chosen by the choke
[1:10:02] many are called by the shot but a few
[1:10:04] will be chosen by the next part of it

[1:13:28] brought a seed
[1:13:29] i see he's not to be just on the desk i
[1:13:32] see that to be buried you have to find
[1:13:34] people to bury that in

[1:14:10] you and your host wherever you are you
[1:14:12] better shout if you're a good drunk this
[1:14:14] morning
[1:14:16] glory to god hallelujah
[1:14:21] are you ready
[1:14:23] are you ready for this prophecy
[1:14:24] but the word of god has been sown also
[1:14:28] and when not if
[1:14:30] when
[1:14:31] the spirit of god
[1:14:34] begins to fall
[1:14:36] not past the teaching
[1:14:37] not teacher teaching not a possible
[1:14:40] porcelain no when the spirit
[1:14:43] begins to fall
[1:14:45] the word of god will live in the people
[1:14:50] i can close off right here
[1:14:52] right now
[1:14:55] we could shut down service here right
[1:14:57] now
[1:15:03] when
[1:15:05] when
[1:15:06] so we have to make room for the spirit
[1:15:08] of all
[1:15:11] i can't come and beat you up here for
[1:15:12] four five hours preaching what
[1:15:14] i am the spirit
[1:15:16] i go fall on you
[1:15:26] you know how long peter's message was
[1:15:28] under their pentecost
[1:15:30] he said 15 minutes
[1:15:33] 15 minutes
[1:15:35] and the holy ghost fell at 3 000 people
[1:15:37] and then people said what shall we do to
[1:15:39] be saved
[1:15:41] fifteen minutes sermon
[1:15:43] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:15:46] get a prophet he told me these men
[1:15:49] if they pick this up
[1:15:51] and go out with it
[1:15:53] they can make more sense to it
[1:15:56] to bring it to a place i just want a
[1:15:58] little seed
[1:16:00] then i hope
[1:16:01] they make it come to life
[1:16:04] but men make it more mysterious
[1:16:06] so mysterious yet i hear them to get the
[1:16:08] mystery but he was hoping
[1:16:10] to make these seas come to life
[1:16:13] oh glory to god in our power in these
[1:16:16] seeds it have power in the spoken word
[1:16:18] book is that power in the quotes is our
[1:16:21] power echoing what the prophet said
[1:16:23] without power in the prophecy it had
[1:16:26] power and thus here the lord oh glory
[1:16:28] the spirit is self-posed expressly
[1:16:31] through that prophet
[1:16:32] that's why i have confidence in what we
[1:16:35] are prophesying
[1:16:37] because god can't lie
[1:16:39] he said when the spirit begins to fall
[1:16:42] the same word you're fighting up with is
[1:16:44] gonna live in you
[1:16:46] i'm prophesying right now
[1:16:48] it's going to live in you
[1:16:51] oh glory to god the devil is a liar
[1:16:57] let me be seated
[1:17:00] i'll watch my time here let's get real
[1:17:03] you you called you

[1:17:35] failures he wasn't looking at that when
[1:17:38] he called you

[1:22:28] my god
[1:22:30] so he said i want a little seed
[1:22:33] i
[1:22:34] then hope they make it come to life
[1:22:37] so when does he come to life who
[1:22:39] or what will be identified
[1:22:41] this is that that brother theo spoke of
[1:22:44] no
[1:22:45] i'm a prophet
[1:22:46] i just read for you a monastery
[1:22:48] surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:22:50] but he revealed the secrets i look like
[1:22:53] a prophet to you
[1:22:54] do make me a prophet you know i will
[1:22:56] call you a liar up front
[1:22:58] don't go there you know
[1:22:59] surely the lord god shall do nothing
[1:23:02] but he revealed the secrets to saving
[1:23:04] the prophets he ain't talking about no
[1:23:06] pastor and evangelist not he didn't talk
[1:23:07] with them them had to get it from the
[1:23:09] prophet but god talking to the prophet
[1:23:11] because the prophet is the more peace of
[1:23:12] god
[1:23:13] hallelujah so when we read this course
[1:23:16] we read it from god's mouthpiece
[1:23:18] because the spirit the prophet and the
[1:23:19] bride will say the same thing
[1:23:21] people don't believe that you know
[1:23:23] nobody accept their lives from them
[1:23:24] preachers
[1:23:25] if they believe that they will say how
[1:23:27] come you're saying what the tips say
[1:23:31] because the spirit the prophet and the
[1:23:33] bride say the same thing and what they
[1:23:35] say
[1:23:36] already said
[1:23:37] the lord god has spoken
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:46] so that is why we have the confidence to
[1:23:48] preach what we preach
[1:23:50] oh hallelujah
[1:23:51] i can tell you this the reason the cat
[1:23:53] prophesied they never went to the angel
[1:23:55] they don't know what the book is
[1:23:58] their little book
[1:23:59] because one should eat that book
[1:24:01] you could only speak from the book
[1:24:03] oh you could eat that book and speak
[1:24:04] something different
[1:24:06] whatever you speak have to be from the
[1:24:07] book
[1:24:08] because you digest it
[1:24:10] what could come out of your belly
[1:24:12] oh glory to god have to be the book

[1:27:00] one time barbara talked about a man a
[1:27:02] place had no rain for a long time and i
[1:27:04] hold my mind in the middle of the road
[1:27:06] frail man
[1:27:07] grey hair man he raised his hand and
[1:27:09] said lord god i serve you all these
[1:27:11] years people went for umbrella anything
[1:27:12] you know
[1:27:13] when they see that old man had a no rain

[1:27:19] he say if i poke if i shut up heavens
[1:27:22] if i cause plague and pestilence if i do
[1:27:25] this if i do that then he said if my
[1:27:28] people that are called by my name shall
[1:27:31] humble themselves
[1:27:32] and pray and turn from their wicked ways
[1:27:35] then they're gonna hear from heaven and
[1:27:37] i'm gonna heal their land
[1:27:39] oh glory to god some of you might be on
[1:27:41] the place right now on the disease right

[1:27:46] said
[1:27:47] oh somebody say god said
[1:27:49] god had spoken that if you humble
[1:27:52] yourself and turn

[1:28:13] let's go they would love him
[1:28:16] and will have his potentials
[1:28:18] for he is their head
[1:28:20] they are his subjects
[1:28:22] subject to his head
[1:28:24] headship of christ was his notice what
[1:28:26] harmony jesus never did anything until
[1:28:29] he seen the father here's the secret
[1:28:32] the word is in the bride
[1:28:34] and the mind of christ
[1:28:37] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:28:39] she does it in his name she has
[1:28:43] thus saith the lord
[1:28:45] the church members don't have that but
[1:28:47] this bride
[1:28:48] she have the same lord then it is
[1:28:51] differentized
[1:28:52] so the holy spirit waters it until it
[1:28:55] has grown and serves its purpose
[1:28:57] they only do his will
[1:28:59] oh no one can persuade them different
[1:29:03] they have dusty as the lord or they keep
[1:29:06] still
[1:29:07] they do have a rare about every topic
[1:29:10] they don't have to talk and preach about
[1:29:11] every issue
[1:29:13] they want thus here the lord
[1:29:15] because you see god is behind dusty at
[1:29:17] the lord
[1:29:18] oh give the lord a shout
[1:29:20] like in bible study
[1:29:22] but isaac brought out oh isaiah came to
[1:29:25] hezekiah
[1:29:26] and told him
[1:29:28] your papers because the time up
[1:29:31] you're going to die
[1:29:32] and that is just hear the lord and
[1:29:35] isaiah start to walk out and isaiah
[1:29:37] walking out hezekiah turned to the wall
[1:29:40] and he said lord god
[1:29:42] i serve you all these years
[1:29:44] give me more time
[1:29:46] and god said
[1:29:48] oh glory to god
[1:29:50] god talk
[1:29:52] god come back to the prophet on his way
[1:29:54] out he says stop
[1:29:56] do the wrong
[1:29:58] go back
[1:29:59] tell ezekiah just said the lord i've
[1:30:02] given you 15 more years
[1:30:05] oh glory to god god could give you
[1:30:07] extension
[1:30:08] god could give a deliverance god can
[1:30:10] make a way where there is no way
[1:30:12] god could deliver you today deliver your
[1:30:15] family today heal you today seal you
[1:30:18] today that's the god we say
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:24] why god shall talk to hezekiah
[1:30:27] any other prophet
[1:30:31] god breaking rank
[1:30:32] when is the prophet islam he talked to
[1:30:34] them
[1:30:35] and let them come and talk to the people
[1:30:37] so whenever a prophet comes time to
[1:30:39] tremble
[1:30:45] they only do his will
[1:30:47] no one
[1:30:48] can make them do otherwise
[1:30:50] listen to this song
[1:30:52] satan
[1:30:53] does make things appealing
[1:30:55] sin is appealing the enemy have to keep
[1:30:58] finding better beat
[1:30:59] he will strip off a little more do this
[1:31:01] do that
[1:31:03] and he said watch
[1:31:05] talk about woman hunting but satan keeps
[1:31:07] bringing sin in
[1:31:08] that's it but god doesn't have to do
[1:31:10] anything more to his
[1:31:12] to make it more appealing
[1:31:13] watch the only thing he has to do is
[1:31:16] just raise the standard
[1:31:18] of his own word
[1:31:19] against the enemy
[1:31:21] so when the bible said when the enemy
[1:31:23] come like a flood the spirit of god
[1:31:26] reads the standard against it
[1:31:28] what does he do
[1:31:29] he makes the word that he's already said
[1:31:32] more positive
[1:31:35] so the time is not yet
[1:31:38] so instead of you weight frustrated
[1:31:41] the anointing come this morning
[1:31:43] to make this same word
[1:31:45] more positive to you

[1:32:00] too
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:03] you could be free too
[1:32:05] when you see your enemies
[1:32:07] in the red sea
[1:32:09] why pharaoh coming for you
[1:32:10] they're coming behind near the chariots

[1:36:08] god amen hallelujah glory
[1:36:12] thank you lord but abraham
[1:36:15] is it true that every jew born since
[1:36:17] christ will be saved
[1:36:18] who are 144 thousand are they the
[1:36:21] predestinated ones to be sealed with the
[1:36:22] holy ghost what is their mission there
[1:36:24] about three or four questions here no
[1:36:26] he said the first one is it true
[1:36:28] that every jew born since christ came to
[1:36:30] be saved no
[1:36:31] nothing would be saved only those whose
[1:36:33] names were put in the lamb book of life
[1:36:35] before the foundation of the world you
[1:36:36] are true or gentile that's so the book
[1:36:39] holds the mystery and the book is only
[1:36:42] unfolding it now not each one's name but
[1:36:45] what the mystery of the book is
[1:36:47] while it is called into his name the
[1:36:49] book doesn't say no level is to be saved
[1:36:52] in a time of church or all my never no
[1:36:54] it just shows the mystery or unfolds the
[1:36:56] mystery of what the thing is and we
[1:36:58] ourselves by faith believe it
[1:37:00] oh my god hallelujah
[1:37:03] i want to realize uh
[1:37:04] because this is coming next
[1:37:06] isaiah 28
[1:37:09] 16-22
[1:37:11] therefore dost hear the lord god behold
[1:37:12] eileen zan
[1:37:14] for a foundation of stone
[1:37:15] a tried stone a precious corner stone
[1:37:18] short foundation
[1:37:19] either believer shall not make his
[1:37:21] judgment also relate to the to the line
[1:37:24] and righteousness to the planet and the
[1:37:26] hill shall sweep away the refuge of lies
[1:37:29] and the water shall overflow the hide in
[1:37:31] place and your covenant will death shall
[1:37:33] be disannulled and your agreement with
[1:37:35] hell shall not stand all this is
[1:37:37] prophecy
[1:37:38] this is the judgment part of this
[1:37:40] message hallelujah
[1:37:43] and and when the overflowing score shall
[1:37:45] pass through then you shall be trotted
[1:37:46] down by it from the time that it goes
[1:37:49] forth it shall take you
[1:37:51] for morning by morning shall it pass
[1:37:53] over by day and by night it shall be a
[1:37:56] vexation only to understand the report
[1:37:59] for the bed is shorter than the man can
[1:38:01] stretch himself on it that is very
[1:38:02] miserable you know you're lying on a
[1:38:04] short bit
[1:38:05] and your foot hanging out if you pull
[1:38:07] your head your head fall along this side
[1:38:09] very uncomfortable
[1:38:11] god describing the condition the bed is
[1:38:13] shorter than a man can stretch himself
[1:38:15] and the covering narrower than he can
[1:38:17] wrap himself in it
[1:38:19] and that in the armrest for they will
[1:38:20] find that the bed is too short for a man
[1:38:22] to stretch himself on
[1:38:24] and the covering too now of him to wrap
[1:38:26] himself in all the sources of confidence
[1:38:29] will fail then
[1:38:32] what a condition to be in
[1:38:34] when people begin to recognize their
[1:38:36] faith and confidence was in flesh and
[1:38:38] blood
[1:38:40] and god breaks that
[1:38:42] and now they have no confidence
[1:38:44] when their faith and confidence should
[1:38:46] have been the word
[1:38:48] because the word is god
[1:38:49] hallelujah for the lord shall rise up as
[1:38:52] in mong perism he shall be wrought as in
[1:38:55] the valley of gibeon that he may do his
[1:38:57] work his strange work and bring to pass
[1:38:59] his act his strange act now therefore be
[1:39:02] not mockers at least your hands be made
[1:39:05] strong
[1:39:06] for i have heard from the lord god of
[1:39:08] hosts a consumption
[1:39:10] even determined upon the whole earth
[1:39:14] could i continue
[1:39:20] just halfway through
[1:39:22] but god is good
[1:39:24] first peter 4 17-18
[1:39:27] for the time has come
[1:39:29] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:39:31] god
[1:39:32] and if it begin at us what shall the end
[1:39:35] be of them that obey not the gospel of
[1:39:37] god
[1:39:38] and if the righteous case will be saved
[1:39:40] where shall the unconditional sin appear
[1:39:43] remember ezekiel 9.
[1:39:45] potamark
[1:39:46] then the suffering angels where god said
[1:39:48] the beginning of los angeles no he said
[1:39:50] bigger than my sanctuary that's what i
[1:39:52] say don't look outside
[1:39:54] look what is taking place inside
[1:39:56] look what the spirit is speaking
[1:39:58] expressly whether by pulpit whatever
[1:40:00] bible study is the spirit at work you
[1:40:02] know
[1:40:03] god trying to get something to his
[1:40:04] people
[1:40:05] don't take anything by just lightly it's
[1:40:08] god
[1:40:09] hallelujah god speaking
[1:40:11] listen he could use a donkey
[1:40:13] he could use me
[1:40:20] doesn't matter he donkey care
[1:40:22] it's what the voice speak
[1:40:23] lord god has spoken but a man i'm do you
[1:40:26] saying gonna stand outside your door and
[1:40:28] knock all the time there's a time he
[1:40:30] will get enough and turn away
[1:40:32] then you will do the knocking but you'll
[1:40:34] never find him come while there is time
[1:40:36] come while there's still a knock don't
[1:40:39] you compromise with anything less than
[1:40:41] the baptism of the holy ghost like the
[1:40:43] god of pentecost with the same type of
[1:40:45] baptism and so on
[1:40:46] oh my hallelujah
[1:40:49] praise god
[1:40:51] everyone say well this fellow died
[1:40:52] without a warning no no no god doesn't
[1:40:55] do it that way god never brings any man
[1:40:57] to his debt without first warning him
[1:41:00] about it
[1:41:01] he says that's the nature of god he
[1:41:03] wants before judging
[1:41:04] hallelujah god never ever brings
[1:41:06] judgment upon the earth without first
[1:41:08] giving the people a warning god never
[1:41:10] does nothing without declaring it first
[1:41:12] that he's going to do and it gives
[1:41:14] people a choice and you can do right or
[1:41:17] wrong oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:20] do you believe that
[1:41:21] hallelujah thank you lord jesus
[1:41:24] thank you lord jesus
[1:41:25] no he doesn't always strike strike when
[1:41:28] he warns
[1:41:29] i want you to watch this quotation god
[1:41:32] gives a warning
[1:41:33] but he don't always strike the same time
[1:41:36] he warns did you notice that that when
[1:41:39] he doesn't strike then he sends a
[1:41:41] warning then the prophet is mocked you
[1:41:43] didn't have it you told a lie he wasn't
[1:41:45] right
[1:41:46] a prophet foresees way off the things
[1:41:48] that is coming he sees the cup of god's
[1:41:50] wrath full before it is filled he can
[1:41:53] say thus saith the lord god will destroy
[1:41:55] this city except you repent why he's an
[1:41:58] eagle he writes way in yonder he looks
[1:42:01] way off he sees the cup of iraq poured
[1:42:03] out and that's what the prophet is
[1:42:04] looking at he ain't looking what's going
[1:42:06] on here he can see the shade the world
[1:42:09] will be dark in darkness and god's
[1:42:12] darkness but he is high enough the sun
[1:42:14] is shining now but he sees the shade
[1:42:16] coming and he is saying what he's
[1:42:18] looking at he ain't here yet but he
[1:42:21] shall be here
[1:42:23] it's going to be here
[1:42:24] when he speaks of his vision whether it
[1:42:27] is rat where it is healing it may linger
[1:42:30] but it's got to come to pass
[1:42:33] if he speaks it in the name of the lord
[1:42:35] you see it might be a blessing that he
[1:42:37] speaks for you he might tell you a
[1:42:39] certain thing and you can't see it at
[1:42:40] all you say how can it be he told me
[1:42:43] dusty the lord this is going to happen
[1:42:44] that going to happen it ain't happened
[1:42:46] but the man is wrong no you'll be judged
[1:42:48] for this leaving it but it's going to
[1:42:50] happen anyhow
[1:42:51] it's got to happen do it linger yet it
[1:42:53] will speak in its season and time oh
[1:42:56] blessed be the name of the lord ezekiel
[1:42:58] chapter two we're in the home stretch
[1:43:01] and he said under me son of man stand up
[1:43:03] on your feet and i will speak unto thee
[1:43:06] and the spirit entered into me
[1:43:08] when he speak unto me and set me up on
[1:43:10] my feet and i heard him that speak unto
[1:43:11] me he said unto me son of man
[1:43:13] i send thee to the children of israel
[1:43:16] to a rebellious nation
[1:43:18] that have rebelled against me
[1:43:21] they and their fathers have transgressed
[1:43:23] against me even at this very day
[1:43:25] they are impudent children and
[1:43:27] stiff-hearted i do send it unto them and
[1:43:30] thou shall see unto them thus fear the
[1:43:32] lord god
[1:43:33] and they
[1:43:34] whether they will hear or whether they
[1:43:36] will forbid that's whether they're here
[1:43:38] they don't want to hear
[1:43:39] for their rebellious house yet shall
[1:43:41] they know they have been a prophet among
[1:43:43] them
[1:43:44] and those son of man be not afraid of
[1:43:46] them
[1:43:47] neither be afraid of their words
[1:43:48] though buyers and thorns be with thee
[1:43:51] and doubt thus dwell among scorpions be
[1:43:53] not afraid of their words or be dismayed
[1:43:55] at their looks do they be a rebellious
[1:43:57] house
[1:43:58] thou shalt speak my words unto them
[1:44:02] whether they will hear or whether they
[1:44:03] will forbid for their most rebellious
[1:44:06] but those son of man hear what i see on
[1:44:09] today
[1:44:10] be not though rebellious like that
[1:44:11] rebellious house
[1:44:13] so he has parents on a man you know
[1:44:15] don't be rebellious like demon
[1:44:17] this is god talking to his prophet
[1:44:19] hallelujah are you with me
[1:44:21] open thy mouth and eat what i give thee
[1:44:26] glory
[1:44:28] and when i looked behold
[1:44:30] a hand was sentenced to me
[1:44:33] lo a role of a book was therein
[1:44:36] and he spread it before me
[1:44:38] and it was written within and without
[1:44:40] doesn't that sound familiar
[1:44:42] a book written written and without
[1:44:44] and therein lamentations and mourning
[1:44:46] and woe
[1:44:47] ezekiel chapter three moreover he said
[1:44:49] unto me son of man eat that they'll find
[1:44:52] this eat this rule
[1:44:53] and go and speak unto the house of
[1:44:55] israel
[1:44:56] you know what i told you somebody can
[1:44:58] eat it and speak something different
[1:45:00] you have to speak from the book
[1:45:02] so if you eat the role you have to speak
[1:45:04] from what the contents of the book he
[1:45:06] was going to speak judgment and
[1:45:07] lamentations and woes to the people and
[1:45:09] god gave him a school to eat to eat that
[1:45:11] then speak to them
[1:45:13] so i opened my mouth and it caused me to
[1:45:15] eat that rule he said unto me son of man
[1:45:17] cause thy belly to eat and fill like
[1:45:20] bowls with this rule that i give thee
[1:45:22] then did i eat it
[1:45:24] it was in my mouth as honey
[1:45:26] for sweetness
[1:45:27] doesn't that sound familiar
[1:45:29] i heard a voice again say go to the
[1:45:31] angel
[1:45:32] and say give me the little book
[1:45:34] take it and eat it up it shall be my
[1:45:36] belly bitter but in my mouth it shall be
[1:45:38] sweet as honey
[1:45:40] oh glory to god
[1:45:41] and don't watch he's telling me son of
[1:45:43] man okay
[1:45:45] go get thee into the house of israel
[1:45:48] and speak with my words unto them for
[1:45:51] not center people of strange speech
[1:45:53] o had language but to the house of
[1:45:55] israel
[1:45:56] not to many people have strange speech
[1:45:58] but a higher language whose words though
[1:46:00] cancer understand surely had i sent thee
[1:46:02] to them they would have happened unto
[1:46:03] thee but the house of israel will not
[1:46:06] hack unto thee for they will not happen
[1:46:08] unto me for all the words of israel are
[1:46:10] impudent in this heart and behold i have
[1:46:12] made thy face strong against their faces
[1:46:14] and thy forehead strong against their
[1:46:15] foreheads as an adamant hardened and
[1:46:18] flint have i made thy forehead fear them
[1:46:20] not neither be dismayed at their looks
[1:46:23] though there be a rebellious house
[1:46:24] moreover he's saying to me son of man
[1:46:26] all my words that i shall speak unto

[1:47:51] days that's the thing
[1:47:54] that will bring faith
[1:47:55] into the people
[1:47:56] that will take the rapture and fate
[1:47:58] people don't want to preach it they
[1:47:59] don't want to talk about this great
[1:48:01] outpouring
[1:48:02] of the spirit i'm only building
[1:48:05] you always throws at hand when you're
[1:48:06] going to see something happen when
[1:48:08] something's going to take place and all
[1:48:10] this background here has only been
[1:48:11] laying the foundation for a short quick
[1:48:13] message
[1:48:14] that will shape the whole nation
[1:48:16] not a long drawn ball message
[1:48:18] short quick message
[1:48:20] oh glory to god could i finish off here
[1:48:22] now
[1:48:23] the bride has no revival as yet there
[1:48:25] are no revival there no manifestation of
[1:48:28] god is to the bride
[1:48:30] we are looking for it it will take those
[1:48:32] seven unknown thunders to wake up again
[1:48:35] oh my
[1:48:36] so let's continue here now
[1:48:38] brother branham
[1:48:39] he said the original wheat seed of
[1:48:41] pentecost was to come back in the last
[1:48:42] age
[1:48:43] it was buried at nicaea this prophet
[1:48:45] messenger of revelation 10 7 must be
[1:48:47] already in the land
[1:48:49] once more thus saith the lord must be
[1:48:51] here
[1:48:52] ready to be manifested with infallible
[1:48:54] vindication thus is the true seed
[1:48:56] already maturing and then the harvest
[1:48:59] harvest time the two vines that grew
[1:49:02] together
[1:49:03] for the past 50 plus years
[1:49:04] entwined their branches and now to be
[1:49:07] separated
[1:49:08] the fruits of those vines which were at
[1:49:10] such variants will be gutted into
[1:49:12] separate ghanas the two spirits will go
[1:49:15] to their separate destinations and when
[1:49:17] it is time to heed the final call that
[1:49:19] comes only to the wheat bride
[1:49:22] come out of her my people that should be
[1:49:24] not partakers of our sins
[1:49:26] that you receive not the plagues the
[1:49:29] great tribulation of the sixth seal
[1:49:32] matthew 24.
[1:49:33] so the plagues
[1:49:35] the tribulation
[1:49:36] sex seal
[1:49:38] that is what the foolish virgin's going
[1:49:39] to end up with
[1:49:40] but the seven seals dropped down between
[1:49:43] before the sixth seal to color the bride
[1:49:46] the lord himself descend the seventh sea
[1:49:48] with seven thunders under there they
[1:49:50] call you that's why we are privileged
[1:49:52] this morning
[1:49:53] glory to god this is the last warning
[1:49:56] he had an heir let him hear what the
[1:49:58] spirit said in churches there will be no
[1:50:00] other
[1:50:00] the throne room has been set up
[1:50:02] the 12 foundations have been laid
[1:50:04] the streets of gold have been paved the
[1:50:07] gates of the gigantic poles are raised
[1:50:09] and hinged
[1:50:10] like a pyramid she stands so fair and
[1:50:12] glorious the heavenly beings who have
[1:50:14] prepared her watch breathlessly for she
[1:50:17] glistens and shines with a glory that is
[1:50:19] unearthly every facet of a beauty tells
[1:50:22] a story of amazing grace and jesus love
[1:50:25] she's a city
[1:50:26] prepared for prepared people
[1:50:28] she awares only for in her inhabitants
[1:50:32] and soon there will be a trunk of
[1:50:34] streets with joy yes it will be the last
[1:50:36] call
[1:50:37] the spirit will not speak at another age
[1:50:39] the ages are over
[1:50:41] thank god at this moment this age is not
[1:50:43] over
[1:50:44] he is yet crying
[1:50:46] and this cry is not only in the
[1:50:48] spiritual heirs of men by his spirit but
[1:50:50] once again a prophet is in the land
[1:50:53] once more god will reveal the truth as
[1:50:55] he did to paul
[1:50:57] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[1:50:59] the days of laodicea its messenger will
[1:51:02] reveal the mysteries of god as revealed
[1:51:05] to paul
[1:51:06] he will speak out and those that receive
[1:51:08] that prophet in his own name will
[1:51:10] receive the beneficial effect of that
[1:51:12] prophet's ministry until i will hear him
[1:51:15] will be blessed and become part of that
[1:51:18] bride of the last days who are mentioned
[1:51:21] in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the
[1:51:23] bride say come yes
[1:51:25] listen to this authenticated prophet of
[1:51:27] god who appears in this last age what he
[1:51:30] says from god the bride will say
[1:51:32] oh glory to god the spirit
[1:51:34] and the prophet and the pride will be
[1:51:37] saying the same thing
[1:51:39] and what they say will already be said
[1:51:41] in the word
[1:51:42] and they're saying come out of here my
[1:51:44] people
