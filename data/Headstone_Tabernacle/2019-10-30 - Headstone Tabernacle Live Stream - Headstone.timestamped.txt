[55:08] brought out testing time he believed God
[55:09] I was able to raise him up from the dead
[55:11] he believed it see because God had made
[55:13] the promise and when God made a promise
[55:14] that he would be father of Nations and
[55:16] he believed that that was so a man he
[55:20] didn't know how it would be when the
[55:21] baby would come but after he trusted 25
[55:24] years then want us to destroy the baby
[55:27] oh my that same son that he loves so
[55:29] much offer him up isn't that right was a
[55:32] would a Abraham receive hallelujah and
[55:34] he still knew that God's promise was
[55:36] true hallelujah and he gave his son is
[55:39] now the Bible said the seed his seed is
[55:43] the same thing the promise of God is the
[55:45] seal watch to those who are the seed of
[55:48] Abraham
[55:50] the promise is a seal a sign witness and
[55:53] when we believe every promise word then
[55:56] the seal is given to us to confirm the
[55:59] promise oh oh God promised a senior when
[56:04] you stay with that promise word
[56:05] hallelujah seals you and confirms a
[56:09] promise that he made to you in the

[56:32] the genuine sphere of the Holy Ghost
[56:34] hallelujah oh and God confirms his
[56:37] promise to you a man as an individual
[56:41] it's not right please God oh my Eman
[56:45] Abraham so he says he is he so he said
[56:48] if we being the seed of Abraham we go
[56:51] through the test whether we're gonna
[56:52] believe the Bible or not see the Bible
[56:54] is the Word of God because it is God
[56:56] isn't that right and then after you went
[56:59] through the test to believe he said when
[57:02] some that some what I'm saying that
[57:03] these Americans pass if you accept that
[57:04] he said that's contrary to the world he
[57:07] said if you say you can't see the Holy
[57:08] Ghost today there's no such thing just
[57:11] the Twelve Apostles receive it you can't
[57:12] get it see the word said Peter preaching

[57:19] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[57:21] of your sins and you shall receive the
[57:23] gift of the Holy Ghost amen

[1:02:58] day of the sixth month and the fifth day
[1:03:00] of the month as I sat in mine house and
[1:03:02] the elders of Judah sat before me he
[1:03:05] said that the hand of the Lord fell they
[1:03:07] upon me is Ezekiel's testimony now and
[1:03:11] he said then I beheld and lo a likeness
[1:03:12] as the appearance of fire from the
[1:03:15] appearance of his loins even downward
[1:03:17] fire and from his loins even upward as
[1:03:19] the appearance of brightness as a colour
[1:03:21] of am a man so this is his visitation
[1:03:24] here now and he said now and he put
[1:03:26] forth the form of an hand and took me by
[1:03:30] a lock of mine head and a spirit lifted
[1:03:33] me up between earth and the heaven and
[1:03:37] brought me in the visions of God to
[1:03:41] Jerusalem oh here's a prophet being
[1:03:43] lifted up into another dimension and
[1:03:46] he's seeing something now watch he says
[1:03:48] here now he says and into Jerusalem he
[1:03:50] said now much and and to the door the
[1:03:53] inner gate so he's been lifted up and
[1:03:55] he's seeing into Jerusalem and now God
[1:03:58] is showing him something - the door the
[1:03:59] inner gate and look at that towards the
[1:04:01] north where the seat of the image of
[1:04:03] jealousy which provoked it to jealousy
[1:04:05] and he said I behold the glory of the
[1:04:07] God of Israel was there according to the
[1:04:09] vision that I saw
[1:04:10] in the plane and he said then he said
[1:04:12] unto me son of man lift up thine eyes
[1:04:14] now the way to what the known so I
[1:04:16] lifted up mine eyes towards the way of
[1:04:18] the north and behold northward and the
[1:04:20] gate of the altar this image of jealousy
[1:04:22] in the entry and he said furthermore to
[1:04:25] me son of man see us what I'll do even
[1:04:27] the great abominations that the house of
[1:04:29] Israel committed here and I shall go far
[1:04:32] off from my sanctuary
[1:04:33] but till me yet again and all shall see
[1:04:35] greater abominations it's not so here it
[1:04:39] was Ezekiel a prophet being lifted up by
[1:04:41] a lock of his hair into a realm and
[1:04:44] seeing what what other people not seeing
[1:04:47] he is seeing all of these great visions
[1:04:49] all of these things taking place how
[1:04:52] many times people do things behind
[1:04:53] closed doors and feel as if God not
[1:04:55] seeing but God is seeing everything that
[1:04:58] you do
[1:04:59] your attitude what you're seeing in your
[1:05:02] mind don't you know your thoughts speak
[1:05:04] louder in heavens than your words Oh
[1:05:07] hallelujah
[1:05:10] that's why you got to have the right
[1:05:11] attitude towards the divine promise of
[1:05:14] God towards his word to what courts
[1:05:17] people is now towards God's servants and
[1:05:21] God is judging your attitude and seeing
[1:05:24] what you are doing how you are doing it
[1:05:26] isn't that right and who is here tonight
[1:05:28] The Secret Service agent
[1:05:30] Oh hallelujah the tutor is here tonight
[1:05:33] and he's looking at your aptitude to see
[1:05:35] how you stay with that one
[1:05:38] oh it's nice to see how you take that
[1:05:41] word to see what's the to do you have
[1:05:43] when you go out is now and the test is
[1:05:46] not in here
[1:05:47] Amen all right we come in here we wish
[1:05:49] it the Lord oh we feel good but then
[1:05:51] when you go out of here what what what
[1:05:52] takes place who are you and you're out
[1:05:54] there and then people pull you this way
[1:05:57] and that way or when you have to face
[1:06:00] the challenges of the hour it takes
[1:06:02] something more than just coming to
[1:06:04] church to face those challenges it takes
[1:06:07] something more and you know it a many
[1:06:09] the test is real but God is real also
[1:06:12] and it's word is real and his word is
[1:06:15] anointed and if it's anointed in you you
[1:06:17] live it if it's anointed a new you speak
[1:06:19] it you
[1:06:20] something different than what you've
[1:06:22] been doing all a while because it's got
[1:06:24] to be inspired to you it's got to be
[1:06:26] real to you
[1:06:28] Holly it's got to take ahold of your
[1:06:29] life Oh hallelujah hallelujah slay me
[1:06:33] and I trust him it's got to be out there
[1:06:36] in the real you got to representing the
[1:06:39] natural and you're walking your talk
[1:06:41] well I'm getting ready to close tonight
[1:06:42] oh wee man do you love him
[1:06:45] Oh hallelujah glory be to God amen and
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] Oh hallelujah amen there's something
[1:06:54] here I wanted to read before we get
[1:06:55] ready to switch over okay the prophets
[1:06:59] say he said uh in the end time and time
[1:07:01] science see he said many tried to say
[1:07:03] it's tampered with this but done away oh
[1:07:05] I don't believe that
[1:07:05] I believe there's got to come some kind
[1:07:08] of a standard that God will judge the
[1:07:10] church by or the world
[1:07:12] he said there's got to be some standard
[1:07:14] it cannot be a church organization no it
[1:07:18] can be a creep or something somebody
[1:07:20] made up it can be based on that no see
[1:07:23] because they're different and he said
[1:07:26] furthermore who would know what to do
[1:07:28] this one claimed to be right this one
[1:07:31] claimed to have the right interpretation
[1:07:32] the right thing is now right who would
[1:07:34] know what to do he said but there is a
[1:07:35] standard and he said and that is his
[1:07:38] word and he said I believe that God
[1:07:40] watches over his word it's not right he
[1:07:44] said I believe that that word is
[1:07:45] punctuated exactly the way God wants it
[1:07:48] amen amen hallelujah praise God isn't
[1:07:52] that right he said one time he said God
[1:07:54] didn't tell Moses take off his hat he
[1:07:56] said Moses gonna say we'll take off our
[1:07:57] hats in the presence of God it looks
[1:07:59] nice it looks gentlemanly but that's not
[1:08:01] what God said that take your shoes off
[1:08:03] Moses but a place where his tannin is
[1:08:06] holy honey is not right he go on holy
[1:08:08] ground now hallelujah you have to obey
[1:08:10] His commandments hallelujah and do all
[1:08:13] that he said to do hallelujah huh and
[1:08:16] here bless you and he'll anoint you and
[1:08:18] he'll inspire and he'll give you the
[1:08:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:22] you give me your promise he'll give you
[1:08:24] improving you make a way out
[1:08:26] oh my said but there's no standard what
[1:08:29] is it is this would I believe that God
[1:08:31] watches over his word I believe that God
[1:08:33] would is punctuated exactly the way he
[1:08:35] wants it the Bible he said it's God's
[1:08:37] Word to the people he said and there's
[1:08:39] where the reason I believe in that word
[1:08:41] he said and I believe that the word is a
