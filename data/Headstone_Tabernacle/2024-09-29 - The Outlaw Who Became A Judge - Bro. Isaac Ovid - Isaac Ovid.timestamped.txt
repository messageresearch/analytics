[46:37] [Applause]
[46:40] Frid these sort of
[46:43] testimonies bring glory to the kingdom
[46:46] of
[46:47] God because it shows where your life
[46:50] could be
[46:52] changed your life could be
[46:54] preserved your life could be kept
[46:57] in this present evil
[46:59] time when he shared his testimony about
[47:02] four years ago about the experience of
[47:04] God doing something within him it looked
[47:07] like something to just watch because we
[47:09] have heard people with different
[47:11] testimonies and stories and and whatnot
[47:13] and it just F to the ground but this is
[47:17] years later it is just as strong not
[47:19] only that he investigated his own
[47:23] testimony by the word and by history to
[47:26] see that his something that is real it
[47:28] is tangible that you can be released
[47:31] from your guilt from your shame from
[47:34] your past and you can experience the
[47:36] true forgiveness of
[47:39] God which come by God's works but which
[47:43] come by God's grace by God's word rather
[47:46] okay so I shared something before he
[47:50] came on about
[47:53] entitlement and and and so like that and
[47:55] I just want to bring back something I'm
[47:56] not not the speaker this morning but
[47:57] Isaac would Minister to you this morning
[48:00] but I fell let to come before him to
[48:01] share something to with you and
[48:05] something brother Kelly said and that
[48:07] was so beautiful to me about the opening
[48:09] of the word reveals Jesus you know a lot
[48:13] of ministers talk about the opening of
[48:14] the word and seals and Mysteries and vs
[48:16] and plagues and woves and a lot of drama
[48:18] behind there that looks all exciting and
[48:21] I call it sometime verbal gymnastics
[48:23] flipping words to stimulate the people
[48:25] head and mind but the truth is the
[48:29] revealing of the word supposed to reveal
[48:31] Jesus Christ and at the end of the day
[48:34] if you can't see
[48:36] Jesus something kind of wrong something
[48:39] not cutting it then because we have been
[48:41] through the Pentecostal age 1906 and the
[48:43] Pentecostal speaking in tongues and all
[48:45] their drama and it hasn't worked out
[48:47] because they reject the word so they
[48:48] have no life to this day they still
[48:51] don't have the life I don't care best
[48:53] how much big the churches is how much
[48:54] money they have they still have a battle
[48:56] with life life that's is why this one
[48:58] falling here this one cracking up here
[49:00] this one doing all kind of crazy stuff
[49:01] here because they have a contention with
[49:03] this life well this message come to
[49:05] bring life and and the life is what will
[49:08] give us the test and the trial that will
[49:11] produce character because character is
[49:13] not a gift never will be never can be
[49:17] character I mean now in time like these
[49:20] you'll find how the prophet words are
[49:22] waited that character is not a gift you
[49:25] not you don't have a gift of character
[49:27] you have to go through discipline there
[49:29] a word people don't like to hear because
[49:30] that brings you in order and you want to
[49:32] run and do your own thing and God will
[49:34] have none of it what your parents let
[49:36] you get away with God will not let you
[49:37] get away with You' reap what you Soul do
[49:40] you understand what I'm saying here now
[49:42] okay let's go so but the okay so Jesus
[49:45] in Luke 12:15 says he said unto them
[49:47] take heed and beware of
[49:51] covetousness and sometimes we need to go
[49:53] down deeper into certain words we hear
[49:55] cous and just a word but what is
[49:57] conciousness for a man's life this is
[50:00] Jesus own words now
[50:02] consisted not in the abundance of things
[50:06] which he
[50:07] possessed covetousness is an eager or
[50:10] excessive desire especially for wealth
[50:14] or
[50:16] possessions it is characterized by a
[50:19] strong or imoderate desire for what
[50:22] others
[50:23] have in local terms we say people have
[50:25] long eye
[50:27] they see somebody and they want it to
[50:29] and the Heart start to swell and I want
[50:31] that I want that I want that they don't
[50:33] even know the person get that the person
[50:35] rber Bank you don't even know but he
[50:37] sell drugs and what not but the coveres
[50:39] know they lusting after what somebody
[50:40] else have Jesus said Beware of that why
[50:44] would Jesus say that beware of that in
[50:46] other words he wanted man to reject
[50:50] selfishness and greed and pride to
[50:52] reject it not just talk about it to
[50:54] reject that you don't want that to be
[50:56] part of you
[50:57] you you the one that to be part of you
[51:00] you could you could be yourself you know
[51:02] in your pride and arrogance and thing
[51:03] you know but he will humble you if you
[51:06] are son or if you are a daughter he
[51:09] wouldn't leave in your Folly of your
[51:11] pride he will break you to show you
[51:13] who's the boss oh give the Lord some
[51:17] Praises so Jesus was warning against
[51:21] this thing called
[51:22] covetousness greed and entitlement to
[51:25] possession
[51:28] and he taught that a man life is not
[51:31] measured by material wealth that's how
[51:34] the world train now to say well this one
[51:36] have car this one house swimming pool
[51:38] this one have a plane this one have a
[51:39] rocket and therefore he's up somewhere
[51:41] some of the worst siners than people who
[51:43] had a
[51:47] rocket Matthew 202 says 25 and Jesus
[51:50] called unto them and said ye know that
[51:52] the princes of the Gentiles exercise
[51:54] dominion over them and they that a great
[51:57] exercise Authority upon them but it
[51:59] shall not be so among
[52:02] you whosoever will be among you
[52:05] whosoever will be great among you let
[52:07] him be your
[52:09] minister if you don't understand that
[52:11] let's take the next verse whosoever be
[52:13] Chief among you let him be your
[52:18] servant even as a son of man comparing
[52:21] it came not to be ministered unto but to
[52:24] minister and to give his life a answer
[52:25] for many
[52:27] so Jesus actually taught that through
[52:29] service not through a certain power some
[52:33] people can't wait to get them get them
[52:35] power they trouble you know just I
[52:38] always to say if you want to see what a
[52:40] man get them power or give them
[52:43] money money is power you
[52:47] know so what we said before the the Prem
[52:51] uh brother Kelly sh his testimony was
[52:54] sacrifice versus entitlement and you
[52:57] might find me sticking this thing
[52:58] because this is so important I see a
[53:00] spirit of entitlement upon people and it
[53:04] bothers me I Spirit entitlement on the
[53:06] people in the message in church and it
[53:08] bothers me because you will get
[53:11] disappointed and I'm seeing the hurt of
[53:13] the entitlement Spirit they will get
[53:16] hurt because entitlement bring you on
[53:19] expectation and when that expectation
[53:21] not fulfilled you get
[53:23] disappointed I remember in KY there was
[53:26] a brother well he's deceased now and I
[53:28] used to come from ppine and walking and
[53:30] and things that in order and I to go and
[53:32] get to the well and get water and
[53:34] different thing like that and he have
[53:36] upset me because living up the hill and
[53:38] I find from right there to down there
[53:40] what's the
[53:41] point and afterwards I lower my
[53:43] expectation I said maybe you can't do it
[53:45] my problems or what and afterwards I got
[53:48] no disappointment because I had no
[53:51] expectation so I free myself from him I
[53:55] free myself from expecting him to do a
[53:57] certain thing that I am expecting and
[54:00] getting disappointed every time so when
[54:02] you free yourself and that is why the
[54:03] Bible say for God so love the world why
[54:05] God love us for God so love the world he
[54:07] give his own begotten son why he love us
[54:08] you never know reason why suppose God
[54:10] reason because you're tall and
[54:12] everywhere you trying to be tall
[54:14] now because you're slim everywhere you
[54:16] want to be slim before you're fat every
[54:18] you want to be fat God a give no reason
[54:19] to say well why God so loved the world
[54:21] he gave his only begotten son that
[54:23] whosoever believeth should not perish
[54:25] God just love and that's what love is
[54:27] love just give love does share love Do
[54:29] release Grace love does release Mercy he
[54:31] so love that's all he so love that he
[54:34] give that's his love towards us could we
[54:36] give the Lord some
[54:39] Praises because you don't want you to be
[54:42] under a false expectation to get a great
[54:44] disappointment you have to believe him
[54:46] for his grace and mercy to deliver you
[54:48] and to free you is not what you have
[54:50] done or what you will you will do is
[54:51] what he has already done and he has to
[54:53] do it inside of you that you can give
[54:55] witness of the Grace and the power of
[54:57] the mercy of God we need more
[54:59] testimonies like what brother Kelly
[55:01] [Applause]
[55:03] had because what that reveals is the
[55:05] operation of
[55:07] God do you understand that you up in
[55:10] this way bbing and hubbing and bbing and
[55:12] weaving and and keeping quiet and your
[55:14] under hand and all kind of thing like
[55:16] that that nothing do with God you know
[55:17] when that woman was revealed when Jesus
[55:19] revealed himself to the woman of the
[55:20] well she run and say come see a man she
[55:22] wasn't hesitant and say you know what
[55:24] let better change my dress yes because
[55:26] you look nothing happened to her she one
[55:29] she Dr know she was free to say come see
[55:33] a man who show me all that I did is not
[55:35] this to Christ are you free this morning
[55:38] or do you want to be free this morning
[55:40] God want you to be liberated this
[55:42] morning free from sin free from Fear
[55:44] free from your past free from what your
[55:46] neighbor say Your mother say your father
[55:47] say free from whatever everybody else
[55:49] say free from all that that that you
[55:51] could live and have the Abundant
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:55] Life
[55:59] Hallelujah free to laugh at
[56:02] yourself this the one thing about Donal
[56:06] is that he can't laugh he doesn't laugh
[56:07] at all can't even laugh on
[56:11] itself Donald can't laugh so sacrifice
[56:15] versus entitlement both carries two
[56:18] different mindset sacrifice involves
[56:21] giving up personal desires comfort and I
[56:23] hope you study these things by saying
[56:25] you I hope I'm not speaking to the wind
[56:28] because I'm not speaking because I have
[56:30] nothing else to say you I'm speaking
[56:32] because I believe this is important for
[56:34] you to catch for yourself are you giving
[56:37] up sacrifice involve giving up personal
[56:39] desires what did God ask Abraham to give
[56:42] up his own son that he waited 25 years
[56:44] for and when he Bo know right about 12
[56:47] years old he say offer him up now to
[56:49] make a
[56:51] sacrifice you got to take a blanket the
[56:53] first blanket and cover this and take
[56:55] the first fastest Maxi Chariot and
[57:00] WR I say go this got be you this got be
[57:02] you write it
[57:05] out but Abram knew God he knew God's
[57:09] voice that's why God could tell you
[57:11] don't bring no B foot L off him don't
[57:13] put all kind of animal where what left
[57:15] back trying to give God God said no you
[57:17] have to better than that you have to
[57:19] inspect the lamb if you're bringing a
[57:21] lamb bring one without blemish because
[57:23] it's God you're bringing it to there's
[57:25] not your Governor this is God oh give
[57:28] the Lord some praises and if you are to
[57:30] become a sacrifice God want you to give
[57:32] your best go just give your hand and
[57:34] amen and your mouth going and your head
[57:36] thinking somewhere else give you he want
[57:39] you oh give the Lord a shout he don't
[57:42] want your dress he don't want your tie
[57:43] he don't want your shoes he want you as
[57:46] a sacrifice on his altar
[57:49] [Music]
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:56] this is Sunday you know we here to
[57:59] [Music]
[58:00] worship sacrifice involves giving up
[58:03] personal desires comfort and resources
[58:05] for the benefit of others or a greater
[58:07] cause it comes from a heart of
[58:10] selflessness and humility Romans 121 we
[58:13] read it before I beseech you therefore
[58:14] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[58:17] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[58:19] holy acceptable to God with a reasonable
[58:21] service it's not your body is UN loan to
[58:24] you so you go and tattoo that up you
[58:25] know we're going on on T up God house
[58:27] you go and smoke that up what going on
[58:29] you're get House of good
[58:33] smoking you're boozing you're boozing
[58:36] you're boozing you see what going inside
[58:37] that house and God said that is my
[58:41] hous I give you that house
[58:46] am entitlement entitlement focuses on
[58:49] personal gain and comfort with the
[58:51] belief that one inherently deserves
[58:54] privileges or benefits without
[58:57] necessarily earning
[58:59] them you want a promotion
[59:02] why you want more work or just one more
[59:05] pay everybody could do with more
[59:09] pay but the higher you go is the more
[59:11] work you to do I want to say walk I want
[59:14] to say like like a chicken not work work
[59:18] walk so normal clar or whatever it is
[59:21] you got corporate lad manager then
[59:23] director then man and you're going up
[59:25] higher higher means me more headache
[59:27] hire mean more more more board meetings
[59:30] hire means not 8 to4 no
[59:32] more you can't handle that but go back
[59:35] down the ladder to go to
[59:38] 84 so you feel entitled and that's what
[59:42] I'm to all the Bandit and Crooks you
[59:43] know they enill the entitle to your pay
[59:45] that they working for so they entit to
[59:48] wait for you to get your money to R
[59:51] you do you understand what I'm saying
[59:53] they find work too hard so so they wait
[59:56] for you to work and then they had the
[59:58] gun and they're looking to get on
[1:00:01] alternative employment by rubbing
[1:00:05] you but God is the one who set up work
[1:00:08] isn't that right so watch this so you
[1:00:10] cannot expect to be promoted without
[1:00:12] Desiring the work necessary to go with
[1:00:15] that promotion because if it doesn't
[1:00:17] produce the work to get the promotion
[1:00:19] you are fit for
[1:00:21] demotion you understand that you have
[1:00:24] something in the market say when the
[1:00:25] market is uh over how they say it boy
[1:00:28] when it too high now sometime a stock
[1:00:30] gone too high when a man promote himself
[1:00:32] he gone too high it is due for
[1:00:35] correction only time corrects that are
[1:00:38] bringing back in order so entitlement
[1:00:40] focusing on personal gain comfort with
[1:00:42] the belief that one inherently deserves
[1:00:44] privileges or benefits without
[1:00:46] necessarily earning them this mindset
[1:00:49] focused more on rights and expectation
[1:00:52] rather than on there we go
[1:00:53] responsibilities or obligation to
[1:00:56] towards others it can lead to
[1:00:58] selfishness or an exaggerated sense of
[1:01:01] one's importance and that's why I read
[1:01:03] that scripture do have it here now of
[1:01:05] Jesus was saying when you're invited to
[1:01:06] a wedding take the lowest
[1:01:08] seat and the reason somebody taking the
[1:01:10] higher seat because they seat themselves
[1:01:12] as important so they say but you see
[1:01:15] that seat it tall it high had gold on
[1:01:17] us and I just feel that he kind of seat
[1:01:20] that I supposed to sit and you take your
[1:01:22] cool you relax in the comfort of that
[1:01:24] seat only to find out somebody more
[1:01:26] worthy than
[1:01:27] you the bride
[1:01:30] sister or the bridegroom brother come
[1:01:32] and say excuse me you invited you know
[1:01:35] it's not that you send out but you had
[1:01:37] to go down
[1:01:41] so so Jesus was saying don't carry
[1:01:44] yourself with that support you know who
[1:01:47] I am no I don't know who you are you
[1:01:50] want the dust that God
[1:01:51] say you're born in sin and shape
[1:01:54] iniquity just like everybody else
[1:01:57] you I'm saying no prime minister say God
[1:01:59] you know I am prime
[1:02:01] minister recognize
[1:02:03] that God you know who I am my here long
[1:02:06] God I look at my face last I look very
[1:02:09] pretty God don't see Soul you know and
[1:02:11] if you sin sick the soul that s that God
[1:02:14] not looking at your flesh your height
[1:02:15] your color complexion your race
[1:02:18] country who your father
[1:02:22] is is your mindset one of offering your
[1:02:25] yourself to God as a sacrifice valuing
[1:02:30] humility over self-importance or are you
[1:02:33] expecting to receive without deserving
[1:02:34] it holding on to selfishness and pride
[1:02:38] without doing necessary work watch that
[1:02:40] word work Philippians 2: 34 I'm almost
[1:02:43] finished let nothing be done to Strife
[1:02:44] of V Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let
[1:02:47] each esteem
[1:02:49] other better than themselves look not
[1:02:52] every man on his own things but every
[1:02:54] man also on a things of other okay so
[1:02:56] I'm wrap up with Matthew 20 this the
[1:02:59] parable a form Parable but I want to
[1:03:01] show you something in this Parable for
[1:03:02] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man
[1:03:04] that has a householder that went out
[1:03:06] early in the morning to hire laborers in
[1:03:08] his Vineyard and when he had agreed with
[1:03:10] the laborers watch this a penny a day he
[1:03:14] send them in the vineyard he went out
[1:03:16] about the third hour saw others standing
[1:03:17] idle in the marketplace said to them go
[1:03:19] you into the vineyard whatsoever is
[1:03:21] right I will give it you note he didn't
[1:03:24] tell him a penny
[1:03:26] and they went their way again he went
[1:03:28] out about the sixth and 9th hour did
[1:03:30] likewise about the 11th hour he went out
[1:03:34] from other standing idle said unto them
[1:03:36] why stand he here all day idle they said
[1:03:38] to him because no man had heard us he
[1:03:40] said unto them go ye into the vine and
[1:03:42] whatever is right yes that shall he
[1:03:46] receive he didn't tell them he given
[1:03:48] them a penny so when even was come the
[1:03:52] lord of the vineard watch the words
[1:03:54] sayth unto his ch
[1:03:56] call the
[1:03:57] laborers give them their hire beginning
[1:04:00] from the last unto the first ver n and
[1:04:04] when they came that were hired about the
[1:04:07] L Tower they received Every Man a
[1:04:10] penny but when the first came they
[1:04:13] suppos this is the expectation this is
[1:04:16] the expectation this is the expectation
[1:04:19] that they were entitled to more even
[1:04:21] though the vineyard the lord of the
[1:04:23] master agreed with them for penny that
[1:04:26] was the contract that's what they signed
[1:04:30] for when they came they were H about
[1:04:33] hour they receive every man of Penny
[1:04:34] when the first came they supposed that
[1:04:36] they had received more and likewise
[1:04:37] receive every man of Penny when they had
[1:04:39] received it they
[1:04:41] murmured that
[1:04:43] disappointment when they get trouble
[1:04:46] because you're on expectation to receive
[1:04:48] more because you started early you
[1:04:49] started first but you signed the
[1:04:51] contract that I'm going to be paid a
[1:04:53] penny you have it on paper you have it
[1:04:55] on the
[1:04:56] master but he choose to give you the
[1:04:59] penny he give you the penny that you
[1:05:00] deserve he you give you the penny that
[1:05:02] you agree
[1:05:06] to when they receive it the movement
[1:05:08] against the good man of the house saying
[1:05:10] these last have rought but one
[1:05:14] hour they're just come
[1:05:17] in and thou has made them equal unto
[1:05:20] us so what they're saying they're not
[1:05:22] equal because we walking heart this
[1:05:24] morning
[1:05:27] and these only put in one hour work hear
[1:05:30] the words now but thou has made them
[1:05:32] equal to us which have borne the burden
[1:05:35] and heat of the day and he answered one
[1:05:38] of them and said
[1:05:39] friend is the master speaking and I want
[1:05:42] us to get this to the church this

[1:08:19] ye when ye have
[1:08:21] done all those things which are
[1:08:25] commanded you
[1:08:29] say we are unprofitable
[1:08:32] servants we have done that which was our
[1:08:35] duty to
[1:08:36] do Jesus was telling his own disciples
[1:08:41] what to say in keeping and maintaining
[1:08:44] and having the right mindset yes and the
[1:08:48] Amplified it says even so on your part
[1:08:51] when you have done everything that was
[1:08:53] assigned and commanded you say we are
[1:08:56] unworthy servants possessing no merit
[1:09:00] for we have not gone beyond our
[1:09:02] obligation we have merely done what was
[1:09:04] our duty to
[1:09:07] do so Jesus actually taught humility yes
[1:09:12] sir do you get that he actually taught
[1:09:15] humility having a humble in service

[1:16:47] hand of

[1:16:54] be in a house of God and I want to thank
[1:16:57] you for your prayers and your support um
[1:16:59] certainly as brother mentioned it it's
[1:17:01] good to see sister Karen in the church
[1:17:03] this
[1:17:04] morning it's been about 8 weeks or so
[1:17:07] that she has not been here it was a
[1:17:09] rough trial but God is great amen he's a
[1:17:12] deliverer he's a Healer he's a way maker
[1:17:16] so we thank you for your prayers all the
[1:17:18] greetings all the uh reaching out and
[1:17:20] the questions and the support and you
[1:17:22] know it's it it it means a lot and meant
[1:17:25] a lot and it continues to mean a lot so
[1:17:28] let's go to the word this morning I want
[1:17:31] to read one portion of
[1:17:32] scripture uh from the book of Hebrews a
[1:17:35] very familiar scripture and I'm looking
[1:17:38] for God to do something tremendous in
[1:17:40] our midst this morning so reading
[1:17:42] Hebrews
[1:17:47] 11 from verse one now Faith is the
[1:17:51] substance of things hoped for the
[1:17:53] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:17:57] the elders obtained a good report
[1:18:00] through faith we understand that the
[1:18:02] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:18:05] the word is important your words are
[1:18:06] important God's word is important the
[1:18:09] words were framed by the word of God so
[1:18:12] that things which are seen were not made
[1:18:15] of things which do appear by faith Abel
[1:18:18] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:18:20] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[1:18:23] witness that he was righteous
[1:18:25] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:18:27] being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch
[1:18:31] was translated that he should not see
[1:18:33] death and was not found because God had
[1:18:35] translated him for before his
[1:18:37] translation he had this testimony that
[1:18:40] he pleased God what a testimony to have
[1:18:43] what a testimony I want to have do you
[1:18:44] want to have that testimony that you
[1:18:46] pleased God
[1:18:49] wonderful but without faith it is
[1:18:51] impossible to please him for he that
[1:18:53] cometh to God must must believe that he
[1:18:55] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:18:58] that diligently seek him so not just
[1:19:00] those that seek him but those that
[1:19:02] diligently seek Him by faith Noah being
[1:19:05] warned of God of things not yet as not
[1:19:08] seen as yet moved with fear prepared an
[1:19:12] arc to the saving of his house by the
[1:19:14] which he condemned the world and became
[1:19:16] heir of the righteousness which is by
[1:19:19] Faith by faith Abraham when he was
[1:19:21] called to go out into a place which he
[1:19:23] should have have should after receive
[1:19:26] for an inheritance obeyed and he went
[1:19:28] out not knowing whether he went that's
[1:19:30] what faith does it makes you go places
[1:19:32] not knowing where you're going to end up
[1:19:33] at times by Fai he ajour in the land of
[1:19:37] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:19:39] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:19:41] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[1:19:43] he looked for a city which had
[1:19:45] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:19:48] God through faith also Sarah herself
[1:19:51] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:19:53] was delivered of her child when she was
[1:19:54] was past age because she judged him
[1:19:56] faithful who had promised therefore
[1:19:59] sprang there even of one and him as good
[1:20:01] as dead so many as the stars of the sky
[1:20:04] in multitude and as the sandwiches by
[1:20:07] the seashore
[1:20:08] innumerable these all died in faith not
[1:20:11] having received the promises but having
[1:20:13] seen them a far off were persuaded of
[1:20:16] them and embraced them and confessed
[1:20:18] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:20:20] the earth so so they saw something a far
[1:20:22] off they couldn't access it they
[1:20:24] couldn't touch it they didn't receive
[1:20:26] the promise but they they were persuaded
[1:20:28] with just seeing the promise that was
[1:20:30] enough to keep them going have you seen
[1:20:32] enough to keep you going have you seen
[1:20:34] enough to not backslide have you seen
[1:20:35] enough to not give up they confessed
[1:20:38] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:20:40] the earth for they that say such things
[1:20:42] plainly declare plainly that they seek a
[1:20:44] country and truly if they had been
[1:20:47] mindful of that country from W they came
[1:20:49] out they might have had opportunity to
[1:20:51] have returned but now they desire a
[1:20:53] better country that is a Heavenly in
[1:20:56] other words they looking for a Heavenly
[1:20:57] country Heavenly citizenship Heavenly
[1:21:00] residency wherefore God is not ashamed
[1:21:02] to be called their God for he had
[1:21:04] prepared for them a city by faith
[1:21:06] Abraham when he was tried offered up
[1:21:08] Isaac that he that had received the
[1:21:11] promises offered up his only begotten
[1:21:13] son son of whom it was said that in
[1:21:15] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:21:18] accounting that God was able to raise
[1:21:19] him up even from the dead from whence
[1:21:22] also he he received him in a figure by
[1:21:24] Faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[1:21:26] concerning things to come by faith Jacob
[1:21:29] when he was dying blessed both the sons
[1:21:31] of Joseph and worship leaning upon the
[1:21:33] top of his staff by faith Joseph when he
[1:21:36] died made mention of the departing of
[1:21:38] the children of Israel and gave
[1:21:40] commandment concerning his bones and we
[1:21:42] know that was he say when you leave here
[1:21:43] carry my bones with you because I know a
[1:21:46] Resurrection coming he is saying it by
[1:21:48] faith he knows there's something bigger
[1:21:49] than himself he said don't leave my
[1:21:51] bones here because this is not the place
[1:21:52] where the bones will be Resurrected
[1:21:54] there's not only a Resurrection coming
[1:21:56] but there's a place where the
[1:21:57] resurrection will take place so don't
[1:21:58] leave my bones in this place can the
[1:22:00] church say Amen Hallelujah by faith my
[1:22:05] Moses when he was born was HD three
[1:22:07] months of his parents because they saw
[1:22:09] he was a proper child and they were not
[1:22:12] afraid of the king's commandment so
[1:22:14] Faith removed fear Faith gave them
[1:22:17] courage to do what they had to do by
[1:22:19] faith Moses when he come to years
[1:22:21] refused to be called the son of
[1:22:23] Pharaoh's daughter he said don't call me
[1:22:24] that Hallelujah I may have grown up in
[1:22:27] Pharaoh's house I may have grown up in
[1:22:29] Pharaoh's daughter's house but don't
[1:22:30] call me the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:22:32] because I know who I am I have a
[1:22:34] spiritual identity I have a spiritual
[1:22:36] consciousness can the church say Amen am
[1:22:39] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:22:42] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:22:44] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[1:22:46] the reproach of Christ's greater riches
[1:22:49] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:22:51] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:22:53] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:22:57] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:22:59] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:23:01] through faith he kept the Passover and
[1:23:04] the sprinkling of blood lest he that
[1:23:07] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[1:23:09] them by faith they pass through the Red
[1:23:11] Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians
[1:23:14] are saying to do were drown by Fate the
[1:23:16] walls of Jericho fell down after they
[1:23:19] had compassed about seven days by faith
[1:23:21] the hot Rahab perish not with them
[1:23:24] believed not when she had received the
[1:23:26] spies with peace and what shall I more
[1:23:29] say for the time would fail me to tell
[1:23:31] of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson
[1:23:35] and of jeffa of David also and Samuel
[1:23:38] and of the prophets who through faith
[1:23:40] subdued kingdoms uh wrought
[1:23:42] righteousness uh obtained promises uh
[1:23:44] stopped the mouths of lions uh quenched
[1:23:47] the violence of fire escaped the edge of
[1:23:49] the sword out of weakness were made
[1:23:52] strong wax Valiant in fight turned to
[1:23:55] flight the armies of the aliens women
[1:23:58] received their dead raised to life and
[1:24:00] others were tortured not accepting
[1:24:02] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:24:05] better resurrection and others had trial
[1:24:07] of cural mockings and scourgings yeah
[1:24:10] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[1:24:13] were stoned they were sown aunder they
[1:24:15] were tempted were slain with the sword
[1:24:19] they wondered about in sheep skins and
[1:24:21] goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:24:23] torment
[1:24:24] and listen to what Paul says here of
[1:24:26] whom the world was not worthy in other
[1:24:28] words the world was not worthy of these
[1:24:32] men can the church say Amen the way they
[1:24:35] lived with all of their mistakes with
[1:24:37] occurrence with all of their faults Paul
[1:24:39] is saying this world we in is not worthy
[1:24:41] of the character of these men there's
[1:24:44] something about them that establishes
[1:24:46] that they come from somewhere else that
[1:24:48] this Earthly terrestrial plane we are in
[1:24:51] is not worthy of some people are there
[1:24:53] anybody in anybody in the house this
[1:24:55] morning that the world is not even
[1:24:56] worthy of you being here can the church
[1:24:58] see oh that's a shouting moment right
[1:25:01] there Paul is saying the world was not
[1:25:03] worthy they lived above the world with
[1:25:06] all their mistakes with all their faults
[1:25:08] they lived above the world of whom the
[1:25:10] world was not worthy they wandered in
[1:25:12] deserts and in mountains and in dens and
[1:25:14] caves of the earth and these all having
[1:25:17] obtained a good report through faith
[1:25:19] received under the promise God having
[1:25:21] provided some better thing for us
[1:25:25] there's better than them for us there's
[1:25:27] better than that what they went through
[1:25:29] for us that they without us should not
[1:25:31] be made perfect may the Lord add a
[1:25:33] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:25:34] may be seated in the presence of the
[1:25:36] Lord this morning can we give the Lord a
[1:25:38] hand of Praise

[1:26:07] promise of God by faith without faith it

[1:26:12] start to please God unless you have
[1:26:14] faith to believe that he's a Healer that
[1:26:16] he's a way maker that he's a restorer
[1:26:19] that he's going to help your family I

[1:27:18] was shut and we are here to shut some
[1:27:20] lion's mouth this morning by faith we

[1:27:24] Goliath look at our problem and say the
[1:27:27] same Faith they had we have this morning
[1:27:30] and if they overcame by faith we are
[1:27:32] going to overcome that way also and if
[1:27:34] they did it without what we
[1:27:36] have how much more us they didn't
[1:27:40] receive the promise but we have the
[1:27:42] promises and we are waiting for the
[1:27:43] Fulfillment of every promise that
[1:27:45] belongs to us can the church say
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] hallelujah you know what's amazing about
[1:27:54] Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 count some names
[1:27:58] and if you go through these names every
[1:28:00] one of these names had mistakes and
[1:28:03] failures and problems associated with
[1:28:06] them none of these names with a kangi
[1:28:09] had a perfect walk except
[1:28:12] Enoch Enoch had a testimony that he
[1:28:15] pleased God can the church say Amen
[1:28:18] there's no scripture we could find to
[1:28:19] point a finger to Enoch he was just
[1:28:22] different but everybody else we go
[1:28:23] through them we could find something
[1:28:25] that we could
[1:28:26] identify we could see where Moses fell
[1:28:29] we could see where Samson fell we could
[1:28:31] see where Gideon fell we can see where
[1:28:33] Abraham fell we could see it all through
[1:28:35] the
[1:28:36] scripture but somehow they made it to
[1:28:39] Hebrews
[1:28:40] 11 oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:28:44] Hallelujah whenever you wonder if
[1:28:45] somebody's going to make it Hallelujah I
[1:28:47] can imagine somebody say I wonder if
[1:28:49] Samson going to make it and until Paul
[1:28:51] came and and wrote Hebrews 11 they say
[1:28:53] you know he made
[1:28:54] it can the church say amen and I'm here
[1:28:57] to tell you this morning there's a
[1:28:59] there's an extension of Hebrews 11
[1:29:01] that's being written that's being
[1:29:03] written and there are some more names in
[1:29:05] there because Paul said it's only
[1:29:07] because of time I can't call all the
[1:29:09] names you don't hear me this morning if
[1:29:11] I had more time there' be some more
[1:29:13] names to call oh I I feel religious this
[1:29:17] morning
[1:29:18] oh by faith my name is in there by faith
[1:29:22] your name is in there Hallelujah you
[1:29:24] might look defeated you might look
[1:29:26] frustrated but Faith by faith my name is
[1:29:29] in Hebrews
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:32] 11 hallelujah hallelujah somebody give
[1:29:35] God praise this
[1:29:37] morning
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:42] Hall we could spend a whole service
[1:29:46] talking about the failures of
[1:29:48] Samson we could spend a whole service
[1:29:51] talking about the H at Rahab
[1:29:55] that God loves to take broken
[1:29:58] people people with issues people with
[1:30:01] trouble people who made mistakes people
[1:30:04] who came from bad past and bad history
[1:30:06] people with a messed up resume and put
[1:30:08] them in Hebrews
[1:30:14] 11 Hallelujah as a hero of F I always
[1:30:18] said when I preach on the the the the
[1:30:21] genealogy of Jesus Matthew 1 the book of
[1:30:25] the generation of Jesus Christ the son
[1:30:27] of David the son of Abraham it blew my
[1:30:29] mind because even Abraham with his mic
[1:30:31] wasn't as bad as it would seem as
[1:30:35] David Jesus could have choose whoever
[1:30:37] you want to be born under you know but
[1:30:39] he choos a mess of people for part of
[1:30:42] his lineage so this morning I have a
[1:30:44] message to encourage you to inspire you
[1:30:48] and for us to Rel look at our vows and
[1:30:50] our
[1:30:51] commitments so for a title
[1:30:55] this
[1:30:56] morning by the grace of God everybody
[1:30:59] feel it
[1:31:00] fine
[1:31:01] wonderful a title this morning the
[1:31:06] outlaw who became a
[1:31:11] judge the
[1:31:14] outlaw who
[1:31:16] became a
[1:31:19] judge and we're going to spend some time
[1:31:21] in the Book of Judges this morning
[1:31:24] to pick up some things in there that I
[1:31:26] trust will be a blessing to
[1:31:28] you and an encouragement to you now the
[1:31:32] Book of Judges within there
[1:31:35] has some very critical Biblical
[1:31:38] characters because when you look at
[1:31:39] Hebrews 11 it really Maps out from the
[1:31:41] patriarch all the way down to Rahab so
[1:31:44] it dealt with from Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:31:46] everybody and then there's this bridge
[1:31:49] where he deals with those within judges
[1:31:52] who he chose to call out so Gideon
[1:31:54] Barrack Samson jeffa those were part of
[1:31:56] the judges around 12 or so judges and
[1:31:58] the judges were the bridge between
[1:32:00] Joshua and the Kings so after the last
[1:32:03] judge you have the prophet Samuel and
[1:32:05] you have Saul coming up as the first
[1:32:07] king so you have the Patriarchs all the
[1:32:09] way to Joshua then you have the judges
[1:32:11] then you have the kings that will come
[1:32:12] after everybody with me this morning and
[1:32:15] under the judges men did what it was in
[1:32:17] their own Hearts everybody feeling LED I
[1:32:19] feeling led to do this I feeling led to
[1:32:21] do this and God had to send judges to
[1:32:23] minister to guide to lead and most
[1:32:26] importantly to deal with the cycle of
[1:32:29] rebellion sin idolatry and restoration
[1:32:32] that they went through in the Book of
[1:32:33] Judges so in the Book of Judges you have
[1:32:36] Samson dealing with the
[1:32:37] Philistines you have Gideon dealing with
[1:32:39] the medion nightes all critical pieces
[1:32:42] of the puzzle so this morning we want to
[1:32:44] spend some time talking about
[1:32:46] jeffa because many of us we read him in
[1:32:49] the book of Hebrews but we never really
[1:32:50] spend time looking at this why is jeffa
[1:32:53] there amen that's what I want to know
[1:32:56] why is Jeff's name included in there
[1:32:58] what's so special about jeffa that he
[1:33:00] say and Gideon and bar and jeffa and
[1:33:02] Samson can the church say Amen so we
[1:33:05] want to go to Judges chapter 10 and we
[1:33:09] want to read from verse
[1:33:12] six are you with me this
[1:33:14] morning and the children of Israel did
[1:33:17] Evil again in the sight of the Lord
[1:33:19] again it was the cycle over the last few
[1:33:21] weeks we have been preaching about the
[1:33:22] war of priests the war of altars we have
[1:33:24] been talking about putting away the
[1:33:26] strange Gods we have talking about your
[1:33:28] body being a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] and here it was we are seeing here in
[1:33:32] judges 10 uh 106 and the children of
[1:33:35] Israel did Evil again in the sight of
[1:33:37] the Lord and served I want to watch that
[1:33:40] word served bam and ASAT the gods of
[1:33:44] Syria and the gods of sidon and the gods
[1:33:47] of Moab and the gods of the children of
[1:33:49] Ammon and the gods of the Philistines
[1:33:52] and forsook the Lord and served him not
[1:33:56] amen friends here we find the children
[1:33:58] of Israel after having been delivered
[1:34:00] from Egypt after seeing the Miracles
[1:34:03] after seeing judges already come before
[1:34:06] church Gideon already pass through
[1:34:09] Gideon Ministries already done at this
[1:34:10] point in time dealing with the
[1:34:12] midianites god already has delivered
[1:34:14] them over and over again and here it is
[1:34:17] they are now finding new
[1:34:19] Gods I want to pause there for a minute
[1:34:22] they're finding five different gods to
[1:34:25] worship and if you study in scripture
[1:34:27] and scriptural history and I'm bringing
[1:34:29] this to a point for us to bring some
[1:34:31] Deliverance to somebody in here every
[1:34:33] God that they serve the people enslaved
[1:34:37] them so when they give serving to the
[1:34:41] god of the Philistines the Philistines
[1:34:42] enslaved them when they serve the god of
[1:34:45] the the Ammon the ammonites enslave them
[1:34:48] and I want to say to you this morning
[1:34:50] whatever you serve will control you
[1:34:53] amen if you serve the god of money the
[1:34:56] god of money will will will control you
[1:34:58] if you have some Idol in your life and
[1:35:00] the moment and serving I want you to
[1:35:03] understand what serving means serving
[1:35:04] mean doing the bidding you know so
[1:35:07] you're not serving the lord you're
[1:35:08] serving something so we use the word
[1:35:09] worship and many times we see worship as
[1:35:12] okay you could worship anything anything
[1:35:14] could be your God but serving is the
[1:35:16] acts you do in support of that
[1:35:19] God can we take some time this morning I
[1:35:21] want to make sure because when people
[1:35:23] say I'm not getting a breakthrough and
[1:35:25] I'm not seeing my way who are you
[1:35:27] serving I want you to look at it deeper
[1:35:30] than just is who you worship is your God
[1:35:32] because your servitude is your time your
[1:35:35] effort what you're doing speaks to what
[1:35:37] you're
[1:35:38] serving and whatever you serve controls
[1:35:40] you whatever you serve you bow down to
[1:35:43] them can the church say Amen so I want
[1:35:45] to get it again the children of Israel
[1:35:46] did Evil again in the sight of the Lord
[1:35:48] and served Bim and ASAT and the gods of
[1:35:52] Syria and and the gods of sidon and the
[1:35:55] gods of Moab and the gods of the
[1:35:57] children of Ammon and the gods of the
[1:35:59] Philistines and forsook the Lord and
[1:36:01] served not him and the anger of the Lord
[1:36:04] was hot against Israel and he sold them
[1:36:07] into the hands of the Philistines and
[1:36:09] into the hands of the children of Ammon
[1:36:12] you want to serve the music you want to
[1:36:14] serve the Styles you want to serve the
[1:36:16] Fashions well fine go
[1:36:18] ahead can the church say amen amen and
[1:36:22] that year they vexed and oppressed the
[1:36:24] children of Israel 18 years all the
[1:36:27] children of Israel that were on the
[1:36:29] other side Jordan in the land of the
[1:36:31] amorites which is in
[1:36:33] Gilead moreover the children of Ammon
[1:36:36] passed over Jordan to fight also against
[1:36:38] Judah and against Benjamin and against
[1:36:41] the house of Ephraim so that Israel was
[1:36:44] so
[1:36:45] distressed so because of their sin
[1:36:47] because of what they worship because of
[1:36:49] what they spend their time they end up
[1:36:50] in bondage again saw distress for how
[1:36:52] long for8 years can the church say Amen
[1:36:55] we're building to something and the
[1:36:57] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:37:00] saying we have sinned against
[1:37:02] thee both because we
[1:37:05] have forsaken Our God and also served
[1:37:11] BM and the Lord and I want you to catch
[1:37:14] this friends and the Lord said unto the
[1:37:16] children of Israel did not I deliver you
[1:37:19] from the Egyptians and from the amorites
[1:37:22] from the children of Ammon and from the
[1:37:25] Philistines the sidonians also and the
[1:37:27] amalekites and the moonit did oppress
[1:37:31] you and you cried to me and I delivered
[1:37:33] you out of their hand yet ye have
[1:37:35] forsaken me and served other gods
[1:37:38] wherefore I will deliver you no
[1:37:41] more listen to verse 14 go and cry unto
[1:37:45] the gods which you have chosen let them
[1:37:48] deliver you in the time of your
[1:37:51] tribulation can the Church Say Amen I
[1:37:53] want to pause here for a little bit what
[1:37:55] is God saying why didn't he respond to
[1:37:57] the cry because friends recognizing your
[1:38:00] sin doesn't mean
[1:38:03] repentance having remorse about your sin
[1:38:06] doesn't mean
[1:38:08] repentance acknowledging that you regret
[1:38:10] a decision doesn't mean you actually
[1:38:13] repented crying at the altar and saying
[1:38:17] I am sorry doesn't mean
[1:38:20] repentance anybody with me so God say
[1:38:22] I'm not accepting this cry you have here
[1:38:25] because you're crying because you're
[1:38:27] looking for anybody to help you you
[1:38:29] already want me to help you you know
[1:38:30] you're in trouble so you're crying as if
[1:38:33] you come to me and I'll just help you
[1:38:34] every single time you mess up and you do
[1:38:36] the thing over and over anybody with me
[1:38:38] this
[1:38:39] morning I hope this helped somebody this
[1:38:41] morning you know many of us say well
[1:38:43] Lord I'm really sorry and I regret it
[1:38:45] and I'm coming back to you because
[1:38:46] you're living in regret and remorse but
[1:38:48] you're not repentant because when you're
[1:38:49] repentant repent mean to turn away from
[1:38:52] oh come on now repent mean to change
[1:38:54] your ways so you recognizing I want this
[1:38:58] to stick because this is a big issue
[1:39:00] here you recogniz in your mess up and
[1:39:02] say Lord I recognize that I sin I
[1:39:05] recognize I make a mistake help me God
[1:39:07] say I still listening because I hear
[1:39:08] repentance yet I you see true repentance
[1:39:11] yet you recognizing you sin you having
[1:39:14] remorse about what you did you having
[1:39:16] regret about you did is not repentance
[1:39:19] God is looking for true repentance you
[1:39:22] looking to say Lord turning away today
[1:39:24] I'm willing to cut it off today I'm
[1:39:26] willing to turn around today somebody
[1:39:28] preach back to
[1:39:30] me so let's make sure you get this here
[1:39:33] so the two of Israel Under Pressure why
[1:39:35] are they Under Pressure because they
[1:39:36] serve false gods they throw God out of
[1:39:38] the picture they know better they have
[1:39:41] been through enough God has dealt with
[1:39:43] them enough and they throw God out the
[1:39:44] picture well God say okay fine you serve
[1:39:46] what you want to serve when they are
[1:39:48] under pressure they cry out they say
[1:39:49] Lord help us he said don't call my name
[1:39:52] anymore go to the gods you serve and let
[1:39:54] them help you I want to make sure there
[1:40:01] sticks verse 15 now there's a different
[1:40:04] change that taking place here and the
[1:40:06] children of Israel said unto the Lord we
[1:40:08] have
[1:40:09] sinned do unto us whatsoever seeth good
[1:40:13] unto thee Deliver Us only we pray thee
[1:40:17] this day and now listen to going beyond
[1:40:20] the words because this is where many of
[1:40:22] us miss the Mark friends we it's easy to
[1:40:25] come to the Altar and say Lord help me
[1:40:27] deliver me save me I repent and but you
[1:40:30] you have every intention of going back
[1:40:32] to do the same
[1:40:35] thing look what it took for God to
[1:40:37] respond in verse 16 and they put away
[1:40:40] the strange Gods from among
[1:40:44] them can I say that one more time and
[1:40:46] they put away the strain Gods from among
[1:40:49] them and serve the Lord and his soul
[1:40:52] talking about the Lord was grieved for
[1:40:55] the misery of Israel so only when they
[1:40:57] put away the strange Gods God say okay
[1:40:59] now now I can get involved because the
[1:41:01] first time you came to me you were still
[1:41:03] living with the gods oh you don't hear
[1:41:04] me this morning the first time you came
[1:41:07] for me to pray for you you're still
[1:41:08] mining the situation but when you're
[1:41:11] willing to put away these strange Gods
[1:41:13] Noah could intervene and and heal you
[1:41:15] and and and wipe your tears and bring
[1:41:17] Deliverance to your home and to your
[1:41:18] family so brother Anthony preached about
[1:41:20] it we've been preaching about it are you
[1:41:22] ready to put away the strange Gods
[1:41:24] anything that is strange we don't want
[1:41:26] no strange gods in your life no strange
[1:41:28] gods in your home no strange gods in
[1:41:30] your family no strange clothes no
[1:41:33] strange music no strange forms of
[1:41:35] worship no strange Idols put away the
[1:41:38] strange God so that God could operate in
[1:41:40] your life oh can somebody preach back to
[1:41:42] me you want to see the power of God true
[1:41:45] repentance means putting away the
[1:41:47] strange Gods you have to say I'm not
[1:41:49] going that way anymore I'm not going to
[1:41:51] do that thing anymore I'm walking away
[1:41:54] from the world can the church say
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] hallelujah one time I want to preach a
[1:42:00] message on the emotions of God because
[1:42:02] God gets happy you know he gets sad he
[1:42:05] gets upset God in in Genesis say he
[1:42:08] repented he made man because what he saw
[1:42:10] was not what he wanted to see the sin
[1:42:12] had reached him and here it was God
[1:42:13] reached a point of frustration he said
[1:42:15] your one prayer your one prayer go to
[1:42:16] the gods who you serve in until they
[1:42:18] came with true
[1:42:20] repentance is there anybody this morning
[1:42:22] I want have true repentance you're
[1:42:24] really willing to throw the worldly
[1:42:26] clothes out and the worldly friends out
[1:42:28] and the worldly relationships out throw
[1:42:30] away forication throw away adultery
[1:42:33] those are all gods throw away the music
[1:42:35] and his sty and the fashion and your
[1:42:37] idea could be your God too you know oh
[1:42:39] yes your feeling could be a God your
[1:42:41] interpretation could be a God your job
[1:42:44] could be a God your idea could be a God
[1:42:46] because you're serving that and not
[1:42:47] serving the word itself but the moment
[1:42:50] they say we putting away the strange
[1:42:52] gods and God to see it that is not God
[1:42:54] don't want an explanation of what you do
[1:42:56] know he wants to see action this morning
[1:42:58] he want to see you put fire in your home
[1:43:01] he wants to see you at your altar he
[1:43:03] want to see you praying that's how you
[1:43:05] show God repentance oh you don't hear me
[1:43:06] this morning repentance is not a phrase
[1:43:09] repentance is not a word repentance is
[1:43:12] not saying Lord I'm sorry he wants to
[1:43:14] see your change that on the inside you
[1:43:16] really want to change or you don't hear
[1:43:18] me this morning I want this to stick to
[1:43:21] somebody you know how much time people
[1:43:23] come to the Altar and his lip service
[1:43:25] and they intend I want to say it again
[1:43:27] they intend to go and live in sin they
[1:43:29] intend to go back into pornography they
[1:43:31] intend to go back into fornication they
[1:43:33] intend to go back into drinking smoking
[1:43:36] lying whatever it is and God is saying
[1:43:38] away with it you want to serve those
[1:43:40] Gods serve those Gods but if you want my
[1:43:44] Deliverance get away those strange Gods
[1:43:47] burn the strange Gods clean out your
[1:43:50] life clean out your home throw the movie
[1:43:53] out throw the books out whatever it is
[1:43:55] that's taking you away from serving the
[1:43:57] Living
[1:43:59] God burn it today I want to see you do
[1:44:02] it I'm not coming to help you God is not
[1:44:04] turning your heart away from the strange
[1:44:06] Gods let me say that again young people
[1:44:08] God is not coming to turn your heart
[1:44:10] from the strange Gods you have to want
[1:44:12] it you have to say Lord I don't want to
[1:44:14] live that way and I'm making a change
[1:44:16] there are some people you got to delete
[1:44:18] their phones their phone numbers from
[1:44:19] your phone there are some things you got
[1:44:21] to stop doing you got to do what ever it
[1:44:23] take to get the Strange God out of your
[1:44:26] heart out of your mind out of your life
[1:44:29] can the church say
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:33] amen that's that's true
[1:44:36] repentance true repentance Allowing God
[1:44:39] to
[1:44:40] work and the moment God saw it his
[1:44:44] emotions his feeling about them change
[1:44:47] the Bible said because before this he
[1:44:49] wasn't at grief but the moment verse 16
[1:44:52] and the put away the strange Gods from
[1:44:54] among them and serve the Lord oh my and
[1:44:58] his soul his soul was grieved for the
[1:45:01] misery of Israel it was God who allowed
[1:45:04] them to go into bondage because of the
[1:45:06] way they were living but the moment he
[1:45:07] saw true repentance with occurrence his
[1:45:10] soul began to grieve for the misery so
[1:45:13] you mean there are some people in misery
[1:45:14] that God isn't grieving
[1:45:18] about because they haven't truly
[1:45:20] repented yet so God still waiting to
[1:45:23] feel something about them because they
[1:45:25] haven't reached the point of
[1:45:28] repentance why didn't they do it after
[1:45:30] the first year or the second year or the
[1:45:33] third year they were taking pressure
[1:45:35] until it became too much it was only
[1:45:37] after 18 years and and we could take a
[1:45:39] lot of stress and pressure you know and
[1:45:41] that's why I say some people have to go
[1:45:42] through more pain to bring them to the
[1:45:45] Lord that's why B Bram say a love to get
[1:45:47] you desperate then conditions will don't
[1:45:50] wait till 18 years to reach your
[1:45:52] breaking point to start to call upon the
[1:45:54] Lord if you need the Lord call upon him
[1:45:56] today he wants to hear you and he wants
[1:45:59] to see you do something about your
[1:46:02] situation can the church say
[1:46:04] Amen anybody in the house this
[1:46:07] morning can we continue a
[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:13] bit true
[1:46:16] repentance verse 17 and then the
[1:46:19] children of Ammon were gathered together
[1:46:21] and encamped in Gilead and the children
[1:46:25] of Israel assembled themselves together
[1:46:28] and encamped in mespa and the people and
[1:46:32] princes of Gilead said one to another
[1:46:35] what man is he that will begin to fight
[1:46:38] against the children of Ammon he shall
[1:46:40] be head over all the inhabitants of
[1:46:43] Gilead oh my goodness so now they're
[1:46:45] ready to fight for 18 years but the
[1:46:47] George is sitting on there under
[1:46:48] pressure but they have Cried unto the
[1:46:50] Lord and they feel a wrestle in the mber
[1:46:52] retree they feel the season is changing
[1:46:55] and they say is there anybody in the
[1:46:57] house who could fight against the armies
[1:46:59] of the enemy is there a man among us is
[1:47:01] there a great warrior among us we know
[1:47:04] about Warrior Joshua we know about the
[1:47:06] warrior Gideon we know what we went
[1:47:08] through but we're looking for somebody
[1:47:09] this morning who is brave enough who's
[1:47:12] willing enough to take the fight to the
[1:47:14] enemy we feel the time has come we have
[1:47:17] put away the strange Gods we have
[1:47:19] cleaned up our houses we have restored
[1:47:21] the altars we are looking for God to do
[1:47:24] something is there anybody in the house
[1:47:27] who could fight for us and if this man
[1:47:29] could fight for us he can lead us can
[1:47:32] the church say Amen what a position to
[1:47:35] be in to know that you have put away the
[1:47:37] strange Gods you have clean up your life
[1:47:40] Your Heart Is Right your house in order
[1:47:42] you wake up in the morning there's a joy
[1:47:44] in your heart you're praying every day
[1:47:46] you know your Lord is with you and
[1:47:47] you're just looking for somebody who can
[1:47:49] lead you into battle you're looking for
[1:47:51] King Jesus you're looking for the
[1:47:53] captain of the host because they know
[1:47:55] the testimonies of the old days uh how
[1:47:57] the Lord LED them they know what it was
[1:47:59] to be delivered from the amalekites and
[1:48:01] the Hittites and the jebusites but you
[1:48:03] can't go into war without a general oh
[1:48:06] God sent us a general this morning who
[1:48:08] could lead us into battle can the church
[1:48:10] say
[1:48:12] amen
[1:48:14] hallelujah
[1:48:16] hallelujah oh my my my my my my my so
[1:48:20] the the FI you may be see the Fate of
[1:48:22] the people were
[1:48:24] Rising because they know God had to move
[1:48:26] among them again because the moment you
[1:48:29] move the strange Gods from your life you
[1:48:30] start to feel the presence of God come
[1:48:32] back in your house oh come on somebody
[1:48:34] preach back to me light and dark can't
[1:48:36] live in the same house but the moment
[1:48:38] you put the strange gos out you begin to
[1:48:40] feel the rustle in the mberry tree you
[1:48:42] begin to hear the still Small Voice you
[1:48:45] begin to feel it in the atmosphere oh
[1:48:48] come on
[1:48:51] now and then the prayer changed the
[1:48:54] prayer all along was Lord Deliver Us the
[1:48:57] Lord help us Lord we need a touch but
[1:48:59] now the prayer changed so who will go
[1:49:00] for us who will fight for us who will
[1:49:03] lead us into battle we are ready to go
[1:49:06] and fight we know who we are but we need
[1:49:08] a general God send us a general this
[1:49:10] morning Hallelujah somebody give what a
[1:49:12] shout of praise
[1:49:16] [Applause]
[1:49:24] Hallelujah so it is against this
[1:49:27] backdrop we enter judges
[1:49:30] 11 to meet a man called
[1:49:36] jeffa judges 11 and verse
[1:49:39] one now jeffa the
[1:49:42] gileadite was a mighty man of
[1:49:45] Allah Lord give us Mighty Men of
[1:49:48] Allah Hallelujah men who Not Afraid men
[1:49:51] who not ashamed men who could fight the
[1:49:54] good fight of Fate men who are
[1:49:56] warriors
[1:49:58] Hallelujah
[1:50:01] Glory now jeffa the gileadite was a
[1:50:04] mighty man of
[1:50:06] Allah I want to get this any he
[1:50:08] Amplified as well because there's some
[1:50:11] things we want to bring out here that I
[1:50:15] think is important for us to ponder on
[1:50:18] this morning are you with me you're here
[1:50:19] for the you're here for the day right
[1:50:27] now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man
[1:50:30] of Valor and he was the son of a hot yes
[1:50:35] he was the son of a
[1:50:40] prostitute and Gilead begat
[1:50:45] jeffa and Gilead's wife bear him sons
[1:50:49] and his wife's Sons grew up and they
[1:50:51] Thrust out Jeff
[1:50:54] and said unto him Thou shalt not inherit
[1:50:56] in our father's
[1:50:58] house for thou art the son of a strange
[1:51:04] woman so here we have a young man as it
[1:51:08] were who has a natural aptitude to be a
[1:51:13] fighter but his birth is under some
[1:51:16] troubling
[1:51:18] circumstances he don't fit the mold of
[1:51:20] the of the true son of soil as it
[1:51:23] were he's the son of a prostitute and
[1:51:27] the reason I want to call it the outlaw
[1:51:29] who became a judge is because under the
[1:51:31] law in Deuteronomy it says in
[1:51:33] Deuteronomy 232 a
[1:51:37] bastard shall not enter the congregation
[1:51:40] of the Lord even to his 10th
[1:51:43] Generation Hallelujah shall he not enter
[1:51:46] into the congregation of the Lord so not
[1:51:48] only is he son of a prostitute but he's
[1:51:50] an entitled to title he can't qualify
[1:51:53] for land he not allowed to go into the
[1:51:56] temple in the way others could because
[1:51:58] he have a bad
[1:51:59] birth now I want to touch on something
[1:52:01] here because he couldn't control his
[1:52:04] birth he had nothing to do with how he
[1:52:07] was born you had nothing to do with how
[1:52:09] you end up
[1:52:13] here can the church say
[1:52:16] amen and because of his resume because
[1:52:21] of the Circ some sances of his bir they
[1:52:23] say we don't want you around
[1:52:30] know verse three then jeffa fled from
[1:52:33] his Brethren they say get out of here we
[1:52:37] don't want you here we don't want to
[1:52:38] inherit no land belong to you you're not
[1:52:41] supposed to be in your house who you use
[1:52:43] use a half brother you're not really a
[1:52:45] full brother you talk about pressure you
[1:52:46] know people could
[1:52:51] be then fled from his Breen and dwelt in
[1:52:54] the land of
[1:52:57] tub and there
[1:53:02] gathered with a punch and they were
[1:53:05] gathered vain men to jeffa in the
[1:53:08] Amplified it says then jeffa fled from
[1:53:11] his brothers and lived in a Land of tub
[1:53:13] and
[1:53:14] worthless and unprincipled men gathered
[1:53:18] around jeffa and went out on raage with
[1:53:21] him
[1:53:22] so pushing jeffa out of the house turned
[1:53:25] jeffa into a real bad boy jeffa is what
[1:53:29] you would call a community
[1:53:31] leader a gang
[1:53:35] leader he's a bad man he big he's a
[1:53:39] valiant he's a the Bible is listen when
[1:53:41] the Bible say was a mighty man of Valor
[1:53:43] that not just a man of Valor a mighty
[1:53:45] man of Valor that's how it start judges
[1:53:48] 11 before you go down to his pedigree
[1:53:50] and his history and his family line you
[1:53:52] know he's a bad man he's a big man he's
[1:53:54] a man if he's your friend you want him
[1:53:55] to be your
[1:53:56] friend but if he's your enemy you don't
[1:53:59] want him to be your enemy because he
[1:54:00] could beat up real people can the church
[1:54:02] say amen and against this backdrop and I
[1:54:04] want you to contextualize it that's why
[1:54:06] we read Hebrews 11 because this bad man
[1:54:09] this gang leader this community leader
[1:54:12] this man as we say in Trinidad was with
[1:54:14] a bunch of wless men that's what the
[1:54:15] Bible
[1:54:17] says and God moved this man from judges
[1:54:20] and put him into the book of Hebrews
[1:54:23] you tell me my God can't take anybody
[1:54:26] with any background with any story your
[1:54:29] birth your history your resume your what
[1:54:31] you went through what you do wrong the
[1:54:33] Bible said he went and raided he to rob
[1:54:35] people he to beat up people he to
[1:54:37] torment people he a terrorize
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:43] people whether it was his desire to be
[1:54:45] had bad boy or not we don't know but we
[1:54:47] know his family pushed him and sometime
[1:54:50] people push people into a situation
[1:54:52] where have no choice or you don't hear
[1:54:54] me this morning whatever it was jeffa
[1:54:57] was no longer welcome in his own
[1:55:04] home anybody ever studied this
[1:55:08] story JEA fled from his bedroom fled is
[1:55:12] not running fled is
[1:55:16] like he he got out of
[1:55:18] it he had to escape lived in the land of
[1:55:22] tub and worthless and unprincipled men
[1:55:26] gathered around jeffa and went out on
[1:55:27] raids with him that's in the
[1:55:30] Amplified went out with him that went
[1:55:32] out with him mean he went to do bad
[1:55:34] things he went to terrorize people as
[1:55:37] the say
[1:55:39] goes so it's against his backdrop that
[1:55:42] we go into verse four and it came to
[1:55:45] pass in process of time that the
[1:55:47] children of Ammon made war against
[1:55:50] Israel and it was so that when the
[1:55:53] children of Ammon made war against
[1:55:56] Israel the Elders of Gilead went to
[1:55:59] fetch jeffa out of the land of
[1:56:02] tuba so brother George I want you to see
[1:56:04] this the same brother who couldn't come
[1:56:06] to church with them the same brother who
[1:56:08] they say you can't inherit nothing you
[1:56:11] can't eat at the table you have to eat
[1:56:13] outside you're not part of the family
[1:56:15] you're big by a that bad go outside all
[1:56:17] of that he grew up
[1:56:20] with when waterm flower but the
[1:56:23] Ashby and these ammonites putting
[1:56:27] pressure on the children of Israel the
[1:56:28] elders say here this now you know that
[1:56:30] boy used to be
[1:56:32] here bad
[1:56:34] boy the trouble The Outlaw he out there
[1:56:37] terrorizing people now send they send
[1:56:40] the deacons know they send the
[1:56:44] elders they say go and find jeffa and
[1:56:48] tell jeffa we need JEA
[1:56:53] what an encouragement friends and this
[1:56:55] is so many ways to look at this there's
[1:56:57] something of value you have no matter
[1:56:59] where you at there's value in your life
[1:57:01] no matter what situation you end up in
[1:57:03] there's value can I say that again
[1:57:06] there's value you have
[1:57:08] value so while the world is looking at
[1:57:11] jeffa as an outlaw as a terrorist
[1:57:13] there's still value in
[1:57:18] jeffa this is just a little bible study
[1:57:20] to encourage you this
[1:57:24] morning and it was so that when the
[1:57:26] children of Israel made war against
[1:57:28] Israel the the the children of Ammon
[1:57:30] made war against Israel the Elders of
[1:57:31] Gilead went to fetch jeffa out of the
[1:57:33] land of to they themselves venture out
[1:57:35] of the comfort of Gilead went to the
[1:57:38] land of to and say all you know all you
[1:57:40] know who I looking for I looking for a
[1:57:41] big man he he's strong he tall he's go
[1:57:44] by name

[1:57:47] know who jeffa
[1:57:49] is you sure you want to going to talk to
[1:57:51] jeffa I imagine the
[1:57:53] ERS you looking oh you looking for the
[1:57:55] baddest man in
[1:57:59] top we looking for jeffa they invite
[1:58:02] jeffa to talk to them they went there we
[1:58:04] say we you say you know when people
[1:58:05] strange people come into a community

[1:58:26] need to meet anybody in this street so
[1:58:28] here it is them Elders brother George
[1:58:30] driving down the road into tub and they
[1:58:32] looking for a junior Batman they're
[1:58:33] looking for the head of the Batman
[1:58:35] themselves because jeffa was the leader
[1:58:37] this who you looking about Jeff they
[1:58:38] said we don't know who these guys are
[1:58:41] and I can imagine I wonder but the clar
[1:58:42] when jeffa see them
[1:58:44] coming what ran through Jeff's mind
[1:58:47] because just like Joseph he had a reason
[1:58:50] to say but look at these what men who
[1:58:53] supposed to be Godly men now I sure they
[1:58:55] only come in here because they want
[1:58:57] [Applause]
[1:58:58] something they never did like I us to go
[1:59:00] to church there you know and nobody used
[1:59:01] to greet me and they us I used to always

[1:59:59] out we don't know about the judge we
[2:00:02] don't know about the C of Jud say
[2:00:04] Brothers let me talk at the side now I
[2:00:05] don't want them bad boys to hear what we
[2:00:07] talking
[2:00:08] about Hallelujah I don't want them to
[2:00:10] know I'm really a Christian on the
[2:00:12] inside inside there's something bubbling
[2:00:13] in my soul but it's just because I felt
[2:00:15] rejected I was out here doing what I
[2:00:17] doing but I always knew on the inside
[2:00:19] there's something inside of me that kind
[2:00:21] of kept
[2:00:22] [Applause]
[2:00:23] anybody with me this
[2:00:27] morning hlj but look at the contrast
[2:00:30] from a man who is rejected he is
[2:00:32] despised he can't fit in he don't belong
[2:00:34] your mother was a hoe and that is what
[2:00:36] they would have said to
[2:00:43] him and they said unto jeffa come and be
[2:00:46] our captain that we may fight with the
[2:00:49] children of Ammon
[2:00:52] amen now I want you to see something
[2:00:54] very peculiar about this particular
[2:00:56] judge if you look back at the story of
[2:00:59] Gideon who called Gideon the Bible said
[2:01:01] an angel of the Lord came to Gideon as a
[2:01:05] judge he was called by an Angel Samson
[2:01:08] was born with a Nazarite vow because the
[2:01:10] angel came and speak to his parents not
[2:01:12] so so there are other judges between the
[2:01:15] judges dispensation where it was clear
[2:01:18] that God was involved at the very
[2:01:20] beginning of the story but here we see a
[2:01:23] man we see no mention of God calling him
[2:01:25] at the beginning of his story oh you
[2:01:27] don't hear me this morning I feel more a
[2:01:30] connection with jeffa than any other
[2:01:32] judge because there was no angel came
[2:01:34] and talked to me at the beginning of my
[2:01:35] journey I was a bad boy and God came and
[2:01:38] found me somebody preached back to
[2:01:42] me Samson had an angel come and talk to
[2:01:45] his parents you had an angel come and
[2:01:47] talk to your parents you had an angel
[2:01:49] come and meet you but God is able to
[2:01:51] take back Boys Bad Girls people who
[2:01:53] messed up people who made mistakes
[2:01:55] people who walked away people who

[2:02:35] seven I I would like to believe that at
[2:02:37] this point Jeff has pulled away from his
[2:02:40] whole
[2:02:41] gang because they could really
[2:02:43] understand this conversation here
[2:02:45] because here je jeffa is now being seen
[2:02:47] as
[2:02:48] vulnerable but a punch no Community
[2:02:50] leader no gang leader I want to be seen
[2:02:52] as
[2:02:53] vulnerable you have to you have to put
[2:02:55] on a good show even Joseph when he saw
[2:02:57] his brothers the B say he went in the
[2:02:58] back and cry wash your face and and then
[2:03:00] come back out because no leader lies to
[2:03:02] show vulnerability anybody with
[2:03:05] me so here jeffa in verse 7 saying and
[2:03:08] jeffa said unto the Elders of Gilead did
[2:03:11] not you hate

[2:03:54] I can't be even a leader I can't belong
[2:03:56] in the
[2:03:57] tribe but because you're under so much
[2:03:59] pressure you willing to break the
[2:04:01] law to bring an
[2:04:03] outlaw into the
[2:04:06] law anybody with me this
[2:04:12] morning and the elders you have to trust
[2:04:14] how many appreciate the elders
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:24] the elders
[2:04:26] says and the Elders of Gilead said unto
[2:04:29] Jeff therefore we have return unto thee
[2:04:33] now that thou mayest go with us and
[2:04:37] fight against the children of Ammon and
[2:04:39] be our head over all the inhabitants of
[2:04:42] Gilead in the Amplified the Elders of
[2:04:44] Gilead said to jeffa this is why we have
[2:04:47] turned to you now that that you may go
[2:04:49] at us and fight the ammonites and become
[2:04:51] h over all the inhabitants of Gilead the
[2:04:54] son of a prostitute who was rejected
[2:04:56] from his home who had no right to title
[2:04:58] or inheritance now being given the
[2:05:00] opportunity to sit as CEO of the entire
[2:05:04] [Applause]

[2:05:11] more because this thing have some some
[2:05:15] thing in here we need to finish you
[2:05:17] can't just stop halfway we need to we
[2:05:20] need to go all the way to the end of
[2:05:21] this thing today all
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:26] right verse n and jeffa said unto the
[2:05:29] Elders of Gilead if you bring me
[2:05:32] home I like how he still call it home

[2:05:47] was home is always over there they
[2:05:50] rejected me there but that is is my home
[2:05:53] there's no place like home that's why we
[2:05:55] have a homecoming service can the church
[2:05:58] say
[2:05:59] amenallah and jeffa said unto the Elders
[2:06:02] of Gilead if you bring me home again to

[2:06:24] will I really be ahead veryy you say

[2:06:32] he is a man who not qualified for the
[2:06:33] job being given a the best job without
[2:06:35] he didn't apply for the job this is head
[2:06:38] hunting at his very best for anybody in
[2:06:41] HR this is the biggest head hunting you
[2:06:42] could find in scriptural and historical
[2:06:45] history the hiring of jeffa for the role
[2:06:48] of CEO or leader of the Gilead
[2:06:56] verse 10 and the Elders of Gilead s
[2:06:58] jeffa the Lord be witness between
[2:07:01] us if we do not so according to thy
[2:07:04] words in other words the Lord is the
[2:07:06] witness that if you come to fight with
[2:07:08] us you will be the leader the Lord is
[2:07:10] the one signing off this thing can the
[2:07:13] church say amen I don't know how jeffa

[2:12:04] his glory god wanted a bad man for this
[2:12:09] role when God wanted to write the bulk
[2:12:11] of the New Testament he wanted an orator
[2:12:13] he wanted a writer he wanted an academy
[2:12:15] called Paul who sat at the feet of gel
[2:12:18] Paul's history helped him fit the role
[2:12:21] that God put him in everything you are

[2:12:26] role that God wants to put you in don't
[2:12:28] be discouraged with your journey don't
[2:12:30] be discouraged with how God take you

[2:13:00] because of my past I can't be vexed with
[2:13:02] you God allow you to go through that to
[2:13:04] build you a certain way to fit a certain
[2:13:07] piece of this great puzzle
[2:13:09] [Music]
[2:13:23] so the bad man
[2:13:24] jeffa they're watching him now because
[2:13:27] you have to let a leader lead when it
[2:13:28] put him to
[2:13:31] lead you can't give a man leadership and
[2:13:33] then tell him you're not leading you
[2:13:35] can't ask him how you doing it how you
[2:13:36] do how your high meal lead right so the
[2:13:40] first thing but the punch they expect
[2:13:41] Jeff to do is to use the same bad boy
[2:13:47] tactics see tomorrow you running up in
[2:13:49] there
[2:13:51] strap up everybody strap
[2:13:58] up let me go strap up ready soon could
[2:14:01] you imagine more punch the moment reach
[2:14:04] he say strap up let me go
[2:14:08] ready that's how that
[2:14:10] Trin a rich what you carrying let me go
[2:14:15] ready no look at the measure of
[2:14:19] leadership and character from this
[2:14:22] outlaw verse
[2:14:24] 12 Jeff because and again true scripture
[2:14:28] you really have to be anointed and
[2:14:29] inspired know the bad man s to operate
[2:14:33] like a
[2:14:36] diplomat jeffa went to
[2:14:42] arbitration before he went to
[2:14:45] war anybody with me this morning so
[2:14:48] verse 12 and jeffa sent Messengers
[2:14:51] unto the king of the children of Ammon
[2:14:54] saying what hast thou to do with me he
[2:14:57] already claimed ownership of the whole
[2:14:58] land
[2:15:03] now he
[2:15:06] said what H has thou to do with me that
[2:15:09] thou had come against me to fight in my
[2:15:14] land yesterday you robbing people for
[2:15:17] their
[2:15:18] stuff today you talking about my land
[2:15:21] fighting me and here going himself
[2:15:24] brother CL he send his
[2:15:27] lawyers he send his Messengers he say
[2:15:30] let's try the Diplomatic way first
[2:15:33] because if it's War they want it's War
[2:15:34] they going to get but let's start the
[2:15:36] Diplomatic way
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:40] first anybody here with me this
[2:15:42] morning and the king of the children of
[2:15:45] Ammon so jeffa start the war on a
[2:15:48] dialogue level he leave Gilead yet he
[2:15:52] leave his seat he s down there and need
[2:15:53] to go to the king and tell him jeffa is
[2:15:55] here this is my land this is my
[2:15:58] territory my jurisdiction I'm leader and
[2:16:00] Captain as of this morning I've been
[2:16:03] appointed ask the king of Ammon under
[2:16:05] what Authority he come to challenge me
[2:16:07] this morning can the church say
[2:16:11] Amen verse 13 and the king of the
[2:16:13] children of Ammon answered unto the
[2:16:15] messengers of
[2:16:17] jeffa because Israel took away my land
[2:16:20] this is this is the king of ammon's
[2:16:22] response because Israel took away my
[2:16:25] land when they came up out of Egypt from
[2:16:30] Anon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan
[2:16:33] now therefore restor these lands again
[2:16:37] peaceably so the king of Ammon say well
[2:16:40] here this now just give us the land
[2:16:43] quietly we don't need to
[2:16:46] fight we don't need to fight about this
[2:16:49] I claiming This Is My Land you claim
[2:16:51] this is your land but I want to tell you
[2:16:53] I want to go back in history to identify
[2:16:55] that when Israel took my land they came
[2:16:58] out of Egypt from Anon even unto Jabbok
[2:17:01] and unto Jordan now therefore restore
[2:17:03] these lands again
[2:17:06] peacefully and this is why friends you
[2:17:08] have to know the word that applies to
[2:17:12] you Jesus under trial could say it is
[2:17:15] written it is written it is also written
[2:17:17] you have to know the legal right under
[2:17:20] which you can make claim for you and
[2:17:21] your family you know because this
[2:17:23] becomes a legal case remember the devil
[2:17:24] is the accuser is a living court case we
[2:17:27] are in every day you know the devil is
[2:17:28] the one accusing so you have to
[2:17:30] understand the law which is the written
[2:17:32] word to be able to counteract his
[2:17:35] arguments so when that come back with
[2:17:37] that
[2:17:38] now verse 14 and jeffa send Messengers
[2:17:41] again unto the king of the children of
[2:17:44] Ammon and said unto him thus saith jeffa
[2:17:51] now there are so many types in this
[2:17:52] because this is not this is not D say
[2:17:53] the Lord D say
[2:17:57] Jeff and what this underscores is as bad
[2:18:00] man as jeffa was jeffa knew line by line
[2:18:04] the historical word of their
[2:18:07] standing all the banditry all the gang
[2:18:10] leader thing don't change you know much
[2:18:11] people like me to backslide and when I
[2:18:14] talk to them they say you know the
[2:18:15] Rapture coming and are watching them
[2:18:17] because the word lock up in them the
[2:18:19] word lock up in them they know the word
[2:18:21] know the word has been sewn in their
[2:18:23] heart they could be And when they see it
[2:18:25] they kind of get you know I coming back
[2:18:26] and I know that there's a great move to
[2:18:28] come and they said hit you the thing the
[2:18:29] thing lock up inside that way the word
[2:18:31] inside
[2:18:33] there they say the door to be before the
[2:18:36] door shut I'll be in
[2:18:37] there brother don't take chances get in
[2:18:40] there
[2:18:40] now don't just know the word and do
[2:18:43] anything about it better getting now
[2:18:44] before the horrible plague
[2:18:47] strike because jeffa didn't learn the
[2:18:50] history in the last 24
[2:18:52] hours he had to have known it to craft
[2:18:55] this response you can't become a lawyer
[2:18:57] overnight even with ch GPT you cannot do
[2:18:59] it
[2:19:03] overnight so he can learn this so JEA is
[2:19:06] speaking from training and Revelation he
[2:19:09] say and and verse 14 and jeffa sent
[2:19:11] Messengers unto the king of the children
[2:19:13] of
[2:19:13] Ammon and S him thus say jeffa Israel
[2:19:17] took not away the land of Moab nor the
[2:19:20] land of the children of Amron but when
[2:19:22] Israel came up from Egypt and walked
[2:19:25] through the Wilderness unto the Red Sea
[2:19:27] and came to cadish you see how he he
[2:19:30] said to preach a message there for them
[2:19:32] and then Israel sent Messengers unto the
[2:19:34] king of Edom saying let me I pray the
[2:19:37] pass through thy land but the king of
[2:19:38] Edom would not hearken there too and in
[2:19:40] like manner they sent unto the king of
[2:19:42] Moab but he would not consent and Israel
[2:19:45] Abode in Kadesh we had to stay there
[2:19:47] because nobody wanted us to pass then
[2:19:49] they went along through the Wilderness
[2:19:51] and compassed the land of Edom and the
[2:19:54] land of Moab and came by the east side
[2:19:56] of the land of Moab in other words JEA
[2:19:59] have a map in his mind of the exact
[2:20:01] Journey that we took to be here this
[2:20:02] morning and pitch on the other side of
[2:20:05] anon but came not within the border of
[2:20:07] Moab for Anan was the border of
[2:20:10] Moab can we go on and Israel sent
[2:20:13] messages unto seon King of the amorites
[2:20:16] the king of heshbon and Israel said unto
[2:20:19] him let us pass we pray thee through thy
[2:20:21] land unto my
[2:20:23] place but seon trusted not Israel to
[2:20:27] pass through his Coast but seon start
[2:20:30] the thing gathered all his people
[2:20:33] together and pitched in Jes and fought
[2:20:36] against
[2:20:36] Israel we were asking for passage and
[2:20:39] they start a
[2:20:41] war anybody with me and the Lord God of
[2:20:45] Israel delivered seon and all his people
[2:20:49] into the hand of Israel
[2:20:51] we didn't deliver it the Lord himself
[2:20:53] got involved in the matter and delivered
[2:20:56] it and they smed them so Israel
[2:20:58] possessed all the land of the amorites
[2:21:01] and the inhabitant of that country and
[2:21:03] they possess all the coast of the
[2:21:05] amorites from Anon even unto Jabbok and
[2:21:08] from Wilderness even unto Jordan so now
[2:21:11] the Lord God of Israel has dispossessed
[2:21:14] the amorites from before his people
[2:21:16] Israel and should as thou possess it he
[2:21:19] challenging the king of Ammons saying
[2:21:21] the Lord is who give us this land and

[2:23:49] gangster know he man quoting down to
[2:23:51] baac he done not not just history he
[2:23:53] going down to
[2:23:56] Doctrine and now are thou anything
[2:23:59] better than baac the son of zior King of
[2:24:01] Moab did he ever strive against Israel
[2:24:04] or did he ever fight against them in
[2:24:06] other words he said he and all try and
[2:24:09] look what happened to him is jeffa
[2:24:11] talking to you here this
[2:24:12] morning don't mess with us we have
[2:24:16] history we know who we are we know who
[2:24:19] our God is it was God of our fathers who
[2:24:21] delivered the land into our hand you're
[2:24:23] picking the wrong fight here today
[2:24:25] because it's not just Jeff fighting I
[2:24:27] fighting with the history and the
[2:24:28] knowledge that God is in charge not only
[2:24:30] that in judges 10 we read it all these
[2:24:32] strange Gods already put
[2:24:34] away so we unsp in terms with God can
[2:24:38] the church say Amen all
[2:24:42] right will Israel verse 26 while Israel
[2:24:45] dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in
[2:24:48] Aurora and her towns and all the cities
[2:24:51] and that be by the course of anon 300
[2:24:55] years he see this is so powerful why
[2:24:59] therefore did you not recover them
[2:25:00] within that time in other words my Lord
[2:25:03] you know in Lord called a statute of
[2:25:07] limitation after a certain time you
[2:25:09] can't come back with no case he say I
[2:25:11] had 300 years since we left Egypt it's
[2:25:14] 300 years already gone since they left
[2:25:15] Egypt you see had 300 years to do with
[2:25:17] this thing your statute of limitation
[2:25:19] over if you wanted to beef about this
[2:25:21] thing you should have dealt with it a
[2:25:22] long time ago it too late for you to
[2:25:24] even apply in the court for mercy in
[2:25:26] this matter because we are now statute
[2:25:29] bad you have no case here this morning
[2:25:32] you say 300 years why de did you not
[2:25:34] recover them within that
[2:25:36] time so we see jeffa is a leader he's a
[2:25:39] diplomat he's a negotiator he understand
[2:25:42] arbitration he's a spiritual man he
[2:25:44] understand spiritual history he is on
[2:25:46] the word he also understand law he know
[2:25:48] statute of limitation he said if you
[2:25:50] wanted to even bring a case you should
[2:25:52] have bring the case a long time ago but
[2:25:53] 300 years already gone too much time
[2:25:55] already passed and I reach here now I am
[2:25:58] here
[2:25:59] now can the church say
[2:26:03] Amen wherefore this is the conclusion of
[2:26:06] the legal matter I have not sinned
[2:26:08] against thee but thou doest wrong to war
[2:26:11] against me the Lord the judge here's a
[2:26:15] judge talking about the judge the Lord
[2:26:17] the judge be judge this day between the
[2:26:20] children of Israel and the children of
[2:26:24] Ammon verse 28 how be it the king of the
[2:26:29] children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
[2:26:32] word of jeffa which he sent
[2:26:34] them now I love verse
[2:26:37] 29 verse 29 said then the spirit of the
[2:26:41] Lord Came Upon
[2:26:46] jeffa so after the word go on forth now
[2:26:49] brother Stephen now now we see a shift a
[2:26:51] further shift an acceleration of the
[2:26:53] shift something now an anointing now
[2:26:56] come upon jeffa he was a bad man before
[2:26:58] he was on the word before but the
[2:27:00] anointing could only anoint something so
[2:27:02] now all the the foundation has been laid
[2:27:05] the word has been declared the message
[2:27:06] has G forth there there's nothing to
[2:27:08] hold it back now now the spirit of the
[2:27:09] Lord come upon Jeff you mean to tell me
[2:27:13] that God can't send the Holy Spirit upon
[2:27:15] somebody who messed up made mistakes and
[2:27:18] just find their way back into the house
[2:27:19] of God
[2:27:20] oh my
[2:27:23] [Applause]
[2:27:26] woo what a joy could you imagine the
[2:27:29] feeling that Came Upon
[2:27:33] jeffa he had gone to many battle before
[2:27:35] but now he feel something different he
[2:27:38] feel a quickening he feel an unction he
[2:27:40] feel a something different he never felt
[2:27:43] this way before he had done everything
[2:27:44] in his flesh before but now the spirit
[2:27:47] of the Lord is upon Jeff the the
[2:27:50] anointing is upon jeffa the Lord has
[2:27:53] confirmed that he is with JEA the Lord
[2:27:55] is present with jeffa woo
[2:28:00] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory
[2:28:04] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:28:07] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:28:11] Lord Glory Hall Spirit of your Lord come
[2:28:16] upon jeffa friends what a way to feel to
[2:28:20] know that the spirit of the Lord is upon
[2:28:22] you in other words the holy spirit is
[2:28:24] pleased with the way it has flowed thus
[2:28:27] far can I
[2:28:36] amen if there any thing you want to ever
[2:28:39] feel or experience it's the spirit of
[2:28:42] the Lord coming upon youj when you need
[2:28:46] to know what to do when you need to know
[2:28:47] how to live when you need to know the
[2:28:48] next move jeffa was going a certain way
[2:28:51] all of a sudden something changed in the
[2:28:54] atmosphere the prophet would be there
[2:28:56] speaking he say you know what I'm
[2:28:57] waiting on I'm waiting for the angel of
[2:28:59] the Lord and then the spirit of the Lord
[2:29:00] would be
[2:29:15] there verse
[2:29:17] 29 then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[2:29:22] and he passed over
[2:29:23] Gilead and Manasseh and passed over
[2:29:27] mispa and from misah of Gilead he passed
[2:29:30] on over unto the children of
[2:29:32] Ammon now this is where I want to get
[2:29:36] to where this takes a interesting turn
[2:29:40] I'll see that
[2:29:43] has caught many a theologian of
[2:29:46] God and within this passage of scripture
[2:29:49] what we're going to go into next I'm not
[2:29:51] going to be too much longer but I want
[2:29:52] to bring this home to
[2:29:55] us about what drives jeffa into Hebrews
[2:29:59] 11 because I made a point that everyone
[2:30:03] in Hebrews 11 had something in their
[2:30:05] past in their story that should
[2:30:07] disqualify
[2:30:08] them but God overlooked it and placed
[2:30:13] them there The Heroes of Faith he said
[2:30:14] by faith
[2:30:21] verse 30 and jeffa vowed a vow unto the
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:26] Lord and said if Thou shalt without fail
[2:30:31] deliver the children of Ammon into mine
[2:30:35] hands then it shall be that whatsoever
[2:30:38] cometh forth of the doors of my house to
[2:30:42] meet me when I return in peace from the
[2:30:45] children of Ammon shall surely be the
[2:30:47] Lord's and I will offer it up for a burn
[2:30:52] offering he made a a big
[2:30:56] statement and I want to qualify this a
[2:30:59] little bit in a short while from a quote
[2:31:01] from the
[2:31:02] prophet so let's go on so jeffa verse 32
[2:31:06] passed over unto the children of Ammon
[2:31:08] to fight against them and the Lord
[2:31:10] delivered them into his hands and he
[2:31:13] smoted them from Aurora even till Thou
[2:31:15] come to men even 20 cities and unto the
[2:31:19] plain of The Vineyards with a very great
[2:31:21] Slaughter thus the children of Ammon was
[2:31:23] subdued before the children of Israel so
[2:31:26] we read in Hebrews 11 subdued kingdoms
[2:31:28] so this is this is if you read Hebrews
[2:31:30] 11 the subdued kingdoms and all those
[2:31:32] things were the descriptions of the acts
[2:31:34] of the names that were
[2:31:42] called and jeffa came to misper unto his
[2:31:46] house and behold his daughter came out
[2:31:49] to meet him am with
[2:31:52] Tims and with
[2:31:54] dances and she was his only child beside
[2:31:58] her he had neither son nor
[2:32:01] daughter and it came to pass when he saw
[2:32:04] her that he rent his clothes and said
[2:32:06] alas my daughter thou Hast brought me
[2:32:09] very
[2:32:10] low and thou art one of them that
[2:32:13] trouble me for I have opened my mouth
[2:32:15] unto the Lord and I cannot go back
[2:32:35] and she said unto him my father if thou
[2:32:38] has opened thy mouth unto the Lord do to
[2:32:41] me according to that which had proceeded
[2:32:44] out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord
[2:32:47] had taken Vengeance for thee of enemies
[2:32:50] even of the children of Ammon so I want
[2:32:54] to pause there for a
[2:32:58] minute there's a quote from Brother
[2:33:00] brandom Where he made a
[2:33:05] statement in at Thy word Lord and he say
[2:33:07] I notice he called him a king had made a
[2:33:09] rash vow one
[2:33:12] time and he vowed that he'd sacrificed
[2:33:14] the first thing that come from his
[2:33:17] house and there's a lot of debate
[2:33:20] it about that vow that jeffa
[2:33:24] made and we'll read How It Ends and what
[2:33:29] God leaves without saying it but there
[2:33:32] are things I want to capture in
[2:33:35] this that should make us pause to
[2:33:38] reflect because I want you to listen to
[2:33:40] the words of jeffa very carefully and
[2:33:43] the response of his daughter and I want
[2:33:44] to bring two additional scriptures to
[2:33:46] bear on this
[2:33:51] verse 34 again and jeffa came to misper
[2:33:54] unto his house and behold his daughter
[2:33:56] came out to meet him and you know what
[2:33:57] he said he said whatever is the first
[2:33:59] thing that come out will be a
[2:34:02] sacrifice now when I read this I have
[2:34:05] one
[2:34:06] daughter but George I read this and I
[2:34:09] had to put on the book a little
[2:34:11] while but this is
[2:34:14] heavy because his
[2:34:16] motive was a noble motive
[2:34:20] he want to destroy the
[2:34:22] ammonites so up until this point because
[2:34:25] we could say that his past was the past
[2:34:29] we could see the transition from Outlaw
[2:34:31] to judge but now as a judge he makes
[2:34:35] what is called a rash
[2:34:36] vow a vow that if you look at brother
[2:34:39] Brandon describing it as rash vow it
[2:34:41] makes you wonder if he did the right
[2:34:42] thing at that
[2:34:44] moment and it raises the question to us
[2:34:47] do we make statements or promises to
[2:34:51] God and how do we view these commitments
[2:34:55] and these promises to God and how does
[2:34:57] God view it because one thing we see
[2:34:59] about jeffa is the honor of the
[2:35:02] man that he makes a vow brother popwell
[2:35:07] that even though it's a rash vow there's
[2:35:10] something in him that's compelling him
[2:35:11] to be a man of his
[2:35:14] word now this becomes deep because there
[2:35:17] are scriptures that raise this to the
[2:35:20] Consciousness and when we see that the
[2:35:22] spoken word is the Original Seed and in
[2:35:25] in Hebrews we read that the world was
[2:35:26] framed by the word of God it means we
[2:35:29] have to be very measured with the words
[2:35:32] we use because life and death is in the
[2:35:34] power of the tongue and we cannot just
[2:35:36] string words together into sentences and
[2:35:40] not understand that these sentences have
[2:35:45] consequences I want to make sure this
[2:35:48] sticks but I want to to underscore not
[2:35:51] just Jeff's belief in the matter but the
[2:35:55] training of the
[2:35:57] daughter because she herself understood
[2:36:00] the importance of whatever you say to
[2:36:03] God being something that's critical
[2:36:06] could he take some
[2:36:08] more so jeffa came to mispah unto his
[2:36:11] house and to behold and behold his
[2:36:13] daughter came out to meet him I can
[2:36:14] imagine I know how my daughter gets when
[2:36:16] I get
[2:36:17] home I don't know what Jeff was thinking
[2:36:20] was going to come out the
[2:36:22] house I can't I can't I can't explain it
[2:36:25] don't I can't explain it he said
[2:36:27] whatever come at the house so maybe he
[2:36:29] just feeling so inspired sometime people
[2:36:31] get anointed and say the wrong
[2:36:33] thing he feels so inspired he said Lord
[2:36:36] if you let me win this battle whatever
[2:36:38] come to the house i'
[2:36:43] sacrifice he make a pledge a v
[2:36:45] commitment without even thinking
[2:36:46] anything through
[2:36:49] and here he reached home and the
[2:36:51] daughter
[2:36:52] excited to see
[2:36:56] him as any daughter would be because you
[2:36:58] don't be father coming back alive dead
[2:37:00] is a war he went to fight he didn't go
[2:37:02] by H Massi he didn't go by the
[2:37:05] grocery and when you hear this song is
[2:37:07] Daddy there is Daddy there yes daddy
[2:37:08] there daddy there and the moment Jeff
[2:37:11] sees us and say you have brought me low
[2:37:14] amen because I made a statement to
[2:37:17] God I made a statement to God and I
[2:37:22] cannot go back on my
[2:37:26] word I want us to be very careful
[2:37:29] because whenever you make a statement to
[2:37:32] God you cannot go back Amen on your word
[2:37:38] this is not making a statement to your
[2:37:40] brother to your sister this is you
[2:37:42] making a vow to God this lifts up this
[2:37:46] morning the vow of marriage yes anybody
[2:37:50] with me this
[2:37:51] morning is a vow before God this goes
[2:37:55] beyond this is adultery this is jeffa is
[2:37:58] about to
[2:38:00] contemplate what happens with his only
[2:38:03] child because of how much he values his
[2:38:08] vow to
[2:38:10] God and when he tells his daughter girl
[2:38:14] I told God that whatever come of the
[2:38:17] house I'm going to set sacrifices she
[2:38:20] said well if you said that to God you
[2:38:22] have to honor
[2:38:27] [Applause]
[2:38:37] it let's go to
[2:38:39] Psalms 15 verse
[2:38:43] 1 I'm not going to be too much
[2:38:48] longer Psalms
[2:38:54] 15:1
[2:38:56] Lord who shall abide in thy
[2:39:00] Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy
[2:39:04] Hill he that walth
[2:39:06] uprightly and worketh
[2:39:09] righteousness and speaketh the truth in
[2:39:11] his
[2:39:12] heart he that backbiteth not with his
[2:39:16] tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor
[2:39:20] nor take it up a reproach against his
[2:39:23] neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is
[2:39:29] condemned but he that honored them that
[2:39:32] fear the
[2:39:33] lord and listen to this verse that the
[2:39:37] psalmist David picks up here he that
[2:39:39] sweareth to his own hurt and changeth
[2:39:45] not and I want to now go to the
[2:39:47] Amplified
[2:39:51] oh Lord who may Lodge as guest in your
[2:39:54] tent who may dwell continually on your
[2:39:57] Holy Hill he walks with integrity and
[2:40:01] strength of character and works
[2:40:04] righteousness and speaks and holds truth
[2:40:07] in his heart he does not slander with
[2:40:10] his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor
[2:40:14] nor takes up a reproach against his
[2:40:16] friend in his eyes an evil person is
[2:40:18] despise
[2:40:19] but he honors those who fear the lord
[2:40:21] and obediently worship him with all
[2:40:23] inspired reverence and submissive wonder
[2:40:27] he keeps his word even to his own
[2:40:31] disadvantage and does not change it for
[2:40:34] his own
[2:40:35] benefit so in other words the psalmist
[2:40:38] David is saying be very careful with
[2:40:40] your words because God values
[2:40:45] honor anybody with me this
[2:40:47] morning this lifts a critical point to
[2:40:52] how God wants us to keep our word keep
[2:40:55] our commitment keep our commitment to
[2:40:57] one another and more importantly keep it
[2:40:59] to him last scripture before we bring a
[2:41:02] close to this message this morning and
[2:41:04] these are the lessons of jeffa the
[2:41:05] Journey of jeffa right let's go to
[2:41:08] Ecclesiastes 5
[2:41:22] Ecclesiastes 5 and verse
[2:41:25] one keep thy
[2:41:28] foot when thou goest to the house of
[2:41:31] God and be more ready to hear than to
[2:41:35] give the sacrifice of
[2:41:37] fools for they consider not that they do
[2:41:41] evil be not rash with thy
[2:41:44] mouth and let not thine heart be Hasty
[2:41:48] to utter anything before God for God is
[2:41:52] in heaven and thou upon the Earth
[2:41:56] therefore let thy Words Be Few for a
[2:42:00] dream cometh through the multitude of
[2:42:02] business and a Fool's voice is known by
[2:42:06] multitude of words and when thou vest a
[2:42:10] vow unto God defer not to pay it for he
[2:42:15] hath no pleasure in fools pay that which
[2:42:18] thou Hast has
[2:42:20] vowed now you can see ananas and ZF here
[2:42:24] now because they made a vow they made a
[2:42:30] commitment suffer not thy mouth to cause
[2:42:33] thy flesh to sin neither say thou before
[2:42:36] the angel that it was an
[2:42:39] error all you all you hearing this is
[2:42:41] the Bible reading
[2:42:42] morning well Lord already was making a
[2:42:45] mistake when I say I was giving up the
[2:42:46] world this week
[2:42:51] this now ties back to judges 10 with
[2:42:54] true repentance because you're saying
[2:42:56] with your mouth you repent and God
[2:42:58] saying but I'm not seeing the repentance
[2:43:02] you made a vow that you're turning away
[2:43:04] from the world where is the evidence of
[2:43:08] you keeping the
[2:43:10] vow I will I want to read these two
[2:43:12] things again and because some of us are
[2:43:14] seen you looking at me like you never
[2:43:16] look at these
[2:43:17] scriptures in this way before
[2:43:20] because we build up true jeffa to see
[2:43:22] the manly transformation and then to see
[2:43:25] how he makes a vow that brings them to a
[2:43:29] crisis because he recognize maybe he
[2:43:32] said something he should not have said
[2:43:34] then we read in Scripture that even if
[2:43:36] it's to your own hurt you lose out on
[2:43:38] the deal you make a bad decision and you
[2:43:40] say you're going to do something and you
[2:43:42] have to keep your word because you have
[2:43:44] to honor your word well I didn't make a
[2:43:46] mistake and that why I keep my word that
[2:43:48] is not Christian
[2:43:50] I didn't really mean to say it so so
[2:43:52] really I really mean no you made a
[2:43:59] vow let's just close it out suffer not
[2:44:01] thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin
[2:44:03] neither say thou before the Angel and
[2:44:05] the angel here translates even to priest
[2:44:07] or
[2:44:08] Minister and and again I'm bringing this
[2:44:10] up now because bovid was speaking last
[2:44:12] week about the Temple of the
[2:44:15] Lord and fleeing fornication and and
[2:44:18] adultery and these things so when you
[2:44:20] stand in front the altar with a marriage
[2:44:24] vow it's a vow to God and before the
[2:44:28] priest which here is
[2:44:35] Angel this
[2:44:36] lifts vows commitments the marriage vow
[2:44:40] the Covenant you as a Believer you vow
[2:44:42] to God when you get baptized it's a vow
[2:44:44] you're
[2:44:47] taken it's not just words will I repent
[2:44:49] I get baptized a simple thing I I come
[2:44:50] in a church I want to be a Christian
[2:44:52] what does that really mean when you make
[2:44:54] these declaration I accept you as my
[2:44:55] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I
[2:44:58] accept the fact that I'm now transformed
[2:44:59] saved and I'm and and you begin to make
[2:45:02] certain declarations to God and then you
[2:45:04] do as if you talk
[2:45:06] Amen in the old days before laws were
[2:45:09] written and agreements were signed it
[2:45:11] was word of mouth and a handshake
[2:45:12] agreement because men kept their words
[2:45:15] the reason you need people now because
[2:45:16] man are keeping the word that's right I
[2:45:18] did for get what it really say and I was
[2:45:20] an error and I well will P sign here you
[2:45:25] know anybody with me this
[2:45:30] morning let's close it out suffer not
[2:45:33] thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin
[2:45:35] neither say thou before the angel that
[2:45:37] it was an error wherefore should God be
[2:45:39] angry at thy voice and destroy the works
[2:45:42] of thine
[2:45:45] hand so let's let's bring this to
[2:45:47] conclusion
[2:45:52] back to
[2:45:57] judges and she said unto him this is the
[2:45:59] daughter speaking my father
[2:46:01] now when you look at the deeper
[2:46:04] translation of that sacrifice the
[2:46:08] original
[2:46:11] writing sorts of have a double
[2:46:14] meaning so this is one of the reason
[2:46:16] theologians have weighed what we know
[2:46:19] for
[2:46:20] sure and we'll get into
[2:46:23] it and she said unto her
[2:46:27] father let this thing be done for me let
[2:46:31] me alone two months that I may go up and
[2:46:34] down upon the mountains and bewail my
[2:46:37] virginity I and my
[2:46:39] fellows and he said go and he sent away
[2:46:44] her away for two months and she went
[2:46:46] with her Companions and bewailed her
[2:46:48] virginity upon the
[2:46:50] mountains and it came to pass at the end
[2:46:52] of two months that she returned unto her
[2:46:55] father who did with her according to his
[2:46:58] vow which he had vowed and she knew no
[2:47:01] man and it was a custom in
[2:47:04] Israel that the daughters of Israel went
[2:47:06] yearly to lament the daughter of jeffa
[2:47:10] the gileadite 4 days in a year we see a
[2:47:15] repeated theme here where it says in
[2:47:18] verse
[2:47:20] 37 let me alone two months that I may go
[2:47:23] and bewail my virginity it says it in
[2:47:25] verse 38 and she went with her
[2:47:27] companions to be whale of virginity and
[2:47:30] it goes on to say and it was that she uh
[2:47:34] did with her according to her vow which
[2:47:36] she had vow which he knew no man so from
[2:47:39] the scripture what we are seeing here is
[2:47:42] that a sacrifice was
[2:47:45] made the scripture doesn't say clearly
[2:47:48] what the final outcome was if she was
[2:47:51] actually offered up or some would argue
[2:47:55] that she gave her life to serving the
[2:47:57] lord and she never got
[2:47:59] married and the sacrifice that jeffa
[2:48:02] made was his lineage was cut because he
[2:48:06] his one
[2:48:08] child never got
[2:48:10] married and the sacrifice he made was
[2:48:12] basically cutting his
[2:48:14] lineage the Bible doesn't expressly say
[2:48:16] if he was offered up physically what we
[2:48:19] do know for sure is that she never got
[2:48:21] married what it does show is the Bible
[2:48:24] says that jeffa kept his
[2:48:26] vow and Jeff was committed to The Vow
[2:48:30] and the critical lesson I want us to
[2:48:32] take away this morning from this
[2:48:35] scripture it's to look
[2:48:38] back very carefully on vows that you
[2:48:41] have made and as we approach this time
[2:48:45] of repentance and grace and mercy before
[2:48:47] judgment be very careful because now you
[2:48:50] are drawn to the scriptures that speak
[2:48:53] very clearly to the importance of the
[2:48:56] words you speak and what it means not
[2:48:59] just in the spiritual realm but in the
[2:49:00] natural realm but more so in in
[2:49:04] Ecclesiastes going I want to read these
[2:49:05] two scriptures as the musician get ready
[2:49:07] to come to read the scriptures one more
[2:49:10] time so you look at the gravity of the
[2:49:13] situation because if you could you could
[2:49:15] attribute to each of the
[2:49:17] judges what is the significant thing
[2:49:19] about them that pushed them into Hebrews
[2:49:21] 11 it is one thing to win a war it is
[2:49:24] one thing to be transformed from an
[2:49:27] outlaw to a judge but the cross that
[2:49:30] jeffa had to bear was this vow that he
[2:49:33] made that brother BR call a rash vow
[2:49:36] maybe an impulsive vow maybe a vow under
[2:49:38] excitement because he want the Lord and
[2:49:40] the thing is the Lord honored the
[2:49:41] statement because the Lord allowed
[2:49:43] Victory and Jeff still had to honor Lord
[2:49:46] I made a vow to you you know to live
[2:49:47] holy yeah this is The Vow we making
[2:49:50] right Lord I make a vow to you I I want
[2:49:52] to be a Christian I want to live a
[2:49:54] righteous life I want to cut out the
[2:49:56] world I want to and I'm vowing that as a
[2:50:00] sister I'm not going to cut my hair that
[2:50:02] that's a vow oh yes you vow to dress
[2:50:05] like a Christian that is a vow is a
[2:50:08] commitment when you accept this journey
[2:50:10] you want to be a real Christian how you
[2:50:12] can make a vow to dress like a Christian
[2:50:13] and then when you're not dressing what
[2:50:15] do you how do you want God to receive
[2:50:16] you at that point amen
[2:50:19] this goes beyond rules and stuff now
[2:50:21] because this is now you and God because
[2:50:23] Jeff saying I made a vow before God and
[2:50:26] I really can't come back on my vow and I
[2:50:29] love the daughter recognizing but if you
[2:50:31] commit to the Lord to do something you
[2:50:33] have to honor it bring back the Y is y
[2:50:36] and the N is n bring back if I'm saying
[2:50:39] Lord I'm going to serve
[2:50:41] you and not serve the ASAT not serve the
[2:50:44] gods of Canaan not serve the god of I'm
[2:50:46] serving you then why you trying to go
[2:50:49] back in the world I'm not saying that
[2:50:51] you're not going to have struggles I'm
[2:50:52] not saying you're not going to have ups
[2:50:53] and downs but you made a vow unto the
[2:50:55] Lord Lord I am going to serve you you
[2:50:57] are my God that's a vow you are my king
[2:51:00] Lord I'm making a promise to
[2:51:02] you it it it reframes things whether you
[2:51:05] feel anointed or don't feel anointed you
[2:51:07] living by a v it's same with
[2:51:10] marriage if you feeling on Cloud 9 all
[2:51:12] the time that is a whole different thing
[2:51:14] but I have yet to find a cou who on
[2:51:16] cloud n all the time there a reason you
[2:51:18] take a
[2:51:19] vow anybody in the house this
[2:51:22] morning and when the emotion is not
[2:51:24] there The Vow is supposed to
[2:51:29] stand and we say in in marriage vow The
[2:51:31] Vow is before God and
[2:51:33] man is like two signatures on the
[2:51:36] contract this changes the conversation
[2:51:39] about adultery just a sin this is now
[2:51:41] elevates it to back to spoken word you
[2:51:45] made a vow nobody forced you you came to
[2:51:47] the altar and said For Better or Worse
[2:51:50] for richer or poorer in sickness and in
[2:51:52] health I'm standing by
[2:51:54] you this has nothing to do with anybody
[2:51:57] else just at that point is you making a
[2:51:59] vow before God and man whether your
[2:52:02] partner keeps her part his part is
[2:52:04] irrelevant your vow is before God and
[2:52:07] man am I in the is there anybody in the
[2:52:09] house this
[2:52:11] morning The Vow goes above the emotion
[2:52:14] because here it is Jeff saying you have
[2:52:15] brought me very low this thing driving
[2:52:17] me to depression I cannot believe that
[2:52:19] the outcome of my statement would have
[2:52:21] turned out this
[2:52:23] way I made a vow and look how it has
[2:52:26] played out this is not what I envisioned
[2:52:28] but I made a vow to God and I have to be
[2:52:31] prepared to deal with the consequence of
[2:52:33] My Vow before
[2:52:34] God am I in the house this morning is
[2:52:37] anybody here with me this
[2:52:39] [Applause]
[2:52:42] morning maybe Jeff's Journey but Joe of
[2:52:45] being a bad boy because in the
[2:52:47] Underworld you are keeping where to get
[2:52:48] killer
[2:52:51] now you say you're going to deliver the
[2:52:53] thing by so and so place and thing there
[2:52:56] they say well is you and your family
[2:52:57] gone or just a simple thing so the
[2:52:59] respect for vows and commitment is
[2:53:01] different we playing games in the
[2:53:03] natural realm here but in the criminal
[2:53:06] Enterprise your word is all have you no
[2:53:08] criminal signing
[2:53:10] agreement there's a contract between
[2:53:12] this gang and that gang and they are
[2:53:13] written no there's the tur there's a
[2:53:15] Turf you deliver you deliver you pay you
[2:53:17] pay yeah pay tomorrow you're dead this
[2:53:21] simple so maybe Jeff's Journey had him
[2:53:25] very sensitive to I have made vows with
[2:53:27] my gang gang gang men but here I just
[2:53:30] made a vow before God this has to be the
[2:53:32] most important vow I've ever
[2:53:35] made if I didn't play with my natural
[2:53:37] vows how could I even try to play with
[2:53:39] My Vow before God you see I've made a
[2:53:42] vow before God and I cannot take it back
[2:53:45] because when I tell somebody I'm going
[2:53:46] to do something I'm going to do it and
[2:53:48] if I say I'm not going to do it I'm not
[2:53:50] going to do
[2:53:51] it and somehow that daughter was trained
[2:53:55] enough to say well Daddy this is this is
[2:53:57] what we believe you make a vow before
[2:53:59] God and prepare to deal with the
[2:54:00] consequence whether the consequence is
[2:54:03] is sacrifice whether the consequences I
[2:54:05] don't get married and I have to live in
[2:54:06] the temple for my whole life because I
[2:54:07] see whatever this whatever you have to
[2:54:09] do
[2:54:10] do once we don't break
[2:54:12] devour I pray this helps somebody in
[2:54:15] here who has been on the edge and your
[2:54:18] thinking about the world thinking about
[2:54:19] this but wait a minute if you when I
[2:54:23] have
[2:54:24] decided to follow
[2:54:26] Jesus I have decided it's a decision to
[2:54:30] follow Jesus I have decided to follow
[2:54:35] Jesus no turning back no turning back
[2:54:40] the cross before me the World Behind me
[2:54:44] the cross be is not just a
[2:54:46] song It's a commitment it's a vow and it
[2:54:51] has nothing to do with your feeling it
[2:54:53] has nothing to do with what happens it
[2:54:55] has nothing to do with what plays out in
[2:54:57] your life you say Lord I don't have
[2:54:59] nothing but Lord I made a vow God help
[2:55:01] me help me but I have I can't go back on
[2:55:03] My
[2:55:04] Vow
[2:55:06] amen is this a reality to anybody this
[2:55:08] morning this is a renewal service it's a
[2:55:11] reflection service Lord I'm making a vow
[2:55:15] I've made vows making vows you'll always
[2:55:17] make vows but Lord I V to serve
[2:55:21] you what's the point of coming to church
[2:55:23] and know to serve God what's it purpose
[2:55:26] to come the service and you you don't
[2:55:28] want to commit because it's a
[2:55:33] commitment God says I keep my promises
[2:55:36] we say he's a God that doesn't fail he's
[2:55:38] a God that keeps his word then what is
[2:55:40] what is our part of this equation that
[2:55:43] says but Lord as a sister I vow to keep
[2:55:46] my chastity
[2:55:51] it's a
[2:55:53] vow this woman kept her vow she bewailed
[2:55:57] her virginity maybe she thought of
[2:55:58] having children one day talked about
[2:55:59] getting married one day whatever it was
[2:56:01] it was cut off because of her
[2:56:03] vow that said listen young lady you have
[2:56:05] to sacrifice your life to the Lord cuz I
[2:56:08] made a statement that I intend to live
[2:56:10] to God this is not about pleasing
[2:56:12] anybody now it's about pleasing God I
[2:56:14] want to Circle this home to everybody
[2:56:16] this morning that as you leave this
[2:56:18] service you recalibrate the importance
[2:56:21] of your words whether you maintain your
[2:56:24] family let me maintain Christ but the B
[2:56:26] was taking a
[2:56:27] vow money or money friend or no friend
[2:56:30] in season out of season all this is vows
[2:56:33] but feeling no fire if you know you made
[2:56:35] a vow for 5 years but abam preached
[2:56:38] without the anointing because he was
[2:56:40] standing on his vow standing on his
[2:56:42] commitment baptism is a vow consecration
[2:56:45] is a vow communion is a vow these are
[2:56:47] all different commitments along your
[2:56:49] journey this is not to condemn you this
[2:56:51] is for you to reframe and say Lord maybe
[2:56:53] I wasn't keeping it as I should but Lord
[2:56:55] From This Day Forward and be careful in
[2:56:57] saying this but from this day forward
[2:56:59] Lord I'm going to make a different
[2:57:01] approach and make a different effort
[2:57:03] toward serving
[2:57:07] you you can be to play something softly
[2:57:10] I just want to read these two verses one
[2:57:12] more time and then brother Anthony will
[2:57:15] come from Psalms 15 ver1
[2:57:19] Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle
[2:57:22] who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that
[2:57:24] walth uprightly and worketh
[2:57:27] righteousness speak the truth in his
[2:57:29] heart not truth with just your mouth but
[2:57:31] truth in your heart he that back back
[2:57:34] bite it not with his tongue nor do it
[2:57:36] evil to his neighbor nor take it up a
[2:57:39] reproach against his neighbor in whose
[2:57:41] eyes a vile persons condemned but he
[2:57:43] honored them that fear the lord he that
[2:57:45] swear it to his own hurt and change it
[2:57:48] not
[2:57:48] and at last statement is the one I want
[2:57:50] to hone into you make a commitment a vow
[2:57:53] maybe it end up to your hurt maybe you
[2:57:55] end up into problems maybe you end up
[2:57:57] into challenges but you can't change the
[2:57:59] vow that was made you have to live with
[2:58:01] the vow you have to live with the
[2:58:03] commitment you have to live with the
[2:58:04] dedication because God is the one who's
[2:58:06] marking the score not your family not
[2:58:08] your neighbor not a preacher not a
[2:58:09] pastor not anybody else God is the one
[2:58:11] marking The Vow so if you have not been
[2:58:13] living to your vow your commitment to
[2:58:15] the Lord the commitment to your wife the
[2:58:17] commitment even to your family because
[2:58:18] when you have a child you're making a
[2:58:19] vow to raise that child in the fear of
[2:58:21] the Lord are we in the house this
[2:58:26] morning last
[2:58:29] verse Ecclesiastes 5 verse 1-6 keep thy
[2:58:34] foot when thou goest to the house of God
[2:58:37] in other words be careful I'm going to
[2:58:39] read in the amplifi I didn't read it the
[2:58:40] last time and be more ready to hear than
[2:58:43] to give the sacrifice of fools for they
[2:58:46] consider not that they do evil
[2:58:48] be not rash with thy mouth and let not
[2:58:51] thine heart be Hasty to utter anything
[2:58:53] before God for God is in heaven and and
[2:58:56] thou upon Earth therefore let thy Words
[2:58:58] Be Few let your words be measured let
[2:59:01] your word be very calculated for a dream
[2:59:03] cometh through a multitude of business
[2:59:06] and a Fool's voice is known by multitude
[2:59:08] of words when thou vest a vow unto God
[2:59:12] defer not to pay it for he hath no
[2:59:15] pleasure in fools pay that which thou
[2:59:19] Hast vowed better it is it that thou
[2:59:22] shouldest not
[2:59:23] vow than that thou shouldest vow and not
[2:59:26] pay in other words if you want to be a
[2:59:28] Christian be a real Christian it's
[2:59:31] better you don't choose to walk just and
[2:59:32] try to walk it and don't keep up to the
[2:59:34] walk this brings a level of soberness to
[2:59:37] everyone in the house this
[2:59:39] morning suffer not thy mouth to cause
[2:59:42] thy flesh to sin neither say thou before
[2:59:44] the angel that it was an error wherefor
[2:59:47] should God be angry thy voice and
[2:59:49] destroy the work of thine hand let me
[2:59:51] just read that in the Amplified and we
[2:59:53] close
[2:59:56] out
[2:59:59] Hallelujah guard your steps and focus on
[3:00:04] what you're are doing as you go to the
[3:00:07] house of God you you hear that the
[3:00:10] solemnness the sacredness not the Casual
[3:00:14] while I going up to
[3:00:15] church guard your step
[3:00:18] and focus on what you are doing as you
[3:00:21] go to the house of God this is the same
[3:00:23] Ecclesiastes 5 reading from the
[3:00:26] Amplified and draw near to listen rather
[3:00:30] than to offer the careless or irreverent
[3:00:33] sacrifice of fools for they are too
[3:00:36] ignorant to know they are doing evil do
[3:00:40] not be Hasty with your mouth speaking
[3:00:42] careless words or vows or impulsive in
[3:00:46] thought to bring up a matter before God
[3:00:49] for God is in heaven and you are on
[3:00:50] earth therefore let your Words Be Few
[3:00:53] for the dream comes through much effort
[3:00:56] and the voice of the fool through many
[3:00:58] words when you make a vow or pledge to
[3:01:01] God do not put off paying it for God
[3:01:04] takes no pleasure in fools who
[3:01:06] thoughtlessly mock him pay what you vow
[3:01:09] it is better that you should not vow
[3:01:11] than you should vow and not pay do not
[3:01:13] allow your speech to cause you to sin
[3:01:16] and do not say before the mess messenger
[3:01:18] priest in the King James says Angel
[3:01:21] before the messenger of priest of God
[3:01:22] that it was a mistake why should God be
[3:01:25] angry because of your voice words and
[3:01:28] destroy the work of your
[3:01:30] hands may the Lord add a blessing to the
[3:01:33] reading of his word this morning let's
[3:01:35] stand to our feet
[3:01:39] hallu from an outlaw to a
[3:01:42] judge jeffa was more than a mighty man
[3:01:45] of
[3:01:46] Allah in the physical sense he was a
[3:01:49] mighty man of Valor in that he was a man
[3:01:52] who kept his
[3:01:53] vow that's the deeper message that jeffa
[3:01:57] was a big man he was a man that kept his
[3:02:00] word he kept his vow I pray to God today
[3:02:05] that we leave this service as believers
[3:02:07] who make up our minds Lord I want to
[3:02:09] keep my vow that's why that song with
[3:02:12] the Anthony S at the beginning Lord I
[3:02:13] want to be a Christian in my heart is a
[3:02:15] is a real song We ought to PA and
[3:02:18] reflect because a Christian in your
[3:02:19] heart means Lord I want to live right I
[3:02:21] want to say the right thing I don't want
[3:02:23] to say the wrong thing I don't want to
[3:02:24] move rash as brother bam said it was a
[3:02:26] rash vow maybe it was impulsive we don't
[3:02:28] know because there's a lot we can't
[3:02:29] understand we don't understand how
[3:02:30] Samson made M he made and I don't know
[3:02:32] how Som how you or I make the miss that
[3:02:34] we made but it's Grace and blood and
[3:02:36] mercy for us all but all of scripture is
[3:02:39] for correction it's for edification is
[3:02:41] for reproof is for guidance and the word
[3:02:43] is there telling us be more careful God
[3:02:46] told the prophet be more sincere
[3:02:49] if you be more sincere you'll have the
[3:02:50] power to bind him member so we want a
[3:02:53] deeper sincerity a different sacredness
[3:02:55] may the Lord Richie bless you
