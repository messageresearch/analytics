the church says amen and amen we have two notes of phrases before I greet you this morning from sister Margo thanking God for prayer for her brother son who was missing he has not returned safely a maybe thank God for that [Music] from sister Donnelly Clark I would like to give God all the praise and thanks with mercy endureth forever last Tuesday night prayer was offered on behalf of Kezia and my mom and by the morning of the next day the boot showed no signs and symptoms thanks to the scenes were there prayer of feet middle or is she blessed you this morning I still wanna greet the church in the name of Jesus Christ and certainly extend Happy Father's Day to all of the fathers in a special way this morning and so let's get straight to the word this morning we know that the season is changing and Prime Minister hinted to extending the time and stuff like that but we still will try to work with the schedule today and we see our Lord will will move this morning so if you have your Bibles will you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from Saint Matthew 23 and reading from first John 2 reading Saint Matthew 23 and reading from verse 9 this morning in Matthew 23 and verse 9 and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a beast and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted and reading first John 2 and reading from verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world for If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world Lord had a blessing to the reading of his would a man you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord greetings but also connected to the Internet and we under great expectation for what is gonna do God is doing how many appreciate the service last Sunday rebuilding the church and the power of the Spirit what a time that we are living in amen so all that is in the world we read the scripture the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life the Bible said that's also everything when you look at it it falls on the one of those three things the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and Bible is speaking about love not the world neither the things that are in the world and if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for that is all that is in the world we know this already kind of church name M but this morning I want to take a little focus on pride that pride of life and that would pride in there this morning it's something that we don't hear preach about much and more than that I want to take a look at humility this morning so for a title this morning the sin of pride and the power of humility the sin of pride and the power of humility so write with me this morning we'll see what the Lord will do I believe the devil is in trouble because we about to expose him this morning and once we expose him he can't move anymore because we are not ignorant of Satan's devices undershirts amen so the sin of Pride and the power of humility now pride and humility are opposites we know this everybody with me this morning what is FRA pride is a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievement it's an inordinate self-esteem it's an unreasonable feeling of superiority as to one's talents beauty wealth rank and so forth it's as disdainful behavior or treatment it is considered to be insolence or arrogance of demeanor so someone has a haughty peer and that's the human definition of the word and we can only define what we could write down but when God uses words he has his own definition so we are also trying to come to a consciousness of his definition of it can it should say man now humility on the other hand comes from the Latin word humus which means earth soil dust and when you look at it it speaks of that that consciousness that from dust we came and to dust we are supposed to return so the more humble you I is the more like dust you are you realize that in the context of everything you are nothing lowly of hearts and the church say man no I'm going somewhere and a torpid over time building on what he preached last week but faster get into this this morning we have to go back before the beginning we have to go back all the way back to doctor before man was even on the earth can the church say man now we know the origin of sin is Satan called Lucifer called the devil now the Bible says Lucifer was lifted up with pride he exalted himself beyond his station he saw himself larger than he was so when you see yourself larger than you are it means in contrast you see other things smaller than they are everybody must be this morning so when Lucifer I exalted himself and got lifted up in Pride it meant he even saw God smaller than God was and the church hey man no wonder God says that no one of the Bible said that quad resists the proud but gives grace to the humble because the problem way back there was pride pride was the very beginning of the war in heaven it was not a war in heaven over food it was a war in heaven over land it was not a war in heaven the war and hell started because of anybody with me this morning Lucifer's pride let him to see I will be like the Most High that position the root of that position was pride anybody with me this morning so from pride came his ambition from pride it turned to loss from prime it turned to desire and the church say mmm Martin Luther who preached the just shall live by faith sets pride is the root of the board of the sin so lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life he said that prime is the key because if he could arrest the prime because that pride lifts you up beyond your position can the church say Amen let me go a little deeper pride interrupted the worship in heaven anybody with me this morning so it was pride that Lucifer who was the son of the morning who was among the worshippers as a chief worship up when he looked at himself and he looked around him and pride began to build it doesn't tell us how long it was there how long it built for but that pride was building until one day he looked at himself and said I look good he did not remember he didn't make himself he didn't remember where he came from but he looked at what he was doing he looked at the ministry he had and bride began to grow and I surprised he looked at himself and somewhere along the line he stopped worshiping oh come on now somebody with me anybody with me this morning listen carefully by definition God is the object of worship alright so bride was the first attack it was the first threat on Gordon that's how dangerous ride is because the private Lucifer had became contagious and angels begin to fall because of his pride oh come on now anybody with me this morning we're going somewhere we're gonna get some in a minute the first doctrine that came out of this root of pride was you don't have to worship God you have another option that's what Lucifer taught because he started to pull worship to himself it's pride let a doctrine you don't have to worship God there's another option you don't need to come to church there's another option you don't need to give God praise there's another option every time you kept from praising God that's a spirit of pride that's the foundation sin that led us where we are this morning hallelujah so when people don't want to worship God it's really a pride issue they have come too big they think they've got me somewhere they have achieved something but when you when you take the bride off and you understand what humility means for God oh come on somebody happy this morning you may be seated Lucifer's bride it's what led to Oh in heaven Lucifer's bride left his fall no one not a pipe that see pride cometh before fall so in other words when somebody back slit it's meant before that backsliding there was pride pride in your job right in your money pride in your achievement pride in your successes and this ride begins to move your worship oh come on somebody help me this morning you begin to depend on your credit card that's why the woman with the issue of blood when she spend all her money she had no pride to spend anymore she had to depend on something else anybody with me this morning and from that time on there was a war between pride and humility I've heard a few sermons on this topic in Genesis the Bible says that when Eve saw that the tree was seen as good for food lust of the flesh pleasant to the eye lust of the eye and the tree to be desired to make one wise that pride of life because wisdom or natural wisdom is considered something to be proud about watch the Train of it through scripture we know man fell and evil and Keena brought to that spot where they need to bring their sacrifice the sacrifice was revelation on so many levels because but the Branham will bring out that Abel brought the Lamb yes it was a type of redemption but Abel also got a revelation of who he was and his please listen carefully so when Cain brought his revelation of what he thought was what was needed listen and I'll get to what the Prophet said kin who we know us of his father the devil from first John 3:12 not a skin who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous Kien was caught in the war between pride and humility but the Branham said Cain he couldn't humble himself to the vindicated Word of God he couldn't do it so it meant that what kept Cain because God told Cain if you do what your brother did you don't even have to have a revelation of it if you could humble yourself and just do what your brother did I will honor - humility it was not a revelation being honored it was the humility oh come on now and where Brandon said that King could not humble himself this pride in his own revelation his pride in his own understanding this pride in his relationship with his brother is what separated him anybody with me this morning but the venom said how we do it for time power of transformation Keane was such a person listen to the prophets description of Keane religious indeed certainly but he had the wrong seed in MC and therefore it brought forth the Serpent's seed see it's not hissed over this seed of Eden and that's what brought forth a keen he put his poison on it he he listened to them knew the perfect will of God you hear that October 31st 1965 he came knew the perfect will of God that's something as we all want to know the perfect will of God he knew the perfect will of God in you and why but he refused to do it he proved them to be the serpent seed when he's seen the perfect will of God he refused it he had seen God vindicate Abel's message you know that was the will of God see he's seeing God will hear a buzz message and what did God say to him he said to the same do worship like your brother and you'll do well but you see he didn't want it he wanted to add something to it you see pride and these theologians see this Bible they read it but they don't want to do it see it shows a serpent seed they have seen and vindicated and so simply before the people but it seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves to the Word of God I'm gonna say that one more time it seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves for the word of God can I say it one more time it seems like it's so hard for people to humble themselves to the Word of God and the church see man see how Cain did he couldn't humble humble himself to the vindicated would of God hallelujah oh my the war between pride and humility this is such an issue for God that in proverbs 6 verse 16 he said these six things that the Lord hate he has seven our domination on to him first on the list a proud look just a lot of it caught hits it anybody with me this morning coming a little deeper Oh hallelujah we're gonna get somewhere the issue of ride is beyond wealth it's beyond education it's beyond status you can be poor and be proud you could be poor and still have pride you could have no education and still have pride you could have no status and still have pride can the church say man it is a spirit we're dealing with this morning anybody with me this morning samms 10-4 - wicked through the pride of his countenance your appearance how you carry yourself how you deal with people will not seek after God so you understand what God's saying is what creates this not seeking after God God is not in all his thoughts his pride has him absorbed in his own self thinking you see like naman we preach on a month in the Bible study he had his pride in his condition he still had pride and his pride define how he wanted to be treated how he expected to be treated how he desired to be treated a lot of people miss that his first issue was not the instruction to go down to Jordan that was not his issue his first issue was subscribe oh dear Elijah send a servant boy to tell me what to do that was his first issue that was the pride that almost stopped his healing that was the pride that almost stopped his deliverance but Tang God he had that experience I brought a level of humility maybe nobody ever treated him like that before maybe nobody ever spoke to him like that before he went away mad he went away upset better water I no matter what if you want to know good water ask neighbor good water but that Jordan is not he walked I want to be in and he was upset but truly experienced he humbled himself listen to his servants and his servant say come on brother come on master come on you could do better than that and he humbled himself and his humility let him where he should go hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah anybody with me this morning the fear of the Lord in proverbs 8:13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mode doing it now this is not just and I know a lot of you haven't gotten it yet because message people have prayed church people have prayed the proud of the church the proud of the pasta the proud of the revelation and listen it takes a greater understanding to know that you couldn't give yourself relation you couldn't put your name in the book you didn't choose this path yes part shows you so you could never be proud it takes you Milutin it takes humility it takes humility simple message powerful message simple thought but powerful thought proverbs 11:2 when pride cometh then commits shame but with the lowly is wisdom proverbs 20:1 for a high look and a proud heart and the pawing of the wicked is sin can we go a little further pride and humility are both issues of the heart humility is not about how God looks at you I pray you get this morning humility is not about how good look God looks at you give me a mighty man of Valor that's how God looks at you humility is not how people look at you humility is all about how you look after yourself I'm going somewhere this humility is not about your actual position rank status it is about how you view your position how you view your rank how you view your status the Bible speaks about the word esteem let every man esteem his brother higher than himself that esteeming of higher is all about humility it doesn't change your position can the church say men let me bring it to fathers dear context when the prodigal son left home he left proud he had money in his account his credit card was available to be used he left he was proud enough of what he had to say father gives me what is mine and he left without hesitation as if you knew what he was doing and his father in wisdom let him go because he must have seen how that boy was growing up he knew what was in that boy but I can tell you the way that boy left was not how he came back he may have left with his head head held high feeling you conquer the world with the pride of his achievements he felt proud that he could pay for the food and he can see that the drinks are on me and I'll cover the pizza but when the money ran out it was not that that brought the humility because even when the money ran out he was still looking at himself the same way he took a job working in the pigsty his perception of himself still didn't change until he came to his senses when he kept himself is when the realization broke he said wait a minute in my father's house even the servants get better treatment I will arise I'll go to my father I'll say I have sinned I will say listen I'm no longer worthy to be called your son his position as son didn't change but his perception of how he was as a son that changed oh come on somebody help me now so he left home one way but he's coming back home differently his walk it's a little slower than it was before because he coming back feeling a little different he coming back feel a little bad and he doesn't know that every day since he left his father invested in a beautiful telescope because he know that that boy is headed for an experience to bring him to humility oh come on somebody please back to me anybody with me this morning I'm not gonna be too much longer with you this is why but a random said God is looking for someone that the more he blesses the more humble he becomes so listen carefully so as your blessings Authority rank and position increases your humility should also increase but 99.9% anytime that's not how it happens I'm careful now we'd even seen what God showed me no I'm careful because because I'm seen ministers get caught up in their understanding of the wood till pride sets in you see the danger of it and in subtle ways worship news from God to pastors to ministers to leaders anybody with me this morning and the movement Christ steps in God is not there can I see it one more time the movement pride steps in God is not there because the Bible said he resists the proud oh yeah so you come in to pray but you have pride that I would get into some of what pride is really you know because when you don't forgive that's bright enough uh-huh when you can say sorry what causes that is pride you know when you kind of repent what is that that's pride we know it has children and we have grown up and we haven't changed a little child apologized which I do want to project because a child feels embarrassed embarrassment is it's an emotion that deals with the pride you're dealing with you know or anybody with me this morning so when we do an altar call and people don't want to come up it's private deal original or anybody with me now's when you don't want to tell the pasta what's going on and you you don't want to what is that it's pride because you feeling you feel in some kind of way doing a way to know and God is saying you keep it here is sister proud you trying to come to the altar panco resist because you seen the pride and he can't accept it there's like a barrier around God that stops pride but he gives grace his strong is a stone of grease but the access is short of grease you can't come with pride I'm almost finished the closer you get to God the more he can bless you the more he can trust you the more he can use you but that closeness will always lead to humility like Isaiah the major prophet as he stood in the presence of God it was not good telling him about him but his view of himself changed as he got closer to God he screamed that war is me I've taught this in Bible study a couple weeks ago the chapter just before he said woe unto them woe unto them warn to you woe unto you warn to them what has he gotten the presence of God because humility is not looking at you in relation to others is really looking at you so people come to church and they pray and they pray and they pray for other people that's fine not nothing wrong with that when they pray for other people as if they don't need pray for themselves Lord you know brother so-and-so he needs you Lord and you spend the whole premium pray for sister so brother so and up to now is here you want to admit that you need help anybody with me anybody with me this morning so Isaiah only in the presence of God he saw his real condition and he saw his position his realization listen carefully so humility doesn't change his position in other words his realization did not change his position as a prophet but his experience letter a deeper humility before God there must be a correlation between who you are what you have and your humility anybody with me this morning humility cannot be bought humility is not a performance I've heard people say you know I'm a tango that I'm so so humble undercover predator you know and my humbleness that alors give me I hope this resonates with us you know because listen and I hope I guess it trying to be humble to time as well pride says I don't need help pride says I don't need you to tell me what to do because I know humility says I need all the help I can get right yes I'm okay humility says I'm not okay go all the profit in me to be more sincere no much times and we do it we do it unconsciously because we have built up these layers of Defense's for ourselves how you doin good blessed highly favored and Benita you crumbling we need their pain but your pride won't let you admit but you're in trouble Peter was a fisherman I would expect him to know how to swim and when he walked on the water the moment he started to sing is he Lord help me and many of us we sit in church and we need help but our pride keeps us from say Lord I'm drowning I'm sinking I'm backsliding I'm weak Lord hold my hands pray for me somebody bride says I know where I am remember the Prophet speak about the guide he said I was a guide and I felt I knew where I was I reach around the tree I found where was and then I found back after a while I was in the same spot he said the Indians call it a death walk Oh hallelujah his bride had him making the circles and that was the Prophet anybody with me this morning if you're making circles this morning let's cast on the pride cast don't cry this morning and humbly come back to God right since I know I am humility says I am lost I need a compass I need a guide I'm in trouble I need help I don't know what I'm doing I'm trying my best bank - it's not enough I need help Brian refuses to ask for help humility says help me save me pride says I don't need to go to the altar pride says I'm a deacon how will this look right says I'm a minister how will this look right as I put on a message so long how will this look bride says I don't want my children to see me sighing and crying right since I can't come and repent because I don't want to wait to see me different bride says I don't want nobody to know and I messed up that's right but jesus said I have not come to those that don't need help he says gay little they don't need a doctor when I come if you have a sickness that's why I am come pass down your bride oh come on now somebody help me this morning [Applause] humility bride humility right cannot say I'm sorry people hold on to things for years because of pride they don't say I'm sorry I'm sorry I said that sorry I did that I didn't mean it that way most of the things you see you didn't mean it that way you let it fly lambda and then take it in Pakistan as the hardest thing to do but God brings us to that spot when you wants us to cast it all down so that when he looks at us he sees us perfect because it's nothing hindering in us in the natural you go to a psychologist and they say you cannot get help unless you admit the problem the first part of any therapy session is to bring you to admit that there is a problem most people who have problems cannot admit it's a problem that admit us that admittance of a problem has all to do it right I don't know what my co-workers will think [Music] people see me in church you don't know you don't know can't afford for them to know don't want don't know that hiding is the devil's work because hiding is what led Adam to hide when he should have run for help he went hiding so it's not that hiding itself is not nothing new it was dear Adam who was not born and grew up exhibited the same behaviors that we exhibit today but it was his pride his pride said I'm naked his pride realized he's exposing his pride said don't show anybody don't let them see that as an issue in my life don't let them see I have a problem don't see that behind the closed doors and when I look in the mirror and the tears come and nobody else is there I'm by myself and when nobody else to impress on I take off to sue Tanna take off the dress and go home and look at my bank account or go home and look at my family's situation I closed my door in the bathroom and don't tell nobody about it well we don't hear these kind of messages much but right is a sin because it will prevent you from your deliverance but I declare to you this morning today is the day of deliverance pass down your pride humble yourself before God and see the Lord work in your life bring change in your life bring deliverance in your life bring healing in your life and the church amen you may be seated I'll take a few more minutes the prime minister C extended service you didn't see what Davis Adid that's cuz that's his issue not mine take a few more minutes the book of James listen to the issues in James from whence come Wars and Fighting's among you he is speaking to believers he's not speaking to the world he is speaking to the church and he's asking him a question where all the fighting and issues coming from among you among you believers come they not hence even of your lusts and war in your members so you seen don't need a start in your flesh instead about how you feel and your emotions and how you think about things this is all about you so a big part of citing the church was believers starting with issues in themselves read the book so a portion of the issues in the church was issues that dealt with the person the issues of the flesh listen he goes on he lost and have-nots in other words you're wanting what you don't have he said he kill and desire to have he speaking with the lust of the flesh the eyes there and cannot obtain he fight and war yet he have not because you ask not that's the context of that scripture its context he asked and he received not because he asked amiss that you may consume it upon your lust so she ended speaking of my citizen you ask him but you're asking all over the place because your motivation for asking is Colonel to begin with you're asking for stuff that's tied to your own lust lust of the eye lusts of the flesh anybody with me here rich pride yet we commit to it he adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God are you a friend to the world are you more interested about the things of the world and the things of God I'm reading scripture this is not doctrine this is your Bible whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God so I do you want to be a friend of God would there be a friend of the world make a choice and I read in scripture this morning do you think that the scripture said Envy in the spirit that dwelleth in us luster to Envy that lost Envy is now all about pride and he's building now he's building now to address it and confront it directly but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud so he dealt with the lust of the flesh he tells me the lust of their eyes now he's come against the issue of pride anybody with me this morning he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisted the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your two - heaviness and any ends it infers ten this aspect of it humble yourselves so his whole solution to all of those verses that led up to this brother eclipse is humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up can the church say man anybody with me this morning are you enjoying this this morning instead what the doctor ordered for you this morning now I want to talk about Jesus and I have our own courts and I'm gonna close out almost done the musician got beginning it ready now I want to read the scripture here because this humility issue is so important to God so important to God listen to Paul's letter to the Philippians Philippians 2 verse 1 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill me my joy that he be like-minded and always have this kind of thinking having the same love being of one Accord of one mind listen carefully let nothing be done through strife or vainglory so don't do anything to cause contention or vien glory is that holding about prices doing it go you want to get your recognition everybody with me but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves can you do that can you esteem others better than yourself look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others the reason many of you don't testify you're too selfish and the selfishness is based on pride oh I don't have time this morning but let this mind be in you which also which was also in Christ Jesus so he's saying let this thinking that Jesus had you must also have listen carefully who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but listen listen this goes against half or more of the message ministers who made himself of no reputation can I say that again he made himself of no reputation you know what I said wasn't represent none at the idea he won no reputation I preached it before almost all of the miracles to a point Jesus says tell no one when he huge iris when he realized or merely say tell no one he gives her to tell anybody it was kept a secret what broke the story you know remember what broke his story what broke is were because only toes but equal for around Jesus were what were knowledgeable of the extent of the miracles because he kept telling them don't tell anybody what bro this story is Lazarus that is what broke his story especially since when Jesus was there before they had kicked him out so when he went back where he was kicked out before and raised Lazarus from the dead this story couldn't be contained any more people say I have to tell somebody I tried to keep it locked up I tried to keep it with it but this thing too good and it was that I'd left Jesus on Palm Sunday it was only heels of Lazarus being raised from the dead that led to Palm Sunday where they came from everywhere anybody with me this morning but he made himself of no reputation no it's one thing if people talk about you but the Prophet was on the feel and when he heard he were baptizing in his name he shut down the convention to go and deal with it because he didn't want to tolerate people making a reputation of himself let me come back from there and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself now if Jesus had to humble himself what about you what about me he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him so because of his obedience because of his humility he didn't exalt himself but God exhort him and given him a name which is above every other name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father I'm trying to close out here now you will talk about humility we talk about Jesus eighteen years of silence we know we're talking about rain the Bible says that at age twelve Jesus confounded the priests in the temple you remember this when Mary and Joseph four o'clock Jesus and and they told her what about three four days a week and when they came back they found jesus surrounded by all the priests who were taking notes and he told them told you no mama I'm about my father's business and Jesus was actually explaining things to them they didn't realize and then it stops but when you fast-forward eighteen years later and Jesus comes on the scene and says the Spirit of the Lord is upon me the Bible says it was as his custom he was in the temple so it means this friends that's for 18 years the word sat silently in the temple without seeing a wood now I want you to catch this for a minute for 18 years the book the wood made flesh sat in the temple humble meek I wonder how many services he sat there looking at people take the Scrolls try to interpret it and he would smile as it that's not how I meant it how many times the word made flesh sat in the temple not saying a word because his time was not yet anybody in the house with me this morning [Applause] marked Wiseman he could bridle his tongue some of you can't keep quiet for did you see something is it right in here right in here right in here you have to you have to see something after see something 18 years if at age 12 he confounded them 13 14 15 16 he's counting time but he is the Word made flesh maturing he's learning obedience by whatever suffering the Bible hasn't kept it for us that is not for us to know but we know he's coming into something he's he is bringing himself under subjection he has to bite his tongue humble himself because his time is not yet until the time appointed when he could not break the veil of his ministry at age 30 years old after he comes off the wilderness to return in power and now we can unseal himself after his years of silence can't you humble yourselves a little bit oh we gonna play something softly I'm finished when they whipped him he humbled himself he said like a call of allegiance I could call for soldiers it's not that easy that the power but his humility was the doorway to power can the church say Amen I have to finish after wrap up I have so many quarts haven't touched it yet but it man speaks about Martin you know Paul Iranians Martin he said Martin was so humble that one time a poor man came to the church a beggar and when he saw Martin and he was better but I bet him said as he was preparing to enter the pulpit a beggar came to his study and asked for some closing Martin send the beggar to the head deacon that he control him to leave the man came back to Martin and City dick a time ago Martin stopped going to the pulpit took his robe off give it a beggar and tell the Deacon find me another clothes that night brother man said as Martin preached to would the people of God saw a glow around his person but I ban him said surely that was a great man a true messenger to that age but if Adam said instead he said instead of the humility of and power of the Spirit you cut the world of spread said the very secret of his power was in humility before God and this is what I believe we have been going through these last few months in presuming when God has given the issue for the church to call a halt and back to a prayer life you see you could only pray whenever every stone humility you know because humility brings a consciousness that I can't do it without you Lord I don't want to leave my house without you I don't want to try to preach me I don't know water walk without you because it's not my ability [Music] you think you studied and you achieve the study if your mind don't work what could you study if you lose the ability to remember what will you remember it is god-given ability to remember to learn to read here if it was the cause Gracie to hear all your education you wouldn't have it is that you're doing is that your ability how can you be proud how did you have bribe you didn't teach yourself he allowed you to get understanding I want to close out he said in the message ordination if anything that we want to be is humble cuz that's the secret of power is true humility hallelujah and in a message of grace he said we have got theologians today we've got doctors of divinity we've got great men all over the world that's intellectual and educated but it takes a simplicity of believing God to make his words speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ
