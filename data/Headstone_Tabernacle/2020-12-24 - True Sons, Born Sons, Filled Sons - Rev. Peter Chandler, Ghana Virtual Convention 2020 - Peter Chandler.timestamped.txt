[6:59] from the prophet believers now this
[7:01] 1960 you maybe see that but abraham said
[7:05] he said i am the vine and ye are the
[7:07] branches
[7:08] if a grapevine puts forth a shoot it
[7:11] comes up with plenty blue grapes
[7:14] the next vine it puts out will have
[7:17] pretty blue grapes on it
[7:19] if the first vine came out and they fell
[7:22] under the
[7:22] impact of the holy spirit and they did
[7:25] they did great
[7:26] miracles and signs and sealed their
[7:28] testimony praise god
[7:31] seal their testimony to a world even
[7:33] many of them with their own testimony
[7:35] with their blood they sealed their
[7:37] testimony
[7:38] they went through all kinds of perils
[7:40] and everything to bring the gospel
[7:43] praise god they went through storms
[7:45] hallelujah they went to
[7:47] perils they went through all kinds of
[7:48] trials but they drove home their
[7:50] testimonies
[7:51] that they are sons and daughters for
[7:53] their day praise god if they went
[7:55] through that
[7:56] they suffered they were beaten they were
[7:59] punished
[7:59] they said must we be carried home to
[8:02] heaven
[8:03] on a flowery bed of ease while others
[8:05] fought to win the prize
[8:07] and sell to bloody seas what do we
[8:10] expect to do i must fight if i must
[8:14] reign
[8:15] increase my courage lord praise god
[8:18] but abram said we don't need a new
[8:20] denomination hallelujah
[8:22] we don't need a new gathering we don't
[8:24] need a new convention
[8:26] we don't need a new denomination we
[8:28] don't need a new czech building
[8:30] what we need today is the old time
[8:32] backwood sky blue
[8:34] scene killing pentecostal revival praise
[8:37] god that was born at pentacles
[8:39] and is back into the church again the
[8:42] power of the holy spirit again
[8:44] to bring jesus christ on the scene we
[8:46] want jesus christ on the sin this
[8:48] weekend
[8:49] if the sick walk in here they shall be
[8:51] healed they shall be delivered
[8:53] if you are bound you shall be set free
[8:55] we want jesus christ
[8:57] on the scene praise god sons of god must
[9:00] be manifested
[9:01] praise god and that is why we are here
[9:04] that is our commission
[9:05] that is our purpose that is why god
[9:08] places us on the earth at this time
[9:10] praise god to call jesus on the scene
[9:13] praise god
[9:14] and we see how the world is confused but
[9:17] brother we are standing on the rock of
[9:19] ages
[9:20] we are standing on the rock that cannot
[9:21] be moved no
[9:23] virus can stop the bride no situation
[9:25] can stop the bride
[9:27] no no praise god no persecution no
[9:30] depression
[9:31] can stop that church of the living god
[9:34] praise
[9:35] be the name of the living god so we cry
[9:38] out tonight amen
[9:40] that we will find our place hallelujah
[9:45] amen the prophet said in a hidden light
[9:48] and i'm done praise god
[9:51] hallelujah oh praise god
[9:54] amen he said now i believe
[9:58] that the time that i believe
[10:01] that is the time that the church has
[10:03] arrived at today
[10:05] have we arrived everything is pointing
[10:08] that the coming of the lord is here
[10:10] but before we leave we must check this
[10:12] world with a short quick powerful
[10:15] message
[10:15] that will shake this world praise god
[10:18] and let them know that there are sons
[10:19] and daughters of god upon the face of
[10:21] the earth
[10:22] oh glory to god i believe that that it
[10:25] is the time that the church has arrived
[10:27] at today
[10:28] that the next great move in the church
[10:30] is for god
[10:32] it's not for you now the next great move
[10:34] in the church is for god
[10:36] so it is not your ideas it is not your
[10:39] expectations
[10:40] is what god has decreed for this weekend
[10:43] for sons and daughters of god
[10:45] the next great move is for god after
[10:47] we've seen false alarms
[10:50] praise god but now god will place in his
[10:53] church
[10:53] correctly apostles and prophets and
[10:56] teachers
[10:56] and evangelists not man-made seminary
[10:59] praise god
[11:01] protein but god will place into the
[11:03] church no
[11:04] theology runovers and overnights but god
[11:07] will place
[11:08] in the church as god has chosen
[11:11] god has some sons chosen he has got some
[11:13] children chosen
[11:14] and he's about to place them in this day
[11:17] praise god
[11:19] hallelujah oh glory be to the living god
[11:23] as god has chosen as the holy ghost has
[11:25] tuted his church and raised it up
[11:29] and in there god will adopt her
[11:33] god will adopt into the position of his
[11:36] sons
[11:37] they are already his sons but whatever
[11:40] they
[11:40] are is that but whether they are worthy
[11:43] of the position that he has for them
[11:45] praise god so that is why we are
[11:47] striving now we are sons
[11:49] but we are looking to be placed we are
[11:51] looking to be put in our position
[11:53] as sons and daughters of god hallelujah
[11:57] oh praise god and the last one the seed
[12:01] is not aired with the shock
[12:03] but the problem said the world is in the
[12:04] sudden condition and the church has went
[12:07] into sodom
[12:08] with it like lord and his wife that is
[12:10] why the love of many is what's
[12:12] cold but not the bride because we have
[12:15] got the material on the edge right now
[12:18] praise god to rise up about the deadness
[12:20] rise up about the sudden condition
[12:23] to find our position and i say
[12:26] that there is an electric somewhere in
[12:28] the world oh are you one of them
[12:31] i know you are one of them there is an
[12:33] electric
[12:34] somewhere in the world that is pulling
[12:36] out
[12:37] and set aside from those things praise
[12:40] god and the manifestation of god
[12:43] has attracted his attention we are at
[12:45] the last days
[12:47] praise god so we are here if we are at
[12:50] the last days we must see the
[12:52] manifestation
[12:53] we must see the signs we must see the
[12:55] wonders we must see the character of the
[12:57] spirit of god moving his sons and
[12:59] daughters of god
[13:00] positionally placing you in your place
[13:03] so this weekend i trust that the lord
[13:05] will bless you
[13:06] praise god open your heart open your
[13:08] mind
[13:09] don't come here fixated brother probably

[55:53] opens for you
[55:57] this is god's way you can think about
[56:01] you can try
[56:02] to understand you can read read the
[56:04] whole bible
[56:05] you may know the whole bible that is
[56:09] this is this is not
[56:13] the dynamic you can explain the to
[56:15] others the
[56:16] kingdom of god but it needs a
[56:20] dynamic it's neither that personal
[56:25] to you you are my savior you see that's
[56:29] dynamic
[56:31] you are my healer
[56:34] you have healed me completely
[56:38] you are my all in all you see that's
[56:42] dynamic
[56:43] that's why the testimony of jesus christ
[56:46] is so important you testify
[56:50] in these heavenly places coming closer
[56:53] and closer
[56:54] down into your soul and your
[56:57] new creation starts when you are born

[57:12] and you become full of jesus christ
[57:20] there is a power in the wind of the holy
[57:23] spirit
[57:24] already so the holy spirit lays in the
[57:28] word in the promise when you read
[57:30] what jesus said speaks in the bible but
[57:33] the disciples speak
[57:34] inspired by the holy spirit there is a
[57:37] spirit
[57:39] and the bible says we are sealed by the
[57:42] spirit of promise
[57:44] in this promising spirit and you are
[57:46] sealed by it
[57:48] and you get filled
[57:52] every day every hour
[57:55] this is a normal christian life
[57:59] i am not there
[58:03] but i press to it and it will come
[58:07] stronger and stronger and people will
[58:10] not understand me
[58:11] because it will not be me anymore
[58:14] it will be him he will change us
[58:18] our situation our home our marriages
[58:21] everything our families he is doing this
[58:25] change and it is a new
[58:28] creation it is him personal it is his

[58:41] is in every detail coming into your soul
[58:45] sitting on the throne and you just
[58:48] surrender i'm not saying lord

[1:00:03] experience and
[1:00:04] i can say this because you live by that
[1:00:06] you know this personal experience
[1:00:09] it's so important how to to know how to
[1:00:12] set the wings
[1:00:13] the power is already in the heavenly
[1:00:16] place is
[1:00:17] already there it's it's an you need to
[1:00:20] know how
[1:00:22] and it is not trying like a bird trying
[1:00:25] to run
[1:00:26] until you get speed to get up it's not
[1:00:29] cis
[1:00:30] it's by his grace i'm wrong but you have
[1:00:33] staying all the wrongness out of me
[1:00:36] and we are only a vessel
[1:00:39] we are not more than a vessel and 16
[1:00:41] elements and it's
[1:00:42] him we are members of his body
[1:00:46] our wrestle is our 16 elements and he
[1:00:50] fills our emptiness

[1:00:58] problems set sail into it
[1:01:02] free in jesus christ you begin to go
[1:01:05] inside god
[1:01:09] when the wind of the holy ghost lifts
[1:01:10] you we need that wind from pentecost
[1:01:13] from the original pentecost it's the
[1:01:15] same wind blowing again
[1:01:17] it's jesus christ in every detail coming
[1:01:19] into your soul
[1:01:20] and you fellowship with him and he
[1:01:22] starts to know you
[1:01:24] you open up he said this is my problem
[1:01:26] this is i have done
[1:01:28] since i still keep will you help me
[1:01:31] can you do this for me you become into a
[1:01:34] relationship
[1:01:36] and it and it's a growing
[1:01:40] and then he tells you believe that your
[1:01:42] old nature
[1:01:44] has left you brother brahms explained to
[1:01:48] to a browser he said it's still behind
[1:01:50] there not in front
[1:01:52] because in front you see christ
[1:01:54] crucified
[1:01:55] the world is crucified you see it it's
[1:01:57] but it's behind it's sticking behind you
[1:01:59] it's the old nature always try to stick
[1:02:02] on you
[1:02:03] but it's no more in here in your soul
[1:02:07] is no unbelief
[1:02:10] it's you see all these seeds from the
[1:02:13] word of god
[1:02:16] are already in you but sealed up
[1:02:19] but when his grace comes he has
[1:02:22] saved me it's it's a glory coming down
[1:02:27] he has saved me the glory he has filled
[1:02:30] me
[1:02:31] his glory he brings me through
[1:02:35] see when when this comes down it opens
[1:02:39] every word this glory
[1:02:42] comes and is opening what's already
[1:02:45] sealed in you
[1:02:46] it's opening and your face starts to
[1:02:49] shine
[1:02:51] all these thoughts are going all has
[1:02:53] left you
[1:02:55] isn't that wonderful
[1:03:01] let me trust this this one
[1:03:06] this two one quote
[1:03:10] and then i try to finish confess you're
[1:03:14] wrong
[1:03:16] we have to know how to sail into that
[1:03:18] wind
[1:03:21] and to to start is to confess you are
[1:03:25] wrong to him and brother ram said i am
[1:03:29] always
[1:03:30] wrong and we confess it
[1:03:37] birth pains it's hard to die
[1:03:40] but die right now
[1:03:45] die come out of your own unbelief come
[1:03:48] out of it
[1:03:49] this is the word of god made manifest
[1:03:52] just
[1:03:52] as it was when jesus come on the earth
[1:03:56] it's jesus christ again
[1:03:58] among you proven he was problem was a
[1:04:01] manifested
[1:04:02] son of god
[1:04:06] this new creation came into full power
[1:04:10] besides his mistakes
[1:04:14] christ knows he is a judge
[1:04:17] he has paid for all the mistakes all the
[1:04:21] failures
[1:04:22] all the sin he has paid
[1:04:26] it's gone
[1:04:32] and jesus is coming again says his
[1:04:35] spirit
[1:04:36] you see you must make sure that his
[1:04:40] spirit that comes to you
[1:04:41] is jesus christ personally to you
[1:04:45] in every aspect in
[1:04:48] every detail except his physical body
[1:04:51] brother branham said so he showed us
[1:04:54] away
[1:04:55] he showed us how to fly
[1:04:59] it's jesus coming again that's his
[1:05:01] spirit he's so close to the earth
[1:05:04] so close to coming that he is ready to
[1:05:06] receive you
[1:05:07] if you are ready to receive him how does
[1:05:09] receiving start
[1:05:11] lord i am wrong i cannot receive it in
[1:05:14] my condition
[1:05:16] cleans me
[1:05:19] and is cleaning you this is what he is
[1:05:21] doing
[1:05:22] by his grace and by the face once
[1:05:25] delivered to the saints
[1:05:27] we believe this
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:33] it's just knowing how to set your wings
[1:05:37] in the power of his face
[1:05:40] and when the holy ghost comes in rides
[1:05:43] and waves
[1:05:45] higher deeper more more
[1:05:49] more because is a longing in this new
[1:05:52] creature has a longing
[1:05:54] it wants to grow it wants to become
[1:05:56] adopted
[1:05:57] wants to become fully
[1:06:01] in charge
[1:06:04] fully in charge and this is what the
[1:06:07] process will preach
