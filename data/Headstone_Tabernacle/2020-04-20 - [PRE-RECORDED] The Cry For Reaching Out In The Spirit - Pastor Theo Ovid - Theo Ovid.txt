of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I said here we go when he saw what was next when he saw what was about to unfold what did he do he just said he saw it he fell asleep and on it no I said my face under the Lord to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and

nothing much Simmons means nothing much as I come into church I'm nothing happening and my Lord and I could imagine those garden Frosty's they were not mowed I wonder Jesus came to the temple and he found a place which is written and it literally thought was just another Sabbath day another Sillman another man given our tests the money until jesus said these notable words this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ear there's no longer prophecy you know is I'm gonna make this history that I just read fulfilling the world my god somebody Hey what does he mean get the moat running out put them out and destroy mount and he become the rejected Messiah to be ejected stone but that's the scriptures the stone that the builders refused have to come to a spot that you I beat your custom on is rejected your life is rejected your core is rejected because when you caught your court in you because you I don't pull it off the book come on shame and somebody and the very stone that the bill is refused come on give the Lord a shout you might be a funny-looking stone you don't know what to fit you don't know you don't know what to do with you when they see you the fine you like trouble come

[Applause] jingo to know your struggle you may be seasoned they rejected so and he began to heal I began the status ministry ohhohh the Ministry of Christ all along is a big man he he Maurice : since it twelve you know about his father's business what he could do at age 12 Unni be in the world he can't want even Asakusa he conquer so the residual from each of the thirty yet the right man grew and but you because you have to know where it is written Daniel went back in the books to find out get desperation upon his soul you can't just feel this and you want to do is no sign of what God bliss and when you know what God will is no developer to stop you if you don't feel it you know God said it that is gonna happen it got to come to pass oh are you with me this morning Oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord listen to power man he says the other day somebody said but the Branham do you think is wrong to do a certain thing I said what are you questioning about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all just stay with that when you start to do anything if it's a question whether it's right or wrong steer away from it don't point it at all then you know you're right I want to hear amen on that I want everybody to say Amen on that it take another disclosure agreement I heard you said that I agree with what you said there's a question don't do it then he said then you know you're right okay so I'm continuing now all things ought to be considered peripherally first seek first the kingdom of God on his righteousness and all these other things will be added here we go I am positive sure this morning if men and woman could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude would be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed that's 10% seen I think one appointee termometer even temperature to monitor I really the game because the code is what I want I'm positive Shore this morning as men and women could only get into the position to where they're sure they're thinking the attitudes well you know people care about and says as if trials is not for them maybe trials is only free pastel or maybe past trials or different ministry people because the in ministry you know almost like if people want a priesthood the same thing God and we hit they love it they want Emmanuel they want somebody to follow he's my priest I love my priests because the priest welcome to seat for me I could do whatever I want but he is the man but you see what set the whole thing when Jesus died the veil rent from the top to the bottom the show it no high priests going in once a year and everybody wait and wait them know here at the Valen everyone are you going not once a year every day [Applause] daily my god you may be seated daily you could break that feel and go into the presence of Almighty God and then bought the work daily before your sleep instead of taking in some movie or some kind of show some kind of negative stuff you could go into the presence of God sleep like a baby in his arms right in his presence you wake up in his presence you poured the bed in his presence you get up in his presence you live until in his presence you deny yourself to pick up your cross your fallen nearly come on same and somebody you actually following him not the pastor you

you like a lump you doing nothing listen to this one you southerners remember your history when up here when Grant was gettin just across the river they had a boy OD on guard duty and the rebels was across the river and this boy walking along here kind of DS along with the dreams of his sweetheart he left his post of duty and went on to put some violets this ain't a sweet out he didn't mean to do wrong he went then at that time there was a spy ready from the southern army and descripton they look around they followed his southern army was 2 or 3 times the size of generous ground well what happened the boy come back on the posted ug not doing what happened the spy had already been there now what happened this storm across the river drove them plumb back into the state that boy was shot an hour later they didn't have no objection to him pickin valance it wasn't that he done it what he didn't do he didn't stand at this post of duty he didn't guard the post like he was supposed to and he spoiled the whole day nothing wrong with picking violence with that but not then it is war you have a post-it half enemy when wall over you could you see a bunch of flowers not one violet its Hunza violets but not then wrong time and over time and he was supposed to stand in supposed to duty and he got killed oh let's do something let's stick with all our hearts i when the day of judgment come we can say God I did the very best I could and you know I did and we know that we can do that's all it expected I when it get to a place that the people that love God will show everything that got into the revival with prayer seek God's face seek God's face call out in the order of the night for mercy and get the name but even so for I'll tell you we will stop the mode of every critic we will not know every formal thing that's standing up and that's in the camp Oh hallelujah then he said the other night I was coming over here a few nights ago and the Lord met me in the room with a vision the same as I see on the platform of the places and said here's what the matter with the church they've got so much selfishness everywhere the Church of the Living God has got so much difference so much did that till they grieve the Holy Spirit away from them and that's what's exactly what it is brother sister until we humble ourselves and become a like lamb so the tough can lead us again Oh hallelujah he saved the composer writes something we find out it is not acted right then there's something that happens there's something like him when we see he who composed it made it up wrote it out and the symphony explain it out it's the wrong note is something wrong the director give the wrong motion he said we are way over here in the book now oh let me release it and that's the matter today my Lutheran veteran my Baptist brethren Pentecost our brethren we can't live in the light of Luther he was a reformer we appreciate his part but we play that out we are way over here at the back of the book was he's talking about the Tundra's he said we are way over here in the back of the book we and paint up like that and the only way watch you are ever going to be able to do it my brethren is this region of the world or different paths of the world I might say there's only one way for the director to do is to get in the same spirit of the composer hallelujah that's when the church is in the symphony in the same spirit of the composer and the five whole directors or the men's of the record could direct with the same tune we are not called to write our own script but a Branum already wrote the music we supposed to direct it and say what the tape said say what the tape say what the tape see once witnessed-- prettily composer we're gonna be saying what that tape say we're gonna be playing the same sheet music because he comes from heaven come on same as some party he's cut it from up still hallelujah I went somebody write a music piece is one music piece Adonia interpretation

Inlet than the music we are the plate for this sheet called right the sheet closed and the preference sheet music when the shop repeat paper there we played according to the sheet hallelujah then the
