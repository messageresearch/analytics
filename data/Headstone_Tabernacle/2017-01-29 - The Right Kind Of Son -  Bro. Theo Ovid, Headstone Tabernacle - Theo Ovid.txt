blessed be the name of Jesus it's always a privilege to be in the house of God so welcome amen and amen and amen so before we get into the message this morning I just want to finish off some things that we shared last Sunday didn't really finish the message so I want to kind of finish off some of that then we go into the service for today it's good to be here it's good to feel the church lit under that that fire of prayer hallelujah praise God I know you're getting somewhere when you're praying when there's a burden to pray and you want to press your way I know you're getting somewhere isn't that right and listen to what the prophet said in influence you put one or two good members in a church that is really on fire for God it will do something for that church more than 40 Revival could have we just need two good members that's on fire for God people on fire for all kind of thing but for God cuz when you fire for God the devil had a he he he had to pass you by he he not interested in coming near you because you are on fire for God oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah a good cleansed member with the face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God watch when somebody get sick they will call that person to come and pray you might make fun of them and and say the tire deflated you might all this thing but let death strike you one time when them struggles begin to come then you'll see who is the real sincere person in the church oh praise the name here my Lord send me let my influence be upon others let me live for Christ to live is Christ and die is gain so this prophet Isaiah that come into the presence of God it had an effect upon him and it's one kind of effect when you get into that kind of presence you recognize you are nothing you recognize you are unworthy you can't go in that presence and come with any other story when you're going that presence is one effect Hallelujah and then when that hit Isaiah he said wo is me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among a people of unclean lips oh glory to God hallelujah then he got that coals come upon his lips then he could say here am I send me Oh Glory to God is three CES confession then cleansing then commission oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that he confess is not right he said his cleansing never come by a Creed I love this it come by fire all the teaching all the Mysteries all the quates all the word word word cleansing a coming by that it coming by fire fire coming down into your heart Fire coming down to your life Fire coming down to your spirit that's nothing with how you used to be and how you are and how you grow up fire will burn all of that praise God it have nothing to do with what country you come from what language you speak if you're tall if you're short it have nothing to do with that fire will burn all of that Holy Fire from God that's what the church needs that's what the people needs that's what the preacher needs that's what the ministers need fire Holy Ghost fire real fire isn't that right hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord now here is the truth of God I don't care what dream you had what kind of Prophecy you give if it isn't God's word it is wrong if it don't compare with the word that's the trouble today one has a dream one has a vision one has a tongue one has a revelation it got the whole thing so messed up on everything else you got denominations and broke everything up you ought to bring it to a final Foundation that's God's word churches will build upon one say Jesus is coming on a white house so that the White Horse church and I've seen him on a vision they will make a church of that kind then he's coming on a cloud they will make it that kind break them up separate it and call one another Buzzard Roose L hang out and everything like that why brother it goes to show in the first place your heart is not right with God when you do that we are brothers we must stick by one another we need one another oh praise the name of the Lord praise God let me skip down here quickly he going to get this true here now then but was speaking he's talking about the blind man and these guys tried to terrorizing him saying God heal you God heal you and and say God heal you and and because Jesus healed the man and he the man is a sinner and they they're trying to label Jesus a sinner the man said whether this man is a sinner I I don't know but one thing I do know I once was blind but now I see whether he's a sinner or not I don't know but I have a result I have a testimony I have proof of the effect of what this man is ministering and preaching he did something to me I was blind but now I see so if you want to talk your sin talk and he off talk you could keep on talking but one thing I know this is my personal testimony I once was blind but now I see this man got in the action would you believe him also would you come and worship also would you accept the testimony also oh hallelujah praise God he got into action praise God his three wings those terrorist were flying with oh praise God one they flying with one to p PE Wings covering the face and covering the feet and but I'm talk about humility is not reverence and in action he said what we seen what we have seen his promises in the last days what we have seen ourselves ought to put each one of us in action not coma toes where you freeze not in a coma it's supposed to put in action not rusting out am action Hallelujah Pray when they get in some take some walks amen yeah using your body enough got to get in action and the church get tired saying now praise God praise somebody call us the exercising church people going getting up and sitting back down getting up and sitting back down get they custom just sitting down and listening to the preacher but there a church that you have you're getting exercise inside of here time to get into action people sit down long enough they sit down too long they de in the seat what we've seen promises in the last days what we have seen ourselves ought to put each one into action but you know why we don't cover our faces and our feet right our wings won't work we got these Wings spread out and These Wings spread out try to spread out we are just F in air come yourself humble yourself and then get in action don't get in action and you're not humbl yourself you have no action to get in your pride and your arrogance and nobody can speak to you and you can't be corrected and you have to defend and block anything coming you feel like it's missiles coming praise God God want to wreck your world God want to change your life if you're good as you are stay as you are but if you want to be transformed say Lord cut me hit me beat me Strip Me shap me mold me correct me whatever it takes but I don't want to be the same like I was Oh Glory when God fin but Jacob he had a different walk he was a limping Prince you can ask God I want to be a straight walking prince well stay like Jacob he was walking straight and good but when God finished with him he had a limp he had a limp he had a limp he was bruised he was pattered and sometime God take you through stuff to leave your bruis and battered to shake you out of your amen yourself and your world and all that what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Phoenix that people would fly from Europe to see what was taking place they will say this is the testimony this is a testimony they will say not you have plenty nice pastors and preachers and apostles and Prophets no no they will say there's a place in Arizona called the Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested so he's not talking about talk he is talking about a manifestation what happened a church get something and make something with what they get you take what you get and do something with it Glory like sh we talk about in pray meeting all every time he he plant his crop and and about to harvest the Philistines come every year every year like you laboring in vain Philistines only comeing and taking your Harvest and one day I'm I'm going to say enough is enough you get a old Ox gold that's the

more minutes until the seventh of Rian 10 is not even wrot is being manifested oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be of the Lord my when I light struck Rebecca she knew something within her Hallelujah and that brought her to Isaac she veiled her face she didn't want no more to do with her own thinking all right Isaac was a thinking then on oh Hallelujah never saw Isaac before El only

thoughts to what this Isaac is all about all she thinking about I can't wait to see him I can't wait to meet him I want to ENC coner him has nothing to do with her it has nothing to do with [Applause] you Isaac was a thing in an on Prophecy and the church here we go when it strikes the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen out of the nomination churches so he's not talking about Pentecost Baptist and and and charismatic P Catholics he's not talking about that outside of that that means how to be among us the bride the people in this message when the church strike the power of God not quoting books and tapes not that we had it for 4050 years when it strikes the power that we spoke about what word is this the word preaching with power and when it strike [Music] [Applause] that out of the Catholic Church wherever it is here we go when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to [Applause] people oh yeah oh yeah oh God I'm feeling good hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated by the way I get some homework last week how many read bird pains or listen to bird painbody raise your hands raise your hand stick them up high okay we get on next week again another week again for the rest of you to read it and listen to it oh Hallelujah but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to people them that's predestinated like you people here I'm still reading to eternal life sees it and walks in it it's a super sign you have to see it and walk in it oh my when God give it to you nobody could take it out nobody could rub you isn't that right Hallelujah and then he says when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing in the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just real to us as it was on Pentecost how they groan and cry in their labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and then he put in their gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge Gifts of healing all kind of Miracles but say every gift going to be back in the church before Jesus Christ come again the gift of discernment the gift of wisdom the gift of knowledge the gift of Hallelujah Miracles the gift of faith every gift gift of tongues interpretation of every [Applause] gift he said the Holy Ghost fall within five minutes every gift going to be back in the church we're going to need every gift to fight this devil every gift going to be we needed hallelujah hallelujah praise God Praise godall Jesus said say to this mountain you see what taking place that's the ministry we are enter into amen we are way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus we have got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twile of an eye to go out or we will not go why don't the ministers tell the people that that if they do have Rapture Fai they will not go you're on your way to the tribulation with your books and with your tapes it have to have Rapture in fi so it cannot be sitting down hoping wondering gambling if you're going to make it it's not that it's to actually make a Revival a church that is effectively empowered by [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God you talking about faith to be changed in a moment and you don't have faith for your own self right now for God to change your walk and talk and action and attitude so before you go to Raptor in faith you got to go to Faith to believe you going to be transformed and all your excuse going to be burnt up because all of us are humans God knows that Moses was a human too and Moses was giv him a commission he killed a man and run out of Egypt isn't that right and after 40 years when God did confront him and Corner him he was still making excuses after 40 years he didn't get rid of his excuses he's I can't talk he said I make M continue you understand that when Mo R his excuses go said continue continue continue you're still going no more excuses [Applause] M can tell God I don't have maths I don't have English and my grammar not so good God said okay anything else I do have a subject I never even pass the exams go say okay you ready to go now you got to go no human excuses required nothing required all I want is you that's what we want to get [Laughter] through brother bam he said we got to have we got to have Rapture in faith in a church that can be changed in a moment and pick of an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry it will be there it will be there prophecy are you ready is everybody ready for the prophecy when the power of this church Rises it will bring its Brethren not if not I'm wondering he said when when that's mean ready or not it's [Applause] coming may be seated when the power of this church Rises it will bring its Brethren the power of that church Rises it will bring its Brethren the power of that church Rises it will bring the other Brethren then there'll be a general Resurrection so it's not Resurrection by convention is resurrection by the power of God rising in the churches oh hallelujah hallelujah but said I don't want to choke it to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods amen then he skip shot he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain Satan took it over watch but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time time when the permid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when when the pyit gets to its top is that is where the full sons of God will manifest it when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan got from him that it belongs to him hallah oh my God so he's talking about sons of God coming into maturity coming into position coming into a place of power to take back from the Devil all what he had there isn't that right praise the name of the Lord praise God praise God praise God hallelujah glory to God brother B I skip something here now but Samson with big powerful helpless Big Frame all at one something happen you say once more Lord every fiber in his being begin to be filled with the power of God Amen if the church could only get to that again all the way from the preacher to the deacon to the lady every fiber every member of the body would be filled with the power of God those big Brony muscles straighten up and he crush it together let me die with them Lord let me die with them you rais me up to destroy it now I've built myself up around it let me destroy myself with it my reputation whatever it is let me destroy it I want to see the power of God again and always when the power of God comes in the walls that you have built around you fall yeah denominational walls will crush and God will be known again CH not loaded with walls they seiz it high high high but when the power gone you know what walls falling down people will scream and run out you know why they were born to connect with God's presence and power so Revival in our day how can we have a regular Revival giver when the

who I am a child of God well I'm no longer I'm no longer Slave To Fear I am who child of God Amen we want to turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 3 Galatians chapter 3 and we go over to Galatians chapter 4 and also Romans chapter 8 we want to read Matthew 3: 16 and 17 Galatians 3 from: 26- 29 and we read Galatians 4 1-7 and Romans 8:14 to9 we go to Matthew chapter 3 16 and 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased we go across to Galatians chapter 3 verse 26 for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then Abraham's seed Hallelujah and HS according to Promise chapter 4 now I say that the heir as long as he's a child differ it nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the Lord law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son yes sir and then and if a son then an heir of God through Christ we go to Romans 8 14- 19 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of Goden for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father the spirit itself be the witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God let's have a word of prayer father we thank you for your word thank you Lord we thank you for the gift and the Revelation to call you our father huj and when your disciples ask you to teach them how to pray the first thing you said Is Our Father God may you reveal yourself today Hallelujah to your sons and daughters may they get a revelation of their own sunship who they are where they come from where they going granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen just greet upon somebody before take a SE Shake somebody hands praise the Lord hallelujah when you take your seat Give the Lord a shout of [Applause] praise the father seeketh such to worship him to worship Him in spirit and in truth so this morning I have a title and this have been a sort of a burden or inspiration upon my heart on my mind upon my spirit for some time now and the title is the right kind of son that's the title the right kind of son I a subject the adoption of sons and have an inspiration the father's business right that's tonight's Mission the father's business it's your choice if you want to work in it but it's the father's business and that is Luke 2:49 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me was it not that I must be about my father's business age 12 all right and he's talking about father's business this is a prayer from adoption but the BR up bless us now as we approach the word and father thou knowest the reason that I'm approaching the word from this very scripture here it's because that I feel you want me to do it this way it's your Divine will it is your order it's the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle as our brother said in his prayer to you not long ago you have trained us so long Lord father give us our ranks put us out there so that we supposed to do what we supposed to do so we can be about our father's business for we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen amen now Galatians 4 it says that the heir as long as he a child differ nothing from a servant amen he's a son because he's born in the house he didn't join the house he was born in the house and there's an appointed time for the father to positionally place that son or that child but the child have to be trained trained tutored given special test to see if he could handle the father's business because if he does doesn't prove himself he will make a mess on the job right the father don't want mess on the job the father want a son train be before he put him in the position of authority and power are you with me Hallelujah today forgive me I'm just I'm just in my Hallelujah in my groove right now today I am not talking about a man's office Lord position I'm not talking about Elder Deacon trustee Pastor Bishop Pope I am talking about the man not the position amen so that covers all of us at the same level I'm not talking about principal teacher Taxi Driver whatever worker not not what you do not your job not your career I'm talking about who you [Applause] are it is not the office that will be [Music] adopted it is the man that's going to be adopted it's not the office that God said I am pleased it is the man that God said this is my son in whom I am well pleased it is not Pastor or teacher or Apostle being adopted it is the son the right kind of a son oh could we give the Lord some [Applause] Praises God has all kind of sons yes disobedient Sons rebellious Sons backsliding Sons he's not looking for pastor Bishop Elders he's looking for sons that he could positionally place as pastors Bishops Elders whatever whatever position he's looking for sons that he can place in a position of influence with power Hallelujah so this thing about son has to do with relationship with father am Hallelujah so new word comes in relationship the way in which two or more people or things are connected a state of being connected state of being connected by blood or marriage Hallelujah and we have to be connected by both by Jesus blood and by marrying to him blood and marriage so it was a Trill for me to see how much Jesus was connected to the father in every turn and as you go back to the Bible you begin to see Jesus was really into this relationship with his father the son can do nothing except the father show him first the father has given me all things into by power it's not me that do it the works it's the father in me that the works when you see me you see the Father the father is greater than I oh hallelujah praise God the son can do nothing except he see the so Jesus was into it Hallelujah this really no no notice there's no church inside of there now all right all right all right there's no office inside of there I a pastor Mary and you're the pastor secretary and no there's nothing like that that there this is just father and Son but was praying he said oh heavenly father I thank thee tonight because we are living in the hour of preparation you are preparing the people to believe all things Hallelujah do you know say missing limbs will be restored I have never seen that before but it's going to be let me just shake your faith a little think about it now missing limbs will be restored by this power we are talking about by these manifestation of the sons of God this what we talking about when men speak and the word is created just like that Hallelujah Jesus Take bread and multiply it he take fish and multiply it but sons of God don't have to have anything this is going back to Let There Be you not hearing me this is going back to Genesis this is going back with the book that Adam lost this is bringing to effect the book that Adam had bringing it into manifestation people would fly from everywhere to see that oh you're not hearing me you're not hearing me you're not hearing [Applause] me you make you not hearing what I'm saying you have to get the police force to block people from coming to see that they will come to see that all of a sudden what Adam had has been restored and the power is now on the earth hallah the treasure is now in Earth vessels in Sons the right kind of a son oh hallelujah hallelujah oh let's continue praise God praise God are you having a time there this morning this was a message burning upon me and got got to forgive me it's right in me right now I hope it ride in me like it ride in you ride can of a [Applause] son all right let's go further brother manam you are preparing the people to believe all things we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you are calling a people and have given them the Holy Ghost and now you are trying to call out that group of sons all right to adopt them we realize this he still praying that the Old Law was a son was born into the home he was a son but the tutor raised him and when he comes of age if he been the right kind of a son he was taken out put a purple robe on in a ceremony and adopted and that is what you are trying to do to these Full Gospel people now to get them out to themselves somewhere alone with you in faith to adopt them into the kingdom and give them the right to go forth and do the things you [Applause] did so I want you to shake off your church s and put on son self you're not hearing me you not hearing me oh I'm going to listen I'm going to shout for you I'm going to say hallelujah for you I'm going to enjoy this service I'm going to preach myself happy I'm going to be in the [Applause] word see you don't have to study who think you're backslid and who think you're not right and you think forget all that all them backsliding just like you don't think nobody ahead of you it's one little race everybody had to hit that line can hear what I'm [Applause] saying hallelujah so shake off that church self put on your son self I'm no longer a slave of fear God has not given us the spirit of bondage of Fe he has given the spirit of sunship whereby we cry AB father Oh Glory good we give the Lord a shout in the house not ABA preacher not ABA past he didn't say that he said AB [Applause] father h Hallelujah that's you may be seated let's let's let's throw down these Church walls and bring you into your place the church the revelation of the church is to bring you into the position of a revelation of your [Applause] sunship Hallelujah those ministers want to kill me for preaching this I'm messing with the Church World break down Break Down The W I'm messing with the church Kingdom but that's Church Kingdom that's not the kingdom of God because Jesus said behold the kingdom is within you come on now preach back to preach back to me somebody he never put the kingdom in some building oh give the Lord a shout in the house do I hear a shout in the house he never put it in a place he said behold the kingdom is within [Applause] you you may be seated so we know before we have we can be adopted we have to be we have to enter into our place of trying where we'll be tested and proven for sanctification and behavior all right and obedience to the father's word father's word Jesus Hebrews 5'8 though he was a son right though he was a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered let that so let that soak and you complainers who sit here and you know who you are all right I want you to think about that though he was a son he learned obedience by the pressure and the test and whatever he had to go through he leared it obedience is not aut itic is manual drive you have to learn it you have to push it it's not press D come on give the Lord a shout in the hes notice there's no church here now there's no distance between the pulpit and you we are all Sons I'm and a son in a position to speak these things but you are son in a position to hear these things God is Not adopting the bullpit God is Not adopting the position he's adopting Sons and Daughters do I hear a scream in the house do I shout in the H be on on a Revival a Revival of Love A Revival of Holiness a Revival of power may be seated when a father finds a child obedient how he likes to come and say Sir this is the holy spirit reporting the tror your boy is a perfect child how obedient your child are how they love to worship [Applause] youall could he say that about you [Applause] hold the love to how they love to worship [Applause] you and some of you still there how I to smile at you go you smiling on God God don't want that smile from you he smiling back is worship that's what makes him God when you open your mou and B Hallelujah when you open your mouth and say praise the Lord when you raise your [Applause] hands the word god itself mean OB of worship so if you're not worshiping you're not you don't making him feel like he's God you must be your own God you don't need him okay let's continue oh they love to worship you they gather together they raise their hands tears run on their cheeks they are full of joy how the Holy Spirit must love to do that for God I'm reading this not my notes this from the prophet for God is an object of worship and God wants to be Worship in spirit and in truth Jesus said so but we get so staty we just can't make a grunt mhm where's that M M M where's that keep that for yourself keep that mhm for yourself oh the four beast 24 elders just say Amen this one cast down the crown this one start a worship and thousand than Hallelujah Glory blessing honor power might belong to the lamb forever and [Applause] ever you may be seated nobody know the trouble I've seen so I can't worship right now nobody know but Jesus yeah you still continue with your own trouble you better start to worship because you have your troubles you can help your own troubles God had to help you and he say to worship oh give the Lord some Praises let me be seated worship expresses a level of faith because it's not about you it's not even about your feelings because you are actually making a sacrifice your belly pain you have heart pain you have stress pain you have children pain you have family pain you all kind of pain but you decide to say hallelujah thank you Jesus God knows there a sacrifice you are Defying Gravity because pressure supposed to have your shoulder so oh God nobody know the trouble I see nobody knows that in truth but when you shake yourself up shake back your shoulders you stand up as a man you take your pressure as a man for I reckon that the pressure and the charge of this present world is not worthy to be compared with the glory that God is about to unveil unfold reveal [Applause] manifest be seated we could say Amen how the Holy Spirit must dread to say that to the father hold he grunting God ask for report Holy Spirit say I'm next you know mean let me talk about she let me talk about he let me talk about the right kind of a son because that one only grunting that one only blinking the ey and watching so put that same person at carnival put them in a effect they watching so you know no they tapping dancing the TA in the foot and like that but in church it's stiff like if they got inoculation or something so inoculation hand stiff the hand stiff like they get some kind of injection or something so yes the devil inject you inject you with unbelief because you recognize that the devil deceive all all will worship the Beast all will worship Lucifer except those whose names on the book and if you see your name on the book you have to believe you have to behave like John when John saw his name John was filled with the Holy Ghost John could have behave himself and say I am John filled with the Holy Ghost let me take a seat and what who misbehaving said but John start to misbehave he was the first one he said all in heaven all under the earth I John he wanted to give his own testimony about the power of worship the power of praise when you see your [Applause] name that has nothing to do with your sins that has nothing to do with your sins that has nothing to do with your sins it has to do with you seeing your [Applause] name watch you may be seated but when we are obedient and love him and praise him and give him glory how the Holy Spirit must love to bring this to him how he say father you know what your son is just like you he say is a chip off the old block he loves you he's obedient now if that boy is no good yet he's a son he's never nothing but a son because he's born a son but if he's not obedient and the right kind of a son son he just continues a son without any [Music] reward so today choose your [Applause] choice once a son always a son but if you want to be a place son you have to be the right kind of a [Applause] son so we are not questioning your sunship we not questioning your salvation you're not questioning if you die you going to meet the Lord and so we're not questioning that you may be seated all right because this this end time Rapture promise is not for them who who die and went on to be the Lord we who are alive and remain we are the ones that have to get into that channel to bring the rest up [Applause] so every believer every brother that die and G on is more burden on the bride is more pressure for Perfection because you have to come to Perfection to bring a resurrection that why the devil don't want us to be perfect he want you to be good a cour here but Perfection is what promised not good God is the enemy of perfect Oh Glory to God in other words Perfection is his life in you it's not what you can do what you can do is very good but when his life come inside of you it's [Applause] perfect so that obedient son he had a placing of that son when he get in the age a certain age he's taken out into a public place and there a great ceremony is made out before the public now it's not the son parading himself is not the son of a flag say I am a son and you know who I am no no it's not that it's the father bringing the son in public is his father is identifying his son he don't want to hide him under no Bushell he bring on and said this is my son I am pleased I am behind him I am backing him up don't fool with him I am with himall this is my son I want to let you know I'm identifying myself with him that has nothing to do with the minister Association that has nothing to do with the church the Elder the Deacon has nothing do with that that has to do with father and son and son Hallelujah and you said watch he said now watch and then the father adopts his own son into the family then after that the son name is good on the check as his dad's it's a public ceremony it have no private adoption where I can't tell you I can't tell you I can't tell you don't tell me don't tell me I don't want to know Hallelujah don't tell me I don't want to know it's a public ceremony hallelu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I can't speak it I can't speak it don't speak it speak it because it's not it it's not you doing anything brother BR say he will let it be made known among men if you want to keep it down he will take look look him look at me look at send a for to pray for send people for to pray for send cases straight to you send them because you are the son Hallelujah he went the sister haty right and he was testifying about the squirrels he spoke Let There Be squirrel and she start to speak and she said that's nothing but the truth brother Bram and she said the right thing and the Holy Spirit dropped down upon him hallu who is him the right kind of a son and say whatever she wants give it to her Hallelujah not not not ask me for it for her you know you give it to [Applause] her do you see that do you understand what we are talking about now all that the father had all that he pour into Christ all that was in God he pour into Christ Christ pour us into the church now watch the son's signity is just as good as his father so what God is telling bam you sign the check son sign the check whatever she want sign it whatever monk you want sign it you are here Shou in the house release it to her you got the power and authority to do [Applause] that now watch he say if you want your sister sick could be healed s in a wheelchair she was poor very poor if you want how much money you get that Hallelujah and she thinking and she getting offers take take take she could take anyone but in her soul she had two sons that is more than money that is more than a sister being well she said I want the salvation of my two boys listen to these words I give it unto [Applause] you could you give a shout in the house that's a son speaking with the word of power and authority authorized by the father not in church in a home a poor home listen she was so poor she used to pay her tights in coins sit down a minute she was so poor some people didn't want to pay tight but I show you how God came back and reward her one time brma wanted to give her back the money and God tell him don't do that she was blessed pay TI and coins and God come right around to that poor woman and manifest you think God don't see what you're doing you Ain fooling me no oh you could fool me but you can't fool God so at the end of it is it's not about your position you have the work you have your career position it's about who you are [Applause] hallelu and that's what the matter with the church today you read reason we don't have many mighty great manifestations the great Church of the Living God in these last days should be far down the road with every Divine gift set in order a great beautiful church but we are broke up in denomination isms little fosses and everything else till God can no more with us until we come together and get our hearts right with God that's why our blessings are about to run out that's why in the churches is getting cold cooling off is because we have become indifferent towards God his spirit and his word and it is true we never welcome the Holy Spirit no more so when you come to church it's a great responsibility you see I want to get off a church and get into your position of sons Hallelujah when you come to church as a son forget church when you come to church as a son you come to worship you come to welcome the Holy Spirit you you you you I'm talking to it has nothing to do with nobody else you're not waiting in the group for somebody to worship to to whip you up everybody praying but you not praying you mind men you open your prayer L on you man you are to pray for your own self you got to take your own burden before God isn't that right that's when God going to see and come and bless second Timothy 3 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works and the Amplified is every scripture is God breathed given by inspiration profitable for instruction reproof and conviction of sin correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness which is in holy living in Conformity to God's word and with Will and in thought purpose and action so the scriptures itself that we bring is to bring correction is to bring reproof is to rebuke you is to instruct you and to bring guidance to you and if you don't want it that's that's your kind of son but if you want to be the right kind of a son you'll respond to this because all scriptures is God breathe all scriptures is inspired and there's a purpose behind the scriptures the scriptures by the Holy Spirit bring the tutorship upon your life so you're not fighting the pulpit you're not fighting the man of God you're fighting your own blessing your own inheritance by wrestling with what God is is speaking through the word oh Hallelujah so Abraham he help us to come into full obedience God said separate yourself from your brethren and that's what you have to do a lot of times separate yourself from a lot of unbelief and remember here we go are you ready until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing never come until he fully obeyed God think about your blessing being locked up and stored up Hallelujah nobody can take it it's yours it Mark your name on it it's it's there yes but because of your actions because you're not separated you can only get dripping from it God can't open the full thing he can open a little creeks and something fall on you it's yours nobody can take it it's yours it's reserved but for that full window to open up you have to come into full [Music] obedience Hallelujah running out now amen hallelujah you right son now don't watch me say Amen if I preach any words amen watching me nobody say you know watch until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessings never come until he fully obeyed God he took his daddy along and he caused trouble then lot finally caused trouble hurs man God didn't tell him bring the people in he say separate yourself he said Daddy come BL come and they bring along tot along drag along all way people on the to along and it's trouble them same people to trouble he still had to get separated from [Applause] themall 30% say Amen on that you don't want to separate yet well that your choice Hallelujah that's your choice thank you Jesus I want my blessing Hallelujah if I to separate myself from you I go on I want my blessing do you want your blessing you'd have to have a burden for your father's business Hallelujah father's business and as soon as he got separated from everything when he fully obeyed then God brought the blessing then is when we see when full obedience come and when he was about to take the life of his own son the angel of the Lord called from disguise and held his hand there's a ram behind him he took the RAM and said where that Ram come from oh praise the name of the Lord I skip that but the RAM said the only way you're going to pay the price to talk about the token is accept it full obedience to the whole word of God in entitle you to the Token full obedience not part of it as far as denomination goes but all of it full OB to the word which is Christ brings you to Christ oh full obedience complete obedience is not right so when God expect you to do a certain thing he Demands a complete separation from any doubt you have got to come to full obedience to obey what he says God demands it you can't do it no other way now he set an example and this was the example complete separation from all of his own family Kindred and walk a new life so if you are the right kind a son you will stay with the word god going to chastise you God going to bring down the whip he going to bring down the blows but you're going to stay with the word but says God was doing here we call a plac of a son and before he fell a to the kingdom of his father possession the first that son had to be raised and tried he had to find out whether the son was a true son or just a rust about this son would never be air if he wasn't qualified to take the father's place so the God's objective is for the son to take his place so the test and the trial is to qualify you for position all right right listen if you being tested you have been considered worthy Hallelujah for the interview for this job [Applause] if you are not being tested I think you should be worried I think you should be concerned because the test and the try is because you have the potential Hallelujah you you don't waste time on people who don't want to learn nothing you leave them alone they're on their own but because the child is willing to give it a crack to give it a chance but Isaac spoke something he said as the head of the home or the house or you get a position or promotion you to do two things step up or step out the position is always higher than you if you get a promotion it is always higher than you it is always more responsibilities it will be always more pressure and stress but it will be more pay too so you want more pay but not more pressure well you don't even have no pressure at all just go for no pay go for low pay and you get a low job and you have no pressure you have nobody under you you have no responsibilities you don't to open the office close the office you do nothing Hallelujah but this father's business hallelujah it's a huge responsibility it's a tremendous responsibility and he can't give his business over to Rascals Ro about and people that just don't care so he has to have some kind of way to measure and to qualify and to strip by interview and by test the kind of person he want for the business you get the wrong person they ruin your business your business will burst God business is not going to burst come on say Amen somebody she said as my father send me so send that you hallelujah hallelujah I'm not sending you just to do your own thing it's a certain way I'm sending you as my father sent me the same way my father sent me I am sending you at that day you're going to know I'm in the father you in me I in you oh give the Lord some Praises church is out of it oh give the Lord some shouts now I can see you asking God and God answering your prayer Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God okay so he want to know if he's qualified took the to take the Father's Place okay and then all the father heart was given to the son and there is where I think that many of us Pentecostal people has made a mistake Hallelujah we think as soon as we become Sons and Daughters of God that settle it all right we just come into a place of trying amen amen and I don't think people appreciate that too much because I hear complaints I hear mumins yeah people attitudes and whatnot they don't see God they see this one affect me that one affect me this one do me they're not seeing God permit this one God allow that one God permit this to happen and that to happen he's not testing them so don't Point your finger at them she and I and she caused me to act so and I didn't want to do it you know but because he I wasn't going to do it but when he said that that's I hit him no no no no no no no no you wanted to hit him you choose to hit him they have no excuses you have to make a choice because thou has chosen you have to choose the right action because you're no longer pleasing man come on now you're pleasing not the pastor forget about that you're pleasing God then every believer start to match and step with the word match and step with the spirit marching and step with God when you walk in the church there an army walking inside of you when you praying you're not praying leaning on somebody prayer somebody praying desperately you all in true Lord amen Lord that's right Lord thank you Jesus yes sir are you supporting a person prayer when you when you when you L start to pray and afraid to open your M because you don't know how to pray so how you in contact with your father without any communication we to talk to your father well about two months ago yes we have to read your well since last year no no no no that's not Fellowship that is not relationship if it was how Jesus was in I always do that which pleases the father father d a day and I I reveal itself to them and always talking about the we going to get into it message Hallelujah message the Methodist said as soon as they shouted that settled it some had new name Hallelujah some say now the Holy Ghost someone patri before some is it some is the eye and the bride and all kind doct a white horse Cloud all you go around all kind of different doctrines that they pin down dogmatic that is it I don't mind they say what they say you know but they put that come and let more unfold one on the Trump he he blowing a trumpet one on this one on Mysteries some people find we don't pach enough Mysteries we short in the Mysteries same regular thing Holy Ghost Dynamics I didn't know what to preach again because no preach 120 years the same thing when you come for service Sunday morning to Noah Noah say take away Bibles title It Will Rain subject It Will Rain inspiration It Will [Applause] Rain hallu say TI that it's still going to rain tired still going on rain CU this boat are leaving here so how you boat leaving must rain for that to leave how we leaving here how the sick will be healed how the blind will see how the going to walk how the dead going to be raised up it has to [Applause] R somebody could talk to their friends they could talk to their co-workers they could talk to the devil themselves they wouldn't talk to you no Fellowship I'm going to heaven Jesus which Heaven pul third heaven I don't know which one but when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be the Bible said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness then when we do that we can have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us us us us us who born in sin and Sh iniquity us who come in the world speaking life the blood of Jesus cleans is us and we can have Fellowship one with another oh could we get a shout in the house if we say we have fellowship and we have blood and we cannot fellowship with our brother we lie and speak not the truth may be seated Hall so no matter what kind of position God put you in yes sir you are still growing towards Perfection I will never reach that till Jesus comes now notice if God acted any Wan thing on a certain circumstance and that circumstance arise again he's got to act the second time like he did the first time or he's unjust so no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid you may become he has got to act to you like he did that Fallen woman or he acted wrong then Jes now hear the bum God's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person and that's the way you are in your behavior tells you what you are it doesn't tell you about your office somebody could be a prime minister and be adulterer somebody could be a CEO and be a hater somebody could be a manager and be a murderer it's not the office it's the man so God is not interested in in this position and that position he want to know you who you are tell me about yourself when they go to interview they ask that question tell me about yourself you mean you you mean you don't know about you and when you

ACC kze him he's that kind of person man come Peter draw sword and cut off ha Peter defending Christ Peter fighting for the Lord he throwing out sword Jesus had to pick up the man ear and give her

going now he said Peter I ain't come to bring Church to you I come to bring and let you know you are Sons you are sons that is about to be born into manifestation I'm going to release to you the promise of my father you shall receive power all what you run from all what you couldn't overcome you're going to get power after the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you Dynamics going to striking mechanics Joel prophecy going to be fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so now these guys had a higher thought a higher inspiration now these guys they still frighten but it's not a frighten that frighten without promise that promise a power now they just had to wait on it and they were in the upper room waiting and they were in the temple worshiping God continually Hall you see worship praise Express Faith because faith is like a check that you haven't to taken to the bank as yet oh somebody get a check Saturday where you going and cash that the bank is closed you got to wait till Monday so you you should be shouting on Saturday Saturday night you can't sleep Sunday morning you're happy happy happy you're watching the clocking on Sunday night because you know Monday morning that what on that paper there is yours right now it's piece of paper if you give a child with it they roll it they might spit on it they might put it in the mouth that's a check Hallelujah so because you have it it materialized to the content of the revelation of what it is but you can Rejoice that is what faith is that's why when you know you're healed you begin to praise God and rejoice you know God going to a break you you you rejoice in advance amen you thank Him in Advance you start a worship they were in the upper room worshiping a promise worshiping a revelation they didn't know when it was going to come which Sunday which Thursday which day it was going to come what if it come today are you ready what if it come now your promise come right now to you what if it come now I didn't promise it God promis it and God can't lie oh my my my my my my my you may be seated so the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person Hallelujah and behave itself in another it will make each person come into its character oh my so then this has nothing to do with Doctrine no it has nothing to do with doctrine that is why brother bam said I rather somebody right in their spirit and wrong in their Doctrine than somebody right in their Doctrine and wrong in their Spirit Hallelujah that's profound and that's very deep Hallelujah you see when somebody wrong in your spirit you can't correct that right that's right right when somebody WR in the spirit you can correct the wrong Doctrine [Applause] that's the truth so God is more concerned with your spirit than your teaching your spirit than your Doctrine God is more concerned about that when when the Bible say Jesus needs Pastor Samaria because he want to find his one well needs Pastor Samaria he got to reach out amen she's messed up she had four how much men she had and the one wasn't her own she's totally messed up Society recognizes as a messed up woman but she had a right Spirit she was honest she was truthful he has the pr to get into side of her when he get go call your husband he was given a test she what husband you talking about why ask me a question she got to go in defensive mode why ask me that for like know your business Hallelujah I a know you thank you Jesus so she she she she could have get down inside of that but she didn't do that she spoke the truth I have none he say you spoke the truth woman now what Jesus doing he going down now he's going Beyond her condition he he come to show her something he's come to show her where she come from he come to show her she's a daughter of God come and show her forget about them scribe and Pharisees AAS and all them people who say this and your that and your that forget all of that I come to release you show you your name on the book I come to set you free who the son of man set free free indeed now when Jesus finished with that woman she ran she couldn't walk home she couldn't act normal it was just too much for her I once was BL but now I see you can't keep me [Applause] B you are walking of things tiny up and God come in this service and set you free from it things that binding you you're slave to this and a slave to that and God break that that whip off you you wouldn't Rejoice you wouldn't shout you start to shout now don't even wait for it to break off of your sh [Applause] no you may be seated Hallelujah my Lord now this whole thing about ters ship was that the father is so busy in his business he have no time to teach his son so you have tutors to teach his son he used to get the best and the best is the holy spirit that he released to bring training and discipline to his sons and the Holy Spirit was sent to govern and guide the church God give the Holy Spirit to do that the father would seek not seek a man to try to get a Fed in his cap we call it now the father is a renegade and and and and if and if the son is a renegade and the man come say your son doing okay you know he's fine he's fine he's fine the father don't want that he wants the truth about you he wouldn't do that he got a man that will tell him the truth for he wanted to know exactly the welfare of the boy at all times he sent the Holy Ghost upon the church to be the teacher and the Razer of the church that is why a lot of men replace the Holy Ghost so the people don't even look for the Holy Ghost they don't expect the Holy Ghost they expect the man all right have the man dead Church in trouble because it's not the Holy Ghost you see if you take place the Holy Ghost though you trust the man the man is who is everything so therefore you are church member and that is the pastor but that is not what we bringing this morning what we bringing this morning is to shake off this church thing and understand that you a son and you a daughter and you become a temple of the Holy Ghost to reveal the mystery that was hid from generation to generation which is Christ in you he want to Tabernacle himself in [Applause] you hallu look how God look how God used Peter to bring Spirit power to cornelius's house a gentile all the time dealing with Jews God bring Vision to Peter Peter had to go God uh Cornelia send messenger to get Peter that is when things are active in the church they send for you amen so Peter get a call God tell Peter to go never gone away before and he come to Cornelius house by faith and he begin to speak by faith and while words come out his mouth hallelujah holy ghost power fall upon Cornelius what kind of man was Cornelius just devout a worshiper arms Giver a free man he not selfish he's not miserable he's not a terrorist just devout that's the kind of man there an atmosphere a quality man watch God fill him with the Holy Ghost and he ain't get baptized yet it's not the baptism give you is the heart [Applause] condition a right can of a son hallu just Hallelujah devout dedicated amen sincere not halfway not fleshly so much of fleshly people inside of here you're just natural you're not concerned by the spiritual if you miss a service you should go back and listen to the service that you miss there's no excuse for not knowing what's going on in the church it's on the Internet it's on YouTube it's on Facebook no excuse none you could put it on the phone we have an app for Android you could put on that app also on your phone and listen to message on Android on your phone no excuse to find out and listen because you want to know what's going on because when you come to church you get the opportunity for the spirit to speak expressly am this is not playing back a tape of the Prophet from way back then and they just don't know where it at because it's just the prophet's words this is present truth amen this is a prophet word coming alive this is the prophet's prophecy we come to tell you more than God and a prophet we come to bring the prophecy of the Prophet to bring that to life the prophet said me these men bring these seeds to life that is what we are trying to do that is what we are pressing to do he say seven tunders gathered right together we press to bring that seed to life seven TS give Faith he repressed to bring that seed to [Applause] life now if the child was misbehaving itself the boy was not interested in the things of the Father's Farm or Kingdom how the Holy Spirit must feel today when it goes before God with the bow shame face and have to take a report of our indifferences in the churches today how we have laid aside all the baptism of the spirit how the churches are having a form of godliness n the power thereof how he blushed and say your daughters are dressing morally how you must blush and say your children can't even agree with one another long enough to have a meeting how they make fun of people that's called out and filled with the Holy Spirit how the Holy Ghost must feel to go before God with such a message as that coming back and saying they're having a form of godliness they don't believe in the Supernatural no more they won't even go to church on Wednesday night they want to stay and watch their favorite television program question the father will say listen there's a big one for me did you try did did did did you knock at the heart's door the father asking the holy did you knock at the heart door I knock night after night and they won't listen God don't leave you so you know oh no he knocks he press if the one my door he knock on the window he send somebody send some kind of thing give your a word to see if you would change your ways change take heed how he must feel watch he trusted us like he did Adam and Eve to obey his word they fell and as soon as man gets things in his hand he will fall every time he cannot hold it himself it takes God to hold us but we notice what if the boy was a good boy how the teacher would shove out his chest walk up to the father and say I'm so glad sir to bring you the message of how your son is progressing he's just as smart as he can be he's just like you he's a chip of the old block he's just exactly like you he loves the thing you love he does the work exactly like You' done it when you was out there that's a report that's the kind of church that the Holy Ghost likes to witness before God and if that child did not obey oh my I was not an obedient child he was never was no more than a son it remained a son it had no inheritance that's right now we don't want to stay in that place you don't want to stay where you have no inheritance you want this inheritance I want to see a Church of God God in deep sincerity amen don't try to impress me hallelujah amen impress God Amen don't impress your sister or your brother or no no I want you to understand you have to get a relationship with your father Hallelujah if everybody doing a certain things you don't have to do everybody everybody doing you want to do what God wants you to do you're serving your father okay I want to see a Church of God in deep sincerity I want to see oldfashioned prayer meetings amen where the big Amen on that one Hallelujah I want to see the times when they can't leave church they just stay all night and pray and fast and call out until God answers Hallelujah instead of that it seemed like love has brindled away the love of God when this boy if he come up that way and did not become obedient didn't have the I like this one he did not have the action of his father did not try to carry his father's business on the way his father did then that child missed all his inheritance and another brother had to take his place oh that's a big one that's a big one you could miss your inheritance and then somebody pick up just where you left off I heard a statement there's no Miss opportunities you know somebody else stick up the ones you miss miss the opportunity you miss it the person who pick it up they go on and run with it am all right let's go so Jesus was always about the father's business doing that which was right in his sight not just about doing this and that and the church becomes to do that about the father's business I always do that which pleases my father now see and if the Pentecostals so if that child fails God raise up another child another son that's how we're doing right he not time if the Pentecostal fail God raise up the stones under Abraham God call God can call it from the Lutheran from the Baptist from the from the Presbyterian God is able of these stones to rise to Abraham somebody is going to see the vision and take it on God I hope to live to see that church when she rise in the power and the beauty of the Resurrection with the powers of God working through her signs and wonders following the Believers like it did in the New Testament not signs and wonders following the pastor signs and wonders follow say it out say it again the Believers these signs shall follow them that believe and the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the [Applause] word Oh Glory do you see that hallelujah hallelujah so now watch when the church now then if the church did obey how did you come and tell the father oh he's wonderful he's carrying out your work instructions letter by letter that's the kind of church that's the one the father says sure proud of that son you know what happens he's getting strained yet watch here we go this TI into last week message yet he might not be able to exercise all authority he hasn't got it yet he is still a son but he hasn't been placed so he's working like all the other Sons until God is ready at the appointed time and if he's a right kind of son then God could take him aside and place him in a position of full Authority Oh Glory to God know God longing for that oh Hallelujah here we go are you ready if that son proven to be a right kind of a son loved the father's business stayed right with his instructions the father then on a certain day took the son out before public set him up in a high place clothe him in a beautiful garment or what they call an adoption and positionally what he was oh Hallelujah you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of son amen amen hallelujah and God took him up on the mountain and brought Witnesses that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on Earth someday he will call you a side church if you only obey him and stay on the word he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus all the powers that Christ had pour into the church all that and so on he paused in the church God wanted his work done he sent it into his son the son wanted the work done he sent into the church at that day you shall know I love that I love that he pour it into the church the church as a group doesn't hold it it comes in individuals do you get that Hallelujah but is a channel the church become a channel by w the the the the the spirit of God come and flow but it could only hold an individual it could fill the whole place here but only individual going to receive it those Tabernacles going to receive it fill the whole place here but individual will get their lick of fire upon their head you have to get your individual lick of fire Oh Glory to God you don't want to say that's the pillar of fire you want your fire you want your lick yourself do you believe that and the same power that was in Jehovah God Rest in Jesus Christ CHR same power that rest in Jesus Christ rest in place sons in the body of Christ we haven't seen that yet that's why I say have no man could claim to have the ministry of Jesus Christ talk about have a rainbow and a picture and this one have a picture and a picture here I say go not come with no photo shoot to identify by pictures a man adopted you have to have a life and the virtues have to be tested and proven so I don't care how much rainbow how much picture how much light how much flashes and whatnot has nothing to do with that we want to know if God saying this is my beloved Son he ye him my authority is with him there was no question about brother brandham having that Authority and power it was manifested isn't that right it was demonstrated he was in the boat and a raar went out he stand up a fish was dead he said little fishy I give you back your life in the name of Jesus Christ and that dead fish turn over and fly and and and and swim away oh it was demonstrated that power got to be demonstrated this power you're talking about oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you think God God doesn't want to demonstrate his power but he was waiting for people with character for a long time the battle has all me character but we are fighting and pressing to be positionally place oh glory to God hallelujah every knee shall bow every tongue going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Oh Glory to God how much money they have what they have what position they have it is nothing brother if you account me for a fanatic from this night on that very thing that I'm speaking of will be done yes sir not maybe up will be done there will be a power

the nice message he preached the Mysteries unfolded the knowledge revealed he didn't say that when God can see these virtues hallelujah amen hallelujah he's not even talking about the revelation of the virtues because Revelation and manifestation is two different things do I have witnesses in the house I feel empowered I feel a special anointing upon me to bring this message we're going to finish it Revelation and manifestation is not the same thing amen Abraham had a reation of Isaac he take 25 years to phys all right Hallelujah so claiming have a revelation we had to get any test Abraham test was 25 years then he could produce Isaac and say here is what I had our Revelation all these years well when them virtues become real then you could be tested you think God didn't test brother brandham he sent two people in the church to make love in the church but R the pull pit how we could that be you you you let happen church and trainer think can fling them out police boy then F get arrested and fling out the church so fast they can't they can't the T come this this is this is youth but these people come in in church and they carry with their foolishness Holy Spirit drop down he said please B stop that don't do that please please have respect and what they not B with him they carrying with the nonsense Holy Spirit drop down not man holy spirit God Almighty he said if said blind they'll be blind if you say if you said death they'll die if you say whatever you say come to pass and he is there tension pressure there's a son he have choices hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God didn't tell him do this do that no no no no no no no no no no when you come to maturity God put the options on your table God put it on your plate God forcing you do beat you no no no that's how we just want to handle things things but God not doing that Hallelujah he gave him all the options and he take none of the above he said I forgive you Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit pour out because God was [Applause] pleased come on now come on now come on now we want to get down to the close God was pleased hallu next next one but went in a restaurant see a woman they carrying on she middleaged with some men and carrying on and whatnot he said God why you condemn this place is this the place my daughter going raise up in God give my tap on the shoulder pull him aside Vision break he see himself as a child he see all the sins and whatnot and all going up to God he see Jesus blood like a bumper Bing it off he see pardon wri in a book he see the book put in the see of forgetfulness he say I forgive you and you condemn her what what is God teaching him forgiveness brotherly kindness Mercy yes you're a prophet yes you Minister yes you're a preacher yes you have Revelation and so on but you don't know why that woman is how she is you never put your foot in her shoes to know her pain and to know her suffering and to know why she is how she you never did that so I'm teaching you you got to put your foot where somebody else is before you could criticize them and say this about them and say that about them stop it cut it out because you just don't [Applause] know then B had to go to the woman and say woman I was there condemning you and the Holy Spirit came and do this and that that right there in the bar that woman KN down on her knees look at that what if you did another testimony you see the woman you see she with she short dress or short pants right there she was restored she was a backing Christian she was restored right there under the floor what a mighty God we serve God is real when he told those couple caring on the church I forgive you he said he recognized he was a sinner too he did things wrong too amen hallelujah why call judgment when you could call Mercy oh yeah why wipe somebody out when they could restore them when they can restore them and bring them back when they could revive them why do that to show how much power you have behind the pulpit to show Power you have as an elder or Deon or whatever why do that that why Jesus told them that these Gentiles have power over this one and power the one he said I come and when he come to wash the feet and what not don't wash my feet because they know who to do that job that was the lowest job the feet washers to come into your home wash your feet first before you come inside the drawing room Jesus bring a Bas of water and say come and wash your feet not to Peter Peter again P was was Guy La not my my feet you when you part with me he say wash was was everything B me with the water Hallelujah Peter don't want to get at all but my point is this Jesus show them serving what a servant is what the ministry supped supp to be okay he that great among you let him serve put on the robe put on the plate come and serve serve now there's Kings butam says is up to me to work on my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God then sealed into the kingdom of God there is the holy spirit then you works of God but when these things are operating in You by God then you are sealed amen you see by Revelation you could operate it you could operate certain things somebody come in and you could be just be fing with your wife and door knock talk talk open door and God bless you God bless you but just just calling your wife it wasn't so much blessing inside but because of who come to the door you give a different face so you work anything real nice but then when it begin to operate in You by God it's not you no more it thunders it lives itself right out because it's that you is him in you oh praise the name of the Lord here is BM until these things from ordination 1962 as scripturally proven and sealing to you as an individual then you are son and daughter of God it's the thing the fruit of the spirit that proves that you're in God oh hear this one almost done he said now watch Pentecost was born like a son but that same son was born in the family had to be adopted also that's right and there is where you miss your calling friend when the adoption time comes aha you mean there's a time for adoption yes when that time comes if the teure that raised that child found the child not worthy they remain a son but miss the adoption oh Hallelujah so Jesus was God example seed musicians come up please Hallelujah he was that example seed The Works will be manifested in him the same way that seed would of God he was example seed and when the Holy Ghost came upon him it was manif ested Hallelujah I just want to share with you a few thoughts scriptures to show you how much Jesus was connected to the father both in communion and in fellowship and in relating to the father this is from St John 5 so I wouldn't call all the scriptures I just want to read on Jesus answered and them said my father work hither to and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only broken the Sabbath but said that God was his father making him equal with God I love that my father work and I work also by claiming God was his father they say he Mak himself equal with God and then answered Jesus said unto them verily I said unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he see the father do for whatsoever things ever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise here we go for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him great Works than these that you may Marvel for as the father raised up the dead and quickened them so the son quickeneth whom he willall so he was constantly plugging in to how the father operate I am operating Hallelujah isn't that right for the father judgeth no man but had committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honth not the son honor not the Father which has sent him for as the father had life in himself so had he given it to his son to have life in himself then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses give you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven and for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven which giveth life unto the world all the father given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will nowise cast out he sent me he that sent me is with me and the father had not left me alone for I do those things which please him at that day you shall know I'm in the father ye and me and I in you he that ha my commandment and keepeth them he that loveth me and and he that love me shall be loved of my father and I will love him I will manifest myself to him and Judah said unto him not as Sky Lord how is it that thou would manifest th unto us and not unto the world and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our board with him he said loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you that being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance oh my do you love him this morning this even God take pleasure or Delight in his son Matthew 3 identify that this is my son I am delighted in him I am pleased with him Matthew 17 this is my son I'm pleased hear him isn't that right isn't that right God was pleased to have the fullness dwell in him Colossians 1:9 it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell isn't that right Isaiah 53:10 God was pleased to bruise him yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief and when thou has made thy Soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed he shall prolong his days and the pledge of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and the final one 1 Corinthians 1:21 God is pleased in the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe are you going to be that bright kind of son Hallelujah not everything easy not everything smooth he learned obedience by what he suffered he was bruised God was pleased to bruise him because through his being

master peace thank you Jesus how many appreciate the pastor this morning oh what can we say that message is worth listening to again no question about it amen amen glory so I just want to read uh we do have two prayer requests we want to approach the throne of grace before we close out in prayer and announcements and uh we have a prayer request uh from Sister Trisha asking to the Saints prayers for my grandmother who was wed at the hospital um the doctors have removed four of her toes and pray for God's grace to strengthen her at this time and uh from Sister Lydia Gil requesting prayer for severe pain in both legs and constant fever the cause cannot be determined by the doctors asking God for results of the test to be returned negative and for a complete healing and if there's any unspoken or Unwritten requests that you want to show by raise of hands as we approach the throne of grace this morning can we bow our heads in reverence and respect to the presence of deity in our midst because God says where there are two or three gathered in his name there he is in the midst of them and the word has already gone forth and the atmosphere is right for healing to take place healing not just physical healing but healing of your Soul healing of your mind is there not a bom in Gilead is there not a physician there he's here to heal broken hearts he's here to not just heal cancer and high blood pressure and tumor but if you're backslid he could heal you he could heal your trouble and you can't sleep at night he could heal you he could he could heal your family he could heal your marriage he could heal whatever you going through whatever the pain is he is he is a Healer He Is A Healer this morning can we bow our heads in a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord the word today was so rich so pure so real it was so tangible to us father we can't help ourselves but acknowledge that the season has changed and Lord God we know you are the god of Elijah you are the god of William Mariam brandom you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord the Pastor said Lord when you read the quote that if the same conditions exist Lord you will have to do the same thing and Lord there's a change that has taken place father Lord because your word taught as if my people would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways they will hear from Heaven how we thank you for the prayer meeting last night and how we thank you for the service today and Lord we feel the effects of that restoration of communication and that relationship with you and Lord your children have brought request to the throne of grace this morning Lord for sister Lydia Lord God may you touch her right now wherever she is from the crown of her head to the SS of her feet the doctors don't know what it is but you know what it is Father the doctors will never figure out what it is but you know what it is and father you said whatever we bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever we loose on Earth is loosed in heaven don't me you loose her right now we bind the works of darkness we send that sickness that fever that pain we send it back to the pit of Hell Lord God may you touch your daughter may she go free right now and Lord God for sister Trisha and the situation with her grandmother Lord may you touch her may you heal her Lord may she come to Know You by Revelation and by experience and for every hand that was raised almighty God may you heal your people may you pour out the Holy Ghost may you restore marriages may you heal the marriages in the church may you restore families may you heal the families in the church Lord may you heal the sick in the church may you heal the relationships between fathers and their children between mothers and their children between children and their Heavenly Father May today be a day when we see the right kind of sons coming into position Hallelujah father we commit your people into your hands we pray a special blessing on the pastor Lord for the burden Lord he has for weeks he has been talking about this service and to see the Holy Ghost drop down and set your people free it's not about church it's not about being in the message but we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God and we could be the right kind of sons to have access to every Redemptive right that is given to us it belongs to us those things which are revealed they belong to us and to our chch children forever forever father may you bless your people Lord may you grant traveling mercies may you bring us back at the appointed time May Lord this never stop may we just keep growing in strength to strength may your people commit in their hearts to pray more to cry out more to study more and one of these days there'll be a service where the musicians cannot play and the song leader cannot sing and the minister cannot Minister because the Holy Ghost itself will drop down and take over father may you bless your people bless the remaining portion of the service Lord and what is to transpire next father we commit everything into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated for a few minutes for some announcements the Holy Ghost is here thank you Lord service continues on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. come under great expectation this coming Sunday would be two services at 10:00 a.m. and our 3:00 p.m. Lord supper it's the 1st for 2017 and it's a sacred commandment of God do this in remembrance of me hallelujah it's not an option it's you signifying to God that you are remembering what he came to do you're kidding yourself as a Christian if you think it's just coming and attending a church service there are a number of things that God placed in Scripture that we must do to be identified and that Holy Communion that Lord's Supper is one of them so I challenge you for this week because you cannot take communion if you're living any kind of life so you are being challenged this week to reassess and look into the mirror of the word consecrate yourself sanctify yourself come to that service on Thursday night and on Sunday we will have two Services make it your business to have your life in order so when you come to that communion line you are standing knowing god I want to serve you I've never served you before as brother over it said it's not a question of if you are a son that's not the issue it's what kind of son what kind of daughter what kind of life so every day ignore the distractions ignore what's happening around you and focus on your destination because we are like an arrow just passing through time we are heading out of here this world is temporary this the pain is temporary the bills are temporary It's All Temporary so make that effort maintenance group two please meet with uh brother Joel Striker after the service is is he here is there somebody else uh maintenance group two please meet with brother Isaiah otley after the service and there will also be a short choir practice after the service so I'm just going to ask but Anthony to just come and sing one song as we switch over amen you love him today praise God hallelujah where he leads me are
