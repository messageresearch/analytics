it's number two that are struggling with Spirits in mind and the mind battles region but that's the ground that was chosen for for the battle to reach father came them great courage united we present your word that they will find your word true you'll find your word strong they find your word want to go to the restaurant and put their feet on granted Lord and Jesus might ask it amen amen God bless you thanks for being here tonight it's always a blessing and privilege Amen to where we could guide it together if your Bibles I want to run through some scriptures tonight and there's a photograph of my heart is building an altar building an Old Town and we want to look at Genesis chapter 12. I want to read from verse 5 to 8. Genesis 12. five to eight and Abraham took Sarah his wife and not his brother's son and all this substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forward to going to the land of kingdom and into the land of Cain and the King and Abram passed through the land onto the piece of chicken onto the plane of Mori and the Canaanite was in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy scene will I give this land and dear build it he and alter unto the Lord who appeared unto him so an altar is something that is built it's not just a a happening our altar is actually built and he removed from dense unto a mountain of the east of Bethel pitch his tent having better on the west high on the East and dear he builds up altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord when Anthony's message on Wednesday night Genesis 22 when I go to levels 7 of Genesis 22 if you want to follow with me uh any Bibles like just listen and Isaac speak unto ibraham's father and said my father we know the story he said yeah am I my son he said behold the fire and the word but where is the Lamb for a burned offered and Abram said my son God will provide himself a lamb for good offering so they went put them together and I came to the police which you've got to pull him off and Abraham built an old idea and laid the wooden order and born Isaac's son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand took the night to sleep son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of Heaven said Abraham Abraham he said Lena thine hand upon the lad do you do out anything unto him [Music] when Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him around quoting a ticket by his voice and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for burned offering and instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen okay so we want to go to Genesis 26 but we didn't go just yet note and alter is not just a place of often prayer or it is a police are offering sacrifice and the sacrifice is what breaks that prayer effective because the animal takes the place of the guilty one making that petition to God and it's almost as if this is a natural obviously ritual that connects Heaven to Earth that connects this invisible God and you're back to wonder why is it that God connects with an altar or why God connects with a burnt offering why God connects with sacrifice and why our lives have to become sacrificial our lives have to come to our own water where we could see that representation of ourselves they are the altar of the animal being burned you know we sometimes we talk about the flesh being singed we talk about a huge note we talk about cherubims and seraphims like Isaiah experience where he could say who is me and come to that spot it means that you have no more excuses you're not blaming brother sister Pastor Elder Deacon neighbor Boss family there's nobody to blame it's it's coming to a better sincerity where you recognize how little you are how filthy you are how unclean you are how undone you are in his presence and this is the great battle there are so many people natural and I don't want you to think about individuals I want you to think about that natural part of you that hinders you you know where I'm talking about the greatest enemy is himself we all have that natural part that part where we want to do our own thing and yet we know each other goals you will and God's mind and we don't want to pause long enough because we are afraid that God will not give us what we desire we have our own results we have our own thoughts or ambition gonna allow our own computer in fact they can use that term to run however we wanted to run and make our own decisions and based upon our own decisions we see fruitable and sometimes I hear but I was actually often we don't sometimes think things through to see secondary circumstance secondary situation secondary results of what we do and that's why there's a scripture the father eats our grapes and the children's teeth are on edge it just goes to show the effect of what the errors of the fathers or the sins of the fathers the effect that have upon the chamber so let's continue we want to look at Genesis 26 this is Abraham San Isaac now verse 12 of 26. then Isaac sword in the land receiving the same year a hundred food and the Lord blessed him and the man works great went forward and grew until it become very great that's Rock Street went forward grew until it became very great as Isaac and he had possession of flocks possessions of hoods great store of servants and the Philistines Nvidia and all the worlds which is father's servants are digged in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped them and fill them with this Isaac go from us much mightier than we an exactly party then speeches tent in the valley of jira and Dread there and Isaac dig again the wells of water which they are Diggs in the days of Abraham's son for the Philistines that stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their memes after the memes which his father called him so again you see Isaac Abraham's son trying to get a continuity after the death of Abraham Philistines blah blah but he'd go back digging and Neiman verse 19 and Isaac silvans digged in the valley and found there a well of spring and water and the urban of jira stitched private Isaac with men saying the water is ours and he called the name of the world essec because it's true with him and it's true for that also and he called the name of it sitna are they removed from then so is that keeps shifting did they go well here they carry on they want to argue and fuss you move another place and remove from dance dig another well is it still well no for they that's true and this and and for thee that's true of not and he called the name of it Rehoboth and he said for no the Lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land this is very interesting two Wells fight and battle third well good Lord behave believe that word of everybody in that room for all of us and he went up from dance to Beersheba and the Lord appeared unto him that the same night and said I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless him and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sick what did Isaac do he was 25 tell us and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there and the Isaac savants did the well now we're getting somewhere I want you to go with me right with me Leviticus chapter 9 is where you get this whole picture of this Altar and his sacrifice because it hasn't been built a certain way you have to have a place where you would and the animals and everything else listen to Leviticus chapter 9 verse 1 came to pass on the Eighth Day by doing everything Central and the eighth day that Moses called Iran and his sons the Elders of Israel and the Elders of Israel is it this is Moses called he said at the Iran take the young calf fast enough offer them before the Lord and under the tune of Israel thou shots speak soon taking a kid of the goats for a sin offering a calf and a lamb both of the first year without blemish for abundant now watch the details because we know Christ the perfect lamb was coming this man with his own blood orphan sacrifice once forever we know that but I'm showing you that it was required of them to present and offering for sin a sin offering was called to sacrifice before the Lord and I meet offering mingled with oil and this is Moses prophesying to Iran for today the Lord will appear among you and they brought that much Moses commanded before the Department of Public congregation and the congregational Junior and stood before the Lord and Moses said this here we go is the thing which the Lord commanded that you should do and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you is almost as if God is waiting for certain things to be done and then you get a reaction from him let me read out this again and Moses said this is the thing which the Lord commanded that you should do you and the glory of the Lord shall I pray unto you Moses said unto Aaron go under the altar offer thy sin offering thy burnt offering make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as they recommended and iron therefore went under the altar stood a calf as an offering which is for himself and the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him he dipped his finger in the blood and put it up on the horns of the hotel I'm going to skip down to verse 15. and he brought to the people's offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people Sue it offer it for sin as the first he brought the burnt offer and offered it according to the manner he bought a meat offering verse 18. he slew also the Bullock the run for sacrifice watch verse 22 and even lifting up his hands towards the people and bless them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and the Peace of me and Moses and Aaron went into the timer of the corner again and came out and blessed the people and looked at Prophecy Before so right here now the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people Moses prophesied that if they do this thing that the Lord wants his glory shall appear among them it was done and he had a glory of the Lord appearing at all the people and this part is interested in verse 24. and there came a fire out from the Lord and consume upon the altar the burnt offering and the fact which when the people saw they shouted and fell on their face now I believe this is the first place where it has been identified fire came coming to the altar so the first altar wasn't lit by man didn't like God's order who God himself lit that old God himself lit that fire and you remember that when Elijah challenged the people if God we got Susan and let the golden answer by fire let him be God and this is how Elijah did the first thing he did He restored the altar he brought the altar lady wood and then say pour water pour more water and pour more water the people carry on looking for manifestations and they carry on carrying nothing happening and the first thing he did was to bring this reconciliation to God by presenting an altar a altar where the sacrifices mean and where prayer is made note Aaron was told to offer a sin offering for himself and for the people is not as if the priest is above this or the Apostle ministers above that the thing about it is that we all need the blood of Jesus we all have fallen short and come short of his glory and the only way back is through the blood not our works so much but truly accepting the blood amen the blood I was shed at Calvary I made myself flat but this is not the nominational we want to go to continue just two verses of chapter 10 of Leviticus this is important another and abihu the sons of Iran this is Iran's own Sons no I guess they must be taking for granted you know some people always say it um entitled do you think this is for granted this is Aaron's sons they took eight of them his sensor and put fire therein and put incense thereon and authored Strange Fire before the Lord which he commanded them not so here it is these priests Sons decide to bring their sensor polite they won't fire add their own incense of their own ideas and smoke up a kind of ceremonial thing off up and God call that Strange Fire yeah what happened verse two and they went out fire from the Lord and devour them and they died before the Lord that is as a result of offering Strange Fire brother Brian or message conferences when we get to a place till we think we are the only one that God can use we better call a conference God sent Jesus his son to die for every member of the body of Christ Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran catholic whatever they may be they are all gods children of promise how are they going to get a message if we cool off that what are we going to do then we are putting a bad example before them there's no time for cooling off so all of you all here tonight who want to chill who taking it easy only cool listen to this word no time for cooling off it is time for warming up we can't have a woman until we have a conference an old-time Revival that brings back the Revival fires that will attract attention when Sinners are born into the kingdom of God when a man begin to see ill-filled women and ill-themed men and children repenting and changing their life going forward making restitution weeping bringing precious sheep the church needs a good case of old-time Godly love bloody love we need a contracts hula conference then he speak on the sense what we need is a conference a universal parameter for the Church of the Living God to be called together don't think I'm hungry or beside myself I know what I speak of the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get-together a call together ministers break down their middle wall of partition Jewish members that will forget the differences between the international churches church members and ministers who alter the bones of the altar yeah he's describing with one Accord and pre until the fire of God begins to fall again this is not Minister explain no mystery or unfold Revelation Third pull open up the word this is not that this is holding on to the horns of the altar with one Accord and pray until the fire of God begins to fall again and watch God knows the stubbornness the indifference of men is broke up and godly fear and broadly love takes its place in the human heart then you become salty then the message will have the preeminances in the heart it will have the inference in the city oh praise God so we find out Gardner Eden Adam and Eve the fall two sons ible and then God bring them to the place where he could say come and worship me bring a sacrifice this is in Genesis this isn't Genesis where these two brothers they were challenged to come and bring an offering unto God and we knew the story we know the story Abel offer under God are more excellent sacrifice he took a ram a lamb and cut it through bloody bleeding and God rejoiced God backed up God released the anointing the fire upon either King brought his own interpretation of fruits and trees and whatever God rejected it and even God said do like a brother I bless you he was so proud in Ireland he wasn't going that route listen to what the prophet said now watch he drove old man and placed at the East of Eden cherubims and a fleeing sword tune every week see the four beats there's only four ways you can go east north west south these cherubims are the Flaming sword at the Gate of the garden cause if a man got a hold of the tree of life then he could live forever then these children Swiss mentioned was placed at the East Gate of the garden going four ways cherubims was pleased to God what the Tree of Life that's what they was to God the tree of life but what what's here now you notice that these cherubimes that John saw must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so you got the Germans in Genesis you get a chair rooms in Revelation isn't that right so they must have been interested in human beings watch no I want to show you now and make this show it's an altar look how the prophet bringing us now this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I'll tell you why do you remember about King and ibra come up here to worship so that goes that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you are again see Back to Eden to the altar and they were to keep that wheat and got it and they couldn't get back there until the order was covered with blood so this Blood Covenant that's why Christ died and shared his blood because life is in his blood this Blood Covenant that was repeated in Shadows and types in the Old Testament over and over bulls and goats and lands and Rams and everything else it meant that was what God was looking through a covering a blood because his righteousness and his Justice demands judgment so therefore they had to have a sin or friend they had to have a peaceful friend that I'm offering for this offering for that to appease this God is not something I'm almost done all right strange scripture we're about to read of Genesis 14 reading from verse 12. there's a lot you know a lot of pictures tend to watch Sodom and up in Southern and then Lord got in captive in captivity they took Lord captive and they took a lot this was 12 or 14 Abraham's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his Goods only packed and there he wanted escaped and told Abraham the Hebrew or he dwelt in the plains of memory the Amorite Brothers Abner and these were Confederate with Abram I went Abram heard yeah it is that his brother his box isn't brother his brother in Sodom his brother who went here but we're going on on the back side there's a believer when Abraham heard that his brother Not museum Church not only seem inspiration his brother was taken captive he armed his trained civils born in his own house 318 and pursued them under that he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smoked them pursue them to hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his Ghost and the woman and the people and the king of Sarah went out to meet him after with his return from the slope of and the kings that were with him at the valley of Chavez which is the king's name there we go this is glorious as we close edek King of Silence brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God if he's there Hallelujah tonight and he blessed him blessed he blessed Abraham and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and blessed be the most high God which had delivered them enemies into thy name and he give him that's Abram know tights of all I want to emphasize that part you give him tights of all now I'm not talking about just tights as money but all that tent of whatever that will belong to you it's not money I want to bring to you I want to bring tonight I want to bring time I want to bring the time that God has given us 24 hours in one day and a tent of that time is two hours and 40 minutes two hours and 40 minutes you know on these phones no it has have the end of the week how much time you spend on your phone or how much time you spend on the computer I don't know if everybody have that feature maybe you should look again and see how much time you are standing on social media and these other destructive things and I want to challenge you tonight to see if you could get to that spot to give God a tent of your time on a daily basis two hours and ordinance you could be driving and praying you could be driving if your work is one hour away and you're worshiping and praying and talking alone or maybe you're listening to scriptures that's one hour gone and driving alone you could be listening in your video airports or whatever whatever two hours and 40 minutes what is the time on a daily basis that we are given to God and this is it here now what we need is a coming together on a Prayer meeting until God sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit brings the Holy Ghost down and places in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelist passes that's what we need that's what the church needs we're going to get them in prayer Samson prayed right Samson prayer Lord let me die with the Enemy when you realize what's happening around you his eyes were gone his strength was born this Fellowship was born but there was a possibility here we go that a friend meeting might spark it again then he prayed right let me die with the Enemy you must die with your enemy you must die to the enemy that's got you in that condition was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back on him again he's seen what he already is up to do not to be a human but to be a servant to have himself stood out the power of God that flow to him get his ball heads so in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your word and I pray that this fruit of building an order which tried the hearts of the people now you visit them may you appear to them and in their homes May that alt of sacrifice be built on medium they Define themselves upon their own self where your fire can come and consume all the world the things of the world and the kids are designed bless them tonight in a special way that last quote we read Lord where when Abraham said that something so a possibility that are permitted Miss Pack it off oh God it'll be so great so wonderful so beautiful if tonight the

wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name uh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah before you leave I want to share one scripture with you and that is from Matthew Mark chapter six verse 20 verse 31 it says Jesus speaking and he said unto them call me yourselves apart onto a desert please and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much has to eat you know I want to share with you as about to leave there's a balance in this life we are in this world but not of this world Jesus saw the Ninja to tell the disciples come aside and take a rest you need a restory charge you need a rest I'm not just talking about rest lying down or just like that talking about you taking care of you you giving yourself some level of self-care and not overextending yourself to the point where you are burnt out because when you are burnt out you can't pray effectively you can praise correctly so don't go on an extreme or in fanaticism like a praying and then she can be Lord and I kind of a weed but get the balance that Jesus demonstrated here by telling disciples come and the Bible says they went aside let me just see yourself they went inside to a place let me just read the last it's right after that and they departed into a desert place by ship privately the Amplified says and they went away in a boat to a solitary place by themselves sometimes you need us peace by yourself you need to tell people no you need to say I can't do that and I have I am I have to take care of me you need to do that sometimes I sometimes may look like if you're selfish it is not it is you taking care of you you go if you get over if you're over area over burnt your your burnt out you cannot be effective to others you have to get that energy you have to get back that strength that's peace a way your body get revenge because all the universe and this world is going by laws and principles I saw two is our buddies so Jesus couldn't support them just continuing they're not eating and they're not doing this and I'm just busy about he had us to bring this balance to them come aside and take a breath so may God bless you and may God bless this I'm coming Services if you haven't this coming Sunday and testify to somebody and invite somebody else may the Lord bless you thanks again for being here tonight we'll be with you
