[47:40] he answered and spake unto me saying
[47:42] this is the word of the Lord unto
[47:44] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[47:48] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[47:51] of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain

[47:57] plain and he shall bring forth a
[47:59] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[48:01] Grace Grace unto it Hallelujah and
[48:05] reading Isaiah 59 and verse 19 so shall
[48:08] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[48:11] West and his glory from the rising of
[48:13] the sun when the enemy shall come in
[48:16] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[48:18] shall lift up a standard against him may
[48:21] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[48:23] of his word can we give the Lord a hand
[48:26] of praise
[48:27] you may be
[48:29] seated so I have a title this morning
[48:33] and my
[48:35] title is not by might nor by power but
[48:41] by my spirit sayth the Lord amen can the
[48:44] church say amen amen and I have a
[48:48] subject Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[48:51] today and forever and an inspiration the
[48:54] spirit raising a standard to meet the
[48:57] challenge of the hour amen and the
[49:01] message just for a background Revelation
[49:04] 4 Revelation chapter 43 brother Bram
[49:07] said all right here was voices Oh how we
[49:09] need in Jeffersonville thousands of live
[49:12] voices the Thunder of God thundering out
[49:15] in sweetness and Holiness Purity undei
[49:18] lives walking around the Earth today
[49:20] without a blemish yes sir real
[49:23] Christians that's the Thunder against
[49:25] the enemy the devil don't care how much
[49:27] you holler the devil don't care how much
[49:30] you can jump how much you can do this or
[49:33] shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see
[49:36] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[49:40] God say anything to him call him
[49:43] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[49:47] move right on oh my that throws him away
[49:51] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[49:54] now I want to say something this morning
[49:56] church it's not what the devil does it's
[49:59] our response to what the devil does it's
[50:02] not what takes place in our lives that
[50:04] God is looking at he's looking at our
[50:07] response so that Sanctified holy life
[50:10] say anything to him call him anything
[50:13] just as sweet as can be God is not
[50:17] looking at how much you shout and jump
[50:19] but is that Sanctified holy life and I
[50:22] want to say this morning the devil has a
[50:24] response to the scriptures that that's
[50:26] why when Jesus was in the wilderness the
[50:29] devil was probing and probing the devil
[50:31] has a response to the quotes because the
[50:34] devil he could read but that is not what
[50:36] the issue is the devil has a response to
[50:39] all of that but he has no response to
[50:41] the life because the moment you vibrate
[50:44] that life the devil has to back up he
[50:47] has to let you go when you present The
[50:50] Life of Christ the devil has no answer
[50:53] to the life of Christ you don't have to
[50:56] say word but the life speaks something
[51:00] and the fact that you are here this
[51:02] morning is speaking something you are
[51:05] supposed to be backslid but you are here
[51:07] this morning and that's a problem for
[51:10] the Devil the fact that you are in the
[51:12] house of God this morning because coming
[51:15] to the house of God opens a road to the
[51:18] blessings of God uh it's up to you to
[51:21] walk on that road but when you are in
[51:23] his presence uh and you are Under The
[51:25] Canopy of life
[51:27] something could happen to you your word
[51:30] could come to you because we have heard
[51:32] the message before we have heard the
[51:34] word before it's not a new message but
[51:38] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[51:41] spirit would raise a standard but the
[51:44] brandham said my making the same word
[51:47] more
[51:48] positive so the raising of the standard
[51:51] is not a new inspiration uh it's not a
[51:54] new doctrine it's not a new idea it's
[51:57] not a new move uh but it's the same word
[52:00] more positive you heard it before but
[52:03] all of a sudden this morning it's a
[52:05] reality to you you've heard it before
[52:08] but this morning it's alive to you
[52:11] you've heard it before but this morning
[52:13] you feel a little different about it you
[52:16] have heard it before but this morning
[52:18] you're a little more fed up of what the
[52:20] devil has been doing so the word is more
[52:23] positive to you this morning you just
[52:25] woke up on the right side of the bed so
[52:29] the word is more positive for you this
[52:31] morning you woke up knowing that no
[52:33] weapon formed against you nothing the
[52:36] devil could say to you nothing your
[52:38] husband your wife your brother your
[52:41] sister your neighbor your friend could
[52:44] move you and the same word is more
[52:47] positive to you and because the word is
[52:50] more positive to you you are more
[52:52] positive you are a positive Christian
[52:55] this morning we have too many negative
[52:57] Christians we have too many sad
[52:59] Christians we have too many depressed
[53:01] Christians depressed and Christians
[53:04] those words should not come together
[53:06] frustrated Christians those words should
[53:08] never come together tired Christians
[53:11] those words should never come together
[53:14] but now are we the sons of God now are
[53:16] we the sons of
[53:18] God oh
[53:21] hallelujah oh my I want to encourage
[53:24] your faith this morning encourage your
[53:27] walk this morning it takes an effort to
[53:31] get up it takes an effort to fight it
[53:33] takes an effort to make it and brother
[53:36] Bram said in the message the world is
[53:39] falling apart he said friends we are not
[53:42] promised a system we are not in church
[53:45] for a system Jesus would have nothing to
[53:48] do with a system we wasn't promise a
[53:51] system we will promise a kingdom and how
[53:54] do you get into it by by one Spirit we
[53:58] are all baptized into this Kingdom it's
[54:01] the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal
[54:04] life with an eternal King giving forth
[54:07] his Eternal Word with an eternal people
[54:11] predestinated to eternal life uh so I'm
[54:14] not speaking to your flesh this morning
[54:17] I'm not speaking to your mistakes I'm
[54:19] not speaking to your failures I'm not
[54:22] speaking to the sickness in your body
[54:24] I'm speaking to the word seed in your
[54:27] soul because of that seed in your soul
[54:30] your body will have to subject itself to
[54:33] your confession because of the seed in
[54:36] your
[54:38] soul oh can I get a witness in the house
[54:41] this morning did we come to have church
[54:44] today are we here headstone Tabernacle
[54:47] are we in the house of God my
[54:52] glory my my my let me say that again
[54:56] it's the kingdom of God it's a kingdom
[54:59] of eternal life there's no death in that
[55:02] Kingdom there's no sickness in that
[55:04] Kingdom there's no depression in that
[55:06] Kingdom there's no sadness in that
[55:08] Kingdom there's no frustration in that
[55:11] Kingdom there's no Mortgage in that
[55:13] Kingdom there are no bills in that
[55:15] Kingdom there's nothing negative in that
[55:17] Kingdom and that Kingdom has an eternal
[55:20] King the pastor is not the king there's
[55:23] no president there's no prime minister
[55:25] there's no Emperor there's just the King
[55:27] of Kings and the Lord of lords who is
[55:31] mighty in battle who is Sovereign and if
[55:34] he elected you because of his
[55:36] sovereignity he needs no permission to
[55:38] bless you and if he elected you because
[55:41] of his sovereignity he needs no
[55:43] permission to fill you with the Holy
[55:45] Ghost and if he called you because of
[55:48] his election Grace he needs no
[55:50] permission to heal you he doesn't need
[55:53] permission to come into your house he
[55:56] does to need permission to clean up your
[55:58] life he is Jesus Christ the same
[56:01] yesterday today and
[56:05] forever Hallelujah you may be seated so

[58:27] word to spend time in the presence so

[58:38] glad when they said unto me let us go
[58:41] into the house of the Lord we have come
[58:44] into his house gathered in his name to
[58:46] worship Him the bill will take care of
[58:49] itself all that you're worrying about
[58:51] Hallelujah when the disciples had no
[58:53] money he said Go Fish they got food when
[58:56] they cut the food there was money in
[58:58] there he took care of their physical he
[59:00] took care of their financial what are
[59:02] you worried about he is still Jehovah
[59:05] Gyra he is still Jehovah shama that has
[59:08] not changed he said I am God and I
[59:11] change not he is still the same
[59:13] yesterday he is still a God of War he is

[59:19] god of blessing he is still a god of
[59:21] Mercy to those that repent and come back
[59:24] to him let us return to the Lord this
[59:27] morning not by might not by power but by
[59:31] my spirit say the
[59:35] Lord oh my you may be
[59:39] seated from the same message the world
[59:41] is falling apart we are dead our lives
[59:44] are HID in God through Christ so through
[59:47] Christ Our Lives are HID in God so there
[59:49] are certain aspects of our life that are
[59:51] secret that are HID to God that's why
[59:54] you are Myster to the the devil that's
[59:57] why when he encountered Jesus he had to
[59:59] ask the question if thou be because his
[1:00:01] life was
[1:00:03] hid there's a covering over you there's
[1:00:06] a mask over you there's a covenant over
[1:00:09] you and when the devil looks he's not
[1:00:11] too sure he's probing he's probing he's
[1:00:13] probing Hallelujah and it seems
[1:00:16] deceptive to him because you fall and
[1:00:18] you fail and you make mistakes and for
[1:00:21] the Devil the mathematics are not adding
[1:00:23] up how almighty God would pick you you
[1:00:26] know you better than I know you the fact
[1:00:28] that almighty God would predestinate you
[1:00:32] and put you under under the blood the
[1:00:35] devil cannot figure it out because the
[1:00:37] devil has a file he has everything that
[1:00:40] you did but when God sees the file and
[1:00:43] looks through the blood he says there's
[1:00:45] nothing on the first page there's
[1:00:47] nothing on the second page what are you
[1:00:49] talking about the devil is the accuser
[1:00:52] of the Bron he has a file on your wife a
[1:00:55] file on your children but when God pulls
[1:00:57] the file and he looks through the blood
[1:01:00] he said there's nothing against my bride
[1:01:03] what what you talking about that's my
[1:01:05] lady I chose that lady I've engaged that
[1:01:09] lady I'm going to be married to that
[1:01:11] lady don't you talk about my lady you
[1:01:14] are
[1:01:15] predestinated for the marriage supper of
[1:01:17] the lamb for the wedding
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:21] supper
[1:01:23] Hallelujah somebody give God a shout up
[1:01:26] Praise You may be
[1:01:28] seated man you are going to the wedding
[1:01:31] supper not as a guest in the wedding
[1:01:34] supper but there are two seats and the
[1:01:36] wedding supper for the king and for the
[1:01:38] lady for the groom and for the bride you
[1:01:41] have reserved seating don't worry about
[1:01:44] your seat because you are the Bride of
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ angels have to step aside
[1:01:50] prophets uh have to step aside Apostles
[1:01:53] have to step aside behold
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:01:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ that's who we
[1:02:00] are Abraham wish he could have been a
[1:02:03] part of this but this is bright time
[1:02:06] this is seed
[1:02:11] time you may be
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:21] seated hallu we are dead our lives are
[1:02:25] hidden God through Christ and not only
[1:02:28] that but we are raised with him raised
[1:02:30] up what in a system a denomination
[1:02:33] organization that's the prophet we are
[1:02:35] resurrected in the kingdom of God and
[1:02:39] the kingdom of God is within you that's
[1:02:40] the prophet yes sir why all these
[1:02:43] man-made systems Must
[1:02:48] Fall not once more I'll shake the world
[1:02:51] but I'll shake heavens and those things
[1:02:53] that cannot be shook is what will remain
[1:02:57] and we receive a kingdom receiving a
[1:02:59] kingdom that cannot be shook or moved
[1:03:02] that's the kingdom of God not a system
[1:03:05] not a political whe not a denomination
[1:03:08] but a kingdom and its subjects are dead
[1:03:11] to the systems of this
[1:03:14] world dead to the system on your job
[1:03:18] dead to the systems of the culture dead
[1:03:21] to the systems of the fashion dead to
[1:03:24] the systems of what the other young
[1:03:25] people people are doing dead to the
[1:03:27] systems of what other men do and it's
[1:03:29] normal and everybody else is doing it
[1:03:31] you're dead to all of
[1:03:33] that I don't care what the other wives
[1:03:36] do dead to that I don't care what your
[1:03:39] cousins and your sisters I don't care
[1:03:41] what they do dead to it because your
[1:03:44] life is hi in Christ everything you do
[1:03:46] is measured by Christ not measured by
[1:03:49] the church but measured by Christ can
[1:03:52] the church say Amen have that's done
[1:03:54] everybody can the church
[1:03:56] amen oh my we going to have a clean
[1:04:01] church we going to have a pure Church
[1:04:03] we're going to have a holy church we're
[1:04:05] going to have a church where Jesus feels
[1:04:07] welcome to walk in through the aises uh
[1:04:10] and sit next to you and say God bless
[1:04:13] you the same he sat there in the temple
[1:04:16] before they called him Jesus was just
[1:04:18] there he was in the church it was his
[1:04:21] custom to be in the church but he didn't
[1:04:23] even realize who he was and there's some
[1:04:25] Sons and Daughters here that we don't
[1:04:27] even realize who you are but you are
[1:04:29] attribute sons of God I don't care how
[1:04:32] you're living doesn't change the fact
[1:04:34] that he called you for such a
[1:04:37] time as
[1:04:41] this
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:45] Hallelujah brother brandom said in the
[1:04:47] message perfect strength by Perfect
[1:04:51] weakness you have your seat belts on
[1:04:53] right we're going for a ride amen
[1:04:56] hallelujah
[1:04:57] hallelujah God's strategy is to take
[1:05:01] empty human vessels and shake the world
[1:05:04] with them that's all God wants to do
[1:05:07] take empty human vessels and shake the
[1:05:11] world with them like at Pentecost at
[1:05:14] Pentecost what did he do it taken them
[1:05:16] 10 days to get all emptied up but it was
[1:05:19] all standing there where their vessels
[1:05:21] turned up and God took himself and
[1:05:24] filled them up that's all
[1:05:26] that's the need of today that's what we
[1:05:29] need today is empty vessels so God can
[1:05:32] fill them
[1:05:34] up listen carefully friends God cannot
[1:05:38] use them as long as they're already
[1:05:41] filled
[1:05:44] up so when he saying Lord fill
[1:05:48] me if you not empty there's
[1:05:52] nothing he can do amen amen yes
[1:05:55] Hallelujah because to pour in there has
[1:05:58] to be
[1:05:59] room for him to
[1:06:02] pour is there anybody willing this
[1:06:04] morning to
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:08] empty empty
[1:06:12] themselves to empty your
[1:06:15] thoughts to empty your
[1:06:18] qualifications to empty the chip you
[1:06:20] have on your shoulder to empty who your
[1:06:23] family is to empty this is what makes me
[1:06:27] what I am to empty this is how I feel
[1:06:29] about this brother this is how I feel
[1:06:31] about this sister this is this is the
[1:06:33] problem that I have many people are
[1:06:36] filled up with their
[1:06:37] problems filled up with their issues
[1:06:41] filled up with their
[1:06:43] situations Hallelujah can we empty
[1:06:46] ourselves this morning so God can fill
[1:06:50] the vessels because if he fills the
[1:06:52] vessels everything will begin to change
[1:06:56] because when he steps into the picture
[1:06:58] nothing could stay the same way one time
[1:07:01] Aaron left his Rod by mistake into the
[1:07:04] holy of holies and overnight it started
[1:07:07] to grow because it was in the presence
[1:07:09] imagine if that presence gets placed
[1:07:12] inside of you what will it do to cancer
[1:07:16] what will it do to diabetes what will it
[1:07:19] do
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:21] to light and darkness cannot stay in the
[1:07:25] same house house if that same spirit
[1:07:28] that raised Christ from the dead dwells
[1:07:30] in you the Bible says it will Quicken
[1:07:32] your mortal
[1:07:35] body it'll Quicken your mortal body you
[1:07:39] may be seated it doesn't mean if you die
[1:07:41] it just rais you up again but it means
[1:07:43] you could be walking and being quickened
[1:07:46] because that life has an effect that
[1:07:48] Spirit has an effect there's a result
[1:07:51] whenever that Spirit comes in contact
[1:07:53] with something they has got to be a
[1:07:55] result can the church say Amen Hall oh
[1:08:00] Hall but the challenge today thank you
[1:08:04] Lord is that people don't want to give
[1:08:06] up amen people don't want to empty up
[1:08:09] people don't want to let go because
[1:08:11] people have their own biases their own
[1:08:13] feelings and because God is so good he
[1:08:15] gives you free
[1:08:17] will he's not forcing himself and
[1:08:19] anybody he's a gentleman he saids behold
[1:08:23] I stand at the door and knock amen and
[1:08:25] if any man hear my voice I'm not coming
[1:08:28] and breaking down your
[1:08:30] door I'm not doing that but I'm going to
[1:08:33] knock am and I'm going to knock am and
[1:08:36] I'm going to knock until I get tired of
[1:08:38] knocking because the Bible says seeking
[1:08:41] the Lord while he might be found call
[1:08:43] upon him while he is near so there's a
[1:08:45] time limit when God will no longer knock
[1:08:48] what will your excuse be for not opening
[1:08:50] the door it was my mother it was my
[1:08:53] father it was the pastor it was the
[1:08:55] church it was my job I had no money I
[1:08:58] wasn't feeling well I was vexed I had a
[1:09:01] bad day I had a bad week I had a bad
[1:09:03] month I had a bad year I had a bad
[1:09:06] decade I had a bad my whole life what
[1:09:08] will your excuse
[1:09:11] be some months ago I preached a message
[1:09:14] no more excuses because when Moses stood
[1:09:17] in front the burning bush and he said I
[1:09:19] can't talk I can't walk I don't know
[1:09:21] this I don't know that after he was
[1:09:23] finished God say you're still going you
[1:09:25] have any more excuses because after all
[1:09:28] of your excuses it's still up to the in
[1:09:31] individual you cannot blame anybody and
[1:09:34] if God says you are going you have got
[1:09:36] to
[1:09:38] go you may be
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:43] seated Jonah thought he was okay when
[1:09:46] God told him go this way he said you
[1:09:48] know what let me slip
[1:09:51] out Hallelujah let me slip out the other
[1:09:55] way
[1:09:56] and while Jonah is slipping out the
[1:09:58] other way thinking he's flying under the
[1:10:00] radar he take a ship he say there's no
[1:10:03] way God will get me off of this ship I
[1:10:05] on the
[1:10:07] ship and while the boat is heading in
[1:10:09] the wrong direction the Bible said a
[1:10:12] storm came and as the boat shaking Jonah
[1:10:15] has to feel
[1:10:17] convicted that's when you know you're
[1:10:19] call you
[1:10:20] know when you start to feel convicted
[1:10:23] when you know down in your soul this
[1:10:25] ain't right amen this road are going
[1:10:28] down here right Hallelujah everybody
[1:10:30] else on this boat but I am out of place
[1:10:33] this party I'm in it air right what I'm
[1:10:36] wearing today it air right how I left
[1:10:39] home this morning it air right this
[1:10:41] music I'm listening to it a right this
[1:10:44] conversation I'm in it air right this
[1:10:47] job I'm in it air right Jonah say listen
[1:10:50] it's not always is the problem I am the
[1:10:54] problem God give us some Christians who
[1:10:57] could say I am the problem you may be
[1:11:00] seated listen you see whenever you hear
[1:11:03] from God your vocabulary changes from
[1:11:06] you them to I when Isaiah met the Lord
[1:11:09] he say who is
[1:11:11] me I am a man of unclean lips whenever
[1:11:14] you meet God it's never about anybody
[1:11:16] else you look at your own life and say
[1:11:18] Lord I'm a sinner I'm a sinful man I
[1:11:21] need help I need a touch so Jonah
[1:11:24] confronted the real of his existence and
[1:11:26] say I am the
[1:11:28] problem he said throw me overboard he
[1:11:31] had to have Fai in he said throw me over
[1:11:33] boat I don't know if Jonah could swim
[1:11:35] but he just said get me off of this boat
[1:11:37] he had enough confidence that if he get
[1:11:39] off there be fine and when Jonah got off
[1:11:42] of the boat there was a prepared fish
[1:11:44] for Jonah Jonah didn't even know this
[1:11:46] fish had
[1:11:48] GPS because his fish was programmed to
[1:11:52] take Jonah direct to his Destiny I want
[1:11:55] to say Church you will get to your
[1:11:57] destiny the easy way or the hard way
[1:12:00] Jonah had the option to go straight to
[1:12:03] Nineveh he took the hard way but he end
[1:12:05] up right at Nineveh and you young people
[1:12:08] in the church you could take the easy
[1:12:10] way or you can take the hard way but you
[1:12:13] are going to get the Holy Ghost you are
[1:12:15] going to dress right you are going to
[1:12:16] live right you are going to act right
[1:12:19] you will respect your parents you will
[1:12:21] honor God the easy way or the hard way
[1:12:24] but it's going to
[1:12:33] happen can the church say Amen not by
[1:12:36] power not by might but by the spirit say
[1:12:40] the Lord can the church say Amen
[1:12:42] everybody feeling fine everybody feeling
[1:12:45] good everybody feeling in the
[1:12:48] spirit my you may be
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:53] seated so God
[1:12:56] God got to have empty
[1:12:58] vessels so he can fill them up and
[1:13:02] that's what all the situations in your
[1:13:04] life that you cannot explain is all
[1:13:07] about all right it's God's desire for
[1:13:10] you to empty out because when you are
[1:13:12] filled you depend on what you are filled
[1:13:14] with so when you have too much money
[1:13:17] your money is what you depend on when
[1:13:19] you filled with wealth you go by the
[1:13:21] doctor no wonder the woman with the
[1:13:23] issue of blood it was when her money ran
[1:13:25] out and she was empty that she had to
[1:13:27] look for an alternative solution to the
[1:13:29] problem she had had she had money she
[1:13:31] would have found every single doctor but
[1:13:33] the Bible said she exhausted her
[1:13:36] resources she was
[1:13:38] empty and her emptiness brought her
[1:13:41] desperation to look for alternative
[1:13:46] medication is there anybody in the house
[1:13:48] looking for alternative medication this
[1:13:51] morning you tried money you tried
[1:13:54] fornication you tried drinking you tried
[1:13:57] false Doctrine you tried being a good
[1:13:59] church member but that's not the same
[1:14:01] thing as the medication of the baptism
[1:14:04] of the Holy Ghost when the spirit comes
[1:14:07] upon you it's a whole different walk
[1:14:09] it's a different talk it's a different
[1:14:11] life can the church say
[1:14:17] Amen Hall
[1:14:21] Mall from the message speak to this
[1:14:24] mountain amen I believe that the Church
[1:14:26] of the Living God is moving into a
[1:14:28] sphere now that's going to shake the
[1:14:31] whole
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:35] world the shaking of this world is not
[1:14:38] because of natural Powers right now
[1:14:40] there's political shaking there's
[1:14:42] there's there's government shaking there
[1:14:44] wars and rumors of wars there's oil and
[1:14:46] there's recessions and all of this this
[1:14:48] is this is scripture being fulfilled we
[1:14:51] shouldn't be surprised in fact we have
[1:14:53] the heads up we know what's going to
[1:14:54] happen before it happens people have to
[1:14:56] go to school and study economics and
[1:14:58] thing and say well it's boom and bus
[1:15:00] cycle we know that
[1:15:04] already I don't need a degree to tell
[1:15:06] you this whole world going on in the
[1:15:07] financial ruin the Bible says so people
[1:15:11] go and study for seven years to get a
[1:15:12] doctorate in in in economic toity
[1:15:14] currency this and that and that the
[1:15:16] Bible already tells you that
[1:15:19] already wars and rumors of wars you
[1:15:22] already you already have the script but
[1:15:24] the end is not
[1:15:25] yet Hall but this gospel will be
[1:15:29] preached and then the end will come
[1:15:33] that's our gospel that's our message
[1:15:36] that's our word so nothing Russia could
[1:15:39] do could affect the plan of Rush has to
[1:15:41] wait on US president Trump have to wait
[1:15:43] on us they have to wait for us to sign
[1:15:45] off and say Lord we ready we we have
[1:15:47] preached the gospel in power and
[1:15:49] demonstration we are ready for the
[1:15:51] Rapture then the end will come that's
[1:15:53] the gospel
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:16:02] H
[1:16:04] amen amen when Jesus stood in front of
[1:16:08] pilot and these guys he said power what
[1:16:10] powering is my father give all the
[1:16:12] permission to you have a little piece of
[1:16:14] garden and is my father give her the
[1:16:15] garden you have what you talking about
[1:16:17] if I want back up I call in back up they
[1:16:19] didn't realize who he was but Jesus knew
[1:16:22] who he was and his knowledge of who he
[1:16:24] was and the position of who he was gave
[1:16:25] him a certain authority of faith and
[1:16:27] confidence to live a certain way and
[1:16:29] that's how we ought to be he wasn't in
[1:16:31] the best position when he was in prison
[1:16:34] but he didn't change a fact of who he
[1:16:35] was Joseph in prison didn't change the
[1:16:38] fact of who he
[1:16:39] was Jesus sleeping on the board didn't
[1:16:42] change the fact of who he was so whether
[1:16:44] you are tired weary sick or frustrated
[1:16:46] doesn't change the fact of who you are
[1:16:49] and the power that's locked up inside of
[1:16:51] you somebody say
[1:16:53] Amen H
[1:16:57] Hallelujah god brother BR said I believe
[1:16:59] that the Church of the Living God is
[1:17:01] moving into a sphere now that's going to
[1:17:03] shake the whole world that's the first
[1:17:06] time it's been since the days of Jesus
[1:17:08] of Nazareth to a human being ask
[1:17:11] anything that you will and it shall be
[1:17:13] given unto you anything you desire Lord
[1:17:17] don't you see the words of Jesus Christ
[1:17:18] being fulfill oh it's going to happen

[1:17:23] in this meeting but braham's faith for
[1:17:25] so much this is 1959 huh I'm waiting I'm
[1:17:28] wanting it to happen now that the
[1:17:30] anointing will strike the whole Church
[1:17:33] of the Living God and she rise to her
[1:17:35] feet like a mighty marching Army the
[1:17:38] sick will be healed by a word the blind
[1:17:42] will see the deaf will hear the dead
[1:17:44] will be raised up and the power of God
[1:17:47] will shake the world with the Church of
[1:17:49] the Living God we are in the process of
[1:17:51] it now I believe it's soon coming to
[1:17:54] pass I believe it will be just exactly
[1:17:57] that way I believe it's going to strike
[1:18:00] the Church of God soon and listen listen
[1:18:02] to the promise and it's going to start a
[1:18:05] Revival that will shake the world I
[1:18:07] believe it

[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:16] amen so in every age we know there was a
[1:18:19] thunder amen and this age and this time
[1:18:24] all all the Thunders from every Age come
[1:18:27] together because is the last age and in
[1:18:29] the message of the expectation with
[1:18:30] theam said now if God has promised a
[1:18:32] Revival we're going to have it am so

[1:18:41] because but the Bram is just bringing
[1:18:43] the promises to the people he's not
[1:18:45] speaking to their situation he is
[1:18:47] speaking about the promise she said if
[1:18:49] God promised to heal let's make ready
[1:18:52] for it so he is speaking to people
[1:18:54] looking for healing and he said well if
[1:18:56] you are about to be healed get ready for
[1:19:03] it I want to to sink in a little bit if
[1:19:05] you if you're on a destination for the

[1:19:39] now it'll seem
[1:19:40] foolish now you say well how it's going
[1:19:43] to happen in a day like this and I don't
[1:19:45] care what anything contrary is to that
[1:19:48] is wrong we can't see it I see a hope of
[1:19:50] it look like but if God said so let's do
[1:19:53] it anyhow because God said so I'm
[1:19:55] expecting it somebody say Amen my so
[1:19:59] anybody expecting a
[1:20:04] Revival I'm under great expectation
[1:20:07] Hallelujah for real Revival amen amen
[1:20:11] yes sir in about 40 days we'll have our
[1:20:14] convention here in the Tabernacle and
[1:20:15] I'm under great expectation amen if you
[1:20:18] are under unex for your own life and
[1:20:20] your own walk that's you but I'm under
[1:20:22] expectation amen but the brandom said
[1:20:24] and I want bring it back to the church
[1:20:26] so we know what we are expecting but the
[1:20:28] B said that a Revival causes five
[1:20:31] things he said a Revival brings souls to
[1:20:34] Christ but said it will bring the church
[1:20:37] back to the spiritual condition it
[1:20:40] should be
[1:20:41] in he said a Revival brings close
[1:20:44] communion with God a Revival brings
[1:20:47] Fellowship among the churches and in a
[1:20:50] Revival you pray for the sick and mother
[1:20:52] band in the message making the valley
[1:20:54] full of ditch he said that's what we
[1:20:56] need tonight is a good oldfashioned
[1:20:58] backwards sin killing sky blue religion
[1:21:02] bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:05] amen that's what we need and in the
[1:21:07] third seal it's a familiar Cod that's
[1:21:09] the reason that the revivals that we are
[1:21:11] supposed to have we have the nomination
[1:21:13] revivals we haven't had a real stirring
[1:21:15] no no no no no sir don't think we have
[1:21:17] got revivals we haven't oh they got
[1:21:20] millions and millions and millions of
[1:21:22] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[1:21:25] but the say the bride hasn't had a
[1:21:27] Revival yet see there's been no Revival
[1:21:30] there no manifestation of God to stirred
[1:21:32] a bride yet we are looking for it it'll
[1:21:36] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[1:21:38] there to wake her up again he will send
[1:21:41] it he promised it so what are you
[1:21:44] looking for preacher I'm looking for a
[1:21:46] manifestation of God that stir the bride
[1:21:50] for a reality that'll make you walk
[1:21:52] different talk different live like a
[1:21:55] Christian can the church
[1:21:58] amen oh my
[1:22:03] Hallelujah the seventh Thunder Revival
[1:22:05] is the pride Revival if there's no
[1:22:08] seventh Thunder Revival there will be no
[1:22:10] Rapture if there's no seventh in Revival
[1:22:12] there'll be no Resurrection the seventh
[1:22:14] tunders is what gathers the bride the
[1:22:16] seventh tunders will give the bride FEI
[1:22:18] the seven Thunders will show the bride
[1:22:20] how to go but the said this is still my
[1:22:23] background I'm getting to myt
[1:22:25] shortly and the only way you're ever
[1:22:28] going to see your way out of whatever
[1:22:30] you're going through is an oldfashioned
[1:22:33] spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah
[1:22:36] of God is ringing from the bottom of
[1:22:38] your heart and an oldfashioned Holy
[1:22:40] Ghost sent Revival hits the place then
[1:22:42] you begin to see things then God will
[1:22:45] begin to reveal things then you will
[1:22:47] wonder why these real CHR are hanging on
[1:22:49] while they are praying for you can the
[1:22:51] church say amen amen oh Hallelujah let
[1:22:54] me wrap up my initial thoughts here
[1:22:58] Glory but the brandom said the
[1:23:00] church is a born again bunch of
[1:23:04] Believers that's in Christ by the Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost right led by the spirit of God
[1:23:11] that's what he describes the church as
[1:23:13] they're not of the world they are out of
[1:23:16] the world they are different from the
[1:23:18] world am that's what makes them what
[1:23:22] they are so what makes them what they
[1:23:24] are is their difference from the world
[1:23:27] Hallelujah that's what's make them their
[1:23:29] life is dead and their hid in Christ
[1:23:32] dead in Christ ande and sealed by the
[1:23:35] Holy Ghost they away from the things of
[1:23:37] the world Hallelujah sons of God are led
[1:23:40] by the spirit of God not led by some of
[1:23:42] the Fanatics or some organization or
[1:23:44] something or another they're led by the
[1:23:47] spirit of God the Holy Spirit listen was
[1:23:49] given to the church to be the overseer
[1:23:52] the tutor that was to raise the church
[1:23:54] children of God not our Bishops and
[1:23:56] Cardinals and so forth but the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost and listen to what P said I'm
[1:24:01] expecting this is my expectation also
[1:24:04] I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not
[1:24:07] denomination not a bishop not a Catholic
[1:24:09] priest not a Baptist preacher or a pend
[1:24:12] I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come
[1:24:14] down and set in order a church that will
[1:24:17] go to meet him filled with the power and
[1:24:19] the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting
[1:24:22] that I believe that God promis it that
[1:24:24] there' be a church without spot or
[1:24:26] wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because
[1:24:30] God said
[1:24:33] so can the church say Amen am so let me
[1:24:36] strike my text a little bit the spirit
[1:24:39] raising a standard to meet the challenge
[1:24:43] of the hour yes sir now every hour has
[1:24:45] its
[1:24:47] challenges in the days of Noah they had
[1:24:49] their challenges in the day of Moses
[1:24:51] they had their challenges in the day of
[1:24:53] Moses they were in slavery they were
[1:24:55] working for the Egyptians they were
[1:24:56] under the oppression of pharaoh that was
[1:24:58] a challenge that they were facing and
[1:25:01] they had to have something to meet the
[1:25:03] challenge of that hour so when God sent
[1:25:05] Moses down to Egypt they finally got a
[1:25:08] hope to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:25:10] am in every age in the Dark Ages the
[1:25:12] Christians were being killed in Lions
[1:25:15] then and this that was the challenge of
[1:25:17] the hour and they had to have a great
[1:25:19] faith to live in that hour how many
[1:25:21] people wish they could be in that age
[1:25:24] where are
[1:25:31] the in that age it was easy you know it
[1:25:34] was just one question are you a
[1:25:36] Christian and there were only two
[1:25:38] possible answers CU there was no maybe
[1:25:40] it's either yes or no if it was yes it
[1:25:42] was Lions then if it was yes it was hang
[1:25:44] at the cross if it was no you go and you
[1:25:47] live your life and I'm not with those
[1:25:49] people that day was easy this day is
[1:25:51] harder the Bible say there'll be a day
[1:25:53] where it's need day or night he's in the
[1:25:55] middle everything is gray you're not too
[1:25:58] sure you have a lot of Mayes now that's
[1:26:01] right there's no yes and there's no
[1:26:02] there's are you a Christian kind
[1:26:05] of I'm in the
[1:26:10] message gray area in the messy but the
[1:26:13] M's not adding up walking in the middle
[1:26:16] amen but there's a challenge in every
[1:26:18] age and there a challenge of this hour
[1:26:21] and something has to come for us to meet
[1:26:23] and match the the challenge of the hour
[1:26:26] now I shared this with the church before
[1:26:28] but everybody was not here it was a
[1:26:29] communion
[1:26:31] service a long time ago I think about a
[1:26:33] year or two ago and I was speaking about
[1:26:36] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:26:39] spirit would raise a standard against it
[1:26:42] we all familiar with the scripture right
[1:26:44] so I was meditating on this scripture
[1:26:46] when the enemy comes in like a flood and
[1:26:47] I always wondered why did the Bible use
[1:26:51] the word flood to describe it why not
[1:26:54] when the enemy comes in like a
[1:26:56] earthquake or the enemy comes in like a
[1:26:58] tornado or the enemy come in like a
[1:27:00] hurricane but it said when the enemy
[1:27:02] comes in like a
[1:27:03] flood and a flood is defined as an
[1:27:06] overflow of water that submerges land
[1:27:09] with is usually
[1:27:12] dry a flood is when water ends up where
[1:27:15] it's not supposed to be it usually takes
[1:27:19] time for a flood to
[1:27:21] develop Rain Must Fall for a prolonged
[1:27:24] period of time for a flood to develop am
[1:27:27] a earthquake lasts a few seconds but a a
[1:27:29] a flood is different a flood destroys
[1:27:32] lives property change the landscape and
[1:27:35] it could last for a long time in nature
[1:27:38] you can't fight a flood if there's a
[1:27:40] fire you could pull a fire extinguisher
[1:27:42] but what do you do when there's a flood
[1:27:45] a flood is something it takes time and
[1:27:47] it it it happens and and and you just
[1:27:50] have to deal with it you could build a
[1:27:52] house to handle earthquakes tornadoes
[1:27:54] fire but a flood is different yes yes
[1:27:57] the average tornado could last 10
[1:28:00] minutes maybe an hour but a flood could
[1:28:02] last for months in Noah's day the flood
[1:28:05] lasted 40 days and 40 nights the three
[1:28:09] worst disasters in the last thousand
[1:28:12] years have all been
[1:28:13] floods in 1931 it was estimated that up
[1:28:17] to 4 million people were killed in the
[1:28:20] hill River flood you could try to to
[1:28:24] prevent it but you couldn't stop it
[1:28:26] Hallelujah a flood comes to destroy it
[1:28:28] comes to break down it it comes to break
[1:28:31] up but the Bible says when the enemy
[1:28:33] comes in like a flood the spirit would
[1:28:36] raise a
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:38] [Applause]
[1:28:40] standard and many of us in our lives in
[1:28:43] our walk it has been like rain upon rain
[1:28:47] upon rain when you thought something
[1:28:49] else couldn't go wrong it was rain and
[1:28:51] now you look around your life and it
[1:28:52] seems as you're standing in this flood
[1:28:55] but when the enemy comes like a flood
[1:28:57] that's when the spirit would raise a
[1:29:00] standard and in the spiritually the
[1:29:02] enemy has attacked there has been flood
[1:29:04] after flood flood of evil flood of
[1:29:07] sickness flood of interpretation but
[1:29:10] every time there's a flood the spirit
[1:29:12] would always come and raise the standard
[1:29:16] can the church say Amen the three Hebrew
[1:29:19] boys they were there and they had their
[1:29:21] testimony and they told them listen you
[1:29:24] can't pray you can't worship you have to
[1:29:26] bow down and they said we will not bow
[1:29:28] down and they had to deal with their own
[1:29:31] flood they had to deal with their own
[1:29:33] Challenge and they say we will not bow
[1:29:35] down but when they enter the fiery
[1:29:37] furnace the spirit raised a standard and
[1:29:40] stood up to defend them and they
[1:29:42] overcame the flood the situation that
[1:29:45] they had to deal with there's no flood
[1:29:47] there's no situation there's no
[1:29:50] temptation there's no trial that the
[1:29:52] spirit cannot raise the
[1:29:54] standard against it can the church say
[1:29:58] Amen not by might nor by power but by my
[1:30:03] spirit say the Lord so maybe you're
[1:30:05] dealing with the flood of high blood
[1:30:07] pressure when the enemy comes in like a
[1:30:09] flood the spirit will raise the
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:16] standard in every age Lord they had
[1:30:19] their floods that's right and we have
[1:30:22] all floods
[1:30:25] also God doesn't have shortcuts amen and
[1:30:28] God is not in the business of making it
[1:30:31] easy for some people all that come to
[1:30:35] God have to be tried have to be tested
[1:30:39] and you have your personal flood that
[1:30:42] you have to deal with in your life you
[1:30:44] will have the hurricanes and you have
[1:30:45] your storms too but the flood is serious
[1:30:47] but we all have our personal floods but
[1:30:50] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:30:53] Bible says the spirit would raise a
[1:30:56] standard Hallelujah and I shared it
[1:30:58] before because I know many people don't
[1:30:59] know what a standard is and in ancient
[1:31:02] times a standard
[1:31:04] identified who you
[1:31:06] were so the tribe of Judah would have
[1:31:10] its standard it would have been a stick
[1:31:13] with a symbol or something on it that
[1:31:16] would represent the tribe all right so
[1:31:19] when the Philistines and the jebusites
[1:31:22] and the Hittites come they would all
[1:31:24] have their standards their banners that
[1:31:27] represented who they are the standard
[1:31:30] would say whose side you're on the
[1:31:32] standard would represent your history
[1:31:34] because you would take time to have a
[1:31:37] standard so Judah might have been a lion
[1:31:39] and whatever it was was the standard of
[1:31:41] the tribe and the tribe rep the the
[1:31:44] standard represents what you
[1:31:46] believe the stand when you see the
[1:31:48] standard it's a reminder of what you're
[1:31:50] fighting for amen amen hallelujah
[1:31:54] standard is supposed to keep you
[1:31:55] together yes because where the standard
[1:31:57] is that's where your the rest of your
[1:31:59] people are because the Army moves with
[1:32:02] the standard so when the tribes of
[1:32:04] Israel come together for war you would
[1:32:06] see the standard for Judah the standard
[1:32:08] for God the standard for Nalan all the
[1:32:11] men of War would stand with their
[1:32:12] standard amen and when the standard be
[1:32:15] said charge you would move with the
[1:32:19] standard In the Heat of the battle the
[1:32:22] standard would mean hope because you
[1:32:24] could be under pressure but once the
[1:32:26] standard is being lifted you know
[1:32:28] there's somebody else on your side who
[1:32:31] is holding the standard
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:34] up if the enemy has you on the ropes you
[1:32:37] got to look for where the standard is
[1:32:39] because the standard mean there are more
[1:32:41] men around the
[1:32:43] standard oh you don't hear me this
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:49] morning
[1:32:51] hall hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:56] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:32:59] and normally the standard would be
[1:33:01] whereever the king or the general is
[1:33:04] amen amen the general will stand there
[1:33:06] because he represent the last Bastion so
[1:33:08] even when men would go to fight the
[1:33:11] general will be there with the standard
[1:33:13] to let you know we are here and if I
[1:33:15] need to send in more reinforcements the
[1:33:18] reinforcement will come from the
[1:33:19] standard okay man over there over there
[1:33:21] over to that side amen when when the
[1:33:24] standard Falls it means you're finished
[1:33:26] all right all
[1:33:27] right if the standard Falls it means the
[1:33:31] Army is finished because whatever
[1:33:33] happens the men would fight to defend
[1:33:35] the standard even if there's one man
[1:33:37] left with the standard they would take
[1:33:40] the standard back to whoever was
[1:33:42] remaining and form another Army around
[1:33:44] the standard that's how powerful the
[1:33:45] standard
[1:33:51] was when you see the stand it means
[1:33:54] rally when you see the standard it means
[1:33:57] this is where we make our stand if we
[1:34:01] must die here we will die here but we
[1:34:04] are standing with the
[1:34:08] standard you may be
[1:34:11] seated depending on how you use it the
[1:34:14] standard could mean charge the standard
[1:34:17] could mean go to the left this stand
[1:34:19] mean go to the right the stand mean to
[1:34:21] pull back
[1:34:22] Hallelujah
[1:34:24] you may be
[1:34:25] seated in those days they had no
[1:34:28] walkie-talkies they had no radios they
[1:34:30] had nobody saying I'm on channel two
[1:34:33] move to the left mve in now no the
[1:34:35] standard is where the instructions came
[1:34:37] from so when you see the standard
[1:34:39] circleing it meant something it means
[1:34:41] everybody get into war right when the
[1:34:43] standard go up and down it means
[1:34:45] something that's how important the
[1:34:46] standard was the standard Bearer had to
[1:34:50] know when was the right time to move the
[1:34:52] standard the right time to raise the
[1:34:55] standard because you don't want to give
[1:34:57] away the move before it's time the
[1:34:59] standard bearer was one of the most
[1:35:01] important roles outside of the general
[1:35:04] but the Bible says when the enemy comes
[1:35:07] in like a flood the spirit would raise
[1:35:10] the standard it wouldn't be man raising
[1:35:13] the standard it wouldn't be oh you don't
[1:35:16] hear me it'll be the spirit itself given
[1:35:19] the cry to charge when it's time to for
[1:35:22] your children to come back the spirit
[1:35:25] would say time is up bring them in raise
[1:35:29] the standard prepare for war time to
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:39] attack you may be seated
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:46] Hallelujah so I want you to understand
[1:35:50] what the scripture means and in
[1:35:52] context Hallelujah God is not trusting
[1:35:54] this standard to anybody else all right
[1:35:56] all right he said for this flood I'll
[1:35:58] raise the standard myself amen I will
[1:36:01] give the orders myself I will give the
[1:36:03] instructions myself now in modern times
[1:36:07] we don't have standards like those
[1:36:10] anymore in modern times we call it a
[1:36:13] flag that's right that's the modern
[1:36:16] version of what they had a standards
[1:36:18] years ago so when soldiers go to
[1:36:22] war I know there's some brothers here
[1:36:24] who would smile when they say when man
[1:36:26] went to the moon they put the flag on
[1:36:29] the moon there's some brothers who say
[1:36:30] well man didn't go to the Moon that's a
[1:36:32] different
[1:36:34] message but wherever you go and you
[1:36:37] claim the territory your standard marks
[1:36:40] possession that's right
[1:36:42] amen amen so when Joshua would have
[1:36:45] entered into the promised land every
[1:36:47] place you put your foot is yours they
[1:36:49] would make sure when they took an area
[1:36:51] they put a standard up this is
[1:36:55] bur Judah God whatever it is the
[1:36:59] standard represented
[1:37:02] ownership can the church say Amen the
[1:37:05] standard the banner the flag it means
[1:37:07] this is our territory yes this is my
[1:37:10] family this is my house as for me and my
[1:37:14] house we will serve the Lord there's a
[1:37:16] standard in my house there's a standard
[1:37:18] in my life can the Church Say
[1:37:22] Amen amen oh my and I shared
[1:37:27] this I shared this story back then when
[1:37:30] I preach on this there was a story of a
[1:37:33] war that was going on and brother Knight
[1:37:36] they were losing the war right and the
[1:37:38] standard Bearer he was running ahead of
[1:37:41] the other men and as he is running the
[1:37:44] men around him are being killed left and
[1:37:47] right but he knows that they have to get
[1:37:49] to the other side and the general of the
[1:37:52] army scream out to the flag bearer he
[1:37:57] said bring back the flag we got to
[1:38:00] retreat and that flag bearer scream back
[1:38:04] I'm not bringing it back bring up the
[1:38:06] men bring up the backup I've got to keep
[1:38:09] going I've come too far to turn back now
[1:38:13] bring up the men I've already reached
[1:38:16] this far I'm not going to retreat now
[1:38:19] I've been a Christian for this long I
[1:38:21] might have lost Brothers I might have
[1:38:24] lost sisters but I'm heading to the
[1:38:26] promised land bring up the men bring up
[1:38:30] the
[1:38:33] soldiers no retreat no giving up I might
[1:38:37] be tired but I'm not giving up I might
[1:38:40] be weary but I'm not giving up I might
[1:38:42] be standing alone but I'm not giving up
[1:38:46] bring up to men and this morning I say
[1:38:49] bring up the men the land is a good land
[1:38:52] it's a flowing land flowing milk and
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:58] honey oh
[1:39:01] hallelujah
[1:39:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah prise
[1:39:09] God praise God so when the enemy comes
[1:39:12] in like a flood the spirit Hallelujah
[1:39:15] would give the final charge and all
[1:39:18] through history we have had standard
[1:39:20] bearers Gideon was a standard Bearer he
[1:39:23] said the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
[1:39:26] what a declaration what a faith the
[1:39:30] sword of the Lord and of Gideon Joshua
[1:39:33] was a standard Bearer The Enemy had come
[1:39:35] like a flood and he needed more light he
[1:39:38] couldn't do it himself and he spoke and
[1:39:41] said Son stand still and the spirit
[1:39:45] raised the
[1:39:46] standard can the church say Amen oh my
[1:39:51] and I said it before you may be seated
[1:39:53] Joshua was just so focused on winning
[1:39:56] the war Joshua wasn't study about
[1:39:58] physics or geometry or geology because
[1:40:01] as anybody knows the sun doesn't move
[1:40:04] around the earth it's the Earth moves
[1:40:05] around the Sun so when Joshua says son
[1:40:08] stand still he actually activate some
[1:40:11] mathematical equations for the earth to
[1:40:13] stop
[1:40:16] moving Joshua wasn't bright enough to
[1:40:19] know it was the Earth had to stop moving
[1:40:21] amen he say son stand stand still and
[1:40:24] God said you know what to do stop the
[1:40:26] Earth because a son needs some backup so
[1:40:30] you might didn't even say the right way
[1:40:33] but when he say Lord help me God knows
[1:40:35] what to do it's his son it's he could oh
[1:40:38] you don't hear me this
[1:40:39] [Applause]

[1:40:56] a
[1:40:57] groan I hear the Cry of my people you
[1:41:00] might even be able to say it in words

[1:44:33] brother brandham came to point us to the
[1:44:35] standard he came to forun the standard
[1:44:38] because the standard is the greatest
[1:44:40] weapon that the world has ever seen the
[1:44:43] standard is the word the standard is
[1:44:45] spirit and when the word and spirit
[1:44:47] comes together the standard is called
[1:44:49] Dynamics the standard is called
[1:44:51] mechanics and Dynamics together T and
[1:44:53] lat rain that's the standard the
[1:44:56] standard was laid down on the day of
[1:44:58] Pentecost when brother pandam said uh
[1:45:01] before the doctor's hands touches my
[1:45:03] wife the standard was being lifted to
[1:45:06] show that the standard is still here oh
[1:45:09] you don't hear me this morning the
[1:45:11] standard has never
[1:45:13] left can the church say amen and when
[1:45:17] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:45:19] spirit would raise the standard to give
[1:45:21] you hope to keep on fighting to give you
[1:45:24] hope to keep on pressing to give you
[1:45:26] hope that your son is coming to give you
[1:45:28] hope you're going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:45:30] he is that hope that standard is Christ
[1:45:33] in you the hope of

[1:45:42] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:45:46] and I love it I want you to really sing
[1:45:49] down because people want to claim that
[1:45:52] they are holding the
[1:45:55] standard that the standard is in this
[1:45:57] church and the angel is in that church
[1:45:59] and the anointing is in this church and
[1:46:01] the Bible says when the enemy comes in
[1:46:03] because the enemy came in and that
[1:46:05] church that was established on the day
[1:46:07] of Pentecost fell into the ground and
[1:46:09] that flood took the church out and in
[1:46:11] every age a flood came but the Bram said
[1:46:14] the floods came but Luther that standard
[1:46:17] was raising his day it wasn't Luther
[1:46:19] raising his standard it was the spirit
[1:46:22] raising his standard and when brother
[1:46:24] Bram left the standard did not leave the
[1:46:27] standard didn't hand to any man the
[1:46:29] standard was always in the hands of the
[1:46:30] spirit the standard has never left the
[1:46:33] hands of the spirit but the Holy Ghost
[1:46:35] as a standard Bearer would stand with
[1:46:38] any man who stays with the word you
[1:46:40] don't hear me this morning the standard
[1:46:42] Bearer who is the Holy Ghost will
[1:46:44] identify himself with any son who stays
[1:46:48] with the word with any daughter who
[1:46:50] stays with the word with any group who
[1:46:53] stayes
[1:46:53] [Applause]

[1:46:59] standard Bearer the spirit is the
[1:47:01] standard Bearer you may be seated the
[1:47:03] spirit has no loyalty to man The
[1:47:06] Standard Bearer only has loyalty to his
[1:47:09] word oh my and once you stay with the
[1:47:13] word that's why the prophet said full
[1:47:16] obedience to the entire word entitles
[1:47:19] you to being accompanied by the standard
[1:47:23] be because it's the spirit that follows
[1:47:26] the word it's the spirit that brings
[1:47:28] life to the word it's the spirit that
[1:47:31] quickens the
[1:47:36] word you may be

[1:48:49] for that man who was blind amen and that
[1:48:51] man went away
[1:48:53] God and he came back Hallelujah he said
[1:48:55] I'm still
[1:48:56] blind and brother Bram said it's because
[1:48:59] he didn't have
[1:49:01] faith and Faith come by hearing the word
[1:49:04] so he hadn't had enough word that was
[1:49:06] mixed with faith to activate the prayer
[1:49:08] that was already spoken so but said I
[1:49:10] can't pray for you again because I
[1:49:12] already prayed for you once I pray I
[1:49:15] already activate the resource from
[1:49:17] heaven now it's on you to have enough
[1:49:19] Faith to receive it so we told a man go
[1:49:21] around saying by stri I'm Healed because
[1:49:24] that's also the word so when that man
[1:49:26] started to say by Stripes I'm Healed by
[1:49:28] Stripes I'm Healed what he didn't realiz
[1:49:31] every time he said it it became more
[1:49:33] real to him the standard bearer was
[1:49:35] walking closer walking closer walking
[1:49:38] closer walking closer because the
[1:49:41] standard Bearer always follows the word
[1:49:44] the standard Bearer once there's Faith
[1:49:46] mixed with the word the standard Bearer
[1:49:49] he is attracted to it he a sh

[1:50:53] you don't have
[1:50:55] the my flood is different this flood
[1:50:59] it's not like anybody else's

[1:51:08] Hallelujah Lord come to church and you
[1:51:11] do your best to put on the best message
[1:51:16] Christian face you could put

[1:51:42] this morning amen I don't care what the
[1:51:44] flood is there's a
[1:51:47] word for every
[1:51:49] flood there's a word for every every
[1:51:53] situation but you have to find the word
[1:51:57] for your
[1:51:59] situation you have to find a word as
[1:52:02] David did to encourage
[1:52:06] himself the word that encourages you
[1:52:09] will be different from the word that
[1:52:10] encourages somebody else because we all
[1:52:13] have our different floods we all have
[1:52:16] our different challenges we all have our
[1:52:19] different struggles that comes with this
[1:52:21] Christian walk walk at this Christian
[1:52:24] journey I challenge you Church of the
[1:52:26] Living God to stop looking at other
[1:52:28] people's
[1:52:32] floods and trust
[1:52:35] God to bring healing in your soul and
[1:52:38] healing in your life that you could live
[1:52:41] the kind of testimony that God could say
[1:52:44] there's my son there's my daughter you
[1:52:46] imagine a flood that job was
[1:52:50] in he lost his property he lost his
[1:52:54] children he lost his money and his wife
[1:52:57] is there with him in the
[1:52:59] flood and she say why don't you curse
[1:53:01] God and
[1:53:04] die but job kept standing because there
[1:53:07] was something in him to
[1:53:10] standall friends backsliding is not an
[1:53:14] option Hallelujah hallel giving up is
[1:53:18] not an
[1:53:21] option even though sometimes you feel
[1:53:24] like giving up some God will catch you
[1:53:27] giving up you know what the Bible says I
[1:53:29] believe in Luke Chapter 5 Jesus comes
[1:53:32] and he
[1:53:34] sees some brothers Simon and different
[1:53:37] ones I believe it was the Bible said
[1:53:39] they were washing their Nets anybody
[1:53:42] familiar with
[1:53:44] it I
[1:53:46] heard let me read it in Luke 5 verse1
[1:53:50] and it came to pass that as the the
[1:53:52] people pressed upon him to hear the word
[1:53:55] of God speak name of Jesus he stood by
[1:53:57] the lake of
[1:53:59] gazar and saw two ships standing by the
[1:54:03] leak but the fishermen were going out of
[1:54:06] them and were
[1:54:08] washing their
[1:54:11] Nets and normally when you have to ask a
[1:54:15] s question if your nets was in the water
[1:54:16] why you need to wash
[1:54:18] it but these men were washing their Nets
[1:54:21] because they were
[1:54:24] done they were
[1:54:26] finished they had caught nothing we see
[1:54:28] it later they had caught nothing but
[1:54:31] they were finished they had given up
[1:54:33] they had resigned themselves and saying
[1:54:35] we are going home without food amen
[1:54:40] amen but this day was different because
[1:54:42] Jesus comes by
[1:54:44] them and the Bible says he entered into
[1:54:47] one of the ships which was Simon's and
[1:54:49] prayed him or asked him that he would
[1:54:51] trust out a little from the
[1:54:54] land and he sat down and taught the
[1:54:56] people out of the
[1:54:58] ship and when he had left speaking he
[1:55:01] said unto Simon launch out into the deep
[1:55:04] and let down your nets for a
[1:55:06] drought and Simon answering him said
[1:55:10] Master we have toiled all night long
[1:55:14] that's why I was washing my net yes it's
[1:55:17] not that I didn't try to be a fisherman
[1:55:19] it's not I didn't try to catch it's not
[1:55:21] I didn't try to to come to church I
[1:55:25] tried but I didn't catch
[1:55:29] anything so I found myself washing my
[1:55:32] Nets I have taken nothing
[1:55:34] nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
[1:55:36] the net oh God Amen and the Bible says
[1:55:38] and when they had done this they
[1:55:40] enclosed a great multitude of fishes and
[1:55:43] their net break who and they beckoned
[1:55:46] unto their Partners which were in the
[1:55:48] other ship that they should come and
[1:55:50] help them and they came and filled both
[1:55:52] the ship so that they began to
[1:55:56] sink Hall and when Simon Peter saw it he
[1:56:00] fell down at Jesus's knees saying depart
[1:56:03] from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord
[1:56:07] for he was astonished and all that were
[1:56:10] with him at the drought of the fishes
[1:56:12] which they had taken and so was also
[1:56:15] James and John the sons of Zebedee which
[1:56:18] were pared with Simon and Jesus said
[1:56:20] unto Simon fear not from hence before
[1:56:22] thou shal catch men
[1:56:24] Hallelujah fishes of
[1:56:27] men but I want to touch on something
[1:56:30] here
[1:56:31] friends you know many times as
[1:56:35] Christians people have this bravado they
[1:56:38] would do Glory

[2:04:08] no chance it won't work children it
[2:04:10] won't work you must have the token
[2:04:13] that's it all that God has done through
[2:04:15] his word over all these years were to
[2:04:17] bring it to a spot that the token could
[2:04:20] be in your heart
[2:04:22] could be identified that you could be
[2:04:23] identified with a token and more than
[2:04:25] that the token be be identified with you
[2:04:28] but the BAM said you say I believe I
[2:04:30] believe the message you say that's all
[2:04:31] right that's good but you must have the
[2:04:34] token do you hear brandom Tabernacle and

[2:04:46] life you listen to what the word says
[2:04:48] you go to church you try to live right
[2:04:50] that's fine
[2:04:52] but that's not it when I see the blood
[2:04:55] that's the token don't just come this
[2:04:58] far say I believe the message you obey
[2:05:01] the messenger come into Christ you say
[2:05:03] well I believe every word said brother
[2:05:05] brandham that's good but that's just
[2:05:07] being able to read take the message take
[2:05:11] it into your heart that you must have
[2:05:13] the token the very light that was in
[2:05:16] Christ be in you when I see that hallu
[2:05:18] I'll pass over you Hallelujah but the
[2:05:22] man said now look at yourself we're
[2:05:25] coming to your house now we're coming to
[2:05:26] your life now look at yourself don't
[2:05:29] look at anybody look at really are you a
[2:05:30] genuine Bible Christian full of the love
[2:05:33] of God remember the Bible said in the
[2:05:36] last days when this time takes place he
[2:05:38] said a marking Angel went through the
[2:05:41] churches yes sir went through the cities
[2:05:44] and sealed only those who cried and
[2:05:47] sighed for the Abomination that was done
[2:05:50] in the city is that right Ezekiel 9 we
[2:05:52] know that's the truth Jesus that marking
[2:05:55] Angel went forth and put a mark on their
[2:05:57] head forehead seal them them that sighed
[2:06:00] and cried after that come the
[2:06:03] slaughtering angels from the four
[2:06:04] corners of the earth which is coming
[2:06:06] right away we see it com in Wars moving
[2:06:09] right in that'll kill the whole earth
[2:06:11] off there was nothing they couldn't
[2:06:13] touch but them that have that Mark my
[2:06:16] God I wonder this morning church if the
[2:06:19] marking Angel the sealing Angel moved
[2:06:21] through this church this morning I
[2:06:23] wonder how many people would be marked
[2:06:27] how many people are sighing and crying
[2:06:30] for the
[2:06:31] abomination in the city God does not
[2:06:35] recognize your attendance in church
[2:06:38] Hallelujah because that's not what he's
[2:06:39] looking for whether you come or don't
[2:06:41] come he's key already give his word he
[2:06:43] said forsake not the assembling of his
[2:06:45] said that's already
[2:06:47] spoken but this is going Beyond you
[2:06:49] coming to church this is going Beyond
[2:06:52] you being in the message this is goes
[2:06:55] down to what's in your heart Hallelujah
[2:06:57] that nobody else could see because
[2:07:00] coming to church for some is just a
[2:07:02] formality being in the message for some
[2:07:04] is just a formality Hallelujah but this
[2:07:06] is going deeper to those that sigh and
[2:07:08] cry for the abomination in the city
[2:07:11] Hallelujah those that recognize that
[2:07:13] judgment is hanging over not just the
[2:07:15] world but over the church because the
[2:07:18] Bible says begin in My Sanctuary begin
[2:07:21] in the house of God judgment begins in
[2:07:24] the house of God because we ought to
[2:07:26] know better we have the word but what
[2:07:29] are we doing with the word church we
[2:07:31] have the encouragement every week but
[2:07:33] are we sighing and crying are we praying
[2:07:36] are we seeking are we Opening Our Hearts
[2:07:38] to God and say Lord I am willing like
[2:07:41] Samson to die with the Philistines my
[2:07:44] God Amen I am willing to give
[2:07:47] up everything in the world Hallelujah
[2:07:50] I'm willing to give up the worldly life
[2:07:52] I'm willing to give up my worldly
[2:07:54] commitments I'm willing to give it all
[2:07:56] up Hallelujah for the sake of this token
[2:08:00] hallelujah oh my God praise Lord friends
[2:08:04] we have to be in rapturing condition
[2:08:08] that's what the spirit is here for not
[2:08:11] to make us jump and shout and just be in
[2:08:13] the spirit but it's to get us into a
[2:08:16] condition a condition to go into the
[2:08:18] Rapture a condition God like Peter when
[2:08:22] Peter walked people could be healed in
[2:08:23] his shadow he was in a condition what's
[2:08:27] your condition this
[2:08:30] morning this Rapture is not for a group
[2:08:33] it's not for the church it's not for the
[2:08:36] pastor it's it's it's for the
[2:08:38] individual they are pastors who will
[2:08:40] miss the Rapture they are preachers who
[2:08:43] will miss their Elders deacons song
[2:08:45] leaders and musicians in the message
[2:08:47] that will miss the
[2:08:49] Rapture because the Rapture doesn't
[2:08:51] respect your position it respects the
[2:08:54] token hallelujah hallelujah friends one
[2:08:57] taken one left you could have knowledge
[2:09:01] and miss the Rapture you could speak in
[2:09:04] tongues and miss the Rapture you could
[2:09:06] feed the poor and miss the Rapture you
[2:09:08] could give the body to be burned and
[2:09:10] miss the Rapture Hallelujah but you must
[2:09:12] have charity Dynamics the token the life
[2:09:16] seven thundering voices Christ in you
[2:09:18] the hope of glory to make it to the
[2:09:20] rapture
[2:09:22] conventions will not place you in the
[2:09:24] Rapture believe in the right Doctrine
[2:09:27] will not bring you to the Rapture amen
[2:09:29] thank you Lord It's that life hallelujah
[2:09:33] it's
[2:09:34] humility it's that Thunder that shakes
[2:09:37] the
[2:09:38] devil friends don't let us lose the
[2:09:42] focus of why we are in the house of God
[2:09:44] this morning we in the the purpose of
[2:09:48] why we are here is to get our lives
[2:09:50] right with God it's no good to just come
[2:09:53] to church and and feel good and be
[2:09:55] encouraged and we did the encouraging
[2:09:57] part you're going to make it you know
[2:09:59] that but there's something you must do
[2:10:02] you must live a certain way we have
[2:10:05] become too relaxed we have become too
[2:10:08] complacent we have taken things lightly
[2:10:11] Hallelujah we have lost our
[2:10:13] sincerity we have lost the
[2:10:16] burden to be holy go ahead the standard
[2:10:20] has never been dropped it's still the
[2:10:23] same standard be ye holy because I am
[2:10:27] Holy it's still the
[2:10:30] [Applause]
[2:10:33] standard the standard is still Thou
[2:10:35] shalt have no other gods before me
[2:10:38] that's still the
[2:10:39] [Applause]
[2:10:42] standard the standard has not changed
[2:10:45] and God will not lower the standard we
[2:10:48] have to come up to his standard amen I
[2:10:51] don't care how bad the world I don't
[2:10:53] care what your boss says or what
[2:10:54] everybody else is doing in University it
[2:10:56] does not matter the standard is still
[2:10:59] the standard because everything that can
[2:11:02] be shaken will be shaken and only the
[2:11:05] standard will
[2:11:07] remain hallelujah
[2:11:10] hallelujah I know this is a part of the
[2:11:12] message everybody loves the shouting
[2:11:14] part everybody loves to see the standard
[2:11:18] take you out of the
[2:11:19] flood now I'm going beyond the flood you
[2:11:21] out to the flood now amen amen but you
[2:11:25] have a
[2:11:26] destination and for that destination
[2:11:28] there is a requirement and God will not
[2:11:30] change your requirement if you have to
[2:11:32] travel you need a passport if you need
[2:11:34] to go to the US you need a visa God is
[2:11:37] not going to change your requirement

[2:11:41] have to have your passport you have to
[2:11:43] have your Visa stamp with I am in The
[2:11:45] Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says
[2:11:48] by one Spirit you are baptized into the
[2:11:51] body has nothing to do with who your
[2:11:53] pastor is what church you go to that's
[2:11:56] foolishness
[2:11:58] Hall have you received the Holy Ghost
[2:12:01] since you believe uh it's been the theme
[2:12:04] of every Apostle since the day of
[2:12:06] Pentecost and it's still the message
[2:12:08] today we need the spirit we need the
[2:12:12] Holy Ghost we need the baptism of fire
[2:12:15] to take the evil
[2:12:18] [Applause]
[2:12:19] out h
[2:12:21] Hallelujah you may be seated that's the
[2:12:24] only
[2:12:26] way your money will fail you your body
[2:12:29] will fail you your mind will fail you
[2:12:32] but this Holy Ghost will never
[2:12:34] fail will never
[2:12:37] fail oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:41] hallelujah oh I don't know why I'm here
[2:12:43] this morning but we are here this
[2:12:46] morning we are in the world this morning
[2:12:49] we are in somewhere this morning I
[2:12:52] know young people it pains me amen it
[2:12:57] pains me with how much we have now that
[2:13:02] those who went before us didn't have
[2:13:04] there was a time when the spok would
[2:13:07] books would come and it would be a rush
[2:13:10] to not only get it but a waiting list to
[2:13:13] read it because it was food for the
[2:13:16] soul that was before technology now the
[2:13:20] message is on the internet the messages
[2:13:22] on apps on your phone and people don't
[2:13:25] even want to read it
[2:13:28] right there was a time Bibles were not
[2:13:31] allowed to be in your houses that's why
[2:13:34] Martin Luther found the Bible chained up
[2:13:37] in the Catholic church and he found the
[2:13:39] scripture that josa live by feet he
[2:13:41] didn't find it in his house because they
[2:13:43] had taken the Bibles off the street now
[2:13:46] we have Bibles in our homes we have
[2:13:48] Bible on our phones we have Bible on our
[2:13:50] iPads and people don't want to read it
[2:13:53] and God told Joshua meditate on the word
[2:13:55] day and night so you have good success
[2:13:58] what's wrong with us what Rapture are
[2:14:00] you going to if you don't read your
[2:14:02] Bible what kind of Christian are you if
[2:14:05] you are not even serious about making
[2:14:08] your calling an election sure God help
[2:14:15] us when the enemy comes in like a flood
[2:14:18] this morning I'm dealing with a flood of
[2:14:20] formality am the flood of being lukewarm
[2:14:23] the flood of being complacent the flood
[2:14:26] of being lazy the flood of being
[2:14:29] ungrateful second Timothy 3 Spirit heav
[2:14:32] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[2:14:35] lovers of
[2:14:38] God we make time to do what we want to
[2:14:41] do but call a prayer meeting and you
[2:14:44] can't find the church that's the flood
[2:14:47] that we are dealing with this morning
[2:14:49] but when the enemy comes like a flood
[2:14:52] the spirit would raise a
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:15:02] standard I want to see some of you show
[2:15:04] your job to the angel when he ask to see
[2:15:08] the
[2:15:09] token look my job look how much hours I
[2:15:12] have in I work so much over time this is
[2:15:16] what will take me to the Rapture are you

[2:15:28] the end there's an end there a your job
[2:15:31] is not the
[2:15:34] destination hallelujah hallelujah when
[2:15:36] the cealing angel moved through Egypt
[2:15:38] and went from house to house all he was
[2:15:41] looking for was blood Hallelujah he
[2:15:44] didn't want to hear talk explanation

[2:15:50] pass by this
[2:15:53] house said I'll pass through Egypt this
[2:15:55] night Hallelujah and smile all the

[2:16:05] house Hallelujah have you apply the
[2:16:07] blood in your life oh are you so lazy
[2:16:09] about applying blood you now have so
[2:16:11] much time to do foolishness you find
[2:16:13] yourself living in sin because if you
[2:16:15] are busy doing God's business you don't
[2:16:17] have time oh you don't hear me this
[2:16:19] morning
[2:16:22] make yourself busy about the business of
[2:16:25] God and see God bless you see God make
[2:16:28] you prosper see God open doors for
[2:16:32] [Applause]
[2:16:37] you yes there is a flood there's a flood
[2:16:40] in our
[2:16:42] marriages there's something very wrong
[2:16:45] in the
[2:16:46] message very wrong in the message when
[2:16:49] people when we have just as much
[2:16:51] separation in marriage as in the world
[2:16:54] it may not be visible
[2:16:56] [Music]
[2:16:58] separation but there's no love in the
[2:17:00] house amen there's something very wrong
[2:17:03] in the message when brother brandham
[2:17:05] labored and Paul labored and irenius
[2:17:08] labored and Martin labored and Columba
[2:17:11] labored to bring a message to us for us
[2:17:15] not to be different from the world we
[2:17:18] read the quote we ought to be different
[2:17:21] we ought to do better because we have
[2:17:23] been given much and to who much is given
[2:17:26] much is expected if we spend more time
[2:17:29] praying and seeing seeking the will of
[2:17:31] God we'd have less problems with our
[2:17:34] children less problems with our
[2:17:36] marriages less problems with the person
[2:17:38] next to us behind us in front of us but
[2:17:41] when the enemy comes like a flood the
[2:17:44] spirit would raise a
[2:17:46] [Applause]

[2:17:54] hallelujah hallelujah no Revival prise
[2:17:57] God no breakthrough could come without
[2:18:00] sacrifice look through history every

[2:18:13] but if you dig the valley cu the rain is
[2:18:15] coming the more you dig the more

[2:21:41] that says you should cover your knees
[2:21:42] it's the same standard that says don't
[2:21:44] listen to worldly music it's the same
[2:21:46] standard that says pray every day it's
[2:21:49] the same standard that says read every
[2:21:51] day is the same standard that says to
[2:21:56] forgive it's the same standard that says
