[26:36] tonight we
[26:37] pray a blessed interpreter to our hearts
[26:39] and confirm it with signs
[26:41] wonders and miracles we ask in jesus
[26:43] name
[26:44] amen and amen you have a prayer request
[26:46] we'll take after the service
[26:47] but at this time we want to turn your
[26:49] bibles to matthew 19.
[26:52] of verse 16 to 22. saint john chapter 5
[26:56] verse 36 to 40
[26:57] and sin john chapter 10 verse 23 to 27.
[27:02] i want to read three portion scriptures
[27:03] tonight matthew 19
[27:06] reading from verse 16 and behold one
[27:09] came and said unto him good master what
[27:11] good thing shall i do that i
[27:13] may have eternal life he said unto him
[27:16] why call his daughter good
[27:18] there is none good but one that is god
[27:20] and if thou will
[27:21] enter into life keep the commandments he
[27:24] said unto him which
[27:25] jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou
[27:28] shalt not come with adultery thou shalt
[27:30] not steal
[27:31] thou shalt not be a false witness honour
[27:33] thy father and thy mother
[27:35] and thou shall love thy neighbor as
[27:36] thyself and the young man said unto him
[27:39] all these things have i kept from my
[27:41] youth
[27:42] up what like i yet and jesus said unto
[27:45] him
[27:46] if thou will be perfect
[27:50] go and sell that thou hast and give to
[27:53] the poor
[27:54] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[27:57] and come
[27:58] and follow me and when the young man
[28:01] heard that
[28:02] sin he went away sorrowful for he had
[28:05] great possessions reading from sin john
[28:08] 5
[28:09] i want to read from verse 36 this is
[28:12] jesus speaking
[28:14] but i have greater witness that of john
[28:17] for the works
[28:18] which the father had given me
[28:21] to finish the same works that i do
[28:25] be a witness of me that the father had
[28:27] sent me
[28:29] and the father himself which had sent me
[28:31] had borne witness of me
[28:33] you have neither heard his voice at any
[28:35] time nor seen his sheep
[28:37] and ye have not his word abiding in you
[28:41] for whom he had sent him
[28:45] you believe not search the scriptures
[28:49] for in them you think ye have it in a
[28:52] life
[28:53] but they are they which testify of me
[28:56] and you will not come to me that you
[28:58] might have
[28:59] life our last scripture is something
[29:02] john 10
[29:04] and we want to read from verse 23
[29:09] and jesus walked in the temple in
[29:11] solomon's porch
[29:13] then came the jews are wrong about him
[29:15] and said unto him
[29:16] how long does thou make us to doubt how
[29:19] long he'll keep us in suspense
[29:21] if thou be christ tell us plainly
[29:24] and jesus answered them i told you
[29:28] and you believe not the works that i
[29:31] do in my father's name db would they be
[29:35] a witness
[29:36] of me but ye believe not because
[29:41] you are not of my sheep as i said unto
[29:44] you
[29:46] my sheep hear my voice
[29:50] and i know them and they follow me
[29:54] may god bless this world you may be
[29:55] seated oh blessed be the name of the
[29:58] lord
[29:59] jesus told them direct he said you are
[30:01] not my sheep
[30:03] i know who is a shepherd but you are not
[30:05] my sheep
[30:06] hallelujah because my sheep hear my
[30:10] voice
[30:11] and they i know them and they follow me
[30:15] oh glory to god my sheep my sheep
[30:19] hear my voice and the voice of god is a
[30:22] thunder so my sheep hear my voice
[30:27] and i know them and they follow me
[30:31] so i have a title tonight the true
[30:34] believers
[30:35] follow the life wherever the life goes
[30:40] that's a direct quote and that's what i
[30:42] use in our title i think i mention it
[30:43] on sunday but that's a direct quote the
[30:45] true believers
[30:47] follow the life wherever
[30:50] the life goes that is what the following
[30:54] oh glory
[30:55] the life now i don't believe that god
[30:58] sent a lasting message
[31:00] for us to be right in this spirit and
[31:02] wrong in doctrine
[31:04] i don't believe that it's good to be
[31:06] right in spirit that's what we want
[31:08] and that's what we should be when you're
[31:10] wrong in spirit that's cuckoo
[31:12] it doesn't matter what you teach what
[31:13] you preach what you say what you believe
[31:15] your spirit off but you want to be right
[31:18] in spirit
[31:19] and write in doctrine okay
[31:22] so you ready tonight all right saint
[31:25] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[31:29] the word was with god and the word was
[31:31] god
[31:32] the same was in the beginning with god
[31:35] this is logos and elohim right
[31:37] all things were made by him and without
[31:39] him was not anything
[31:40] me that was made in him was life
[31:44] and the life was the light of men oh
[31:47] glory to god where the life was in him
[31:50] and that's why jesus told them direct
[31:52] you wouldn't come to me
[31:53] that you might have life oh glory to god
[31:56] so he's one man
[31:57] i am the way the truth and the life
[32:01] oh glory to god so the pharisees can get
[32:03] light the sadducees can't give life
[32:06] but he could give life because he is the
[32:09] life itself
[32:11] do you believe that tonight oh glory to
[32:13] god thank you lord
[32:14] praise god so the prophet was saying
[32:17] here
[32:17] in the day when the son of man will be
[32:19] revealed what
[32:20] to join the church to the head
[32:24] unite the marriage of the bride the
[32:26] bridegroom
[32:27] call will come through this when the son
[32:30] of man
[32:31] will come down in human flesh to unite
[32:34] the two together the church here we go
[32:38] has to be the word because he is the
[32:41] word
[32:42] and the two unites together
[32:45] and to do that to bring this united
[32:49] it will take the manifestation of the
[32:52] revealing
[32:53] of the son of man so the son of man has
[32:56] been revealed
[32:57] but it will take the manifestation of
[33:00] the revealing
[33:01] of the son of man not the clergyman is
[33:04] the son of man
[33:06] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god it
[33:09] will take a manifestation
[33:11] of the revealing of the son of man all
[33:14] glory to god so what he is saying
[33:16] there's a time of the revelation of
[33:18] these things being made known
[33:20] that's in the seals but there comes an
[33:22] hour when there will be a manifestation
[33:24] of what has been revealed and we are
[33:27] moving into that hour now
[33:29] where we are actually walking in the
[33:30] vision of the prophecy itself
[33:33] we're not prophesying you're walking
[33:34] into the vision of what
[33:36] para manham saw by vision oh praise the
[33:39] name of the lord praise god do you
[33:40] believe that
[33:42] notice at in the pentecostal age to the
[33:44] literary age
[33:45] to the western age uh it'll be the same
[33:47] thing to this pentecostal age

[34:58] held back
[34:59] every mystery was revealed that we could
[35:02] make it to the rapture

[35:29] believe that
[35:30] hallelujah let's say that again at the
[35:32] opening of the seven seals
[35:34] revelation 10. remember what he said the
[35:37] breaking of the seventh seal is found in
[35:39] revelation 10.
[35:40] to find out what that silence is about
[35:42] you had to go to revelation 10.
[35:44] to find out what the devil don't know
[35:45] you have to go to revelation 10.
[35:47] oh hallelujah so he said no what the
[35:50] full word
[35:51] is to be born into manifestation again
[35:54] and vindicated by the
[35:58] spirit of god in the full strength
[36:01] as it was here on earth
[36:06] full strength oh it wasn't half a son of
[36:09] man and it was decent man
[36:11] come back to reveal himself so what went
[36:13] out from the prophet's mouth
[36:14] wasn't that man trying something and
[36:16] given an exhortation
[36:18] it was christ what are you talking about
[36:21] first thessalonians 4 the lord
[36:24] himself is what descended
[36:28] to speak through this lasting messenger
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:32] that is not with confidence he could say
[36:34] say what the tapes say
[36:36] because it wasn't me saying it it wasn't
[36:38] he that was saying it
[36:40] it was god saying it there are certain
[36:42] things i can't say it better
[36:46] because it's just the word oh glory to
[36:48] god do you believe that
[36:50] all right now watch the word isn't us
[36:53] the world is in the summer condition
[36:55] the church was went into sodom like lot
[36:57] and his wife
[36:58] and i see there's a elected church
[37:01] somewhere in this world
[37:02] that is pulling out and set aside those
[37:04] things and the manifestation of god
[37:07] has attracted its attention within the
[37:10] last days
[37:11] it will take the manifestation of god to
[37:14] attract its attention
[37:15] what he said the bride had no revival as
[37:17] yet there have been no manifestation of
[37:19] god to steal the pride
[37:21] why am i so excited why suppose because
[37:23] i know this is promise
[37:25] or who who feels have it already like
[37:27] them is has any devil come to test that
[37:30] is when these storms come to test that
[37:32] it's because you see
[37:33] everything you build have to be tested
[37:34] you know if you just said come we could
[37:36] we could
[37:37] wear flag put flag shout ball say we are
[37:40] it and everything else but when the
[37:42] tests come we'll show what what was
[37:43] already built
[37:44] what do you believe that this is
[37:46] beautiful he said watch
[37:48] the shock has give fought its strength
[37:50] unto the seed
[37:51] it went on out it was a good shock but
[37:54] it served its time
[37:56] see it is the word bride of the word
[37:59] groom
[38:00] so when shock time is over shock time
[38:01] over you shall and protect the bride for
[38:04] for many many years and the shock pulled
[38:06] back the shock just pull away
[38:08] that the bride get room to get right man
[38:10] mature
[38:12] and the hot july sun trials and
[38:14] tribulation
[38:16] to ripen you out it's not just a test
[38:18] you're ripening your faith inside of you
[38:21] and when god strip you on the heat start
[38:22] to take you and the greenness had to get
[38:25] baked out then you finally see if you
[38:26] still believe the word
[38:28] devil tree don't get back up you still
[38:29] believe the word this happened that you
[38:31] still believe the word
[38:33] oh glory to god you believe that word
[38:35] you have a perfect faith in what god
[38:37] said
[38:38] hallelujah know the devil no he can't
[38:39] move you off at that because you see the
[38:41] devil lose fallen angels
[38:43] to try to get the right off the word
[38:45] because once you're off the word you are
[38:47] entitled to
[38:48] enticing spirits you hear what i said
[38:53] once a man a church anybody going off
[38:55] the word
[38:56] lion spirits enticing spirits
[38:59] fallen angels backing that man and
[39:01] church up yes
[39:07] now i'm not talking about devil in party
[39:10] i'm not talking about devil outside
[39:12] beaten pan and carnival i'm not talking
[39:14] about that kind of level
[39:16] i took my one thought in the bible
[39:19] i don't know the one with the long dress
[39:23] i talked about the one who said they
[39:24] believe this message that is ever
[39:25] talking about
[39:30] people are saying they love but
[39:31] abandonment all that in love will be
[39:32] with him and whatnot
[39:34] don't buy that you know do you say they
[39:37] love me keep my commandments
[39:39] you don't feel your love but i love the
[39:41] message everyone says nice zero and
[39:42] you're making it because you love the
[39:43] message you're loving messenger
[39:45] it's not that tender he said hear me but
[39:47] i'm tabernacle
[39:48] you have to apply the token he's not to
[39:50] talk about it talking
[39:51] he said he talked not to be displayed
[39:53] does not talk to him
[39:55] there's a real thing there's a live
[39:57] thing there is an appliancing
[39:59] let's continue wow wow wow wow
[40:02] oh glory to god
[40:08] when they come and say go up and you
[40:11] have to say
[40:12] and um joseph i'd say isn't there one
[40:14] more
[40:15] this year we have my car but he always
[40:17] talking against us
[40:18] we can't handle them at all and when
[40:21] mike
[40:21] says six say something good tell me
[40:24] i'll see i will see what god put in my
[40:26] mouth
[40:28] but the whole minister's association
[40:30] saying the same thing like them
[40:32] i go and pray and find out what god tell
[40:33] me well you know where is bishop
[40:36] saying and on a certain channel
[40:40] i go hear what god tell me
[40:43] when he started giving me what he said
[40:44] going up he said but i see israel
[40:46] scattered like sheep
[40:48] you see that district prospector walked
[40:50] out and smacked him in the mouth
[40:51] and said where where where the word of
[40:53] god where the spirit go when he when he
[40:54] went over to me
[40:56] watch the arrogance i have ministry all
[40:59] these years
[41:00] wait wait go tell me but he's praying
[41:03] live long time
[41:06] because once it have prophetic utterance
[41:08] every
[41:09] ministry have to subject itself to that
[41:12] so no man can be above the prophet he's
[41:15] an
[41:15] intellectual idiot if you think he above
[41:17] the prophet
[41:18] when the prophet is a star in the right
[41:21] hand of god
[41:22] so every minister every ministry have to
[41:25] subject himself to the prophetic
[41:27] utterance
[41:28] that came out of the mouth of that
[41:29] elijah prophet william marian rana
[41:32] so we could judge every minister by that
[41:34] word
[41:38] let a man move try every spirit
[41:42] we have the authority to do that no man
[41:45] is above the word
[41:47] man is any absolute
[41:54] you know much man playing god
[41:59] my lord
[42:02] uh thank my clients for saying this to
[42:04] me he said god never did
[42:06] any time have a group of men to run his
[42:09] church
[42:10] it has always been the holy spirit
[42:14] that's his duty that's what he's here
[42:16] for
[42:17] that's what god sent him for unlike the
[42:20] other day but as i say people who want
[42:21] to criticize and whatnot
[42:22] they don't have to watch this they don't
[42:23] have to view us they don't have to take
[42:25] us on this is our suffering church
[42:26] we preach and we feel led we don't
[42:28] preach as people feel
[42:30] we're not preaching for others we're
[42:31] preaching here
[42:33] to help you because this is what i am
[42:35] responsible for
[42:36] and the ministry he is responsible for
[42:38] oh glory to god i have no international
[42:40] right to hold up and build
[42:42] no no god give me now you know who have
[42:44] that god bless them
[42:46] but i have to account for this group
[42:48] here and that's why preaching too
[42:51] that i could push to the kingdom because
[42:53] of a word when the power of this church
[42:55] rises
[42:56] i have to anoint that i have to believe
[42:59] that
[42:59] i have to claim that if they have cancer
[43:02] i'd have q minor what kind of thing
[43:03] among us and that blindness that
[43:04] kind of thing i have to i have to claim
[43:06] those things because i don't want doctor
[43:08] come on one doctor jesus to come
[43:10] oh glory to god our church could be
[43:12] defeated with jesus christ walking in
[43:14] it what press effect in what press could
[43:17] affect a church
[43:18] he said there will be a church with
[43:19] jesus walking here
[43:21] the shout of the king will be in the
[43:23] camp
[43:24] that is dusty at the lord that that dear
[43:27] fail
[43:30] nobody could cancel that rome itself
[43:33] two hundred thousand dozen devils can't

[43:40] and jesus christ will be walking in
[43:42] it the shout of the king
[43:45] will be in the camp that's a direct
[43:47] dossier the lord
[43:48] prophecy that cannot fail
[43:53] i feel inspired tonight oh god let me
[43:56] say it again if you can get it good
[43:58] there will be a church but jesus walking
[44:01] in it
[44:02] the shout of the king
[44:06] will be in the camp hopefully that
[44:09] church gonna be defeated think about it

[44:22] i run in the show we will get lick up
[44:25] we will get pressed out yes if i am in
[44:28] charge
[44:29] but if jesus the head the cap
[44:34] the lord himself god take the prophet he
[44:37] ain't take the lord himself fellow
[44:39] he didn't take that mighty angel you
[44:40] know the one with the seventh seal
[44:42] the one with his he ain't gone back in
[44:44] him he said the angel of the lord is
[44:46] unearthed now
[44:48] right now tonight fixing things are
[44:51] wrong
[44:52] for the coming of the lord and the
[44:54] seventh seal is connected
[44:55] the seven thunders is connected to the
[44:58] coming of the lord
[44:59] so he is here tonight he is fixing
[45:02] tonight
[45:03] oh glory to god he has to be here to fix
[45:05] things are wrong
[45:06] i can't fix it he has to fix it it is
[45:09] his church
[45:09] upon this rock i will build or give the
[45:12] lord a shout tonight
[45:19] [Music]
[45:20] upon this rock
[45:23] not to yoga bill until god says jesus i
[45:26] will build
[45:27] my church and the gates of hell
[45:30] including 200
[45:31] thousand can't prevail against it i had
[45:34] to include them because they must bond
[45:35] at the river euphrates
[45:37] they must tying up people all along they
[45:39] banged the holy ghost for two thousand
[45:40] years
[45:41] nice and feast of the trumpets but the
[45:43] evening time message
[45:44] is to lose the holy ghost somebody shall
[45:47] god lose
[45:48] the devil loses demons and god going to
[45:50] lose the holy ghost
[45:52] because when the enemy come in like a
[45:53] flood the spirit of god with a standard
[45:56] oh god you got to miss tired tonight
[45:58] oh hallelujah glory to god when the
[46:02] enemy coming like a flag
[46:05] spirit raises the standard you've always
[46:08] been the holy spirit
[46:09] that's his duty that's what he's here
[46:12] for
[46:12] that's what god sent him for he will
[46:15] teach you he will guide you into all
[46:16] truth
[46:17] i will show you things to come and
[46:19] reveal these things take things of minds
[46:20] and reveal it to you
[46:22] not seminary as he said but the holy
[46:24] spirit
[46:25] that's the teacher but we try to adapt
[46:28] man to take the holy spirit place
[46:30] we try to adopt sitting offices in the
[46:33] church
[46:34] to take the offices of apostle and
[46:36] prophet and so forth
[46:38] but god set the gifts in the church but
[46:41] we took
[46:41] men and made them gifts
[46:46] oh so there's a fightful in the body and
[46:49] a fightful out to the body
[46:51] the fightful out of the body is what
[46:53] people pick and make them gifts
[46:55] but when god said what god said
[46:58] no man could unsaid no man can't cancel
[47:01] i can't be fifo today and no for
[47:03] tomorrow that's his foolishness
[47:05] what god blesses bless what god curses
[47:08] curse what god says shock and shock what
[47:11] god says see the seed
[47:13] oh give the lord i shout tonight oh
[47:17] hallelujah hallelujah remember the bride
[47:19] goddess of all the life
[47:25] everything dries up you know whoa
[47:29] oh glory to god you know obama said
[47:32] there'd be no love left except among the
[47:33] elect
[47:35] you feel like you're buying chicken and
[47:36] chips and sandwich and sharing it out
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] so people take men and made them gifts
[47:46] so all they could talk about the pasta
[47:48] and the pasta years ago god showed me
[47:51] that adoption have nothing with the
[47:53] people that's
[47:54] years ago donkey years ago that's why i
[47:57] do bother with the people
[47:59] adoption is strictly father and son
[48:02] so you can have 50 million people inside
[48:04] the church fifty thousand people into
[48:06] that is not gonna make the man adopted
[48:08] the man make the most perfect sermon
[48:10] that is not adoption
[48:11] adoption has to do with behavior
[48:17] it has to do with life life behavior
[48:21] oh hallelujah do you believe that
[48:23] tonight thank you lord thank you lord
[48:25] let's continue
[48:27] lucy wow so when
[48:31] when any man say where the spirit go you
[48:34] see you know what god said
[48:35] he let the devil go down and get among
[48:36] them yeah why because they were off the
[48:39] wood to begin with
[48:42] so wait a minute when somebody off the
[48:43] word there was a drop on them
[48:45] yes because they're off the word that's
[48:47] why under under under loose ends is
[48:50] spirits
[48:52] you have to want your life to conform
[48:53] with the full world
[48:56] because it's united unbelief with the
[48:58] full word of god is only in this message
[49:00] you'll come and do that because this
[49:02] message is the full word
[49:03] when you put your own belief in it are
[49:04] you ready trouble you know is a big
[49:06] demon coming and jumping up there
[49:08] it has to be a hundred percent word
[49:11] oh glory to god praise god praise god
[49:14] let's continue
[49:15] the more he said the two spirits working
[49:17] among alike
[49:18] right down through here one is the
[49:20] nomination the other one is the holy
[49:22] ghost
[49:23] you see denominational spirit is man's
[49:26] spirit
[49:27] with denominational spirit it binds the
[49:29] holy ghost
[49:30] it arrests the holy ghost the holy ghost
[49:33] can't move in that
[49:34] because the cabbage done on a doctrine
[49:36] teaching an idea
[49:37] so it banished and lock off the holy
[49:40] ghost now what the prophet said
[49:41] he said the seven angels come from
[49:42] eternity to gather the scattered word
[49:44] to tie back in the word to bring down
[49:46] the holy ghost
[49:50] so when the word becomes the conductor
[49:52] of the spirit
[49:53] is because everything lined up just
[49:54] right so god laid the planks and the
[49:56] pipes are the word to be the conductor
[49:58] of the spirit
[49:59] no longer just flesh but the word made
[50:01] flesh
[50:02] so the man himself become a conductor
[50:07] so when a man become a doctor the sermon
[50:09] itself is affected by the man
[50:15] and what he want to say dear
[50:18] is my spirit
[50:22] flowing freely because now we find a
[50:25] perfect conductor
[50:27] for the spirit to flow or give the lord
[50:29] a shout
[50:30] you will live to see that
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:34] let me say it again you would live to
[50:36] see that
[50:38] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[50:42] eve the reason
[50:45] like eve if stopped long enough to be
[50:47] deceived if she hadn't stopped
[50:50] there never been no receiving but he
[50:51] stopped and when she stopped
[50:54] there is where she got her decision
[50:56] instead of pressing on
[50:57] follow me close now the reason that eve
[51:00] was deceived
[51:01] and barabana made them say it together
[51:04] these words
[51:05] he said the reason eve was deceived she
[51:08] never
[51:08] kept the full word of god satan
[51:12] quoted it to her but he never told her
[51:14] all the truth
[51:15] neither does his denomination see but
[51:17] she said long enough
[51:19] to get part of the word and didn't take
[51:21] all the word
[51:22] and that is what the matter today the
[51:24] sleeping virgin stayed long enough
[51:27] to get part of the word but not all the
[51:29] word
[51:30] the deceased church stayed long enough
[51:32] to get part but not all he said it
[51:34] knocks up your two tomb
[51:35] in his fullness so their full atonement
[51:38] wasn't applied to them
[51:40] which is the foolish version don't stay
[51:42] long enough to get part
[51:44] you want all oh glory to god
[51:47] all the word go hallelujah praise god
[51:51] hallelujah they received church says
[51:52] long enough to get part of the word
[51:54] but not all the word and they were
[51:56] sincere and honest about it
[51:58] and eve was deceived isn't that right
[52:01] hallelujah praise god thank you lord
[52:05] thank you lord jesus hallelujah oh amen
[52:08] and there's another quote concerning my
[52:11] cayenne they and this is the next angle
[52:12] that he brought to that the man come
[52:14] with big horns you're gonna
[52:15] push back the enemy and so on like that
[52:17] and then my car went
[52:18] he said i want to ask you something
[52:20] which way did the spirit of god go when
[52:21] it went down to me
[52:24] when he man said when i come back i'll
[52:25] take care you say they come back at all
[52:27] god never spoke to me
[52:29] if you only come back go ahead and talk
[52:30] to me
[52:33] you say you will understand you'll
[52:35] understand when you're getting the cage
[52:36] out you under as a captive
[52:38] i seen god sitting on the throne he
[52:40] meant no listen

[55:54] prophets school train ministry
[55:55] and make them prophesy a lie it was a
[55:58] lion spirit
[55:59] working out the will of god oh thank you
[56:02] lord
[56:03] and byram they don't want to hear
[56:05] because they need darkness
[56:07] they want to follow a creed it has made
[56:10] them feel good
[56:12] i believe this you don't believe it
[56:16] that's something that they believe that
[56:17] you do have keep it
[56:20] but the true believer they're following
[56:23] the life
[56:25] wherever it goes oh hallelujah praise
[56:28] god
[56:29] there's nothing about myself let me
[56:31] continue
[56:33] disobedience that word disobedience
[56:36] failure or refusal to obey rules
[56:40] of someone in authority that would
[56:42] disobedience
[56:44] failure or refusal to obey rules
[56:47] of someone in authority disobedience is
[56:51] deliberately not doing
[56:54] what someone tells you to do or what the
[56:58] rule or law says you should do
[57:01] failure or refusal to obey rules or
[57:05] someone in authority
[57:06] that is what you call disobedience
[57:09] because you'll find out
[57:10] there's a spirit that work in the
[57:12] children
[57:14] of disobedience now notice
[57:18] something i wrote here this is not about
[57:20] believing now
[57:23] this is about following instructions
[57:27] if i tell you the red horse rider is he
[57:30] is he and the palos rider and the black
[57:32] horse rider that is
[57:33] information that is not instruction
[57:37] revealing the mystery of the sip and
[57:39] seed that can help you in your marriage
[57:42] that guy put nothing in the table right
[57:44] now that is information there's nothing
[57:46] to do with that
[57:48] but when the spirit come to give
[57:50] instructions
[57:52] which the spirit will come to you
[57:55] to try to guide you and lead you
[57:59] that is where you have to understand
[58:00] whether or not you are obeying the lord
[58:04] because in adoption he spoke about a
[58:06] good son and a troublesome one
[58:08] man doing what you want acting how we
[58:11] want
[58:12] he's a son but he's not coming into
[58:15] discipline
[58:17] he's not coming into order the other
[58:20] synonyms of disobedience
[58:22] is unruliness waywardness
[58:26] in discipline bad behavior
[58:29] misbehavior misconduct delinquency
[58:33] disruptiveness troublemaking
[58:37] rebellion defiance mutiny revolt
[58:40] lack of cooperation non-compliance
[58:44] awkwardness perversity contrariness
[58:47] mischievousness mischief ambitions
[58:53] i see that's the synonyms of this thing
[58:57] called
[58:58] disobedience and brahman said this now
[59:02] the two spirits one of them
[59:05] holy spirit the other one is the devil's
[59:08] spirit
[59:09] working in deception is that certainly
[59:13] where he's working you know
[59:14] working and how deception the people
[59:18] of the earth are now making their choice
[59:22] so you have to choose what mark you want
[59:24] because the end of the day is just two
[59:26] marks
[59:27] is that at least seven c you drop that
[59:28] mark on you for the rapture
[59:30] or you take some other seals and you're
[59:32] born for the tribulation
[59:34] you have to want that you have to know
[59:36] what you're going after
[59:38] oh glory to god the holy spirit is here
[59:41] calling out a bride
[59:42] for christ he is doing it by
[59:46] vindicating his word of promise to her
[59:48] showing it is christ
[59:50] the spirit if the finger is supposed to
[59:52] move in this age the finger will move
[59:55] if the foot is supposed to move in this
[59:56] edge the foot will move if the eye is to
[59:58] see same this is the i will
[1:00:00] see here we go listen to this word now
[1:00:02] the spirit of god
[1:00:05] as it grows into the full stature of god
[1:00:09] is the age we are now living in
[1:00:15] you hear that the spirit of god
[1:00:18] as it grows in the first stature of god
[1:00:20] for example only a prophet could have
[1:00:22] said this he said when you say you want
[1:00:24] to get closer to god
[1:00:26] what you're really seeing is you want to
[1:00:29] grow in god
[1:00:32] and when he reveal the statue of perfect
[1:00:34] man he show you
[1:00:35] i want to lord i want to get closer to
[1:00:36] you god give your faith
[1:00:39] i want to get closer to you lord he give
[1:00:40] a virtue
[1:00:42] you're getting closer
[1:00:45] until there is no more closer together
[1:00:48] when you see me you see
[1:00:51] the father and my father are one
[1:00:54] jesus prayed that one in us you are in
[1:00:56] you and you and me at that day
[1:00:58] so to get closer is to really grow
[1:01:01] hallelujah and what makes you grow
[1:01:04] trials testing tribulation
[1:01:06] and most of all time
[1:01:11] because time is what god unlocked for
[1:01:14] this thing called process
[1:01:18] and everybody looking very shortcut does
[1:01:20] the devil job
[1:01:21] to show you this shortcut by sharing
[1:01:23] something with isaac
[1:01:25] i said we were born in ignorance
[1:01:28] the world is ignorance knowledge
[1:01:31] is light but it could give you two
[1:01:34] different light
[1:01:35] yes the knowledge of good and evil
[1:01:39] so knowledge brings light because you're
[1:01:41] in ignorance
[1:01:42] that's why david said knowledge of good
[1:01:44] and evil
[1:01:45] god knows if you if you get this
[1:01:47] revelation here you'll be wise
[1:01:49] knowing good and evil like god now watch
[1:01:51] this here
[1:01:52] but the thing about it is that when you
[1:01:55] get placed on the road of knowledge you
[1:01:58] have to keep
[1:01:58] looking for the time you will take on to
[1:02:00] the tree of life
[1:02:02] because if you stick on knowledge alone
[1:02:04] it could guide you off
[1:02:05] plumb off because jesus said
[1:02:08] search the scriptures
[1:02:12] because they have the knowledge that
[1:02:14] have the prophecy
[1:02:15] that have the information search the
[1:02:17] tapes search the books
[1:02:19] in them you think you have life
[1:02:26] but you wouldn't come to me to get life
[1:02:30] so he was showing them having the books
[1:02:33] having the scrolls
[1:02:35] that was not enough
[1:02:40] here come the young ruler good master
[1:02:44] what shall i do to inherit it in her
[1:02:47] life
[1:02:48] he's taking my word he dropped the coats
[1:02:51] on him
[1:02:52] adultery
[1:02:56] he said are you doing this i i reading
[1:02:58] this message all the time
[1:03:00] i believe moses i believe the prophet of
[1:03:03] the earth
[1:03:04] hallelujah i i am this thing from a
[1:03:08] youth
[1:03:09] what luck i
[1:03:12] yet he had the books
[1:03:16] he had the tapes he's going to church
[1:03:19] he's a nice guy he's rich
[1:03:22] but when the word which is the reason of
[1:03:24] hebrews 4 12
[1:03:26] begin to go beyond the bone and the
[1:03:27] marrow and go past his flesh
[1:03:30] go past his his christian behavior go
[1:03:33] past his good self
[1:03:35] and see the demon in his soul hallelujah
[1:03:39] he says get rid of that you have to sell
[1:03:42] no you might be rich in money might be
[1:03:43] rich and lost
[1:03:45] you might be rich in pride there may be
[1:03:46] other things you might rich with
[1:03:48] but you have to sell you have a price to
[1:03:50] pay
[1:03:51] in order to get stripped of that demon
[1:03:54] that religious spirit upon your life
[1:03:56] some people have to repent of the
[1:03:57] religious spirit they have it so long in
[1:03:59] this message
[1:04:00] oh hell too long in this message that
[1:04:02] all they get is that there's a shell
[1:04:03] over their life
[1:04:04] you need to come real authentic original
[1:04:07] or something else to connect with a
[1:04:09] reality inside of you a
[1:04:10] manifested reality you have to want that
[1:04:14] you have to hunger for that you have to
[1:04:16] thirst for that stop putting on
[1:04:18] stop acting get real all glory to god
[1:04:21] you want
[1:04:22] life he said they wouldn't come to me
[1:04:25] that they might have life
[1:04:27] oh give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:04:31] hallelujah hallelujah search the
[1:04:34] scripture
[1:04:36] search the text or who he's talking to
[1:04:39] people in church a long time pharisees
[1:04:41] who study the word
[1:04:43] them fellas lioness is pure and clean
[1:04:45] and whatnot
[1:04:46] and he ripped them through and said
[1:04:48] listen what you have is not life
[1:04:50] yes one time when jesus talking to them
[1:04:53] and jesus busted me before the fathers
[1:04:54] was i am he saw a father man in the
[1:04:56] wilderness
[1:04:58] and jesus under everyone dead i am the
[1:05:02] living bread
[1:05:03] if a man eat of me shall not die oh
[1:05:07] hallelujah
[1:05:08] oh glory to god you say you have light
[1:05:11] when i come and you reject this light
[1:05:14] you walk in darkness
[1:05:16] every time that person's perfect has
[1:05:17] come that person's impact is done away
[1:05:19] written
[1:05:20] once perfection is identified and you're
[1:05:23] going to understand where the believers
[1:05:24] walk into and following
[1:05:26] why the believers will move that way
[1:05:28] when luther
[1:05:29] drop his trumpet to the roman empire and
[1:05:32] shook up rome with a justice league by
[1:05:33] faith what did the true believers do
[1:05:36] they followed the life justification was
[1:05:38] the doctrine
[1:05:39] but the life oh glory to god they were
[1:05:42] justified by faith
[1:05:44] that was the thunder the devil couldn't
[1:05:46] understand they were still drinking beer
[1:05:48] they were still smoking cigarettes but
[1:05:50] they were justified by god
[1:05:52] because they followed the life of
[1:05:55] luther's message
[1:05:56] he caught the word not fully revealed he
[1:05:58] went and blast
[1:06:00] oh hallelujah praise god the catholic
[1:06:02] church buster churches opened a rejected
[1:06:05] dunk on a plague
[1:06:06] a seal to open mystery unfold
[1:06:09] word drop down messenger catch the
[1:06:12] mission that fully revealed
[1:06:13] went and called the elect and the devil
[1:06:15] clueless because the elect was called
[1:06:17] out
[1:06:17] by justification oh hallelujah
[1:06:20] luther dropped back into the ground and
[1:06:22] them justified people
[1:06:24] formed the denomination they formed the
[1:06:26] lutheran and the life moving on
[1:06:28] into sanctification and all them
[1:06:31] justified people
[1:06:32] it was good when luther was there it was
[1:06:34] good when that hour was there
[1:06:35] but when wesley come nothing could know
[1:06:37] more you need more than that
[1:06:40] or give the lord a shout we need more
[1:06:42] than we had 20 years ago
[1:06:44] in this message we need more than that
[1:06:46] to deal with what is
[1:06:47] and what is to come i hear shout tonight
[1:06:51] i am fighting for my life because i know
[1:06:54] where it's coming time i come i fight
[1:07:04] i can't do like his business as usual i
[1:07:07] can't do like
[1:07:08] oh it was a long time it's not come back
[1:07:10] a long time
[1:07:12] oh hallelujah believers what they're
[1:07:14] doing they're following the life
[1:07:17] hallelujah my god
[1:07:20] he said the holy spirit is here
[1:07:22] vindicating the message of the hour
[1:07:24] and the whole spirit is doing this so
[1:07:26] that the people that believe god will be
[1:07:28] called to this chaos
[1:07:30] the devil's on holy spirit is
[1:07:33] here calling his church
[1:07:36] by the error as usual by a perversion of
[1:07:40] the word
[1:07:41] like he did at the beginning then he
[1:07:44] quote the scriptures in john 4 5.
[1:07:46] he talked about if you want to put it
[1:07:47] down the spirit of error
[1:07:50] so it's not just a text spirit you know
[1:07:53] a man saying a wrong texting
[1:07:55] or wrong information you know there's a
[1:07:57] spirit and error
[1:07:59] behind the teaching that the man is
[1:08:02] teaching off the word
[1:08:04] that's what's wrong with barely kind i
[1:08:05] forgive you there's a spirit of
[1:08:07] forgiveness
[1:08:09] it's not what you do it's how you do it
[1:08:12] that rich young ruler he did
[1:08:13] all the commandments but it's what was
[1:08:16] in him
[1:08:20] you guessing that tonight you see what
[1:08:22] god sees
[1:08:23] you see how god tells samuel i don't see
[1:08:26] like you see
[1:08:27] when you're looking to anoint one of
[1:08:28] your sons jesse when samuel says surely
[1:08:31] this is he illya
[1:08:32] come forward they let us a jessie
[1:08:35] a handsome son firstborn
[1:08:38] god said no no don't look at that don't
[1:08:41] look under the outward appearance
[1:08:43] look what's in the heart and always get
[1:08:45] some designment
[1:08:47] so then when he passed he recognized he
[1:08:48] had to look for the witness of the
[1:08:50] spirit now
[1:08:51] them fellas they know like brother isaac
[1:08:53] says
[1:08:54] saul without his only choice was already
[1:08:57] chosen to be paul
[1:08:59] with all his consent
[1:09:03] to be a messenger of the age and he's
[1:09:06] fighting on the christians
[1:09:08] but that name up there catching china
[1:09:10] that name was put there before the
[1:09:11] foundation
[1:09:12] your name can't change behave yourself
[1:09:15] oh glory to god gone and given up you
[1:09:17] god put your name on that book behave
[1:09:18] yourself
[1:09:21] come on your foolishness come into
[1:09:23] christ
[1:09:24] come into life you could do it yes you
[1:09:27] can
[1:09:28] yes you can yes you can
[1:09:31] you could really make it
[1:09:39] god had put us in this last year to be
[1:09:40] weak backstage you know
[1:09:42] striving on your existing and yes i come
[1:09:46] that you might have life and have it
[1:09:50] more abundantly you have to see the more
[1:09:52] abundantly life
[1:09:53] you have lighter it's the cup run it
[1:09:55] over oh give the lord a shout my cup
[1:09:59] it runs over i'm not frustrated
[1:10:02] i'm not fed up oh god
[1:10:06] eve never simply walk out willfully and
[1:10:09] say i don't believe in god
[1:10:11] no it was an error she believed
[1:10:15] and you say when she believed the error
[1:10:17] he said instantly the life left her
[1:10:19] one two her connection with the husband
[1:10:22] got broken
[1:10:23] that break up relationship one time he
[1:10:25] said once in life leave the church
[1:10:27] the connection of the believers are
[1:10:29] broken
[1:10:31] believers who want to fellowship and
[1:10:32] shake hand and hug one another they stop
[1:10:33] that now
[1:10:34] they're passing and crossing on the
[1:10:35] street because i believe this you
[1:10:37] believe that
[1:10:39] life gone so that is backed up
[1:10:48] yeah when the whole entire doctrine is
[1:10:50] executive catholic i believe your
[1:10:52] possibly created the holy mary the
[1:10:53] mother of god
[1:10:54] i just said you know i was a catholic
[1:10:57] but there was something inside
[1:10:58] of me so when them thunders hit me so i
[1:11:00] just don't be right all the catholic
[1:11:01] church
[1:11:02] rome couldn't hold me whom couldn't keep
[1:11:05] me
[1:11:05] i was the first person in my family at
[1:11:07] 12 to step out
[1:11:09] i was 16 17 at the time mother
[1:11:12] father all the lay hands the praying
[1:11:14] that they shall play they believe in
[1:11:16] mary joseph everybody
[1:11:19] that couldn't stop because i was a seed
[1:11:22] in that house and when the time come
[1:11:25] time come
[1:11:26] god said time i'll call to you do you
[1:11:29] fly out of this
[1:11:31] oh glory to god when i get baptized and
[1:11:33] i tell them it was few years
[1:11:35] but i got baptized in jesus name oh
[1:11:38] glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:40] yeah so therefore
[1:11:44] because my parents were catholic i was
[1:11:45] in the catholic system
[1:11:47] but i was never catholic
[1:11:51] so you feel all them believers them true
[1:11:53] believers under those
[1:11:55] men in the message them go stay there
[1:11:57] all the time
[1:11:59] you hear what we titled the messages the
[1:12:01] true believers
[1:12:03] will follow the life wherever it goes
[1:12:13] so a lot of men who feel they have their
[1:12:14] church locked down with their doctrine
[1:12:16] and teaching
[1:12:17] they don't understand the only messing
[1:12:18] in the human instagram
[1:12:21] they cut that receded than people so
[1:12:25] years ago i used to talk about these men
[1:12:27] and the people and the many people and
[1:12:28] now in prayer the lord amen don't say
[1:12:30] that
[1:12:31] and after the lord spoke to me i never
[1:12:32] say it again he's because the lord told
[1:12:34] me
[1:12:34] these are my people these are these are
[1:12:36] the words under these men
[1:12:38] and my whole picture changed so i
[1:12:41] recognize it's not the man
[1:12:43] it's god's people some of them men can
[1:12:45] truly be any pulpit
[1:12:47] but the people is god's people
[1:12:50] and after a while the lord himself when
[1:12:53] he begin to move
[1:12:54] he will deal with those men behind the
[1:12:57] pulpit
[1:12:58] because his bride will not be
[1:13:02] manhandled are all will come
[1:13:06] where the jubilee trumpet will sound for
[1:13:08] the bride

[1:14:53] satan satan never come out and say oh
[1:14:55] well that's not even the word of god
[1:14:57] satan lindsay leave that he admitted it
[1:15:00] was the word of god
[1:15:01] but he put his own interpretation it
[1:15:03] which god pleaded to him not to do it
[1:15:05] what does this do it makes a strong
[1:15:07] delusion
[1:15:08] for the people to believe a lie
[1:15:11] hallelujah
[1:15:12] i just wonder why people just standing
[1:15:14] against me that kind of way so when i
[1:15:15] say tune
[1:15:16] i mean no no no no small turn you know
[1:15:20] i'm being told to fight you people that
[1:15:22] want to
[1:15:23] like yesterday love you but you see it
[1:15:24] happening bible you know
[1:15:26] jesus hosanna hosanna blessed is eden
[1:15:30] next we crucify him same bunch of people
[1:15:34] and that devil hit them so they will
[1:15:36] crucify
[1:15:39] this week they love them next week they
[1:15:42] hate them
[1:15:43] and they don't even know why a delusion
[1:15:47] a spirit there's more spirit going on
[1:15:50] and you think there's more spirit
[1:15:52] influences than you think
[1:15:54] we have been churchified too long
[1:15:58] like if we have an automatic guarantee
[1:15:59] because we believe malachi 4. that means
[1:16:01] what
[1:16:01] the devil and all believes
[1:16:05] i'm is going no rapture no resurrection
[1:16:09] so we got to do more than this
[1:16:13] wish the entire church was here tonight
[1:16:14] we have to do more than that
[1:16:20] the spirit of delusion is of the devil
[1:16:23] devils
[1:16:24] now working in the children of
[1:16:27] disobedient we're not talking about
[1:16:28] people that type in coke
[1:16:29] and smoking dope we're talking about
[1:16:31] church people
[1:16:34] children of disobedience in church
[1:16:37] in this message
[1:16:42] the spirit of delusion is of the devil
[1:16:43] there is no working internal
[1:16:44] disobedience disobedient to what
[1:16:46] what the turn of the distillability was
[1:16:48] to the true word of god
[1:16:50] and then he quote the scripture
[1:16:52] ephesians 2 wherein in time past you
[1:16:54] walked according to the course of this
[1:16:55] world
[1:16:56] according to the prince of the power of
[1:16:57] the ear the spirit
[1:16:59] that now worketh in the eternal
[1:17:01] disobedience
[1:17:02] churn of disobedience if the antichrist
[1:17:04] spirit begin in there in his infancy of
[1:17:05] disobedience what would it be when it
[1:17:07] heads up in the person of the antichrist
[1:17:09] oh my so but abraham said now remember
[1:17:12] christ
[1:17:13] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:17:15] the book of acts but the book of
[1:17:17] revelation
[1:17:17] shows that the antichrist spirit would
[1:17:19] come into the church
[1:17:23] it's a spirit that comes into the church
[1:17:27] it had to come by any purpose
[1:17:30] and go down to the people and hear the
[1:17:33] purpose of that
[1:17:35] making the church the church and the
[1:17:36] violet making it look warm
[1:17:39] formal and powerless
[1:17:42] what did jesus say denying the power
[1:17:44] thereof
[1:17:45] heavy high-minded church people prophecy
[1:17:48] spirit
[1:17:50] them coming to fight the computer one
[1:17:53] yeah this bright spirit of faith and
[1:17:54] virtual knowledge
[1:17:55] this is the christ spirit here and every
[1:17:58] other spirit had to fight that
[1:18:00] that's the battle in the last days that
[1:18:02] versus everything else
[1:18:04] hallelujah denying the power to change
[1:18:06] your life and walk
[1:18:08] but yet they can argue and debate
[1:18:10] concerning the texts
[1:18:12] don't get tapped in that system
[1:18:15] scriptures
[1:18:16] don't get tapped in that follow him
[1:18:20] take up your cross and he said follow me
[1:18:22] because it's he
[1:18:23] that have the life not some man have the
[1:18:26] life he have the life
[1:18:29] yeah adopted someone will have seen him
[1:18:32] anybody that's true that's when they
[1:18:33] adopted that is christ veiling a man
[1:18:36] none of the man trying something that is
[1:18:39] christ veiled
[1:18:40] like spiller fire veil dies for the last
[1:18:43] day too
[1:18:43] but does god have to do that and said
[1:18:46] this is my beloved son hear him
[1:18:48] when that happened that's a different
[1:18:49] thing then called needles could send for
[1:18:51] that man
[1:18:52] and while you speak the word the holy
[1:18:53] ghost take upon hold upon the words and
[1:18:55] and baptize communism for the holy ghost
[1:18:57] that too coming do you believe that
[1:19:01] because all of that is part of booker
[1:19:02] acts and if that branch put forth
[1:19:04] another original branch
[1:19:06] if you're write another book of acts
[1:19:10] alpha will become omega we have to write
[1:19:13] another book of acts and i see nowhere
[1:19:14] in the book of acts when people was
[1:19:16] churchi fighter dr pew tied onto some
[1:19:18] church
[1:19:19] no god was alive among the people
[1:19:22] everywhere when god was with them and
[1:19:23] the lord himself went
[1:19:25] everywhere with them confirming
[1:19:28] the word with signs and wonders and
[1:19:31] miracles
[1:19:32] and that is not pentecostal come on give
[1:19:35] the lord a shout
[1:19:36] that is sin mark 16 in action
[1:19:40] not in text
[1:19:44] not in talk not an explanation of
[1:19:47] breaking it down
[1:19:48] we don't need that to break down we need
[1:19:50] to see it in action
[1:19:52] oh give the lord a shout glory to god we
[1:19:56] don't need a man to come back and break
[1:19:57] this down
[1:19:59] the lord himself went everywhere with
[1:20:00] them confirming the word
[1:20:02] with signs oneness and miracle he was
[1:20:05] interested
[1:20:06] in confirming his word the man preached
[1:20:08] the word god confirmed the word it was
[1:20:09] the word of god god confirmed would sign
[1:20:11] one of the miracles
[1:20:12] may god conform his word tonight to you
[1:20:15] oh hallelujah i miss you i could wrap up
[1:20:17] here
[1:20:20] he knows the devil knows if the people
[1:20:23] i want to take a slow walk around this
[1:20:25] one because when they see you walk slow
[1:20:27] your sleep and do things
[1:20:28] if the people gets the true revelation
[1:20:32] let me take every time not revelation
[1:20:35] true
[1:20:36] true revelation of the true church
[1:20:40] and what she is what she stands for that
[1:20:43] she can do
[1:20:46] what the church is what she stand for
[1:20:48] and what she can do
[1:20:50] that she can do the greater works she
[1:20:51] will be an invincible army
[1:20:53] let's go deeper if they get a true
[1:20:55] revelation
[1:20:56] and there's a partner of the two spirits
[1:20:59] you see you can't follow
[1:21:01] if you don't know what you have to fight
[1:21:04] because if the wrong person come forward
[1:21:06] spirit wise
[1:21:07] and you follow that you're going off
[1:21:11] so therefore he said when they get the
[1:21:13] true
[1:21:14] true revelation of the two spirits
[1:21:16] working away
[1:21:17] in the framework of the christian church
[1:21:20] and by god's spirit that's important
[1:21:24] because have all kind of luciferian
[1:21:26] spirit dismantling too
[1:21:28] and could tell this and tell that and
[1:21:29] it's some hell it's not all these women
[1:21:31] really you know the spirits that know
[1:21:33] where they walk and talk however they go
[1:21:34] and come back and say well when they
[1:21:36] remember the bar and whatnot
[1:21:38] you know it's not god's spirit
[1:21:42] is lucy again
[1:21:46] is dancing jumpers anointing you know
[1:21:48] it's which doctors bear
[1:21:50] prisoner with spirit power you know
[1:21:55] you don't know i want to get into this
[1:21:56] thing i can't get anything like that
[1:21:58] that's a whole story by itself i don't
[1:21:59] want to go there yet
[1:22:00] are coming i'm coming are going down
[1:22:02] there months ago i wanted to get there
[1:22:05] yeah yeah religious praise message
[1:22:16] but you can't be taking unawares wait do
[1:22:19] you think johnson's
[1:22:20] intellectual freaks there was
[1:22:21] intellectual you know
[1:22:23] when moses dropped down that road
[1:22:24] pharaoh said john's jumping showed him
[1:22:27] there wasn't a dark art

[1:22:33] oh oh
[1:22:34] we believe this you know they were
[1:22:36] bringing manifestation
[1:22:39] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:22:41] what i'm saying you know you have to
[1:22:42] know what you're talking about
[1:22:43] when you go to them places in africa all
[1:22:45] about the places these heavy spirits
[1:22:47] one time barramundi some meetings and
[1:22:48] some rich doctor pelted some storm and
[1:22:52] it turned ripping off and the problem
[1:22:53] rebuked him
[1:22:54] and the storm going coming back and
[1:22:55] forth rebuke back and forth
[1:22:57] after obama's i bind you
[1:23:00] bind you strong man carry brook no story
[1:23:03] can be no storm no
[1:23:04] storm done i have no words to bring no
[1:23:07] storm
[1:23:08] hallelujah i'm talking about it you see
[1:23:10] men make
[1:23:11] a feathers right and and and and table
[1:23:13] float and all kinds of things
[1:23:15] they know imaginary power that's why you
[1:23:17] say you prefer to talk to which doctors
[1:23:33] but this texting belongs to my spirit
[1:23:36] realm
[1:23:38] that my jesus said you didn't come to me
[1:23:40] that you might have life
[1:23:41] you need you didn't want to text you
[1:23:44] better go be any text in
[1:23:46] he said by is there understanding any
[1:23:47] good spirit satan is powerless before
[1:23:49] her
[1:23:50] who he will definitely taught today and
[1:23:52] so on earth he says satan hates
[1:23:54] revelation
[1:23:54] but we love it with true revelation in
[1:23:56] our lives the github cannot prove
[1:23:58] against us
[1:23:58] but we reveal against them and we read
[1:24:01] this on sunday life
[1:24:02] system doesn't have life it's only god's
[1:24:05] word has life
[1:24:06] the systems are built around it it does
[1:24:09] not
[1:24:10] have life it is the word that gives life
[1:24:14] oh glory to god do you believe that then
[1:24:16] he said something have to come that
[1:24:17] cannot be denominated
[1:24:19] it's the entirety of the sea that's
[1:24:21] comfort
[1:24:22] oh glory to god the entirety of the life
[1:24:25] that endear
[1:24:26] has to produce itself again in the bride
[1:24:28] oh glory to god so let's just wrap it up
[1:24:30] here now
[1:24:31] this last great step he said now watch
[1:24:33] what came from jesus body water blood
[1:24:35] and spirit
[1:24:36] the elements that came from his body is
[1:24:38] what makes up his body
[1:24:41] hallelujah water blood
[1:24:45] spirit water blood
[1:24:49] spirit he said to make us bright because
[1:24:52] adam had his bride taken from his body
[1:24:54] christ has his bride taken from his body
[1:24:56] and when christ died there was three
[1:24:58] elements that came from his body
[1:24:59] water blood spirit justification to
[1:25:01] believe in water signification through
[1:25:03] the blood
[1:25:04] and then the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:25:06] then he dropped the bomb here he said
[1:25:07] now this
[1:25:08] last great step must come to perfection
[1:25:13] that the holy spirit has to live in that
[1:25:16] church so perfectly
[1:25:17] that will make the head and body unite
[1:25:18] together he ain't talking about no
[1:25:20] mysteries he ain't talking about no
[1:25:21] history he don't want no testimony he
[1:25:23] said the holy spirit has to live so
[1:25:25] perfectly
[1:25:26] nations come a place hallelujah
[1:25:29] glory to god amen he's a look at the
[1:25:32] four patriarchs
[1:25:33] isaac calling abraham election isaac
[1:25:36] calling jacob joseph perfection nothing
[1:25:38] against him
[1:25:39] abraham fate isaac love jacob grace
[1:25:43] joy perfection then he said what he said
[1:25:45] looter
[1:25:46] wesley pentecost then the capstone
[1:25:50] when the church and the word becomes the
[1:25:52] same oh hallelujah so then the believers
[1:25:56] that of the wesleyan church when the
[1:25:57] pentecostal broke they move on
[1:25:59] and they follow the life and when the
[1:26:02] life leave pentecost
[1:26:03] and come into this message by the
[1:26:04] prophet malachi 4 the elect of the
[1:26:06] pentecostal follow the life
[1:26:08] oh glory to god what life did brahma
[1:26:12] release
[1:26:12] it was the capstone life of jesus christ
[1:26:16] eventually perfection nothing against
[1:26:18] the bride
[1:26:19] nothing against you pregnant with that
[1:26:22] seed
[1:26:23] of jolly perfection it is god working
[1:26:26] his way out
[1:26:28] right under the nose of the devil god
[1:26:30] put a seed inside of you
[1:26:32] and that seed peeping his way out
[1:26:34] stretching his way out pushing his way
[1:26:35] out that's it will come out
[1:26:37] and bring a cap stone to a perfection
[1:26:39] bribe
[1:26:40] nothing against her justify that she
[1:26:43] never did in the first place
[1:26:44] you talk about faith you talk about a
[1:26:46] perfect fit for a perfect rapture
[1:26:48] oh hallelujah let's continue here
[1:26:52] notice the life that was in the stalk
[1:26:54] and tassel now ends up in the seed
[1:26:56] the life come true the original seed
[1:26:59] come to different processes
[1:27:01] then turns back to its original
[1:27:02] condition he said hallelujah i'm the
[1:27:04] happiest man in the world
[1:27:05] that god will let me see that notice the
[1:27:08] life that was in the husk
[1:27:09] in this talk in the tassel gathers up in
[1:27:12] the seed
[1:27:13] and the light that was in the stock one
[1:27:14] one went to make
[1:27:16] another justification made away for
[1:27:18] signification
[1:27:19] salvation made a way for the baptism of
[1:27:21] the holy ghost and the baptism of the
[1:27:23] holy ghost made a way
[1:27:24] for the holy ghost itself to come down
[1:27:27] imperfection and back to the word so
[1:27:30] once fire falls back
[1:27:32] today oh glory to god oh give the lord a
[1:27:35] shout
[1:27:37] let me just wrap up i'm the home stretch
[1:27:38] right here now stalk
[1:27:41] tassel pollen then husk then out of the
[1:27:43] horse come the original seed not a seed
[1:27:46] it was the life of the seed growing
[1:27:48] through this
[1:27:50] to come to seed oh so the word is really
[1:27:52] a hub
[1:27:54] a conduit a conductor of the very life
[1:27:57] the devil couldn't understand that
[1:27:59] because god was protecting the very life
[1:28:01] by the spirit of the lion spirit of the
[1:28:04] ox
[1:28:04] spirit of the man spirit of the eagle
[1:28:07] they were the guardians
[1:28:08] that was gardening life not the oil and
[1:28:11] the light unwind
[1:28:12] so when they killed the christians
[1:28:13] through the dark ages the devil didn't
[1:28:15] understand the seed
[1:28:16] was growing in the ground in the devil
[1:28:18] you understand that he was going to
[1:28:19] block this even going in the wrong
[1:28:21] he never let him go on any ground
[1:28:22] because he hit the ground have to spring
[1:28:24] back up
[1:28:25] oh glory to god because the law of god
[1:28:28] hit the ground come back up
[1:28:30] and when god said i will restore there's
[1:28:31] no going back there's no turning back
[1:28:34] because they was eaten down to the very
[1:28:35] stomp so when god started work of

[1:29:10] then it turned to one
[1:29:12] it had to to make the husk the true word
[1:29:14] of life on it
[1:29:15] was on its way to the original gearing
[1:29:18] through the stages
[1:29:19] to the stalk so you could see your life
[1:29:22] your own life the history of your life
[1:29:25] that you were on your way to produce
[1:29:28] this thing
[1:29:29] so god take you through processes your
[1:29:31] life is not by chance
[1:29:32] you pass through hell high waters walk
[1:29:34] under conditions what for
[1:29:36] today is if you give up now you're dead
[1:29:40] if you're stuck no yeah come true but
[1:29:43] you have to go through all your
[1:29:44] processes for you to get where you're
[1:29:45] supposed to go
[1:29:47] because you're going to perfection
[1:29:49] that's the target that's the goal
[1:29:51] homie perfection perfection is that
[1:29:53] spirit
[1:29:54] that was before the word he said going
[1:29:57] back to that perfection
[1:29:58] which was elohim seven perfect spirits
[1:30:01] oh glory to god so this knowledge have
[1:30:03] to take us back to the tree of life
[1:30:05] if your knowledge and take it back there
[1:30:06] you're in trouble because that is what
[1:30:08] man fell from
[1:30:09] remember any garden with two trees
[1:30:11] knowledge
[1:30:13] and life oh
[1:30:16] hallelujah could you take a little more
[1:30:19] now watch tassel stalk castle house
[1:30:22] living
[1:30:23] they produce a holder they were a holder
[1:30:26] of a certain portion of the sea life
[1:30:29] but when they organized the life move
[1:30:31] out of it
[1:30:33] that proved by all history never an
[1:30:36] organization ever done a thing after
[1:30:37] organ it was dead
[1:30:39] the life was traveling on it was moving
[1:30:40] on so watch
[1:30:42] god his people is like a tree the life
[1:30:45] goes down
[1:30:46] up down but in the corner it goes up
[1:30:49] from the original
[1:30:50] and to the stalk tassel and husk and the
[1:30:53] thing that it passed through
[1:30:55] dies so it can't get back to you again
[1:31:00] so when a group a church is formed by an
[1:31:03] organizational spirit
[1:31:04] or denominational spirit the spirit of
[1:31:06] god can't get back in
[1:31:08] they block him out with decrees so when
[1:31:11] they block him also the elect and that
[1:31:13] group of church have to come out
[1:31:15] they have no choice it has no other road
[1:31:18] and have no other place for them they
[1:31:20] can't stay there they have to come out
[1:31:23] they have no choice because the true
[1:31:25] believer
[1:31:27] follows the life wherever it goes
[1:31:30] that god puts it in them to hunt for
[1:31:32] life
[1:31:34] and the life is in second peter one four
[1:31:36] through seven
[1:31:38] oh there is going to be a river and it's
[1:31:40] going to flow oh glory to god
[1:31:43] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:46] hallelujah
[1:31:47] give him some praises let's just hit
[1:31:50] this again
[1:31:52] stalk tassel husk
[1:31:55] and the thing that has passed you dies
[1:31:57] so it can't get back to you again what
[1:32:00] is it
[1:32:00] it's no use anymore it goes on to its
[1:32:04] perfection
[1:32:05] don't you see why he never used an
[1:32:07] organization
[1:32:08] he can't get back in it again
[1:32:12] it is dead but the life passed on one
[1:32:15] for another
[1:32:16] so after a while all they could rest on
[1:32:18] is their history
[1:32:22] not present tension the history of how
[1:32:24] it used to be
[1:32:26] what they had how much years ago because
[1:32:29] the life passed through
[1:32:31] i didn't move on and the true believer
[1:32:34] follows the life wherever it goes
[1:32:38] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[1:32:41] let me just finish here he said no watch
[1:32:44] but she is coming back again to the
[1:32:46] masterpiece the wonder bride
[1:32:47] perfected because she's part of that
[1:32:49] word that was spoken by him
[1:32:52] he will have a church without support or
[1:32:53] wrinkle it will not be connected to
[1:32:55] any kind of organization or any
[1:32:58] denomination
[1:32:59] that's a cursed thing it passed through
[1:33:01] those things but it will never be there
[1:33:04] notice the seed is coming up here
[1:33:06] brother
[1:33:07] that life is coming up not going back
[1:33:09] there is no more resurrection after this
[1:33:10] the life is coming up
[1:33:12] to go to its perfection oh
[1:33:15] you mean the life itself have to go to
[1:33:17] perfection
[1:33:18] yes because justification was a life
[1:33:21] satisfaction was a life
[1:33:22] after one of those was the life
[1:33:24] perfection is coming into the life
[1:33:26] itself
[1:33:27] oh glory to god is coming into the life
[1:33:29] itself
[1:33:30] hallelujah now remember no other church
[1:33:33] was he put out of the bible
[1:33:35] but there is nothing else the sculpture
[1:33:37] has got to go back to perfection again
[1:33:39] the word notice i hear the bomb have you
[1:33:41] read sunday when it comes forth it looks
[1:33:43] like the green
[1:33:44] or when the green light begins to leave
[1:33:46] the husk
[1:33:48] the green light let me say it again
[1:33:52] the green life when it begins to leave
[1:33:55] the husk watch to go to make the green
[1:33:59] he said the bride the husk opens up
[1:34:02] excommunicate the green what that's
[1:34:05] exactly what she did
[1:34:06] and when the seed begins to grow forward
[1:34:08] the horse puts it from itself
[1:34:10] then the life leaves all others to
[1:34:14] follow it
[1:34:15] that's the true believers they follow
[1:34:18] the life
[1:34:19] wherever the life goes oh glory to god
[1:34:23] hallelujah he said the holy ghost have
[1:34:26] been born
[1:34:26] at the river euphrates but at the doors
[1:34:29] of queens and dogmas
[1:34:31] that the holy spirit can't work in the
[1:34:33] church it was burned by these inaudible
[1:34:35] rivers for almost 2000 years
[1:34:37] but is to be loosed by the evening time
[1:34:40] by the even time message oh glory to god
[1:34:44] hallelujah
[1:34:45] hallelujah i'll be close with this
[1:34:49] isaiah 29 verse 9 it says steal
[1:34:52] yourselves and wonder cry out
[1:34:54] cry they are drunken but not with wine
[1:34:57] they stagger but not with strong drink
[1:34:59] for the lord had poured out upon you the
[1:35:01] spirit of deep sleep
[1:35:03] had closed your eyes and the prophets
[1:35:05] and your rulers and the seers had
[1:35:07] recovered
[1:35:08] and the vision of all is become unto you
[1:35:10] as words of a book that is sealed
[1:35:12] which men deliver to one that has
[1:35:13] learned he said read this i pray thee he
[1:35:15] says i cannot
[1:35:17] for it is sealed and the book is
[1:35:19] delivered to him that is not clear and
[1:35:20] said read this
[1:35:21] he said i can't because i'm not learned
[1:35:25] wherefore the lord said for as much as
[1:35:28] this people
[1:35:29] draw near to me with their mouth
[1:35:32] and with their lips to honor me and have
[1:35:35] removed their heart far from me
[1:35:38] and their fear towards me is taught by
[1:35:40] the perceptive men
[1:35:41] therefore behold i will proceed to do a
[1:35:44] marvelous work among these people
[1:35:47] even a marvelous work and a wonder for
[1:35:50] the wisdom of the wise men shall perish
[1:35:52] and the understanding of the prudent men
[1:35:55] shall be heared
[1:35:57] oh glory to god i'm finished
[1:36:00] so malachi 4 he brought this prophetic
[1:36:03] vision
[1:36:04] for the bride that revealed that the
[1:36:06] ministry of jesus christ
[1:36:08] will be returned back to the church oh
[1:36:11] glory to god not a man
[1:36:13] but the ministry of jesus christ oh
[1:36:15] glory to god i had some more stuff and
[1:36:17] cut off here

[1:36:24] play something could you stand and
[1:36:25] worship the lord
[1:36:26] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:36:30] that fightful ministry again would be
[1:36:33] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:36:35] regardless of what them brothers saying
[1:36:36] i'm just saying they think they'll be
[1:36:38] fightful and it's the fightful and they
[1:36:39] preach in a long time
[1:36:40] that is not what the prophet revealed he
[1:36:43] said the fifo ministry will be the
[1:36:45] ministry of jesus christ which should be
[1:36:48] the life added
[1:36:49] manifested confirmed he said when the
[1:36:52] capstone come they become vindicated
[1:36:53] sons
[1:36:54] and vindicate their daughters charity to
[1:36:57] burn the perfectness
[1:36:59] covering that man from head to toe not
[1:37:01] that devil moved till he says
[1:37:03] i see nowhere satan kingdom not even
[1:37:06] this thing at all

[1:37:15] revelation after revelation after
[1:37:16] revelation power after power of the
[1:37:18] power
[1:37:19] that's what will be striking the church

[1:37:22] 40 days

[1:37:44] and testings
[1:37:45] and see your glory and take a hold of
[1:37:48] the scripture that says
[1:37:49] i reckon that the present suffering
[1:37:52] present

[1:37:56] with the glory that shall be revealed
