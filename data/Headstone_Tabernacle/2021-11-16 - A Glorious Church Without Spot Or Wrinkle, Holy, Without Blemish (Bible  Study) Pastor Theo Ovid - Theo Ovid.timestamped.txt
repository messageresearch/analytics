[13:07] tonight and
[13:10] um you
[13:14] know Joshua 14:12 and Caleb says now
[13:19] therefore give me this mountain where of
[13:22] the Lord speak in that day for thou
[13:23] heardest as in the day that the anakim
[13:26] OFA that the cities were great and
[13:28] fenced so so if so be the Lord will be
[13:30] with me I shall be able to drive them
[13:33] out as the Lord said and tonight I want
[13:35] you to re relax free yourself tonight
[13:39] and believe in your heart whatever God
[13:42] requires of us require of you because of
[13:45] me we can fulfill it it can be done so
[13:49] don't see it as Giants don't see it as
[13:53] impossible say Lord if this is what you
[13:56] require of me there must be a provision
[13:59] need need for me to to attain it or to
[14:03] get to it so it's not a matter of um you
[14:07] want God to come down to your standard
[14:09] you want to get up to God's standard to
[14:11] God's requirement so I would just share
[14:16] something and then we would um uh go
[14:18] into what we want to say
[14:20] tonight
[14:22] now what I want to share tonight is what
[14:25] I believe called The Vision is of the
[14:27] church as being
[14:30] Church Without spot or wrinkle washed in
[14:34] his blood a church a people made
[14:40] pure this church is female in
[14:45] designation called to be the bride Jesus
[14:49] himself after asking who R man say I the
[14:51] son of man I am he told Peter Upon This
[14:55] Rock I will build my church we know in
[15:00] Colossians it describes he Jesus being
[15:03] the head of the body and his body is
[15:05] called the church that in all things he
[15:08] might have the pinenes note there is no
[15:12] man there there is no Prophet Apostle
[15:15] teacher
[15:16] evangelist he is the head and the body
[15:20] is called The
[15:22] Church Christ being her head not a man
[15:26] not a pastor not def fful Ministry
[15:30] is he is identified as the head of the
[15:33] body called The
[15:35] Church Revelation 219 says There came
[15:38] unto me one of the Seven Angels which
[15:41] had the seven vials full of the seven
[15:44] last plagues and talk with me saying
[15:46] come hither I will show Thee the bride
[15:50] the Lamb's
[15:51] wife I will show the the bride the
[15:55] Lamb's wife we not talking about Baptist
[15:57] Church Methodist Church Pentecost church
[15:59] I'm I'm in the message we not talking
[16:01] about that speaking about the bride who
[16:04] is she the Lamb's wife not some Pastor
[16:07] wife the Lamb's wife Revelation
[16:11] 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[16:14] honor to him for the marriage of the
[16:17] Lamb is come and his wife had made
[16:21] herself ready made herself
[16:25] ready now the very fact that there's a
[16:29] prophecy over the lasty church that sin
[16:33] would not be able to stay in it
[16:36] means that the pendulum of the church if
[16:40] I could use that analogy would be
[16:43] moving towards
[16:45] Holiness and my title of tonight's uh
[16:49] Bible study is a glorious Church Without
[16:53] spot or wrinkle holy without blemish
[16:59] that's the title tonight a glorious
[17:01] Church Without spot or wrinkle holy
[17:06] without
[17:07] blemish
[17:09] now God's
[17:11] holiness kept the church Pure or we can
[17:15] say it this way God was not going to
[17:19] allow his church to be
[17:24] defiled and the example of that was when
[17:28] a and Safa
[17:31] Believers let's call them baptized
[17:33] Believers came to church they offer to
[17:36] sell things and bring the money to the
[17:37] church and when uh Peter asked is this
[17:40] all he said yes and they kept backs it
[17:43] wasn't all he say didn't lie to a man
[17:46] you lie to the Holy Ghost and he fell
[17:49] dead here comes his wife his wife was
[17:55] she didn't know her husband died she
[17:57] came in and they ask the question was
[17:59] that all and she instead of staying with
[18:03] truth as we said the the unleavened
[18:06] bread of sincerity of Truth she chose to
[18:09] lie just like her husband she fell down
[18:11] and die and of course great fear fell
[18:14] among the Believers and the Bible went
[18:17] on to say no man joined themselves to
[18:20] that church but God added to the church
[18:23] such as would be saved
[18:26] question are we going to go back to that
[18:30] we have the answer already Yes because
[18:33] he said I'm Alpha and Omega so I want
[18:36] you to to look at it closely tonight
[18:39] that is the question there is not that
[18:43] the God wanted to judge anas Zar the
[18:46] question here was how in the early
[18:51] church the church was kept clean and
[18:54] brother brandham had a great desire in
[18:55] his heart he longed to walk into a
[18:57] church that's sin couldn't stay in it
[19:01] and he prophesied that there will be a
[19:03] church that sin cannot stay in it I want
[19:07] you to think about that so in other
[19:09] words the way people walk in in a laser
[19:12] feir attitude um Like Anything
[19:27] Goes naked before God naked before the
[19:31] Holy Ghost now that word defile means
[19:41] damage uh are you hearing me
[19:43] clearly
[19:45] anybody are you hearing me anybody could
[19:47] give a wave you hearing me
[19:49] clearly okay I trust I see a message
[19:52] came up about a unsteady internet
[19:55] connection so I trust in that you hear
[19:57] me Clint
[19:59] so that word defile
[20:01] means uh to damage the Purity or
[20:04] appearance of to M or spoil or desecrate
[20:10] to make unclean or impure to corrupt the
[20:14] Purity or Perfection of just spoil
[20:17] something or someone so that a thing or
[20:20] person is less beautiful or
[20:24] pure let's turn our Bibles tonight our
[20:27] first scripture reading will be from
[20:29] Jeremiah chapter
[20:30] 2 we want to read from 1 to 13 and I
[20:34] want to go down after that to
[20:37] 3132 we take it from there let's look at
[20:39] Jeremiah your Bibles to Jeremiah chapter
[20:41] 2 and let's
[20:45] read moreover the word of the Lord came
[20:48] to me saying go and cry in the ears of
[20:51] Jerusalem saying thus sayth the Lord I
[20:55] remember Thee the kindness of thy youth
[20:58] the the love of thine espousal when thou
[21:01] wentest after me in the wilderness in
[21:03] the land that was not
[21:05] soon Israel or his Holiness unto the
[21:08] Lord and the first fruit of his
[21:11] increase all that devour him shall
[21:14] offend evil shall come upon them seeth
[21:17] the Lord he he the word of the Lord oh
[21:19] House of Jacob and all the families of
[21:22] the House of Israel thus sayth the Lord
[21:25] what iniquity have your fathers found in
[21:29] me that they have gone far from me and
[21:33] have walked after vanity and and become
[21:36] vain neither said they where is the Lord
[21:39] that brought us out of the land of Egypt
[21:42] that led us through the Wilderness to a
[21:44] land of deserts and of pits to a land of
[21:47] drought and of shadow of death to a land
[21:49] that no man passed through and where no
[21:51] man dwelt and I brought you into a
[21:55] plentiful country to eat the fruits
[21:57] thereof and the goodness thereof but
[22:00] when he entered he defiled my land and
[22:06] made my inheritage and
[22:09] Abomination the priest said not where is
[22:12] the Lord and they that handled the law
[22:14] knew me not the pastors also
[22:18] transgressed against me and the prophets
[22:21] prophesied by Baal and walk after the
[22:24] things that do not profit wherefore I
[22:28] will yet plead with you Saye the Lord
[22:31] and with your children's children will I
[22:33] plead for Passover the Isles of CH and
[22:36] see send them to Kea consider diligently
[22:39] and see if there be such a thing had a
[22:42] nation change their gods which are yet
[22:45] no Gods but my people have changed their
[22:50] glory for that which do not
[22:53] profit be astonished oh ye Heavens at
[22:56] this be horribly afraid be very desolate
[23:00] sayth the
[23:02] Lord for my people committed two evils
[23:07] they have forsaken me the Fountain of
[23:10] Living Waters and hewed them out system
[23:14] broken
[23:16] system that could hold no
[23:18] water Jeremiah we go down to 31 and 32
[23:22] of that same chapter 31 and 32 and this
[23:25] one is an astonishing one to me in vers
[23:28] to the one who say oh generation see the
[23:31] word of the Lord have I been a
[23:33] Wilderness unto Israel a land of
[23:36] Darkness wherefore say my people we are
[23:39] Lords we will come no more unto thee in
[23:41] other words you your own God you don't
[23:43] need God you don't need to seek the Lord
[23:45] but this is the word I want to get can a
[23:47] maid forget her
[23:49] ornament or a bride her
[23:53] attire yet my people have forgotten me
[23:59] days without number and it's powerful
[24:04] how God could describe can a bride
[24:08] forget her garments you're getting
[24:10] married and and you forget all about
[24:13] your garments he said my people have
[24:15] forgotten me days without number so I
[24:20] want you to see how God sees this
[24:23] relationship between himself and his
[24:27] people
[24:28] his people as a bride his people as a
[24:33] church his people as called by him to be
[24:37] separated unto him I want you to see
[24:39] that and I would like to go
[24:43] into jeriah chapter
[24:45] 3
[24:47] and I want to I think I'll read it from
[24:51] the yeah Jeremiah chapter 3 reading ver
[24:54] verse one and I want you to see God
[24:57] thoughts of the behaviors and attitudes
[25:00] and so on just look at look at this
[25:02] Jeremiah chapter 3 and read in verse one
[25:05] they say if a man put away his wife and
[25:07] she go from him and become another's man
[25:11] shall he return unto her again shall not
[25:15] the land be greatly polluted so you see
[25:17] how the scriptures put in
[25:20] relationship adultery bad behavior with
[25:24] God's people so let's go again they say
[25:26] if a man put away his wife she go from
[25:29] him and become another's man shall he
[25:32] return unto her again shall not that
[25:34] land be greatly polluted but thou played
[25:37] the hot with many lovers yet return
[25:40] again to me sayth the Lord lift up thine
[25:43] eyes unto the high places and see where
[25:45] thou H has been lying with in the ways
[25:48] thou sat for them as the Arabian in the
[25:50] wilderness and thou has polluted land
[25:53] with thy hams and thy wickedness so then
[25:57] in the amplifi that that chapter that
[25:59] verse two says lift up your eyes to Bear
[26:01] Heights and see where have you not been
[26:04] adulterous laid with by the wayside you
[26:08] have sat waiting for lovers eager eager
[26:11] for adult idolatry like the Arabian
[26:14] Desert tries man who wait to plunder in
[26:16] the wilderness and you have polluted the
[26:18] land with your vile hot Tre and your
[26:21] wickedness
[26:22] unfaithfulness and Disobedience to God
[26:26] this is big
[26:29] so they said you you you pollute the
[26:31] land with vile hot Tre your wickedness
[26:34] and that wickedness is
[26:36] unfaithfulness and Disobedience to god
[26:39] let's continue verse three therefore the
[26:41] showers have been withholden and there
[26:43] have been no lattering so God is saying
[26:47] because of the behavior no showers no
[26:50] lattering for thou Hast a hor forehead
[26:54] and refuses to be
[26:56] ashamed and it's it says therefore the
[26:59] showers have been withheld Amplified
[27:02] there has been no spring rain yet you
[27:04] have the brow of a prostitute you refuse
[27:07] to be
[27:08] ashamed who four will thou not from this
[27:12] time cry unto me my father the what the
[27:15] guide of my youth will he reserve his
[27:18] anger forever will he keep to the end
[27:20] behold th I spoken and done evil things
[27:22] as thou couldest the Lord said also unto
[27:25] me in the days of Josiah the king as
[27:27] thou seen that which backsliding Israel
[27:31] had done she had gone up from every high
[27:34] mountain and under every tree and had
[27:36] played the hot and I said after she done
[27:40] all these things turn down to me but she
[27:43] returned not and a treacherous sister
[27:46] Judah saw it and I saw when all the
[27:50] causes whereby backsliding Israel
[27:52] committed adultery I had put her away I
[27:55] had given my bill of divorce yet a
[27:57] treacherous sister Judah feared not but
[28:00] went and played the hot also and it came
[28:03] to pass the likeness of aom that she
[28:06] defiled the land and committed adultery
[28:10] with stones and with
[28:12] stops Hallelujah and yet for all this
[28:17] her treacherous sister Judah had not
[28:19] turned unto me with her whole heart but
[28:22] fakely say but fakely say the Lord so so
[28:27] so this this this one here that that not
[28:30] but the whole heart the Amplified said
[28:32] but in spite of all of this a faithless
[28:34] and treacherous sister Judah did not
[28:37] return to me in sincerity and with a
[28:41] whole heart but only in share
[28:45] hypocrisy verse 11 and the Lord said
[28:48] unto me the backsliding Israel had
[28:51] Justified herself more than treacherous
[28:54] Judah go and Proclaim these words
[28:57] towards the North and say return thou

[29:36] Lord your God and have scattered your

[29:44] Lord turn oh backsliding children say

[30:06] God's passion and God's heart and God is
[30:09] describing it as a woman and and and
[30:12] this this this verse here is is so
[30:14] beautiful and he says uh verse 14 and
[30:18] the Amplified says return oh faithless
[30:20] Children of the whole 12 tribes says the
[30:23] Lord for I Am Lord and Master and
[30:26] husband to you I will take you not as a
[30:29] nation but individually one from a city
[30:32] and two from a tribal family and I will
[30:34] bring you to Zion verse 15 and I will
[30:36] give you pastors according to my heart
[30:41] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[30:45] understanding and the scriptures in
[30:47] amplifi for that
[30:48] says and I will give you spiritual
[30:51] Shepherds after my own heart in the
[30:54] final time would feed you with knowledge
[30:58] and understanding and judgment may God
[31:02] bless his word oh give the Lord some
[31:04] Praises right now oh thank you Lord
[31:07] Jesus and here it is we go to our core
[31:10] text and is a familiar text it's from
[31:13] Ephesians 5 we want to read from verse
[31:16] 22 to 27 Ephesians 5 if you have have it
[31:20] B Ephesians 5 we want to read from verse
[31:23] 22 to
[31:25] 27 wise submit yourself unto own
[31:28] husbands as unto the Lord so now we just
[31:31] left the Old Testament and showing god
[31:34] making comparisons to woman wife and
[31:38] your husband and so on like that and he
[31:41] seen them Harting theel parading theel
[31:43] prostituting theel he still want them to
[31:46] return here we in the New Testament now
[31:49] Ephesians 5 wives submit yourselves unto
[31:51] your own husbands and unto the Lord for
[31:54] the husband is head of the wife
[31:56] comparison even as Christ is the head of
[31:59] the church and he's a savior of the body
[32:01] therefore as the church is subject unto
[32:04] Christ so let your wives be to their own
[32:07] husbands in everything so he's given the
[32:10] clean comparison of the operation of a
[32:12] wife to a husband as Christ and the
[32:15] church husbands verse 25 love your wives
[32:18] even as Christ also loved the church and
[32:21] give himself for it reason purpose that
[32:24] he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[32:28] the washing of the Water by the word so
[32:31] I hope tonight that this scripture
[32:34] brings a new meaning to you in the
[32:36] context of what we are presented that he
[32:38] might sanctify and cleanse it with a
[32:41] washing of the Water by the word reason
[32:44] that he might present it to himself so
[32:47] in other words he's not going to leave
[32:49] you as you are he's not going to pick
[32:51] you up from the world and leave you as
[32:53] you are worldly filthy whatever that he
[32:55] might present it to himself what kind of
[32:57] a church this is the vision here now a
[33:00] glorious church not having spot or
[33:03] wrinkle and in between here or any such
[33:06] thing but that it should be holy without
[33:08] blemish that that blemish is without
[33:11] fault so this here is the great vision
[33:15] of God and I know that you might
[33:17] remember we continue to read this in
[33:19] marriages and in ceremonies and we
[33:21] talking about but this is a great
[33:23] mystery he's speaking about Christ and
[33:25] the church yet he talking about husband
[33:26] and wife or could we give the Lord some
[33:29] Praises so I want you to see clearly
[33:31] that there's an objective of this
[33:33] glorious church that God promised in the
[33:35] last days this church must be presented
[33:39] to himself this church have to be
[33:41] Sanctified and cleansed by the washing
[33:44] of the Water by the word now let's
[33:46] continue and and this is where I want to
[33:49] get to an indictment over Ministry and a
[33:55] life of Holiness but Brandon I said I
[33:58] don't think I am he said I want to be a
[34:00] holy if the Lord ever told me to roll I
[34:03] guess I would roll I want to be holy
[34:05] anyhow to live a life of Holiness means
[34:10] cleanness before God and he said I
[34:13] condemn the thing I accuse it this is
[34:16] indictment now this is not brother over
[34:18] inditing anybody okay because this
[34:19] indictment over me over all the minister
[34:22] over Ministry Elders deacons is it's
[34:24] over because brother bam said I stand as
[34:27] Jesus Christ attorney okay listen care I
[34:30] accuse it of crucifying the word of God
[34:32] before the people B woman short wearing
[34:37] standing up in the choir somebody said
[34:40] to me the other day some woman asked me
[34:42] said well where do you think you'd find
[34:44] I said if the Lord asked me to pick a
[34:46] dozen out over the world I'll be scared
[34:48] to death when by discernment of the
[34:52] spirit stand there and watch them stand
[34:55] like that and see them things over there
[34:57] the dirty filthy loow down cigarette
[35:02] suckers out there car on like that and
[35:04] standing rqu and sing in that condition
[35:07] and let the audience see them they will
[35:09] say well if she can do it I can
[35:12] too and here it is a Christian Life is a
[35:17] life of Holiness and
[35:21] Purity I do I'm not talking about
[35:23] message
[35:24] life so this is where
[35:28] I want you to think what Caleb said if
[35:31] the Lord be with me I shall be able to a
[35:34] Christian Life is a life of Holiness and
[35:38] Purity say it after me a Christian

[35:51] Holiness and Purity Give the Lord some
[35:53] praise oh blessed be the name of the
[35:55] Lord this is Brother Bram I indict them
[35:59] in the name of Jesus Christ for their
[36:02] fil and built they have brought the
[36:05] gospel to a disgrace and those who try
[36:07] to hold it are called Fanatics and say
[36:10] that's oldfashioned I indict them in the
[36:13] name of Jesus Christ he said the Bible
[36:16] said that when the spirit and the enemy
[36:19] comes in like a flood God will raise up
[36:21] a standard against it and when in this
[36:24] day with a lot of impersonation men
[36:26] acting like Christians
[36:28] pretending to be it is and in their
[36:32] heart as black as the smutty walls of
[36:35] Hell there's many pastoring today that
[36:38] should be out Cutting Corner or
[36:40] something be better off there is men
[36:43] with their theologies and great degrees
[36:45] and things like that and knows no more
[36:47] about God than a hot that knows about
[36:49] Egyptian KN you talk to them about the
[36:51] power of God and the resurrection it's a
[36:53] fanatical preacher that was in the days
[36:56] gone by it show knows where they are
[37:00] they don't realize where what day they
[37:03] living in oh praise God and this is
[37:06] closing up this part here and as my
[37:08] brethren stand here this morning he's
[37:09] praying I pray talk what ministers each
[37:12] of these ministers here these
[37:15] ministering Spirits God hear my prayer I
[37:19] pray that you will Purge that gift that
[37:22] is in them if they are preachers make
[37:24] them better preachers if they

[37:27] evangelists if they are teachers make
[37:29] them better teachers if they are Pastors
[37:32] make them better pastors God grant that
[37:34] they may be filled with the spirit of
[37:37] God and will be energized with the great
[37:39] super vine that will give them life
[37:42] eternal and power to minister with and
[37:45] to not touch the needy world as it needs
[37:48] today oh give go give the Lord some
[37:50] Praises tonight so I trust this would
[37:52] kind of help you tonight to see it is
[37:55] not a put on it is not this is not the
[38:00] Pentecostal age where it had gifted men
[38:04] signs ons and miracles gifted men and
[38:06] they had no life that is why God in a
[38:08] prophet to bring us the word okay the
[38:10] Pentecostal had a great age 1906 out
[38:13] Point Dynamic Spirit but it couldn't
[38:16] bring them to adoption it couldn't bring
[38:18] them to Perfection it couldn't bring
[38:20] them into raping fate because they
[38:22] didn't have the word to take them dear
[38:25] here come the prophet now with the word
[38:26] the full word all the word and and
[38:29] tonight this is what we have to grasp we
[38:33] have to say I don't want to be churchy I
[38:35] don't want to be a church member I want
[38:38] to be part of this body called The Bride
[38:41] to get in you need to get in by the
[38:43] spirit okay not by water baptism but by
[38:46] the baptism of the spirit Spirit is by
[38:48] one Spirit you see you can't break the
[38:50] word by one Spirit we are baptized into
[38:52] the body and when God put you into that
[38:55] bright body nobody could take take you
[38:57] out okay so let's continue praise the
[39:01] Lord St John
[39:03] 17 verse 16 to
[39:06] 19 this is
[39:08] Jesus and Jesus is
[39:12] speaking and speaking about his
[39:14] disciples now these men are men just
[39:17] like you and I born in sin shape
[39:19] iniquity they following Christ they are
[39:22] hearing about this kingdom of God they
[39:24] hearing about um not of this world and
[39:27] so
[39:28] and Jesus in St John 1716 saying they
[39:31] are not of the
[39:33] world
[39:34] even as I am not of the
[39:38] world sanctify them through thy truth
[39:42] Thy word is true now I want you to see
[39:45] the importance of they being
[39:49] Sanctified in order to go forward
[39:51] because you see it come like we born
[39:53] nasty and filth we it's muddy it's dirty
[39:58] for God to begin to use us he has to
[39:59] take us and clean us up and then Jesus
[40:02] went further in verse 18 as thou sent me
[40:04] into the
[40:05] world even so I sent them into the world
[40:10] and for their
[40:12] sakes I
[40:16] sanctify
[40:17] myself that they also might be
[40:22] Sanctified to the truth now this here is
[40:25] mindblowing because Jesus was saying I
[40:29] sanctify myself I am making that
[40:33] sacrifice that they also may be
[40:35] Sanctified now Jesus came Sanctified
[40:37] because the father Sanctified Jesus and
[40:41] that scripture is found in St John
[40:43] 10 if you want to find it you could turn
[40:45] to it in John 10 verse 30 to 38 and this
[40:50] is when Jesus dropped the big one in
[40:51] them in verse 13 he say and my father
[40:53] are one that's what Jesus said in John
[40:57] 10 vers 30 I'm my father one then Jesus
[41:00] Took up Stones against again again to
[41:02] Stone him the Jews sorry then the Jews
[41:05] took up stones again to Stone and Jesus
[41:07] answered them say many good works have I
[41:09] showed you from my father from which of
[41:12] those Works do you Stone me the Jews
[41:15] answered him saying for a good work we
[41:17] Stone thee not but for blasphemy and
[41:20] because thou being a man maketh thyself
[41:23] God Jesus answered them is it not
[41:27] written in your law I said ye are
[41:29] Gods if he called them Gods unto whom
[41:32] the word of the Lord came to came and
[41:35] the scripture cannot be broken say ye of
[41:37] him listen Jus words say ye of him whom
[41:42] the father had
[41:44] Sanctified and sent him into the world
[41:47] th
[41:48] Blasphemous because I said I am the Son
[41:50] of God if I do not the works of my
[41:53] father believe me not but if I do though
[41:57] you believe not me believe the works
[41:59] that he may know and believe that the
[42:02] father is in me and I in so Jesus said
[42:05] clearly here in this scriptures verse 36
[42:08] whom the father had Sanctified and sent
[42:11] him into the world so Jesus was
[42:16] Sanctified came to the Earth and he said
[42:20] I sanctify myself for your sake that you
[42:23] also may be Sanctified and he went on
[42:25] further and said as my father send me so
[42:29] send I you and this brings us now to
[42:33] Romans 12 there's a familiar
[42:35] one Romans 121 and2 I beseech you
[42:38] therefore Brethren this is not Sinners
[42:41] this is not rum Drinkers and this is not
[42:43] paror this is Brethren I beseech you
[42:46] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[42:49] that you present your bodies a Living
[42:54] Sacrifice Okay so
[42:57] from the Jewish tradition they know what
[43:00] sacrifice is you take a lamb you take a
[43:02] bulock you take a goat you put on the
[43:04] altar it fill the sacrifice it's an
[43:07] offering unto God and we know that that
[43:09] was being done until that perfect lamb
[43:11] came right and here is Paul say we not
[43:15] talking about no de sacrifice we are
[43:17] talking about a Living Sacrifice and
[43:19] we're talking about your
[43:20] body your body present your body a
[43:25] Living Sacrifice in other words words
[43:27] your entire being on the altar of God as
[43:31] a Living Sacrifice how holy acceptable
[43:34] unto God which is your reasonable
[43:37] service and maybe I just take a quick
[43:39] look at this in the Amplified and see
[43:43] what it says here praise the Lord in the
[43:45] meantime you just give God a praise
[43:47] offering blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:50] hallelujah okay so I want to read this
[43:52] in amplifi I appeal to you therefore
[43:54] Brethren and beg of you in view of all
[43:58] the mercies of God to make listen a
[44:01] decisive dedication of your bodes pre
[44:06] presenting all your members and
[44:07] faculties as a Living Sacrifice holy
[44:11] devoted consecrated and well pleased to
[44:14] God which is your reasonable rational
[44:18] intelligent service and spiritual
[44:21] worship so we go back to uh the regular
[44:24] scripture verse two and being not
[44:25] conformed to this world but be
[44:28] transformed by renewing of your mind
[44:31] that you may prove what is that good and
[44:35] acceptable and perfect will of God the
[44:37] Amplified says do not be conformed to
[44:39] this world this age Fashion After and
[44:43] adapted to the external superficial
[44:45] Customs but be transformed Changed by
[44:49] the entire renewal of your mind by its
[44:53] new ideals and its new attitude so that
[44:55] you may prove for your yourself what is
[44:58] the good and acceptable perfect will of
[45:00] God even the thing which is good and
[45:03] acceptable perfect in his sight for you
[45:06] so tonight by sharing these thoughts by
[45:11] sharing these things this bring a fresh
[45:14] infusion into your mind as to what God
[45:18] how God wants us to live how God wants
[45:22] us to treat each other how God want us
[45:24] to come into His presence how God and
[45:28] and we said uh one of the things that
[45:31] separate the God we serve from
[45:33] everything else is his Holiness and and
[45:35] we cannot say wear white clothes and and
[45:39] and and up everything to the neck and to
[45:41] the the arms and and say that is
[45:43] Holiness or we don't do and don't do and
[45:46] keeping laws that's not Holiness
[45:49] Holiness is when God's presence could be
[45:51] revealed to you it is his Holiness not
[45:54] our Holiness we don't have Holiness I
[45:57] think the last lesson that we shared
[46:00] with you about the beauty of Holiness uh
[46:02] the key scripture de was Isaiah coming
[46:05] into presence and God let Uzziah fall
[46:10] and Ministry crash as king and Isaiah
[46:14] shooked up went into the temple and
[46:16] began to cry out unto God he's a prophet
[46:18] because I'm speaking the word speaking
[46:20] for God Isaiah put out 66 books Isaiah
[46:24] and here it is when he come into
[46:26] presence
[46:27] he saw the seraps he saw the burners he
[46:30] said wo is me when you come into
[46:33] presence is not whoo is you and you and
[46:36] blaming this one and accusing this one
[46:38] no who is me I am undone I am a man of
[46:41] unclean lips it brings you so conscious
[46:44] of your
[46:46] littleness it makes you so conscious of
[46:49] how small you are in presence when you
[46:53] see somebody in arrogance and nobody can
[46:55] talk to them and tell them anything you
[46:57] know they come into presence yet because
[46:59] when this presence hit but Bron he was
[47:01] in a corner somewhere he said for days
[47:03] he was numb he say you know the
[47:04] blessings of God I should only Paul God
[47:07] when John fell he fell as one dead he
[47:09] knew Jesus in the flesh but that
[47:11] presence that Daniel fell all these
[47:13] brothers one reaction One Behavior Moses
[47:16] take off your shoes the place you stand
[47:18] is Holy Ground so God reveal himself
[47:22] from a level of Holiness and I don't if
[47:25] anybody think we sanctification Holiness
[47:28] and like you know this is not mess what
[47:31] they are ignorant let them be ignorant
[47:33] intellectual stupidity just leave them
[47:35] in stupidity this is what God going to
[47:39] have a glorious Church Without spot or
[47:42] rer as I said if the church is moving
[47:47] towards no sin or where sin cannot stay
[47:52] in the church it is only because of his
[47:54] Holiness you know what he did by judging
[47:56] as n Fire he kept the church
[47:59] holy could somebody say amen he kept the
[48:03] church pure because if that is allowed
[48:06] the church will come corrupt what was
[48:08] the message a couple of Sundays about
[48:10] the unleavened bread of sincerity and
[48:14] truth because you see a little leaven
[48:16] will leaven the whole lump and if
[48:18] rotness start to come in it will rotten
[48:20] the whole group it will rot the whole
[48:22] church it will rot the right body so God
[48:24] have to get the L out so God will drop
[48:27] some bums to rock off and blow out the
[48:31] rocks that do offend off of his holy
[48:34] mountain go going move out ministers God
[48:37] G move out Elders God will move out
[48:39] deacons ushers people individuals go
[48:41] going to shift things are WR so that
[48:45] this will come to pass his Holiness his
[48:48] presence his power will
[48:51] prev you see it in deep to deep brother
[48:55] preach you come say you know what I'm
[48:57] waiting on I don't know if you come I
[48:58] don't know if you'll be here I'm waiting
[49:00] on the angel of the Lord he's waiting
[49:02] he's waiting and when the angel enter
[49:05] into the room he said he is here now I
[49:09] think his brother Billy
[49:11] Paul give a
[49:13] testimony and of brother Braham says
[49:16] Billy you know something about wanting
[49:19] to see the angel he want bil told to see
[49:21] the angel or whatnot and he put a
[49:24] pillow I may not get this story all
[49:27] together in detail that way he put a
[49:29] pillow over Billy Paul's head and said
[49:32] you know where the sink is at or the Bas
[49:35] that or something that I want you to
[49:37] look there he's standing there and then
[49:40] he he moves the the pillow and when
[49:43] brother Billy Paul look you see a man
[49:45] standing there he describ him and that
[49:48] presence and brother Billy Paul give a
[49:51] testimony that since that experience he
[49:55] always knew when the angel
[49:58] came so it appears as if because brother
[50:01] Billy Paul had to work with brother
[50:04] brandham in the ministry of the spirit
[50:08] I'll say that way he had us to be aware
[50:11] of and be conscious of when this being
[50:14] or this angel came into the room so he
[50:17] said before even bam said it he will
[50:19] know the angel is there and when the
[50:22] angel came among the people you would
[50:24] hear brah say I take every Spirit under
[50:26] my control for the glory of God because
[50:30] he knew William brandham knew that the
[50:34] full authority of heaven was behind him
[50:36] then so there's not a demon could
[50:39] challenge that not when Michael is there
[50:42] not when the angel is there not when
[50:45] that power is there and that same thing
[50:49] will be applied to the lasty church that
[50:52] same thing will be applied to the
[50:54] adopted sons that same thing will be
[50:56] applied to the apostolic church because
[50:58] believe you me there is going to be an
[51:00] Apostolic Church in The Last Days
[51:02] Apostolic church and and and that is why
[51:05] you will get Apostolic conditions that
[51:08] is why you could hear about when the
[51:09] Press come down there was no press if
[51:11] there's no Apostolic church that doesn't
[51:12] make any sense what they going to press
[51:14] us for for books and tapes absolutely
[51:16] not the only way press could come is
[51:20] because Jesus Christ the original grain
[51:23] is being
[51:25] reproduced and a big B he says the
[51:29] ministry has come to Perfection when
[51:33] when Christ is reproduced in the natural
[51:36] it's a direct quote I say it again the
[51:39] ministry we talk about Ministry and this
[51:41] brother Ministry and that brother
[51:42] Ministry preach a good message and he
[51:44] preaching Mysteries preaching this and
[51:46] preaching that fine but there's a word
[51:49] concerning coming to Perfection coming
[51:51] to Perfection is not more Mysteries and
[51:53] more talk the ministry has coming into
[51:57] Perfection when Christ is reproduced in
[52:02] natural not verbal in natural that is
[52:06] Christ back on the Earth again in human
[52:09] flesh in other words the word made flesh
[52:12] okay so we talk about presenting your
[52:14] bodies a Living Sacrifice being on the
[52:18] altar which is your reasonable service
[52:21] and and then your mind being transformed
[52:24] now when Israel came out out something I
[52:27] always refer back to when Israel came
[52:28] out of Egypt they don't know who this
[52:30] God is and we when we come out of the
[52:32] world we get convicted we want to serve
[52:35] Jesus we don't know who God is yet we
[52:38] know God is alive Jesus saved me I got
[52:41] baptized in Jesus name and if you have
[52:42] not get baptized in Jesus name you
[52:44] should if you haven't given your heart
[52:46] to the Lord you should okay and you
[52:48] shall receive the cancellation of your
[52:51] sins remission of your sins and you
[52:52] shall receive his holy ghost but listen
[52:55] to this I want to share this with you
[52:58] and this have to do with setting your
[52:59] mind in order for Holiness you can't
[53:03] repent for what Adam done you never done
[53:05] it Adam did it you just get forgiveness
[53:09] what you have done the old nature is
[53:11] still there and then talk about here's a
[53:14] human heart and watch now this one here
[53:17] have a snake in it that is sin and he
[53:20] has his life this one here has a dove in
[53:23] it which is the Holy Spirit and he has a
[53:25] life now one here with the snake in it
[53:29] has malice hatred envy and what's
[53:33] causing it well and the other one have
[53:36] joy love longsuffering and there's a
[53:39] dove that is causing that one and the
[53:41] other Behavior hatred Envy snake wasn't
[53:43] right now when you ask and you are
[53:46] forgiven of your sins you only done this
[53:49] taking that away but the thing that make
[53:52] you do it is still there which is the
[53:55] old root of E evil it is still there
[53:58] notice when you repent and get baptized
[54:00] in the name of Jesus Christ he forgive
[54:02] you of your sins then and this is the
[54:05] part we want to get to then secondly
[54:07] comes
[54:08] sanctification and listen to this which
[54:10] sets our mind in order for
[54:16] Holiness now if this is not presented
[54:19] Church could just be like a club
[54:21] churches that could be a place where you
[54:23] look for a boyfriend or you look for a
[54:25] girlfriend
[54:27] or you look for you know some help or
[54:30] some blessing or you look for some like
[54:32] some holy water if if in other words you
[54:35] have to begin to see God's mind and
[54:37] God's thoughts what he wants the people
[54:39] to understand so that is why God didn't
[54:42] just send Moses to deliver the people he
[54:45] sent Moses to deliver the people to
[54:47] bring them to the Mountain of God that
[54:50] they could hear from God and get
[54:52] instructions to know God how he lives
[54:55] what he loves
[54:56] what he what what pleases him you see so
[55:00] it's not so we don't want to come down
[55:03] this far and have the god of our own
[55:05] creation people have that you God is a
[55:08] good God all the time like a phrase and
[55:09] they're doing their own thing you know
[55:10] and I am God so and they have you know
[55:13] like if he's a man just like them we're
[55:15] not talking about that I'm not talking
[55:17] about your
[55:19] gods or The God that you create or I say
[55:21] this way the god of your imagination
[55:23] we're not talking about that you see the
[55:25] scriptures we are reading we talking
[55:27] about the God of the Bible not the god
[55:29] of your interpretation the god of the
[55:32] scriptures okay so so this is the same
[55:34] thing so next come secondly comes
[55:38] sanctification which sets our mind in
[55:41] order for Holiness to think right
[55:44] sanctification is a Greek word which
[55:47] means clean and set aside for service
[55:50] next after sanctification comes the
[55:52] baptism of fire and holy ghost that God
[55:56] might dwell in us and the fire of God
[56:00] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[56:03] the Holy Ghost Inside in the natural
[56:07] when a woman gives birth to a baby first
[56:10] is blood water then blood then the
[56:13] spirit the life and then when a baby is
[56:16] born into the kingdom of God it comes
[56:18] the same way water blood spirit
[56:23] sanctification the second stage cleanses
[56:26] the mind and sets the heart in order of
[56:32] Holiness a man can repent of his sin and
[56:36] immoral woman he finds a drunker every
[56:39] time he smell the drink it is still dear
[56:42] but when he gets Sanctified it cleanses
[56:44] the desire out of him it takes the want
[56:47] of it away so if you're a smoker it
[56:50] takes the want of smoking away if you're
[56:52] lusting after woman it take that thing
[56:54] away it can still be tempted but it
[56:57] takes the war of it away he's still not
[57:00] right yet then he is baptized with the
[57:03] Holy Ghost and Fire cleansed burnt out
[57:07] and then put into service for God oh my
[57:11] Hallelujah and we want to look
[57:15] at uh I think we look at the scripture
[57:17] before 1 Thessalonians 3 and Paul was
[57:20] talking about night and day praying
[57:22] exceedingly that we might see your face
[57:25] and that might per what is lacking in
[57:27] your faith now God himself Our Father
[57:29] our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way
[57:31] unto you and the Lord make you to
[57:35] increase and abound in love one towards
[57:39] another and towards all men even as we
[57:43] do towards you and this is this is
[57:47] something else in genuine
[57:49] Christianity you cannot be
[57:52] Sanctified close to God walking the
[57:56] spirit and cannot treat your brethren
[58:00] right something is
[58:02] wrong in other
[58:05] words The Life of Christ upon you will
[58:10] cause you to deal right with your fellow
[58:13] man and I'm not even talking about
[58:15] church folks I'm talking about all man
[58:19] how the Bible say live peaceably as much
[58:23] as possible with all man that is the
[58:26] life of God you're not trying to uh R up
[58:28] the government and R up bring on the
[58:31] press and want to challenge the system
[58:33] that is foolishness that is not the life
[58:35] of Christ because see we don't
[58:38] know what extension and time God has
[58:41] given for the last one to come in the
[58:45] scripture we read where God talking
[58:46] about harot and how prostitute
[58:49] themselves and what not and yet you're
[58:51] looking for that to return and and and
[58:53] to love I'm your husband you could see
[58:57] the compassion God deals with the mercy
[59:01] God deals with you could see it now why
[59:05] when they caught a woman in adultery and
[59:07] they quot the law and said Moses said to
[59:09] Stone this woman and Jesus could could
[59:12] write on the ground say which one of you
[59:13] without him cast the first stone woman
[59:16] no more you could see how he came to
[59:19] amend the
[59:20] book you could see how he came to heal H
[59:24] Hearts now
[59:26] I know there are people and ministers
[59:28] that manipulate when people fall and sin
[59:31] to control them hold them under grip God
[59:34] never did that when God free you he say
[59:37] who the son of man set free is free
[59:38] indeed I don't care what you have done
[59:40] in your past I don't care what you have
[59:43] been through when God free you you are
[59:45] free even the woman at the well when God
[59:48] freed her she could tell everybody come
[59:49] see a man there's no shame in your past
[59:53] your past is your past your past will
[59:55] determine your future
[59:56] is your choices and decision will
[59:58] determine your future your choice to
[1:00:00] repent your choice to get it right your
[1:00:02] choice to do the right thing because
[1:00:04] thou has chosen your decision and your
[1:00:07] decision tonight in receiving what is
[1:00:10] being spoken here tonight will affect
[1:00:12] your future as a Christian because this
[1:00:14] is something you accept or reject not as
[1:00:16] a thought but as something to apply oh
[1:00:20] blessed be the name of the Lord so Paul
[1:00:23] says and the Lord make to increase and
[1:00:25] ab in love towards one another and
[1:00:27] towards all men even as we do towards
[1:00:29] you to the end that he may establish
[1:00:32] your hearts one unblameable in
[1:00:36] Holiness before God even our father at
[1:00:39] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:00:40] all his Saints
[1:00:43] Hallelujah and and this is um chapter
[1:00:46] one
[1:00:47] furthermore okay all right yes chapter 4
[1:00:50] this is this istion of I don't think we
[1:00:53] had read this one 1 Thessalonians
[1:00:54] chapter 4 and this is verse one
[1:00:57] furthermore then we beseech you Brethren
[1:01:00] and exalt you by the Lord Jesus that as
[1:01:03] you have received of us how you ought to
[1:01:07] walk and to please God so that you are
[1:01:09] bound more and more for you know what
[1:01:12] Commandments we give you by the Lord
[1:01:14] Jesus for this is the will of God now
[1:01:18] this is Holy Ghost people talking to you
[1:01:20] this is the will of God even your
[1:01:23] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:01:26] from fornication and this is the verse I
[1:01:28] want to get to that every one of you
[1:01:31] should know how to possess his vessel in
[1:01:36] sanctification and in honor in other
[1:01:38] words you have a choice of how you deal
[1:01:42] with your body how you manage the issues
[1:01:46] in your body The Desires in your flesh
[1:01:49] desires of your spirit he's saying that
[1:01:52] everyone supposed to know their system
[1:01:56] what will affect you what will bother
[1:01:59] you remember the girl lady who she used
[1:02:02] to drink and smoke and in the bar and so
[1:02:04] on she came to the Lord she the Lord and
[1:02:06] what not she's walking on the road one
[1:02:08] day and something tell her why why you
[1:02:11] go inside there and
[1:02:13] testify and was the devil setting her up
[1:02:16] so she going back there next minute she
[1:02:18] on the floor she messed up next minute
[1:02:21] is demons upon her life because she
[1:02:24] actually leave her environment and went
[1:02:26] into the enemy camp so to
[1:02:29] speak so so in other words she if she
[1:02:32] was aware of her response in going that
[1:02:36] atmosphere she never go near there I
[1:02:38] guess when you see sin you run when you
[1:02:40] see drama coming and you can't deal with
[1:02:42] it run that what Joseph did ptif wife
[1:02:46] make a big move on Joseph and Joseph
[1:02:47] just run for his life I guess other
[1:02:51] brother say running sound like a man and
[1:02:54] you fall Like a Man Too Adam fell
[1:02:56] without one woman extra woman Inside the
[1:02:59] G and he fell he fell because he dis
[1:03:04] belief okay so so we want to stay
[1:03:07] straight with that word so Bible says
[1:03:09] here now that every one of you should
[1:03:12] know how to possess his vessel in
[1:03:14] sanctification and honor not in the lust
[1:03:17] of concus spicant even as the Gentiles
[1:03:20] which know not God so Paul keep comp he
[1:03:25] he's comparing listen you cannot operate
[1:03:28] presently as if you were living as in
[1:03:30] the past that no man go beyond and the
[1:03:33] his brother in any matter because that
[1:03:35] the Lord is the Avenger of all such that
[1:03:37] we have for warn you and testify for God
[1:03:41] has not called us under uncleanness but
[1:03:43] under
[1:03:44] Holiness God has not called us to
[1:03:47] uncleanness but under Holiness in the
[1:03:49] Amplified verse three says this is the
[1:03:51] will of God that you should be
[1:03:52] consecrated separated set apart for pure
[1:03:56] and holy living that you should abstain
[1:03:58] and Shrink from all sexual vice that
[1:04:01] each one of you should know how to
[1:04:04] possess control manage his own body in
[1:04:08] consecration Purity separated from
[1:04:11] things profane
[1:04:13] and and to be used in The Passion of
[1:04:16] lust like the Heathen who are ignorant
[1:04:18] of the true God and have no knowledge of
[1:04:21] his will oh blessed be the name of the
[1:04:24] Lord W keep along again we on the home
[1:04:27] stretch here now so the Bible says about
[1:04:30] Christ and this is in uh skip down
[1:04:33] chapter 5 of Hebrews 5 Hebrews and verse
[1:04:37] six says and he also in another place
[1:04:38] said thou a priest Forever After the
[1:04:41] order of MDC ver 7even who in the days
[1:04:43] of his flesh when he offered up prayers
[1:04:46] and supplications with strong crying and
[1:04:48] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:04:52] from death and was hden that he feared
[1:04:54] here we go ver eight
[1:04:56] though he was
[1:04:58] son yet learned he
[1:05:01] obedience by the things he
[1:05:04] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:05:08] became author of Eternal salvation unto
[1:05:11] all them that obey him called of God a
[1:05:16] high priest after the order of
[1:05:19] MDC of whom we have many things to say
[1:05:22] and hard to be uttered seeing ye are
[1:05:24] dull of hearing for when the time you
[1:05:26] ought to be teachers you have need of
[1:05:28] one to teach you again which be the
[1:05:31] first principles of the Oracles of God
[1:05:33] and I become such as need of milk not
[1:05:36] strong meat I know we read this before
[1:05:38] but everyone that useth milk is
[1:05:39] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:05:41] or he's a babe but strong meat belong it
[1:05:45] to them that are full age even those who
[1:05:48] by reason of use of their senses
[1:05:50] exercised to discern both good of evil
[1:05:54] oh praise God so solid food is for grown
[1:05:57] men for those whose senses and mental
[1:05:59] faculties are trained by
[1:06:03] practice to discriminate and distinguish
[1:06:06] between what is morally good and Noble
[1:06:09] and what is evil and contrary either to
[1:06:12] Divine or human law
[1:06:15] now the life that God wants of
[1:06:20] us is a life of
[1:06:23] growth a life of increase
[1:06:26] a life of
[1:06:27] addition a life of
[1:06:30] fruitfulness a life of
[1:06:32] multiplication a thing that we saying
[1:06:34] again
[1:06:36] tonight your life our
[1:06:39] life the life that God want for us is a
[1:06:44] life of growth a life of
[1:06:47] increase a life of addition a life of
[1:06:52] fruitfulness and
[1:06:54] multiplication and this we could draw
[1:06:57] from second Peter 1 it's a scripture we
[1:07:01] are familiar with but I want you to look
[1:07:03] again and I'm going to read it more
[1:07:04] mostly from the Amplified but I'm read
[1:07:07] this by grace and peace be multiplied
[1:07:08] unto you through the knowledge of God
[1:07:12] and of our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus our
[1:07:14] lord according as his divine power had
[1:07:17] given unto us all things all things
[1:07:21] remember we are well able to take this
[1:07:22] land all things we are well able to
[1:07:24] possess this number all things that
[1:07:27] pertain to life and godliness and the
[1:07:30] channel is through the knowledge of him
[1:07:35] that had called us to glory and virtue
[1:07:38] whereby a given unto us exceeding great
[1:07:42] and precious
[1:07:43] promises that by these you might be
[1:07:47] partakers of his divine nature having
[1:07:50] escaped the corruption that is in this
[1:07:52] world through
[1:07:54] lust and this this here and we take off
[1:07:57] here now in the Amplified by means of
[1:08:00] these he has bestowed on us his precious
[1:08:04] and exceeding great promises so that
[1:08:06] through them you might Escape by flight
[1:08:09] from the moral Decay rotness and
[1:08:11] Corruption that is in the world because
[1:08:14] of cesses lust and greed and become
[1:08:17] sharers and partakers of his divine
[1:08:19] nature so I'm going to go forward in the
[1:08:22] Amplified five verse five for this
[1:08:24] reason
[1:08:26] adding your diligence to the Divine
[1:08:29] promise employ every effort exercising
[1:08:34] your faith to develop virtue so in the
[1:08:38] King James it have an to Faith at virtue
[1:08:40] and virtue knowledge and song but listen
[1:08:42] to how it is placed here
[1:08:44] employ every effort which is giving all
[1:08:48] diligence exercising your Fai to develop
[1:08:52] virtue Excellence resolution Christian
[1:08:55] energy and in exercising virtue develop
[1:08:59] knowledge intelligence and in exercising
[1:09:02] knowledge develop self-control and in
[1:09:05] exercising self-control develop stead
[1:09:08] steadfastness patience endurance and in
[1:09:10] exercising steadfastness develop
[1:09:12] godliness piety and exercising godliness
[1:09:15] develop brotherly affection and in
[1:09:18] exercising brotherly affection develop
[1:09:20] Christian love I like how this is
[1:09:22] phrased because it shows that you are
[1:09:26] actually doing something in in other
[1:09:28] words you are applying what you're
[1:09:31] hearing giving all diligence add add
[1:09:34] you're not just sitting down like a lump
[1:09:36] on a log waiting for things to happen to
[1:09:38] you no you are acting on what God
[1:09:40] promised and verse seven says and in
[1:09:43] exercising godliness develop brotherly
[1:09:46] affection in exercising brotherly
[1:09:48] affection develop Christian love so how
[1:09:51] come somebody could claim to have
[1:09:53] brotherly kindness and there's no
[1:09:54] exercise
[1:09:56] no display when issues come you still
[1:09:59] have a you still have a grudge you don't
[1:10:00] ex can you're just a caral natural
[1:10:03] normal you Vex your Vex you're angry
[1:10:04] angry somebody give you this and you
[1:10:06] can't love somebody who treat you badly
[1:10:08] you don't know they had a bad day they
[1:10:10] get upset and they treat you badly yes
[1:10:12] they're wrong they treat you badly but
[1:10:13] you are called to develop to exercise
[1:10:16] brly love how much times are they did
[1:10:18] somebody say 7 Time s they ask you that
[1:10:21] question how much time shall I forgive
[1:10:22] my brother 70 * 7 yes 797 a
[1:10:27] day and when you could exercise in that
[1:10:30] kind of a way then it's anchored you
[1:10:32] have it brotherly kindness you test it
[1:10:35] you you experience it oh praise the name
[1:10:38] of the Lord blessed be name of the Lord
[1:10:41] all right for for as these qualities are
[1:10:43] yours and increasing among you they will
[1:10:46] keep you from being idle or unfruitful
[1:10:49] into the personal knowledge of our Lord
[1:10:52] Jesus Christ the Messiah whoever lacked
[1:10:54] these qualities is BL
[1:10:56] spiritually shortsighted seeing only
[1:10:58] what is near to him and become oblivious
[1:11:00] to the fact he was cleansed from his old
[1:11:04] sin Hebrews 10:14 you have to find this
[1:11:07] one now read it one verse there for by
[1:11:10] one offering he has perfected forever
[1:11:13] them that are
[1:11:14] Sanctified the Amplified for by one
[1:11:17] single offering he has completely
[1:11:19] forever forever completely cleansed and
[1:11:22] perfected those who are consecrated and
[1:11:25] made
[1:11:26] all right
[1:11:28] we 1 Corinthians 6 911 find this one 1
[1:11:35] Corinthians
[1:11:36] 6 9
[1:11:39] to1 Paul speaks know ye not that the
[1:11:43] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:11:45] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:11:48] fornicators no idolators no adulterers
[1:11:51] no effeminate no abusers of themselves
[1:11:53] with mankind no thieves no Covetous no
[1:11:57] drunkards no revilers no extortioners
[1:12:00] shall inherit the kingdom of God but
[1:12:03] such were some of
[1:12:05] you but you were
[1:12:07] washed read it again such were some of
[1:12:10] you but he are washed but he are
[1:12:14] Sanctified but he are justified in the
[1:12:17] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[1:12:20] of our God be Amplified let's read do
[1:12:23] you know that the unrighteous and the
[1:12:25] doers will not inherit or have any share
[1:12:27] in the kingdom of God do not be deceived
[1:12:30] misled neither the impure or the immoral

[1:12:46] slanderers or extortioners and rubbers
[1:12:48] will inherit or have any share in the
[1:12:51] kingdom of God but some of you were once
[1:12:56] but you were washed clean purified by a
[1:13:00] complete atonement for sin and made free
[1:13:04] from the guilt of sin you were
[1:13:07] consecrated set apart hallowed and you
[1:13:11] were Justified pronounced righteous by
[1:13:14] trusting in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ
[1:13:19] okay first Peter so you R some
[1:13:22] scriptures first Peter one verse there
[1:13:26] 1 Peter 1
[1:13:27] verse2 Peter speaks
[1:13:30] elect according to the for knowledge of
[1:13:32] God the
[1:13:34] Father
[1:13:36] true sanctification of the spirit unto
[1:13:41] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[1:13:43] Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[1:13:46] mother I want to pause the a minute and
[1:13:50] you know there's a familiar scripture in
[1:13:52] Romans 8 talk about who he found he
[1:13:54] called who he call Justified and who he
[1:13:57] justified he already glorified note in
[1:14:00] that scripture it never said anything
[1:14:02] about
[1:14:03] sanctify now justification is of God and
[1:14:08] sanctification and and and glorification
[1:14:10] is of god that is God's job we can't
[1:14:14] justify ourselves we can't glorify our
[1:14:17] glorify ourselves but you see that
[1:14:20] sanctification that sanctification in
[1:14:22] that slot is where we are at is is what
[1:14:25] we could work out is what we could
[1:14:28] attain or achieve or get to so let me
[1:14:32] read this First Peter 1 to be Amplified
[1:14:35] who were chosen and forn of God that's a
[1:14:38] big deal chosen forn and the father and
[1:14:42] consecrated Sanctified made Holy by the
[1:14:47] spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ so
[1:14:51] we want to bring the sanctification
[1:14:55] as it connects to obedience let me say
[1:14:57] it again we want to share with you
[1:15:01] sanctification as it connects to
[1:15:03] obedience so consecrated Sanctified made
[1:15:07] Holy by the spirit to be
[1:15:10] obedient and 1 Peter 1:22 says seeing
[1:15:13] you have purified your
[1:15:15] souls in obeying the truth through the
[1:15:20] spirit unto unfake love of the Brethren
[1:15:24] see that you love one another with a
[1:15:26] pure heart fently oh my I could shout
[1:15:29] here right now because this is genuine
[1:15:31] Christianity this is not no game there's
[1:15:33] not no going down in church and you come
[1:15:35] in and you go you talk to nobody and
[1:15:37] yeah mixing with nobody and you're on
[1:15:38] your own and you you have your own
[1:15:39] problems no there not that they
[1:15:42] Amplified
[1:15:43] since by your obedience to the truth
[1:15:48] through the Holy Spirit you have
[1:15:50] purified your hearts for the sincere
[1:15:54] affection
[1:15:55] of the
[1:15:56] Brethren see that you love one
[1:15:59] another fervently from a pure
[1:16:03] heart and I am almost dear oh praise the
[1:16:08] Lord almost dear it's just 14 pages I
[1:16:11] have and this is now on page 13 so you
[1:16:14] know we almost
[1:16:16] there Hebrews
[1:16:18] 13:4 and I want you to find that
[1:16:21] scripture as we want to wrap up here
[1:16:23] know Hebrews
[1:16:26] 134 that scripture is marriage is
[1:16:29] Honorable in
[1:16:31] all and the bed is
[1:16:33] undefiled but
[1:16:35] hongas and
[1:16:37] adulterers God will
[1:16:39] judge now that word
[1:16:42] undefiled means
[1:16:44] pure
[1:16:45] spotless
[1:16:47] unblemished unspotted
[1:16:50] unsed Immaculate or this this is
[1:16:52] synonyms untan without aain
[1:16:55] undefiled means not made
[1:16:57] corrupt impure or
[1:17:00] unclean not made morally impure now
[1:17:05] there has to be a
[1:17:06] reason that the word will said marriage
[1:17:09] is unble in all and the bed UND
[1:17:13] defile but does UND defile mean anything
[1:17:16] goes I don't think
[1:17:19] so I don't think so at all now the
[1:17:22] reason I'm bringing this because first
[1:17:24] Peter
[1:17:25] 3 1
[1:17:27] to7 the Bible speak about likewise he
[1:17:30] wives being subjection to your own
[1:17:33] husbands own husband not every man that
[1:17:36] if any obey not the word which is your
[1:17:38] husband they also May without the word
[1:17:42] be won by the conversation of their
[1:17:45] wives while they behold your chaste
[1:17:48] conversation or behavior or life coupled
[1:17:50] with fear whose adorning let it not be
[1:17:52] with outward adoring and platin of here
[1:17:55] or wearing of gold or putting on apparel
[1:17:58] but let it be the hidden man man of the
[1:18:00] heart in that which is not corruptible
[1:18:03] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:18:07] Spirit which is in the sight of God a
[1:18:09] great price note sisters this is the
[1:18:12] goal this is the target not your
[1:18:16] clothes not your shoes not your
[1:18:19] hairstyle but the type of spirit who
[1:18:23] fight and after this man in Old Time the
[1:18:27] holy woman also who trusted in God
[1:18:30] adorned themselves being in subject unto
[1:18:33] their own
[1:18:34] husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham
[1:18:37] calling him Lord whose daughters he are
[1:18:39] as long as you do well and not be afraid
[1:18:42] with any amazement likewise he husbands
[1:18:45] there's the part I want to get to dwell
[1:18:48] with them according to
[1:18:51] knowledge give honor unto the wife
[1:18:55] as the weaker vessel and being ears
[1:18:59] together of the grace of life that your
[1:19:02] prayers be not hindered now we are not
[1:19:06] talking about party going people we not
[1:19:08] talking about uh Carnival people or or
[1:19:11] going to fet we talking about Christians
[1:19:13] and here it is you could see the
[1:19:16] scriptures identify that things could
[1:19:18] happen within a relationship and a
[1:19:20] marriage that prayers are hindered so so
[1:19:24] I am hoping that what we are sharing
[1:19:26] here would even clear that up that you
[1:19:29] as a husband you as a wife a Believer
[1:19:32] you would operate in such a way because
[1:19:34] this is not just for marriage now
[1:19:36] because you as a single person you could
[1:19:38] do things and act in a way that your
[1:19:40] prayer is hindered what you want is when
[1:19:42] you pray God answers what you want is
[1:19:44] when you pray God honors this is what
[1:19:47] you want you don't want your prayer to
[1:19:49] be uh hindered so when the Bible says
[1:19:53] marriage is Honorable and the bed is
[1:19:55] undefiled it doesn't mean anything goes
[1:19:58] because in this age where Hollywood and
[1:20:01] pornography and everything else want to
[1:20:03] Define what people should do or should
[1:20:04] not
[1:20:05] do God expect us to behave right and the
[1:20:09] question brother BR says if there's a
[1:20:11] question don't do it then you're right
[1:20:15] so anytime there come a question in how
[1:20:17] we supposed to behave and act in a
[1:20:19] relationship once there's a question
[1:20:22] don't do it then you're right
[1:20:25] God want a Sanctified life in the truest
[1:20:28] sense oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:31] so Acts 26 and this is about the final
[1:20:35] we get into it acts acts so don't be
[1:20:40] swayed there's a lot of things out there
[1:20:43] that are contrary to God's plan and
[1:20:44] program and I'm seeing this you know
[1:20:47] people have an attitude if the husband
[1:20:48] and wife agree then it's okay well if
[1:20:53] it's not breaking God's law and God's
[1:20:55] word suppose your husband and wife agree
[1:20:57] to the wrong thing is it right no it's
[1:21:00] not right so God doesn't give a free
[1:21:02] blanket bed is on the file therefore we
[1:21:05] could do what we want no make sure
[1:21:08] Hollywood and the people out there not
[1:21:09] directing the show inside your house
[1:21:12] make sure it's not people outside and
[1:21:14] what people doing outside influencing
[1:21:16] your life Acts 26 vers 14 to 18 and when
[1:21:21] we were fall into the Earth I heard a
[1:21:23] voice speaking unto me saying in Hebrew
[1:21:25] tongue Saul
[1:21:26] Saul why persecute thou me it is hard
[1:21:30] for thee to kick against bricks and I
[1:21:31] said who are thou Lord he said I am
[1:21:33] Jesus whom th persecutest but rise stand
[1:21:38] upon thy feet blessed be the name of the
[1:21:40] Lord stand up on thy feet for I have
[1:21:42] appeared unto thee for this purpose to
[1:21:44] make thee a minister and a witness both
[1:21:46] of these things which thou seen and of
[1:21:50] those things in which I will appear unto
[1:21:52] thee here we go delivering thee from the
[1:21:57] people and from the Gentiles unto whom
[1:22:00] now I send thee and this verse I want to
[1:22:03] get to now to open their eyes and to
[1:22:07] turn them from Darkness to light and
[1:22:10] from the power of
[1:22:12] Satan unto
[1:22:14] God that they might receive forgiveness
[1:22:17] of sins and inheritance among them which
[1:22:20] are
[1:22:22] Sanctified by faith that is in me let me
[1:22:25] repeat let me read it again that they
[1:22:27] may receive forgiveness of sins and
[1:22:30] inheritance among them which are
[1:22:33] Sanctified by what by faith that is in
[1:22:38] me and we close with this tonight 2
[1:22:41] Corinthians 7:1 and this captures the
[1:22:45] part that we have to play to be in this
[1:22:48] glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle
[1:22:51] this is not the pastor p and you love
[1:22:55] your pastor and and you know you you
[1:22:57] stay with your pastor you see you're
[1:22:58] true this is not that okay this is not
[1:23:00] that this is Paul 2 Corinthians 7
[1:23:04] verse1 and maybe we could read this
[1:23:07] together 34 if you find it 34 having
[1:23:11] therefore these promises dearly beloved
[1:23:14] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[1:23:18] filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[1:23:21] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[1:23:25] amen and he Amplified it says therefore
[1:23:28] since these great promises are ours
[1:23:31] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:23:35] everything that contaminates and defiles
[1:23:40] body and spirit and bring our
[1:23:44] consecration to completeness in the
[1:23:47] reverential fear of God oh blessed be
[1:23:51] the name of the Lord friends
[1:23:54] I trust
[1:23:56] tonight that you get an infusion of how
[1:24:00] God sees this
[1:24:02] bride how God sees his
[1:24:05] wife and why the scripture says his wife
[1:24:09] had made herself
[1:24:11] ready there are things that we are
[1:24:13] called to
[1:24:14] do you know brother saying make yourself
[1:24:17] a Christian he also say many people say
[1:24:20] God could take this Spirit from me and
[1:24:21] that Spirit from me said but there's
[1:24:22] something you have to do
[1:24:25] so when they were coming to the
[1:24:28] Wilderness as we close they were fed
[1:24:31] Mana they were fed meat they were given
[1:24:34] water on the Rock but when they come
[1:24:37] into the land Mana ceased nothing fallen
[1:24:39] from Heaven anymore have to plant have
[1:24:43] to toil have to fight have to cut them
[1:24:46] the ground he said them little by
[1:24:48] literally possessed the
[1:24:50] land I want you
[1:24:52] tonight to take this ground of was
[1:24:54] presented tonight little by little see
[1:24:57] what God requires of the church he's
[1:25:00] going to have a glorious Church Without
[1:25:02] spot without wrinkle not because I say
[1:25:05] so but because he said
[1:25:08] so nothing will stop that
[1:25:11] church just as an anas and saf perished
[1:25:16] because he was going to keep that church
[1:25:17] clean it's come another church that
[1:25:19] people will
[1:25:20] die just like today people don't want to
[1:25:23] apply what is applied to them concerning
[1:25:26] the Corona virus they will die some will
[1:25:28] die some will get sick you have a choice
[1:25:32] you either be on the size of the virus
[1:25:33] or the side of the vaccine there's in
[1:25:35] between I told someone I said you could
[1:25:37] make
[1:25:38] Style by saying you're not taking any
[1:25:40] vaccine or you chase the you have a
[1:25:42] choice and you have a choice big deal

[1:26:04] you find yourself driven and you find
[1:26:06] yourself needing a helping hand you

[1:27:22] seems like there's no change and
[1:27:24] sometimes is a difficult for us to look
[1:27:26] and see that it is tough to see them in
[1:27:30] their Rebellion to see them in their bad
[1:27:32] attitude not just in church but towards
[1:27:35] their husbands towards wives towards
[1:27:38] things in
