alive in the Sons and Daughters of the Living God let the redeemed of the Lord say so oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'd like to greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ before you take your seats if we could just go to one portion of scripture just to greet you before the minister comes to speak to us this morning reading from St Mark 16 and reading from verse one St Mark 16 verse one and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salomi had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early [Music] [Music] bless every sister touch every family Lord bless each one that's here both in the sanctuary those that are connected on the internet father may you have your perfect way in this service this morning may you anoint brother stephanus One More Time Lord we thank you for the love gift that you have sent our way Lord we have been so blessed on Friday so blessed last night and Lord we are under great expectation to go even higher this morning Lord we know the season is upon us we know that time is short and we know that all things are ready Lord the countdown is on the time is here so father may you anoint your servant may you anoint your people may you anoint your musicians Lord may you be with each one in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning and happy Easter he is risen he is risen he's alive forever more if there was ever a reason to shout it's today if there ever was a reason to worship it's today if there ever was a time to be reminded that God is a god of the impossible it's Easter Sunday morning and I trust you're not in church just because it's Easter but because you have a revelation that we are in a time of the resurrection and we are in the time of a change that's about to happen where this Mortal will put on immortality and because he rose from the dead we are also promised some transformation in our own lives because he said because I live you are going to live also so the promise was not just about him being raised from the dead but the promise is unto you and to your children we shall be changed uh oh there's going to be an exchange of your sadness for gladness there's going to be a exchange of your sorrow into joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's going to be an exchange from depression and frustration into Joy oh there's going to be an exchange of the frown on your face a smile and there's going to be an exchange of your doubt of Faith there's going to be an exchange of your sickness into being healed there's going to be an exchange of you being a church member into a body into the Bride of Jesus Christ there's going to be a transformation of young people who are just coming to church to young people who are the Bride of Jesus Christ who will stand under pressure you may be seated oh and we heard it last night overcoming in the absence Hallelujah overcoming when you're alone overcoming when the pastor is not there overcoming when the Elder is not there overcoming when the Deacon is not there overcoming when mommy is not there overcoming when you feel all alone Hallelujah overcoming when all hell is against you overcoming as David said if I make my bed in hell it doesn't matter where you find me it doesn't matter what I'm going through God has giving you a backbone and a spine that you can res resist every obstacle every challenge every problem you may be seated and what gives us the power to do this is not our own strength it's because he did it Easter proved it was possible Easter proved that you could be dead and something raises you up again Hallelujah before Easter I could understand you will wonder if it is possible but Easter settled the question Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm not the preacher this morning how many appreciate our precious brother stephanus what a gift what a love gift that God sent our way and to to have been blessed by the services and then by the yadel dropping in and uh bringing his greetings and how it all tie together and how we see the Lord in control so we thank the Lord so on behalf of the pastor as you know he's in Ivory Coast he would have preached yesterday and I saw the message yesterday and uh he spoke this morning so I want to greet you on behalf of the pastor and certainly welcome you to the house of the Lord Brother surra s Andie so good to see you God bless you happy to have you with us this morning amen all of the visitors in our gates sister Joe sister Jo and Blackman they hiding there in the corner there You Can't Hide You Can't Hide I'm not going to allow you to hide you know there's no hiding in the presence of the Lord he is he wants to make everybody feel com comfortable he wants everybody to be welcome in his presence we serve a welcoming God you know we serve a God who who wants to meet you as an individual and speak to you as an individual we are not here to hear man we are here to hear from God hallelujah my desire is that ministers be microphones so God can speak through we don't have our thoughts we don't have our ideas we just want to be the microphone and be so surrender that God could speak and only what he once said is what is said because that's what is needed the spoken word as the original seed to call your name from in the book and the church say Amen so before brother stephanus comes brother Nicholas do we have the recording so I really want to appreciate my friend and brother brother Jonathan krena who sent me this clip and I just wanted to share it with the church just a few minutes uh God bless you [Music] but when God raised up his son on Easter morning it proved it and he sent the Holy Ghost and we've got the receipt of it now but I can hear him scream from eternity because I live ye live also amen that's right because I live you live also amen or he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed you don't have to die before your time comes because he lives you live also Death Shall smother out my breath I'll still be living he that heareth my words and believeth on him and sent me has everlasting life and shall never come to the Judgment but pass from death and life I am the resurrection life sayith God he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die I anchor my soul right there no wonder the poet wrote on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection share when his Chosen One Shall Gather do their home beyond the sky when the rose Called Up Yonder I'll be there why living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh Glorious Day I can see my shoulders stooping my arms where they used to be muscles are getting fattened and oh I see I'm I'm dying I don't know how long it'll be before he'll call me but I've got eternal life in here because he died for me that he might redeem this that I have offered to him some glorious day he's coming I believe it with all my heart I'll stay at the battlefield by his grace I'll preach pray for the sick until Death Shall Set Me Free and then go home a crown to wear for he paid for it gave it freely God Justified my belief when he raised up Jesus then I have a crown waiting 40 days after he had visited his disciples he's standing out on the mountain you know gravitation is what

end for I have been transformed by the blood of the Lamb what a song what a testimony praise the Lord I believe the redeemed can say so amen amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord and so what can we say Amen knowing that we are imperfect in our human flesh but at what's God like to use brother brah says he likes to use empty human vessels praise the lord they're not perfect yet they are not full yet but he says I like to fill them up praise the Lord at Pentecost he filled them up and he said I like to fill them up and shake the whole world Amen the world of your own the world around you and shake the world praise the Lord and I believe that's what he's doing the promise is there amen and one day Isaiah amen he had a desire when he fall usah was was a good King and they had much Fellowship together and they were Fellowship together and but uh somehow usah get out of the way and and it really touched Isaiah and his heart and he said where can I go but unto the Lord and he went into the temple of God and God opened a vision for him God opened the word to him he gave him he gave Isaiah a vision and when Isaiah saw a vision of the king of glory sitting on the throne after perhaps a resurrection when asiah saw that Vision praise the Lord of him on the throne praise the Lord he said I'm am unclean I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell among men of unclean lips praise the Lord but God sent an angel down here with a coal of fire and he touched the lips and then Isaiah was ready for commission who shall I send Lord sent me praise the Lord when we get a revelation when we get a open vision of Calvary of the king of King sitting on the throne praise the Lord he takes all our sin away praise the Lord and then he sends you with a commission praise the Lord amen so I just wanted to say that I couldn't say that yesterday evening amen praise the Lord and what can we say about yesterday evening praise praise the Lord about the presence of God and uh and it humbles me to see how the presence of God is in the midst among his people amen and how he's working and doing a work of Grace in our lives praise touching Us Praise the Lord changing us transforming us from Glory unto Glory unto glory amen praise the Lord so we have been speaking yesterday about the absence and finishing of the absence and the presence of God was there and um and that was my burden for the presence of the Lord to drop down and I took it from Isaiah and where where because he came in the presence of the Lord and the Lord has touched him praise the Lord in the presence of the L of the of this of this light praise the Lord in his presence a change happened and as was my desire and I couldn't finish the message going to Isaiah and picking it out praise the Lord and I don't I won't have to go there this morning but praise the Lord but with this desire and that I had had that on my heart for yesterday evening and the Lord so be beautifully visited us with his presence yesterday we just want to give him the credit and the thanks and all the glory and um now before I go into the uh Easter message and Sunday message and and we went out with brother yel and there was laying the message of brother brandham the presence of God and brother oit has it on his desk there and you might know about it it's laying already since a few months I heard and uh brother yel he came and he said brother Stefanos I want to show you something he said and he opened up the message in the presence of the Lord and he said you see here at the beginning of the message brother brandham interrupts the message and he says I want to insert something in the message in the presence of the Lord and um and and he showed me and he said there was a missing part of the countdown and brother Brandon was preaching the countdown in the morning and so in the in 8 hours after he preached the message he inserted a few things in the message to countdown and while he was preaching the message in the pressence he said I have something I've have inserted in the morning's message of the countdown and he brought it back to the church and little did he know that praise the Lord in the morning yesterday morning actually When I Was preparing I was supposed to preach two times and brother Isaac asked me can I preach the third time and I was in the morning I was in the studying and the Lord put on my heart preach countdown praise inserted in the presence of God preach countdown this morning praise the Lord because the resurrection of Jesus Christ speaks about a countdown it speaks about another countdown it speaks about a countdown of Life praise the Lord and it was so beautiful laid out and confirmed and so I have this morning the opportunity and the burden and the and what God put on my heart to speak about the countdown and my my tit my title this morning is finishing the countdown of life because there's many countdowns in life but there's one countdown of the life there's countdowns of death there's countdowns of destructions and there's many countdown and tomorrow this morning I want to go into it and speak about different countdowns to find out about countdowns but there's one countdown of life and he choose a bride at the end of the ages to finish that countdown and you are the bride to finish a countdown the countdown is on but there's an end coming to the countdown praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord so life is full of countdowns and so praise the Lord and uh countdowns when we look at the tree and especially in our in in in Europe where we are we have the winter we have we have the trees and brother brandom had the same the snow is coming and when it's getting cold the sub of the tree has to go down in the root otherwise it would kill the the tree it would explode actually praise the Lord so brother Bram speaks about it he says in the in in springtime the sub is coming up again it speaks about a resurrection it speaks about a life but in the natural life it's a countdown till Autumn because it Springs up but in Autumn it will die again the sub will go down again so it's a countown of life but there's another countdown in Autumn another countdown starts when the leaves are falling down when there's no more fruits on the tree and the life is going back in the root there's another countdown that starts in the root and a countdown is back to life the countdown is spring is coming and one day spring is there then the countdown is over let that what has pressed praise the Lord praise the Lord and the leaves spring up so every has a countdown and when we see a resurrection this morning the sun rising praise the Lord it there's a countdown to it the sun rises in the morning it goes down in the evening there's a span of time for the rising of the Sun and when the sun is gone away there's another countdown for a resurrection of life so we see all things up by a countdown and many things up by a countdown so we want to go in the countdown in the context of Easter praise the Lord amen and surely appreciate from my brother Jonathan and he sends his greetings to the congregation as the church the same and um and appreciate the words he picked up from the prophet and it's so beautifully to hear the prophet speaking this words it gives us praise the Lord he gives us Fai someday is coming Hallelujah the countdown is on because of Calvary so let's stand to our feet I want to turn to Luke 24 and before we read a word I want to um go through the author of the word and just speak to him dear heavenly father it's a privilege father on a resurrection morning Father to speak about you father and to take your words take the words of Life father Lord and bring it to the people Lord the hearts of the people Lord Jesus father I pray that you anointed father in a special way to the hearts of the believer father May a resurrection father from any crave father be this there this morning Father Lord

this morning may you bless your word now father may your anointing father May the power of this word come forth in jesus' name we pray and ask the amen and amen Luke 4 verse one now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the Sepulcher and bringing the spices which they had prepared in a certain other with them and we have read this this morning brother Isaac and they found the stone rolled away from the sep and and they entered in and found not the de body of Jesus the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed up thereabout behold two men stand by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bow down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead praise the Lord he is not here but he is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee and from that time on I want to say a countdown a new countdown has started praise the Lord and John 14 verse1 praise the Lord and he speaks about that countown we have read it yesterday let not your heart be troubled between the countown ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many manions if it were not so I would have told you I go and prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for for you I will come again the countown has an end I will come again he says and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also praise the Lord you may be seated amen now in in the Easter seal praise the Lord Brother Brenham speaks about a countdown of life and he says he won't come until that sheep is in Praise the Lord there's a countown going on amen and en countown has an end and we are living in the end we're living in the last age and brother Brandon said what is the sign when that countdown is over what is that sign and brother brandham says when the last sheep is in and I'm looking for the last sheep that's coming in maybe here in Trinidad maybe in Ivory Coast maybe in Germany maybe in Swiss wherever it is we are looking for the last sheep is in because then we know the countdown is over because he says everyone has to be in that fold he won't close the door till that last one is in so Minister Brothers I'm sure with you this morning of trying to hunt out that last sheep it might be in Phoenix this morning I don't know but when the last one comes in then the shepherd will close the door praise the Lord then a countdown is over [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] to that Faithful Little Remnant then he says one day after the doors of the Gentiles is closed when is it closed when the last sheep is in when the last sheep is baptized with the Holy Ghost when the last wise virgin is the vessel is full praise the Lord when everything is ready he says the door will be closed oh God will anoint a church then he who is filthy let him filthy still he who is righteous let him be righteous still and who he who is Holy let him still be holy oh and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will take place not only then but he is doing it now praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord are you ready to meet the end of the countdown are you ready Lord make us ready when that anointing strikes home Lord Lord Jesus make us ready think about it that anointing that raised Christ from the dead it will drop in the Church of the Living God but was speaking about that great magnet but talk about an anointing that is striking home it will literally lift you up gravitation will have no hold anymore it has to lose its power because all power is given unto me praise the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah so let's speak about a countown before before we go in the great picture I just want to pick up out a few countdowns and I want to speak about Moses when Israel was in Egyptian now Israel was in Egypt praise the Lord and they were under slavery praise the Lord and they come into by Joseph and they were seeking food and they found a place to live there because they didn't have anything to eat in their country Abraham so they went there and to to have to have food and they started to make a living praise the Lord but there was a promise above Israel praise the Lord there was a promise for the people there was a promise of a countdown there was a promise of a time of space there was a promise of 400 years praise the Lord and over the years amen they started to become slavers and the Kings forgot about the people of Israel about the God and about Joseph they forgot about it and they took Israel as slaves praise the Lord and they were enslaved and in bondage praise the Lord but the countdown was on the countdown was going on the watch was clicking there was a countdown going praise the Lord and that countdown has to come to an end one day praise the Lord and the countdown was for 400 years and the countdown was not only for Israel but the counter was for Egypt as well praise the Lord the counter was for the Earthly Dominion there was a countown for life and there was a countdown for death at the same time praise the Lord and when he came to the end of this great countdown God said I will send a deliverer because it it needs a deliverer to to to stop any countdowns praise the Lord amen so God said I will I will send a deliverer and now and now what happened a Pharaoh got a notice that there's a change going on and and Pharaoh somehow somebody must have told him about a 400 years and Pharaoh got afraid praise the Lord he got in fear he said the deliverer there's a deliverer coming a countdown is on and him a unbeliever he knew that a countdown has to come to an end but Israel was there in their slavery and somehow they forgot the count on praise the Lord but farara knew the count was coming to an end praise the Lord and and what did Farah do he tried to stop the countdown he said kill all babies Age 2 years old because there's the countdown running out praise the Lord so he tried to kill praise the Lord The Young Ones the same thing happened when Jesus came on the scene praise the Lord they knew a countdown what's going on so herodes tried to kill all the young boys age two years old praise the Lord and now in these days another countdown is coming to an end darkness is trying to bring death to the people of God Hallelujah to the young ones praise the Lord but he will not Prevail amen now in that distress in that distress in that in in in that terrible situation of death praise the Lord God sends in this he sends a deliverer praise the Lord and he say I will will make a way praise the Lord and Moses was born and when Moses was born another countdown started for Moses personally praise the Lord when he was aged young zero age he was born God set a countdown in the life of Moses praise the Lord and and he was directed immediately to the King's house to Pharaoh's house to the enemy's house praise the Lord praise the Lord and they started to raise him they started to educate him praise the Lord and I'm sure about it his mother knew about it and they told it around and they sure put some hope in Moses they said we have somebody in in Pharaoh's home and and praise the Lord and say and and they watched him they saw him and it says he is trained in the wisdom of man and the human elements get start operating and sometimes God leads the human elements in a wrong way to prove himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he has his own way of redemption not found by human element He says my thoughts are higher than your thoughts the human thought was one day one day Moses going to take off over Pharaoh's seat he was the successor brother Bram says and it was in the human element they thought he would take over and be the ruler and then will lead them out but God said your way is not my way my way is higher than your way my thoughts are higher than your SS praise the Lord because I have a different way to finish the countdown than human way praise the Lord praise the lord and there was a countown going on in Moses lives and Moses was trained well trained and he knew the promise that was laying over him and he knew one day he has to step out praise the Lord and but with all his knowledge and all his training he got and all his all his trainings he had praise the Lord he came to a place praise the Lord and He Saw how how how the pressure was upon his brothers and his sisters while they were in slavery praise the Lord and he saw how they were pleading and how how they were crying and how they were mourning praise the Lord and he had compassion with them praise the Lord and so what he did he got angry praise the Lord and in his anger he slew one Egyptian praise the Lord with his anger with his human element one Egyptian praise the Lord and God let it happen because he said I have another way Moses I have another way and all the concepts of human elements failed this day all what they s that Redemption would look like failed this day praise the Lord in Jesus time they saw Jesus going to be a deliverer with a mighty arm and he has an army and he will slay the Romans and everything and set Israel fre but Jesus said I come on a different way he said I come in my father's name not in the name of man praise the Lord praise the Lord so God stopped at that day he stopped the mental conception at that day and me time I believe time of mental conceptions of men are over praise the Lord but the time of redemption is in the house of God praise the Lord and so Moses he was there and so Moses when he was when he failed actually with his burden and his anger praise the Lord amen and he went into he he he went into the desert praise the Lord in a place where you think all hope is gone praise the Lord but the Lord said Moses it's not by might Moses it's not by power you have tried it by might Maybe by intellect you have tried it by power but MOS it's by my spirit praise the Lord so Moses finds himself in a desert and in the desert praise the lord it's a place of repentance it's a place of humbling yourself and it's a place of recognizing your failures it's a time to pull away away from the sins of the world and to find Christ probably there in the desert praise the Lord to make some death back sight on on a desert experience Lord to know that we find out we are nothing actually praise the Lord praise the Lord and this is what Isiah actually found out in the temple of God he found out he nothing in the presence of God praise the Lord and sure MOS he went through a process like every believer is going through a process of repentance and praise the Lord and then dedicating himself and then is a place coming of commission praise the Lord so he was in the desert and he humbled himself he recognized his failure amen and uh praise the Lord but the Lord says I will make a way in the desert mosa I am that I am I the same I will make a way in the desert amen and then one day praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord another 40 years in the Des amen another 40 Years of sanctification on the backside of the desert praise the Lord one day the Lord said this countdown of sanctification is over Moses Moses there's another personal uh countdown coming for you now and he said MOS come to the burning bush he says MOS I have an account for you because now you come in your third step praise the Lord now you're coming in your commission Moses Lord I sending you now praise the Lord and now your personal count on of Deliverance is coming MOS come in the presence of God Amen and the burning bush was burning and he says take off your shoes Moses because the ground where you're standing on his Holy Ground praise the Lord and that's what's happening when we come into the presence of God praise the Lord and another countdown has started for Moses praise the Lord amen so God came down in a burning bush amen and Moses after this experience he was ready he was a yielded Wessel that God can use yielded over 40 years in the desert and God started said the time is up now Moses another season has started Moses your final time has come not only your final time but the time for the for the people of Israel praise the Lord amen and from that time on another countdown was for Moses and a great countdown for Israel was coming to an end and another count out for Pharaoh was coming to an end so we see there's a countdowns different countdowns of life and different countdowns of death the death was to Pharaoh but life for Israel praise the Lord speaking about countdowns this morning he praise the Lord and so we see Moses went through three stages of different countdowns for the final climax in his life praise the Lord praise the Lord Lord amen let me move on praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord so here this a example of Moses and then we have another example of a countdown for if we take it for Joshua praise the Lord and Joshua he took the people over into the promised land and the promise was for Joshua to say to say the promise was there he said thy seed shall inherit the gates of all the enemies is that right praise the Lord and when they crossed over Jordan uh count down started for Israel to possess the land praise the Lord and at the same down time this countdown started for Israel to say you shall possess every gate of your enemy at the same time praise the Lord a countdown started for the enemy praise the Lord the countdown started for Jericho's walls to come down and the countown for victory started for Israel praise the Lord a count out was going on after we're crossing the Jordan praise prise the Lord so there's many Chans there's many there's many Jans there's many countdowns in life and um so it's another example and I just want to skip through it because I want to come back to the great countdowns of life amen so there was another countdown praise the Lord with David amen and David was a young man and we yesterday we were speaking about young men's and David was at his father's business praise the Lord he was just keeping the sheep and he was just dedicated to what God sent him to and he was in the in the fields praise the Lord and God said David I have a countdown for you David there's a change of season coming to you David there's a change of your ministry David there's another change coming to your life praise the Lord and God sent a prophet down the dusty road praise the Lord and he sent it down to the house of of of yes praise the Lord and he had many sons praise the Lord and God said there's one son I'm going to make make a change in his life there's one son I'm going to make a change of season praise the Lord and a prophet was looking for a son where a change season will change praise the Lord so we was going down and he says I I I'm finding he said yes I'm I'm trying to find I have a commission from the Lord I'm finding the next king praise the Lord and so he came up with all the sons of yes and they came up and he say when we know the story how it goes he says no it is not this one that's not this one but there's oneall there's one more is there one more and yes said yes there is one more there's one more on the fields there's one more on the desert praise the Lord and and Samuel said call him up call him up call call his son and his name was David and little did David know that day will be a different day than all the days of his life praise the Lord little did he know that from that day on something else got a hold of his life praise the Lord [Music] [Music] praise the Lord destruction set in into Israel but there was a time coming for a king a king after my own heart a king that will rule in the way I would like to rule praise the Lord Like a Shepherd to the Sheep praise the Lord but David was going in his time David was going in his season so David was going in his place like we are going in our times of Life praise the Lord like we are walking in our countdown praise the Lord and David was walking and David had Temptations David had trials David had tests praise the Lord in the countdown praise the Lord in the countdown a bear came along in the countdown a lion came along praise the Lord but David slew the bear because the anointing of God was upon him he was getting a training praise the Lord praise the Lord the lion was coming he slew the lion because the anointing of God was in with him in the time of countdown praise the Lord in the time of countdown God is with you he said I will be with you I will be in you in your times of troubles in your times of test but I will prevail the lion of the tribe of Judah prevails in your life in the time of your countdown praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Father thank you Lord praise the Lord and a greater test came into the life of David the greater test are came praise the Lord here stands golas golas was a test he was a great test because golas was testing the word of God praise the Lord any enemy tries to challenge the word of God you stand on the word of God don't defile the armies of the Living God praise the Lord if the enemy is not coming against you golad didn't came after after death David golad didn't came after David gol golad didn't came after the anointed ones but golad was coming after the word he was challenging the word but the anointing was on David and the anointing said I cannot stand this this is the word of God and it's true I stand in the word of God and the word of God in the anointing of God came together on a day and the was running for golad the counter of death was running on golad because he was challenging the word of God but the anointing was in the house the word of God was in the house and David took a slang and said this day I'm going to slay your head and a countdown was going five stones but with the first Zone he hit Satan in the head praise the Lord praise the Lord and golas was finished praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord there's a countown to any enemy in your life there's a countown to it count it down count it down because the word of God is a sure word of Prophecy it shall Prevail and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it praise the Lord hallelujah brother PR says the word is in the pride you stand on the word you watch the anointing fall upon you it will prevail every enemy every cage thank you [Applause] Jesus and God said God said I God said David I need I want more character praise the Lord because he says power without character is satanic so David I want to challenge you a little bit more and he said there's another challenge he said your own King your own King's going to be your test your own self is going to be your test salul is going to be your test maybe your brother is going to be your test I don't care praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord and Saul tried to kill him Saul tried to kill David that's the greatest test before your countdown is over Hallelujah and the demon say if they only get brotherly kindness don't let them get [Music] [Applause] us and David was tested upon his brotherly kindness to Saul do you love him Al he will slay you he wants to slay you David he wants to kill you you still love him and the count on was son and David knew don't touch the anointed ones of God because it's God's timing David didn't interfere in God's program he had a confidence he said the one who gives the promise he will fulfill it in its time and it season but he knew his countdown was also coming to an end am but he wasn't pushing himself hallu he wasn't trying himself because he had experienced that Spirit That Came Upon David it was the spirit of adoption and David was experienced the spirit of adoption is protecting him he's comforting him he's guiding him he's leading him he's leading the slingshot he's giving the power everything lays in this anointing praise the Lord and David was walking in this anointing andto his adoption and he knew one day he's going to hit adoption praise the Lord one day the countdown is over praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah do you love the Lord praise the [Applause] Lord God I was just speaking about a few countdowns forgive me I could have count gone in the count of is Israel when the countdown of pharel was over and the people of God were delivered praise the Lord amen but I left it out because I want to come to a greater picture I want to come to the first countdown that ever started on this Earth because this countdown is coming to an end and it might be closer than you think my brother my sister Adam was created in the image of God man and female together a Unity Spirit man and God made Adam a theophan he made him complete he made him Eternal he made him in his image male and female together no countdown Eternal no countdown and we are coming back to a time where the angel is standing on the water and on the floor seven sun will out their voices and the angel will Proclaim time shall be no more the times of any countdowns of life is over the great countdown of God it's a countdown for some for Less to the glory of God but for all us it's the time the the time the countown for life praise the Lord so God made him Man In His Image and let's skip to Genesis 2 praise the Lord in question and answers brother brandham said and he and he said what happened actually between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 and when God brought the man a little lower down and put him in animal life that this body just like the animal so that he could still that he could till the soil and could touch that teop up there in Genesis one doesn't touch it doesn't see it doesn't smell it doesn't hear they don't have this senses the tany don't have this human senses of reasoning of imagination is over when we come back to that tan imagination is over reasoning is over praise the Lord affection is over praise the Lord because the time of all these five senses has run out and we are coming back to that but God had a story to unfold in a time of season praise the Lord in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother BR says God's intention for his creation man is to express his words praise the Lord the words that he had already in his mind and God spoke it and God had an intention for his words to be fulfilled that's why he put a he put He had an intent ition for creation in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed and the word is eternal my words shall never fail my words are Eternal praise the Lord now in Genesis 2 we read on verse 14 and the Lord took the man and he put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree in the garden thou may feel freely to eat and then he said but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die the first countdown and it was a countdown for this he says Adam be aware if you start to eat from that tree a countdown starts and he said the same day you eat you're going to die and we know that the day by God Is A Thousand Years praise the Lord Peter picked it up in the New Testament and he spoke about it and a countdown was set in if you do that the countdown is clicking Adam the clock is ticking death is setting in now now you live Eternal by the word of life but if you eat from the other tree let me say from the eat of imagination from the eat of Knowledge from the from the Tree of reasoning if you start to eat from this tree you die the countown is set in the rule was set the law was given now this law was given when Adam was alone a was not there and God gave the Worden and the Lord said it is not good for man that man should be alone I will give him a helpmate for him and brother B says this flesh man was uncomplete because a part of him was still in the theophany praise the Lord now brother Brenham continues look he never went and got dirt and made Eve but he made from the original dirt he made Adam he took a rib from his side and made him a helpman and that was Eve and she was made for the man and part of the man she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in the tany and she was part of him down there in the creation she could not be divided in any other creation she had to be made of that same creation but the word of God already came to the prophet and Adam was a prophet to Eve and he had the word of God for Eve praise the Lord and he gave the word to Eve and he said Eve we can eat of any kind of tree but he said eve don't eat of that tree because in the moment you eat of that tree we're going to surely die praise the Lord he said if he challenged his wife because a prophet must prophesy and she received the word she knew it and a serpent came around sneaking in and the serpent knew that a countown of death were set inallah and the serpent said in to the woman you shall surely not die and he presented a lie to her and if she started to reason she started to imagine why is the minister so much against reasoning imagination you wonder why because it's set in the first count on of death and brother Bram is a quote brother Bram says if you word it's the great riches for her it's the pearl of precious prize she lose all give me that price praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord now we know we know what happened in the garden of Eve and you imagine that God is looking there and it says in the moment she starts to eat of that tree I have to press the B her creator that formed her took the rib he was watching and she took it we know what happened what a prophet revealed to us and God was watching it maybe tears running down if it would have been Jesus tears would have run down in the form of man God was watching it in the moment you eat and he had to press the button now the Clock Was ticking for Eve now here was Eve under a countdown of death and Adam knew the countown was running on her at that time time Adam was not under the countdown and Adam had to make a choice he said I can stay here and not eat of the tree and live Eternal or I can make a choice and follow after Eve brother branam says Adam was not deceived Aiden took a choice but God before he formed Eve when God created Adam Out of the Dust of the earth he says Adam you're created therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cling to his wife it was still the word of God why did God say that am because he wanted to unfold unfold a picture he said there's another countdown going on and he said one day the son of righteousness will come down and he also will make a choice Jesus Christ had a choice to live forever or to go into death and brother Bram said he took the right choice he did the choice to bring a bride back to himself because when he died on the cross of Calvary another countdown started but this time is what it was not a countdown of death 2,000 years ago it was a countdown of life for the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ So Adam in the Garden of Eden representing Christ he was the first Adam he had to make a choice and he made a choice willing he said I will follow my wife because the two shall be one in death and also in Resurrection hallu what a picture Adam will filling you submit himself to the countdown because he knew another Adam will be in the making he shall redeem me at the end praise the Lord so God he was not surprised what was happening no situation on Earth in heaven or under the Earth can ever CAU God by surprise your situation in life never CS God in surprise but God has a plan and God said give me give me another 4,000 years death has set in but God says give me another 4,000 years praise the Lord give me another span of time let me Express the seven C compound names of Jehovah give me a time to express my attributes of a Overcomer of a redeemer of a king of king of a Shepherd give me another 4,000 and another Masterpiece will be in the making the core The Cure was getting ready praise the Lord and we found out the great countdown of deaths was setting in the garden of e Eden but a count on of life for a son to resurrect again was in the making isn't it so praise the Lord praise the Lord so we come down 4,000 years and a great countown of deaths was coming to a climax praise to your 400 years no Prophet but a redeemer Hallelujah the promise for the Redeemer was there laying out in Isaiah's time 400 years Israel was waiting for the Redeemer Hallelujah Israel was waiting for the promised Redeemer Israel Israel was waiting for a countown to come to an end and Israel was waiting for somebody hallu somebody Hallelujah that will come along that will break the countdown the count on of death because death means separation of sin Separation by sin separation to God and Israel was waiting where's the Redeemer when is he coming when is the end coming to the countdown praise the Lord and God was looking for a dedicated vessel and he found one in Mary and Mary we can be so glad Mary said beat unto me Mary did didn't had any reasoning she didn't had any imagination she didn't use her five senses when the Holy Spirit was dropping down when the present of God was coming down but she said be it unto me according to your will according to your word be it unto me praise the Lord praise the Lord and the king of king was born and herodes as I said before found out praise the Lord by some prophets that had a word of God said a king will be born and herodes was aware he said when he is coming my rulership will come to an end and he was afraid of it because he knew another countdown has started in Praise the Lord but did Jesus didn't came for the Natural Life Jesus came for the eternal life praise the Lord Jesus was coming to bring back rulership and to bring back Dominion praise the Lord praise the Lord so now Jesus was on his place Jesus was walking Jesus was walking 30 years and he was tested in all manners of life like David he was tested praise the Lord and Satan came around and Satan knew when he comes around that his time will be finished the time of Satan will be finished praise the Lord and he was testing him if he's the son of God in the wilderness if you are the Son of God are you the one praise the Lord and he was Tess he wanted to find out praise the Lord one day he found out one day but then Satan it was too late your countdown was over praise the Lord and Jesus he went his way and he proved a countdown was over praise the Lord when he went at a cross of Calvary and he died and he cried out it is finished this great watch that started in Eden praise the Lord Death set in in there was no hope no life and Jesus on the cross of Calvary he said it is finished praise the Lord a countdown and he says that's where is thy sting grave where is thy Victory praise the Lord hallelujah and Jesus died and he resurrected on that Resurrection morning and from that time on another countdown has started in and it was a countdown of life he said I am the bread of life he said come unto me all ye that heavy laden and I will give you peace I will give you life if you would know who you were speaking to you will ask him for a trick drink a cup of water and he will give you life eternal and on Resurrection morning the well was open for everyone who wants to come and drink of this well freely praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus whosoever shall come and drink of this Water of Life he shall have life eternal for when brother Branham inserted in the message the presence of God and he inserted the countdown and I went in there this morning and he inserted he said the countdown is seven Church ages and he said seven is the perfect number of God and he said this countdowns have seven voices and Seven Stars hallelujah praise the Lord and they are drawing from that Eternal Source attributes of the Son of God and another count on has started seven Church ages in the making and God took Paul the first star he took him and he laid it out and the countown started one the countown started two arinos the countown started three Martin and the count and started four Colombia the count start at five and Satan knew a countdown was on Satan knew another countdown of life was going to making and Satan said everything I can do I will do something to stop this countdown of Life praise the Lord but at the same time praise the Lord at the same time a countdown of life started for the seed of God at at same time a countdown of death started for Satan one was counting up and the other was counting down praise the Lord a count on of life is counting up seven steps to Perfection a countdown to eternal life back what you have been at the beginning In the Garden of Eden a count on her started when Jesus was resurrected and I count on seven steps up back to eternal life but on the other hand on started for this and the devil tried everything to stop the countown up and he sent four four horse risers he sent into the church and he sent them in trying to get a hold of that life praise the Lord and it looked like he got a hold of it it looked like he could make it and brother brandham said in the exposition of the service seven Church ages he says the birth of the church was at Pentecost and as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a pride pure and fresh at Pentecost the process was on the countdown was on will that Pride will she Prevail and she remained separate and undefiled for some time and of the rest D no man join himself to them acts 413 and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved acts 247 how long this did this continue we don't know now brother BR says but one day even as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist and it became dark in Dark Ages and it looked like all hope was gone it looked like the countdown of Life didn't work it looked like everything was dark everything was pled out everything was finished but it was a prophecy and it took some more years for that prophecy and the prophecy was I will restore says the Lord I will restore all the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worms and the caterpillars and the Palmer worms and my great Army which I sent among you I will restore I will restore because the countown is still running the count on didn't stop the count on just said the seed must have to die to bring more fruit but the secret is in the word and the word is in the bright praise the Lord and it shall come to pass afterwards after that I restored now here comes the life back again praise the Lord a span of time not a span of time and then for Resurrection after I restore it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young man shall see wish and also upon the servants upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit amen praise the Lord it speaks about a time at the end of the count out of life after I restore and he said and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord and we were speaking about the name of the Lord Jesus shall be delivered for in Mount Zan in Mount C in Mount C seven steps in Mount C hallelujah praise the Lord in Mount science and in Jerusalem shall shall be deliverances as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call there shall be Deliverance praise the Lord at the end of the countdown of Life there shall be a Deliverance to life praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord and we have come through seven Church ages the church has come Hallelujah and it looked like again in the days of the Prophet that it's all black and dark because denomination has sent in Praise the Lord Creeds and dogmas has set in and brought brand and dra a little circle of life and he said the countdown is not over yet praise the Lord a little bit more time a a little bit more but I will call a bride for myself and this bride she will not be deceived praise the Lord and he comes down to 63 praise the Lord a Breaking of the seals and another countdown started a final countdown to the great countdown has started praise the Lord praise the Lord at the last round the mystery of God should be finished praise the Lord at the end of the countdown the mystery of God will be finished how long is going the countdown on till the last sheep is back in the fold praise the Lord and we are looking for that last sheep praise the Lord thank you Jesus and that is that great countdown and I want to break it down to a personal countdown in our in our lives in the message the key to the door brother brandom says when I was born into the family of gods amen he says I come by the blood and the blood gives me life death has no more power when the life comes in when light comes in darkness has to flee that's resurrection and then after I become alive in Christ he baptized me with the Holy Ghost and power to be a son of Gods death has no hold hallah sting has no power grave where is thy Victory praise the Lord life has set in in our personal lives a resurrection for a final countdown in our lives when he comes in our lives when the Life of Christ is coming into your life let me tell you this the countdown of death is [Applause] finished it has no more hold the countdown of death that came into e upon Eve's Life In The Garden of Eve of e in the Garden of Eden where he said at that day you shall die and we were living all under that curse all over that death in our lives but when you receive the Holy Ghost death has no more Sting the countdown of death is finished praise the Lord and when the last one hits that spot the great countdown will be over praise the Lord but it starts in our personal lives and I want to break it down for our personal life because if you know you're are no more living under the countdown of death but now you're living under the countdown of life and you are starting counting one two you start to counting up and when you hit that seven steps praise the Lord hallelujah he himself will come down Hallelujah and will take you up into Glory praise the Lord there's a church and there's a pride there's individuals that going to be ready to

King in great chops and many would have looked up and say if I would have a chop like this but they have kept the word of God in their hearts pure unadultered and not mix and he said we cannot bow down to any image we cannot do that King and uh but then one thing is said my God is more than able to deliver me to Deliver Us from your countdown and the King said make the penalty seven times

thank you this morning Lord to be in your presence Lord and for this weekend and for how you have Lord mightily use your son and your servant brother stephanus to preach on Friday Lord and on Saturday and this morning Lord and Lord knowing how much of a burden that takes and how much of an effort and a a physical strain so father we pray there God that you would bless your son and servant Lord abundantly may you touch him in his body from the crown of of his head to the SS of his feet may you anoint his ministry may you bless him his wife his family and the church in Germany as he prepares to fly home tomorrow May the angel of the Lord go with him may you take his ministry even higher may you pour out the Holy Ghost wherever he speaks Lord May Lord a Revival break out in Germany in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father we pray for Lord our pastor on the field also in every Coast father Lord what a time I know that been having may you give him journeying mercies and blessing Lord as he fries out from every Co shortly father Lord and may you bless his service this week as he preaches by Brother Chandler on Wednesday night May you anoint him a fresh to preach over there also Father may you bless the local church here father may you bless every brother every sister the ministers the elders the deacons the trustees the helps and the governments may you be with each son be with each daughter and bring us back at the appointed Time Lord may you bless the fellowship after the service with the brunch Lord and may you bless your sons and daughters as we Lord continue to celebrate and worship and praise you and rejoice in Lord this Resurrection Sunday May you bless the meal that has been prepared father may you bless those that may not be able to stay and may you be with each one and bring us back at the appointed time in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen you may be seated for a few announcements as we prepare to close out you can give keep playing softly my my my what can we say what can we say can we give the Lord one more hand of Praise You know brother stepan said something this evening that just blew my mind and I went back to the scripture because he said that the devil was losing some of his best men so sacrifice so I went back into the scripture in Daniel 3 where the Bible says and Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury the form of his Visage was changed so his whole face start to change when he recognized that these Hebrew boys were not prepared to bow down and these brothers said we are not even careful with how we answer in other words we don't we we really care how you take it we not bowing down we have business as we say we have business we not bowing down and his whole countenance change and the Bible said he commanded the most Mighty Men so he sent his Navy SEAL unit to escort the Hebrew boys down to the fiery furnace so it was a senseless act because in doing that the enemy was so desperate to destroy them that he lost his best soldiers in his attempt to destroy you the devil will lose his best [Applause] [Music] soldiers so the devil hit a self-destruct countdown Hallelujah you imagine why Satan will be so mad when this bride leaves this Earth he will go after the remnant because he recognized he couldn't get you he tried to get you here he tried to get you there he tried to stop you there he tried to stop you there but the Holy Ghost finds you wherever you are and the transforming work of power the Rapture of Revelation in you he could never get to it because it's deep inside of you and brother brandham said for Satan to get there he has to come under the blood and he can never come under the blood he can't access what's under the blood and we are under need the blood where the devil could do us no harm no harm but the random said for the devil to get to you he has to come under the blood and be like your brother but he can never subject himself to that he believes and trembles but the blood is for you the blood is for your family the blood is for your situation the blood is for your healing the blood is for your Redemption Hallelujah so I thinkk I mean I was so I was trying to contain myself you know how I love scriptures so I said let me go and check that out there boy and and and and the Bible said that they walked into the fiery furnace they fell on their feet because they were bound do they arrived there b so the king dealing with his own crisis he said look I lost my best men and then on top of that these men who fell don't bong now they're not even bong no more because they've been loosed Inside the Fire the same fire that was judgment for the world is freedom for the pride because the chains that bound you now you're loose now these brothers shaking hands in the fire the Forman in the fire and they having a Revival the same water that was Noah's Deliverance was the same water that was judgment the same Rapture that's for our Escape is the same rapture that will be judgment to the world I am so happy on this Resurrection Sunday can we give the Lord a shout of Praise Hallelujah I'm going to leave one thing with you before we go we read that scripture where in St Mark he said go your way tell his disciples and the people [Music] Peter disciples and Peter he didn't say disciples and Matthew he didn't say his disciples and John he didn't say his disciples and James he had his disciples and Peter because it was one thing to deal with the grief and The Agony and the loss of Jesus dying but Peter had his own Agony and his grief and his loss because Peter never thought that he would backslide am Peter said I would never deny you Peter never thought that he would be out of Fellowship because it was apparent that the disciples were here and Peter was somewhere here so he said go find your disciples and tell them I'm a li but I want you to go find brother Peter so I don't know if there's a Peter here this morning because Peter became the rock Peter was a he's the one who talk with the Lively stones and shap stones but Peter end up in a bad way because he did something he didn't even expect to do so I want to encourage you this morning he is risen from the dead and God's word this morning is to the disciples and to Peter who would be the one on the day of Pentecost to say these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Malachi for and the church say Amen may the Lord richly bless you so far announcements do remember with the stepanus in prayer as he prepares the journey home tomorrow Lord willing and also remember Pastor in prayer I think they have maybe one more service the close of the Ivory Coast convention and then he flies to London to preach by Brother Chandler and then he's in
