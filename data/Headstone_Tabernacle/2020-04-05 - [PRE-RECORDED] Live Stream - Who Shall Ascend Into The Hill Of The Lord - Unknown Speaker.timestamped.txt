[1:03:41] from said mark chapter 7 1 every from 1
[1:03:45] to 23 we want to read Psalms 24 1 to 6
[1:03:50] and we also want to read Psalms 43 first
[1:03:54] tree and for
[1:04:04] reiden said mark chapter 7 read in verse
[1:04:08] 1 then came together unto him the
[1:04:11] Pharisees and the sitting of the scribes
[1:04:13] which had came from Jerusalem and when
[1:04:16] they saw some of these ciphers eat bread
[1:04:18] but defiled that is the seed with
[1:04:20] unwashen hands they formed for it for
[1:04:24] the Pharisees and all the Jews except
[1:04:26] they wash their hands off to eat not all
[1:04:29] in the tradition of the elders and when
[1:04:31] they come from the market except they
[1:04:34] wash they eat not and many other things
[1:04:35] there be which they had received a whole
[1:04:38] as the washing of cups and pots brazen
[1:04:41] vessels of tables then the Pharisees and
[1:04:45] described asked him why walk not by
[1:04:48] disciples according to the tradition of
[1:04:51] the elders but eat bread with unwashen
[1:04:54] hands he answered and said unto them
[1:04:56] well see had Jesus prophesied of you
[1:04:59] hypocrites as it is written this people
[1:05:02] honoureth me with their lips but their
[1:05:05] heart is far from me albeit in vain do
[1:05:09] they worship Me teaching for doctrines
[1:05:11] the commandments of men for laying aside
[1:05:15] the commandments of God you hold the
[1:05:17] tradition of men as the washing of pots
[1:05:19] and cups and many other such like things
[1:05:22] II do and he said unto them full well
[1:05:25] you reject the commandment of God that
[1:05:27] he may keep your own tradition for Moses
[1:05:30] said honor thy father and thy mother and
[1:05:32] whose of Acoustic father and mother let
[1:05:33] him die the debt but you see if a man
[1:05:36] shall see it is father mother it is :
[1:05:38] that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou
[1:05:41] mightest be profited by he shall be free
[1:05:43] and you suffer him no more to do aught
[1:05:45] for his father or his mother making the
[1:05:48] Word of God of none effect through your
[1:05:50] tradition which you have delivered and
[1:05:52] many such like things do ye and when he
[1:05:55] had called all the people unto hear me
[1:05:57] senator them hearken unto me every one
[1:05:59] of you and understand there is nothing
[1:06:01] from without a man that entering into
[1:06:04] him can defy him
[1:06:05] but the things which come out of him
[1:06:08] those are they that be fired the man if
[1:06:11] any man have ears to hear let him hear
[1:06:14] and when he had entered the house on the
[1:06:16] people his disciples asked him concerned
[1:06:19] a parable he said unto them ie
[1:06:21] so without understanding also do you not
[1:06:24] perceive that whatsoever thing from
[1:06:26] without entering it into the man it
[1:06:28] cannot defile him because it entered not
[1:06:31] into his heart but into his belly and
[1:06:34] going out into the draught personal
[1:06:36] meats he said that which cometh out of
[1:06:39] the man that defileth the man forward in
[1:06:42] out of the heart of men proceed evil
[1:06:44] thoughts adulteries fornications murders
[1:06:48] thefts covetousness wickedness deceit
[1:06:52] lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy
[1:06:55] pride foolishness all these evil things

[1:22:25] you know any Psalm I told by her I don't
[1:22:28] mind my early Christian experience this
[1:22:29] was the first sound I kind of speak the
[1:22:32] whole entire song by heart and now I'm
[1:22:35] preaching on it
[1:22:36] he shall ascend into the hill of the
[1:22:40] Lord
[1:22:40] this scripture can be applied to all
[1:22:43] ages but has a special place in this of
[1:22:47] adoption and manifestation of the sons
[1:22:50] of God hallelujah God there is no holy
[1:22:55] hill it's a holy God on the hill there
[1:23:00] is the holy mountain it's a holy God on

[1:23:09] articles die shoes for the place that he
[1:23:14] was and his holy crown oh there's a
[1:23:18] longish out whenever God comes down
[1:23:22] wherever he comes down that path becomes
[1:23:27] fully Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:23:31] hallelujah give the Lord a shock this
[1:23:34] morning there has always been a holy
[1:23:43] hill or mountain with God met on that
[1:23:47] with man the a crescent moon art when
[1:23:51] Noah act landed and saw the rainbow
[1:23:54] Abram was to sacrifice his son on mount

[2:05:35] what clean hands and clean art Jesus see
[2:05:39] here is pure hearty he ascended and the
[2:05:44] own blood pay the price for all of us we
[2:05:46] know that oh my
[2:05:52] once a Christian life is a public life
[2:05:56] you can privatize your life I live in a
[2:06:01] private life right with my business
[2:06:03] yeah I love this very self-centered
[2:06:13] system that is where the freelancers
[2:06:17] come in dice Vega D the rest of the
[2:06:19] cloth that the centrist leave is part of
[2:06:22] the material but it's not part of the
[2:06:24] pattern where cut so the cloth should
[2:06:27] cut and for long life that is some lives
[2:06:31] scraps remnants come in the church
[2:06:35] reminisce fallen for the corner not part
[2:06:38] of the pattern the shape because you see
[2:06:41] people don't want to be cut and sheep
[2:06:43] notice the privilege that a box and
[2:06:44] instead of boxing is a certain cutter
[2:06:47] said knowing it's broad at the bottom
[2:06:49] but at the cost elite up the claim of
[2:06:52] that hill to go up that mountain
[2:06:55] this pyramid we're talking about here
[2:06:57] faith and virtue and knowledge the time
[2:06:59] up it gets narrow and narrow and people

[2:07:06] who will keep on climbing hallelujah
[2:07:09] this is my life I'll make my own
[2:07:12] decision I think I said something on on
[2:07:21] Wednesday if you don't know he put us

[2:07:27] the past is placed in a position of
[2:07:28] being a watchtower
[2:07:32] ky first prophesy because he was in a
[2:07:34] position as a high priest and the past
[2:07:37] in a position because God put him here
[2:07:38] in a watchtower to look over your souls
[2:07:41] so when you think the pastor se is true
[2:07:45] but guess who seein as god's seal yes
[2:07:50] the pastor seein he's not God he can see

[2:23:33] well I better quit smoking because I
[2:23:35] profess Christianity Gordon I accept it
[2:23:37] you quit lust enough the woman just
[2:23:39] because you are making yourself do it
[2:23:41] God don't accept it if that's your works
[2:23:43] you have to accept Christ then something
[2:23:47] has to work in you to bring you out of
[2:23:50] what you in is not just you stop this
[2:23:51] and you stop this it's the operation of
[2:23:54] God Oh hallelujah
[2:23:57] Ephesians 4 something says this I say
[2:23:59] therefore brethren
[2:24:00] testify in the Lord that he answered
[2:24:02] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[2:24:03] vanity of their mind having the
[2:24:06] understanding darkened being alienated
[2:24:07] from the life of God to the ignorance
[2:24:10] that is in them because of the balance
[2:24:12] of their heart who being past feeling
[2:24:14] have given themselves over the last
[2:24:15] offenses to work all uncleanness with
[2:24:17] greediness but you have not so learned
[2:24:19] Christ so if be you have heard him and
[2:24:22] I've been taught by him as the truth is
[2:24:24] in Jesus that you put off the former
[2:24:26] conversation the old man which is
[2:24:30] corrupt according to the deceitful
[2:24:33] and that would conversation I want to
[2:24:35] get to the habla for you you just ship
[2:24:36] yourselves of your form Anita put off
[2:24:40] and discard your all unrenewed self
[2:24:44] which characterized your previous manner
[2:24:47] of life and becomes corrupt to lust and
[2:24:51] desires that spring from delusion but be
[2:24:55] constantly renewed in the spirit of your
[2:24:57] mind having a fresh mental and spiritual
[2:25:00] attitude you have to do it or glory to
[2:25:04] God not just come to church but have an
[2:25:07] attitude or glory to God hallelujah
[2:25:10] therefore rejecting all falsity and
[2:25:13] being done with it
[2:25:14] let everyone express truth with his
[2:25:16] neighbor be amplified so we are part of
[2:25:18] one another members one of another when
[2:25:21] angry do not sin they will ever let your
[2:25:23] rat your theory lasts until the Sun Goes
[2:25:26] Down leave no room or foothold for the
[2:25:29] devil gives no opportunity for him
[2:25:32] let them that steal steal no more but
[2:25:35] rather let him be industrious making an
[2:25:38] honest living with his own hands so that
[2:25:40] he may be able to give to those in need
[2:25:41] it's more blessed to give than to
[2:25:43] receive
[2:25:44] if you don't have the can't give if you
[2:25:46] don't work it all get in order to give
[2:25:48] you should want to be a giver that we
[2:25:50] don't want to be a get up so you kept in
[2:25:53] order to give not get in order to hold
[2:25:55] for yourselves you know get in order to
[2:25:56] give and the more you give us the more
[2:25:58] give you Oh glory to God hallelujah the
[2:26:03] more you give the more God gives you you

[2:32:38] save you but they will come forth out of
[2:32:40] the sieve life as a fruit unto God I

[2:32:45] not saved he ought to do good works do
[2:32:47] the best he can what a horrible in the
[2:32:49] sight of God for a man to do evil works
[2:32:51] and then see that they are doing the
[2:32:52] will of God that's what the bishop and
[2:32:54] Pope's and high rocky of Rome were doing
