whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me what was worth he love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth one whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you one shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and will see me no more but he shall you see me because I live he shall live also that day you shall know that I'm and my father and he and me and I on you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him now Judas said unto him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou would manifest thyself under us anat onto the world and Jesus went explained jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto Him and make our board with him he that loveth me not keep it not my scenes and the word which he hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you we turn to Matthew chapter 21 or honoré from verse 23 and when he had come unto the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came under him as he was teaching and said by what authority does dog by what authority doest all these things and who gives the DISA thority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if you tell me iein likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things the baptism of John winds was it from heaven or men and the reason within themselves with themselves saying if we shall see from heaven he will say unto us why did you not then believe him but if we shall see of men we fear the people for all hold John as a prophet and they the answered Jesus and said we cannot tell he said unto them neither would tell I you by what authority I do these things but what Tinky a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go walk today into my van ad and he answered and said I will not but after what he repented and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he said answered and said I go sir and went not whether of them Twain did the will of his father they said unto Him the first and jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you for John came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when you have seen it repented not afterwards that you might believe him may God bless this wood you may be seated or this is a powerful scriptures tonight or praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord you love him and serve Him but the title tonight is if you love me that's what Jesus said right he said it in in in verse fifteen of Saint John 14 if you love me keep my Commandments ahktar dattari from there if you love me not returning one of a parable Savva inspiration the will of the Father and this is brother Branham we're saying here dear Jesus help us tonight in these two words as we wait upon D and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us Lord and tender hearts move back all the shocks the thorns thistles let the Blessed sunshine of God fall in upon the word Lord and may we have such a great meeting till there not be an unsaved person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of God doors without the baptism of the Spirit May Day receive it father may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord reveal unveiled to us that we that we will see the plainness of God so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into the discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus so he said that the mystery we supposed to know may it be unveiled and once it's unveil it's to bring the word plane to us that God can be made known to you being me plane to you here what for that we may know how to behave now how to talk how to behave so all the teachings and all the mysteries are not a revelation is to bring you and I into a behavior because talk is talk and the Bible give the parable of these two sons one said I will not and the other one said I will go sir the first son changed his mind and went and do what was supposed to be done the second son said he's willing I'll go so I talked and didn't do it which one did the will of the Father and Jesus busted those hypocrites he busted them and tell them them Hallett's and prostitutes and all kind of people they're gonna get to the kingdom of God before you because it's not a talking thing this is a walking thing he's not walking they're not talking now you have to walk the talk or glory to God you have to walk in this light is that that talking thing is an appointment thing of teaching thing no you've got to come down and to conform yourself to the Word of God if you love me keep my Commandments not talk my Commandments do I ask out in the house do I a man and a house you have to warn to keep his Commandments or you have to want to obey his word that means you content obedience of his word that leader come into obedience to his will and then the blessing of God began to follow you or glory to publicize your walking and God's will hallelujah do believe that let's continue to be born of the Spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit to understand and believe in your heart that Jesus is the Christ and this is this word and no other words can be added to it or taken from it without your name take note of the book of life that's a strong one if you add one printed your tradition take from it he said well Christ Himself said your name shall be robbed of the book of life no gonna skip a little bit you know I'm read it again to be born of the Spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit it's not your doing anything are you doing your thing and you're Christian oh no I believe I'm behaved you believe the words I've got to be him yourself and that will show you a born of the spirits when they could believe and behave yourself in the spirit let's continue Jesus a they must be born again in all to be born again it's letting yourself go and die and the Spirit of Christ coming to you then you are no more yours it is Christ in you the Holy Spirit Paul sighed ideally yet I live you're not i but Christ liveth and me oh praise God now if I told you the spirit of John Dillinger will be me I'll have guns and be an outlaw if I am told you that the spirit of an artist you expect me to paint the picture of an artist if I tell you I'm a Christian and the sweat of Christ is in me then we will do the works of Christ Jesus said in Saint John he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also no excuses no excuses the true churches st. mark 16 in action not in talking in action not an explanation in action in other words this would have to come alive you must want to see the life there must be a place

not preaching a dream tonight we repression of feeling tonight we preaching what the words here tonight or do believe that tonight there is gonna be a revival and Trinidad there's gonna be a 7-ton the

her willing and doing his good pleasure he said never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you that is Jesus and Jesus alone says Jesus alone in the

tree for a god not the land and possession by the own swart neither did they own am save them but thy right hand dynamic and the light of thy countenance because of us fever unto them in that right hand of power are seven stars who according to revelation 1:20 are the 70th messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of God are behind his messengers to every age these messengers trying a team these messengers are in his hand his power and authority is backing them up so when you hear from these messengers you are hearing from the power and authority of God coming through the most of these messengers that's why they fought for to bring back every is default or glory to God because everybody have a word that was lost the world was divided into seven ages and to bring back the fullness of the Holy Ghost you have to bring back the fullness of the word so they have to come and gather all the words that I back in the world to bring down the Holy Ghost the object is to bring back power in the church Claudia Hicks a powerless Church to me somebody God hates don't forget that he hates it he hits a powerless Church the early church was a powerful Church I just met

back on your mega anointing the same power that was in the early church for me alpha church Omega church hallelujah are you with me they go forth with fire this didn't these messengers they go for by the fire and pour the Holy Ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light the reflex is his light they have no light on their own they Kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their spots Isaiah 15 love me it is night for that is when the stars come out it is night of blackness of sin for all even whole world of sin and constantly falling short of glory

said preaching the word is not very big gospel because it would is the seed of the gospel because the gospel to be preached is to be preached with signs and wonders only power of God so when he said

the bride say come because the word and the bride the bride becomes the word the spirit novel upon the bride when that season comes this writ has dried up from all the earth the bride alone will have the spirit she'll be preaching them and there is no more salvation she'll be present to eternal loss people or glory of God you know there will be a space a Jubilee space for whosoever will and after

conductor of the Spirit the conductor less easy to would the capita plug in here and expect going to go to yes you have a student conductor the wires what you put and run is what less you will go through true well God wire is the word the Pentecostal didn't have the wire so when the Holy Ghost fell on them they speak in tongues everything else but they couldn't conform to the word that's why they kind of live all kind of crazy like I still have signs and wonders because that was gifts so he was a prophet to bring the word that we could receive the world so God not taught me to use a gift you using the word in you so any anointed peace at all of them in Matthew 10 with temporary power to go and preach and cast out Devils that was just experience and a blessed me give them because they didn't have the real thing yet until they went in the upper room and God give them permanent power Oh glory to God with that temporary power they was crucified upside on the face across the face their child's the face the issues because I had resident permanent artesian well power Oh glory to God he said he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly is gonna being shall flow rivers of living water that's that courts brother that is life that's the fountain of life and God want to make sure that that's the reason he couldn't produce nothing but just exactly God and if God is in you what more can you be oh my all of God's Son and he said God has manifested in them what was it the spoken word manifested see now all of God's sons must be the same to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like John tree to be born of the water and spirit what does it do it brings you right back here we go into the place where you should have been at the beginning so Adam was supposed to reproduce another son of God another part of house another power man another attribute son of a spirit or glory to God but I don't fell in the flesh and will and end up in sex right and that's what we were born in sin but II chromis to bring us right back to that by you must be born again of the world and the spirit and we couldn't really be effectively born until the full work him and the full spirit came so you send the Prophet about the fullness of the world as you could be truly born correctly or glory to God that we're gonna be in you you are gonna become that word then the spiracle activate the worldís in you then that's the kingdom in you we brought her life Oh hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom in you and the younger power because the kingdom is power the kingdom is like Jesus was talking about the kingdom I'm from the kingdom of God is at hand Oh behold the kingdom is within you he's talking about another world it's another land it's another em all together when they say she is dead he say I grow weaker Oh glory to God your nuts are insane in this world you see them dead in this other way king of Assyria or sleep he's like one weaker when Lazarus Darius I'm glad for your sake I am a deer or Gloria I am glad for your sake that we are not deer we are there when I'm when I was sick no be dead when they go on treaty lazy lazy lazy slates he's not late he's on time he's untying he's got a talk law I've had my damn I better not die and he's on the gillum's of promises he said I am the resurrection I am the life we talk about the dead man on this side but you stole my resurrection in this idea know if digest talk he can't just pop that talk you have to prove that talk I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live he's still talking he's a talking but you have to prove that talk come on on beat not to me somebody I am the res I thought roll away the stone I still talk okay the lone Ashok but when that man said Lazarus come forth that was more than rock brother that was spoken with power Oh hallelujah Lazarus had to come all glory the poor so you have to go beyond the talk manifested the word hallelujah homicide freeze a damn tie up in or a lazier Adam Lazarus nyah pillow yet the Komatsu tap and give clues you can't come out normally I walk out they loosen on let them go you're coming up I don't care how much a family tied up the coming out coming out kiritani drag will say come come come out come on air condition communicable condition come on a depression come on a frustration come on darkness come on sickness come come Oh glory to God he is there he's the same yesterday today and forever Oh glory the glory talk about the super Church you

Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following who is holding the house that's the church we're talking about send not sick still in action I wouldn't wrestle I see it I wouldn't stop till I see it let's go to materialize Oh God hallelujah go we know God William Branham prophesy or glorious there will be a church with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp do we have a show tonight he promised the shout of the king [Music] maybe see said not the morning of the believers nice very hard when - 10 spies come back and then tens like mo got a negative report we can take it cause I am so big and this some work on negative [Music] stories and my Kilimanjaro comeback lead he left shortstop on a box and said we are willing but to take it let's swap the killer was bowling on he's the let's go up at once it was so bad he said no no no no no no and somebody said look at all shorty ain't ugly all I'm Johnson lon old shorty talking about little

obviously expel the sons of Enoch is I'm just a stronger when I first started out I did i half-dead I had dying I just a stronger when I first started out my God God put me here to stand God put me at

the land my land don't mess with my land don't fool with my land don't even step foot on my land is my land don't give me Jacqueline ok the Lord I show these are every place you put your for is yours put your foot somewhere tonight put your foot on miracles put your foot on sighs put your foot on power put your foot on deliverance put your foot on delivers a family put your foot on faith on that [Applause] I'm asleep hallelujah that's the reason of Christ's debt is to bring us right back two sons of God now this brings you right back to the spoken word where we are God's would made manifest you see Jesus said the same thing he that believeth on me who I am I come for the purpose I do to bring a man back to believe the Word of God and take nothing else with it the works that I do he will do also Amanda take the boot Justices see we notice the spoken word when we are God's then we are God's Word made manifest that listen that is how God wants his church is to manifest himself this is God's will this is God's desire hallelujah now watch how can he manifests himself unless his own seed is in that person how can you use your own thoughts and God manifest himself through you how can you take your own belief and say well my pastor teaches my Creed says and so on and whatnot he said then Jesus the data via has nothing to you the works that Jesus did if a man has the seed of God in him and the Spirit of God listen watering that seed so he's bringing the spirit as the water to the seed so if we only have seed alone that can work you need to get the water to the seed and the water is what promised watch what if a man has a seed of gone in him with the Spirit of God watering that seed the same works that Jesus was manifested in Jesus him being the original seed of God his debt brings you back to the original seed of God and if that same spirit was within him is in you then the same works will be manifested so you explain how this gonna be he said the reason we are so much a crash is because how is it scrapheap administers it because they're trying to do the works of Christ without the life of Christ so God connects powered character because the pentecostal feel being gifted and to this day they are still gifted some of the gifts of this didn't meant somehow gift of healing they still have the gifts some of three thousand to twenty thousand to ten thousand big churches and they still gifted but he's not talking about that still the gifts from Pentecostal got a ticket from them this method what is talk mafia is the character and character is not a gift it have different healing different resentment if of wisdom and all kind of gifts if I preach and all that but this is not we're talking about this is not a gift this is character characters that given to you it's built it to your child's intestine your place of trial is what guarantees you to have character [Applause] where is he aiming or not to steal the to to know so people with the live in church that they give them corrupted they want to put up out in the head that not given a character they know all the world all the Bible all the Greek or the Hebrew that's still a given character is when they get out the church and your face their trials and your face intestines and your issues in your family and issues in the home that is what gonna give the character you're getting character sittings outta here look at the word they've all get to face the devil and if you can't say Amen to this this night something wrong with you yeah just remember get that cap and wear it all the Louie is your one character you have to understand you're getting equipped because in Boots you get insured because in equipment the magic isn't badge and everything else to go out and fight so don't let the devil give you fight inside the Berlin you have too much the program's outside take a fight inside the church here they'll both go get fight with me just fight up with the world get the word I'm Ty get the word and press let the word the word is preached and every man every man roster way into it or glory to God hallelujah what I did young let's see if you could wrap up here you see if they want the church start with the Word of God you want the life of God start with the wood of God except the Word of God in its fullness every measure of it and if that is the fullness of God in you then the arena's fallen will produce exactly what's in your garden the real the seed of God is absorbent for this spirit all the nominalism is sticking out or unbelief take up then the holy spirit comes into the gym of life that's Lea in there it produces another seed another son of God is born I'm a Branham because I was born of Charlie and Ella Branham that makes me a brand because I am their seed there are two agreements there sperm together made a season that made me when God and his will becomes one when God spirit what is the seed of God the Word of God it produces God it is not the individual it is called for you are dead you are not yourself no more you reckon ourselves dead hollowed out made them for the seat Jim I know some other ministers fighting me on this minister Jesus Christ tell them did you have dementia Jesus Christ nobody I know how many miseries guys yet it's promised because the five for ministry is not men the fivefold ministry is the Ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of a pasta form of a prophet form of evangelist form of a teacher form of a puzzle in other words it is Christ's ministry in these men it is the full seat Jim in them because that's what Peter had and when he was speaking to Cornelius house when he speak the word he's a one period slate these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word because he had the full germ in him all seven virtues was in him or glory to God hallelujah and he said these things ought to be tested and proven to be in the man you can't preach it after live it I need to prove it you have to test it you've seen a piece of wood there and you think it's solid wood somebody put you on hold you hold your whole thing up goes to it still my skin all inside yeah but look a nice home say and you put your finger would make some take all this already just to know you have patience or temperance oh gosh how about boot is that whole vocal test patient may give you a quick yeah oh wait and when you're waiting you're still waitin anything I started finding waiting too long you know something I write because faith could work with patience for the promise to be confirmed and patients must have it's perfect work and it's a perfectionist patience with an onboard and within for God ha ha ha so God has make you wait and in not waiting discipline on that happen and that happen and that temptation and backfires and that tension but you're waitin and fate what if God told Abraham this I use a cup in 25 years unknown it's a hollow oh yeah there mumbles for 54 years and come back shaky head and see Cody drinkin instead of smoke can he put some mints anymote I'm smoking on back in church you know this year's the yeah this is the year of Jubilee this is 25 years I'm seeing God couldn't do Burma drop a promise on him and let him wait how long 25 years Chuck my promise and recite verses i'ma wait until promise of the Father how long 14 days is it until he didn't tell him when it coming in over George but a Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come so there's a day for you it's coming it's God in demand it's the see Jim like the beginning the spoken word is quads with made manifest then it isn't a man it's a man that died he can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time he's either a son of debt or son of life so if he's a son of that get it over to the devil let him kill it give it over to God I meant that let him kill the devil that's a new running out Hallows yo let God planned his own life in you then it's not you no more it is God oh my so the Holy Spirit come in the form of a dove he come not to my breeding but to a virgin born and then no true this I'm given this life that if you by fate will accept will accept the father all the prophets all the word I will pour my life down upon you and you can't do nothing else but producers in life the same thing that I do what was he made me he made himself a man God has with flesh and well amongst the world's made flesh dwelt among us God spoken would chew a version brought forth her body and in that body come water and spirit the washed by the water of the world and then he went in him and dwelt in him and there comes the life of God manifest himself to Christ he was the Anointed One and then we see he was God's women manifest now he died there we go in order to pay the debt of your high Breeden that's why he died because we're hybrid so you have a PD debt to correct that all right so what's something now my what is it that you could die to yourself until you are normal yourself but we filled with this word believe in his word and then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow and when what and then what is it God manifesting continuing the work of his full Sun his only-begotten that died for a hybrid in life that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of God and true the church my flow there we go the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in Christ Christ was God would made manifest and he died and give his life that he might send the spirit and take his body up and send the spirit back to water and Peter a demon price if we believe it on this right then come the Holy Spirit upon the same word or glory to God then the Bible has got to be in you prophecy the Bible has got to be in he'll say I can take the book and stick it in through that Google surgery and put him out inside you dies only about do this out of you is the Buddha go inside of you so this pyramid is the Bible so when this word going new you have to Bible in you you have to pyramid in you isn't that right then the word is a seed as long and as lean here it won't do no good but when it comes in here it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit the words of God are you ready then visions come power comes humility come all you'll know it all is gone you become nothing Christ become alive you die he lives there it is cause he died I live when I die he lives again oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that believe us the word and spirit absolutely one you don't use your own thinking you don't use your own mind he said the miner was in Christ is in you you are God's living word representative of him here on earth continuing the work oh my the church should be that way so the Bible's manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like disciples the Bible's living again in you so the barb is manifested again like the ears of Christ cause you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was just like Christ was you are a pre decimated see do you believe that are you ready for this big bomb you know and when the rain falls under seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls Oh glory to God hallelujah you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost is come upon you that holy verse is not Pentecostal Holy Ghost is that Luther Holy Ghost is that Wesley Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost itself seven spirits Alleluia what the Prophet released that polios or glory that God there was a vision of rain you're a vision of the seed crying of sin on screen said let's read and then they really begin to fall yes pop up everybody every dream who's Angela sweeten the sink because Rin had to hit that seed and manifest that's sinking

that the dynamics we live or you know and the lower in us alone after fifty something else we just within the dynamics and if we have that in us it will manifest itself if we have that permanent you
