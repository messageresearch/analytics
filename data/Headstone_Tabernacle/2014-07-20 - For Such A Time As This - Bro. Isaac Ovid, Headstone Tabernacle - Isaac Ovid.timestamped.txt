[21:55] Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather

[22:20] you're not where you should be with God
[22:23] I invite you to the altar with myself
[22:26] every one of you to come here and not
[22:28] only only say but to stay until God has
[22:31] cleansed your soul from everything
[22:33] that's unlike him until you go out of
[22:35] here a new person not with a corn
[22:38] plaster on but go out of here with a
[22:40] blood transfusion that purifies your
[22:44] soul and gives you new life and New Hope
[22:47] go out with the baptism of the Holy
[22:49] Spirit can the church say amen that's
[22:52] how I feel this morning that's the kind
[22:55] of service I'm looking for this morning
[22:57] for the house of God to be a House of
[22:59] Deliverance to be a house of correction
[23:02] to be a house of straightening up to get

[23:49] morning

[24:04] pass
[24:08] me you may be seated once more I greet
[24:11] you this morning in the precious name of
[24:13] Jesus Christ this morning and you feel
[24:16] the season has changed I believe
[24:18] anything could happen this morning I
[24:20] want God to just take such control that
[24:23] he will say what he once said and he
[24:24] will do what he wants to do this morning
[24:26] and all we have to do is steep out of
[24:29] the way so that he could step into the
[24:30] way that's why we came here this morning
[24:32] and you brought your worship you brought
[24:34] your sacrifice of praise and that's the
[24:36] right attitude but the brandom said it
[24:38] takes the right attitude to bring the
[24:40] result Hallelujah blessed be the name of
[24:42] the Lord so it's a great honor to be
[24:44] here this morning and have a few
[24:46] announcements and a few things i' like
[24:48] to say before I get to the message this
[24:49] morning but I want you to mark your
[24:51] calendars on Monday September 1st which
[24:54] is the holiday uh independence day is
[24:57] going to fall on
[24:58] August 31st which is a Sunday and we're
[25:00] going to have the holiday the Monday we
[25:02] want to have a church day of fellowship
[25:04] and activities so mark that on your
[25:07] calendar and we'll certainly give you
[25:09] more
[25:10] details in the future in the very near
[25:12] future
[25:13] so friends God without man is still
[25:18] God but man without God is nothing can
[25:22] the church say Amen I'll say that again
[25:25] god without man is still God but man
[25:28] without God is nothing that's how I feel
[25:31] this morning we need God this morning we
[25:33] need that same God that walked with
[25:36] Moses and spoke to Joshua and came to
[25:38] David and comforted Samuel and he was
[25:41] there in the burning bush and he was
[25:42] there as a pillar of fire and he was the
[25:44] presence of the angel with the prophet
[25:46] god without man will always be God but
[25:49] God without man is nothing if you don't
[25:51] know God this morning today is your day
[25:53] this morning I would encourage you to
[25:55] please remember the pastor in prayer as
[25:57] he returns to us in the middle of this
[25:59] week and for those who were here on
[26:01] Thursday night what a tremendous time we
[26:03] had on Thursday
[26:04] night the lord gave me a message to him
[26:07] that overcometh and we took where
[26:09] brother brandom said in order to be an
[26:11] overcomer you have to have something to
[26:14] overcome so if you feel all hell is
[26:16] against you this morning that's a
[26:18] blessing he said the greatest thing you
[26:21] could ever have is the trial the
[26:22] greatest thing you could ever have is a
[26:24] test that's how you know there's
[26:25] something about your life he said there
[26:27] is if there is no test then God has got
[26:29] no touch on your life he has got no ho
[26:31] on your life but if there's a trial and
[26:33] he said the trial and the test and the
[26:35] obstacle it keeps you alive it brings
[26:37] life to you so if if you struggle to be
[26:40] here this morning consider yourself
[26:42] blessed if you struggle to be on fire
[26:44] this morning consider yourself blessed
[26:47] if you woke up and all hell is against
[26:48] you consider yourself blessed the Bible
[26:51] says many are the afflictions of the
[26:53] righteous but the Lord God he will
[26:55] deliver from them all and that's how I
[26:58] heal this morning he is still a
[27:00] deliverer he is still a way maker he is
[27:03] still a Healer he is still a baptizer
[27:06] blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm
[27:09] the happiest man alive this morning to
[27:11] see the Fulfillment of Malachi 47 seal 7
[27:16] ther message this is the happiest time
[27:18] for us this morning Hallelujah if you
[27:21] can see this morning I can yes sir if
[27:24] you don't believe it this morning I
[27:25] believe it because your unbelief is not
[27:28] going to stop God come on Sarah you can
[27:31] laugh all you want this morning who me
[27:34] I'm going to get the Holy Ghost yes you

[27:42] going to have a child yes you yes Sarah
[27:45] you going to have a child after all
[27:47] these years I've been baring in the
[27:49] message it looked at if nothing was
[27:51] going on service after service uh but at
[27:54] the appointed time uh I'm going to come
[27:56] to you according to the time of life and
[27:58] you going to have that child I say s is
[28:01] this the time this morning is this the
[28:03] appointed time this morning is this the
[28:06] time of life for the bride this

[28:22] getting ready to baptize you with fire
[28:25] believe it thou this then be it unto you
[28:28] according to your
[28:29] faith so this service this morning will
[28:32] be a bit different almost two weeks ago
[28:35] on Wednesday July 9th at around 2:00
[28:37] a.m. the lord gave me this message and
[28:40] uh I woke my wife up at 2: a.m. and
[28:42] started to preach
[28:44] amen began to share what the Lord opened
[28:46] to me and later that day I spoke to the
[28:48] Mike Thompson and then I called my dad
[28:50] and so I feel like I've held this
[28:52] message is baby for a long time and this
[28:55] morning with the help of the Holy Spirit
[28:56] and with you in the spirit we're going
[28:58] to try to deliver this baby this morning
[29:01] so this morning this message will be a
[29:03] combination of preaching teaching bible
[29:05] study on Sunday school I have a
[29:08] three-fold purpose this morning for you
[29:10] to catch a genuine revelation of who you
[29:13] are for you to know what you're called
[29:15] to do and to declare that now is the
[29:18] time hallah can the church say Amen as I
[29:22] said on Thursday night there's a
[29:23] difference between dividing the word and
[29:26] rightly dividing the word and I believe
[29:29] that this morning the ministry of the
[29:30] spirit is here to rightly divide the
[29:33] word to minister to the needs of the
[29:35] portion of the Bride under this ministry
[29:37] can the church say
[29:40] Amen so this morning I Stand United with
[29:43] our pastor brother ID I Stand United
[29:45] with brother Anthony and the elders to
[29:47] make a church that would make a Revival
[29:50] if I'm the only one going to be
[29:51] screaming I'll be screaming but I know I
[29:53] got some Soldiers with me this morning I
[29:56] know where brother oit stands I know
[29:58] where brother the Anthony stands I know
[30:00] where the elders stand I know where the
[30:02] deacons stand this morning and I know
[30:04] there are some Sons and Daughters of God
[30:06] here this morning who will make a church
[30:09] that will make a revival can the church
[30:12] say
[30:13] [Music]
[30:14] Amen from a message you may be seated
[30:17] the Mighty God unveiled but the brandom
[30:18] said I'm identified with a group that
[30:21] feels the spirit of God and you feel the
[30:24] spirit of God already here this morning
[30:27] I'm identified with the group that know
[30:29] he's unveiled that knows every mystery
[30:31] has been revealed he said that knows
[30:34] he's the same yesterday today and
[30:36] forever and knows that this is not
[30:39] fanaticism you could call me crazy how
[30:41] much you want young man young woman you
[30:44] might feel your parents dragged you in
[30:45] this morning and why we got to go to
[30:47] church and why we got to do this this
[30:49] crazy bunch of people this is not
[30:51] fanaticism this
[30:53] morning he said it's Jesus Christ the
[30:55] same yesterday today and forever
[30:58] I'm identified with that group today he
[31:01] said yet they're called a bunch of
[31:02] Heretics a bunch of fanaticism but I'm
[31:05] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[31:07] Christ for it's the power of God unto
[31:10] salvation somebody say
[31:12] [Applause]
[31:15] amen I was listening to a message and
[31:17] brother K was saying if they call me
[31:18] Holy Roller if the Holy Spirit tells me
[31:20] to roll I'm going to
[31:22] roll I feel like rolling this morning I
[31:25] feel like having an old time sin killing
[31:28] sky blue Holy Ghost Revival to break the
[31:31] sin off of us to clean the trash out of
[31:33] your life to create a Revival and you
[31:36] are the Revival this
[31:39] morning you may be seated so I believe
[31:42] that we all share the responsibility the
[31:45] burden or the responsibility is not just
[31:47] in the ministry alone we share our
[31:49] responsibility as members or as
[31:52] candidates for the bride body of Jesus
[31:54] Christ to make a church that Jesus
[31:57] Christ can walk into to make the kind of
[32:00] church that brother Branham long to see
[32:02] a church full of power a church to unite
[32:05] with the headstone a church that knows
[32:07] that he's the same yesterday today and
[32:09] forever and I believe with all my heart
[32:12] that we will have that kind of a church
[32:14] so are you ready for the word this
[32:16] morning I'm not going to be too long
[32:18] with you this morning but we're going to
[32:19] have a time this morning so will you
[32:21] stand for the reading of the word this
[32:23] morning with me Hallelujah
[32:28] and we're going to read Esther we're
[32:30] going to go to the Book of Esther this
[32:32] morning Hallelujah GL Glory going to
[32:35] spend some time in there this morning if
[32:38] if you're familiar with the Book of
[32:41] Esther it'll be an experience for you
[32:43] this morning and if you've never read
[32:45] the book of Esther or studied the Book
[32:46] of Esther it'll be an experience this
[32:48] morning amen so we can go to Esther
[32:51] chapter
[32:54] 4 I'm going to read from verse 10
[32:59] and Esther spake unto haac and gave him
[33:02] commandment unto
[33:04] morai all the king's servants and the
[33:07] people of the king's provinces do know
[33:09] that whosoever whether man or woman
[33:12] shall come unto the king into the inner
[33:14] Court who is not called there is one law
[33:17] of his to put him to death except such
[33:20] to whom the king shall hold out the
[33:22] golden scepter that he may live but I
[33:24] have not been called to come in unto the
[33:27] king the these 30 days and they told to
[33:30] morai Esther's words then morai
[33:33] commanded to answer Esther think not
[33:36] with thyself that thou shalt Escape in
[33:39] the King's house more than all the Jews
[33:42] for if thou altogether holdest thy peace
[33:45] at this time then shall their
[33:47] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[33:50] Jews from another place but thou and thy
[33:53] father's house shall be destroyed and
[33:56] who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the
[33:58] kingdom for such a time as this then
[34:01] Esther B them return to return Mori this
[34:04] answer go gather together all the Jews
[34:08] that are present in shushan and fast ye
[34:10] for me and neither eat nor drink three
[34:13] days night or day I also and my maidens
[34:16] will Fast likewise and so will I go in
[34:19] unto the King which is not according to
[34:21] the law and if I perish I perish amen so
[34:25] Mori went his way and did according to
[34:28] all that Esther had commanded him may
[34:30] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[34:32] of his word shall we bow our heads once
[34:34] more Heavenly Father we have read your
[34:36] holy scriptures this morning Father may
[34:38] you breathe life upon it may you take me
[34:40] out of the way completely and may Lord
[34:42] you deliver this message to your church
[34:44] this morning the portion of the Bride
[34:46] here Lord and father May our
[34:48] understanding be open may we lord be
[34:50] delivered and set free Lord and may you
[34:52] fill the Sanctified here this morning
[34:54] Lord and those that are not Sanctified
[34:56] Lord may they run quick to clean up
[34:58] their houses to clean up their lives
[35:00] Lord may you take complete control those
[35:02] who are filled may you refill them this
[35:03] morning Father with the baptism of the
[35:05] Holy Ghost on Fire may you bless us in
[35:07] the name of Jesus Amen and amen you may
[35:10] be seated this morning
[35:12] Hallelujah GL
[35:15] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord so
[35:19] I have a title this
[35:20] morning for such a time as this amen and
[35:26] a subject
[35:28] recognizing who you are what you are
[35:31] called to do and that now is the time
[35:35] amen and my
[35:36] inspiration you should have killed all
[35:41] the
[35:43] amalekites you should have killed all
[35:47] the
[35:48] amalekites so this morning who you are
[35:52] and what you are called to do is for
[35:55] such a time as this amen and in order to
[35:58] receive the Holy Ghost you have to know
[36:00] who you are in order for you to receive
[36:03] anything from God you have to know who
[36:05] you are because only when you know who
[36:08] you are it puts you in a position to
[36:10] make requests from God can the church
[36:12] say Amen so this morning just before I
[36:14] get to my text this morning I want to
[36:16] lay a background by encouraging your
[36:18] faith by saying you are predestinated
[36:20] seeds of God this morning no man could
[36:23] come unless the father called him first
[36:25] so you couldn't even walk into this
[36:26] church unless God call you there are
[36:29] other churches you might have been able
[36:30] to walk into but not this one because no
[36:32] man can come unless the father draws him
[36:34] first so you this morning are
[36:36] predestinated seeds of God it doesn't
[36:39] matter how you feel what happened last
[36:41] night what happened yesterday what
[36:43] happened this morning Let the Rain Fall
[36:45] on the outside it's dry here on the
[36:47] inside this morning you are the final
[36:50] voice to the final age brother brandham
[36:52] said once more the world will hear
[36:55] direct from God and God is going to use
[36:57] you in here this morning yes in your
[36:59] condition in your situation God is going
[37:02] to use you because it will not be you
[37:04] it'll be God in you it'll be Christ in
[37:07] you it'll be the word in you come alive
[37:10] can the church say Amen hallu H this
[37:14] morning you are the manifestation of the
[37:16] prophet's prophecy can the church say
[37:19] Amen from a message Christ is the
[37:21] mystery of God revealed brother brandham
[37:23] said now what are you going to do when
[37:25] you get all that group together
[37:28] where the Revelation is perfectly in
[37:30] Harmony and God expressing it through
[37:33] his word by the same actions the same
[37:36] things that he did making the word
[37:38] manifest he said oh if the church only
[37:40] knew its position amen amen and I say
[37:43] this morning if the church only knows
[37:45] its position and but the B says it will
[37:47] one day then he said then the Rapture is
[37:50] going to go so I believe the church is
[37:52] coming into her position this morning
[37:55] and when the church comes into its
[37:56] position what will it be a short quick
[37:59] message and the Rapture so get ready Get
[38:01] Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get
[38:04] Ready you don't even worry you don't
[38:06] even have to pack a bag you know when
[38:07] you're going on a trip you have to pack
[38:09] your bags and get ready for the trip
[38:10] this trip there's no bag to pack this
[38:13] trip you got to leave all the bags

[43:30] this Anything could happen this morning
[43:33] justification made a way for
[43:35] sanctification sanctification made a way
[43:37] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and

[43:42] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[43:44] down to Perfection back to the word to
[43:47] manifest itself again listen carefully
[43:49] we have one absolute and that absolute

[43:58] absolute your absolute must be the word
[44:01] of God which is Christ which is a
[44:03] message of the hour for hour time and
[44:05] our season
[44:08] I there's too much flesh in this message
[44:11] too much beef in this message too much
[44:13] men's ideas in this message too much
[44:16] Empire Kingdom building in this message
[44:18] Jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[44:20] world it's not of this world Hallelujah
[44:23] this is not brother oit's church this is
[44:25] God's house Hal
[44:29] Hallelujah can the church say Amen this
[44:32] is the house of God this morning
[44:36] amen for such a time as this that's the
[44:39] message this morning for such a time as
[44:41] this you are his Masterpiece God has
[44:45] spent all these years shaping you
[44:47] molding you putting things in place but
[44:50] bam said the same holy ghost that was
[44:52] with the lutherans that Sanctified the
[44:54] Wesleyan that was with the Pentecostals
[44:56] is now present tense setting in order
[44:59] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[45:02] believe that same Holy Ghost is here
[45:04] this morning to set your house in order
[45:06] to set your life in order to clean the
[45:08] trash out so that the Holy Spirit itself
[45:11] can drop down and that box car can be
[45:14] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[45:17] that's what we came here for this
[45:23] morning that's why friends you can't
[45:26] afford to miss Church you can't afford
[45:28] to take this for granted because
[45:30] there'll come a time where we won't be
[45:31] able to gather like this there'll come a
[45:33] time when there'll be a famine and there
[45:35] already is a famine but it's only going
[45:37] to get worse a famine for the hearing of
[45:39] the true word of God that's why you
[45:41] can't play games that's why you can't
[45:43] flirt with the world that's why you
[45:44] can't do what the world does for such a
[45:46] time as this you were raised up this
[45:51] morning Hallelujah I'm still laying a
[45:54] foundation to get to the text Hallelujah
[45:58] what are we getting ready for friends
[46:00] for in Mark 16 the Lord himself went
[46:03] with them
[46:04] everywhere confirming the word that's
[46:07] say Mark 16 that's what we're talking
[46:10] about and that same God is here this
[46:12] morning not in justification only
[46:14] sanctification only the baptism of the
[46:17] Holy Ghost and the gift but the entire
[46:18] Holy Ghost is here this morning for such
[46:21] a time as this St Mark 16 is here this
[46:24] morning the Lord himself is here to conf
[46:26] confirm the word with signs with wonders
[46:29] with Miracles how could there be a
[46:31] miracle if there's nobody
[46:34] sick how could there be a miracle if
[46:36] there's no broken marriage how could
[46:38] your marriage be a miracle if there's no
[46:40] broken marriage if your finances not in
[46:43] a wreck how could God work a financial
[46:45] miracle if your house is messed up how
[46:47] could God be a god of Miracles if
[46:50] there's nobody to heal and there's
[46:52] nobody to deliver and there's no chain
[46:54] to be broken I say the chains are being
[46:56] broken this
[46:59] morning receive the word this morning
[47:02] and watch God
[47:04] [Applause]
[47:06] deliver
[47:08] Hallelujah this morning I say unto you
[47:10] you are predestinated unto adoption and
[47:13] there ain't enough devils in hell to

[47:18] enough to put one finger on the bride
[47:20] touch not man anointed do my prophets no
[47:23] harm the devil could watch you this
[47:25] morning but he can't even touch you this
[47:27] morning and nothing could happen to you

[48:20] how to drive out your
[48:23] enemies to give you a revelation of how
[48:26] how to drive out your enemies that's why
[48:30] you may be seated I took an inspiration
[48:32] you should have killed all the
[48:35] amalekites we're going to deal with them
[48:37] a little later on we're going to come to
[48:39] them a little lat let the amalekites
[48:42] wonder what we going to say but their
[48:44] time is coming we are serving notice
[48:46] today on the

[49:11] morning if you weren't too sure who you
[49:12] are you might forget sometimes and
[49:15] stress might put pressure on you
[49:17] sometimes but who you are doesn't change
[49:19] who you

[49:53] seated Hallelujah for such a Time is
[49:57] this you may be seated I feel like the
[50:00] like the father this morning of the
[50:02] prodal son his son said father I

[50:08] Master's Degree I feel I'm established
[50:10] this morning I'm ready to go work
[50:12] somewhere can I get my portion of my
[50:15] inheritance now because I'm about to
[50:16] make a name for myself and I'm about to
[50:18] go and establish I I'll make us all look
[50:20] good I I'll have a time I I'll still try
[50:23] to keep my values and the father knew
[50:25] what was going on he still gave the sun
[50:27] because he knows if this is in the sun
[50:29] he got to get it out the sun it was
[50:31] hiding there all along so the sun went
[50:33] running and doing his own thing running
[50:35] into the world he went to the parties he
[50:38] went to the fornication he went and
[50:40] drink and smoke he he comb his hair this
[50:42] way he put a mohawk he had this kind of
[50:45] style this kind of fashion he wore the
[50:48] Styles he wore the chain he wore
[50:50] everything they had he walked like the
[50:52] world until one day his money ran
[50:54] out one day his revelation ran out one
[50:58] day his understanding ran out one day
[51:00] his ideas ran out and the Bible says he
[51:03] came to his
[51:07] senses God give us some people this
[51:10] morning who will come to their
[51:12] senses who come to realize wait a minute
[51:15] in My Father's House the servants eating
[51:18] steak F Manion salmon

[51:24] caviar non-alcohol olc
[51:27] champagne in my father's house they have
[51:31] every kind of food you can imagine and
[51:33] here I am eating pig
[51:35] food you may be seated you understand
[51:40] the irony of a Jew who doesn't even mess
[51:43] with pigs having to compete with the
[51:45] pigs with the pig food when the pigs
[51:47] look out they are getting nervous
[51:49] crumbling among themselves look at this
[51:51] one why I got to eat less this is the
[51:53] pigs having a
[51:55] conversation
[51:57] HJ this son eating the foods the pig
[52:00] supposed to be eating that's what the
[52:01] Bible say you can't make this stuff up
[52:03] that's the Bible but he came to his
[52:05] senses he said I will arise I will go to
[52:08] my father and I say father I've sinned
[52:11] he said I'm not worthy to be called your
[52:13] son I'll take a position as a butler
[52:16] I'll take a position as a driver I'll
[52:18] take a position as a servant whatever it
[52:21] is but he didn't know that from the day
[52:23] he walked out of church
[52:26] Hallelujah he didn't know the day he
[52:29] walked out of church you may be seated
[52:31] his father bought the best telescope
[52:33] that money could
[52:35] by his father built a platform to look
[52:39] out for his son look out for his son
[52:41] every morning every miday he say I'll
[52:44] have my lunch right here I'll have
[52:45] breakfast right here I'll have dinner

[52:50] coming home my son is coming home I
[52:53] don't want to miss it I want to make
[52:55] sure that from a far off when I see him
[52:58] coming I know it's him I know how he

[53:11] been put down because you're in the
[53:13] house of God this morning some of you
[53:15] spiritually been walking in the Land of
[53:17] Nod you've been walking all over the
[53:19] place uh but this morning you are in the
[53:21] presence of God at a time when you know
[53:24] you need God can the Church Say Amen
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:31] Hallelujah that wasn't in my notes this
[53:33] morning so let me get back on track this
[53:36] morning I told you we're going to have a
[53:37] Time Bible study a little preaching a
[53:40] little teaching a little ministering we
[53:43] came to have a six-hour service this
[53:51] morning
[53:53] Hall I feel so inspired
[53:57] I feel
[53:58] so I can't put into words what God is
[54:01] doing for me that's my testimony you got
[54:03] to have your own testimony my testimony
[54:06] can be your testimony but the Lord
[54:08] delivered me the Lord saved me the Lord
[54:11] kept me I couldn't keep myself I should
[54:14] have gone crazy a long time ago I should
[54:16] have been writing on the wall a long
[54:17] time ago I should have been running up
[54:19] and down the highway a long time
[54:22] ago and if God saved me who could take
[54:25] that away This Joy I have who could take
[54:28] it away you try you try you try no devil
[54:31] can take it away this morning the peace
[54:34] I have the devil did not give me that
[54:36] peace and the devil cannot take it away
[54:38] this
[54:42] morning blessed be the name of the
[54:45] Lord so this morning you know who you
[54:48] are and you know you are called to
[54:52] manifest a living faith virtue knowledge
[54:56] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[54:59] kindness and for charity to seal the
[55:02] whole thing that's what you're called to
[55:04] do for Jesus Christ to be put on
[55:07] display to be written Epistles read and
[55:11] known of all men to be different to be
[55:13] called out to be
[55:17] separated for God to have the
[55:19] preeminence in your life for God to have
[55:22] the preeminence in your marriage for God
[55:24] to have the preeminence in the brothers
[55:26] for God to have the preeminence in the
[55:28] sisters for God to have the preeminence
[55:30] in the children for God to have
[55:32] preeminence in the ministers and the
[55:33] elders and the deacons that's what we
[55:36] are called
[55:38] for we are called to be
[55:41] adopted this is not a Pentecostal church
[55:44] this is not a message
[55:46] Church Hallelujah this is God's house
[55:49] this morning where the word is our
[55:52] absolute there are people in the message
[55:55] that all they only testimony will ever
[55:57] be is I was in the message or am in the
[56:00] message that's not what God is looking
[56:02] for but the B said what we need in
[56:05] jeffin Ville is thousand of lived
[56:08] voices so this church is to produce
[56:11] lived
[56:12] voices not more church members not great
[56:16] teaching it's to produce lived voices
[56:19] because that's the Thunder that shakes
[56:21] the devil it's the life behind the name
[56:24] that make the demons tremble
[56:27] you are going to have a
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:33] life so you know who you are this
[56:36] morning you know what you're called for
[56:37] this
[56:38] morning and I want to say this morning
[56:40] that now is the
[56:44] time but the brandom desired in his
[56:46] heart to see certain
[56:48] things but the time was not
[56:51] right as much as he desired it God still
[56:55] worked with appointed time am God is a
[56:58] god of order he's a god of structure
[57:00] he's a god of system he's a god of
[57:02] organization amen he doesn't move
[57:04] brother the BAM said he doesn't move
[57:05] haphazardly he doesn't come and say I
[57:08] forgot to do this you know no no no no
[57:09] no no
[57:11] no so when brother branham's Ministry
[57:14] was finished God had to take him off the
[57:17] scene because his work was done when
[57:20] God's work is finished God takes a man
[57:23] off the scene amen hallelujah I wasn't
[57:26] there when brother Brandon was there I
[57:28] wish I was but God didn't call me to be
[57:30] there at that
[57:31] time amen and in my life I'm giving my
[57:35] testimony God had to raise up somebody
[57:36] to stand in the
[57:38] Gap to keep the messiahship straight to
[57:42] keep The Word Alive to keep the message
[57:44] alive to fight the false anointed and
[57:47] the teachers in the message who were
[57:48] trying to corrupt it with different
[57:50] interpretation and ideas and God raised
[57:52] up for such a time as this brother
[57:54] Coleman to fill a void
[57:56] can the church say
[57:58] Amen we are speaking plainly this
[58:00] morning you may be see it because but
[58:03] brandom said there would come men after
[58:04] this to make more sense to it but over
[58:07] said last week things are supposed to be
[58:10] clearer not more confusing when you come
[58:13] to church you ought to see it plainly
[58:15] there should be no more questions why
[58:17] every mystery has been revealed this is
[58:19] not rocket science because but brandham
[58:21] said God can reveal it to the most
[58:23] stupid person that's what that's but
[58:24] Bram were the stupidest the most
[58:26] illiterate person so you don't have to
[58:27] have a degree and read all the courts to
[58:29] know what it is it's a life that's all
[58:31] it is it's a life live a life live a
[58:34] [Applause]
[58:37] life I remember the K's work was done
[58:40] there were many things he had to do but
[58:42] when his work was done God had to move
[58:43] him off the scene because God's Focus
[58:46] has been not an individual his Focus has
[58:49] always been his bride God is a god of
[58:52] the people God has always been a god of
[58:54] the people amen you may be seated that's
[58:58] why when the children of Israel they
[59:00] were under the prophets and they were
[59:02] under certain structure the children of
[59:03] Israel begin to Grumble they say can't
[59:05] we have a king can we have some man over
[59:08] us yes God has always desired to
[59:11] communicate to his people and the
[59:13] children say can we have a man over us
[59:14] like the others including the
[59:20] amalekites and that's how Saul became
[59:22] king but it was not God's desired order
[59:25] God has always desire to be a god of the
[59:28] people that's why but brandom B busted
[59:31] the Catholic church so much for putting
[59:32] all the power on the
[59:34] popes that's right so God himself wants
[59:37] a Tabernacle in you and then be able to
[59:39] say there's my spirit flowing freely
[59:42] there's one day I could use there's
[59:43] another one over there and if that same
[59:45] Holy Ghost is in you that's in me we
[59:47] wouldn't argue we wouldn't debate elect
[59:50] can persecute elect elect can say
[59:52] opposing things elect can say different
[59:55] ideas
[59:57] because it's the same Holy Ghost that's
[59:59] why Paul could say if anybody preach
[1:00:01] anything else other than what I'm saying
[1:00:02] let him be a curse because there is one
[1:00:04] absolute and that absolute is the word
[1:00:06] of God can the church say amen I don't
[1:00:09] know how I got over there friends but we
[1:00:11] are having church this morning we're
[1:00:13] going to have a clean church you know
[1:00:15] without spot without wrinkle
[1:00:19] without amen you may be
[1:00:21] seated so do you know that now is the
[1:00:23] time I'm almost going to get to my in a
[1:00:26] few minutes brother Bram said the time
[1:00:28] has come friends and this is taken from
[1:00:31] a number of messages that brother
[1:00:32] brandham preached he said the time has
[1:00:34] come friends when something's got to be
[1:00:36] said and I believe we are saying
[1:00:38] something this morning he said the time
[1:00:40] has come for the church to move up or go
[1:00:42] back so you have a choice this morning
[1:00:45] either you move up into the spirit or go
[1:00:47] back into the worldly field that you
[1:00:48] come from he said the time has come for
[1:00:51] these things to be fulfilled now is the
[1:00:53] time the time has come for god Jehovah
[1:00:57] to rise on the scene and show himself
[1:01:00] not show man but show himself the time
[1:01:02] has come now for you to make a decision
[1:01:05] today what side you'll be on and this
[1:01:08] side is not Church side this is God's
[1:01:10] side or the devil's side plainly this
[1:01:13] morning the time has come where we can't
[1:01:16] pet anymore we got to preach that's but
[1:01:18] I'm reading but brandom so we are
[1:01:20] preaching this morning the world calls
[1:01:22] preaching foolishness but to us it's
[1:01:24] salvation this morning am can the church
[1:01:27] say amen amen the time has come to
[1:01:29] believe or don't believe there's no
[1:01:32] middle ground here the time has come to
[1:01:35] act upon what you know to be the truth
[1:01:38] the time has come for a
[1:01:40] showdown all taken from brother
[1:01:43] brandham from a message Father the hour
[1:01:46] has come brother brandham said the time
[1:01:48] has come that God will gather his church
[1:01:50] together through under one great big
[1:01:54] banner of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[1:01:56] pour out his powers among them and great
[1:01:59] signs and wonders will take place the
[1:02:00] time has come yes sir he said the time
[1:02:02] has come for the Pentecostal Church make
[1:02:04] a stand the time has come to circumcise
[1:02:08] the church and call out this foolishness
[1:02:11] and that word call means to cut out the
[1:02:13] foolishness the time has come to go back
[1:02:16] to the old Landmark the time has come
[1:02:19] for the outpouring the time has come for
[1:02:21] the Gathering of the people the time has
[1:02:23] come for Jesus to come
[1:02:26] the time will be here soon to give out
[1:02:28] the rewards are you looking for your
[1:02:29] reward this morning then give the Lord a
[1:02:32] shout of
[1:02:34] [Applause]
[1:02:42] Praise but the BAM said brother be
[1:02:44] careful that your crown isn't set on
[1:02:46] someone else's head the time has come we
[1:02:48] are at the end time if we're ever going
[1:02:50] to do anything Brethren we're going to
[1:02:52] do it now the time is at hand the time
[1:02:55] has come and God's shaking every
[1:02:57] denomination Under the Sun amen am can
[1:02:59] the church say Amen so I'm encouraging
[1:03:02] you this morning for such a time as this
[1:03:04] yes and the time has come yesterday was
[1:03:07] too early amen tomorrow is too late
[1:03:11] Hallelujah but I believe today right now
[1:03:13] is your
[1:03:14] time somebody say Amen today is your day
[1:03:18] yesterday was too early tomorrow is too
[1:03:21] late today is your day you have to
[1:03:24] strive to press into the kingdom of God
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:26] today this is why you are here this
[1:03:29] morning for such a time of this and
[1:03:33] friends we in a time of persecution
[1:03:36] am we're in a time of distress we're in
[1:03:39] a time of trouble a time of War a time
[1:03:42] of storm a time of flood a time of pain
[1:03:46] a time of suffering a time of sickness a
[1:03:48] time of disease a time of hatred a time
[1:03:51] of strife a time of confusion a time of
[1:03:54] Destruction a time of crisis yet in this
[1:03:57] time God has raised you up for such a
[1:04:00] time as
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:04] this in a message angels of the Covenant
[1:04:08] but com said you young
[1:04:10] people the devil is telling you that you
[1:04:13] didn't taste the world yet wait a little
[1:04:16] while
[1:04:17] longer he said you keep waiting and
[1:04:19] you're going to wind up in the
[1:04:21] tribulation period in hell because there
[1:04:23] ain't no more time left
[1:04:27] Hallelujah the day you hear my voice
[1:04:29] Harden not your heart this morning I'm
[1:04:33] say for such a time as this because time
[1:04:35] is about to be no
[1:04:37] more time no longer he who is filthy be
[1:04:41] filthy still he who is righteous be
[1:04:44] righteous still brother bam is in a
[1:04:47] message is your life worthy he says to
[1:04:49] reject the day of visitation when God is
[1:04:52] making a visit to the church and to the
[1:04:54] people rece leave it then amen don't put
[1:04:57] it off till next year or the next
[1:04:59] Revival he said today is the day of
[1:05:02] salvation amen can the church say amen
[1:05:05] amen I'm going to skip a couple sections
[1:05:09] here come and get close to my
[1:05:11] text so I believe that anytime God is
[1:05:14] about to do something he must find
[1:05:16] somebody amen anytime God wants to
[1:05:19] reveal a part of himself his nature his
[1:05:21] being his attributes he must find
[1:05:23] somebody so he had to use Luther and
[1:05:25] lesy and brother Brandon we know it and
[1:05:27] now we're going to go back in time this
[1:05:29] morning Hallelujah back to the Book of
[1:05:33] Esther the story of Esther is too vast
[1:05:37] to even cover in one
[1:05:39] message so we're going to go back in
[1:05:41] time to around 483
[1:05:45] BC where the people known as the Hebrews
[1:05:48] or the children of Israel or the Jews
[1:05:51] had been exiled and Scattered throughout
[1:05:53] the Empire of the mes and the Persians
[1:05:55] amen the mes and Persian had just
[1:05:58] conquered
[1:05:59] Babylon Daniel had brought the dream to
[1:06:02] King Nebuchadnezzar of that image of
[1:06:04] gold and silver and brass and iron mixed
[1:06:07] with Clay of the great kingdoms that
[1:06:09] were to come that began with the
[1:06:11] Babylonians and had went to the me and
[1:06:13] the Persians and then the Greeks and the
[1:06:14] Romans and here it was the children of
[1:06:16] Israel had found themselves in problems
[1:06:18] and whenever people found themselves in
[1:06:20] problem in the Bible there was a
[1:06:22] consequence there is always a
[1:06:24] consequence to your action there's a
[1:06:27] consequence to your disrespect there's a
[1:06:29] consequence to what you say Amen there's
[1:06:31] a consequence to what you do and that's
[1:06:33] the same a God was when the children of
[1:06:34] Israel did something wrong there was a
[1:06:37] consequence and God allowed them to be
[1:06:39] captured by the Babylonians and then the
[1:06:42] me and the Persians raised up and
[1:06:44] destroyed the
[1:06:45] Babylonians and here it was we find
[1:06:47] ourselves around 483 BC amen as a result
[1:06:52] of their sin the children of Israel were
[1:06:54] scattered throughout the lands of the
[1:06:56] mes and the Persians at that time the
[1:06:58] world was ruled by what is called
[1:07:00] despotic monarchs Kings who felt they
[1:07:03] were Gods unto themselves rulers who
[1:07:06] what they say was law what they did was
[1:07:08] obeyed amen and at this time there was a
[1:07:11] king in the Land named King ahasuerus
[1:07:14] yes sir the Hebrews call him aass verus
[1:07:17] the Greeks call him
[1:07:20] Xerxes the great Persian
[1:07:22] king the Bible says he ruled ethiop
[1:07:26] he ruled from India to Ethiopia 127
[1:07:29] provinces I'm building to go somewhere
[1:07:32] now he was Lord of all he
[1:07:35] surveyed what he did everybody followed
[1:07:38] him amen the Greek writer and it's
[1:07:41] interesting because at that time the
[1:07:43] Persians recorded everything the Greeks
[1:07:46] did the same thing the Greek writer
[1:07:48] Herodotus said that one time when xeres
[1:07:50] was trying to fight at Greeks he decided
[1:07:52] to build a bridge brother popwell amen
[1:07:55] and when he had the build the the bridge
[1:07:58] built history tells a storm
[1:08:01] came and destroyed the bridge zy says I
[1:08:05] will punish everybody he called all the
[1:08:08] engineers who built the bridge and he
[1:08:10] had them all killed then he took 300 men
[1:08:13] brother Shane and told him take your
[1:08:15] whips out and beat the
[1:08:17] water because the water offended
[1:08:22] me the B the the historian said he told
[1:08:25] them take iron heat it and stick it into
[1:08:27] the water to fry the water because the
[1:08:30] water offended him because he wanted to
[1:08:31] build a bridge to attack the Greeks this
[1:08:34] was the King on Earth at that
[1:08:36] time and around that time the Bible said
[1:08:39] three years into his Reign he decided to
[1:08:42] have a big celebration the Bible say he
[1:08:44] party for six months for six months this
[1:08:47] is not Carnival now this is half the
[1:08:51] Year celebration after celebration the
[1:08:54] Bible says there was alcohol there was
[1:08:57] gold cups everybody had a different kind
[1:08:58] of cup everybody celebrated and the
[1:09:01] Queen She celebrated with all the
[1:09:02] females and everything
[1:09:04] else and at the end of the six months he
[1:09:07] called for a 7-Day feast and there was
[1:09:09] more
[1:09:11] partying and at the end of the 7 Day
[1:09:13] Feast he say send for my wife the Bible
[1:09:16] said he sent seven men to bring his wife
[1:09:17] to him bring Queen vasi so that
[1:09:20] everybody could see
[1:09:22] her and when vasti heard that she was
[1:09:25] called v as we say in Trinidad she sent
[1:09:29] back a message I
[1:09:34] coming I'm not
[1:09:36] coming I not going down there I don't
[1:09:39] know what he doing I'm not going down
[1:09:40] there Hallelujah I'm not going now to
[1:09:44] see the king the Bible says the King was
[1:09:48] angry and the King turned to his wise
[1:09:50] men around him and say well what we
[1:09:52] going to do those wise men they wer even
[1:09:54] thinking about the queen or the king one
[1:09:57] man say here's what you see the wife I
[1:09:58] have home if she only hear what Vash do
[1:10:02] I can't go back
[1:10:04] home the Bible says when they heard it
[1:10:07] they got petrified that there was going
[1:10:08] to be a woman's Liberation movement yes
[1:10:11] yes so they advised the king to put vas
[1:10:14] away put vasy
[1:10:17] away and that King didn't even know
[1:10:19] behind the scene there's a there's a
[1:10:21] drama taking
[1:10:24] place because because when God has to
[1:10:26] move somebody in somebody has to move
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:32] out you may be
[1:10:35] seated so vasti was removed as Queen and
[1:10:40] for a while there was no Queen in the
[1:10:41] land and then the king says you know
[1:10:44] what it's time to find a wife historians
[1:10:47] say at that time there were almost 50
[1:10:49] million people in the Persian Empire he
[1:10:51] said find the most beautiful virgins and
[1:10:53] bring them and among them there was a
[1:10:56] Jewish girl named hadassa that's right
[1:10:59] she her father and mother they were both
[1:11:01] dead and she was being raised by her
[1:11:03] cousin an older man named Mori
[1:11:05] yes and the King's Men didn't notice her
[1:11:08] dasa's beauty her Persian name was
[1:11:10] Esther and they took her to be one of
[1:11:14] the girls to meet the
[1:11:16] king and the Bible says for 12 months
[1:11:19] Esther had to go through a time of
[1:11:23] preparation to prepare to meet the king
[1:11:26] sounds kind of familiar right like his
[1:11:28] wife making herself ready there's a type
[1:11:30] in there you can't just go to meet the
[1:11:32] king in your condition you got to you
[1:11:34] got to be straight you got to know how
[1:11:35] to conduct
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] [Music]
[1:11:40] yourself most recently we know uh Prince
[1:11:44] Charles married what's what's her name
[1:11:47] Princess Kate correct and in writing
[1:11:50] they said she spent months before she
[1:11:52] got married trying to learn the
[1:11:53] etiquette of the Court and how to behave
[1:11:56] yourself how to conduct yourself you
[1:11:57] can't just become a queen without some
[1:12:00] training and you're about to marry the
[1:12:02] great king of kings and you don't want
[1:12:03] to take training you don't want to take
[1:12:06] correction you don't want to be prepared
[1:12:08] to marry your king of kings Lord of
[1:12:11] lords somebody help me preach this
[1:12:14] morning you may be
[1:12:16] seated so here we find
[1:12:18] Esther for 12 months I don't know what
[1:12:22] kind of training it was for 12 months
[1:12:24] she was being prepared to meet the
[1:12:27] king and Mori the Bible says always kept
[1:12:31] an eye out for her he found himself near
[1:12:34] to where she was and he would always
[1:12:36] inquire how is she doing how is my
[1:12:38] daughter doing how is she coming along
[1:12:40] sending a word for her and Esther would
[1:12:42] send back word to him and they had a
[1:12:44] communication
[1:12:46] going Hall encouraging her hanging there
[1:12:49] you going to make
[1:12:51] it you know what the Bible said Esther
[1:12:54] always listened to
[1:12:56] God give us some more young people who
[1:12:57] would
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:05] listen and then the time came for all of
[1:13:09] the women who spend the 12 months
[1:13:12] preparing to go in front of the
[1:13:15] king and one time I saw a movie
[1:13:18] depiction of the story of Esther because
[1:13:20] the Bible says they were allowed to take
[1:13:22] whatever jewelry they wanted whatever
[1:13:24] garments they want wanted whatever
[1:13:26] clothes they wanted they could take 8 in
[1:13:28] high heels if they wanted they could
[1:13:30] take 15 chains if they wanted whatever
[1:13:32] they wanted they could take and one
[1:13:34] movie depiction had this woman who was
[1:13:36] going to meet the king on a horse she
[1:13:37] had so much gold the horse just
[1:13:42] collapsed but but the brandom in the
[1:13:44] message the marriage of the Lamb he
[1:13:45] spoke about Esther and he said Esther
[1:13:47] didn't take the worldly
[1:13:49] adornments Esther knew better than that
[1:13:52] Esther didn't dress like them she didn't
[1:13:55] live like them she looked at the
[1:13:57] earrings and the makeup and the jewelry
[1:13:59] and the and the finger polish and the
[1:14:01] nail polish and the pants and all of
[1:14:03] that you said nah I know better than
[1:14:05] that I might be living in Persia but I'm
[1:14:08] a Jew I know who I am I know what I'm
[1:14:11] called to do I
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:17] know you may be
[1:14:19] seated so you think you're going to meet
[1:14:21] the king of kings with some of the
[1:14:22] foolishness you're doing or you think
[1:14:24] that's going to let it slide huh no no
[1:14:26] no the pastor give me permission to say
[1:14:28] this this
[1:14:33] morning can the church say
[1:14:36] Amen so woman after woman is going
[1:14:39] before King Aus King Zer sees and he's
[1:14:43] not

[1:14:46] eyeliner and the mascara and the Rouge
[1:14:50] and the dis and the D yes Hallelujah and
[1:14:53] what he hear just say you could do and
[1:14:55] all compromising not

[1:15:20] morning and then Here Comes Esther
[1:15:27] Meek
[1:15:28] Sanctified set apart different her
[1:15:33] difference made her stand out her
[1:15:35] difference made her unique her
[1:15:38] difference made her special her
[1:15:41] difference highlighted that she was
[1:15:43] different and the Bible says that that
[1:15:46] King he was completely blown away he
[1:15:49] said bring the crown I don't need to see
[1:15:51] anymore this is Flesh of My Flesh this
[1:15:55] is bone of my Bor this is Spirit of my
[1:15:57] spirit that's that's that's my
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:06] wife you may be seated can the church
[1:16:09] say
[1:16:11] Amen now is where the story gets a bit
[1:16:14] interesting I hope not I'm not taking up
[1:16:16] too much of your time this morning right
[1:16:18] I said we're going to have a bit bit of
[1:16:19] a bible study this morning
[1:16:21] right so here we come to Esther chapter
[1:16:24] 3
[1:16:25] an interesting situation Esther is
[1:16:27] settling into being
[1:16:29] Queen she is getting used to the Palace
[1:16:32] she's getting comfortable with being
[1:16:33] waited on whatever she asks for she
[1:16:36] receives it when she looks up people
[1:16:38] want to know what she wants she's in a
[1:16:40] world by
[1:16:42] herself she almost begins to forget
[1:16:44] she's a Jew because she is the queen 127
[1:16:48] provinces 50 million people you don't
[1:16:51] have much to worry about when you the
[1:16:52] queen but there's something else brewing
[1:16:55] in the
[1:16:56] land the cousin who had trained her who
[1:16:59] had raised her who had encouraged her
[1:17:01] who had shown her the word who had
[1:17:03] reminded her of her history of her
[1:17:04] Heritage of the god of Abraham the god
[1:17:06] of Isaac the god of Jacob Mori a devout
[1:17:10] man a just man a holy
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] man in Esther chapter 3 the Bible says
[1:17:17] that King Xerxes raised up a man called
[1:17:20] hmon as prime minister and a decree went
[1:17:23] out for everybody to bow to
[1:17:26] himon and when Mori saw himon he says I
[1:17:29] am
[1:17:31] not bowing
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:39] down I am not bowing down amen you know
[1:17:42] what the Bible says it says that the
[1:17:44] people tried every day daily to tell
[1:17:47] morai
[1:17:50] bow they pleaded with him bow follow
[1:17:53] what we doing do like everybody else
[1:17:56] Mori was not the only Jew there at the
[1:17:59] time but he was the only one who did not
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:06] bow and heon got so angry he says I'm
[1:18:10] not going to kill Mori alone I want to
[1:18:13] kill every Jew
[1:18:15] everybody and as I was studying this
[1:18:18] something hit me because the Bible
[1:18:20] doesn't just call him hmon it calls him
[1:18:22] hon the agagite
[1:18:25] and that is where I find the problem you
[1:18:27] see when they call your name something
[1:18:29] that's for a reason it's not there by
[1:18:32] Chance hmon the agagite and I started to
[1:18:35] study it some more and to get into that
[1:18:37] we need to go back in history a bit you
[1:18:39] may be see it for a moment amen amen the
[1:18:42] Bible says that when the children of
[1:18:44] Israel left Egypt almost a thousand
[1:18:45] years before I want you to catch the
[1:18:47] picture the children of Israel had been
[1:18:49] in Egypt for 400 years they were in
[1:18:50] bondage they had been slaves they had no
[1:18:53] army they weren't Warriors they were
[1:18:55] Masons and Woodmen and they weren't
[1:18:56] trained to fight they were now coming
[1:18:59] together as a people and the Bible says
[1:19:02] that the amalekites attacked them
[1:19:05] yes Deuteronomy 25:17 says remember what
[1:19:10] amalec did unto thee by the way when you
[1:19:13] were come forth out of Egypt how he met
[1:19:16] thee by the way and smote the hindmost
[1:19:19] of thee even all that were feeble behind
[1:19:23] thee when thou was faint and weary and
[1:19:25] he feared not
[1:19:27] God therefore it shall be when the Lord
[1:19:31] thy God had given thee rest from all
[1:19:33] thine enemies round about in the land
[1:19:36] which the Lord thy God giveth thee for
[1:19:38] an inheritance to possess that thou
[1:19:40] shall blot out the remembrance of amalec
[1:19:44] from under heaven and he says Thou shalt
[1:19:47] not forget
[1:19:49] it so I want you to see the picture
[1:19:51] friends ride with me this morning the of
[1:19:54] Israel coming out of bondage they are
[1:19:56] free they are happy they are celebrating
[1:19:59] they're now getting their strength back
[1:20:01] and amalec sees them in their
[1:20:03] weakness the amalekites aren't honorable
[1:20:06] Fighters you know there are people who
[1:20:08] will say I want to fight you man to man
[1:20:09] I want to fight you face to face if you
[1:20:11] don't have a weapon I want you to have a
[1:20:13] weapon so it's an even match not the
[1:20:15] amalekites you see when you're feeling
[1:20:16] weak when you're feeling discouraged
[1:20:19] when you're feeling depressed when you
[1:20:21] don't have all your strength that's the
[1:20:22] amalekites the hitti the besides the
[1:20:25] amorites they all different you see the
[1:20:26] amalekites is when you feel like giving
[1:20:28] up he say give up that's the amalekites
[1:20:32] when your strength is all weak and
[1:20:33] you're coming out of your situation it's
[1:20:35] the amalaki that try to cut you off and
[1:20:38] God said don't forget it he said when
[1:20:40] you rested when you feasted on the word
[1:20:42] for over 40 plus years when you are
[1:20:44] entering the land I promised you this
[1:20:46] seven sealed seven tunder adoption land
[1:20:49] you're going to block their name out
[1:20:50] forever can the Church Say Amen
[1:20:55] you may be seated that's why I took for
[1:20:57] an inspiration you should have killed
[1:21:00] all the
[1:21:02] amalekites now it gets interesting
[1:21:04] because the amalekites are repeated in
[1:21:07] history a couple times in Exodus 17 the
[1:21:10] Bible says then came amalec and fought
[1:21:13] with Israel at redam and I'm not going
[1:21:15] to read the whole scripture in the
[1:21:17] interest of time but this is where the
[1:21:18] Bible says um Moses says I will hold up
[1:21:21] my hand and when I hold up my hand the
[1:21:24] Lord will be with us and when his hand
[1:21:26] came down they lost the battle it was
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:28] amalekites the same group of
[1:21:31] people hallelujah you should have
[1:21:34] killed all the
[1:21:36] amalekites but the BAM question and
[1:21:38] answer says when Joshua entered the land
[1:21:40] of Canaan he says don't you let one of
[1:21:43] them live he said if it's a cute little
[1:21:46] baby a little amalaki kill
[1:21:48] it you remember he'll grow up to be an
[1:21:51] amalaki he'll pollute the camp and when
[1:21:54] those little things come back like that
[1:21:57] disagreeing with the word of God get rid
[1:21:59] of that thing I don't care what
[1:22:02] denomination it belongs to he says well
[1:22:04] they're good I don't care how good of
[1:22:06] people they are if they're contrary to
[1:22:08] that word get the thing out of you is a
[1:22:11] growing little
[1:22:13] amalekite but the B said it looks cute
[1:22:16] it looks innocent it looks like it's all
[1:22:18] right but you don't have anything to do
[1:22:21] with it you stay away from it
[1:22:29] it's the small
[1:22:30] things that you find in your life that
[1:22:33] you have to kill before it grows up so
[1:22:35] many of us in the message we allow these
[1:22:37] small things to grow up with
[1:22:40] us I say this morning kill all the
[1:22:43] amalekites and I was shocked to find out
[1:22:46] in judges chap Chapter 3 The amalekites
[1:22:49] formed an alliance with the moabites
[1:22:52] against the children of Israel and in
[1:22:54] judges 6 where the character Gideon is
[1:22:57] introduced thou Mighty Man of Allah the
[1:23:00] Bible says the median ites allied with
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:03] amalekites I can imagine the spies who
[1:23:06] were looking at the medanite say is that
[1:23:08] an amalik what is he doing there how did
[1:23:11] the amalekites get caught up in this
[1:23:14] battle who called the amalekites to the
[1:23:17] fight Saul the Bible says lost his
[1:23:20] kingdom because God told Saul in 1st
[1:23:23] Samuel 15
[1:23:25] Samuel also sent unto s the Lord sent me
[1:23:27] to anoint me to be king over his people
[1:23:30] over Israel now therefore the first
[1:23:32] instruction now therefore hearken unto
[1:23:34] the voice of the words of the Lord thus
[1:23:36] say the Lord of hosts I remember that
[1:23:39] which amalec did to Israel how he laid
[1:23:42] weit for him in the way when he came out
[1:23:44] of Egypt now go and smite amalec and
[1:23:47] utterly destroy all that they have and
[1:23:50] spare them not but slay both man and
[1:23:53] woman infants suckling Ox sheep camel

[1:26:24] that you wearing is that an malachite
[1:26:26] you is that a malachite outfit you
[1:26:28] brought here this
[1:26:30] morning
[1:26:31] hallah is that an amalik outfit you went
[1:26:34] to work with last week when you know the
[1:26:37] amales wear that and you don't wear
[1:26:40] that kill all the amalekites this
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:45] morning and when Samuel came out after
[1:26:49] he hear the Sheep bleeding Here Comes
[1:26:51] King AAG he say surely and the Bible
[1:26:54] says I want I want to get it right I
[1:26:56] don't want to I don't want to there's a
[1:26:59] certain statement the scripture
[1:27:02] says before that before that hold on
[1:27:05] hold just hold one
[1:27:11] minute then said Samuel bring me bring
[1:27:14] ye hither to me AAG the king of the
[1:27:16] amalekites and this is the word I want
[1:27:17] to hear and AAR came unto him
[1:27:22] delicately AAR come out saying I'm I'm
[1:27:24] AER you know the Bible say eer came out
[1:27:27] there
[1:27:28] quietly humble Meek amen amen hoping
[1:27:32] there's a peace treaty that he could
[1:27:34] slip into the camp and he could survive
[1:27:37] hoping he could come to the church and
[1:27:38] sit quiet in church looking like a
[1:27:41] Believer raise offering sacrifice
[1:27:44] worshiping among them and Samuel say
[1:27:46] give me the
[1:27:49] sword give me The Sword and the Bible
[1:27:52] said Samuel cut AAR to
[1:27:55] pieces he says not in my house kill all
[1:27:58] the
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:07] amalekites can the church say Amen I'm
[1:28:10] not going to be too much longer with you
[1:28:11] but we're driving to a point here
[1:28:14] friends
[1:28:16] huh so here now we can understand
[1:28:19] clearly why morai could have a problem
[1:28:22] with hmon because hmon the agagite was a
[1:28:25] descendant of King AOK I don't know how
[1:28:27] he escaped but the amalekites were very
[1:28:30] much
[1:28:31] alive that's why my inspiration is you
[1:28:33] should have killed all the amalekites
[1:28:35] because if you had killed the amales
[1:28:37] hmon should not be there right now that
[1:28:40] hon in your life that problem in your
[1:28:42] life that you allowed to fester and grow
[1:28:44] because you didn't kill him five years
[1:28:45] ago is why some of the problems you have
[1:28:47] today
[1:28:50] [Applause]
[1:28:57] Mori says I'm not going to bow down and
[1:29:00] if all the other Jews bow down to him
[1:29:02] and I'm not going to bow down to this
[1:29:04] amalekite I'm not going to give it to
[1:29:07] this worldly Spirit I'm not going to
[1:29:09] compromise what I know to be the truth
[1:29:11] because everybody else is bowing down
[1:29:13] amen I Will Not Bow Down
[1:29:16] Amen to this day the Jews celebrate the
[1:29:20] story of Esther in a feast called purum
[1:29:23] p R I am and in that Feast when they
[1:29:26] read the story because the scripture
[1:29:29] says God will blot out the name of the
[1:29:31] amalekites they don't even say Hon's
[1:29:33] name they say when was coming down the
[1:29:37] road and he saw
[1:29:40] morai they don't even say his name
[1:29:42] because his name is not supposed to be
[1:29:44] spoken kill all the
[1:29:46] amalekites when her saw Mori he was
[1:29:50] angry and Mori says I will not bow down
[1:29:53] to her am somebody help me preach this
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:02] morning I know some of you never even
[1:30:04] read the story of Esther so for some
[1:30:05] it's an education this morning amen but
[1:30:08] that's why you're supposed to be in the
[1:30:09] word because if you in the word then you
[1:30:11] can take courage and take Faith and take
[1:30:13] inspiration from what the Bible has in
[1:30:15] it can the church say
[1:30:20] Amen so I believe God always has a
[1:30:23] witness
[1:30:25] the Bible says every day they try to
[1:30:28] convince morai to Bow daily could you
[1:30:31] imagine morai bow now come and go to the
[1:30:35] party with me now come and wear this
[1:30:37] outfit now why you wearing your skirt so
[1:30:39] long why don't cut your ha why don't
[1:30:41] drink why don't you smoke why why you
[1:30:43] going to church every day they came to
[1:30:45] morai to convince him to bow
[1:30:49] down amen and hmon says I want to kill
[1:30:53] them all
[1:30:55] can the church say Amen so I believe
[1:30:58] this morning there are some individuals
[1:31:00] who will stand for the word who will
[1:31:03] stand for righteousness if nobody else
[1:31:06] wants to stand you could stand if nobody
[1:31:08] else want to come to church you will
[1:31:10] come to church if nobody in your house
[1:31:12] wants to worship you will worship Mori
[1:31:14] had a revelation and I believe the are
[1:31:17] individuals this morning who have a
[1:31:19] revelation can the Church Say Amen
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:26] could you take some more this
[1:31:28] morning Esther 3:8 says and hymon went
[1:31:33] to the king and said there is a certain
[1:31:35] people scattered abroad and dispersed
[1:31:38] among the people in all the provinces
[1:31:41] they're everywhere and their laws are
[1:31:44] diverse from all people neither keep
[1:31:46] they the king's laws therefore it is not
[1:31:49] for the king's Prophet to suffer them he
[1:31:52] said there are some people gathered
[1:31:53] among the World here their laws are
[1:31:56] different they don't Worship in our
[1:31:58] temples they dress different they live
[1:32:00] different they forgive their brothers
[1:32:03] they're not getting jealous they don't
[1:32:04] have enmity they're always on fire they
[1:32:07] say seven tunders give fi there're
[1:32:09] something different about them they're
[1:32:11] not like everybody
[1:32:13] else they're always praying they're
[1:32:16] always in the word they're get
[1:32:18] consecrated they with the old Landmark
[1:32:21] you can't move them you can't shake them
[1:32:23] they w't bow to
[1:32:25] me there's some people who know who they
[1:32:28] are I don't know who they are but they
[1:32:29] are
[1:32:33] different
[1:32:35] hallu can the church say amen amen and
[1:32:39] here it was he was able to convince the
[1:32:41] king to sign a decree to kill all the
[1:32:45] Jews this is the only time in Biblical
[1:32:48] history when all of the Jews were in
[1:32:51] threat of becoming extinct
[1:32:54] and here we find
[1:32:57] Esther back in now chapter 4 as I get
[1:33:00] ready to close
[1:33:02] out totally
[1:33:05] unaware
[1:33:07] unconcerned with what's going on Amen
[1:33:10] she has been in the temple so long she
[1:33:12] has been in the palace so long she has
[1:33:15] been living her life so long she has
[1:33:17] lost interest with what's going on with
[1:33:20] her
[1:33:22] people and her Maids brought word to her
[1:33:26] that they sighing and crying for the
[1:33:29] abomination in the city amen brought
[1:33:32] word to Esther saying Esther your cousin
[1:33:36] is there outside the gate in sackcloth
[1:33:38] and Ashes yes crying and weeping she
[1:33:41] didn't even know what was going on
[1:33:44] Esther was so out of the spirit she sent
[1:33:47] morai a three-piece
[1:33:50] suit so he could change his clothes
[1:33:54] and when Mori refused the
[1:33:57] clothes Esther send word what is going
[1:34:00] on and the Bible tells us that morai
[1:34:03] sent word that listen our people are
[1:34:06] under
[1:34:07] attack God's chosen people are under
[1:34:11] attack
[1:34:13] amen and morai sent a message to Esther
[1:34:16] think not with thyself th that thou
[1:34:20] shall Escape in the King's house more
[1:34:22] than all the Jews
[1:34:24] he saids if thou altto together hold thy
[1:34:27] peace at this time then shall
[1:34:29] Deliverance arise from somewhere else in
[1:34:32] other words God will deliver us but you
[1:34:35] and I will be
[1:34:36] dead unless you do something about
[1:34:40] it God give us a burden to sigh and
[1:34:44] cry give us a burden to plead to see God
[1:34:48] move on the
[1:34:51] scene understand this the Bible said
[1:34:53] Esther hadn't told anyone she was a
[1:34:55] Jew she was an undercovered Jew just how
[1:34:58] many of us are undercovered Christians
[1:35:01] and that's why brother over always says
[1:35:02] tell people that you're a Christian tell
[1:35:04] people what you believe make your
[1:35:06] testimony
[1:35:08] clear amen because when you don't then
[1:35:11] you're hiding there you compromis
[1:35:14] compromising amen but now Esther came to
[1:35:18] a time of decision Hallelujah because
[1:35:20] for her to go to the king she had to let
[1:35:22] the king know who she was what she was
[1:35:25] called for and the time for deliverance
[1:35:27] is
[1:35:28] now somebody help me this
[1:35:31] morning amen hallelujah so after Esther
[1:35:35] heard this she got in the spirit
[1:35:37] Hallelujah God help us to get in the
[1:35:39] spirit this morning and he says gather
[1:35:42] all the Jews that are around gather all
[1:35:44] the Believers that are around and fast
[1:35:47] for me don't eat or drink for three days
[1:35:50] and I will do the same thing also and my
[1:35:53] maze will look the same thing also
[1:35:54] because I'm going to go see the king
[1:35:57] amen it's death to go in if you are not
[1:36:00] called but I have to go in to see the
[1:36:03] king if I
[1:36:05] perish I perish but I can't stay quiet I
[1:36:10] can't let this message fall to the
[1:36:12] ground I can't let this
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:21] message he may be seated the musicians
[1:36:23] can come forward
[1:36:24] amen I believe in a message anointed and
[1:36:28] commissioned where the kman said Queen
[1:36:31] Esther how do you not know that you
[1:36:33] wasn't born for such a time as
[1:36:37] this how do you not know that all that
[1:36:40] You' have been through in life was for
[1:36:42] such a time as this for this moment of
[1:36:45] decision to really serve God or to just
[1:36:48] hide in church or to just play Church
[1:36:51] how do you not know that all trials have
[1:36:54] you have been through and all the
[1:36:55] experiences you have been through hasn't
[1:36:57] been for such a time as this amen what
[1:37:00] did Esther do she went over into the
[1:37:02] king's chamber it was dead to go in
[1:37:04] there if you wasn't called to go in
[1:37:06] there but she had a revelation that she
[1:37:08] was the bride somebody say Amen so the
[1:37:11] hour came she said if I perish I perish
[1:37:14] but I'm going in for the season has
[1:37:16] changed amen yes sir she knew her life
[1:37:20] was never going to be the same again
[1:37:22] because once she she declared who she
[1:37:24] was she could never take back that
[1:37:27] declaration she didn't care anymore
[1:37:29] friends she didn't care about being
[1:37:31] Queen anymore she didn't care about her
[1:37:33] own life anymore she didn't care how it
[1:37:35] would look to the friend she met in the
[1:37:37] palace anymore it was life or
[1:37:41] death because when they found out she
[1:37:44] was a Jew she would have been killed
[1:37:45] like everybody
[1:37:49] else it was death if she stayed in her
[1:37:52] condition and it could have been death
[1:37:54] if you went to the king amen she say if
[1:37:57] I perish I
[1:37:58] perish amen but I've got to see the king
[1:38:03] Hallelujah Mori a type of the Prophet
[1:38:06] had spoken to her and encouraged her how
[1:38:08] do you not know for such a time as this
[1:38:11] this message came to you amen for such a
[1:38:13] time as this this word is coming to you
[1:38:16] this
[1:38:17] morning that you have to give everything
[1:38:19] else up in your life and hold on to this
[1:38:22] word Lord if if I perish I perish but
[1:38:25] I'm going to serve you with everything
[1:38:27] Hallelujah if I perish I perish but I'm
[1:38:30] going to serve the
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] king Esther had been silent for a long
[1:38:37] time the fact that they didn't know she
[1:38:39] was a Jew meant she wasn't going to the
[1:38:43] temple certain commitments and
[1:38:46] sacrifices and worship she couldn't have
[1:38:48] done because she was hiding who she was
[1:38:51] I challenge you this morning stop stop
[1:38:53] hiding this morning stop playing church
[1:38:57] this morning stop playing games this
[1:39:00] morning there's death hanging over the
[1:39:02] world Amen and if you stay silent you're
[1:39:05] going to die if you don't worship you're
[1:39:08] going to die if you don't sigh and cry
[1:39:10] you're going to die because there's
[1:39:12] abomination in the
[1:39:15] city for all the years that Essa had
[1:39:17] been growing up she didn't know what she
[1:39:19] was called to do but all of a sudden in
[1:39:21] a moment the right word to her set her
[1:39:25] heart on fire amen yes sir all the years
[1:39:28] she was in the temple she thought she
[1:39:29] was just a fortunate blessed Jewish girl
[1:39:32] who happened to find favor in the eyes
[1:39:34] of the king but in that crucial moment
[1:39:37] the word was given to her that
[1:39:39] Esther how do you not know it's for such
[1:39:42] a time as this that you are here this
[1:39:46] morning you are in a position to do
[1:39:48] something this morning you are in a
[1:39:50] position to reflect the Life of Christ
[1:39:53] this morning
[1:39:54] morning amen buta went on I must go in
[1:39:58] I'm desperate I'm going in but say so
[1:40:02] she took the seven tunders and wrapped
[1:40:03] herself in her royal robe hallelu the
[1:40:06] clothes provided for her by Malachi 4
[1:40:09] morai he was there in type the king
[1:40:12] couldn't stand vashy no more Miss Le sea
[1:40:16] because she wouldn't take the headship
[1:40:18] and they had everything given to them
[1:40:19] what to put on and what to do and
[1:40:21] everything how to be beautiful they had
[1:40:23] they own ideas about it all the rest did
[1:40:26] what they wanted to do they had their
[1:40:27] own interpretation of how to please the
[1:40:30] king but this one Chamberlain he told
[1:40:33] Esther what to wear how to be beautiful
[1:40:35] she had a revelation she knew how to
[1:40:38] please the king so do you this morning
[1:40:41] Esther you are predestinated to stand
[1:40:44] before him blameless before the Beloved
[1:40:47] Hallelujah so the hour come the season
[1:40:49] come the moment come and Esther walked
[1:40:51] in by faith knowing she had added all
[1:40:54] the way up to that Capstone there was no
[1:40:57] doubt about it she know the seven
[1:41:00] tunders was there she knew it was there
[1:41:02] she knew that charity was sitting on the
[1:41:04] throne on the seventh step Hallelujah
[1:41:06] she had forgiven her brother there were
[1:41:08] no arts in her heart therefore she knew
[1:41:12] her heavenly father would forgive her so
[1:41:15] with that revelation of Brotherly
[1:41:17] kindness she walked on in and the King
[1:41:20] looked and said what do you want Esther
[1:41:23] unto half of my kingdom and the king put
[1:41:26] out his scepter to her Hallelujah he
[1:41:28] said what do you want Esther she said I
[1:41:31] want my own Feast the spirit and the
[1:41:33] bride say come whosoever will come
[1:41:35] whosoever's a thirst come to Esther's
[1:41:38] Feast this morning you are predestinated
[1:41:41] Esa to stand there unto adoption amen
[1:41:44] can the church say amen amen amen you
[1:41:48] could begin to play something softly
[1:41:51] wonderful
[1:41:53] one more hallelujah
[1:41:57] hallelujah glory to God
[1:42:01] hallelujah and Jess it's it's difficult
[1:42:03] to finish the whole thing this morning
[1:42:06] because I believe the word of God has
[1:42:07] already spoken to some hearts this
[1:42:09] morning amen and there are some people
[1:42:11] this morning are ready to say Lord if I
[1:42:13] perish I perish amen but I want to see
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:17] king if I have to give up the worldly
[1:42:19] clothes this morning I want to give it
[1:42:22] up this morning
[1:42:24] amen I want to kill all the amalekites
[1:42:26] in my life amen there's stuff that you
[1:42:30] have in your house you have to throw
[1:42:31] away
[1:42:32] tonight yes there are books in your
[1:42:36] house magazines in your houses DVDs in
[1:42:40] your Houses music in your houses friends
[1:42:43] in your
[1:42:46] life that are only taking you
[1:42:49] away from your
[1:42:51] blessing amen
[1:42:56] Esther told the king come to a
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:01] feast and bring hmon with
[1:43:06] you and they came to the house and
[1:43:08] Esther laid out of feast but the time
[1:43:11] was not
[1:43:13] right because God is a god of
[1:43:16] timing so the king asked Esther Esther
[1:43:19] what is it that you want Esther said all
[1:43:22] I want
[1:43:23] is you to come to another Feast
[1:43:27] tomorrow something moved in our
[1:43:30] heart because the
[1:43:32] timing had to be
[1:43:34] right and I believe for somebody in here
[1:43:37] this morning the
[1:43:39] timing is
[1:43:41] right you have lived your way for a long
[1:43:45] time but this is your time for such a
[1:43:49] time as this this morning this message
[1:43:52] has brought you to this part for such a
[1:43:54] time as
[1:43:55] this the Bible says the next day in fact
[1:43:59] within that 24-hour period the Bible
[1:44:01] says after the first Feast hmon went
[1:44:04] walking away feeling good about himself
[1:44:06] he's the the king and the queen invited
[1:44:07] me to eat with them and the Bible says
[1:44:09] as he walked out he saw
[1:44:11] morai and they say he got so angry he
[1:44:14] basically lost his joy of the feast and
[1:44:16] he ordered him to build a Gallows to
[1:44:18] kill
[1:44:19] morai and to show how God works and you
[1:44:23] can't figure God out that night the King
[1:44:26] has trouble
[1:44:27] sleeping and instead of counting sheep
[1:44:30] hallu he says bring me the
[1:44:32] chronicles of what's written about our
[1:44:35] history hall because years before I want
[1:44:38] to hear what was going on and as they're
[1:44:40] reading to him so he can fall asleep he
[1:44:42] hears a story of morai one time had
[1:44:45] warned about an attack on his life and
[1:44:47] he asked the question did we do anything
[1:44:49] for

[1:45:07] pleased the king I want to say this is
[1:45:10] somebody who I'm well pleased what
[1:45:12] should I do and hymon looks in the
[1:45:15] mirror fixes his clothes and says your
[1:45:19] majesty Hallelujah get your horse
[1:45:23] [Music]

[1:45:27] king power maybe maybe it was a seven

[1:45:34] this man and put this man on the horse
[1:45:36] and let a prince lead him through the

[1:46:04] read it the Bible says that mori's wife
[1:46:08] uh sorry Hon's wife and his friends had
[1:46:10] they say hmon the king just blessed
[1:46:13] morai I think you're the wrong side of
[1:46:16] the
[1:46:17] equation that's right I think you're on
[1:46:19] the wrong side this morning because who
[1:46:22] God bless
[1:46:24] no man can
[1:46:26] curse the Bible says later that night
[1:46:29] hmon
[1:46:31] is he's at the feast and the King says
[1:46:34] Esther what do you want what what what
[1:46:37] what do you want up to half my
[1:46:39] kingdom and Esther in a true if I could
[1:46:43] use the word Damsel in
[1:46:47] Distress says King can you please save
[1:46:49] my life and save the life of my people
[1:46:53] the Bible says the King was like what
[1:46:55] who would there try to kill you and she
[1:46:58] turned on the table and say
[1:47:02] hymon the Bible says that hmon dropped
[1:47:05] to his knees and tried to plead with
[1:47:08] Esther the king turned and look at us
[1:47:10] and say in front of me you will attack
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] her said take this amalaki out and hang
[1:47:20] him on the same place he tried to
[1:47:23] morai take this filthy devil out the
[1:47:26] church take this ungodly Spirit out the
[1:47:29] church throw him
[1:47:33] out you may be seated
[1:47:36] hallu Hallelujah friends there's so much
[1:47:39] in this we can go on for hours but I
[1:47:41] want to bring this service to a close
[1:47:43] the Bible says in fact the historians
[1:47:46] said in that time when a law was made
[1:47:48] the king couldn't just take back his own
[1:47:50] law he had to make a new law so he
[1:47:52] passed the law saying Jews I can't take
[1:47:55] back the law but here's what arm
[1:47:58] yourselves they have set a day to kill
[1:48:01] you but defend yourself get whatever
[1:48:03] weapon you can get in fact he back up he
[1:48:06] backed them up because it was his wife's
[1:48:08] people he says I'm going to help you get
[1:48:10] your weapons but the enemy tried to wipe
[1:48:13] you out but they're not going to kill
[1:48:15] you you have every right to defend your
[1:48:18] house you have every right to defend
[1:48:20] your family you have every right to
[1:48:23] defend the people of
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] God
[1:48:29] hallelujah glory to
[1:48:32] God you may be
[1:48:34] seated the Bible says God raised
[1:48:38] morai as second in command of the entire
[1:48:42] Persian Empire just as Daniel was
[1:48:45] elevated before
[1:48:48] him what a type to us raised to the
[1:48:52] right hand of the king yes can the
[1:48:54] church say amen amen friends the word is
[1:48:58] beautiful it's live to us this is not a
[1:49:01] deep message it's a simple message but I
[1:49:04] believe in its Simplicity there's a word
[1:49:07] to encourage you this morning to cut
[1:49:10] away the things of the world the
[1:49:12] distractions the evil in your
[1:49:16] life I'm not afraid to tell you the
[1:49:18] truth because only the truth will set
[1:49:21] you free
[1:49:23] Hallelujah the only way you can
[1:49:25] backslide is because there's an amalik
[1:49:28] living in your
[1:49:29] house amen I look at people in the world
[1:49:33] sometimes who have their own set of
[1:49:37] values they dress a certain way they
[1:49:40] live a certain way and you can't change
[1:49:41] their minds about how they dress yet
[1:49:44] sometime in a message somebody walks out
[1:49:46] the church they put a tattoo on their
[1:49:47] back want to wear the shortest pants
[1:49:50] they could wear cut their hair off
[1:49:53] because these amalekites were growing in
[1:49:54] their lives all
[1:49:56] along you should have killed all amen
[1:49:59] dear am
[1:50:02] malachit the Holy Ghost wants to fill
[1:50:04] you but there is stuff that you have to
[1:50:07] do and there's stuff that God has to do
[1:50:09] you see killing the amalekites that's
[1:50:11] your responsibility God never told them
[1:50:14] I will kill the amalaki he say you go go
[1:50:17] and kill your
[1:50:19] amalekites you got to do it you got to
[1:50:22] clear the way to get your prayer life
[1:50:25] back in order you have to find God where
[1:50:28] you left him there is no excuse don't
[1:50:31] bring a bleaching sheep back into your
[1:50:33] house and say you know what Saul said he
[1:50:35] says I brought the Sheep to bring a
[1:50:37] sacrifice and that's where the scripture
[1:50:39] is obedience is better than
[1:50:43] sacrifice because God wants you to obey
[1:50:45] his word God wants you to love him he
[1:50:47] wants the word to be alive in your
[1:50:50] heart friends
[1:50:53] but Bram said full obedience to the
[1:50:56] word entitles you to the
[1:51:00] Token so until you kill the
[1:51:03] amalekites in full obedience to his
[1:51:06] word you're just wasting time friends
[1:51:09] you have to go into action today you
[1:51:13] have to repent today if you've been
[1:51:15] harboring am malachit repent today and
[1:51:19] kill them in your life
[1:51:21] today but there coming a day when
[1:51:24] there's a judgment you miss the Rapture
[1:51:26] you going to judgment and you know what
[1:51:28] God will say you should have killed all
[1:51:32] the amalekites because what you allow to
[1:51:34] grow in your life is what prevented the
[1:51:37] spirit of God from working effectively
[1:51:40] in your house in your family amen he
[1:51:43] said if you love me keep my
[1:51:46] Commandments keep my Commandments if you
[1:51:49] love me keep my
[1:51:51] Commandments come to Church on time come
[1:51:54] prayed up make a sacrifice do your
[1:51:58] responsibility pay your tithes give
[1:52:00] respect in a ministry that's the
[1:52:03] Commandments of God not your idea not
[1:52:05] how you feel like that's not
[1:52:09] it I challenged the prayer meeting last
[1:52:11] week young people present your bodies a
[1:52:15] Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to
[1:52:19] God which is your reasonable service is
