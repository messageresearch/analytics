[36:03] Jesus uh you may be seated uh just
[36:06] before we read the scripture want to
[36:07] read a testimony here I got this
[36:09] testimony a greetings in the name of our
[36:11] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ last week
[36:13] Thursday while at work I hooked up to
[36:15] the headone Tabernacle link via VIA
[36:18] YouTube I went through the song Service
[36:20] as usual by precious but anonio bran I
[36:23] felt God's present resident and I knew
[36:26] that something special was waiting for
[36:27] for me I found myself opening up
[36:29] subconsciously to receive directly from
[36:32] God I never knew what was coming but I
[36:34] was ready by the time you started
[36:36] preaching it became an octave hire Lord
[36:39] God I felt scorched out I had to replay
[36:42] the message all over again in a backtack
[36:46] fashion today is making it the third
[36:48] time I've played that message short
[36:50] quick and Powerful but AB Bram said the
[36:53] spirit proceeds the word my sole purpose
[36:55] of sending this message to you precious
[36:58] Pastor to over is to show the devil
[37:00] publicly whose side I belong I am not
[37:03] ashamed to give my testimony that the
[37:05] Lord Jesus Christ delivered me from a
[37:08] long standing Spirit of resentment and
[37:11] bitterness a lot of times I have
[37:14] Justified my actions but this time you
[37:17] give me by impaction a spiritual
[37:20] scissors to cut off the webs of
[37:22] bitterness and resentment of My Life by
[37:25] the preaching of the word so I can
[37:27] access all God's blessing and goodness I
[37:29] know I am free and liberated to approach
[37:33] god with an increased service I am ready
[37:36] for a continuous growth process as we
[37:39] wait for the dynamic to strike us thank
[37:42] you precious uh Pastor over for yielding
[37:44] yourself a tool in the hands of God to
[37:46] be a blessing to God's children around
[37:48] the world we are portions of God
[37:50] children that are beneficiary of your
[37:52] ministry here in Sweden may God bless
[37:54] you and the head Tabernacle for your
[37:56] label of love
[37:58] uh humble brother your humble brother
[38:01] brother Peter Alfred uh he's in Sweden
[38:03] and he send his testimony praise the
[38:06] [Applause]
[38:12] Lord and this tonight so tonight we want
[38:15] to stand and we want to go our Bibles
[38:16] one scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[38:19] we want to read from verse 8
[38:21] to13 uh from 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[38:25] reading verbs 8 charity never feel it
[38:27] but whether there be prophecies it shall
[38:29] fail whether there be tongues it shall
[38:31] cease whether there be knowledge it
[38:33] shall vanish away for we know in part
[38:35] and we prophesy part but when that which
[38:38] is perfect is come then that which is in
[38:41] part shall be done away when I was a
[38:43] child I spake as a child I understood as
[38:46] a child I thought as a child but when I
[38:49] became a man I put away childish things
[38:52] but now we see through our glass Darkly
[38:54] and then face to face now I know in part
[38:57] but then shall I know even as also I am
[39:00] known and now abided faith hope charity
[39:03] these three by the graes of these is
[39:06] Charity may God bless his word you may
[39:08] be seated let us let's have a quick word
[39:10] of prayer father God I pray that you'd
[39:12] bless the word take me out of the way be
[39:14] glorified and be magnified in all midst
[39:15] in Jesus name I ask it amen praise the
[39:18] Lord
[39:18] amen this week I had a special uh time
[39:22] fellowship with brother Andrew lulan and
[39:24] he was sharing some things with me and
[39:26] as he was speaking you know it's like
[39:28] almost like a scene of vision seeing
[39:30] certain things that ties into all what
[39:32] we are seeing here it was such a
[39:33] blessing I said man you giving me
[39:35] messages after messages after messages
[39:37] man just talking fellowshipping and
[39:39] things begin to unfold so tonight I felt
[39:42] this is a message to follow Sunday
[39:44] message um and this the title I have
[39:48] here is that which is perfect is come
[39:51] and have an inspiration the reflection
[39:54] is the Perfection and this is very
[39:58] important this part here the reflection
[40:00] is the Perfection and this exposes all
[40:03] the false claims of adoption that
[40:05] ministers over the years have claimed to
[40:08] be perfect adopted and so on this make
[40:11] uh that that looks so foolish because
[40:13] the reflection is the perfection in
[40:15] other words we have to be able to
[40:16] reflect Jesus
[40:18] Christ not not no for our message and
[40:21] forward Mysteries and forward no no no
[40:23] the reflection is the perfect Perfection
[40:25] but I'm saying when Christ can be SE
[40:27] manifested in your flesh made alive like
[40:31] it was in Moses in other words the word
[40:33] becomes flesh itself in other you punch
[40:35] him you stick him only Christ could come
[40:37] out nothing else could come out but
[40:39] Jesus Christ isn't that right okay let's
[40:42] go God wants the church to love him
[40:45] that's what I title this a little
[40:46] paragraph here but I'm talking about the
[40:49] woman with the Lost coin I know we beat
[40:50] that over like a tune but we had to beat
[40:52] it again until we catch it but she
[40:54] scraped the floors and one bir tell me
[40:57] never I noticed that the neighbors saw
[40:58] the dust flying we never saw that before
[41:01] that that's when you're really cleaning
[41:02] up you don't care who see you know
[41:03] you're pelting out things you know you
[41:05] know some people brushing in a corner
[41:07] and they want to see much dust inside
[41:08] the house forget it they you to get
[41:11] fling things out throw things out you
[41:13] don't care who see what is getting out
[41:14] of your life isn't that right and then
[41:16] he said here she had a house cleaning
[41:18] time she scrubed the floor She swed the
[41:19] walls took down the cobwebs she kept on
[41:22] until she found that she had lost and
[41:24] when she did she called her sister chur
[41:26] to come now then prophesied he said I
[41:29] don't care if you're Methodist Baptist
[41:31] Pentecostal Presbyterian come let us
[41:33] rejoice together when that time come
[41:36] that's the prophecy in other words
[41:38] whether you're twofold six seal no seal
[41:40] half seal whether you press play no play
[41:42] you saying when you playay high low you
[41:45] hear from some Angel some cuckoo Angel
[41:47] whever he come and rejoice with us
[41:50] praise God that is the prophecy here now
[41:52] when the church finds his Brotherly Love
[41:54] prophecy that means it lost we have the
[41:57] find it because the devil it don't make
[41:59] no sense you see I can't say if I was
[42:01] the devil I can't play the devil but the
[42:03] devil wouldn't bring no press if you
[42:04] know he inside the
[42:06] church he owned the church he's resident
[42:09] in the church he's resident be the
[42:11] pulpit B scripti text do you understand
[42:15] that so once the Believers off key he
[42:17] don't touch them leave them so they
[42:20] can't produce nothing no Revival no
[42:22] breakthrough no healing no signs no
[42:24] Miracles keep them like that let them
[42:26] say they believe a message because they
[42:27] devil believe and tremble and people in
[42:30] the message not trembling they just
[42:31] believing but he believed too but if the
[42:35] bride strike that honey where the devil
[42:38] can't come between you and your brother
[42:40] the devil have an issue he has an issue
[42:43] then because there is no room to come
[42:45] between you and your brother because the
[42:47] honey sticks hallelujah oh give the Lord
[42:49] a
[42:50] shout I'm praying for you you praying
[42:52] for me back to back we face each other
[42:55] oh give the Lord some praise
[42:57] hallelujah hallelujah my back is to your
[43:00] back oh glory to God the devil can come
[43:02] in between we rocking Hallelujah in
[43:04] prayer we Rocking In Praise we rocking
[43:07] in Thanksgiving oh give the Lord I shout
[43:10] the devil is booted out he is kicked out
[43:13] you are still my brother you believe
[43:14] this you believe that but we will keep
[43:16] the unity of the spirit until we get to
[43:18] the unity of the faith oh give the Lord
[43:20] I shou in the house has nothing to do
[43:22] with Doctrine has to do with your
[43:25] spirit Hallelujah
[43:28] so this prophecy is still hanging
[43:30] hanging when that time come when the

[48:00] to it God's done it and it settled it I
[48:03] love him for it oh glory to God
[48:07] hallelujah could we give the Lord some
[48:08] Praises
[48:09] tonight the devil is just trying to
[48:11] scare you out of something he's trying
[48:13] to put something off somewhere say some
[48:14] of these days you'll be this you are now
[48:17] now are we the sons of God we are seated
[48:19] together in Heavenly places not in the
[48:21] Millennium we are now and here the bum
[48:24] drop what you are here is a reflection
[48:27] of what you are somewhere else oh give
[48:30] the Lord a shout so the reflection will
[48:34] be the Perfection because what we are
[48:37] [Applause]
[48:40] here is a reflection of where you are
[48:43] somewhere else then he dropped the
[48:45] scripture to back it up those who he
[48:46] found you when do he call he justified
[48:49] those who Justified he has all glorified
[48:51] already in the presence of the father we
[48:54] have a glorified body wasn't that deep
[48:58] or if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[48:59] dissolved we have one already waiting so
[49:02] what we are here is a reflection of what
[49:06] we are somewhere else so if your Deeds
[49:09] are evil you know where it comes from
[49:11] you know where your other bu is waiting
[49:13] so what is he saying there as we get
[49:16] nearer to
[49:18] home oh
[49:20] my as we get nearer to home we are
[49:23] getting nearer to
[49:24] Perfection so then we have to reflect
[49:32] Perfection and this has nothing to do
[49:35] with a man behind the pulpit this is for
[49:37] brothers sisters mothers fathers this is
[49:40] for everyone till we all come hey
[49:44] Hallelujah into the statue of a perfect
[49:47] man to reflect Jesus
[49:49] Christ amen oh these are some powerful
[49:53] stuff tonight
[49:57] brother God was this great spirit so
[50:01] he's going deep now we picture him seven
[50:04] colors of the rainbow watch now God is
[50:08] eternal and he was the perfect perfect
[50:12] love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect
[50:15] satis satisfaction all those seven
[50:17] spirits the devil not in the picture
[50:20] Lucifer not in the picture time is not
[50:22] even in the
[50:23] picture am time May begin yet this is
[50:27] Elohim self-existing seven perfect
[50:30] Spirits there's not the word yet because
[50:32] in the beginning was the word come on
[50:34] preach to me somebody this was before
[50:36] the beginning this was Elohim this was
[50:39] the function of spirit perfect Spirit
[50:42] perfect love perfect rainbow nothing
[50:45] created yet Hallelujah then out of that
[50:49] perfect Spirit here come a birth of the
[50:51] Loos the word the expression of the mind
[50:55] of God or the thought of God God and
[50:57] then you get in the beginning was the
[50:58] word which is the expression of God
[51:00] which is the spoken word god
[51:04] expressed from thinking to word logos
[51:07] and then that form the beginning in the
[51:10] beginning was the word the word was with
[51:12] God and the Word was God oh glory to God
[51:15] the Mind became the word hallelujah
[51:17] Spirit became the word it has all been
[51:19] word and spirit oh give the Lord I sh
[51:21] there always been mechanics and Dynamics
[51:24] Hallelujah there's always been that H he
[51:27] was the perfect love perfect peace
[51:29] perfect Joy perfect satisfaction all
[51:31] those seven spirits as we get in
[51:33] Revelation they came out was made up God
[51:35] was Perfection so the brother Bram by
[51:39] Revelation bring Perfection before the
[51:42] beginning the seven spirits Elohim
[51:45] spirits that was
[51:47] Perfection and he said here now watch
[51:50] everything else outside of that has been
[51:54] something perverted from that amen so
[51:58] the only way that we can come back to
[52:01] Perfection is to come back with that
[52:04] Perfection which is God so he's saying
[52:07] the way back to Perfection is back to
[52:09] those seven
[52:10] spirits and that's what the prophet
[52:12] reveal in that
[52:13] [Music]
[52:16] pyramid then we come to Perfection then
[52:20] we have eternal life Without End just
[52:22] forever eternal life Hallelujah all
[52:25] right let's go
[52:27] thank you Lord the other morning about 5
[52:28] weeks ago now reading I've been out in a
[52:31] meeting I was tired woke up in the
[52:33] morning about 7:00 we go to the
[52:35] Tabernacle this morning and in the
[52:37] morning to my wife she was still
[52:38] sleeping I kind of raise up head of the
[52:40] bed put my hands back like this I was
[52:43] laying there thinking I said hey I'm 50
[52:45] years old I haven't done nothing for the
[52:48] Lord I've got to hurry up and do
[52:50] something I'll be old after a while I
[52:53] got to hurry and do something I ain't
[52:54] done nothing for the Lord I said but you
[52:57] know I sure hate the idea of having to
[52:59] die before he comes I dread the thought
[53:02] I have to go vitari I have to die and
[53:05] become a spirit I didn't like that at
[53:07] all and while I was laying there
[53:09] thinking that I heard something just as
[53:12] plain as you can hear my voice as I was
[53:14] telling you last night said keep
[53:15] pressing on and I said I am pressing on
[53:19] said keep pressing on keep pressing on
[53:21] the great reward is at the end of the
[53:23] road now I believe it was a vision but
[53:27] if it was I've never seen anything like
[53:28] it I've never seen anything like this
[53:32] never had such an experience to happen
[53:33] to me I heard it again and I hear
[53:37] someone singing that song Lord let me
[53:39] look past the curtain of
[53:41] time just then I felt something happened
[53:45] to me and I thought what's the matter
[53:47] here I looked back I could see myself
[53:49] laying on the bed so somehow whatever
[53:52] Vision whatever translation whatever it
[53:53] is he see himself on the
[53:55] bed and when I look come and running to
[53:58] me it looked to me a million young woman
[54:01] about 20 years old I never see such
[54:04] pretty woman in all my life the eyes
[54:06] look like stars the teeth as white as
[54:08] Pearl long hair hanging down to their
[54:10] waist white robes down to their feet and
[54:12] they were barefooted there were each one
[54:14] excuse me now you woman each one of them
[54:16] was running up and throwing their arms
[54:17] around me and holling our precious
[54:19] brother now let me say this I don't care
[54:22] how saintly a man is as long as he's a
[54:24] human he cannot take the other sex in
[54:26] his female without having a human
[54:27] sensation I don't care you could tell me
[54:29] that I'll tell you you're telling a
[54:31] story if you're a red blooded man now I
[54:35] looked here come a bunch of men look
[54:37] like millions of them come in from this
[54:39] way they all had on white robes they had
[54:41] shagly hair around their neck they were
[54:43] grabbing me screaming or precious
[54:44] brother and I said I don't know I turned
[54:46] around I looked and there I was laying
[54:48] on the bed now wherever it is it ain't
[54:51] very far from here it's in another
[54:53] dimension oh that's a that's a powerful
[54:55] one he said wherever it is it's not far
[54:58] from here it's just in another
[55:01] dimension he said or what I can say I
[55:04] look back I see myself laying on the bed
[55:06] I look this way and there were the
[55:08] people now if I would say perfect that
[55:12] wouldn't make it if I say superb I can't
[55:16] find the English word there is no
[55:20] yesterday no tomorrow it was all now no
[55:24] sickness no sorrow no no sin no
[55:27] tiredness they didn't eat nor drink they
[55:29] didn't sleep they didn't have two but
[55:32] yet they were
[55:34] beings and they put their arms around me
[55:37] and I feel it just like the same I feel
[55:40] my own hands like this so it's not like
[55:43] a ghost it's not your hand going through
[55:45] them and and like like Mist it's
[55:49] real now remember we have people that D
[55:51] going on you sir
[55:57] I look press through the crowd and here

[56:02] she was 22 and here she come Billy's
[56:04] mother she come right she called me her
[56:07] husband she was making her way through

[56:15] arms around me she said my darling
[56:17] brother and there were been a real
[56:20] pretty woman standing there just put her
[56:21] arms around me you said our precious
[56:23] brother then hope she put her arm that
[56:25] was my wife she put her arm around this
[56:27] other woman and said isn't it wonderful
[56:29] he's with us
[56:31] now I said I don't understand
[56:35] this and these men picked me up set me
[56:38] in a great high place and set me down
[56:41] and they were praising God none of them
[56:43] kissing me just embracing me and saying
[56:44] brother our precious brother and I
[56:46] looked people was coming from everywhere
[56:48] and I said what is this and the voice
[56:50] now from no one the same voice that
[56:52] spoke in the room was still with me he
[56:54] said this is perfect love
[56:58] amen could we give the Lord some Praises
[57:01] tonight the voice told him this is
[57:04] perfect love I've always taught the
[57:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect
[57:09] love see I believe in speaking in
[57:11] tongues but do I speak with the tongues
[57:12] of men and angels have not charity I am
[57:14] nothing become a sounding brass a
[57:15] tinkling symbol so when you speak with
[57:17] tongues and God love with it that will
[57:19] show you but the love that we would have
[57:23] here would be like
[57:27] oh my the love that we would have here
[57:30] would be like starting here from a
[57:32] shadow of a
[57:34] shadow and a shadow into a shadow and
[57:37] from a shadow to a Mist am to a little
[57:41] moisture to a little creek into a river
[57:46] and then into the ocean Hallelujah where
[57:48] it arrives there just perfect you see
[57:51] how far back he put the love it up
[57:54] here let me say it again
[57:57] he he said the love that we have here is
[58:01] like starting from a shadow of the
[58:04] shadow of the
[58:06] Shadow you hear that a shadow of the
[58:10] shadow of the Shadow into the Shadow the
[58:12] real Shadow then hallelujah and from the
[58:15] shadow to a mist and then a little
[58:18] moisture into a creek then into a river
[58:22] then into the ocean so this ocean is the
[58:24] ocean of love amen and that is where we
[58:29] pressing on
[58:31] into and where it's arriving there is
[58:33] perfect everything you couldn't die it
[58:36] couldn't be in any kind of sin I never
[58:38] be able to explain what that place was
[58:41] it was just perfect Beyond perfect and
[58:45] just then I said I don't understand what
[58:48] this is and a real beautiful woman ran
[58:50] up and said my precious brother I'm so
[58:52] happy you arrive and she turned off and
[58:54] look at her and I thought how everybody
[58:56] so pretty and so young what is this and
[58:59] the voice said in here all resemblance
[59:04] of old age and everything is brought
[59:06] back to
[59:08] Perfection that's why there's no old age
[59:10] there there's no gr hair and back pain
[59:13] and your liver and your foot and your
[59:15] heart and you had to measure and you had
[59:17] to take blood pressure that that does
[59:18] exist across there you're going back
[59:20] into that
[59:24] Perfection then this woman really pretty
[59:26] girl just put her arms around me like
[59:28] that and said just keep pressing on I
[59:30] said but I can't understand I said are
[59:32] all these Brams she said all these B she
[59:35] said the voice said they are your
[59:36] converts I said converts he said you see
[59:39] that woman you're admiring she was past
[59:42] 90 when you led her to Christ look at
[59:45] her now no wonder she scream my precious
[59:49] brother I said oh if I could only go
[59:52] back if I could only had a chance I
[59:54] would grab them I'll pull them and

[1:04:29] beat it until the reflection of the
[1:04:30] beater he could see it in it then he
[1:04:33] know he had the Dr out of it and that's
[1:04:35] the way God takes the Holy Spirit and
[1:04:38] takes the Christian and the church and
[1:04:42] beats it with the gospel back and forth
[1:04:44] back and forth until it reflects Jesus
[1:04:46] in it the Holy Spirit can see the works
[1:04:49] of Jesus going on in the church then
[1:04:52] things begin to go fine but there's too
[1:04:54] much drust in the church today too much
[1:04:57] I'm not saying it the prophet saying it
[1:04:59] now there are fine people best in the
[1:05:01] world cream with a crop but the church
[1:05:03] needs to make itself get ready amen the
[1:05:06] bride I love how everything he's saying
[1:05:09] he has a scripture to go into you know
[1:05:10] he's not just talking on the top of his
[1:05:12] head he's talking based upon the
[1:05:14] scripture because he's a prophet and I
[1:05:17] want to tell you that's the title that
[1:05:19] which is perfect is come it is come
[1:05:21] that's what he brought brother brandham

[1:05:51] be hard but you're saying amen it might
[1:05:53] be beaten but you're saying amen you not

[1:06:17] Lord some Praises stop acting childish

[1:09:56] you got your children I want to say this
[1:09:58] and our great move of the Church of the
[1:09:59] Living God in this nation has become two
[1:10:01] factions one of them is going so stiff
[1:10:03] and Ching one of them is going so stiff
[1:10:06] and stachy and intellectual and the
[1:10:08] other one when Plum off on the deep end
[1:10:10] on the other
[1:10:11] side so you see there two sides one SW
[1:10:15] on the chandelier the his Fanatics
[1:10:18] rolling on the floor carrying set of
[1:10:19] nonsense and what they dream and what
[1:10:21] they see and the spirit tell them and
[1:10:22] they hear a voice and what them on that
[1:10:24] side and they want stiff and they can't
[1:10:29] move that's exactly the truth brother
[1:10:33] when Plum to The Fanatic side there is
[1:10:35] no middle of the
[1:10:36] road and that's what we have to stay was
[1:10:39] once that tangelo sweee sweety sweee too
[1:10:41] sweet other one is a sour lemon what God
[1:10:43] want is the orange the orange is the
[1:10:46] middle are you with me
[1:10:48] now sweet swe sweet honey not the sweet
[1:10:52] of the Holy Ghost tangel and the other
[1:10:54] one s
[1:10:56] L you
[1:10:59] late a
[1:11:02] serious because they not Spirit they
[1:11:05] can't praise worship they can't relax
[1:11:07] what they stiff that why so serious with
[1:11:09] it hallelujah praise the Lord all right
[1:11:12] let's go now brother M start your
[1:11:13] perfect man first you must be born again
[1:11:16] when you born again you have faith you
[1:11:18] believe the word until you born again
[1:11:20] you will argue against it if you're
[1:11:22] religiously inclined got a human
[1:11:24] knowledge you got to do right you'll
[1:11:26] never be able to agree upon the word of
[1:11:28] God you will never do it you have got to
[1:11:30] be born again and Born Again produces
[1:11:34] fate now after you get Fai you now in a
[1:11:38] position of growing so faith is not the
[1:11:40] end faith I faith I have faith yeah
[1:11:43] you're now starting to grow Peter say
[1:11:46] add to your faith add to that Faith have
[1:11:48] six other things to go up the ladder
[1:11:51] there isn't that right now a lot of
[1:11:53] people go up to the altar say Lord
[1:11:54] forgive me me and a great experience of
[1:11:56] sanctification come upon them then you
[1:11:58] have a great time at the altar shouting
[1:12:00] you go back bless God I got it no you
[1:12:02] just got started you come to a place
[1:12:05] where you can grow you ain't got nothing
[1:12:07] yet the only thing you done is lay the
[1:12:09] foundation now you're going to build a
[1:12:11] house and you pour on the foundation boy
[1:12:14] I got her but you got the foundation to
[1:12:16] build your house on now there is the
[1:12:18] thing comes in this morning we are going
[1:12:20] to talk about it all right a house this
[1:12:22] is the foundation first now building a
[1:12:24] house you put up the uprights and and so
[1:12:27] like that right you know the old time
[1:12:29] and then he he switches now to the gold
[1:12:30] he used to make gold before they had
[1:12:32] smelted the burning beating it turn it
[1:12:34] over and over and over the Indians do
[1:12:35] that now beating gold and they beat it
[1:12:37] you know how they could tell all the
[1:12:39] iron was out of it all the dirt and
[1:12:41] stuff and the dresses out of it when the
[1:12:42] one that was beaten could see its own
[1:12:44] reflection like a mirror in it it was
[1:12:47] clean and clear enough till it reflected
[1:12:50] the beter and that's the way God does he
[1:12:53] takes the gold that he has found in the
[1:12:54] earth so so now you identifi there now
[1:12:56] you are
[1:12:59] gold come on everybody in here is
[1:13:01] supposed to say
[1:13:03] Amen when you get gold it doesn't look
[1:13:06] like gold you
[1:13:07] know that's why it had to be purified
[1:13:10] that's why it had a go fire Hallelujah
[1:13:13] because gold gold does look like a
[1:13:14] little old stone with little glitter
[1:13:16] thing on it do you understand so when
[1:13:19] God M you out from your booze and your
[1:13:20] bars and all way God find you God knew
[1:13:24] it was gold
[1:13:25] but you have your boobs and your bars
[1:13:27] and you have all them stuff with you and
[1:13:29] then you come now and the wor that to
[1:13:31] clean you up and to put fire in you and
[1:13:33] wash you and then it start to shine here
[1:13:35] and shine it all there some of you still
[1:13:38] have your booze and your BS but God
[1:13:39] going to wash you and burn you out give
[1:13:41] the Lord some Praises but you are gold
[1:13:44] Hallelujah the Lord I shout in the house
[1:13:48] Hallelujah all right so that's the way
[1:13:51] he he takes a gold he found in the earth
[1:13:53] he beats it by the Holy Spirit turn over
[1:13:55] and over beating it he can his
[1:13:57] reflection and that's what we're
[1:13:58] supposed to do reflect the Son of God he
[1:14:01] that believeth in me he could a
[1:14:02] scripture again and see how I'm doing it
[1:14:04] uh uh the works that I do shall do also
[1:14:06] then he Dro into this now so many of us
[1:14:10] try to do the works of Christ before the
[1:14:13] reflection of Christ in
[1:14:16] us that's why I was so scared of gift
[1:14:18] because I frighten human being just
[1:14:21] stick onto you know man next you make
[1:14:24] your God and some of them businesss they
[1:14:26] taking the goship normal normal you
[1:14:30] know they taking it on behalf of Jesus
[1:14:33] Christ these Hypocrites anyhow not going
[1:14:36] there tonight so many of us try to do
[1:14:38] the works of Christ before the
[1:14:40] reflection of Christ is in us now there
[1:14:42] is the
[1:14:43] trouble we see these tumbles along the
[1:14:47] road and we find there we go the scrap
[1:14:50] heap of
[1:14:51] Ministers of Christians not just just
[1:14:55] Ministers of Christian piled along the
[1:14:58] road is because they didn't go it into
[1:15:00] it right
[1:15:03] ministers like scrap
[1:15:05] iron buying scrap
[1:15:08] iron going back to the smelter you know
[1:15:11] old B old bottle
[1:15:13] buying buying old battery old iron scrap
[1:15:17] Minister the devil going around
[1:15:19] collecting them old botle
[1:15:21] by and that is why I'm here this morning
[1:15:24] trying to teach this little church how
[1:15:27] that we can become the dwelling place
[1:15:30] yes sir of the Living God that's the
[1:15:33] objective it's not you and how you see
[1:15:36] it and how you feel it and what not how
[1:15:38] you can
[1:15:40] become a dwell in
[1:15:42] place of the living
[1:15:45] godallah then he said this here
[1:15:47] justification watch notice the life that
[1:15:50] was in the husk in the stalk in the
[1:15:52] tussel ga the seed so this this is the
[1:15:55] process of the church ages what we call
[1:15:57] the church ages smna epes smna pergamos
[1:16:00] Titus sadis Philadelphia L and church is
[1:16:02] the unfolding of the life of the Corn
[1:16:05] God put down a seed and it just begin to
[1:16:07] unfold and the life keeps growing moving
[1:16:10] moving until the seed which is the bride
[1:16:13] which is you gather up all the life so
[1:16:16] the shock in the message must pull back
[1:16:18] there are people who have to all glory
[1:16:19] to God there are people who start with
[1:16:21] you they will never finish with you
[1:16:24] because they are of the scaffolding not
[1:16:25] the building and when the building is
[1:16:27] completed the scaffolding is removed oh
[1:16:29] give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord
[1:16:30] a shout in the house Hallelujah there
[1:16:33] are people as you could look back in
[1:16:34] your life they were around you to
[1:16:36] protect you and after when you grow up
[1:16:38] and mature like the shock they pull away
[1:16:39] from you and you are there as the seed
[1:16:41] getting ripen in the sun getting gold
[1:16:44] and brown while the heat dries them up
[1:16:46] oh give the Lord some Praises because
[1:16:48] that bride gathers up all the life the
[1:16:50] bride become the seed the Pentecostal
[1:16:52] was the shock Oh Glory to God they could
[1:16:55] Testify the life moved through them they
[1:16:57] could testify they once had a Revival
[1:16:59] they could testify they once have a move
[1:17:01] of God but they don't have that move
[1:17:03] right now oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:17:04] but the bride she's going to have her
[1:17:07] Revival oh give the Lord some
[1:17:09] Praises do you see it
[1:17:11] tonight so then he said one went to make
[1:17:14] the other justification made a way for
[1:17:16] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:17:18] for the Bap of Holy Ghost and the
[1:17:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:17:22] the Holy Ghost itself to come down write
[1:17:25] down in Perfection so that's what the
[1:17:26] Pentecostal didn't have because
[1:17:28] Perfection is the word and the word
[1:17:29] comes to a prophet and they rejected the
[1:17:31] prophet they rejected the word they
[1:17:32] couldn't come to Perfection they
[1:17:34] couldn't come to adoption they couldn't
[1:17:35] come to spiritual maturity so here he
[1:17:37] brought you out oh glory to God to lay
[1:17:40] the word inside of you that you could
[1:17:42] come to maturity when I was a child I
[1:17:44] spake like a child I understood like a
[1:17:46] child but when that is perfect has come
[1:17:48] it is here oh give the Lord a shout it's
[1:17:50] the word to form you into the word image
[1:17:53] that you could reflect Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] Hallelujah as many has received him to
[1:17:57] them he gave power to become the sons of
[1:18:00] God is that instant son is that message
[1:18:02] son it that spoken book on top of your
[1:18:03] head son is not that kind of son is you
[1:18:05] have to become son a process by which
[1:18:07] you become the sons of God oh give the
[1:18:10] Lord I shout in the house
[1:18:14] Hallelujah
[1:18:15] woo my God almost finished
[1:18:18] here election in Abraham Hallelujah
[1:18:21] justification in Isaac Grace in Jacob
[1:18:26] but Grace in Jacob but perfection in
[1:18:29] Joseph nothing against him a perfect man
[1:18:33] a perfect of Christ so our type is
[1:18:37] Joseph not Jacob not Abraham Joseph a
[1:18:41] perfect type of Christ he is the
[1:18:44] reflection hallelujah look at those four
[1:18:46] Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[1:18:49] Joseph Abraham calling Isaac election
[1:18:52] and so on and Jacob Grace but Joseph
[1:18:54] Perfection nothing against him that was
[1:18:58] God working its way out so if God start
[1:19:02] a work in you put a germ in you a button
[1:19:06] in you a light in you God himself
[1:19:09] working his way out to bring you to what
[1:19:12] to bring you to Perfection What is the
[1:19:15] fivefold ministry for for the perfecting
[1:19:17] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:19:19] ministry the bride has got to come to
[1:19:21] perfection in order to bring on a
[1:19:23] resurrection oh give the Lord some
[1:19:25] Praises Hallelujah we couldn't come to
[1:19:28] perfection in past ages because that
[1:19:30] which is perfect did not come but when
[1:19:33] God sent Malachi 4 the Lord a shout he
[1:19:36] brought forth that which is perfect and
[1:19:38] we have it here the perfect
[1:19:40] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:19:42] Vindication oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:19:44] the house Hallelujah that is what
[1:19:46] brotherr brought the perfect
[1:19:48] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:19:51] Vindication that's why we can say what
[1:19:53] the tape say because we know is the
[1:19:55] perfect interpretation of the
[1:19:57] word
[1:19:59] hallelujah oh do you love him
[1:20:02] tonight
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:09] Hallelujah
[1:20:11] wo my my my my my my my glory musician
[1:20:16] Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready
[1:20:19] Get Ready all right this Joseph is what
[1:20:23] was the type of
[1:20:26] Perfection I want to talk about the
[1:20:28] Joseph
[1:20:31] anointing the anointing of
[1:20:34] Joseph this anointing is what do make
[1:20:36] you resist the
[1:20:37] Jezebels and the ptif for
[1:20:41] wiv this Joseph
[1:20:43] anointing you could see virtue in that
[1:20:46] man you could see Temperance in that man
[1:20:50] Hallelujah because Satan always prepares
[1:20:53] his Delila
[1:20:55] to bring down God Samson Hallelujah
[1:20:58] while you working on your virtue Satan
[1:20:59] working on his business
[1:21:03] too watch something here
[1:21:08] now judges 16 verse 15 this is theila
[1:21:13] now recognized that Samson playing games
[1:21:16] with her she said unto him how can thou
[1:21:19] say I love
[1:21:20] thee when thy heart is not with me thou
[1:21:24] has mocked me these three times and has
[1:21:25] not told me wearing thy great strength
[1:21:28] liar so when the devil see a man it may
