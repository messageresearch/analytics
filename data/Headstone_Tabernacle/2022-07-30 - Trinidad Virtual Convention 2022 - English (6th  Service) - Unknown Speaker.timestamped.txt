[27:50] uh partakers of this
[27:52] um meetings amen
[27:55] so
[27:56] before i say anything
[27:58] i just picked a scripture from
[28:01] inspiration that brother theo
[28:04] gave for the meetings
[28:05] from the book of ephesians chapter 6
[28:07] verse 12
[28:09] amen therefore we wrestle not against
[28:12] flesh and blood but against
[28:14] principalities against powers
[28:17] against the rulers of the darkness of
[28:19] this world
[28:20] against spiritual wickedness in high
[28:23] places
[28:24] these are the things that we are
[28:27] wrestling against
[28:29] and we thank god that
[28:31] before
[28:33] our enemy
[28:34] was became our enemy god had made a way
[28:38] for us
[28:40] and we are
[28:41] going to face this battle and win this
[28:44] battle
[28:45] because this battle was worn for us
[28:48] before the foundation of the world
[28:51] no matter how the day i will try to come
[28:54] against a believer
[28:56] i tell you god already made a way for us
[29:00] amen
[29:02] was saying something in the message here
[29:04] the conflict
[29:06] between god and satan
[29:08] our prophet said he said now what is the
[29:11] word of god
[29:13] and the word of god would defeat satan
[29:15] anywhere at any time at any place
[29:20] when rama said what is the word of god
[29:23] so the word of god is god himself
[29:27] so god gave the believer himself
[29:31] one scream amen
[29:33] is that as god himself he gave the
[29:35] believer to attack the enemy by
[29:39] in other words he is the father and the
[29:41] word is god and the word is our father
[29:45] so god gave you his word to attack the
[29:48] enemy
[29:50] at any time at anywhere at any place
[29:55] before the coming of the lord the world
[29:57] is in a great condition it's not
[29:58] terrible conditions in a sodom condition
[30:01] but we have a promise of the holy ghost
[30:04] that by this promise of the holy ghost
[30:07] we are going to win this battle we can
[30:10] attack the devil anywhere at any place
[30:13] at any time
[30:15] amen
[30:17] oh praise god
[30:19] hallelujah so there is no need to fear
[30:23] friends brothers and sisters there is no
[30:25] need to fear
[30:26] we have the word which can defeat the
[30:29] devil at any place
[30:31] at any time
[30:35] in the message here the evening time
[30:37] messenger ram said here we are
[30:40] we are at the end time
[30:42] the red light is down
[30:44] it's flashing
[30:46] the coming of the lord is at hand
[30:49] wars rumors of war earthquakes nations
[30:53] are breaking
[30:54] the coming of the lord is a time said
[30:56] yes sir listen
[30:58] the end time message
[31:00] which is the word
[31:02] should meet the end time conditions
[31:06] there is not going to be a battle lost
[31:10] we are going to win those battles the
[31:12] end time president should meet the end
[31:14] time condition
[31:15] where they got off the message or to
[31:18] bring it back
[31:20] oh my all the ones that we lost god is
[31:23] going to bring it back
[31:24] he's going to replenish he's going to
[31:27] bring it back so always the end time
[31:30] message
[31:31] meets the end time condition
[31:33] all the way through the scripture i was
[31:35] in the scripture
[31:37] there was a wall of jericho and there
[31:39] was a word to overcome the wall of the
[31:41] walls of jericho praise god there was a
[31:44] sodom and there was a word he came down
[31:49] to confirm the promise to abraham there
[31:51] was a red sea and there was a word to
[31:54] meet the condition at the time
[31:57] so this battle
[31:59] that is on the earth now it's not
[32:01] physical it's spiritual
[32:03] we are going to win this battle
[32:06] in the mighty name of jesus
[32:08] amen
[32:10] oh praise god
[32:12] we are going to this battle not as
[32:14] though
[32:15] we know the tactics but we are going in

[37:42] well at this time
[37:43] it's our honor and our privilege amen to
[37:45] introduce our speaker for this today's
[37:47] service amen
[37:51] amen all the way from ghana
[37:53] amen and we certainly thank god for him
[37:56] and his ministry and we know that god
[37:58] has placed upon the heart of his servant
[38:01] a message from the lord so we just enter
[38:04] in now and just receive from god today
[38:07] amen get in the spirit praise god
[38:09] worship amen and i'm
[38:12] sure that god will touch you and speak
[38:14] to you in a special way god let you
[38:16] bless you as he comes in jesus name amen
[38:19] and amen
[38:23] amen you love him
[38:26] so as we go straight to the word
[38:28] the book of revelations chapter 12 verse
[38:31] 7 to 12
[38:33] and then second peter 2 1-6
[38:37] amen
[38:39] he said and there was war in heaven
[38:42] michael and his angels fought against
[38:44] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[38:47] angels
[38:48] and prevailed not
[38:50] neither was their place found anywhere
[38:53] in heaven
[38:55] and the great dragon was cast out that
[38:57] old serpent called the devil this and
[39:00] satan which deceived the whole world
[39:03] and he was cast in out into the earth
[39:06] and his angels were cast out with him
[39:10] and i had a loud voice saying in heaven
[39:12] now is salvation come
[39:15] and strained in the kingdom of our god
[39:18] and the power of his christ
[39:20] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[39:23] down which accuses them before our god
[39:26] day and night
[39:27] and they overcame him by the blood of
[39:29] the lamb
[39:30] praise god
[39:32] so you've got to overcome now by the
[39:34] blood of the lamb not by might not by
[39:37] power not by revelation but by the blood
[39:40] of the lamb praise god and by the word
[39:45] of their testimony
[39:47] so i am the bride i will never fall the
[39:50] word is sure by the word of your
[39:52] testimony
[39:54] praise god and they love not their lives
[39:58] unto death
[40:00] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[40:03] dwell in them
[40:04] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[40:07] of the
[40:08] seal for the devil is and of the sea for
[40:12] the devil is come down unto you having
[40:15] great wrath because he knew it that he
[40:18] had but a short time
[40:20] praise god
[40:22] amen and the second peter 2 verse 1
[40:28] but there was false but there were false
[40:30] prophets among the people
[40:32] even as there were false teachers among
[40:34] you who probably bring
[40:37] damnable heresies even denying the lord
[40:40] that brought them
[40:41] that bought them and bring upon
[40:43] themselves with destruction
[40:45] and many shall follow their penitus ways
[40:48] by reason of whom the way of truth shall
[40:50] be evil spoken of
[40:53] and though and true convertedness shall
[40:55] they with vain words make merchandise
[40:59] view
[41:00] whose judgment now of a long time
[41:03] lingered not
[41:04] and their damnation slumbered not for if
[41:07] god spared not the angels that sinned
[41:10] but cast them down to hell and delivered
[41:13] them into the chains of darkness to be
[41:15] reserved unto judgment and spared not
[41:17] the old world but saved noah the eighth
[41:20] person a preacher of righteousness
[41:23] bringing in the flood upon the world of
[41:26] the ungodly and turning their cities the
[41:29] cities of sudam and gomura into ashes
[41:32] condemned them with an overthrow
[41:34] making them an example unto those that
[41:37] are
[41:39] that after should live ungodly
[41:43] may the lord add a blessing
[41:45] to the reign of his word
[41:47] amen you may be seated

[43:40] thank god that amen
[43:42] god has never left the world without a
[43:44] witness
[43:45] and the witness is his word and how does
[43:48] he leave a witness is to vindicate that
[43:50] word so the word must be vindicated
[43:53] praise god to the church of laodicea
[43:55] right to him that overcome it praise god
[43:59] and we are taking the written word we

[44:06] angel praise god and we are overcoming
[44:09] we are fighting we are pressing oh it is

[44:50] you may be seated
[44:52] so we are preparing for the battle
[44:54] amen i sent i sent the invitation to a
[44:58] fellow ministry brother and he sent back
[45:00] a question is there any battle to fight

[46:05] spirit of the spirit power of his power
[46:08] the word is the only thing that can be
[46:10] vindicated outside of that word it
[46:12] cannot be vindicated systems cannot be
[46:15] vindicated church system cannot be
[46:17] vindicated men's ideas will never be
[46:20] vindicated but the word is the only
[46:22] thing that god vindicated oh glory be to
[46:26] the name of the living god that is why
[46:28] when they came with denominational
[46:30] spirits god could not vindicate that
[46:33] hallelujah protestant spirit could not
[46:35] be vindicated but the word was always
[46:39] vindicated because he's the same
[46:41] yesterday
[46:42] he's the same today he's the same
[46:44] forever and the word came to call out a
[46:47] bride not a church now a bride that will
[46:51] vindicate that word
[46:53] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[46:56] amen you may be seated hallelujah let's
[47:00] ride into the message this morning so

[47:06] what is your prophecy there shall be a
[47:08] bride hallelujah there shall be an
[47:10] overcomer bride that's your prophecy now
[47:13] but you must get into the spirit of
[47:16] being the bride that will overcome glory

[47:22] this morning i remember in joshua
[47:25] chapter 15
[47:26] hallelujah from the verse 10 you
[47:28] remember when moses gave the promise
[47:32] unto caleb
[47:33] of that mountain praise god when they
[47:36] got into the promised land
[47:38] caleb had to get into the spirit of his
[47:42] prophecy
[47:43] hallelujah and he reminded joshua i am
[47:46] this day are strong i'm not all now i am
[47:49] this day as strong even as the day moses
[47:53] made that promise
[47:55] oh he got into the spirit he wasn't
[47:58] looking at the demons he wasn't looking
[48:00] at the position he was looking at the
[48:02] promise it was a prophecy over caleb my
[48:06] hero stefan in faith give me this day
[48:09] now there for my mountain oh hallelujah
[48:11] and that is our promise we are standing
[48:14] today give me this day that capstone

[48:21] this day the dynamic because that is the
[48:23] only thing that will give you power to
[48:25] overcome the enemy oh
[48:28] blessed be the name of a living god
[48:32] hallelujah so caleb got into the spirit
[48:35] of his prophecy
[48:36] you get it now and the bride must get
[48:39] into the promise you must get into the
[48:42] spirit of your prophecy

[48:55] lord had kept me alive
[48:58] come on now he was all he was weak he
[49:01] was tired but he knew the promise would
[49:03] never fail the lord has kept me alive
[49:06] because there was a prophecy over caleb
[49:09] that that mountain belongs to you and to
[49:11] your children and to your tribe caleb
[49:14] held on to the promise he was fighting
[49:16] not just to get anywhere but to get to

[49:52] this word unto moses

[1:06:20] said he sent us elijah the prophet to
[1:06:24] restore our hearts back and every

[1:07:32] ideas but we've got to take our own
[1:07:34] ideas the way
[1:07:35] the holy spirit will direct us and what
[1:07:38] ideas he would give us because he is the
[1:07:41] commandeering officer

[1:09:47] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:09:50] peter stood up and said this is that
[1:09:54] this is that because the prophet joel
[1:09:56] had put in it in the written word and
[1:09:59] peter could identify with a written word
[1:10:01] and said this is that that was spoken by

[1:18:13] didn't care who was cheering me up i
[1:18:16] didn't care who was lifting me up all i
[1:18:18] was interested was in the finish line
[1:18:22] and that is our secret today praise god
[1:18:26] and he made it by the grace of god
[1:18:29] brother said be certain
[1:18:32] that's all we want to do be certain
[1:18:35] prepare yourself for the battle
[1:18:37] abraham then said the greatest battle
[1:18:39] ever what is going on right now here
[1:18:41] between life and death
[1:18:47] between life and death
[1:18:49] between sickness and health between
[1:18:51] faith and doubt oh my
[1:18:54] between liberty and bondage
[1:18:57] ah
[1:18:59] you combined yourself thinking you are
[1:19:01] doing all the service
[1:19:03] ah
[1:19:04] but it's time to break free because we
[1:19:06] have not received a spirit of bonding
[1:19:08] again to fear but we have received the
[1:19:10] spirit of adoption
[1:19:13] whereby we cry our father our father
[1:19:16] it's me again lord it's me again lord
[1:19:19] it's me again father hallelujah
[1:19:22] praise god
[1:19:23] the battle is between faith and doubt
[1:19:26] between liberty and bondage the battle
[1:19:29] is on shine your spear soldiers
[1:19:32] polish up the armor god is getting his
[1:19:35] soldiers ready amen
[1:19:37] that's what god is getting ready now
[1:19:39] hallelujah
[1:19:41] now
[1:19:42] the greatest battle you may be seeing
[1:19:46] the prophet then goes on to take on the
[1:19:48] whole arm of god is it in his army
[1:19:52] he presents his army in the form of five
[1:19:55] offices
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:59] god
[1:20:00] praise god presents
[1:20:03] his army in the form of what five
[1:20:05] offices

[1:20:13] pastors evangelists that is his army
[1:20:17] that is his soldiers that is his
[1:20:19] commanding officers
[1:20:21] all with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:30] so the apostle will never dictate to the
[1:20:32] pastor
[1:20:34] the pastor will not dictate to the
[1:20:35] teacher
[1:20:36] oh
[1:20:37] praise god with the baptism of the holy
[1:20:40] ghost waiting out there to meet the
[1:20:42] enemy on any grounds he comes upon
[1:20:45] god is the one that says in the church
[1:20:47] not man set in the church that is why
[1:20:50] you see the battle today between
[1:20:53] monsters in the church and god said in
[1:20:56] the church all filled with the holy
[1:20:58] spirit but man said in the church
[1:21:01] becomes the holy ghost
[1:21:03] man's holy ghost but god said in the
[1:21:06] church all filled with the holy spirit
[1:21:13] that's the battle today
[1:21:15] that is the battle today but we are
[1:21:18] going to fight we're not going to give
[1:21:20] up we are going to fight until these
[1:21:22] spirits are defeated in the name of
[1:21:25] jesus christ and god's children will be
[1:21:28] liberated why because god word cannot
[1:21:31] fail and we are in the spirit of our
[1:21:34] prophecy

[1:21:40] hallelujah the brother said his army his
[1:21:42] soldiers his commanding officers all

[1:21:47] waiting out there to meet the enemy on
[1:21:49] any grounds he come on to meet the enemy
[1:21:52] with the word
[1:21:55] that word must be spoken by that prophet
[1:22:00] because what that bride will say
[1:22:02] the prophet will say and what that
[1:22:05] prophet said the bride will say and what
[1:22:08] they will say would have been said in
[1:22:10] the world
[1:22:16] not an interpretation of what they think
[1:22:19] it is
[1:22:20] what he said
[1:22:24] oh come on church
[1:22:27] traveling on the right road
[1:22:30] there is one way
[1:22:32] to the city of god

[1:22:50] each one
[1:22:51] backing one another up
[1:22:55] so listen listen listen
[1:22:58] there is no
[1:23:00] scripture
[1:23:02] sit down
[1:23:03] there is no scripture
[1:23:06] in the bible
[1:23:08] or the prophet
[1:23:10] that says there's always going to be a
[1:23:13] man of the hour we have to look up to
[1:23:17] that's a lie from the beat of hell
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:24] are you hearing me now
[1:23:26] because they will be backing one another
[1:23:28] up on the world so no man is going to be
[1:23:32] giving inspiration to the whole world

[1:24:06] the word the chief captain not out there

[1:24:21] the holy ghost
[1:24:23] hallelujah did you hear me that not they

[1:24:28] but the holy ghost in them
[1:24:30] that is the army
[1:24:32] that is the army vindicating vindicating

[1:26:33] had to take the blood and anything that
[1:26:36] stopped the blood from being shed was
[1:26:38] satan

[1:26:41] redemption to be restored back in
[1:26:44] completeness
[1:26:45] oh but it was time for redemption it was
[1:26:48] time for the blood to be shed oh

[1:28:13] any individual that reasons against one
[1:28:16] punctuation of god's word is your enemy
[1:28:22] and how do you fight that enemy it takes
[1:28:24] the word to defeat the enemy
[1:28:27] so he said it is not so

[1:28:31] i will not bow
[1:28:33] i will stand there
[1:28:35] let me be just be one man there was one
[1:28:38] righteous lot whose righteous soul was
[1:28:41] fixed in sodom but lord knew praise god
[1:28:45] that what was going on in sodom was not
[1:28:48] right it was ungodly god sent down the
[1:28:51] angel to get lord out of that place
[1:28:53] stand there with the word don't never
[1:28:55] deviate from the word stand there praise
[1:28:58] god hallelujah
[1:29:01] oh
[1:29:02] let me just finish now so the prophet
[1:29:05] said in the fourth seal you maybe see
[1:29:06] that he said now the battle started in
[1:29:09] heaven it will be finished on the end
[1:29:12] it started to be finished here so
[1:29:14] michael detected the light of satan and
[1:29:17] kicked him out his angels were kicked
[1:29:19] out prayed but they still got some
[1:29:21] angels to believe they are alive and
[1:29:23] they were cast down from heaven and the
[1:29:25] brother said that war will finish on the
[1:29:27] earth but brother i am one of them that
[1:29:30] will finish that battle i'm one of them
[1:29:33] that has got my soul thrown out i'm one
[1:29:35] of them friend or no friend the
[1:29:38] nomination of no denomination praise god
[1:29:40] whether i maintain my family or not let
[1:29:43] me maintain christ the word oh
[1:29:47] glory be to the living god
[1:29:50] hallelujah it will be finished on the
[1:29:52] earth in the form of the armageddon now
[1:29:54] let's watch and see it unfold and maybe
[1:29:58] we can unfold it if the lord help us
[1:30:01] right now to do this now watch it unfold
[1:30:03] abraham said the mystery rider watch him
[1:30:06] now what does he do now or post
[1:30:09] refuse to repent and go back to the
[1:30:12] original blood world
[1:30:14] that's all
[1:30:17] i got it right now that mysterious rider
[1:30:21] refused to repent
[1:30:24] pride and arrogance can't take
[1:30:26] correction about everybody but god made
[1:30:29] us one the same by one's spirit we are
[1:30:32] all baptized into the body satan cannot
[1:30:35] repent
[1:30:36] satan cannot repent so he refused to
[1:30:39] repent
[1:30:41] and go back to the original word the
[1:30:44] world became blood and fleshy he refused
[1:30:47] to go back to it is the antichrist
[1:30:51] the true white bride he is opposed to
[1:30:53] the true wet bride
[1:30:56] you see that
[1:31:03] this spirit is opposed to the true wet
[1:31:07] bride and that is the contention of the
[1:31:10] battle
[1:31:12] but thank god no man puts you in the
[1:31:13] pride and no man takes no man out of the
[1:31:16] pride god called his bride elected the
[1:31:19] bride put the word seat there and you
[1:31:21] will stand there
[1:31:23] oh
[1:31:24] unshakeable unmovable praise god
[1:31:28] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:31:32] oh glory to god amen opposed refused to
[1:31:36] repent and go back to the original blood
[1:31:37] word the word become blood and flesh see
[1:31:41] he refused to go back to is antichrist
[1:31:44] the true white bride he is opposed to
[1:31:46] the true white bride
[1:31:48] takes his own bride
[1:31:51] this antichrist spirit
[1:31:54] takes his own bride
[1:31:56] he opposes the true bride too he takes
[1:31:59] his own bride and brings it to him in
[1:32:02] the form of religion called chris and
[1:32:05] dogma
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] what the prophet didn't say they can't
[1:32:10] find so they say even the prophet could
[1:32:12] not reveal this
[1:32:14] but there is no body that the word comes
[1:32:17] to than the prophets
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:26] so read those spoken word books
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:31] don't you ever praise god
[1:32:34] substitute the spoken word books for no
[1:32:37] man
[1:32:38] read them
[1:32:39] because every gun has a front and a back
[1:32:42] side
[1:32:43] praise god but the gun without the
[1:32:46] bullet is useless
[1:32:48] no matter how powerful that gun looks
[1:32:50] like whenever the bullet is useless the
[1:32:53] gun is the word the prophet's message is
[1:32:56] that bullet that brings the fire praise
[1:32:59] god oh the backside
[1:33:01] connecting with the front side
[1:33:04] exposes the enemy fires the enemy
[1:33:07] defeats the enemy bring the enemy down
[1:33:11] praise god
[1:33:12] oh don't never let down the books say
[1:33:15] what the prophet said hold on to that
[1:33:18] prophet's word praise god because one
[1:33:21] day we are going to line up behind that
[1:33:23] prophet
[1:33:24] hallelujah
[1:33:25] oh here comes the pride we are going to
[1:33:28] line behind our prophet we're going to
[1:33:30] lie behind william branham we are not
[1:33:32] ashamed of him we will declare it will
[1:33:35] declare the word that god gave william
[1:33:38] braham praise god that the apostle will
[1:33:40] pick the evangelists will pick the
[1:33:42] teachers will pick the pastors will pick
[1:33:45] they will come through by the prophet's
[1:33:48] word they will not bring a new thing now
[1:33:52] it will be the same thing
[1:33:54] praise god
[1:33:55] jesus christ the same yesterday the same
[1:33:58] today the same forever
[1:34:01] all by this holy spirit refused to
[1:34:05] recognize the true word pride takes his
[1:34:07] own bride he opposes the true bride too
[1:34:10] and takes his own bride and brings it to
[1:34:12] him
[1:34:14] in the form of cretes and dogma see and
[1:34:18] now seeing the holy bride he is against
[1:34:21] her he forms his own bride called the
[1:34:24] antichrist by antichrist teaching
[1:34:28] one word
[1:34:30] he fell
[1:34:32] short of the glory of the world one word
[1:34:40] so you better have your eyes on the
[1:34:42] world
[1:34:45] don't take reasoning now
[1:34:48] take the word as it is written
[1:34:54] praise god
[1:34:57] satan don't care about oratory
[1:35:01] and pick this mystery here join that to
[1:35:03] this one bring this one here sealed one
[1:35:06] and reveal one and join it together
[1:35:09] satan don't fear that
[1:35:14] that don't produce power in the believer
[1:35:20] god
[1:35:21] in simplicity
[1:35:24] but abraham prayed that message
[1:35:26] hiding and revealing himself in
[1:35:30] simplicity
[1:35:36] are you following me now we've got to
[1:35:39] get in the spirit of our prophecy
[1:35:42] glory
[1:35:44] let's get out of here praise god but he
[1:35:46] forms his own bride called the
[1:35:48] antichrist by what antichrist teaching
[1:35:53] how does he form his bride by antichrist
[1:35:56] teaching
[1:35:57] antichrist don't mean that you reject
[1:35:59] the prophet it doesn't mean you reject
[1:36:02] the word but it is injecting your own
[1:36:05] ideas to what the prophet did not say or
[1:36:08] trying to get a higher revelation of
[1:36:11] what the prophet said
[1:36:14] he means what he says and the prophet
[1:36:18] every apostles doctrine is have you
[1:36:21] received the holy ghost since you
[1:36:24] believed
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:32] we heard of some adoptions two three
[1:36:34] years ago
[1:36:36] and can't forgive odds can't drop out
[1:36:39] can't talk to one another what kind of
[1:36:41] adoption is that that's evil spirit
[1:36:45] upon men
[1:36:47] oh church of the living god
[1:36:50] bride of christ around the world
[1:36:52] you can deceive yourself
[1:36:55] stand still and see the salvation of
[1:36:58] your god
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:06] praise god
[1:37:08] he is against her but he forms his own
[1:37:10] bride called the antichrist by
[1:37:11] antichrist teaching which is contrary to
[1:37:14] christ see how shrewd he is and now
[1:37:18] instead of having a unity of love
[1:37:20] controlling worship under the blood he's
[1:37:23] got a denomination
[1:37:28] the prophet is a man sent from god with
[1:37:31] the sea of the lord these things are
[1:37:33] taking place today
[1:37:35] run for your life stay with that
[1:37:38] vindicated word
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:51] praise god
[1:37:53] uh instead of having a unity of love
[1:37:56] controlling worship under the blood he's
[1:37:58] got a denomination instead of having the
[1:38:01] word he took chris dogmas and so forth
[1:38:06] that's the enemy
[1:38:09] praise god
[1:38:11] who was the dragon the congregation says
[1:38:13] satan
[1:38:14] says satan what nation did he represent
[1:38:17] congregations is wrong and he had angels
[1:38:21] said didn't the bible say that in the
[1:38:23] last days
[1:38:25] that the ministering spirits of the
[1:38:27] devil would be like flaming angels
[1:38:36] is the life behind the name
[1:38:39] my brother if you're gonna preach me a
[1:38:41] same one leave me a sermon

[1:40:12] and no devil better stay my way get out
[1:40:15] of my way praise god because i am in the
[1:40:18] spirit of my prophecy
[1:40:21] nothing will stop me pray i'm headed to
[1:40:23] perfection i'm headed for adoption i'm
[1:40:26] headed for the holy ghost itself
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:32] glory
[1:40:35] let's expose this enemy and get out of
[1:40:38] here
[1:40:39] praise god
[1:40:40] hallelujah what nation did he represent
[1:40:44] rome and he had angels during the bible
[1:40:47] say that in the last days the municipal
[1:40:50] spirits of the devil would be like
[1:40:52] flaming angels
[1:40:54] but if they speak not according to this
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:01] but if they
[1:41:02] speak not according to this let them
[1:41:05] alone
[1:41:09] from such
[1:41:10] turn away
[1:41:15] listen the life of the prophet he said
[1:41:17] you couldn't tell his enemy from his
[1:41:20] friend
[1:41:24] but the brown will not call somebody a
[1:41:26] devil
[1:41:28] even if god showed him
[1:41:31] around us to show him the best of love
[1:41:34] because god is love
[1:41:40] today we can call fellow ministers black
[1:41:42] members and think he's
[1:41:44] okay
[1:41:46] that's demon powers
[1:41:51] if you see your brother in the wrong
[1:41:53] yours is to pray
[1:41:56] let your heart reach out
[1:42:00] do everything you can to reconcile your
[1:42:03] brother
[1:42:05] that is in the wrong way
[1:42:11] i gotta be now
[1:42:12] oh glory
[1:42:14] oh
[1:42:15] but listen hell now
[1:42:18] but if they speak not according to this
[1:42:20] let them alone
[1:42:21] the devil will transform his messengers
[1:42:24] into angel of light and organize right
[1:42:27] back just like exactly rome did brother
[1:42:30] sister i don't see where you could find
[1:42:33] a loophole in that
[1:42:36] you can't find a loophole in what he
[1:42:37] said
[1:42:38] if he doesn't speak according to the
[1:42:40] word if you divide the body that's not
[1:42:42] of christ
[1:42:43] any revelation that divides the body of
[1:42:46] christ is from the beat of hell
[1:42:54] all right oh are you getting me now
[1:42:58] wherever i said god has just got it all
[1:43:00] walled up there
[1:43:02] right here in his word and there it is
[1:43:05] he said he did it now see
[1:43:08] michael
[1:43:09] the archangel the great one that stands
[1:43:12] in the presence of god and his angels
[1:43:14] fought against satan and his angels the
[1:43:16] red dragon and that was christ that is
[1:43:19] that's lead by the holy spirit and his
[1:43:23] angels of god fought against the
[1:43:25] organization
[1:43:28] so anything that is organization
[1:43:31] fight against it
[1:43:33] don't ever be yoked with organization
[1:43:36] nothing that ever organized god moved
[1:43:39] with it god rejected it right there
[1:43:46] god is calling out a word bride
[1:43:48] that will fight the good fight of faith
[1:43:52] to take a stand
[1:43:54] don't reject it don't despise but god is
[1:43:57] with that little pride
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] see
[1:44:04] the prophet said now amen
[1:44:06] fought against the organization and his
[1:44:08] angels and ministers of light
[1:44:12] these things have to be manifested or
[1:44:14] else the prophet will not put it there
[1:44:17] so once it is there you better watch out
[1:44:19] for that spirit is a spirit now that has
[1:44:22] got to be manifested
[1:44:25] so don't be afraid
[1:44:27] when you hear all these funny doctrines
[1:44:29] flying here and there stay with the wind
[1:44:36] then goes on see
[1:44:38] how perfect if they are speaking not of
[1:44:40] something up into glory speaking of
[1:44:43] spiritual peace in rome
[1:44:46] it is not speaking of some spiritual
[1:44:48] peace in glory
[1:44:49] not speaking of some angels in heaven
[1:44:52] he's speaking about men on the earth
[1:44:56] with that organizational spirit
[1:45:00] see oh
[1:45:02] and they prevail not amen is it and the
[1:45:06] great dragon was cast down that serpent
[1:45:08] called the devil satan we deceived the
[1:45:11] whole end that roman power going into
[1:45:14] every nation that city that rules over
[1:45:17] all the air he deceived it many churches
[1:45:21] organizing just like him
[1:45:27] many churches in the message organizing
[1:45:29] like rome
[1:45:30] don't talk to this one i've nothing to
[1:45:32] this one they have rejected the man with
[1:45:34] the angel no man is with no angel on the
[1:45:37] earth the angel of the lord is with the
[1:45:40] bride fixing things for the coming of
[1:45:42] the lord but abram had the angel praise
[1:45:46] god but that angel stood there is here
[1:45:49] today at that day shall michael the
[1:45:52] great priest stand for his people
[1:45:55] not standing with no man
[1:45:57] christ in his people
[1:46:01] no man
[1:46:05] is with no angel
[1:46:07] he might be with a fallen angel that i'm
[1:46:09] not i don't know
[1:46:11] but to be with an angel of god never
[1:46:15] be afraid of this
[1:46:17] semantics and
[1:46:19] gimmicks and
[1:46:21] resistances around the world forget
[1:46:23] about it god can't vindicate that
[1:46:28] you get it now
[1:46:29] the roman power is going into every
[1:46:32] nation
[1:46:33] the roman word power is going into every
[1:46:36] nation that city that rules over all the
[1:46:38] earth he deceived many churches
[1:46:40] organizing just like him see
[1:46:42] making an image onto the beasts
[1:46:47] but thank god

[1:47:06] by the authority of jesus christ of
[1:47:10] nazareth whom you crucified it is by him
[1:47:13] that we do what we do

[1:47:19] don't mention his name again
[1:47:21] oh we cannot help but speak of the
[1:47:24] things we have heard and seen we cannot
[1:47:27] help us speak of what malachi 4 has said
[1:47:30] we're going to help us speak of the
[1:47:32] promises that is left for the pride we
[1:47:34] go outside of the promises you have done
[1:47:37] cut yourself off from god

[1:48:00] so god gave you the best
[1:48:02] oh that he said to elijah the prophet
[1:48:05] the best to tie up every loose end
[1:48:09] oh come on church god gave you the best

[1:48:31] best the spoken word is the original
[1:48:34] seed to call out a bride now we found
[1:48:37] out that god gave his children the best
[1:48:39] and therefore he didn't have to improve
[1:48:42] it
[1:48:45] willie abraham's grammar we don't need
[1:48:47] to improve it
[1:48:49] if he said when for come i will say wait
[1:48:53] you can mark my grammar wrong that's
[1:48:55] what the prophet said
[1:48:57] i am not in a position to correct the
[1:48:59] prophet
[1:49:01] it means this he meant that no he means
[1:49:04] what he has said
[1:49:06] and i believe he's just the same way and
[1:49:08] he's working for me the same
[1:49:11] come on now he didn't have to improve it
[1:49:15] he never changes he hasn't changed one
[1:49:18] bit since the first time he gave his
[1:49:20] children protection i get in it there is
[1:49:24] war in heaven
[1:49:25] remember there is one in heaven he had
[1:49:28] to kick out satan then he came down on
[1:49:30] the head and fortified his children with
[1:49:33] the word so he just didn't kick the
[1:49:35] devil down he came down himself and
[1:49:38] fortified you at night with the word
[1:49:40] that we can have a defense we can have
[1:49:42] our protection we can stand there and
[1:49:45] tell the devil we are children of the
[1:49:47] original word we are the spoken word
[1:49:50] original bride the word is in the bride
[1:49:54] and that bride will stand there praise
[1:49:56] god undefeated

[1:50:00] oh glory be to the living god but i want
[1:50:04] to ask you something
[1:50:06] eve did not
[1:50:08] while she was standing in that great
[1:50:10] fortress of his word now satan was on
[1:50:12] the outside
[1:50:14] trying to use some kind of technique to
[1:50:16] get her out there
[1:50:18] i got him you know trying to use some
[1:50:20] technique you know the prophet even
[1:50:22] didn't reveal this then people with
[1:50:24] itching ears want to hear what the
[1:50:27] prophet didn't reveal but in the days of
[1:50:29] the voice oh of that sabbath angel when
[1:50:32] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:50:35] god should be finished as i declare to
[1:50:38] his seven the prophet i am staying here
[1:50:41] i am staying here with malachi 4
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:50] satan was on the outside
[1:50:52] trying to use some kind of technique to
[1:50:54] get her out here for as long as she
[1:50:57] stayed behind the world everything was
[1:51:00] fine
[1:51:02] young people as long as you stay behind

[1:51:14] oh that's where we make our mistake
[1:51:17] we make our mistake when we get from

[1:51:22] bible believers think it that way we get
[1:51:25] from the world then we are in trouble
[1:51:28] as long as we keep the world ahead of us
[1:51:32] don't get ahead of the word
[1:51:34] let the word get ahead of you see
[1:51:37] you just let it go first and you just
[1:51:41] leave behind right behind it
[1:51:43] it plows the ditch you just walk in it
[1:51:47] and that is the way it goes
[1:51:50] i get it me now
[1:51:52] brown said now in them

[1:53:56] overcome by the way
[1:53:58] the prophet said now but these systems
[1:54:01] will not grow out of that because it's a
[1:54:03] system it cannot bring forth
[1:54:06] systems cannot bring forth
[1:54:10] it were to go by men's revelations who

[2:04:02] the wheat everything else comes right
[2:04:04] back to his head where he started from
[2:04:07] kane and abel went bright heading up in
[2:04:10] the passing of the word of god made
[2:04:12] manifest in this evil age that we are
[2:04:15] living in see where it is heading out we
[2:04:18] are heading back to the west bend where
[2:04:20] it means what martini
[2:04:22] fest all that the prophet left the
[2:04:25] prophecies over you
[2:04:27] but you must get into the spirit
[2:04:30] of your promised prophecy there's gonna
[2:04:33] be a pride without spot or without
[2:04:35] wrinkle oh that is my pro that's my
[2:04:38] portion
[2:04:39] that's what i stand for that's what i
[2:04:41] believe that's where i am going
[2:04:44] glory
[2:04:46] oh you believe that
[2:04:48] hallelujah
[2:04:49] oh
[2:04:51] you must get into the spirit of your
[2:04:53] prophecy
[2:04:56] jacob and are close to jacob
[2:05:00] the scripture says jacob have i loved
[2:05:03] esau have i hated
[2:05:05] no matter how
[2:05:06] esau had revelation
[2:05:08] he was out of the picture
[2:05:11] no matter how a deceiver jacob was god
[2:05:14] loved it
[2:05:16] this to help young people
[2:05:18] that you think that you have gone too
[2:05:20] far you can't come back no god loves you
[2:05:24] jacob was a deceiver it's a planter
[2:05:28] but it was written
[2:05:30] by predestination
[2:05:32] jacob having loved
[2:05:34] esau have i hated
[2:05:37] jacob knew that
[2:05:41] so he fooled around
[2:05:44] but he knew he had to return home
[2:05:47] he couldn't stay in that state or in
[2:05:49] that condition
[2:05:55] so he needed a time with god
[2:05:58] he needed an experience with god
[2:06:02] and so do we need an experience with god
[2:06:06] because we are going back home
[2:06:08] we are heading back to our mate we are
[2:06:10] heading back to the groom
[2:06:14] we've got to change
[2:06:17] get back to the original world
[2:06:20] because he's able to transform
[2:06:23] jacob
[2:06:25] knew
[2:06:26] i can't go back
[2:06:27] with this deceiving attitude i can't go
[2:06:30] back with this trickster came alive
[2:06:33] i've got to wrestle with the angel
[2:06:36] he got into the spirit of his prophecy
[2:06:39] god loved him god predestinated him
[2:06:42] but jacob had to get back
[2:06:44] to the spirit
[2:06:46] of his promise
[2:06:48] the love of god had to find jacob to
[2:06:51] bring him down on his knees
[2:06:58] abraham said now
[2:07:00] so the new beth is very important
[2:07:04] jacob could not brag on his trickster
[2:07:06] nature he couldn't brag on his his
[2:07:09] subplantar nature he had to come back
[2:07:14] to have an experience with god
[2:07:17] in the bible when he had the experience
[2:07:19] with god his work changed
[2:07:22] ah
[2:07:23] jacob walked funny
[2:07:25] but he was restored
[2:07:26] back to the love that god loved him
[2:07:29] before he was even born in his mother's
[2:07:31] world
[2:07:32] praise god your work must change by the
[2:07:34] word
[2:07:38] the prophet said
[2:07:40] and i'm done
[2:07:41] praise god
[2:07:44] oh
[2:07:45] notice
[2:07:46] it was by his believers
[2:07:49] listen closely now as we close up
[2:07:52] it was by his believers that he proved
[2:07:55] his way by
[2:07:57] so this word is not just to lay there
[2:08:00] god has to prove the word by you
[2:08:07] it was by his believers that he proved
[2:08:09] his word by he can only prove his word
[2:08:12] not by unbelievers it is only by the
[2:08:15] believer that he can prove his word
[2:08:19] no matter how much the rest of them
[2:08:21] claim to be
[2:08:22] [Music]
[2:08:25] i am the holy ghost that's not my
[2:08:27] problem
[2:08:28] my problem lord fill me with the holy
[2:08:30] ghost
[2:08:38] it's only by the believers that he can
[2:08:41] prove his way
[2:08:42] no matter how much the rest of them
[2:08:44] claim to be oh i believe brother see if
[2:08:47] you do god will prove it so
[2:08:50] simple
[2:08:55] rather i want you to notice he does it
[2:08:58] the same way in every age
[2:09:00] he does it every time by the same method
[2:09:03] he has to take believers
[2:09:06] you want a manifestation of the word
[2:09:09] you've got to believe
[2:09:11] mind shall not live by bread alone but
[2:09:13] by every word
[2:09:16] and this side shall follow them that
[2:09:18] believe believe what the word
[2:09:22] and then in the other in order to have
[2:09:25] believers to meet that word he's got to
[2:09:27] predestinate it to that age
[2:09:30] so you are predestinated to this age to
[2:09:33] be the word bride
[2:09:36] in order for you to be a believer you
[2:09:38] see it now he's got to predestinate this
[2:09:41] thing to be there to meet the challenge
[2:09:44] of that age say did you get it now did
[2:09:47] you feel it now did you see it do you
[2:09:50] understand it that is what is happening
[2:09:52] today he predestinated it to this by his
[2:09:55] foreknowledge when he predestinated the
[2:09:58] malachi 4 is going to happen glory
[2:10:03] malachi 4 was
[2:10:04] predestinated is god to happen
[2:10:10] ephesians 4 11 is predestinated it's got
[2:10:13] to happen
[2:10:17] you see that
[2:10:18] when he predestinated malachi for it's
[2:10:21] going to happen when he come over and
[2:10:23] pray there's nothing anything to happen
[2:10:24] in his word he had to prove his way to
[2:10:27] be so
[2:10:30] when he predicted anything to happen
[2:10:33] and says it will happen he knows that
[2:10:36] seed will be there just at that time he
[2:10:39] predestinated a pride she is going to be
[2:10:42] there
[2:10:45] he predestinated the bride
[2:10:47] and we must get into the spirit of our
[2:10:51] prophecy
[2:10:53] he predestinated the pride she is going
[2:10:55] to be there
[2:10:57] she's going to be there going to be a
[2:10:59] rapture she's going to be there he
[2:11:01] predestinated by finally see there is
[2:11:04] nothing going to stop it
[2:11:06] nothing will stop your rapture nothing
[2:11:09] will stop your perfection nothing will
[2:11:11] stop you going away nothing will stop
[2:11:13] you overcome it nothing will ever stop
[2:11:16] will stop you praise god from becoming
[2:11:19] that virtuous bride of jesus christ
[2:11:25] so the prophet said
[2:11:27] truly predestinated believers stay with
[2:11:30] the world
[2:11:31] they won't pervert it they can't it
[2:11:34] can't be perverted oh sons and daughters
[2:11:37] of god why can we have this great
[2:11:39] fellowship that we ought to have with
[2:11:41] all those sons and daughters of god we
[2:11:44] should have it but they just won't do it
[2:11:46] that's all because they are not truly
[2:11:48] sons and daughters from there
[2:11:53] i guarantee now
[2:11:55] but truly predestinated believers will
[2:11:57] stay with the world
[2:12:00] oh
[2:12:02] verb then goes now and i'm done
[2:12:04] musicians play something is it
[2:12:06] transformed from the church
[2:12:08] you are going to be transformed
[2:12:13] because you are the word bride
[2:12:15] brother transformed from the church and
[2:12:18] the world into sons and daughters of god
[2:12:21] notice this in closing and now oh how
[2:12:25] the one reasons of god wandering out
[2:12:27] there in the world in some of this
[2:12:29] denomination from denomination
[2:12:30] denomination like one ring starts never
[2:12:33] stable like live on the water in the
[2:12:35] autumn we used to see leo back in the
[2:12:38] east there see the leaf would blow down
[2:12:41] on it and every little wind blew it from
[2:12:43] here this side to the other side but god
[2:12:46] wants us to be stabled
[2:12:49] anchored in jesus the stumps of life i
[2:12:52] will pray and god and jesus are fear no
[2:12:55] winner with see whatever it is many of
[2:12:58] you remember praise be the name of a
[2:13:00] living god god wants us to be uncle
