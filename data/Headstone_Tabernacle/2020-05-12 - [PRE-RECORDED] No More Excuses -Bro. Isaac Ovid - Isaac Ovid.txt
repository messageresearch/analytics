Luke chapter 14 reading from verse 16 st. Luke 14 and reading from verse 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and beat many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and a memed and the halt and the blind and the servant said Lord it is done as has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper can we bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we approach the throne of grace law and having read the holy scriptures father we know the Scriptures are anointed we know this message of Malachi for is anointed and lo we know that you are here right now to break every yoke to break every chain Lord I pray you bless the reading of the word may you walk out the pages of the Bible the dear father father we unite and feed father on the great expectation to hear a word from you this morning though we are not here to hear from man we are not here to Lord just to see each other but we come for an experience with a pillar of fire may you take complete control today over every life over every situation over every condition Lord it is anyone sick and um it's me you touch them is there a backsliding the house may restore them father we Lord tich Lord every spirit under our control this morning for the glory and honor for mighty God we welcome the angel of the Lord in the house this morning and lo we pray that you break every chain break every shackle law we bind the works of darkness this morning we buy in tiredness we bind fear we pain frustration me my lord the past we pine our mistakes we find yesterday father we bind every unclean spirit this morning father we make way for the Holy Ghost this morning following shake ourselves this morning from our lethargy we shake ourselves not to get into action Lord let me you walk out the pages of the Bible and Lord as you walked in Bethlehem and walked in Jerusalem I'm walking Bethany may you walk through this Tabernacle this morning may you go from person to person father and me to get a personal experience this morning with a pillar of that they'll never be the same again father love me you break away Lord Lord everything from us that does not belong me you perform spiritual surgery this morning Lord me the people know that no weapon formed against them could ever prosper me to catch a revelation this morning that they are born for such a time as this me to catch a revelation that sickness is nothing in the eyes of God made it catch a revelation that the conditions may be bad but it's gonna get better because there's power in the Church of the Living God over every sickness every disease there's no tiredness can stop us there's no sickness there's no doubt there's nothing shall separates us from the love of God um we come here this morning so give the glory to give a worshipful may you get the glory this morning may you get the honor this morning may you get the praise this morning Lord it didn't have to do it but you did we thank you that this morning you see a shooter brother we thank you for the blood this morning we thank you that there's power in the blood of we thank you that there's an anointing in the house this morning we thank you for the power of iron that's already here this morning we thank you Father God for what you've already turned what you're about to do may you bless the service this morning and we commit into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church sells and the church says amen and amen you may be seated this morning hallelujah hallelujah keep the prayer humming keep the worship humming you have to create the atmosphere that's what my job to create the atmosphere that responsibility is on you you have a chapter - God has a job to do and I have a job to do this morning and if we all do our jobs then something is gonna happen because God is a God of results he is the greatest performance manager that we have ever seen whatever he said that he's gonna do he is obligated to do it oh somebody say man and God is looking for somebody this morning who will do what he has written for them to do he is looking outside the book he knows the beginning he knows the middle he knows the ending and nothing will stop the purpose of God than sinning you this morning so I don't know about you but I came to make this place hot to smell them because we all have power to turn up the heat but obits have you come to turn up the heat this small M you want to turn up the temperature we want so much fire that there's no room for depression so much higher there's no more room for doubt so much higher there's no room for tiredness so much higher there's no room for a crisis it's so much higher there's the room for back pain I up there's no room for heart ache up high there's no room to be backslidden in this service the backsliders will be restored I'm not talking maybe I'm not talking perhaps but in this service the house of hell has got to give way to the name of Jesus yes power in the name there's healing in the name of chance deliverance in the name oh you don't hear me this morning maybe you're in the wrong place or maybe in the right place but but the Branham taught us up you cannot ever come to church and remain the same he said you either get better or you can't worse but I believe in my heart is small and there are some people in the house who want to get better there one to change they want on or they want a new top they want an experience they want to meet the pillar of fire they want to hear from God for themselves somebody give God worship hallelujah you may be seated I'm gonna warn you this morning hallelujah God adores worship he requires worship the very definition of God is object of worship some of you playing games in here this morning because under different circumstances and at different times of you respond differently but when you come to the house of God we come to give him our all give him our everything becomes a push as we have never pushed before your identity could be our day and God loves it 20 years you reached out to him he loves it when you cry and sad he loves the touch when you screams as your Lord I've been messed up a long time but not today today is my day I'm not going home unless I get a touch from the Lord if that is your prayer then God to do something for you if that is your desire then God to do something for you you may be seated with a brand I'm in the message mighty God unveiled he said I am identified look at the prophets identification away with the dead churches and the message they have nowhere to go but the Branham said I'm identified with a group that feels the Spirit of God if you ain't feeling the spirits of God but the random has nothing with you he said I'm identified with a group that feels the Spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows is unveiled up to know these unveil means that every mystery is revealed the mystery of who you are the mystery of who God is the mystery of where you come from the mystery of where you're going the mystery of why there's power inside of you right now that your sin cannot stop your situation cannot stop because that seed that's inside of you comes from God and it's going back to God can I get a witness and the house this morning though you may be seated he said he's the same yesterday today and forever and knows that this is not fanaticism these are not my words but returns I'm reading the Prophet with it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group they may be called a bunch of heretics fanatics on my account but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed of shouting I'm not ashamed to worship I'm not ashamed to testify I'm not I'll see this if thank you Jesus I'm not ashamed of the trials I'm not ashamed of the testing I'm a regime of the reproach I'm not a shame this morning because this gospel is the power of God unto salvation [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh yes it's all right to worship it's all yes all the way down in the back it's all right to worship I love the high in the front it's all right to worship I'm looking for this place to be consumed entire that you can't go home the same way you could testify he touched me he touched me oh he touched me this is upper room kind of environment maybe you weren't there the upper room I wasn't there but this is what it was like because Peter couldn't help himself oh my mama that's what we need Jim Killeen's I blew Holy Ghost revival but the Branham didn't come first to have books and tapes he came to see a church in killing high blue holy ghost fire within the church this cannot stand being dead cannot stay in the church its resurrection power it's the power to Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will make you act the same way it'll make you a ship it'll make you dance it'll make you shout it'll make you live a holy life up it'll make you love your brother it'll make you forgive her it'll make you a Christian is there anybody in the house who wants to be a Christian I wanna be a Christian in my heart I wanna be a Christian in my life I want to be a Christian every day not just on Sundays on Monday on Tuesday and Wednesday Thursday and Friday on Saturday I wanted in January in February and March in April not just a convention for everything with Jesus today before give me the old time religion give me the old town singing give me the old chance shouting give me the old time creature this is the condition for you to break out this is the condition lead to break free to break the chains of sin to break the chains of your pastor to pass somebody help me in the house is smaller you may be seated yes but eyes like a tortoise is the message search notice another message church this is not a message church this is not the denomination the message has become a denomination this is not a denomination when Jesus is in the building you have to recognize he is in the building when Jesus is in the house you have to acknowledge deity you have to acknowledge his majesty you have to roll out the red carpet because the King of Kings the Lord of lords the Rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star the terrace of ten thousand the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he's walking through the tabernacle where the palms are smaller this is Palm Sunday yes every Sunday should be bouncing it holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty [Applause] worship worship worship the devil hits when you worship God you may be seated you may be seated if you want to stay standing it's up to you you wanna run in the back it's up to you you wanna run to the front is up to you this is a different kind of service is smaller I haven't even given my title yet but this is a different kind of service this is a different team it's a different season there's a different team it's a different season somebody today is gonna go free somebody it's a deal it's gonna move from mental feet the spiritual feet you have heard the message by the hearing of the air but now it's a transformation could it be the dynamics to the mechanics [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] I'm an expectation to see a church that brother branham spoke about sure she said God will have a spotless church gonna have a super church those were the words that Malachi 4 used and I'm gonna use those same words a super Church he wants to see a super Church he's not defining it by this group and that group he's talking about the bride party an invincible army an unstoppable army what sin do you have this morning that could come in front of a super church what sickness do you have this morning nothing will stand up before a super church this than a Pentecostal church not a Methodist Church and a Baptist Church this is the house of God somebody say man he may be seated [Applause] so I have a title this morning my title is no more excuses cuts in and again no more excuses say it with me no more excuses one more time no more excuses one more time no more excuses I can't hear you no more excuses give the Lord a hand oh praise my subject recognizing who you are what you are called to do and that now is the time and my inspiration a manifestation of a super Church because that's our promise a manifestation of a super church now when you study the scripture and you read by the branham's message he said on the day of Pentecost they had a super church it was a powerful Church it was a Holy Ghost led church there was no sin in the church when Ananias came up to Peter he didn't realize at the pillar of fire had tabernacle itself on Peters hat and Peter was no longer in the driver's seat but the Holy Ghost was in the driver's seat so when he thought he was lying to pizza he was lied to the Holy Ghost and God killed him on the spot [Applause] in that super church Peter would walk and the light of the Sun would shine on Peter and Peter shadow people were being healing his shadow that's the attributes of a super church somebody helped me this morning Paul is preaching somebody falls dead he doesn't just call an emergency he prays challenge around keeps on preaching and that put us on fire you can't tell me that brother died in church God resurrected in church and sat there for the rest of the service good word City let me take notes about what I experienced no after he fell dead and he came back to life they couldn't stop him jumping I don't know if he heard another word that Paul said but he knew he was there he died and something came over me something took ahold of me something took control of me [Applause] you may be seated this morning I'm trying to go I'm all over the place this morning but I want to talk about no more excuses I don't if I'm gonna get to read it I don't know how we're gonna go this morning but brother branham said let me see my friend quickly my hallelujah glory glory hallelujah since I lay down glory glory down yes I'm feeling so much better since I laid my put in town yes I'm feeling so much better inside my bed and town this is the sovereign church we don't report to anybody we don't need permission to sing in the middle of the service we do what we want to do I'm gonna lead us about the Holy Ghost that's what you wanna sing you can sing shout jump dance that's the upper room in divinity world relationship that's a Holy Ghost and fire it's all over me this mornin it's all over you this morning and it's keeping us alive Jesus is keeping us alive he may be seated from the message is your life worthy of the gospel nah brother branham is time back to the scripture you and of that supper and I want you to understand the context a great man a certain man had a supper he sent out invitations the Bible said he did many he invited a lot of people you say come and eat you don't have to pay for anything I'm preparing everything you just have to show up and come [Applause] it's not on you it's on me it's not your job is my job just come he sent out invitations come don't worry about what you're wearing come because in those days when you invited the provider robe for you so don't worry about your clothes don't worry about the food there's no admission fee there's no cost to you just show up and come you may be seated [Applause] and when you're having a big feast or a big convention or a big festival or whatever it is there's a lot of preparation that goes into it there's a lot of rifice there's lots of time it's what the planning and this great man this certain man he took a lot of time because he wanted his guests to have the very best treatment he didn't want to just have chicken you were the chicken and fish and steak and pork and shrimp and caviar he wanted to make sure it was a delectable cuisine of the finest selection because he was catering for the best of the best he was catering for royalty he was catering for individuals who had been selected who had been chosen you may be seated you may be seated so he came out an announcement he got his right-hand man he said all things and already the pork is hot the chicken is ready for the vegetarians is rice and tofu whatever you need is already no call to the neighborhood go to everybody who has been invited and tell them to come tell them come to the Reviver tell them come and worship tell them come and dance come and shout come and pray [Applause] you may be seated and one by one they start to make excuses and there's something about this thing called excuses because it excuses when you pass on the responsibility for your action on to someone else or something else and they are good excuses there are bad excuses these excuses were not horrible excuses Nancy I bought a pistol and that's that's legitimate is nothing wrong with buying land there's no seasoning minor piece of property and I was a I bought five yoke of oxen and I have to go and try them see if they're running right see if they can handle wheat this was not them sale going to a party I went to a club I'm gonna hand watch a movie these were not the excuses that they had the last one is a noble one he said I got married God Almighty and I'm the man of my house so I can't come because I got a mix of my wife he's already be all that as it may at the end of the day God being a court of results and this being a parable he is interested in only one thing results he's not interested in your reason he's an interested in your excuse he's interested in what happened I what the story was he wants to know that you attended what he invited you for so a woman calls out to the silver who comes back depressed and explains it to the masses listen go to the highways of the byways because I have prepared too much for all of this food to go to ease there's too many books there's too many tips that's too much anointed there's too much violence too much inspiration this there's too much hidden under the Seventh Seal that I prepare for all this time for there to be nobody to enjoy this food he said go out to the highways go to the Pirates go and fight people who look like they're not gonna make it but they're gonna make it go and fight some people they might be messed up right now but tell them come tell them it's their time tell them it's their season telling us the hour tell them it'll matter their condition just come don't matter the mistakes come no matter their past come no matter where they were born come what job they have come where the will can come tall sword big small red white come come to church see man you maybe see that surfing came back is less than I went into that and yet his room I invited everybody in our circle but your dad's room he said quarterly hot go to the lame go to them who have read problems go to the hard cases those who people already give up on them and tell them they can never go to heaven go to them to my table will be full there will be a price revival there will be a manifestation of this message of Malachi 4 quad will raise up people who all the other against them but they couldn't make it they are gonna make it they are gonna overcome can the church say man I'm mother Branham said you may be seated I gotta find its way but but brother Brennan said it was excuses that they meet in the days of Luther because the standard was set but these are Luther they made excuses that's why they couldn't meet the simple and that's why the whole goes had to move on because they made excuses but the random even said excuses is denomination he said your Creed could become an excuse but I'm a deacon in this church that's why I can't go to that group and he said all of that is excuses [Applause] my weatherman said they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today but the Branum said in the message is your life worthy of the gospel he said if Israel 2000 years ago would have accepted the invitation they were given there wouldn't be as they are today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they've turned it down and went into judgment wondering about Jesus when did this man get his learning what school is he from is this not the carpenter's son can the church say Amen but the branding whether he said Jesus was trying to tell them that they excuses was what killed the prophets that's a prophets word and what killed her right just to come he said they accepted their Creed's that men had given them instead of taking a word of God and by doing so have made a Word of God of none effect how much a a man so as a people we have become very good at making excuses I've made too many mistakes I've never done this before I don't have the right tools I don't know how to use the tools that brother stumbled me she started it he made me do it the neighbor did it I was good on Sunday you know all David's service was powerful but by Monday it was Nicole and I wasn't gonna respond but then she tell me that ting that was it excuses I didn't have time I don't have time I have work commitments I don't speak with that brother I'm not qualified I don't have an education I don't have any experience my family doesn't support me I don't have any friends what are these all excuses because what I want to see this morning at the end of the day when all your excuses finish you're still gonna get the Holy Ghost you're still gonna be delivered you're still gonna get your breakthrough you're still gonna have a reviler [Applause] you maybe see them we have excuses for why we why we have three why we didn't read the scriptures we have excuses for why we didn't pay our tithes we have excuses for why we lit so I wouldn't shake this brother's hand we have legitimate excuses in our minds of why we cannot forgive but we're in church every Sunday but there's a reason why I just cannot let it go excuses but the water this morning is no more excuses can the church say man cannot oh but Moses a little bit God had reached a point his limit with what was happening with the children of Israel so he said I've I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down and God had to find the right man the right person the right individual maybe didn't feel good about themselves but that didn't matter because God has his own plan and God had to interrupt his interrupt this man's life called Moses just the same record has to interrupt us so many times but put different situation in front of us to catch our attention because we get so used to the hustle and the bustle and we have to recognize the devil's job and I said this on Tuesday night remember the chapel's job is to use your job to use your neighbor to use the weather to use your paycheck to use your bank account do you think I'm not working to do everything in his power to give you an excuse to not see who you really are and not realize the potential that God has for you [Applause] so God has to interrupt Moses his life and chops down and consumes drops honor and a tree and fire comes down and an attraction in the mountain and Moses sees it you say this is something because it's on fire but it's not burning and Moses comes up there and God begins to speak to Moses I've heard the cries of my people there are some people who need deliverance Moses I've been living so long in the message 40 years in the message that he had lost the burden and God is saying to Moses after the cries of my people you have family down there that need a liver you have sons and daughters and neighbors and relatives people you grew up with who need deliverance I gotta send somebody but you gotta go you have got to go you have got to do it you have got to forgive you have got to love you have got to drop yours you have got to pray I've come down but you got to go let me see it again I've come down but you got to go I came down with a message through a prophet but you got to go I'm not going you got to go I've already come down seven angels already came back from eternity but you got to go there's something that you got to do I've come down but you got to go you may be seated I went quite explained it all supposes what it goes into this is saying I can't talk I don't know how to use PowerPoint I don't know how to do presentations I never sell to anybody I never present to anybody I never tried I don't know how I'll tell them that they could be free I'm I've been feeling free how I could tell and I can't imagine cordis watch Moses talking I say come on keep it coming give me one tell me all the reasons why your cargo tell me all the problems you have why a cargo because when you finish tell me you're still going when you finish with all the excuses it will reach a point where there are no more excuses after you tell me it's your bills the mortgage too high you're struggling to pay rent it's a long time and coming to church you've been hauling on when he'd give me all the excuses and one more tell me today give the only reasons why you can't be happy give me all the reasons you can so tell me tell me tell me why you can't pray tell me give me all the reasons why you can't get the Holy Ghost give me all the reasons why you can't grow your hair out and dress like a lady of the Lord tell me all the reasons give me all the excuses because when it's over there be no more excuses bring them all today tell me why you can't be on fire tell me why you can smile and why you can chop yours bring on all the excuses because it's got to run out and when it runs out tell me no more excuses yes never go well you know him it is smile there's no excuse to be sad this morning there's no excuse to be dead this morning there's no excuse to be depressed this morning there's no excuse to hold on what are you telling me this morning you have no reason there's nothing you could tell me this morning to justify you being a half-wit Christian there's no excuse there is no excuse touch your neighbor and tell him no more excuses [Applause] louia turn to somebody else tell him no more excuses no more excuses tell somebody else no more excuses no more excuses we're gonna have a revival no more excuses we're gonna have a prayer life no more excuses we're gonna pray for children no more excuses we will accomplish it early no more excuses there's no reason there's no excuse there's no justification there's no explanation I don't want to report about why elite you're supposed to be at your poster duty I don't want to know why you're Miss Church I'm not no excuses turn up the heat turn up the heat a little bit it's none of the little heat a little bit I want you to finish all the excuses you may be seated I only know come to church that's no excuse I'm in it for a long time I tired that's no excuse you no longer have this back beam that's no excuse you know long as you snap back we know the shoulder pain it stupids that's no excuse when you finish listen Moses yeah talk slow to speech even if you're slow still say it I'm gonna make it you're still going no excuse I'm gonna have a revival what the speech but slow and steady wins the race no excuses say it speak it shouted scream it we're gonna have a revival [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you maybe see that that attitude changes everything about you because the next excuses are way out but I realized something you see when you get desperate when you get that sway there's no room vex uses enough doors for men who had a friend who with the quitter condition of palsy he was shaking and trembling he create was an involuntary country he lost control and he heard that Jesus was in the town having a whole house eaten when they heard that brother Mikey they say we gotta get our friend to Jesus [Applause] didn't make his condition an excuse they found a way to put him on the bed they were walking on the road like this because he was shaken that wasn't the excuse your car could have three tires that's no excuse doesn't matter what the situation is there is no excuse for you getting what you came to get this morning you may be seated and brother Gerald when they got to the hosts meeting God loves to create situations to test if you're gonna make an excuse if you can have a reason for why and I praying why not sighing why in a desperate I mean they cut the other houses full convention overflowing there's no room those guys had a legitimate excuse we cannot get to Jesus but those brothers because of desperation they took the approach no excuses we got to get this man to Jesus they analyzed the situation I don't know you maybe see that if there was an engineer in the group you may be seen analyze the building he said well if we go up to the side and go to the top and we dig a hole with this circumference I don't know how they did it however they did it they found a way they didn't make an excuse they were probably shaking on the way of the house that didn't matter to them they were determined to get to Jesus you maybe see them when you take the approach as a Christian no excuses nothing will stop you you may be seated and that's why I realize a lot of people don't have fit I've said to the young people I said listen if the job that you are in is taking you away from God you are in the wrong job don't tell me you need this job to pay the bills if it's taking you away from God because if you make the decision to follow God he's gonna give you the right job [Applause] no more excuses you maybe see it so don't tell me because of your job is why it's good have to be on the edge right millimeters is this shift a little bit no more excuses I have to quote there may get it or not but the banner said that's why he preaches as hard as he can because of the Day of Judgment Corps don't want to hear your excuse [Applause] this is not man standard God accepts no excuses it's the life or nothing so you have to understand and that's why sent some to a couple months ago prove God [Music] prove God that's what the will need to see the unfeeling reality for the random breach of the Living God is either he's your vagina or he's not Jehovah Jireh but if he is your provider he is obligated to provide for you put them to the test no excuses no more excuses give me liberty or give me death I want to be a real Christian or no Christian at all no more excuses [Applause] God will force the issue in your life to bring his plan into accomplishment look at Gideon Gideon oh mighty man of Valor excuse number one i'm from the smallest tribe is that this is a triumvirate of excuses and from the smallest tribe and if you analyze you whole tribe my family is you smallest family in this small astray but not I want to go deeper than that smallest tribe smallest family and I'm the smallest one in my family so when you top of this Gideon Mike you might not follow this is somebody else gotta be talking about me and go they say you are the one going when your excuses finally run out and they have no more excuses you still go can the church say man I hope this sings down inside of your heart I'm tired of people telling me they don't have time to pray and and you have an excuse for that you don't have time to read the Bible it is is there an excuse for that you come to church when you want to is there an excuse for that where are you going when you don't put God what message do you believe when you have a excuse adjust if you get a reason for why I can't forgive husbands in the house there's no excuse husband love your eyes wives reverence your husband there's no excuse there's no there's no a B C or D pick one how much no more excuses give me liberty or give me dead it's good to shout and jump but there people in the house with what kind of stuff on the inside that only you know and guard know is there and that's what you wouldn't deal with this morning it's easy to talk about now it's your brother a sister somebody did you but there's some stuff that some of us carry on the inside and we don't want nobody to talk about we don't want nobody to address we want to mine it and grow it up until it becomes so big it takes you over completely many times we talk about the enemy on the outside and it's dissonance that's and it's dishonest that and it's dissing instead but what do you do when the enemy is on the inside it's easy on the outside do the whole show you know God bless you God with a Raymond Thompson I believe it was so beautifully at the convention center brandon rooze our love to go to the hills to the mountains because he got tired of shaking brothers hands who saying god bless you and he's seeing that there was no love him in their hearts so i'm going beyond visual this morning i'm going beyond the external this morning and i say there's no excuse for that MV there's no excuses for the jealousy in your heart there's no excuse for the animosity there's no excuse young brother young sister for how you disrespect your parents even if you don't see it but it's on the inside you wanna dig that up this morning you are who you are when you are alone by yourself that's a review all of mankind has the ability to act Trinidadians are uniquely gifted in that area we are very good actors put on a great show Sunday Thursday Tuesday Youth Service me them on the street able to switch quickly from work for macula to God bless you you read that book no more excuses the Bible said in this commune read that great man got angry at the excuses and understand this as I said earlier they were relatively legitimate you can tell a man to buy his land and dual- property and take care of his wife those are responsibilities but God is digging deeper to see you after prayers arise this specific invitation to the wedding supper this invitation to the Holy Ghost this invitation to the rapture let's the cares of this life shock you and while you may have good motives and good objectives and try to do the right thing and do be nice to people and read and pray and all the nice mannerisms you still miss the fundamental aspect of its the thunder the life that shakes the devil and if the talk of the Holy Ghost itself is what God is looking for when the purpose is put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city we have become so insensitive to the abomination in the city now we accept it when the abomination should make us feel a certain way enough to make you sigh and cry when said you say no God have mercy you just see things and let's let it go without catching a burden for it what is your excuse this morning for not saying for not crying what is your Excuse this morning for not building a prayer altar in your house your wife cannot be your Excuse your husband cannot be your issues having no money cannot be your excuse not being able to pay the rent is not an excuse not having a house is not an excuse not having a husband or wife or a boyfriend or that's not an excuse you see when you really look now at the excuses from a deeper level you see it's it's real a decision is being made you know those that were invited made a choice not to go so the excuse is really an explanation of why you didn't do it so the question is warning is what is more important than this put another way what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul so God so loved the world he sacrificed everything he gave His only begotten Son that we could have this access this morning there is nothing to gain without sacrifice there is no reward without sacrifice you won't success in your school you have to sacrifice how do you measure that sacrifice you study you go to your class you read you review that's the process that's the sacrifice sometimes you want to go and play sometimes you want to go out but you make a sacrifice because you have an exam coming up and because you want results and you won the reward you have to make a choice to sacrifice certain things because you want the reward you want to buy a house you want to buy a car you want to buy something of value you can't spend the same way you did really didn't want those things all of a sudden you decide to have a budget because your CV there's something there will be peace when you want to eat a KFC you want a trapeze which is set up in our snack pack to peace because there's a sacrifice it's also good for your health too because you want a reward but there's a misconception with the kingdom of God that people want to come to church and then they looked at a pastor pray for me they come to church and they expect things to happen that because they came to church they are now on this register that no opens up the daughter unlimited blessings unlimited favor without sacrifice and that does not exist you have to sacrifice the Bible says we bring a sacrifice of praise praise itself is a sacrifice some of you in here and we even want to praise and that's that's that's that's a sacrifice that you cannot yet that you must be able to do because a sacrifice of praise is when you don't feel like prison he is still worthy of the praise so you sacrifice your feeling you sacrifice what's happening in your life and it's a sacrifice of praise because you are knowledge and that he deserves the praise whether you have money or no money whether you're sick or not sick whether you're having a good day or party you need a choice of sacrifice and to give God praise and worship because He is God and there's none like him there's none higher than him there's none greater than him there's no God like Jehovah and it's a sacrifice of praise because when the praises go up the glory of God must come down [Applause] you maybe see them so having a random 12 of those all-night peer meetings and that's why we're balanced said you could sing too much you could preach too much you could dance too much but you could never pray never pray too much I need to bring back the church to that level of sign and crying a church that is not sighing and crying is dying because they're shouting and jumping on the outside doesn't deal with the issues on the inside there's a surgery that needs to take place you can't go to a hospital surgery and do what you want before the doctor sell it before you come in for the surgery don't eat for 24 hours they certain things you have to do in preparation for the surgery that's just the way it is just what all the people sanctify yourself because in a few days we are going over you can do what you want no more excuses I pray that the light this morning would shine upon the Seas in your soul and you could recognize what turn away living it the woman with the issue of blood she had been in that condition for some time she spent her money she got results the doctor saw what was going on she spent more money and the condition wasn't getting better she could have blamed the doctor she could have blamed the medication she could have blamed stress she could have done whatever she wanted but when she heard Jesus was in town she had no excuse nobody was gonna stop up because she didn't want that opportunity to pass her by so she began a press so e to Jesus and her on Jesus was there are so many people she didn't make that an excuse she didn't make a crowd and excuse she didn't make what other people doing an excuse and that's why when God speaks to your heart you have to respond to God you know responding to me you spoil it to his word just something shrimps inside of your heart and you want to jump that's on you it doesn't matter if anybody else jumping anybody else shouted it's you and God give us more individuals who will be so focused and the promise of God that it would have no excuses thank you Jesus but the Branham said hear their excuses as their Creed's and denominations you see your belief could be an excuse I mean but about as long as the denomination your excuses try to shadow that seed that you know actually lays there you are taking the part of lot he said throw them things away and let the gospel light shining upon their the power of Jesus Christ keeping the light off of it will keep it from living because if the light ever gets to it it'll spring forth to life but it matters it that's the reason that people see it don't go to some of them kind of meeting they're afraid some of the light will strike one of their members but the man said remember the woman at the well she was a prostitute she stood there they stood the priest they have seen Jesus turn Nataniel I saw you when you were under the fig tree in order and this is a woman when she walked up there in immoral state at the well living with six men and when she walked up in that state jesus said bring me a drink the conversation started go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any you said the truth - you've got five on the one you live with not your husband she said I perceive that your prophet and that goes on belly-band said that settled when the light flashed across the seed laying in that little old harlot the holidays was over into the streets she went more if I am God she didn't make her pass an excuse she don't worry what anybody else said about her she said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah what was it the light got to that seed back under the shadow of that prostitute shelter so Cortana wait for the light to get to that see God Himself you let me see it you have to understand God Himself lives by that no it's useless you know so it's not something just for you I'm gone don't live by those rules when it was time for court to do deliverance the Bible said he was so tired he said take me to the other side and he went to sleep on the boat and it was on the way to the other side that the devil come and bring him the storm they they they can I say let's go back to the shore on the other and go back to where we came from but God had a destination because I was a man on the other side who needed deliverance and these storm was not going to be an excuse Jesus tiredness was not going to be an excuse the Bible said he maybe see that Gina was so tired the word carried they use in the original language meant physically the lift so they physically lifted Jesus into the boat but you were so focused and delivering that one man the same he didn't let inspire this B's excuse the storm was an excuse and when he got to the other side there's a man screaming out for help with demons on him with name Legion and the Emotiv demons he had was also no excuse because when Jesus came to deliver there's no excuse he come to deliver and when Corps come to set you free the odds to be against you but there's no excuse you're gonna be deliver can the church same [Applause] she may be seated could he take some more on a drive his home this morning but the balancer let's compare something he said let's let s let us make a comparison let's compete a life of seeing Paul Paul the Apostle to the rich young ruler listen carefully to the Prophet he said the same light struck both men both had the same invitation from Jesus Christ the port was well trained in the scriptures they were poor theologians remember Jesus other young rich ruler keep the commandments he said what I've done these things from my youth he was a trained man so as Paul both were well trained in Scripture Paul we supposed to come early and he was to estrange Scripture but a well trained both of them had the word listen carefully one handed from knowledge the other had it from the gym of life in it so when the light flashed across in front of Paul he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus Here I am and he was ready the light struck both men one was Germanized and the other was not that's the way it is church spiritual and chillerz natural that's why brother Branham talks said in every church there are three kinds of believers so you can't get upset when we preach as hard as we can to liberate and people can meet the mark because in every church there are three kinds of believers is anybody with me this is the Prophet the rich man had his excuse he couldn't do it he was too weighed down with too many friends of the world remember Jesus discerned he said I kept his cell all you have gifted upon follow me and he couldn't do it and by the bath he couldn't do it because he had an excuse and after I said everything you cannot do there will be an excuse there's a reason for it so this man walked away sorrowful Jesus loved him but he had so many excuses he couldn't do it but the Bannock said notice the rich man had his excuses listen carefully he never forsake his testimony this is powerful he's in church living me but we find out that he went to great business he had knowledge he went to such a place till he had so much increase till he had to build new bands to put things in and when he died on some bachelor priest with his cover turn around preach his funeral no doubt and when he did he said they might have put the flags at half-mast mr. brand and said our dear beloved brother mayor of this city now he is in the arms of Almighty because he was such a great member of the church he did so and so and so and the Bible says the prophets in hand he lifted up his eyes being in torment and remember he still wanted to hold his profession in hell he seen Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham and he said father Abraham and where the brand took that he said still calling him father so what he knew or what he lived was so ingrained in him he had intellectually but I said he took his knowledge and winter and intellectual Church I went the light struck him he didn't get down but the brother said if that isn't a modern trend of the church today no matter what God flashes across their path the pillar of fire or whatever else it might be they're still with their knowledge they can explain it away and go to the intellectual group for some social standing listen to the Prophet if this doesn't apply to this day hallelujah but listen to the Prophet but Paul was already in the social standing with great knowledge a great scholar under Gamaliel a right hand to the high priests in so much till he went to the priests and that orders to put all them holy rollers in jail but when the light struck his path and he seemed that the same power of fire that led Israel to the wilderness was Jesus Christ he forsook all that he knowed and he came to the life and church say Amen [Applause] hallelujah glory glory glory my no more excuses from the message of wedding supper I just want to touch a description a little bit but about said as soon as the invitation was mean and giving out any excuses was made oh yes one married a wife or the other brought some oxen you know the story but that's the way it is today God made the supper ready send the preacher to preach defeat what happened oh I can't go because I'm a deacon in another church I just couldn't do that well I couldn't go because it would lower my prestige the Prophet said your prestige oh I couldn't go because I don't believe them all holy rollers that's acting like that I'm gonna live my life the excuses was made oh it's two street I don't want to do that excuse me say well I'm so tired when I come in at night I can go to church that's excuses today oh I'm afraid my husband wouldn't like it I'm afraid my wife would kick me out of the house she ought to if that's the kind of man you are that's right there you are excuses made many of them we could name excuses and when I said that was done from Luther on down to Wesley's age all kinds of excuses oh well because other things to do but then when the silver come back and said I done all this and they cut all excuses he said watch what he said to the preacher now he said supper is already fixed it's already past time in other words time is already gone there's no more time left to say run quickly I'm closing the highways go to the byways go knock on the doors go wake up the people tell them time is at hand hallelujah and brother branham said people are crying oh what's the matter with you preacher he said that's the light of the Bible go get the lame and the halt and an invitation church is going out this morning but I ran him in the message a blushing prophet he said it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian times are going to change the all's gonna become young oh my dad's gonna freak away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more parameters for the loss but God shall come and take the elect away from the four winds of the earth and shall gather them under his wings and we live and reign with him forever in his heaven oh brother sister friend of mine if you are not prepared tonight me you'll be prepared at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you wouldn't know that you're not where you should be with God these are the prophets would I invite you to the altar with myself and invite every one of you here to come here and not only see but to stay here until God has cleanse your soul from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster on but go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and new hope go out with the baptism of the Holy Spirit go out not shouting not dancing not so much damned things are alright they all belong in the church they all belong in the Bible what I'm talking about is the Holy Spirit God's love can the church say man [Applause] but the Branham goes on in the wedding supper speaking about the robe he said how would it be if you get invited to this wedding supper and there's somebody sitting out at a fancy suit on this table and somebody with rags on this table and this one wearing what they want so he said it was the custom and the tradition and when you come to the house you are given a robe so that every single person who comes into the supper is looking the same way I mean the banham said that robe is nothing but the baptism of the Holy Ghost because when you come in the right way you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's very difficult to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have it or if you've never experienced it you have to find a way to build a bridge above it who tried to dig on it but we want to go through weather kindly until every last one is sealed into the kingdom can the church say Amen to the invitation that out tonight friends and the call is out to see who would respond to the call and the angel of the Lord is here and he's handing out rose he's handing out the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is the one to give the experience not the preacher but he is the one but the man said that robe is a type that of Elijah and Elijah of Christ and His Church now when that mantle was dropped down the church was supposed to wrap itself under that canopy put on the whole armor of God but on the baptism of the Holy not just on the freshmen on the inner man so it'll be in the control tower and it's something that when every man has been invited by the pelham said you can go by the door of the church if you go by the door of the church you'll get mixed up in theology he said I am the door to the ship food he said it must be that you go through Christ but the man said he honest wonder how Jesus could be the door to the sheep fall and he brought out that the Shepherd would leave as the door now when the sheep come in he would lay across the entrance as the door so that if a wolf or anything try to get in you have to go through him and he is singing that you have to go to Christ it's not the church you go to it's not to your pastor is you must go through Christ you must go through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must add the life it must be a living faith must be a living the virtue must be a living knowledge must be temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity there's no other way can the church say Amen there they will when this robe come on but the balance said I don't mean some big robe that's some company made out here that's on the outside for man to be seen but the road that Christ gives you he said you will be said the Holy Ghost that was in Christ comes into the believer that's got the invitation to the supper how many bad I said when that rope comes in there there's a little hidden power that comes down in your heart that all the devil in hell can't make you doubt it that hidden power not with a great big something across your forehead and a Doctor of Divinity it's an inside hidden power it's been caught program since the first lamb was slain in the Garden of Eden Samson had he had a hidden power what was it a touch of the Holy Ghost and by the Broncos in the talk was Sandi's head Samson had shoulders he's anything down shoulders like a make a plan and oh he said Samson was a little bitty mama's boy a little curly-headed shrimp he said that's what fool the people he was just an ordinary boy and had seven little curls hanging down his back looking like a little that's right everybody would laugh at him a type of the Holy Ghost Church and he was a weakling but when the hour come and God wanted to use him he was a giant brother God wants a church that he can lay his hand on I don't care how little it is to watch recut it in my name I'll be in their midst not just speak it then you see when we got in his name kind of church amen oh you made me see that he said I could see Samson he was on his Road to see his girlfriend little boy his little mummy fix his little curls up for the red moms and he was going to see his little girlfriend and a great big lion run out and roll at him he was helpless and the Bible said of the Spirit of God came on him and he grabbed that lion like was a little goat and toy into what a man he was when the Spirit of God come on him he had a hidden power that had been given him well that seems part of God is the Holy Ghost it's a hidden power yes and he's food a lion as if it would have been a kid how powerful he was cuz he had a hidden power [Applause] ma can the church say man it's a power of the Holy Ghost that's broken by divine grace let me say that again it's the power of the Holy Ghost that's brought in by divine grace by God our Father that fill the individual with his presence you shall receive life eternal life so we God's own life dwelling in you oh what a hidden power can the church see man oh my somebody say man but the Branham calls on Daniel had it when the Lions run at him the hidden power sword itself and the Lions got scared Daniel had some hidden power the Hebrew children had some hidden power when the fires hazard to burn them it was hotter than the fire was the hidden power was hotter than the fire in a fiery furnace my my my pizza had it after Pentecost and when he went to the kid called beautiful dearly the man crippled his mother's womb said silver and gold have I none but I got some hidden power I will give you if you believe it and he picked him up by the hand and said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and you know what he projected hidden power and when that man's ankle bones got strong he leaped in the air like a heart and began to jump and praise God you know what it's all about it's a hidden power but the branch said that's the robe that was handed out how the King this morning once I hand out more robes he wants to hand out some more robes this morning Oh God today but the battle said sinem friend you lukewarm Church remember God is long-suffering he said it's the last call come right in now God is looking to handle some robes for some vessels who have been invited it's a robe of power a robe of hidden power you may be seated will you come in and get the robe or will you make another excuse will you make another excuse I see no this morning we are coming running in this morning we are running into the Ark of safety we are running into the wedding supper can the church say Amen [Applause] hallelujah where the random goes only said when they all come in and had their robes on come by the door the Lord Jesus you say it's not the way you come in yes sir it's exactly right Peter introduced away on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost was forming all them theologians making fun and seeing well how look at all these bunch of fanatics all looking like drunk people of a brother I want to look like drunk people because I wonder see him think that Peter had I want to see him power that James had I wouldn't see him power that they had I'm accepting my invitation is there anybody this morning that's accepting their invitation I'm not going to be too much longer with you you may be seated and friends a lot of people know the message a lot of people read the books but there's nothing like you having an experience with God and receiving the Holy Ghost if the brand said is a theme of every apostle have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe Gauri's acts 19 but about a picture message what the Holy Ghost was given before he said the Holy Ghost comes to give you power he said I got some more scriptures here just separate the Holy Ghost come to give you power power in prayer he said he take a person that lives a good life but it always defeated oh I tell you it's a good person oh I sure love the Lord by the random but they always defeated didn't never gets a prayer answer you fill that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch might take place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes poorly to the Troon of God believing she has all right because she's a daughter of God might put porn I can't eat a little man so cowardly the boss pick him all over the place wait a minute here now something's changed see he's got to Holy Ghost and if you don't have the hood it goes in here this morning you ought to be desperate Lord deliver the Holy Ghost I this kind of blessing I want this kind of power I want this kind of experience [Applause] hallelujah you maybe see that all my was talking about prayer power of speech power for a holy life even that's what the Holy Ghost is to do some of you people walking along saying well I just can't quit drinking I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these cans get away from you that's right meek woman stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks and listen to the Prophet no excuses make them quit tackling oh yes that one is for to make you a holy life it'll follow the instruction of the Bible every time listen to the Prophet woman say it's just too hot I just have to wear these gives me a headache if I let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost let me say that one more time there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost so when it comes to the Word of God if you find yourself making excuses about what God's Word is you need an experienced winter Holy Ghost because there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost makes you for the word every single time because the Holy Ghost cannot contradict the word the Holy Ghost has to be identified with the word so if you find yourself making excuses this morning you need to hit the all times your Lord I need a touch from the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost I need to be filled I need to be refilled I need to be transformed I need an individual experience hallelujah it's there to make it so the Holy Ghost will follow the world just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do it's make you make you man til in your head from them half-naked woman and quit lusting after them yeah church members that what's it's supposed to do it's to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot it'll take that out of you that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life it makes you quit gossiping makes you quit playing cards shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what it'll do it'll quit making you want to marry somebody else's wife these are the prophets words now it's a Mick you live a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is powerful to set your affections on the things above where God stands the mind of Christ in you hallelujah he said you can't help them see those things but when you look at them you turn your head what does that is to holiness you say I can't do it oh I just can't sure you can't but the Holy Spirit comes for that purpose that's what the Holy Ghost is for not by your strength not by your might but by the Spirit of the Lord and that's the prophecy that's hanging over you this morning you shall be filled you shall be change you shall be adopted [Applause] you may be seated I'm almost finished this gospel it's not in word only but it's in power and demonstration God want to see somebody live this thing yes they are sick but that's no excuse Eric you're bad the situation is we're gonna still pray for them until there's coming a time but their parents said we wouldn't even have to lay hands on the sick who commanded Devils to come out of them that's what I'm looking for no excuses I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what the neighbor says I don't care what your pastor says I care about what the word says because God's wood I'm not healed his wood must come to pass no more excuses no more excuses no more excuses Oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated so you want to live a holy life get the Holy Ghost you wanna have a holy war get the Holy Ghost listen it's not your mind deciding to be nice I'm talking about the Holy Ghost God's own life lifting himself through you it's not your effort it's not reading read out calm down or I prefer the Holy Ghost living holy ghost living faith living virtue living knowledge living temperance living patients living colonist living parley kindness I'm talking with the Holy Ghost God's own life tabernacling himself in you that you could forgive and maybe your nature as we want to forgive but you have a new nature you have a new walk you have a new life go take your heart and he took your heart out he gives you a new heart you get a new spirit up he puts his spirit inside of there can the church say man you may be seated our book cannot give you that deep can I give you that you have to get an experience one time I've got a picture I've been with the brand again the story of somebody who wanted to get the Holy Ghost and it went to this island man and said listen how do I get the Holy Ghost and he took the money say come you want to get the Holy Ghost you got a comment to come now might a pic style some like that you say got a meal right here and then got a whole lotta guys there right yeah yeah if you want to get the Holy Ghost you got to come right here you got to really want it you got to know that you can't live
