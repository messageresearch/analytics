[29:49] I will stand up on my watch and set me
[29:52] upon the tower
[29:53] I will watch to see see what he will see
[29:57] unto me
[29:59] and and
[30:01] answer when I am reproved and the Lord
[30:05] answered and said right to vision and
[30:08] make it plain upon tables that he may
[30:12] run that readeth it for the vision is
[30:15] yet for an appointed time but at the end
[30:17] it shall speak and not lie do it tarry
[30:20] wait for it because it will not it will
[30:22] surely come it will not Tarry
[30:25] reading from Revelation chapter 10.
[30:28] when I read from verse 8.
[30:45] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[30:47] speaking to me again said go and take
[30:50] the little book which is open the hand
[30:51] of the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[30:53] and upon the Earth and I went unto the
[30:55] angel and said unto him give me the
[30:57] little book he said unto me take it eat
[30:59] it up it shall make thy belly bitter but
[31:02] it shall be thy mouth sweet as honey and
[31:04] I took the little book out of the
[31:06] Angel's hand and eat it up and it was in
[31:08] my mouth sweetest honey soon as I'd
[31:11] eaten it my belly was bitter he said
[31:13] unto me don't must prophesy again before
[31:16] many peoples and Nations and tongues and
[31:21] Kings Revelation chapter 22 reading from
[31:23] verse 7.
[31:31] behold I come quickly blessed is he that
[31:33] keepeth the sins of the prophecy of this
[31:36] book and I John saw these things and
[31:39] heard them or when I had heard and seen
[31:41] I fell down to worship before the feet
[31:44] of the Angel which showed me these
[31:45] things
[31:46] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[31:49] for I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[31:52] Brethren the prophet son of them which
[31:53] keep the Saints of this book worship God
[31:56] he said unto me seal not the sayings of
[31:59] the prophecy of this book for the time
[32:01] is at hand he doesn't just let him be
[32:04] unjust still he was just filthy let him
[32:06] be filthy still he that is righteous let
[32:08] him be righteous still he that is Holy
[32:10] let them be holy still and behold I come
[32:12] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[32:15] every man according and his work shall
[32:17] be as bar heads almighty God we thank
[32:19] you for your word and I pray dear God as
[32:23] you take me out of the way speak to our
[32:24] hearts may your life be transformed by
[32:27] this word this morning may be upon us
[32:30] like a vision Lord an inspiration
[32:32] granted father in Jesus and we ask it
[32:34] amen and amen you may be seated
[32:42] thank you
[32:43] this morning I have a title the
[32:46] unsealing of division and prophecy
[32:50] the unsealing of the vision and prophecy
[32:52] I have a taught inspiration making
[32:56] division plain
[33:00] something we shared last Sunday I want
[33:03] to connect back to it God's behavior is
[33:06] his person
[33:08] what he is in his behavior declares his
[33:13] person
[33:13] and that's what you are in your behavior
[33:17] tells you what you are
[33:19] not what you say so much but not what
[33:22] you intend to be but what you are isn't
[33:25] that right so if God acted one time in a
[33:29] certain circumstance and that
[33:30] circumstance arise he has to act the
[33:32] same way
[33:33] because he's the same yesterday today
[33:35] and forever if God healed in a certain
[33:38] condition in time past he has to heal
[33:39] today because he's the same yesterday
[33:42] today and forever you believe that oh
[33:45] blessed be the name of the Lord Praise
[33:48] this wonderful name Hallelujah
[33:51] so therefore from a prophet like Moses
[33:54] he said now first uh Apostles and
[33:58] Prophets teachers evangelists and
[34:00] pastors five spiritual offices in the
[34:03] church to set the church in order
[34:06] Apostles prophets teachers pastors then
[34:09] the local Congregation of nine spiritual
[34:11] gifts but these offices and places is
[34:14] the offices you hear from the Apostle
[34:16] his ministry you hear from the prophet
[34:18] his ministry from the Evangelist from
[34:20] the teacher from the pastor each has a
[34:23] separate Ministry and their Ministries
[34:25] is of God and God has set them in the
[34:28] church for a purpose
[34:30] so the Ministries that God sets in the
[34:32] church is for a purpose now notice what
[34:35] I'm saying what God says not what man
[34:38] put himself in but what God says and
[34:42] what God says he says and he will
[34:44] vindicate what he says isn't that right
[34:46] now what was the Holy Ghost given for
[34:49] hear what is to give unction to the
[34:51] preacher it's to give Holiness to the
[34:53] group it's to set the church in order
[34:56] so in other words it's not man to set
[34:59] the church in order it's the Holy Spirit
[35:01] that's why the Holy Spirit was given to
[35:03] set the church in order give unction to
[35:06] the preacher give Holiness to the group
[35:08] it is to unite us together with power it
[35:11] is to unite us together with broadly
[35:12] love what's the Holy Ghost given Fork to
[35:15] unite us man can't unite us the Holy
[35:17] Ghost was given to unite us isn't that
[35:19] right and watch it's United together
[35:22] with broadly love I don't care if your
[35:24] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic
[35:27] in all in a rain outer rain no rain it
[35:30] doesn't matter you are united by broadly
[35:32] Love by the spirit of forgiveness I love
[35:34] you praise God you love me I forgive you
[35:37] you forgive me we forgive one another
[35:38] and the honey sticks
[35:42] glory to God we will always do something
[35:44] in the flesh to offend somebody upset
[35:47] somebody trap somebody whatever it is
[35:49] but because I could repent and say
[35:51] forgive me my brother you could
[35:52] repentance and forgive me my sister and
[35:54] whatever it is we can forgive one
[35:55] another and we can be free it's not
[35:58] right that is what the Holy Ghost was
[36:00] given for because all have sinned and
[36:03] come short of the glory of God there is
[36:06] none righteous no not one so you can't
[36:09] have anything to boast about you always
[36:11] have something that you could confess
[36:13] and repent about could we give the Lord
[36:15] some Praises this morning
[36:16] oh we in church this morning Hallelujah
[36:19] Glory so whatever you are we have all
[36:22] been by one Holy Spirit baptized into
[36:25] one body and become members of the body
[36:27] of Jesus Christ this glorious thing to
[36:29] become a member of the body of Jesus
[36:30] Christ once in that body nobody can pull
[36:32] you out you're in his body you are part
[36:34] of him oh glory to God he can't move
[36:36] without you oh Glory wherever he moved
[36:38] you're moving also you are in him you
[36:41] are part of him isn't that right could
[36:43] you get tangled off of that this morning
[36:46] oh are you ready for the word this
[36:48] morning
[36:49] now notice when Judas fell
[36:52] the apostles
[36:54] hand-picked by Jesus
[36:57] chose Matthias
[36:59] to replace Judas
[37:01] but the pillar of Fire
[37:03] choose Paul who was not even amongst
[37:06] their group one was man's chosen the
[37:10] other was God's chosen by Pillar of Fire
[37:13] and God has promised to take the church
[37:16] or return the church to her Homeland
[37:19] which is back to Pentecost the Holy
[37:22] Spirit was sent to take the people back
[37:26] to the word and the angel is on the
[37:28] earth to do just that
[37:30] to take the people back to the world
[37:32] because God could only vindicate the
[37:34] word the Angels manifestation which is
[37:38] the holy spirit coming into the church
[37:41] to the voice of the Archangel to make
[37:44] the prophetic Vision plain
[37:46] so parabhanam said it this way and warm
[37:48] against organized this organized
[37:50] religion he said the church rejected
[37:52] Christ the only church age we have
[37:55] Christ on the outside knocking trying to
[37:56] get in and this Angel's message
[37:59] messenger from God was echo in his
[38:02] message on the earth to come out of
[38:04] Babylon the Holy Spirit today here we go
[38:07] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit the
[38:10] Holy Spirit come in all kind of
[38:12] manifestation but he's speaking about a
[38:14] specific move
[38:15] the manifestation of the holy spirit is
[38:19] that angel trying to get the people back
[38:23] to the word
[38:25] not back to church
[38:28] back to the word Millions going to
[38:31] church this Sunday morning but that's
[38:33] not what we are talking about we are
[38:35] talking about where you want to line up
[38:38] with the word
[38:41] oh Hallelujah
[38:44] cause the reason why the holy spirit
[38:47] will only vindicate the word it can't
[38:51] vindicate dogmas there is no life in
[38:53] them this is what we're standing for and
[38:56] that is what we believe but what did the
[38:58] word say
[38:59] Hallelujah because God going to confirm
[39:01] his word so if you have your his word in
[39:04] you he will confirm you because we give
[39:06] the Lord and Shout
[39:07] so he said the church the real believer
[39:10] he's back up a little bit he said no
[39:12] some great dealership might come to the
[39:14] city that maybe had a lot of Education
[39:15] could speak their words real good and
[39:17] plain and perhaps every Church in the
[39:19] city would fully cooperate it would be a
[39:21] kind of honor to God in here and a man
[39:23] which might be a marvelous speaker but
[39:25] that's not what the church is looking
[39:28] for
[39:29] the church is not looking for marvelous
[39:31] speakers he said the church the real
[39:33] believer here we go it's looking for the
[39:36] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[39:37] something moving in their heart
[39:40] Oh Glory to God not your head your heart
[39:43] isn't that right back to the word
[39:46] back to the principles that was laid
[39:48] down in the alpha Church notice the
[39:51] purpose of God sending Malachi for our
[39:54] Elijah I turn this and he Prophet is to
[39:56] turn our hearts back
[39:58] to the faith of the fathers it's not
[40:01] just a modern thing will be in modern
[40:03] times no they had something that we had
[40:05] to go and connect back with
[40:10] he didn't say God send you Elijah to
[40:12] move you forward you can't move forward
[40:14] until you go backward and pick up what
[40:16] they had because they had the faith
[40:21] and you need the faith to connect with
[40:23] the power
[40:25] and then the power leads to the promise
[40:27] to manifest the promise
[40:29] or could we give the Lord some present
[40:31] people
[40:36] oh you know they see that no fear come
[40:39] by what here in the word therefore the
[40:42] word are they be preached and the word
[40:43] preached correctly rightly divided will
[40:46] bring Faith to the people and the faith
[40:48] and the people will pull down what the
[40:50] power of the Living God that's why he
[40:53] could drop the promise you shall receive
[40:57] power
[40:59] after the Holy Ghost come upon you
[41:06] Glory
[41:08] so God sent the purpose of Elijah or
[41:11] send Eternal Hearts back to the face of
[41:13] the fathers the Fate the resurrection
[41:16] fate the original faith it will take
[41:19] faith based on forgiveness to receive
[41:21] the power that is Promised faith is to
[41:23] lead us to power power is to take us to
[41:25] the promise to manifest the promise
[41:29] first Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord
[41:31] himself descends of heaven with a shout
[41:32] but the voice of the Archangel are with
[41:35] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[41:37] shall rise first then we wish alive

[41:41] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[41:42] the air Jesus
[41:44] does all three the shout The Voice the
[41:49] Trump
[41:50] Jesus did the shout in true and by the
[41:54] prophet of Malachi 4 bringing the bread
[41:57] the word the message
[41:59] Hallelujah Jesus already did that
[42:03] Hallelujah Elias is already come and a
[42:06] message went out throughout the whole
[42:08] Earth
[42:09] to kept the seeds
[42:11] predestinated seeds a Dragnet was thrown
[42:15] out a big fish in that was thrown out
[42:17] and income the elect along with crabs
[42:21] snakes worms Turtles and whatever else
[42:24] but a Miss Holiness there is an elect
[42:28] and the elect will not be deceived
[42:32] oh get the lost some presence people
[42:35] over here
[42:38] so this this shout message was sent out
[42:42] to get three kind of Believers True
[42:44] Believers amen make Believers on
[42:47] unbelievers all got caught up in the net
[42:50] isn't that right now here we go Jesus
[42:55] did they shout in the prophet
[42:57] are you ready
[42:59] Jesus
[43:01] is now doing the voice in the brain
[43:06] first
[43:08] to identify a five-fold Ministry
[43:13] divinely appointed to rightly divide the
[43:17] word
[43:19] this can only be done by the voice of
[43:22] the archangel
[43:24] this voice
[43:26] not the angel
[43:28] but the voice of the angel
[43:32] that voice will speak the word
[43:35] and remember the spirit
[43:38] the prophet and the bride will be saying
[43:42] the same thing
[43:43] Oh Glory
[43:45] from Hebrews he said leaving let's go
[43:47] into Perfection oh my I wish I had the
[43:51] voice of an archangel now to bring this
[43:54] to a place where you could see it
[43:56] say in other words the voice of the
[44:00] Archangel is to bring Clarity of the
[44:03] vision the Kim even the prophetic vision
[44:08] and that's why habakkuk says right
[44:11] Division and make it plain
[44:14] so the voice of the Archangel is to
[44:16] bring it to a place where you could see
[44:19] what you have promised and no demon
[44:22] could rob you or cheat you out of what
[44:26] you are going after
[44:32] I'll bring it on further if a earthquake

[44:38] flat you supposed to have a vision in
[44:43] your soul as to what you going after if
[44:47] this place is divide up into 50 pieces
[44:49] and we cannot have church like we know

[45:07] if you don't have that
[45:09] you may as well prepare your tribulation
[45:11] backpack
[45:19] how to survive this tribulation
[45:22] for three and a half years yeah they get
[45:24] a book on a manual called that yeah they
[45:27] get a backpack because this is what
[45:29] we're talking about this is real gospel
[45:32] this is going back to the days of the
[45:34] Apostles yeah they were hiding in the
[45:36] upper room there was no open just waving
[45:39] their hands no they were hiding for fear
[45:41] after what was going on around they were
[45:43] hiding from the authorities waiting on
[45:46] their promise yes they were in
[45:48] Tribulation time they were under
[45:50] pressure but they was on the promise
[45:52] under pressure and on the promise under
[45:55] pressure and on the promise under stress
[45:58] on
[46:01] disappear
[46:03] but on the promise all the same
[46:05] it is wonderful to be under a promise of
[46:09] God
[46:13] how many in here know that they are
[46:17] under a promise of God
[46:21] I am not talking about your failures and
[46:24] your shortcomings and your wickedness
[46:26] and your attitude I'm not talking about
[46:28] that I'm talking about a promise of God
[46:30] you didn't ask for the promise he gave
[46:34] the promise
[46:41] the last days it shall come to pass I
[46:44] will pour out my spirit and down
[47:00] that's right
[47:04] the vision is from an appointed time
[47:05] otherwise don't get worried don't get
[47:08] fed up don't get frustrated don't act
[47:11] yeah yeah don't act miserable don't like
[47:14] that God is not in charge and God is
[47:16] under control he gave a promise be
[47:18] satisfied but the promise of God and
[47:21] worship God
[47:24] for the testimony of Jesus
[47:27] is the spirit of Prophecy
[47:30] and if you take the book
[47:32] my God
[47:34] prays if you take the book and you eat
[47:37] the book you're gonna prophesy from the
[47:39] book
[47:45] Glory
[47:47] the book
[47:49] the book will Empower you to prophesy
[47:53] some of you are eating a book I know
[47:56] because there's no bitterness in the
[47:58] belly
[47:59] the eating of the book have a result the
[48:02] Eastern of the book has an effect you
[48:04] don't eat the book and say it's a nice
[48:08] it's honey in the mouth it's honey to
[48:10] talk about it it's only to speak it it's
[48:13] only to share it it's only the
[48:16] fellowship about it but when it go down
[48:18] in the belly when it go down to the path
[48:21] it cutsy part when you have to stand and
[48:23] said no gossiping when you have to
[48:25] silence he cut off the phone with that
[48:27] foolishness when you have to stand and
[48:30] face those ministers to their face
[48:34] come on now your friends
[48:40] when you have to take a stand with your
[48:42] family with your loved ones with your
[48:44] husband with your wife with your
[48:45] children with your neighbor with a
[48:47] pastor with the Elder with a deacon with
[48:49] so-called Bishop with boobs and
[48:51] potentials and would be Apostles when
[48:53] you have to take a stand with all of
[48:54] them it's Peter in the belly but if John
[48:57] who typed the bride he took the book he
[49:01] eat the pork and it was sweet in the
[49:03] mount it was beat in the belly and the
[49:05] voice said don't must prophesy
[49:07] I can
[49:09] understood the prophecy is the testimony
[49:12] of Jesus so when you prophesy under the
[49:15] spirit of Prophecy it's the voice of the
[49:18] Archangel anoint him to produce the
[49:22] testimony of Jesus let them laugh but
[49:26] the testimony of Jesus is prophesying
[49:29] that the world will be fulfilled in your
[49:34] life

[49:53] receive it you receives me
[49:57] and he that receives me receive him that
[50:01] sent me
[50:02] and the prophet said in spoken word you
[50:04] can only serve God
[50:06] as you do and believe the servants that
[50:10] God sends
[50:11] you can only serve God on Earth as God's
[50:15] servants that send on Earth by divine
[50:19] inspiration
[50:21] interprets the word to you
[50:23] sin always God going to have to raise up
[50:26] men that will have to correctly divide
[50:29] the word not by intellectual study and
[50:32] so forth but by Divine what's that word
[50:34] divine Divine means there is not uh
[50:38] facts about it there is no emails about
[50:40] it there is no discussion about it
[50:42] Divine is just that Divine divinely
[50:46] revealed
[50:49] inspired from heaven
[50:52] how many know they are Sons and
[50:53] Daughters of God
[50:56] how many know you have a father
[51:00] and if you want to talk to you he can
[51:02] talk to you
[51:03] he wants to talk to you to her to a
[51:06] pastor
[51:09] Bishop
[51:10] praise for him to tell the priest

[1:04:22] as many as are led by the spirit and if
[1:04:25] there ever was an hour to be led by your
[1:04:28] spirit is this hour because the devil is
[1:04:30] a liar he's a deceiver he's deceitful he

[1:05:19] Jesus give the devil I call God
[1:05:22] Jesus didn't do that
[1:05:24] he never tell him who he was he just it
[1:05:27] is written
[1:05:28] it is written it is written because the
[1:05:30] word is unveiled to me
[1:05:32] it's revealed to him so he knows every
[1:05:35] one of the devil's tricks
[1:05:37] that is the only way they could really
[1:05:39] overcome to recognize the devil at every
[1:05:43] one of his tricks his main trick in this
[1:05:46] age is to get you off the word
[1:05:52] Hallelujah
[1:05:54] foreign
[1:06:00] but it's to keep you in church and take
[1:06:03] you off the word

[1:07:07] teach dogs earlier
[1:07:14] I was telling somebody that's the secret
[1:07:16] that's why I don't have no cell people
[1:07:18] lined up in front of my office trying to
[1:07:19] see me another answers are answered by
[1:07:21] the word
[1:07:22] another help by doing the preaching and
[1:07:24] so on you're getting Minister too so
[1:07:25] there's no need to line up on my office
[1:07:27] but over there I want to see you see you
[1:07:28] for what
[1:07:29] they really had to want to see me
[1:07:32] yeah because I'm trying to deal with
[1:07:34] this stuff
[1:07:36] your stuff your spirit pick up your
[1:07:39] stuff whatever your stuff they're going
[1:07:41] through there are people getting invited
[1:07:42] to our service here and then they get
[1:07:43] back afterwards they say they supposed
[1:07:45] to invite them telepaths about them
[1:07:47] I personally know who they are but the
[1:07:50] spirit pick up their stuff and when the
[1:07:52] Holy Spirit deal with their stuff they
[1:07:53] get messed up they don't like it too
[1:07:55] much but I can't help that there's
[1:07:57] something moving here that angel
[1:07:59] angels drop down
[1:08:02] because you see it's not about me it's
[1:08:05] about you
[1:08:09] that's where a lot of these ministers
[1:08:11] get tied up they think is about them and
[1:08:13] their Ministry
[1:08:16] like it's a power building but
[1:08:19] bodybuilding contest or something so and
[1:08:21] they try to display their Ministry and
[1:08:22] stuff God are not interested in that
[1:08:23] foolishness couldn't pay that flesh
[1:08:25] business one God one is some dead men
[1:08:28] because listen the faithful Ministry is
[1:08:31] for your perfection

[1:10:55] we are given an understanding by the
[1:10:57] word that we are going to understand it
[1:10:58] because they will come an efficient age
[1:11:01] to it
[1:11:02] in other words the word will make clear

[1:14:40] shortcomings blood I am all bloodied up

[1:15:01] presence
[1:15:06] Glory
[1:15:07] Glory Glory
[1:15:09] that's what Abel brought Abraham brought
[1:15:12] a lamb everybody bought blood came but
[1:15:15] the flowers of his own understanding and
[1:15:17] interpretation but everyone bought a
[1:15:19] blood offering a blood sacrifice
[1:15:22] confirming that something must die for
[1:15:25] us to live and we have to be grateful to
[1:15:27] God oh hallelujah praise God Amen Let me
[1:15:32] see that remember for mauritian Book of
[1:15:35] symbols as Daniel through the seven
[1:15:37] Thunders and utter their voices remember
[1:15:39] Daniel grabbed the pen started the right
[1:15:41] and John heard the same thing watch but
[1:15:45] on the backs of the Bible the Revelation
[1:15:47] was shown to Daniel they said that there
[1:15:48] are seven voices to be uttered that no
[1:15:50] man can open no man know what it was but
[1:15:52] the Bible said and told Daniel told John
[1:15:55] in these last days these seven voices
[1:15:58] will be made known by the real true
[1:16:02] church you get it you can see where the
[1:16:05] false and counterfeit is trying to keep
[1:16:08] great men from places like that
[1:16:11] so therefore to you the elect what's
[1:16:15] about to comfort you are going to
[1:16:17] understand it
[1:16:18] it will not fly over the heads of God
[1:16:22] elect
[1:16:23] the thing of it is this God was so
[1:16:25] mysterious that the people couldn't
[1:16:28] understand him or comprehend he was just
[1:16:31] too mysterious by the Jerome and he
[1:16:34] wanted
[1:16:35] to reveal himself so it pushed God to
[1:16:38] the point where he became one of us
[1:16:42] to be touched to be handled and John
[1:16:46] beautifully said it this way in the
[1:16:47] beginning was the word
[1:16:49] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:16:52] and the word became flesh
[1:16:56] and dwell Among Us so God made it so
[1:16:59] plain not even fool should hurt therein
[1:17:02] no you cannot
[1:17:04] separate in the church the nature from
[1:17:07] the spiritual because they were ordained
[1:17:09] to be together
[1:17:10] there's nothing right in the church bad
[1:17:13] good
[1:17:15] Renegade rebellious
[1:17:17] but the elected is the foreknown of God
[1:17:21] chosen from the foundation of the world
[1:17:23] and here we go are you ready and
[1:17:26] Vindicated
[1:17:28] by the process that he God in his wisdom
[1:17:31] takes them through
[1:17:33] I want to hear a beginning on that one
[1:17:36] be elected is the foreknown of God and
[1:17:41] they are Vindicated by the process
[1:17:45] that God in his wisdom takes them
[1:17:48] through
[1:17:49] by their place of trying Wilderness
[1:17:52] testing trials whatever else to prove to
[1:17:57] these sons and daughters that they are
[1:17:58] not like Eve
[1:18:04] as a baby
[1:18:07] somebody take a camera clicks pillow
[1:18:11] looks good
[1:18:12] but that pillow fight over that baby is
[1:18:15] a sign that that is elected
[1:18:17] predestinated for ordained gift to the
[1:18:21] Earth
[1:18:22] now
[1:18:23] let's talk process
[1:18:27] you see people like the lights they like
[1:18:30] the picture they like poles and with
[1:18:32] Angel and knights and Rain monsters
[1:18:34] always fine but let's talk about process
[1:18:36] you see this is the point a young man
[1:18:39] want to drive a car you see people
[1:18:40] driving I want to drive two but there's
[1:18:41] a process you have to get a license you
[1:18:44] have to be tested on the road if you
[1:18:46] don't get that you are illegally driving
[1:18:47] your father's car
[1:18:51] people want to get big jobs but they
[1:18:53] don't want to get the big results and
[1:18:55] the papers of the exams but to go and
[1:18:58] get this big job you have to get some
[1:18:59] big qualifications to get the big
[1:19:01] qualification you gotta get some big
[1:19:02] studies and you have to pass these big
[1:19:04] exams
[1:19:05] then you can get this big job
[1:19:08] it is called the process there's also
[1:19:11] something called the process of
[1:19:13] character development
[1:19:15] because
[1:19:19] of course of course please don't let you
[1:19:22] talk about that
[1:19:24] God want to bless you God I'm gonna
[1:19:25] bless you oh yeah
[1:19:29] I too blessed to be stressed oh yeah
[1:19:31] what kind of catchphrases and stuff I'm
[1:19:33] gonna have to do with that you know like
[1:19:35] them inventing in their own mind
[1:19:37] God say Abraham you are blessed Abraham
[1:19:40] said oh I bless I have no children
[1:19:42] go see a plain rude come outside let me
[1:19:44] show you these Stars start the count
[1:19:46] I run out of numbers he said so shall
[1:19:48] your seat be now go back and worship God
[1:19:56] you know holy promise and you don't tell
[1:20:00] them how long they will live for and
[1:20:01] Abraham didn't know his 25 years and
[1:20:03] you've ever said hear this beauty he's
[1:20:05] staggered not
[1:20:07] the promise of God
[1:20:10] unbelieved but what's wrong
[1:20:13] come on now Sean
[1:20:16] said Give In Praise let me hear you give
[1:20:21] a shout
[1:20:29] yeah
[1:20:31] brother oven are you seeing that the
[1:20:34] stronger I get in faith is the more I
[1:20:36] will get in Praise of course
[1:20:38] of course
[1:20:40] because the day God gave you a promise
[1:20:41] every day is closer to it
[1:20:44] the problem the problem is when you
[1:20:46] don't have a promise that is pressure
[1:20:49] Hallelujah
[1:20:51] that is pressure when you don't have a
[1:20:52] promise when he promised delivering in
[1:20:54] favor of time Moses coming 400 years of
[1:20:56] people in bondage and their money
[1:20:58] passing generalization from deliver
[1:21:00] coming deliver coming somebody's in a
[1:21:02] tired yet you have to hit again it's
[1:21:04] prophecy liver is coming
[1:21:08] Spirit of Prophecy Moses is coming
[1:21:10] somebody coming
[1:21:13] you're saying that since they're small
[1:21:15] you're a long beard you all know you're
[1:21:17] still coming
[1:21:21] well a hundred years past you just gotta
[1:21:23] wait 300 more
[1:21:26] yeah and after 150
[1:21:27] 250 150 more but what about when it's
[1:21:31] 375.
[1:21:34] 280. 295 five more years
[1:21:38] 291
[1:21:40] 299
[1:21:43] nine months
[1:21:48] Baby Moses born
[1:21:50] nine months
[1:21:52] and delivered not mature yet not ready
[1:21:54] to speak no flies yet be able deliver in
[1:21:57] baby form
[1:21:59] deliver in seed form God loved the
[1:22:02] seating you know when he went to whip up
[1:22:05] the enemy he just threw a seed
[1:22:08] devil walking the devil can't see the
[1:22:10] devil can't touch that's why when he
[1:22:12] broke the seven sea silence
[1:22:16] silence
[1:22:18] but only for half an hour because God
[1:22:21] won't be silent for too long the silence
[1:22:23] have to be broken
[1:22:25] and when the seed is exceeded silent
[1:22:28] it's all locked up waiting for rain
[1:22:30] but if I could only get brain to see
[1:22:33] this dry but he promised lots of rain it
[1:22:36] shall come to pass I'll pour out pour
[1:22:39] out pour out pour out
[1:22:44] all right
[1:22:46] I'm the devil's job is to make sure he
[1:22:49] put the umbrella over your seat
[1:22:55] don't let that rain
[1:22:57] touch don't let that water touch that
[1:23:00] you know because anytime that water hit
[1:23:02] your seed you're gonna have a breakup
[1:23:04] you're gonna have to cry
[1:23:06] you're gonna start the ball you're gonna
[1:23:08] start to groan all this around we
[1:23:10] will break out we can't be the same when
[1:23:14] the water of his Mercy water of his
[1:23:17] Blessing though water of his spirit
[1:23:23] blame you
[1:23:25] but let me press it a little bit when
[1:23:27] you praise
[1:23:29] and worship you are actually watering
[1:23:33] the seed
[1:23:36] so the devil's job is to kill your
[1:23:39] praise
[1:23:43] why you think sin is so important to the
[1:23:46] devil not just for it to sin you know
[1:23:48] you may be seated let me just say this
[1:23:50] here
[1:23:52] the devil know you are sons and
[1:23:55] daughters
[1:23:56] God deny that right
[1:23:58] but he could make you lose your joy of
[1:24:00] salvation
[1:24:02] and he could cut you off from your
[1:24:04] access right because if you get your
[1:24:06] messed up it come like you lose your
[1:24:09] channel to approach your God
[1:24:12] so his job is to trick you trap you mess
[1:24:16] you up when you come you're heavy why am
[1:24:19] I people heavy
[1:24:20] heavy leading
[1:24:22] burdenedong
[1:24:23] say praise God your hand how to do so
[1:24:25] like if y'all exercise
[1:24:32] come on now you can make it you can you
[1:24:35] can make it up you can make it happen
[1:24:36] yeah sure how long it could still
[1:24:38] because you could make it that's not
[1:24:39] what God wants that's what kind of
[1:24:41] Stingy praise when Jesus come on that
[1:24:43] donkey you know when kings come in that
[1:24:45] fail out and whatnot Kings Kings Kings
[1:24:47] with the crown and all the village and
[1:24:50] the whole city come out when Jesus come
[1:24:51] on a donkey that was their King the
[1:24:54] Bible said the king come lonely he had
[1:24:56] no clung on him but that was the king
[1:24:58] and and they begin to chewable branches
[1:25:00] that you roll the carpet you will always
[1:25:03] have to roll they did not Catholic they
[1:25:06] had branches and they dropped the
[1:25:08] branches in Jesus king moving slowly on
[1:25:12] that donkey the king coming lonely
[1:25:14] according to scriptures
[1:25:22] Hallelujah
[1:25:26] what what a sight to behold when King
[1:25:30] Herod come in a king
[1:25:35] big trumpet song in
[1:25:37] Bing all kind of confettis falling and
[1:25:40] all kinds of showing up but this King
[1:25:43] different King
[1:25:44] different King now he's the king of
[1:25:46] kings the Lord of lords not a white
[1:25:50] stallion all pumped up and so on a
[1:25:53] donkey on Sat no no person inside Jesus
[1:25:56] told me
[1:26:02] this is a special one no man sat on that
[1:26:05] one before this is King thing
[1:26:08] this is Kingdom King and where are we
[1:26:11] going well you're on a church went
[1:26:14] before where this pride is going
[1:26:17] oh Hallelujah
[1:26:20] we shall reign on the air
[1:26:34] I see
[1:26:36] the sense of empowerment
[1:26:39] when truth comes to you
[1:26:41] you could feel truth
[1:26:43] you could connect with truth you can't
[1:26:46] even explain anything and they follow
[1:26:49] Jesus and I mean they couldn't
[1:26:51] understand everything he's saying but he
[1:26:53] he doesn't know alone has the words of
[1:26:55] eternal life your words touch me your
[1:26:58] word redeem me your word reach me your
[1:27:01] word does something to me they knew it
[1:27:04] was God the word is God and that was God
[1:27:08] made flesh and prayer Among Us
[1:27:10] the word itself
[1:27:12] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:14] so God vindicates you by the process he
[1:27:16] takes the truth
[1:27:18] God did not say because William Branham

[1:27:41] and let's check the reality
[1:27:43] he lost his wife
[1:27:45] he lost his daughter
[1:27:48] that's part of the process he lost the
[1:27:50] anointing he didn't listen to God and
[1:27:53] obey God and God discipline him
[1:28:00] twenty percent saying Amen on that
[1:28:03] they had it with discipline
[1:28:05] but you know that is what the word
[1:28:06] disciple come from

[1:38:24] they could just take anything and make
[1:38:25] up a meal oh this that's right are there
[1:38:27] some people not so very inspired in the
[1:38:30] cooking area we're not going to touch
[1:38:31] that
[1:38:34] there's people are inspired musicians
[1:38:38] they're inspired touch the board touch
[1:38:40] the guitar they're inspired there are
[1:38:43] some people who are inspired singers

[1:38:57] but there are people like inspired and
[1:39:00] sowing in whatever there's an
[1:39:02] inspiration that connects to your life
[1:39:06] and that anointing there's a fate
[1:39:09] that nobody could change and replace
[1:39:12] and that's why Jesus ah his faith was
[1:39:16] based upon who he was and not the
[1:39:18] anointing upon him and that's perfect
[1:39:20] faith when you come one with the inside
[1:39:23] when one with God one with the word
[1:39:27] when there's no conflict within you
[1:39:32] and your words are true and genuine
[1:39:35] you're not in hypocrisy you're not
[1:39:36] saying one thing with the lips and
[1:39:37] thinking one another God bless you and
[1:39:39] your mind saying I hate you if I could
[1:39:41] have let you have it and let you have it
[1:39:43] but God bless you

[1:40:01] happened every time they wash something
[1:40:04] breaking and they don't know why it slip
[1:40:07] out it's slip out they sleep out but
[1:40:09] they pay too small laughs
[1:40:11] if they increase the pay I showed
[1:40:14] nothing I go break after that
[1:40:15] but the master mean
[1:40:19] sort of lives out

[1:44:55] age this is a really evil age so instead
[1:44:58] a woman plead guilty for killing six
[1:44:59] children
[1:45:01] six babies
[1:45:03] it's an evil age
[1:45:04] the kind of condition it's horrible
[1:45:07] why would I want to be in the
[1:45:09] tribulation period
[1:45:10] getting a tribulation backpack could you
[1:45:13] imagine miss any rapture
[1:45:15] I'm trying to figure out how you're
[1:45:16] going to survive three and a half years
[1:45:17] you can't buy or sell except you take
[1:45:20] the mark
[1:45:21] of the Beast
[1:45:23] and you know if you take the mark of the
[1:45:25] beach that's it
[1:45:26] oh Hallelujah all dwell on the earth
[1:45:28] worshiping
[1:45:29] oh Hallelujah everything is set you know
[1:45:32] the bombs already said listen when they
[1:45:33] invented slingshot
[1:45:35] they use it bow and arrow they use it
[1:45:38] one bullet gun stuff it boom
[1:45:41] they use it one bullet at a time
[1:45:43] cannon fire
[1:45:46] boom they use it
[1:45:48] every weapon man made he has used it
[1:45:52] man you should see the kind of weapons
[1:45:54] that Russia have and missile and bomb
[1:45:56] could destroy so much and they only
[1:45:59] building more and improving
[1:46:01] now they have one that ever gliff off
[1:46:03] it's selling six dummies
[1:46:06] and one is in real one
[1:46:08] so you try to shoot it down you don't
[1:46:09] know which one you're shooting them
[1:46:12] that is okay and children Rich very
[1:46:14] smart very intelligent we can't fight up
[1:46:17] with King Gerald you can study how to
[1:46:19] make an underground bunker to protect
[1:46:21] you from these guys out there it makes
[1:46:23] no sense I'm not looking for underground
[1:46:26] I'm looking to go in the rapture
[1:46:28] and I know it will take Rapture and
[1:46:31] faith I know it will take the life of
[1:46:33] Jesus so till you have to die
[1:46:38] I'm not hearing you
[1:46:40] we have to die
[1:46:43] no excuse
[1:46:45] this has to live
[1:46:50] and if God put your wife like Moses on
[1:46:53] to be hot tempered that you could get
[1:46:54] tempers
[1:47:02] I hope that the other confirmation
[1:47:06] but but I'm talking about it
[1:47:08] as I'm talking about whatever God put
[1:47:11] in order to hone your life
[1:47:15] for for to get his character and his
[1:47:18] nature because is he correct another
[1:47:20] gift that's why giving the children
[1:47:22] money doesn't help them it will just
[1:47:23] spend giving them to help them help them
[1:47:27] it's not helping them they have to go
[1:47:29] through
[1:47:30] that's why I had to get on the human
[1:47:32] because you're feeling sorry for them
[1:47:34] that is not God's Syrian that's not
[1:47:37] God's compassion God's compassion is
[1:47:39] doing the will of God sometimes they
[1:47:41] have to pain sometimes they have to
[1:47:43] strain you crack the egg of the chicken
[1:47:45] you will kill it
[1:47:47] you could smother your children with the
[1:47:49] wrong kind of a love hug them so tight
[1:47:51] they lose their breath and they die
[1:47:53] right in your arms because they love
[1:47:55] them so much
[1:47:57] that is not love
[1:48:00] that's foolishness actually
[1:48:03] because our example is not
[1:48:05] our appearance our example is God
[1:48:10] the Bible says love your wife as Christ
[1:48:13] love the church not as your father of
[1:48:15] your mother okay father know like
[1:48:17] trouble so not using that as the example
[1:48:20] use any word as the example as Christ
[1:48:22] loved the church show odd men to love
[1:48:25] their wives
[1:48:26] so what you have no excuse
[1:48:29] well I come to this and I come to that
[1:48:31] look at the Bible
[1:48:32] look at the word that's how we coming
[1:48:34] back to the word as Christ loved the
[1:48:37] church and give himself for it
[1:48:42] so miss that you have to step up
[1:48:47] take responsibility
[1:48:50] oh my Lord
[1:48:52] Hallelujah where
[1:48:55] because we came from toward the flesh
[1:48:59] and Bypass or theophany
[1:49:01] we are here to reconnect to our
[1:49:04] theophany by way of the word
[1:49:06] do you believe that
[1:49:09] the Sedum the thought that we are in God
[1:49:13] could not be expressed because a word is
[1:49:15] not expressed and therefore by the word
[1:49:18] the forming of the word image this word
[1:49:21] back to the word the unveiling of God
[1:49:24] the word the revealing of the Solomon
[1:49:27] was revealing the word the land of
[1:49:29] promises these promises are the world
[1:49:31] the word is coming to you
[1:49:34] by way of the third pull
[1:49:37] which is the opening of the world
[1:49:40] the word truly have to open to you that
[1:49:44] you as an individual bride member could
[1:49:47] see your promises and your inheritance
[1:49:49] you've got to see it you have to go
[1:49:52] beyond salvation it's not good just to
[1:49:54] be saved you must want your inheritance
[1:49:57] because that is what Jesus died for Adam
[1:50:00] lost the book Jesus died to pay the
[1:50:03] price to get back to book Revelation 10
[1:50:06] the book came on the earth version 10 8
[1:50:08] the voice said take the book and eat it
[1:50:10] before there is a further manifestation
[1:50:13] there got to be the spirit of Prophecy
[1:50:19] and the prophecy must be upon you
[1:50:21] How Could You prophesy over your own
[1:50:23] life and act negative
[1:50:26] or could you probably say over your wife
[1:50:28] and don't have the expectation for the
[1:50:29] Fulfillment in her life
[1:50:32] Jesus
[1:50:33] when the report came man said Lord my
[1:50:35] daughter is sick
[1:50:36] somebody come and say forget about it do
[1:50:38] ask him again she's dead he said I go
[1:50:41] with her
[1:50:43] Hallelujah
[1:50:45] she wasn't awoke right away
[1:50:47] but Jesus said I go to wake up
[1:50:49] yeah he comes walking the coward is
[1:50:51] around him he said get him out get him
[1:50:53] out get him out just just bring a few
[1:50:55] elected believing people around me he's
[1:50:58] a little girl rise up and walk give her
[1:51:00] something to eat and Jesus walked out
[1:51:02] that was normal to him he has a dull
[1:51:05] little girl and also a drama he did no
[1:51:07] need for that he was the word
[1:51:09] rise up and walk that's how you're going
[1:51:11] to become
[1:51:16] so stop pretending
[1:51:20] stop acting you're angry you're angry
[1:51:24] be angry and sin nut
[1:51:27] let me take it I'm going to fight
[1:51:28] there's a different business
[1:51:30] you're angry you could let God cool The
[1:51:32] Temper down hunger down hastiness
[1:51:34] whatever it is that is where you get
[1:51:37] things to pray about
[1:51:38] that's why God is still not to hit some
[1:51:40] time of Trials because we're not broken
[1:51:42] enough yeah yeah we're content satisfied
[1:51:46] you see and you think things working
[1:51:48] kind of cool you're not all way away I
[1:51:50] want to be but it's so cool that you
[1:51:52] yourself get cool
[1:51:53] you're walking in a cocoon of coolness
[1:51:55] and God said the People Too Cool
[1:51:58] Hallelujah then God try to come and

[1:55:33] hallelujah praise be to Jesus you love
[1:55:36] him this morning
[1:55:38] Hallelujah can you take a little more
[1:55:44] Daniel 8 15 and it came to pass that I
[1:55:47] even Daniel
[1:55:49] and sought for the meaning and behold
[1:55:52] there stood before me the appearance of
[1:55:55] a man
[1:55:56] and I heard a man's voice between the
[1:55:58] banks of ulai which called and said
[1:56:00] Gabriel make this man to understand the
[1:56:03] vision
[1:56:04] so he came near Where I Stood or when he
[1:56:07] came I was afraid and fell upon my face
[1:56:11] but he said unto me understand osunaman
[1:56:14] for at the time of the end shall be
[1:56:19] division
[1:56:21] Daniel 9 20 and while I was speaking and
[1:56:24] praying and confessing my sin and the
[1:56:27] sin of My People Israel
[1:56:28] I'm presented my supplication before the
[1:56:31] Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my
[1:56:33] God yeah while I was speaking in prayer
[1:56:35] even the man Gabriel whom I've seen in
[1:56:37] the vision at the beginning being caused
[1:56:39] the flight swiftly touched me about the
[1:56:41] time of the even oblation
[1:56:43] and he informed me
[1:56:45] and talk with me and said oh Daniel
[1:56:48] I am now come fought to give these skill
[1:56:52] and understanding
[1:56:54] at the beginning of his application the
[1:56:56] Commandment came forth and I come to
[1:56:59] show thee for our greatly beloved
[1:57:01] therefore understand the matter and
[1:57:04] consider the vision
[1:57:06] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[1:57:08] and upon thy Holy City to finish the
[1:57:11] transgression to make of end of sins to
[1:57:14] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[1:57:16] bring in Everlasting righteousness and
[1:57:19] this is the part I want to get up here
[1:57:20] and to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:57:24] and to anoint
[1:57:26] the most holy
[1:57:28] no but Abraham and the sixthful purpose
[1:57:30] of Gabriel
[1:57:31] he was highlighting that path to seal up
[1:57:33] the vision and prophecy because the
[1:57:35] vision and prophecy was sealed
[1:57:37] but we are promised that that Vision
[1:57:40] will be unsealed isn't that right
[1:57:43] because God told us the book is sealed
[1:57:46] till the time of the end
[1:57:48] Daniel 12 Michael shall stand up the
[1:57:51] great Prince notice
[1:57:53] watch and many of them that sleep in the
[1:57:56] dust of people shall awake some
[1:57:57] everlasting life some the Everlasting
[1:57:59] shame and contempt and those that turn
[1:58:02] away turn to many to righteousness of
[1:58:04] the Stars forever but Daniel
[1:58:07] showed the words seal the book even to
[1:58:11] the time of the end what is it do you
[1:58:13] see it class here we go this revelation
[1:58:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:58:18] and of his power here we go all his
[1:58:21] coming
[1:58:21] of the end time was sealed up until this
[1:58:26] time
[1:58:27] that is what he come to do it's hit from
[1:58:30] the scholars seal it up until the time
[1:58:33] of the end close up the words what did
[1:58:35] he do to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:58:39] Daniel had prophesied these things he
[1:58:43] saw it in a vision and the angel came
[1:58:46] down to seal the vision
[1:58:48] and to seal the prophecy that they can
[1:58:52] read it but cannot understand it until
[1:58:55] the end time
[1:58:57] or could we hear again
[1:58:59] what is the end time the end of the
[1:59:02] sentient week when the prince the
[1:59:03] Antichrist will be revealed making
[1:59:05] himself God
[1:59:07] oh Hallelujah so in other words this on
[1:59:11] ceiling the time is now
[1:59:13] but when the seventh seed broke
[1:59:15] something was hidden under there you
[1:59:17] know what was under there you won the
[1:59:18] deer you were sealed under there
[1:59:21] you were hidden under there so therefore
[1:59:25] unsealing the vision and prophecy also
[1:59:27] mean unsealing you
[1:59:29] Oh Glory the God to bring you out into a
[1:59:34] manifestation oh Hallelujah as many as
[1:59:38] received him to them give you power to
[1:59:41] become the sons of God
[1:59:46] so we're not coming back our sons saved
[1:59:49] Sons salvation no our sonship is Romans

[2:02:39] because of what Jesus did when he died
[2:02:41] he went down and preached to those who
[2:02:43] were in prison those who heard it that
[2:02:45] Noah's day and then receive it this
[2:02:47] Source had to be preached to and I'm not

[2:02:52] a Ministry to preach to people who
[2:02:54] cannot be saved

[2:03:02] they can't touch it
[2:03:03] what a horrible time that's going to be

[2:27:11] tomorrow please God
[2:27:14] tomorrow is as we know it's kind of a
[2:27:17] Monday and the vision of the youth
[2:27:19] ministry was to do something to really
[2:27:21] get the young people engaged and about
[2:27:24] two weeks ago we spoke with them and we
[2:27:27] said our mandate our responsibility the
[2:27:29] goal and purpose of tomorrow was to
[2:27:33] achieve two things one to bring the
[2:27:35] young people closer to Christ and closer
[2:27:38] to each other and we have endeavored to
[2:27:41] put a program together a multi-faceted
[2:27:44] program to really try to facilitate this
[2:27:47] so we are soliciting your support and we
[2:27:49] like to encourage all of the young
[2:27:51] people to be there tomorrow we have
[2:27:52] certain activities planned um some of it
[2:27:55] would be team based but we are not
[2:27:57] setting permanent teams so don't worry
[2:27:59] about being in a permanent team or
[2:28:00] wearing a specific color the objective
[2:28:02] is not to have competition is to have
[2:28:04] Fellowship so for different activities
[2:28:06] we just split up in groups and be very
[2:28:08] flexible with it because at the end of
[2:28:09] the day we want everyone to be drawn
[2:28:11] closer to Christ and closer to each
[2:28:14] other we also would like to request for
[2:28:17] those of you who can afford a
[2:28:19] contribution of twenty dollars towards
[2:28:21] the food I will be preparing
[2:28:23] um there's a bit of a cookout but like I
[2:28:25] said it's not a competition
[2:28:27] um but there would be two different
[2:28:28] menus being prepared mostly by the young
[2:28:30] people with some support from the calebs
[2:28:33] um for the young people to be able to
[2:28:35] have a wonderful lunch
[2:28:37] um beyond that we want to make it very
[2:28:39] clear that the invitation is open to
[2:28:41] everyone in church as well our Target
[2:28:44] was really to get the young people
[2:28:45] engaged but everyone is also invited if
[2:28:48] you would like to come up to the
[2:28:49] Tabernacle tomorrow and have Fellowship
[2:28:51] one with another you can feel free to
[2:28:52] work with some snacks um there should be
[2:28:54] some extra fooders as well but you could
[2:28:56] work with some snacks and just have a
[2:28:58] grand time in the Lord tomorrow please
[2:28:59] God so the focus is really on the young
[2:29:02] people but the entire church you're
[2:29:03] welcome to come we we want to be here
[2:29:06] from 9 00 a.m tomorrow morning and to
[2:29:10] try to take advantage of the day and
[2:29:13] have people back heading to home at a
[2:29:16] reasonable hour as well so I trust that
[2:29:18] that came across pretty clear I don't
[2:29:20] think I forgot anything with respect to
[2:29:21] that but focus on the young people
[2:29:24] um 20 contribution from the young people
[2:29:26] for those of you who can make that
[2:29:28] towards the groceries I've bought to for
[2:29:31] the cookout and the whole church is
[2:29:33] invited
[2:29:34] um
[2:29:35] very important as well right after this
[2:29:38] service brother Uber would like to meet
[2:29:40] with all of the deacons ushers the
[2:29:43] technical team the parking attendance
[2:29:46] and the musicians right after the
[2:29:47] service so the deacons ushers the
[2:29:50] technical team the musicians and the
[2:29:51] parking attendants mordova would like to
[2:29:53] meet with you after this service and um
[2:29:57] next week's service is going to be very
[2:29:58] important remove it has some stuff he
[2:30:00] wants to share with respect to our
[2:30:03] upcoming convention July 3rd 4th and 5th
[2:30:06] and if it's the first time you're
[2:30:08] hearing it we are under great
[2:30:09] expectation for a seven Thunder Revival
[2:30:12] that's the reason we are here but the
[2:30:14] random said the bride has not had a
[2:30:16] Revival yet it will take the seven
[2:30:18] Thunders to wake her up so we are
[2:30:21] prophesying we are declaring we are
[2:30:23] speaking for a seven Thunder Revival and
[2:30:27] we have no excuse but to have a Revival
[2:30:29] here brother Branham said what we see
[2:30:31] should put our souls into action to make
[2:30:34] a church that will make a Revival so
[2:30:37] brother open ones the church to know
[2:30:39] that after service next week he wants to
[2:30:41] address the church with respect to the
[2:30:43] convention and certain things that we
[2:30:44] want to put in place so we'd like
[2:30:46] everyone to make every effort to be here
[2:30:48] over the course of this week I receive
[2:30:51] emails already we already have people in
[2:30:53] France who already have their plane
[2:30:55] tickets to arrive here we have already
[2:30:56] about 12 people coming in from France
[2:30:58] about nine from Ghana some Believers
[2:31:01] from Nigeria and we haven't even sent
[2:31:03] out the official invitations as yet
[2:31:06] so we are under greater excitement and
[2:31:09] anticipation for what God is going to do
[2:31:10] in our mids going to church say Amen
[2:31:13] so we expect everyone to be willing to
[2:31:15] put their shoulder to the wheel because
[2:31:18] it cannot be a one-man effort or a small
[2:31:20] group effort but everyone has their part
[2:31:23] to play in the kingdom of God you know a
[2:31:24] lot of people say they love the Lord and
[2:31:26] when you ask them what are you willing
[2:31:27] to do for the kingdom that's that's a
[2:31:30] different thing so we want to give
[2:31:31] everyone the opportunity to be a part of
[2:31:33] this great initiative so just to recap
[2:31:36] the announcements tomorrow we are under
[2:31:38] great expectation to see all the young
[2:31:40] people and all of the key Labs who can
[2:31:42] be here for around 9 A.M we'll be here
