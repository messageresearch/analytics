announced them right after the service but this time you want to go straight to the scriptures you want to look at first samuel chapter 16. i want to read from verse 1 to 13. i want to read one verse in proverbs 23 you want to read verse 7 and acts chapter 13 i want to read verse 21 to 22. the title of the message this morning is that the lord looks at the heart that's the title this morning the lord looks at the heart this is for samuel 16 god speaking to his prophet samuel and the lord said unto samuel how long will god mourn for soul cena rejected him from reigning over israel fill that horn with oil and go i will assembly to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons samuel said how can i go it's all here he will kill me and the lord said take a heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will surely what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i shall name unto thee and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comes out peaceably and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourself and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice he gave him the pass when they would come he looked on ilya and said surely the lord's anointed this before him and the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord see it not as man see it for man look at the outward appearance but the lord looked on the heart and then jesse called abinad and made him pass before samuel and the lord and and he said neither had the lord chosen this then jesse made sharma to pass by he said neither had the lord chosen this again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord had not chosen these samuel said unto jesse i did i hear all my children he said there is remaining yet the youngest and behold he keep it the sheep and samuel said on the jersey side and fetch him for we will not sit down jerry come here and he sent and brought him and he was a ruddy and little a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rana on a look at proverbs chapter 23 verse 7 say far as he tinket in his heart so is he eat and drinks that he to thee but with his heart is not with thee last scripture reading from acts chapter 13 verse 21 and afterwards talking about israel they desire the king and god give unto them saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be the king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will let's pray father we thank you for your written word and only you could bring the context and the inspiration behind this tonight this morning and i pray you just speak to us and and take me behind the cross and hide and be in calvary's cross and speak to your people this morning in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seasoned it's such a blessing to be here to be alive to be in health to be in good strength that you could raise your hand and worship the lord you didn't come here to me to see me you come here into presence and if you come in the presence you want to commit respect you want to commit honor you want to come at thanksgiving you want to commit gratefulness in your heart for the privilege to be here how much people who have gone to hell all the people who lose on that chance right now this morning would have wished to take up your seat this morning they don't even stand a chance some people out in the hospital they kind of talk the chance has gone they missed the turn and they don't have a chance to reboot and come back to say i'm sorry forgive me i want to serve you no chance they're gone and we have a responsibility to be a witness of jesus christ we have a real responsibility to testify about the lord because ready or not you have to meet him let me say it again ready or not you have to meet him the voice of god will call all the dead not just christians you know every band that dead have to be called to account for what they did in this body oh hallelujah you better find out why they alter why your maker put you on this earth there's a reason why i call you there's a reason why you're here this morning okay so the title is the lord looked on the heart and i want to share some things with you that i feel i want you and the church to know by the grace of god there's a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational line it has no age line it has no respect of prisoners it's on young it's on all it's on good it's on bad it's on everybody p r e h s u r e pressure no limitations we're living in an erotic age nervous tension everybody's racing here going here going nowhere it's just a kind of age and i see people speeding over take me and boom boom boom and then here come the traffic and the speed in which you overtake you swear to god them they reach and come back already and you see them two cars ahead right there they say what is the first and i know this church will be plagued with it as everywhere is plagiated the tabernacle is plagued with it the whole world it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry get up and wait nervous tension the wife says something i look on cherry you want to fly off temper husband says something you pat your foot and tell him to get out get in the room no husband i don't wanna always with you go out here wife i'm so nervous what's the matter it's a tension buildup it will make the poor act that way and together this tension and the results of it results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place that's what pressure make people do pressure this pressure is the atmosphere it's a spirit as the atmosphere is something that pressing people make the husband fly loose with the white flying loose and and act the wrong way and say the wrong thing let's continue praise the lord that's right no it will make the poor act that way it will make the middle class act that way it will make the rich act that way it will make the wrong act that way it will make the pretty good act that way it make the good act that way because it's that tension is a steam built up and it got the blood somewhere so you blow the boiler up you have to let off this scene no everybody is guilty of it i am guilty you all are guilty we all do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's an excess of pressure built up today isn't that right and i believe he said is the enemy coming down i believe it's the devil so it's the devil's job to put pressure on you that you act the wrong way because he don't want you act the right way and think the right thoughts and speak the right words he doesn't want that he wants you to be constantly under pressure so when you're thinking this come true from something else and it's something else and you're frustrated and when you when you see it frustrating so he loves that he smile whenever then we'll come out your mouth i'm so frustrated devil get your pat on your shoulder and rub your hair down he said come on now you you know you are frustrated and you're not even a little depressed too because that's the next thing tonight because when you're depressed you're falling a hole you don't want to see nobody you don't want to talk to nobody you don't want to get off your bed because you're depressed that all that satan you know [Applause] all that is lucifer you know loose on the earth all lucifer people expose him this morning you're fed up you're frustrated and no no no don't get fed up no you're getting a word this morning oh glory to god what if the woman the whale was fed up she didn't even know what kind of hat she had oh glory to god her life was messed up she had four men they wanted to live in it wasn't hers but god saw something inside that woman that he could send jesus after her that jesus could wait on her because god doesn't look as man look god is look at the heart he does look completely different so don't come with your own thinking this morning oh give the lord a shout oh give the lord some praises this morning i don't care what your neighbors say about you i don't care what your wife say about you i don't care what your husband say about you it is what god [Applause] say about you [Applause] the devil would go about like a roaring lion in the last days he would get you under pressure hurrying over something and you will make decisions that you would make if you sat down and think it over how much marriages would a hole today if people had to think over the choice of their wife and pray about it how much relationships would have been so different if they had sought the lord and get a clear answer from god but the pressure the pressure let me say that one again making decisions that you wouldn't make if you sit down and think it over but god has the answer and that is what we want to take the answer now when the old testament there was a time when a man could build pressure up there and there was a time when he done something wrong under pressure and if he said innocent blood and he was on the run as soon as that man was killed he wronged he did the man he did wrong to some of the people would haunt him and if they found him they would kill him because in those days was tooth for toot eye for eye life for life and there was the place where the man couldn't stop here to run if he done something accidentally of course people wouldn't believe it i was there and i would do something any man fell on a knife and nobody believed in them something accidentally the relatives of this man or woman whoever it was would start hunting him if i took for two that's the way they lived and he couldn't stop nowhere he was a fugitive he didn't know what to do he was on the run and the very time of the day i think that's called so much pressure we are on the run that's the matter with the world knowing the commons alone is at hand the pressure is building up they're on the run roadhouse gambling luxury sin immoral decay they give vent listen to the television dirty jokes they unvent they only run they want to face up the wall in a parameter and they're clicking on some comedian cracking jokes and you laughing laughing afterwards you can laugh you laughing as long as the comedian giving talk you laugh and after that you're still in trouble hallelujah they know something is fiction to take place the world speaks of it something is fixing to take place so in the old testament god seeing in some of this trouble was accidentally done so if you're innocent and not guilty god makes a way for you if a man killed a man just deliberately and premeditated he was lost he could not come into this place but if he did accidentally he didn't mean to do it there was a city of refuge god himself set that up a city of refuge that you could run and be safe could we give the lord a shout hallelujah and one of those places was rama gilead four places joshua places cities of refuge now the people could come into the city of refuge if they accidentally did something wrong he didn't mean to he would come to the city of refuge go to the gate the people asking why are you coming that was his idea of coming and then his case was pleaded and his case was pleaded at the gate and the man won to be innocent he did not willfully and the man was taken to the city as a place of refuge then the enemy could not get him and when god set up a place that you could hide no enemy could get you i'm not talking about your thoughts i'm not talking about your ideas i'm talking about what god set up he has set up a way of escape he has set up a place of refuge where you could find shelter oh glory to god amen do you believe that if he done something wrong and was guilty his enemy have a right to come and they say if he was whole under the horns of the altars and he made a privilege and a right to drag him from the earth and kill him because he was guilty premeditated course he said and then when once he got in the city he could let off the pressure he was safe he was all right of course there was a provided place for him god provided way for the innocent man not to be slain but to be exempted from this lane because he accidentally did it he didn't mean to do it now if he meant to do it that's different now there are two classes in the world today there are men and women of the world today that really don't want to do the things they're doing and jude identifies some of that he said and of some have compassion making a difference that people who are in weakness we can reflect we can this week and that and they're struggling and they definitely give them a hard time they are different from people who are just brute beasts and don't care so jude said and of some have compassion so let's continue now men and women today who really don't don't want to do what they're doing they don't want to sin i feel sorry for them they don't want to do anything wrong but they do it they are drove to it no there's a place for that person that wants to do right let me say it again there's a place for that person that wants to do right hallelujah there's a place to let off the pressure but there's some that doesn't even care that's different they don't care what they do they're okay who see who know they don't care we're not talking about them we're talking about you who want to do right and jew the book of jude uh jude and brother joe share this with me that the four groups of rhinos that are here groups you're talking about you talk about uh uh those that are sanctified and preserved in jesus christ he said i i beloved i give diligence the right unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was more delivered to the saints in other words you lost it you don't have it fight for it you once had it it was once or wrong that's why you could say how could somebody be adopted and there's no apostolic church identified we have to go back to the apostolic church in other words we have to go back to our church with the faith restored could we say i'll shout on that the bible prophesied this faith gonna be here not talk faith not preach faith the real faith what they had in other words there's gonna be an apostolic church with jesus christ walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp oh glory to god do you believe that how many believe that glory to god so jude was telling them fight for the faith content for the faith then he said for they are certain men crept in unawares they sneak in who were before of all ordained his condemnation on godly men turning the grace of god into laziestness and denying the only lord jesus i will therefore put your remembrance though you once knew this how the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroy them that believe not the same god that bring them out is the same god punish them this is god to be talking about this is the pastor this and brother this an elder this and deaconess and usher there's no this is not that they're not trust in it this is god almighty could we give the lord a shout so take off your shirt's shoes and let's come into the word oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved for everlasting chains on the darkness and the judgment of the great day when god made the angel everybody happy everybody cool they worshipping god and make god god because god is object of worship lucifer all the music all the time that he was controlling his own service controlling the music the high cherubim oh what certainly your his heart to be like the most high all of a sudden all of a sudden this thing coming loose of a heart to be like the most high hallelujah i will ascend to the mount and that's how to whisper in some of them angels ears and some of them believe him hallelujah and start a war in heaven is this not the earth yet you know this war started in heaven what you're going through and the pressure you're going through is that here you know oh give the lord a shout in the house if they stop here you know this battle you are in today [Applause] they started in heaven [Applause] when he fell from his estate he became the devil but he was a mighty angel a singing cherub will be death everybody heals him out so much that he figured he wanted to be the boss boss and god had to show who's the real boss and all who playing boss boss god go show them who's the real boss oh give the lord a shout give the lord my god that's some that's the god we have as our king our lord mighty impact he's gonna fight your battles for you oh glory to god hallelujah god can give you a victory let's continue even as soon as gomorrah the city is about them and like men are giving them so what a fornication going after strange flesh i set forth an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire so how sodomites going to heaven yeah that's the god of their own thoughts and mine house are the mice making it when god judged at him anytime god sees me judging it and god will not repent if he didn't repent then he repented no fire god burned fire coming again and the bride will not be judged because you were judged when jesus was judged at calvary when the judgment struck jesus and he died at the cross you died in him oh glory to god when jesus died you died when he arose you arrows give the lord a shout out hallelujah hallelujah that's why you say by one spirit we are baptized into the body glory to god amen [Applause] [Music] even the son of gomorrah and the cities aboard them and like man are giving themselves a lot of fornication going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire likewise these filthy dreamers defy the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignitaries yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses does not bring against him a real acquisition he said lord rebuke but these speak evil of those things because they know

kind of foolish information i you say love charity believe in all things hope at all things you wouldn't even want your brother to be like that even if seems to have a hair report you're hoping all things you believe in all things you enjoyed all things you believe in the best for your brother not the worst but because of what is that your heart you expect something happened to bad yes people want this church to fail and fall are we still standing they curse it every single standing they laughed at me still standing the market be still standing because you see this is not my church i didn't build it jesus said upon this rock i will be my church and the gates of hell no demon insulin in that old trinidad international demon wherever they come from they can't stop what god has made i the lord started it and i will go finish it [Applause] glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] keep yourself in the love of god you have to preserve your have it somewhere here and proverbs about preserving your heart for automating the issues of life guard your heart that is the scripture for out of it comes the issues of life somebody says something i don't watch what they're saying you know because a demon behind that trying to get business inside of you i know because i had that experience as a young christian when people say things with people and that's coming to me and i have a bad attitude towards that person i heard about and that person did me nothing because words are seeds but before i come worse there's a thought that thought thought hit your mind so the devil come and toss hit your mind to give your seeds that you have in your heart and then you find your attitude negative towards people that you don't even know but you say god your heart when they come with their garbage they hold it you see they're backing up and they're going and pressing them hold it they want to offload the garbage and you can hold it take a dump truck somewhere else oh give the lord some praises all right so keep yourself in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pull them over the fire heating even the garments spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling oh god this song so sweet and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty and dominion and power now and forever amen so you say why are you deal with this one soul and deal with that one soul and have some of compassion and look up would be here and you watching on you're fine but they buy us no it's different strokes to different folks we will not reward bad behavior if you want to behave bad you have no reward for that yeah not bad behavior you have to have a heart for god but if you want to do right but abraham says i'm so glad tonight to tell you there's a city of refuge that's jesus christ if you don't want to do wrong the enemy is after you then there's a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ is a place where you could let off steam another thing when you're coming to this place while you are there you can't hang around everyday crime i'd like to get out i'll let it get out i'll let you have to be satisfied to be in that place of refuge you can't just want to get out i want a party i want to go out i want to smoke no no you have to be thankful and be grateful to god that you put a hedge around you [Applause] glory to god hallelujah do you believe that no matter what take place christ is our refuge and when we come to him we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if i die what is going to happen to me if you're thinking about that pressure what's going to happen to the wife what's going to happen to the husband oh good what's going on to the children just come into christ and let off the pressure you give us all things somebody might give you a million dollars it will build pressure you didn't think about that i know you can do with a million or you might have but guess what that million will bring some pressure you might join a church it will be a pressure because the methodists tell you they're right baptist is wrong they often say they're wrong you're right it brings a pressure cause you don't know where you're standing but when you're coming to christ it's settled down he's our refuge you are in this refuge you got a right to anything that's in the refuge and christ is our refuge when in sickness total pressure let off pressure let off pressure in the seat of refuge he took upon your worry you don't have to you don't have to have it cast your cares on him for he cared about you cared for you don't you worry about your cares that's his business oh glory to god hallelujah could we go a little further all right let's continue he's talking about her sister in the church i want you to listen carefully they go to church this woman she went into the church she done a very good job she was a piano player after a while she began to notice the woman in our neighborhood begin to dress immodestly how they get out and mow their layers with their little clothes on i hope there's none of them here tonight so disgrace to you sister god be merciful to your sinful soul what else could do that but an evil spirit full of lust you don't want to think that but that's exactly the only person that ever stripped their clothes off in the bag was a maniac put on clothes that and act like a lady now the first thing you know she taught you go get by with that because the rest of the woman in church was doing the same thing that's what i said don't judge people in church by other people in the church judge yourself by the word because that brother could be whatever condition you don't know but he doing it she doing it don't you do it listen she thought she would do it so she started to doing it that letter they began to smoke cigarettes so she thought she'd smoke cigarettes she continued playing there was nothing said too much about it around the church now remember i keep telling you the reason that a lot of things carrying a message because they haven't seen judgment yet i've got this scripture for that and that's eccles ecclesiastes 8. listen to this because sentenced against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully setting them to do evil do you see god have a time to do things he said the the cup of the amorous is not full the cup of iniquity when it's full then god sent judgment when is building up he just let it run so people do their own thing when the children of israel came out two million people you know rejoice him oh good without out pharaoh god so all in perishing except joshua killed him god knew they would fail but he pulled them out but in them had another generation as a seed in a in them had another generation that was going to be born that was going to go into the promised land because god has to keep his word he has to pull him and bring them into the land and this land that we have is the land of ephesians that the church must cross over into and the seven thunders is prophesied to bring us into that land where there is a perfect church where you are predestinating the uh adoption and that ephesians husbands love their wives and ephesians children obey their parents and ephesians is a fightful ministry in ephesians there's one lord one faith one baptism and ephesians we are no longer strangers but we are fellow citizens of the household of god oh glory to god in ephesians christ the head of the church all glory to god the mystery to connect the body together heading about that all that is in ephesians that's the land we have to go into not corrections not galatians ephesians that's the place that the faith is restored back to that's another ephesus that's the alpha bride oh glory to god that we the omega have to go back to and pick up what they had oh glory before going to the rapture we have to pick up what they had he sent a prophet to turn our ass back to the faith of the fathers but back to church back to the fate let me say that again not back to church back to the feet oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that do you see your heart being turned back to the faith i want you to see your heart being turned back [Music] [Applause] back to the fate of the fathers when peter was in prison and the believers were praying the doors open up angel of god came and opened and locked pete and released peter from that that is back to the fate oh god person can hold you back to the fate you have to come out and no you can't stay in the prison of sickness come on now you can't stay in the prison of sickness back to the fate of you coming under sickness coming under blindness coming out you're being restored that's what we're talking about back to the faith [Music] glory they will join church today live any kind of life or anything but i tell you one thing you can't be born again and live any kind of a life you would live for jesus christ when you are born again you would act like a man you will conduct yourself as a real christian if you are born again of the spirit of god so let's continue there's a purpose i'm reading this i want you to stick with me right with me so this woman finally she fell in love with a man and neighbor run off marry this man continue playing piano in the church after a while she left him and marry another one she taught us do she do all right finally she ended up with a common law wise what was it her soul told her in the beginning don't do that but she reasoned now if the rest of the woman can do this why can't i do it but don in her soul was a spirit that said don't do that keep away from that that's not right she fought against that cast that aside went to reasoning watch don't reason just believe god's word don't try to reason out just what god said is the truth and believe that to be the truth and don't go to your reasoning go to your experience to christ in the heart and compare it with god's word so she went on and after a while she was called or the pastor of a church was called to her bedside to pray for her she was laying there smoking cigarettes everything living in the house a common-law wife he said sister is everything all right with your soul to die she said everything is at peace no she believed it she had went listen she had went so long with her intellect until she had grieved the holy spirit from her it was it no more spoke to her she didn't know what was right she had reasoned it out she had a mental conception that if she went to church and did what was right she would go to heaven then went on down to the very oh of debt now this is the part i want to get to when her reasoning power and the prophet breaking yellow when you die your brain breaks up of course when the spirit leaves you and then what's left here's your soul that you neglected back there which comes to you then when you're dying and this mental reasoning breaks up you don't reason no more it's your soul that has been in your heart that you grieved away and it caught up with her and when she ditched you scream my god i am lost let me say this way to you so you are a triune being you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul that human spirit is given to you inside a deer is where you get reasoning memory conscience imagination so when somebody dies the human spirit breaks up in that human spirit is where you have your cxe your gc your degree your big house your big car you're a ceo you're a doctor you're a lawyer you're a pilot you're an engineer you're an aeronaut astronaut whatever it is all that position of power your president your prime minister all that is existing at the spirit level driving on mercedes-benz driving are rolls royce whatever all that is in that space there what people think they are how high they are how powerful they are how great they are how mighty they are how powerful the family is that's dear but in debt that spirit breaks up and your soul comes up and the soul is who you really are [Music] [Applause] so this woman intellectually she believes she's right when it breaks up her soul comes up she said my god i'm lost it's too late then the soul that has been grieved away don't let that be your state you mind god be born of the spirit of god quit reasoning things and believe what god said to be the truth be filled with god's spirit and then god would lead you and the holy spirit would lead you in the path of righteousness oh glory to god so you really want to be led by your the spirit not just coming to church for a blessing because you'll find yourself lost people are going to hell you know hell is not preaching this message but people go to hell [Music] what about says here someone come together and say brother branham do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing i said why do you question about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all then you know you're right should i do this should i do that should i do this what's the question and forget it kill it then don't do it and you're right now i am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of god that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed that means this little group of you people here tonight this could be one of the most powerful church that ever existed if we could get the soul thinking attitude perfect in the sight of god [Music] so lying is a deceitful and a hard thing so oh it's an evil thing i'd rather have a drunkard with me anything so you know liar lying at the bottom that way everybody said no liars in the kick number save your line stop the line get prayed for getting spirited liner for you all right but no matter how sinful you are you are still a fallen son of god the most sinful person you see today god didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you made up you are made in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate try to make a lie seem right they got a scientific instrument that proves it's still registered negative because there's a subconscious done in a human being and that subconscious knows what's the truth no matter what you are saying out here the subconscious know it's a lie and it registers of the subconscious therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so line up with god until the channel of the holy spirit will be so perfectly one with god what would take place if a man and woman could ever get lined up with the freedom from their heart with faith from the innermost faith from where the innermost the bible say i desire truth from the inward parts so god don't want to say god bless you and you don't mean it you're saying that because believers don't say them words but you really hate the person you don't like the person but you say that to give them a water hole let's continue are you with me anybody sleeping get some toothpick and put over your eyes and hold it up like this people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual faith aha they confess their sins join a church by intellectual fate they believe it in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but not what god looks at he don't look at your intellectual faith this one is a big one god looks at the the heart he looks on the heart where on the inside when it comes from the heart then all things are possible then oh so you mean really god want to really get what's inside of here yes it's better you say you're a crook and you're a liar and what not that god will respect that and love that god coming from inside of here then there's all kind of corruption inside of here and you're making hypocrisy i don't want to meet god as a hypocrite when the angel asks jacob what is your name i'm jacob i'm a deceiver i'm a con man i'm a trickster he could tell the angel the truth the woman of the world she said i have none he said you spoke the truth because you had four and the one you're living with is not yours that is what the pharisees and strategies did not have they didn't have the right kind of a heart and god is looking at the heart outside they're looking very religious and looking pious but in the heart crucify him crucify you see what come under the heart when jesus started walking crucify him crucify him and the ability their books their tapes crucify him crucify the manifestation of god for the hour they're coming back again you know oh then they find the man who was the word now they could find fault but the word working through the man once they come back to the world beginning to work watch them devils rise up to challenge it and define fault with it but give the lord some praises the bride oh glory the bread will be the word manifested give the lord a shout on that [Music] [Applause] all this bright dark and bright dark the bright could be the word manifested oh glory to god that is the bride word manifested why do you want to be foolish version of wise versions you want to be a stupid virgin or you want to be a smart virgin hallelujah wise virgin what the wise virgin want extra oil you are satisfied to be in church you want extra oil where the extra coming from put it in a tank creature put it in my tank the extra is the word coming inside of you and then god go take that word until the spirit ever reject the word they reject the spirit because the word and spirits are one no give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] well if you want the spirit you have to receive the word [Applause] and you can't go by feelings i am battling with this thing called high blood pressure you have a nice name for it they call hypertension and sometimes i'm feeling good feeling relaxed but when i put on the pressure to take my pressure and i see it so my eyes are open big zoom but i see i'll tell you about this because you cannot go about your feelings they call it the silent killer you're smiling you're laughing you're feeling good relax while you're talking and what that when you put that on now when you put that on your washing numbers you know you had to do something about that right i was saying that to tell you this you cannot go by your feelings this is the pressure checker right now we're wrapping it around your hand and dude i like pom-pom pump this is checking your pressure you have to check your life by what we appreciate this morning [Applause] don't feel you okay let the let the doctor tell you okay by taking the word and checking it with the word [Applause] because if you don't line up with this it will kill you [Applause] so every day i stick walks exercise take stick walks i know the bible says body exercise perfect little but we'll take whatever performance to drop some weight i have to drop some weight i have to do some stuff change my diet and everything else and i'm doing that right now very serious things i thought i couldn't stop eating stuff sign it off i'm getting desperate and it's showing dead serious i'm thinking to myself we have to get like that that's serious we have to do something about our own condition you have to get this serious if eating this thing will kill you your country isn't it you are fool if you want to go bye-bye but if you want to live cut it out because it will kill you and when you see sin run bolt jump cross the street don't say how long you're living there and what are you doing there no no don't talk to sin run for your life it will kill you oh get the lord some praises [Applause] he looks on the inside when your confession meets up with your life that's beautiful when your words meet up with your life you see you have to profess things first your faith follow and god back that up but one day you're expected to meet your subconscious and conscious line up everything line up perfect oh glory to god then god faith could drop down behind that and give you the answer that you need let's continue when your confession says one thing and your life leaves another thing that's wrong somewhere that's because you got an intellectual faith and not a faith from your heart and that shows that on the outside there is a knowledge of god but inside is a demon doubting i believe in ivan healing but it's not for me you see i believe god could heal me you know but you know i mean you know my family have that anytime especially family have that you have some condition you know i mean i believe god could heal me you know but you see my family my grandfather my great grandfather he had it anything he talked about he had it and she had it and they had it and all of them had it it's because you and your subconscious saying you know well i have to have it too you are disconnect from your family lineage and your condition in your family life diabetes the great grandfather the grandmother if that is come to the line who's it yours since when diabetes yours god donate that to you that's a gift so i'm saying if you're you have it that don't mean you have to claim it you're claiming have to be for healing you're claiming not to be deliverance you got claimed because grandpappy had it and grandfather had it and great grandfather you have it too and it's yours it's all that we own your family so kill that kill now tell yourself just change it with me and from this generation it's changing all together prophesy over that every day i'm thinking about one number 120 over 80 are thinking about it perfect pressure sometimes i think about it i see 157 or something my feet growing oh hallelujah but i believe in that i'll come back to normal i have to believe that i refuse to believe otherwise oh glory to god hallelujah you know what i'm enjoying i'm doing something about it i ain't just hoping i'm trusting no no no i'm doing something i'm watching everything that i've eaten everything that i do when i wash in everything watching them closely and that's how your life has to become you're watching everything closely once you've will never move but they're never moving we're never moving wait where do you want to come true glory to god you're watching everything you're god in your soul your god in your heart you're fighting for your life understand this the devil want to cut you off prematurely you know because he see the potentials inside of you he sees super church super racing all these promises and you don't even know what's locked up inside of you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god when god when abraham offered up isaac and and he stopped abraham he said and because you have done this thing in blessing i will bless thee and thy seed shall possess the devil heard that possess the case of the enemy the devil can identify the seas of abraham but here we are in the last days we are stepping forward as royalties of abraham to possess the case of the enemy to possess sickness to possess whatever [Music] to take the kids away [Applause] when your confession say is intellectual faith all right let's continue but this is in the trip report and now first is a thought he spoke a word and when jesus came out of the hill he said no man eater from these spoke a word went on and then watch god's mind that mind that in the beginning was what was the thought before it was expressed as a word what and every word in the bible is god's thoughts lean in seed form let me say it again every word in the bible is god's thoughts lean in seed form every word that means god can interpret any scripture in your life let me say it again this is important listen you could god could give you a scripture and interpret that scripture in your life personally to you that have nothing to do with anybody else [Applause] [Music] god could give you i am the lord thy god that he lady i heal you that is your word and you run with it and you heal all together just by your word from the lord god give you that scripture and you're healed [Music] [Applause] [Music] you can give your scripture i will not give you comfortness and give you a comfort in your heart and your spirit and you're comforted by the word of god let's continue every word in the bible is god's thoughts lean in seed form and if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the bible it brings the things to pass you see what i mean how powerful could the church be the bible said let this mind that was in christ being you allow it to be in you let it work through you claim it ask for it you want it you don't want your mind you want his mind and the bible give it permission to have it by the bible saying let this mind i was in christ oh glory to god i expect more amens than that it's saying let this mind i was in christ be in you you have a right to have the mind of christ nothing wrong for that nothing wrong in asking for that i want your mind in this matter i want your mind in the situation i want your mind [Applause] [Music] does a man think it oh good prophet as a man think it in his heart so is he so your thoughts become expression your thinking so your thinking literally have to do with the environment of your life and as a gardener tends to garden and clean up weeds and and award weeds is so you have to hold the weeds in your mind if you don't tend that garden the devil will put seeds you'll get all kind of crop inside your mind and you'll read a harvest of what's in your mind in your spirit you're going to speak it you're going to materialize you'll get the fruit of it but as a man taking his heart always here oh glory to god if you have evil thoughts either thing in your mind and you're taking old stuff you'll read the harvest of that because your mind like a garden not being clean not being cleansed not being channeled that's why the bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind oh glory to god that you might prove what is that good and acceptable will of god your mind have to be renewed if you could get a changed mind you could get a changed life if they could get a changed mind you could get a change walk if they get a changed mind you can get a change talk but some people don't want to change their mind because they love all they think they love what they say they love what they do they can't be taught it can't be spoken to hallelujah praise god hallelujah jesus they have faith in god for very nice unto you if you shall say to this monk then be moved cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart in your heart don't doubt that the doubt don't doubt where nothing ahead in your heart you can have what you say is that right not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church no here we go i know this morning that i was teaching there's a special service this morning i know it but i come to bring it now you can express this by mental conception by speaking the word and seeing this and seeing this but mental but if here we go kindly it becomes a real revelation of god you see it before it happens brother branham described abraham coming to the fullness of believing so after 25 years of testifying above her son elohim came known to tell abram i will return unto zee according to the time of life in other words your 25 years of testing is run out i come to give some encouragement i have come to give you my religion right now i come to tell you the time is upon you it's a time of life so abraham was comforted just like when jesus opened the understanding to his disciples opened the word his disciples and comforted them with the word and said receiving the holy ghost and then tell selem sorry in the city of jerusalem and till you be entered pour from on high as just as jesus released that to them they went up with joy the same jesus was taken up but they were happy they were not sad now because their thoughts have been cleared up their revelation has been sealed in their heart they know what they was going to receive so they had no doubt in the upper room they were expecting the power from on high not a man shaking their hand power from on high they were under tremendous expectation all glory to god and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were in one mind they were in one accord they were in one channel everybody in the same position oh god said so god said so they're encouraging one another with what the lord said oh give the lord some praises fire came upon every one of them everyone received their portion and i want every one of you today to receive your portion oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so watch if it becomes a real revelation then you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a whole and make it becomes material express and when your heart listen and your mind is so filled with god's spirit till your thoughts become his thoughts when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that is moving in your mortal being what kind of people ought we to be this is not coming the church and bowling about jacob and moses and israel no this is life

he's a liar she had a chance to live too but she want to follow him there's no revelation for your husband your husband he better be following god to follow him if he's not following god don't follow him stay with the world you know when the angel came down to solomon until lot and his wife and family come out you're sinful and you're wretched but come on come and be rescued and believe on them sodomites i'm filthy for fruits coming from among them just don't look back dance for everybody you know if lot had looked back into the salt you know the angel didn't tell see unlocked white mrs lord please don't look back he said is it here children before you leave how did you you're coming out afraid all your fire were burned next day people were on their way to work i see baby with pram pushing the prime mothers don't even know fire would not burn this is sodom they wicked the city wicked ten thousand people in that city and got about the church a whole city and the people they were sharply with novena with prayer clothes with small bibles pre-intermarry daddy chain daddy buddha thing that what kind of stuff occurs when people preach inside the road in salon i'm going to do it man wearing high heel shoes inside them man wearing dressing soda wig with lipstick on like big with whipstick on instagram big hard batman sissified man man dressing like woman in sodom angel come to get the elite because judgement can strike and kill the elect with them wretched sinners out there [Applause] good at the mix away somehow to get the electo and god call you out you have something to shout about if god call you out you have something to shout about [Music] [Applause] remember season [Music] simple instructions not come to search and get back in jesus name no it was not look forward don't look back keep walking see abraham let's see a lot walking white behind me between me and mrs lut you see what was in our heart you know what overture misses that her heart she know judgement going on strike she saw angelic activity to tell her it is that serious but yet in her heart she wanted one more look but hold up hold the container here undyne putting special colors in it she wanted to see one more look at the hot pants on a mini skirt and whatever it is the tattoos the neighbor outside ringing those mud air is all about she wanted one last look when she looked i like your daughters you know she turned mommy turned into a pillar of sword and the daughters was wise enough to know don't even look at that just keep walking then we're looking left or right mommy gone mommy gone mommy gone mommy reap what she saw mommy gone my heart over throw her lot in his children got out and jesus said remember lot's wife [Applause] this is not a game and this service is not a play service remember lot's wife oh glory to god hallelujah and the reason lot got that deliverance the only reason that got that breakthrough is because abraham was interceding before god not because god comforted latino because abraham because of who he was god said shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do because i cannot hide i cannot hide what i'm about to do from my elect that's why you should not forsake the assembling of yourself together because revelation gonna break from here that god will reveal his will and his mind all glory to god hallelujah when god removes saul he said i've found a man after my own heart that will do my will [Applause] so it's not a matter of man after my um a heart to do his will do you have the kind of heart that you're willing to do god's will whatever god tell you to do you want to do it you're interested into it you want you out of the way a shy that's you that's not god i never do that before that's you that's not god what you want is his will [Music] as soon as samuel anointed david the bible said the spirit of god came upon him he was anointed in the presence of his brethren all of them were witnesses of the oil upon david and david went back to his sheep anointed with god anointed with the spirit oh glory to god he wasn't in yet but he was anointed to be king and the bible said god has made us kings and priests [Music] and we shall reign on the earth and you want to tell me i can preach i can shout at this this morning when i know that he has made us thus it is his will it is his purpose it is his mind that we be kings and priests [Applause] all the potentials lock up inside of you my god [Applause] prophecy afraid to check where i reach i believe it's on its road when the church will be so wrapped in christ the holy spirit mankind show away from themselves that they don't see themselves but to serve god their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of christ then the love of christ in the human heart moving in the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by by by the holy spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind and the prophet said the ministry has reached its perfection when christ is revealed again among human beings in the natural [Applause] in other words the word has to become flesh again [Applause] and when the word becomes flesh the invisible becomes visible god help me this morning [Applause] let me say it again [Music] god was invisible until the word becomes flesh and when the word become flesh the invisible becomes visible god becomes material so god wants to get dead man he want to get man out of the way oh glory to god and god will remove all fleshly souls of the kingdom you're going to bomb them off knock them off he's going to take them off and you're going to raise up some davids my lord this is too much today when you come so dead to the things of the world that christ is first christ is all then your entire makeup is of the spirit of the lord jesus he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your torch will be pure your heart some people say well religion comes from the heart he said there is no mental faculties called heart you can't think with your heart babies as a man taking his heart and he said jesus wasn't speaking of the physical being he was speaking of the supernatural being we are truthful being soul body spirit we know that this what is flesh is we realize that it's here we know what the spirit it is the spirit control the flesh but what is the soul he said the soul is the nature of the spirit so born again means you need a change a new life oh hallelujah if you notice here we go the subconscious is where you live not at the conscious level your real you is subconscious that's where you live that's the reason people say it's hard for them to have faith yes i got faith but don yeah it's saying not for you well this fellow say i believe god heals and subconsciously but it's not for you you see are you sure you're not going anywhere you're running a circle because the mind saying something but the spirit says something else the nine saying i believe but the hearts saying have affect to go next week so there's a problem going on you know this is right but this is of the mental here they already had a gc and you see xc and the doctor degree everything right here so then earlier you know god put something inside of here to taste for god some people replace that taste for god with women with money with popularity with basketball football cricket with with love for this and love for that they love animals they put it to us for god they love to climb they climb in mount everest to climb in here some politics politician god for parachuting and jumping from the sky all about they give them a trailer some people like stephen so they're going to stay in the city some people like to see they can't wait every day they feel like they really fish or something but they're not in church but sunday morning there by the sea the devil twists their minds god god put that twist inside idea let me continue you say watch they don't think of something they're thinking about healing it's not their intellect here working it is subconscious working your subconscious is your soul so the subconscious is the real you so watch when it lines up like i say i make a reference you and your wife having a quarrel inside and you know it's not going very nice and somebody knock on the door or ring the doorbell and you open it on your smile god bless no what going on there now is that not the real thing you know there's a piece of acting going on there's a hollywood there's a there's a movie going on right now so when the calling going on instead of getting that right and and and correct and everything else we go outside and say we can like olive oil is well but all not very well the emotion all is well but he had said god i just get thundering saturday boy and when you smile here's no you're going back to the battlefield right back to where left off but the subconscious is your soul hallelujah [Music] the soul attracts what it secretly harbors that is why but imam says what your fear happened and what you believe happen see if the soul have the fear it attracts that life life wakes up that if the soul have the faith it just push away everything else it's from the soul from the subconscious level the mind have to change your thinking have to change you have to want to get out of moxie mode mode and and the excuse mode you have to want to come up with that and stop looking that you don't have the resources you don't have this stop looking at what you don't have question what do you have five thousand people to feed five loaves two fishes what do you have jesus took the five loaves two fishes bless it share it stop looking at what you don't have say lord give me fresh eyes to view what's around me what i have [Applause] think differently you just we shouldn't please i want to kind of wrap up here so what you say happens what you believe happens every thought soul that goes into the mind will have a root would have a fruit i will i can i do believe do you not believe you have to believe isn't that right glory to god so therefore truly circumstances doesn't make the man it shows what the man is people have so much excuses about life this is why i saw my grandfather my grandmother the neighbor teachers didn't like me in school that why i didn't learn no no no that's an excuse you didn't want to learn just as a weak man where training could become strong but discipline could exercise and get muscles and everything else just so a weak mind could be trained to become strong the birds may rest on your head and bring thoughts but don't let them unless there don't be so weak for them to build a badness in your head with a certain negative thoughts that you can't override and that's why hollywood is so dangerous even for the children you have to be careful with hollywood because what can i say tannics and all kind of people writing movies and hollywood is a channel to get thoughts in people's mind and so are the songs and people have these things stick up in the air listen to songs all day and they have messages in the songs it have seats going through the songs the devil using any means necessary when you come to churches or two hours what time is that when you leave here they develop in your night and day 24 7. you're not getting this all the time you know that's why you have the resources on the internet to go into the channel and look back on youtube at the messages to listen back to things they didn't hear talk back over that your mind be saturated with the word of god then when they're saturated like that the devil have no room to move because you're a genuine believer glory to god so your mind could be cultivated columbus i believe he could sail the world and he did it everybody who had great achievement they believed it could be done the wright brothers believed they could fly they're tired of your horse and buggy and of course when they try to fly the first thing crash it always does your first attempt at righteousness will crash but it always does but that does stop you from pressing on you keep on pressing on when the wright brothers tried to fly people laugh at them but guess what we have airplanes now because somebody believed it could be done hallelujah in that flambo and limelight and somebody believe they get electric light and they press until they get that all leukemia and typhoid fever all the doctors that believe they could cut a cure for that they did it because they believe it before it happened they believe it [Music] let me say that before it happened they believe it could be done like i understand they got a cure for ebola somebody have to believe it could be done somebody believe they could go beyond plane and go up past the atmosphere into the astronaut age and they got out of people i believe we could go beyond churchianity be done beyond methodist and baptism pentecostal beyond that into the realm of the manifestations of the sons of god you have to want that a perfect church with jesus walking in it glory to god hallelujah so as a man thing so is he and as he continues to think so he if remains think i can't make it you can't make it you think you're going to fail you will fail if you think you'll go you'll go but if i think you're going to overcome you will overcome hallelujah glory to god you know what make a difference in this world ideas men with ideas hallelujah the car was an idea the vision was an idea the iphone and all these phones and technology was an idea somebody had and they make it materialize you have to have an idea idea of perfection idea of the perfect man idea of righteousness or ida overcoming i either been a son of god i have been a prince with power with god you have to have something bigger than you more powerful than him [Music] elijah talking to elijah stay here for the lord call me across he says the lord levitt i am not staying here you are the prophet yes i know but what i have in my heart our next brother hear that and said the prophet told me to stay right here and i am moving i'll stay here for the last 50 years because that prophet told me to stay here both hear the same word the bible said israel heard the word but the word wasn't mixed with faith so everybody could be hearing it but it's those who have faith to mix that word to bring it alive hallelujah that subconscious or just going quickly is where the fate lies that subconscious is where your faith really lies what must i do for my family say brother branham i want to receive the holy ghost i want to know what to do i am burdened for my family to be saved sister sign the name are you burdened he said what must i do for my family use the same feet that you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the lord and believe it with all your heart that you are going to be saved don't let it come down from your natural thinking here let it drop from inside that subconscious then they are yours so when do your faith for your family drop from your subconscious then they're yours god give them to you when you've got it down here oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that no watch my lord could you take a little more i want to ask permission to take a little more because i feel in the middle of something here and i could hardly drop off here now on my way watch watch the biggest part of our fate is mental fate by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god but if it ever strikes from by the holy spirit it becomes a a spiritual faith hallelujah do you believe that glory to god in the beginning was the word so watch when the holy spirit comes down then the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental fate become the spirit of revelation and that become the rock so you're not coming to church because your father coming on your mother coming because you have a revelation now that's why you're coming you're worshiping because you have a revelation you're not looking to see who is in the hand who is in the hand or she is raised behind too no no you're raising your hand because you want to raise your hand you stand up because you want to stand up it has nothing to do with the person in front of you at the side of you you have your revelation oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that says the holy spirit made the ephesus church but the smyrna church the holy spirit gives the pokemon church all is the holy spirit it's been the holy spirit in this age and watch from your faith and then when the capstone comes the holy spirit seizes together so watch number one number one coming from your mental fate tongue comes the holy spirit into your mental faith and makes it a spiritual fate hallelujah then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word amen hallelujah do you believe that praise the name of the lord the spiritual faith only recognizes the word praise god i know i had something here to share with you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god hebrews 10 26 says if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of truth there remain no more sacrifice for sin now the power i want to get here is the knowledge of the truth so the knowledge of the truth is not the truth yet until you get the spirit of the truth [Music] i want to get that in today you have to get the knowledge of the truth seven seal knowledge seven thunder knowledge mystery knowledge knowledge of the bible it's not of the truth but when the spirit of truth comes that is the true knowledge because the knowledge could just opt to be all intellectual but when the spirit of truth come you have revelation you have an experience not just truth but the spirit of truth and jesus said when he the spirit of jesus come he would lead you and guide you into all truth which is a continuation of the knowledge of truth oh get the lord give the lord a shout hallelujah because now you are empowered by the spirit of truth to guide you into all truth no longer intellectual thing it's a personal revelation of god oh hallelujah praise god thank you lord thank you lord deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things that are revealed belonging to us and to our children forever that we might do all the works of the lord oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah so from your faith up to the holy spirit look at here faith up to the holy spirit that seals you in with christ then you become one watch then that's a sealed unit of the lord god then they are vindicated and placed when that time comes they become vindicated sons and daughters of god right now you are sons and daughters but when that time comes you become a vindicated son vindicate the daughter of god the same devil that was busted back there he will get busted again this time because now we're not just our son is a vindicated son finnick is the daughter of god oh glory to god ain't no stopping us now oh glory to god we're going back to eden hallelujah hallelujah praise god oh almost done david was the poorest excuse there was he said stoop shoulder piece of sheep skin rock or wrong him he didn't have one of these big intellectual degrees well trained saul was the best he could have had high header shoulders above the rest of the army so was a tall guy and today we know we need a revival we know we need a steward among the people it will not take a doctor with divinity it will take weakness it will take it will take a weak person that will take the word of god in the power of the resurrection he said it will take we need a david untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little boy somewhere somewhere stupid shoulders nothing much to look at but will come along with the power of god god is not in big words god isn't on his heart he said i am the high and lofty one that dwell with him i have a humble heart out of a contrite spirit it takes a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ in the present tense oh god i'm finished [Music] hallelujah god looks at the heart people tend to judge you by your car by your house by your children by your degrees by what your education is not right by your dress by your unique ability and gifts but god has the ability to see inside the person's heart so when elijah came in front of samuel the prophet and he said surely that is god anointed god said no no no not too fast not so fast don't look at the outward appearance because i'm looking at the heart that gave samuel a bit of discernment to see for the quickening power to give witness of the man that was passing before him and brother after brother pass until samuel said isn't there any more hallelujah god don't look at how tall he oh my he said i don't see us he doesn't see us human see oh david was god's choice hallelujah and david develop a heart after god he says the heart pant after the water brook so my soul tastes after the living god hallelujah begin to praise something softly proverbs 4 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life what can be done with this sport does one play that he's going to play that look at that he was going to play that same thing [Music] i'm done [Music] what can be done with this heart like mine please soften it up [Music] with the oil and the wine do [Music] please wash me on you with [Music] is you is your spare breath of love please wash me a near my lord with the way of your love oh lord one more time what can be done with this whole heart like we suffered [Music] [Music] of is please wash me on you my lord will do wine up just worship the lord as the music plays [Music] me [Music] wash me anew yes yes [Music] what can be done with [Music] [Music] [Music] share that love with somebody and greet somebody in jesus name
