[12:30] This Day to this year to see what we see
[12:33] and hear what we have heard and we are
[12:35] grateful father that you send this enti
[12:38] message that we can hear your voice I
[12:41] know that you're speaking through us to
[12:42] us through your word bless each one here
[12:45] tonight that will be listening on those
[12:48] that would hear it later on Father be
[12:50] with them in a special way we are such a
[12:52] need people and we confess that be an
[12:55] need of you gr it Lord in Jesus name we
[12:57] ask it amen and amen
[12:59] God bless you and welcome thanks for
[13:02] being
[13:04] here tonight uh for this prayer meeting
[13:07] and uh what a week we had uh we had put
[13:11] up uh but Andrew's um things pertain a
[13:15] life and godliness he didn't want to go
[13:16] up but I felt it was something uh
[13:19] helpful and um it will edify you the
[13:22] science of favor when you have God's
[13:25] favor it shows and you find favor you
[13:29] get access to key persons and the reason
[13:32] that they are key persons is because
[13:34] they have keys don't waste time with
[13:36] your critics and haters who have no keys
[13:39] that's so powerful very encouraging
[13:42] Joseph as an example man finding favor
[13:45] and you know how the brothers felt about
[13:47] it but I want to read two scriptures in
[13:49] that regard Luke 1:30 says and the angel
[13:51] said unto her SP Mary fear not Mary but
[13:55] th was found favor with God and Luke 2
[13:59] 52 and this is a powerful scripture Luke
[14:03] 252 says and Jesus increased in wisdom
[14:06] and sture and in favor with God and man
[14:12] and brother Anthony Wednesday night what
[14:14] a powerful was a masterpiece power
[14:16] belonged unto God and he said that faith
[14:19] is a hack to your operating system God
[14:23] by passing your senses to power you up
[14:26] and darkness is the absence of light is
[14:29] because the sons of God are out of
[14:31] position God can restore back the
[14:35] factory settings or manufactur theault I
[14:38] say it this way like we had in the
[14:40] Garden of Eden that is what happened to
[14:41] about brandham he was restored to
[14:43] theault setting of sunship before the
[14:46] four was such a so much nugget inside
[14:48] the day was such a blessing and God did
[14:51] not fight with Darkness or argue with
[14:52] Darkness he just called for the light
[14:54] let there be light so that's a really a
[14:56] blessing on on Wednesday night
[14:59] and I was tremendously
[15:02] blessed so but aie was talking about the
[15:05] reference to like a cell phone and it
[15:07] have uh different things dear that you
[15:10] may not be aware of but when a need
[15:12] arises if there's issues you could get
[15:15] it reset reset and I trust tonight that
[15:18] God help us that if there are issues
[15:20] that we could get reset get aligned
[15:22] correctly tonight so in getting down
[15:25] into prayer the devil wants to mess up
[15:28] with this signals so you don't get a
[15:31] connection Daniel was praying in the
[15:33] real of the spirit Angel got delayed
[15:35] because of the battle which spirit is
[15:37] trying to hinder the answer from coming
[15:40] true but Ram said This Way Daniel has
[15:42] stop praying the angel have to stop
[15:44] coming so Daniel prayer was actually
[15:47] activating things in the realm of the
[15:49] spirit and so would we tonight and
[15:52] crying out unto God sometime you just
[15:54] have to change the position I
[15:56] experienced it you're going to country
[15:57] area there may be a static space there
[15:59] may be a a blank spot may not have a
[16:01] cell tower you can't get a connection
[16:03] you can't get through until you change
[16:05] your position sometimes it's a company
[16:07] you keep affecting things from coming
[16:09] through like Abraham and lot when lot
[16:12] separate from Abraham the connection
[16:14] come through lot look Abraham look east
[16:16] west north and south all this yours
[16:18] tonight I have two scripture I like to
[16:20] read from Genesis 114 and Amos 33 two
[16:24] scriptures genesis4 says and God said
[16:26] let there be light in the firment of of
[16:29] the heaven to divide the day from the
[16:31] night let them be for signs and for
[16:35] seasons and for days and years and Amos
[16:40] 37 says can two work together except it
[16:43] be
[16:44] agreed at tonight I have one word let to
[16:47] share for this perent
[16:49] alignment one word alignment alignment
[16:53] refers to the proper
[16:55] position or adjustment of parts
[16:59] in relation to each other so you can't
[17:02] really align to yourself you have to
[17:05] align to someone or something it can
[17:08] also mean arrangement in a straight line
[17:12] or being arranged in a line or in proper
[17:18] position so when God set the Stars up
[17:22] the lights in the filament he said them
[17:24] for times seasons and so on like that
[17:28] and but talk
[17:30] about uh the cloud that came down 19 20
[17:35] uh February 1963 we say February 28th
[17:39] and today is February 28th and tonight
[17:42] there say seven planets align on
[17:45] February 20 which is tonight time where
[17:49] to watch what you need to
[17:51] know Mercury will join Mars Jupiter
[17:54] Uranus Neptune Venus and Saturn in the
[17:58] nights sky in a phenomenon that will not
[18:01] be seen again till
[18:03] 2014 so to me this is very significant
[18:07] because here is what brother Bram says
[18:09] in 1962 the 19th of March he said tree
[18:13] is the number of perfection we all know
[18:14] that tree is number is numerology God is
[18:18] known by numbers Tre is perfection seven
[18:20] worship 24 is worship 40 is Temptation
[18:23] 50 is Pentecost Jubilee all these
[18:26] numbers is numerous God is perfected and
[18:28] perfect three is a number Perfection and
[18:31] we know uh seven is completion he said
[18:34] now we know God is perfected in three
[18:36] grace is five seven is completion like
[18:38] the world seven is
[18:41] completion he said eight is the first
[18:45] day again he said now what happened we
[18:48] see the roar in the paper host
[18:49] newspapers and so on he said what taking
[18:52] place five stars fell in what was it
[18:55] introducing of what this 962 since then
[18:59] look what took place Germany almost wash
[19:00] off the map he says England the other
[19:03] day a storm that Blown Away 70,000
[19:05] houses in one day disasters he says Los
[19:08] Angeles like to wash into the ocean what
[19:10] is it the beginning of Storrow
[19:12] earthquakes has begin to pick up
[19:14] everywhere why what is it five stars
[19:16] come in line God's grace what happened
[19:20] an infant Church a
[19:22] bride
[19:24] infancy that the power of God has begin
[19:27] to fall on her she's taken form a bride
[19:31] for his bridegroom and so on so in
[19:34] 1962 the prophet
[19:37] identify that this bride by a sign of
[19:41] five stars aligning itself together was
[19:43] a bride in its
[19:45] infancy well 2025 is a long ways from
[19:51] 1962 the question tonight is these Seven
[19:54] Stars that align itself what does that
[19:57] mean but the church for the bride for
[20:00] the revelation of the word what does
[20:01] that mean is it that the bride now is
[20:04] mature coming into rightness because at
[20:08] some point in time we must come into
[20:12] maturity that's what rightness is about
[20:14] when the fruit comes to full
[20:18] maturity it means that it no longer have
[20:20] to grow
[20:21] anymore in other words the plant put
[20:24] forth his flower his bird his flower
[20:27] then come the fruit the food is green
[20:30] then it gets bigger then afterwards it
[20:32] doesn't grow anymore it
[20:35] stops and then something happens it
[20:37] begins to ripe and the sun
[20:41] light helps to accelerate that
[20:44] ripness and the growth is no longer
[20:47] there's no need to grow because the
[20:49] frood has reached its maturity it's a
[20:51] ripening it's a bacon out of the
[20:54] greenness it's a bacon out of the
[20:55] foolishness it's a bacon out like how
[20:57] the scripture says in Corinthians when I
[20:58] was a child I speak like a child on as a
[21:00] child when I became a man I put away
[21:03] childish things I write unto you
[21:04] children I write to you young men I
[21:06] write your fathers the object is to get
[21:08] to fatherhood the object is to get to
[21:10] maturity the object is to get us to a
[21:12] position where we are aligned with the
[21:15] word and with the
[21:17] spirit not just with the word but with
[21:20] the spirit same as how the prophet said
[21:24] we have to get into the unity of the
[21:26] spirit until we come to the unity of the
[21:28] faith
[21:29] men love argument men love
[21:32] debate men love to know that they have
[21:35] words that they could beat down somebody
[21:37] else and ridicule somebody else and uh
[21:42] make laughter and criticize somebody
[21:44] else but all of that will come to a
[21:46] close because the manifestation will be
[21:49] the interpretation God have allowed men
[21:52] and are talking about men a spirit of
[21:55] man um with all his glory and power with
[21:58] all in numbers and church power and
[22:00] people power and influence power and
[22:02] whatever power they think they have but
[22:05] all of that must come to an end because
[22:06] it's man is
[22:08] human but Anthony kept it off last night
[22:11] power belonged to God this power that
[22:14] belongs to God God himself in his
[22:17] sovereignity will allocate that power or
[22:21] give that power out for
[22:23] example uh look what God Said to Brown
[22:27] he says you have been given power to
[22:29] bind a m but be more sincere now that is
[22:34] God zooming in on the prophet's heart
[22:37] mind and spirit that's not physical that
[22:40] sincerity is calling for it's not a
[22:41] natural thing it's not like getting a
[22:43] brand new car and the car is dirty wash
[22:44] it down this is something internal this
[22:46] is something human other human other
[22:49] fellow ministers preachers they can't
[22:51] see that they can't speak that they
[22:53] can't talk that this is the god this is
[22:56] the omnipotent all powerful God that
[22:59] knows the end from the beginning that
[23:01] knows when the fly B its eye that God
[23:04] that same God is what could go the
[23:07] manufacturer then the the the producer
[23:09] of this being called man when he looks
[23:12] into the the stream the consciousness of
[23:14] the man he recognized there something
[23:16] need to be sharpened something need to
[23:19] be
[23:19] hounded this same God is who tap him by
[23:23] a bar behind his shoulder and tell him I
[23:26] forgive you and look you condemn her
[23:29] talking about the woman he was
[23:29] condemning that same God did that that
[23:32] same God is who give him options of
[23:34] power if you say die they will die if
[23:36] you said blind will blind and everything
[23:37] else to see what the sun will do so we
[23:41] know it I've preaching it so many times
[23:43] you are tested before power tested with
[23:45] power tested to see what you going power
[23:48] man is corrupt who can know it but God
[23:51] the heart of man is desperate to corrup
[23:53] you see if you want to see what in
[23:55] somebody give them power give them money
[23:57] put them in some power position see how
[23:59] they manage that we have seen it over
[24:01] and over without character without the
[24:05] metal without What It Takes and that's
[24:07] why we have to go through stuff to get
[24:10] that that metal out of it the fire the
[24:13] burning the how they say it gold tried
[24:17] with fire the fire
[24:19] to as talk about beaten out until you
[24:23] could see the reflection so if the
[24:25] reflection is not being seen is mean
[24:27] then stuff still started here and God
[24:29] have to keep working on this so I trust
[24:31] tonight that these few things that we
[24:34] sharing tonight would help to realize
[24:36] that God want us to align you know I
[24:40] here it's something called the S PG
[24:43] skill and you know it D do it's just s
[24:47] and afterwards it go back to one just
[24:49] like seven days and 7 go Sunday go back
[24:52] to Saturday and then the next day is
[24:54] back to Sunday again the e8th day is
[24:56] back to the first day do
[25:00] that octave goes back to see so the
[25:04] original church that sat the Pentecost
[25:07] we have to come back to that it went
[25:08] through processes doti do it comes right
[25:12] back to that door and that do mean same
[25:14] signs same wonders same Miracles but
[25:18] brand them now he said the other Angels
[25:21] was men of the Earth but this Angel the
[25:23] one that come down he said didn't come
[25:25] from the earth he come from Heaven
[25:27] because the miss Myster is all finished
[25:29] and when the mystery is finished the
[25:31] angel said time shall be no more and
[25:33] seven Thunders throw their voices out
[25:35] what if it is something to let us know
[25:39] how to enter into Rapture in fate is it
[25:42] will we run and leap over walls is just
[25:45] something fixing to happen and these old
[25:48] mad VI bodies are going to be changed
[25:51] can I lift a see it oh Lord is it so
[25:53] close that I'll see it in this
[25:55] generation still is my brethren what
[25:57] time is it where we at then he said this
[26:00] here it might be closer than you think
[26:02] it is it got me scared I haven't done
[26:05] enough where are we at time shall be no
[26:08] more he announces that time is over what
[26:11] happens what happens could that be son
[26:13] Brethren seriously think if it is then
[26:17] the pyramid is kep by the seven thund
[26:21] this is such a powerful thing if it is
[26:24] the pyramid is cut by the seven Thunders
[26:27] then he went down this route you
[26:29] remember the P message it's a Capstone
[26:32] what did it do the Holy Spirit capped
[26:34] off the individual and sealed it when we
[26:36] added to our faith righteousness and
[26:39] godliness and faith and so forth kept
[26:41] adding till we got seven things the
[26:44] seventh one was love so he's saying to
[26:47] our faith we add seven things the
[26:51] seventh one is love which is God that is
[26:55] how he makes the individual and it caps
[26:58] him and seals him with the Holy Spirit
[27:01] then if that be so here's what this
[27:04] person got he's got seven Church agents
[27:06] that he's had seven Mysteries that been
[27:09] sounded away and they fought for to
[27:11] bring back and now the headstone comes
[27:13] to cap off the church does the Thunders
[27:16] mean that my brethren Sayes where we at
[27:21] he identified the seven Thunders seven
[27:22] voices he identified the seven thund
[27:24] seven seals he identified the seven
[27:25] thund seven Mysteries he identifi the
[27:28] the seven lights and go on and on and on
[27:30] what do you want him to be tonight he's
[27:32] the I am he could be a lawyer could be a
[27:34] Healer baptizer people don't want to
[27:37] connect with each others with the
[27:38] virtues at all they they angry upset
[27:40] they wanted to be just Mysteries alone
[27:42] but he said more than just that these
[27:44] divinely reveal mystery truth and like
[27:46] to say the seven Thunders seven voices
[27:48] revealing the hidden mysteries of R 10 3
[27:50] and 4 it reveal every mystery who
[27:52] reveals the mystery but Christ who is
[27:54] Christ Christ is the Holy Ghost all
[27:56] seven virtues Christ is that so it's two
[27:59] things what the Thunders is and what the
[28:01] Thunders does it's not the same thing
[28:03] let me repeat it again tonight what the
[28:05] Thunders is what the seven Thunders does
[28:08] if that be so then the seven Thunders
[28:11] Capt the perit why am I saying that
[28:13] tonight why because there's seven stars
[28:15] up there align
[28:18] itself there's an alignment going on
[28:20] tonight there some people don't like to
[28:21] align by anything they're so in love
[28:23] with theel they just parade the beef
[28:25] they do their own thing you tell them do
[28:27] it so so they don't want to follow in
[28:29] line you have problems and you will have
[28:32] continue to have problems if you don't
[28:33] want to line up like what alignment
[28:35] means alignment means it's a set pattern
[28:39] it's an order it's a structure God have
[28:42] things set a certain way God doesn't do
[28:45] random things he doesn't just you know
[28:47] get a say a lapse and just how to do no
[28:49] no no things are set that's why they
[28:52] could predict when the next uh uh uh sat
[28:56] uh thing will be comet or whatever thing
[28:58] in the stars because God have it set a
[29:00] certain way the only people out of
[29:02] alignment is man his sons and that is
[29:07] why there's so much Darkness because the
[29:09] alignment we we have to come into
[29:11] alignment God here Judah here Ephraim
[29:16] here so who God Called to raise oats
[29:19] should raise oats who God Called to
[29:22] raise a sheep supposed to what whatever
[29:24] it is and to stay in position we have
[29:27] not yet matured into that too much
[29:30] jealousy envy and Petty foolishness that
[29:32] why men keep running believing that if
[29:34] they out your candle their light will
[29:36] shine bright which is foolishness that
[29:38] is what caus men to be that what Joseph
[29:40] Joseph just a quote the a
[29:43] quote a rainbow quat and his brothers
[29:47] get a fight that was once in a fight
[29:48] when he start to give them dreams now
[29:50] the fight he's get optimized the heat of
[29:53] the fight get higher they are jealous
[29:57] they're angry and they come to
[29:58] conclusion you know what just get rid of
[30:00] this problem that's what the mistake
[30:03] that they made or how sometimes God uses
[30:07] or allowed to be used these issues of
[30:10] life and these challenges of life to put
[30:12] you into your place and your destiny so
[30:15] they didn't even know that by rejecting
[30:18] Joseph by rejecting him and selling him
[30:21] out they were actually send him into his
[30:23] Destiny and Paul Joseph he had a
[30:25] terrible time but eventually he he grew
[30:28] he matured he ripened and he understood
[30:31] to the point that he could tell them and
[30:33] say this way God send me ahead of you to
[30:37] preserve life he didn't say you you all
[30:41] Wicked he didn't say you all sold me out
[30:44] he knew the higher purpose and sometimes
[30:47] I ask the question what will it take for
[30:49] you for the people to see the higher
[30:52] purpose why do you grel in the human in
[30:56] the natural as if the battle is flesh
[30:58] and blood why do you think that is this
[31:01] one and that one and this and that and
[31:03] you have all the accus in the world why
[31:05] and when are you going to see this
[31:07] battle is not flesh and blood it's not
[31:10] human it's the Battle of angels have
[31:13] become the Battle of men and we are
[31:15] caught up in between hell trying to pull
[31:16] you down Heaven trying to pull you up
[31:19] and we are caught up in between the
[31:20] Angels already came down put a sign in
[31:22] the sky and he throw the Thunders in the
[31:24] sky that's what this is about throw the
[31:26] Thunders in the sky to tell us there's
[31:28] something we could look up to we could
[31:30] look up to this Capstone we could look
[31:32] up the Dynamics we could look up to this
[31:34] Glory we could look up to this power we
[31:36] can look up because our Redemption draw
[31:38] it now we have something we can look up
[31:39] to and this power belongs to God this
[31:42] power belong to some Pastor or some man
[31:44] or some Apostle man or Prophet man or
[31:46] teacher man or evangelist man this power
[31:48] don't belong to them they they they have
[31:50] that to hand out and and I'll show you
[31:53] why I'm going to
[31:54] close uh let's get to this here now but
[31:58] he's talking about his a Shepherd dream
[32:00] here and he said now five streams coming
[32:02] down and it's the holy spirit that bed
[32:05] this span Church the holy spirit that
[32:07] give the pamos church the Titar Church
[32:09] in Dark Ages is the holy spirit that
[32:11] built that bride the elect that is
[32:15] pulled out of all organization system to
[32:18] the I want you to think the elect is
[32:21] never a group The elect are individuals
[32:25] okay so the holy spirit in program was
[32:27] right now there's an elected a
[32:30] predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that
[32:32] the Holy Spirit has called out the elect
[32:35] it's been the Holy Ghost in This age
[32:36] that age that age on up down up to the
[32:39] Holy Spirit now this is what he saying
[32:40] now as I wrap up
[32:42] here and now as in the
[32:46] individuals these virtues and things
[32:50] knowledge and Temperance is added to Our
[32:52] Fate then when the Capstone comes the
[32:57] whole Holy Spirit cemented together
[33:00] there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:03] that is why so short today he said now
[33:05] coming from the Holy Spirit what is come
[33:08] then he will give you Supernatural Faith
[33:11] spiritual Faith at the bottom now that
[33:13] spiritual Fai recognizes only the word
[33:15] no matter what anybody else says it
[33:18] don't do no good that only knows the
[33:20] word if somebody says this a miracle is
[33:21] past that Faith only knows the word and
[33:24] number one coming into your mental Faith
[33:27] Comes the Holy Spirit into your mental
[33:29] faith and makes it a spiritual faith
[33:32] that recognizes only the word number two
[33:35] three then you'll have spiritual faith
[33:38] and you'll have the Holy Spirit that
[33:40] will seal all these things into you as
[33:44] the Holy Spirit covers this then listen
[33:46] to this from your faith up to the Holy
[33:49] Spirit and so in other words he's
[33:51] talking from Faith virtue knowledge
[33:52] Temperance until that slot called Holy
[33:54] Spirit from your faith up to the Holy
[33:57] Spirit seals you with with with Christ
[34:00] then you become
[34:02] one you become one you and Christ become
[34:06] one and Christ live together at that day
[34:09] so he's quoting in John 1420 now you
[34:11] will know I'm in the Father the father
[34:14] in me I in you you in me and that's a
[34:17] sealed unit of the Lord God now and when
[34:20] and then they are Vindicated and placed
[34:23] and when that time takes place they
[34:26] become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of
[34:29] God not
[34:32] before but when that time takes place
[34:35] they become that I'm
[34:37] closing three scriptures Psalms 19
[34:40] 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[34:46] a light unto my part that is when the
[34:50] word begin to get the pinenes in your
[34:53] life the word itself becomes your lamp
[34:57] Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this
[35:01] world but be transformed by the renewing
[35:04] of your mind that you may prove what is
[35:08] that good and acceptable and perfect
[35:10] well of God and the last one Matthew
[35:14] 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of
[35:17] God and his righteousness and all these
[35:20] things shall be added unto
[35:23] you you aligning with God's plan you
[35:26] aligning with God God's will you
[35:29] aligning with God's purpose God want the
[35:32] word to be a lamp God want your mind to
[35:35] be
[35:36] transformed because he want you to know
[35:39] his will and God want you to seek first
[35:43] the kingdom I close with these words
[35:45] that I started off with
[35:47] alignment refers to the proper
[35:51] positioning or adjustment of parts in
[35:55] relation to each other it can also mean
[35:59] arrangement in a straight line or being
[36:02] arranged in a line on in a proper
[36:06] position when God asks
[36:09] Ezekiel can these bones
[36:12] live and the Bible talk about bone come
[36:15] to
[36:17] Bone the neck bone car go down to the
[36:20] foot
[36:21] bone the backbone can't go to the neck
[36:24] you know in other words it has to line
[36:27] up
[36:28] so the knee bone have to go to the
[36:30] hipbone and the hipbone everything have
[36:32] to line up and then the prophecy for the
[36:36] Flesh and the skin and then the breath
[36:41] friends we have to line up with God's
[36:44] word and we have to line up with each
[36:46] other let's bow
[36:48] ahead Heavenly Father we thank you for
[36:52] you said that there will be a fivefold
[36:54] Ministry for the Perfection of the
[36:56] Saints for the work of the ministry
[36:58] till we all come to the unity of the
[37:00] faith to the knowledge of the Son of God
[37:03] that we don't be no more children tossed
[37:05] to and through but each joint supplying
[37:09] Lord therefore there must be connections
[37:13] to get
[37:14] supplied we as a human being you who
[37:19] made us so wonderful and fearfully we
[37:21] were fearfully and wonderful made made
[37:24] you put everything in position the ears
[37:27] where it's supposed to to be the eyes
[37:28] the mouth and we don't want anything to
[37:32] get out of alignment or get out of order
[37:35] we want to stay whole we want to stay
[37:37] sober and sound this is a natural body
[37:40] what about the spiritual body and
[37:43] people talking
[37:45] negative instead of talking positive and
[37:48] I pray and Trust then that the words
[37:50] that you spoke through but Anthony about
[37:52] how Darkness was addressed you didn't
[37:55] even speak to Darkness but you just say
[37:58] you call for light and darkness have to
[38:00] scatter when light comes forward and
[38:03] light is the word made manifest father
[38:07] God I pray tonight as your people get
[38:09] down in prayer may your spirit come upon
[38:13] them speak to them anoint them Quicken
[38:17] them Inspire them may this prayer prayer
[38:20] supplication come upon them may they
[38:22] know tonight that even though there's
[38:25] rry there's the carnival Atmos and
[38:27] people in the spirit of what's Happening
[38:30] Now aside apart from that up in the sky
[38:35] the lights that you said will be here
[38:37] for
[38:38] Saints God is speaking something and the
[38:42] other scripture we read how can two walk
[38:44] together L they are agreed there must be
[38:48] an agreement there must be a partnership
[38:51] there must be an alignment that we could
[38:53] truly work together but we know
[38:56] according to your word there there's
[38:57] going to be a Unity of the faith nothing
[38:59] will stop that not what any Pastor or
[39:02] minister or church or whoever think
[39:05] whatever they are there's going to be a
[39:08] Unity of De Fai that is what you send
[39:10] the prophet to do to restore heart back
[39:12] to the faith of the fathers there's only
[39:14] one fate it's not 10 it's not 20 it's
[39:17] not 15 Lord have different doctrines and
[39:19] interpretations but there's only one
[39:21] fate even there's one Lord and even
[39:23] there's one baptism Bless the people
[39:25] tonight as they get on in prayer Ines
[39:27] name I ask it amen and amen so friends I
[39:31] trust that these words would help you
[39:34] and that you would seek God to align
[39:38] with his word I like what brother Andrew
[39:40] shared about favor because in favor you
[39:44] have to be seeking God for God's favor
[39:48] and if you're really looking for God's
[39:49] favor why you have to worry about who
[39:52] think what shake that off seek to please
[39:56] God to favor with God and he will make a
[39:59] way for you so God bless you as we get
[40:01] down in prayer tonight praise the Lord
