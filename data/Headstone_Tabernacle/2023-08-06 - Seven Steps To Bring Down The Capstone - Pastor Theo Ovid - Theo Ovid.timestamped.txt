[53:26] with Seven Seals I saw a strong angel
[53:28] came with a loud voice who is worthy to
[53:31] open the book or to lose the C is
[53:33] thereof a new man in Heaven Nor an earth
[53:35] neither under the Earth was able to open
[53:37] the book needed to look

[53:49] Judah
[53:52] the root of David had revealed to open

[53:56] thereof and I beheld on low in the midst
[53:58] of the throne and of the four beasts in
[54:00] the midst of the eldest of the lamb as
[54:03] it had been slain having seven horns and
[54:05] seven eyes which are the seventh spirits
[54:07] of God sent forth into all the Earth
[54:10] and he came and took the book out of the
[54:12] right hand of him and sat upon the

[54:49] elders a number of them was Ten Thousand
[54:52] Times Ten Thousand and thousands of
[54:53] thousands saying with the Lord voice

[55:53] Heard a Voice from Heaven said unto me
[55:54] seal up those things which the seventh
[55:57] and assaulted and write them not and the

[1:15:10] this but the blood still covers he came
[1:15:13] to redeem the elected he foresaw oh God

[1:15:28] to redeem his people he done the same
[1:15:30] what God has done to redeem this world
[1:15:32] he done the same plan through them as
[1:15:34] people
[1:15:35] so when the Earth was baptized with
[1:15:37] water in Noah's day it was baptized what
[1:15:40] was he doing Redeeming the it when Jesus

[1:20:49] house hearing what we are preaching this
[1:20:51] morning oh glory to God so when I bring
[1:20:53] it back to what the prophet says you

[1:21:04] nature it's not putting all our new
[1:21:06] garment
[1:21:07] foreign
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:11] like hell
[1:21:13] Hallelujah nutrients are changing you
[1:21:16] basic company same dress every Sunday
[1:21:18] and say God change my nature
[1:21:22] you know if they tell somebody there's a
[1:21:24] fighting
[1:21:26] because people see me boy I've read I
[1:21:28] see him just last week before but
[1:21:31] let them talk about you where the same
[1:21:33] dress tell them you have come to address
[1:21:34] the company Holy Ghost forget the Lord
[1:21:37] some Praises Hallelujah
[1:21:40] so watch let's go when you ask for
[1:21:42] forgiveness of sins watch but the thing
[1:21:44] that made you do is still dear the old
[1:21:46] root of evil it's still there and then
[1:21:48] you repent to get baptized in the name
[1:21:50] of Jesus Christ and he forgive you of
[1:21:51] your sins and secondly comes
[1:21:53] sanctification which sets our mind in
[1:21:56] order for holiness
[1:21:58] watch sanification is a compound Greek
[1:22:00] word means clean and set aside for
[1:22:03] service it is not in service yet but
[1:22:05] it's set aside
[1:22:08] next Comes This is the prophet now the
[1:22:10] baptism of fire and holy ghost that God
[1:22:13] might dwell in US and the fire of God
[1:22:17] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[1:22:20] the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:22:22] who said that
[1:22:24] the prophet said that the word said that
[1:22:26] the fire of God cleanses our hearts he
[1:22:30] has no Mysteries no histories no
[1:22:31] Revelations no man of God that they are
[1:22:33] and who and the church in a special
[1:22:36] Church Your Privilege should be here
[1:22:37] because it's right that's a lie
[1:22:40] the privilege to be among three kind of
[1:22:43] believers
[1:22:47] say we just had to manage the ratio of
[1:22:49] the unbelievable to the True Believers
[1:22:51] we can't afford the unbeliever they make
[1:22:53] believer to overtake the Believers so we
[1:22:55] want to believe us to shout and praise
[1:22:57] God and worship God and and join the
[1:23:00] Heavenly chorus that's what we want we
[1:23:02] want that
[1:23:03] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[1:23:06] God hallelujah
[1:23:07] all right next come the baptism of the
[1:23:10] fire and holy ghost at God by dwell in
[1:23:13] us and the fire of God cleanses our
[1:23:15] hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost
[1:23:17] Inside then we bring forth the same life
[1:23:19] notice sanification sets the mind and
[1:23:22] heart in order of Holiness a man can
[1:23:25] repent of his sins and a immoral man and
[1:23:28] an immoral looking woman he finds he's a
[1:23:30] drunkard every time he smells the drink
[1:23:31] it is still there but when he gets
[1:23:33] Sanctified that cleanses the desire out
[1:23:36] of him
[1:23:43] oh praise God so God take this the
[1:23:45] desire of it out isn't that right he can
[1:23:48] still be tempted but it takes the want
[1:23:50] of it away he is not right yet
[1:23:53] then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] on Fire cleansed hear the word burnt out
[1:23:59] cleaned up and then put into the service
[1:24:02] of God or could you give the Lord a
[1:24:04] shout in the house to sanification only
[1:24:07] sets aside for service it's not right no
[1:24:10] he called the church to justification
[1:24:16] and he took it to a process that he
[1:24:19] himself
[1:24:20] the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God
[1:24:24] could dwell in the human heart it has to
[1:24:27] go through that before he can come into
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:31] so he's talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] itself and the Pentecostal wrapped up
[1:24:35] the baptism or the bird but to the birds
[1:24:38] Hunter at the life the Pentecostal
[1:24:40] rejected the word from the prophet so
[1:24:42] they couldn't add on the life to go on
[1:24:44] to adoption
[1:24:46] Oh Glory to God they couldn't get the
[1:24:48] seven steps to go on to charity Oh Glory
[1:24:51] the God is not right hallelujah praise
[1:24:54] God praise God praise God so Christ all
[1:24:58] right I'll just get that down now now
[1:24:59] watch
[1:25:01] so I was skipping and the same power
[1:25:03] Redemption is used to redeem both the
[1:25:05] world and the person that live in it so
[1:25:08] do you understand what Redemption is
[1:25:10] Redemption is these virtues coming and
[1:25:12] you and I God first redeeming your soul
[1:25:14] by the Holy Ghost with him in a spirit
[1:25:16] seven spirits coming into you and then
[1:25:19] afterwards is just the body to change
[1:25:21] waiting for that body change oh
[1:25:24] Hallelujah isn't that right but Obama
[1:25:26] said it must be baptized in water in his
[1:25:28] name the shoe it belongs to it must be
[1:25:30] cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then
[1:25:33] the Holy Fire the holy ghost from God
[1:25:36] comes down and burns out all the desire
[1:25:40] of sin all the nature of the world out
[1:25:43] of us so do you see now that if it
[1:25:47] doesn't take the operation of God then
[1:25:48] we don't need the spirit
[1:25:51] we don't need to be in church
[1:25:53] because just meditating good talk takes
[1:25:55] positive thoughts and you know I mean be
[1:25:57] nice and be like the rich homie then you
[1:25:59] know I mean he's a good Master what
[1:26:00] should I do to inherit his own life good
[1:26:03] man nice brother nice tires some fella
[1:26:05] hunting and Jesus Bible Jesus loved him
[1:26:07] and when Jesus gone inside the beginning
[1:26:10] of the bone and the marrow and inside
[1:26:11] the soul you see the money demon inside
[1:26:13] of there
[1:26:17] he said he didn't have the spirit of
[1:26:18] forgiveness
[1:26:19] you see neighbor hungry and poor not
[1:26:21] helping them he said if you want to I'll
[1:26:24] be telling like you have to

[1:27:17] Hallelujah let's continue here now all
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:21] so this is what you heard last Sunday
[1:27:23] from in his presence and this is where
[1:27:25] this all this sort of boot into me to
[1:27:28] share this morning
[1:27:29] but Obama was speaking he said here I
[1:27:32] will announce he said um
[1:27:35] he said the next time when we start the
[1:27:36] Seven Seas of Revelation on the seven
[1:27:38] natural seals and when we get through in
[1:27:40] time take the Seven Seas on the back of
[1:27:42] the book
[1:27:43] that may take a little time there's
[1:27:45] seven seats that is open and there's
[1:27:47] seven plague seven trumpets all these
[1:27:49] sevens and them scenes we could take
[1:27:51] first but then on the back of the book
[1:27:53] is seated with Seven Seals Daniel heard
[1:27:55] the voices the Thunders was forbidden to
[1:27:57] write John was forbidden to write it was
[1:28:00] sealed on the backs of the book that is
[1:28:03] after all the mysteries of the book has
[1:28:06] been given out unrevealed you notice
[1:28:09] Daniel said the Mysteries and the day of
[1:28:11] these voices the mystery of God will be
[1:28:13] a fooling at that time the mystery of
[1:28:15] who God is how he has made flesh all
[1:28:18] these things should be unfolded by that
[1:28:19] time then we are ready for the seven
[1:28:22] scenes on the back side of the book
[1:28:25] so he was actually pointing to specific
[1:28:27] that these seals on the back side of the
[1:28:29] book we have to get there
[1:28:35] that's not even reading the revealed a
[1:28:37] man of the Bible spirit and full and due
[1:28:38] season for the brother
[1:28:41] well this just
[1:28:45] beautiful in juices listen to these
[1:28:47] words
[1:28:49] but in Paul I wanted to get this one up
[1:28:51] from spiritual food into season

[1:29:06] he said here
[1:29:08] then back there at the beginning
[1:29:10] of the Seven Seals
[1:29:12] then those seven angels come down in
[1:29:15] that pyramid form
[1:29:16] stood there and told me to return back
[1:29:19] and speak on those Seven Seals now this
[1:29:21] is the 18th of July 1965.
[1:29:25] he said then he'll be with me
[1:29:27] he showed me what they were the lost
[1:29:29] things
[1:29:30] and this is the part I want to get to
[1:29:32] I've always taught
[1:29:35] it was sealed on the back of the book
[1:29:39] and it wasn't something that was wrote
[1:29:41] In the book
[1:29:42] but it turned out
[1:29:45] that it was made known he cannot do that
[1:29:49] it isn't something that's written in the
[1:29:51] book it is something that's been hid in
[1:29:55] the book
[1:29:56] Oh Glory to God because the book or take
[1:30:00] away from the book said carry outside of

[1:30:06] could get all right let's see if we get
[1:30:07] it here all right look at the obvious

[1:30:12] back of the book and it is something
[1:30:14] that wasn't wrote In the book but it
[1:30:17] turned out that it was made known he
[1:30:20] cannot do that it isn't something that's

[1:30:25] that's hidden in the book talk about the

[1:36:21] spirit
[1:36:23] I mean on their own in that sense you
[1:36:25] have to be praying for them
[1:36:27] John was filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:36:29] his womb
[1:36:30] when when Mary hello John and say his
[1:36:32] name Shall be Called Jesus John John
[1:36:34] John

[1:36:37] six months but when when he heard that
[1:36:39] name Jesus that done in in Elizabeth
[1:36:42] and jump about because he had to come in
[1:36:45] for around the Messiah
[1:36:46] and brother was giving a message to

[1:36:58] in this
[1:36:59] [Applause]
[1:37:04] this is real
[1:37:06] if your name was in the book in heaven
[1:37:08] is still up there but no the angel
[1:37:09] brought it down and he gave it to the
[1:37:11] mighty Angel he gave it to the seventh
[1:37:13] angel version 10 said he gave it to his
[1:37:15] prophet and the prophet put it on books
[1:37:17] and tapes and leave a faithful Ministry
[1:37:19] to come behind to speak the word that
[1:37:22] you can hear your name and when you hear
[1:37:24] your name you get your breakthrough you
[1:37:26] get your deliverance you see what you
[1:37:28] call unto
[1:37:33] glory to God
[1:37:35] Glory

[1:37:39] you may be seated
[1:37:41] where is until it says what praise God
[1:37:44] praise God praise God

[1:37:48] hear from Heaven speak unto me again and
[1:37:50] said go and take the little book which
[1:37:53] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:37:55] standeth upon the sea upon the land
[1:37:57] New York or London go Europe go Africa
[1:38:01] go Trinidad what is a man say that it's
[1:38:04] a go to the angel

[1:38:07] is that angel on the earth trying to get
[1:38:11] the people back to the world
[1:38:12] because God could only confirm the word
[1:38:14] God had confirming me God forming the
[1:38:17] word
[1:38:20] and if you have the word and you will
[1:38:22] confirm you because the word is in you
[1:38:28] so the battle and the fight has been to
[1:38:31] get the word into the people
[1:38:33] not interpretation not an idea but the
[1:38:35] water tapes see so you have to know your
[1:38:37] promises isn't that right
[1:38:39] and I went to the angel and said give me
[1:38:41] a little book he said me take it eat it
[1:38:43] up it shall make thy belly bitter it
[1:38:45] shall be thy mouth sweet as honey sweet
[1:38:47] Revelation bitter when you have to stand

[1:39:01] book out of the Angel's hand eat it up
[1:39:03] and it was an emulated honey and as soon
[1:39:06] as I have eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:39:07] he said unto me down was prophesy again
[1:39:10] before many nations and Nations and
[1:39:12] tongues and people and came and that's
[1:39:13] what we're doing here right now again
[1:39:16] Hallelujah bringing the same Prophecy
[1:39:18] from the prophet and prophesying our
[1:39:21] Revival prophesying about Dynamics in
[1:39:23] the mechanics prophesying about the Holy
[1:39:25] Ghost itself prophesying our young

[1:39:31] prophesying Holy Ghost speaking direct
[1:39:33] prophesying about healing and signs and
[1:39:35] wonders prophesy Mark 16 John 14 12 the

[1:39:41] all these prophecies hanging over you

[1:39:45] and Devils as you walk to the front door
[1:39:46] devil's head into the back door okay the
[1:39:48] Lord some prayer do you believe that
[1:39:50] do you believe that when you go to a
[1:39:53] house as you walk to the front door
[1:39:54] never sit in the back door
[1:39:56] Oh Glory to God because then devils and
[1:39:58] conquer the spirit before
[1:39:59] all I know go Hallelujah glory to God
[1:40:04] the anointing that was upon Paul you're
[1:40:06] knocking away from Peter the anointing
[1:40:08] now upon the early church but me back in
[1:40:09] this church I'm Alpha and Omega same
[1:40:12] fire same power same anointing
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:19] let's go
[1:40:24] remember Daniel was told by the angel
[1:40:26] Daniel who the seven Thunders they
[1:40:28] uttered the voices Daniel grabbed his
[1:40:30] pen started right and he said don't
[1:40:32] write it don't write it John saw the
[1:40:34] same thing it was already written
[1:40:36] outside the Bible and had seven seasons
[1:40:38] in the back of the book and no man could
[1:40:39] open those seals that was them voices
[1:40:43] so he called the season the backup book
[1:40:45] of the book them voices here is the
[1:40:48] Bible written which is a mystery itself
[1:40:50] but on the back
[1:40:52] s the Bible
[1:40:53] the Revelation was shown to Daniel
[1:40:57] instances to be uttered that no man
[1:41:00] could open no man known what it was but
[1:41:03] the Bible said and I told Daniel also
[1:41:05] John in the last days here we go these
[1:41:07] seven voices would be known by the real
[1:41:11] true church
[1:41:12] not before church let them be not made
[1:41:15] they believe in church the real church
[1:41:17] will be known what them seven voices is
[1:41:19] those seven voices will be known to the
[1:41:22] real Church isn't it baram says in this
[1:41:25] last day these seven voices would be
[1:41:27] known by the real true church you get it
[1:41:30] can you see where the force and
[1:41:32] conquerque is trying to keep great men
[1:41:34] from places like that
[1:41:36] message
[1:41:39] these voices isn't that right
[1:41:42] so Malachi 4 Revelation 10 was centered
[1:41:44] for around the coming of Christ and
[1:41:46] Christ coming came in White version 10.
[1:41:48] one the mighty angel
[1:41:50] so Christ's message is found in Russian
[1:41:52] 10 1 4. seven Thunders came out his
[1:41:55] mouth brother George Hallelujah to do
[1:41:57] what if God has to write together it
[1:41:59] gives the bright fate it shows the right
[1:42:01] to be pure it is the price Revival they
[1:42:03] have nothing with church now there's the
[1:42:05] bride I'm not on my trailer no I'm
[1:42:07] talking about this Universal bright body
[1:42:08] I'm not going by the church now a
[1:42:10] physical church now I'm talking about
[1:42:12] the bride the body of Christ around the
[1:42:14] world that's what Christ come for every
[1:42:17] name on that book
[1:42:19] is to be redeemed
[1:42:20] or give the Lord some praises
[1:42:23] Hallelujah
[1:42:24] let's go brother
[1:42:26] I'm starting your perfect man you say
[1:42:29] first we have faith virtue knowledge
[1:42:30] Temperance patience godliness bloody
[1:42:32] love birthday kindness then add love
[1:42:34] let me read this over again to make sure
[1:42:36] we're going to start in the fifth verse
[1:42:38] so you read giving all diligence and
[1:42:39] something like that now Peter is
[1:42:41] outlining something here for us how to
[1:42:43] get there
[1:42:44] I want to say this
[1:42:46] are you ready
[1:42:47] are you ready
[1:42:49] there are some people who have a portion
[1:42:52] of this virtue
[1:42:53] knowledge
[1:42:55] wisdom patience and so forth that don't
[1:42:58] even profess to be a Christian
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:03] so these are natural virtues
[1:43:06] I have nice Muslim
[1:43:09] nice Methodist
[1:43:11] nice people out there they don't even go
[1:43:13] to church and they better behave than
[1:43:15] people in church
[1:43:17] I'm not going there just highlighting
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:21] I'm not going there like there's too
[1:43:23] much to go there I go down that road
[1:43:24] I'll be giving us out of there
[1:43:27] nice people with patience
[1:43:31] they could wait long
[1:43:33] of Jesus Christ
[1:43:36] they have control they have Temperance
[1:43:38] let us meditate let's do yoga
[1:43:41] but that is not the temperance of Jesus
[1:43:43] right Oh Glory to God there's Faith they
[1:43:46] are Faith they expecting this they
[1:43:47] believe in this and they believe in
[1:43:48] death and all kind of thing but they're
[1:43:50] not the fate of

[1:51:05] then she told herself if I perish I
[1:51:09] perish but I'm mounting them seven steps
[1:51:11] I'm calling the president of the king

[1:52:10] to bring down the Capstone

[1:52:14] what for to bring on the resurrection we
[1:52:17] can't call the Resurrection on the
[1:52:18] brotherly kindness it has to be the
[1:52:20] Capstone has to be divorced with dark
[1:52:22] angel you have to be the Lord himself in
[1:52:24] a bride isn't that right call back the
[1:52:27] seven steps to bring back
[1:52:30] is this the sign of the answer
[1:52:33] he said could it be that Mighty Thunder
[1:52:36] or the seventh angel and the Seven
[1:52:37] consolation
[1:52:38] the pyramid form three on one side one
[1:52:40] at the top they drop from eternity
[1:52:43] is this here we go let's take it slow is
[1:52:46] this the mystery of the Thunders
[1:52:48] that will bring back the headstone
[1:52:51] you mean the Thunders of a mystery
[1:52:54] they're gonna bring back the headstone
[1:52:56] because the pyramids never capped
[1:53:00] you know the premieres never was kept
[1:53:02] The Headstone is yet
[1:53:05] to be The Headstone is
[1:53:07] yet to come it has been rejected
[1:53:10] let's continue
[1:53:12] he said it might be closer than you
[1:53:14] think
[1:53:15] it's got me scared I haven't done enough
[1:53:17] where are we at
[1:53:19] time shall be no more he announced that
[1:53:21] time is over what happens what happens
[1:53:22] could that be so no Brethren see as you
[1:53:24] think if it is then the pyramid is kept
[1:53:28] by the seven tunnel
[1:53:30] so he put the Capstone as seven Thunders
[1:53:33] which is the holy spirit slot
[1:53:35] Captain those virtues or glory to God
[1:53:38] hallelujah do you understand that
[1:53:40] that
[1:53:43] [Applause]
[1:53:45] to cut them Seven Virtues walk in the
[1:53:48] Lord a house shout in the house
[1:53:50] in other words the pride of God becomes
[1:53:54] the word
[1:53:56] and the spirit
[1:53:57] comes upon the bride
[1:53:59] gives the bride a voice
[1:54:01] the spirit and the price had come
[1:54:04] oh give the Lord a shout your family
[1:54:06] coming your loved ones coming God will
[1:54:09] give you that voice the problem of the
[1:54:11] final voice to the final Age The Spirit
[1:54:14] Will Mock The Pride
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:23] so this spirit
[1:54:25] this second Bible
[1:54:27] is not kept by teachings
[1:54:30] Revelations Mysteries he says he says
[1:54:33] seriously if it is then the pyramid is
[1:54:36] kept by the seven Thunders
[1:54:39] then he said you remember the prayer
[1:54:40] message it's a Capstone what did it do
[1:54:43] the Holy Spirit capped off the
[1:54:46] individual not cap of a church they have
[1:54:49] no capital of no church
[1:54:51] kept coming to individuals shout out
[1:54:54] individuals say it again individuals
[1:54:57] say that can individuals
[1:54:59] that means individual will praise God
[1:55:01] individuals will worship God indivisible
[1:55:03] join the Heavenly chorus individual of
[1:55:05] lamb worship individuals would give God
[1:55:08] praise in the good times and the bad
[1:55:10] times individuals gonna do that
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:16] he said what the Holy Spirit kept up the
[1:55:18] individual and sealed it
[1:55:20] and we keep adding to our faith
[1:55:22] righteousness and goodness and faith and
[1:55:23] so forth we kept adding until we got
[1:55:25] seven things
[1:55:27] the seventh one was love
[1:55:29] which is God
[1:55:31] that is how we mix the individual and it
[1:55:34] caps him and seals him with the Holy
[1:55:38] Spirit
[1:55:38] so why it is you don't see love in the
[1:55:40] message and it's even crutches and Alton
[1:55:43] this pastor clanging so the next past
[1:55:44] and treats right into it what kind of
[1:55:46] nastiness and foolishness because that
[1:55:47] is not there
[1:55:49] because the Holy Spirit can be hearing
[1:55:50] one man and misbehaving another man okay
[1:55:53] the Lord I shout like did you hear that
[1:55:54] the Holy Ghost can behave in one man and
[1:55:57] misbehave in one another man the Holy
[1:56:00] Ghost God is his behavior
[1:56:02] the character of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:56:04] behavior it shows whether it's the holy
[1:56:06] ghost or not
[1:56:08] are you already know
[1:56:09] what the seven one was love which is God
[1:56:11] that's how we mix the individual caps
[1:56:14] him and seals him with the Holy Spirit
[1:56:15] then if that be so
[1:56:18] the individual now has seven churches
[1:56:20] that he had seven Mysteries that the
[1:56:22] song away and they fought for to bring
[1:56:24] back I know the headstone comes the cap
[1:56:26] of the church does the Thunders mean
[1:56:28] that my bedroom
[1:56:29] and every Minnesotan Pastor all over the
[1:56:31] will have to answer that question and we
[1:56:33] see a big fat yes
[1:56:35] it means just that seven steps to bring
[1:56:39] down the Capstone to cap the individual
[1:56:41] when we add it to our faith virtue and
[1:56:44] knowledge and Temperance and patience
[1:56:46] and calmness and partly kindness and the
[1:56:48] love of God
[1:56:49] and then child he sees the whole
[1:56:51] building and then you are sealed unit of
[1:56:53] the love of God
[1:56:55] no leaks
[1:56:57] [Applause]
[1:56:59] the Bible called charity the bond of
[1:57:02] perfectness
[1:57:02] [Applause]
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:05] the glue that glued on all the virtues
[1:57:08] and sealed in
[1:57:10] outside our charity you'll be
[1:57:11] contemporance the leaking patience
[1:57:13] somebody again your Vex all your
[1:57:15] patients run out
[1:57:20] you lick your temper and say holy of
[1:57:22] temperance pipe at Birth
[1:57:25] you know if I was doing things that
[1:57:27] you're not supposed to do for your
[1:57:28] Temperance because your heart
[1:57:29] temperature will last me last weekend he
[1:57:32] said leaks in the building
[1:57:35] leaking godliness leak but when charity
[1:57:39] comes it seal the whole thing you see
[1:57:42] when God gave out and God gave Noah the
[1:57:45] revelation of the actability act it was
[1:57:46] soft wood the critics outside laughing
[1:57:49] because what kind of word is that that
[1:57:50] goes that that will absorb and Float but
[1:57:53] God wait for the last minute to break a
[1:57:56] seven seed Revelation to put

[1:58:02] know that wood will absorb the pitch
[1:58:04] absorb the tar and it will be sealed on
[1:58:07] the inside and the outside I will make
[1:58:09] it waterproof they didn't expect that
[1:58:12] Revelation to come and the devil didn't
[1:58:14] expect this Revelation to come because
[1:58:16] them Seven Virtues when it's sealed by

[2:00:12] the reason
[2:00:15] what the world in this traditional
[2:00:18] that's the reason hasn't got any effect
[2:00:20] there is nothing will come out of it
[2:00:22] because it's been mixed up
[2:00:23] you listen this one now
[2:00:25] you can't put genuine coin in something
[2:00:28] let's say
[2:00:30] it won't grow
[2:00:31] you can lay it in the sun keep it warm
[2:00:33] you can do what you want to it takes a
[2:00:35] certain kind of hurt it must be there
[2:00:37] double corn it must be buried it must be
[2:00:41] under the right atmosphere to make it
[2:00:43] bring forth
[2:00:44] here we go now so does the word of God
[2:00:47] you can't take a church and bring it to
[2:00:50] life on some tradition
[2:00:51] you might bring members by the millions
[2:00:53] but you will never bring down the power
[2:00:56] of God
[2:00:57] until you get back to the original world
[2:00:59] again
[2:01:01] back to the foundational word back to
[2:01:04] the blood
[2:01:05] but they don't talk about blessing
[2:01:06] message at all like this blood is blood
[2:01:08] Jesus and the blood is the weird and
[2:01:09] important right
[2:01:12] back to the blood
[2:01:14] back to Jesus Christ
[2:01:16] back to old-fashioned permittance
[2:01:18] back to God
[2:01:20] Hallelujah
[2:01:21] glory to God what he's talking about you
[2:01:25] you cannot bring the power of God down
[2:01:26] on Traditions interpretations men's idea
[2:01:29] that is how I know all man's effect can
[2:01:32] influence going to run out
[2:01:34] every Minister that is of the word of
[2:01:36] God going to be exposed
[2:01:38] every church that is not taken word by
[2:01:41] word and bringing them promises one day
[2:01:42] we'll wake up and find out they dry as a
[2:01:44] biscuit and they've been looking for the
[2:01:45] Holy Ghost
[2:01:47] because that Cafe challenges the hour
[2:01:49] the angel know what he spoke to that
[2:01:50] prophet and they are not even
[2:01:52] comfortable that spoke to the angel
[2:01:54] whatever God spoke to that Prophet is
[2:01:56] Spirit spoken word or Spirit given words
[2:01:59] that's why I have been zealous all these
[2:02:01] years to bring this word by word by word
[2:02:03] by word that you will know what the tape
[2:02:05] say and when you read it in the book you
[2:02:07] know what you have heard you know what
[2:02:08] you read it's right here in the book
[2:02:11] listen to this piece
[2:02:14] when the Holy Spirit begins to move
[2:02:17] and to give discernment
[2:02:20] that is to bring the presence of God
[2:02:22] Among the people
[2:02:25] objective of the discernment
[2:02:28] just like singing A Hymn
[2:02:31] shouting
[2:02:33] a message give me in unknown tongues or
[2:02:35] something it brings
[2:02:37] the spirit of God Among the people
[2:02:40] you heard your pastor preach plenty of
[2:02:42] time on the word until the spirit got
[2:02:43] among the people and they just screamed
[2:02:45] out they could not hold their peace any
[2:02:47] longer because it's the spirit of God
[2:02:50] so God bring gifts and talents and so on
[2:02:53] to bring the spirit
[2:02:55] when they say you're saying a specialist
[2:02:56] not like us inspiration or like a like a
[2:02:59] song a song sting of sort like a gospel
[2:03:01] concert
[2:03:02] the object is to bring the spirit
[2:03:05] and not just a sin
[2:03:07] is to get the spirit moving
[2:03:10] like how the prophet said he loved the
[2:03:11] song only believe all things are
[2:03:13] possible and when they start to sing
[2:03:15] that song The Angel come into the
[2:03:16] building he's attracted to that
[2:03:18] their spirit is attracted to certain
[2:03:20] things it's not attracted to argument
[2:03:24] about the foolishness that can't bring
[2:03:26] the spirit of God you want the spirit in
[2:03:28] your house you have to create the
[2:03:29] atmosphere for that
[2:03:35] let's go
[2:03:36] about a George had sentences to me this
[2:03:39] was in his presence he said what you're
[2:03:42] talking about Modi one of them guys was
[2:03:43] preaching he preached the government in
[2:03:45] such a way he stood in Boston
[2:03:46] Massachusetts in a little bit window
[2:03:48] because there was no church could hold
[2:03:49] his crown he stood there with a mighty
[2:03:51] Force preach hell such a place until
[2:03:52] working man in the baskets under the
[2:03:54] arms fell into the street and screamed
[2:03:56] for mercy in the presence of God great
[2:03:58] preachers
[2:04:00] who have been able by the word of God to
[2:04:03] bring the presence of God to an audience
[2:04:08] by the word
[2:04:10] to bring present
[2:04:11] the objective of the world is not for
[2:04:13] you to see how smart the preacher is
[2:04:15] that's why Paul said I did not come with
[2:04:17] you with words of enticing man's Wisdom
[2:04:19] because your figure arrested me because
[2:04:22] you see but I come that your faith and
[2:04:24] rest in the power of God
[2:04:26] that's a realize not my might not my
[2:04:28] spirit is the power of God that is
[2:04:30] ministering to you do you get it now
[2:04:32] there was something
[2:04:34] he's a five yet that man would ever be
[2:04:36] so shared in their hearts till they
[2:04:38] never recognize the presence of God
[2:04:40] he said the first man as soon as he has
[2:04:42] sinned he couldn't come into God's
[2:04:44] presence he went on high in the bush we
[2:04:45] know what Adam right and he would not
[2:04:47] come out and could not come out until
[2:04:50] appropriation for him
[2:04:52] now usually before God gets ready to do
[2:04:55] something
[2:04:56] I should say before he does anything he
[2:04:58] always make it understood or gives a
[2:05:01] warning or gives a witness of something
[2:05:03] he's fixing to do God meets in the
[2:05:05] Council of man one time with 500 one
[2:05:08] time it's 73 even to one person that is
[2:05:11] why we can have such consolation to know
[2:05:12] that no matter where we are or what
[2:05:15] condition we are in
[2:05:16] one word will bring his presence to us
[2:05:20] that's why you come to service and one
[2:05:22] word and it starts it's over for you
[2:05:24] whatever you're going through it's
[2:05:25] finished right there because you get a
[2:05:27] word from the Lord really that
[2:05:28] hallelujah praise God he said we see
[2:05:31] Nations united we see the world united
[2:05:33] we see coming in Iceland he said and
[2:05:35] never before since the early church was
[2:05:37] the pillar fire ever among the people
[2:05:38] since the early church never did they
[2:05:41] see the things to be seeing today and
[2:05:43] this was only made possible when God
[2:05:45] sent the Seven Seals and give us a Sign
[2:05:48] by it and send seven angels from Heaven
[2:05:51] they come to bring that scattered word
[2:05:53] in them denominations and tie it back in
[2:05:56] the word of God again to bring down this
[2:06:00] Holy Spirit
[2:06:01] so the object of the Seven Angels was
[2:06:03] the God of all the scattered world all
[2:06:05] the Loose Ends so concede and this and
[2:06:07] that all kind all together and when it
[2:06:10] was all goddess together the world
[2:06:11] become a channel for the Holy Ghost
[2:06:12] itself
[2:06:13] to come down
[2:06:15] then he said he was sentences to prophet
[2:06:16] of the true word
[2:06:18] it's only for sale with a message
[2:06:21] to return to the original word of God
[2:06:24] and the fate of the fathers to bring
[2:06:27] down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst
[2:06:30] the people
[2:06:31] I think that word reading again
[2:06:33] it's from the first c u p paragraph 398.
[2:06:36] he would send us a true prophet of the
[2:06:39] true word
[2:06:40] with a message to do what to return to
[2:06:43] the original word of God
[2:06:45] and the faith of the fathers to do what
[2:06:47] to bring down
[2:06:49] the power of the Holy Ghost among the
[2:06:51] people all right you're going good
[2:06:54] for the brown
[2:06:55] this is a big one here
[2:06:57] and the devil can impersonate any one of
[2:06:59] those things but he cannot be the Holy
[2:07:01] Ghost
[2:07:05] the devil could imprison it any gift but
[2:07:07] he cannot be
[2:07:09] the Holy Ghost
[2:07:11] and the Holy Ghost
[2:07:14] is the token
[2:07:17] that the blood is applying
[2:07:19] but the important to put up this one for
[2:07:21] me you think about this one
[2:07:23] and the Holy Ghost
[2:07:26] is the token
[2:07:28] that the blood has been applied because
[2:07:31] it follows the blood all the way from
[2:07:34] the book of redemption
[2:07:36] so the spirit
[2:07:38] follows
[2:07:40] the blood
[2:07:42] because the blood of the life
[2:07:45] so when the blood is applied to you the
[2:07:48] spirit comes upon you
[2:07:50] could you get a bigger body
[2:07:52] I guess that's how it formatted right
[2:07:54] they're so small
[2:07:56] you see that and the Holy Ghost is the
[2:07:58] token
[2:07:59] that the blood has been applied
[2:08:01] because it followed the blood all the
[2:08:03] way from the book of redemption that was
[2:08:06] the purpose of him coming to following
[2:08:08] every age
[2:08:09] every Edge he followed out to sea it
[2:08:11] brought forth so in this age God sent
[2:08:14] seven Thunders
[2:08:15] the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:08:17] the splash upon the bride that blood is
[2:08:20] what upon you that's why we could feel
[2:08:21] the spirit because the blood is upon you
[2:08:24] oh the Democrat accused so much he want
[2:08:26] to accuse but the blood is upon you and
[2:08:28] because of the blood we have the spirit
[2:08:30] that follows the blood from where from
[2:08:33] the book of redemption it's a bloodline
[2:08:35] or glory to God it's a bloodline praise
[2:08:38] God praise God praise God
[2:08:42] Hallelujah
[2:08:43] Hallelujah
[2:08:45] glory to God so listen this
[2:08:48] and in this last days the Seven Seas
[2:08:51] been open was to pick up every struggle
[2:08:54] I've been left over it and make the
[2:08:56] whole thing in one great body of the
[2:08:57] bride and then we'll live back there was
[2:09:00] not perfect until this church be
[2:09:01] perfected
[2:09:03] this bright group in the last days have
[2:09:05] to bring them in and all together taken
[2:09:07] up
[2:09:08] this bright church have to take them in
[2:09:11] that means this bride have to come to
[2:09:13] Perfection to bring the resurrection and
[2:09:16] to come to Perfection you have to add
[2:09:18] the Capstone and to get to the Capstone
[2:09:20] you have to go up them seven steps
[2:09:22] oh give the Lord a shout
[2:09:25] glory to God has seven steps to
[2:09:28] Perfection walking up
[2:09:31] seven steps of affection
[2:09:35] Jesus Christ the holy spirit is Among Us
[2:09:38] we should reference that we can't humble
[2:09:41] ourselves enough
[2:09:42] taking off your shoes getting on your
[2:09:44] knees wouldn't expect wouldn't satisfy
[2:09:46] it it wouldn't suffice us but the life
[2:09:48] that brings forth the Fruit of the
[2:09:49] Spirit
[2:09:50] and what is the foot of the spirit Joy
[2:09:52] love peace
[2:09:54] could we continue
[2:09:57] question and answers brother Brown
[2:09:59] this is 28th of August 964.

[2:10:06] no
[2:10:08] whatever happens happens now
[2:10:10] after that time she will have to go
[2:10:13] through the tribulation period
[2:10:16] and the reason of it is because she has
[2:10:20] rejected the atonement in its fullness
[2:10:24] this year is the foolish virgin
[2:10:27] let's continue
[2:10:29] she is a believer
[2:10:30] in the message
[2:10:32] a professed believer but she will have
[2:10:35] to go through the tribulation period
[2:10:37] because she didn't accept the atonement
[2:10:40] in its fullness
[2:10:42] and the atonement is fullness
[2:10:44] is the blood
[2:10:46] which Peter identified
[2:10:48] as virtue and knowledge and Temperance

[2:11:31] foreign
[2:11:42] she will have to go to the tribulation
[2:11:46] disbeliever here now

[2:11:49] nobody seven times
[2:11:51] you have the nomination person you
[2:11:53] believe the Bible yes you tell them go
[2:11:55] to Malachi foreign

[2:12:16] it's only for the bread
[2:12:20] that's the only exclusive I promise you
[2:12:22] know everybody
[2:12:28] but this meteor no this this meat this
[2:12:30] rip fresh

[2:12:47] catchy book say thank you hold it it
[2:12:50] went back to the hands and original
[2:12:51] owner so God took back the book he took
[2:12:54] back the deed he took back The
[2:12:56] Inheritance Adam was the one supposed to
[2:12:58] call your name Adam had the book Adam
[2:13:01] was supposed to call for you Adam was to

[2:13:08] we fell into sin we fell into sex and
[2:13:12] when Jesus come he's accepted he born
[2:13:15] again of the word and spirit so God come
[2:13:18] back to bring us back the word and
[2:13:20] spirit as we were supposed to be

[2:17:21] nothing to do with that is what the son
[2:17:23] of man revealed to you is what your
[2:17:25] Father revealed to you my God
[2:17:28] listen to this
[2:17:33] there were 10 versions
[2:17:35] went to the middle bridegroom
[2:17:37] half of them had oil in the lamp half of

[2:17:49] lamps I'm going to the wedding supper
[2:17:51] but when the foolish virgin said give us
[2:17:53] some of your oil
[2:17:55] our lives are gone out give us up your
[2:17:57] oil not sow
[2:18:01] Nacho
[2:18:04] wrong
[2:18:07] [Applause]
[2:18:09] you should have come before
[2:18:11] but this is the time for not so
[2:18:16] not so watch not so we just got enough
[2:18:19] for ourselves go and buy
[2:18:21] go and buy it
[2:18:23] and always Pompey the price
[2:18:25] it cost us
[2:18:27] our Revival has cost
[2:18:29] Holy Ghost has caused
[2:18:31] break through those costs pressing this
[2:18:34] cost it cost us when you see people get
[2:18:38] a breakthrough it cost them oh glory to
[2:18:41] God
[2:18:42] watch
[2:18:44] when the when the proclamation went out
[2:18:46] they decree the problem coming everybody
[2:18:48] wanted to get right quick
[2:18:50] in that hour in the hour when they're
[2:18:52] writing on the wall
[2:18:53] but I'm saying oh he experienced it oh
[2:18:56] we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[2:18:58] won't distract the other but while they
[2:19:00] went to buy the bridegroom came and they
[2:19:03] left outside whether it be weeping
[2:19:04] unwilling a nation of teeth
[2:19:07] death doesn't do nothing to a man but
[2:19:09] changes dwell in place it doesn't change
[2:19:11] your nature it doesn't change your fate

[2:19:20] daughter over there so I don't care how
[2:19:22] old you are how you live how good you
[2:19:24] live it wouldn't change you one bit to
[2:19:26] die just your dwelling place and if you
[2:19:29] can't accept the whole word of God the
[2:19:31] way it is written you won't do it so
[2:19:33] don't worry you won't be there you have
[2:19:35] got to accept it in its fullness and the
[2:19:39] power of His Vindication and the
[2:19:41] revelation of what it is then you become
[2:19:44] part of it oh glory to God and the pride
[2:19:47] the church reject the atonement and its
[2:19:50] fullness oh praise God I'm I'm on the
[2:19:53] home stretch here now oh let's look at
[2:19:55] it you know brother you see the
[2:19:58] atonement in action let's hope Alabama
[2:20:00] describe it you talk about two Nations
[2:20:02] right more than Israel Moab is Believers
[2:20:05] in Jehovah they are the prophet Israel
[2:20:07] had a prophet both of them are prophets
[2:20:09] one is balam one is Moses now they come
[2:20:12] now they were organized right the nation
[2:20:14] coming up the curses of the nation watch
[2:20:15] those two prophets fundamentally
[2:20:17] speaking them both of them was exactly
[2:20:19] right notice Balaam the bishop told them
[2:20:22] no bill me said monitors so Bill in my
[2:20:25] revelation of seven altars isn't that
[2:20:26] right said Miss complete
[2:20:29] on each watch a perfect example of the
[2:20:32] day we're living in watch bailam
[2:20:34] required a ram on each altar that was
[2:20:36] speaking of faith and become a messiah
[2:20:37] one Prophet on an Israel Camp had the
[2:20:40] characteristics of God and the word of
[2:20:42] God he stared with the promise of God
[2:20:44] for that age as far as fundamental part
[2:20:46] Balaam and balak could be identified as
[2:20:49] Moses was you see Moses being the
[2:20:52] correct prophet of God not only had the
[2:20:54] fundamental parents but he had the
[2:20:56] identification of God he was in the
[2:20:58] liner Duty with the promise of God for
[2:21:00] the age God's characteristics identified
[2:21:04] in Moses and let's go a pillar of fire
[2:21:06] was following them he had the atonement
[2:21:08] in action not speaking of it but had it
[2:21:12] in action now what will be but what is
[2:21:14] right now but Glory no good so you mean
[2:21:17] there's token or the atonement or the
[2:21:19] blood after coming to action yes it will
[2:21:22] be an action among the bride notice
[2:21:24] you're a brass serpent they have been
[2:21:26] lifted up for the sickness and disease
[2:21:27] of the people the more Moses was
[2:21:29] practicing Divine Healing he had the
[2:21:31] atonement the brass symbol the brass
[2:21:33] Supreme symbolizing that God in the camp
[2:21:34] he had the Smith and rock following him
[2:21:36] that was identified God and then they
[2:21:39] were traveling lying the promise that
[2:21:40] was another identification to show God's
[2:21:42] characteristics no matter how
[2:21:45] fundamental this other one was with the
[2:21:47] word he had the fundamentalism plus the
[2:21:50] identification and the characteristics
[2:21:52] of God among them God identify himself
[2:21:56] two prophets spotted them prophets both
[2:21:58] of them fundamental but God identifies
[2:22:00] characters in Moses because they are the
[2:22:02] characteristics of God with him now
[2:22:05] God's characteristics are really is
[2:22:08] always Supernatural
[2:22:10] the Lord I shout on that one
[2:22:12] because he is Supernatural and God is
[2:22:16] Supernatural God deals with individuals
[2:22:19] he's so unusual to the way of thinking
[2:22:21] we get off the trend we have to believe
[2:22:23] it this way and then God comes along
[2:22:25] with his word and he promised identify
[2:22:27] himself with the word this group can't
[2:22:29] go to it because they don't believe it
[2:22:30] see watch my Lord praise God
[2:22:34] water blood and spirit isn't that right
[2:22:38] so the blood atonement attracts the
[2:22:43] spirit isn't that right so the Holy
[2:22:46] Spirit
[2:22:47] Falls in every inch praise God to bring
[2:22:51] forth those names that was in the blood
[2:22:53] section of the book
[2:22:54] not just the regular section but God put
[2:22:57] your name in the blood section of the
[2:22:59] book therefore I know this morning you
[2:23:01] are going to be filled with the Holy
[2:23:03] Ghost despite what you feel despite what
[2:23:06] you think God had put you on your blood
[2:23:08] section for the evening here put you in
[2:23:11] the blood section for nothing if you're
[2:23:12] dead you will come alive if you're sick
[2:23:14] you're gonna be healed if you're born
[2:23:16] you're gonna free you if you're in a
[2:23:18] fisherman gonna quickly then you'll be a
[2:23:19] fish of men or give the Lord some
[2:23:21] Praises praise praise praise God praise
[2:23:24] God praise God so there's blood
[2:23:26] atonement is what will bring down the
[2:23:28] presence of God this brother told me is
[2:23:30] what we have here in Hearthstone
[2:23:32] Tabernacle that is why we have the
[2:23:33] presence of God because there's a blood
[2:23:35] that's speaking Oh Glory to God
[2:23:37] hallelujah let me at the home stretch
[2:23:39] here glory to God Museum Hallelujah
[2:23:43] for the brand of them
[2:23:45] you're the final stretchy
[2:23:47] there are seven steps that goes to God
[2:23:49] for seven spirits comes down all right
[2:23:52] seven steps that goes to God he said in
[2:23:56] perfect mind when you say I want to get
[2:23:58] closer to God what you are actually
[2:24:01] saying I want to grow in God
[2:24:05] that's what closer means do you
[2:24:07] understand it now so when they get on
[2:24:09] the Fate I'm gonna close with you you
[2:24:11] get virtue
[2:24:13] oh God I want more of you you get
[2:24:15] knowledge
[2:24:16] God give me more give me more give me
[2:24:18] more
[2:24:19] you got Temperance on patience and
[2:24:20] cognitively counters and then you can't
[2:24:22] get any more
[2:24:23] because in John 42 is it at that day
[2:24:26] you shall know I'm in the father you and
[2:24:29] me and I and you
[2:24:30] can't get closer now you are one wit
[2:24:34] oh give the Lord a shout when you see me
[2:24:37] you see my father
[2:24:39] Oh Glory to God are you with me now all
[2:24:42] right here we go here you are seven
[2:24:44] churches
[2:24:45] seven steps God building his church is
[2:24:49] like one person into an individual into
[2:24:51] himself the glory the power of God
[2:24:54] coming down through this well in it
[2:24:55] together
[2:24:56] no matter how strong you are built up
[2:24:58] it's got a weak link there's where she
[2:25:01] breaks now if you possess this and don't
[2:25:03] have this she's gonna break
[2:25:05] so if you are possessed knowledge and I
[2:25:07] know how virtue it will break you don't
[2:25:09] have Temperance and go break so hear
[2:25:11] what he said if you haven't got this
[2:25:12] thing on a break so when you surrender
[2:25:14] your complete being
[2:25:16] the Holy Spirit pours through you
[2:25:19] in these virtues then you are a living
[2:25:22] Tabernacle then the people say that's a
[2:25:25] man full of virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:25:28] patience godliness brightly kindness
[2:25:30] full of the Holy Ghost a stature that
[2:25:34] the unbelievers can look and say there's
[2:25:35] a Christian
[2:25:38] there's a man or woman who knows what
[2:25:40] they're talking about you've never seen
[2:25:42] a Kinder sweeter Godly person you are
[2:25:44] sealed a sealed
[2:25:46] shows on both sides whether you're going
[2:25:48] or coming you see the sea just the same
[2:25:50] there you are and when a man here we go
[2:25:53] a woman
[2:25:54] that means that preacher is only
[2:25:56] man or
[2:25:58] woman possesses this
[2:26:01] these virtues
[2:26:03] then the Capstone comes down
[2:26:05] and seals them into the kingdom of God
[2:26:08] which is the Holy Ghost
[2:26:11] then the word coming from here manifests
[2:26:14] itself to each one of these beings
[2:26:15] making this a competition a Tabernacle
[2:26:19] of the Living God a walking living
[2:26:22] example of Christianity this is what I
[2:26:24] want
[2:26:25] I want to be a walking
[2:26:27] living example of Christianity
[2:26:31] what Christ was these people are
[2:26:34] because his life isn't there they are in
[2:26:36] Christ and their life is dead and hid in
[2:26:39] Christ through God sealing there by the
[2:26:41] Holy Ghost First Corinthians to have you
[2:26:44] reckon yourself dead then you're born of
[2:26:46] faith and vote you on these things are
[2:26:47] added till you are perfect image of
[2:26:49] living God and through that he has
[2:26:52] brought 70 changes to show seven steps
[2:26:56] that he brought building his individual
[2:26:58] into his image
[2:27:00] Oh Glory to God you get a terminatory
[2:27:03] forming yourself into the word image
[2:27:06] you have bricks this building here was
[2:27:08] once bricks and cement gravel Sun that
[2:27:13] is building materials but we have to
[2:27:15] take the building materials and form it

[2:27:21] have it on books you have it on tapes
[2:27:23] you listen to it that is building
[2:27:24] materials but it has to be formed
[2:27:27] under pressure and the trials and the
[2:27:30] tests and the tribulation and all what
[2:27:32] to go through helps form
[2:27:35] you or give the Lord a shout
