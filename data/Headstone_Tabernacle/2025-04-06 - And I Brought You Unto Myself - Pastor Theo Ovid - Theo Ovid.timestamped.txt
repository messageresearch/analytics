[50:38] over here this morning. It's a canopy of
[50:41] life. It's a canopy of love. It's a
[50:43] canopy of your spirit. Father, may
[50:45] deliver, set the captives free, restore,
[50:47] heal, deliver, save, revive. As we
[50:51] approach your word, may I bless it in
[50:52] Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. God
[50:55] bless you and welcome. Thanks for coming
[50:57] out. Just two scriptures like to read
[50:59] this morning. Exodus chapter 19 want to
[51:02] read verse 3-6 and John 15 want to read
[51:06] ver one verse there verse
[51:08] 7 certainly appreciate the message on
[51:10] Wednesday night that your fruit might
[51:13] remain but
[51:14] Anthony that was really something
[51:17] okay so Exodus chapter
[51:20] 19 want to read verse 3-6 Six.
[51:31] And Moses went up into unto God. And the
[51:35] Lord called unto him out of the
[51:36] mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to
[51:40] the house of Jacob, and tell the
[51:43] children of
[51:45] Israel. Ye have seen what I did unto the
[51:48] Egyptians, how I bear you on eagle's
[51:51] wings, and brought you unto myself.
[51:56] Now therefore, if he will obey my voice
[51:59] indeed, and keep my covenant, then he
[52:03] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[52:06] above all people, for all the earth is
[52:10] mine, and he shall be unto me a kingdom
[52:14] of priests, and an holy nation. These
[52:18] are the words which thou shalt speak
[52:21] unto the children of Israel. And since
[52:24] John 15 1 verse there, verse
[52:27] 7, if you abide in me and my words abide
[52:31] in you, you shall ask what you will and
[52:34] it shall be done unto you. May God bless
[52:36] the reading of his word. You may be
[52:37] seated. Praise God.
[52:40] It's good to be here this morning.
[52:42] That's a beautiful song. Show me your
[52:45] ways.
[52:46] As I said before, the Old Testament
[52:49] reflects
[52:51] uh the ways of God, the thinking of God.
[52:54] You could read stuff in the New
[52:55] Testament, but the but the but the Old
[52:58] Testament reflects the nature of God,
[53:01] how God sees things.
[53:04] So this morning
[53:06] I I have a
[53:08] title and and I brought you unto myself
[53:13] using the text that God was how God
[53:17] interpret bringing them out of Egypt on
[53:20] eagle's wings. But before I go there to
[53:23] speak on that I want to share
[53:25] something very shared with me of an
[53:29] interview a private interview. uh this
[53:32] is will be the 5th of July 1964
[53:36] uh with brother Bram and some sister
[53:37] Bruce and I want to read this for you.
[53:40] Sister Bruce says I make so many
[53:41] mistakes and I fail so many times. So
[53:44] brother Bram is answering that is why
[53:47] Christ had to die so that you with your
[53:50] mistakes wouldn't be loted to you. See
[53:53] he took your mistakes your desire in
[53:57] your heart is to serve him. Sister Bruce
[53:59] says yes. All right. That's what he died
[54:02] for so you could serve him. Your
[54:05] mistakes are not looked, not loted to
[54:07] you. See, he is your propriation. See,
[54:11] he is your sin offering. Your sins are
[54:15] not known. You are not a sinner before
[54:19] God. Christ took your sin and become you
[54:24] cuz your desire is to serve him. Amen.
[54:29] So onto he said on the inter interview
[54:31] on the interview a few moments ago I was
[54:33] speaking to a person in the room that's
[54:36] present now said but brother Brham I
[54:39] have so many things that I know that's
[54:42] wrong a godly little woman. I said, "But
[54:45] look, sister, you don't look at
[54:47] yourself. It's just what your desire is.
[54:51] And and what you try to do, if you
[54:54] really love the Lord, you will try to
[54:56] serve him with all your heart." And then
[54:58] all your mistakes is hid in the blood of
[55:01] the Lord Jesus. Oh, praise God. Do you
[55:03] appreciate the Lord this morning?
[55:06] Thank God for that. The blood. That's
[55:10] why we are here because of blood.
[55:11] Hallelujah. We're not here because we
[55:12] has behaved nice and we have good
[55:14] behavior because of blood and the blood
[55:16] give us access to his presence and that
[55:18] presence is what transform what is in
[55:20] our hearts. Oh, praise the God. Amen.
[55:22] You you follow what I'm saying? So this
[55:25] grace this grace is sovereign and that's
[55:27] why God could somebody could be back in
[55:29] 70 years and God sovereignly extend
[55:30] grace to them to restore them. And I was
[55:33] thinking about time and chance. Somehow
[55:34] just come to my mind. You know, the
[55:36] Bible there's a scripture about time and
[55:37] chance and talking about uh the battle
[55:39] is not for the strong and the swift and
[55:41] whatnot, but time and chance happened to
[55:42] all men. And I was thinking about the
[55:45] thief on the cross, the one who say,
[55:48] "Lord, remember me." He was a old thief,
[55:51] never had a Bible, never went to church,
[55:53] but somehow time and chance placed him
[55:57] at the cross. Now maybe another person
[55:59] might have been guilty and hung up on
[56:00] the cross. But that particular thief, he
[56:03] was on that side of the cross. The other
[56:05] old thief said um um save yourself and
[56:07] save us too. And that thief say old
[56:10] crook. This man deserve not the man
[56:12] don't deserve this. Remember me. Just
[56:14] those two words. He get baptized in
[56:16] Jesus name. He shake nobody hand. He had
[56:18] no mystery in the head. Nobody pump the
[56:20] word and and and tell him this and tell
[56:21] him word and word. Jesus said today you
[56:24] will be with me.
[56:25] And you can't question that because God
[56:28] is sovereign. Oh, praise God. So I have
[56:31] a title and I brought you unto myself
[56:34] and have inspiration. One
[56:36] goal, one purpose God wanted to achieve
[56:41] and this was since the fall of man and
[56:43] Moses and we read it. You have seen what
[56:46] I did unto the Egyptians. How I bear you
[56:47] an eagle's wings and brought you myself.
[56:49] And if you notice even in the Psalms you
[56:52] will see God is very reflective of
[56:54] remind people where they come from
[56:56] because it's a strange thing you know
[56:58] people just forget where they come from
[56:59] you know people has forget what God
[57:01] brought them out from you know and that
[57:03] is a sad thing because it has get you
[57:05] away from gratefulness and thankfulness
[57:08] and the grace of God. You didn't bring
[57:10] yourself out. He brought you out. You
[57:12] didn't pull yourself up. He pulled you
[57:14] up. You didn't bless yourself. He
[57:15] blessed you. Whether with strength,
[57:18] whether with education, whether with
[57:19] job, whether with money, whether with
[57:21] wealth, whatever God put, he blessed
[57:23] you. He didn't have to do it. Time and
[57:26] chance happened to all men. Oh, glory to
[57:29] God. The opportunities for somebody in
[57:31] the country is way different from
[57:33] somebody in the city. The person in the
[57:35] city have more opportunities than
[57:36] somebody in the country. But the person
[57:37] is in the country. What will what will
[57:39] they do? Time and chance happen to all
[57:43] men. You're not in America. You're in
[57:44] Trinidad. Time and chance happen to all
[57:46] men. I'm so happy to be in this country.
[57:49] I don't want to be nowhere else. Praise
[57:51] God. If God put me here, I'm in the
[57:53] safest place I could be. I'm in the best
[57:55] place that can be. I have no complaints.
[57:57] I'm grateful. I am thankful for God. He
[58:00] woke me up this morning. He put strength
[58:02] in my feet. He put a praise upon my
[58:04] lips. I have something to shout about
[58:06] because he brought me on the mic. He set
[58:09] my feet on a rock to stick. Oh, give the
[58:11] Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[58:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. After Lucifer,
[58:17] son of the morning, was placed in
[58:19] position as a high star over the music,
[58:23] over this, over that, he find it wasn't
[58:25] good enough. Pride raise up in his
[58:27] heart. He said, "I'll be like the most
[58:29] high." Hallelujah. And he formed a coup
[58:31] in heaven and got the boots and got
[58:33] kicked out. Oh, give the Lord some
[58:35] praises. Pride is from the devil.
[58:37] Humility is from God. Oh, give the Lord
[58:39] some shout. And that's why he say humble
[58:41] yourself under the mighty hand of God
[58:43] and he shall exalt you in due time. Oh
[58:46] give the Lord a shout. God going to
[58:48] raise you up. God going to bless you.
[58:51] You don't have to out nobody light for
[58:53] your light to shine. Give the Lord a
[58:55] shout in the house. Did you hear what I
[58:57] just said? You don't have to out nobody
[58:59] light for your light to shine. Just let
[59:02] your light shine and darkness have to
[59:05] run. Darkness have to go.
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:13] ministers. Ministers blasting this one.
[59:15] Blast this one. Blasting. Oh, God.
[59:19] Father blasting everybody in sight and
[59:23] and it appears if they're right and not
[59:26] nothing at all. Not just blasting. All
[59:29] right, let's go. So on the exhortation
[59:33] on Friday prayer meeting, if you haven't
[59:35] listened to it, you should listen to it.
[59:37] I was speaking about how God's desire
[59:40] was to bring us into this kingdom of
[59:41] priests and King and Isaac always strike
[59:43] it and I was more emphasizing that
[59:46] priestly road and that priestly road is
[59:47] where you offer sacrifices and first we
[59:51] read where Jesus offered prayers and
[59:52] supplication and then Jesus with tears
[59:55] with tears Jesus prayers and
[59:57] supplication and then Jesus offered
[59:59] himself and then I connected that to
[1:00:02] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:00:04] you as a priest to offer yourself Just
[1:00:07] as people offer themselves to the devil,
[1:00:09] a lot of these singers and so on, they
[1:00:10] actually sell their soul to the devil.
[1:00:11] They're saying it openly and they don't
[1:00:13] know how to cancel that deal and that
[1:00:15] bargain because they bargain for wealth
[1:00:17] and fame and popularity and they sell
[1:00:19] their soul to the devil and they have
[1:00:21] songs and I don't know where
[1:00:24] I was thinking about some of these songs
[1:00:27] from old days. It's so demon inspired.
[1:00:30] If loving you is wrong, I don't want to
[1:00:32] be right. It's a old song. Um, you're my
[1:00:35] first, you my last, you're my
[1:00:36] everything. Giving glory to some woman
[1:00:37] or something. So, um, forget him man. A
[1:00:40] big big guy. Forget him name. Barry
[1:00:42] White. You are my first, you my last,
[1:00:44] you my everything. I don't Satan himself
[1:00:47] was inspired all them kind of love
[1:00:48] songs. So that's a lie. You know, you're
[1:00:50] my first, you're my last. A woman, my
[1:00:52] everything. He crazy or what? That is
[1:00:55] craziness. But what I'm saying then that
[1:00:57] was nice love song. But is the devil
[1:01:00] bringing music? You remember he was in
[1:01:01] tune with that in heaven. He know about
[1:01:04] the instruments. He know about the
[1:01:05] vibes. He know about the emotions. He
[1:01:08] know what get the people in the mood. He
[1:01:10] knows that and he inspires that. And God
[1:01:12] know the vibes too. That's why when you
[1:01:14] get the word to get you in the mood, the
[1:01:16] mood of what? Of faith, of expectation,
[1:01:19] of deliverance, of healing. God know
[1:01:21] what to do. You know, you come here
[1:01:22] tonight for a purpose. It's not by
[1:01:24] chance you're here. You here for a
[1:01:26] purpose. You here that you can get a
[1:01:27] breakthrough. Praise God. Amen. You're
[1:01:30] here that you can get deliverance.
[1:01:31] That's what we come to church for, to
[1:01:33] get delivered. And one day we'll be
[1:01:35] delivered from this corruption. Oh, the
[1:01:37] Lord I shout every day we coming for
[1:01:39] deliverance. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Feel good this
[1:01:45] morning. In other words, they came out
[1:01:47] of Egypt. They were delivered from
[1:01:49] Egypt, but Egypt was in them.
[1:01:52] Hallelujah. They wasn't delivered from
[1:01:54] themselves.
[1:01:55] So coming out is not good enough.
[1:01:58] Do you get that? Amen. I come out of
[1:02:00] Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostals. I come
[1:02:02] out of this, I come out of that. Coming
[1:02:03] out is not good enough. It's what you're
[1:02:05] going into. So God don't want you just
[1:02:07] come out. He said, "I brought you unto
[1:02:11] myself." Hallelujah. That was the
[1:02:14] destination to get you back to him. Not
[1:02:17] to church, to him. Amen. Amen. So God's
[1:02:23] primary purpose is to bring us to
[1:02:24] himself. In other words, the outer
[1:02:26] court, the inner court, the most holy
[1:02:29] place.
[1:02:31] God is interested in personal connection
[1:02:33] with his people. Here we go. Some stop
[1:02:36] short at religion confined to a belief.
[1:02:39] Like a brother Tama fellowship, we don't
[1:02:41] believe the same things. I believe that
[1:02:43] means he's closed with religion. Because
[1:02:45] this thing about fellowship, he said if
[1:02:47] we say we have uh we we say we love um
[1:02:50] love God and hate our brother, we lie
[1:02:52] and do not the truth. But if we confess
[1:02:54] our sins, he's faithful and just to
[1:02:56] forgive us our sins. God out of many
[1:02:58] nations, blood, peoples, and tongue take
[1:03:00] out of people up for his name's sake. We
[1:03:02] can't stop God from taking people from
[1:03:03] whatever country. He is God. He know
[1:03:05] where their names are at. We have the
[1:03:07] same blood for us is for them. Whether
[1:03:10] they rich, whether they poor, whether
[1:03:11] they in Africa, whether in in in South
[1:03:13] America, whether in in Europe, it
[1:03:15] doesn't matter where they are. God is
[1:03:17] the one who have their names on the
[1:03:18] book. And the same God that called you
[1:03:20] called them.
[1:03:25] I was told the gathering yesterday that
[1:03:28] if we want to choose we pick our family
[1:03:30] you come cousin uncle auntie and auntie
[1:03:32] but you see God put the chosen on you go
[1:03:35] he said you have not chosen me I have
[1:03:36] chosen you so god picked the people
[1:03:39] Peter John or whatn not and tell them
[1:03:41] shake hands and fellowship well I don't
[1:03:42] talk to that one God have nothing to do
[1:03:43] with that you know he called this one
[1:03:45] the one you don't talk to and he called
[1:03:46] that one the one that you like he called
[1:03:49] all of them and you have a problem deal
[1:03:51] with it. Give the Lord a shout. Who he
[1:03:54] found you, he called. Give me a shout on
[1:03:56] that one now. Who he found you, he
[1:03:58] called. That's why he called you.
[1:04:00] Because he he thought about you. You
[1:04:01] were in his thinking. You were in his
[1:04:03] mind. That's why he called you. Not
[1:04:05] because you stop fornicating. Not
[1:04:06] because you stop lying. Not because you
[1:04:08] stopping adultery. No, he forneew you.
[1:04:10] That's why he called you. He called you
[1:04:12] to get out of that. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:04:14] shout to get out of fornication. To get
[1:04:16] out adultery, to get out of unbelief. He
[1:04:18] called you to call you out of that.
[1:04:21] Hallelujah.
[1:04:23] [Music]
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:25] Some short some short at religion
[1:04:27] confined to belief. They believe this in
[1:04:30] the message. They believe that in the
[1:04:31] message they don't believe that and they
[1:04:32] are satisfied by that. They don't
[1:04:34] believe in shouting. They do don't
[1:04:36] believe in praising God and worshiping.
[1:04:37] They find too much a noise. But they
[1:04:39] don't understand if we don't get in the
[1:04:41] spirit. You have no revelation to get.
[1:04:43] You will just sit like a Jehovah witness
[1:04:44] and sit down there as if there's a
[1:04:46] kingdom hall. There's not no kingdom
[1:04:47] hall. We talking about the kingdom of
[1:04:48] God. And to get revelation, you have to
[1:04:51] get in the spirit. Glory to God.
[1:04:53] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. Go study your bills when
[1:04:58] inside of here. Go study your pains when
[1:05:00] you're inside of here. Go study what
[1:05:01] your children doing when you're inside
[1:05:02] of here. Leave the children out. Leave
[1:05:04] the bills out. Leave the work out. Leave
[1:05:07] what you have problems facing out. Oh,
[1:05:10] give the Lord a shout. If there's a red
[1:05:12] sea in front of you, God could make a
[1:05:13] way. If there's mountains on both sides,
[1:05:16] God could make a way. If Pharaoh is
[1:05:18] riding behind your back, God could make
[1:05:20] a way because he has proven himself to
[1:05:22] be a way maker. Oh, he is still a way
[1:05:25] maker tonight. He is still a provider.
[1:05:27] He is still a deliverer. He is still a
[1:05:29] baptizer.
[1:05:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he is not
[1:05:36] dead. He is still alive. This message is
[1:05:39] not dead. It's alive. We are here to
[1:05:42] prove it's alive. Oh God, I can feel him
[1:05:44] in my hands. I could feel it in my feet.
[1:05:47] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Want to bust
[1:05:52] you out your fleshly self, your stinking
[1:05:54] self, your pride self. You want to bust
[1:05:57] you out of that.
[1:06:03] Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] So being confined to a belief that's in
[1:06:13] your head.
[1:06:16] I believe that's here. No life in that
[1:06:23] crying wasn't if you heal a man on the
[1:06:25] Sabbath day
[1:06:27] only word shall keep the Sabbath. You
[1:06:30] see if a donkey fall in a pit on the
[1:06:32] Sabbath they would take him out they
[1:06:34] scratch the head
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:37] and that's their donkey they leaving
[1:06:40] they going leave the donkey inside the
[1:06:41] pit.
[1:06:43] So what your vex me if I heal the man?
[1:06:46] Yes.
[1:06:48] He says, "Sabbath was made for man, not
[1:06:50] man for the Sabbath."
[1:06:54] David, the disciples eating corn from
[1:06:56] the field
[1:06:59] without washing their hands.
[1:07:06] Jesus say you with your wash hand, your
[1:07:08] pots, your pants, you're washing
[1:07:10] everything. Every day was a ceremony.
[1:07:11] You wash, you talk, you wash. Everything
[1:07:15] was a washing thing, you know, to appear
[1:07:17] holy,
[1:07:19] appear clean, and the filthy and
[1:07:22] wretched and how God saw them. We We
[1:07:26] have to forget how man sees us. I begin
[1:07:28] to catch how God sees us. You see the
[1:07:31] interview I read, God was ministering to
[1:07:34] that woman saying, "Listen, God not
[1:07:35] seeing your sins and your failures and
[1:07:37] your mistakes and so on, but when you're
[1:07:38] under blood, what's your desire? You
[1:07:40] have a desire to serve God." That's what
[1:07:41] God look at. That's why you can say
[1:07:42] Jacob I love and Esau so I hate. Oh,
[1:07:46] give the Lord a shout. He love Jacob
[1:07:48] because Jacob was a rational scampion.
[1:07:50] He loved Jacob because Jacob had a heart
[1:07:52] for the birthright. He had a heart for
[1:07:54] the Holy Ghost. He had a heart for
[1:07:56] revival. He had a heart for seven
[1:07:58] thunders. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He
[1:08:00] had a heart for God. You have to have a
[1:08:03] heart for God. It breaks you out of
[1:08:04] churchity. It breaks you out of your
[1:08:06] condition.
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:12] So some people stop short at what they
[1:08:14] do. They feel because they do things and
[1:08:17] this ties into do I give my body to be
[1:08:18] burn you know give my good to the poor
[1:08:20] you know they feel doing doing doing
[1:08:22] good works that they entitled to that's
[1:08:24] not it. But here what God wants. God
[1:08:27] wants a a what a innovation with you. He
[1:08:32] wants to talk with you. You say oh go
[1:08:33] tell Moses go and tell the people this.
[1:08:35] Hallelujah. Tell them I brought them
[1:08:38] out. Amen. On wings of eagles. Tell them
[1:08:42] I brought them unto myself.
[1:08:45] Tell them if they hear my voice and keep
[1:08:47] my covenant. And in every generation,
[1:08:49] these were the two things, his voice and
[1:08:52] his covenant. Because if you don't know
[1:08:53] his voice, you don't know his word. You
[1:08:54] can't please God. In order to please
[1:08:56] God, you have to know his will. And his
[1:08:58] will is revealed by his word. So if
[1:09:00] you're not in the word, you don't know
[1:09:01] the will. You're just living your life.
[1:09:04] Hallelujah. You could become a
[1:09:05] multi-millionaire living your life. You
[1:09:07] could be a criminal living your life.
[1:09:09] They could be a bad girl and living your
[1:09:11] life, bad boy living your life, but have
[1:09:14] nothing to do with love of God.
[1:09:18] I was telling the group I was talking to
[1:09:19] or when we get the equipment and thing
[1:09:21] or we like instead of looking at the
[1:09:23] manual, we like to press.
[1:09:26] You check no manual just pressing. Is it
[1:09:28] working? You pressing how this is
[1:09:30] working. You have a book.
[1:09:33] The book have the instructions how it's
[1:09:34] supposed to work. Well, we have a book.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. This giving instructions how
[1:09:40] this supposed to work. How man supposed
[1:09:43] to work. This is the book. Not what your
[1:09:45] mother say or your father say or your
[1:09:46] uncle or your grandma say. Not no old
[1:09:48] wife tables. This is the book. And when
[1:09:51] you get here, you know you're right.
[1:09:53] When you're on top of this, you know you
[1:09:54] can't fail. When you're on top of this,
[1:09:56] you know the devil can't move you
[1:09:58] because you are founded upon a rock, not
[1:09:59] a church. He said, "Upon this rock, I
[1:10:02] will build my church and the gates of
[1:10:04] hell will challenge it but cannot
[1:10:06] prevail against it." Listen, friends,
[1:10:07] you going to be challenged. That's why
[1:10:09] you need revelation. You going to be
[1:10:10] challenged. That's why you have to have
[1:10:11] a rock inside your heart. Oh, glory to
[1:10:14] God. Head thing is not going to stand.
[1:10:16] Devil will ride over you with chariot
[1:10:18] wheels over your head, but he can't
[1:10:20] conquer that heart. Oh, give the Lord
[1:10:22] some praises. Glory to God. But if you
[1:10:24] will indeed obey my voice and keep my
[1:10:27] covenant, then I'll be a peculiar
[1:10:28] treasure unto me. You shall be and above
[1:10:31] all people, above all it the earth is
[1:10:33] mine.
[1:10:35] And I read this in John 10. Trying to
[1:10:37] get but you believe not because you are
[1:10:39] not my sheep. As I said unto you, my
[1:10:42] sheep hear my voice. Watch. One, two,
[1:10:46] and I know them. Three, and they follow
[1:10:49] me.
[1:10:50] Who are my sheep? They are those who
[1:10:54] hear his voice and follow him.
[1:10:58] Hallelujah. Oh my. First Peter 2:9 and
[1:11:01] I'll close on this part. And you are
[1:11:03] chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
[1:11:05] holy nation, a peculiar people that you
[1:11:07] should show forth the praises of him.
[1:11:09] Show forth what? Praises of him who have
[1:11:13] called you out of darkness in this
[1:11:14] marvelous light. And you're called to
[1:11:16] bring forth the sacrifice of of praise.
[1:11:19] That means when your two tires go flat,
[1:11:21] you're supposed to say, "Praise God."
[1:11:23] Not cuss.
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:27] Do you get that now?
[1:11:29] Not to cuss, but to give God praise in
[1:11:33] the good times. In the bad times, when
[1:11:36] you're in the mountain, when you're in
[1:11:38] the valley, when things going good, and
[1:11:41] when thing not not so good, you're still
[1:11:43] giving him praise. It's a sacrifice.
[1:11:46] It's an offering. It's you saying, "God,
[1:11:49] you know all things and you promise to
[1:11:51] make all things to work together for
[1:11:53] good to them that love God. And you know
[1:11:56] I love you and I know you're going to
[1:11:58] make this mess to work out right." Give
[1:12:00] the Lord some praises in the house.
[1:12:08] Now watch. 400 years in bondage in
[1:12:10] Egypt. They're looking for deliverance.
[1:12:13] Those children at that time heard
[1:12:15] stories from their grandparents and
[1:12:17] those hear from their great-randparents
[1:12:18] and they was handing out all the time a
[1:12:19] deliverer coming deliver coming he
[1:12:22] coming he coming he coming be this year
[1:12:23] that went on for 400 years
[1:12:26] but deliver come
[1:12:29] but God's deliverance for them was not
[1:12:31] about their freedom
[1:12:34] because they came out you know they
[1:12:36] dance you know good they
[1:12:38] feel that was a real nice thing out of
[1:12:41] you know But you see that's how young
[1:12:43] people want they want the freedom. They
[1:12:45] find their parents holding them back and
[1:12:47] they want the freedom. And when they get
[1:12:48] the freedom, what you doing with the
[1:12:49] freedom?
[1:12:52] They get vexed with God. They want meat.
[1:12:55] God serving them bread.
[1:12:58] Angel bread falling on bread that they
[1:13:00] making and they baking. And they say we
[1:13:02] load this light bread. They know where
[1:13:04] it come from. These are human beings
[1:13:06] just like us, you know, telling God this
[1:13:08] light bread. Every morning they baking
[1:13:11] it. They have a bakery out in the
[1:13:12] wilderness. There two million people
[1:13:13] talking about
[1:13:15] every morning just pick up fresh bread.
[1:13:20] What to kill them, send plagues, this
[1:13:22] that or the other
[1:13:24] to bring them out what for? Unto
[1:13:27] themselves. Unto himself. They didn't
[1:13:29] know him. Just have we come from
[1:13:30] wherever and we don't know him. He
[1:13:32] calling them out to the mountain that
[1:13:34] they could learn of him because they
[1:13:37] don't know this God. Moses met God, not
[1:13:40] them.
[1:13:42] They were God's people. Moses met God,
[1:13:44] not them. He is bringing them to meet
[1:13:47] the God he met.
[1:13:49] Moses was smart enough to say, "Who
[1:13:51] shall I say send me?" Because them
[1:13:52] people in trouble big time. They're
[1:13:54] going to ask me where I get the
[1:13:56] authority from. They're going to ask me
[1:13:57] where I get the uncction from. They're
[1:13:58] going to ask me where I get the
[1:13:59] anointing from. Who shall I say send me?
[1:14:01] He said, "Tell them I am." Not I was not
[1:14:04] I will be. Tell them I am. I am present.
[1:14:07] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Right in your
[1:14:10] condition, I am present. How many
[1:14:12] believe that this morning? Whatever
[1:14:14] you're going through, I am. I am.
[1:14:17] Whatever. I am your healer. I am your
[1:14:19] deliverer. I am your baptizer. I am
[1:14:22] Glory to God. Give the Lord a shout God
[1:14:24] to set you free this morning. I believe
[1:14:26] all my heart.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah. Tell them I am. Not I was
[1:14:32] that I will be. I am. And that's what we
[1:14:34] want this morning. We want a God who is
[1:14:36] the I am. We want a God who could supply
[1:14:38] our need. We want a God who I'll never
[1:14:40] leave you. I'll never forsake you. We
[1:14:43] want our God to be our protector this
[1:14:44] morning. To be our guide this morning.
[1:14:46] Tariff or no tariff. We want our God to
[1:14:49] be a provider for us. Oh, get me started
[1:14:51] this morning. Give the Lord a shout. Oh,
[1:14:54] glory to God. Tough times coming, but we
[1:14:56] are here to do battle with the devil, to
[1:14:58] do battle with the enemy, to overcome.
[1:15:01] We are more than conquerors. Oh, glory
[1:15:03] to God.
[1:15:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He call you to
[1:15:08] be a king. To be a king is to be a
[1:15:10] ruler. To be a dominator, to conquer, to
[1:15:14] reign over. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:15:16] the house. Kings and priests unto
[1:15:19] God. How many feel like a champion this
[1:15:22] morning? I want you to feel like a
[1:15:24] champion. Like God's
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:28] champion. Amen.
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:34] Once a son, always with a son. You know,
[1:15:36] you got cancel that. You know, your
[1:15:38] blessing could be delayed but not
[1:15:39] denied. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the name
[1:15:42] of the Lord. Did you get that? Your
[1:15:44] blessing could be delayed but not
[1:15:46] denied. That's why when Samson prayed
[1:15:49] that prayer, he said, "Avenge me with
[1:15:50] two eyes. Avenge me once more, Lord. I
[1:15:53] had your power. I want it back."
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. I had your covenant. I want
[1:15:57] it back. I want a restoration. Oh, glory
[1:15:59] to God. And when Samson put his hands
[1:16:01] and he felt those seven locks, he know
[1:16:03] the covenant has been restored. And once
[1:16:05] the covenant has been restored, you
[1:16:07] could call for power. You could call for
[1:16:09] the anointing. You could call for rain
[1:16:11] because the covenant has been restored.
[1:16:13] Samson know he failed. Samson knew he
[1:16:15] fell. Samson know he was backslitting.
[1:16:17] But he knew he was getting back. Hey,
[1:16:20] glory to God. You got to get back where
[1:16:22] you first started from.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah.
[1:16:29] So deliverance out of Egypt were not
[1:16:32] just about their freedom. Amen. But
[1:16:33] where God is bringing them to to bring
[1:16:36] them to himself. Are you with me? Are
[1:16:39] you with me? Join his people into a deep
[1:16:43] personal relationship
[1:16:45] with him. Isn't that right? That's why I
[1:16:48] read the scripture, he abide in me and
[1:16:51] my words abide in you. He said, I am the
[1:16:54] vine.
[1:16:55] You are the branches and the branch the
[1:16:58] branches is what produces the fruit. Now
[1:17:00] if the branches
[1:17:03] feeling like a big shot then say I don't
[1:17:06] need divine I pulling away I moving
[1:17:09] moving out. I'm moving
[1:17:10] out where
[1:17:13] you don't understand the life from the
[1:17:16] vine is what give you the ability to
[1:17:19] bring forth fruit. Amen. So he said if
[1:17:21] you want to abide you have to abide in
[1:17:22] me to bring forth fruit. The vine is not
[1:17:25] producing fruit. The branches does.
[1:17:29] But if he abide in me and my words abide
[1:17:32] in you. What's the effect of that? You
[1:17:35] could ask whatever you will. This is a
[1:17:37] cancer case. You could ask for that too.
[1:17:39] There's a tumor case. You could ask for
[1:17:41] that. This is a leukemia case. You could
[1:17:42] ask for that. This is a diabetic case.
[1:17:44] You could ask for that. Somebody died.
[1:17:46] You could ask for that too. Glory to
[1:17:49] God. Do you get what I'm saying? This is
[1:17:51] the position that God wants the church
[1:17:53] to be in. A position of power, a
[1:17:56] position of abiding that you could see
[1:17:58] your backs and children being restored.
[1:18:01] You can see your wife being delivered.
[1:18:02] You can see your husband being
[1:18:03] delivered. You can see your family being
[1:18:05] delivered because you're seeing it
[1:18:06] through the eyes of God. Hallelujah. And
[1:18:09] you're seeing God using you to fulfill
[1:18:13] his will and to do his will. Oh, glory
[1:18:16] to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] My God is about to share with me. You
[1:18:21] had to be raised sharp in this hour. I
[1:18:23] love that. I just laugh.
[1:18:25] I love that. You're dull. You're dull.
[1:18:28] You ever see a dull knife or dove
[1:18:29] cutlast trying to cut a tree with
[1:18:32] it and you're cutting at all because the
[1:18:36] instrument is dull. You're beating hard
[1:18:38] and you're huffing and you're blowing. A
[1:18:41] man come with a sharp blade just picks
[1:18:44] one chop and off goes his head and you

[1:19:17] wouldn't push it farther.
[1:19:20] God want you sharp.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah. When Satan see you, he must
[1:19:25] say, "Look, let let me move one time.
[1:19:27] Let me move. Let me move. Let me move.
[1:19:28] Let me move." That's a sharp one coming.
[1:19:31] Hallelujah. That wasn't who know who God
[1:19:33] is. Hallelujah. They know how he lives.
[1:19:36] They know what God loves. They please
[1:19:38] the father. They are
[1:19:41] dangerous. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:19:43] praises. Glory to God. Some dangerous
[1:19:46] men and women on the earth today, not
[1:19:48] church members. We talking about real
[1:19:49] Christians. That's the thunder that
[1:19:51] going to shake the devil. The devil in
[1:19:53] front shaking in Trinidad. The devil in
[1:19:55] shaking in the tabernacle. There's
[1:19:57] somebody going to shake him with the
[1:19:59] power. Shake him with the anointing.
[1:20:01] Shake him with the uncction of God. You
[1:20:03] are going to be healed. Oh, glory to
[1:20:05] God. Your sickness going to be cursed.
[1:20:08] You are going to be healed. You are
[1:20:10] going to be delivered. Oh, give the Lord
[1:20:11] some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:14] Hallelujah. I'm prophesying over you
[1:20:16] this morning.
[1:20:19] Let's go.
[1:20:21] Joshua here is the book of redemption of
[1:20:24] the Old Testament. Joshua we have to
[1:20:26] consider to be that the book of
[1:20:28] redemption because it redemption has two
[1:20:30] parts. Redemption anyway has two parts.
[1:20:32] is out of into. It takes two parts to
[1:20:35] make a redemption out of into. So Moses
[1:20:38] represent the law which brought him out
[1:20:39] of Egypt. Whereas Joshua represent grace
[1:20:41] which took them into the promised land.
[1:20:43] Another way the law and grace are two
[1:20:45] different aspects of God's command. The
[1:20:47] law brought them out. Joshua took them
[1:20:49] in. It's also represented our day. It's
[1:20:53] the journey from Egypt to the promised
[1:20:56] land. In my father's house are many
[1:20:58] mansions. I would have told I told you
[1:20:59] so. It's the law that brings us to
[1:21:03] recognize that we are wrong. But it is
[1:21:05] grace that forgives us. The law has no
[1:21:08] hope of redemption to it has no grace in
[1:21:11] it. The law only points out that you are
[1:21:13] a sinner. But grace tell you how to get
[1:21:16] out of it. Do you get that? Some people
[1:21:20] like licks. I say it in this way.
[1:21:22] Because they they they don't have any
[1:21:25] internal policeman if I could say that
[1:21:28] way. So they're attracted to ministers
[1:21:30] and pastors and whatn not that put licks
[1:21:32] on them. Like a brother come at time
[1:21:35] coming here where he go from he used to
[1:21:36] get licks. So when he come here now he
[1:21:38] looking for see when I go put licks in
[1:21:39] him and um he said fine you're not
[1:21:42] calling me out. I'm say you so you you
[1:21:44] know what you're doing
[1:21:46] wrong. So so you waiting for me to call
[1:21:48] you out. You
[1:21:50] you but this is what he accustomed with.
[1:21:53] Every time he come service licks beat
[1:21:56] them for that. beat. You
[1:21:57] think you think a man want to beat your
[1:21:59] wife to love him?
[1:22:01] Come licks love
[1:22:04] me. What kind of love that going to be?
[1:22:08] I want you think about that
[1:22:12] now. So you think God want to beat up,
[1:22:14] right? Love me. I die for you. Was on
[1:22:16] the cross got leaks. Why don't you love
[1:22:19] me? That is what God want in the
[1:22:21] natural. We don't even want that.
[1:22:26] So God want his wife or this woman or
[1:22:29] this lady or this bride to love him
[1:22:32] whether he bless you or not you still
[1:22:33] love him. You could say the Lord give
[1:22:35] the Lord take it away. Blessed be of the
[1:22:37] Lord. That is how do we show our love
[1:22:40] for God? By conducting ourselves with
[1:22:42] joy and miss the trials. He in his
[1:22:45] wisdom sends our way. God sends your
[1:22:49] trials. He customize it for you. And
[1:22:51] when you get them, you got to shout.
[1:22:53] Give God a praise. Give a dance.
[1:22:57] No, the devil say you're crazy because
[1:23:00] not only you're praising God and you're
[1:23:01] dancing too. And everybody know you're
[1:23:03] supposed to be frustrated. You're
[1:23:05] supposed to be depressed. You're
[1:23:06] supposed to be upset. You're supposed to
[1:23:07] be down in the dumps. But you're giving
[1:23:09] God praise
[1:23:10] anyhow. Give the Lord some
[1:23:12] praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:18] Hallelujah. Let me ask you a question.
[1:23:20] What time in prison you think you should
[1:23:21] praise God when you're wrongly feeling
[1:23:23] imprisoned?
[1:23:25] Do you do it in morning time, midday?
[1:23:28] After eat, after
[1:23:29] breakfast at midnight, Paul and Paul
[1:23:32] have to at midnight. That when man
[1:23:35] supposed to be sleeping, man supposed to
[1:23:36] be tired. That when they get in real
[1:23:38] mind battles, you know, them show off
[1:23:41] mind battles and say, "Hallelujah.
[1:23:42] Glory." And as I worship God and as they
[1:23:45] worship, as their praises go up, angels
[1:23:47] have to come down and and bust the door
[1:23:50] open. And them fellas walk out of prison
[1:23:52] normal, normal, normal while praising
[1:23:55] God. You don't wait to be free to praise
[1:23:57] him. You praise him to be free. You
[1:23:59] praise him when you're in bondage. You
[1:24:01] praise him when you're in prison. You
[1:24:03] praise him when you're looking all
[1:24:04] messed up, tied up, tangled up. You give
[1:24:06] God praise because praising him is not
[1:24:08] about you. It's about who he is. Come
[1:24:10] on, give the Lord a shout. Worship is
[1:24:12] not about you. It's about who he is. He
[1:24:15] is God this morning. There is none like
[1:24:17] him in all the earth. I love him. I love
[1:24:19] him. I love him. I want to serve him.
[1:24:21] Serve him. Serve him. Oh God, he brought
[1:24:23] me out. He kept me. He kept you. Come
[1:24:26] on, give the Lord some praises.
[1:24:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[1:24:31] you don't praise him when you get out.
[1:24:32] You praise him before you get out. You
[1:24:34] give him a shout before you get out.
[1:24:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:24:38] Amen, brother Brandham. Amen. So watch.
[1:24:42] Law is a policeman that put you in jail,
[1:24:44] but redemption is the one who paid your
[1:24:46] fine. Hallelujah. Out of into. Then on
[1:24:49] spiritual food in due season, he said,
[1:24:50] "Thanks be to God. We got hidden food,
[1:24:52] spiritual food. We are living on the
[1:24:54] goodness and the mercy of the revelation
[1:24:56] of Jesus Christ in this last days,
[1:24:57] vindicating himself before his people.
[1:25:00] Now is now is a time of coming out and
[1:25:03] going in. Getting out of the those
[1:25:06] organizations and getting into Christ.
[1:25:09] are coming out and going in time for all
[1:25:12] true believers. Do you believe that? So
[1:25:15] therefore, you have no right by no
[1:25:16] minister fight by no pastor fight and
[1:25:18] you're not fighting for me at all. We
[1:25:20] don't have that here. All right. All
[1:25:23] right. James
[1:25:25] 4:8-10. Hear these words. Draw nigh to
[1:25:29] God and he will draw nigh to you.
[1:25:32] So if you stay where you are and you're
[1:25:34] not drawing nigh, he watching you too.
[1:25:37] All you watch one another.
[1:25:39] You watch him and he watching you. This
[1:25:42] is a order here. Do you accept this as a
[1:25:45] order? Draw nigh to God. Somebody tell
[1:25:48] you go by brother. Draw nigh to brother.
[1:25:51] I told him in the garden I said they s I
[1:25:55] said listen I'm not eating anybody
[1:25:57] today. So come
[1:26:00] closer. I said this minister is not
[1:26:02] going to eat anybody. I'm not that
[1:26:04] hungry.
[1:26:06] So you could come closer. You'd rather
[1:26:08] stay so far. You draw near. Now if you
[1:26:10] want to draw near to God, you talk to
[1:26:12] him. If you make an effort one step, you
[1:26:16] make one step, he make one step. You
[1:26:18] make another step, he make another step.
[1:26:20] Draw nigh unto me, I'll draw nigh unto
[1:26:22] you. If you stay where you are, you you
[1:26:24] stay where you are. All right, here we
[1:26:26] go. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners.
[1:26:30] Purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be
[1:26:33] afflicted and mourn and weep. Let your
[1:26:36] laughter be turned into mourning, your
[1:26:38] joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in
[1:26:41] the sight of God. He shall lift you up.
[1:26:43] Listen to the amplified. Come close to
[1:26:45] God. He will come close to you.
[1:26:48] Recognize that you are sinners. Get your
[1:26:52] soiled hands clean. Realize that you
[1:26:55] have been disloyal, wavering individuals
[1:26:58] with divided interest. Purify your
[1:27:01] hearts of your spiritual adultery.
[1:27:04] Amen. You're supposed to be married to
[1:27:06] Christ, but you have an ex woman
[1:27:07] outside. You have a wife, but you have
[1:27:09] somebody in the closet and he's supposed
[1:27:11] to be dead. Do you see that? The old
[1:27:15] man, we supposed to kill him, you know,
[1:27:17] not bury him and or have him in the
[1:27:18] closet. Hey, come back out. Have a party
[1:27:21] tonight. You understand I'm saying? And
[1:27:24] well, you know, I went church this
[1:27:25] morning, so go back in the closet.
[1:27:31] I wear long dress because it's church
[1:27:32] and afterwards you bring out the old
[1:27:33] man. He went mini.
[1:27:36] So that's the one you escorting out with
[1:27:38] that man supposed to be buried.
[1:27:43] And a man only awaken dead. You seen any
[1:27:45] box there and you say if you if you go
[1:27:47] box say the man okay watch it that man
[1:27:50] not dead. You know is the man talk back
[1:27:52] to you in that box? He's not dead.
[1:27:56] When you talk to a dead man in a box,
[1:27:58] you're supposed to have no response.
[1:28:00] That's how God want us. No response.
[1:28:04] Somebody back at you. Yeah. Back back at
[1:28:06] them. Somebody cuss you. Yeah. C them
[1:28:07] back. You're still alive.
[1:28:09] When you're dead, no response. He open
[1:28:13] not his mouth. That is when we grow in.
[1:28:17] That is when we mature in because it's
[1:28:19] less of you and more of him. It's not an
[1:28:21] overnight thing. Is it Kentucky Fried
[1:28:23] Chicken?
[1:28:26] This is not frying and dropping in here.
[1:28:28] No, this is process.
[1:28:32] But Anthony struck something. He said,
[1:28:34] but and this is this is beautiful. If
[1:28:37] you want to bring forth fruit, you have
[1:28:39] to be willing to be pruned.
[1:28:43] It's not a vacuum cleaner God using. No,
[1:28:46] it's not getting the dust off of here.
[1:28:47] You know, it's a pruning knife.
[1:28:53] It cutting
[1:28:55] And you have to be willing to be cut.
[1:28:57] What's the what's the purpose behind the
[1:28:58] cutting? To produce more fruit.
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:03] God don't want to damage you and mash
[1:29:05] you up and like no. So it says here now
[1:29:08] amplified. He said as you watch as you
[1:29:11] journey near to God be deeply penitent
[1:29:14] and grieve even weep over your
[1:29:16] disloyalty. Let your laughter be turned
[1:29:18] to grief your mirth to dejection and
[1:29:20] heartfelt shame for your sins. Humble
[1:29:24] yourselves feeling very insignificant in
[1:29:27] the presence of the Lord and he will
[1:29:29] exalt you. He will lift you up and make
[1:29:32] your lives significant.
[1:29:34] Oh, this is beautiful this morning.
[1:29:36] Humble yourself. But Brandham said that
[1:29:39] usually when somebody get blessed they
[1:29:40] get puffed up. Be individual or church
[1:29:43] afterwards they feel on top of the
[1:29:45] mountain. They are it. And you remember
[1:29:49] that Nebuchadnezzar when he say even
[1:29:52] this what I have built
[1:29:55] when he said that God says seven years
[1:29:57] eat grass seven years
[1:30:02] nails God alone and when he catch back
[1:30:04] himself he said to bless God yes he come
[1:30:06] out eat foolishness even this that I
[1:30:08] have built you build what you you
[1:30:11] understand what I'm saying then he
[1:30:12] humbled himself and God come bless him
[1:30:14] all right let's go in John chapter 17:14
[1:30:17] when I was studying this last night.
[1:30:19] This was such an amazing journey. I've
[1:30:20] known the scripture for so long. And
[1:30:22] Jesus is praying
[1:30:24] here. Listen to Jesus pray. I have given
[1:30:26] them thy word. Amen. And the world had
[1:30:29] hated them because they are not of the
[1:30:32] world. Amen. Even as I am not of the
[1:30:34] world. Amen. They haven't received the
[1:30:36] Holy Ghost yet. And look at this
[1:30:38] powerful prayer that Jesus is praying. I
[1:30:42] pray not that thou shouldest take them
[1:30:43] out of the world, but that thou
[1:30:45] shouldest keep them from evil. So he's
[1:30:47] not taking asking for exit. Stop the
[1:30:50] world. I want to get off. He's not
[1:30:52] talking that kind of talk. He said keep
[1:30:53] them. Let them have be right here but
[1:30:56] keep them. Preserve them from evil. You
[1:30:58] hear what you have to pray for. It have
[1:31:00] evil. You know, that's why you have to
[1:31:02] pray for your children. You know,
[1:31:04] understand this. Your children might not
[1:31:05] be evil, but it have evil out there. You
[1:31:07] have to cover them. Pray for your
[1:31:09] husband. Pray for your wife. Pray for
[1:31:12] your family because there's attacks
[1:31:15] everywhere.
[1:31:16] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:31:19] We wrestled against flesh and blood. We
[1:31:21] in a battle this morning. You are
[1:31:23] sitting down by somebody you could see,
[1:31:24] but there are other forces at work.
[1:31:30] They are not of the world. They They are
[1:31:33] not converted yet. They're still in the
[1:31:34] Holy Ghost yet. Listen to what Jesus is
[1:31:36] praying. They are not of the world even
[1:31:41] as I am not of the world. Sanctify them
[1:31:44] through thy truth. He's talking about
[1:31:46] process. Now thy word is truth. As thou
[1:31:50] has sent me into the world, even so I
[1:31:53] have also sent them into the world. He
[1:31:55] considered as passed. He considers as
[1:31:58] done and they get the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:32:01] Let's continue. And for their sakes,
[1:32:04] hear the statement. I
[1:32:08] sanctify myself
[1:32:10] that they also might be sanctified to
[1:32:13] the truth.
[1:32:15] That is such a sublime statement. Jesus
[1:32:18] who could get a wife. Jesus who could do
[1:32:20] so much different things. He say I
[1:32:23] sanctify myself that they might also be
[1:32:26] sanctified through the truth. In other
[1:32:28] words, I am making a sacrifice to be
[1:32:31] holy unto God on their behalf that they
[1:32:34] too will be sanctified. What is he
[1:32:36] doing? Just as I am to the father, I
[1:32:39] want to be to the son. Give the Lord
[1:32:41] some praises.
[1:32:43] Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] Jesus went deeper. Neither pray I for
[1:32:48] these alone, but for them also which
[1:32:51] shall believe on me through their word.
[1:32:55] What's the purpose? That they all may be
[1:32:58] one. So the target or the destination or
[1:33:03] the bullseye is that we be one. Not just
[1:33:06] one vague one, but watch this. as thou,
[1:33:10] Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
[1:33:14] they also may be one in us, that the
[1:33:17] world may believe that thou has sent me.
[1:33:20] Hallelujah. So oneness with God brings
[1:33:24] evidence to the world that Jesus was
[1:33:28] sent. He is raised from the dead because
[1:33:31] we have a new life. And our life now
[1:33:34] give evidence that he is truly raised
[1:33:36] from the dead. We are not following a
[1:33:38] religion. We not following a man. We
[1:33:40] have been born again and we have been
[1:33:42] born and placed as righteous on the
[1:33:44] earth. Oh give the Lord some praises.
[1:33:48] Hallelujah. That the all may be one as
[1:33:50] thou Father art in me and I in thee.
[1:33:53] That the ocean may be one in us. That
[1:33:55] the world may believe that thou has sent
[1:33:57] me. And the glory which thou has giest
[1:34:00] me I have given them that they may be
[1:34:02] one even as we are one. Amen. Then you
[1:34:05] go deeper. I in them, thou in me, that
[1:34:07] they may be made perfect in one, that
[1:34:09] the world may know that thou has sent me
[1:34:12] and has loved me as and and has loved
[1:34:14] them as thou has loved me. Oh God, he
[1:34:16] said, as you have loved them as you love
[1:34:18] me. The same love you expressed to me is
[1:34:20] what you have for them. These are my
[1:34:22] people. Oh, glory to God. These are my
[1:34:25] sons and daughters. How you feel this
[1:34:27] morning? How do you feel about this
[1:34:28] gospel this morning? How do you feel
[1:34:30] about this God that we serving this
[1:34:32] morning?
[1:34:36] Father, I will that they also whom thou
[1:34:40] has given me be with me.
[1:34:45] Remember what he brought him out to? He
[1:34:47] brought him unto himself. Jesus said,
[1:34:50] "Father, I will that they also whom thou
[1:34:52] has given me be with me, that where I
[1:34:55] am, that they may behold my glory which
[1:34:59] thou has given me, for thou lovest me
[1:35:01] before the foundation of the world."
[1:35:03] Give the Lord some praises. What a
[1:35:05] prayer. That's our Jesus praying. Oh,
[1:35:09] glory to God. That we be one. Oh, glory
[1:35:12] to God. That he going to be in us. We
[1:35:13] going to be in him. We will be abiding
[1:35:15] in him. You don't want to be in and out.
[1:35:17] In and out. You're in church today,
[1:35:19] you're out tomorrow. You're in, you're
[1:35:20] out. You're in, you're out. You don't
[1:35:21] want to be like that. You want to be
[1:35:22] like a pillar in the house of God. You
[1:35:24] want to be abiding in his. You want to
[1:35:25] be in that abiding glory. You want to be
[1:35:27] in that abiding presence that's in the
[1:35:29] inner veil where the glory never fail.
[1:35:31] The veil drop behind you and the world
[1:35:33] is cut off and you are sealed by the
[1:35:35] Holy Ghost. Oh, in the most holy place.
[1:35:39] Glory to God. One time Aaron forgot his
[1:35:41] rod inside of there and that rod bud and
[1:35:44] blossom and brought forth fruit. Where
[1:35:45] at? In the presence of God. And in his
[1:35:48] presence is where we going to produce
[1:35:49] fruit. And the devil trying to cut you
[1:35:52] off from presence. That's what sin does.
[1:35:54] That's what unbelief does. It cuts you
[1:35:56] off from presence. Oh, give the Lord
[1:35:57] some praise. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:36:00] But God want to bring you into presence.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah.
[1:36:04] Amen. So we said this before. The entire
[1:36:06] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:36:09] in Christ. The entire Bible, here we go,
[1:36:11] is an expression of one goal that God
[1:36:14] had. One purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:36:17] the entire Bible. And all the acts of
[1:36:20] the believers in the Bible has been in
[1:36:22] type
[1:36:24] expressing what that great goal is. So
[1:36:28] we know Jesus when he had his
[1:36:30] resurrection ministry he appeared to his
[1:36:33] disciples and he expounded unto them in
[1:36:37] all scriptures the thing pertaining to
[1:36:39] himself. So Jesus here we go listen had
[1:36:42] a three and a half years public ministry
[1:36:44] with his disciples to everybody healing
[1:36:47] the sick raising the dead but when he
[1:36:49] rose from the dead it was no longer
[1:36:51] public. Amen. It was a private ministry
[1:36:54] to those believers to unveil the book of
[1:36:57] the seals of the Old Testament to reveal
[1:37:00] who he was, who he is and the prophecies
[1:37:03] concerning himself, not about them, not
[1:37:06] about the pope and Rome and what not
[1:37:08] himself because that is what the book
[1:37:10] was about. The book was about Christ.
[1:37:13] The book was about Jesus. So the Bible
[1:37:15] said he expounded to them all the
[1:37:17] scriptures concerning himself. And then
[1:37:20] he said, "These are the words which I
[1:37:22] spake unto you while I was yet with you,
[1:37:24] that all things must be fulfilled, which
[1:37:26] were written in the law of Moses and in
[1:37:27] the prophets and in the Psalms
[1:37:29] concerning me." And then he opened their
[1:37:31] understanding that they might understand
[1:37:33] the scriptures. Oh, glory to God. So now
[1:37:36] they know exactly who they are. They
[1:37:38] know who he is. They know what they are
[1:37:41] about. So when he said tiring the city
[1:37:43] of Jerusalem until you endure with power
[1:37:45] from high, they knew it was coming. They
[1:37:48] don't know when, but they know it's
[1:37:49] coming. Dynamics is coming. We don't
[1:37:52] know when, but it's coming. Power is
[1:37:54] coming. We don't know when, but it's
[1:37:56] coming. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:38:00] Hallelujah.
[1:38:01] [Applause]
[1:38:09] Right now, America has about four or so
[1:38:11] B2 bombers over island in
[1:38:15] Asia. These bombers are called flying
[1:38:19] wings. These are stealth bombers. You
[1:38:22] can't pick them up. You can't see them,
[1:38:25] but they coming.
[1:38:28] They setting to start a whole war in the
[1:38:30] Middle East.
[1:38:32] The president of America say if Iran
[1:38:35] don't make a deal,
[1:38:38] they'd be bummed like never before.
[1:38:40] That man going and scratch a match and
[1:38:42] you don't know what going to explode and
[1:38:44] blow up.
[1:38:47] We are going through troubles times.
[1:38:50] What did Jesus say? When you shall hear
[1:38:52] wars, the end is not yet because nations
[1:38:56] shall rise against nation. There shall
[1:38:58] be wars and rumors of wars. There shall
[1:39:00] be earthquakes and pestilence but the
[1:39:02] end is not yet. He said this gospel,
[1:39:06] this gospel shall be preached and then
[1:39:10] shall the end come how much bombers they
[1:39:13] have. I much wars they have until we
[1:39:16] come to this place to loose this gospel
[1:39:19] and get them doom devils on the run.
[1:39:22] That'll wait. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:39:25] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:28] This gospel going to be preached. And
[1:39:31] the gospel is not a word only. It's not
[1:39:33] teaching. It's not unfolding a mystery.
[1:39:36] It's not a five hour teaching service.
[1:39:38] That's not the gospel we're talking
[1:39:39] about. The gospel is to manifest the
[1:39:41] gospel, to prove the power, to vindicate
[1:39:44] the word. Oh, glory to God. Preach the
[1:39:46] gospel to every creature. Preach it to
[1:39:49] the bulls. Oh, preach it to the bees.
[1:39:52] Every creature, give the Lord a shout.
[1:39:55] Preachers to the aposum. Preachers to
[1:39:58] the fish. Little fish. I give you back
[1:40:00] your life. Every creature. Little sister
[1:40:05] right. I give you to your two boys. Oh,
[1:40:07] give the Lord a shout. This gospel going
[1:40:10] to be preached. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Preach it to the maniac. Oh, give the
[1:40:15] Lord a shout. Preach it to the blind.
[1:40:18] Preach it to the halt.
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:21] [Applause]
[1:40:24] Glory to God. Glory to God. This gospel
[1:40:27] have to be preached. Jesus went to the
[1:40:30] other side and cast out a thousand
[1:40:32] devils. He preached a man that nobody
[1:40:35] could hold. This gospel going to be
[1:40:37] preached. Devils are going to be cast
[1:40:39] out. The sick is going to be healed. The
[1:40:41] devil going to be raised up. The deaf
[1:40:43] going to hear. The blind going to see.
[1:40:46] This gospel will be preached. And the
[1:40:48] Lord
[1:40:49] himself went everywhere with them
[1:40:52] confirming the word with signs
[1:40:54] following. Could we give the Lord a
[1:40:56] shout in the house? You shout and praise
[1:40:58] him
[1:41:00] [Applause]
[1:41:13] tabernacle. Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] [Applause]
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:34] Hallelujah. us. You be foolish. You put
[1:41:38] your head in the sand and saying, you
[1:41:40] know, like a child behind the wall say
[1:41:41] nobody seeing me.
[1:41:44] Because you closing your eyes. Thank
[1:41:45] you, Lord.
[1:41:47] Praise the Lord. Open your eyes, you
[1:41:49] know.
[1:41:53] Everything is changing, you know.
[1:41:56] And if you don't change, change will
[1:41:57] change around you. But you can't stop
[1:42:00] change. You can't stop time. You don't
[1:42:03] hold time in your hands. You don't have
[1:42:04] time. We don't own time. Oh my. Glory to
[1:42:09] God. Hallelujah.
[1:42:12] Hallelujah. So the first thing, first
[1:42:17] full of God's purpose, he wanted to
[1:42:20] reveal himself to the people. It's a
[1:42:22] tough thing because he's omnipotent.
[1:42:26] He's omniscient. Hallelujah. Like I said
[1:42:29] already, if our aunts could talk and our
[1:42:32] aunts have placard and protested and
[1:42:34] say, "Hey, you do wicked." And he
[1:42:37] watching up and telling me that
[1:42:40] ants and the ants are placard
[1:42:42] protesting. He got a whole bunch from
[1:42:45] the ants nest. A whole of them marching,
[1:42:47] marching, marching up and down, up and
[1:42:48] down. Protesting is the government of
[1:42:51] humans.
[1:42:55] One walk on the chief agitator.
[1:43:04] So at the end of the party you know and
[1:43:07] scatter you know
[1:43:10] that is how we are. So I just making a
[1:43:12] comparison we are to this omnipotent
[1:43:14] being. How do I reveal myself to these
[1:43:18] people that have fallen
[1:43:21] these people that are tuned to the
[1:43:23] senses feet taste smell touch.
[1:43:28] As we say in the beginning, the first
[1:43:30] man, Genesis man, God never talked about
[1:43:31] eating anything else. That man no boy to
[1:43:34] eat. He just tell that man have
[1:43:36] dominion. The spirit man Genesis 1,
[1:43:39] Genesis 2, he formed man out of the dust
[1:43:41] of the earth. He put the spirit man in
[1:43:42] this dust man. The man could talk now.
[1:43:44] The man have a body now. There's no man
[1:43:46] to the soil. The man could eat now. Then
[1:43:47] God talk about eating the fruit. Eat
[1:43:50] every tree because we have to go through
[1:43:52] the process to renew our bodies and mind
[1:43:54] everything else. He told the man that
[1:43:57] So to get further to deal with what's
[1:44:00] coming, God had to equip us.
[1:44:03] First he had to equip it with his word.
[1:44:05] What the prophet said, the secret is the
[1:44:06] word is in the bride. So God had to put
[1:44:09] the word first in you. Because when he
[1:44:10] tried to use the Pentecostal because
[1:44:12] they have no word, that's why they're
[1:44:13] sinning up to today because they reject
[1:44:15] the word and all they have this gifts.
[1:44:17] So the Pentecostal, they have nothing in
[1:44:19] them.
[1:44:21] They have $30,000 church and they still
[1:44:23] run a woman. 30,000 people members in
[1:44:26] the church. Money, car, everything else
[1:44:27] is still corrupt as ever. Because so
[1:44:29] afterwards, God said, "No, I'm not going
[1:44:31] to do that no more. I want character." I
[1:44:33] was sending a prophet to bring a word.
[1:44:35] And that word will bring you into trials
[1:44:36] and testings. And because character is
[1:44:38] not a gift, it's a victory. So what you
[1:44:40] go through is what produce the strength
[1:44:42] in you, the courage in you, the guts in
[1:44:44] you. Character is not a
[1:44:46] gift. You don't get a gift of character.
[1:44:49] You go through stuff and you get
[1:44:51] character. So when you see somebody with
[1:44:52] character, you know they went through
[1:44:54] hell and high waters. You know they went
[1:44:55] through stuff.
[1:45:00] So now God is not using individuals. He
[1:45:02] using the word in individuals and that
[1:45:04] word can't fail. That's why the bride
[1:45:07] can't fail because the word is what? You
[1:45:10] are not even the believer. The word in
[1:45:12] you is the believer. There is something
[1:45:13] in you that believe the word. You can't
[1:45:15] even explain it. Even if you're better
[1:45:17] than you know there's something about
[1:45:19] this word it connects to you.
[1:45:23] Let me say it to you good. He said you
[1:45:25] have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:45:27] you. You say Lord I messed up you. I
[1:45:29] still chose you.
[1:45:34] So your messed up condition is
[1:45:35] stumbling. Oh God like I chose the wrong
[1:45:38] person. God is not in this business. You
[1:45:40] know God God not in that you know when
[1:45:42] God pick you pick you. Now
[1:45:45] when Moses went to Egyp when Moses went
[1:45:47] to Egypt spent 40 years get wife and
[1:45:49] children and he start getting furniture
[1:45:51] from courts or whatever it is buy
[1:45:53] furniture and house and what when God
[1:45:55] ready for Moses God send the pillar of
[1:45:57] fire up there Moses said going and see
[1:45:58] he thought it was a normal day you know
[1:46:00] when he come back and she expect him to
[1:46:02] take the plastic off you know when
[1:46:04] furniture get plastic off of it when she
[1:46:06] expect him to take plastic off of the
[1:46:08] furniture Moses said we're going to
[1:46:10] Egypt she said you got to be kidding
[1:46:13] when she looking for house preparation
[1:46:14] and house rearrangement and changing
[1:46:16] colors and the paint and whatnot. Moses
[1:46:17] said, "Eg Egypt, you going, you know,
[1:46:19] she had to pack up and leave her back,
[1:46:20] you know, there's a great commission
[1:46:22] here." You know, he said, "Where you
[1:46:24] going?" She said, "I'm going I'm going
[1:46:25] to take over." Anybody hearing that man
[1:46:27] talk like she a mad man. He was no mad
[1:46:28] man. He met God. And when you meet God,
[1:46:31] anything that could happen, all things
[1:46:32] are possible. You go past your
[1:46:34] limitations. You pass your hindrances.
[1:46:37] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:49] God going to bless you. Amen. Till the
[1:46:51] cup run over. Not only that, you know,
[1:46:54] let me prophesy over you. God going to
[1:46:56] be a table for you in the presence of
[1:46:58] your enemies. That is to set the table.
[1:47:02] Put the tablecloth. Put the napkins. Put
[1:47:04] the dishes. Put the fork. I forget on
[1:47:06] the right and the left. I know them. I
[1:47:08] didn't even know how to do that. Put the
[1:47:09] left on the right and put the fork on
[1:47:10] everything else. Put the cake. Put
[1:47:12] everything and pull the chair and let
[1:47:14] you sit down and let your enemies see
[1:47:16] you eat. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:47:20] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:47:22] David said, "If he prepares a table for
[1:47:24] me in the presence of my enemies, my
[1:47:26] cup, run it over, surely goodness and
[1:47:31] mercy shall follow me." And they follow
[1:47:35] it. They follow me wherever I go. Mercy
[1:47:39] goodness following me all the days of my
[1:47:42] life and I shall dwell in the house of
[1:47:45] the Lord forever. Give the Lord the
[1:47:46] praises. This is satisfaction
[1:47:48] guaranteed. Oh, glory to God. This is
[1:47:50] blessed assurance. Hallelujah.
[1:47:53] Hallelujah.
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:57] Protection guaranteed.
[1:48:00] We see when you're a prime minister, you
[1:48:02] have certain things afforded to you
[1:48:05] because of your office. You have
[1:48:06] security. Parame just walk out the house
[1:48:08] like so. You think president just
[1:48:10] walking out there somebody kill him. You
[1:48:12] can't just walk out feel when you shop
[1:48:14] and take a taxi that not working. You
[1:48:18] have to have security. So because of who
[1:48:20] you are, you you do you do you know you
[1:48:22] have security.
[1:48:24] You think you ordinary you know you
[1:48:26] watch angels protecting you on the
[1:48:27] street
[1:48:30] from car accidents all kind of thing.
[1:48:32] God protecting
[1:48:34] you. Here's why. Here's why. The devil
[1:48:37] is not afraid of what you are normally.
[1:48:39] The devil's afraid of what you going to
[1:48:40] be. So he want to cut off you at the
[1:48:43] potential level because you a know
[1:48:45] sometime who you are. But God know who
[1:48:47] you are. That's why God call you and the
[1:48:49] devil not sure. That's why he asked
[1:48:51] Jesus if thou be if thou be if thou be
[1:48:53] if thou be. He's not sure about us. But
[1:48:55] we got to be know who we are. Oh glory
[1:48:57] to God. We got to know who we are and
[1:48:59] whose we are tonight. Give the Lord some
[1:49:02] praises.
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:07] Hallelujah. God's
[1:49:09] objective. So church is supposed to be a
[1:49:12] means by which people connect to God,
[1:49:15] not a means that people shut down in
[1:49:17] church and they meet God. All they meet
[1:49:19] is the pastor. Pastor playing God. That
[1:49:23] is troubling us. Say if you want to be
[1:49:24] friends with God, threw off his throne.
[1:49:27] You run up and sit on your throne
[1:49:29] playing God.
[1:49:32] You serping God's power and authority.
[1:49:33] And God says, "Leave people to posture.
[1:49:38] Let them take the Instagram pictures.
[1:49:40] Leave them right there." David and all
[1:49:42] their get problems. He say, "Lord, all
[1:49:43] these wicked prospering s." David say,
[1:49:46] "Have you," God say, "Have you
[1:49:47] considered the end?
[1:49:49] They're looking good now. They're
[1:49:50] looking sharp now." But where's the
[1:49:52] endgame of that?
[1:49:56] So God wanted to reveal himself because
[1:49:59] he couldn't do it as Jehovah, God who
[1:50:01] covered all space and time and eternity.
[1:50:03] it'll be too mysterious. So he loved
[1:50:05] fatherhood and therefore that's why he
[1:50:08] sent Christ so that
[1:50:10] Christ which is the word made flesh
[1:50:13] becomes the revelation of God. Amen. So
[1:50:17] this grace mystery which is this book
[1:50:20] the word actually become flesh.
[1:50:25] You know I was in church years ago and
[1:50:26] every time the pastor come in after a
[1:50:27] couple of months you learn a
[1:50:29] foundation. I was 17 18 at the time and
[1:50:33] in my mind I say how long is this
[1:50:35] foundation going to be laid when I when
[1:50:39] we start to build the building always
[1:50:41] every so often I'm laying a foundation
[1:50:43] I'm laying a foundation but we're going
[1:50:45] down maybe it's a very very deep
[1:50:47] foundation because all you hear is word
[1:50:52] word and I am looking for the word to be
[1:50:55] made flesh like that child with the
[1:50:58] lightning mother tell him God with you.
[1:51:01] Say, "Mommy, I want to sleep by you."
[1:51:03] Said, "When the lightning come," he
[1:51:05] said, "Don't worry, worry." God said,
[1:51:06] "I'll never leave, never forsake you."
[1:51:08] She said, "Mommy, when the lightning
[1:51:09] come and that thunder rolling so hard, I
[1:51:10] want God with some flesh on his
[1:51:14] You see the words from the parent
[1:51:16] telling the child, God is with you." The
[1:51:19] child getting frightened with lightning
[1:51:20] and thunder. He want God with flesh in
[1:51:23] it. He want mommy. That is legitimate.
[1:51:26] When Jesus come, God become tangible.
[1:51:29] So the woman with the blood issue when
[1:51:31] she touched the hem of his garment she
[1:51:33] was made whole God being made real
[1:51:37] that you could be touched sir he raised
[1:51:40] the dead he cast out devils God made
[1:51:42] real a question are we going to see that
[1:51:45] God made real again that's what we need
[1:51:48] to see you know look how Jesus handled
[1:51:50] one well he sent his disciples away you
[1:51:52] know the disciples couldn't handle I
[1:51:54] believe Jesus knew the disciples
[1:51:56] couldn't handle what he had to do so he
[1:51:58] came at the well, nothing to draw with
[1:52:00] cuz not was not a pipe you know you open
[1:52:03] pipe and get water. No, you had to come
[1:52:05] with a bucket draw it and pull it up. So
[1:52:08] he's sitting at the well because he have
[1:52:09] nothing to draw with. He waiting for the
[1:52:12] woman. Her name is on the book. She
[1:52:14] don't know. Right now she living a slack
[1:52:16] life, her name is on the book. He is the
[1:52:19] book. He has her name. He could call her
[1:52:23] out. I I don't know about you, but I
[1:52:25] feel a shout this morning.
[1:52:28] So when she comes at the well, he begin
[1:52:30] to speak to her. And then he get down to
[1:52:32] brass now. He want to go inside of her
[1:52:34] now in a spirit. He said go call your
[1:52:36] husband. Amen. And when she have none,
[1:52:37] she said you had five. The one you're
[1:52:39] living with is not yours.
[1:52:42] That's how truly. Then she started to
[1:52:43] talk religious talk. We know they say
[1:52:45] Jerusale is the place we ought to
[1:52:46] worship. And Jesus said, listen woman,
[1:52:48] the hour coming now is when the true
[1:52:50] worshippers, true worshippers, not them
[1:52:52] dead believers in the message about true
[1:52:53] worshippers now.
[1:52:56] Hitting home. I want to hear him. Not
[1:52:59] them dead people in your message. No,
[1:53:00] no, no. True worshippers will worship
[1:53:02] the father. That's relationship now.
[1:53:04] That's acknowledging he is your father.
[1:53:06] Not worshiping church. Worshiping the
[1:53:08] father in spirit and in truth. God sent
[1:53:13] the truth by a messenger. Then we have
[1:53:14] to get in the spirit to truly worship
[1:53:16] God. When Jesus finished with her, she
[1:53:18] ran. That is when it have effect upon
[1:53:20] you. You know, you can't walk home after
[1:53:22] that. You know, nah, you got to be
[1:53:24] excited after that. You know, you can't
[1:53:25] sit down dead after that. You know, you
[1:53:27] get activated. She ran and said, "Come
[1:53:29] see a man who told me all that I did.
[1:53:32] Isn't this the Christ?" Listen, that
[1:53:34] woman was free. That's why she ran.
[1:53:36] That's why she could testify. That's why
[1:53:38] she gave her testimony. She was free.
[1:53:42] And who does Solomon set free? Is free
[1:53:45] indeed. Are you free this morning? Oh,
[1:53:47] give the Lord some praises because God
[1:53:49] want you free. Hallelujah. Don't want it
[1:53:52] tied up and tangled up and oppressed.
[1:53:54] God want you with no liberty.
[1:53:56] Hallelujah. Amen. So the first purpose
[1:53:59] he had was to bring his people to reveal
[1:54:01] himself to them. That's why it was so
[1:54:04] terrible. They come out of Egypt, come
[1:54:06] to the Red Sea, come to the mountain.
[1:54:09] Moses going off to the Lord to talk
[1:54:10] about God. They seen the light on the
[1:54:12] mountain. And because they find Moses in
[1:54:15] too long, they say, "Aaron,
[1:54:18] Aaron, make us a god." Aaron say, "Well,
[1:54:22] you're crazy. What? Moses gone say
[1:54:26] Aaron we don't know if the man dead up
[1:54:29] there
[1:54:32] reason started going it's true you know
[1:54:36] look how long he gone
[1:54:39] they start to bring earrings and rings
[1:54:41] and bracelet and gold and gold and look
[1:54:44] what he make a calf
[1:54:48] a Egyptian golden calf the
[1:54:51] dancing carnival Al party, the drinking
[1:54:55] all the beers and the
[1:54:57] booze. When Moses come down, he talk.
[1:55:00] You want to know what is that? These
[1:55:02] people just leave Egypt.
[1:55:06] They come out of Egypt. But Egypt's
[1:55:08] still in them.
[1:55:11] How much people in the message? They
[1:55:14] only come out with a punch. They have
[1:55:16] not gone in. Amen. They come out and
[1:55:19] find theel in fellowships. Are you
[1:55:22] fellowshipping by this church and this
[1:55:23] tabernacle and this tabernacle and this
[1:55:24] tabernacle and this is tabernacle. But
[1:55:27] why don't you come into Christ?
[1:55:29] Because when you get into Christ, it
[1:55:31] doesn't matter what church you're in.
[1:55:32] Amen. Because when they shut the church
[1:55:34] down, you still have to be in Christ.
[1:55:39] Hallelujah.
[1:55:42] The stock market lost about $3 trillion
[1:55:44] trillion this week alone.
[1:55:47] Richest man in the world lost 12
[1:55:48] billion. You can count that there a lot
[1:55:51] of zeros. But he's so rich that that's
[1:55:53] just a tip of the iceberg.
[1:55:57] But I always used to talk about the
[1:55:59] world economy has to break to bring on
[1:56:02] the new beast system. It will change.
[1:56:06] It's happening right before our eyes.
[1:56:08] Things are changing so fast. Is the pace
[1:56:11] at which things changing? You know, I
[1:56:13] had to ask the question, what about us?
[1:56:16] Are we moving too slow? What about the
[1:56:18] pace of the church supposed to be? Are
[1:56:20] you concerned? Are you burdened? Do you
[1:56:22] want to see this thing become a reality?
[1:56:24] Because the only way we could vindicate
[1:56:26] Malachi 4 is for this word to become
[1:56:28] flesh in us.
[1:56:30] Let me drop this bomb on you. The word
[1:56:32] was invisible until it became flesh.
[1:56:36] Amen. So all this mighty talk and people
[1:56:38] who think they're adopted and think
[1:56:39] there's this like some of them fellas
[1:56:41] and them who when co come this all the
[1:56:42] power they claim they
[1:56:46] have co put them out of business you
[1:56:48] know some of them died fighting you with
[1:56:52] the power they thought they had but yet
[1:56:55] but I'm talking about we are striving to
[1:56:57] enter the kingdom of god before these
[1:56:59] plague strike co was a down payment you
[1:57:02] know more of that coming
[1:57:05] more plagues are coming amen I'm not
[1:57:07] prophesying like if I'm prophesying in
[1:57:09] the air you know this is the reality he
[1:57:11] said we are looking for the
[1:57:12] manifestation of the sons of God that
[1:57:14] would stop cancer stop tumor stop the
[1:57:17] diseases that is coming
[1:57:24] remember when this co started out they
[1:57:26] had no inoc no vaccine had to fight up
[1:57:28] and hustle a vaccine and the vaccine all
[1:57:30] kind of crazy things are you don't know
[1:57:31] what
[1:57:34] but what coming that might be worse
[1:57:38] I'm going to say we go be the vaccine.
[1:57:42] The bride will have to have the power to
[1:57:45] deal with that. Could you imagine the
[1:57:47] next disease come only bride have power
[1:57:48] to deal with that in the name of Jesus.
[1:57:51] The power of God in the church shaking
[1:57:54] and rocking
[1:57:57] people lining outside because they want
[1:57:58] to be healed. They want to be delivered.
[1:58:01] They want to be free. Oh, give the Lord
[1:58:04] some praises.
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:08] of them say people are looking to die.
[1:58:12] Somebody night they looking a box.
[1:58:15] Nobody talks to you. They're dying. They
[1:58:18] getting old. Where my box? My box ready.
[1:58:21] Nobody talking that way. You want to
[1:58:23] live in. Oh my my my my my.
[1:58:28] So let if he abide in me, abide.
[1:58:31] Hallelujah.
[1:58:32] remain rested. The voice told John, the
[1:58:36] one upon whom you see the dove remain
[1:58:38] at, he's the Messiah. What does that
[1:58:41] mean? That dove could land on somebody
[1:58:43] and fly. Land on somebody because acting
[1:58:46] like a lamb at that time and all of a
[1:58:47] sudden wolf act up and the alarm take
[1:58:50] off. That's a temporary landing. Then
[1:58:56] that dove gave a temporary landing
[1:58:58] because he was behaving cool. But as
[1:59:01] soon as the girl say the cat do it so it
[1:59:04] p nice meow and somebody tell do it the
[1:59:07] other
[1:59:09] way no
[1:59:11] meow you know and when you act like that
[1:59:14] the dove take off but Jesus was the lamb
[1:59:17] and the dove remain that dove is love
[1:59:20] that dove is charity that dove is the
[1:59:22] holy spirit that dove is a person of
[1:59:24] Christ that dove is the holy the the the
[1:59:26] supreme power that go be controlled the
[1:59:29] cap of your life s that bond of
[1:59:32] perfectness charity that brides absolute
[1:59:35] that Rebecca's veil to cover your mind
[1:59:38] and thinking the other half of the
[1:59:39] Chinese ticket that is what that is
[1:59:41] about that dove to remain hallelujah no
[1:59:46] more up and down but remaining upon you
[1:59:48] wherever you walk is with you wherever
[1:59:50] you go is with you hallelujah if you go
[1:59:52] to hospital is with you I'll never leave
[1:59:55] you I'll never forsake you oh give the
[1:59:57] Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:00] That's why they take cloth off of Paul's
[2:00:02] body because the anointing was upon
[2:00:04] Paul. And when he lay his hands upon
[2:00:06] those cloth, the anointing was upon
[2:00:08] there. You can't see the anointing, but
[2:00:09] the anointing is there. You can see the
[2:00:11] effect of the anointing. A woman take an
[2:00:13] anointed kurchchief and put it on a
[2:00:15] wheelchair and rest it upon her leg and
[2:00:17] walk out the wheelchair. The anointing
[2:00:19] on the wheelchair, it's the quickening
[2:00:20] power. You can't stay dead when that is
[2:00:22] around. Oh, give the Lord a shout. One
[2:00:26] time they threw a dead man in the grave
[2:00:28] of one of those brothers, Elijah, one of
[2:00:30] them. And when that dead man hit that
[2:00:31] body there, he raised back up again
[2:00:34] because the quicking power was in them
[2:00:35] bones. Oh, give the Lord a shout. You
[2:00:38] can't stop this glory. You can't stop
[2:00:40] this anointing. You can't stop this
[2:00:42] power. This belongs to the sons of God.
[2:00:45] The devil have no access to it. That's
[2:00:47] why he don't want you to get it. He
[2:00:49] could never get it. But you have an
[2:00:51] access to it. You have a right to it
[2:00:53] because that's what Jesus died for. He
[2:00:56] purchased you with his blood. He
[2:00:57] purchased every redemptive blessing
[2:00:59] belong to you. You have a right to your
[2:01:01] children. You have a right to claim your
[2:01:02] family. You have a right to healing. Oh,
[2:01:05] give the Lord some
[2:01:06] [Applause]
[2:01:09] praises. All my diabetes and my pressure
[2:01:12] and my headache. Forget that my children
[2:01:14] am I out. I know yours.
[2:01:16] I know your rights. My female condition,
[2:01:19] my this, my that, my problem, my
[2:01:21] problem. I had to live with it. Says
[2:01:23] who?
[2:01:27] Jesus. When he was about to go to deal
[2:01:28] with Lazarus, he said for I I prayed I
[2:01:31] glad for your sake that I am not there.
[2:01:33] Amen. He say he sleepeth. He say he's
[2:01:36] dead. When he go he's mourning carrying
[2:01:38] on. Jesus can activate himself. He know
[2:01:42] what he has to do. But he has to wait.
[2:01:44] And when that woman said Lord if you had
[2:01:46] been here my brother had not died but
[2:01:48] even now. Amen. When he said even now
[2:01:51] that tro is in a gear, where have you
[2:01:53] laid him? He's at a cry because he's a
[2:01:56] man that dead. He's feeling for him.
[2:01:59] Where have you laid him? He said, "But
[2:02:01] Lord, he stinkketh." Three days gone. He
[2:02:04] dead. She said, "Roll away the stone. He
[2:02:07] can't be roll like you want to see that
[2:02:09] dead body, a stinking buddy." If you say
[2:02:11] roll away the stone because something
[2:02:12] had to take place. You got say well
[2:02:14] where I'm waiting for the excavator. I'm
[2:02:16] waiting for the the truck the tow truck.
[2:02:20] to come and move it. You know what I
[2:02:22] mean? You got no lazy self there. Boy,
[2:02:25] wait. Somebody with muscles to come. She
[2:02:28] said, "Roll away the stone. Whatever you
[2:02:31] do, do that."
[2:02:33] She ran. Well, they said to push whoever
[2:02:35] helped, but they roll away the stone. He
[2:02:37] said, "Lazarus,
[2:02:39] come forth." Lazarus had no choice, you
[2:02:41] know. Lazarus G back and say, "I ain't
[2:02:43] coming."
[2:02:46] That's the power we talking about.
[2:02:49] Lazarus comfort. Wherever that soul was
[2:02:52] traveling, pull it back. Hallelujah. Big
[2:02:55] and anointed upon the body, heal it
[2:02:56] back. Restore it back. All he had around
[2:02:59] him was grave clothes. As Isaac say, he
[2:03:01] come jumping. So, come forth Lazarus.
[2:03:04] He's still tied up, but he coming out.
[2:03:06] You could be tied up this morning, but
[2:03:07] you're coming out. Come forth. You're
[2:03:09] coming out. Come on. Come on. Keep on
[2:03:11] jumping. We're going to take them
[2:03:13] clothes off of you. We're going to
[2:03:15] unwrap you. You're tied up. the tangler.
[2:03:17] But come on. Come on. You was dead, but
[2:03:19] you're coming. Give the Lord a shout in
[2:03:21] the house. Come on.
[2:03:26] [Music]
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:34] You know what Johnny Crew?
[2:03:37] They say when you want to get them
[2:03:38] elephant domesticated, you tie the
[2:03:39] elephant post and keep them right there.
[2:03:42] After they cut it, the elephant still
[2:03:44] think he tied. That's like Johnny Crow.
[2:03:46] Devil tie you and you feel you're right
[2:03:48] there and afterwards you feel you're
[2:03:49] circling around there around there.
[2:03:51] Somebody come this morning with a knife
[2:03:52] and cut you and you're still making
[2:03:54] circles. Johnny Cro, let's go south.
[2:03:57] Let's get out of here. So watch this
[2:03:59] now. I'm going to try to wrap up here
[2:04:01] now. So first God want to reveal
[2:04:03] himself. He's a healer. There's nobody
[2:04:06] sick. He's a father. There's no sons.
[2:04:09] He's a deliverer. There's nobody to
[2:04:11] deliver. This is the Garden of Eden
[2:04:13] setting there. He he have all these
[2:04:15] attributes in him and he cannot throw
[2:04:16] down man. He can't I'm fallen fallen now
[2:04:19] so I could do this thing.
[2:04:21] No, he didn't do that. When God spoke,
[2:04:24] let us make
[2:04:26] man, he was finished. Eve was not there
[2:04:29] yet. when he pulled the rib out of Adam
[2:04:32] and and introduced Eve as a byproduct of
[2:04:34] the man, a man with a womb, this woman,
[2:04:39] that is where the devil got an
[2:04:41] opportunity to to trick the system to to
[2:04:44] get at Adam. Adam fell. Adam failed. Not
[2:04:48] because Adam was deceived, but Adam love
[2:04:49] his wife
[2:04:51] and he went after his wife and they got
[2:04:53] kicked out the Garden of Eden. And
[2:04:55] through being kicked out, it opened up
[2:04:57] the avenue for God's attribute to be
[2:05:01] unfolded to redeem, to save, to heal, to
[2:05:05] deliver, to restore. All these things
[2:05:08] could now unfold. The devil is totally
[2:05:10] clueless. As far as the devil is
[2:05:12] concerned,
[2:05:13] it take out that son. It's over.
[2:05:18] We could reign on the earth now. That
[2:05:19] devil thinking that. So all those demons
[2:05:21] now looking for bodies that'll be born
[2:05:23] on the earth that they could jump in and
[2:05:26] use because the devil is mischievous.
[2:05:28] And that how do they say it? That spirit
[2:05:30] that move out of house looking for
[2:05:33] houses.
[2:05:34] The earth doesn't belong to him. Your
[2:05:37] body doesn't belong to him. You are the
[2:05:39] temple of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[2:05:43] So this un I don't know the word for
[2:05:47] this unbodied spirit looking for bodies
[2:05:50] to influence and use. That's right.
[2:05:54] Spirits looking for homes, looking for
[2:05:56] houses that they could invade, that they
[2:05:59] could use, that they could take over.
[2:06:01] And the Holy Ghost is looking for
[2:06:03] bodies. He's looking for homes. is
[2:06:06] looking for lives that he could
[2:06:08] influence and he could take over. And
[2:06:11] just as the devil could use a man, God
[2:06:12] could use a man. Just as the devil could
[2:06:14] use a woman, God could use a woman.
[2:06:16] Hallelujah. Just as the devil could use
[2:06:18] this one and that one, God could use
[2:06:20] you. Could I hear a shout in the house?
[2:06:23] I'm talking about you now. I'm talking
[2:06:24] about nobody else.
[2:06:29] [Applause]
[2:06:31] Hallelujah.
[2:06:33] So the first thing was to reveal himself
[2:06:35] which he did through Jesus Christ. So
[2:06:37] Christ became the mystery of God
[2:06:38] revealed. The second thing was to have
[2:06:42] the preeminences in his body of
[2:06:44] believers that is his bride. What is the
[2:06:47] preeminence? The first place
[2:06:50] that's what the preeminencees really
[2:06:51] means. Before your husband is God,
[2:06:53] before your wife is God, before your job
[2:06:55] is God, before everything else, God
[2:06:57] first. Your family second and you last.
[2:07:00] You are not first. God first. You put
[2:07:03] him as king. You put him as the reign.
[2:07:06] That's why the David said, I would look
[2:07:07] onto the hills from when calling my
[2:07:08] help. My David was a God man. That's why
[2:07:12] God love him a man after my own heart.
[2:07:15] Oh, give the Lord some praises. David is
[2:07:17] the one that danced when he saw the ark
[2:07:18] coming down the road. Glory to God. He
[2:07:21] loved God. He loved the things of God.
[2:07:23] He loved the people of God. He loved the
[2:07:25] kingdom. That's what's the kind of man.
[2:07:27] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:07:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He was a
[2:07:33] visionary before he died. All the
[2:07:36] papers, all the money, all the all the
[2:07:37] vision there for the temple and so on
[2:07:38] like that with Solomon. Amen. God say
[2:07:41] he's a bloody man. You can't build that.
[2:07:44] You're a fighter. You're a warrior. I
[2:07:46] need a man who could compromise and make
[2:07:48] a negotiation and get things from other
[2:07:50] peoples and so on. Solomon have wisdom.
[2:07:52] He will handle that. Not you. Your son
[2:07:54] will handle that. God knew who could
[2:07:56] handle what. God know why he choose
[2:07:58] Paul. Because he was a learned man.
[2:08:00] Because he had to rightly divide the Old
[2:08:02] Testament. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:08:04] praises. He knew why he chose you.
[2:08:06] Whether you're educated or you're not
[2:08:07] educated, he chose you for a purpose.
[2:08:09] You have got to believe today there is
[2:08:11] some purpose behind your life. Your life
[2:08:13] cannot be in vain. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:08:15] shout. Glory to God. And I keep saying
[2:08:18] it, preaching it. I'll say it again.
[2:08:19] Time was given to fulfill purpose.
[2:08:22] Whatever time God allowed to you is for
[2:08:23] fulfill your purpose. Find that purpose.
[2:08:26] Find what God raised you up for and go
[2:08:28] out. Do it with all your might, with all
[2:08:30] your strength, with all your energy. Do
[2:08:32] it.
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:35] Hallelujah.
[2:08:37] [Music]
[2:08:38] Wrap up here.
[2:08:42] Hallelujah. preeminences and third
[2:08:44] mystery to restore the kingdom to its
[2:08:47] right position as going back to Eve. He
[2:08:51] choose the bride knowing Eve would fall.
[2:08:54] Listen to this here now. before
[2:08:58] Christ, before everything else was on
[2:09:00] earth. You see this mystery that he
[2:09:02] chose the bride knowing Eve would fall
[2:09:04] from disbelieving the word, knowing that
[2:09:06] she would fall, but he would choose a
[2:09:09] bride that would not fall, that would
[2:09:11] hold to that word regardless of all the
[2:09:14] rest what the world has say about it.
[2:09:17] Now listen friends, I don't believe in
[2:09:19] blasting somebody and take out the light
[2:09:20] that your light shine. You got to do
[2:09:23] that. You don't have to be jealous of
[2:09:25] anyone.
[2:09:26] envious of anyone. Whatever somebody
[2:09:29] have shouldn't bother you. What you want
[2:09:31] to know is what is the will of God for
[2:09:33] your life.
[2:09:37] When Jesus wanted to ride on that
[2:09:38] donkey, he told them specifically go
[2:09:41] tell that man the master have need for
[2:09:43] that donkey.
[2:09:45] That means God put it in that man heart
[2:09:47] to release that donkey. If that man was
[2:09:49] different, you should date this donkey
[2:09:52] renting for you have money. Yeah, you
[2:09:55] understand what I'm saying? God knew
[2:09:57] exactly where that donkey was because
[2:09:59] the scripture says that the king cometh
[2:10:01] lowly upon that donkey. So God knew
[2:10:04] exactly the spirit of the man who had
[2:10:06] that donkey. Jesus said go to that house
[2:10:08] and tell that man the master need that
[2:10:10] donkey and Jesus saddled that donkey and
[2:10:13] start to sit down there and they hosana
[2:10:15] hosana and hosana. And when the scribe
[2:10:17] and Pharisees saw the kind of worship
[2:10:19] was going on there, they said, "Tell
[2:10:20] them,
[2:10:21] lower that noise. Turn down the volume."
[2:10:24] And Jesus said, "If they don't cry out,
[2:10:27] the rock's going to cry out. I ain't
[2:10:29] telling them to lower down no volume.
[2:10:31] Raise it. Hosana. Blessed is he that
[2:10:35] cometh in the name of the Lord. Messiah
[2:10:38] is on earth now." Oh, give the Lord a
[2:10:40] shout. For a terrorist Messiah is on
[2:10:43] earth now. He is here.
[2:10:46] Oh, glory to God. The Holy Ghost is
[2:10:48] here. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:10:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:57] Glory to
[2:10:58] God. Watch those seas will be broke. The
[2:11:01] full team will come to plain view. Watch
[2:11:03] this. How the hour of the seven angel
[2:11:06] message. I'm going to close mission.
[2:11:07] Come on, please. All the mystery of God
[2:11:08] should be made known in that Elijah. In
[2:11:10] that Elijah. How that Christ is put out
[2:11:12] of the church, the son of God. How you
[2:11:15] did you get that? Where is Christ? Out
[2:11:17] the church. That's why say behold I
[2:11:19] stand up. They came out and they have
[2:11:21] big services. They kick him out and they
[2:11:23] have pastors and all the ministers but
[2:11:25] they boots him out because he's the
[2:11:27] word. Anytime they kick out the word is
[2:11:29] over. What Christ put out the church son
[2:11:31] of God. How he reveal a son of man
[2:11:33] again. How the church here we go is to
[2:11:36] be put in order. Amen. No denomination.
[2:11:39] Just absolutely. Are you ready? Amen.
[2:11:42] The word living in the individual.
[2:11:46] Hallelujah. Praise God. That is what it
[2:11:49] is. The word living in the individual.
[2:11:53] Not not what church you go to. Oh, you
[2:11:54] go to that tabernacle. You say, "Pastor,
[2:11:56] you Right. Right. Right." No, that's not
[2:11:58] the ID card. When the police stop you on
[2:12:00] the road and they pull you aside, this
[2:12:02] is driver's permit and insurance.
[2:12:04] Sometimes they say it with a smile, some
[2:12:05] say with a serious face. But you better
[2:12:07] have your driver's permit and insurance
[2:12:09] because they'll put a charge and give
[2:12:10] you a ticket. Driver's permit and
[2:12:12] insurance. You pull out Yeah. your
[2:12:14] driver's permit that has your picture on
[2:12:16] it that have your address on it. It have
[2:12:19] a number on it. That's your ID card.
[2:12:21] Well, this word living is your ID card.
[2:12:25] Not worth talking.
[2:12:27] You have plenty of that. That is living.
[2:12:29] That somebody explaining, well, you
[2:12:30] know, I forget my card home. I forget my
[2:12:32] card. that explain to the policeman put
[2:12:33] police put man on that he want to see it
[2:12:38] gay had an experience where police stop
[2:12:40] him ask for insurance and he was
[2:12:41] shooting him on the phone but I don't
[2:12:42] want to see on the phone
[2:12:47] I tell make sure you get a document
[2:12:49] paper you know that policeman walk away
[2:12:51] from him and say not on the phone don't
[2:12:52] show on phone he want the real material
[2:12:57] and next person come and see I favor
[2:13:00] now after that man walk away The next
[2:13:02] man come and say go ahead go ahead. That
[2:13:04] the favor we talking about. That's the
[2:13:06] people look out for. You see when you
[2:13:08] are under the grace of God, you get
[2:13:10] favor. You get key people come into your
[2:13:13] life. And the reason there are key
[2:13:15] people because they are keys. Don't
[2:13:16] bother with nobody on no keys. People
[2:13:18] with keys, people lock the door. See
[2:13:20] that man that come afterwards? That
[2:13:21] person had a key to tell them go. That's
[2:13:24] not the next police. Tell them just go
[2:13:25] ahead. We see we come to the airport
[2:13:28] sometime and I we have suitcase and
[2:13:29] whatnot. And the people in front they
[2:13:30] tell them go to the machine. Go to the
[2:13:32] machine, go to this one and what that I
[2:13:33] want to see us just go
[2:13:35] ahead know what
[2:13:38] inside gohead like the green light. I
[2:13:41] tell myself go they tell me go and I go
[2:13:43] and I go and I smile going out favor.
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:49] Hallelujah. He shall be like a tree
[2:13:51] planted by the rivers of whatever he do
[2:13:54] going to prosper. God putting favor on
[2:13:58] your life. Let us see if we could wrap
[2:14:00] up here. Hallelujah.
[2:14:05] Skipping.
[2:14:08] All
[2:14:14] right. The life that was in the husk.
[2:14:16] Begin to play something. I was in a husk
[2:14:19] in the stalk. God is up in the seed. And
[2:14:22] the life that was in the stalk went on.
[2:14:24] One went to make the other.
[2:14:26] Justification went to make
[2:14:27] sanctification. Sanification made a way
[2:14:29] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:14:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[2:14:32] for the Holy Ghost itself to come back
[2:14:34] in perfection and back to the word. So
[2:14:37] what God is saying is a process. These
[2:14:40] seven church ages is the process of the
[2:14:43] unfolding life of the seed.
[2:14:46] The seed go through processes. You go
[2:14:48] through processes. But when it comes to
[2:14:50] the top, it bear fruit at the top. Come
[2:14:53] on friends, come up to the top. Amen.
[2:14:56] The top is we have forgiveness. The top
[2:14:58] is we have brotherly kindness. The top
[2:15:00] is where fruit will step out. Because
[2:15:03] you have that spirit of forgiveness. As
[2:15:04] the question many times, why would God
[2:15:07] take a Holy Ghost fil man and give him
[2:15:09] an experience of condemning a woman and
[2:15:11] he said, I forgive her. I forgive you
[2:15:13] and you condemn her. And he could
[2:15:15] understand. You can't just go condemning
[2:15:17] people. You can't just go and exing
[2:15:19] people out. You don't know what God see
[2:15:21] in them.
[2:15:23] They may be in a condition now that
[2:15:24] don't mean that's a permanent state.
[2:15:27] Pull yourself together. Let's all stand.
