[29:52] even everyman which is this weapon in
[29:55] his hand
[29:56] behold six men came from the way of the
[29:58] high heat towards the north and every
[30:02] man a slaughter weapon in his hand and
[30:05] one man among them and the wind and the
[30:17] glory of the God of Israel had gone up
[30:20] from the cherub whereupon he was to the
[30:22] cheshire of the house and he called to
[30:25] the man clothed with linen which had the
[30:27] writers inkhorn
[30:28] by his side and the Lord said unto him
[30:32] go to the midst of the city through the
[30:37] midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon
[30:40] the foreheads of the men that sigh
[30:54] after him to the city and after these
[31:29] things I saw four calling the four winds
[31:34] of the earth that the wind should not
[31:37] blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on
[31:40] any tree and I saw another angel
[31:43] ascending from the east having the seal
[31:45] of the Living God and he cried with a
[31:48] loud voice to the four angels to whom it
[31:50] was given to hurt the earth and the sea
[31:53] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[31:56] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[31:59] the servants of God in their foreheads
[32:02] and I heard the number of them which
[32:05] were sealed and they were sealed a
[32:07] hundred and forty and four thousand of
[32:10] all the tribes of the children of Israel
[32:16] may God bless his word you may be seated
[32:19] praise the Lord
[32:26] it's good to be in his presence
[32:30] tonight our title the inkhorn

[32:39] ink horn writer and an inspiration
[32:42] sealed in or sealed out on a contact
[32:47] Scripture will tell you whether
[32:49] Scripture Sunday evening first
[32:50] Corinthians 12:13 for by one spirit we
[32:53] are all baptized into one body
[32:58] I'm Alabama pretty sprayer he said dear
[33:01] Lord Jesus we are summoned again in your
[33:03] name
[33:03] with great expectation for your point of
[33:08] the quickening power of God to bring us
[33:11] into recognition of our position and
[33:14] please and our responsibilities of being
[33:18] appalled people separated from the world
[33:21] dedicated to God grant Lord tonight that
[33:26] the blessings of God will guide us and
[33:28] they wreck us and the things we do and
[33:30] see that it might bring honor and glory
[33:33] to your name so he was under expectation
[33:37] for the Orion of the Krypton power what
[33:40] are you on the expectation for tonight
[33:42] Oh hallelujah
[33:44] you have to be under expectation for
[33:47] that quick and power from the inside man
[33:50] Branham you know you would like to know
[33:53] what I think the greatest need of the
[33:55] church today would you like what I think
[33:58] where I think the lacking is is no salt
[34:01] reveal the people are not broke up
[34:05] enough listen to those words the people
[34:08] are not broken up enough there is no
[34:14] burden seemingly you give me someone
[34:17] that so talk about lost souls
[34:20] but they cry and a wanton a revival so
[34:25] bad till they can hardly eat this simply
[34:29] can't you can't continue if you would
[34:32] read a history of the world and
[34:33] religious history you will find out it
[34:37] always take that kind of spirit to bring
[34:39] a revival what kind of spirit brokenness
[34:43] broken spirit broken are you feeling to
[34:49] pour out you want to repent you want to
[34:52] make things right you want to be
[34:54] reconciled to God you want to humble
[34:56] yourself to the cross you want to lay at
[34:59] Christ's feet digs that kind of spirit
[35:02] to bring a revival not arrogance not
[35:06] tried not you in your own self and you
[35:09] do your own thing people not caught up
[35:11] and I'll have a burden about Jesus
[35:14] Christ when you have fall in love with
[35:17] the Lord you want to do the thing that
[35:18] pleases God so that your children for
[35:21] it's not the family for it's not what
[35:23] you feel first is what God is what Jesus
[35:26] one first so Jesus become the team of
[35:28] your life Jesus become the center point
[35:31] of your life everything is wrong we were
[35:33] all wrong Jesus not this is me notices
[35:36] don't ends about Jesus it's not about
[35:38] you Oh hallelujah
[35:40] so let's see said that's right and then
[35:44] he could disappear it when Zion
[35:45] travailed and I think I well giant
[35:52] reveal I think is a better world
[35:54] why is a big echo here when Zion
[35:57] travailed why she bought four children
[36:01] you have to be taught up the atmosphere
[36:03] or anything you have to be torn up so
[36:06] some time God allow things to happen to
[36:08] break our spirits
[36:10] the embarrass and Seamus and mashes up
[36:13] so when we get broken we could cry
[36:16] because they've got to leave you intact
[36:18] you are fine everything is everything
[36:21] everything we cannot have your money or
[36:22] your house you have your card and
[36:24] everything we're gonna fine you don't
[36:27] need good because things will come to
[36:29] mess with you but then God have to crush
[36:31] that brick that something up to happen
[36:34] to break your spirit and if your spirit
[36:38] is not broken he will break it before
[36:40] there is going to be a revival praise
[36:43] God I believe that there is going to be
[36:46] revival and you will have to get in that
[36:49] spirit to get into the revival or praise
[36:52] then you know do you believe that what
[36:55] about saying you get around when there
[36:56] are arguments you get into the type of
[36:58] atmosphere if there's something in the
[37:00] church someone who is disobedient and
[37:03] acting or glee in the church and causing
[37:06] trouble you will never be able to have a
[37:09] revival as long as that kind of
[37:11] atmospheres are wrong so all the rocks
[37:14] that offend God will move out all the
[37:18] people that want to be ugly going to
[37:20] move them out run them out put them out
[37:23] because one going to have a right
[37:25] atmosphere for revival or glory the body
[37:29] will bust the rocks and off his holy
[37:31] mountain because God going to have a
[37:33] glorious church without spot without
[37:35] wrinkle and no human I will stop that
[37:38] church hallelujah
[37:40] no pastor human no elder human not
[37:43] peaking human no office on human no
[37:45] believer human no human spirit when to
[37:47] stop that church from coming forth
[37:50] because amount of the Lord had spoken it
[37:51] oh praise the name of the Lord
[37:54] believe that so so watch if somebody
[37:58] acting ugly in the church I'm causing
[38:00] trouble you will never be able to have a
[38:02] revival as long as that kind of
[38:04] atmospheres are wrong you have to have
[38:06] everybody if you notice when the Holy
[38:08] Spirit came on Pentecost they were all
[38:10] in one place in one Accord waiting for
[38:13] the promise and when we get like that
[38:15] the revival will be there there oh
[38:17] praise God hallelujah and the reason I
[38:21] think we have just had protracted
[38:23] meetings instead of a revival cause we
[38:25] do not have a revival nation as yet we
[38:27] have revival like the didn't a Wesley
[38:29] revival Scotland all these revival is on
[38:32] Wesley they had great breaking up and
[38:35] worldwide revival by John Wesley that's
[38:37] when I think of a revival I noticed in
[38:40] my ministry and this is about Abraham
[38:41] talking now if the people will spiritual
[38:44] people and yet they will watch what God
[38:46] will do and signs and something that he
[38:48] will perform under people set and safe

[39:55] reminder
[39:56] hallelujah just when the worst
[39:59] earthquake to strike America struck the
[40:02] revival holy was in Azusa that stop
[40:05] hallelujah
[40:07] 1906 I believe it was there was 1906
[40:10] hallelujah what a great little quick and
[40:13] people was blaming God for that
[40:15] it was a great destructive earthquake
[40:17] with many fires but there was another
[40:19] earthquake in the spiritual realm that
[40:23] wasn't lit it up a different kind of
[40:24] fire it was holy war sire it was a
[40:27] bonfire
[40:29] it was the as we go to revival and I
[40:31] believe tonight there's gonna be another
[40:33] earthquake but this time will be the
[40:35] bright revival it's gonna be a Holy
[40:38] Ghost revival he said what we see should
[40:41] make a church that would make a revival
[40:44] that people will fly in from everywhere
[40:45] say the seven thunders of Revelation 10
[40:48] that is not even written it's being
[40:51] manifested or glory to God so I am under
[40:56] great expectation tonight Oh glory to
[40:58] glory man we believe that what about him
[41:02] says now if there really was a revival
[41:04] on the air when those things would take
[41:07] place every soul will grasp it quickly
[41:09] there will be no end to it it will just
[41:12] go from one to another from one to
[41:14] another it will keep moving of course
[41:16] you know I'm American like you are but
[41:19] in Africa down here where they're
[41:21] supposed to be hidden land it was kinda
[41:23] wouldn't make us feel ashame of
[41:25] ourselves to see how they received the
[41:27] gospel when they see one supernatural
[41:30] thing performed thirty thousand receive
[41:32] Christ as first unsaved at one time that
[41:35] was he least 30,000 there's no question
[41:38] it was just over that's all and I will
[41:40] tell you this in this body burn I think
[41:43] our people has relied too much on
[41:44] education and theology and so forth and
[41:48] has let it take the spirits place
[41:53] so no is the message ludovic knowledge
[41:56] and information and revelation and
[41:58] understanding and topics and discussion
[42:00] and fellowship and people have no feet
[42:04] no atmosphere loaded with theology and
[42:08] the theology in end up a substitute for
[42:11] the spirit that's supposed to be here
[42:13] present for the spirit are supposed to
[42:16] be working
[42:16] Oh hallelujah let me drop this to you i
[42:20] believe in ezekiel the 9th chapter that
[42:22] what we read I'm pretty sure I may be
[42:23] wrong I'm not quite sure is equal 9
[42:25] chapter when the Holy Spirit went for
[42:27] first it was a man when thought from
[42:31] behind the gates with slaughtering
[42:33] weapons to destroy so they say these
[42:36] angels was coming to destroy it's one
[42:40] among them was that one with the inkhorn
[42:42] but the writer right side isn't that
[42:44] right and that was of course
[42:46] scripturally applied was before the
[42:49] destruction of Jerusalem and there was a
[42:51] man came forward with a white robe and
[42:53] in corn by his side and the Commission
[42:57] was given to him by God to go to the
[43:00] city no listen to this and set a mark
[43:02] upon the forehead and he call it he said
[43:07] he read after readin the ceilin of the
[43:10] Holy Spirit
[43:12] they're not understanding and getting a
[43:14] revelation and you know they would come
[43:16] to me you know talking about that no
[43:17] he's talking about a man do you have
[43:22] that Mac he's talking about a Mac this
[43:26] is not I see you should have this or a
[43:28] pastor said no no no this is the
[43:29] Scriptures no he says no go true listen
[43:32] set a mark upon the forehead the sealing
[43:35] of the Holy Spirit a mark upon the
[43:37] forehead of every man a woman that
[43:39] sighed and cried for the abomination did
[43:43] in the city so that's the quality of
[43:46] spirit that's the quality of attitude
[43:49] sighing and crying for the abomination
[43:52] now I want to ask you if he was coming
[43:56] to Chicago tonight
[43:59] how many places would he find tonight
[44:03] that in the home they are laying seven
[44:08] for revival
[44:09] just in such travail of soul that they
[44:15] can't stand it any longer they just
[44:18] don't know what to do
[44:19] I wonder how many would he mark in
[44:23] Chicago tonight
[44:24] of this city of almost 5 million people
[44:27] in it
[44:28] what would he mock I imagine you could
[44:32] calm them on your fingers hardly don't
[44:34] you think so
[44:34] the people with that type of burden and
[44:37] yet that was exactly he wasn't a mark no
[44:42] one but that type are you that type do
[44:48] you want to become that time
[44:51] do you want God to come and put that
[44:53] burden on you that you want to be saying
[44:57] to crying and groaning and travailing
[45:03] according to the script we read when
[45:05] Zion travailed Zion brought forth if
[45:09] there is no travail and not in coming 4
[45:12] therefore God after bring on a travel of
[45:15] soul at revealing your spirit beyond
[45:18] where you just have your needs met and
[45:21] things being met and things working out
[45:23] for you something have to go beyond that
[45:25] that you can grasp the burden of God Oh
[45:28] hallelujah praise God you see people
[45:33] individuals inside they have the
[45:34] individual interest and burden and
[45:36] conditions we who in ministry not
[45:40] fortunate to be in your position because
[45:43] we have the burden of the entire church
[45:47] so when you study in you and your family
[45:49] we can study our own family we have to
[45:53] study the entire church the burden is
[45:56] different the responsibility is
[45:58] different the weight is different
[46:05] hallelujah so you can look for all the
[46:08] individual attention if this just was a
[46:10] thousand people how much hand we will
[46:12] shake how much people we go go home by

[57:26] on different things

[57:29] strange of the so called heavenly choir
[57:31] of hymn song under the evident direction
[57:34] of the Holy Spirit both as two words and
[57:36] tune trill my whole being is a testimony
[57:39] from Azusa Street it was not something
[57:41] that could be repeated at will but
[57:43] supernaturally given for each special
[57:46] occasion and was one of the most
[57:48] indisputable evidences of the presence
[57:50] of the power of God perhaps nothing so
[57:53] greatly impressed people as this singin
[57:55] at once inspiring by a holy or or
[58:00] feeling of indescribable wonder
[58:02] especially the hearers were in default
[58:04] attitude this one I get to divine love
[58:09] was wonderfully manifest in the meetings
[58:13] they were not even allowed an unkind
[58:17] word said against the opposes or the
[58:19] churches the message was the love of God
[58:23] it was a sort of first love of the early
[58:27] church
[58:27] returned it was a sort of first love of
[58:31] the early church returned the baptism as
[58:35] we receive it in the beginning did not
[58:37] allow us with all body baptism of the
[58:40] Holy Ghost did not allow us to think
[58:43] speak or hear evil of any man that was
[58:48] religion not that word repeated the
[58:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost did not allow
[58:54] us to think speak or hear evil of any
[58:58] man the spirit was very sensitive and
[59:01] tender as a dove

[1:06:04] hosts by going to work with the Holy
[1:06:05] Spirit what what can i life is that that
[1:06:09] would be sinners ever known they do I
[1:06:10] respect you come to church to get the
[1:06:12] Holy Spirit that your life could be
[1:06:14] guided by the Holy Spirit not by your
[1:06:17] human spirit only well your arguments
[1:06:19] really to inner listen you have a human
[1:06:21] spirit you know you have a will of your
[1:06:22] own just a not my will but your will be
[1:06:24] done
[1:06:25] you have a human spirit by not the Holy
[1:06:27] Spirit that if you yield to the Holy
[1:06:29] Spirit and currently you can share it to
[1:06:32] his word because the spirit anywhere is
[1:06:36] one let's continue my opinion like is
[1:06:41] unknown
[1:06:44] now to see whether this message we got
[1:06:47] is connected with it or not the very
[1:06:49] hour that Israel was sign in to be a
[1:06:52] nation is the very same hour the very
[1:06:54] same day the very same month I was at
[1:06:56] Greenville Indiana and the angel
[1:06:59] appeared to me and sent me out on the
[1:07:01] field with this he met me down the river
[1:07:03] and told me that would take place then
[1:07:06] commissioned me 11 years later at the
[1:07:08] same hour that Israel was sign our
[1:07:10] nation it is all connected together the
[1:07:14] in then he made a statement he had me
[1:07:16] keep preaching it and thing like that
[1:07:17] the angel the Lord is under it now he is
[1:07:20] moving around fixing everything for the
[1:07:23] common of the Lord
[1:07:24] no 1914 over went to war there have been
[1:07:27] never be peace since control is swinging
[1:07:29] swinging and swinging and and they are
[1:07:31] doing the very same thing yet and they
[1:07:33] was doing what Holden he said oh boy
[1:07:34] have mercy
[1:07:35] holding that great thing that I saw in
[1:07:38] the vision the whole team become a
[1:07:40] destruction holding the atomic hole and
[1:07:43] awards that they don't destroy
[1:07:45] themselves until the team come to
[1:07:46] destroy until Israel returns back and
[1:07:48] get herself together and then the
[1:07:50] messenger go to Israel and she'll be
[1:07:52] sealed with the seal of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:55] after the Gentiles is called out the
[1:07:58] pure his namesake then Israel oniy
[1:08:00] receives a tree and six three years and
[1:08:03] six month Daniel said so there's given
[1:08:08] space is given for the Gentiles when it
[1:08:11] comes to this age he call it the times
[1:08:13] of the Gentiles not even fixed just
[1:08:16] ecologist the times of the Gentiles and
[1:08:19] when that time of the general is over
[1:08:21] the door is shut not one more Gentile to
[1:08:24] be seized and then quark over to the
[1:08:26] Jews Oh could I read owner of it then
[1:08:32] there's three and a half years left for
[1:08:33] the Jews now if we get over the ocean
[1:08:35] level we'll pick it up at the end of
[1:08:37] that Elijah and Moses returns again and
[1:08:39] preacher the Jews
[1:08:40] two men anointed with that spirit or
[1:08:43] maybe them themselves they never die so
[1:08:45] they kill them
[1:08:46] the lien the street called Sodom we our
[1:08:48] Lord was crucified Jerusalem and after
[1:08:50] treat is a life Spirit came into them
[1:08:52] and they went up and raised up and then
[1:08:56] about a third of the earth was blown to
[1:09:00] pieces at that time squatters are there
[1:09:07] you mean this is real the mint is going
[1:09:11] to happen he said a third of the earth
[1:09:13] was blown up to pieces at that time no
[1:09:17] here the Jews that come in to preach to
[1:09:19] the world cannot would not blow up on
[1:09:21] another or kill one or destruction come
[1:09:22] until the Jews come down to that place
[1:09:25] and here sets the Bible he saw four
[1:09:28] angels and watch what they got to
[1:09:30] receive they have got to receive the
[1:09:32] Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:09:37] Ephesians 4:30 the Holy Spirit sealed
[1:09:39] until the day of your Redemption and
[1:09:42] they cannot do nothing until those Jews
[1:09:44] return oh praise God hallelujah 11:00
[1:09:47] tonight the last even we picked up and
[1:09:50] find out that the first church how it
[1:09:53] started off it was started there
[1:09:54] Pentecost where the Holy Spirit poured
[1:09:56] out upon the believers and we saw the
[1:09:58] reaction of these believers and how they
[1:10:01] acted upon them nobody talks about that
[1:10:04] they explain away the Holy Ghost but the
[1:10:06] Hara action and they did and signs and
[1:10:13] wonders follow them we find out at the
[1:10:15] close in church age about 200 years they
[1:10:17] sprung up a heresy among them that
[1:10:19] doctrine was the induction of the
[1:10:21] Nicolaitans we find out it was deeds to
[1:10:24] begin with in the next churches become a
[1:10:26] doctrine then they become persecution
[1:10:28] and Dark Age then the other side it come
[1:10:31] Protestant Church Martin Luther watch
[1:10:33] and he's seen the Spirit of God lead
[1:10:35] amount instead of letting the people
[1:10:37] steal free he organized a church and
[1:10:40] made an image lightning unto the Beast
[1:10:42] you surely miss Bertram what God seen
[1:10:45] people say that to an eternal God see an
[1:10:48] image onto the beasts
[1:10:50] unless let's go further a political
[1:10:53] power lighten on to it instead of
[1:10:56] letting the people walk as God gives
[1:10:58] light they organize under a discipline
[1:11:01] that they have to stay to that
[1:11:03] discipline what happened in the message
[1:11:05] what happen it is people had one
[1:11:07] doctrine and teaching and people
[1:11:08] following doctrine and teaching
[1:11:10] hallelujah and that and and that is
[1:11:13] supposed to put them any bright like I
[1:11:15] said on Sunday there is no private
[1:11:16] bright nobody can take a church outside
[1:11:19] and like I see brighter Jesus Christ and
[1:11:21] then Minister intended by that Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ that doesn't exist
[1:11:24] the pride of price is that is the body
[1:11:26] by one spirit the baptizes and that one
[1:11:29] body nobody can hijack Debray another
[1:11:32] byte in a corner look at hijacked church
[1:11:34] members anytime you could have told him
[1:11:36] the church members but that ride that
[1:11:38] Jesus right first Thessalonians 4 the
[1:11:40] Lord Himself descended on her with a
[1:11:43] shout to get that right he sent a
[1:11:45] message to get that bride well glory to
[1:11:48] God if God called you like this message
[1:11:49] ho glory to God you up you are
[1:11:52] privileged you are privileged because
[1:11:55] the bride will not be manhandled the
[1:11:57] black gonna be flesh of his flesh one of
[1:12:00] his word spirit of a spirit or glory dog
[1:12:04] or demon God listen listen God need
[1:12:09] right out into the Methodist Church the
[1:12:11] Methodists are a revivalist up the world
[1:12:13] the holy spirits with them teaching
[1:12:15] sanctification and the first thing you
[1:12:17] know the organizer change amid an image
[1:12:19] onto the Beast a political organized
[1:12:22] power to bind the people that is what
[1:12:25] that anointing does it binds the people
[1:12:28] to a system and not the Holy Ghost that
[1:12:31] is what we are fighting
[1:12:33] halleluiah systemís Beynon is a power
[1:12:36] you know it'll make an unfallen taco
[1:12:39] bell's of power because dying the people
[1:12:41] the people kill me the people can't
[1:12:44] worship the people can't break out there
[1:12:46] was no signs there was no oneness there
[1:12:48] is no merit
[1:12:49] there was no power the church is dead on
[1:12:53] now power a different kind of power you
[1:12:58] see below see that's power you don't see
[1:13:00] it as a power base the power I'm read it
[1:13:01] to you he said the first thing you know
[1:13:06] watch God move Ward the first thing you
[1:13:08] know when they did that the organized
[1:13:10] that church mean I imagined to the Beast
[1:13:11] that's right a political organized power
[1:13:13] to bang the people of God to a Creed
[1:13:16] instead of being free to worship and
[1:13:18] walk in light as light was tuned in
[1:13:21] their part
[1:13:22] did you realize Christian friends that
[1:13:24] the Antichrist which is the mark of the
[1:13:26] beast
[1:13:26] aha now we come to another Mack put a
[1:13:29] mark the inguinal right to have a Mac
[1:13:31] and the beasts have a mark is just two
[1:13:34] months it's not 24 months is not
[1:13:36] tattooing all over it's just too much
[1:13:38] mass of God and mass of the beasts I was
[1:13:42] saying that they just - I like that it's
[1:13:44] simple just two marks it's not 24
[1:13:47] markers of mafia-style max take whatever
[1:13:49] math you want is there too much math of
[1:13:52] God mark of the beast not of God mark of
[1:13:56] the beast sealed in Orsino Oh hallelujah
[1:14:02] Oh to the Lord a shout I will say again
[1:14:06] either you are ceiling or see Lopez
[1:14:09] normally there is no in-between or
[1:14:13] capella new earth shall worship the
[1:14:15] beasts whose names are not written in
[1:14:17] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:14:20] foundation of the world all glory does
[1:14:23] God we are crazy
[1:14:24] we're not crazy or Bolena Lord we are
[1:14:27] not crazy this is the message to face
[1:14:31] the word back to the Bible
[1:14:33] dr. Pentecost back to the Holy Ghost
[1:14:37] dr. dynamics and we are emphasizing
[1:14:40] dynamics we emphasizing the spirit
[1:14:44] oh my do you realize Christian friends
[1:14:48] that the Antichrist which is the mark of
[1:14:50] the beast the Antichrist everyone knows
[1:14:52] that the Antichrist did that his mark
[1:14:54] is his power abby's is a power there is
[1:15:01] a power in the Catholic Church I wanted
[1:15:05] to understand what the prophecy there is
[1:15:08] a power in the Methodist Church so it's
[1:15:11] not like they have no power oh it's what
[1:15:13] kind of power because the confessions of
[1:15:16] millions is the power keeping them
[1:15:18] people inside idea whether to our Father
[1:15:21] and Sheila nari it keeping them there
[1:15:25] did not move in every Sunday morning
[1:15:31] finally vine have them under control
[1:15:39] DePaul the Methodist Church here but
[1:15:42] around that is the beast power the
[1:15:44] Baptist churches is in the Pentecostal
[1:15:47] church you were witness all of them it's
[1:15:50] peaceful you can't change over with this
[1:15:54] unless the name on the book is stained
[1:15:56] your witness because a doctrine that
[1:15:58] binding the foliage of a witness the
[1:16:01] following Baptists tie the head ring the
[1:16:03] bell that is it it's the power
[1:16:08] hallelujah but we have to get our power
[1:16:11] too
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:19] our power has to be the same power that
[1:16:24] PETA had because this one Lord is one
[1:16:29] fit and as one baptism or give the Lord
[1:16:32] a show one Lord one faith one baptism is
[1:16:39] the Holy Ghost baptism and those guys
[1:16:42] had it you wanna have it because the
[1:16:45] only one is the Jewish one don't nobody
[1:16:53] feel happy that I've had a kind and we
[1:16:58] really modern age and we have a kind -
[1:17:02] no no no we would see one Lord one faith
[1:17:06] one baptism
[1:17:08] that's why brother Branham didn't
[1:17:09] commenting on you fate you can turn your
[1:17:12] hats because only one feat bring back to
[1:17:28] defeat Oh hallelujah praise God praise
[1:17:31] God in many many men or glory to God
[1:17:36] hallelujah praise God but a Branham and
[1:17:41] this way I get who get the inspiration
[1:17:45] from if I could see that way see the
[1:17:48] Antichrist but about God bless you I
[1:17:50] love you and if you want to see a real
[1:17:53] genuine gifts are not impersonation if
[1:17:56] you want to see real solid Christians
[1:17:59] walking so salty tell the goodies to
[1:18:02] stand for them to be like them you can't
[1:18:05] go down on the street and tell what is
[1:18:06] Christian anymore that's right the old
[1:18:08] good on the street they were at the
[1:18:10] scene they talk the same all the time
[1:18:11] around I can all kind of jokes
[1:18:13] everything like that when God said
[1:18:15] you'll give a con for every idle word
[1:18:16] that you speak what happened because
[1:18:19] brother you are letting the devil come
[1:18:21] in and put it
[1:18:22] the first thing you know prophecy the
[1:18:27] time will come when God will give a
[1:18:31] message and you'll be sealed in out the
[1:18:35] kingdom of God not joint church people
[1:18:42] joining anybody Towson's he said a
[1:18:44] message gonna come I'm that message
[1:18:47] going to either actually see you or see
