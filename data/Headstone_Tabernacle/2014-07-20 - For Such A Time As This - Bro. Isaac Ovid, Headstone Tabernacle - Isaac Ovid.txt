tricks on me to destroy my life but God heard me when I came to church on Thursday I prayed Lord you have to speak to me tonight for I'm not going back home the same and the Lord met her what can we say amen amen we thank the Lord for that this morning and uh we have two prayer requests one uh from Sister Judith Samuel for Teddy Samuel please pray for speedy recovery for Teddy who is in hospital suffering from a few mil Str strokes and a mild heart attack also kidney failure more importantly please pray for the Salvation of his soul and I was just informed that brother Mundus had to be taken to the hospital with stroke like symptoms so we want to remember him in prayer as well this morning can we approach the throne of God reverently and with respect this morning and for whatever other condition that may exist in the house this morning or in the body of Christ we want to pray this morning our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come to you Lord this morning morning Father knowing that you are God this morning knowing that you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord Thursday night we read your Prophet said the devil has a right to that punch and father Body of Christ we have received a number of punches Lord but we are not ignorant of Satan's devices this morning nor are we ignorant of the power that rest in the adopted sons in the Church of the Living God the power that lays in the message of Malachi 4 father we thank you for calling us out of the world in such a time as this and Lord we have needs in the church this morning Father we bring Teddy Samuel before your throne this morning Lord that he may be completely healed father not only May healing come upon his body but may he be completely saved delivered transformed set free by the power of the Holy Ghost that worketh in us this morning Father God our precious brother mundas Nicholas this morning Lord a valiant Soldier Lord Lord the enemy has taken a punch this morning father but the Church of

captives in the house may you set free may you bring the backsliders back may you break every chain may you deliver in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this service into your hand May the Holy Spirit move in this house may you move on the internet this morning may you move wherever this tape may play may you move among your bride this morning may you move among your elect this morning may you move among your children this morning may that rushing Mighty Wind fill this house may the rushing wind fill every life made a rushing wind fill every home in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated this [Music] morning what a presence what an anointing what an anointing this morning Anything could happen this morning Hallelujah pass me not oh gent till [Music] sa my home cry [Music] oh why [Music] another's Lord you're calling this morning Lord you're calling this morning do not [Music] do not pass me by [Music] we need you this morning oh [Applause] [Music] saor that's our prayer this morning Lord Jesus say is that your prayer this morning won't you hear my humble cry my humble Jesus help us this morning oh Break Every Chain in the house this morning While others is that what calling Jesus why on anothers thou you feel his presence you know he's here the anointing is already here oh to not pass me by keep playing Softly in a message of blushing Prophet brother brandom said it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian he said times are going to change the old is going to become young he said death is going to Fleet away sickness will be no more he said no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the lost but God shall come and take the elect from the Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather them under his own wings and we live and reign with him forever in his Heaven brother Bram said oh brother sister friend of mine if you're not prepared today may you be prepared in this hour he said I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus today and receive you that's been different you that know that you're not where you should be with God I invite you to the altar with myself every one of you to come here and not only only say but to stay until God has cleansed your soul from everything that's unlike him until you go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster on but go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your soul and gives you new life and New Hope go out with the baptism of the Holy Spirit can the church say amen that's how I feel this morning that's the kind of service I'm looking for this morning for the house of God to be a House of Deliverance to be a house of correction to be a house of straightening up to get your life right with God this morning do not pass me by this morning oh for the last time let's sing this morning W bless him [Music] sa savior savior savior save [Music] oh sweet Jesus here my oh [Music] cry while anothers thou are calling this morning anothers Thou Art calling oh do not pass me you may be seated once more I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ this morning and you feel the season has changed I believe anything could happen this morning I want God to just take such control that he will say what he once said and he will do what he wants to do this morning and all we have to do is steep out of the way so that he could step into the way that's why we came here this morning and you brought your worship you brought your sacrifice of praise and that's the right attitude but the brandom said it takes the right attitude to bring the result Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so it's a great honor to be here this morning and have a few announcements and a few things i' like to say before I get to the message this morning but I want you to mark your calendars on Monday September 1st which is the holiday uh independence day is going to fall on August 31st which is a Sunday and we're going to have the holiday the Monday we want to have a church day of fellowship and activities so mark that on your calendar and we'll certainly give you more details in the future in the very near future so friends God without man is still God but man without God is nothing can the church say Amen I'll say that again god without man is still God but man without God is nothing that's how I feel this morning we need God this morning we need that same God that walked with Moses and spoke to Joshua and came to David and comforted Samuel and he was there in the burning bush and he was there as a pillar of fire and he was the presence of the angel with the prophet god without man will always be God but God without man is nothing if you don't know God this morning today is your day this morning I would encourage you to please remember the pastor in prayer as he returns to us in the middle of this week and for those who were here on Thursday night what a tremendous time we had on Thursday night the lord gave me a message to him that overcometh and we took where brother brandom said in order to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome so if you feel all hell is against you this morning that's a blessing he said the greatest thing you could ever have is the trial the greatest thing you could ever have is a test that's how you know there's something about your life he said there is if there is no test then God has got no touch on your life he has got no ho on your life but if there's a trial and he said the trial and the test and the obstacle it keeps you alive it brings life to you so if if you struggle to be here this morning consider yourself blessed if you struggle to be on fire this morning consider yourself blessed if you woke up and all hell is against you consider yourself blessed the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord God he will deliver from them all and that's how I heal this morning he is still a deliverer he is still a way maker he is still a Healer he is still a baptizer blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm the happiest man alive this morning to see the Fulfillment of Malachi 47 seal 7 ther message this is the happiest time for us this morning Hallelujah if you can see this morning I can yes sir if you don't believe it this morning I believe it because your unbelief is not going to stop God come on Sarah you can laugh all you want this morning who me I'm going to get the Holy Ghost yes you you're going to get the Holy Ghost who me I'm going to be adopted yes you you're going to be adopted who me I'm going to have a child yes you yes Sarah you going to have a child after all these years I've been baring in the message it looked at if nothing was going on service after service uh but at the appointed time uh I'm going to come to you according to the time of life and you going to have that child I say s is this the time this morning is this the appointed time this morning is this the time of life for the bride this morning am many many manyen so I believe this morning the Holy Spirit charity the Dynamics is all over you this morning he's all where you at on the internet this morning and he's getting ready to baptize you with fire believe it thou this then be it unto you according to your faith so this service this morning will be a bit different almost two weeks ago on Wednesday July 9th at around 2:00 a.m. the lord gave me this message and uh I woke my wife up at 2: a.m. and started to preach amen began to share what the Lord opened to me and later that day I spoke to the Mike Thompson and then I called my dad and so I feel like I've held this message is baby for a long time and this morning with the help of the Holy Spirit and with you in the spirit we're going to try to deliver this baby this morning so this morning this message will be a combination of preaching teaching bible study on Sunday school I have a three-fold purpose this morning for you to catch a genuine revelation of who you are for you to know what you're called to do and to declare that now is the time hallah can the church say Amen as I said on Thursday night there's a difference between dividing the word and rightly dividing the word and I believe that this morning the ministry of the spirit is here to rightly divide the word to minister to the needs of the portion of the Bride under this ministry can the church say Amen so this morning I Stand United with our pastor brother ID I Stand United with brother Anthony and the elders to make a church that would make a Revival if I'm the only one going to be screaming I'll be screaming but I know I got some Soldiers with me this morning I know where brother oit stands I know where brother the Anthony stands I know where the elders stand I know where the deacons stand this morning and I know there are some Sons and Daughters of God here this morning who will make a church that will make a revival can the church say [Music] Amen from a message you may be seated the Mighty God unveiled but the brandom said I'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of God and you feel the spirit of God already here this morning I'm identified with the group that know he's unveiled that knows every mystery has been revealed he said that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever and knows that this is not fanaticism you could call me crazy how much you want young man young woman you might feel your parents dragged you in this morning and why we got to go to church and why we got to do this this crazy bunch of people this is not fanaticism this morning he said it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group today he said yet they're called a bunch of Heretics a bunch of fanaticism but I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God unto salvation somebody say [Applause] amen I was listening to a message and brother K was saying if they call me Holy Roller if the Holy Spirit tells me to roll I'm going to roll I feel like rolling this morning I feel like having an old time sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival to break the sin off of us to clean the trash out of your life to create a Revival and you are the Revival this morning you may be seated so I believe that we all share the responsibility the burden or the responsibility is not just in the ministry alone we share our responsibility as members or as candidates for the bride body of Jesus Christ to make a church that Jesus Christ can walk into to make the kind of church that brother Branham long to see a church full of power a church to unite with the headstone a church that knows that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I believe with all my heart that we will have that kind of a church so are you ready for the word this morning I'm not going to be too long with you this morning but we're going to have a time this morning so will you stand for the reading of the word this morning with me Hallelujah and we're going to read Esther we're going to go to the Book of Esther this morning Hallelujah GL Glory going to spend some time in there this morning if if you're familiar with the Book of Esther it'll be an experience for you this morning and if you've never read the book of Esther or studied the Book of Esther it'll be an experience this morning amen so we can go to Esther chapter 4 I'm going to read from verse 10 and Esther spake unto haac and gave him commandment unto morai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king the these 30 days and they told to morai Esther's words then morai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then Esther B them return to return Mori this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish amen so Mori went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads once more Heavenly Father we have read your holy scriptures this morning Father may you breathe life upon it may you take me out of the way completely and may Lord you deliver this message to your church this morning the portion of the Bride here Lord and father May our understanding be open may we lord be delivered and set free Lord and may you fill the Sanctified here this morning Lord and those that are not Sanctified Lord may they run quick to clean up their houses to clean up their lives Lord may you take complete control those who are filled may you refill them this morning Father with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire may you bless us in the name of Jesus Amen and amen you may be seated this morning Hallelujah GL hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord so I have a title this morning for such a time as this amen and a subject recognizing who you are what you are called to do and that now is the time amen and my inspiration you should have killed all the amalekites you should have killed all the amalekites so this morning who you are and what you are called to do is for such a time as this amen and in order to receive the Holy Ghost you have to know who you are in order for you to receive anything from God you have to know who you are because only when you know who you are it puts you in a position to make requests from God can the church say Amen so this morning just before I get to my text this morning I want to lay a background by encouraging your faith by saying you are predestinated seeds of God this morning no man could come unless the father called him first so you couldn't even walk into this church unless God call you there are other churches you might have been able to walk into but not this one because no man can come unless the father draws him first so you this morning are predestinated seeds of God it doesn't matter how you feel what happened last night what happened yesterday what happened this morning Let the Rain Fall on the outside it's dry here on the inside this morning you are the final voice to the final age brother brandham said once more the world will hear direct from God and God is going to use you in here this morning yes in your condition in your situation God is going to use you because it will not be you it'll be God in you it'll be Christ in you it'll be the word in you come alive can the church say Amen hallu H this morning you are the manifestation of the prophet's prophecy can the church say Amen from a message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandham said now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he said oh if the church only knew its position amen amen and I say this morning if the church only knows its position and but the B says it will one day then he said then the Rapture is going to go so I believe the church is coming into her position this morning and when the church comes into its position what will it be a short quick message and the Rapture so get ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready you don't even worry you don't even have to pack a bag you know when you're going on a trip you have to pack your bags and get ready for the trip this trip there's no bag to pack this trip you got to leave all the bags behind you got to leave the house behind you got to leave the mortgage behind you got to leave the clothes behind you got to leave the associations behind for this trip you want to be as light as possible you don't want to have any extra you don't want to have any extra stress you don't want to have any ODS you don't want to have any grudges you don't want to have any jealousy you don't want to have any worldliness you going to be so light that you get caught up to meet him can the church say Amen this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah but I got news for the devil this morning Hallelujah I got news for the devil this morning I feel like a news reporter this is just a background I'm going to get to my text shortly the secret is already out because the bride knows who she is the bride knows who she is the bride knows who she is and there's no devil could stop her there's no demon can stop you there's no sickness could stop you hallelujah hallelujah I don't know what happened to about the Mund us but that's a sign to show that he's still with us he still heals he still sets free he still heals the diseases he still breaks the [Applause] prison oh Hallelujah somebody give God a shout of Praise you're not going to get anything this morning unless you're in the spirit but I know there are some people in the spirit this morning I don't know about everybody but there are some people in the spirit who came under expectation they're looking for God to do something for them uh they don't want to just come to church uh they want charity they want Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience calliness brotherly kindness the fullness of the word manifesting its season to be manifested in their lives that's what we came for if you can't shout for that you're in the wrong place but I know in the right place this morning for such a time as this you were raised up uh this church was built for such a time as this brother Coleman dedicated this church for such a time as this we have a pastor who stands with the word for such a time as this what devil what demon what false anointed what unclean Spirit can stop the prde Revival there's a Revival in Trinidad there's a Revival a seven seal seven tunder Revival that's my testimony I don't care what anybody says I have a right to my testimony this morning this church was built to create a Revival this church was built to catch a headstone that's why you a headstone Tabernacle this morning there is no church like this church I could see it this morning there's an anointing here the angel is here the power of God is here and you are going to receive the Holy Ghost and Fire your family is going to be delivered you are going to receive Dynamics uh you are going to be filled you are going to be set free for such a time as [Applause] this hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated every pastor and the ministers who support the pastor have a responsibility to anoint the word for their local church this is a sovereign Church uh we don't report to anybody let every Church do what they have in their hearts uh but as for me and my hous uh we will serve the Lord I'm identified with the word of God this [Applause] morning for such a time as this we're going to have a Revival we're going to make a Revival we're going to start a Revival if not here then where if not now then when if not you then who can the church say [Applause] Amen who do you say this is this morning for such a time as this you could miss this service uh for such a time as this uh you are in here this morning for such a time as this you are connected on the internet this morning for such a time as this uh you are hearing this tape this morning hallelujah it's a call to the resurrection it's a call to the wedding supper it's Accord to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and [Applause] Fire H Hall [Music] h thank you yes you could worship him yes you could worship Him the more you worship the walls begin to tremble the walls know when you worship the walls hear when you worship the walls begin to tremble around your life when you worship the wall say don't worship but this morning I'm not going to let no rock out praise me I'm not going to let any chair out praise me I'm not going to let the world make more noise than me this morning Hallelujah we came to God's house to create a Revival you didn't come to hear me preach this morning you came to hear from your God you didn't come to hear man this morning you came to hear from the angel for the pillar of Fire you may be seated for such a time as this Anything could happen this morning justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down to Perfection back to the word to manifest itself again listen carefully we have one absolute and that absolute is the word of God am yes that's my ab absolute no man is my absolute your absolute must be the word of God which is Christ which is a message of the hour for hour time and our season I there's too much flesh in this message too much beef in this message too much men's ideas in this message too much Empire Kingdom building in this message Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world it's not of this world Hallelujah this is not brother oit's church this is God's house Hal Hallelujah can the church say Amen this is the house of God this morning amen for such a time as this that's the message this morning for such a time as this you are his Masterpiece God has spent all these years shaping you molding you putting things in place but bam said the same holy ghost that was with the lutherans that Sanctified the Wesleyan that was with the Pentecostals is now present tense setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that same Holy Ghost is here this morning to set your house in order to set your life in order to clean the trash out so that the Holy Spirit itself can drop down and that box car can be sealed until the day of your Redemption that's what we came here for this morning that's why friends you can't afford to miss Church you can't afford to take this for granted because there'll come a time where we won't be able to gather like this there'll come a time when there'll be a famine and there already is a famine but it's only going to get worse a famine for the hearing of the true word of God that's why you can't play games that's why you can't flirt with the world that's why you can't do what the world does for such a time as this you were raised up this morning Hallelujah I'm still laying a foundation to get to the text Hallelujah what are we getting ready for friends for in Mark 16 the Lord himself went with them everywhere confirming the word that's say Mark 16 that's what we're talking about and that same God is here this morning not in justification only sanctification only the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift but the entire Holy Ghost is here this morning for such a time as this St Mark 16 is here this morning the Lord himself is here to conf confirm the word with signs with wonders with Miracles how could there be a miracle if there's nobody sick how could there be a miracle if there's no broken marriage how could your marriage be a miracle if there's no broken marriage if your finances not in a wreck how could God work a financial miracle if your house is messed up how could God be a god of Miracles if there's nobody to heal and there's nobody to deliver and there's no chain to be broken I say the chains are being broken this morning receive the word this morning and watch God [Applause] deliver Hallelujah this morning I say unto you you are predestinated unto adoption and there ain't enough devils in hell to stop it who's strong enough who's bold enough to put one finger on the bride touch not man anointed do my prophets no harm the devil could watch you this morning but he can't even touch you this morning and nothing could happen to you unless God allows it nothing could happen to you there is no accident this morning there is no mistake this morning nothing went wrong this morning there is no accident in your life this morning for such a time as this you are here this morning can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seated the Holy Spirit anointed word word is here this morning he's trying to get his church in order he's trying to find some Sons and Daughters who will catch the vision and leave this world and everything in it can the church say Amen so this morning the holy spirit is here to give you a revelation amen the church is built upon Revelation to give you a revelation of how to drive out your enemies to give you a revelation of how how to drive out your enemies that's why you may be seated I took an inspiration you should have killed all the amalekites we're going to deal with them a little later on we're going to come to them a little lat let the amalekites wonder what we going to say but their time is coming we are serving notice today on the [Applause] amalekites oh we're going to get it in a couple minutes so I Believe In My Heart this morning you know who you are that's the first fold of my three-fold subject this morning who you are what you are called to do and now is the time so I believe you know who you are this morning because you couldn't be here this morning if you weren't too sure who you are you might forget sometimes and stress might put pressure on you sometimes but who you are doesn't change who you are what you do doesn't change who you are what your name is doesn't change who you are once a son you're always a son come on you prodigal sons this morning come on you prodal Sons this morning can the church say Amen you may be seated I feel the holy spirit this morning I feel the angel this morning I feel this is a homecoming service because some sons are coming home you may be seated Hallelujah for such a Time is this you may be seated I feel like the like the father this morning of the prodal son his son said father I finished my bachelor's degree I got my Master's Degree I feel I'm established this morning I'm ready to go work somewhere can I get my portion of my inheritance now because I'm about to make a name for myself and I'm about to go and establish I I'll make us all look good I I'll have a time I I'll still try to keep my values and the father knew what was going on he still gave the sun because he knows if this is in the sun he got to get it out the sun it was hiding there all along so the sun went running and doing his own thing running into the world he went to the parties he went to the fornication he went and drink and smoke he he comb his hair this way he put a mohawk he had this kind of style this kind of fashion he wore the Styles he wore the chain he wore everything they had he walked like the world until one day his money ran out one day his revelation ran out one day his understanding ran out one day his ideas ran out and the Bible says he came to his senses God give us some people this morning who will come to their senses who come to realize wait a minute in My Father's House the servants eating steak F Manion salmon shrimp caviar non-alcohol olc champagne in my father's house they have every kind of food you can imagine and here I am eating pig food you may be seated you understand the irony of a Jew who doesn't even mess with pigs having to compete with the pigs with the pig food when the pigs look out they are getting nervous crumbling among themselves look at this one why I got to eat less this is the pigs having a conversation HJ this son eating the foods the pig supposed to be eating that's what the Bible say you can't make this stuff up that's the Bible but he came to his senses he said I will arise I will go to my father and I say father I've sinned he said I'm not worthy to be called your son I'll take a position as a butler I'll take a position as a driver I'll take a position as a servant whatever it is but he didn't know that from the day he walked out of church Hallelujah he didn't know the day he walked out of church you may be seated his father bought the best telescope that money could by his father built a platform to look out for his son look out for his son every morning every miday he say I'll have my lunch right here I'll have breakfast right here I'll have dinner right here because one day my son is coming home my son is coming home I don't want to miss it I want to make sure that from a far off when I see him coming I know it's him I know how he walks I know how he talks I know that's my [Applause] boy Hallelujah you may be seated so I believe this morning that telescope has been put down because you're in the house of God this morning some of you spiritually been walking in the Land of Nod you've been walking all over the place uh but this morning you are in the presence of God at a time when you know you need God can the Church Say Amen [Applause] Hallelujah that wasn't in my notes this morning so let me get back on track this morning I told you we're going to have a Time Bible study a little preaching a little teaching a little ministering we came to have a six-hour service this morning Hall I feel so inspired I feel so I can't put into words what God is doing for me that's my testimony you got to have your own testimony my testimony can be your testimony but the Lord delivered me the Lord saved me the Lord kept me I couldn't keep myself I should have gone crazy a long time ago I should have been writing on the wall a long time ago I should have been running up and down the highway a long time ago and if God saved me who could take that away This Joy I have who could take it away you try you try you try no devil can take it away this morning the peace I have the devil did not give me that peace and the devil cannot take it away this morning blessed be the name of the Lord so this morning you know who you are and you know you are called to manifest a living faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and for charity to seal the whole thing that's what you're called to do for Jesus Christ to be put on display to be written Epistles read and known of all men to be different to be called out to be separated for God to have the preeminence in your life for God to have the preeminence in your marriage for God to have the preeminence in the brothers for God to have the preeminence in the sisters for God to have the preeminence in the children for God to have preeminence in the ministers and the elders and the deacons that's what we are called for we are called to be adopted this is not a Pentecostal church this is not a message Church Hallelujah this is God's house this morning where the word is our absolute there are people in the message that all they only testimony will ever be is I was in the message or am in the message that's not what God is looking for but the B said what we need in jeffin Ville is thousand of lived voices so this church is to produce lived voices not more church members not great teaching it's to produce lived voices because that's the Thunder that shakes the devil it's the life behind the name that make the demons tremble you are going to have a [Applause] life so you know who you are this morning you know what you're called for this morning and I want to say this morning that now is the time but the brandom desired in his heart to see certain things but the time was not right as much as he desired it God still worked with appointed time am God is a god of order he's a god of structure he's a god of system he's a god of organization amen he doesn't move brother the BAM said he doesn't move haphazardly he doesn't come and say I forgot to do this you know no no no no no no no so when brother branham's Ministry was finished God had to take him off the scene because his work was done when God's work is finished God takes a man off the scene amen hallelujah I wasn't there when brother Brandon was there I wish I was but God didn't call me to be there at that time amen and in my life I'm giving my testimony God had to raise up somebody to stand in the Gap to keep the messiahship straight to keep The Word Alive to keep the message alive to fight the false anointed and the teachers in the message who were trying to corrupt it with different interpretation and ideas and God raised up for such a time as this brother Coleman to fill a void can the church say Amen we are speaking plainly this morning you may be see it because but brandom said there would come men after this to make more sense to it but over said last week things are supposed to be clearer not more confusing when you come to church you ought to see it plainly there should be no more questions why every mystery has been revealed this is not rocket science because but brandham said God can reveal it to the most stupid person that's what that's but Bram were the stupidest the most illiterate person so you don't have to have a degree and read all the courts to know what it is it's a life that's all it is it's a life live a life live a [Applause] life I remember the K's work was done there were many things he had to do but when his work was done God had to move him off the scene because God's Focus has been not an individual his Focus has always been his bride God is a god of the people God has always been a god of the people amen you may be seated that's why when the children of Israel they were under the prophets and they were under certain structure the children of Israel begin to Grumble they say can't we have a king can we have some man over us yes God has always desired to communicate to his people and the children say can we have a man over us like the others including the amalekites and that's how Saul became king but it was not God's desired order God has always desire to be a god of the people that's why but brandom B busted the Catholic church so much for putting all the power on the popes that's right so God himself wants a Tabernacle in you and then be able to say there's my spirit flowing freely there's one day I could use there's another one over there and if that same Holy Ghost is in you that's in me we wouldn't argue we wouldn't debate elect can persecute elect elect can say opposing things elect can say different ideas because it's the same Holy Ghost that's why Paul could say if anybody preach anything else other than what I'm saying let him be a curse because there is one absolute and that absolute is the word of God can the church say amen I don't know how I got over there friends but we are having church this morning we're going to have a clean church you know without spot without wrinkle without amen you may be seated so do you know that now is the time I'm almost going to get to my in a few minutes brother Bram said the time has come friends and this is taken from a number of messages that brother brandham preached he said the time has come friends when something's got to be said and I believe we are saying something this morning he said the time has come for the church to move up or go back so you have a choice this morning either you move up into the spirit or go back into the worldly field that you come from he said the time has come for these things to be fulfilled now is the time the time has come for god Jehovah to rise on the scene and show himself not show man but show himself the time has come now for you to make a decision today what side you'll be on and this side is not Church side this is God's side or the devil's side plainly this morning the time has come where we can't pet anymore we got to preach that's but I'm reading but brandom so we are preaching this morning the world calls preaching foolishness but to us it's salvation this morning am can the church say amen amen the time has come to believe or don't believe there's no middle ground here the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth the time has come for a showdown all taken from brother brandham from a message Father the hour has come brother brandham said the time has come that God will gather his church together through under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and pour out his powers among them and great signs and wonders will take place the time has come yes sir he said the time has come for the Pentecostal Church make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness and that word call means to cut out the foolishness the time has come to go back to the old Landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the Gathering of the people the time has come for Jesus to come the time will be here soon to give out the rewards are you looking for your reward this morning then give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise but the BAM said brother be careful that your crown isn't set on someone else's head the time has come we are at the end time if we're ever going to do anything Brethren we're going to do it now the time is at hand the time has come and God's shaking every denomination Under the Sun amen am can the church say Amen so I'm encouraging you this morning for such a time as this yes and the time has come yesterday was too early amen tomorrow is too late Hallelujah but I believe today right now is your time somebody say Amen today is your day yesterday was too early tomorrow is too late today is your day you have to strive to press into the kingdom of God God today this is why you are here this morning for such a time of this and friends we in a time of persecution am we're in a time of distress we're in a time of trouble a time of War a time of storm a time of flood a time of pain a time of suffering a time of sickness a time of disease a time of hatred a time of strife a time of confusion a time of Destruction a time of crisis yet in this time God has raised you up for such a time as [Applause] this in a message angels of the Covenant but com said you young people the devil is telling you that you didn't taste the world yet wait a little while longer he said you keep waiting and you're going to wind up in the tribulation period in hell because there ain't no more time left Hallelujah the day you hear my voice Harden not your heart this morning I'm say for such a time as this because time is about to be no more time no longer he who is filthy be filthy still he who is righteous be righteous still brother bam is in a message is your life worthy he says to reject the day of visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people rece leave it then amen don't put it off till next year or the next Revival he said today is the day of salvation amen can the church say amen amen I'm going to skip a couple sections here come and get close to my text so I believe that anytime God is about to do something he must find somebody amen anytime God wants to reveal a part of himself his nature his being his attributes he must find somebody so he had to use Luther and lesy and brother Brandon we know it and now we're going to go back in time this morning Hallelujah back to the Book of Esther the story of Esther is too vast to even cover in one message so we're going to go back in time to around 483 BC where the people known as the Hebrews or the children of Israel or the Jews had been exiled and Scattered throughout the Empire of the mes and the Persians amen the mes and Persian had just conquered Babylon Daniel had brought the dream to King Nebuchadnezzar of that image of gold and silver and brass and iron mixed with Clay of the great kingdoms that were to come that began with the Babylonians and had went to the me and the Persians and then the Greeks and the Romans and here it was the children of Israel had found themselves in problems and whenever people found themselves in problem in the Bible there was a consequence there is always a consequence to your action there's a consequence to your disrespect there's a consequence to what you say Amen there's a consequence to what you do and that's the same a God was when the children of Israel did something wrong there was a consequence and God allowed them to be captured by the Babylonians and then the me and the Persians raised up and destroyed the Babylonians and here it was we find ourselves around 483 BC amen as a result of their sin the children of Israel were scattered throughout the lands of the mes and the Persians at that time the world was ruled by what is called despotic monarchs Kings who felt they were Gods unto themselves rulers who what they say was law what they did was obeyed amen and at this time there was a king in the Land named King ahasuerus yes sir the Hebrews call him aass verus the Greeks call him Xerxes the great Persian king the Bible says he ruled ethiop he ruled from India to Ethiopia 127 provinces I'm building to go somewhere now he was Lord of all he surveyed what he did everybody followed him amen the Greek writer and it's interesting because at that time the Persians recorded everything the Greeks did the same thing the Greek writer Herodotus said that one time when xeres was trying to fight at Greeks he decided to build a bridge brother popwell amen and when he had the build the the bridge built history tells a storm came and destroyed the bridge zy says I will punish everybody he called all the engineers who built the bridge and he had them all killed then he took 300 men brother Shane and told him take your whips out and beat the water because the water offended me the B the the historian said he told them take iron heat it and stick it into the water to fry the water because the water offended him because he wanted to build a bridge to attack the Greeks this was the King on Earth at that time and around that time the Bible said three years into his Reign he decided to have a big celebration the Bible say he party for six months for six months this is not Carnival now this is half the Year celebration after celebration the Bible says there was alcohol there was gold cups everybody had a different kind of cup everybody celebrated and the Queen She celebrated with all the females and everything else and at the end of the six months he called for a 7-Day feast and there was more partying and at the end of the 7 Day Feast he say send for my wife the Bible said he sent seven men to bring his wife to him bring Queen vasi so that everybody could see her and when vasti heard that she was called v as we say in Trinidad she sent back a message I coming I'm not coming I not going down there I don't know what he doing I'm not going down there Hallelujah I'm not going now to see the king the Bible says the King was angry and the King turned to his wise men around him and say well what we going to do those wise men they wer even thinking about the queen or the king one man say here's what you see the wife I have home if she only hear what Vash do I can't go back home the Bible says when they heard it they got petrified that there was going to be a woman's Liberation movement yes yes so they advised the king to put vas away put vasy away and that King didn't even know behind the scene there's a there's a drama taking place because because when God has to move somebody in somebody has to move [Applause] out you may be seated so vasti was removed as Queen and for a while there was no Queen in the land and then the king says you know what it's time to find a wife historians say at that time there were almost 50 million people in the Persian Empire he said find the most beautiful virgins and bring them and among them there was a Jewish girl named hadassa that's right she her father and mother they were both dead and she was being raised by her cousin an older man named Mori yes and the King's Men didn't notice her dasa's beauty her Persian name was Esther and they took her to be one of the girls to meet the king and the Bible says for 12 months Esther had to go through a time of preparation to prepare to meet the king sounds kind of familiar right like his wife making herself ready there's a type in there you can't just go to meet the king in your condition you got to you got to be straight you got to know how to conduct [Applause] [Music] yourself most recently we know uh Prince Charles married what's what's her name Princess Kate correct and in writing they said she spent months before she got married trying to learn the etiquette of the Court and how to behave yourself how to conduct yourself you can't just become a queen without some training and you're about to marry the great king of kings and you don't want to take training you don't want to take correction you don't want to be prepared to marry your king of kings Lord of lords somebody help me preach this morning you may be seated so here we find Esther for 12 months I don't know what kind of training it was for 12 months she was being prepared to meet the king and Mori the Bible says always kept an eye out for her he found himself near to where she was and he would always inquire how is she doing how is my daughter doing how is she coming along sending a word for her and Esther would send back word to him and they had a communication going Hall encouraging her hanging there you going to make it you know what the Bible said Esther always listened to God give us some more young people who would [Applause] listen and then the time came for all of the women who spend the 12 months preparing to go in front of the king and one time I saw a movie depiction of the story of Esther because the Bible says they were allowed to take whatever jewelry they wanted whatever garments they want wanted whatever clothes they wanted they could take 8 in high heels if they wanted they could take 15 chains if they wanted whatever they wanted they could take and one movie depiction had this woman who was going to meet the king on a horse she had so much gold the horse just collapsed but but the brandom in the message the marriage of the Lamb he spoke about Esther and he said Esther didn't take the worldly adornments Esther knew better than that Esther didn't dress like them she didn't live like them she looked at the earrings and the makeup and the jewelry and the and the finger polish and the nail polish and the pants and all of that you said nah I know better than that I might be living in Persia but I'm a Jew I know who I am I know what I'm called to do I [Applause] know you may be seated so you think you're going to meet the king of kings with some of the foolishness you're doing or you think that's going to let it slide huh no no no the pastor give me permission to say this this morning can the church say Amen so woman after woman is going before King Aus King Zer sees and he's not impressed not impressed with the eyeliner and the mascara and the Rouge and the dis and the D yes Hallelujah and what he hear just say you could do and all compromising not impressed hallu just as God is not impressed somebody preached back to me this morning they were coming for the king they closed so tight they could hardly walk nothing impressed can we preach this morning can we preach this morning and then Here Comes Esther Meek Sanctified set apart different her difference made her stand out her difference made her unique her difference made her special her difference highlighted that she was different and the Bible says that that King he was completely blown away he said bring the crown I don't need to see anymore this is Flesh of My Flesh this is bone of my Bor this is Spirit of my spirit that's that's that's my [Applause] wife you may be seated can the church say Amen now is where the story gets a bit interesting I hope not I'm not taking up too much of your time this morning right I said we're going to have a bit bit of a bible study this morning right so here we come to Esther chapter 3 an interesting situation Esther is settling into being Queen she is getting used to the Palace she's getting comfortable with being waited on whatever she asks for she receives it when she looks up people want to know what she wants she's in a world by herself she almost begins to forget she's a Jew because she is the queen 127 provinces 50 million people you don't have much to worry about when you the queen but there's something else brewing in the land the cousin who had trained her who had raised her who had encouraged her who had shown her the word who had reminded her of her history of her Heritage of the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob Mori a devout man a just man a holy [Applause] man in Esther chapter 3 the Bible says that King Xerxes raised up a man called hmon as prime minister and a decree went out for everybody to bow to himon and when Mori saw himon he says I am not bowing [Applause] [Music] down I am not bowing down amen you know what the Bible says it says that the people tried every day daily to tell morai bow they pleaded with him bow follow what we doing do like everybody else Mori was not the only Jew there at the time but he was the only one who did not [Music] bow and heon got so angry he says I'm not going to kill Mori alone I want to kill every Jew everybody and as I was studying this something hit me because the Bible doesn't just call him hmon it calls him hon the agagite and that is where I find the problem you see when they call your name something that's for a reason it's not there by Chance hmon the agagite and I started to study it some more and to get into that we need to go back in history a bit you may be see it for a moment amen amen the Bible says that when the children of Israel left Egypt almost a thousand years before I want you to catch the picture the children of Israel had been in Egypt for 400 years they were in bondage they had been slaves they had no army they weren't Warriors they were Masons and Woodmen and they weren't trained to fight they were now coming together as a people and the Bible says that the amalekites attacked them yes Deuteronomy 25:17 says remember what amalec did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of Egypt how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary and he feared not God therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God had given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess that thou shall blot out the remembrance of amalec from under heaven and he says Thou shalt not forget it so I want you to see the picture friends ride with me this morning the of Israel coming out of bondage they are free they are happy they are celebrating they're now getting their strength back and amalec sees them in their weakness the amalekites aren't honorable Fighters you know there are people who will say I want to fight you man to man I want to fight you face to face if you don't have a weapon I want you to have a weapon so it's an even match not the amalekites you see when you're feeling weak when you're feeling discouraged when you're feeling depressed when you don't have all your strength that's the amalekites the hitti the besides the amorites they all different you see the amalekites is when you feel like giving up he say give up that's the amalekites when your strength is all weak and you're coming out of your situation it's the amalaki that try to cut you off and God said don't forget it he said when you rested when you feasted on the word for over 40 plus years when you are entering the land I promised you this seven sealed seven tunder adoption land you're going to block their name out forever can the Church Say Amen you may be seated that's why I took for an inspiration you should have killed all the amalekites now it gets interesting because the amalekites are repeated in history a couple times in Exodus 17 the Bible says then came amalec and fought with Israel at redam and I'm not going to read the whole scripture in the interest of time but this is where the Bible says um Moses says I will hold up my hand and when I hold up my hand the Lord will be with us and when his hand came down they lost the battle it was the amalekites the same group of people hallelujah you should have killed all the amalekites but the BAM question and answer says when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he says don't you let one of them live he said if it's a cute little baby a little amalaki kill it you remember he'll grow up to be an amalaki he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what denomination it belongs to he says well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to that word get the thing out of you is a growing little amalekite but the B said it looks cute it looks innocent it looks like it's all right but you don't have anything to do with it you stay away from it it's the small things that you find in your life that you have to kill before it grows up so many of us in the message we allow these small things to grow up with us I say this morning kill all the amalekites and I was shocked to find out in judges chap Chapter 3 The amalekites formed an alliance with the moabites against the children of Israel and in judges 6 where the character Gideon is introduced thou Mighty Man of Allah the Bible says the median ites allied with the amalekites I can imagine the spies who were looking at the medanite say is that an amalik what is he doing there how did the amalekites get caught up in this battle who called the amalekites to the fight Saul the Bible says lost his kingdom because God told Saul in 1st Samuel 15 Samuel also sent unto s the Lord sent me to anoint me to be king over his people over Israel now therefore the first instruction now therefore hearken unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus say the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalec did to Israel how he laid weit for him in the way when he came out of Egypt now go and smite amalec and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infants suckling Ox sheep camel and Ash kill everything don't even keep an AM malachite pet so I'm challenging you today Church kill all the amalekites anything that's not the word kill it this morning I don't care how small it is it's in the music it's the movies it's the books it's the magazines it's in the school it's the lectures whatever it is kill it am kill it this morning Hallelujah hall hallelujah God God come to church late that's the Malachi kill [Applause] [Music] it anything that's not the word kill it this morning prise God you don't want to pray that's a malachite kill it you don't want to read the Bible a malachite kill it am the small things you normally pray for hour you want to pray for 45 minutes that's an amalik just take 15 minutes kill the amalik God told Saul here's what kill all the am malachit the Bible says you know what Saul kill almost everybody and bring King agag name sound familiar hon the agagite let we get to that in a bring King agag to Camp along with the sheep and along with all kind of animals and Samuel got angry he say why am I hearing sheep why am I hearing sheep bleeding that's what the Bible says my God my God Samuel verse 1 verse 14 and Samuel said what mean it then this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears Samuel like just walk out his stand he said what is this noise I'm hearing I sent you out to kill all the amalekites amen destroy them amen and you bring back amalik sheep you bring back amalik jewelry you bring amalik to my house this is my friend from school what is his name amalik what's his last name kite you bring am malachite to my house amen [Applause] hallelujah what is this bleeding of sheep your school friend that you brought home what is this noise I'm hanging in your room what is that music you're playing you done bring an AM Malachi back to this house amen what's that you wearing is that an malachite you is that a malachite outfit you brought here this morning hallah is that an amalik outfit you went to work with last week when you know the amales wear that and you don't wear that kill all the amalekites this [Applause] morning and when Samuel came out after he hear the Sheep bleeding Here Comes King AAG he say surely and the Bible says I want I want to get it right I don't want to I don't want to there's a certain statement the scripture says before that before that hold on hold just hold one minute then said Samuel bring me bring ye hither to me AAG the king of the amalekites and this is the word I want to hear and AAR came unto him delicately AAR come out saying I'm I'm AER you know the Bible say eer came out there quietly humble Meek amen amen hoping there's a peace treaty that he could slip into the camp and he could survive hoping he could come to the church and sit quiet in church looking like a Believer raise offering sacrifice worshiping among them and Samuel say give me the sword give me The Sword and the Bible said Samuel cut AAR to pieces he says not in my house kill all the [Applause] amalekites can the church say Amen I'm not going to be too much longer with you but we're driving to a point here friends huh so here now we can understand clearly why morai could have a problem with hmon because hmon the agagite was a descendant of King AOK I don't know how he escaped but the amalekites were very much alive that's why my inspiration is you should have killed all the amalekites because if you had killed the amales hmon should not be there right now that hon in your life that problem in your life that you allowed to fester and grow because you didn't kill him five years ago is why some of the problems you have today [Applause] Mori says I'm not going to bow down and if all the other Jews bow down to him and I'm not going to bow down to this amalekite I'm not going to give it to this worldly Spirit I'm not going to compromise what I know to be the truth because everybody else is bowing down amen I Will Not Bow Down Amen to this day the Jews celebrate the story of Esther in a feast called purum p R I am and in that Feast when they read the story because the scripture says God will blot out the name of the amalekites they don't even say Hon's name they say when was coming down the road and he saw morai they don't even say his name because his name is not supposed to be spoken kill all the amalekites when her saw Mori he was angry and Mori says I will not bow down to her am somebody help me preach this [Applause] morning I know some of you never even read the story of Esther so for some it's an education this morning amen but that's why you're supposed to be in the word because if you in the word then you can take courage and take Faith and take inspiration from what the Bible has in it can the church say Amen so I believe God always has a witness the Bible says every day they try to convince morai to Bow daily could you imagine morai bow now come and go to the party with me now come and wear this outfit now why you wearing your skirt so long why don't cut your ha why don't drink why don't you smoke why why you going to church every day they came to morai to convince him to bow down amen and hmon says I want to kill them all can the church say Amen so I believe this morning there are some individuals who will stand for the word who will stand for righteousness if nobody else wants to stand you could stand if nobody else want to come to church you will come to church if nobody in your house wants to worship you will worship Mori had a revelation and I believe the are individuals this morning who have a revelation can the Church Say Amen [Applause] could you take some more this morning Esther 3:8 says and hymon went to the king and said there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces they're everywhere and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's Prophet to suffer them he said there are some people gathered among the World here their laws are different they don't Worship in our temples they dress different they live different they forgive their brothers they're not getting jealous they don't have enmity they're always on fire they say seven tunders give fi there're something different about them they're not like everybody else they're always praying they're always in the word they're get consecrated they with the old Landmark you can't move them you can't shake them they w't bow to me there's some people who know who they are I don't know who they are but they are different hallu can the church say amen amen and here it was he was able to convince the king to sign a decree to kill all the Jews this is the only time in Biblical history when all of the Jews were in threat of becoming extinct and here we find Esther back in now chapter 4 as I get ready to close out totally unaware unconcerned with what's going on Amen she has been in the temple so long she has been in the palace so long she has been living her life so long she has lost interest with what's going on with her people and her Maids brought word to her that they sighing and crying for the abomination in the city amen brought word to Esther saying Esther your cousin is there outside the gate in sackcloth and Ashes yes crying and weeping she didn't even know what was going on Esther was so out of the spirit she sent morai a three-piece suit so he could change his clothes and when Mori refused the clothes Esther send word what is going on and the Bible tells us that morai sent word that listen our people are under attack God's chosen people are under attack amen and morai sent a message to Esther think not with thyself th that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews he saids if thou altto together hold thy peace at this time then shall Deliverance arise from somewhere else in other words God will deliver us but you and I will be dead unless you do something about it God give us a burden to sigh and cry give us a burden to plead to see God move on the scene understand this the Bible said Esther hadn't told anyone she was a Jew she was an undercovered Jew just how many of us are undercovered Christians and that's why brother over always says tell people that you're a Christian tell people what you believe make your testimony clear amen because when you don't then you're hiding there you compromis compromising amen but now Esther came to a time of decision Hallelujah because for her to go to the king she had to let the king know who she was what she was called for and the time for deliverance is now somebody help me this morning amen hallelujah so after Esther heard this she got in the spirit Hallelujah God help us to get in the spirit this morning and he says gather all the Jews that are around gather all the Believers that are around and fast for me don't eat or drink for three days and I will do the same thing also and my maze will look the same thing also because I'm going to go see the king amen it's death to go in if you are not called but I have to go in to see the king if I perish I perish but I can't stay quiet I can't let this message fall to the ground I can't let this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] message he may be seated the musicians can come forward amen I believe in a message anointed and commissioned where the kman said Queen Esther how do you not know that you wasn't born for such a time as this how do you not know that all that You' have been through in life was for such a time as this for this moment of decision to really serve God or to just hide in church or to just play Church how do you not know that all trials have you have been through and all the experiences you have been through hasn't been for such a time as this amen what did Esther do she went over into the king's chamber it was dead to go in there if you wasn't called to go in there but she had a revelation that she was the bride somebody say Amen so the hour came she said if I perish I perish but I'm going in for the season has changed amen yes sir she knew her life was never going to be the same again because once she she declared who she was she could never take back that declaration she didn't care anymore friends she didn't care about being Queen anymore she didn't care about her own life anymore she didn't care how it would look to the friend she met in the palace anymore it was life or death because when they found out she was a Jew she would have been killed like everybody else it was death if she stayed in her condition and it could have been death if you went to the king amen she say if I perish I perish amen but I've got to see the king Hallelujah Mori a type of the Prophet had spoken to her and encouraged her how do you not know for such a time as this this message came to you amen for such a time as this this word is coming to you this morning that you have to give everything else up in your life and hold on to this word Lord if if I perish I perish but I'm going to serve you with everything Hallelujah if I perish I perish but I'm going to serve the [Music] king Esther had been silent for a long time the fact that they didn't know she was a Jew meant she wasn't going to the temple certain commitments and sacrifices and worship she couldn't have done because she was hiding who she was I challenge you this morning stop stop hiding this morning stop playing church this morning stop playing games this morning there's death hanging over the world Amen and if you stay silent you're going to die if you don't worship you're going to die if you don't sigh and cry you're going to die because there's abomination in the city for all the years that Essa had been growing up she didn't know what she was called to do but all of a sudden in a moment the right word to her set her heart on fire amen yes sir all the years she was in the temple she thought she was just a fortunate blessed Jewish girl who happened to find favor in the eyes of the king but in that crucial moment the word was given to her that Esther how do you not know it's for such a time as this that you are here this morning you are in a position to do something this morning you are in a position to reflect the Life of Christ this morning morning amen buta went on I must go in I'm desperate I'm going in but say so she took the seven tunders and wrapped herself in her royal robe hallelu the clothes provided for her by Malachi 4 morai he was there in type the king couldn't stand vashy no more Miss Le sea because she wouldn't take the headship and they had everything given to them what to put on and what to do and everything how to be beautiful they had they own ideas about it all the rest did what they wanted to do they had their own interpretation of how to please the king but this one Chamberlain he told Esther what to wear how to be beautiful she had a revelation she knew how to please the king so do you this morning Esther you are predestinated to stand before him blameless before the Beloved Hallelujah so the hour come the season come the moment come and Esther walked in by faith knowing she had added all the way up to that Capstone there was no doubt about it she know the seven tunders was there she knew it was there she knew that charity was sitting on the throne on the seventh step Hallelujah she had forgiven her brother there were no arts in her heart therefore she knew her heavenly father would forgive her so with that revelation of Brotherly kindness she walked on in and the King looked and said what do you want Esther unto half of my kingdom and the king put out his scepter to her Hallelujah he said what do you want Esther she said I want my own Feast the spirit and the bride say come whosoever will come whosoever's a thirst come to Esther's Feast this morning you are predestinated Esa to stand there unto adoption amen can the church say amen amen amen you could begin to play something softly wonderful one more hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah and Jess it's it's difficult to finish the whole thing this morning because I believe the word of God has already spoken to some hearts this morning amen and there are some people this morning are ready to say Lord if I perish I perish amen but I want to see the king if I have to give up the worldly clothes this morning I want to give it up this morning amen I want to kill all the amalekites in my life amen there's stuff that you have in your house you have to throw away tonight yes there are books in your house magazines in your houses DVDs in your Houses music in your houses friends in your life that are only taking you away from your blessing amen Esther told the king come to a [Music] feast and bring hmon with you and they came to the house and Esther laid out of feast but the time was not right because God is a god of timing so the king asked Esther Esther what is it that you want Esther said all I want is you to come to another Feast tomorrow something moved in our heart because the timing had to be right and I believe for somebody in here this morning the timing is right you have lived your way for a long time but this is your time for such a time as this this morning this message has brought you to this part for such a time as this the Bible says the next day in fact within that 24-hour period the Bible says after the first Feast hmon went walking away feeling good about himself he's the the king and the queen invited me to eat with them and the Bible says as he walked out he saw morai and they say he got so angry he basically lost his joy of the feast and he ordered him to build a Gallows to kill morai and to show how God works and you can't figure God out that night the King has trouble sleeping and instead of counting sheep hallu he says bring me the chronicles of what's written about our history hall because years before I want to hear what was going on and as they're reading to him so he can fall asleep he hears a story of morai one time had warned about an attack on his life and he asked the question did we do anything for Mori did we do anything for Mori praise God prise God thank you so then the next day he tells hmon hymon what shall I do for the man that the king is pleased with what shall I do for the man who has pleased the king I want to say this is somebody who I'm well pleased what should I do and hymon looks in the mirror fixes his clothes and says your majesty Hallelujah get your horse [Music] get the king's robe which speaks of the king power maybe maybe it was a seven color I don't know but put the robe the Royal robe on this man and put this man on the horse and let a prince lead him through the town to the city and let everybody know this is the man that the king wants to honor the king said yes I love it I love it it he said hymon I want you to go and do this [Music] [Applause] toor you may be seated read it this week read it the Bible says that mori's wife uh sorry Hon's wife and his friends had they say hmon the king just blessed morai I think you're the wrong side of the equation that's right I think you're on the wrong side this morning because who God bless no man can curse the Bible says later that night hmon is he's at the feast and the King says Esther what do you want what what what what do you want up to half my kingdom and Esther in a true if I could use the word Damsel in Distress says King can you please save my life and save the life of my people the Bible says the King was like what who would there try to kill you and she turned on the table and say hymon the Bible says that hmon dropped to his knees and tried to plead with Esther the king turned and look at us and say in front of me you will attack [Music] her said take this amalaki out and hang him on the same place he tried to morai take this filthy devil out the church take this ungodly Spirit out the church throw him out you may be seated hallu Hallelujah friends there's so much in this we can go on for hours but I want to bring this service to a close the Bible says in fact the historians said in that time when a law was made the king couldn't just take back his own law he had to make a new law so he passed the law saying Jews I can't take back the law but here's what arm yourselves they have set a day to kill you but defend yourself get whatever weapon you can get in fact he back up he backed them up because it was his wife's people he says I'm going to help you get your weapons but the enemy tried to wipe you out but they're not going to kill you you have every right to defend your house you have every right to defend your family you have every right to defend the people of [Music] [Applause] God hallelujah glory to God you may be seated the Bible says God raised morai as second in command of the entire Persian Empire just as Daniel was elevated before him what a type to us raised to the right hand of the king yes can the church say amen amen friends the word is beautiful it's live to us this is not a deep message it's a simple message but I believe in its Simplicity there's a word to encourage you this morning to cut away the things of the world the distractions the evil in your life I'm not afraid to tell you the truth because only the truth will set you free Hallelujah the only way you can backslide is because there's an amalik living in your house amen I look at people in the world sometimes who have their own set of values they dress a certain way they live a certain way and you can't change their minds about how they dress yet sometime in a message somebody walks out the church they put a tattoo on their back want to wear the shortest pants they could wear cut their hair off because these amalekites were growing in their lives all along you should have killed all amen dear am malachit the Holy Ghost wants to fill you but there is stuff that you have to do and there's stuff that God has to do you see killing the amalekites that's your responsibility God never told them I will kill the amalaki he say you go go and kill your amalekites you got to do it you got to clear the way to get your prayer life back in order you have to find God where you left him there is no excuse don't bring a bleaching sheep back into your house and say you know what Saul said he says I brought the Sheep to bring a sacrifice and that's where the scripture is obedience is better than sacrifice because God wants you to obey his word God wants you to love him he wants the word to be alive in your heart friends but Bram said full obedience to the word entitles you to the Token so until you kill the amalekites in full obedience to his word you're just wasting time friends you have to go into action today you have to repent today if you've been harboring am malachit repent today and kill them in your life today but there coming a day when there's a judgment you miss the Rapture you going to judgment and you know what God will say you should have killed all the amalekites because what you allow to grow in your life is what prevented the spirit of God from working effectively in your house in your family amen he said if you love me keep my Commandments keep my Commandments if you love me keep my Commandments come to Church on time come prayed up make a sacrifice do your responsibility pay your tithes give respect in a ministry that's the Commandments of God not your idea not how you feel like that's not it I challenged the prayer meeting last week young people present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service is God is saying it's not too hard to do it friends it's your reasonable service amen young woman in here you hold on to your virtue don't let no demon a Malachi take your [Music] virtue that's your reasonable service young woman who got pants in your closet burn it tonight you don't wear makeup why you got to wake up on your [Music] dresser you a Christian what do you listen to that worldly music for you a Christian why you watching a kind of movie those are amalekites amen amen you find everything else important and you can't find yourself in the house of God playing Church the time for playing church is over let's kill all the amalekites today amen yes sir and as you see the sin begin to live from your life and the doubt and the fear and the unbelief and the ungodliness watch the Holy Spirit begin to ride into the house of God we read the quote on Thursday where brother Bram said I know you get tired of me saying all these things he said but I get tired of seeing you do it amen there is no excuse this morning there is no excuse this morning hallu let's stand to our feet this morning hallu Hallelujah thank you Jesus friends for such a time as this the Holy Ghost is here hallelujah for such a time as this God is here this morning he is here to restore he is here to deliver he's here to set the captives free he is here to Grant the desires of your heart amen maybe there's somebody here this morning just like [Music] Esther you forget who you were you living your own life life forget the urgency the crisis of death that's hanging over the Bible says begin at My Sanctuary at the ancient men those who who have been in the message for a long time and and put a mark slay oh God help us this morning give us more Christians who will say Lord if I perish I perish I'm willing to give everything up this morning to come back to you this morning am may like The Prodigal Son you say Lord I've finally come back to my senses the world has nothing for you out there the world has nothing for you out there you are an overcomer you are born to overcome you are born to stand for such a time as this maybe there's somebody here this morning you don't know Jesus you know about Jesus but you don't know Jesus maybe you're backsliding this morning maybe maybe maybe you haven't been living as you ought to this morning we started the service saying oh come come come come come don't go back home the same that you came because there's death out there you need the token you need a Life of Christ you need a spirit to bring the word seizing you alive oh God help us this morning maybe there's one this morning you can go back home but same when that you came I invite this morning to come to the altar come to the king this morning it was debt it was Deb to stay out it was debt to go in in the Old Testament now it's debt to stay out friends I see one is there anybody else you want to make a stand welcome is there anyone else Lord if I perish I perish Lord I haven't been living as I should but Lord Lord I'm reminded by morai this morning don't think you're going to escape but for such a time as this you were raised up for such a time as this the Holy Ghost is here for such a time as this is there anybody else this morning come while there is still Grace come where there's still an [Music] opportunity but AB brandham exalted us he says listen friends God's spirit would not strive with man forever hallah Hallelujah God's spirit wouldn't strive with Man Forever while there's still Grace friends the Lord said if you go to the king it's death but if the King extended grace to you then you could receive Grace Grace is being extended to you this morning Hallelujah is there anybody else this [Music] morning oh how long will you keep the amalekites in your life friends friends they will grow on you if you don't kill them tonight they will grow on you the little things that you don't

extended to us in such a time as this oh God as the prophet said Lord if you're not prepared today may you be prepared at this [Music] hour but B said I invite every one of you to come not only to say

purifies your soul and gives you new life and New Hope go out with the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's your promise friends Heavenly Father may you touch your people this morning Lord that have come
