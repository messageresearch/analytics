[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] remember a heartache
[39:23] here. It's just a stepping stone.
[39:33] along the
[39:37] path that's
[39:40] climbing always up
[39:45] one. This troubled
[39:50] world is not my final home.
[40:00] So until
[40:04] then, my heart will go
[40:08] on singing.
[40:11] [Music]
[40:14] until
[40:15] [Music]
[40:17] then with
[40:19] joy I'll carry
[40:23] [Music]
[40:25] on until the

[40:32] I
[40:34] behold that
[40:39] city until the
[40:44] God
[40:46] calls me
[40:51] home. The things of
[40:56] earth will dim and lose their value.
[41:06] If we
[41:09] recall their
[41:12] borrow for a
[41:14] [Music]
[41:17] while and things of
[41:22] earth that caused my heart to
[41:30] tremble. Remember
[41:35] death will
[41:37] only bring a
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] smile. This weery
[41:48] world with all its toils and
[41:54] [Music]
[41:56] struggles may take its toll.
[41:59] [Music]
[42:02] of
[42:03] misery and
[42:06] [Music]
[42:08] strife. The soul of
[42:13] man is like a waiting falcon.
[42:22] When it's
[42:26] released, it's
[42:28] destined for the skies.
[42:35] So until
[42:38] [Music]
[42:39] then my
[42:41] heart will go on
[42:44] [Music]
[42:47] singing from
[42:50] [Music]
[42:51] there with joy I'll carry
[42:59] on until the

[43:42] then with
[43:44] joy I'll carry
[43:50] on until the
[43:56] My eyes
[43:58] behold that
[44:02] city until the day.

[1:00:02] He's the reason I'm alive tonight. He's
[1:00:05] the reason I made it over. If it wasn't
[1:00:08] for Jesus, I would not have seen
[1:00:10] tomorrow. But something got a hold of
[1:00:14] me. Something has the res. When I wanted
[1:00:18] to give up, mercy said no. When I wanted
[1:00:22] to throw in the tower, mercy held my
[1:00:25] heart steady. So don't you worry. There
[1:00:29] is a hope for tomorrow. There's
[1:00:32] something. Hallelujah. Something beyond
[1:00:34] the river. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:00:39] Oh, and that something is what keeping
[1:00:41] us alive tonight. Oh, how many happy to
[1:00:44] be in the house of the Lord? How many
[1:00:46] thank God to be in his presence? How
[1:00:48] many know that in his presence is
[1:00:51] fullness of joy? Amen. And we are glad
[1:00:54] to be here together again. Just praising
[1:00:57] the Lord. We know that something good is
[1:01:01] about to happen. Something good is in
[1:01:03] store. every time we are gathered
[1:01:06] together in the presence of the Lord.
[1:01:09] How many thank God for last night's
[1:01:11] service. Amen. And those who were
[1:01:15] here, we know what took
[1:01:17] place. We certainly appreciate our
[1:01:19] brother Gideonov and his
[1:01:21] yielding to the Holy
[1:01:24] Spirit and the message he
[1:01:28] brought. and poured his heart
[1:01:30] out and uh we saw God took a hold of it
[1:01:34] and so we're looking for more of him
[1:01:36] tonight. It is not us doing anything.
[1:01:41] We are mere mortals. We can't pour out
[1:01:44] upon the people. That's that's
[1:01:45] impossible. It takes God to pour out
[1:01:47] upon the people. It takes his spirit to
[1:01:50] convict people and to lead them to the
[1:01:53] cross. You didn't bring yourself
[1:01:55] tonight. You didn't choose yourself
[1:01:57] tonight. God chose you tonight and he
[1:02:01] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[1:02:04] image of his son. And there are not
[1:02:06] enough devils in this universe that can
[1:02:10] stop what God wants to do in your life.
[1:02:13] The devil is 6,000 years too late
[1:02:16] because what Jesus did on the cross for
[1:02:19] us gives us the ability to access his
[1:02:22] grace tonight, to accept his mercy and
[1:02:25] his pardon and his love and his
[1:02:28] redemptive rights tonight. So, we are
[1:02:32] happy tonight. We are brimming with joy
[1:02:35] and we are so grateful for what he has
[1:02:36] already done last night. And so, we're
[1:02:39] looking for more of God tonight. Amen.
[1:02:41] Praise God. So God richly bless you.
[1:02:43] Certainly want to greet you in the
[1:02:45] precious name of Jesus Christ. And it's
[1:02:47] Easter time again by the grace of God.
[1:02:50] We are here once more to celebrate
[1:02:53] Christ. Amen. And while the world has
[1:02:57] their thing going on, uh we know the
[1:03:00] reason for the season. And so we want to
[1:03:03] give him all his due praise, honor, and
[1:03:05] glory. Uh because of what it means to
[1:03:08] us. Amen. He brought us out of darkness
[1:03:13] into his marvelous light. So certainly
[1:03:15] want to greet you all on behalf of my
[1:03:18] wife and the family. We greet the church
[1:03:19] tonight and certainly happy to be in
[1:03:22] fellowship tonight and uh amen in this
[1:03:25] Easter time and uh today and tomorrow.
[1:03:28] We fellowship around the word of God.

[1:03:32] for the song service. Thank you so much
[1:03:34] uh thank you so much Sister Ingred
[1:03:35] Williams for the special this evening.
[1:03:38] We certainly appreciate the worship and
[1:03:40] praise that has gone on. Thank you
[1:03:42] musicians so much um for your music. Um
[1:03:47] the Bible says play skillfully with a
[1:03:49] loud
[1:03:49] noise. Amen. And uh we've certainly done
[1:03:53] that tonight in the spirit of
[1:03:56] excellence. Amen. So we thank God for
[1:03:58] everything. And now as we want to turn
[1:04:00] over to the word by grace of God, I'd
[1:04:03] like to invite your attention to just a
[1:04:05] reading of the scripture. Um we want to

[1:04:26] chapter 2 we want to read

[1:04:38] the grace of God.
[1:04:40] Philippians 2 and verse
[1:04:43] 5 it says let this mind be in
[1:04:47] you which was also in Christ
[1:04:50] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:04:53] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:04:55] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:04:59] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:05:02] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:05:06] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:05:09] humbled himself self and became obedient
[1:05:12] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[1:05:17] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:05:21] him, and given him a name which is above
[1:05:26] every name,
[1:05:28] that at the name of Jesus,
[1:05:31] every knee should bow, of things in
[1:05:35] heaven and things in earth and things
[1:05:39] under the earth, and every tongue should
[1:05:43] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Lord
[1:05:47] to the glory of God the Father. May God
[1:05:52] add blessing to the reading of his word.

[1:08:52] the power and the significance of that
[1:08:55] name, Jesus.
[1:08:57] That's our key objective tonight. And we
[1:08:59] are hoping by the grace of God that
[1:09:01] we'll be able to achieve this key
[1:09:03] objective. Amen. But that's the
[1:09:05] objective of the message tonight. The
[1:09:08] name above every name. Do you love him
[1:09:12] tonight?
[1:09:13] Um, so where do we begin? Let's let's
[1:09:16] start with a
[1:09:18] name. What is a name?
[1:09:21] What is a name? I have a definition
[1:09:25] here. A name is a unique
[1:09:29] identifier. It uniquely identifies
[1:09:32] something or someone or a person or a
[1:09:37] thing.
[1:09:38] A name is a unique identifier of someone
[1:09:43] or something. A name serves as an anchor
[1:09:47] point of your identity. Isn't that
[1:09:51] right? If you want to know who this
[1:09:54] person is, the first thing we have to
[1:09:56] start with is their name. Isn't that
[1:09:59] right? A name serves as an anchor point
[1:10:02] of your identity. We would not know who
[1:10:05] you are unless we have a name that we
[1:10:08] can put to the person that you are.
[1:10:11] Isn't that right? Unless we have a name
[1:10:13] that we could use to identify you. You
[1:10:16] and your name are synonymous. Isn't that
[1:10:19] right? And if we call you by your name,
[1:10:24] there is only one person that can
[1:10:26] respond to that name. Isn't that right?
[1:10:30] When we're born, we're given two names.
[1:10:31] One is a family name and then the other
[1:10:34] is your unique name in your family.
[1:10:37] Isn't that right? So when we want to
[1:10:40] call you, we know how to call you by as
[1:10:42] they say your government name uh as a
[1:10:45] name that is on your your birth paper,
[1:10:48] your birth certificate. The thing that
[1:10:50] identifies you uniquely.
[1:10:53] Each one of us here tonight has a name.
[1:10:56] Every one of us sitting here, we have a
[1:10:59] name and God has a name also. Isn't that
[1:11:03] right? And he is known by his name. Do
[1:11:07] you believe it? And you alone can answer
[1:11:09] to that name. If we shout your name in
[1:11:13] an audience and you are sitting there,
[1:11:15] even if you don't respond, you going to
[1:11:17] feel a certain type of way. If they call
[1:11:21] your name again, you're going to feel a
[1:11:23] certain type of way because they you
[1:11:26] know that they are calling you. You know
[1:11:28] that deep down that is your name and
[1:11:32] only you could respond to your name.
[1:11:35] Isn't that right? It's a feeling you get
[1:11:38] when your name is being called. Isn't
[1:11:40] that right? And if that is just for your
[1:11:43] natural name, then think about your
[1:11:45] spiritual name this evening because you
[1:11:48] have a spiritual name also. There's a
[1:11:51] name that God knows you by. And when he
[1:11:54] speaks that name, there's something in
[1:11:56] you that has to respond to that name.
[1:12:00] When that name is being called, can we
[1:12:03] say amen?
[1:12:06] It grabs your attention.
[1:12:08] Yeah. You've got to answer to your own
[1:12:11] name. It's like a ringing phone. You
[1:12:13] can't help but feel like you've got to
[1:12:15] answer that call because it keeps
[1:12:18] calling over and over and it's coming no
[1:12:20] for nobody else but for you. It's your
[1:12:24] name. Isn't that right? And likewise, if
[1:12:28] someone were to call upon the name of
[1:12:31] Jesus, there is only one person who can
[1:12:34] respond to that name. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:38] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? It grabs
[1:12:40] his attention. It gets his attention.
[1:12:44] Oh, hallelujah. When he when you cry out
[1:12:47] that name, something God has to respond
[1:12:49] to that because only he could respond to
[1:12:52] that name. When it is being called, when
[1:12:56] you are in distress, when you are crying
[1:12:58] in the night, when you don't have an
[1:13:00] answer for the problem that is in front
[1:13:03] of you, when the devil is grabbing at
[1:13:05] your neck, when the devil is scraping at
[1:13:08] your daughter, when the devil is devil
[1:13:10] is trying to get at your son, when you
[1:13:13] are in the night watches and you are
[1:13:16] praying to Jesus, when you cry out that
[1:13:20] name, he has to respond to that name
[1:13:25] when his children begin to cry.
[1:13:29] Oh, there is only one God. There is only
[1:13:33] one spirit that can respond to that name
[1:13:37] when it is called
[1:13:40] Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
[1:13:45] Oh, he's got to respond.
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:49] When you
[1:13:51] call upon his name,
[1:13:59] oh there is but one Lord and one spirit
[1:14:03] and by one spirit we are baptized into
[1:14:06] one body. Oh the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:11] Christ. Oh hallelujah. When you call
[1:14:14] upon the name uh of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ, there is power in that name uh
[1:14:21] power to heal the sick, power to raise
[1:14:24] the dead, power to cast out devils,
[1:14:28] power to defy natural ability, power to
[1:14:32] defy any feeling in your mind, any devil
[1:14:36] that is tormenting you. There is power
[1:14:39] in that name tonight.
[1:14:43] to break past depression, to break past
[1:14:46] frustration, to break past whatever
[1:14:49] condition you are in tonight. There is
[1:14:52] power in that
[1:14:55] name, Jesus.
[1:14:59] Oh, and I just come, we come to speak
[1:15:04] the name of Jesus over you tonight, over
[1:15:08] your condition, over your family, over
[1:15:12] you tonight, over whatever is going
[1:15:14] you're going through. We here to speak
[1:15:17] that name, Jesus, tonight. And watch the
[1:15:20] demons scatter and watch the devils fly
[1:15:23] out of here because there's power
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:29] In that name, oh hallelujah. In that
[1:15:32] name, the dead cannot stay dead. In that
[1:15:36] name, the sick cannot stay sick. In that
[1:15:39] name, the blind cannot stay blind. In
[1:15:43] that name, the cripples has got to walk.
[1:15:46] In that name, the lame has to rise up uh
[1:15:50] and take up their beds. Uh because the
[1:15:53] devil knows that name.
[1:15:58] Oh, that devil, that
[1:16:01] devil, that name will scatter a thousand
[1:16:05] devils. Oh, that name
[1:16:08] Jesus. Don't be afraid to speak that
[1:16:12] name tonight.
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:18] Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:16:21] you could praise God if you want to.
[1:16:23] Amen. This is this is your service.
[1:16:26] Amen.
[1:16:28] But it grabs his attention.
[1:16:30] When you cry out that name,
[1:16:33] the devil gets
[1:16:35] antsy. When you come in that name
[1:16:37] because he could operate when things are
[1:16:41] normal, when you are none the wiser.
[1:16:44] When you are ignorant of his devices and
[1:16:47] what is going on. when you begin to
[1:16:49] bring Jesus into the picture that that
[1:16:53] gets the devil really worked up. He He
[1:16:56] can't operate. He cannot function
[1:16:59] properly. When you bring Jesus into the
[1:17:02] picture, his his cell phone rings, his
[1:17:06] his signal gets jammed because Jesus is
[1:17:10] in the room. Anytime the father is in
[1:17:13] the room, miracles take place. Oh,
[1:17:16] Jericho walls are shaken. Oh, love is
[1:17:20] breaking through when the father is in
[1:17:22] the room. Oh, and I feel the father is
[1:17:26] here tonight. Jesus is here
[1:17:29] tonight. He's here to meet your need.
[1:17:33] He's here to set the captive free.
[1:17:37] He is here.
[1:17:39] All you have to do, like brother Gideon
[1:17:41] said tonight, is believe.
[1:17:43] Accept it. Receive it as a pardon.
[1:17:47] Because it is a pardon. You don't have
[1:17:49] to figure it out. Just believe when you
[1:17:53] call
[1:17:54] on his name.
[1:17:57] Likewise, if you someone to call on
[1:17:59] Jesus, isn't that right? It grabs his
[1:18:01] attention. He has to respond to that
[1:18:04] name.
[1:18:05] The name of Jesus, the Bible tells us,
[1:18:07] is above every name. When you speak that
[1:18:11] name, Jesus, you are summoning the
[1:18:14] highest power that exists in this entire
[1:18:18] world.
[1:18:19] Let me say that again in case you missed
[1:18:21] it. When you invoke, when you speak that
[1:18:25] name, you are summoning the highest
[1:18:27] power that exists in this entire world.
[1:18:31] He is above every judge. He's above
[1:18:34] every police officer. He's above every
[1:18:36] prime minister, above every president,
[1:18:39] above every throne, above every kingdom.
[1:18:42] And the best part, he is your
[1:18:46] father. Oh, do you know who you are
[1:18:49] tonight? You are sons and daughters of
[1:18:53] the king.
[1:18:55] Oh, cry out
[1:18:58] to your heavenly
[1:19:00] father and see if he won't answer you in
[1:19:04] a time of trouble. David said, "He will
[1:19:07] hide me in his pavilion. In a secret
[1:19:11] place, he shall hide me and he shall set
[1:19:14] me up upon a rock and now shall my head
[1:19:17] be lifted up above my enemies and above
[1:19:21] my foes."
[1:19:23] Jesus is the lifter up of my head. There
[1:19:28] shall no evil befall you. Neither shall
[1:19:30] any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:19:33] because thou has made the Lord which is
[1:19:36] thy
[1:19:37] God thy habitation.
[1:19:42] Oh make him your habitation
[1:19:46] tonight. Live in his presence. Walk in
[1:19:49] his presence. Invite his presence.
[1:19:54] Sing songs and spiritual psalms while
[1:19:57] you're in the maxi, while you're in the
[1:19:59] car, while you're carrying out the
[1:20:01] garbage, while you're paying that bill,
[1:20:03] stay in his presence. Pray. Cuz in his
[1:20:06] presence, when you're in his presence,
[1:20:09] you can ask him
[1:20:11] things. While you're having
[1:20:13] conversations with Jesus, in your quiet
[1:20:17] times, you can ask him things. You know,
[1:20:20] daddy, I was supposed to mention
[1:20:22] something that's going on with me today.
[1:20:25] I just wanted to let you know and I'm
[1:20:28] having trouble with something. Talk to
[1:20:30] your heavenly father and let him know
[1:20:33] what's on your heart. Let him know
[1:20:35] what's on your mind. Something came up
[1:20:37] today that's been bothering me a long
[1:20:40] time. Can you take uh these burdens from
[1:20:44] me? Can you take uh these troubles from
[1:20:47] me? How long haven't you spoken with
[1:20:51] your heavenly father? Have
[1:20:54] conversations with Jesus. And while
[1:20:57] you're on the line, let him know your
[1:20:59] trouble.
[1:21:01] While you're in
[1:21:02] conversations, mention those things that
[1:21:06] you haven't spoken to anyone else, that
[1:21:09] you're still healing
[1:21:11] from. Talk to Jesus.
[1:21:14] Jesus can help you.
[1:21:16] Jesus alone.
[1:21:19] I must tell Jesus all of my troubles.
[1:21:23] Oh, hallelujah. All of my burdens unto
[1:21:26] him my role tonight. Oh, can I get a
[1:21:29] little more in the monitors, please?
[1:21:31] Amen. In the back. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[1:21:34] So, do you love him? We're just talking
[1:21:36] about Jesus tonight.
[1:21:39] We're just praying that while we're
[1:21:41] talking, while we're speaking that he
[1:21:44] will come and make it real to you.
[1:21:47] I can't do it. We can't do it in our on
[1:21:49] our of ourselves. We are totally
[1:21:52] dependent on him tonight. Amen. Just a
[1:21:54] little more, please. Amen. Thanks. So
[1:21:56] that name is above every name.
[1:21:59] When you speak that name, you are
[1:22:02] speaking to the highest power that
[1:22:05] exists anywhere on this planet. He
[1:22:09] covers everything as far as Singapore,
[1:22:12] Japan, Antarctica. I don't care where
[1:22:14] you are. God is ruler over all things.
[1:22:19] He has been made ruler over all things.
[1:22:21] In heaven, in the earth, and under the
[1:22:24] earth, he is in charge of it all. Oh,
[1:22:28] hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a mighty
[1:22:30] God we serve indeed. Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] So before God was was God, he was
[1:22:38] Elohim. Isn't that right?
[1:22:40] Before God was a Lord God, he was
[1:22:42] Elohim. He was a self-existent one. We
[1:22:45] talk about this all the time. But the
[1:22:47] point I want to make is that theology
[1:22:49] suggests that we need to identify him by
[1:22:52] a name. So we call him Elohim. We call
[1:22:57] him the self-existent one. But that name
[1:23:00] in itself doesn't really mean anything.
[1:23:03] It just identifies the fact and it just
[1:23:06] highlights the fact that he existed
[1:23:09] alone by himself.
[1:23:11] But there's no meaning we can really put
[1:23:13] to it because the name in itself means
[1:23:16] that he was undefined.
[1:23:18] He was indescribable. There was nothing
[1:23:21] we can relate to or nothing we can
[1:23:23] reference to him. He was alone by
[1:23:26] himself. In other words, there's no one
[1:23:29] else in the room. Just him and him
[1:23:31] alone. No other point of creation, no
[1:23:34] other point of contact, no other point
[1:23:36] of relevance, nothing else that we could
[1:23:38] relate or see him bigger than, smaller
[1:23:41] than or anything. He was just God by
[1:23:43] himself. Though he was not called God,
[1:23:47] so we had to call him something. So we
[1:23:50] call him Elohim in that state and
[1:23:52] condition. But really it is undefined.
[1:23:56] That's just the name we give him in that
[1:23:58] state. Uh but his desire was not to
[1:24:01] remain in that state. So he began to
[1:24:04] create things. And as he began to create
[1:24:06] things, as he began to create the angels
[1:24:09] and the prophet said as they began to
[1:24:11] worship him, then he became God. Now he
[1:24:15] has earned the rightful name God because
[1:24:18] he has subjects to worship him.
[1:24:21] Wherefore he where before he was
[1:24:23] undefined, now he is God. We give him
[1:24:26] the name God because he now is being
[1:24:29] worshiped because God means object of
[1:24:32] worship. Oh, and a lot of times we find
[1:24:35] that God in people's lives are undefined
[1:24:38] because they are not giving him worship.
[1:24:41] They are not giving him praise. They are
[1:24:43] not acknowledging him when they wake get
[1:24:44] out of bed in the morning. So he is
[1:24:46] undefined to them. But the moment you
[1:24:49] begin to raise up your hands, the moment
[1:24:51] you begin to say amen, the moment you
[1:24:54] begin to sing praises unto him, the
[1:24:57] moment you begin to pray, all of a
[1:24:59] sudden it changes. He becomes your God
[1:25:03] because you are worshiping him.
[1:25:09] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. And your
[1:25:13] worship now becomes to define him. He is
[1:25:16] your healer. He is your deliverer. He is
[1:25:20] your hallelujah, your breath, your
[1:25:22] sunshine. He is your all and all. He is
[1:25:25] the wheel in the middle of the wheel. He
[1:25:28] is my rock. He is my fortress. He is my
[1:25:31] God. In him will I trust. Oh,
[1:25:35] hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is my
[1:25:37] deliverer. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:42] Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:25:44] glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[1:25:48] what we come to do tonight. We come to
[1:25:50] worship God. We come to give him praise,
[1:25:53] give him glory, give him honor, tell him
[1:25:56] who he is. Oh, because if you're not
[1:25:58] worshiping God, you're worshiping
[1:26:00] something else. If you can't come into
[1:26:02] the house of God and lift up your hands
[1:26:05] and give God praise, then you are
[1:26:07] worshiping something else. I'm not going
[1:26:10] to let no rock out praise me. I'm here
[1:26:12] to worship my God because he is my God
[1:26:17] in the valley. He is my God in the
[1:26:20] wilderness. He is my God. Oh,
[1:26:22] hallelujah. I've got a reason to shout.
[1:26:26] I've got a reason to praise God.
[1:26:29] Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:44] You might see me acting crazy on a
[1:26:46] Sunday or acting crazy on a Wednesday.
[1:26:50] I've got a story to tell. I'm a I've got
[1:26:53] a reason why I'm worshiping him. My son
[1:26:56] was at death's door sometime during
[1:26:58] COVID 20 2022. Isn't that right? And he
[1:27:01] got an infection and the church was
[1:27:03] praying for him. He had a lump on his
[1:27:05] neck and his body was twitching. The
[1:27:07] doctors didn't know what to do. They
[1:27:08] were getting to ready to rush him into
[1:27:10] an emergency. My wife was the only one
[1:27:13] that was allowed to be with him because
[1:27:15] of CO restrictions. And my wife called
[1:27:17] me one Friday evening and she told me,
[1:27:19] "Honey, I don't know what's going on,
[1:27:22] but the lump on his neck has
[1:27:24] disappeared. I don't know where it is.
[1:27:27] It has disappeared." And from that
[1:27:29] moment, my son begin to walk again. He
[1:27:33] begin to talk again. He begin to live
[1:27:35] again. You tell me I can't praise God.
[1:27:38] The devil is a liar. I will worship my
[1:27:41] God forever because what he's done for
[1:27:45] me.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The devil is a
[1:27:49] liar. He can't get me to come in here
[1:27:52] with a long face. I've overcome by the
[1:27:56] blood of the lamb and by the word of his
[1:27:59] testimony. My son is alive because Jesus
[1:28:03] lives. The doctor couldn't do it. The
[1:28:06] hospital couldn't do it. But God did it.
[1:28:12] Oh, somebody better come get me.
[1:28:21] I won't let no rock out praise me.
[1:28:27] Devil lost the battle. He lost the
[1:28:29] battle. And he lost the battle tonight.
[1:28:32] Oh, hallelujah. is a mighty conqueror.
[1:28:35] If you need healing, he's still a
[1:28:37] healer. If you need deliverance, he can
[1:28:40] deliver. And if you need the Holy Ghost,
[1:28:43] he's going to pour fire into your hearts
[1:28:46] and burn the demons out of you and give
[1:28:48] you the Holy Ghost. He promised you the
[1:28:51] Holy Ghost to them that
[1:28:54] believe to them that obey him.
[1:28:59] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:29:03] Ghost. This promise is unto you, unto
[1:29:06] your children, and as many as the Lord
[1:29:09] our God shall call.
[1:29:11] Then that call upon the name of the
[1:29:13] Lord, the same shall be
[1:29:16] saved. That's what my
[1:29:19] Bible tells me.
[1:29:22] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:25] Huh? So that's why God pass you through
[1:29:28] tests.
[1:29:29] to see that he is faithful to his
[1:29:31] promise. He let you eat the nails. He
[1:29:34] let you run through the thorns. Oh,
[1:29:37] hallelujah. Hallelujah. But at the end,
[1:29:39] it's praises unto his glory to see how
[1:29:43] he works it out in the end. He always
[1:29:46] works it out. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah. And each one of us, I'm sure
[1:29:56] we have a testimony
[1:29:58] of how God broke through
[1:30:01] the darkness.
[1:30:03] The only reason we are here today or
[1:30:06] that our family member or whoever it was
[1:30:07] is here today because of the grace of
[1:30:11] God.
[1:30:12] because of his mercy.
[1:30:14] Because he still is who he says he is by
[1:30:18] his name and for his name's sake. Isn't
[1:30:22] that right?
[1:30:24] So before God was God, he was Elohim.
[1:30:26] Isn't that right? When he began to be
[1:30:28] worshiped, then he became God. Then his
[1:30:31] name changed. Then when he created the
[1:30:33] heavens and the earth and the things
[1:30:35] that there are and the sea and the
[1:30:37] things that there are, then he became
[1:30:38] the Lord God. Isn't that right? that has
[1:30:41] he made creation and man and animals and
[1:30:43] so over. Isn't that right? Amen. So
[1:30:47] that's how it changed. You see the name
[1:30:50] change based on the testimony of who he
[1:30:52] was. Isn't that right? Isn't that right?
[1:30:56] So if someone were to see you and not
[1:30:58] know your name, all we could say is that
[1:31:00] brother there or that sister there that
[1:31:03] does that thing on a Sunday or that
[1:31:05] brother that does that thing on a
[1:31:06] Wednesday. I don't know his name, but
[1:31:08] that's what he does. We if we don't know
[1:31:10] your name, then all we could talk about
[1:31:12] is what you do.
[1:31:15] Isn't that right? If we don't know how
[1:31:17] to call you, then all we could talk
[1:31:19] about is your testimony. But I don't
[1:31:22] know that brother's name, but I know
[1:31:24] he's always praising God. I don't know
[1:31:27] that sister's name, but when she comes
[1:31:29] to church, she makes a lot of noise. She
[1:31:32] needs a lot of elbow room because she's
[1:31:35] got a fire that nobody can control.
[1:31:38] She's got a fire that God put in there
[1:31:40] that the devil can't take out. She's
[1:31:42] been through some rough mountains and
[1:31:44] some deep valleys, but she knows that
[1:31:47] her God is real. And when she lifts her
[1:31:50] hands up and she prays to her father,
[1:31:52] she knows that father is hearing to hear
[1:31:55] what she has to say, she has all
[1:31:58] confidence just like Esther to go into
[1:32:02] the presence of the king. And she knows
[1:32:05] her father will hold out a scepter for
[1:32:08] her and give her an
[1:32:11] audience. Whatever you
[1:32:13] want up to half my
[1:32:16] kingdom because he loves you and you are
[1:32:20] his child. You are his servant.
[1:32:24] You have an audience with God
[1:32:27] because of who you are.
[1:32:29] And you could use that name.
[1:32:32] Aba father. You could use that name.
[1:32:35] Praise God. Because of your relationship
[1:32:38] with this Lord God. Isn't that right? Oh
[1:32:41] my. So if someone was to say, "Who is
[1:32:44] that?" They would say, "That brother,
[1:32:45] that sister, identify you by your
[1:32:47] works." Well, then God was so mysterious
[1:32:51] that coming down through all the ages,
[1:32:54] all people could really do was identify
[1:32:57] God by his own works. But there was no
[1:33:00] name that they could give to him in that
[1:33:02] sense. He was just the God of Abraham.
[1:33:05] He was just the God that was with Isaac.
[1:33:08] If you know Abraham and if you know his
[1:33:11] testimony, then I am the God that spoke
[1:33:14] to Abraham. I am the God that spoke to
[1:33:17] Isaac. I am the God that spoke to Jacob.
[1:33:20] I am that God that was with Joseph.
[1:33:24] Hallelujah. Oh, I am that same God
[1:33:26] tonight. I am the God that healed the
[1:33:29] sick. I am the God that spoke and I am
[1:33:32] the God that revealed mystery and
[1:33:34] vision. I am the God that shook the
[1:33:36] earth. I am the God that raise up
[1:33:39] mountains. I am the God that bring down
[1:33:42] kingdoms. I am the God that crushed the
[1:33:45] hand of Pharaoh in the lives of the
[1:33:47] people. I am that God. I am the mighty
[1:33:50] God that come down on the mountain. Oh,
[1:33:53] that shook the mountain. The mighty God,
[1:33:57] the ring of fire, the power that they
[1:34:00] felt, the voice that made them tremble.
[1:34:03] I am that God tonight. That God is here
[1:34:06] tonight. That God, you might not be able
[1:34:08] to see him, but his pillar of fire, his
[1:34:12] mighty fire, his mighty presence, his
[1:34:15] mighty spirit surrounds the whole earth
[1:34:18] with his glory. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:23] Oh,
[1:34:25] hallelujah. That God is here.
[1:34:30] Hallelujah. And he has veiled, all of
[1:34:34] his might, all of his terror, all of his
[1:34:38] powerl into his word. And when we hear
[1:34:42] the word of God, it is that same
[1:34:44] thundercloud
[1:34:46] speaking to us, anointing us, inspiring
[1:34:50] us. No wonder when we come into the
[1:34:53] house of God and we hear the word of
[1:34:55] God, we are revived. We feel lifted. We
[1:35:00] feel burdens lifted. Why? Because that
[1:35:03] power and that glory is in the word
[1:35:07] giving you a charge. Jesus said, "My
[1:35:11] words, they are spirits and they are
[1:35:14] life." Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[1:35:18] Oh, one day this word going to turn the
[1:35:21] spirit and life in you. Then the thing
[1:35:24] that you are trying to achieve, the
[1:35:27] spirit of God is going to come over you
[1:35:31] and give birth to a new thing in your
[1:35:34] soul and life. And that thing will be
[1:35:37] called
[1:35:39] Jesus Christ.
[1:35:41] The same yesterday,
[1:35:43] the same
[1:35:44] today, and the same forever.
[1:35:47] Hallelujah.
[1:35:51] He didn't give out his name.
[1:35:54] He didn't really give out his name. Ask
[1:35:57] him who he was. I am the God of thy
[1:36:00] fathers. Mysterious
[1:36:03] prophet said never giving out his
[1:36:05] mystery in full. But in every prophet
[1:36:08] was a shadow was a type of who he was in
[1:36:12] David. He was the shepherd in David. Oh,
[1:36:15] hallelujah. Isn't that right? Oh, he was
[1:36:17] a prophet in Samuel. He was this. He was
[1:36:20] that. Always a a shadow and a type of
[1:36:23] who he was. Coming all down through the
[1:36:26] ages.
[1:36:28] He remained mysterious.
[1:36:30] Though showing a little bit of himself,
[1:36:32] every step of the way, hallelujah. But
[1:36:35] we didn't see the whole of him. It was
[1:36:36] just a part here, a piece there, a
[1:36:40] mystery revealed here, and a revelation
[1:36:43] shown there. But but never the whole
[1:36:45] thing. Never being able to see the whole
[1:36:48] picture. Isn't that right? So we only
[1:36:51] know by the testimony of his works.
[1:36:52] Isn't that right? Praise God. And when
[1:36:54] Moses Moses when he asked, he said, "Who
[1:36:57] shall I say sent me?"
[1:37:00] What Moses was really saying was, "Lord,
[1:37:03] you've told me all these things."
[1:37:05] Remember, he was at the burning bush
[1:37:08] having a conversation with God. After
[1:37:11] years of searching, after years of
[1:37:14] questions over his own life, he was
[1:37:17] finally in contact with this
[1:37:19] supernatural being called God who had
[1:37:22] called his life for a purpose. But up
[1:37:24] until that time, he had a lot of
[1:37:26] questions. But in five minutes, God was
[1:37:29] able to answer every question that he
[1:37:32] ever had about his life before that
[1:37:34] time, even up until that moment. And
[1:37:37] here's Moses asking a question now. And
[1:37:40] what he's really saying is, "Lord,
[1:37:42] you've told me all these things, but I
[1:37:43] don't know how to identify you. I don't
[1:37:47] know what to call you because when I go
[1:37:49] down to Egypt, they're going to ask me
[1:37:51] who sent you, and I don't know what
[1:37:54] answer to tell them. I've met you. I've
[1:37:57] heard your voice. I've felt your
[1:38:00] presence. I've seen your fire for
[1:38:02] myself. Oh, but I don't know what to
[1:38:04] call you. What? Who shall I say has sent
[1:38:07] me to give this message to Pharaoh? Who
[1:38:11] shall I explain? How am I supposed to
[1:38:13] put words to what I'm feeling right now?
[1:38:16] I just received a presence. I was just
[1:38:19] at the altar. I was just on my knees.
[1:38:22] Something happened in my soul. Something
[1:38:24] happened in my body. I can't explain it.
[1:38:27] What do I say? give me the words to
[1:38:30] speak or do I tell the people that he is
[1:38:34] real, that he has a
[1:38:37] name. And God told Moses, "Tell them I
[1:38:42] am that I am. That I am that I am that I
[1:38:47] am. I am that I am." That name doesn't
[1:38:51] end. Oh, you have to tell God what he is
[1:38:55] to you. That I am that. Do you need a
[1:38:58] healer? I am that. Do you need
[1:39:01] deliverance? I am that. Do you need a
[1:39:05] breakthrough? I am. That I am. That I
[1:39:09] am. That I am. That I am. And he is here
[1:39:13] tonight. That I am is still here
[1:39:16] tonight. That I am is here to fill you.
[1:39:20] That I am is here to fill you with the
[1:39:22] Holy Ghost. Is there to seal you. Is
[1:39:24] there to mend your broken heart. I am
[1:39:27] that I am. That I am that I am.
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:37] He's still the I am today.
[1:39:41] Just as sure as he was when he spoke it
[1:39:44] to Moses thousands of years ago, he's
[1:39:48] still the I am today.
[1:39:51] He's still that same God today.
[1:39:54] doing the same things he did back then.
[1:39:57] He's still doing the same things
[1:39:58] tonight.
[1:40:00] Our God omnipotent reign it. Do you
[1:40:02] believe it tonight?
[1:40:04] My time is running along. Let me just
[1:40:07] hurry up here. I am that I am. It
[1:40:09] doesn't end until you ask what you need.
[1:40:13] Then that is what he becomes. He causes
[1:40:16] himself to become whatever you have need
[1:40:19] of by his own name. Oh my.
[1:40:25] So what is the significance of a name?
[1:40:27] Now the act of naming as far as the
[1:40:31] Bible goes and we see it all through the
[1:40:33] Bible in different shadows and
[1:40:35] types that the act of naming is an act
[1:40:37] of authority.
[1:40:40] The act of naming someone or something
[1:40:43] is usually done in an act of authority
[1:40:46] or power. When a name is given, the
[1:40:50] giver of the name is actually asserting
[1:40:52] dominance. He's asserting control over
[1:40:56] what he is naming over whoever he is
[1:40:59] naming. Isn't that right? He is
[1:41:02] asserting power over it. A level of
[1:41:03] authority is actually being exercised.
[1:41:06] Amen. You need an
[1:41:08] example in Genesis. We find that when
[1:41:11] God brought all of the animals before
[1:41:13] Adam, he as brought the animals before
[1:41:16] him, the Bible said to see what name he
[1:41:19] would give to
[1:41:20] them. Here was a son that was in the
[1:41:23] Garden of Eden in position as a son of
[1:41:26] God placed by God in the garden
[1:41:30] as CEO over all of the domain of earth.
[1:41:33] Amen. Here is a son in position now
[1:41:36] exercising his authority over the
[1:41:39] animals that God had created. Adam
[1:41:42] himself did not create the animals. God
[1:41:45] created the animals. But it was Adam's
[1:41:48] job now to give these animals a name
[1:41:52] because up until that time, these
[1:41:54] beasts, these fowls of the air, these
[1:41:57] birds, these fish of the sea, they had
[1:41:59] no name. They were just beasts and fowls
[1:42:02] and they were just created things. So
[1:42:05] now God leave out left a specific
[1:42:08] portfolio for his son to fulfill and to
[1:42:12] give a name to every creature that was
[1:42:14] created. Isn't that right? And Adam in
[1:42:18] his authority, in his dominance, in his
[1:42:20] power, in his office is now signing off,
[1:42:24] signing off, signing off executive
[1:42:26] orders. This one shall be named that.
[1:42:29] this shall be named that and what God
[1:42:32] said whatever name he named it was the
[1:42:34] name
[1:42:35] thereof from that time since Adam named
[1:42:38] the animals to this time now that name
[1:42:41] has remained the
[1:42:43] same that is the kind of authority that
[1:42:46] Adam had whatever name he gave was the
[1:42:50] name
[1:42:51] thereof many many amen that kind of
[1:42:54] authority is what is coming back in the
[1:42:56] sons of God is what is coming back in
[1:42:59] the church of God in the last days.
[1:43:01] Whatever you do that with that is what
[1:43:04] it shall be. So, isn't that right? It
[1:43:06] shall be done. Amen. Your check is as
[1:43:08] good. Your signature is as good as your
[1:43:11] father's. Oh, and if you pronounce
[1:43:13] healing, then healing is yours. If you
[1:43:15] pronounce deliverance and deliverance is
[1:43:17] yours. The prophet said she does it in
[1:43:20] his name. Oh, she will have his
[1:43:23] potentials. Whatever she does, God will
[1:43:26] back it up. Oh, hallelujah. with the
[1:43:29] authority of God behind it.
[1:43:33] Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:43:36] So this is a son in position in his
[1:43:39] display of power and authority. He is
[1:43:40] now doing something about his position.
[1:43:43] He is fulfilling his right as a son of
[1:43:47] God to name God's own creation and to
[1:43:51] give them a name thereof. And whatever
[1:43:54] name they got was a name that remained
[1:43:56] forever. Isn't that right? So, it's it's
[1:44:00] an act of authority to speak a name over
[1:44:03] someone. Parents perform an act of
[1:44:05] authority when they speak a name over
[1:44:08] their children. When they give their
[1:44:10] sons or their daughters a name, it's a
[1:44:13] way it's a it's a demonstration of their
[1:44:15] authority over the child. They are
[1:44:17] actually prophesying over the child.
[1:44:19] They are releasing a spirit upon them.
[1:44:21] That's why it's very important what name
[1:44:23] you give to them because whatever name
[1:44:26] you give to them is will be the name
[1:44:28] thereof. Amen. So be careful. Prophet
[1:44:31] used to talk about Ricky or something
[1:44:34] like that. I think he said in a message
[1:44:36] he said why would people children give
[1:44:38] their name? Why would parents give
[1:44:40] children a name like that? And he went
[1:44:42] on to explain that the name Ricky means
[1:44:44] rat or something or some kind of uh file
[1:44:47] thing. And he said, "You got to be real
[1:44:49] careful what names you give to your
[1:44:50] children because every behind every name
[1:44:53] has a spirit. It has a life has a
[1:44:56] testimony behind that name. Behind the
[1:44:59] name Joseph, behind the name Joshua has
[1:45:01] got a spirit. It's got a life. It's got
[1:45:03] an attribute behind it. So be careful
[1:45:07] what name you give." The act of naming
[1:45:10] is a very a very important thing. People
[1:45:13] call it a light thing, but but but it's
[1:45:16] very important.
[1:45:17] So you go around calling your dog
[1:45:19] Hitler. You
[1:45:21] know what do you expect when Hitler
[1:45:24] bites the
[1:45:25] neighbor? It's kind of your
[1:45:29] fault. So the act of naming, you see,
[1:45:31] it's also an act of
[1:45:33] prophesying. The name is like a
[1:45:35] prophecy. Amen. Isn't that right? And
[1:45:37] what does it mean to prophesy? To
[1:45:39] prophesy means to testify of an
[1:45:41] experience or to foretell of something
[1:45:44] that is fixing to take place. So when
[1:45:47] God announces or proclaims a name,
[1:45:50] sometimes he might even change a name.
[1:45:53] We know that. Isn't that right? We've
[1:45:55] seen many name changes throughout the
[1:45:57] scripture. And that acts as like a
[1:45:59] prophecy over the individual to whom
[1:46:02] he's changing the name. There once was
[1:46:05] something, but now there's something
[1:46:07] else. They once was Saul, but now they
[1:46:10] turn to Paul. They once was Jacob, but
[1:46:13] now they're Israel. They once was Abram,
[1:46:16] but now they're Abraham. It announces a
[1:46:19] change of season. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:46:22] it's as a prophecy. Every time you utter
[1:46:25] that name, you are prophesying over them
[1:46:28] what the promise of God is over their
[1:46:31] life. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[1:46:35] So when Abram's name was changed to
[1:46:37] Abraham that meant he was father of
[1:46:40] nations that meant every time God called
[1:46:42] Abraham name he is prophesying over him
[1:46:47] Abraham. Abraham the prophecy of the
[1:46:51] father of nations is being spoken over
[1:46:54] him. It's being breathed over him every
[1:46:57] time he calls his
[1:47:00] name. Do
[1:47:03] you get it now?
[1:47:05] Amen.
[1:47:07] Joseph needs to add. So every time you
[1:47:10] call his name, that prophecy keep
[1:47:12] calling. Every time his father call him
[1:47:13] Joseph,
[1:47:14] Joseph, what do you think is happening?
[1:47:16] Prophecy is going out. This is the one
[1:47:19] who is going to come to bring profit, to
[1:47:21] add, to increase. Praise God. Isn't that
[1:47:23] right? And sooner or later, that
[1:47:24] prophecy took place. Praise God. It's
[1:47:27] always like an act of prophecy to
[1:47:28] breathe something over the individual to
[1:47:31] speak over them a name, a new name.
[1:47:33] Isn't that right? And in heaven has a
[1:47:36] book of names also. Isn't that right?
[1:47:38] And each name there is like a prophecy.
[1:47:41] It has a life in it. Has a spirit behind
[1:47:44] it. And it is in the form of a seed. The
[1:47:47] word of God. Oh, hallelujah. A word that
[1:47:50] is connected to it that must come forth
[1:47:53] in its time and in its season. What are
[1:47:56] you saying preacher? There is a book
[1:47:58] tonight that it is in the hands of the
[1:48:00] angel and in that name book is every
[1:48:02] name that was supposed to come forth in
[1:48:05] 2025 and in that name is a prophecy. It
[1:48:09] has a life and it has a spirit connected
[1:48:12] to it. Oh that in their time in their
[1:48:15] season oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:18] hallelujah it's going to come forth and
[1:48:20] the prophet said your name is not leave
[1:48:23] or all rabbits. Oh, it doesn't say that.
[1:48:26] It just shows a mystery of what the book
[1:48:29] is while it is calling those names. So
[1:48:32] when the mystery is being preached,
[1:48:34] there's a prophecy, there's a life,
[1:48:37] there's a spirit being spoken out and
[1:48:40] somebody's going to respond because that
[1:48:43] is their name.
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:49] Oh, do you get it now? Are you
[1:48:52] connecting the dots now?
[1:48:54] Hallelujah.
[1:48:57] Hallelujah.
[1:48:58] Your name is written there before the
[1:49:02] foundation of the world. That is what
[1:49:05] the devil is trying to fight all along.
[1:49:08] Fight you from seeing your name. Written
[1:49:10] in the lamb's book of life. Fight you
[1:49:13] from seeing your name in the book of
[1:49:15] redemption. A book of names. Names that
[1:49:18] cannot be erased. Names that cannot be
[1:49:21] taken out. Because Jesus with his own
[1:49:24] precious blood wrote your name down. He
[1:49:28] took his own blood and wrote your name.
[1:49:32] Not leave, not all Roberts, but the
[1:49:35] mystery of what the book is while it is
[1:49:38] calling those names. Oh, it just shows a
[1:49:42] mystery and something released and
[1:49:45] catches you by
[1:49:50] revelation because that holy thing in
[1:49:52] you was
[1:49:54] predestinated to respond to that name to
[1:49:58] respond to that mystery when it is being
[1:50:00] preached. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[1:50:06] Glory. Glory.
[1:50:09] Amen.
[1:50:10] But Brandham said here on Jehovah Gyra.
[1:50:12] Now when Abraham's Isaac was born, of
[1:50:15] course he called him Isaac, which was a
[1:50:18] promised one. God had promised Abraham
[1:50:21] had changed his name from Abraham to
[1:50:23] Abraham. He was going to make him a
[1:50:25] father of nations. And in that line, the
[1:50:28] prophet said he is the father of
[1:50:30] Germany. He is the father of America and
[1:50:34] the father of Sweden, of everywhere. He
[1:50:38] is the father of nations. Oh, because
[1:50:41] God said so. Abraham, the father of
[1:50:44] nations. He's the father over
[1:50:46] everything. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:50:49] Hallelujah. We are the children of
[1:50:51] Abraham. Seed, royal seed of Abraham
[1:50:54] tonight. According to the prophecy, the
[1:50:57] prophet said he was going to take his
[1:50:59] boy and he was going to through him
[1:51:02] bless all of the nations. You see what
[1:51:05] he was? He was a type of Christ. Born
[1:51:08] the impossible way. Talking about Isaac.
[1:51:10] Born the impossible way. The only son of
[1:51:13] the father. And in every way he typed
[1:51:16] Christ. Prophet said on Isa as I was
[1:51:18] with Moses. He said Jacob when he was
[1:51:20] born being a twin she called him a
[1:51:23] suppler. Jacob. But when he had got his
[1:51:26] overcoming power and wrestled with an
[1:51:29] angel, God changed his name from Jacob
[1:51:33] to Israel. a prince. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:38] Hallelujah. Because of our experience
[1:51:40] that he had. Oh, it announced a change
[1:51:42] of season. He couldn't carry that old
[1:51:45] name anymore. Oh, God. Give him a new
[1:51:47] name to prophesy over him. The promise
[1:51:50] that he g to him. The victory that he
[1:51:53] had won through his wrestling, through
[1:51:56] his ri, through his crying, through his
[1:51:59] perseverance all night long, God gave
[1:52:02] him a victory. And I believe God wants
[1:52:04] to give us a victory tonight by your
[1:52:07] wrestling, by your praying, by your
[1:52:11] perseverance, by your coming to church.
[1:52:14] Regardless of how you feel, every
[1:52:16] Sunday, every Wednesday, through the
[1:52:19] victory, God's going to give you
[1:52:22] announce a change of season in your
[1:52:24] life. Oh, breathe a prophecy over you.
[1:52:30] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:33] That name has something to do with your
[1:52:34] life. He said when Peter a fisherman had
[1:52:38] overcome by his faith in Jesus, he said
[1:52:41] your name is Simon, but I'm going to
[1:52:44] call you Peter which is a rock. He
[1:52:47] prophet said it changes you. He said
[1:52:50] your name has something to do with it
[1:52:53] and your placement in life. Oh
[1:52:56] hallelujah. He's going deeper now. Oh,
[1:52:58] he's talking about your position, your
[1:53:00] place. God has a place for you and it's
[1:53:03] according to the name that he has given
[1:53:05] you. Oh, isn't that right? Each one of
[1:53:08] us has a name. There's something that we
[1:53:10] have to claim. Isn't that right? God
[1:53:13] raised up the Lutheran to bring forth
[1:53:15] justification. He brought up the Wesian
[1:53:17] to bring forth sanctification. He's got
[1:53:19] a place for us tonight. It's not only
[1:53:22] justification. It's not only
[1:53:23] sanctification, but it is perfection. So
[1:53:27] in that name is a promise of perfection.
[1:53:30] And God is going to place you, the true
[1:53:33] church of God, in perfection so that you
[1:53:36] could call up the dead in Christ.
[1:53:39] There's a place for you. God has a name
[1:53:43] for you. He's going to fulfill you by
[1:53:47] that name. Fulfill his promise to you.
[1:53:49] Isn't that right? Amen. And your
[1:53:52] placement in life. He said, "And when
[1:53:53] this great thing taken place, when each
[1:53:55] of these Hebrew mothers, he said, in the
[1:53:58] travailing of child birth called out
[1:54:01] like Reuben," he said, and that placed
[1:54:04] them positionally in Palestine. They
[1:54:07] weren't there yet. But he said the
[1:54:09] mothers when they were travailing in
[1:54:10] birth giving birth to these sons when
[1:54:13] they cried out Reuben that placed them
[1:54:16] he said that placed them positionally in
[1:54:18] the Palestine exactly the way that the
[1:54:20] mother said and called his name said it
[1:54:23] he said I don't have it all wrote down
[1:54:25] here but he said Ruben meant shape
[1:54:27] hurder he said God meant cattle raiser
[1:54:31] Ephraim meant corn raiser and so on he
[1:54:34] said and now by spiritual discernment
[1:54:36] Joshua the newly leader. He said by
[1:54:39] spiritual discernment he placed each one
[1:54:41] where they belonged
[1:54:44] by the name that was given to them
[1:54:47] through birth and travail of their
[1:54:49] mother. Amen. Isn't that right? Place
[1:54:51] each one where he belong and divided the
[1:54:53] land just exactly. God had a purpose in
[1:54:56] naming them and God raised up Joshua to
[1:54:59] fulfill that purpose. Years later, years
[1:55:02] and decades later, isn't that right? And
[1:55:05] the prophet said, "A very beautiful type
[1:55:07] today." And we in the adoption season
[1:55:09] now. And he said, "And what we need is a
[1:55:12] Joshua for today." Who is Joshua today?
[1:55:15] The Holy Spirit. He said, "Joshua
[1:55:17] today." And he said, "The trouble today
[1:55:19] is that when we come into our promised
[1:55:21] land, he said God want to raise sheep
[1:55:24] like a Ephraim." He said, "And one want
[1:55:27] to raise something like the other." He
[1:55:29] said, "And every man want to be the
[1:55:31] same." Isn't that right? Every man want
[1:55:33] to be a evangelist or every man want to
[1:55:34] be a apostle or this or that. Isn't that
[1:55:36] right? He said but let God give one man
[1:55:39] a gift of healing. He said and every man
[1:55:42] want a gift of healing. Ephraim and God
[1:55:44] and all of them want to mix. All of them
[1:55:46] want to become one. He said but we're
[1:55:48] divided by our
[1:55:50] position. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Divided
[1:55:56] only by our position we are divided.
[1:55:58] Isn't that right? Praise God. We still
[1:56:00] have the love of God for each other. We
[1:56:03] still exercise brotherly kindness. But
[1:56:05] you've got to find your place in the
[1:56:07] word. Not do what somebody else is doing
[1:56:09] or try to do what some other sister is
[1:56:11] doing. They've got their place. You've
[1:56:14] got to find yours. The Bible said, "Make
[1:56:16] your calling and your election sure. It
[1:56:20] is an individual affair. You are not
[1:56:23] responsible for anybody else's position.
[1:56:26] You have to mind your business. Make
[1:56:28] sure and mind your business and let them
[1:56:31] mind
[1:56:33] theirs. Do you get it now? All right.
[1:56:37] Good. Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[1:56:40] Hallelujah. So by spiritualism. Isn't
[1:56:42] that right? We are divided by opposition
[1:56:45] and all don't have a gift of wisdom. All
[1:56:47] don't have prophecy. All don't speak
[1:56:49] into with tongues. All are not prophets.
[1:56:53] But God has set in the church some that
[1:56:56] prophesy. Some that speak with tongues,
[1:56:59] we want to make them all speak in
[1:57:01] tongues. See, but he said, see how the
[1:57:03] confusion will be. He said, but then you
[1:57:04] can't get nowhere. Well, the Philistines
[1:57:07] would take over then in a little bit. He
[1:57:09] said sure. But he said when each man by
[1:57:11] a leader who separated them by spiritual
[1:57:14] discernment and placed them into the
[1:57:16] body there they remained and become the
[1:57:19] cream of the earth. Showing full well
[1:57:22] that God could only bless you when you
[1:57:25] are in your position. When you are in
[1:57:28] your chair that was assigned for you.
[1:57:31] That's the only time that God will bless
[1:57:33] you when you're where he needs you to
[1:57:35] be. It might be in the valley. It might
[1:57:38] be in the wilderness, but if that's
[1:57:40] where he wants me to be, then that's
[1:57:43] where I'll be. Take the lower seat.
[1:57:46] Don't take the high seat just in case
[1:57:48] you get displaced when someone higher
[1:57:52] comes to sit in that seat. Oh, that
[1:57:54] Jesus taught us to take the lower seat
[1:57:57] so that when you are called to the
[1:57:59] front, God's going to put you in your
[1:58:02] seat. in your chair. The chair that was
[1:58:05] designed for you to sit in.
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:10] Oh, hallelujah. He that overcome will I
[1:58:14] grant to sit with me in my throne, even
[1:58:17] as I have overcome and set with my
[1:58:19] father in his throne to overcome and God
[1:58:23] will place you positionally. Isn't that
[1:58:25] right? God give us a Joshua. The prophet
[1:58:28] said, "God give us back a Joshua that
[1:58:31] will hold the commission with the word."
[1:58:34] And we believe he will do that in due
[1:58:36] season. Isn't that right? Praise God.
[1:58:38] Amen. So, let me hurry along here now.
[1:58:39] Wow. Time is already fast spent, but do
[1:58:42] you get it now? God is known by his
[1:58:44] testimony. He's known by his testimony
[1:58:47] through the prophets. Isn't that right?
[1:58:50] And there's a reason why God is called
[1:58:51] Jehovah Gyra. Because the testimony of
[1:58:54] Abraham when he went to the mountain to
[1:58:57] obey God's commandment and to offer up
[1:59:00] his only son, the angel stops Abraham
[1:59:03] and says, "Now I know that you love me."
[1:59:06] He called him twice out of heaven. He
[1:59:08] said,"Abraham, Abraham, hold your hand.
[1:59:12] Now I know that you love me, and in
[1:59:14] blessing I will bless thee. In
[1:59:16] multiplying I will multiply thy seed."
[1:59:19] And when Abraham looked, he saw a ram
[1:59:22] that was caught in the thicket. And
[1:59:24] Genesis 22:14 said, "And Abraham called
[1:59:27] the name of that place, Jehovah Gyra."
[1:59:31] As it is said to this day, in the mouth
[1:59:33] of the Lord, it shall be seen God had
[1:59:37] provided for himself a sacrifice. And he
[1:59:40] is called Jehovah Gyra because he
[1:59:43] provided a a substitute. He provided a
[1:59:46] ram in the thicket. He provided a
[1:59:49] substitute for us today in the form of
[1:59:52] Jesus Christ who taught it not a robbery
[1:59:54] to be equal with God. Oh, but suffered
[1:59:57] all things, who suffered crucifixion,
[2:00:00] even the cross that he might be offered
[2:00:03] up once for sin at all time. Oh,
[2:00:07] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[2:00:09] right? And he is called Jehovah Gyra
[2:00:11] today because of the testimony of
[2:00:14] Abraham. how he had proved himself to
[2:00:17] Abraham on the mountain. That is how he
[2:00:20] got the name Jehovah Gyra. It's not just
[2:00:23] a loose h wild thing. We don't just call
[2:00:26] him Jehovah Gyra because we think we
[2:00:28] know what he is. We call him that
[2:00:30] because he had proved himself to be just
[2:00:32] that. Gyra, a provider. And when you
[2:00:36] walk the street, he is a provider. He is
[2:00:39] Jehovah Gyra. When you are on your job,
[2:00:42] he is Jehovah Gyra. He is providing for
[2:00:45] you. Your money is not coming from your
[2:00:48] boss. It is God that give the boss money
[2:00:50] to give to you. He is the one that is
[2:00:53] providing. He is the one that is giving.
[2:00:56] He is the one that is raising you up. He
[2:00:59] is the one that will promote you when
[2:01:02] the time is right. He is Jehovah Gyra.
[2:01:05] He is taking care of all of your needs.
[2:01:09] He is continuing to improve to prove
[2:01:12] himself over and over
[2:01:16] to be exactly what he said he was
[2:01:20] years and ages ago. Isn't that right?
[2:01:22] He's still the same today. Isn't that
[2:01:25] right? God prove himself. Isn't that
[2:01:26] right? To be Jehovah Rafa. To be Jehovah
[2:01:29] Missy. Isn't that right? I'll skip down
[2:01:31] through there. We have all the quotes
[2:01:33] and everything for it, but time is
[2:01:34] already fast spent. But you get the
[2:01:36] picture. Amen. God is many things. Isn't
[2:01:40] that right? And all the way down through
[2:01:42] the scripture, the name of God is
[2:01:44] connected to his testimony. The God of
[2:01:46] David, the God of Samuel the prophet,
[2:01:49] the God of Daniel, but his name remain a
[2:01:52] mystery. There's no name. That's just
[2:01:54] the God of his testimony and the
[2:01:56] promise. He gave his name Jehovah.
[2:01:58] Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah Nissi. Seven
[2:02:01] compound names. But but but but still
[2:02:03] not giving his mystery in full. just as
[2:02:06] a type and a shadow and a type and a
[2:02:08] shadow. Isn't that right?
[2:02:11] Until we come to Isaiah and Isaiah
[2:02:15] 53. In Isaiah, he speaks here under
[2:02:18] inspiration. And we know that this
[2:02:20] outlines the coming Messiah that is
[2:02:23] promised to come and take the sin of the
[2:02:26] world. Isn't that right? Isaiah 53 said,
[2:02:28] "Who had believed our report? And to
[2:02:31] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[2:02:34] For he shall grow up before him as a
[2:02:36] tender plant, and as a root out of a dry
[2:02:39] ground. He hath no form, nor comeliness.
[2:02:43] And when we shall see him, there is no
[2:02:46] beauty that we should desire him. Oh,
[2:02:49] hallelujah. He is despised and rejected
[2:02:52] of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted
[2:02:57] with grief. And when we and we hid as it
[2:03:00] as it were ourselves from him, he was
[2:03:04] despised and we esteemed him not. Surely
[2:03:08] he had bought our griefs. He had carried
[2:03:11] our sorrows. And yet we did esteem him
[2:03:14] stricken and smitten of God and
[2:03:18] afflicted. He was wounded for our
[2:03:21] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[2:03:23] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[2:03:26] peace was upon him and by his stripes we
[2:03:30] are healed.
[2:03:33] Oh, doesn't that testify of my Jesus
[2:03:37] tonight? Oh, hallelujah. and no beauty
[2:03:41] that we should desire, but a revelation
[2:03:43] in our hearts as to who that man is that
[2:03:47] walked the streets of Jerusalem, that
[2:03:49] heal the sick, that raised the dead,
[2:03:52] that cast out devils.
[2:03:56] Hallelujah. It took a
[2:03:58] revelation to see who that man was.
[2:04:02] Because the great men of the day, the
[2:04:05] great influencers of that day, the great
[2:04:07] YouTubers, the great Facebookers of that
[2:04:10] day would have told you a completely
[2:04:11] different story. They would have painted
[2:04:14] that man in your mind as a beelub, as a
[2:04:17] heretic. They would have paved painted
[2:04:20] that man as a madman, as a as a crazy
[2:04:22] prophet, as some kind of a wild man, as
[2:04:25] someone who doesn't know what he's
[2:04:26] talking about or doesn't know what he's
[2:04:28] doing. But if you ever come to a service
[2:04:30] one time, if you ever encounter Jesus
[2:04:33] one time, you might have a different
[2:04:35] story because what they were saying
[2:04:37] about him was totally different from
[2:04:40] what that man really was. And when you
[2:04:43] meet him, we him for yourself, not what
[2:04:46] someone else says. But when you meet
[2:04:49] him, when you have an encounter with
[2:04:51] this man, Jesus, oh your walk is going
[2:04:55] to be different, your talk is going to
[2:04:57] be different because in that name, oh is
[2:05:00] a name that is above every other name.
[2:05:04] Oh, there was no other name. No other
[2:05:07] man walked like that man. No other man
[2:05:09] spoke like that man. No other man had
[2:05:12] authority like that man. He spake as one
[2:05:15] having authority. He said, "Peace, be
[2:05:19] still." And the storm rolled up and went
[2:05:23] away. He had power over the elements,
[2:05:26] power over the demons, power over the
[2:05:29] devils, and he still has power today. I
[2:05:32] challenge you tonight. Lift up your
[2:05:35] hands and cry out the name of Jesus and
[2:05:39] see if God don't rescue you. See, if God
[2:05:42] don't do the same
[2:05:44] things that he promised he would do in
[2:05:48] his word, he is the same yesterday. He
[2:05:51] is the same today. He's the same
[2:05:53] forever. He is the same Jesus.
[2:05:58] I was
[2:05:59] crucified and hung on a
[2:06:01] tree. He was
[2:06:03] rejected, killed, murdered on a cross.
[2:06:07] His blood poured out for us because he
[2:06:10] loved us and he made a way for us to
[2:06:13] come to perfection. He made a way for us
[2:06:17] as many as as loved him. To them he
[2:06:21] called and he given them the power to
[2:06:23] become the sons of God. Amen and amen.
[2:06:27] Do you believe that? Amen. And this
[2:06:29] scripture layers prophecy from the time
[2:06:32] Isaiah spoke it for about 700 years
[2:06:35] since he had spoken it. That word layers
[2:06:39] prophecy. Oh, hallelujah. Was wounded
[2:06:41] for our transgressions, bruised for our
[2:06:42] iniquities, chastisement of our peace.
[2:06:45] They were just nice words on a scroll
[2:06:47] from the prophet Isaiah. But there was
[2:06:49] no one to manifest those words. There
[2:06:53] was no person that ever come forth to
[2:06:55] live the words of that scripture. So
[2:06:57] that scripture remained a scripture.
[2:06:59] That scripture remained a mystery as to
[2:07:02] who this man was, as to who would come
[2:07:04] and fulfill this. There was no one
[2:07:07] worthy to fulfill this. There was no one
[2:07:09] righteous to fulfill this. There was no
[2:07:11] one with power to fulfill this. No one
[2:07:13] with authority for to fulfill this.
[2:07:16] Isn't that right? All of a sudden, here
[2:07:19] comes Luke 1:26. And the angel came to
[2:07:23] her, talking about Mary, and he said,
[2:07:25] "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord
[2:07:29] is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst
[2:07:31] women." Oh, hallelujah. Don't care how
[2:07:35] many Marys there were in that time. God
[2:07:37] had a predestinated Mary to bring forth
[2:07:40] the mystery of Jesus Christ in that time
[2:07:43] and in that hour. And I don't care how
[2:07:45] many churches, how many brides there has
[2:07:47] been. There must come one. tonight will
[2:07:51] fulfill Jesus Christ in their hour, in
[2:07:54] their season, and in their time. Yes,
[2:07:57] I'm looking at you tonight. You are the
[2:07:59] words of the book to fulfill
[2:08:02] prophecy.
[2:08:05] Oh,
[2:08:06] hallelujah. Think it not strange. You
[2:08:09] are who you are tonight. God has raised
[2:08:12] us up for such a time as this. Oh,
[2:08:16] hallelujah.
[2:08:17] Hallelujah. Right with me. Are you
[2:08:19] almost
[2:08:20] finished? When she saw him, she was
[2:08:23] troubled at his saying and she cast in
[2:08:25] her mind, "What manner of salutation is
[2:08:28] this?" Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We do
[2:08:30] the same thing when we see the word
[2:08:32] speak to us. Tell us we are healed. Tell
[2:08:35] us we are delivered. Tell us we are
[2:08:37] restored. It blows your mind because you
[2:08:40] didn't think for a million years God
[2:08:43] would think of you that way. But I ask
[2:08:45] you a question. Where was thou when I
[2:08:48] laid the foundations of the earth? When
[2:08:51] the morning stars sang together, and
[2:08:53] when the sons of God shouted for joy,
[2:08:56] you were there. And God wrote your name
[2:08:59] in the lamb's book of life. And your
[2:09:01] name has Holy Ghost in it. Your name
[2:09:04] power in it. Your name of perfection
[2:09:06] promises laid up for
[2:09:09] you. Think it not strange tonight. What
[2:09:13] manner of salutation is this? Oh, God
[2:09:16] sent an angel to herald Mary. And God
[2:09:20] has sent his angel. He sent us a prophet
[2:09:23] to call you out of darkness, to call you
[2:09:26] out of Laudisia, and to announce the
[2:09:28] Christ that's going to be veiled in your
[2:09:31] hearts, in the manger of your hearts.
[2:09:35] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:38] And the angel said unto her, "Fear not,
[2:09:41] Mary, for thou has found favor with God.
[2:09:45] Fear not, bride of Christ. You have
[2:09:47] found favor with God. And behold, thou
[2:09:50] shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring
[2:09:53] forth a son, and his name shall be
[2:09:56] called Jesus, and he shall be great, and
[2:10:00] he shall be called the son of the
[2:10:03] highest, the Lord God, and shall give
[2:10:06] unto him the throne of his father David.
[2:10:10] And he shall reign over the house of
[2:10:13] Jacob forever. and his kingdom there
[2:10:16] shall be no end.
[2:10:19] Oh, this is the word of the angel. Do
[2:10:23] you receive it
[2:10:25] [Applause]
[2:10:28] tonight? Then said Mary unto the angel,
[2:10:32] how shall this be? See, and I know no
[2:10:34] man. And the angel answered and said
[2:10:37] unto her, "The Holy Ghost, the Holy
[2:10:39] Ghost, the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[2:10:42] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[2:10:46] overshadow thee, and all that holy thing
[2:10:49] that shall be born of thee shall be
[2:10:52] called the son of God. You are promised
[2:10:56] a glorious, wonderful baptism of the
[2:10:59] Holy Ghost and fire." Yes, I'm looking
[2:11:02] at you tonight. And that holy thing
[2:11:05] shall be born in you. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:11:07] The Holy Ghost shall come upon you. Oh,
[2:11:10] and shall burn in
[2:11:12] you. The gift of God, which is Jesus
[2:11:17] Christ. Oh, he's going to live in you.
[2:11:21] He's going to put on your tie, your
[2:11:23] clothes, your dress.
[2:11:26] He's going to live in your flesh.
[2:11:30] Oh, that is your promise today.
[2:11:35] Oh my my my
[2:11:38] keep on riding. We're almost finished.
[2:11:42] Hallelujah. My my
[2:11:45] a name above all names. My
[2:11:49] and he told he said he also told him
[2:11:50] behold thy cousin Elizabeth she has also
[2:11:53] conceived a son in her old age and this
[2:11:56] is the sixth month with her. She was
[2:11:58] called barren but now she is 6 months
[2:12:01] with a child. The angel said because for
[2:12:03] God nothing shall be impossible. This is
[2:12:07] the same thing that God told Abraham. He
[2:12:11] told him your your wife shall surely
[2:12:13] have a child for nothing shall be
[2:12:15] impossible. Oh, it's the same God saying
[2:12:19] the same things that he spoke to
[2:12:20] Abraham. He came and told Mary for God
[2:12:24] with God nothing shall be impossible and
[2:12:27] that God is saying the same things
[2:12:29] tonight whatever condition whatever
[2:12:32] situation whatever problem you're facing
[2:12:35] with God nothing shall be impossible God
[2:12:39] is going to fill you I don't care what
[2:12:41] sin you have committed with God nothing
[2:12:45] shall be impossible I don't care how
[2:12:48] lost you feel I don't care how depressed
[2:12:50] you feel I I don't care how frustrated
[2:12:52] you feel with God. Nothing shall be
[2:12:56] impossible. God is able tonight to break
[2:13:00] the chains of the enemy, to break the
[2:13:02] chains of
[2:13:03] Lucifer. Let my people go. Hallelujah.
[2:13:08] Glory. Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[2:13:13] Woo. Hallelujah.
[2:13:16] Hallelujah.
[2:13:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm almost
[2:13:21] finished. And Mary said, "Behold the
[2:13:24] handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me
[2:13:28] according to thy word." And that's what
[2:13:30] we say tonight. Be it unto me according
[2:13:34] to thy word. The Bible said the angel
[2:13:36] departed from her. Musician, get ready
[2:13:39] to come and Mary arose in those days.
[2:13:42] The Bible says she went into the hill
[2:13:43] with with with in hill countries with
[2:13:46] haste and she went into the city of
[2:13:48] Judah and she entered into the house of
[2:13:51] Zacharas and saluted Elizabeth. And it
[2:13:54] came to pass that when Elizabeth heard
[2:13:57] the salutation of Mary, when she heard
[2:14:00] the words, when she heard the message of
[2:14:04] that angel, the baby in her womb, which
[2:14:08] was John and Elizabeth, the baby leaped
[2:14:11] in her womb. And the Bible said, and
[2:14:15] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[2:14:17] Ghost. As soon as that message was
[2:14:20] released, a revival take place.
[2:14:23] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[2:14:25] Ghost. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:29] Hallelujah.
[2:14:31] Glory to God. My my my
[2:14:34] my
[2:14:36] Oh. Oh.
[2:14:39] Hallelujah. Woo. I feel a revival is
[2:14:44] coming down the line. We have received
[2:14:47] the words of the angel. And that holy
[2:14:49] thing shall be born in you.
[2:14:56] Oh, receive it the Holy
[2:14:58] Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:01] Hallelujah. He is releasing his power.
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:14] And she spake with a loud voice Elise.
[2:15:18] And she testified filled with the Holy
[2:15:20] Ghost. She said, "Blessed art thou among
[2:15:22] women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
[2:15:25] womb. And when is this unto me that the
[2:15:28] mother of my Lord should come to me? For
[2:15:31] lo, at the voice of thy salutation,
[2:15:34] sounded in my ears. The baby has leaped
[2:15:36] for joy. And blessed is she that believe
[2:15:39] it." That's you here tonight. Blessed is
[2:15:42] she that believeth, for there shall be a
[2:15:45] performance of those things which were
[2:15:48] told to her by the Lord. Oh, it shall
[2:15:52] be. There shall be a
[2:15:55] revival. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:59] Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory,
[2:16:03] glory, glory, glory, glory. Oh
[2:16:07] my, oh my.
[2:16:11] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:13] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Do you believe
[2:16:16] it tonight? Oh, you're going to stand.
[2:16:19] I'm going finish. Christ with his own
[2:16:22] blood as a high priest anointed with the
[2:16:25] power of God. He raised from the dead
[2:16:28] and tore down the dominion of Satan. And
[2:16:31] as he broke that domain, he went through
[2:16:34] the heavens. Beyond the heavens. The
[2:16:37] prophet said he went beyond the heavens.
[2:16:39] You can begin to stand. And he was come
[2:16:42] to the lowest on the earth. And he was
[2:16:44] received up into heaven. And God set him
[2:16:47] on a pinnacle until he has to look down
[2:16:51] to see heaven so high is this man called
[2:16:54] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Has to look down
[2:16:56] to see heaven. He said, "Amen." He said,
[2:16:59] "No wonder. He is the mighty conqueror.
[2:17:03] He stands yonder today in that domain
[2:17:08] forever and ever. Oh hallelujah.
[2:17:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isaiah said unto
[2:17:15] us a son is born and unto us a child is
[2:17:18] given and his name shall be called
[2:17:20] counselor, prince of peace, mighty God,
[2:17:24] the everlasting father and of his domain
[2:17:27] there shall be no end. Forever and ever.
[2:17:31] He will reign on the throne of David,
[2:17:33] seated in the heavens far above. Every
[2:17:36] angel, archangel, principality, and
[2:17:39] power, he tore it down and spoiled it at
[2:17:44] his crucifixion and his resurrection.
[2:17:47] Everything that Satan had, Jesus tore it
[2:17:50] down. He broke through the veil of sin.
[2:17:54] He tore it apart with the high priest
[2:17:57] blood of his own body. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:18:00] It was a veil, a veil of sickness that
[2:18:03] was held over the people. The prophet
[2:18:06] said he tore it apart for he was wounded
[2:18:09] for our transgressions and by his
[2:18:11] stripes we were healed. He went through
[2:18:15] the great veil under. Begin to play
[2:18:18] something softly. Oh, hallelujah. The
[2:18:20] great veil of sin. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:18:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[2:18:24] right? Went through the great veil of
[2:18:26] worry. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[2:18:29] enter the presence of holies. Oh hal. He
[2:18:32] went through that veil of worry. He went
[2:18:34] through that veil of fear. He tore
[2:18:37] through every one of them down and
[2:18:40] ascended so high and received the name
[2:18:43] that is above every name that named in
[2:18:46] the heavens above or in the earth below
[2:18:49] or in a world to come. God took that
[2:18:53] lovely one
[2:18:55] who stooped down so
[2:18:57] low that even he didn't have a place to
[2:18:59] be born or a place to die. But God
[2:19:03] exalted him on high and gave him a crown
[2:19:06] of glory under a name that is above
[2:19:10] every name. And there he sits today and
[2:19:14] we say tonight a mighty conqueror. There
[2:19:18] he sits tonight. A mighty conqueror. He
[2:19:22] rent every veil into the veil of sin was
[2:19:26] rent into. The veil of sickness was rent
[2:19:31] into the veil that kept you away from
[2:19:35] God. That veil was rent into. I am the
[2:19:40] way. I am the truth. I am the life. I am
[2:19:44] the door. He broke every power. He
[2:19:48] scattered every
[2:19:51] devil. Hallelujah. And he made a search
[2:19:54] light from glory. From that day on, I am
[2:19:58] finished tonight. Lift up your hands.
[2:20:02] That Jesus is here tonight. The same
[2:20:05] one, the same conqueror, the mighty
[2:20:08] conqueror. He tore every veil tonight. I
[2:20:12] don't care what's holding you back from
[2:20:14] the presence of God. He tore that veil
[2:20:17] tonight to make a way. Not just for you,
[2:20:21] but for your children. He made a way.
[2:20:25] Why don't you uh under the sound of my
[2:20:27] voice, begin to cry out, begin to speak
[2:20:30] that name, begin to call upon the name
[2:20:34] of Jesus, that name that is above every
[2:20:39] other name. He's here to deliver. He's
[2:20:42] here to restore. He's here to baptize.
