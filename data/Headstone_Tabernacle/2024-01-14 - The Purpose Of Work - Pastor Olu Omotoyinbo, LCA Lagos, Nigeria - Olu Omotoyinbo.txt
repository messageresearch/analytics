Hallelujah Hallelujah feel good in here this morning praise God praise God praise God I love it I love what I feel and I trust to got a word from that exhortation on wednes on Friday sanctify yourselves the Lord will do great things among us and that sanctification is not a one time thing it has to become a way of Life how you want to live I have to start with your mind because sanctification is set your mind in order of Holiness we don't know what Holiness is but God could take us by his word to show us exactly what his Holiness is so we have a special service for you so bless you this morning but I want to read from Jeremiah chapter 2 you can sit right where you are I want to read the scripture moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus say the Lord I remember the kindness of thy youth the love of thine disposals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in the land that was not SW Israel verse three was Holiness unto the Lord and the first fruit of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them sayeth the Lord hear ye the word of the Lord House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel thus sayeth the Lord and this is them that struck me what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they have gone far from me and have walked after vanity and become vain Lord verse six neither said they where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt that led us through the Wilderness through the land of desert and pits through the land of drought and the shadow of De through a land that no man passed through where no man dwelleth and I brought you into a PL plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when he entered he defiled my land and made my in Heritage and Abomination we're going to get into this sometime in the future but I just a little introduction and you know what you see you see God's love for his people and his Mercy extended to them by giving them the truth of his word but you know what is amazing about the Lord he doesn't Force anybody he can't force you to sanctify yourself he can't force you to clean up your act you have to want to do that you have to want to cut off the world you have to want to cut off all them crazy friends you have to want God and to love him with all your heart your mind and your soul you have to want that God are going to arrest you and tell you love me and serve me no no no no no he said you even consult me to say where is the god that brought you out I brought you out I brought you to a good land I brought you to a land full of milk and honey and look how you're treating me look how you're dealing with me what iniquity did you find in me where was I not faithful where wasn't I loving and caring where I didn't protect you and bring you through praise God when you was D out I bring you out when you fell I pick you up when you was sick I heal you oh glory to God when you was blind to make it to see what iniquity have you found in me that you would treat me that way oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God he was challenging them to acknowledge he is God that brought them out Oh Glory Hallelujah and that is why when he turn on them and say his anger his Fierce anger he will burn them he will run them he will send the sword after them he would run them to the end of the Earth you can understand the justice of God and the righteousness of God and he tell them that they want to operate from the devices of Their Own heart and many time you hear me preach people have the god of their imagination they imagine what God thinks but God is the word when we read from the scripture you're hearing who God is how he thinks Oh Glory to God and I love it he said what iniquity have you found in me there's no iniquity in God in him is light in him is truth in him is righteousness Oh Glory to God God want you to be holy because he is Holy he wants you to be righteous because he is righteous is not our holiness is his Holiness he want you to live Sanctified Oh Glory to God he want you to cut off the world he want you to walk in the light of his goodness and his grace that he can bless you and multiply and run the enemies before you oh glory to God that's a God we serve the god of armies oh the god that protects the god that Shields oh

reisen resurrected Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who came down from his glory that ever leing story God bless you at this time I'd like to your attention to the scriptures Joshua Joshua I'm sorry Deuteronomy chapter 28 Deuteronomy 28 and read verses 1 to 14 and then I will also read Ecclesiastes 91-111 may let me read Ecclesiastes 91-1 for us let you sit down then I'll continue with Deuteronomy 28 Ecclesiastes chapter 9: 10 and 11 are I read this last week and I'm reading again whatsoever thy hand find to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave with thou goest which is the way of every man I return and saw under the son that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bre to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill but CH and chance happen to them all CH and chance is opportunity happens to everybody I don't have no opportunities it's not true scripture says it happens to them all amen may the Lord add his Blessing to reading of his holy words seated while I continue reading I read from Deuteronomy 28 um ver 1 14 please remain s there the musicians because I always forget you there and then you leave but just remain together today okay um um I see want to do a song okay Deuteronomy 28: 1-4 um two weeks ago I think it was read Deuteronomy 8 which is when they were on the way to the promised land this they are still on the way to the promised land on the way to the promised land he was reviewing the last 40 years with them and telling them about what God had told them and remember don't forget remember don't forget because you have been slaves in Egypt and in the in the wilderness you have been there and now you are going to a land where you're going to have abundance in Egypt as slaves you never had enough in the wilderness you had just barely enough but now you are going to the a land where you are going to have abundance don't forget me that's what the Lord is telling them because he knows he he made us he knows how we are wired he knows when we have some small stuff in our pocket you know we forget him that's just the way of man that's why he says they that will be rich in this world will fall into diverse Temptations and they have their souls you know um with a P with a with with an arrow something like that so um so in this place here is is is telling them the blessings and I'm going to tell this to work because it's telling them the blessings that will come from their work um he had told them Deuteronomy 8 they they're going to land where is plenty and and and and they're going to have to walk with their hands but they're going to like be blessed and he going to give them power to create wealth and all of that power they were getting as we were going through the Wilderness and um so is now this is a bit more specific about what the blessings are what the um um wealth is so just listen here Deuteronomy 28: 1- [Music] 14 and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth so they different the the different it doesn't matter what the nation it matters not what the nation will set you up and above every nation on Earth because this is the king kingdom of God which is not in any particular place or location but it's where because the spirit of God the spirit moves where it wants where it listed and the the the the the uh the spirit of God is all over the world like the song like the song says all over the world the spirit is moving as the waters cover the Seas that's what God is not bound by boundaries Borders or anything like that so uh um you you will um you'll set you on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shall hearen unto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shall thou be in the city and blessed shall I be in the field you know this remember the song Abram's blessings of mine and blessed going out and blessed coming in that's where it's from this chapter here blessed shall be the fruit of thy body this is it's telling you the fruitfulness the milk the horny in the land shall be the fruit of thy body some translations say the fruit of thy womb you'll be blessed in the fruit of thy womb so you don't need to cry about anything that's the promise you will be blessed in the fruit of your womb amen and the fruit of the ground remember fruit be fruitful that's what he's talking about the milk the fruit will come out of the ground for you abundance in abundance the fruit you'll be blessed in the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind and the Flux Of thy sheep your business the things that you do the works of your hand bless shall be the basket and thy store you have a store blessed it shall be this is the all figurative of like your different you know um um involvements in life that's what God's telling them when you get the promised land blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shall thou be when thou goest sh I'm blessed going in and blessed going out Abraham's blessings man because these are Abram's blessings I shall bless you and you'll be a blessing it will overflow Beyond you to other people the Lord shall Cause th enemies that rise up against the to be smitten before thy face this is part of the milk and horny in the land they shall come and thee one way whatever it be whatever it be and flee before these seven ways you have any enemy you have any challenge they'll come up against you one way they'll flee not that they'll walk away they'll flee from you seven ways uh because I'm not here next Sunday not will I'm likely to go to um um the O Church the convention in nature so I'm trying to see if I can compress got a bit in here today I God don't like doing that 1 Hour 1 15 minutes is just enough and I strike it above that but um but I want to try and get somewhere today so because the next time will be two Sunday time and Christmas chicken and all that you've forgotten so so um Samilia loves because she knows the truth yeah so um so I want to try and see if I can get that here and try to try to let you see you know how when you operate in this Kingdom this are not ordinary words these are not just talking words when you operate in this Kingdom how things how things how everything comes together I want to show you from the Bible how the things come together Hey Kevin bless you stand up Kevin H Kevin God bless you Kevin we see you when he coming when he coming town oh yesterday oh that's great God bless you good to see you how long are you here for two weeks okay we got to we got to catch up okay bless you Kevin good to see [Applause] you so um see I I was saying I want to show you how what you do because um what you do in the Kingdom how the kingdom works for everybody in the Kingdom once you ready to do your part the kingdom works works for everybody in the Kingdom there's no maybe if or maybe not there's nothing like that the Nigerian economy may not work for you but that economy works for everybody God's economy works for everybody amen I mean I I'm not hearing you it's not working for you because it's not working for you and that's why we are talking here so that you will turn it around so it can start working for you because that's what God determined that it should work for his children amen W verse 7even the Lord shall cause the enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come against thee one way and flee before the seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses is telling you about the milk and horny now that you walk with your hands and these are the results of it the because know it say you got to work but he saying the Lord sh the Lord sh the Lord sh the Lord sh because it's the Zeal of the Lord that's going to do this it's not so much your work you got to do something but you can't say the work of my hands have gotten me this because the work of your hands will get you you put in 10 you put in 100% the work of your hand gets you 100% but if you put in 100% And you are repping 1,000% you know that's not the work of your hands [Music] that's the Lord shall do this this because the Bible says the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this that scripture amen amen the Lord shall command the blessing upon the in thy storehouses and in all that thou set thine hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee that's like someone bless the man who walks not in thee who stand it not in the way of Sinners sit in the seat of his scel or walkth in the way of ACC the Council of angoli you you are Bible scholars everything he doeth shall prosper that's scripture scripture you know the devil fights us a lot with your fear you're full of Faith until the time to receive the blessing then you know doubts coming that's just the way you know we are we wired and that's why um we we'll talk a little bit okay so um so he'll bless you in all you set your hands into and um um the work of your hands he'll bless you verse n the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he ha sworn unto thee a royal priesthood a holy nation a kingdom of priests and and uh a kingdom of Kings and Priests you were Kings priests unto the Lord King in the natural realm priest in the spiritual realm Marin together that's what he wanted do with Israel that's what he's telling them hereall um um the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he has SW unto thee if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods because is the land of abundance that's why he's telling them don't forget me verse don't forget me remember don't forget remember don't forget shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle again and in the fruit of thy of thy ground in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to give Thee the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand that's what it is that's where it is that's been the program all the time to bless the work of their hands he was still provide for them supernaturally but that's not the way he's going to do it every single day so that it's not until they see the supernatural Operation God is not with them the Lord shall open unto the his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto the land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shall lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow that's abundance amen that's prosperity like I say so prosperity for that's Bible Prosperity that's what Pentecost talk about get real this gospel here is not a Prosperity Gospel that's what Pentecostals do Prosperity Gospel the people are preaching and the preacher is preaching not all of them but generally that's the that's the the thing they're preaching and telling you think how you are going to get your abundance is like by Supernatural just ducts on your laps it doesn't work like that that's not scripture that's unscriptural it just drops on your lap so people are people are sowing SE and expecting something to just happen it doesn't work like that doesn't work like that it comes by the work of your hands Prosperity Gospel that they preach is um the preachers many times see the people as an ATM machine and to S seeds $1,000 $5,000 $2,000 and all that stuff and the preacher has all the money to himself and the people are there trusting God and for many of them one two here something might happen but many of them those things don't happen because it's not scriptural so I'm not talking about that kind of prosperity I'm talking about the gospel of the kingdom of Jesus Christ which says I wish above all things that you prosper and be in in good health even as thy soul prospers so we we lead with soul Prosperity first seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness so your soul is prospering deep within you and Paul said above everything else I wish that you prosper in your natural Endeavors even as your soul prospers so that's where that's where we're coming from not Prosperity Gospel this the gospel of the Kingdom but it has prosperity in it amen because God promised in it to supply all your need and this is scripture here amen verse 13 and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail and thou shall be above only and thou shallal not be beneath either thou her King unto to the Commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day to obser excuse me to observe and to do them always the caveat which which what we've been talking about this past five six weeks and thou shall not go aside from any of The Words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left hand to go after all the gods to serve them that's Mammon amen the spirit of Mammon amen the Syrian God of riches people are so you know like all of all that just so focused on the riches career this that that that that those things are important but put them in their proper perspective that's what the that's what the gospel of the kingdom is amen all right may the Lord add his Blessing to reading of his holy words God bless you and once again good morning I want to do a song down from his glory ever living story can if you get if you can get the song or sham somebody [Music] there [Music] M [Music] than [Music] there's not a conventional Christmas song but I like do for

you thank you amen God bless you may be seated you bless you um I'm sorry these are um bit about the church me is taking much much longer than I thought it would but I just feel um I feel impressed in the spirit to um just Che it all in so because I it's going to be about 2 3 weeks maximum four weeks but this is number seven now we trying to get you a background because um um we started off with the Israel the crisis they had in the promised land which they should not have been talking about any crisis in the promised land he took heat to all of these things that God told them all through the Wilderness years and especially the last 2 3 weeks and because all that happened in Deuteronomy took place in about two three weeks one two 3 weeks really and um Moses doing a review of the last 40 years with them and so that they'll know when they get the promise just to prepare them so that they will not fail in the promis land yet Israel still fail and that failure resulted in them going after the gods and that's another story Al together how the steps how those things happen and because nothing has changed because the devil sees it walk why why should he change the winning plan so he just does his thing over and over again it might come to fit the times the mo to modernize the things to Feit the times but you know we see the same thing so so anyway so um um so Israel had this crisis back and forth and about for about 320 years they had six periods of conquest and prosperity conquest and prosperity adury and all of that and things so that's what we have been talking about if you been here you know um that's what we been talking about try to get into history of the Bible to let's see what happen so trying to show you these were people who should not have failed at all and this was what had the promised land why should the land of that was supposed to be full of Plenty just suddenly become a land that is full of um land that is um um excuse me a land that is um um excuse me why should the Land of Plenty become a land of famine the land of Conquest why should it be but that's what happened and that's the story we've been trying to trying to follow um this past several weeks so anyway so um in preparing them for the promised land try to show you there were slaves in Egypt and um in the land of Egypt was a land of not enough and slaves don't get enough you are because you are the mercy of somebody else to give you your daily sustainance and they just give you what they think you are you deserve what they think should feel fill you feed you for the day and that's what they do and that's what slaves are and that's what they were in the promise I mean the in Egypt so when they're talking in Egypt about we go back to Egypt go back to Egypt go back to Egypt so you can see the mentality there see the mentality that just so so um don't consider so worthy of the great promise that God has given to them not because they don't think God is able but because they H they just don't have the faith to to um get there because they feel once god promise you just fall on your laps but for so many reasons it doesn't happen like that that's where we were uh um last week so so the in the promised in the wilderness they had they had just enough just enough and if you if you um um um if they try to preserve it for another day the Bible said it's PA God s you that the worms head it up and I'm saying have you ever seen people who make a lot of money a lot of money I mean not talk about people who have who win the lottery people who you know bet Niger and all those things that win a lot of money but it doesn't last something just happens some the worms just eat it up you can be left L of inheritance too the worms just ate up because you are Wilderness man you can't manage abundance you can manage abundance say I know this money can never finish you really don't trust in uncertain riches the Bible it's not certain so and all of those things are are are because the real way God wanted to bless them was to bless the work of their hands but if you notice he said the work of their hands but he also told them don't say the work of my hands have gotten me this here here here the the the the very quick solution let me just sh you that right away you're walking but your walk your hands cannot bring the increase it's the Lord that brings the increase so even though you walk it's healing but it requires you to work so that when it paes rain upon the Earth there will be something that you have for him on the earth here not just your hand in your pocket you know loafing around but it's not the work of your hands that gotten you anything anything at all all right so so that's where we were and so trying to show you the background of work work and so um so we'll pick a back with that story um that story today about work because um um we went all the way back to Adam and show that Adam actually had to work in the Garden of Eden how many believe that Adam had to walk in the Garden of Eden because that's the very purpose why he came to came on Earth that's why we're here walk is not a result of the Fall walk was here before the fall and I'll show you and I I'll just try to you know talk with you talk to you and um um so um but when the fall came Adam did the same work still if you if you read the Bible Genesis 2 Genesis 3 it was still to teal the ground same instruction before the fall as after the fall but just the circum is changed and we'll try and get into that a little bit today but really the original work was with God himself hallu God himself was the first one that thought up the idea of work and worked because I mean all of our children know from in this church here from when they very small Elohim and what the work of creation that's work so God was the first one that did work this was a a God that worked a God that went to work that was the god of Israel go the Bible in the beginning God created that creative work that creative act is work the Bible started with God working you see God working so go work is not a result of the Fall what is as old as this world and the universe is because when the worldall burst on the scene the universe B of the sin Genesis 1:1 we find God walking in the in the in the in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and Genesis 2:2 also says that God saw all the work that he had made and behold it was very good and God rested from all his work that he had made so work at all is the very idea of of work so you little kids or older kids older people my age younger than me older than me what is not about your boss it's not about your mom making you do more you should do or your dad what is God's idea in the first instance can you say amen amen so because it originated from God and God is a spirit God is spiritual because work originated from God work is a spiritual thing what is not a natural Canal thing work is spiritual can you say Amen what is a spiritual thing amen I told you last week that Adam was able to EXP Express his his attributes the qualities the potential in him through the Avenue of work where is that coming from from God because it was through the Avenue of work that God was able to express his characteristics his qualities his attributes it was when he walked that it came out work of creation his creative path came out work of redemption intive attributes came out in the creation work allowed God to express his attribute of Creator work what is an opportunity to express something that's that's hidden on the inside something that's boxed in on the inside of you something that cannot come out what is an outlet to let it flow out amen and in the Redemption of man also for those of you are very spiritual very spiritual what is he talking about in the Redemption of man also what also brought out the attribute of Redeemer in him that's why he sent his son he came down himself down from his glory everling story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger amen walk brought out God's attribute of Redeemer and Jesus alluded to this when he said my father WTH hither to and I work they asked him what must we do that he might work the works of God said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he has sent so God is the worker God the one that [Applause] works Jesus said to them it's not me that doeth the works but my Father which dwelleth in me he do the works if you can't believe me believe me for the very Works sake work work can you go on your job and say believe me for the very Works sake work so God expressed all his great attributes all his Essence the essence of God love the essence of God he Express all that through the Avenue of work therefore I'm sure you can see that already that Jesus also fulfill his own life's purpose to redeem Mankind through the Avenue of work when they met him at the um his um Mary and Joseph were looking for him when they went to the for the census and they men said like son where have you been your father and I I've been looking for you he said I've been working must I not be about my father's business my father's work and brother bam said even that line showed like that he was telling he was rebuking Mary in a very gentle way how can you call that Joseph my father my father is God I come from God I go back to God again you know that and I must be I'm but B say if Joseph was his father Joseph's business was the carpenter shop and he should be in the carpenter shop at that time even though he work in Joseph's car but he said right here I'm talking with these people here I'm being about my father's work amen so Jesus could only fulfill his life's calling through the Avenue of work and so did Adam and so will you and I the only way you are going to be able to feel your last coin is who they have in your work where you have a problem is that because you look at work as a very natural kind of thing I'm that work is spiritual I just show you that Jesus is saying all he came here to do was work Healing The Sick raising the Dead all that was work God creating the world you want you want to speak into into existence that's work work hallah so because sometime we get very spiritual very spiritual like that I'm like the berans I'm checking what they're saying um I'm welcome that anytime anytime you got to help me this thing keeps poing off on me I don't know what's going on here okay all right uh I grw up so anyway so um so Adam like Jesus you know fulfilled his purpose here through the Avenue of work Adam like God his father had attributes like I said brok up on the inside of him potential talents qualities that were on the inside of him but they needed expression and Outlet to come out it's not by doing prayer is always part of it but it's not by doing prayer that the attributes come out it work God could just stay there and just dream it and the world will come into existence he didn't have to get up from his majesty and actually do the work work so just like God had attributes in him that needed to be released through work need to be expressed they could only find expression through work Adam the same thing you and I the same thing so it was in order that these qualities and these attributes could be expressed that God designed and created work that's why work is spiritual not Canal there's nothing Canal comes from God all good and perfect things come from God work is a spiritual thing and when you understand that today if you've never understood it your param ship will totally revolutionize your life every single minute of every single day let me say that again if you will hon understand what I'm saying here to to you today about work your Paradigm will so shift in other words your warv is so shift it will totally revolutionize your life and upgrade it to a totally different another level can you say Amen a I know you don't believe that but say Amen all the same amen hallelujah um last Su um jelle told me that have you left the wilderness said you say you're a very nauy girl that was a good one that was a very good [Laughter] one and then I heard one of the young Brothers said that to another person and said like so when I come to church please nobody should ask me for anything because I'm still in the wilderness I have just enough in the wilderness that's where I am I don't I'm not in the land of abundance just enough and I said we'll get into it we'll get into it that just enough includes what you give to other people because it is more blessed to give than to receive so go back to that brother and tell him that even in the wilderness go read all through the Old Testament years in the wilderness years how you turn out to treat the stranger and all that and things like that right so it's not just enough like I me and myself for me my son and my daughter and I mean me and my wife my children my grandchildren no no is not that for them what you eat will get you all of that but what you give also nobody say so did you hear said like that you got to give not that the Bible has an answer for that you lazy go to the ants you Slugger go to the an and go work if any man will not work let him not eat amen the Bible is too balanced too balanced to balance so relax nobody's going to take advantage of anybody nobody's going to take advantage of you nobody amen all right so like God Adam's work but is potential his talents and um his greatness his attributes and his greatness because God himself that's what brought out his attributes work and every attribute Son of God of which Adam was the first Express attribut son work is to bring out the potential their greatness is locked up inside of them but work needs to bring it out is not prophesying that brings it out is not whatever that brings it out work so you understand therefore for Genesis 1 12628 and I'll read it and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth that's the potential Dominion then verse 27 he said so God created man his own image in the image of God created in male and female qu he them verse 28 and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful just like Deuteronomy 8 give them the grand uh Grand picture JY 28 he broke it down for them 8 that milk and hone is in the Landy 28 he broke down for them what constitutes the milk and honey the same way here Genesis 28 is breaking down for them what constitutes this Dominion you have the PO verse 26 you have the potential as a man woman born girl in the image of God to do be dominant over everything on the face of the Earth but this is going to come about verse 28 and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it when you do all four then you'll have dominion Dominion is a result of doing all four you don't going to say I'm going to have dominion I'm going to have dominion no that's not how it comes how Dominion comes that you are fruitful multiply subdue I mean replenish subdue when you put it all together is it called Dominion can you say amen amen in other words this is how you P the Dominion potential you have this is how it comes out start being fruitful multiplying replenishing subduing I can show you the strategies of the biggest corporations in the world the most successful corporations through human history from the there from the words of Jesus Jesus deployed the same thing when he told them go into all the worldall and preach the gospel beginning at Jerusalem into Samaria to Judea onto the uttermost parts of the earth begin at Jerusalem fruitful into Judea multiply into Sam into Samaria replenish to the uttermost parts of the Earth subd Dom you in do you dominate the whole place Hallelujah same thing same principle orans are very spiritual very spiritual and we get cheated in many in so many ways you use I'll show you that in your home in your relationship with your little child your little baby so we don't need to live so disempowered and think unless I have this connection nothing's going to happen for me there's nothing like that it's not true I'll show you how I told you before but I'll show you again how to get the connection you need which connection did Ruth have how but Ruth follow these principles and and how to gain favor with both God and man hallah so Genesis 126 was the potential and that's your spiritual SE come from God your potential to dominate to for greatness for success to manifest a son in God's image dominion over all the Earth that's potential that's your talent that's your your gift that's your spiritual SE from God is also your talent your gift in the spiritual as well as the natural because the Bible says but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Ephesians 4:7 every one of us is G every single one is given Grace according to the gift of Christ that's why when the parable Jesus said he called his Serv together and gave each one of them gifts as they had talent I mean according to their several ability he said he gave one five times one two and 1 one but he gave all of his servants and told them go and invested and until I come back do you know that Jesus spoke more about Investments about money that he talk about prayer Jesus had 38 Parables I think 38 Parables 16 of them were about money 16 of 38 about money you know investing and all of that in the Bible so Genesis 1:26 everybody you consider yourself a child of God you are there even if you're not a child of God he made man in his own image male and female created e everybody in of spiritual they might not have spiritualy but they have natural potential every man every man but as a child of God you have an additional thing the seed of God is there the potential to be a Christian to be a child of God and is that potential that's walking up when you come and receive Christ and that seed is walking up and you become a Christian and that it is thir for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what wakes up your sin and your potential you see like you somebody who was like in church when they're talking in church they disinterested that he gets woking up you see them they're all over the place they're on fire so when I see these young folks they you know with their attitude and some of the things and some of these kids raised up in church and see the nastiness of the attitude I don't bother myself with them I just pray that God God send the fire to to to burn up the seed and the soul to to wake that seed up when that seed wakes up nobody's going to be able to stop you here nobody can stop you here your father your mother nobody can stop you amen amen [Applause] and then Genesis 128 I said is years but let me just say it again Genesis 12 128 was the expression the expression of the Dominion by fruitful multiply replenish sub deal in other words between Genesis 126 potential and Genesis 1 128 achievement between those two was work because in Adam was locked up potential characteristics H H uh qualities gifts talents and he's trying to go to Genesis 128 to be fruitful being Dominion walk is the Avenue the vehicle that will take him there amen God had potential locked up in him characteristics attributes and he couldn't come out until God began to do the work of creation he was God but he could never be called a cre God until he created angels work predating even the Earth here work that's all God is about in heaven those H H uh 4 and2 Elders what do they do they're walking Night and Day rush shiping God night and day night and day that's why people consider coming to church is a waste of their time they're going to work and they you see their scale of priorities work is above the things of God because the their job is work but this here is like a not not a hobby you take some of some of them take plain chairs more serious than that what they call now like a extracurricular activity that doesn't fetch you anything that's how the view work this is work the the the the richest man that ever lived Solomon the smartest the wisest man that ever lived Solomon they they they they adjusted for today's inflation and all that they said was like worth about a trillion dollars nobody knows that but everybody agrees he was the wealthiest man that ever lived it said in ecclesiast 62 let us listen to the conclusion of the whole matter serve God when you see somebody is serving you they're having a party with you no they are working for you serve God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole Duty work of man so we are here working can you say Amen so when you do that like that when you do that like like that like that who are you you if you're not working for god well you got somebody El you're working for that's right it's either one or the other there's no neutral anything here you either working for God Jesus said if they are not against me they must be for me which was why when the people were not in their Camp preaching Jesus and they let's stop them you just said no they don't have to be in our camp if they're not against me they must be for me somehow let them alone they're working for God because either working for God or working for the enemy but you want to work for the Enemy No I must walk while there is day Jesus said for the night cometh when no man can walk when you are here in church walk let your voice be heard shout sing dance Rejoice let the devil know who side you are on let the devil know I'm here in church let the devil know that Hallelujah Lord your servant reporting for Duty why do we call it a service you may be see [Applause] amen that's why we call it a church service you are coming here to serve that's all serve well serve well and live amen serve well and live if your neighbor doesn't want Lord I want to know I'm here serving you for that's the whole duty of man that's why you put me here to serve you to be in service for you amen you may be seated but you know human nature that we are on your job people know how to loaf around when they know the boss is coming wow you may be seated when you know the boss is coming they are busy the busy have you done this have you done that they're all over the place they want know the boss is coming oh all that you might fool that boss like that but you cannot fool this boss because his eyes see through everything he knows who's working who's not working he knows who is taking the duty serious to serve God and keep his Commandments he knows it it doesn't depend on the pastor don't nobody he knows it so serve well and leave say Amen [Applause] somebody all right so excuse me so I said between the potential and the expression Genesis 12 128 is work without work like I said last week potential is just that potential Talent that's all very talented have you seen many people who had talent and they man to nothing I'm sure many people like that Talent some of the if you have an IQ right now I mean right IQ 150 I mean IQ int intelligence quotient of 150 you are operating at genius level 125 is giving a very very rarified you know company 150 but I I'll I'll give you details about people who have 150 IQ and just ordinary people Ordinary People ordinary it's orinary as smart as they have as smart as they are Talent great talent does Nigeria have potential doesn't Nigeria have potential no you Nigerians talk that's the problem with Nigerians no Nigerian Nigerian they take last I'm asking you doesn't Nigeria have potential has that potential come to be why between the potential and achievement work we like shortcuts 419 all you bet Nigeria boys maybe there are some girls so that's the problem in Nigeria just spend spend spend know how to create but you are creators we are breaking off that Spirit we are creators we are breaking off that [Applause] spirit so want to make in all of these years that to show you like that work has always been an integral part of the purpose and plan of God both for himself and for his creation mankind so because it originate from go from God work can be said to be more spiritual in nature than natural and we human beings may be temp to think what is natural like I've been saying but work is spiritual as you see for what we're talking about work is Godly to work is to be Godlike like your father in Heaven that's why the Bible has so strong words for he who will not walk let him not eat he will not walk and provide for his family is worse than Infidel if you are Gods you want to be like your father you work amen oh brother are you enjoying this m be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect work takes you to that route work on your knees in prayer getting the Holy Ghost work amen coming to church serving him and going in the marketplace going in the marketplace on your job and doing the same thing excelling there like your father in Heaven work so walk if it's spiritual like I'm talking about if it comes from God and God gives you the work to be able to bring out what's in you work therefore can be said to be a Ministry of shorts Ministry of ss why Ministry because work is a calling that you are responsible to God for why a Ministry because work is an undertaking where you serve God so his purpose for the different stages of your life can come forth can be expressed and be made manifest displayed before the world it's you and God Alone he gave you that work to express it what he put on the inside of you from the Cradle to the Grave work is a Ministry of no wonder the Bible says Ephesians 4:12 I believe it speaks on the work of of the ministry amen or you think just the pastor and evangelist no work of the ministry everybody your ministry have you the song leader is he a Min is he a minister no you said in Ministry in Songs the corus is he a minister no listen choruses Ministry prayer leader Ministry amen doesn't make him a minister there's a fful Ministry but there's also you know other Ministry offices amen amen can you say amen amen you're looking stunned what's wrong with them they're looking stunned they have no idea all right so what is a Ministry a Ministry simply sign simp signifies a service don't look at Nigerian because the Min people are sh to be ministers in Niger so they can eat they can go there and chop money but a Min a minister serves a Ministry serves that's it is from the Bible the Bible whatever you call it Minister commissioner whatever they're supposed to serve so what a Ministry signify service to God and to man so with this understanding that work is a is is Ministry it becomes easy to appreciate that Every Man Has a calling a call of God every man woman boy and girl has a calling a call of God upon your life a Ministry not fful Minister but a Ministry a calling from God that God want to serve him in so that what is put on the inside of you can come out you have a Ministry in the work that God has called you to do and like I said already the parable of italent shows that gave them each one of them you know talents according to their several ability to go and profit with it you know what the Bible says First Corinthians 1 Corinthians 12 I think it is he said unto every one of us given Grace of the gift of chist that we might profit without Jesus gave them gifts and told them to go and profit with it amen same thing don't sleep now too early to sleep you got to hear this devil is trying to cheat you if you don't hear this got you you got to wake up wake up put a put a what do you call it toothpick right you know so you got some put a toothpick between your eyeb your eyelids so you can stay awake so with this understand that work is Ministry we're getting somewhere this understanding not only highlights the importance of work also brings on a total paradigm shift in the way that you view work and when you understand that it totally totally affects the the dedication and the seriousness with which we should carry out our work whatever work we do work of a mother father boss you know preacher you know cleaner whatever Romans 12 puts together this understanding Romans 12:11 says not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord so when you're doing your business you are in service to the Lord so when you go to your work on Monday morning you are in service when you come to church on Sunday morning you are in service not slothful in business fing in spirit serving the lord and that's why work should be done with all feny and devotion as unto the Lord fing in your work because you recognize that it's a service to the Lord am and because you are in service to the Lord you are serving the lord as you work it makes it clear that Jesus is your true boss is your true boss because it lets you recognize that it's him that placed the talents in you the attributes the characteristics that will only be expressed through the Avenue of that work that you call your job I hate that job Jesus put you there and he's your boss I can't stand my boss what you can't stand Jesus not slothful in business fing in spirit serving your boss serving the lord and Jesus is your boss w so there in lies the real purpose of work to bring out um build up the jewel that's in you the gem the goal the character the manifestation of God's purpose at that particular period of time in your life amen so when you are you are like going to school you at work that's why I teach a early to serve the Lord so that when they're in school they're serving the lord not slothful in school hanging out with the boys and girls and doing all kinds of stupid things because until they get to church before they're in service but they recognize even when they in their classroom learning 1 + 1 equals 2 they're serving the lord they're in service to the Lord the Headmaster is not their boss Jesus is the boss even if the head Master says do some things they know Jesus doesn't want they say no my boss wouldn't want me to do this I cannot do it can you say amen amen amen I'm unemployed it's not true it's not true anyway so your 40 Hour Work Week your 40 hour work week is church after all church we are going to church 40 hours every week because and that job you are serving the lord you come to church you're serving the lord the great wisdom of God to have you at his own all the time so he can he can cool over you he can be with you every time you won't leave him here on Sunday until the next Sunday no every single time you are with him in the on Monday morning you with him on Monday evening you with him on Monday when you go home and you are a husband you are doing work still oh molding you shaping you oh the wisdom of almighty God hallelujah H hallelujah oh brother amen so your 40h hour work week is church amen you are leaving it in the presence of Jesus which a with a Consciousness that is you and him on the job you and him on the job because it's your ever present boss he's there all the time you don't wait for the boss to come and you are doing eye service there's an eye watching you all the time and you are serving him fervently every single second every single minute no when Dad is watching mom is watching you serving him every single time because you have one Lord one boss the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that promotes you not that boss because promotion comes from nowhere but from above oh brother I feel [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory amen you may be seated so because your is your is your everpresent boss he's your supervisor he's the one who looks in and sees to it that you actually are doing the work that you are called and paid to do even he doesn't carry a pay the work you are called to do he's the one that looks in supervises he checking it up amen and that's what like he did with Adam Genesis 2:19 and out of the ground the Lord got formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them onto Adam to work to see what he would call them I don't have to do some mind work some brain work God brought you him to see what he will call them give him the work and God standing there trying to see that the work is getting done the everpresent supervisor who is checking you out Eric you really must have had a tough night right about a really tough night wake up will Adam do this work all these animals here see all of these animals here all of them name them and classify them well dress it and keep it you know that word dressing you know when you trying to make a dress what are you doing that's creative that's creative Powers dress this Garden keep it we'll get into that so God told Adam these animals s them out and and give them a name and all that things like that and you just do it and take off he's there supervision what they're doing is not a busy like I said many times do this he gave him a chance because if you're going to He Man accountable got to give him a chance to express him and do the work the way he feels his best to do or you can't if if he's doing just at do this do this and you can't blame him for the results so if a man is going to be held accountable then go to give him responsibility you got to let him be so God let Adam be but gave him the work but God was a supervisor supervising all of these things I tell you all time this is the only book you need on this Earth here the Bible the Bible is the only book you need need no other book okay you shouldn't go to school I'm not saying that I'm I'm baiting you I'm baiting you I just know he's going somewhere I just hear what he's saying he's trying to say something he's trying something I'm not saying anything what I'm saying is that every truth comes from this Bible because God wrote the Bible I mean gave us the word to know how we should live on the face of this Earth here and man has dug into it and brought out principles of Life principles principles and I'll show you some today my time is already gone so I don't I don't know I don't want to worry you because some of these men are making faces at me like that and it's not a good sign when men are making faces at you like that it's not a good sign but the girls hardly sleep like that really a boys visual in this church is a boys so and brought them onto Adam to see what he will call them and what whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was a name thereof he told Adam name them and I named them and God looked into his name them that's that's okay that's okay that's okay Adam just like God took Moses onto the mountain and showed him how the the Tabernacle every going to be all the laws all the drapes all the things the Tabernacle the UR thring and God told Moses that is your job to make sure that the things are done among the people like I have shown you on top of the mountain the real boss it seemed to it that the job is done not like your boss that you can fool in the natural and see why we are the way we are in Africa all those work ethics wouldn't work in the Kingdom you're getting nothing for it the Nigerian thing you like you know cut corners and all that stuff it w work in the Kingdom no it will not work you know you have a boss that's constantly seeing you whether your boss like why you carrying this work on your head as if your own work alone do the work you are a child of abundance you do the work and more go go go look at Ruth that's how you attract favor amen [Applause] you got to forgive me I got to take a bit of time uh you got to forgive me I sat at 12 or 2 minutes after 12 I sang and greeted you and all that stuff and you took my greetings too so you should have said come on Pastor start right away don't all these greeting we've seen you already all right but I greeted you you took all the greetings so you and I used the first 20 minutes together okay so I started using my time at 12:00 so I know no I'm not firing on yet no no I won't take that advice who said that fire on I won I won take advice no no I won't I won't take that if I fire all these guys here they run away know I won't fire them I want them to stay so all right but I try to run I won't ion I won't hold it too long I I'll try but I just wanted to get this this is a total parship for for you for me for you PR I'm so the the realization that work is Ministry turns your in between Sundays into one continuous week long fellowship with the greatest sweetest most understanding most compassionate most caring most loving boss ever the Lord Jesus J Christ oh what a boss to walk for he walks with me and talks with me a long lives narrow way oh what a b what a br to work with oh my the carpenter of Bethlehem right that's my boss I know the you know that's they right there he walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way my the election if your candidate won or candidate lost it matters not if your cand W and you are looking up to your cand to make the economy all around you are in a recession already your candidate lost and you are feeling like that the wall has come to an end you're in recession already but look to him they look to him and the Bible says and their faces were not ashamed look and leave my brother leave look to Jesus Christ and live amen all is that me that I've been looking at you stand up your feet bless you when you come to town Friday really good to see you that's shalom's Shalom sister bless you we see you i' been I've been looking at you so you are hiding there from me so I saw you anyway I called you out God bless you good to see you this are my some of my girls from out of Lagos God bless you all right so all week long in between Sundays like brother as preached you know um for us years ago you in church just you and Jesus all week long on the on the job you are in church with Jesus all week long with this realization you recognize that time spent at work is not time spent away from church or from spiritual matters and work may be school for you work whatsoever thy hand fed to do if you if you if you if you're a sportsman that's work it didn't say whatever your leg whatever is is a your hand means like the activity you are involved in you might not be walking with your hand per se say like that you might be walking with your brains might be walking with your legs whatever or is a work of your hands whatsoever th hand fin to do do it with all thy [Applause] might so you recognize all week long is a chance when you lift your today you'll continue in service still with the Lord Jesus Christ you view work time not as time to be wasted rather it's time that God has given you to work towards building your character because character is on the inside of you he wants to come out walk wants to bring it out so you see work when you get to work and that boss is so nasty you feel cheated on your job there's gospel around you what you supposed to do let it bring us something let it bring us some virtues let bring some godliness in you some power some virtue on the inside of you so that work actually is building you character that work actually is giving you building value on the inside of you oh God help me oh brother I'm taking too much time explaining this new over and over but I just want I just want make sure you'll get it amen so you Vi work time not as time to be wasted but time that you have given to God I mean God that time that God has given you to work out your salvation with fear and trembling to work towards building your character growing your potential growing your value all the while working amen toward your life purpose both in life and godliness the potential that God placed in you before the foundation of the world this understand that work is Ministry gives work a whole other meaning a whole brand new meaning this understand lets you understand know that whatever work it is that you do it is the Lord himself who has described the outcomes the deliverables that your work should produce simply what the outcome what's on the inside he wants you to come out that's the outcome he's looking for he's not looking for your paycheck whatever that's not what he's talking about so the biggest thing you take home from your workplace is not your is not the size of your pay packet that's that's important but that's secondary your pay packet will not increase if you don't understand this I'm telling you so the B the biggest thing the main thing you take from work home from work is the person you are becoming it's the character that is coming out of you that's the that's the greatest thing you take home from your workplace from school that's what you take home from school not take over some more nastiness because you got it from the other f is that what God plac you nastiness or some adultery some fornication because you see the boys doing that or the men see their their guys on the job to timing their wives and getting away with it is that what it putting you is that what you pick up from work God is your BOS when they want to employ you on a job they let you know this is the job you're are doing these are they call it job descriptions but better still because I say like make 10 phone calls I say I even made 20 no you need to put there the outcomes that we're expecting to get from you the deliverables you to get from you so out of those 10 calls you must have a client who will book an appointment from those 10 calls so until you have that one client you can do all the 10 and 20 it doesn't matter is the outcomes the deliverables we're talking about so it's not just effort labor effort labor is the results amen can you say Amen can you say I'll show you from the Bible I'll show you from the Bible amen not from your business school from the business school of above not a and Y have a clue about this they get it and make it make money on Wall Street but this here for Eternal values you can't even compare them no you can't compare them you don't have to believe it but you can compare them Oh Glory so this understand knows that whatever work it is you doing is Jesus himself who has described the job description the outcomes and the deliverables that your work should produce that's why promotion comes from nowhere but from above because the one the one real true boss who has said the real deliverables and outcomes that your work should deliver and based upon the outcomes that you deliver it will grow you in other words he will promote you both in stature and in favor with both God and man in life and godliness and the child grew because he was there he was there in the Caper shed he was there in the temple he was there 12 years old he grew in stature and wisdom stature both God and man is it care saying that God's saying that God's marking his records I close too many people closing their eyes CU let me tell these young men they they're sleeping you because my you you [Laughter] know [Applause] amen all right Ephesians 6: 65 to9 can if you can project that for me please Ephesians 6: 5-9 let's see who the boss is and see like that the one who we serve is a Bross we don't serve him in church and then we serve him somebody else at work no we serve him all the time 24/7 like you guys say we Ser him all the time we at work all the time we in fulltime service amen people have a problem because they feel that they can be Christians here and then they can be that's why young people have a problem when they in church they are Christians and they're trying to present and and impress people but when they get away from church it's another game all together but when you know that there's an eye watching you your boss is checking you out whether you are delivering that job is only to help you to bring it out and when you get home too is the same thing to help you to bring it out the deliverables the outcomes is looking for that's the boss who checks you out he's the one who checks your performance sheet not some boss amen Ephesians 6 ver5 servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh it doesn't mean you are a servant where you walk with fear and trembling not because of the man but because of the Lord in seeing goodness of your heart eyes unto Christ not with ey service like I just say not with ey Service as men Pleasers that's politics in the workplace politics but as the Servants of Christ on your job doing the will of God from the heart I'm telling about how to walk with your hands the qu you bring to bear in the place the qu that gets you results like heaven gives you the qu that gives you abundant results that brings the milk and horny out amen not with our service as men pleas but servant of Christ doing the will of God from the heart because that's where it's hidden he wants to come out from there with Good Will doing service it keeps saying over now doing your service is he calling your job your job he's calling his service you Ministry you in service with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to men your boss the best employees in anywhere should be believers they should be the most outstanding and voice is anywhere verse 8 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord that's your real pay your real salary receive of the Lord whether he be born or free whether he be in slavery the money is not enough or he's in the wilderness free man but he just has enough whether that don't say this useless job how much are they paying me whether he be borned or free burned in slavery that means the money you get is not enough free you are in the wilderness is just enough useless work why what pay me here they pay me this and they me to to serve them your boss your boss your boss but Victory got to walk around the beach whether he be born or free and ye Masters the bosses also believers do the same things unto them do the same way you do your own work also forbearing threatening don't give s Le if not for me will you get a job no it's not true no it's not true God gave them that job you are just a vessel whether they be your house help or your driver it matters not can you say Amen whether it be your Gat man your cleaner at the door it matters not amen for bearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven you also you are in service you employ people but you also are employed by the Lord and he's expecting you also to let these qualities come out of you them seven spirits of God faith and virtue knowledge Temperance the character of the Holy Ghost so come out of you can you say amen amen amen Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever you do in word or dided do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him all of these scriptures are just emphasizing the truth that the Lord Jesus Christ is your real true boss amen can you say amen amen because is his kingdom we're talking about kingdom here the kingdom of God and God is the boss in this Kingdom he's your employer he's the one who pays you he the one who promotes you oh Hallelujah if you want to change your circumstances this how you got to think look nothing feel like that this useless job while he still keeps you there he's your boss can you say amen that's Kingdom thinking amen man oh Hallelujah those guys in the wilderness they're free men free men but they thought Moses that Moses this that is it because there's no food here I mean no graes in Egypt you took us here and all that stuff because they saw Moses and Moses it's not you that talking to it's me that's what he's talking about God was the boss go God God God is the boss there's his kingdom the kingdom of God and you are working for him you are working under his supervision you are walking Guided by the principles and the spirit of his kingdom the kingdom of God whoever your Earthly B on that job is whoever your colleagues are you are living on that job in a world alone with Jesus and you are dedicated you are committed to deliver on the outcomes that he your real true boss wants from you the potential is locked up in to come out amen whether you like your job or not you are working for Jesus and even though it's not your dream job my dream job my dream career oh God let me get get me from this P house let me get me from here this useless job whether it be your dream job or is your dream job is in the future will that be a temporary job the Lord Jesus is still your boss on that job that useless job that pay you penis like you are a b a man in bondage like a man in the wilderness not enough so that nobody tear troubles me to help them with anything is your real true boss and that's why the Bible says you give that job given all diligence to make your calling and election sure I know whether scripture second Peter 1 that's why it is there make your coin election show way talking about the virtues of Christ coming out of you amen and this knowledge this understanding this realization this wisdom that Jesus is your boss is what dictates your work ethic right is what dictates your diligence is what dictates the Integrity you bring to bed on your job is what dictates the Hest transparency it's what dictates the intensity and the relentlessness the spirit that you bring to whatever your work is because Jesus Christ is your real true boss that's the work ethic in the kingdom of God Amen simply because you have the knowledge and understanding that the Lord Jesus is your real true boss on that job is the one that's doing your performance review your performance report your accountability assessment your evaluation is the one doing it you can scam your B on the earth they give you all these natural things and all that stuff brought in the Bank of Heaven what Treasures are there he sees you as a scam so whatever your work in whatever economy or whatever Nation on the face of this that you live in these realizations are the first steps in living in God's economy anything less you're operating and living in the economy of man economy of nation where you live in Nigeria that's why I said if you're candidate one and you are still

disempowered and operate in that economy no you don't have to I'll show you from the Bible not today B whatever whatever it is that your work is when you approach and walk when you approach that work with these realizations and lifestyle you are given Heaven a chance to invade your space to invade your work space with the presence of God and his favor there just a presence around you because you go to walk with Jesus you at work Jesus is at work you at work you are thinking about God remembering the Lord when you come there there's there's a presence around you that favor goes with you when you go when you walking this way in said of Joseph when he was in ptif when he was in ptif house God blessed everything in ptif house because of him because Joseph carried God into that house with him

masterpiece from the Lord and we pray that God will bless his servant brother Olu in a mighty way we do have one prayer request for Zaden ha 3 years old with body pains fever headache and trouble to breathe from brother Mike Blackman and I know they are many different situations at this time and we see it all around different viruses and different things so there are those who are not even here today because they are ill so we want to remember them in prayer also and if you have a request this morning that you want to show by raising your hand as we approach the throne of God this morning see those hands let us bow our heads for word of prayer oh gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for Lord the words of eternal life that we heard this morning Lord and Lord such a beautiful Lord timely message Lord to remind us of the purpose of work father and Lord Brother Olu so beautifully brought her that before the fall man was put there to work father the responsibility was there father and Lord God to understand that it's a work of the ministry it's the work of our hands that prayer is work sacrifice is work praise is work it's all an expression of Lord our worship to you and father the fact that Lord by living this way we are constantly reminded Lord that you are the one we report to you are the one we live for you are the one we serve father and that Lord you would bless the very work of our hands Lord and father your Prophet taught us that we got to do something for something to happen all of that is a form of work there's an activity that's required there's a effort that is required for even for you to operate and for you to act and you taught us through your word that if we should ask anything Lord that Lord you would do it so it requires the work of asking for you to even come back and bring the response so Lord we come this morning to work Lord and we come to bring these requests to you Lord as a form of work and we come to ask Lord because you promised that you would answer our prayer you promise that you will meet our needs Lord you promise that Lord if we knock if we seek they said knock and the door will be open it requires the work of knocking for the door to be open if we're not willing to knock Lord you promise to not just open the door but he said if we knock you'll answer Lord even you said I'm standing at the door and I'm knocking so Lord the work that began in the day of creation is still happening now because you're standing on the doors of our hearts knocking this morning Lord you're still working to bring us to a realization of who we are and whose we are so father we thank you Lord for the revelation that's unfolding to us that we could stand plainly and see you have a work to do and we also have a work to do and we are working together Lord to bring a manifestation of the sons of God where born Sons filled Sons can take their position oh God and we bring Lord Zan ha before you three years old with fever body pains

asked me to make a plea to you to encourage you if you could make it out to the live physical service here please do so if you could make it out make it out and if you cannot make it out make sure that you are connected to the service we are on duty all the time we heard of this we are in service all the time but if you can make it here make the effort it's a little little push but make the effort and if you can be here then make it part of your duty and your responsibility to be part of the service this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. this coming Friday it's our Zoom prayer meeting and I want to also encourage you in particular the parents encourage your young children to be a part of the service also it's a discipline and they have to learn and understand that discipline so this coming Friday at 8:00 p.m. our Zoom prayer meeting and Lord willing this coming Sunday back here in the house of the Lord for our Sunday morning service maintainance team group five please meet with brother Michael Blackburn after the service and next week group four is schedule to serve the work doesn't stop the work continues and we want to salute all of these groups you appreciate the maintainance groups that work every they work every Sunday amen also we want to remind the church that on Saturday the 27th of January will be our first youth service for this year all are welcome we want you to make an extra effort to support it make sure that those that may not be here they are aware of it it's it's not optional we want it to be mandatory all right so we have young people who are in trouble young people who are struggling and as I was saying with to someone yesterday what do young people have to deal with at age 8 and at age seven and at age six is very different from what we had to deal with when we were 12 and 13 and 15 and these things you know just a couple days ago my daughter came home and said one of the kids in school has two mommies and I as a fouryear old know that's what they Comm I'm saying trying to understand how is that possible at 4 years old that's the world we live in so let's not take it for granted it's a serious hour we're living in so we encourage you to support our youth focused service let's call it a youth focused service so we could have a conversation with young people but all are welcome as we put our shoulders together in this great move and this effort to see God do something tremendous for the young people because he promised to do it but we have to put the work in it's not going to happen without the work without the effort without the sacrifice in addition to that Carnival Monday we want to put you on notice early as well that we're going to have a special family day here at the church from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. there will be a number of activities planned um I can't guarantee it but I might be cooking barbecue we'll see but you know don't don't hold me to it but may be possible but we have a lot of activities planned and we want the church to come out and have a time of Fellowship in a environment in an atmosphere of Believers have different things that will happen different activities and and fellowships and uh we'll get more certainly some more details um on that as we get closer to that day um in addition uh we are just about 6 months just about 6 months away from our annual convention time is moving so fast and before you know it it's it's right there you know so uh convention will be in July of this year so we just about 6 months away and we want to begin to make preparations for that both in the natural and in the spiritual and in light of that as well the hospitality team um is reactivated as of today so there'll be uh Refreshments available to support financially for the convention fund so we encourage you to support that as well but in addition to that we want to encourage all of the church to make a pledge and a commitment towards supporting the convent convention and if we look at it this way we are in January so we have about 6 months to go January February March April May June and then the convention in July so pray about it see what the Lord puts on your heart to contribute towards the convention and if you can make a commitment monthly over the next 6 months to the convention and communicate this commitment to us so that we could understand what's possible uh we do have certain plans to do certain repairs to the Tabernacle and all of it is work and it takes resources to be able to prepare and of course to handle many of the convention related expenses as well so we want to be a part of this great effort and we are soliciting uh your support you look in your heart and may the Lord minister to you and we'll be having more conversations around this but we want to at least post you to what's coming ahead as well in addition more details will come but last year we had a number of uh our local ministers coming coming in to minister during the course of the year to us so we are looking for God to do some more of that and to allow some more of that and uh more details will come but as early as next month we are looking to have a local Minister here to speak to the church so we want to be on the expectation we got to do something for something to happen so we want to keep the pressure on keep the momentum on keep our swords drawn and keeping moving as the Bible said every place that the soul of your foot tread upon that is yours so we want to keep making Footprints and we know Footprints mean possession so may the Lord richly bless you once again very quickly service on Wednesday this coming Friday uh Sunday service Wednesday here live at the Tabernacle Friday our Zoom prayer meeting this coming Sunday uh back here at the church if you didn't see
