[19:57] her lord help me and jesus response was
[20:00] it's not fit to take the children's
[20:02] bread and cast it to dogs
[20:04] now if that woman didn't have a real
[20:05] substance didn't have something real
[20:07] she'd take off after that and make a
[20:09] whole big rap tell the neighbors get
[20:11] newspapers twitter it tweet it whatever
[20:13] it is put it on facebook she name it she
[20:16] doesn't have a lot of problems but a

[20:21] praise god say it they said i'm not
[20:23] moving see i'm not tell somebody i'm not
[20:25] moving tell them i'm not moving oh
[20:27] praise god she stood her ground so
[20:28] grunge was the word she knew that that
[20:31] man standing there was the right man she
[20:33] knew he had the power to do what she
[20:35] wanted done she know her daughter was
[20:37] vexed with the devil her daughter didn't
[20:38] have a toothache the dentist could see
[20:40] about that the doctor didn't have a
[20:41] headache panadol and caffeine or
[20:43] whatever that could take care of that
[20:45] but this daughter was vexed with the
[20:46] devil that's spirit business that that
[20:48] means more than than some medical
[20:50] disease
[20:52] that needs something more you see when
[20:54] the devils have the right it needs power
[20:56] it needs virtue it needs something more
[20:58] than you prepare to deal with
[21:00] praise god and when that comes on the
[21:02] scene you may as well have the right
[21:04] attitude because the bright attitude
[21:06] will produce the right result

[26:55] you never thought was possible oh glory
[26:58] to god you know what i'm believing for
[26:59] this morning a dynamic holy ghost
[27:02] revival i'm believing this morning for
[27:05] god to take the minister into such an
[27:07] atmosphere like you have never been in
[27:09] there before i may be leaving for the
[27:11] glory of god to fill this church
[27:14] that the minister won't be able to
[27:16] minister because of the glory
[27:18] of god
[27:27] he said the attitude is what brings the
[27:28] results
[27:30] see after me the attitude
[27:32] is what brings the results
[27:34] say it again the attitude
[27:36] is what brings the results
[27:39] oh hallelujah
[27:41] people touching jesus and getting
[27:43] nothing

[28:53] they want to see jesus
[28:55] with the garment on waiting for you to
[28:57] touch
[28:58] there's nobody else around
[29:00] that's what you dreamed last night
[29:02] that's what you're praying for
[29:04] but when you come just you and jesus
[29:06] alone
[29:07] i'll be standing on the platform
[29:09] there'll be nobody around you just walk
[29:10] up and touch and you'll be healed
[29:12] no that's good but that dream wasn't
[29:14] right

[29:18] not all dreams are right
[29:19] when she came to this jesus you're
[29:21] looking for was a crowd around him

[29:24] choice boy pressure boy traffic jam
[29:28] too much of people on the road too much
[29:30] of people around him i'm going back home
[29:32] no
[29:33] she came for purpose
[29:35] that was in her heart
[29:37] nobody was going to stop her from there
[29:39] she told herself
[29:41] not her husband told her not she had a
[29:44] personal revelation inspiration and fate
[29:47] that she was going to be healed
[29:50] and these guys who just watching
[29:52] wondering and just looking they have
[29:55] nothing to do with what was in her heart
[29:58] so she said excuse me the first man gave
[30:00] her a room make another one already and
[30:01] excuse me with that the second monster
[30:03] where i look into but that wasn't
[30:04] stopping her she pushed she crawled
[30:06] under the legs she was pushing because
[30:09] she had to get you can't say if i could
[30:11] touch and you're like it's a kind of
[30:12] virtual touch you know i mean you know
[30:14] this is not this this nothing's gonna
[30:15] touch you know you have to literally
[30:16] touch there's not no of a um computer
[30:20] touch thing you know this is you have to
[30:21] get there and when you have to get
[30:23] somewhere you begin to journey so she
[30:25] began to push and press god set it up
[30:28] that way god love it that way he wants
[30:30] you to go against the tide he wants you
[30:31] to believe something and have the power
[30:34] to move past your circumstance and move
[30:36] past your situation and move past your
[30:38] your family and move past your natural
[30:41] environment you pass all your heard and

[30:55] [Music]
[30:57] disciples about everybody touching you
[30:59] he said no no no no this one touch was
[31:01] different i felt a power left me that's
[31:04] the ministry of jesus christ that is
[31:05] what these ministers don't have that is
[31:08] what this promise they have to have a
[31:10] power moving out a power oozing out a
[31:13] power leaking out a power getting out
[31:16] that's the power of christ in the church
[31:19] could somebody give a big shout on that
[31:20] one

[37:31] i certainly appreciate the worship
[37:33] service this morning brother gideon may
[37:35] the lord bless you
[37:36] amen amen tremendous
[37:40] so reading revelation chapter 22
[37:43] and reading from verse 10.
[37:47] when the bible says and he saith unto me
[37:50] seal not the sayings
[37:52] of the prophecy of this book
[37:55] for the time is at hand
[37:58] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[38:01] still
[38:02] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[38:05] still
[38:06] and he that is righteous
[38:08] let him be righteous still
[38:10] and he that is holy
[38:12] let him be holy still
[38:14] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[38:17] is with me to give every man
[38:20] according as his work
[38:22] shall be
[38:24] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[38:26] the end the first and the last
[38:29] blessed are they that do his
[38:30] commandments that they may have right to
[38:33] the tree of life and may enter into the
[38:36] gates into the city
[38:38] for without or outside are dogs and
[38:41] sorcerers and hormones and murderers and
[38:44] idolaters and whosoever loveth and make
[38:47] it a lie
[38:48] i jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[38:52] unto you these things in the churches
[38:55] i am the root and the offspring of david
[38:58] and the bright and morning star
[39:00] and the spirit and the bride say come
[39:02] and let him that herot say come and let
[39:05] him that is a thirst come and whosoever
[39:07] will let him take the water of life
[39:09] freely
[39:10] for i testify unto every man
[39:15] that heared the words of the prophecy of
[39:17] this book
[39:19] if any man shall add unto these things
[39:23] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[39:26] are written in this book and if any man
[39:29] shall take away from the words of the
[39:32] prophecy of this
[39:34] from the words of the book of this
[39:35] prophecy god shall take away his part
[39:38] out of the book of life
[39:40] and out of the holy city and from the
[39:42] things which are written in this book he
[39:45] which testifieth these things say it
[39:47] surely i come quickly amen even so come
[39:51] lord jesus may the lord have a blessing
[39:53] to the reading of his word you may be
[39:55] seated this morning
[40:03] i have a title this morning
[40:06] the identification
[40:09] of the true believers
[40:12] the identification
[40:15] of the true
[40:16] believers
[40:18] and my subject
[40:20] separating the word bride
[40:23] from the church members
[40:25] and my inspiration only the elect
[40:29] have the ability
[40:31] to hear from god
[40:34] and before i get to my text this morning
[40:36] we are here this morning to hear truth
[40:39] we are not here to play games we are not
[40:41] here to just gather we are here to hear
[40:44] the truth
[40:45] because only the truth will set
[40:47] you free
[40:49] the truth makes
[40:51] you free we're not here this morning to
[40:53] entertain we are not here this morning
[40:55] to make you feel nice or to to get you
[40:58] to feel so excited about your future but
[41:00] you are here to hear the whole truth
[41:02] because you need all of the truth to
[41:04] know where
[41:05] you are standing and as we draw nearer
[41:07] to the closing chapters of time and as
[41:09] we get narrow to the convention and we
[41:11] get nearer to judgment you have to know
[41:14] where you stand tonight
[41:16] you must know where you stand this
[41:18] morning and i believe the time has come
[41:20] for the true believers to be identified
[41:23] a lot of people believe that they are
[41:25] true believers
[41:27] and that is the problem
[41:29] a lot of people believe they are true
[41:31] believers and that is not the case
[41:33] because brother branham taught us in
[41:35] every church there are three kinds of
[41:37] believers
[41:39] and brother branham and preaching three
[41:40] kinds of believers he said he preached a
[41:42] message so that people can assess
[41:44] themselves to see where they stand
[41:47] [Music]
[41:49] i'm not here to assess you but you have
[41:51] to assess yourself by the word to see
[41:53] where you stand
[41:55] because only the true believer is going
[41:56] to make it
[41:57] only the true believers are going to go
[41:59] into the rapture only the true believers
[42:01] are going to get the holy ghost
[42:03] can the church say man
[42:06] some time ago when i was preaching the
[42:08] message rapturing condition a brother
[42:10] called me up after the service and said
[42:12] he had a problem with something i said
[42:15] because i made a statement not everybody
[42:17] in here is going to the rapture
[42:20] and he was troubled by it
[42:22] but that's what brother branham taught
[42:24] us
[42:24] i can lie to you and make you feel nice
[42:27] and say if you come to church you're
[42:28] going to go to the rapture the criteria
[42:30] is not coming to church
[42:34] going to the rapture is not based on
[42:35] attendance going to the rapture is not
[42:38] based on whose church you're in go to
[42:40] the rapture is not based on who your
[42:41] pastor is going to the raptor is based
[42:44] on you living the world
[42:47] can the church say man
[42:49] so i want to get down to some brass
[42:51] tacks this morning get down on the
[42:54] inside of the machinery this morning so
[42:56] that when you leave this service you're
[42:58] going to know exactly where you're
[42:59] standing you're going to know the truth
[43:01] and the truth will set you free so that
[43:04] if you're on the edge this morning you
[43:05] won't be on the edge no more i'm putting
[43:08] you on god this morning because the
[43:10] world is coming harder and harder and
[43:12] harder
[43:13] can the church say amen you may be
[43:15] seated i'm laying the background
[43:17] the bible says and brother branham used
[43:19] this scripture when he preached a
[43:21] message three kinds of believers he
[43:23] referred to john chapter 6 and john
[43:26] chapter 6 starts off with jesus looking
[43:28] around him
[43:30] and the people are hungry and he asks if
[43:32] anybody has anything and beloved spoke
[43:34] about it a young boy comes up with five
[43:36] loaves and two fishes that's john 6 and
[43:39] jesus blesses it and he breaks then he
[43:41] feeds the people
[43:43] later in john 6 he starts to say well
[43:45] this food you're eating is i come for a
[43:47] different purpose i am the bread of life
[43:51] and a little lower down jesus comes and
[43:53] begins to drill deeper he says except
[43:56] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[43:59] have no pot
[44:01] you are not part of me
[44:08] john chapter 6 verse 6 he says and many
[44:11] therefore of his disciples
[44:13] when they had heard this said this is a
[44:18] who can hear it
[44:20] and people like to come to church and
[44:22] hear nice sayings but this morning we
[44:24] come to do some hard scenes
[44:27] and not everybody can hear it but it's
[44:29] for a reason because as jesus stood
[44:31] there he stood for a purpose because his
[44:34] church was too big
[44:39] and god wanted to separate the church
[44:42] members
[44:43] from the world bride
[44:46] oh you don't hear me this morning god
[44:48] was starting a separation in his church
[44:51] in jesus church at 82 people
[44:54] and when jesus said these words 70
[44:58] 7-0 walked away
[45:03] but the brandon typed those who walked
[45:05] away as the unbelievers
[45:07] they in the church
[45:08] and he said the unbelievers are those
[45:10] who have problems when the word comes
[45:12] forth they can't accept everything
[45:14] [Music]
[45:17] so when you have a problem accepting the
[45:20] word of god you know where you stand in
[45:22] this morning
[45:23] because the true believer accepts every
[45:25] word and acts on every word even if you
[45:28] don't understand it because the
[45:30] revelation of what jesus was speaking
[45:32] about was not being clear to them yet
[45:34] but the unbelievers say no that's too
[45:36] much for us we're going to walk away
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:41] we're going to drill down and say we're
[45:42] going to get deep friends this morning
[45:44] because you got to know exactly where
[45:46] you're standing if you cannot take the
[45:48] word by definition you are an unbeliever
[45:55] not some of the word but every word
[46:00] 70 walked away and jesus turned to his
[46:03] remaining 12 disciples
[46:06] and asked the question will you go also
[46:10] and brother peter said where can we go
[46:13] because you alone have the words
[46:15] you alone have this message you alone
[46:18] have this gospel you alone have signs
[46:21] and wonders you alone are rightly
[46:23] dividing the scriptures you alone are
[46:25] bringing spiritual food in due season
[46:28] you alone are raising the dead you alone
[46:31] are healing the sick you alone could
[46:33] call my name i thought my name was peter
[46:36] but i recognize i have a different name
[46:40] you don't hear me this morning
[46:43] you may be seated
[46:47] three kinds of believers were standing
[46:49] there on that day
[46:52] the seventy who had a problem when the
[46:55] word came forth
[46:57] the 70 who don't want to obey the word
[47:01] the 70 who want to come to church when
[47:03] they want to come to church
[47:05] the 70 who don't want to read their
[47:07] bible because
[47:08] brother branham brought out the
[47:10] unbelievers at those who were not taking
[47:12] all the word
[47:15] so they come to church when they want
[47:17] they read when they want they pray when
[47:20] they want they don't reference their
[47:21] husband it can be anything that you
[47:23] don't obey
[47:26] no wonder brother branham could say full
[47:28] obedience to the world will entitle you
[47:30] to the token
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:33] so there are people sitting down and
[47:34] message churches around the world today
[47:37] and the one thing they're not doing
[47:40] qualifies them as an unbeliever
[47:42] because they're using their own
[47:43] reasoning and their own thoughts and
[47:45] their own assessment this is a hard
[47:46] thing you want to get an easy saying
[47:48] it's all right do this dress this way
[47:52] if you left the world you can't be
[47:53] looking like the world if you left the
[47:55] world you can't be talking like the
[47:56] world if you left the world you can be
[47:58] acting like the world
[48:01] we want to make the church uncomfortable
[48:03] this morning for the unbelievers
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:08] because there must be a separation of
[48:10] the word pride with the church members
[48:13] because the unbelievers can go into the
[48:15] upper room to make believers cannot go
[48:18] into the upper room
[48:23] can the church say man
[48:24] so what are you saying with isaac yeah
[48:26] this is not the kind of shout for joy
[48:28] service a couple of weeks ago when
[48:29] brother preached data weighed upon the
[48:31] law that was a fiery service he can't be
[48:33] handed the next week and say every
[48:35] service can be fire fire fire fire is
[48:37] the word this morning is about the hard
[48:39] sayings about taking the world because
[48:41] the world comes to shape you to cut you
[48:44] to take on all the pieces that you may
[48:46] not even realize is there until all
[48:48] that's left is the word image
[48:51] not your idea not your interpretation
[48:53] all that's left is the word image
[48:56] all that's left is jesus christ all
[48:58] that's left is a living faith living
[49:00] virtue living knowledge living outside
[49:02] of that brother branham said you're
[49:04] wasting your time
[49:06] you may be seated
[49:12] it's one thing if you're living in
[49:13] alaska
[49:15] are you living on a mountain and you
[49:16] have no transport and you can't make it
[49:18] to church and you decide to connect on
[49:21] the internet but anybody who has access
[49:23] to fellowship and doesn't come to church
[49:25] unbeliever
[49:30] at home listening to tips reading books
[49:33] that's all right do that on your time
[49:34] but this year is god's time
[49:35] [Applause]
[49:40] hard sins
[49:44] dressing one way for church and dressing
[49:46] another way for work
[49:49] hard sayings
[49:52] but god will have a perfect church
[49:54] acting nice with the neighbors but
[49:56] acting like a rascal in your house with
[49:57] your family
[49:59] han sayings but it's a word there will
[50:02] be a separation of the word pride from
[50:06] the church members
[50:09] and god will force the issue because
[50:11] only the true believers can take the
[50:13] word and stand the test and god will
[50:16] turn the heat up tilling the heat up
[50:18] till the heat up turn the heat up until
[50:20] all the all that other stuff comes off
[50:23] for you can the church say amen it's
[50:26] easy listen you may be seated if you
[50:28] want to go and just jump and shout the
[50:29] pentecostal church has that
[50:35] but this is the age of the overcomer
[50:37] this is the age of the true believer who
[50:40] can take the word wait till their seven
[50:42] thunders utter their voices to that
[50:44] group
[50:45] who could take the word that's true
[50:46] believers and hand it there it'll slice
[50:49] and cut
[50:52] you may be seated don't shout
[50:55] manifestation until you could take the
[50:56] word
[50:57] and hand it there
[50:59] there will be no manifestation until you
[51:01] could take the word and hand it there
[51:03] until you could take correction until
[51:05] you could hear the word and say lord
[51:06] that's me cut me i've been guilty i've
[51:09] been lord i've been doing nonsense but
[51:11] this morning i'm coming back to call i'm
[51:14] getting away from unbelief i'm
[51:15] separating myself
[51:22] you are going to know the truth this
[51:23] morning and the truth is going to set
[51:25] you free that's what we came here you
[51:27] thought this was not you thought this
[51:29] was just another ordinary service but
[51:31] the truth is this is a different kind of
[51:33] service you thought you were going to
[51:34] come here and leave the same but the
[51:36] truth is you either want to get closer
[51:38] to god or further away from god but
[51:40] something's going to happen this morning
[51:42] you thought things in your life would
[51:44] never change but the truth is the holy
[51:47] ghost is here to bring change to bring
[51:49] change in your life you thought you'd
[51:51] always be sick up but the truth is that
[51:54] this morning healing is here you talk
[51:59] hallelujah
[52:01] hallelujah you may be seated you thought
[52:03] you need that friend in the world but
[52:05] the truth is once you have god you don't
[52:07] need nothing else because the test will
[52:09] come to see where you stand this morning
[52:12] can the church say man
[52:14] friends i'm not from the world i come
[52:16] from god and i'm going back to call i'm
[52:19] not here to have church i am tired of
[52:21] having church i'm looking to go into the
[52:24] rapture but only one group will make the
[52:26] rapture and that's the true believers no
[52:29] unbeliever will be there don't make
[52:31] believer will be there only the true
[52:33] believers will be there the hour now
[52:36] come that the true believers the true
[52:38] worshipers could worship the father in
[52:41] spirit and in truth i'm not talking
[52:43] about your past i'm not talking about
[52:45] your mistakes up peter made mistakes up
[52:48] but he made it to the upper rumor peter
[52:50] was a true believer can the church say
[52:53] mm i don't care if you fall down the
[52:55] true believers will be identified
[52:58] because they're gonna get back up again
[53:01] can the church say man
[53:03] don't just look at me say amen the true
[53:06] believers respond to the word i'm not
[53:08] speaking to how you feel i'm not
[53:10] speaking to what you did yesterday i'm
[53:12] speaking to the true believer the word
[53:15] seed inside of your soul the devil could
[53:18] watch you but he cannot touch you
[53:20] because greater is he that's in you than
[53:23] he that's in the world you are not a
[53:25] believer but the word seed in you that's
[53:28] the believer you couldn't miss this if
[53:30] you wanted to you had to be here because
[53:33] the true believers will be identified in
[53:36] this season
[53:39] hallelujah
[53:41] hallelujah
[53:42] somebody give god a shout out praise i'm
[53:45] not talking about the church i'm talking
[53:47] about the true believers we're going to
[53:49] get to the court but brother branham
[53:51] said god could only prove his word by
[53:54] believers are there any believers in the
[53:56] household you believe with all your
[53:58] heart you believe in all your soul but
[54:00] the penum said if you really believe god
[54:03] will give you the holy ghost up do we
[54:05] have any true believers any real
[54:08] believers this morning
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:17] [Music]
[54:18] [Applause]
[54:24] hallelujah
[54:26] hallelujah
[54:27] [Music]
[54:29] hallelujah
[54:31] hard scenes this morning
[54:33] god had to get the church on track
[54:36] and 70 walked away
[54:38] and there was still a devil
[54:41] in the church
[54:45] it takes a revelation
[54:47] to rightly divide
[54:49] the unbeliever now understand this this
[54:51] unbeliever is not the world we're
[54:52] talking about you know
[54:55] this is people in the church
[54:57] in the church we're not talking about
[54:59] marshall montano and nicki minaj and
[55:01] these demonic people
[55:06] we are talking about in the church in
[55:08] the message
[55:10] three kinds of believers
[55:12] in the message
[55:14] people who still want to cut their hair
[55:15] still want to wear makeup still want to
[55:17] wear pants still want to listen to
[55:18] worldly music
[55:21] compromise on the word
[55:24] still put sports over god
[55:26] still put friendship over god
[55:29] still put their life and money over god
[55:33] those are the unbelievers in the church
[55:36] [Applause]
[55:42] in the church with no testimony
[55:45] that's why i said sometime over this
[55:47] week here that's why i said something
[55:48] you can't testify to anybody because you
[55:50] don't even have a testimony
[55:53] how could you tell somebody about jesus
[55:54] when you look like them talk like them
[55:56] act like them curse like them listen and
[55:58] you would tell them come to church they
[55:59] don't want to hear you
[56:02] you must do something different to have
[56:04] the ability to say you want to know why
[56:05] i am this way it's because jesus touched
[56:08] me
[56:10] it's when you live a life
[56:12] you have the opportunity to say yeah i
[56:14] don't smoke i don't drink i don't do it
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:23] the unbelievers are the easy ones to
[56:25] spot
[56:27] but you see the make-believers
[56:34] jesus said except you eat my flesh
[56:37] and drink my blood
[56:39] you have no part for me
[56:41] and judah said hey
[56:50] [Music]
[56:52] and judas was a devil in the church
[56:56] make
[56:56] believer coming to every service
[57:00] paying his tithes the day before he get
[57:02] paid
[57:05] can find a fault with his testimony
[57:09] always in church an hour before the
[57:11] service
[57:14] no argument with nobody
[57:16] no you can't put a finger on him
[57:20] but you know what brother branham said
[57:22] the make-believer is when they
[57:24] compromise on one word
[57:27] they sit in the church reasoning
[57:30] analyzing
[57:31] they believe they are on track to where
[57:33] they're supposed to go
[57:35] but they miss just one word
[57:40] and brother branham said the make
[57:42] believers will show themselves because
[57:44] they cannot make it to the upper room
[57:47] but the branham said it was just when
[57:50] the break was going to take place judas
[57:52] had to expose himself
[57:56] so we are preaching a message point to
[57:58] begin to expose the unbelievers
[58:01] and make believers because there must be
[58:03] a separation
[58:04] of the word pride from the church
[58:06] members
[58:09] somebody's saying man
[58:14] but they ran him in the message the
[58:15] queen of sheba
[58:17] said now some people look at their
[58:19] symptoms
[58:20] my pastor prayed for me last night but
[58:22] my hands know better that has nothing to
[58:25] do with it
[58:26] if you are really a believer you don't
[58:29] even look at that it's already settled
[58:31] forever god healed you
[58:33] what if abraham would have looked that
[58:35] next month to see if sarah was going to
[58:37] have the baby he never noticed that he
[58:40] just noticed what god said and any true
[58:44] believer looks to the promise not what
[58:47] the symptoms are around them they look
[58:49] at what god said so i don't care this
[58:52] morning what your symptoms are your
[58:55] symptoms could be your children it could
[58:57] be your co-worker it could be your boss
[58:59] it could be a sickness it could be
[59:01] anything don't look at the symptoms
[59:03] don't look at the problem look to what
[59:06] god said that's what differentiates the
[59:09] true believers from the make-believer
[59:11] and the unbeliever they only look to
[59:13] what god said
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:17] you may be seated
[59:19] [Applause]
[59:21] in praying brother branham said and we
[59:23] know lord
[59:25] in the message who is this that thy
[59:26] church is not in the majority this
[59:28] morning
[59:29] the true believers are in the minority
[59:32] but someday lord you will take that
[59:34] minority to yourself
[59:36] is that's my prayer this morning that
[59:37] that minority could be taken up this
[59:39] morning can the church say amen
[59:42] in the message might hire the prophet
[59:43] but abandon said all true prophets
[59:46] all true christians all true believers
[59:49] stay with that word no matter what
[59:52] anybody says you stay right with the
[59:54] word they say the days of miracles is
[59:56] past don't you believe it for the bible
[59:59] said he's a same yesterday he is a seem
[1:00:01] to tame he is the same forever
[1:00:06] and this is this i mentioned it before
[1:00:08] improving his word but ibrahim said
[1:00:10] notice it was by his believers that he
[1:00:13] proves his word pride he can only prove
[1:00:16] his word not by unbelievers it's only by
[1:00:19] the believers that he can prove his word
[1:00:22] no matter how much of the rest of them
[1:00:24] claim to be or i believe see if you do
[1:00:26] god will prove it see it's by true
[1:00:29] believers that he proves his word not by
[1:00:32] those who say they believe but by those
[1:00:34] who really believe it's by his believing
[1:00:37] children that he proves his word so god
[1:00:40] is looking for some true believers this
[1:00:43] morning and he don't need much of them
[1:00:45] because one will put a thousand to fight
[1:00:47] two will put ten thousand of life listen
[1:00:50] i'm not preaching to the church this
[1:00:52] morning i'm preaching to the true
[1:00:54] believers you could have walked in this
[1:00:56] morning for the first time but if
[1:00:58] there's a true believing seed in your
[1:00:59] soul and you could take all this word
[1:01:02] then god could use you god to fill you
[1:01:04] god could change you
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:13] but abram went on
[1:01:15] speaking about moses and caleb and
[1:01:17] joshua he said now he had believers the
[1:01:19] old crop had died off
[1:01:22] the unbelievers who said we couldn't
[1:01:24] take it he let every one of them perish
[1:01:27] every one of them bought the believers
[1:01:30] in other words god allowed the
[1:01:31] unbelievers to die out
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:34] because he couldn't use them
[1:01:36] god not using your own belief in them
[1:01:41] we couldn't take it he let every one of
[1:01:42] them perish why every one of them but
[1:01:44] the believers who was left moses had
[1:01:47] been taken to glory and the unbelievers
[1:01:49] had perished in the wilderness
[1:01:51] and their people they have already
[1:01:52] perished in church you know but they
[1:01:54] already perished
[1:01:57] perished in the wilderness and this was
[1:02:00] their children who were going over they
[1:02:02] were the only two that cross over and
[1:02:04] that was the believers joshua and caleb
[1:02:07] there was the believers there was the
[1:02:09] one who crossed over it's the only way
[1:02:12] god can do it is by his believing
[1:02:14] children you believe that his believers
[1:02:17] was the one that do it and is the only
[1:02:19] way that god could do it is to find some
[1:02:21] believers so god is looking for somebody
[1:02:24] who could take all the word and believe
[1:02:26] all the world and can live all the world
[1:02:29] then he has somebody to work through
[1:02:32] are you getting it this morning i want
[1:02:34] to kneel down a few things and then
[1:02:36] we're going to be out of here from the
[1:02:37] message minion church age listen
[1:02:39] carefully but ibrahim said now those
[1:02:42] children of israel left egypt about 2
[1:02:44] million strong
[1:02:46] they all journeyed together
[1:02:49] all saw the same miracles
[1:02:51] all part took of the same manner and
[1:02:54] water from the smitten rock
[1:02:56] all follow the same cloud by day and the
[1:02:59] pillar of fire by night but only two
[1:03:02] reach the promised land
[1:03:03] only two were true or real believers
[1:03:06] that's the prophet
[1:03:08] everybody coming to church everybody in
[1:03:10] the prayer meet him everybody reading
[1:03:12] the books everybody listen to the tapes
[1:03:15] two million people walked out of the
[1:03:17] world up and held to the promised land
[1:03:19] but only two were real believers that is
[1:03:22] correct because the word tells us that
[1:03:24] the rest died
[1:03:27] because of
[1:03:28] unbelief because unbelief could not
[1:03:31] enter in
[1:03:33] then since that is so but a random and
[1:03:36] only two entered then the rest were not
[1:03:39] true believers
[1:03:40] what made the difference two stayed with
[1:03:44] the world
[1:03:47] two stayed with the wood
[1:03:49] when the hearts of the ten spines filled
[1:03:52] at kiddis paneer joshua and caleb did
[1:03:55] not stagger for they believed the word
[1:03:57] and said we are more than able to take
[1:04:00] the land they knew they could because
[1:04:02] god had said it i have given you the
[1:04:04] land and all those israelites saw the
[1:04:07] power and the goodness and deliverance
[1:04:09] of god they did not enter into rest
[1:04:13] listen which is a type of the holy ghost
[1:04:17] so you can see right now
[1:04:19] that very few
[1:04:22] will ever believe
[1:04:24] all the way to receiving the spirit of
[1:04:27] god
[1:04:30] i'll say that again
[1:04:32] brother branham is now just speaking
[1:04:34] about believing
[1:04:36] he's talking about believing all the way
[1:04:39] to receiving
[1:04:41] the spirit of god
[1:04:43] and he typed it as the holy ghost
[1:04:46] so people have to believe all the way to
[1:04:48] receive
[1:04:50] the holy ghost and brother branham said
[1:04:52] any man supposed to say when you had an
[1:04:55] encounter with the holy ghost
[1:04:57] because brother branham when he was
[1:04:58] speaking about acts 19 he said it was
[1:05:01] literally translated as you after having
[1:05:04] believed did you get the holy ghost
[1:05:09] so you have to believe until something
[1:05:11] happens
[1:05:12] [Applause]
[1:05:14] and don't stop believing until something
[1:05:16] happens
[1:05:19] believe until something happens but the
[1:05:22] problem is a lot of people they don't
[1:05:23] want to wait
[1:05:26] they want to ask for it and when god
[1:05:28] says not yet because you don't have the
[1:05:30] character yet
[1:05:33] there's still some issues in your life
[1:05:34] listen you could cry for the holy ghost
[1:05:37] all you want until you clean up the
[1:05:39] areas of your life that's messed up you
[1:05:41] have no holy ghost to get because full
[1:05:44] obedience to the word to the full world
[1:05:46] entitles you to the holy ghost
[1:05:49] so people all over screaming lord kill
[1:05:51] me and god is saying you have the word
[1:05:53] why are you not in church on time
[1:05:56] why are you forsaking the assembling of
[1:05:58] yourselves together
[1:06:00] why are you not reading the bible why
[1:06:02] are you not praying until something
[1:06:03] happens
[1:06:04] then
[1:06:06] then
[1:06:07] then you're gonna get the holy ghost
[1:06:10] god is obligated if you stay with the
[1:06:13] world to give you the baptism of the
[1:06:15] holy ghost
[1:06:17] you may be seated
[1:06:18] god is no respecter of persons he
[1:06:21] doesn't respect pastors apostles he
[1:06:24] respects no person
[1:06:26] god only respects his word
[1:06:29] [Applause]
[1:06:32] i hope this service brings you to a rock
[1:06:34] solid revelation that playing games is
[1:06:37] over
[1:06:37] [Applause]
[1:06:41] you know disobeying one word could stop
[1:06:42] you from getting the holy ghost
[1:06:47] you don't reverence
[1:06:48] your parents
[1:06:50] the bible says honor your father and
[1:06:51] your mother that's a word
[1:06:54] so you're doing everything else and
[1:06:55] you're disrespecting your father
[1:06:57] disrespecting your mother no whole ego
[1:06:59] ghost coming in there
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:03] and the word that god gives you
[1:07:05] is word that you can live on
[1:07:07] because you have a choice
[1:07:10] you always have a choice god doesn't
[1:07:12] take that choice away from you
[1:07:14] on wednesday in the martin i spoke on
[1:07:16] the valley of decision from the book of
[1:07:18] joel multitudes in the valley of
[1:07:20] decision
[1:07:21] life is about choices
[1:07:24] you have a choice who your friends are
[1:07:26] you have a choice who you associate with
[1:07:28] you have a choice of what you make
[1:07:30] important in your life
[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:33] and you must be prepared to accept the
[1:07:35] consequences of your choices
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:40] you sit in debt or worshiping is a
[1:07:42] choice because worshipping is not based
[1:07:44] upon you
[1:07:45] worship is based upon god being who he
[1:07:47] is
[1:07:49] worship is not based on how your day was
[1:07:51] yesterday and what happened last week
[1:07:53] worship is because he is alpha he is
[1:07:55] omega he is beginning he is the end he
[1:07:59] is el shaddai he is jehovah
[1:08:01] he is
[1:08:03] there is none like him i searched all
[1:08:06] over couldn't find nobody nobody like
[1:08:10] jesus
[1:08:11] search high and low still can't find no
[1:08:14] party i may not have money in my pocket
[1:08:16] but i searched all over and i couldn't
[1:08:19] find
[1:08:22] nobody everybody in here have a reason
[1:08:26] to give god a praise offering
[1:08:31] you have no excuse what shall separate
[1:08:34] us from the love of god forget your back
[1:08:36] pain forget your unrighteous forget your
[1:08:39] diabetes what shall separate us
[1:08:42] we are true believers this morning
[1:08:51] [Applause]
[1:08:57] i hope this settles in your soul
[1:09:00] i said in the martin the battle is not a
[1:09:03] weak battle over a month but it's a
[1:09:04] daily battle
[1:09:06] every single day you have to accept
[1:09:08] responsibility for your actions
[1:09:14] the real test and only the true
[1:09:15] believers can take the real test the
[1:09:18] test is all about your response
[1:09:22] we share this in the martian but always
[1:09:24] talk about that woman who said my
[1:09:26] daughter is vexed with the devil god
[1:09:28] wasn't testing what sure she wanted to
[1:09:31] it was her response
[1:09:33] and in the midst of her trial she said
[1:09:35] the right thing
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:46] job
[1:09:48] job's test
[1:09:50] wasn't about what he lost
[1:09:54] the discussion between god and satan was
[1:09:56] what satan's was what was what job's
[1:10:00] response
[1:10:01] was expected to be
[1:10:07] so all of the situations in job's life
[1:10:10] his children his property his animals it
[1:10:13] was not about the animals it was not
[1:10:14] about the children it was not about the
[1:10:16] property it was about his response
[1:10:18] because the wager was that if you
[1:10:21] oppress him he will have a negative
[1:10:23] response
[1:10:24] he will say the wrong thing he will
[1:10:27] curse god
[1:10:30] and even his wife said why don't you
[1:10:31] curse god and die she played into the
[1:10:33] devil's program
[1:10:36] but job looked at his situation
[1:10:38] he looked at his son he looked at his
[1:10:41] daughter he looked at what he lost and
[1:10:43] he said though the skin worms destroy my
[1:10:45] body
[1:10:46] i'm not gonna say the wrong thing yet in
[1:10:48] my flesh i'm gonna see god i might be
[1:10:51] able to put my hand all the way up but
[1:10:53] yet in my flesh there's a resurrection
[1:10:55] power that's got to come if i have the
[1:10:58] right attitude i could still say the
[1:11:01] right thing
[1:11:02] it could be bad but i could still have
[1:11:04] the right response
[1:11:12] is this reaching anybody this morning
[1:11:15] no matter what the situation is you
[1:11:17] could say the right thing
[1:11:20] you may be seated
[1:11:21] sister hatty right
[1:11:23] sitting with the prophet talking with
[1:11:25] the prophet or prophet is sharing an
[1:11:27] experience
[1:11:28] and she said that's nothing but the
[1:11:30] truth
[1:11:33] she didn't come to better brandon i said
[1:11:34] but brandon my sons are giving trouble
[1:11:36] no she just said that's nothing but the
[1:11:39] truth
[1:11:40] and brother branham said you said
[1:11:43] the right thing
[1:11:45] and for this saying
[1:11:47] what do you want
[1:11:54] let that settle down a little bit
[1:11:57] so only the true believers
[1:11:59] will believe all the way
[1:12:02] to receiving the spirit of god
[1:12:06] and listen when peter received the holy
[1:12:08] ghost he didn't have to wonder if he got
[1:12:09] it either
[1:12:12] that's why i always say when
[1:12:16] at mount transfiguration
[1:12:19] when the voice said this is my beloved
[1:12:21] son and whom i will please hear him
[1:12:24] and you hear the hearing part you didn't
[1:12:26] have to wonder if jesus was adopted
[1:12:30] it was not discussion it was not
[1:12:32] speculation his life manifested
[1:12:34] something
[1:12:37] and when god's power is moving in your
[1:12:38] life that's why brother brown said it
[1:12:40] will speak for itself
[1:12:42] because there's a voice that's speaking
[1:12:44] and that voice doesn't give an uncertain
[1:12:47] sound
[1:12:47] we shouldn't have to discuss if jesus
[1:12:50] was adopted if this one was adopted if
[1:12:52] this one has that it should not be a
[1:12:53] discussion because it's supposed to
[1:12:55] speak for itself and when it speaks the
[1:12:57] evidence or the manifestation is a
[1:12:59] hundred percent clear it doesn't need
[1:13:01] interpretation because god doesn't need
[1:13:03] an interpreter
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:09] we're saying some things this morning
[1:13:12] from the message spoken word is your
[1:13:13] original seed can you take some more the
[1:13:14] true believers could take some more
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:23] from the spoken word is your original
[1:13:24] seed but the bible says now let us stand
[1:13:26] like joshua and caleb
[1:13:28] as we see the promised land coming in
[1:13:31] sight
[1:13:32] it's nearing the time to be given
[1:13:35] joshua in hebrew mean savior and
[1:13:38] represents
[1:13:39] the promised end time leader to take the
[1:13:42] church over
[1:13:43] and that's not a man
[1:13:46] caleb represents the true believer who
[1:13:49] stayed with joshua
[1:13:52] god started israel as a virgin with his
[1:13:55] word but they wanted something different
[1:13:58] so did the last day church
[1:14:01] now notice but ibrahim said god did not
[1:14:04] move israel until his own appointed time
[1:14:08] now listen brother branham is speaking
[1:14:10] he said now listen this is going to mean
[1:14:12] something and brother branham is
[1:14:14] speaking about us now he said this is
[1:14:16] going to mean something so i'm telling
[1:14:18] you this but really this is going to
[1:14:19] mean something to you
[1:14:21] joshua waited for that time
[1:14:25] no matter how much people might have
[1:14:28] said god gave us the land let us go now
[1:14:31] and take it
[1:14:32] they might have said joshua you lost
[1:14:34] your commission you're all washed up why
[1:14:37] are you not doing something
[1:14:39] you used to know it does dorsey the lord
[1:14:42] in a moment and what was the will of god
[1:14:45] listen but this wise god sent prophet
[1:14:48] knew the promise of god but also knew to
[1:14:52] wait
[1:14:54] for that promise
[1:14:55] a clear-cut decision from god for his
[1:14:59] time
[1:15:01] in other words nothing will happen
[1:15:03] before it's time
[1:15:09] these parables now watch but ibrahim
[1:15:11] said and when the time come
[1:15:13] god gave it to joshua who had stayed
[1:15:16] with him by the word for he could not
[1:15:19] trust others
[1:15:21] he could trust him
[1:15:23] so will it repeat
[1:15:26] so god is waiting on somebody
[1:15:29] who will believe but also wait until
[1:15:32] god's time
[1:15:34] you can tell god senate right now god
[1:15:37] has his timing
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] his timing for everything just as he
[1:15:42] told them wait in jerusalem tarry until
[1:15:45] you be endured with power from on high
[1:15:48] the lord already you know away ten days
[1:15:50] away three days away two days i pray 20
[1:15:52] hours and god said time is not yet
[1:15:56] and god holds time
[1:15:58] to wait for the right people to be here
[1:16:01] to wait for the
[1:16:02] unbelievers to show their colors and to
[1:16:04] make believers ashoka because there must
[1:16:06] be a separation
[1:16:07] of the word bride from the church
[1:16:09] members because the true believers must
[1:16:11] be identified can the church say amen
[1:16:14] could he take some more
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:18] from a message proving his word but it
[1:16:19] said no i want you to notice he does it
[1:16:21] that way in every age
[1:16:23] he does it every time by the same method
[1:16:26] and that's why i say friends this gospel
[1:16:28] is not rocket science
[1:16:31] he said i am the lord and i change not
[1:16:34] same yesterday today and forever he does
[1:16:36] it that way in every age he does it
[1:16:39] every time by the same method he has to
[1:16:42] take believers and then in order to have
[1:16:44] believers to meet that word he's got to
[1:16:47] predestinate it to that age
[1:16:49] you see it he's got to predestinate this
[1:16:51] thing to be there to meet the challenge
[1:16:54] of the age brother branham said did it
[1:16:56] get you did you feel it did you see it
[1:16:59] do you understand it that's what's
[1:17:01] happening today he predestinated it to
[1:17:04] this by his foreknowledge when he
[1:17:06] predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to
[1:17:09] happen when he come over and producing
[1:17:11] it anything to happen in his word he had
[1:17:14] to prove his word to be so and when he
[1:17:16] predestined anything to happen and says
[1:17:18] it will happen he knows that seed will
[1:17:21] be there just at that time
[1:17:25] brother branham said he predestinated a
[1:17:27] bride she is gonna be there there's
[1:17:29] gonna be a raptor she's gonna be there
[1:17:32] he predestinates it by his foreknowledge
[1:17:34] so there's nothing going to stop him
[1:17:39] glory
[1:17:41] he may be seated
[1:17:43] but i'm in the rejected king but listen
[1:17:45] you true believers in christ you true
[1:17:48] christians that believe in god and the
[1:17:50] supernatural all the time soul was
[1:17:52] training his big army and all those
[1:17:55] intellectuals coming up god had a little
[1:17:57] david out there somewhere feeding his
[1:18:00] father's sheep on sheep food
[1:18:03] the word
[1:18:04] that's why the man of god is cheap food
[1:18:06] the word not on theological weeds he
[1:18:09] happened to be standing by when that
[1:18:11] happened when goliath screamed out david
[1:18:13] just happened to be standing by and
[1:18:16] brother branham said they wanted to give
[1:18:18] david a seminary experience saul came
[1:18:21] and said try my armor try my sword try
[1:18:24] my shield try my doctrine try my idea
[1:18:27] try my revelation try my dream try my
[1:18:30] prophecy but david said i'm not
[1:18:32] comfortable with that i'm used to the
[1:18:34] same word the same signs the same
[1:18:37] message when the beer came up when the
[1:18:40] lion came i use the same word and i want
[1:18:43] to go with the same word it doesn't look
[1:18:45] like a sword it doesn't look like a
[1:18:47] shield i don't need an almond because
[1:18:49] the word is my defensive and the word is
[1:18:51] my offensive i'm not here to defend them
[1:18:54] i'm here to attack him because this
[1:18:56] world must bring results and i'm a true
[1:18:59] believer i don't believe in the sword i
[1:19:01] don't believe in despair but i believe
[1:19:03] in the god of israel i believe in the
[1:19:05] god of abraham isaac and jacob i don't
[1:19:08] need what you got once i got the word i
[1:19:10] got everything
[1:19:13] somebody gave god a shout out pray
[1:19:17] you may be seated the whole of israel
[1:19:20] bogged down in defeat in unbelief listen
[1:19:24] they didn't believe god could deliver
[1:19:26] them
[1:19:26] and god had to take some money
[1:19:29] outside of the army
[1:19:32] somebody who wasn't preaching
[1:19:34] somebody who wasn't teaching
[1:19:36] somebody was off the scene but all he
[1:19:38] had was the word he was just practicing

[1:28:10] hallelujah
[1:28:12] just 15 20 more minutes and i'm done but
[1:28:14] i believe something is breaking forth
[1:28:16] this morning that you don't ever have to
[1:28:19] be the same again i'm putting you on
[1:28:21] notice you no longer have any excuse i'm
[1:28:25] taking it off a minute of the ministry
[1:28:26] this morning to put it in your lap this
[1:28:29] morning to live this word to be in this
[1:28:32] world to stay in the wood to stay in the
[1:28:35] presence to stay in the books to stay in
[1:28:38] the tapes and separate yourself from all
[1:28:41] unbelief separate yourself from anything
[1:28:44] that takes you away from your promise
[1:28:46] whether i maintain my family let me
[1:28:48] maintain christ but i need the holy
[1:28:50] ghost listen
[1:28:53] when they give the emergency
[1:28:55] instructions
[1:28:56] for an aircraft to tell you if we lose
[1:28:59] cabin pressure
[1:29:01] the oxygen masks will drop down
[1:29:05] if you have any children
[1:29:07] make sure
[1:29:09] put your mask on first
[1:29:11] before you put theirs on because if you
[1:29:13] struggle to put theirs on and you don't
[1:29:15] have yours on you might both die
[1:29:17] but make sure and put your mask on then
[1:29:19] you can help anybody once your mask is
[1:29:21] on and friends the mask is the holy
[1:29:24] ghost because the world is losing cabin
[1:29:26] pressure this world is about to implode
[1:29:29] judgment has already been spoken and
[1:29:31] those angels are being held back because
[1:29:33] there are some people who need to be
[1:29:35] sealed with the holy ghost before the
[1:29:37] judgment strikes so it's coming it's
[1:29:40] pressing on every corner and the oxygen
[1:29:42] mass are dropping this morning so you
[1:29:45] can put it on and as for me and my house
[1:29:47] lord as for me and my family lord they
[1:29:50] might be out there but as for me and my
[1:29:52] house we will serve the lord they may
[1:29:55] not understand but put on your mask and
[1:29:57] they're going to feel the pressure and
[1:29:59] they're going to say give me jesus give
[1:30:01] me jesus and the only jesus they will
[1:30:03] see is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:24] in the message fellowship
[1:30:26] where the brandon was dramatizing the
[1:30:28] of jesus going to calvary
[1:30:31] and he was bringing out his drama
[1:30:32] because he said this was the only way
[1:30:34] god could make a provision
[1:30:37] for the true believers
[1:30:38] and brother branham was dramatic he said
[1:30:40] let's look at him
[1:30:42] a few minutes and i'm asking you this
[1:30:43] morning just give us a few minutes
[1:30:45] but the band said the world's in
[1:30:46] darkness the church in its intellectual
[1:30:50] standpoint has fell to the ground
[1:30:53] has toppled
[1:30:54] the nation itself is in captivity it's a
[1:30:58] dark morning first the sun rises pretty
[1:31:01] and then smoke begin to gather in the
[1:31:03] earth we're standing in the upper room
[1:31:05] in jerusalem
[1:31:06] 1900 years ago
[1:31:08] and let's take a little trip now and
[1:31:10] look where our fellowship what happened
[1:31:12] the reason we could have fellowship
[1:31:15] let's watch it a few minutes and see if
[1:31:18] it isn't on the basis of the shed blood
[1:31:20] and but the branham is dramatizing and
[1:31:22] you could see this elijah eagle prophet
[1:31:24] is he seeing it in front of his eyes he
[1:31:26] said i see
[1:31:28] him that's how he said i see him
[1:31:32] i hear a noise outside the window
[1:31:36] what is it
[1:31:38] some of them say what has he done
[1:31:41] i see a little woman run out in front
[1:31:43] say what has he done
[1:31:44] he's only healed the sick
[1:31:47] and comforted the poor
[1:31:49] and brought life hope of life to us
[1:31:54] some man smacks all off the street
[1:31:57] said would you hear her instead of your
[1:31:59] own pastor your priest away with her
[1:32:02] someone else raises up and say i had a
[1:32:04] crippled leg
[1:32:05] and he healed me
[1:32:09] take him to the gallows but the venom is
[1:32:11] seeing it
[1:32:12] but the man said i'm listening to
[1:32:14] something bumping
[1:32:17] let's pull up the shade and look out
[1:32:19] i see coming down the street a sight
[1:32:22] that would break the heart of any iron
[1:32:25] man
[1:32:26] a one that was innocent of any sin but
[1:32:29] yet taken the sin of all the world upon
[1:32:32] him
[1:32:33] never knowed no sin he never one time
[1:32:36] displeased god his father
[1:32:39] there would never was one time he did
[1:32:41] anything that was wrong he was the
[1:32:43] perfect
[1:32:44] and the only perfect man in the world
[1:32:47] and the imperfect church condemned him
[1:32:50] to talk about a place
[1:32:52] they wanted their own organizations
[1:32:54] their own fellowships and so forth but
[1:32:57] god
[1:32:58] was making a way
[1:33:01] for the true believer
[1:33:03] for the real sincere the honest
[1:33:06] believers
[1:33:11] i said last night every time the devil
[1:33:13] produces a goliath god's got a david
[1:33:16] somewhere
[1:33:17] just always remember that now god was
[1:33:20] making a way for the true believer
[1:33:24] as jesus had said he said i hear it
[1:33:26] bumping that's the cross pumping on the
[1:33:28] street
[1:33:29] i look down and see a little bitty frail
[1:33:32] fellow he's got a little white robe
[1:33:34] laying
[1:33:35] over his shoulders wove through all
[1:33:37] without a seam as he goes down dragging
[1:33:39] the cross it's bumping on the street
[1:33:41] hitting against his head thorns blood
[1:33:44] running over his face as he starts up
[1:33:46] the hill
[1:33:48] i noticed some little red dots on his
[1:33:50] coat
[1:33:52] it's question what are those what are
[1:33:54] those little red dots on the back of his
[1:33:56] coat as he goes up the hill
[1:33:58] as farther he goes the brighter those
[1:34:00] little dots get and the wider the spread
[1:34:02] spreading father and father
[1:34:04] and the first thing you know all of them
[1:34:06] go into one great big red splotch
[1:34:08] and the bloods are beating across the
[1:34:10] legs like that what was it god making a
[1:34:12] provision
[1:34:15] for fellowship
[1:34:19] friends i'm read their quote because
[1:34:22] the true believers is not based on your
[1:34:25] merit
[1:34:27] it's based
[1:34:29] on the blood
[1:34:32] don't ever forget
[1:34:34] the blood
[1:34:36] people know the message and they're
[1:34:38] forgotten about the blood
[1:34:41] arguing about church and politics and
[1:34:44] fellowship and this church again and
[1:34:45] they have forgotten about
[1:34:47] the blood amen
[1:34:50] a blood that will never lose its power
[1:34:54] a blood price that was spiritual you
[1:34:56] could be here that i could be here i'm
[1:34:58] not here by my own strength my own merit
[1:35:00] i'm a nobody
[1:35:02] trying to tell everybody
[1:35:04] about somebody who took our sins
[1:35:07] who took our mistakes and you don't want
[1:35:10] to thank god
[1:35:12] and you don't want to worship and you
[1:35:14] don't want to give your whole heart to
[1:35:16] him
[1:35:21] may the holy spirit touch you this
[1:35:23] morning
[1:35:25] in the message and i see each other
[1:35:27] possess the gate of his enemy
[1:35:31] but ibanum said that's the reason we
[1:35:33] find our organizations failing falling
[1:35:37] by the wayside
[1:35:38] it's because when it comes to the test
[1:35:41] what tests god's word there's the test
[1:35:44] god's word is the test and listen to how
[1:35:47] peter branham put the test
[1:35:49] he said will we do
[1:35:51] what a bunch of men says do
[1:35:54] or will we do what god says do he said
[1:35:57] that's the difference
[1:36:03] will we do what a bunch of men says do
[1:36:07] or will we do what god
[1:36:10] says do
[1:36:12] that's the difference
[1:36:15] there he come the days of dwight moody
[1:36:17] the days of finney sankey knocks
[1:36:19] calvin's persian all the rest of them
[1:36:21] those spiritual men
[1:36:23] their organizations followed after them
[1:36:26] they've got a bunch of men back there
[1:36:28] that's cut their ways into it i'm seeing
[1:36:30] this for a reason church
[1:36:32] because we cannot be ignorant anymore of
[1:36:34] these of these things we can't just come
[1:36:36] to church and jump and go home and don't
[1:36:38] know anything
[1:36:40] so i charge you to listen to this tape
[1:36:42] again
[1:36:44] because we're seeing a lot of things
[1:36:45] this morning for a specific reason
[1:36:47] we're not playing games because life and
[1:36:50] death is hanging in the balance
[1:36:52] i don't care what your position is your
[1:36:54] office your station is irrelevant what's
[1:36:56] important is the word and whether or not
[1:36:58] we measure up to the word
[1:37:01] but then i said they've got a bunch of
[1:37:02] men back there that's cut their ways
[1:37:04] into it each one believing this and that
[1:37:07] and adding a little here
[1:37:09] and taking a little away there and
[1:37:12] adding a little here until finally they
[1:37:15] made an organization out of it
[1:37:18] and when they do the real true believer
[1:37:22] god comes right around and picks up some
[1:37:25] little humble person and breaks that
[1:37:27] thing to pieces
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:30] always done it god doesn't change this
[1:37:33] tears that thing up
[1:37:35] to pieces some spiritually minded person
[1:37:39] people who will stay right with that
[1:37:42] word
[1:37:47] i'm heading to the home stretch now
[1:37:50] from the message of spaniard church h i
[1:37:52] want you to listen carefully now we're
[1:37:54] on the home stretch
[1:37:55] but the battle said you see the one
[1:37:58] difference
[1:37:59] between israel
[1:38:00] and the rest of the nations was god
[1:38:05] put god to one side
[1:38:07] and israel was like any other nation
[1:38:11] when samson cut off his here he was like
[1:38:14] any other man put the leadership of the
[1:38:17] holy ghost aside
[1:38:19] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:38:22] with god's name attached to it
[1:38:25] [Applause]
[1:38:30] so who is the head of this church the
[1:38:32] holy ghost
[1:38:33] must be the head of the church
[1:38:35] because brother branham said put the
[1:38:37] leadership of the holy ghost aside and
[1:38:40] the church is nothing but the world with
[1:38:43] god's name attached to it
[1:38:46] listen but the random goes on he said
[1:38:48] the world and the church
[1:38:50] are all of the same lump
[1:38:52] just like jacob and esau were of the
[1:38:55] same parents but the spirit of god
[1:38:58] makes the difference
[1:39:01] but ibrahimovic said it doesn't matter
[1:39:03] if you call yourself a christian anyone
[1:39:06] can do that
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:13] the point is listen whether or not you
[1:39:16] have the spirit of god in you
[1:39:19] for without that spirit you are
[1:39:22] reprobate and that word reprobate means
[1:39:25] rascal it means no good it means
[1:39:28] troublemaker it means good for nothing
[1:39:32] so let me read it again
[1:39:35] anyone can call themselves a christian
[1:39:38] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:39:40] spirit of god in you for without that
[1:39:43] spirit you are reprobate or you are a
[1:39:46] rascal or you are no good or you are a
[1:39:48] trouble maker good for nothing but about
[1:39:50] him said you are none of his and then by
[1:39:52] the bible says amen
[1:39:56] to make sure the picture is caught
[1:39:58] listen to the prophet
[1:39:59] not too long ago i asked a lady if she
[1:40:02] were a christian
[1:40:04] she said to me i will have you know sir
[1:40:06] that i burn a candle every night
[1:40:10] but ibrahim said what in the world
[1:40:14] has that got to do with it
[1:40:16] i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a
[1:40:19] pentecostal that hasn't a thing to do
[1:40:22] with it listen to the prophet it is the
[1:40:24] holy ghost or perish
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:34] so it's not just i believe the thunders
[1:40:36] don't believe the thunders i believe the
[1:40:38] voice i believe the trump i believe it's
[1:40:40] the holy ghost or perish in other words
[1:40:43] after the equation two plus two plus
[1:40:45] five divided by three is the equal sign
[1:40:48] god is interested in
[1:40:53] jump high jump low let the equal sign
[1:40:55] equal the holy ghost inside of you
[1:41:01] if the equal sign if the result is not
[1:41:04] the holy ghost then it doesn't matter
[1:41:06] what you have in the equation
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:15] i'm almost done
[1:41:18] listen but the random continues the same
[1:41:20] quote
[1:41:21] and i have to read it because a lot of
[1:41:23] people don't read these quotes
[1:41:26] but the band said well starting way back
[1:41:28] there in the first church the people got
[1:41:30] to thinking
[1:41:31] and reasoning how to improve on god
[1:41:38] the deeds of the nicolaitans began
[1:41:41] showing themselves then a group formed
[1:41:44] they drifted away from the pattern of
[1:41:47] the word and listen
[1:41:49] all it takes is just one word
[1:41:52] changed
[1:41:54] and that little leaven then levels the
[1:41:56] whole lump
[1:41:58] he that offends in one point of the law
[1:42:01] is guilty of all
[1:42:03] that's the word that's why brother
[1:42:05] branham can say full obedience to the
[1:42:08] entire world will entitle you to the
[1:42:10] token
[1:42:11] so you know everything but you still
[1:42:13] can't forgive
[1:42:14] you still can't shake my hand you have
[1:42:16] no holy ghost again you have no rapture
[1:42:18] to go to
[1:42:21] you can't forgive your husband you can't
[1:42:22] forgive your wife you can't forgive
[1:42:25] and you go into which rapture
[1:42:29] which heaven
[1:42:30] because there are places named heaven
[1:42:32] hotel heaven restaurant heaven
[1:42:35] boss's name rapture maybe it's a bus
[1:42:40] listen but the band said eve just
[1:42:42] changed one word but it said that will
[1:42:45] do it
[1:42:47] so i'm charging you church
[1:42:50] recently our brother said to me a lot of
[1:42:51] people say say what he taped say say
[1:42:53] well what but bananas say and why we
[1:42:55] need preachers
[1:42:58] i said well brother
[1:43:00] it is not just
[1:43:02] the preachers have their role to rightly
[1:43:04] divide what brother branham said because
[1:43:05] he said they will come many will make
[1:43:07] more sense it
[1:43:08] so you have to take what brother branham
[1:43:09] said
[1:43:11] and he was telling me he was in a
[1:43:12] message church where the minister just
[1:43:14] preached his own ideas preached his own
[1:43:15] ideas i said that's why we say say what
[1:43:17] the tapes say
[1:43:18] and people say see where the tapes are
[1:43:20] and sit on home and listen to tapes and
[1:43:22] forsake the assembling
[1:43:26] to justify their own issues
[1:43:29] god is not interested in your issues
[1:43:33] god is respecting his word
[1:43:37] want to get god's blessing become
[1:43:40] serious with god
[1:43:43] some time ago i saw a woman preacher
[1:43:47] i said not only is it a woman preaching
[1:43:49] but her head is cut
[1:43:52] wearing earrings wearing makeup by
[1:43:53] saying no you're just compounding the
[1:43:55] issue and when you read this better but
[1:43:56] i would say just one word off
[1:43:59] and people stacking this wrong this
[1:44:01] wrong this wrong and they saying we all
[1:44:03] go into heaven which
[1:44:04] heaven why would god in a prophet for us
[1:44:07] to be doing the stuff that the
[1:44:08] pentecostal church does
[1:44:12] we have to climb higher friends
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:16] let me continue reading i'm almost done
[1:44:18] the musicians can get ready to come up
[1:44:20] and when that listen to her brandon
[1:44:22] describe it when that satan-centered
[1:44:25] group was formed it began to hate and to
[1:44:28] fight the true believers
[1:44:29] insisting that they
[1:44:33] the aliens were the church of god
[1:44:35] so the persecution sets in now listen
[1:44:38] notice how organization breathes hatred
[1:44:43] it destroys fellowship it makes
[1:44:46] bitterness that is what myr means that
[1:44:48] is what smyrna was full of bitterness a
[1:44:51] root of bitterness defies many so more
[1:44:54] and more the firemen was coming in and
[1:44:56] every age
[1:44:58] will feel its car
[1:45:01] but ibrahim said the smurfian church had
[1:45:03] drifted far from the original
[1:45:05] it had become hybrid
[1:45:07] it had hybridized itself the way eve did
[1:45:11] you know what a hybrid is what comes of
[1:45:13] two species mixing
[1:45:15] the result is no longer pure like the
[1:45:18] original
[1:45:19] it is a mongrel
[1:45:21] how you expect to mix this with the
[1:45:23] world
[1:45:25] and get
[1:45:26] a perfect result
[1:45:29] it's impossible
[1:45:34] i'll skip down some of this
[1:45:39] but the banner said the church has
[1:45:40] departed from what she originally was
[1:45:44] i'm a baptist it wasn't so in the
[1:45:45] beginning i'm a methodist it wasn't so
[1:45:47] in the beginning i'm with this minister
[1:45:49] i'm with this group i'm a dissident it
[1:45:51] wasn't so in the beginning instead of
[1:45:54] the straight word of god instead of the
[1:45:56] spirit-filled men in the church who were
[1:45:59] led by spirit given a revelation they
[1:46:02] are all creeds and bylaws and the
[1:46:05] educated guesses
[1:46:07] of educated men
[1:46:09] learning has taken the place of
[1:46:11] revelation
[1:46:12] reason has replaced fate
[1:46:15] programs have replaced spontaneous
[1:46:18] praise in the holy ghost it wasn't so
[1:46:20] from the beginning the whole species has
[1:46:23] changed it is a hybrid church listen to
[1:46:26] what brother branham asks now when the
[1:46:28] church becomes hybridized
[1:46:30] will it produce pure christians it can't
[1:46:33] the life or seed that brings christians
[1:46:36] to the birth is not in them like brings
[1:46:39] forth like the baptists bring more
[1:46:41] baptists the methodists bring methodists
[1:46:44] not one is known by the power of god
[1:46:46] they are known by their worship and
[1:46:47] their creeds and the original world will
[1:46:50] produce the original life so church let
[1:46:52] us get to the original word and every
[1:46:54] one of the words
[1:46:58] the musicians could come up
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:02] getting ready to close out here
[1:47:04] now let's touch
[1:47:06] on my scripture
[1:47:08] revelation 22 18
[1:47:10] for i testify unto every man
[1:47:13] that here are the words of the prophecy
[1:47:15] of this book
[1:47:16] for if any man shall add
[1:47:19] unto these things god shall add unto him
[1:47:21] the plagues that are written
[1:47:23] in this book
[1:47:24] and if any man shall take away
[1:47:27] from the words of the prophecy of this
[1:47:30] of the book of this prophecy god shall
[1:47:32] take away his part out of the book of
[1:47:35] life this is a serious admonition
[1:47:38] this is how the bible ends friends
[1:47:41] out of the holy city and from the things
[1:47:43] that are written in this book
[1:47:44] but the banham said in ephesian church
[1:47:46] age it is a changing of even just one
[1:47:50] word by taken away or adding to it it is
[1:47:53] the original trick of satan in the
[1:47:55] garden of eden
[1:47:57] he just added one little word to what
[1:47:59] god said and that did it
[1:48:00] it brought debt and destruction
[1:48:03] and in ephesus it was just the same just
[1:48:06] a word added just a word taken away and
[1:48:08] the anti-word anti-christ spirit
[1:48:11] began to flourish
[1:48:13] and but the battle said the antichrist
[1:48:14] doesn't deny the word
[1:48:16] but the brandon said the antichrist
[1:48:18] believes the word just not how it's
[1:48:20] written
[1:48:26] we're really in the word this morning
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:29] but the branham said did you get it now
[1:48:31] there are those twins again there are
[1:48:33] those two trees growing side by side
[1:48:37] in the same earth partaking of the same
[1:48:39] nourishment they're coming to church
[1:48:41] drinking in the same rain and benefiting
[1:48:44] from the same sun but they come from
[1:48:46] different seeds
[1:48:47] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[1:48:51] as god gave it
[1:48:53] and loves and obeys it the other tree is
[1:48:56] from the sea that is anti the word of
[1:48:59] god and changes it where it wants to
[1:49:02] it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[1:49:06] for the living true word exactly as did
[1:49:09] king who ended up killing abel but fear
[1:49:12] not little flock brother branham said
[1:49:14] stay with the world keep that word
[1:49:17] between you and the devil
[1:49:20] eve did not do that and she failed
[1:49:24] and when the church lets down on the
[1:49:26] wood she goes into the depths of the
[1:49:29] darkness of satan
[1:49:30] can the church say amen
[1:49:35] but the random says these ephesians are
[1:49:37] going to escape some of it
[1:49:39] these ephesians were christians
[1:49:41] they bought a name and that name was
[1:49:43] christ who was the spirit of god within
[1:49:45] them which was which was one of the
[1:49:47] threefold names of gods but abandoned
[1:49:49] said these believers weren't laboring
[1:49:51] for paul
[1:49:52] or for an organization they weren't
[1:49:54] committed to programs and institutions
[1:49:57] whereby they built up holdings of value
[1:49:59] they worked for the lord they were his
[1:50:01] servants not the pawns of the
[1:50:03] organization they didn't go to church on
[1:50:05] sunday and talk about that name and then
[1:50:08] forget it on the rest of the week they
[1:50:10] didn't give live service to that name no
[1:50:12] sir it was their lives that were given
[1:50:14] those are the true believers
[1:50:17] all they did they did in that name in
[1:50:20] that name they acted but if they could
[1:50:22] act in that name then they refrain from
[1:50:24] acting
[1:50:25] these were heavenly place christians
[1:50:27] whose behavior was in the lord
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:33] but abandoned said but that false vine
[1:50:35] group had wanted to defile that name
[1:50:38] hung like skulking wolves in the dark
[1:50:40] waiting to get in and tear down but the
[1:50:42] scene stood the test and kept the word
[1:50:44] and the name
[1:50:47] so that's what we are kneeling down here
[1:50:49] this morning friends the true believers
[1:50:51] will keep every word
[1:50:53] will defend the word not the church
[1:50:54] defend the word fight for the word
[1:50:57] content for the word fight for the word
[1:50:59] content for the word give me the word i
[1:51:01] don't want nothing else for the word
[1:51:02] because the word is the conductor of the
[1:51:04] spirit and if i live the world the
[1:51:06] spirit must flow the spirit must move
[1:51:09] the spirit must operate
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:18] you could be in a play something softly
[1:51:20] in a message christianity versus
[1:51:21] idolatry
[1:51:23] but abandon said that's right you have
[1:51:24] got to know the word
[1:51:26] stay on the word
[1:51:28] see the great battle is at hand
[1:51:33] now we have played church for years and
[1:51:35] years this is pretty random
[1:51:37] but the hour comes now when janice and
[1:51:40] jambres will withstand moses as the
[1:51:42] bible said they would and it's going to
[1:51:45] be spiritual battle conflict
[1:51:48] there'll be some just continue on the
[1:51:50] denominational church will just move
[1:51:52] right on into the nomination and go on
[1:51:54] the way it goes
[1:51:56] but i mean the real true believer is
[1:51:59] coming to that battlefield and you'd
[1:52:01] better be versed and know what you're
[1:52:03] doing or you can take an evil spirit so
[1:52:06] easy and not know
[1:52:09] if it's contrary to this word don't
[1:52:12] believe it stay with that word
[1:52:17] young people the word says stay away
[1:52:19] from shady places
[1:52:22] a shady place is a place without light
[1:52:28] a place that's unsure a place you're not
[1:52:30] supposed to be in because you're not
[1:52:32] sure you're supposed to be there
[1:52:35] brother branham said if you're not sure
[1:52:37] don't do it
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:41] that's the word if you stay behind the
[1:52:43] word the devil can't touch you
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:47] so i charge you church
[1:52:50] clean out your houses
[1:52:52] clean out your lives
[1:52:54] clean out your associations
[1:52:57] make time to read the bible make time to
[1:53:00] read the message make time to be in
[1:53:02] service
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:05] where your priorities look in the mirror
[1:53:07] of the world i'm not coming to check
[1:53:09] where you at
[1:53:10] you have to answer for yourself the
[1:53:12] bible says judge yourself so you will be
[1:53:14] judged
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] you judge yourself by the word so you
[1:53:19] wouldn't be judged and the word is
[1:53:21] coming clear this morning so that you
[1:53:23] can know where you stand are you our
[1:53:24] unbeliever
[1:53:26] you can't take the word you can't take
[1:53:28] rebuke you can't take it are you a
[1:53:30] make-believer you want some of the word
[1:53:32] you want
[1:53:33] you want to twist this or are you a true
[1:53:34] believer
[1:53:36] and your identification is how you stay
[1:53:40] with that word
[1:53:41] not how you stay with the church and how
[1:53:43] you stay with the pastor how you stay
[1:53:46] with the word
[1:53:47] because each of us have to make a we're
[1:53:49] calling an election sure
[1:53:51] because there's a rapture coming and
[1:53:53] there's judgment coming this is reality
[1:53:56] friends more real than elections coming
[1:53:59] more real than the earthquake coming
[1:54:01] this is reality friends
[1:54:04] how close it
[1:54:06] is recognize the call of god's word in
[1:54:09] the easter seal and it's an eagle to an
[1:54:12] eagle
[1:54:15] it's a scream of an eagle
[1:54:17] there was something inside a little
[1:54:18] fella that he knowed he was an eagle and
[1:54:22] brother said the same thing is with
[1:54:23] every true believer
[1:54:25] when the preaching of god's word comes
[1:54:27] forth and is vindicated and proved that
[1:54:30] it's god's word for this hour then
[1:54:32] there's something within the believer i
[1:54:35] don't care how loyal his father was to
[1:54:37] the church or how loyal his mother was
[1:54:39] or his grandparents and if the church is
[1:54:41] teaching contrary to this hour of the
[1:54:43] baptism of the holy ghost message
[1:54:45] there's something in him that screams
[1:54:47] out
[1:54:48] he will leave that barnyard he's got to
[1:54:50] do it the chicken might have been all
[1:54:52] right one big day but this is eagle hour
[1:54:55] it's different there's something he must
[1:54:58] leave the old coop and fly away into the
[1:55:00] blue then this earthly body is quickened
[1:55:03] and brought by the quickening spirit to
[1:55:05] the obedience of god's word
[1:55:07] now when this holy spirit represented as
[1:55:10] the eagle flying over the land finds the
[1:55:12] believer no man can come
[1:55:14] unless the father
[1:55:16] draws him
[1:55:18] and this is where i got my inspiration
[1:55:20] from the message god's word call for a
[1:55:22] total separation
[1:55:23] from unbelief
[1:55:25] it is a total separation
[1:55:27] we're not to go back into the world no
[1:55:29] more or have anything to do with the
[1:55:32] world but cleave only unto god
[1:55:35] jesus is coming after a bride a woman a
[1:55:38] church that's separated from the things
[1:55:40] of the world or the cares of the world
[1:55:42] she is separated from the fashions of
[1:55:44] this modern age that we live in she is
[1:55:47] separated from the cares and the
[1:55:49] traditions of churches she is separated
[1:55:52] only to god and god is the word and as
[1:55:56] husband and wife is one so does the
[1:55:58] bride and the world become one for the
[1:56:01] world is living through the bride that's
[1:56:04] how that's her credential that's her
[1:56:07] identification
[1:56:09] may the lord richly bless you this
[1:56:11] morning brother gideon let's stand our
[1:56:13] feet.
