[13:36] the same way that he is now now listen
[13:39] this means this
[13:41] here's the words
[13:43] what he hears

[13:49] the word that through the age of wesley
[13:52] luther they began to arise with power
[13:56] as he started to move on
[13:59] and afterwards he moved a little bit
[14:01] more now he's getting
[14:04] to the identification now see watch it
[14:07] now it's getting to the point
[14:10] where life is in the skin
[14:14] which is a confirmation
[14:16] and that the rapture is nigh
[14:20] this is a confirmation
[14:22] that the rupture is tonight
[14:25] when you see the head and the body
[14:27] become one
[14:29] and the body is almost ready to be a
[14:32] receiver to the head

[15:12] for the rupture
[15:14] he brings us life to the body as a
[15:16] medication

[15:26] and nothing can hold him down on his
[15:28] earth and the life of christ

[52:37] i thank god for the privilege
[52:39] given to me through this platform
[52:42] to greet
[52:43] to greet you
[52:51] i would like to firstly thank pastor
[52:53] theovid from trinidad
[52:57] my god
[53:12] uh obviously we cannot see each other
[53:16] and we have never met possibly
[53:21] let me quote this famous saying from
[53:23] paul when he said
[53:25] but though i be absent in the flesh
[53:28] yet um
[53:30] am i
[53:31] with you in the spirit but there is a
[53:32] possibility though we have oceans and
[53:35] minds
[53:37] between us
[53:38] uh
[53:53] for the opportunity given to me to speak
[53:56] during 10 minutes i will do my best to
[53:59] speak in this time you know the
[54:01] ministers
[54:02] we love to speak on behalf of god of
[54:05] jesus speak to you and advising you as
[54:08] much as possible honestly
[54:10] let me say this i find myself too small
[54:15] the reason is that i didn't spend enough
[54:18] time in this message in comparison
[54:21] to many who came before me who fought
[54:24] great battles
[54:26] for years
[54:29] to bring
[54:31] this message to the people to add value
[54:34] to it you see
[54:35] when i mention the word message maybe
[54:38] some people will not understand why am i
[54:40] emphasizing this word message
[54:46] if the lord grants me
[54:48] one day to explain it
[54:50] to you
[54:58] it is good
[55:00] to introduce myself
[55:02] and tell you who am i
[55:18] two million people
[55:22] on a 2
[55:23] 400 square meters surface though it is a
[55:27] little highly but god found good to send
[55:29] us
[55:30] the message
[55:32] we have not been forgotten
[55:35] in the spreading of these
[55:37] bread descended
[55:38] from heaven
[55:41] of time that's
[55:43] the reason why brother branham said in
[55:45] the massive spiritual food inducing
[55:47] program
[55:52] and it gives
[55:54] me great pleasure to get to see when you
[55:57] know that you have a message from god
[55:59] is clear about it
[56:02] when we know that we have a message from
[56:05] god
[56:06] and we share it
[56:09] to the children
[56:14] welcoming gives
[56:17] us a great pleasure to see
[56:20] that it is the bread of heaven
[56:22] it's like jesus in john chapter 6
[56:27] the bread of life
[56:28] this is what the message is to us today
[56:32] we
[56:33] welcome this message
[56:36] you cannot know
[56:37] how much it is for us i come from a
[56:40] pagan religion called talmud
[56:43] [Music]
[57:10] from
[57:15] when i was 16 years old
[57:19] my father met some people who went
[57:20] through
[57:21] christianity
[57:22] and i found myself on friday on a friday
[57:25] 1970 75
[57:28] i found myself in the church listening
[57:29] to pastor and that was the first time i
[57:32] had to hear
[57:34] the word of god
[57:35] that was the first time they preached
[57:37] the bible to me
[57:39] the men were speaking about the prodigal
[57:41] son
[57:43] i was crying and wondering what it
[57:46] what is that book that
[57:48] which can make me cry solid
[57:51] and i finally
[57:58] i was called to
[57:59] go through the prayer line when it was
[58:01] my turn to go through it
[58:03] i was pounding
[58:05] i could hardly breathe the man asked me
[58:08] do you believe max 16.
[58:11] i didn't have a clue about max 16 he got
[58:14] it to me the chalet hands on the seat
[58:16] and they shall recover he said to me do
[58:18] you believe it i said yes i do i say yes
[58:21] like a child
[58:22] it was it was the fate of a child in
[58:25] ladies and gentlemen me and i was healed
[58:27] on the spot
[58:29] that happened in 1970 16 i was 16 years
[58:32] old and
[58:34] i'm 63 years old
[58:36] 40 years later
[58:38] i was never
[58:40] never suffered an asthma attack in my
[58:42] life
[58:43] to shorten my story
[58:45] i was a trinity assembly of god believer
[58:49] i
[58:49] spent the four years there i found out
[58:52] something was wrong with it i had a test
[58:54] for deepest thing leaving that church
[58:56] i joined
[58:58] the unitarian church
[59:01] i've been a pastor for nine years
[59:04] i was pastor of many churches even then
[59:08] i couldn't satisfy the death and hunger
[59:12] within me and finally after five years
[59:15] of a backsliding line i wanted to commit
[59:18] suicide
[59:20] i suffered for schizophrenia and
[59:22] depression
[59:24] i wanted to commit society when i was a
[59:26] unitarian pedicure believer i remember i
[59:29] was persecuting
[59:43] and then in 1993 i came across the
[59:46] message
[59:49] i started reading the message
[59:51] quickly i was sincerely sorry
[59:54] for all the troubles and difficulties i
[59:56] did to the merciful leaders
[59:58] i had to pay for it
[1:00:00] i tell you a six
[1:00:03] electroconvulsive
[1:00:04] therapies due to my sickness the doctors
[1:00:08] couldn't find what i was suffering from
[1:00:11] it is a long story
[1:00:13] it will take me time to tell it in the
[1:00:15] day the message was a turning point in
[1:00:17] my life
[1:00:18] and it turned my life around at night
[1:00:21] 1993.
[1:00:27] i have been in touch with this message
[1:00:29] for 29 years
[1:00:34] let me tell you the truth i've been
[1:00:36] going
[1:00:38] higher and higher concerning the theme
[1:00:40] of the convention which i love very much
[1:00:43] the life of christ
[1:00:47] 200 years story of mauritius
[1:00:50] i had a privilege to be allowed to go to
[1:00:53] prison and
[1:00:54] preach i was telling the prisoners you
[1:00:57] know nowadays the people are no more
[1:01:00] listening with their hears but they
[1:01:02] observe with the eyes they want to see
[1:01:07] how much the things
[1:01:10] you preach are literally lived in our
[1:01:13] lives the life of christ
[1:01:15] i really love the example of brother
[1:01:17] branham when he was speaking of a man a
[1:01:19] drinker he was walking on the street on
[1:01:22] a christmas
[1:01:51] but how much i can leave it it is not
[1:01:54] how much the message books i how my
[1:01:57] message i can carry but how much i can
[1:01:59] leave the message of christ which will
[1:02:01] attract people to realize
[1:02:03] that we are not
[1:02:05] just preachers but there is a light
[1:02:07] behind it
[1:02:09] behind our preaching
[1:02:11] our sermons
[1:02:13] so
[1:02:15] i believe
[1:02:16] this thing
[1:02:18] to be of interest a theme to think about
[1:02:23] i don't know yet who
[1:02:25] will preach in the convention
[1:02:27] i'm sure they will emphasize the
[1:02:29] messages
[1:02:30] on this very important theme
[1:02:59] and may we meet the requirements for the
[1:03:02] message we believe
[1:03:05] i would have loved to say a little more
[1:03:08] but let me go
[1:03:10] something to you
[1:03:12] before i close
[1:03:14] your
[1:03:15] there is a warning here
[1:03:17] when we preach on these kind of subjects
[1:03:20] i hope that
[1:03:21] some people will not go off on deep
[1:03:27] i mean that they will try
[1:03:28] by themselves to produce the life of
[1:03:30] jesus christ this can be dangerous doing
[1:03:32] so
[1:03:33] it can discourage or even disappoint
[1:03:35] those who will fail
[1:03:37] and it is just because
[1:03:39] they are trying to do it by themselves
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:23] sometimes when we speak about the life
[1:04:25] of christ people are trying to
[1:04:26] manufacture it but it is
[1:04:30] something natural in his heart
[1:04:34] we are not asked to manufacture
[1:04:35] something
[1:04:38] we are acting
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:06] artificial
[1:05:20] this life of christ doesn't need to be
[1:05:21] manufactured many fail
[1:05:24] doing
[1:05:25] so in the pilgrimage trying to to
[1:05:27] manufacture to impersonate christianity
[1:05:31] one last call
[1:05:34] february 1963
[1:05:38] but if
[1:05:40] you are alone
[1:05:41] another goal see lames is what
[1:05:45] it is
[1:05:47] they'll be separated someday
[1:06:00] manufacture the fruit of the spirit but
[1:06:01] to bear the fruit of the spirit and as
[1:06:04] long as it is a sheep it will burn
[1:06:08] it don't have
[1:06:09] to manufacture
[1:06:11] the cleanse and everything in it
[1:06:15] is
[1:06:30] the extra time i do i pray
[1:06:34] your conviction to succeed may god rich
[1:06:36] bless you
[1:06:37] as it will
[1:06:38] emphasize on the interpretation

[1:13:00] gonna start with genesis 5 24.
[1:13:07] and enoch walked with god
[1:13:12] and he was not
[1:13:15] for god took him
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:30] it goes beyond just a
[1:13:32] quoting
[1:13:34] it's a walk
[1:13:36] a walk with god
[1:13:39] acts 2 24.
[1:13:43] whom god hath raised up having loosed
[1:13:48] the pains of death
[1:13:50] because it was not possible
[1:13:53] that he should be holding of it
[1:14:09] how shall we escape
[1:14:11] if we neglect so great salvation
[1:14:15] which
[1:14:16] at the first began to be spoken by the
[1:14:19] lord and was confirmed
[1:14:23] or
[1:14:24] vindicated
[1:14:25] unto us
[1:14:27] by them
[1:14:28] that heard him
[1:14:30] god also bearing them witness both with
[1:14:34] signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:14:39] miracles
[1:14:40] and gifts of the holy ghost according to
[1:14:44] his own will
[1:14:45] come on
[1:15:10] manifested
[1:15:11] and we have seen it
[1:15:14] and bear witness
[1:15:16] and show unto you
[1:15:19] that eternal life
[1:15:21] which was with the father and was
[1:15:25] manifested onto us
[1:15:38] hallelujah let's bow our heads in a word
[1:15:40] of prayer
[1:15:42] lord in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:45] we thank you for that
[1:15:48] the prophet said it's a thunder that
[1:15:51] shakes the devil
[1:15:53] oh the life behind the name
[1:15:57] god we give you glory and praise
[1:16:00] that we could understand these things
[1:16:04] that it has been manifested unto us
[1:16:08] and now lord i pray that this uh
[1:16:11] small contribution
[1:16:14] may bless the convention
[1:16:17] both on site and online
[1:16:20] we give you glory and honor
[1:16:23] keep us by your power lord
[1:16:26] we give you praise
[1:16:28] and the lord may you be glorified
[1:16:33] and oh god we all have individual
[1:16:35] messages
[1:16:37] but thank you that we're all centralized
[1:16:40] around one message
[1:16:44] that vindicated message
[1:16:51] in jesus christ's name
[1:16:52] amen and amen
[1:16:54] praise the lord you can be seated and
[1:16:56] online as well
[1:16:58] may god bless you richly
[1:17:01] and trusting that bro god is bringing us
[1:17:03] to a place
[1:17:05] where we can't disbelieve any longer
[1:17:10] praise be to god
[1:17:11] we're at an hour
[1:17:13] where god is going to move amen and my
[1:17:16] title today
[1:17:18] is the true
[1:17:20] easter vindication
[1:17:24] we've all heard the message true easter
[1:17:26] seal
[1:17:29] and with that in mind
[1:17:30] we talk about the true easter
[1:17:33] vindication
[1:17:35] because if the same spirit
[1:17:37] that rose christ from the dead
[1:17:40] dwell in you
[1:17:42] it shall quicken your mortal bodies
[1:17:46] hallelujah
[1:17:47] more about that later on
[1:17:49] we give god the glory
[1:17:51] for the message like this
[1:17:53] amen that can be vindicated
[1:18:10] about
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:23] the picture we all know
[1:18:33] and as we go forward
[1:18:36] i want to start with this opening
[1:18:37] statement
[1:18:52] vindication
[1:18:55] of omnipotence
[1:18:58] that the world has ever known
[1:19:00] how many believe that
[1:19:02] that is nothing but the truth
[1:19:06] we're on the threshold
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:26] the greatest vindication
[1:19:29] of omnipotence
[1:19:32] that the world has ever known
[1:19:46] i hope the children and the young people
[1:19:52] because it belongs to them too
[1:19:55] it is revealed to our children also
[1:19:58] and the prophet goes that that cain
[1:20:02] was just as religious as abel
[1:20:06] they both built altars
[1:20:08] they both loved god
[1:20:12] they both made sacrifices
[1:20:15] they both
[1:20:16] pay
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:29] which is the revelation
[1:20:33] the word of god revealed
[1:20:36] made plain
[1:20:38] showed out
[1:20:40] amen
[1:20:42] and vindicated
[1:20:58] bananas but god never vindicated it
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:04] but god required worship
[1:21:08] cain made the offering
[1:21:11] that god didn't vindicate
[1:21:26] the virtue of jesus christ
[1:21:28] the godliness of jesus christ
[1:21:30] and the love of god which is jesus
[1:21:33] christ
[1:21:34] amen that's what shakes the devil
[1:21:38] is the life behind the name
[1:21:40] praise
[1:21:47] moses
[1:21:48] amen he was vindicated
[1:21:52] he went down to egypt
[1:21:54] you remember he was challenged
[1:21:57] in the house of pharaoh
[1:21:59] and uh the film records this statement
[1:22:02] a cheap magician's trick
[1:22:06] but god knew
[1:22:34] amen and his stick was more powerful
[1:22:38] than the armies of egypt
[1:22:40] praise be to god
[1:22:42] moses was vindicated
[1:22:46] amen with the god of heaven
[1:22:48] behind him
[1:22:50] and he performed that miracle
[1:22:52] praise the lord
[1:22:53] amen and we know that this is a reality
[1:22:57] because god trusted moses
[1:23:00] he gave him that vindication
[1:23:03] another example if you like
[1:23:06] of course elijah
[1:23:08] amen was uh i think a great example
[1:23:12] because this was the mount carmel uh
[1:23:15] showdown
[1:23:18] you wait till we strike the mount zion
[1:23:20] showdown
[1:23:22] oh man
[1:23:23] that's going to shut a lot of mouse
[1:23:26] and when elijah
[1:23:29] lay the bullock upon there
[1:23:32] and poured
[1:23:44] and here it is
[1:23:46] if you
[1:24:01] if you say you're a believer
[1:24:03] god vindicates it
[1:24:05] you don't have to presume
[1:24:08] vindication
[1:24:10] is the opposite to presuming
[1:24:13] amen it's it's god who consumes
[1:24:18] he said you don't have to presume
[1:24:21] that's right
[1:24:23] it is a vindication
[1:24:25] and when god came down
[1:24:27] they screamed out
[1:24:29] he is the god
[1:24:31] he is the god
[1:24:33] hallelujah and the prophets of baal had
[1:24:35] to run
[1:24:37] amen amen and it's the same thing today
[1:24:40] oh the false hoods
[1:24:55] amen it's a very good one
[1:24:57] as brother branham talked about the
[1:24:59] temple
[1:25:01] you could not make the temple anyway
[1:25:04] because there was a specific
[1:25:07] instruction
[1:25:09] make the temple
[1:25:23] because thy will be done
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:38] pillar of fire came in
[1:25:41] and the priest couldn't even minister
[1:25:45] oh my god
[1:25:46] it was a what a vindication that was
[1:25:49] you can't just do things your way
[1:25:52] like we we say like frank sinatra
[1:25:56] i did it my way
[1:25:58] you can't do it your way
[1:26:00] you've got to do it god's way
[1:26:03] amen he said this is my way
[1:26:05] it is the harder way
[1:26:07] but this is that
[1:26:09] which will bring and come to pass
[1:26:12] the glorious victory in the love divine
[1:26:16] because it is his way
[1:26:18] praise be to god what can we say to
[1:26:20] these things
[1:26:21] we have to do it the according to the
[1:26:23] pattern
[1:26:25] god will vindicate his pattern
[1:26:28] amen and look how brother
[1:26:30] says it
[1:26:32] in a message called dedication
[1:26:46] for its resting place
[1:27:03] glory
[1:27:05] upon the whole building
[1:27:08] and the glory
[1:27:09] was so great
[1:27:12] till the priests
[1:27:14] couldn't even minister
[1:27:16] because
[1:27:28] you've got to allow the world to come in
[1:27:58] when
[1:28:04] as well hallelujah glory to his name
[1:28:08] the glory was so great
[1:28:11] the priest couldn't even minister
[1:28:13] what a great vindication that was
[1:28:16] now you see the vindication
[1:28:18] we've given you examples
[1:28:20] of of moses of elijah of solomon's
[1:28:24] temple
[1:28:25] there are many more
[1:28:53] but i want to just back up one step
[1:28:57] and go back to moses
[1:28:59] when he smoked a rock
[1:29:01] and the water came
[1:29:03] was he vindicated
[1:29:07] that's an interesting question
[1:29:10] because in reality
[1:29:11] the water came
[1:29:13] because god respected the gift
[1:29:17] but he made the biggest mistake
[1:29:20] that he could have ever made
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:49] he said
[1:29:50] regardless if it wasn't god's will
[1:29:54] we know
[1:29:55] it wasn't god's will
[1:29:57] we admit that
[1:29:59] but watch moses
[1:30:01] had power
[1:30:03] to bring it
[1:30:17] he says whether it was god's will or not
[1:30:21] is that true
[1:30:23] we know it was against god's word
[1:30:26] but
[1:30:27] god had entrusted
[1:30:31] his servant
[1:30:32] with
[1:30:46] was he vindicated
[1:30:59] is that always vindication
[1:31:14] when we use the word vindicated
[1:31:18] we have to be careful
[1:31:20] because god has to check you out
[1:31:23] even as abraham
[1:31:24] had to pass his final test
[1:31:28] final test
[1:31:29] amen and then
[1:31:31] it was said to him
[1:31:33] your seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:31:35] enemies
[1:31:37] these are great things to reflect on
[1:31:38] let's give god a big hallelujah a man
[1:31:41] god bless you online amen i want to go
[1:31:44] into here now
[1:31:46] jesus
[1:31:47] the day
[1:31:49] john baptized him
[1:31:52] god vindicated him
[1:31:56] amen the dove came down
[1:31:59] he didn't do that
[1:32:01] god did that
[1:32:03] god spoke from heaven
[1:32:06] john saw him coming
[1:32:08] in the form of a dove
[1:32:21] immediately
[1:32:23] anointed with god
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:36] one of these days you shall become god
[1:32:38] man
[1:32:47] so when this vindication happens
[1:32:50] it's a very
[1:32:52] great uh it's a very great signal
[1:32:56] that god is approving of you
[1:33:00] confirming
[1:33:02] amen amen
[1:33:04] another example
[1:33:06] the greatest ministry of them all
[1:33:11] had had seen jesus
[1:33:13] in a pile of fire
[1:33:15] and commissioned him
[1:33:18] to do what he done
[1:33:20] paul
[1:33:33] who could question paul
[1:33:48] we have to appropriate ourselves
[1:33:52] to the ministry of paul
[1:33:54] that is our template
[1:33:56] that's what we are watching
[1:33:58] but now let me come to another
[1:34:01] hallelujah
[1:34:02] i go to this slide with the greatest of
[1:34:04] pleasure
[1:34:06] what about our day
[1:34:09] what about our day
[1:34:11] church
[1:34:12] let me tell you
[1:34:14] it will be a prophet
[1:34:43] a vindicated message hallelujah
[1:34:47] i am so glad everybody
[1:34:49] i'm so glad
[1:34:51] to be one of them
[1:34:53] to be identified
[1:34:55] and this message
[1:34:56] has rapturing faith in it
[1:35:11] because this man because
[1:35:14] because this man
[1:35:17] will of necessity
[1:35:20] have
[1:35:21] the capstone prophetic ministry
[1:35:26] a
[1:35:33] this man
[1:35:35] will have the capstone prophetic
[1:35:37] minister minister
[1:35:38] because he is one to introduce
[1:35:53] but god will show him then he said he's
[1:35:56] here
[1:35:57] now
[1:35:58] i take every spirit under my control
[1:36:01] praise be to god
[1:36:03] god will speak for him
[1:36:06] by the voice
[1:36:08] of the science senior praise be to god
[1:36:11] i give god praise
[1:36:13] to to know these things
[1:36:16] and to know what it what vindication
[1:36:18] really really means
[1:36:21] amen god is real
[1:36:23] and he's got this capsule prophetic
[1:36:25] message
[1:36:26] and when love projects
[1:36:29] because grace just takes over
[1:36:32] you can't even explain it
[1:36:34] if love can project
[1:36:36] that's
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:32] amen coming down there to complete
[1:37:35] everything
[1:37:36] praise be to god
[1:37:38] what can we say to these things
[1:37:40] he says now listen to brother branham
[1:37:42] i've said
[1:37:44] some things
[1:37:46] that might have been kind of strange
[1:37:49] this is the seven seal here
[1:37:51] he admits
[1:37:53] you know some things he said
[1:37:55] kind of strength
[1:37:57] the prophet
[1:37:59] he says look
[1:38:01] some things
[1:38:02] might have been strange to some people
[1:38:05] sorry
[1:38:06] it might have been strange
[1:38:09] but
[1:38:10] when god comes around
[1:38:12] behind it
[1:38:14] and vindicated
[1:38:16] and says it is the truth
[1:38:18] then that is god's word
[1:38:21] and then it goes into those uh the seven
[1:38:23] consecutive thunders
[1:38:26] and the mystery
[1:38:28] laying behind
[1:38:29] those seven consecutive thunders rolling
[1:38:32] out
[1:38:35] this is how the seven seal was broken
[1:38:38] hey man and here i love this
[1:38:40] he admits
[1:38:42] it's uh what uh kind of strength
[1:38:45] but it's vindicated
[1:38:47] and we give god glory
[1:38:49] it will happen by itself
[1:38:51] praise be to god
[1:38:53] because they are the thunders of jesus
[1:38:55] praise be to god i want you to notice
[1:38:58] here
[1:38:58] the holy spirit today
[1:39:01] the manifestation
[1:39:03] of the holy spirit
[1:39:05] is that angel sit on amen
[1:39:09] is that angel oh
[1:39:16] because
[1:39:17] the holy spirit
[1:39:18] will only vindicate
[1:39:21] the world
[1:39:23] hallelujah can you say amen
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:52] that doesn't matter
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:35] come back to the world
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:38] it reminds me of a little poor boy
[1:40:41] his name was william
[1:40:43] his daddy had no money
[1:40:46] he said son
[1:40:47] go to the city
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:41:15] and you tell me anybody who doesn't know
[1:41:17] colgate
[1:41:19] and when he when he got blessed
[1:41:22] he started to pay twenty percent
[1:41:25] and even more but i won't scare you hey
[1:41:26] man
[1:41:28] he he was blessed
[1:41:30] when you
[1:41:43] when that which is perfect is coming
[1:41:48] shall be done
[1:41:50] so all these things jumping up and down
[1:41:53] trying to talk in tongues
[1:41:55] all these other things
[1:41:57] when that which is perfect is come
[1:42:01] and we do have
[1:42:04] today
[1:42:05] by god's help
[1:42:08] the perfect
[1:42:09] interpretation
[1:42:12] of the word
[1:42:40] that we
[1:42:42] amen the perfect interpretation
[1:42:45] of the word
[1:42:47] with divine vindication
[1:42:49] my god
[1:42:50] i i just love these things
[1:42:52] and i give god the glory
[1:42:54] to
[1:43:07] is his very victory
[1:43:11] and the reason of his death is some more
[1:43:13] amen oh my see
[1:43:15] death not in the spirit
[1:43:17] but but he know he said his spirit went
[1:43:20] to hell and preached
[1:43:22] appreciate it now quicken you know if
[1:43:24] the same spirit
[1:43:26] that rose christ from the dead
[1:43:28] dwells in you
[1:43:29] it shall quicken
[1:43:32] he's flesh
[1:43:34] and that's the word
[1:43:35] and now here it comes to it
