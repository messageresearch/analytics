Lord we thank you for your presence we thank you for the opportunity to be in the house of the Lord today and we know that what you've prepared for us will be a blessing we ask that you bless the reading of the scriptures and the program today in your name we pray amen and amen amen hallelujah amen we want to we want to Dive Right In so we want to read from the Old Testament from 2 Kings chapter 4 now they cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bor men and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid had not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in Thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats so we're going to Dive Right In and just just to lay a a little background this story is All About a financial turnaround and the Widow would have been distressed and financially decapitated because of the debt of her loved one her husband and in this particular story we see where it is that she may have lacked like the economic value value in the household and she would have borrowed accumulated debt and she would have borrowed for liabilities and accumulated debt and would have ended up in a financial situation a financial circumstance now this story and there was there wasn't a name that was said of this particular woman of this particular Widow neither of the prophet and I believe that there's a lot of lessons that that we could learn from the story because it's not necessarily about the name or or specifically who it was but I believe that there's Great Value in the story because from society today they paint some pictures and they focus on certain things which in the same case could cause us to be under distress Financial decapit reputation they focus so much on security and having a job in today's society that one little mishap could spiral a downturn so we want to just tune in and Dive Right In to a couple things that would enable us to see what the prophet the man of God who dealt with her would have been able to instruct her on right so so just by the way there's one there's a formula for poverty which we can note from this particular story and the formula for for poverty in this particular story is borrow to buy liabilities and how do we know that she would have bought um like liabilities or the family had bought liabilities because when Elisha ask her tell me what has th in the house she didn't have anything that was remaining from what the funds were used for so it's a lesson to learn that if there's something that's priced here but we borrow to buy it but it no longer has value and that is something that you keep on doing then there'll be an increasing gap between what you owe and what it is that you have right so and just also for context we would see that the poverty that is stated in this particular passage is also someone who is dependent on the graciousness of someone else somebody who is dependent on the system or dependent on the generosity of someone else right so now in this passage here there's a seven-point plan that the Prophet would have given her to be able to turn around her debt right but just before that I want to just talk about don't sell your sons right and it's something that is in this passage here and just in case that you didn't know there was a law back then where if it is that you could not have paid debt that your family was in the fine print so your family paid a price where it is that they were taken to be Bond men to be slaves until what that debt was was actually repaid right or until the year of um like Jubilee when everything else was returned to its owner right so and when I'm talking about don't sell your sons we have to acknowledge also that in this particular passage when she said that the Creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be born men that actually meant that the debt would have been settled if it is that she would have allow that to happen so the debt would have been cancelled in that case right so in this particular passage it spoke about your literal Sons but I want to talk about your metaphoric Sons as well right so we normally talk about your children are your future but we we are talking about your future so don't sell your sons means don't sell your future don't sell your destiny don't sell your dreams don't sell your legacy because all those are things that actually impact you in the future and sometimes we may not we may not go too deep into it but there's tradeoffs that actually happen on the financial level so for example you may buy a shoes a phone sneakers and you don't know know exactly what it is is the is the cost that is being given up in the future now I'm not saying don't get me wrong I'm not saying that we don't need these things and you don't need a shoes and a phone and so on but I'm saying that these things are supposed to be measured within where the budget is and not necessarily have a impact in your future and the reason that I'm saying this is because the devil is not coming unless he's coming to steal to kill and destroy and what it is that he could steal and kill and destroy and what he wants to steal and kill and destroy is your future is your dreams is your destiny it's your legacy because if it is that and I know that you all see it in today's world if you feel like your destiny has been crippled then you feel like you don't have that much to live for and we see that that is pervasive of the culture that we're in today and what the devil wants you to think is that it's all doom and gloom and there's nothing for you to to feel cheerful about and for you to feel bright about and for you to feel positive about and when we read the Bible it's for us to to to remind us that we are here for a purpose that our our purpose on this Earth is also intentional it's strategic it's meaningful it's for a season and we don't want to give the devil the power to be able to impact our future and impact our dreams so we need to be able to protect it so hence the reason that I say don't sell your sons meaning we need to be conscious of the transactions we doing now that will actually impact us in the future amen right so I also want to talk about I want to talk about the difference between the hand out versus a hand up right so just in case that you missed it when the Widow would have said would have given that passage thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be Bond men what she was looking for was a handout at that point in time she was looking for assistance right and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and the reason that it's phrased like that what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house it means you are looking outward when you should be looking inward amen so I'm just going to talk a little bit about the difference between the hand out versus a hand up and also we we saw it where Peter and John was coming out of the temple at um I believe is at the gate called beautiful and there was the beggar on the road and he was also looking for a handout right and instead Peter was in the position to say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give it unto thee rise up and walk and he grab him and pull him up right so we want to be able to know what's the difference between a hand out and a hand up because the prophet in this particular story was not willing to give a hand out because a hand out sometimes could be help that actually hurt somebody because it's it it may not solve the problem it's not going to solve the problem so he was there and about to give a hand up so a handout might feed you for a day but a hand up it feeds you for life a handout means instant I'm like gratification to deal with the instant need but a handout positions you to be able to grow to get Knowledge and Skills and insight and wisdom a handout enables you to be able to purchase liabilities and spend in the present but a handup enables you to be able to invest and plan for the future amen I mean we also saw it in the children of God that was coming out of Egypt right in the wilderness they got Mana which was a hand out but God had already positioned them to enter into the promised land the land of flowing with milk and honey which would have been a hand up now of course they would have had to use their resources and work and apply themselves but that was a hand out a hand up sorry that would position them and give them to be able to build and have a legacy amen so God's plan is always going to be a plan to empower you to be stronger to be better to be wiser it's always going to be to give you a hand up and not a hand out God wants you to be sustainable and not dependent and some people keep praying for handouts instead of hand ups and what may start as a prayer God wants to be able to give you a plan amen so we want to look at this seven-point plan which the prophet of God would have given to the Widow and it starts with first of all he said what shall I do for thee right tell me what hast thou in the house so step one is to look within so you need to be able to take a personal audit of where it is that you are at take a personal audit of your skills of your resources of what it is that you have and there's so much persons and I see it like this sometimes you may have a pond you may have the fishing rod but somebody's walking with a fish in their hand and it looks appealing but you have the resources that you need to get you to way it is that you need to go right so conduct a personal assessment on what you possess don't get distracted by what others have and reason being is that we're all fearfully and wonderfully made and what that means is that everybody has their own unique purpose there is nobody else in the history of the world who will ever be like you and and possess what it is that you possess right and something you already have from God is the key to everything else that God has promised you because again he has given you the seeds that you need as Jehovah Gyra as your provider he has not left you without anything right so he has given you the seeds for your Redemption for your economic like Redemption so that first step is why are you looking outwards when you have something inside now we're going to move on to step two step two is to recognize the seed potential of what you possess and it's also calling some business cases the principle of recognition now this is where she said thine handmaid had not anything in the house save a pot of oil now everything else would have abandoned her at that point in time but the oil was faithful so the oil could have looked left could have looked right and say listen now there's nothing here standing with me but I'm here and you start your you're saying by saying thine handmade had not anything in the house but I stand here big and B right the oil so sometimes we take for granted and we undermine the things that we are very familiar with so she may have been familiar with the oil that was there so in her mind listen is is nothing in the house and that is a natural law that we see so for example there might be people who live by the beach they don't they don't have the type of reverence for the beach like the people who not by the beach anytime somebody who not accustom being by the beach City the beach woo look the water look how the sun look this thing they want to touch your water so on and so the people who Liv in next to the beach same old you know similarly there's people who have you have a fancy fruit in your yard you have a nice mango or whatever that it is but because you accustomed with it it no longer feels like it's special right somebody might see it and be like you have that in your yard all this time like you play in so so much time the oil and whatever that we have that we might be familiar with it becomes overlooked it becomes unappreciated it becomes unutilized it becomes taken for granted it becomes undervalued and in this particular passage what we're being shown here is what we might take for granted someone else will find valuable amen so you have something and just like in Matthew 25 he that ha much will be given and from he who doesn't have what little that he have will be taken away the principle is if you call your something nothing if you call your something nothing then it becomes nothing but if you call your nothing something it could become something amen and don't allow the perceive value of others to influence your lack of recognition of the seed potential so for examp example somebody who is not gifted equally as you or may not reverence the skill that you have they may not have a value for what it is that you have but move past that right don't allow somebody else to Benchmark the value of what it is that you have right so somebody might say hey well I could do this I could do this but you could only make bake right or I could I could I could make a nice burger sandwich and whatnot and stuff but you could only make juice don't let anybody make your something feel like nothing that you put that image of nothing on it right and by recognizing the seed what you need to to understand most importantly is that a seed is a harvest that is compressed yes so in the seed there is Harvest and there's multiple Harvest right so understand that there's seed potential and recognize that so that you could call what might be perceived as nothing you could call it something and then you could make something out of it and it's all about the the perspective of it right amen so on to step three step three is is borrow vessels right and there's a lot that we could get from that borrow vessels even empty vessels so borrow and there's a lot to be able to learn here borrow speaks to the relational type of currency that she would have had because what that meant is that she needed to go and interact with her neighbors in fact if I read it it's said borrow vessels of all thy neighbors and it speaks to we need to be able to live such a Christian Life that we have relational value with everybody that we interact with right some may be more valuable than some but it still needs to be relational value so for example your neighbor supposed to be able to watch you and be able to tell that you're a Christian right so some persons if it is that we know the situation we say hey well go and borrow from your neighbor well what did happen was about 5 years ago the dog had come through the hole and because of that I end up picking up a stone I Pelt it over there I miss the dog but it break the window since then we never talk right but in this particular situation here it she still had relational value and she would have operated in such a way that she would have been able to maintain relationships right and she would not have have operated like a beggar right so persons would have been able to relate with her situation and say hey she's a Christian she's probably just having a a tough time but it's a neighbor it's a family amen so in Proverbs 19:7 it says all the Brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him and it means that if you operate in such a way in a certain way there's a way that would actually run friends away from you and it meant that she didn't operate like that and it's also a lesson for us that even if we are down to nothing we still want to maintain as much relational value as we could so not because you are going through a rough and a tough time time mean that you can't tell your neighbor good morning you can't say God bless you you can't say hey I hope that I really have a good day I really looking forward for you to be blessed and so on those kind words and sometimes you even get that I even get that from people who not in church they don't go to church but hey thanks so much for checking up on me I hope you and the family good and so on and so on and so on and those little things become so valuable because I say but wait now I don't get up so so so but so just just to show you as well there's Proverbs 112 So I actually went into this because yes it's borrow vessels and most times we talk about the principles of borrowing but we didn't talk about the principle of that relational value so Proverbs 11:12 says he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace so somebody who's void of wisdom somebody who doesn't understand and might be very very foolish will quarrel and have that that hatred there right but somebody who who basically understands he's going to see how it is that he could quell any any dispute because that my neighbor I living I living next to him I don't want bottles to be pelt in over and so on and stuff like that so there's a principle to be learned here which is always grow your network of friends and it's really hard for you to live a Christian Life if it is that you are unable to display a Christian testimony amen so there's another one here Proverbs 18:24 it says a man that had friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticked closer than a brother so what that means is that if you have friends you need to be friendly to continue having friends and then there's friends who would even who would even come closer than your family Circle could ever bring so so some people who might say hey well that is my family and that my family and D my family and they limit themselves to the small circle they're missing out on other relational value because there are friends who will present themselves closer than a brother and it was here in the Bible I didn't put it in so build your relational currency right so now we want to talk about the vessels right vessels are containers right so vessels are containers and we could go really deep into this and when it says borrow vessels even empty vessels we talking about multiple different containers different shapes different sizes uniquely designed because a family of five or six may need a differ size vessel than a family of two or three right and empty vessels sometimes seemingly lacking in value but holds infinite potential right empty vessels seemingly lacking value but holds infinite potential and basically to every coin there's two signs and you never eat a one-sided piece of bread yet right every Everything has two sides to it so somebody might say well it's empty so it's worthless but the other end of it is that it's empty so it can be filled up full of potential right so it could be filled up with purpose it could be filled up with Solutions it can be filled up with value amen so we talk about it could be the same contents but in different containers so for example sometimes someone may write a book and then they take the book they turn it into a movie they take the movie they turn it into a play they take the play they turn it into a series they take the series they turn it into into a kids version book book series and what they do is the same story they able to package it and repackage it and repackage it and and repackage it into different containers into different vessels right so the concept is one the relational value we understand what borrowing means and we talking about the actual vessels the containers now we're going to move on to step four which is not a few right and I basically I love this because I believe that everybody's limited by how they could open their mind and expose their mind right so you are limited by your mindset right so not a few instructing her not a few is basically you want to be able to get past that mindset of dealing with the present dealing with the now because if you give anybody a chance to deal with their situation they will deal with today they will say listen I really need to dos now to buy a loaf of bread and this and that and this they not thinking about tomorrow they're not thinking about next week they're not thinking about next month they're not thinking about next year they're not thinking about about Beyond themselves they're not thinking about the brother the sister the family the uncle the whoever and so on they're not thinking about the children they're not thinking about the children's children they're not thinking about the Legacy because they may have a limited perspective so the not a few means that you would be limited by home how much that you are able to borrow you are a you are limited by the number of containers imagine imagine that you could real make juice and you make a big bucket of juice but you only have two cups so you could only sell two cups or you only have two bottles so you could only sell two bottles well you didn't plan and you didn't think big enough because when you start to add sugar and fruits and so on you should have realized wait now I should always over prepare right and the point is prepare for the abundance and have the faith and the expectation so not a few means that God is willing to do more for you than you think than you could perceive so you need to continually expand your capacity continually expand your thinking there's so borrowing too few vessels means that you are limiting God to what it is that you think that he could provide amen and you need to be able to to quell small thinking because what it limits is the big outcomes and the big um like Miracles that God has in store for you so we going good so step five step five is shut the door and po shut the door and po so one shut the door and Pa and I want to deal with shut the door first it speaks about Focus right so you're not able to focus unless you're able to shut out outside voices negativity and so on and stuff like that it speaks about purp um focus but two it also talks about something in business which is that business always has a secret part of it a secret I'm like component of it right so for example if it is a look at KFC they will say the secret is the 21 herbs and spices or I think is I'm like 11 herbs and and and spices now they may front that as their secret that may not be the only secret they may have supply chain Secrets different things in terms of structure and franchising secrets and so on and stuff like that but just think about it like this if I was to sell pineapple on the road and I'm saying and I come out every morning and I say $30 a pineapple everybody find that it's a good deal and then I come to tell everybody well how I does really do it for that great price is that 6:00 in the evening the day before a guy does pass right here selling it for $10 so is only a matter of days before I out of business because everybody will go and collect it for $10 you understand so there's always a secret part of the business and this is also true of processes right so most persons they always see the finish line and the glitz and the Glamour and so on they see the Sportsman who successful and so on they don't see the process right and seeds grow grow beneath the soil seeds grow beneath the soil so you can't see how the seed is developing and when it bursts out and when it is that it starts to be able to grow you begin to see when it is that you see it flowering and you see the fruits and so on and stuff like that so it speaks to protecting the process because no one could could have known that it was Miracle Oil because if it kept flowing and flowing and the door is open and somebody saying wa is a is a oil rig inside of there you just pumping oil Ting Ting and then you turn around and you say all right well I'm going and put them up for sale just now $150 a container you're going to be like but why does they going charge me for something that flowing like that you understand so shut the door and PAW so the poor speaks to the action and like The Obedience and your faith grows through the action and pouring res also reflects that word pour in reflects blessings right so being able to practice that that process and basically with this shut the door and Pa on the action it also meant that the Miracle Oil that didn't run out had the potential to fill every vessel in the world but it was limited to the vessels that she had right so we on step five live and we're going to because we talking about shut the da and po I just want to pause to just talk about the oil a little bit right about the mystery of the oil and of course we're talking metaphorically we talking um about the passage and the parable and so on so what represents the oil because the oil stayed and the oil did not leave and one of the lessons that we could learn from it is that material things may come and go but there's other things that would not leave you right so so your expertise and your skills I'm like the experience that you have in your job environment your passion for something like your enthusiasm your um like your empathy how you could relate with certain situations because you may have had the situations your insights your personal Proverbs your knowledge your life lessons these are things that are unique to you that stay with you and they can be a Lifeline onto others so for example if it is that you know how to make juice that skill not going to leave you that is oil right now somebody now needs to convince you that other persons who can't make juice will find your juice valuable right so your network your contacts all those things are also oil metaphoric oil right and if it's poured into the right containers so if knowledge is poured into books and courses and events and the presentations and so on these could become different containers that they're in and it could be taken for granted planted but it is oil that could be valuable to others and there's something that I always say about about the Grain and the corn I'm like in Egypt and some people would think that Joseph Joseph could have gave and so on but then it moves I'm like we're moving on to step six and step six is to sell the oil so step six is to sell the oil so she came and she told the man of God and he said go sell the oil so imagine this you went through the process and you obeyed so you obeyed you went in you shut the door with you and your sons you poured the oil so on the table is oil on the gr is oil on the bed is oil in the porches oil all over is oil and and the prophet is saying to go and sell the oil so what this means is that unless you learn how to uncover the value of your oil which is to Market and to sell the oil you could have oil and still be broke so your testimony can't [Music] help it can't help somebody who doesn't see right it can't help somebody who doesn't who isn't able to see the value of it right and selling the oil means also that blessings are distributed as well through relationships as well as interactions so it means that you can't sell the oil in a bubble and you not talking to anybody and the and some and people just going to show up and pass money for the oil it meant that you needed to go and uncover the value of this is it could be used for cooking it could be used in this it could be used for fuel it could be used for this and so on and stuff like that so imagine imagine she may have borrowed containers from the neighbors and some of those same persons she would have been able to go back to and say hey and the person say well that look like my container know but she could say well it was empty but now it full so I'll give you a discount just because it's your is your container but it's valuable stuff inside of here so some of these same persons that she may have borrowed from she would have been able to go and sell because they would have been able to find that a full vessel with oil is way more valuable than an empty vessel right amen so you have the ability to help a business grow to help people become fit and healthy to help families to stay together to Mentor somebody to train somebody to be able to impact somebody um somebody's mental health to be able to impact somebody's lifestyle and that blessing that you'll get from being able to do that from being able to serve others is is what you will be able to get as notes of thanks because what what the finances really is based on and they don't teach you anything about this in school they just brush everything over but but money is normally paid for Value created in others it's not for Value created for yourself it's value that is created for others so the reason that a business would pay you is because you create a certain amount of value for the business for them and your salary is a reflection of that so so most most persons just feel it it it just falls from the sky they don't understand the value that is being created right so the oil one sold could meet the needs of others and there's this um there's this scripture that I Al always quote from Proverbs he that withh holdeth the cor the people shall curse him but bless sin shall be upon the head of him that sth it him that sth what the corn the corn that could sustain somebody so what happen is that if something is not sold there's no value that is that is communicated for it so just like how they say where where your treasure is there your heart will be I'm like also and beauty is in the eye of the beholder well unless there is value that is is communicated for the corn or for the oil or whatever that you have no one will be able to know the significance of it unless there's a price for it and and that is exactly why um there was a message a while back where it is that we were reading that David paid for the stuff that was offered to him free because he he didn't want to give sacrifice something that cost him nothing because something that costs you nothing becomes not valuable and I always reference to persons that that for example you work hard and you're going on you do this you're going on you purchase X it holds a significant you go and you buy something for $10,000 it holds a significant amount of value for you because you would have been able to validate the price tag behind it right you would have worked and you would have been able to pay for it but the person who comes along snatched that and gone with it they didn't pay the price the cost and so on so that is why in crime you have somebody could take a $10,000 thing and they will they will run around the corner and say hey if I get 500 for this now I good because there's no price that was paid for it so for example um and I don't mean to go here but there's people who believe that the best things in life are free and that that is the furthest thing from the truth right the best thing in life that's free is salvation and God's word and and he paid a price for it right so everything has a price and a cost and sometimes you may not see it sometimes you may not notice it because it might appear free to you but it actually cost somebody else and one thing that we have to be conscious of is that that we're only going to be able to open our eyes and our lens a certain way so for example the person who is wired to see free and to see hand out they miss seeing the hand up they miss seeing that I can develop the skills and the knowledge and and apply it unto myself and be self- sustained and not just provide for meing now but provide for myself in the future so we move on to step seven so step seven is pay your debt and live on the rest pay your debt and live under rest so step seven speaks to financial discipline now it may have been in the past that the distress and and like the devastation in that household would have been from Financial indiscipline but the prophet is saying this is how to be able to structure it don't go and say listener I could not have afforded it before but I really needed to have a vacation and I was thinking about a cruise and now with all this new found money this this is word in due season and now get my breakthrough here I need to take my cruise I will deal with that after the thing is that you need to address the issues as soon as you can so Financial discipline in this case speaks to Breaking the cycle and the curse of negative debt and and the devastation and the impact that it would have had right so don't go buy a car don't go on a vacation don't go and buy a cell phone deal with the debt first then live on the rest it says you and your sons live on the rest meaning that within your means live on the rest meaning that it could provide her with a lifetime of Revenue once they are able to live within their means so it means that from now on instead of being being indiscipline we need to focus on financial Intelligence being commercially sophis tigated living within your means and being able to have the financial disciplines to address the critical issues and you need to be able to to write and list and say all right this is this is number one to be able to deal with number two number three and the issue is when the funds come don't go and rearrange that and go and put something above and so on and say listen I really needed this rest I need to make a I need to make a um like a Tobago trip I really needed a a shopping spree right because that will not address the need the issue that put you there still needs to be solved and we don't want you to be five months down the road you're looking for a handout when it is that we already gave you a hand up amen so you feeling fine so far right so you need to balance your priorities and debt symbol izes bondage and repayment represents Liberation and freedom so you want to be able to position that now yes she would have borrowed from vessels from her neighbors and so on but in this case it was borrowed to be able to package the oil the assets that would have been able to be sold right so it's a life lesson for us to be able to understand understand that we don't want to be in the poverty cycle of borrowing for liabilities we want to be able to borrow for something that will that will enable us to be able to to accelerate and leverage blessings that could come out of being able to sell and grow our business amen so this whole Passage has so much nuggets to learn from it and it's all about that Financial turnaround and understanding that there's so much more value so much more value to what it is that you are um that you do to how God would have made you and that you are unique that you are blessed and that you need to be able to focus and not all the time that you're looking for hey well what if it is at our own only had the help it would have solved XYZ right well in this case it was what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house which means that in you and in us are all the seeds that we need to be able to to do everything that God has promised unto us to be able for us to be able to access all our promises right right and I just I really trust that I was able to bring out this story in a financial capacity that you all are able to see how quickly that you all may may be able to assess and look out for that handup and begin to see things in a different lens right that we could we could have that mindset that we don't just want enough but we are in a position to validate that God is God and he could perform a miracle that is beyond our our dreams that is beyond the expectations so he doesn't want us programmed to just be living today for today when it is that he is more than able to be able to supply your weeks need your month's need your year needs your legacy your children's children and that's why it says a good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children so there's there's a there's a inherent nobility and and righteousness to thinking ahead and I know that I would have quoted the scripture in one of the sessions before that the the wise man foresee it evil and avoids it right so we need to be able to position ourselves in a place where it is that we can live such Christian lives that we could we could maintain relational values that we are able to be able to turn things around and not when things collapse and this is something that I see all right sometimes yes things might be a little shaky certain places of your life but that is not a reason for you to close the door on everybody else that mean that don't mean that you don't have oil that could be valuable to some somebody else but some people they close the door and they say listen I don't want anybody to know that I having a hard time so instead of saying good morning and hello and how are you and hey I hope that I having a good day they're walking straight because because they because they don't want somebody to ask them well how I'm like well how it is are you going well in this story here we see how valuable that it is for you to grow a network of friends for you to have a testimony that persons would maintain relational value with you to be able to be kind to be able to be a good neighbor and and so on Amen so thank you and I hope that this was a great session for you all as the last session for this year of things pertaining to life and to Godliness I trust that that some of the things from this session that you will share it like with others and that it might be able to impact their life and leave them in a positive light right let's stand and sing a song and give God some glory amen amen let's put our hands together this evening praise God you appreciate about Andrew over in praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus amen and amen You Are God Alone from Before Time began amen what a session this evening amen you feel like you've been edified you know one of my favorite Parts I think was um shut the door shut the door and po yeah I like that part a lot and um you know there's a process to things to getting things done you know and God wants to give you the secrets to to be able to get Victory and to maintain your Victory and to get more Victory you know and it comes out of a process you know and sometimes we don't value that enough you know you know um things are so easy to get now you know and um everything we wear right now everything we have around us went through a process to get it you know the clothes you wear and the shoes you have on your feet someone put that together someone stitched it glued it stuck it made it it went through a a conveyor belt a process to get it to your front front door um you know but we live in such a world where we don't really uh appreciate this these things everything is a dime a dozen but there once was a time ago when things weren't so easily acquired you know and um the process to get to things um was a bit more appreciated because it took a lot of effort and time now things are mass-produced uh but even the cell phone you use went through a testing phase before it came into your hand they couldn't just give you a cell phone you had to make sure it work somebody had to run it make sure the hard drive work make sure the processor work so the thing is we have to be tested also and tried we have to be proven to be the right kind of people and God will give us pass us through processes to strengthen us and give us that oil and we all have to discover what our oil is and so I just pray this evening that it was really a blessing we certainly thank you so much again brother andreid amen and I just pray that the holy spirit will continue to deal with us and help us to grow to show us what our oil is and what our value is and what we could give what we could do for for others and for the Lord that we could be a blessing wherever we go amen let's just praise God as we lift our hands and sing Oh You Are
