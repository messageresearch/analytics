[48:06] Amen god bless you welcome it's good to
[48:09] be here
[48:09] let's go into the word Amen we have
[48:13] three portion of scripture this morning
[48:15] one from first John chapter five you
[48:18] wanna read from verse water eat we also
[48:23] know they got first John chapter two
[48:25] fifteen to seventeen and also Hebrews
[48:29] eleven was five and six readin first
[48:35] John chapter 5 was four
[48:43] for whosoever is born of God overcometh
[48:47] the world and this is a victory that
[48:50] overcometh the world even our faith who
[48:54] is he that overcometh the world but he
[48:55] that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
[48:57] God this is he that came by water and
[49:01] blood even Jesus Christ not by water
[49:03] only but by water and blood and it is
[49:08] the spirit that beareth witness because
[49:12] the Spirit is truth for their tree that
[49:18] bear record in heaven the father the
[49:20] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[49:23] are one and they are treated bear
[49:25] witness in earth the spirit the water
[49:29] and these three agree in one one about
[49:35] first John chapter 2 1 I read from verse
[49:38] 15
[49:39] it reads love not the world neither
[49:43] teens that are in the world
[49:45] If any man love the world the love of
[49:48] the father is not in him for all that is
[49:51] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[49:53] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[49:56] is not of the Father but is of the world
[49:58] and the world passeth away and the lust
[50:02] thereof but he's a do it the will of God
[50:07] our last scriptures of Hebrews 11 and
[50:09] this one verse 5 and it reads by feet
[50:13] Enoch was translated that he should not
[50:17] see death and was not found because God
[50:20] had translated him for before his
[50:23] translation he had this testimony that
[50:25] he pleased God our doubt feet is
[50:29] impossible to please him for he that
[50:31] cometh to God must believe that he is
[50:33] that he is a rewarder of them that
[50:36] diligently seek Him let's pray one more
[50:38] time father we thank you for your word
[50:39] Lord you know that chopped up to a word
[50:42] some things here and you just you could
[50:44] put it together father take me out of
[50:46] the way and me a spirit flow upon your
[50:48] woman and quickly to your people in
[50:49] Jesus and I ask it email him and you may
[50:52] be seated
[50:52] praise God tons for coming this morning
[51:01] you wouldn't want to come to church and
[51:03] preach the empty benches so you make the
[51:05] effort to come and I pray that God
[51:07] richly reward you and bless you for
[51:09] coming out this morning I want to read
[51:17] first John 2:15 to 17 and the amplified
[51:20] before he continued it says here do not
[51:24] love or cherish the world or the teens
[51:26] that are in the world if anyone loves
[51:28] the world love for the father is not in
[51:31] him for all that is in the world the
[51:35] lust of the flesh craving for sensual
[51:37] gratification the lust of the eyes
[51:40] greedy
[51:41] longings of the mind and the pride of
[51:44] life assurance in one owns resources or
[51:49] in the stability of Dibley teens these
[51:53] do not come from the father but above
[51:55] the world itself and the world passes
[51:59] away and disappears and with it the
[52:04] forbidden Cravens the passionate desires
[52:06] the lust of it and he who does the will
[52:09] of God and carries out his purpose and
[52:11] life abides and remains forever
[52:15] isn't that something Savva title this
[52:18] morning faith is the victory that
[52:21] overcomes the world as a title this
[52:24] morning faith is the victory that
[52:26] overcomes the world I have a subject of
[52:28] being born again by the incorruptible
[52:30] seed of the word of God another team
[52:36] it's the truth because God said so once
[52:39] God said it it's the truth
[52:41] and this scripture this are being born
[52:44] again of the incorruptible seed of the
[52:45] will of God that came from first Peter
[52:47] chapter 1 was trying to say it's eating
[52:49] you're purified your souls in obeying
[52:52] the truth see truth is no gesture here
[52:55] but truth has to be obeyed or bathe
[52:59] obeying the truth through the spirit
[53:01] under unfaith love of the Brethren see
[53:04] that you love one another with a pure
[53:06] heart fervently being born again not of
[53:10] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[53:13] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[53:17] for ever and then Peter give this
[53:19] reference for all flesh is as grass and
[53:21] all the glory of man as the flower of
[53:25] the grass what happens after a while the
[53:28] grass withereth the flower fallen away
[53:32] but the word of the Lord endures forever
[53:35] and this is the word which by the gospel
[53:38] is preached unto you so just as grass
[53:41] just a fade away and the flower fall off
[53:43] so the glory of man and all the luster
[53:45] of will not feel you're gonna fall off
[53:47] one day
[53:48] isn't that right all right my my my
[53:53] ready for the word this morning get a
[53:56] wonderful provision and on Friday which
[53:59] entire church was there and there's
[54:01] telling the believers that your prayer
[54:03] even stands beyond death if somebody
[54:08] dies doesn't stop their prayer that's a
[54:10] powerful tortimer
[54:12] hallelujah just think about it now so I
[54:15] was saying you don't know some
[54:16] grandmother might have prayed for you
[54:18] and nothing grandmother or grandfather
[54:20] might even be wrong right now but their
[54:22] prayer was held before God
[54:24] the diam going on but that pristine
[54:26] before God written for you to vote for
[54:29] answer that pray on your meal before you
[54:32] can't stop ring for your children your
[54:33] family your loved one you can't stop
[54:35] that because your prayers in living
[54:37] before God your prayer is the important
[54:40] a fire rocket see a prayer he could hear
[54:43] your prayer your prayer going to be
[54:45] answer don't stop brilliant because you
[54:48] feel this and you're not seeing it no

[54:52] whether it's crotchy where a I don't
[54:54] feel like Kevin no keep on playin go
[54:58] read a board our share a norm that when
[55:01] Isaac put the blessing upon Jacob and
[55:04] Jacob taught was Esau and the blessing
[55:08] went upon a Jake Jacob and when Esau
[55:14] came he said I only saw father said but
[55:20] I put he blessing on that other son
[55:22] already watch this he couldn't take it
[55:24] back
[55:26] he couldn't cancel it he couldn't undo
[55:29] it
[55:30] Oh hallelujah he had to take what remain
[55:33] because it already banged his mouth oh
[55:36] boy that's how powerful it is
[55:39] hallelujah and one more one more
[55:42] when Abraham told Abimelech that Sarah
[55:45] was his sister which was a lie
[55:47] oh it was trying to cheat in a way but
[55:49] but it wasn't the truth Godfrey's every
[55:52] woman that house we man come to Abram
[55:55] and simply go to me that or come and
[55:58] warn a man in a dream don't touch demo
[55:59] interfere my servant wife the man said
[56:03] in Munson Ellie sister he said I come to
[56:06] talk to you about and your Bible said
[56:11] that Abraham prayed for God to Brit that
[56:15] thing off of that house and good answer
[56:18] it by one so I want to show you
[56:20] something here Abram was not responsible
[56:22] for freezing the rooms in the house but
[56:25] he was responsible to pray
[56:27] to take this atmosphere I want to show
[56:31] important you are if ever I'm didn't
[56:34] where God couldn't do nothing for them I
[56:39] wanna see understand even I'm not to pay
[56:44] for that to be lifted over Abimelech in
[56:47] these homes and the Bible said they were
[56:49] all healed because you are that's
[56:58] important repairs but you let a picture
[57:01] that's so important it is my hallelujah
[57:06] so let's get on into the word this
[57:08] morning question answers question you
[57:14] said a person could live so close to God
[57:16] that he could not sin while he on it
[57:19] then explain first John 1 8 to 10 so but
[57:25] I'm gonna read first John 1 into 10 and
[57:27] the Bible says if we say we have no sin
[57:29] we deceive ourselves on the truth is not
[57:31] in us if we confess our sins he is
[57:34] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[57:36] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[57:37] if we say we have not sinned we make him
[57:40] a liar under will done enough well nor
[57:42] with my wit my dear brother just turn
[57:45] right over to the to chapter the 9 verse
[57:48] you write on the same page in mind I but
[57:50] it was to begin with and then we're I'm
[57:53] gonna read he that committeth sin is of
[57:56] the devil for the devil sin from the
[57:58] beginning for the purpose the Son of God
[58:01] was made manifest that he might destroy
[58:03] the works of the devil just what I've
[58:06] been talking about God predestination
[58:08] knowing you we shall ever adizero
[58:11] scripture whosoever is born of God does
[58:14] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[58:19] him and he cannot sin because he's been
[58:22] born of God that's just that's just what
[58:26] the way it says now if you watch here if
[58:29] we say we have not sinned we make him a
[58:30] liar and the word is not enough now some
[58:33] people say well now here is just a good
[58:35] attagirl
[58:36] or good little boy they never said to
[58:38] begin with you are belong in sin you are
[58:41] certain iniquity you come to the race
[58:43] speaking lands so when you are born in
[58:46] this world you are a liar you are a
[58:49] teeth you know everything there is just
[58:51] all this sin not a teeth but you have a
[58:54] story you are not a liar because you are
[58:57] not a leader that the Spirit is in you
[58:59] when you are born because you are in the
[59:02] world and that's the reason you can't
[59:05] have Reformation you have got to die and
[59:08] be born you cannot have birth without
[59:11] reflection on the line that you cannot
[59:14] have without conviction you can't have a
[59:18] resurrection you must be crucified to
[59:20] the things of the world in order to be
[59:22] resurrected in price so if you are going
[59:25] to depend upon your intellect or
[59:26] conception you will never be born of the
[59:29] Spirit of God you got to forget my pole
[59:31] did all you have a node I know nothing
[59:34] except Christ Jesus and be born anew see
[59:38] it's a bait that makes you a new
[59:41] creation the very greek word here itself
[59:45] it means creation you are a new creation
[59:49] there's a worthier creature is the word
[59:52] creation you are new creation not of the
[59:54] world but in Christ Jesus us in the
[59:58] world you know fancy things fine clothes
[1:00:00] put it wrong eyes to a girl
[1:00:02] wavy here for the boy you know and
[1:00:04] something another to attract attention
[1:00:06] or lustful or drinking the Bible said if
[1:00:09] you love the world and until the world
[1:00:10] the love of God's not even you so in
[1:00:13] order to get that out of you you have to
[1:00:16] die you have to be crucified buried and
[1:00:20] resurrected a new creation in Christ
[1:00:23] Jesus
[1:00:24] now this is the truth because God said
[1:00:28] so this is the word say Amen somebody
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:32] so therefore you will receive the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost before you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:38] you are believing unto eternal life but
[1:00:42] you do not have eternal life
[1:00:44] until you receive the Holy Ghost course
[1:00:46] it is eternal eyes
[1:00:48] the Holy Ghost is God it is God's life
[1:00:51] in you then you've got eternal eyes do
[1:00:55] you understand it now you are believing
[1:00:57] onto it it's a good thing you were men
[1:01:00] excusing for this if it sounds too flat
[1:01:02] but still a baby isn't born if you cheat
[1:01:06] that baby right and follow the rules of
[1:01:08] nature that baby will be born normal
[1:01:10] but if you don't apply everything to the
[1:01:11] rules of nature I'm going to hide
[1:01:13] bruised or hit it's going to ruin you
[1:01:15] it's killed Italy before it's born but
[1:01:17] that's the matter the bruises come from
[1:01:19] Satan and Satan takes the poison that's
[1:01:21] of hill and try to bruise the church
[1:01:24] that's in travail with a baby before
[1:01:28] it's ever born they kill it but if you
[1:01:32] just take the Bible and meet it give the
[1:01:35] baby food the mother taking vitamins and
[1:01:38] this is the best vitamins I know of it
[1:01:40] builds you up though the church ought to
[1:01:43] be taking spiritual vitamins and the
[1:01:44] vitamins is right here a whole book full
[1:01:46] of them
[1:01:47] praise God and that little fellow he's
[1:01:49] got life and the little cells are moving
[1:01:52] and kicking after about three months and
[1:01:54] four he is kicking and moving but he is
[1:01:57] in pornea that means the babies in the
[1:02:00] womb but the baby hasn't been born as
[1:02:03] yet it had life at kicking but it's not
[1:02:06] born yet let's continue but as soon as
[1:02:09] he's brought into the world the doctor
[1:02:11] holds him up give him a spankin and Wow
[1:02:13] there he goes he starts breathing and
[1:02:16] just as soon as he breathes the breath
[1:02:17] of life then he becomes a living soul
[1:02:19] and that's the thing sometimes you
[1:02:23] receive you are ready to receive the
[1:02:26] Holy Ghost you ain't reveal you are
[1:02:28] wanting to be delivered how many here in
[1:02:30] that right now wanting the baptism
[1:02:33] of the Holy Ghost really want to know
[1:02:35] what it is and you want to get into it
[1:02:37] who wants the bathroom only goes raising
[1:02:40] hands he said you are in travail you are
[1:02:43] wanting to be delivered
[1:02:44] could you imagine wanting to be
[1:02:47] delivered because you are pregnant with
[1:02:50] child you are pregnant with God
[1:02:52] hallelujah burrito God Amen and what you
[1:02:59] need is a little gospel spank
[1:03:00] sometime on your skin for dory
[1:03:02] I know you think I'm crazy but we have
[1:03:05] the minor cracks which is craziness to
[1:03:08] the world
[1:03:09] Alleluia let's continue but a Branham if
[1:03:12] possible for person to be lost and end
[1:03:16] up in hell if he rejects the light of
[1:03:20] the word even though he has a genuine
[1:03:22] experience of justification and
[1:03:24] salvation yes sir that's exactly right
[1:03:27] when you use the expression that if we
[1:03:31] do not believe the word we will be
[1:03:33] eternally separated from Christ do you
[1:03:36] mean the fullest version will live
[1:03:37] eternally but they will be separated it
[1:03:39] from New Jerusalem the Christ will dwell
[1:03:41] with the bride here those who do not
[1:03:43] have the Holy Spirit born again as the
[1:03:45] Scripture speaks of be born again if the
[1:03:47] natural built requires water blood and
[1:03:50] spirit does not the spiritual but
[1:03:52] requires all three stages of Greece
[1:03:55] before a person is truly born again
[1:03:57] absolutely doesn't do any message about
[1:04:02] any profit of only rapture they not what
[1:04:04] being taught him he said absolutely the
[1:04:07] three stages are required no be get into
[1:04:09] something just bear with me and I
[1:04:11] explained this morning on the same thing
[1:04:14] you've got to have all stitches you are
[1:04:17] begotten of the spirit just like a baby
[1:04:21] is begotten in the womb of a mother but
[1:04:25] not born until they receive the Holy
[1:04:28] Ghost that's right
[1:04:29] you are born then you are not converted
[1:04:33] you are in the process of being
[1:04:35] converted until that time and then he
[1:04:38] went on some deep stuff that's the
[1:04:41] reason all these great mysteries could
[1:04:45] not be given colita could not be given
[1:04:48] to wesley could not be given to the heir
[1:04:51] just pass us by the pedicles r8y it
[1:04:54] wasn't time they will be glutton Oh
[1:04:58] hallelujah praise God so that man the
[1:05:01] pen Acosta was telling the womb so God
[1:05:04] didn't bring mysteries to them because
[1:05:06] it was still inside the womb but brother
[1:05:08] Branham came to introduce the person of
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ which is the fullness of
[1:05:12] the world
[1:05:13] and you will be born by that word the
[1:05:16] incorruptible world God take his word
[1:05:19] and pack it up and wrap it up as a seed
[1:05:21] to be preached and that's what being
[1:05:24] preached to you and then the secret
[1:05:26] comes about the wood is in the black
[1:05:28] hallelujah
[1:05:29] Oh God mystery wrapped up in a seed and
[1:05:32] he slipped a seed inside of you and
[1:05:34] they'd ever try to do anything about it
[1:05:36] or glory the public or the secret is out
[1:05:39] your room is already closed you can't
[1:05:42] get pregnant for somebody else or Korena
[1:05:46] clogged a woman's sealed up let the Word
[1:05:48] of God
[1:05:49] Oh hallelujah diddly that where is the
[1:05:54] name of the Lord he said it couldn't
[1:05:56] come before now hallelujah praise God
[1:06:00] so this person of the Holy Ghost is what
[1:06:04] Balram came to introduce us to
[1:06:05] hallelujah the person of God which is
[1:06:08] the word of God isn't that right Lester
[1:06:10] beat him of the Lord let's continue now
[1:06:14] watch it will come to a head in the last
[1:06:17] days that it would be this the seed of
[1:06:20] God and the mark of the beast to
[1:06:22] spiritual powers working together and
[1:06:24] anyone knows that the seal of God is the
[1:06:26] blood right the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:29] Ghost Ephesians 4 titty see see is not
[1:06:33] just stating a statement honor it have a
[1:06:34] scripture to back up what you're saying
[1:06:37] so it knows a scriptural voice that is
[1:06:39] speaking to you
[1:06:40] Ephesians 4 today grieve not the Holy
[1:06:42] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:06:45] till the day of your redemption when
[1:06:48] they were born again they were filled
[1:06:49] with the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:51] the new but we know that you are big
[1:06:54] Clutton of the Spirit I'll admit that
[1:06:56] but until you are born dancer baby is
[1:06:59] the gotten in the mother's womb that's
[1:07:00] got a kind of a life it's a life little
[1:07:04] cells in the body twisting and kicking
[1:07:06] and jumping but when it is born it has a
[1:07:09] squeal and they become a living soul so
[1:07:12] he's saying the room lies and the
[1:07:14] outside life is two different life
[1:07:18] so that's why you said a new hot tub
[1:07:20] will give you a new spirit I will give
[1:07:22] you Alan leave it then I put my spirit
[1:07:24] in your spirit or glory to God you

[1:07:29] churches they believe in church I go
[1:07:31] I'll do this I'm good I want to do right
[1:07:33] I want to do right but what Annie's a
[1:07:34] gospel spunk to wake it up the screen is
[1:07:37] eternal life and the Holy Smoke screams
[1:07:40] in it like it never screamed before and
[1:07:43] then become a new creature so you in
[1:07:46] your flesh you come to church a mother

[1:08:13] everything else because you were born in

[1:41:18] for people want to talk to be change
[1:41:19] online are some things in this is gold
[1:41:22] this is gold just polishing it up
[1:41:25] when Zion travailed sheep or for
[1:41:28] children you have to be tore up it's the
[1:41:30] atmosphere of anything you get all wrong
[1:41:33] with its arguments you get into that
[1:41:35] type of atmosphere if there's something
[1:41:36] in a church someone is someone who is
[1:41:38] disobedient very ugly act in the church
[1:41:40] and course in trouble you will never be
[1:41:43] able to have a revival as long as that
[1:41:46] kind of a pleasure is all wrong
[1:41:49] so the troublemakers either get out of
[1:41:52] trouble or they get out because because

[1:45:58] and Pentecost they win one man on one
[1:45:59] Accord so going after root all the rocks
[1:46:02] a doof in and I want to tell you I think
[1:46:10] our people has relied too much on
[1:46:11] education and theology and so forth and
[1:46:14] as elected takes the spirit please see
[1:46:18] so right now and it has always but I
[1:46:20] mean how do you get these educated bunch
[1:46:23] of message people who sat down for
[1:46:24] 40-plus years here in here and to get
[1:46:27] activated without crying this huge
[1:46:29] chance how do you get that chance for
[1:46:31] them because they are custom here and
[1:46:33] they want to hear message they come to
[1:46:36] hear words they come to connect with
[1:46:39] dots tick tick off what must I do
[1:46:41] what must I be active and doing to bring
[1:46:43] a result because this is what you need
[1:46:45] to know they're not coming to here for
[1:46:48] information you're coming to get
[1:46:50] inspiration to know what you want to do
[1:46:51] about this thing because if you

[1:46:56] and your prayers that wasted even if
[1:46:58] you're dead is not wasted your dropping
[1:46:59] prayer you're losing your prayer then

[1:47:10] and you try your prayer out your comment
[1:47:11] on expectation because you are prayed
[1:47:13] and you come to see your prayer

[2:03:23] not for me I know when your anchor them
[2:03:26] emails and says so be it it's not to be
[2:03:27] something for you so this is the truth
[2:03:30] because God said so he said the Bible
[2:03:33] said that we can overcome the world and
[2:03:34] how do we do it not by keeping with
[2:03:37] faction of the world but the Bible said
[2:03:38] that faith is the victory that overcomes
[2:03:41] the world hallelujah
[2:03:43] and when Daniel was taken to Babylon
[2:03:45] though he was going away from his home
[2:03:46] he was going to have to be a slave to
[2:03:48] another nation of people but Daniel
[2:03:50] purposed in his heart no matter what is
[2:03:52] a him he wasn't going to defile himself
[2:03:54] with the Babylonian sin oh if we had
[2:03:57] more gallant men like

[2:04:29] here to make claims you come here to get

[2:16:18] that cannot conquer this world or give
[2:16:21] the Lord a show you need revolution more
[2:16:24] than you think you need to ask for for
[2:16:27] revelation because revelation is fate or
[2:16:30] glory the corners continue
[2:16:33] when you climb into garden by prayer
[2:16:36] until you see the thing conquered under
[2:16:39] you this nothing can hurt you then you
[2:16:41] overcome you got fifty miles of every
[2:16:42] room you're stealing freedom you who
[2:16:45] have been a drunkard and sleeve to
[2:16:46] whiskey you will be a master over
[2:16:48] handling that's what we talking about
[2:16:52] it's the truth because God said so this
[2:16:55] is God speaking here go say you could be
[2:16:57] a master over what has been accomplished
[2:17:00] you can't get by you a master it

[2:17:11] of alcohol that make you drink he's your
[2:17:13] master now but then when you get fit I
[2:17:15] don't make the leafy green fate he's
[2:17:17] yourself antenna Oh hallelujah
[2:17:20] what is fate fate is sometimes revealed
[2:17:24] to you that is not yet what you believe
[2:17:27] it will be it is something that's
[2:17:31] revealed to you that is not yet but you
[2:17:35] believe it will be faith is a revelation
[2:17:37] of the will of God
[2:17:38] Oh hallelujah so it's not ready it's not
[2:17:42] right view and experience but in the
[2:17:45] spirit you are a revelation so Abram
[2:17:47] didn't experience Isaac here a
[2:17:49] revelation of Isaac as I didn't come yet
[2:17:51] it took 25 years to see the fruit of
[2:17:54] that fate it took 25 years for Isaac to
[2:17:57] materialize but he had a fate he had a
[2:18:00] revelation
[2:18:00] yeah he has something in his soul he has
[2:18:04] the experience of Isaac yet but inside
[2:18:06] his spirit is finished because God says
[2:18:09] oh and that's the truth and if God said
[2:18:12] it is the truth God is can't lie it's
[2:18:15] got to come to pass Oh glory no God I've
[2:18:20] got a continuum right then we don't pull

[2:20:37] what is it
[2:20:39] listen what is it it's faith that
[2:20:43] overcomes
[2:20:45] now when they get something out to you
[2:20:47] this is the Prophet that preferred woman
[2:20:48] not once over and over

[2:22:23] what I'm a man when he change of fate
[2:22:25] not in Brahminical Owen but William
[2:22:27] Branham or anybody else but place of

[2:22:30] then she got feet she raised up above
[2:22:32] all the fears and doubts and God healed
[2:22:35] her she overcome faith is the victory
[2:22:38] that overcomes real faith knows no

[2:22:58] but fate knows no defeat it cannot be
[2:23:02] defeated it's the only way you can

[2:38:23] see that eaten nice however I'm gonna
[2:38:28] find out mystic loose off here oh my I
[2:38:32] want to skip something here promises
[2:38:35] that um someone asks a question who is
[2:38:38] just great Jehovah where did it begin
[2:38:40] he had no beginning your favor God and
[2:38:43] eternity is one complete Sigler has no
[2:38:45] end no there's a real true spirit of
[2:38:49] love there's a real true spirit of
[2:38:52] loyalty
[2:38:52] there's a retu spirit of honesty and I
[2:38:55] know but that is God the very fountain
[2:38:58] he said let us close our eyes to our
[2:39:01] imaginations for a few moments and go
[2:39:03] back before there was anything the great
[2:39:06] function of all eternity was that spirit
[2:39:08] of love joy spirit of honesty speed of
[2:39:11] trueness in this perfection then out of
[2:39:14] the existence of the Father when the
[2:39:16] logos which was the son which was a
[2:39:19] tyranny which was the body of the great
[2:39:21] Jehovah God when fought in a celestial
[2:39:24] body that's the logos the word spoke out
[2:39:27] of them great fountains of life and
[2:39:30] they're the theophany which was God made
[2:39:33] into wood then that theophany was made
[2:39:36] flesh in the person of Christ Jesus then
[2:39:39] all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in
[2:39:41] him father son Holy Spirit all that and
[2:39:43] that's the very way we go plumb back to
[2:39:46] the original beginning of God dear we
[2:39:49] are born again not a flesh born again
[2:39:52] not of blood but born again by the
[2:39:55] spirit and in that eternal spirit of
[2:39:58] love and honesty comes down to make its
[2:40:00] place in us
[2:40:02] then when we die from this life we go
[2:40:04] into the body which is the rhetoric we
[2:40:07] resolve we have a teen often II into one
[2:40:09] a celestial body then I the comment of
[2:40:12] the Lord Jesus this body is picked up
[2:40:14] from the eat again and made into a
[2:40:15] glorified state the live in his presence
[2:40:17] forever then all perfusion all the
[2:40:20] things that was in profusion pulls out
[2:40:22] of existence
[2:40:23] flesh goes into punishment he'll open up
[2:40:26] a moat and swallows it all the evil and
[2:40:27] pollution and God and his beloved church
[2:40:30] his bride takes the stand for the
[2:40:33] eternity to rule on Jer is the great
[2:40:36] hope of the Christian Church David said
[2:40:38] all that love and kindness is better
[2:40:40] than life no life everybody wants to
[2:40:42] think of life life the world life has a
[2:40:45] perforated expected because that's even
[2:40:47] life itself have a perverted expect
[2:40:49] maintain people refer to life as having
[2:40:52] a big time
[2:40:52] drinking and going on this is life on
[2:40:55] the other day just this week here four

[2:41:00] fell under my moon up the car and I was
[2:41:02] wondering first thing when I heard any

[2:41:05] where they were coming from when I

[2:41:19] should be in church they shall be no
[2:41:22] service see oh my so look at him this

[2:41:36] same God get it not three people in the
[2:41:38] beginning was the same he was the Great
[2:41:40] Spirit I'm gonna wrap up fountain we all
[2:41:43] Tunis everything that was pure was in
[2:41:45] this fountain and it became to form into
[2:41:48] a buddy at E - E the kind of body that
[2:41:51] we go to not a glorified body but an
[2:41:54] angelic body that has shape and form and
[2:41:58] every time I see a tree the tree is the
[2:42:00] negative there's a positive somewhere if
[2:42:03] I see a man listen I see a lovely little
[2:42:06] couple man and his wife music on please
[2:42:09] walking down the streets we dance
[2:42:11] together what does it reflect there is
[2:42:13] one in heaven
[2:42:14] we'll never perish if this earthly
[2:42:17] Tomica be reserved we have one already
[2:42:19] waitin at Eeyore phanie hallelujah let's
[2:42:23] continue this ray of light that when
[2:42:25] thought was a ray of love that's the
[2:42:27] main one the next color was blue and
[2:42:29] blue his trueness next was other colors
[2:42:32] too the seven perfect colors which is
[2:42:33] seven spirits of God that went from that
[2:42:36] great fountain that great fountain and
[2:42:38] diamond Jesus spoke about this whole big
[2:42:40] rainbow had become into a tea or phanie
[2:42:43] hallelujah so the fixed function of love
[2:42:46] project Iranian border the rain were
[2:42:49] becomes a tea offer me and made the
[2:42:51] image of a man he wasn't a man he did
[2:42:53] enough flesh he was a tea or free and
[2:42:56] more they said I would like to see you
[2:42:57] and God hid him in the rock but when he
[2:43:00] passed by Moses said I'd look at the
[2:43:02] back part of a man that would come to
[2:43:05] pass and one day when a man was sitting
[2:43:07] in his tent God came to him in a body of
[2:43:10] flesh we will find him here meet an
[2:43:13] Abraham before that in the order of
[2:43:15] Melchizedek a body of flesh which was
[2:43:18] God he was gold in the flesh then put a
[2:43:21] Branham why would he have to come back
[2:43:23] and be born he wasn't born then he was
[2:43:27] just created a body that he dwells in
[2:43:30] Melchizedek the king of Salem which is
[2:43:33] the king of Jerusalem which is the king
[2:43:34] of peace had neither father nor mother
[2:43:36] beginner days or end of life Jesus had
[2:43:39] both father and mother big enough tears
[2:43:40] an end of life but he was made after the
[2:43:42] order of Melchizedek no mezack was God
[2:43:45] himself
[2:43:46] myrcella's like was Jehovah God the same
[2:43:48] one that met Abraham years later I see
[2:43:50] why this eerie laugh walked up with
[2:43:52] Abraham and he says Abraham I'll tell
[2:43:56] you what I'm on my road to do we'll pick
[2:43:57] it up tonight
[2:43:58] dong-yi and Sodom and do all what he is
[2:44:00] gonna do and as soon as he blessed
[2:44:02] Abraham he went back into space again a
[2:44:05] man that took dear a dust on his clothes
[2:44:08] a man and only that but he eat the flesh
[2:44:10] of a calf of Abram kill drink the milk
[2:44:12] from the cow eat some kicks and butt on
[2:44:15] it and turn back into tyranny again what
[2:44:19] was it why did he take em he had never
[2:44:22] been born like you and I but he had to
[2:44:24] be born in the flesh so he could hold
[2:44:26] that stinger
[2:44:29] you're casting in the theophany so the
[2:44:33] word became flesh
[2:44:34] the team would miss the dead so when
[2:44:39] Jesus ticked at he free us from that so
[2:44:44] portal come after said that where is his
[2:44:46] thing because Jesus took the sting of
[2:44:48] the debt or chlorine a copy knowing whom
[2:44:51] we have believed hallelujah
[2:44:55] he had me born the first we could hold a
[2:44:57] stinger that was a created body
[2:44:59] that was a body just pulled the cat's
[2:45:01] calcium and potential to the earth and
