first Corinthians 12 verses 11 to 14 otto's amen amen I put the poem tauros tauros thank God could you before the finishing of the world had a three for mystery that restate one's there because the Bible said Pascal ability but in the days of the voice over seventh in jail when he shall begin to sound the commercial survive solely the mystery of God and Estelle to do she'll be finished and he explained to us the sounding is when the mistress inside the books economy stepped on the written mistress inside the book is they are finished the mystery of God mr. God is his paeans his nature that you all about him how he lives how God behaves himself or Joseph Abboud if God were living in your neighborhood this mystery of God shows you how you would behave himself if he was in your situation even God went to your school or you went to your job how he would leave how you would behave himself the mystery of God would be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and when this mystery of God is finished then the seven angel really to sound out his message and you know Malakoff was message it's real message you were sent with a commission from God to get a bride ready for Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the mystery of God Malachi 4 is a 3/4 mystery that was sealed in hidden cash on the back pass for God's mind remember now the Bible is a book of symbols so when he's talking about the bad parts of what's mine on future you'll want to understand what God is talking about walk your path and this is not in the open this is in the back you have to come out of the house to see what's in the back it's a secret so sick thing on the back pass before God's mind this was we're gonna heat this three four mysteries only one man survives prefer William Branham was given the job so go beyond the beginning page on Genesis point to the man of God only one man Islam was given the job beyond the pages of the right straight into the back of God's mind and have the secret sent down to him by the Prophet secret meaning sensing to you and I his message from the back of the Bible his message that's gonna take you back to where you come from because you'll come from God you are going butter products now that is more than just a catchphrase that is more than just words because if you know such a know that you

home and continue from where Adam now and he fell by sin there be new heavens and a new earth a new Jerusalem hallelujah [Music] so Friday night what we try to do room amen and was to show you what was in air or him because many times we say God morning took in the Christ that was in God what was in God and we say God what are Christ put into the bride looking feast all that was in the in Christ what was in Christ Laurie you are so Friday night don't try to show you a man all that was in doubt you think it don't you amen and to show you your connection with that we try to show you order know if you want to know about God we're gonna go beyond Genesis 1 and go way back before the foundation where God dwell alone now surely himself so we went to just a quick recap she's a quick recap we won before the beginning where Elohim was into the thinking Wade was thoughts before I became words weights of letters it's all in his mind it is great to channel mine before the foundations of the world and that was wherever he laid the faith of God was there that's where your seeds palette is origins from that's where you come from that's where you began flow I want you to notice this morning I have nothing to do in this matter salvation whistling this totally of the Lord the beginning the river and he said I am Alpha and Omega should have nothing in between you know the frost between between [Music] [Music] [Applause] in the beginning of the world into the [Music] Son of God the Son of God that's why you are the worlds were formed the quad the woods were farmers - mind you iris hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'm the number three after the beginning and that's the book of life from Genesis to Revelation Oh glory to God hallelujah so Friday night we trace your origins there sit on this out of you your connection with God whoever your father natural father mother is to you that's the physical path that's the freshman we don't preach the flesh man picture the man the seat of God monsters or they said of you and the cgc more if it's not you're born it's gonna be pond today before you leave these mittens because he that is born of God does not commit sin politician he cannot seal the Popish because the seal of God the most that you have enough in him she remains the seat of God remains when all your friends go away with all your energy goes away when you are so chic you can hardly move Amazo when you are so discouraged given our the correlation you because the cedar cost fuel reason he got neck sharp just a shoe what a quid god we say hallelujah ha our cup when I have to cut up so don't be worried by me amen glory amen so Elohim Elohim we should you couldn't see the face sad of you get on the roof on the City of God on the inside of you the of faith C Mon squat on faith what melaka for said his narrow hems desire dizzy the line you are Elohim desire that's why you cannot fail it's impossible for him to fail they just loved you to sample it just not use that's all they loved you whose I'm a because of what you did no to before you even come here so just thank him for his thank you for his long amen so in your faith seed ASIMO is Elohim desire to Louisville or put on your spiritual thinking caps now because when you understand these things like whether Connie was here's there my mother always spoke last night when you understand these things sure will understand the need why you must understand the need there are seven birth pains seven bridge to shake you tore up here mental blast you took a few back into the image of Jesus Christ so you're my trophy desire to have a son drop it it is image on the face of the earth till the 21st century and you will not fail if I swing because I brought all of it said there's nothing wrong with the seed there may be a lot wrong with the freshman because there is nothing wrong with the seed of Somoza and we come here you get a church every Sunday for your pastures to preach to you then I'll pick you the fresh man zap into the seed which is the mind [Music] in the expression it will body of fresh avocados share and man became a living soul before an Adam he became an amateur God as the father of human race as the hospital II as the first amateur on the face of the earth your seed come to maturity and you will attract female LLM society low even for you who are in your place in the body of Christ he might be the food expression fresh fish is desired he for you-know-who when the sea is full manifest what that was what was an Elohim Elohim he was and it still is let's watch him point into Jesus Christ bodied into the loggers because the loggers became Jesus crowd because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth Alleluia Lori recording we can hear is the order Elohim it's my natural spirit I'm conscious I'm going back and forth because it's because of a lack of understanding of these things that we have our nice brothers what misguided things that's wrong that's for putting their private interpretation to the Scriptures the scriptures say the scriptures of no prophet the interpretation was flow with what has already been revealed it must dovetail Genesis perfect Genesis again not go to ten on one court comparing spiritual things with spiritual so are some conscious I'm Cindy's over and over again natural spirit to end up all alone with his thoughts dwelling all alone with his thoughts no one existed him but if it was his attributes before the beginning and then in the beginning we are crossing that that the space now before the beginning and in the beginning I want to watch whatever import into Christ oh so you'll understand what Christ is gonna pause the brides are leepu's or so the beginning and see oh come on small arrow him on mafia and mathy we know that what don't we change this mask from air or him from spirit to the loggers which is the word in the beginning so in the beginning hello him on more fitting to the loggers when he poured all of himself all that he was although we were talking about the II wanna play to a putty pour some in there no reported by spirits spoken words hello he was spirit and the spirit speaks and his words his words the spirit became the word the power analogy became the law [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was going to be the Son of God so prefer the beginning comes my father beginning palatable small represents your soul because the seeds in your soul is originally from the father beginning did you hear me [Applause] [Applause] in the spirit on your feet like a son of God already went through this before because when the [Applause] but notice I want I wanted to see something you've got your room a cake it shows so your human spirit but gets represented in the beginning oh come on small and then ya know after the beginning of a locum is your flesh crochet so your soul your soul job every man has it so that's what differentiates our system the animal kingdom you are your money man that's all lamb is where we have a consciousness of God so these are subconscious beings about the tsukushi the source is your spiritual heart support each other but not every man has a seed in the soul is a Muslim every man has a space and if which is the soul but you who in your spirit see similar from God if you because your soul represent further beginning Paula Thomas More [Applause] rather foolish virgins the vs fondly another seed of God knows that you they're gonna get saved he's also a they're gonna take a chance otherwise throne judgment or about them they're sure they have a soul supermodel and they have a space in their soul to receive a see just one simple but because they are not the seed of God they have not sit there nobody simple but there's a space yes I can receive the water can respond to the world that's why penico shows [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] for the serpent seed they have a soul whose house is so but the serpent seed Sivaji sir has no space in their souls to receive a seat you will survive sim that's why this happens seat doesn't care one beat this is a path the Word of God so forget it I know the devil trouble some of you are you are serpent seed how could you be sup into the world all this happen sees the body like Esau common a man like him like Hitler Mussolini here nothing about the water God it was that of Esau it
