[44:16] heavenly father lord we are so grateful

[44:20] lord to be in your presence to feel the
[44:23] anointing
[44:25] to know that the angel of the lord is
[44:27] here this morning
[44:29] fixing things around for the coming of
[44:30] the lord
[44:32] lord we see the cry of the people and
[44:34] the
[44:35] lord the desire of the people and the
[44:38] hunger of the people
[44:39] the thirst of the people the desperation
[44:43] lord of the people to break past the
[44:45] limitations of this world and this life
[44:48] and the cares of this life and
[44:50] lord the deceptions and the distractions
[44:52] and the
[44:53] obstacles and the situations lord that
[44:56] lord the bible describes could so easily
[44:59] be set us lord and
[45:00] lord we are so grateful to be in the
[45:02] land of the living that we could come
[45:04] to this house this morning lord to bring
[45:06] our sacrifice unto you lord
[45:09] lord there's nothing that we could do to
[45:11] deserve what you have done for us
[45:13] lord but your grace and your love and
[45:15] your mercy
[45:16] lord is bigger than our problem your
[45:18] grace your love and your mercy
[45:20] is bigger than our pain your grace your
[45:22] love and mercy
[45:23] is bigger than our situations your grace
[45:26] your love and mercy
[45:27] is bigger than every challenge and trial
[45:30] and test and
[45:31] we pray this morning that you would
[45:33] speak to your church you would speak to
[45:35] your people
[45:36] lord take me out of the way and lord
[45:39] father may this
[45:40] be a service that we will never forget
[45:42] we committed
[45:44] into your hands in the precious theme of
[45:45] jesus christ and the church says
[45:49] amen you appreciate the song silvers
[45:51] this morning
[45:53] you appreciate uh brother anthony and
[45:56] the musicians
[45:58] amen you appreciate your pastor this
[46:00] morning the service
[46:02] last sunday and how god has been
[46:05] unfolding to us
[46:08] amen so
[46:11] certainly a great privilege and honor to
[46:13] be in the house of god this morning and
[46:14] to
[46:15] be able to just exhort you this morning
[46:17] by the grace of god
[46:19] and uh we look to see what god will do
[46:21] for us this morning
[46:23] so if you have your bibles would you
[46:25] turn with me to one portion of scripture
[46:32] reading from philippians three
[46:43] and reading from verse 8
[46:49] philippians 3 and verse 8
[46:54] ye doubtless without a doubt
[46:57] and i count all things but loss
[47:01] for the excellency of the knowledge
[47:05] of christ jesus my lord
[47:10] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[47:12] things
[47:16] paul is counting it an honor
[47:19] to suffer the loss of all things
[47:23] and do count them but dung that i may
[47:25] win
[47:26] christ and be found
[47:30] in him i want to take that slowly be
[47:34] found in
[47:35] him not just in church but in him
[47:40] not just in the message but in him
[47:43] not having mine own righteousness
[47:47] which is of the law so paul is saying
[47:50] here that the
[47:51] law could only bring him to a certain
[47:54] level of righteousness and he could
[47:56] he could speak of his own but he said
[47:57] this is not what i'm talking about here
[47:59] not mine own righteousness which is of
[48:01] the law
[48:02] so he's given credit to what the law was
[48:04] able to achieve but
[48:05] he's now beginning to push beyond the
[48:07] law and beyond his own righteousness but
[48:09] that which is true the fate of christ
[48:12] so he is separating the righteousness
[48:14] that comes from the law
[48:16] with the righteousness that comes
[48:17] through the fate of christ
[48:19] and he clarifies it the righteousness of
[48:22] god
[48:22] by faith that i may know him
[48:26] and the power of his resurrection and
[48:29] the fellowship of his sufferings
[48:32] that is just too much to bear the
[48:33] fellowship of his sufferings
[48:35] to enter into his sufferings to feel his
[48:39] sufferings to
[48:41] talk about his sufferings to understand
[48:43] his sufferings being made conformable
[48:46] unto that if by any means i might attain
[48:50] unto the resurrection of the dead not as
[48:53] though i had already attained in other
[48:54] words
[48:55] when you look at me don't count me
[48:56] having anything either
[48:58] were already perfect but i follow after
[49:01] if that i may
[49:02] apprehend that for which also i am
[49:05] apprehended of christ jesus brethren
[49:09] i count not myself to have apprehended
[49:12] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[49:16] things which are behind
[49:18] and reaching forth unto those things
[49:20] which are before
[49:21] i press toward the mark for the prize
[49:24] of the high calling of god in christ
[49:26] jesus may the lord
[49:28] had a blessing to the reading of his
[49:29] word you may be seated this morning in
[49:32] the presence of the lord
[49:33] and it's certainly good to be in the
[49:35] house of the lord this morning
[49:38] to be able to enter into his gates with
[49:40] thanksgiving
[49:41] enter into his courts with praise be
[49:44] able to
[49:44] separate from the the the fears of
[49:48] life and to put god in his place keep
[49:51] him in his place which is first in our
[49:52] lives first
[49:54] you know affairs first in our
[49:56] transactions first
[49:57] in our conversations first in our
[49:59] deliberations first
[50:01] in our homes first on our jobs first in
[50:04] our families first
[50:05] when we have to face the doctor first
[50:07] when we have to pay the bill
[50:08] first when we have to approach anything
[50:10] we want to put god
[50:12] first we want to acknowledge him in all
[50:15] our ways we want to be sure that what we
[50:18] are doing is pleasing unto him we want
[50:20] to be sure
[50:21] that what we are doing is honoring him
[50:23] we want to know that
[50:24] he is satisfied that he is pleased we
[50:27] spend so much effort trying to please
[50:29] people we please our bosses
[50:31] we please the neighbor we please all
[50:33] kinds of different things but
[50:35] it is so important to please god that is
[50:37] the most
[50:38] important person that we have to please
[50:40] and we want to be reminded of these
[50:42] things it may seem simplistic
[50:44] but it is ever important that we please
[50:47] god if it's
[50:48] one person i want to satisfy this
[50:50] morning is the lord jesus christ whether
[50:52] you're on your feet or you're clapping
[50:54] or you're shouting that's secondary
[50:56] to me being sure that i'm pleasing him
[50:59] i'm not here to please anybody this
[51:01] morning but
[51:02] him and if he is pleased with you and if
[51:05] he is pleased with me
[51:07] then he promised to do something about
[51:09] it because he even when jesus was there
[51:11] he said this is my
[51:12] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and
[51:15] we want to please god we
[51:17] want to be genuine christians we want to
[51:19] be genuine daughters we want to be
[51:22] genuine sons we want to be genuine
[51:24] believers we want to
[51:27] amen so you may be seated so this
[51:30] morning i kind of want to talk to you a
[51:32] little bit
[51:32] i have a burden on my heart and the lord
[51:35] kind of been dealing with me and it's
[51:37] something else when
[51:38] you know you may be trying to you know
[51:40] think of something you want to share
[51:41] with the church
[51:43] but it's very different when the law
[51:44] just drops something that you know is
[51:46] from him and for the people for that
[51:48] particular point in time
[51:50] so this morning i was up early and then
[51:53] this just dropped down
[51:54] and i have to follow what this leading
[51:56] is
[51:58] you know and uh it's been a burden of
[52:00] mine for some time as i've watched
[52:03] and i've sort of hinted it for some time
[52:06] that
[52:06] a lot of people have gotten casual
[52:12] a lot of people have taken things for
[52:14] granted
[52:17] they take church for granted they take
[52:19] preaching for granted they take
[52:21] prayer meetings for granted they take
[52:23] the internet connection for granted
[52:25] they take life for granted
[52:29] they live life in such a way that they
[52:32] believe that tomorrow is promised to
[52:33] them
[52:35] that's how much for granted they take it
[52:37] they take their understanding for
[52:39] granted
[52:40] they take their knowledge for granted
[52:43] and one of the
[52:44] deepest truths you will ever come to
[52:46] know is that you do not know what you do
[52:48] not know
[52:49] and that is what is scary because when
[52:52] you speak to somebody who has been
[52:53] through some stuff
[52:55] and they say if i know
[52:59] how is it if i would know now what i if
[53:01] i knew then what i know now
[53:03] that's it i would make different
[53:05] decisions
[53:07] they could look back through the passage
[53:08] of time and they could look either with
[53:10] regret or with disappointment and these
[53:12] things because
[53:13] they now have more visibility into how
[53:16] things work
[53:18] if you choose to isolate yourself in the
[53:20] corner somewhere and
[53:22] choose to ignore what's happening around
[53:24] you it doesn't change the fact that
[53:25] change
[53:26] is happening around you you ignoring
[53:29] what's happening doesn't change the fact
[53:30] that it's still happening
[53:32] you turning your back on what is taking
[53:34] a place in the world doesn't change
[53:36] what's taking place in the world
[53:39] anybody with me this morning and so it
[53:42] is we have allowed ourselves to get
[53:43] casual we have allowed
[53:45] ourselves to take things for granted we
[53:47] take bible readings for granted we take
[53:50] the prayer meetings for granted we take
[53:51] for granted that when we wake up in the
[53:53] morning
[53:54] that our lives will unfold a certain way
[53:59] and that kind of really pushed me to how
[54:01] many people will really make it
[54:04] and that's the greatest burden of this
[54:06] whole message and the purpose and what
[54:08] it is designed to achieve it's to
[54:10] pull our people out of this world so
[54:12] that they can make it
[54:15] i want to make sure that we're on the
[54:16] same page with that because church is
[54:18] not the objective
[54:21] even knowing the word is not the
[54:23] objective
[54:24] the objective is to know him
[54:31] so for a title this morning i want to
[54:33] speak on to know him
[54:34] is life
[54:39] to know him is liberty branham said that
[54:41] over and over
[54:42] to know him is life he said not to know
[54:45] the creed his life not to know the
[54:47] doctrine not to know the
[54:49] bible not to know he said not even know
[54:51] about him but to know him
[54:53] is life and the real question is do you
[54:56] know him not
[54:57] not do you know the message or you know
[54:59] the scripture you know the stories or
[55:01] you even believe
[55:02] but to know him is life can the church
[55:05] say man
[55:07] we do so many things without knowing how
[55:10] things will turn out
[55:11] there's so many things we don't know
[55:15] we make deals and not know the outcome
[55:17] we jump in a car
[55:18] not know what was going to happen or
[55:20] what will happen
[55:22] people come to the marriage vows to get
[55:26] married and they don't know if the vows
[55:28] that they are taken will be kept for a
[55:30] lifetime
[55:33] people move from house to house move
[55:35] from area to area to live
[55:37] thinking they're making a better
[55:38] decision or or whatever it is and
[55:40] there's a lot that we make decisions on
[55:43] without having a full knowledge
[55:44] of how it will unfold there's a lot in
[55:47] this world that we don't know
[55:50] you go back a hundred years 200 years
[55:52] they knew less
[55:53] than than we know now there was a time
[55:57] they thought the earth was flat
[55:59] there was a time you thought that the
[56:00] only way to eat food was to light a fire
[56:02] outside but now you have electric stoves
[56:05] and you have microwaves and you have
[56:07] different technologies and the bible
[56:09] says knowledge will increase
[56:11] but the crazy thing is with all of this
[56:13] knowledge and this scientific discovery
[56:15] and the advancement of all these things
[56:17] somehow people can't figure out how to
[56:20] know god
[56:23] they are more books than ever they are
[56:24] more bibles than ever they are more
[56:26] websites they are more theologians they
[56:28] are more analysis
[56:30] than ever but people don't know god
[56:33] they know about god you could go online
[56:36] and search through the prophet's message
[56:37] you could read all kinds of different
[56:38] things
[56:39] but that is not knowing god that is not
[56:41] a personal
[56:42] experience with god and that's what i
[56:44] want to get to this morning
[56:47] do you know him
[56:50] because to know him is life
[56:54] there is a cost for not knowing
[56:58] there's a price for not knowing what you
[57:01] do not know will be used against you
[57:03] that's the world in which we live in
[57:05] today so i want to talk to you a little
[57:07] bit this morning
[57:10] there's a price to not knowing how to be
[57:12] a father
[57:14] there's a cost to not knowing how to be
[57:16] a wife
[57:18] there's a cost to not knowing how to
[57:19] perform in your job what's that cost
[57:21] after a while the boss will say it's
[57:22] time for you to go because you don't
[57:24] know enough
[57:26] it could be that you were there for so
[57:28] long and didn't improve your skills and
[57:30] suddenly you find yourself obsolete
[57:32] because you don't know
[57:35] not knowing could be a problem a big
[57:37] problem
[57:38] not knowing what your children are doing
[57:40] is a problem
[57:43] not knowing what's happening in your
[57:44] house is a problem
[57:47] not knowing what's happening in your own
[57:48] life is a problem
[57:50] can we bring it home this morning there
[57:52] are people here today they don't even
[57:53] know what's going on with them
[57:58] what's happening with you
[58:03] because what you do not know about
[58:04] yourself is the problem
[58:06] when people backslide it doesn't happen
[58:08] overnight sometimes the deaths don't
[58:09] realize that they're getting lower and
[58:11] lower and every week and if you don't
[58:12] know it and you don't realize it you'll
[58:14] find yourself one day
[58:17] separate from god cut off from god come
[58:20] the church
[58:21] say amen there's a cost for not knowing
[58:23] there's a
[58:24] price for not knowing
[58:27] i have some scriptures i'm going to lay
[58:29] a background i'm not going to be too
[58:30] long with you
[58:31] but i want to encourage you this morning
[58:34] because we want to know him
[58:37] many people know the church they know
[58:39] scriptures and and they believe that's
[58:40] enough
[58:42] because any time you do something that's
[58:43] outside the world it shows you don't
[58:45] know him
[58:50] do you know his nature do you know his
[58:53] being
[58:53] do you know his attributes do you know
[58:55] what pleases him
[58:57] do you know what motivates him do you
[58:58] know what draws him nearer to you
[59:00] do you know what he's doing do you
[59:02] understand him do you know him
[59:05] can the church say amen
[59:08] so i want to speak a little bit about
[59:10] knowledge
[59:12] knowing and knowledge and you know we
[59:15] use
[59:15] three omni words to describe god
[59:19] omnipotent as an all-powerful
[59:22] omnipresent meaning he can be everywhere
[59:24] an omniscient
[59:26] and that word omniscient means
[59:28] all-knowing
[59:30] there is nothing he doesn't know he
[59:32] knows the past
[59:33] he knows the present and he knows the
[59:35] future
[59:37] but our minds and the condition that we
[59:39] are in
[59:40] we cannot know all the past we cannot
[59:42] know all the present
[59:43] and we can know all the future the only
[59:46] certain things we can know
[59:48] and only the things that which are
[59:49] revealed to us really belong to us
[59:51] anybody with me this morning but as we
[59:55] begin to live and move from as i was a
[59:57] child i speak as a child and understood
[59:59] as a child i'm talking
[1:00:00] this morning not not preaching yet i put
[1:00:03] away childish things it meant that paul
[1:00:05] was realizing that there was a
[1:00:07] progression that he was going through
[1:00:09] that was moving him from not knowing and
[1:00:11] not understanding and not being able to
[1:00:13] speak
[1:00:13] he said when i was a child i speak as a
[1:00:15] child i
[1:00:16] understood as a child i acted like a
[1:00:18] child but when i became a man
[1:00:20] i put away the childish things in other
[1:00:22] words his understanding was different as
[1:00:24] a man than when he was a child
[1:00:26] his knowledge was different as a man
[1:00:28] than when he was a child his behaviors
[1:00:30] were different as a man
[1:00:31] than us when he was a child anybody with
[1:00:33] me this morning
[1:00:37] so it means that your understanding
[1:00:39] should be increasing your knowledge
[1:00:41] should be increasing
[1:00:42] your wisdom should be increasing your
[1:00:44] revelation should be a great
[1:00:46] increasing your expectation for this
[1:00:49] should be increasing
[1:00:50] your passion should be increasing the
[1:00:52] more you know about god the more you
[1:00:54] love him
[1:00:54] the more you know god the more you
[1:00:56] worship him the more you know god the
[1:00:58] more you pray to him
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:08] there are a lot of things you could
[1:01:09] forget but don't forget god
[1:01:13] you can forget the formula pythagoras
[1:01:15] theorem that's all right
[1:01:16] but don't forget god don't forget him in
[1:01:19] the morning don't forget him in the
[1:01:20] middle of the day don't forget him in
[1:01:22] the night
[1:01:22] don't forget him before you choose the
[1:01:25] response you give back to somebody
[1:01:27] because all these things matter all
[1:01:30] these things are
[1:01:36] important
[1:01:40] when somebody is speaking on behalf of
[1:01:43] somebody else
[1:01:44] you could only do it from a position of
[1:01:45] knowing them
[1:01:53] if i have to speak on behalf of brother
[1:01:54] ovid i cannot do it without
[1:01:56] understanding what he wants
[1:02:00] because if i'm to be in alignment with
[1:02:01] what he wants i have to spend time to
[1:02:03] understand what he wants
[1:02:04] so that i will not leave you in a
[1:02:06] different direction to what he wants
[1:02:08] anybody with me this morning and so too
[1:02:11] with the power
[1:02:12] that is being given to adopt its sons
[1:02:15] these sons must know him well enough
[1:02:18] to do what he wants can the church shame
[1:02:21] and anybody with me this morning
[1:02:24] so i want to start a little bit and
[1:02:25] touch a few scriptures if that's okay
[1:02:26] with you
[1:02:28] we would have done we would have touched
[1:02:29] this before in chronicles here it was
[1:02:32] a young solomon seeing the challenges
[1:02:35] that he was going to face
[1:02:37] seeing the obstacles that he had to deal
[1:02:39] with seeing the challenges that we all
[1:02:41] have to deal with
[1:02:42] he started praying and he said to god
[1:02:44] give me now wisdom and knowledge
[1:02:48] that i may go out and come in before
[1:02:49] these people for who can judge this
[1:02:52] thy people that is so great and god said
[1:02:55] to solomon because this was in thine
[1:02:57] heart
[1:02:58] and thou has not asked riches wealth or
[1:03:01] honor
[1:03:02] nor the life of thy enemies neither yet
[1:03:06] has asked
[1:03:06] long life but has asked wisdom and
[1:03:09] knowledge for thyself
[1:03:11] that thou may has judged my people over
[1:03:13] whom i have made thee king
[1:03:15] wisdom and knowledge is granted unto
[1:03:17] thee and i will give thee riches and
[1:03:19] word and honor
[1:03:21] such as none of the kings have had that
[1:03:23] have been before thee
[1:03:25] neither shall they any after thee have
[1:03:27] the like
[1:03:29] but i want to reach down into the fact
[1:03:31] that solomon knew what to ask for
[1:03:34] he wanted wisdom and he wanted knowledge
[1:03:37] we're building somewhere this morning in
[1:03:40] job 36 verse 3 jobs that i will fetch my
[1:03:44] knowledge from afar
[1:03:45] and will ascribe righteousness to my
[1:03:48] maker in other words i want to get my
[1:03:50] knowledge from
[1:03:51] from not the textbooks of this world not
[1:03:53] from the professors of this world not
[1:03:55] from the
[1:03:55] school teachers of this world but i want
[1:03:57] to know how to live i want to know how
[1:03:59] to act i want to know god's
[1:04:00] thoughts on the matter i want to know
[1:04:02] what he wants for me and the only way
[1:04:04] i can get the full insight of that is to
[1:04:06] get to know him
[1:04:07] i want to know what oh come on now
[1:04:09] anybody with me this morning
[1:04:11] is there anybody wants to get to know
[1:04:13] jesus
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:15] oh hallelujah the closer you get to him
[1:04:17] the better you know him
[1:04:19] the closer you get to get to him the
[1:04:20] better you understand him
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:28] listen to david in the book of psalms
[1:04:30] have all the workers of iniquity no
[1:04:32] knowledge in other words
[1:04:33] don't they know who eat up my people as
[1:04:36] they eat bread and call not upon the
[1:04:38] lord
[1:04:39] proverbs 1 7 the fear of the lord
[1:04:42] is the beginning of knowledge but
[1:04:45] fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:04:49] we're building into something
[1:04:53] so knowledge and the knowledge we're
[1:04:55] talking about this morning which is
[1:04:56] building into knowing him
[1:04:59] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:05:01] that knowledge
[1:05:04] so now i look at people and say do they
[1:05:05] fear god
[1:05:08] because if you don't fear god you're in
[1:05:10] trouble
[1:05:13] the more you get to know him the more
[1:05:15] you fail the more you love him
[1:05:19] the more you get to know him you can't
[1:05:20] tell me you know him and dress how you
[1:05:22] want you can't tell
[1:05:23] me you know him and sing what you want
[1:05:25] and and go where you want because you
[1:05:26] don't know him
[1:05:28] because his his thoughts on everything
[1:05:30] is important to people who know him
[1:05:34] if i send you to buy something for me
[1:05:36] you will want to buy what i will want
[1:05:37] the only way you could do that
[1:05:38] is you have to know what i want if i
[1:05:41] tell you go and buy a lunch to me
[1:05:43] you have to know what what i like to eat
[1:05:44] or what they don't like to eat because
[1:05:46] if you
[1:05:46] don't know me you can buy what i want
[1:05:50] so when jesus was at age 12 he said i
[1:05:52] must be about my father's business so
[1:05:55] he understood the father's business and
[1:05:57] was acting on the father's business
[1:05:59] so this whole gospel this whole message
[1:06:02] all of the bible
[1:06:03] of the world is to bring us to know him
[1:06:05] so we could
[1:06:06] move with him act like him move live
[1:06:09] with him
[1:06:11] i have a few scriptures i hope this is
[1:06:13] okay with you this morning
[1:06:15] proverbs 1 22 how long his simple ones
[1:06:19] will he love simplicity and the scorners
[1:06:21] delight in their scorning
[1:06:23] and fools hate knowledge fools hate
[1:06:27] knowledge of this word they hate the
[1:06:29] knowledge of god they don't want to know
[1:06:31] about the god of judgment they want to
[1:06:33] know just the god of blessings but
[1:06:35] god is a god of judgment and blessings
[1:06:37] you have to know that he's a god who
[1:06:38] keeps his word you
[1:06:40] have to know that the arrow of god's
[1:06:42] deliverance has already been shot you
[1:06:44] have to know
[1:06:45] that judgment has already been
[1:06:46] proclaimed on this earth and if you know
[1:06:48] that that is taking place
[1:06:49] how desperate ought to be to be how
[1:06:52] ought to be to live
[1:06:52] how ought to be to act can the church
[1:06:56] say amen
[1:06:58] proverbs 2 6 for the lord give it wisdom
[1:07:01] out of his
[1:07:02] mouth commit knowledge and understanding
[1:07:04] so when god speaks he's giving knowledge
[1:07:06] and understanding
[1:07:07] he wants you to know him and he wants
[1:07:09] you to understand him
[1:07:10] every service you come to it's to get to
[1:07:12] know him better and the more you get to
[1:07:14] know him better
[1:07:15] is the more you understand him better
[1:07:17] and that's when scriptures become a
[1:07:19] whole new thing to you
[1:07:20] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:07:22] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:07:24] and the temperance
[1:07:25] it takes a whole new meaning to you
[1:07:28] because you get to know that's who he is
[1:07:30] that's his nature that's his being
[1:07:32] that's his attributes
[1:07:33] that's what i want to be like that's my
[1:07:35] goal that's my desire
[1:07:37] that's my motivation
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:41] i'm not saying don't study i'm not
[1:07:43] saying don't go to school but when all
[1:07:45] that getting
[1:07:46] get understanding and get the knowledge
[1:07:48] of god and not just the knowledge of god
[1:07:50] but know him
[1:07:52] who is more unable to take you to your
[1:07:55] child
[1:07:55] more unable to take you through your
[1:07:57] situations more than able
[1:07:59] do you know that he is more unable to
[1:08:01] bring you to adoption
[1:08:03] do you know he is more unable to bring
[1:08:05] you to perfection
[1:08:06] do you know that he has fire this
[1:08:08] morning to burn the snake in your heart
[1:08:11] that's holding you back from your
[1:08:12] breakthrough this morning do you know
[1:08:14] he's able to deliver your children
[1:08:16] do you know he's able to heal you this
[1:08:18] morning so if you know
[1:08:20] he's able to heal you why should he dead
[1:08:22] why sit you confused
[1:08:24] why sit you wondering if he is still the
[1:08:27] god of armies
[1:08:28] why sit you wondering if he's the same
[1:08:30] yesterday
[1:08:31] today and forever do you know he's a god
[1:08:34] of judgment
[1:08:35] do you know what you did yesterday it's
[1:08:37] important to him
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:41] do you know him do you know him
[1:08:45] not know the pastor not know the
[1:08:47] preacher
[1:08:48] not know the church but do you know him
[1:08:51] he's an awesome
[1:08:52] god he's a powerful god he's a merciful
[1:08:55] god
[1:08:56] do you know him you might know his mercy
[1:08:58] but you don't know him
[1:09:00] you might know his love but do you know
[1:09:04] him
[1:09:08] because to know him is life
[1:09:15] and we're gonna get to how we get to
[1:09:16] know him because it's not knowing us and
[1:09:18] just had knowledge but it's an
[1:09:19] experience
[1:09:21] it's a relationship it's an encounter
[1:09:23] with god
[1:09:24] it's not just the knowledge of
[1:09:25] scriptures but it's you having an
[1:09:27] encounter
[1:09:28] a spiritual experience where he's now
[1:09:31] inside of you
[1:09:32] so it's not an external conversation but
[1:09:34] he's in me
[1:09:35] oh hallelujah can the church say man
[1:09:39] come on young brother come on young
[1:09:41] sister if you know him
[1:09:43] you will be careful with who your
[1:09:44] friends are if you know him
[1:09:46] you will be careful where you go if you
[1:09:48] know him
[1:09:49] you can't just mischurch services if you
[1:09:52] know him
[1:09:52] you can't answer back your parents if
[1:09:55] you know him
[1:09:55] as once you love your wives if you know
[1:09:58] him wise he will reference your husbands
[1:10:00] if you know him you'll tell everybody
[1:10:03] about him
[1:10:04] oh come on now somebody preach back to
[1:10:06] me do you know who i'm talking about
[1:10:08] this morning
[1:10:09] oh do you know who i'm talking about i'm
[1:10:12] not talking about a man
[1:10:13] i know he's more than a man they said
[1:10:16] what manner of man is this
[1:10:18] do you know hallelujah
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:30] i've said it before people know all
[1:10:32] kinds of things
[1:10:33] and people they know what they want to
[1:10:35] know you know
[1:10:38] people know what they want to know i say
[1:10:40] right here and truly that people spend
[1:10:41] so much time
[1:10:42] analyzing the election and analyzing u.s
[1:10:45] election
[1:10:45] during that election the election on the
[1:10:47] street whatever it doesn't matter and
[1:10:49] they know everything
[1:10:51] but they don't know him
[1:10:54] they know what the prophet said but they
[1:10:55] don't know him the measure is not your
[1:10:58] knowledge of the message is to know him
[1:11:01] it's not to know even about the prophets
[1:11:03] to know him
[1:11:04] because the prophet was pointing to him
[1:11:10] come on now let's get back to basics
[1:11:13] have you met him
[1:11:14] because when he walked many knew about
[1:11:17] him
[1:11:17] but didn't you realize who he was but
[1:11:20] for those who recognize that it was him
[1:11:22] to them he was their power come on now
[1:11:26] we're going to get it in the in some
[1:11:28] quotes
[1:11:31] but ibrahim said he was described to
[1:11:32] them in so many ways
[1:11:34] and the pharisees didn't realize that it
[1:11:36] was him they were reading the
[1:11:38] descriptions all along by the parents
[1:11:40] and they didn't realize that what they
[1:11:41] were describing for all these years was
[1:11:42] there
[1:11:43] they didn't know him oh come on now they
[1:11:45] knew about him
[1:11:46] they knew him in the word only they knew
[1:11:48] him in the letter only but when he
[1:11:50] walked
[1:11:51] on the streets of nazareth they want to
[1:11:53] know who this is even to accuse him of
[1:11:55] being
[1:11:55] with babe with blg bob that's how
[1:11:58] backseating they were
[1:12:02] but there was a woman who had an issue
[1:12:05] with blood
[1:12:06] she had spent all of her money i don't
[1:12:09] know who spoke to her
[1:12:10] if she read a newspaper i don't know how
[1:12:13] she found out
[1:12:14] he didn't have no social media but she
[1:12:16] knew who he was
[1:12:17] and she told herself if i could just
[1:12:20] touch
[1:12:21] the hem of his garments i'm going to be
[1:12:23] made whole
[1:12:24] nobody could dissuade her she didn't
[1:12:26] need encouragement and she could not be
[1:12:28] discouraged
[1:12:29] she didn't need to be motivated and she
[1:12:31] could not be demotivated
[1:12:32] because she knew who he was she knew who
[1:12:35] was on the earth
[1:12:36] and she got to church that sunday
[1:12:38] morning and there were a lot of people
[1:12:40] around jesus
[1:12:41] but her knowledge of who he was and what
[1:12:43] she was going to get
[1:12:44] was enough to make her go past the
[1:12:46] deacons go past the ushers go
[1:12:48] past the elders go past the ministers
[1:12:51] until
[1:12:51] she came and contacted jesus jesus had
[1:12:54] to scream out who touched me
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:03] she knew that she knew that she knew if
[1:13:05] she could just get to jesus
[1:13:06] everything will be all right
[1:13:13] do you know
[1:13:22] in this message i want to touch on four
[1:13:24] things not knowing
[1:13:26] knowing about knowing and what you're
[1:13:29] supposed to know
[1:13:33] people move from you have to move from a
[1:13:35] state of not knowing
[1:13:37] you in the world you didn't know
[1:13:41] something caught your attention walking
[1:13:44] on the street somebody gave you a book
[1:13:45] you didn't know
[1:13:47] but abandoned call it spiritual amnesia
[1:13:50] you didn't know where you come from like
[1:13:52] joe battery
[1:13:53] be reminded where was that you didn't
[1:13:56] know
[1:13:58] all of us came from not knowing even
[1:14:01] you're groping church you don't know
[1:14:03] because this thing is a revelation
[1:14:05] revealed to an individual
[1:14:07] and god has no grandchildren so you move
[1:14:09] from not knowing and typically you move
[1:14:11] to knowing about
[1:14:14] so you know about the miracles you know
[1:14:17] about revival
[1:14:18] you know how it used to be you you know
[1:14:20] what god did but you don't know him yet
[1:14:23] you know about the holy ghost you know
[1:14:25] about being filled you know about
[1:14:28] being adopted you know about
[1:14:31] the cripples walking but until you get
[1:14:34] your experience you don't know
[1:14:36] him anybody with me this morning
[1:14:40] i don't want to know about him i want to
[1:14:42] know him
[1:14:44] i want to say i met him for myself he
[1:14:47] came into my living room i was
[1:14:49] i was on my knees one day and i felt as
[1:14:51] oh come on now somebody
[1:14:53] it wasn't a book i was reading but i
[1:14:55] felt a presence
[1:14:57] and i could now say i know him
[1:15:01] anybody with me this morning
[1:15:05] elisha was minding his business
[1:15:08] doing what he did best keeping the plumb
[1:15:10] line straight
[1:15:11] he knew about god he knew about the
[1:15:14] miracles
[1:15:18] but when elijah dropped the mantle upon
[1:15:21] him
[1:15:22] and he felt something
[1:15:25] later he would come to unless and it
[1:15:27] wasn't the mantle but it was the god of
[1:15:29] the mantle
[1:15:30] so he had an experience that experience
[1:15:33] is able to sustain him past the critics
[1:15:36] past the schools of the prophets
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:43] you see when people fall away it's
[1:15:44] because there was no experience
[1:15:48] it's the about phase
[1:15:53] anybody with me this morning
[1:15:57] i have a few more scriptures if that's
[1:15:59] okay are we doing for time i don't want
[1:16:00] to be too long with you
[1:16:03] personally press on proverbs 8
[1:16:07] 10 says receive my instruction and not
[1:16:09] silver
[1:16:11] so solomon is comparing instruction to
[1:16:14] be more valuable than silver
[1:16:16] you know why because with the right
[1:16:18] instruction they could find silver
[1:16:20] but if you get silver with no
[1:16:22] instruction you wouldn't know what god
[1:16:23] wants you to do
[1:16:25] and he says and knowledge rather than
[1:16:27] choice gold so not just knowledge rather
[1:16:29] than gold you know brother eclipse but
[1:16:30] choice goal
[1:16:32] the fine gold that that knowledge is
[1:16:33] more valuable than
[1:16:35] choice gold
[1:16:39] proverbs 14 7 go from the presence of a
[1:16:42] foolish man
[1:16:43] when thou perceive is not in him the
[1:16:45] lips of knowledge
[1:16:49] he talking shoppiness what you there
[1:16:51] trying to get from him
[1:16:53] the moment you perceive
[1:16:58] that the lips of knowledge are not in
[1:16:59] him
[1:17:01] go from his presence because you want to
[1:17:04] be speaking to people
[1:17:06] who have the lips of knowledge and not
[1:17:08] just any kind of knowledge but godly
[1:17:10] knowledge
[1:17:12] anybody with me this morning
[1:17:17] listen to this one if this makes it
[1:17:18] clearer proverbs 15 14
[1:17:21] the heart of him that had understanding
[1:17:24] secret knowledge
[1:17:25] but the mount of fools feed it on
[1:17:28] foolishness
[1:17:31] what are you feeding on what's
[1:17:34] motivating you
[1:17:35] what's pushing you
[1:17:42] and there are many scriptures are going
[1:17:43] to skip some of them
[1:17:46] but isaiah 5 13
[1:17:49] therefore my people have gone into
[1:17:51] captivity
[1:17:53] because they have no knowledge
[1:18:03] do you have the discipline to read the
[1:18:05] word every day
[1:18:08] do you have that discipline it's a real
[1:18:12] important question
[1:18:15] what you don't practice for you can't
[1:18:17] prepare for you can't deal with it
[1:18:21] there are principles in this world that
[1:18:24] are unbreakable
[1:18:25] if you are olympia and you're going to
[1:18:27] prepare for the olympics there's a
[1:18:29] regimen of training that you have to
[1:18:31] commit to
[1:18:32] to be good because success and
[1:18:34] achievement is not accidental
[1:18:37] winning is not accidental there are no
[1:18:39] accidental victories
[1:18:41] it is too competitive there's too much
[1:18:44] effort and sacrifice going into
[1:18:47] making it and the world tells us to
[1:18:50] meditate on the word day and night
[1:18:52] that's not some days but that's day and
[1:18:54] night every day
[1:18:55] to have good success and that is success
[1:18:57] in every way spiritual success
[1:19:00] family success relationship success
[1:19:04] financial success marital success what
[1:19:07] you do not know
[1:19:08] will hurt you
[1:19:11] the more you know the better decisions
[1:19:14] you make
[1:19:18] spiritual knowledge
[1:19:21] and not just spiritual knowledge
[1:19:23] knowledge about simple things
[1:19:25] how long will you go saying i don't know
[1:19:27] i don't know i don't know
[1:19:30] nobody ever told me that could have
[1:19:33] worked a hundred years ago but now
[1:19:34] have all information is available
[1:19:39] you don't know how to do two plus two
[1:19:41] check online they'll show you
[1:19:44] google it
[1:19:47] but don't just sit there and say i don't
[1:19:49] know
[1:19:54] what did the prophet say about something
[1:19:55] well i don't know brother i said what
[1:19:57] did the prophet say you know you can
[1:19:58] search it
[1:20:01] you know you can search in a message
[1:20:02] yourself right
[1:20:05] so before you ask me what he say
[1:20:07] research at first and bring the quotes
[1:20:09] and let's have a conversation around it
[1:20:13] anybody with me this morning people
[1:20:16] don't want to do homework
[1:20:22] they don't want to do any work
[1:20:29] i may have said it in a bible study the
[1:20:31] root word for work and worship is the
[1:20:33] same word
[1:20:35] so your work attitude is the same as
[1:20:37] your worship attitude
[1:20:41] so worship is work and work is worship
[1:20:44] that's why the bible says whatever you
[1:20:45] do do
[1:20:46] it unto the lord even if you're a slave
[1:20:48] do it unto the lord because your work is
[1:20:50] part of your worship
[1:20:51] it's a work ethic god is looking for
[1:20:53] it's an attitude
[1:20:54] to getting because you have to add to
[1:20:56] your faith virtue you can't sit and
[1:20:58] expect virtue to come
[1:21:00] you have to add it and add knowledge and
[1:21:03] add you have to add it
[1:21:04] it's on you to do it it's not unto the
[1:21:06] preacher to give it to you

[1:24:12] ask for it
[1:24:16] us some strong christians who people
[1:24:18] could bring all kind of thing to you but
[1:24:19] you can stand up because you understand
[1:24:21] doctrine
[1:24:22] you know who god is you know what the
[1:24:24] word says you know what the prophet
[1:24:25] presented you know how scriptures
[1:24:27] dovetail with one another
[1:24:32] and when you know these things you could
[1:24:34] tell the devil where to get off
[1:24:36] because that is what gave jesus that
[1:24:38] confidence in the wilderness
[1:24:40] it is written it is written it is also
[1:24:43] written he knew exactly where to pull
[1:24:45] from the repository of knowledge to deal
[1:24:47] with the situation that he was dealing
[1:24:49] with
[1:24:50] at that point in time
[1:24:53] and that's the least expectation of
[1:24:55] every christian
[1:24:57] that you should be able to pull into
[1:24:58] this bible and pull from there when you
[1:25:01] have need of something
[1:25:02] you can pull and you can encourage
[1:25:04] yourself in the lord like david
[1:25:05] encourage himself
[1:25:06] and you can pull scriptures when the
[1:25:08] enemy comes like a flood
[1:25:10] the spirit will raise a standard no
[1:25:12] weapon formed against me
[1:25:14] shall prosper by his stripes i am healed
[1:25:17] you need to know these things
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:32] jeremiah 3 15
[1:25:36] and i singular personal pronoun will
[1:25:38] give you pastors
[1:25:39] according to mine heart which shall feed
[1:25:42] you with
[1:25:42] knowledge and understanding
[1:25:47] so i believe this morning we getting a
[1:25:48] servant of knowledge and understanding
[1:25:52] because god wants you fed so that you
[1:25:55] could contend you know it's not
[1:25:56] i always say the fifo ministry is a
[1:25:58] means to an end
[1:26:01] it's a limited ministry until we all
[1:26:03] come
[1:26:04] into the unity of the faith and into the
[1:26:07] knowledge oh if the word is there again
[1:26:08] you got to know
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:18] hosea 4 6 hear the cry of this prophet
[1:26:21] my people are destroyed
[1:26:22] for lack of knowledge talk to anybody
[1:26:26] who made mistakes and messed up and they
[1:26:28] say okay i wish i knew
[1:26:31] i wish i knew if i knew i wouldn't have
[1:26:34] done that
[1:26:37] if i knew i would have done something
[1:26:38] different
[1:26:40] you look back and watch how you dealt
[1:26:42] with children or situations and
[1:26:44] we all have them i have them when we
[1:26:46] look back and say but
[1:26:47] if i only knew that this was going to be
[1:26:50] the result
[1:26:51] i would not have acted this way
[1:26:57] you look back and say oh gosh if i knew
[1:27:00] if i'd spent a little more time if i
[1:27:02] slow down if i went back to the
[1:27:03] scriptures and not
[1:27:04] went and and and i didn't lean on my own
[1:27:06] understanding
[1:27:08] and took my approach that i thought was
[1:27:10] right but when i look back i realized
[1:27:12] based on the evidence it was not right
[1:27:14] and when i go to the word i see the
[1:27:15] answer is there in the word
[1:27:17] had i known it would have been different
[1:27:20] but lord help me now to seek your way to
[1:27:23] seek your thoughts
[1:27:24] i want to know you because knowing you
[1:27:27] makes me a better father
[1:27:28] knowing you makes me a better husband
[1:27:30] knowing you makes me a better wife a
[1:27:32] better christian
[1:27:35] and knowing you gives me a way out oh
[1:27:38] come on now
[1:27:39] knowing you gives me a way of escape
[1:27:41] knowing you
[1:27:42] shows me how to go lord i want to walk
[1:27:44] in your footsteps i want to recognize
[1:27:46] your footprints cause
[1:27:47] i'm gonna put my foot just where you
[1:27:49] walk anybody with me this morning
[1:27:52] is anybody in the house this morning
[1:27:55] [Applause]
[1:27:58] hallelujah
[1:28:01] hosea 4 6 my people are destroyed for a
[1:28:04] lack
[1:28:04] of knowledge because thou has rejected
[1:28:08] knowledge
[1:28:09] you see how hosea puts it they reject it
[1:28:13] you ever talk to young people and they
[1:28:14] say don't do this now now i gotta know i
[1:28:16] know already
[1:28:24] you don't know why going through and in
[1:28:26] your day it was so and so and ting ting
[1:28:27] ting and there's now is we time no one
[1:28:29] anything rejecting knowledge
[1:28:36] failing to see the scripture there's
[1:28:37] nothing new under the sun
[1:28:42] wrestle with that nothing new it's the
[1:28:44] same devil
[1:28:45] and it's the same god it's still the
[1:28:46] same influences there are only two
[1:28:48] influences
[1:28:49] so i don't care if it's the internet if
[1:28:51] it's books if it's computer
[1:28:52] if it's scroll if it's a beaten drum
[1:28:55] whatever it is
[1:28:58] discern the source of the influence and
[1:29:01] where it will pull you
[1:29:02] and for that somebody you can't even
[1:29:05] read has enough experience and knowledge
[1:29:07] if they are christian to give you good
[1:29:08] advice come on young people be more
[1:29:10] respectful
[1:29:12] yeah you have a degree and your mama
[1:29:14] have no levels what does that have to do
[1:29:16] with it
[1:29:18] get spiritual knowledge get spiritual
[1:29:20] understanding
[1:29:21] get spiritual wisdom and god will bless
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:29] the only scripture the only commandment
[1:29:33] with a promise and a blessing honor your
[1:29:35] father and your mother
[1:29:37] so your day will be long you have your
[1:29:39] degree but your life's short
[1:29:40] because you don't understand the
[1:29:42] principle you don't know
[1:29:44] there's an old saying to know and not do
[1:29:47] is the same as not knowing
[1:29:49] so your heartbeat going through one ears
[1:29:51] and go through the others
[1:29:53] and you look at scorn and disdain at the
[1:29:56] older church people there's only old
[1:29:57] people as being church really
[1:30:04] thank you but anthony fix it jesus
[1:30:07] fix it jesus
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:17] give the devil a chance he will erase
[1:30:19] the history of this church
[1:30:22] not just this church not talk about the
[1:30:23] church the bride of jesus christ
[1:30:26] so that you don't know that's why it's
[1:30:27] important you read the book of
[1:30:28] revelation
[1:30:29] and read your scripture you know so when
[1:30:31] the devil come say satan i know
[1:30:33] when you went against elijah what he did
[1:30:36] i know
[1:30:36] when he went against david what he did i
[1:30:39] know
[1:30:40] when he went against daniel and the
[1:30:42] hebrew boys that didn't bow down
[1:30:44] and if you think that i will down now
[1:30:47] when i know
[1:30:48] how they stood you got to be kidding me
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:55] and and you maybe see that then your
[1:30:57] whole conversation begin to change
[1:30:59] because now you can continue to push the
[1:31:00] buttons
[1:31:01] satan you don't know who i am oh come on
[1:31:03] somebody help me

[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:25] i'm gonna try to find a place to
[1:34:28] i'm not too far in one third into the
[1:34:30] message
[1:34:37] listen to hosea i'm still in the
[1:34:39] scripture and i have some quotes to get
[1:34:40] to it later on
[1:34:41] my people are destroyed
[1:34:45] for a lack of knowledge marriage is
[1:34:47] destroyed
[1:34:48] for a lack of knowledge business is
[1:34:50] destroyed
[1:34:51] for a lack of knowledge relationships
[1:34:54] destroyed
[1:34:54] for a lack of knowledge brotherhood
[1:34:56] destroyed for a lack of knowledge
[1:34:59] people in the emotions in their feelings
[1:35:03] when every decision has to be governed
[1:35:06] by something
[1:35:08] so i'll give you an example if you are a
[1:35:10] lawyer
[1:35:12] you cannot go to a court of law and make
[1:35:15] up something
[1:35:16] what you want for the judge to act on
[1:35:20] for you to present anything in a court
[1:35:22] it has to be based on something
[1:35:24] based on the constitution based on a
[1:35:27] precedent
[1:35:28] based on evidence there's a whole stuff
[1:35:30] so you can't say well
[1:35:32] johanna i think because i feel this
[1:35:34] morning when i wake up
[1:35:35] and there was a chicken outside so i
[1:35:37] think because of that this case
[1:35:38] that can't hold water
[1:35:42] and that's how we make decisions in life
[1:35:43] you know i guess when i had a bad
[1:35:45] feeling in my stomach
[1:35:49] and i had a dream and i feel that you
[1:35:51] know god showing me something really
[1:35:59] that's why there was a uranium thumb and
[1:36:00] many old testament you know you said you
[1:36:02] had a dream you had a bad feeling you
[1:36:03] have a talk you have
[1:36:04] something come bring it in front of your
[1:36:05] room tommy and if them lights
[1:36:08] don't light up they're still in here
[1:36:12] so it makes you cautious with standing
[1:36:15] and say no no not the urine time the
[1:36:16] moment you doubt your dream
[1:36:17] undoubtedly vision you know it's not
[1:36:19] from god
[1:36:25] anybody with me this morning
[1:36:28] so you cannot be a lawyer and make
[1:36:30] decisions from your top of your head
[1:36:31] they say well
[1:36:32] where's the legal case what what article
[1:36:34] are you quoting
[1:36:35] what section where's your reference
[1:36:37] point you have to have some article
[1:36:39] section b
[1:36:40] when a policeman gives you a speeding
[1:36:42] ticket he not say well because he was
[1:36:44] speeding i feel to give no he said
[1:36:46] article section something something
[1:36:47] something is what give me the authority
[1:36:50] to give you a ticket because if there
[1:36:52] was no authority and context to give you
[1:36:54] the ticket i can't just get a ticket
[1:36:56] just so
[1:36:57] so even in trinidad with this whole
[1:36:58] corona viral situation they couldn't
[1:37:00] just say
[1:37:01] give people a chance for not wearing
[1:37:02] masks they had to go
[1:37:04] and make a law to now create a system of
[1:37:08] technology a way to say okay we can give
[1:37:10] a ticket based on
[1:37:11] x and this system that exists here
[1:37:16] is based on a system that exists
[1:37:18] elsewhere because god has laws
[1:37:22] and he uses words covenant covenant is a
[1:37:24] legal team
[1:37:25] they are covenants and they are
[1:37:26] contracts he swore by himself
[1:37:30] anybody with me so how you intend to
[1:37:32] fight your battle
[1:37:33] and you don't know the articles and
[1:37:35] sections to defend your case
[1:37:40] because the articles and sections is the
[1:37:42] scripture
[1:37:45] so that's why i remember the branham
[1:37:47] prayed for the man and he came back to
[1:37:49] get prayed for again
[1:37:50] he said go and say bye stripes i'm here
[1:37:51] bye stripes i'm healed by shameless i'm
[1:37:52] healed what do you say and keep quoting
[1:37:54] this section
[1:37:55] until this section and you become one
[1:38:00] because the man was not familiar with
[1:38:01] his section he had never encountered the
[1:38:03] section before
[1:38:04] he and his section wasn't won but after
[1:38:06] a while
[1:38:08] by stripes i'm healed by stripes down
[1:38:09] hill by stripes on here by
[1:38:11] extra extra read all about it by striped
[1:38:13] heel one day
[1:38:14] he and his section became one and
[1:38:17] what happened he got healed
[1:38:21] so what begins to happen when you begin
[1:38:22] to speak this word over and over
[1:38:24] until it becomes you and you will become
[1:38:26] one i shall be healed i shall be adopted
[1:38:28] predestinated onto adoption by foreign
[1:38:31] knowledge god wrote my name and
[1:38:33] listen you in that mindset the devil
[1:38:35] there he said i give up i done
[1:38:36] i done he can't get to you no more
[1:38:38] because your mind is made up
[1:38:40] he is able to take charge over me i've
[1:38:42] never seen the righteous forsaken on his
[1:38:44] seatbelt
[1:38:45] bread though that and you are in that
[1:38:47] channel what are you caught in sections
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:38:57] you may be seated is this helping
[1:38:58] anybody so
[1:39:00] now you know that you are supposed to be
[1:39:01] a spiritual lawyer
[1:39:04] but isaac where is that the bible say be
[1:39:07] ready to give an
[1:39:08] answer to any man that would answer i've
[1:39:12] said it before in the greek is apologia
[1:39:15] which means a reasoned defense is not
[1:39:17] what a lawyer does
[1:39:19] so you have to give a reasoned defense
[1:39:22] you could defend it from somewhere
[1:39:30] even the devil as accuser of the bridge
[1:39:32] and has her accused in context you know
[1:39:35] oh listen carefully the devil got this
[1:39:37] accused you know he has to go into
[1:39:39] scripture to accuse you
[1:39:43] because he got his accused out of
[1:39:45] nowhere he has to find these scriptures
[1:39:47] that speak about judgment and
[1:39:48] mistakes and when you do this this is
[1:39:50] what happens
[1:39:52] and tell god that that's how we could
[1:39:53] that's the only way he could accuse you
[1:39:55] because the law is what said is wrong to
[1:39:58] lie
[1:40:01] the law is what says if you bring
[1:40:02] another god before me that is a problem
[1:40:05] so when you do your foolishness the
[1:40:07] devil has a right now they take the same
[1:40:08] scripture
[1:40:09] and go to go to accuse you see look
[1:40:12] they're not doing you tell them pray and
[1:40:14] they pray
[1:40:16] you tell them read and look they are
[1:40:17] reading look that's what i read for you
[1:40:23] he can't find the bible he think he
[1:40:25] think it somewhere he think
[1:40:29] it has confused me where people forget
[1:40:31] the bible in church and you know confu
[1:40:32] i'll be confused
[1:40:34] how your bible in laws are found
[1:40:42] the decency to get rid of that box that
[1:40:44] there should be no lawsuit
[1:40:45] for your bible
[1:40:50] but it's with a context i know when the
[1:40:53] devil accuses you of these things no no
[1:40:54] your lawyer
[1:40:56] god i don't know find a case don't
[1:40:57] finish it listen listen
[1:40:59] i make grace and god has to find only
[1:41:01] scripture just to
[1:41:02] cover you until you reach into your
[1:41:04] stature
[1:41:09] so that's why when the prophet was there
[1:41:10] sitting watching the woman and saying
[1:41:12] and starting to accuse her and
[1:41:13] say god said listen look at your life
[1:41:16] and you show him the blood bumper
[1:41:17] showing how he was dealing with it the
[1:41:20] blood is what was separating it
[1:41:23] anybody with me i hope he gets strength
[1:41:27] no no because we're using the word now
[1:41:28] as a weapon
[1:41:29] some of us seen the bible as an
[1:41:31] inspirational book isn't it it's a
[1:41:32] weapon
[1:41:33] it's a weapon of warfare it's a short
[1:41:36] sharpening two-edged sword
[1:41:37] it could cut into your situation this
[1:41:39] morning and bring your child
[1:41:41] save your marriage give you a new job
[1:41:44] give you a direct channel of access to
[1:41:46] god and his blessing
[1:41:47] and wisdom a revelation to know how to
[1:41:49] live and how to act
[1:41:52] it is not semantics it's the reality of
[1:41:54] it if you could get the wisdom and the
[1:41:56] understanding to know what this is we're
[1:41:58] dealing with this morning i'm almost
[1:42:00] finished
[1:42:02] i hope this helping somebody i am moved
[1:42:04] beyond hosea
[1:42:06] i was telling jose i am rich i have
[1:42:07] reached a message yes or no
[1:42:11] i actually have this section i mean the
[1:42:13] title of the section is called
[1:42:14] background
[1:42:16] my people are destroyed for lack of
[1:42:18] knowledge because thou has rejected
[1:42:20] knowledge
[1:42:24] i will also reject thee look at god's
[1:42:26] responses
[1:42:27] that thou shalt be no priest to me
[1:42:29] seeing now has forgotten the law of thy
[1:42:31] god remember i say don't forget
[1:42:33] i will also forget thy children
[1:42:41] who is there six six for i desired mercy
[1:42:44] and not sacrificed and the knowledge of
[1:42:45] god more than burnt offerings
[1:42:48] burnt offerings is the type of just
[1:42:51] rituals
[1:42:53] so you're coming to church and you feel
[1:42:54] that is it so you're coming to church i
[1:42:56] come to the church you know but you know
[1:42:57] but you don't know him
[1:43:00] he said i much rather the knowledge of
[1:43:01] god than the ritual
[1:43:03] you have to come to church but the
[1:43:05] objective of community church is to know
[1:43:07] him
[1:43:09] his nature his being his attributes
[1:43:13] prophecy habakkuk 214 for the earth
[1:43:16] shall be filled
[1:43:17] with the knowledge of the glory of god
[1:43:19] as the waters cover the sea just a few
[1:43:24] more scriptures
[1:43:25] first corinthians
[1:43:30] 1 5 that in everything ye are enriched
[1:43:32] by him
[1:43:34] this is this is paul's declaration of a
[1:43:36] blessing that in everything
[1:43:38] all you are enriched by him in all
[1:43:41] utterance and in all knowledge
[1:43:44] ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of
[1:43:48] christ
[1:43:49] which pass it knowledge
[1:43:52] so this is this is now going beyond just
[1:43:54] the knowledge nobody love of christ
[1:43:56] to know the love of christ is to know
[1:43:58] him you know
[1:43:59] because he gets in contact with his love
[1:44:01] now not just in knowledge
[1:44:03] that you might be filled with all the
[1:44:04] fullness of god look how we tie it there
[1:44:07] isn't that beautiful to know the love of
[1:44:09] christ
[1:44:10] which pass it knowledge it passes our
[1:44:12] finite understanding
[1:44:14] how his love could be so great even when
[1:44:16] we messed up so many times oh
[1:44:18] do you know his love no
[1:44:21] greater love than this that you might be
[1:44:24] filled with all the fullness of god
[1:44:27] i said this for but i have the scripture
[1:44:29] here ephesians 4 13
[1:44:30] places the fire full ministry in its
[1:44:32] role of
[1:44:34] knowing god till we all come in the
[1:44:36] unity of the fate
[1:44:37] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:44:40] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:44:43] the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:44:47] philippians 1 9 and this i pray that
[1:44:49] your love
[1:44:50] may abound yet more and more in judge
[1:44:53] in more in knowledge and in all judgment
[1:44:58] because you can't judge without
[1:45:00] knowledge you know
[1:45:02] imagine you are a lawyer defending a
[1:45:04] case and they put a judge up there who
[1:45:05] don't know the law
[1:45:10] that whole courtesy breakdown that is
[1:45:12] why typically
[1:45:13] the judge was a lawyer before and they
[1:45:16] get elevated on the bench
[1:45:18] because they are proven and they
[1:45:19] recognize your fear and listen
[1:45:22] but you can't be a judge and you know
[1:45:23] the law see what um what law is that
[1:45:25] um hold on what was that what was that
[1:45:32] and we read that scripture in
[1:45:34] philippians yeah doubtless i count all
[1:45:36] things but loss
[1:45:37] for the excellency the excellency of the
[1:45:40] knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[1:45:42] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:45:44] things
[1:45:46] and do count them but dung that i may
[1:45:48] win christ
[1:45:50] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:45:54] lord
[1:45:55] i'm trying to wrap up shortly colossians
[1:45:58] 1 9 for this cause we also
[1:46:00] since the day we heard it do not cease
[1:46:02] to pray for you unto desire that he
[1:46:03] might be filled with the knowledge of
[1:46:05] his will
[1:46:06] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:46:08] understanding
[1:46:11] let me skip through i have two more
[1:46:13] pages of scriptures
[1:46:20] so to know him is life and we spoke
[1:46:23] about
[1:46:24] four things not knowing knowing about
[1:46:27] knowing and what you're supposed to know
[1:46:30] and not knowing can be negative it can
[1:46:32] also be positive
[1:46:34] in context
[1:46:37] from a negative perspective lot did not
[1:46:40] know
[1:46:40] that he would lose his family
[1:46:46] he didn't anticipate it he took it for
[1:46:48] granted
[1:46:49] that they were strong enough because
[1:46:51] they were in abraham's house
[1:46:53] he thought that the foundation that they
[1:46:54] had in abraham's house was enough to
[1:46:56] sustain them
[1:46:58] and they didn't realize because the
[1:46:59] bible said and i preached this before
[1:47:01] that it vex righteous lot he was
[1:47:03] redeemed in the new testament with
[1:47:05] he said it vex right so lot himself
[1:47:07] wasn't caught up with what was going on
[1:47:09] there but he lost his family
[1:47:14] i've seen many people make decisions
[1:47:16] leave
[1:47:17] church and now there's children the
[1:47:19] family everything mashup
[1:47:23] because they didn't agree with something
[1:47:24] and and now you look at the ears and see
[1:47:26] the consequences everybody of the church
[1:47:31] did not know he was going to lose his
[1:47:32] family
[1:47:35] the people in noah's day thought they
[1:47:36] were right they didn't know judgment was
[1:47:37] over them
[1:47:41] saddam and gomorrah they didn't know
[1:47:43] that it was over
[1:47:44] already judged samson didn't know that
[1:47:48] he was going to lose
[1:47:49] his eyes
[1:47:54] then we could switch not knowing into
[1:47:57] moses didn't know that he was born a
[1:47:59] deliverer
[1:48:02] gideon didn't know he was a mighty man
[1:48:04] of allah
[1:48:06] but in each of these situations they
[1:48:08] went from not knowing
[1:48:10] to knowing and the knowledge
[1:48:14] of what they were born for changed their
[1:48:16] whole life and their destiny and their
[1:48:18] purpose
[1:48:20] so you can't keep operating as if you
[1:48:22] didn't know
[1:48:23] because if you say you left the world
[1:48:24] and coming to church and you left not
[1:48:26] knowing into knowing i expect a change
[1:48:28] in behavior
[1:48:29] from how you were when you didn't know
[1:48:31] to know that you know you can't be
[1:48:32] behaving like you didn't know
[1:48:34] anybody with me this morning
[1:48:39] was that who i that's who i am and who i
[1:48:41] grew up well then you didn't leave yet
[1:48:47] because you have to leave it behind you
[1:48:49] you have to be really scripted forget
[1:48:51] any things that are passed
[1:48:52] there are some things that cannot be
[1:48:53] part of your conversation anymore
[1:48:55] and there are things that is not the
[1:48:57] holy ghost of the worst noise you have
[1:48:58] to make a choice did not do it
[1:49:02] reasonable service speaks to your
[1:49:04] discipline you know there are people who
[1:49:05] i know who not christian and have
[1:49:06] discipline
[1:49:12] and there's not no spirit driving them
[1:49:14] they just make a choice to eat healthy
[1:49:15] to do certain things
[1:49:19] i remember being in university and there
[1:49:20] were young ladies in university who will
[1:49:22] tell you they're not having sex before
[1:49:24] they get
[1:49:26] get engaged and in
[1:49:29] my into marriage
[1:49:33] and and they were not christians
[1:49:39] what is your excuse
[1:49:46] there has to be a change when you know
[1:49:50] if you know putting something in your
[1:49:52] food is unhealthy for your heart you
[1:49:53] never had condition why are you putting
[1:49:54] it
[1:49:56] it's best willing to tell you because if
[1:49:59] you intend to do what you was doing
[1:50:00] before before you know
[1:50:03] you know you have high sugar and it has
[1:50:05] to be drinking soft drink
[1:50:09] if you buy you're ready you're ready
[1:50:11] don't you ready no you know
[1:50:17] the only solution
[1:50:23] dicey solution now
[1:50:31] because these are simple things you know
[1:50:34] but it just goes to show how difficult
[1:50:36] choices and discipline and decisions
[1:50:38] really are
[1:50:41] because will is like a muscle
[1:50:45] will is like a muscle so it takes
[1:50:48] will it takes focus it takes decisions
[1:50:51] to live
[1:50:52] every single day to have victory and you
[1:50:54] know something interesting
[1:50:56] victory is contagious
[1:50:59] so victory in natural and victory is
[1:51:01] spiritual is all victories
[1:51:04] so when you even makes it a natural
[1:51:06] decision certain spiritual decisions get
[1:51:08] affected as well you know
[1:51:09] because it shows you lack the ability to
[1:51:11] make good decisions
[1:51:14] we think so i have decided to follow
[1:51:16] jesus
[1:51:17] it's a decision you don't want to decide
[1:51:20] to take sugar out your drink when you're
[1:51:21] not supporting it
[1:51:25] we're dealing with the measure and
[1:51:26] character of a man now
[1:51:35] the temple of the holy ghost
[1:51:39] what you can do to remain healthy is
[1:51:42] your responsibility
[1:51:51] i tell you we go and find the devil
[1:51:52] wherever he is on buddhism
[1:51:56] you can't show it because you're just
[1:51:57] tired because you need wrong things
[1:52:02] you're there feeling sluggish every
[1:52:04] entire in church
[1:52:07] get some vegetables
[1:52:12] stop eating complex habakkuk
[1:52:13] carbohydrates appreciate myself to her
[1:52:16] do it i know what they say no no no no
[1:52:18] um
[1:52:20] all of us under the edge of everybody's
[1:52:21] breathiness this morning
[1:52:31] one time with anthony sing a song there
[1:52:33] noma numa numa
[1:52:44] didn't reach him i just had him no part
[1:52:49] and i said but wait no shouting on the
[1:52:51] heels of glory listen
[1:52:53] you have to be able to jump and shout we
[1:52:55] shall have a grand time up in heaven
[1:52:57] jump on shoulder and sing around you
[1:52:59] there you can't move two things you're
[1:53:01] done tired already
[1:53:07] what are you doing in the show taking
[1:53:07] your car really jump out
[1:53:11] but his decisions i'm trying to bring a
[1:53:13] point about decisions
[1:53:16] saving is a decision playing around with
[1:53:19] the world is a decision prayer is a
[1:53:20] decision they're all decisions
[1:53:23] and it's important because god made a
[1:53:25] decision to come to you
[1:53:26] to come to me and he has the discipline
[1:53:30] to stick with his decision
[1:53:32] let us do the same i have decided to
[1:53:35] follow jesus
[1:53:36] no turning back no turning back
[1:53:40] you could take the whole world but give
[1:53:42] me jesus
[1:53:45] [Applause]
[1:53:49] let's try to find a way to close out is
[1:53:51] this helping anybody this morning
[1:53:55] i said it's a conversation with you is
[1:53:57] that you could grow and you can meditate
[1:53:58] because listen people are jumping and
[1:54:00] shouting i see people jumping shout and
[1:54:01] they're nothing churchill
[1:54:05] because the grounding of what it takes
[1:54:07] to survive
[1:54:08] the devil playing games you know while
[1:54:10] we're here here they're planning this
[1:54:11] whole week you ain't want to plan you
[1:54:12] can plan your week for you
[1:54:19] i could pull scriptures on planning how
[1:54:22] god went to plan
[1:54:24] you think the devil don't understand
[1:54:26] where the balance said he knows the
[1:54:27] bible better than you and i you know
[1:54:32] you don't have a plan you don't want to
[1:54:33] pray you don't want to meditate how we
[1:54:35] expect to have victory and sustainable
[1:54:37] victory
[1:54:40] not just a operative but sustainable
[1:54:41] victory you want to be beating the devil
[1:54:43] every time
[1:54:45] blows blows blows
[1:54:48] but abraham said it a man could live in
[1:54:50] such a way that he devil just get
[1:54:52] get fed up with him and walk away you
[1:54:53] could live such a lie that he never
[1:54:55] leave you alone
[1:54:59] that is a point where the devil come and
[1:55:01] he just waiting for him like you don't
[1:55:02] even you don't have to raise your
[1:55:04] hands when i was younger i was doing a
[1:55:06] little martial art
[1:55:07] training i always said keep your hands
[1:55:09] up keep your hands up keep your hands up
[1:55:11] because you don't know when he had come
[1:55:12] in after they're walking wrong so
[1:55:16] but the point was if you stay ready
[1:55:18] you'd have to get ready
[1:55:20] so when he so when he devil come and he
[1:55:22] take you off your guard like joshua
[1:55:24] that's what joshua was joshua was like
[1:55:25] are you forced against us
[1:55:27] he said well i'd leave my bible in
[1:55:29] church sunday
[1:55:38] no he was ready he said are you fools or
[1:55:40] answers
[1:55:43] let's bring this so close musicians get
[1:55:45] ready so moses didn't know he was born a
[1:55:48] deliverer
[1:55:48] gideon didn't know he was a mighty man
[1:55:50] of allah jahazi didn't know that it was
[1:55:52] more for him than against him
[1:55:53] saul thought he knew god but on the road
[1:55:56] to damascus
[1:55:58] he realized he didn't know god and god
[1:55:59] met him and introduced himself to him
[1:56:01] and after that encounter he changed from
[1:56:03] saul to paul and he could say i know him
[1:56:05] and he could write the entire new
[1:56:07] testament
[1:56:08] can the church say amen so goliath did
[1:56:11] not know
[1:56:11] that there was a david who was raised up
[1:56:13] to deal with him oh
[1:56:15] hallelujah pharaoh didn't know that when
[1:56:17] moses left
[1:56:18] and came back it was the end of moses of
[1:56:21] pharaoh's time
[1:56:22] can the church say amen hallelujah
[1:56:25] hallelujah hallelujah i'm trying to find
[1:56:27] a place to close out here
[1:56:29] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:56:34] and when you know you have to do better
[1:56:36] you cannot just know and not do better
[1:56:39] moses knew he was supposed to speak to
[1:56:41] the rock
[1:56:42] but he ended up striking the rock so he
[1:56:44] knew what was right but he did something
[1:56:45] different
[1:56:52] to know and do when you know you have to
[1:56:54] be prepared to do
[1:56:55] so david after his experiences he knew
[1:56:58] god was with him
[1:56:59] joshua knew god was with him so he could
[1:57:01] say son stand still
[1:57:03] moon hang over angelon job oh i don't
[1:57:06] have the time to go into it now
[1:57:07] but job knew at first he didn't know
[1:57:09] what was going on he didn't know it was
[1:57:11] god having a debate about him he didn't
[1:57:13] know god was boasting about him he
[1:57:14] didn't know god was there
[1:57:15] cheering him on and say no matter what
[1:57:17] you throw at my servant job
[1:57:19] he is not going to curse me job didn't
[1:57:22] know these things but if god had to
[1:57:24] remind them where was it
[1:57:25] all and at the end of it job looked at
[1:57:27] this condition looked at the situation
[1:57:29] and said i know
[1:57:30] my redeemer limits oh hallelujah
[1:57:33] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:36] oh hallelujah i spoke about this from
[1:57:39] the message spoken with his original
[1:57:40] seed i'm wrapping up
[1:57:41] listen close now how different jesus was
[1:57:43] in his day from the denomination of his
[1:57:45] day
[1:57:46] they would point back to him how i'd
[1:57:48] like to hold on this for a while
[1:57:49] they would point back over their
[1:57:51] shoulder back down through
[1:57:52] time and say we are moses disciples we
[1:57:55] knew that god appeared to moses
[1:57:57] that's knowing about in the burning bush
[1:57:59] we know he said they know the history of
[1:58:02] moses
[1:58:02] but they didn't know the god of moses
[1:58:04] because he stood before
[1:58:06] them in john 6 and said before moses was
[1:58:09] before abraham was i am hallelujah
[1:58:12] they knowed moses history so is it today
[1:58:15] they claim they know the word of christ
[1:58:18] but they don't know that god was in
[1:58:19] christ
[1:58:20] oh hallelujah my oh but iran said no i
[1:58:24] feel like david
[1:58:25] whining that sling up now i hope i don't
[1:58:28] seem sacrilegious to you
[1:58:29] jesus could and did say the father that
[1:58:32] sent me is in me
[1:58:33] and as he has sent me so sent are you to
[1:58:35] his disciples
[1:58:36] the father that sent me is with me if i
[1:58:39] do not the works of the word
[1:58:40] promise of my father then don't believe
[1:58:42] me because they are the ones that
[1:58:44] testify
[1:58:45] of me let me say this if god don't
[1:58:47] vindicate this to be the truth but if
[1:58:49] i'm speaking about himself then it's not
[1:58:51] but if god vindicates i'm telling you
[1:58:52] the truth then believe the word
[1:58:56] jesus said i know you you think you know
[1:58:58] moses you know might have known history
[1:59:01] of moses but you don't know this god
[1:59:03] for i was before moses they couldn't see
[1:59:05] it because they
[1:59:06] of their father the devil but abraham
[1:59:08] said oh hallelujah
[1:59:11] and i think that that reflects again and
[1:59:12] he wants to pass this way
[1:59:14] if a person ever meets jesus and finds
[1:59:17] him really
[1:59:18] in your heart you entrusted not only in
[1:59:21] your
[1:59:21] own household but the household of god
[1:59:24] everywhere
[1:59:25] you are interested that they know him
[1:59:29] and to know him is life know him see
[1:59:32] not know to read the word also but know
[1:59:35] him
[1:59:35] is life oh hallelujah
[1:59:39] and christianity is misrepresented to
[1:59:42] people
[1:59:43] christianity has been represented the
[1:59:45] people as a declaration of creed
[1:59:47] christianity is a living being jesus
[1:59:49] christ
[1:59:50] the resurrected god that's alive and
[1:59:53] among us
[1:59:54] now christianity is a person not a creed
[1:59:57] to know him is life not even know his
[2:00:01] word
[2:00:01] that isn't life know him and he is the
[2:00:04] word
[2:00:05] look how the prophet place it not just
[2:00:07] don't know where people know scripture
[2:00:08] and they're doing what they want
[2:00:09] but to know him he is the word yes but
[2:00:11] you have to know him
[2:00:12] because to know him is life
[2:00:15] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:19] listen to this now and this would
[2:00:20] encourage you but ibrahim said a fellow
[2:00:22] said to me not long ago you came in and
[2:00:24] played something softly a fella said to
[2:00:25] me not long ago
[2:00:26] uh i was just discussing what we taught
[2:00:29] about a certain scripture in the bible
[2:00:31] and this fellow was quite a scholar he
[2:00:33] said well you just don't know your bible
[2:00:35] he said it to the prophet you imagine
[2:00:40] the one who tied up all the loose ends
[2:00:42] reveal every mystery
[2:00:44] and this color telling by the random you
[2:00:46] just don't know your bible
[2:00:47] i said i know the author real well
[2:00:50] hallelujah so that's the main thing
[2:00:54] if i know him he will take care of the
[2:00:56] rest of him to know him is life
[2:00:59] hallelujah glory
[2:01:02] in feast of the trumpets but abraham
[2:01:04] said daniel said the wise shall know
[2:01:07] but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know
[2:01:10] you see is he now they shall know their
[2:01:12] god
[2:01:14] now now how shall you pay in the last
[2:01:16] days is to bring the people back to the
[2:01:18] wood
[2:01:19] so it is true the word we could get
[2:01:21] access to knowing him
[2:01:23] oh hallelujah so that the bride will
[2:01:27] know her husband i'm reading the prophet
[2:01:29] her meet the revealed word that's why
[2:01:32] this has to happen
[2:01:33] and last quote church wherever you are
[2:01:37] what you belong to makes no difference
[2:01:39] but there's one thing you must know
[2:01:42] you've got to be in christ or you're
[2:01:44] dead
[2:01:45] you can't live outside of him your
[2:01:47] church might be all right as a building
[2:01:49] your fellowship might be all right as a
[2:01:51] man
[2:01:51] but when you deny the body the blood the
[2:01:53] word of jesus christ
[2:01:55] you're dead the minute you do it it's
[2:01:57] god's chosen place of worship
[2:01:59] there's where his name is exactly
[2:02:01] there's where he chose to put his name
[2:02:03] not in the church but in the son jesus
[2:02:05] christ
[2:02:06] to know him is life may the lord richie
