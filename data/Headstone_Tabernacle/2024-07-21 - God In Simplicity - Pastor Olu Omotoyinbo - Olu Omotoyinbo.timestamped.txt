[40:13] Jesus Christ whom to know is life and
[40:16] life
[40:17] eternal just a quick background bring
[40:20] greetings from the assembly back in
[40:22] Australia Perth Western Australia
[40:24] originally from South Africa now/
[40:26] Australia Australia but um where I come
[40:29] from is not important where I'm going
[40:31] that's
[40:34] important
[40:36] um I just like to put out a disclaimer
[40:39] before I start this testimony this
[40:41] testimony is never about me it's about
[40:44] God and how he changed my life and
[40:47] healed my life and changed it completely
[40:50] so that I can go around and talk about
[40:53] the goodness of
[40:54] God that nothing can stand in the way of
[40:58] our almighty
[41:01] God 20
[41:05] 2021 got diagnosed with kidney disease
[41:09] by the time I got to the doctors kidney
[41:11] disease was now sitting at
[41:15] 19% 19% I'm in danger there's nothing
[41:20] more I just need to follow the process
[41:22] and then see how it goes because the end
[41:24] results would be then dialysis
[41:28] went to a convention in Tasmania and I
[41:31] went to declare to Satan that I'm here
[41:34] to show the devil on whose side I
[41:37] am
[41:38] hallu came back from that convention all
[41:42] hell broke loose in my life but that's
[41:45] okay because I have a god that is not a
[41:48] he's not a
[41:49] liar he's a man that sticks to his
[41:55] word my kidney failure my kidney
[41:58] function just went right down I was now
[42:00] sitting on
[42:02] 9% um any medical doctor will tell you
[42:05] that that is not good
[42:07] news I was disappointed as a Son of God
[42:11] but not for long because then I realize
[42:14] that God can take you out of any
[42:18] situation if you only
[42:21] believe if you only take God at his word
[42:25] you start praying w the prophet says
[42:28] your prayer is like an atomic bomb it
[42:32] will rattle anything anywhere and any
[42:35] time and it will just be
[42:37] debris and God will just come down and
[42:40] take care of you I then go through a lot
[42:43] of bad things in my life my kidneys are
[42:47] not playing well I become toxic my whole
[42:52] body becomes toxic because there's no
[42:54] filtration
[42:55] system the devil fights me I get
[42:58] nauseous I've got no iron levels I have
[43:01] chronic fatigue I am twice my sius what
[43:05] you see now is a new version of
[43:08] Steven he took me out of that bad
[43:11] situation and he placed my foot on a
[43:13] rock to
[43:18] stay and all the while this is happening
[43:22] when God gives you a wife outside of
[43:24] Salvation God gives you a good wife
[43:27] that wife stood and every morning when I
[43:30] wake up and I'm down I can't even lift
[43:33] my head I'd hear a prayer and say thank
[43:36] you Lord for Steven's healing thank you
[43:38] Lord for Steven's healing thank you Lord
[43:40] that's all she
[43:42] prayed and we're going through through
[43:45] through our motions then I'm sick I I
[43:47] broke out into eczema because when the
[43:50] body is not in Balance everything goes
[43:53] wrong my skin started I look like an
[43:56] alligator or a crocodile because the
[43:59] skin would just break out I would
[44:01] scratch until blood comes
[44:03] out it was not good but this was my test
[44:08] and my cross to
[44:09] bear and I would pray and I would ask
[44:12] God to come closer and I would pray and
[44:15] all in the background it says just hold
[44:17] on my child hold on my
[44:19] CH Joy comes in the
[44:24] morning and part of my testimony in part
[44:27] of me being in Trinidad is when I was so
[44:30] sick and with the time change I would
[44:32] switch on 2: a.m. in the morning and I
[44:34] would listen to all these ministers
[44:36] preach and they preach so much of faith
[44:38] into me that I said to my almighty God
[44:43] when I'm back on my feet again and I
[44:45] know you're going to pull me out of the
[44:48] darkness I will come to Trinidad and
[44:50] this is my first stop since my healing
[44:54] is Trinidad because I keep my promise to
[44:57] my almighty God that if you can do it
[44:59] for me you can do it for anybody that is
[45:02] in this place because is anything to
[45:05] heart for God no
[45:10] sir
[45:13] Hallelujah God is not a man that he
[45:16] should
[45:17] lie he pulled me out and I asked him to
[45:21] come down and I pull down the
[45:23] strongholds and I told Satan to get the
[45:25] behind me it is written it is also
[45:29] [Applause]
[45:35] written things got worse but in the
[45:38] background things was getting better I
[45:40] knew things was getting better not long
[45:45] 2022 I get a a a call and there's this a
[45:49] special prayer for me that was done and
[45:51] the brother that came to pray for
[45:53] me the anointing was so great that day
[45:56] in the service and he came to me and he
[45:59] says to me brother what would you like
[46:00] me to pray
[46:03] for and I had nothing to say and it was
[46:06] just the Holy Ghost speaking through me
[46:08] and I said these kidneys aren't working
[46:11] anymore I want you to ask God on my
[46:15] behalf to give me a new
[46:19] kidney and guess
[46:21] what the order I asked it in I received
[46:25] a new kidney
[46:32] 3 months from the date of my prayer to
[46:37] the date I got a call Mr ESO can you
[46:41] come in at 7: in the morning we have a
[46:43] perfect
[46:45] [Music]
[46:47] match but when that call came I knew
[46:50] another call was going a call a royal
[46:53] telephone to Glory this is my beloved
[46:57] son I will take care of him he's been
[47:01] through a
[47:03] lot but I'll give him
[47:06] rest I went to
[47:08] hospital the doctors put in a
[47:13] kidney and from the time they connected
[47:17] the new kidney until now one year 6
[47:20] months the Lord has only been good to
[47:24] me I walk with him I talk with him I
[47:29] give him all the honor and all the glory
[47:31] because Satan thought he's going to
[47:33] defeat me this is another Son of God I'm
[47:37] going to declare that he is here and
[47:41] anything you ask in his name receive it
[47:44] in the name of
[47:48] [Music]
[47:50] Jesus God took care of everything the
[47:54] doctors came back and says
[47:57] this is impossible when we put in a
[48:00] kidney it takes a few months even
[48:02] sometimes this one kicked in from the
[48:05] time we put it in it's almost like your
[48:08] brother gave you a kidney I said yes my
[48:12] heavenly father gave me this one and
[48:15] he's going to take care of it I'm here
[48:17] to
[48:18] say don't let the devil preach to you
[48:21] don't let the devil tell you it's
[48:24] impossible with God nothing is is
[48:27] [Applause]

[1:07:50] we bless you brother Char aobi praise
[1:07:54] God and also sends his
[1:07:58] greetings so I want to read a scripture
[1:08:01] uh we have something to present to you
[1:08:02] before our speaker come this morning
[1:08:05] from 2 Kings chapter 2 reading from
[1:08:07] verse one and it came to pass when the
[1:08:10] Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by
[1:08:12] a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[1:08:15] from gigal and Elijah said unto Elisha T
[1:08:18] here pray thee for the Lord that sent me
[1:08:19] to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as
[1:08:22] the Lord live it as I so live it I will
[1:08:24] not leave
[1:08:26] so they went down to beel and the sons
[1:08:28] of the prophets that were at Beal came
[1:08:30] forth to Elisha and said unto him
[1:08:31] knowest thou that the Lord will take
[1:08:33] away thy master from thy head today he
[1:08:35] said yeah I know it hold your peace
[1:08:38] Elijah said unto him Elisha St here I
[1:08:41] pray thee this is verse four and the
[1:08:43] Lord sent me to
[1:08:45] Jericho and verse 5 and the sons of the
[1:08:47] prophets that were Jericho came to
[1:08:49] Elijah and said unto him knowest thou
[1:08:51] not that the Lord will take away thy
[1:08:53] master from thy head to thee and and he
[1:08:55] answered yeah I know it holy your
[1:08:58] peace Elijah said unto him tar I pray
[1:09:01] thee here for the Lord God had sent me
[1:09:03] to Jordan he said as the Lord liveth as
[1:09:06] I so liveth I will not leave thee and
[1:09:08] they too went on so this Elisha Ministry
[1:09:13] is a type of Def fful Ministry that will
[1:09:16] cross Jordan but says and we tonight we
[1:09:19] want to think that remember in the midst
[1:09:21] of all this cry God cannot send a
[1:09:24] Revival till he got men in shape to take
[1:09:28] it so men are the physical vessels and
[1:09:32] and and and and and body that God want
[1:09:34] to use we need man of God we need men
[1:09:39] that God could use and we are seeing
[1:09:41] that men that God is using he says we
[1:09:44] cannot send a Revival till he got men in
[1:09:46] ship to take it we cannot have a Revival
[1:09:48] until we get men God called men God
[1:09:53] trained men that's not train in School
[1:09:55] of Theology and education but rugged men
[1:09:58] of faith that God has brought up in the
[1:10:00] school of his rugged training men who
[1:10:03] are not afraid to face the fire men who
[1:10:06] has come in the presence of God and
[1:10:08] knows his power and knows his
[1:10:10] omnipotence and knows his healing power
[1:10:13] some men that strain to know the Living
[1:10:14] God it's all right to train them by the
[1:10:16] word but the letter kill it or the
[1:10:18] spirit give it life and before we can
[1:10:21] have this revival God has to call out
[1:10:23] and train man God trained man to carry
[1:10:27] this message and they don't care what
[1:10:29] the opposition is as brother Dilly said
[1:10:31] last night we meet the devil anywhere
[1:10:34] anytime any place on any cation we say
[1:10:37] licks like fire and licks like peas
[1:10:40] praise God it's licks praise God because
[1:10:42] God called us to do the same thing Jesus
[1:10:44] did destroy the works of the enemy
[1:10:47] hallelujah praise God so watch they are
[1:10:50] willing to go to the fiery furnace and
[1:10:51] defeat or to the Lion's Den wherever
[1:10:54] they may be they're ready to go because
[1:10:56] they have been in the presence of God
[1:10:58] and know that he is whether it's a
[1:11:00] victory defeat they still stand the same
[1:11:03] that's the same kind of training God
[1:11:04] does to men is very strange to think
[1:11:07] that God would do that but God trains
[1:11:09] his men like that but he does sometime
[1:11:12] God take a man for 30 years to give him
[1:11:14] a six months Ministry praise God a long
[1:11:18] long time for a certain purpose and I
[1:11:21] believe that all these men of God that
[1:11:22] stood here and spoke they were sent here
[1:11:25] here because there are seeds here and
[1:11:27] shs there that need to be ministered to
[1:11:30] and you be ministered to this morning so
[1:11:32] before Pastor ULU comes to minister to
[1:11:34] us we have a greeting from our precious
[1:11:37] Brother raymon Thompson uh he will greet

[1:13:28] God richly bless you I'd like to take
[1:13:31] scripture from John 1 verse1 17
[1:13:56] if you have
[1:13:57] it these words spake Jesus and lifted up
[1:14:01] his eyes to heaven and
[1:14:04] said father the hour is come glorify thy
[1:14:09] son that thy son Also may glorify thee
[1:14:13] may God add a blessing to the reading of
[1:14:15] his word you may be
[1:14:22] seated so uh I'd like to take a little
[1:14:26] thought here for the
[1:14:28] convention father the hour is
[1:14:32] come and Jesus was knew that his
[1:14:35] ministry was coming to a
[1:14:37] climax and he realized that his ministry
[1:14:40] on Earth was finished so he says father
[1:14:43] now right at this end time when my
[1:14:45] Ministry is finishing may you glorify me
[1:14:49] with the glory that I had with you
[1:14:51] before the foundation of the world he he
[1:14:54] needed something that hour to show the
[1:14:57] world that he comes from the father and
[1:14:59] he's going back to the father so I'd
[1:15:02] like to take a quote here out of the
[1:15:05] hour has come he says now Jesus was here
[1:15:07] speaking he said father the hour has
[1:15:10] come now there's seasons for everything
[1:15:13] do you believe that you sew in a certain
[1:15:16] season and you reap in a certain season
[1:15:20] and there Seasons when the times come
[1:15:22] that that's right for things to
[1:15:26] happen do you believe that Hallelujah so
[1:15:30] you see there's seasons for things to
[1:15:32] come so you can't sew in the time when

[1:40:55] you have your Bibles I'd like to invite
[1:40:57] your attention quickly
[1:40:59] to St Matthew
[1:41:02] 16 and also 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:41:19] 2 St Matthew 16 um I read verses 13 to
[1:41:25] verse 20 vers 13 to 20 and then 1
[1:41:28] Corinthians 2:
[1:41:29] 1-6 Matthew 16: 30- 20 read on these
[1:41:35] wise when Jesus came into the course of
[1:41:37] ceria Philippi he asked his
[1:41:41] disciples whom do man say that I the son
[1:41:43] of man
[1:41:45] am and they said some say that thou are
[1:41:47] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[1:41:50] Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[1:41:54] he said unto them but whom say ye that I
[1:41:57] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:42:00] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:42:02] Living
[1:42:04] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:42:07] blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh
[1:42:10] and Blood hath not revealed these unto
[1:42:11] thee but my Father which is in
[1:42:14] heaven and I see unto thee and I say
[1:42:17] also unto thee that thou art Peter and
[1:42:20] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:42:23] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:42:26] against
[1:42:27] it and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[1:42:29] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[1:42:32] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[1:42:34] in heaven amen and whatsoever thou
[1:42:35] shallal lose on Earth shall be loed in
[1:42:38] heaven then CH he his disciples that
[1:42:41] they should tell no man that he was the
[1:42:44] Christ amen and that's scripture
[1:42:48] um first time the word church is
[1:42:51] mentioned in the Bible and but this is
[1:42:54] the Lord himself speaking the one who
[1:42:58] owns the church The Shepherd of the
[1:43:00] sheep like Brother D spoke about last
[1:43:03] night and so he's given us in this
[1:43:05] scripture here is a little deeper from
[1:43:07] what brother Benham T us than maybe what
[1:43:10] regularly people look at but here is
[1:43:12] giving us a a a a foreshadow of what's
[1:43:17] going to be in the church
[1:43:19] ages right
[1:43:22] here because you'll see we'll get it
[1:43:24] later but you'll see the three things
[1:43:27] that must be in every church every
[1:43:29] Church the New Testament Church of the
[1:43:32] Lord Jesus
[1:43:33] Christ and the promise is the gates of a
[1:43:37] will come against it but we can rest
[1:43:39] assured it will not
[1:43:42] Prevail
[1:43:44] amen 1 Corinthians 2: 1-
[1:43:47] 16 and I Brethren when I came to you
[1:43:50] came know with Excellency of speech of
[1:43:54] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:43:56] of God for I determine not to know
[1:43:59] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:44:01] him
[1:44:02] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:44:05] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[1:44:08] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:44:10] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:44:13] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:44:16] yes sir that your faith should not stand
[1:44:19] in the wisdom of men Hallelujah but in
[1:44:21] the power of God yes how be it we speak
[1:44:26] wisdom among them that are
[1:44:29] perfect that would perfect there is
[1:44:32] people who are mature in understanding
[1:44:35] in character in
[1:44:40] Behavior even the hidden wisdom which
[1:44:43] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:44:47] Glory which none of the princes of this
[1:44:49] world knew for had they known it they
[1:44:52] would not have crucified
[1:44:53] the Lord Of
[1:44:55] Glory but as it is written I have not
[1:44:58] seen nor ear heard neither have entered
[1:45:01] into the heart of man the things which
[1:45:03] God ha prepared for them that love him
[1:45:05] but God ha revealed them unto us by his
[1:45:08] spirit for the spirit such all things
[1:45:11] yeah the Deep things of godu so that's
[1:45:15] why we thank God for brother Bram who
[1:45:17] came and brought some depth to the word
[1:45:20] of God more than regular Christianity we
[1:45:23] ordinarily
[1:45:26] have verse 11 for what man knoweth the
[1:45:29] things of a man seeth the spirit of man
[1:45:31] which is in him even so the things of
[1:45:34] God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[1:45:37] God now we have received not the spirit
[1:45:40] of the world
[1:45:42] intellect but the spirit which is of
[1:45:46] god that we might know the things that
[1:45:48] are freely given to us of God which
[1:45:51] things also we speak n in The Words
[1:45:53] which man's Wisdom teacheth but which
[1:45:56] the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[1:45:58] spiritual things with
[1:46:00] spiritual
[1:46:02] amen but the natural man receiveth not
[1:46:05] the things of the spirit of God for they
[1:46:07] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[1:46:10] know them because they're spiritually
[1:46:13] discerned you and I were natural men not
[1:46:17] in the sense that we are Canal there's a
[1:46:19] difference because we are flesh and
[1:46:21] blood and in our natur Natural State we
[1:46:24] can never understand spiritual things to
[1:46:27] understand spiritual things you need to
[1:46:28] come up a little
[1:46:30] higher and that's what he saying here
[1:46:32] because they're spiritually discerned
[1:46:35] amen verse 15 but he that is spiritual
[1:46:39] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[1:46:42] judged of no man so we are not natural
[1:46:46] men here now because Malachi first
[1:46:48] message is Gospel has revealed unto us
[1:46:52] had his t step up into that spiritual
[1:46:55] realm for who had known the mind of the
[1:46:58] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:47:01] have the man of Christ amen amen may the
[1:47:04] Lord add his Blessing the reading of his
[1:47:05] holy words let's just bow our heads want
[1:47:07] to prayer our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:47:09] we thank you once again for Grace to be
[1:47:12] here this

[1:53:30] Civ brother JC actually told him before

[1:53:39] down brother Paul thank you so much I
[1:53:41] mean you're always a blessing you can
[1:53:43] stay still when brother Paul is
[1:53:45] preaching and it was such a blessing
[1:53:50] yesterday amen and
[1:53:53] Brother D told you that that when we're
[1:53:55] in the room and he he was saying that um
[1:53:58] everything has been preached the
[1:54:00] ministers and all that so I said if you
[1:54:02] are seing that and I am coming after
[1:54:07] you so you can understand how I feel
[1:54:09] sorry for
[1:54:12] myself was it I was stand last
[1:54:21] night brother
[1:54:23] B thank you for the Del that was really
[1:54:26] really tremendous really
[1:54:29] tremendous what amazes me more than
[1:54:31] anything is how he does it without
[1:54:35] notes first time I mean we were together
[1:54:38] train here 2018 I asked him how do you
[1:54:40] do it and he tried to tell me how how I
[1:54:43] it still doesn't I still can't process
[1:54:45] it and brother Jason and I were talking
[1:54:47] yesterday he was here about almost one
[1:54:50] hour no notes
[1:54:53] if I have to do that you'll fall asleep
[1:54:56] because after 5 minutes I'm asking you
[1:54:58] so where was
[1:55:00] I so where was I brother da just goes on
[1:55:04] and on and on what a blessing Lord thank
[1:55:07] you brother D thank you so
[1:55:15] much so this morning I will
[1:55:19] um I mean I will try not to hold you on
[1:55:22] to long I mean I I will try don't don't
[1:55:28] um no I'm fine
[1:55:40] really so this morning I'll try not to
[1:55:42] hold you up too long um but I got a chle
[1:55:47] God in simplicity
[1:55:53] and um what have what I found
[1:55:57] very outstanding about the services
[1:56:00] because brother the brother the had said
[1:56:02] it a few years ago that he wants to get
[1:56:03] to the spot where for his conventions
[1:56:06] the ministers are free to preach what's
[1:56:08] on their hearts so this year I asked
[1:56:10] what was the theme he said no no theme
[1:56:12] just pre what's in your heart but you
[1:56:13] will see the Holy Spirit had a theme and
[1:56:16] all the
[1:56:17] messages DED to one another and Frankly
[1:56:20] Speaking because we all preach from the
[1:56:22] same Source the message of Malachi for
[1:56:25] so it's not unusual to have you know
[1:56:28] notes and messages you know run to one
[1:56:30] another like that and that's just been
[1:56:32] the tremendous thing about this
[1:56:33] convention here so I'll try to put my
[1:56:36] Shir at the wheel and speak a little bit
[1:56:37] on God and
[1:56:40] simplicity um and brother banham on the
[1:56:43] on the
[1:56:44] seals um the first thing he
[1:56:47] did March 177 Sunday morning 1963 was a
[1:56:52] pray the message God in
[1:56:54] Simplicity and God is so simple that
[1:56:58] human beings tumble over the
[1:57:00] Simplicity if it's so high up there it
[1:57:03] can be that simple but God created us
[1:57:06] and he knows we don't even have the
[1:57:08] capacity to to to to process his being
[1:57:12] so he knows the only way he can give us
[1:57:14] a chance to understand him at all is to
[1:57:16] come down and be the simple God that we
[1:57:20] understand him to be from brother Ben
[1:57:22] message because things of the spirit and
[1:57:25] the spiritual are a little complex for
[1:57:28] us human beings to understand and
[1:57:29] appreciate we can't appreciate them we
[1:57:32] can understand them like you said the
[1:57:34] natural man these things are are
[1:57:36] spiritually designed so he can never
[1:57:39] understand them we're natural Paul said
[1:57:43] I'm natural no good thing in me and we
[1:57:47] are wired mostly to see things before we
[1:57:52] understand them like they'll tell you
[1:57:55] that even when you hear things it's
[1:57:57] better if it's
[1:57:58] audiovisual when you can hear and see we
[1:58:02] we we do better when we see
[1:58:06] things don't be so hard on
[1:58:09] Thomas I mean Thomas disciple because
[1:58:11] Thomas said until I see the nail prince
[1:58:15] in his hands and I touch his sight I
[1:58:19] will not believe
[1:58:22] it if you and I were there we might even
[1:58:26] do
[1:58:27] worse because we are
[1:58:30] wired to believe only when we see but
[1:58:34] God is a spirit so how do you see God
[1:58:39] hallelujah should you help
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:44] us God knows I cannot meet these people
[1:58:47] for them to understand me in that realm
[1:58:50] they will never understand me
[1:58:53] because the things of the
[1:58:55] spirit are not easy for man to
[1:58:57] understand they are mysterious to man
[1:59:00] like we read in 1 Corinthians 2 and let
[1:59:03] me read verse 14 16 again but the
[1:59:05] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:59:07] the spirit of God for they are
[1:59:08] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:59:11] them because they are spiritually
[1:59:13] designed but he that is spiritual judges
[1:59:16] all things yet he himself is judged of
[1:59:18] no man for who had known the man of the
[1:59:21] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:59:24] have the man of Christ so he's telling
[1:59:27] us that even though we're in this body
[1:59:29] of Flesh we are not natural beings like
[1:59:32] that because we are God's children so we
[1:59:35] have the man of Christ so we can design
[1:59:38] and understand these spiritual things
[1:59:41] amen so God because he a
[1:59:44] Creator amen he knows that the things of
[1:59:47] the spirit and the natural things are
[1:59:49] not easy for us to understand knowing KN
[1:59:52] that God's whole being and purpose is to
[1:59:56] make the spirit and spiritual things
[2:00:00] easy for us to understand easy for us to
[2:00:02] appreciate Jesus with his disciples many
[2:00:05] when he will speak to them they can't
[2:00:06] get him so he will call them aside and
[2:00:09] break it down for them some more till
[2:00:11] when he was going away and he spoke to
[2:00:14] them about his going away they said now
[2:00:16] we understand
[2:00:20] you amen that's right so God that's why
[2:00:25] his nature is to
[2:00:27] simplify and break things down so we
[2:00:31] humans can
[2:00:35] understand somebody says now I don't
[2:00:38] understand God God has broken it down so
[2:00:41] much that anyone can
[2:00:44] understand he's not a complex God he's a
[2:00:48] simple God Amen
[2:00:52] and so all of the seemingly complex
[2:00:55] things about him about nature about all
[2:00:58] of his creation it simplifies and breaks
[2:01:02] them down so that we can
[2:01:05] understand and it's a principle in
[2:01:08] life the most impressive companies in
[2:01:12] the business World The Secret the TR
[2:01:17] secret is that they simplify things
[2:01:20] that's right when when when I not when I
[2:01:23] was growing up like maybe like 20 years
[2:01:26] ago you couldn't get your 10 year-old to
[2:01:30] work on your computer it was too
[2:01:32] complex you know this and all it was too
[2:01:36] complex but right now your one
[2:01:39] yearold will take an iPad and enter
[2:01:44] himself he would even password you don't
[2:01:46] know what's going
[2:01:47] on because it's so
[2:01:50] simple why did they together from from
[2:01:53] the
[2:01:54] scriptures from God even though they
[2:01:57] don't know it but that's where it's
[2:01:59] coming from because you look in all
[2:02:02] nature that's why God said to make us
[2:02:04] understand he said nature itself is your
[2:02:07] teacher and when you look in nature you
[2:02:10] can on brother bham said if you look in
[2:02:12] nature and you don't see God look again
[2:02:15] because God wants to make it so
[2:02:17] impossible for you not to see him not to
[2:02:21] understand so he makes even nature to
[2:02:23] scream at you about the person and the
[2:02:26] nature of God Amen so it's God's nature
[2:02:31] to break things down so that man can
[2:02:34] understand and there's so many things
[2:02:36] that we human beings cannot properly
[2:02:39] appreciate and comprehend when they're
[2:02:41] in whole for example I just want to show
[2:02:43] you examples here so God breaks them
[2:02:45] down for us and those things are wired
[2:02:47] into
[2:02:50] nature number number one a whole year is
[2:02:56] 365 days and it's 366 days in a liia
[2:03:00] every four years when we come at the
[2:03:03] entrance of a new year as far as God is
[2:03:06] concerned all that he is like doesn't
[2:03:09] even come to a minute that's right it
[2:03:12] sees it all he sees it sees all the way
[2:03:14] into
[2:03:15] eternity forever oh Lord th word is
[2:03:19] settled is sees into endless
[2:03:23] eternity but we can even see one
[2:03:27] day so God to help us appreciate the
[2:03:31] year he broke the year down for us into
[2:03:34] days and
[2:03:36] weeks and
[2:03:38] months to help us further he breaks the
[2:03:41] day down into hours and minutes and
[2:03:45] seconds that's how much our capacity can
[2:03:47] take we can't take anything more than
[2:03:50] that God God wants us to
[2:03:54] [Music]
[2:03:55] understand amen can you say amen
[2:03:59] amen I'm only talking to you and I
[2:04:01] really mean that because um there's
[2:04:04] nothing more to preach
[2:04:08] really no I'm fine I'm I'm I'm fine the
[2:04:11] minister has always encourage you so
[2:04:13] they they I'm fine so they so I'm I'm
[2:04:16] I'm encouraged I mean
[2:04:24] God also goes further in everything in
[2:04:27] nature I just want to show you a few
[2:04:28] examples he breaks down complex things
[2:04:31] in nature for example the whole human
[2:04:35] body he breaks it down can you imagine
[2:04:38] you and I came from a simple
[2:04:42] seed imagine if we were born this way
[2:04:51] it could not
[2:04:52] be but but it's God's
[2:04:56] wisdom he hid our members into that
[2:05:00] single
[2:05:02] cell from Mom and Dad and he hid all our
[2:05:06] members in there like Solomon said in
[2:05:09] Ecclesiastes who hit my bones in the
[2:05:13] womb can you imagine the way you are
[2:05:15] called up in the womb the bones like
[2:05:18] that that's the wisdom of God God in
[2:05:21] simplicity making it so simple that your
[2:05:23] mom and dad can have you and bring you
[2:05:25] into this wall
[2:05:27] here God's great
[2:05:29] wisdom amen amen amen and you could go
[2:05:33] on and on but you get the drift you get
[2:05:34] the you get the picture and no wonder
[2:05:37] Deuteronomy 29 and verse 29 says the
[2:05:40] things that are
[2:05:41] revealed belong unto us and to our
[2:05:44] children forever but the secret things
[2:05:46] belong unto God the things that we know
[2:05:50] now would have remained secret if God
[2:05:52] did not make them simple for us to
[2:05:56] understand
[2:05:58] Hallelujah yes sir so that
[2:06:03] background Jesus said St John 4:23 and
[2:06:07] vers 24 God is the spirit Hallelujah and
[2:06:10] they that worship Him must worship Him
[2:06:12] in spirit and in truth in other words
[2:06:16] the only way you worship
[2:06:19] God is in by
[2:06:22] spirit and by
[2:06:24] truth the spirit and the word because
[2:06:29] Thy word is
[2:06:30] truth what's he saying here God like you
[2:06:34] those of us in the message know God is a
[2:06:39] spirit everybody says that but brother
[2:06:42] Bram taught us hallelujah about these
[2:06:45] stages of Christian growth and
[2:06:47] experience let us understand and
[2:06:50] appreciate God at a deep richer level
[2:06:52] that we can apply to our lives
[2:06:56] amen John said in first John I have
[2:07:00] written unto you little children because
[2:07:03] you have known the father I written unto
[2:07:07] you young men
[2:07:09] because the word of God abides in
[2:07:13] you I WR to you fathers because you have
[2:07:17] known him that is from the beginning and
[2:07:20] you repeated it and added a bit more I
[2:07:22] know to you young men I mean little
[2:07:24] children because you have known the
[2:07:26] father I know to you little children
[2:07:30] because the word of God abides in you
[2:07:33] and you have
[2:07:34] overcome the wicked one I WR on to you
[2:07:37] fathers because you know him that is
[2:07:40] from the
[2:07:41] beginning knowing the father and knowing
[2:07:45] him that's from the beginning there are
[2:07:46] two different
[2:07:48] things the little children just know God
[2:07:52] maybe they give their hearts to the Lord
[2:07:54] and that's it but the young men go into
[2:07:57] the study of the world they are getting
[2:07:59] the word they reading the word and they
[2:08:01] are becoming stronger and stronger and
[2:08:04] stronger so they can fight the devil and
[2:08:07] keep the devil at B but where the real
[2:08:09] maturity is is Fathers and I don't have
[2:08:12] to be a father naturally to get to that
[2:08:14] spot it's just talking about Christian
[2:08:16] growth and maturity fathers who have
[2:08:18] known him that is from the beginning
[2:08:22] that's different from knowing the
[2:08:26] father and William bram's message
[2:08:29] presented to us God Hallelujah in the
[2:08:32] beginning before the beginning before
[2:08:34] the world ever was that's who the
[2:08:36] fathers are so this message was
[2:08:38] structured sent from God Almighty to
[2:08:41] bring you to maturity to bring you to
[2:08:44] Christian
[2:08:45] maturity so you can understand spiritual
[2:08:48] things Hallelujah can you shout
[2:08:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:54] amen
[2:08:59] amen
[2:09:01] God the great eternal
[2:09:05] spirit just let me take your mind back
[2:09:09] because we Are Spiritual now we are
[2:09:12] fathers in the gospel because Malachi
[2:09:15] for mage brought us to that level not
[2:09:17] because of anything that we've done
[2:09:19] there's nothing of ourselves but because
[2:09:22] he here his grace showed his grace CH us
[2:09:25] before the foundation of the world and
[2:09:27] nothing is going to PLU us out of his
[2:09:29] hands and so we can understand these
[2:09:31] things we can appreciate these things we
[2:09:34] know that God sent that Prophet Amen to
[2:09:36] take us into the Realms of the unknown
[2:09:39] Realms of the Unseen to where we can see
[2:09:41] God
[2:09:43] Amen in his glory hallelujah amen Elohim
[2:09:48] the great eternal spirit amen that's who
[2:09:51] who God is God is a
[2:09:54] spirit before the foundation of the
[2:09:56] world but we could not see him we could
[2:09:59] not appreciate spiritual spiritual
[2:10:02] things we can't do
[2:10:04] that so when you say God can descended
[2:10:08] to a flesh and became the
[2:10:11] word we think that's just what no it's
[2:10:14] God want to help
[2:10:18] us to understand him right
[2:10:25] amen so God with desires on his mind to
[2:10:28] have sons and daughters who will be like
[2:10:31] him who will be in his very
[2:10:33] image and knowing that we will never
[2:10:36] understand him if he was to reveal
[2:10:38] himself to us in his Spirit form so he
[2:10:42] condescended great eternal spirit he
[2:10:45] contracted himself that's what con means
[2:10:48] he just mean like he came down he
[2:10:50] contracted himself
[2:10:54] contracted
[2:10:57] himself into a
[2:10:59] body call the
[2:11:01] word when you are getting to the word
[2:11:04] now then is where you can because God
[2:11:06] made us he knows our medium of
[2:11:08] communication is by words so even though
[2:11:12] this
[2:11:12] be a spiritual body word but it's the
[2:11:18] word and the Bible tells us is at this
[2:11:22] part that God could make an image how do
[2:11:26] you capture the image of a spirit you
[2:11:29] could never do
[2:11:31] it so God condescended contracted
[2:11:36] himself into into the word form so that
[2:11:40] man can begin to get an idea of who he
[2:11:43] is that's whatam said but because God in
[2:11:47] Simplicity coming down to you and coming
[2:11:49] down to our level so that we might hon
[2:11:51] understand him I appreciate him and be
[2:11:53] able to have a relationship with him God
[2:11:56] knows he could never have a relationship
[2:11:58] with us if he stays in his Spirit form
[2:12:01] he comes right
[2:12:06] down
[2:12:09] amen so what he
[2:12:14] did he condescended and formed himself
[2:12:18] into a body of
[2:12:20] Flesh and that he did that in two
[2:12:23] steps first Elohim the spirit disguised
[2:12:28] himself as the lust word if you don't
[2:12:32] know that is God you'll say who is
[2:12:34] talking that's what they did to
[2:12:36] Jesus because Jesus disg God Elohim
[2:12:41] disguised himself Hallelujah and came on
[2:12:44] the earth and they did not know who he
[2:12:46] was because the natural man thinks if
[2:12:49] God want to come he will have this good
[2:12:51] train around him but God condescending
[2:12:53] to Men of low estate so that they can
[2:12:56] appreciate and know that's God that's
[2:12:58] God that's God oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:13:03] so firstly Elohim the spirit disguised
[2:13:07] himself as the as the lust word the
[2:13:10] seven P Holy
[2:13:12] Spirit Elohim
[2:13:14] disguised himself as the word of
[2:13:19] theophany he poured himself
[2:13:22] all of himself his seven spirits into a
[2:13:25] spirit
[2:13:26] body called the theophany the logos the
[2:13:30] word of God the spirit what body it's
[2:13:33] still Spirit but it's a body we against
[2:13:35] somewhere and when he got that body
[2:13:37] there then a body has a certain
[2:13:40] form not like this body here but it has
[2:13:43] a certain
[2:13:45] form Hallelujah when Moses said Lord
[2:13:49] show me thy Glory hallelujah hallelujah
[2:13:52] but B said the glory of God the
[2:13:54] theophany of God signs wonders Miracles
[2:13:57] he said Mo I hide you in the Rock and
[2:14:00] then you'll see my back patch when I go
[2:14:03] back past and Moses saw him he saw he
[2:14:07] said it was like the back parts of a man
[2:14:09] he has a certain form and brother said
[2:14:12] that's a
[2:14:13] theophany Hallelujah MC yes sir
[2:14:18] Hallelujah who made Abraham returning
[2:14:20] from his of the Kings it was M it was a
[2:14:25] theophany before he became Jesus
[2:14:30] Christ so he had a form so a theop had a
[2:14:34] form that we could capture and get an
[2:14:37] image of it let us make man in our image
[2:14:40] after our likeness he could never make
[2:14:42] an image of a spirit so he had to
[2:14:44] condescend to become the body the word
[2:14:47] body and then you can make an image of
[2:14:50] that Glory
[2:14:55] Hallelujah
[2:14:59] Hallelujah you may be
[2:15:01] seated and then number two this
[2:15:04] theophany word the lus the spirit
[2:15:08] word was be flesh and dwelt Among Us God
[2:15:13] going through a process for man to meet
[2:15:16] him to see him to talk with him to touch
[2:15:18] him have fellowship with him
[2:15:22] imagine God coming as a spirit people
[2:15:25] even you can't even stand it it dwells
[2:15:28] in in in in unapproachable
[2:15:30] light that's why Jesus said no man had
[2:15:33] seen God at any time only
[2:15:37] the the Barden of the
[2:15:43] father has shown you has expressed him
[2:15:47] has declared
[2:15:49] him God Amen in Simplicity Hallelujah
[2:15:53] coming down to our
[2:15:55] level that's why the Bible says though
[2:15:58] the Lord be high yet have he respect
[2:16:03] unto the lowly that's God's spirit
[2:16:05] that's his nature and that's what said
[2:16:09] you want to see how far you can get with
[2:16:11] God see how much humbler you can
[2:16:14] get oh that's why I C oh Lord make me
[2:16:17] the Revival the Revival in me make me
[2:16:20] more more humbler more dedicated more
[2:16:23] consecrated servant more positive more
[2:16:25] looking to the things that in the
[2:16:26] positive amen I'm forgetting the
[2:16:28] negative in the
[2:16:32] pastall so Jesus when he was here that
[2:16:36] was the spirit of God that was God the
[2:16:40] spirit became the lest word put on
[2:16:47] flesh and when he finish his job Jesus
[2:16:52] said I the word hallelujah I come from
[2:16:56] God to God and I go back to God again
[2:17:00] let's examine that I am the
[2:17:03] word I come from God the spirit I come
[2:17:07] from Spirit became the word and I'm
[2:17:10] going
[2:17:12] back to the word again I to the spirit
[2:17:15] again so he's telling you and I I come
[2:17:18] from Spirit to the word and I go back to
[2:17:23] the spirit form he not saying I'm going
[2:17:25] to go and sit on a chair next door to my
[2:17:28] father
[2:17:30] no I go back to the fatherhood the pill
[2:17:34] of fire that was through the Old
[2:17:35] Testament I go back in that form but no
[2:17:39] you haven't heard me yet the good part
[2:17:41] is that it's because of
[2:17:43] you he said because if I go another
[2:17:46] way the spirit will not come
[2:17:51] so because of you and I that's why he
[2:17:53] went away back into the spirit form so
[2:17:55] the spirit can come and on that
[2:17:59] understanding he told them go into
[2:18:00] Jerusalem hallelujah amen hallelujah
[2:18:04] because I'm going to come again yet a
[2:18:06] little while and the W shall not see me
[2:18:08] but you shall see me for I will be in
[2:18:12] you I will be with you even in you until
[2:18:15] the end of the world because it was
[2:18:16] going to come back as a
[2:18:18] spirit on the day of pentec because oh
[2:18:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:18:24] [Applause]
[2:18:32] hallelujah what he was doing here what
[2:18:35] he was doing here he was sh as a pattern
[2:18:37] because
[2:18:38] Jesus is only the
[2:18:41] firstborn among many
[2:18:44] Brethren many
[2:18:45] Brethren he's a first he a god he's a
[2:18:49] father he's a big brother
[2:18:52] is our bridegroom is our
[2:18:56] [Applause]
[2:19:01] everything
[2:19:04] so he had shown us that everyone that
[2:19:08] comes from God goes through that you
[2:19:10] come from Spirit to the word and back to
[2:19:14] Spirit again that's what this journey is
[2:19:17] all
[2:19:18] about that's why you could never be a
[2:19:20] Christian of the flesh it just is not
[2:19:24] going to
[2:19:25] work it's not going to work amen you may
[2:19:28] be
[2:19:29] seated Oh
[2:19:31] Glory so Jesus showed us our journey
[2:19:35] from Spirit to word back to Spirit
[2:19:40] again and the reason he had to go back
[2:19:44] was so that he could make a way possible
[2:19:47] for all of us to be there remember when
[2:19:49] he rose from the dead
[2:19:51] and Mary the the sister saw him like
[2:19:55] brother dang say they I never saw that
[2:19:57] before they they went with ounding
[2:20:02] fluidall to keep him there and they they
[2:20:05] I mean they they they loved him it was
[2:20:07] love that did it but that love was full
[2:20:10] of
[2:20:15] unbelief so when they saw him they
[2:20:18] wanted to touch him don't touch don't
[2:20:20] touch me don't touch me yes sir don't
[2:20:23] touch me before you can touch me before
[2:20:25] you can handle
[2:20:27] me and see I've got to go to my father
[2:20:32] Hallelujah and your
[2:20:35] father my God and your
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:42] God so I'm doing this for you
[2:20:51] Hallelujah because if I don't go away
[2:20:54] the spirit of the word that have taught
[2:20:57] you for three and a half years the
[2:20:59] spirit cannot come to turn you back into
[2:21:02] Spirit
[2:21:05] again if I don't go away the spirit will
[2:21:08] not come it's expedient it's obligatory
[2:21:12] it's necessary it's important that are
[2:21:15] go
[2:21:15] away or you remain in the same shape
[2:21:19] Jesus is telling us you need the
[2:21:22] spirit Hallelujah of God oh
[2:21:26] hallelujah
[2:21:30] amen that's the pattern so let's
[2:21:33] sumarize and summarize and recap
[2:21:36] here in Jesus Christ God the spirit
[2:21:40] became the word amen and became flesh
[2:21:43] amen and back to speed again I come from
[2:21:46] God I go back to God Amen
[2:21:51] why so that he can make sons of God like
[2:21:53] unto himself that's the purpose that's
[2:21:57] the purpose until he does that the
[2:21:59] purpose he died for to become the Good
[2:22:03] Shepherd of the sheep will not be
[2:22:10] complete so that he
[2:22:13] will make you and I Sons like unto
[2:22:17] himself because it was God's original
[2:22:20] son God's example s
[2:22:25] son and that's how the first Adam was
[2:22:31] made the first Adam how was he made just
[2:22:35] the same way because Jesus was formed in
[2:22:41] elohim's mind before the fish of the
[2:22:43] world because the Lamb of God was
[2:22:46] slain before Adam ever came so this
[2:22:49] process had gone on in God's mind he had
[2:22:52] figured out and plan it all out so Adam
[2:22:55] was displayed on the earth before Jesus
[2:22:57] but Adam came here a patent
[2:23:00] son like after
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:06] Jesus where some of our brothers get it
[2:23:08] wrong and say
[2:23:09] that Adam you know I mean people you
[2:23:13] know people said you know Jesus bypass
[2:23:15] his theophany no he did not Adam bypass
[2:23:18] his theophany Hallelujah
[2:23:25] that's so Jesus came from Spirit to word
[2:23:30] back to Spirit again in the beginning
[2:23:32] was the word and the Word was with God
[2:23:35] and the Word was God and the world was
[2:23:37] made flesh and dwelt among us when you
[2:23:40] come from there he said we beheld his
[2:23:43] glory the glor as of the only begotten
[2:23:45] of the father but
[2:23:49] Adam the image of
[2:23:52] God that word
[2:23:55] form God could form an image of the
[2:23:58] world so Adam was not the worth the
[2:23:59] offering Adam was an image of the
[2:24:03] word Adam was a word image the image of
[2:24:07] the world but Jesus was the
[2:24:10] expression of God
[2:24:12] himself there's a difference there amen
[2:24:15] well let's move along amen
[2:24:18] [Applause]
[2:24:21] but Adam went the same
[2:24:23] way
[2:24:24] from the
[2:24:26] [Applause]
[2:24:28] word elohim's spirit and Adam as a
[2:24:32] seting there plugged out and quited in
[2:24:36] the image of the
[2:24:39] world and then that image of the word
[2:24:42] was dropped into
[2:24:44] Eden dropped on the earth Genesis
[2:24:48] 1 the image of a seven Spirit word was
[2:24:52] placed in Adam's soul and in his soul
[2:24:55] was the spirit of Elohim but was a
[2:24:58] little seed of perfection in there the
[2:25:02] spirit contracted and condescended into
[2:25:05] Adam's soul and then then
[2:25:09] then
[2:25:11] because when you
[2:25:15] understand that God is only expressing
[2:25:17] himself to where we can understand him
[2:25:19] then you'll know you are not supposed to
[2:25:21] be a Christian of the flesh but a
[2:25:24] Christian of the spirit and when that is
[2:25:27] understood from Adam's example God
[2:25:31] expanded the word in Adam into Spirit
[2:25:35] Hallelujah when he put him in a body of
[2:25:42] Flesh the word image in Adam's Soul was
[2:25:45] expanded and anointed into his flesh to
[2:25:49] make him the word mid flesh
[2:25:50] and I'm a God on the face of the Earth
[2:25:54] because that was the original plan and
[2:25:57] Remains the plan even right
[2:26:00] [Applause]
[2:26:02] now and as it got on the earth
[2:26:06] Adam had come from Spirit to word the
[2:26:10] the word
[2:26:12] expounded into Spirit again and was
[2:26:15] placed in a body of fath the spirit of
[2:26:17] God was anointed into the Flesh of man
[2:26:20] amen that Spirit was in his soul as the
[2:26:22] word but it exploded expanded Beyond his
[2:26:26] soul into his Spirit into his flesh So
[2:26:30] Adam could walk around and this was God
[2:26:32] an amate God on the face of the Earth
[2:26:34] the spirit of God anointed into the
[2:26:37] Flesh of
[2:26:38] man that is the pattern oh
[2:26:42] Hallelujah as they got on the face of
[2:26:44] the Earth Adam had the Earth for an in
[2:26:47] inheritance he was a spirit man
[2:26:50] living a body of Flesh amen not a
[2:26:54] natural man not a canal man but a
[2:26:56] spiritual man who could design all
[2:26:59] things Hallelujah yet himself is Judge
[2:27:01] of no man the prince of this world
[2:27:02] cometh and he can find no place in me to
[2:27:05] do his evil work to do his evil thinking
[2:27:09] amen am thank you Jesus So Adam as a God
[2:27:13] on the earth he had the Earth for an
[2:27:16] inheritance and Adam was only the first
[2:27:18] one display play on the face of the
[2:27:21] Earth
[2:27:23] here
[2:27:25] sir and to prove his ownership he the
[2:27:28] ttle deed to the Earth The Book of Life
[2:27:31] In His Hands
[2:27:34] Hallelujah and spiritual men compare
[2:27:37] spiritual things with
[2:27:39] spiritual it runs through the whole
[2:27:41] Bible you don't get a Doctrine based
[2:27:43] upon one thing that's why I mean
[2:27:45] personally I don't do no quote words
[2:27:46] with anybody
[2:27:51] because you can make the quot say
[2:27:52] anything you want to
[2:27:55] say and these days of AI too you better
[2:27:58] know where you're
[2:28:00] standing a I will generate brother
[2:28:02] bram's voice for you and make him say
[2:28:05] things he did not say oh he never
[2:28:07] thought of
[2:28:10] that dark side of Technology but it
[2:28:13] doesn't matter to you when you know that
[2:28:15] it's not just based upon one thing
[2:28:17] you're running through the scriptures
[2:28:19] like brother J said last
[2:28:20] night he was F
[2:28:23] himself just said okay he passed this
[2:28:25] test pass this test but that crown on
[2:28:27] the head he doesn't line up from Genesis
[2:28:30] to
[2:28:38] Revelation So
[2:28:40] Adam had the Book of Life the tled it in
[2:28:43] his hands because brother bam said and I
[2:28:45] think you know I mean some read the
[2:28:46] quote yesterday and which you know those
[2:28:48] things I mean we're only trying to
[2:28:49] remind you of these things
[2:28:50] brother bham said
[2:28:53] Adam was absolutely a God on the face of
[2:28:57] the
[2:28:57] Earth you believe
[2:29:02] that and he said Adam lost the he said
[2:29:06] he had the title deed show me in
[2:29:09] Genesis where Adam had the title deed
[2:29:13] look at show me where it is show me
[2:29:15] where it says like that okay so Adam had
[2:29:16] the T he's going around Eden I have the
[2:29:19] T lead come to my house I'll bring out
[2:29:21] the drawer and show you like this is my
[2:29:23] titled
[2:29:27] it but he that is
[2:29:29] spiritual judges all things comparing
[2:29:33] spiritual things with spiritual can
[2:29:35] somebody say
[2:29:36] [Applause]
[2:29:44] amen amen when was that title dided
[2:29:50] Adam was told you have access to all
[2:29:53] every tree in the
[2:29:57] garden but one you don't have access to
[2:30:00] you should not touch I'm not going to
[2:30:01] force you is a tree of knowledge of Good
[2:30:04] and Evil but every other tree you can do
[2:30:07] anything he was veiling in there how
[2:30:11] access to the tree of life that was his
[2:30:14] ttle that was where the the contents the
[2:30:18] terms of the agreement was written
[2:30:23] have that in his hand didn't mean like
[2:30:26] he went to the tree and grabbed him
[2:30:27] because you know the tree was Jesus
[2:30:29] Christ you didn't grab him like that no
[2:30:31] he had
[2:30:34] access he was open to him when he say I
[2:30:37] have access it's open to you it's not
[2:30:41] closed he had access to that tree to the
[2:30:44] content to the terms of the
[2:30:47] mortgage Hallelujah
[2:30:50] so to prove his ownership Adam had the
[2:30:54] title to the Earth The Book of Life In
[2:30:56] His
[2:30:57] Hands meaning he had complete access to
[2:31:00] all the
[2:31:01] entitlements and brother Pam said on the
[2:31:04] seals Adam before the fall he was
[2:31:07] absolutely totally a God on the face of
[2:31:09] the
[2:31:11] Earth
[2:31:13] am how was this possible he came from
[2:31:16] Spirit in
[2:31:17] Elohim toward image back to Spirit
[2:31:21] again absolute Authority on the face of
[2:31:24] the Earth but Adam could speak Adam
[2:31:27] could name Adam could do whatever he he
[2:31:29] he wanted to do because he had the tle
[2:31:31] in his
[2:31:33] hand but then Adam Lost It All by sin
[2:31:36] his wife gave to the devil's
[2:31:38] reasoning and all access to the tree
[2:31:42] book of life T did was denied
[2:31:46] him access denied
[2:31:50] have you ever gone to the
[2:31:53] bank and you go
[2:31:56] there and they say there's a leon on
[2:31:58] your
[2:31:59] account access denied no withdrawal no
[2:32:03] withdrawal you can't get a
[2:32:07] thing so so you'll understand that this
[2:32:11] Bible this book of
[2:32:14] symbols am the benefit that we have that
[2:32:17] God sent us a
[2:32:18] prophet that can make the Bible come
[2:32:21] alive for
[2:32:22] us brother Bram made the word of God
[2:32:25] present tense to where you can relate to
[2:32:28] it it's not a story book it's a living
[2:32:31] word
[2:32:34] hallelujah Glory
[2:32:37] Glory oh
[2:32:39] hallelujah amen So Adam lost all access
[2:32:43] to the book to the title date to the
[2:32:46] tree of life he just lost his way he
[2:32:50] just lost he just didn't he just lost
[2:32:54] it but how did he lose access maybe see
[2:32:59] that he lost the access because
[2:33:03] God protected the title
[2:33:06] deed the tree of life and all its
[2:33:08] contents so that Adam will not be able
[2:33:12] to touch it in the state that he was in
[2:33:13] in the state he was before perfect
[2:33:16] perfection
[2:33:20] amen you know I've had it said like that
[2:33:23] you know how could Adam fall when he was
[2:33:28] perfect God's
[2:33:30] program because Lucifer was perfect he
[2:33:33] said you were
[2:33:35] perfect until in his ways until iniquity
[2:33:39] was found in thine
[2:33:42] heart so coming to Perfection doesn't
[2:33:44] give you an inability not to sin but
[2:33:47] gives you a power not to sin
[2:33:51] and that's the tattoo the will Lucifer
[2:33:54] gave his will away because he had sin
[2:33:58] creep into his
[2:33:59] heart oh
[2:34:02] Hallelujah So Adam how Adam lost access
[2:34:05] God protected the Tree of Life the title
[2:34:08] dead and all his contents by placing
[2:34:11] kobams on the back of the book The
[2:34:15] Eastern
[2:34:16] path now the Bible said
[2:34:19] God drove Adam out and said L the man
[2:34:22] the man has become as one of us knowing
[2:34:23] good and
[2:34:25] evil didn't mean like he's become like
[2:34:27] God like like like in that realm because
[2:34:30] God said let's make my an image so it
[2:34:31] was like God but he say it's become like
[2:34:33] one of all because Adam had no awareness
[2:34:35] of sin and wrong before that time but he
[2:34:39] had added this filthy Thing by going his
[2:34:41] own way that's what God means become
[2:34:43] like one of us so he not he's not
[2:34:46] something to desire
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:53] So
[2:34:54] Adam the man is like one of us L he put
[2:34:57] forth his hands and touch of the Tree of
[2:35:01] Life God said no we got to keep that
[2:35:03] from happening and then he put
[2:35:06] kobams on the Eastern path of
[2:35:11] Eden kobams with a flaming
[2:35:15] sword to protect the
[2:35:17] way of the Tree of Life
[2:35:20] hallelujah hallelujah and that's the
[2:35:23] spot right there when the book went back
[2:35:26] to the hands of the original owner he
[2:35:29] closed access and you'll go right down
[2:35:32] and see the book in Revelation 5 in the
[2:35:35] hands of Orin closed
[2:35:38] book it happened in
[2:35:46] Genesis and there the book remained
[2:35:49] until I day hallelujah hallelujah but
[2:35:53] God showed in different types and
[2:35:54] shadows through the Old Testament years
[2:35:57] what all of these
[2:35:58] represented like last night brother Dy
[2:36:01] was speaking so I mean mindblowing stuff
[2:36:04] about the Covenant and the cross going
[2:36:07] with them all the time do you realize
[2:36:10] that was God showing in type those
[2:36:14] kobams that's right at the back of the
[2:36:17] book it said the Eastern Eastern path
[2:36:19] Eastern
[2:36:20] G this is The Book of
[2:36:22] Life as we are sitting here now as we
[2:36:26] sitting here now from from my uh context
[2:36:28] here that's the north this is the South
[2:36:32] this is the West this is the East and
[2:36:35] the eastern part is the
[2:36:40] backside hallelujah
[2:36:43] hallelujah that's where those angels are
[2:36:46] so when you get into revation fact and
[2:36:47] you see I saw I mean saw either son
[2:36:50] there was a book in his hand written
[2:36:52] within and on the backside sealed with
[2:36:56] Seven Seals you know where is talking
[2:36:58] about that's why like brother de
[2:37:01] explained to us last night you couldn't
[2:37:03] touch
[2:37:04] Israel you couldn't crush them you
[2:37:06] couldn't put any enchantment on
[2:37:11] them
[2:37:13] hallelujah
[2:37:16] hallelujah so God showed this carobs on
[2:37:20] the
[2:37:24] backside in different types and shadows
[2:37:27] of the Bible amen the Old
[2:37:30] Testament like Brother D said
[2:37:33] representing the Redemption amen amen
[2:37:38] for
[2:37:39] Israel amen represented by the tree of
[2:37:42] life and those
[2:37:43] kobs angels representing the spirit of
[2:37:47] God Amen he was the spirit of God that
[2:37:50] stood there those angels Kims it didn't
[2:37:55] tell us how many they
[2:37:56] were but if you compare spiritual to
[2:37:58] spiritual you go to Revelation 5 and see
[2:38:01] the book in his hand and run about The
[2:38:04] Throne are those four beasts those four
[2:38:07] anointings in the North in the south in
[2:38:10] the West in the
[2:38:11] East Hallelujah are you with me
[2:38:20] and all through the Old Testament years
[2:38:22] the spirit of God will come down upon
[2:38:24] different ones for specific
[2:38:27] purposes showing the grace and the power
[2:38:30] veiled in the Redemption that Adam lost
[2:38:34] the grace and the power that he lost but
[2:38:37] not one of them came close to what Adam
[2:38:41] had in the Garden of Eden that was left
[2:38:43] for this day for this day Hallelujah
[2:38:47] that was left until the second Adam
[2:38:50] came
[2:38:51] Hallelujah Oh
[2:38:58] Glory so you notice I just want to
[2:39:01] emphasize this there was a tree of life
[2:39:04] and there were kobams on the back of the
[2:39:06] Tree of
[2:39:10] Life seven SE within inside the tree of
[2:39:13] life and seven sails on the back side
[2:39:16] amen making 14 Sals no
[2:39:19] the prophet Malachi fores showed us said
[2:39:22] six seals the seven seal silence my
[2:39:25] Brother Dan masterfully Brother
[2:39:28] yesterday but underneath that silence
[2:39:30] who had the authority but the prophet to
[2:39:32] take those seeds on the backside and put
[2:39:35] them inside the seventh written seal
[2:39:38] where it said silence he put He said he
[2:39:41] said it was silence in heaven but you
[2:39:43] know I know is the seven thunders in the
[2:39:46] book that's put in there Hallelujah am
[2:39:50] amen hallelujah hallelujah so we have
[2:39:52] the Tree of Life in Eden we have the
[2:39:54] tree of life back in amen Revelation
[2:39:56] again all through the Bible in the hands
[2:39:59] of original owner waiting for Redemption
[2:40:02] claims who is worthy to take the book
[2:40:04] and to lose the seven SE thereof who's
[2:40:08] worthy to do it can you do it hallelujah
[2:40:15] hallelujah no wonder they no wonder John
[2:40:18] weped
[2:40:20] knew this was how we got kicked out of
[2:40:24] Eden and John knew and John that's
[2:40:29] you know that the only way back to Eden
[2:40:33] the P Glory of Eden is somebody can take
[2:40:35] this book here and and get those angels
[2:40:37] in the back away from there and get us
[2:40:39] back into the tree of life
[2:40:41] again that's why John wept and the Elder
[2:40:45] cried don't weep
[2:40:46] John the lion of the tribe of Judah he
[2:40:50] had prevailed to take the book and to
[2:40:54] lose the seven SE thereof they went his
[2:40:57] teral did you hear what they said we are
[2:40:59] going back to Eden now they said we
[2:41:02] shall rain on the
[2:41:03] earth once he took the book that's it we
[2:41:06] shall rain on the earth we shall rain on
[2:41:09] the earth
[2:41:11] hallelujah oh
[2:41:15] brother amen excuse me can I remove my
[2:41:18] jacket
[2:41:32] you may be
[2:41:36] seated no man could pay the price until
[2:41:39] the second Adam came hallu so this is
[2:41:45] redemption problem with many of us in
[2:41:46] the message is we don't understand what
[2:41:49] we're talking about is not salvation is
[2:41:52] Redemption full total
[2:41:56] [Applause]
[2:41:59] [Music]
[2:41:59] [Applause]
[2:42:03] complete we can talk great stuff until
[2:42:07] we get a challenge like brother Esau
[2:42:09] told you about this
[2:42:10] morning when we get a challenge we
[2:42:12] running heal Skelter our faith flies
[2:42:15] away but if you watch brother brandham
[2:42:18] he lived in the realm
[2:42:19] to where Faith was just as normal as
[2:42:22] breathing for him he
[2:42:25] praised and no matter what happens he
[2:42:28] knows he's going to go if there's
[2:42:30] anything God will tell him maybe you
[2:42:33] need to get this sin out this out or
[2:42:38] whatever God in is that a complex
[2:42:45] God so when the second Adam came I don't
[2:42:48] want to go over all the
[2:42:50] things massively bother like I could
[2:42:52] never
[2:42:53] do when second Adam came he
[2:42:57] qualified to pay the
[2:43:00] price he was a king's man he was worthy
[2:43:03] and all the requirements NE for a
[2:43:05] kinsman redeemer
[2:43:09] amen he qualified to pay the to pay the
[2:43:12] price and to get back full and unfed
[2:43:16] access back to the tree of life again
[2:43:19] Amen to the ttle de to give us back full
[2:43:24] to Redemption so we can go back to where
[2:43:26] Adam
[2:43:27] was what a what a what a privileged
[2:43:29] people we are we are the ones that it
[2:43:31] has come down to that we can go back to
[2:43:34] Eden oh
[2:43:37] Hallelujah they without us cannot be
[2:43:40] made perfect oh
[2:43:43] Hallelujah Glory I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:43:46] trying to wind down amen I'm not I'm not
[2:43:48] finished I'm trying to wind
[2:43:51] outall in
[2:43:54] closing in closing but that's how we
[2:43:57] used to do when you he enclosing that's
[2:43:59] 2 hours
[2:44:01] more and it used to be a time like when
[2:44:04] you know we had our churches heart when
[2:44:06] you hear enclosing that's me I swe from
[2:44:10] here till here said enclosing is down to
[2:44:12] my knees we now en closing is down to my
[2:44:16] feet then we can close
[2:44:19] that takes like 6 hours 6 hours 6 hours
[2:44:23] of a short
[2:44:28] message but we we we we're growing we
[2:44:32] we're
[2:44:42] learning so when the second Adam came
[2:44:45] God but Man Came Death Hallelujah and by
[2:44:49] man came also the resurrection from the
[2:44:53] dead one man
[2:44:55] sinned like in the Old Testament they'll
[2:44:57] say like that why should one man did
[2:44:59] something wrong and then the whole whole
[2:45:01] place is judged that's the story of
[2:45:03] redemption one man
[2:45:06] sinned Israel was judged one man paid
[2:45:09] the price we are all free we don't have
[2:45:11] to go and die on the cross
[2:45:16] again the wisdom of God just receive it
[2:45:20] Glory Glory
[2:45:22] [Applause]
[2:45:25] Glory so when the second Adam came he
[2:45:27] qualified to pay the prize to get back
[2:45:30] full and unfettered access to the book
[2:45:32] for
[2:45:33] us
[2:45:35] Lord and what is
[2:45:38] it those angels are there Hallelujah at
[2:45:41] the back of the book it will take
[2:45:43] somebody who had the price like brother
[2:45:44] Del said lift up your head all he gets
[2:45:48] ACC say was the night here it was closed
[2:45:51] it would take somebody who had paid the
[2:45:53] price who was qualified to go there and
[2:45:56] remove those shes on the back of the
[2:45:58] book William bham couldn't do it no man
[2:46:01] could do it only one could do it that's
[2:46:03] why the lamb has prevailed to take the
[2:46:07] book and tear open those seals on the
[2:46:09] back and those angels will open up for
[2:46:12] him and he will go right in into the
[2:46:15] terms and the contents amen the terms of
[2:46:18] agreement of of your of your mortgage
[2:46:20] your title date to the earth oh
[2:46:24] Hallelujah he will take those angels on
[2:46:27] the back of the
[2:46:28] book representing the fullness of the
[2:46:31] spirit of God to provide that access and
[2:46:35] take
[2:46:36] somebody who the gates will open to and
[2:46:40] so when Christ second Adam died and paid
[2:46:43] the price to get the book to get the
[2:46:46] title back back for us he got the book
[2:46:48] back
[2:46:50] and that's why you see the book
[2:46:53] amen open in Revelation
[2:47:00] 10 Hallelujah but he still stayed even
[2:47:04] though he had paid the
[2:47:06] price and access to the book is now
[2:47:10] open he did not give it back to us right
[2:47:13] away like he did to
[2:47:16] Adam because Adam he said
[2:47:19] of every tree in the garden including
[2:47:21] the Tree of Life the tell you can go
[2:47:23] there
[2:47:24] anytime Adam he was ready made for God I
[2:47:27] mean for
[2:47:28] Adam but he didn't do you this time
[2:47:34] Hallelujah He restored those angels on
[2:47:37] the back represent the fullness of the
[2:47:38] spirit what are those angels brother bam
[2:47:41] showed us there they are in Revelation
[2:47:44] 5 there they were brother Del show you
[2:47:47] yesterday showed you the
[2:47:49] the tribal arrangements and in there it
[2:47:52] showed you the anointings Through the
[2:47:53] Ages showed you Luke and Martin and and
[2:47:56] all that and things like that and
[2:47:57] brother bham show those angels that
[2:47:59] beasts the
[2:48:01] powers amen through seven Church
[2:48:04] ages God's
[2:48:06] spirit so God's going to let it drip
[2:48:09] through seven Church AG upon this work I
[2:48:11] will build my church so this is the
[2:48:13] building here he doing the building
[2:48:19] he didn't give the access right away but
[2:48:21] restor the fullness of the spirit into
[2:48:24] the church through seven
[2:48:26] dispensational Church
[2:48:29] ages how the same way the spirit of God
[2:48:34] disguised as the word of God every
[2:48:38] messenger of the age Hallelujah was
[2:48:40] representing a portion of a spirit of
[2:48:42] God to their
[2:48:44] age the mystery of Christ they
[2:48:47] represented it and they came in the
[2:48:50] ages amen and came as a word
[2:48:56] message and they received the word
[2:48:59] message the seeds of God the seeds of
[2:49:02] God in that Age receive that word what
[2:49:05] were they receiving like Adam it was the
[2:49:07] spirit of God
[2:49:09] condescending cont to
[2:49:17] word and just like you saw the pattern
[2:49:19] like Jesus showed us they receive the
[2:49:22] word you can receive the word he said if
[2:49:26] the word be received it has got to be
[2:49:33] manifested and the manifestation is the
[2:49:36] holy spirit that's where brother benam
[2:49:38] is coming from where he said every age
[2:49:40] have the mechanics the word and the
[2:49:43] Dynamics for their age Adam had it for
[2:49:47] his age
[2:49:49] [Applause]
[2:49:51] Adam Genesis 126 was his mechanics
[2:49:54] Genesis 27 was his Dynamics to anoint
[2:49:57] the spirit of God into his
[2:50:00] [Music]
[2:50:06] flesh so in every
[2:50:10] age the spirit was there it was this
[2:50:13] Spirit to drive you back to the Tree of
[2:50:16] Life hallah Hallelujah he didn't drive
[2:50:19] them back and they got everything they
[2:50:20] know little by little he was driving
[2:50:22] them back to the Tree of Life
[2:50:25] Hallelujah and send messenger with a
[2:50:27] portion of that Spirit go out to the
[2:50:30] people with the mystery of
[2:50:32] God God said the mystery of God should
[2:50:34] be finished it was all through seven
[2:50:36] Church ages oh Hallelujah Glory
[2:50:41] Glory
[2:50:45] Glory so what you be seated I'm I'm I'm
[2:50:50] trying to wind on here
[2:50:58] seriously if you tickle me I'll go
[2:51:01] on brother Jesse if you tickle me I'll
[2:51:04] add one more
[2:51:09] hour all right but you f show your
[2:51:15] Redemption so here was the king man
[2:51:20] Redeemer he had won it back the book
[2:51:22] went to his
[2:51:25] hand but Redemption claims need to be
[2:51:28] made that's right somebody who
[2:51:31] could access that book and take that
[2:51:33] book that's I paid the price for
[2:51:36] this and our Kingsman Redeemer did
[2:51:40] it he gave his life share his blood PID
[2:51:44] the
[2:51:46] price so that we could he had W it back
[2:51:51] for us they R back to that tree of life
[2:51:52] he had W it back for us but he wasn't
[2:51:55] going to do it the way he did it before
[2:51:57] just was D there because the problem for
[2:51:59] Adam was he didn't need to
[2:52:02] grow Adam was just made in a Hallelujah
[2:52:05] perfect
[2:52:06] state it need to grow Hallelujah the
[2:52:09] spirit of God was just there seven
[2:52:12] spirits of God on the inside of him
[2:52:14] Perfection was on the inside of
[2:52:16] him that's why even though he was in a
[2:52:20] perfect State he didn't really
[2:52:22] appreciate so much what he had
[2:52:24] definitely not
[2:52:27] Eve so Jesus God himself said this time
[2:52:32] around we're going to take them through
[2:52:34] a process of
[2:52:37] growth we're going to grow them from
[2:52:39] church age to church age to church age
[2:52:41] to church age and the same way we are
[2:52:44] going to grow the individuals in every
[2:52:45] Church age same way because the way he
[2:52:47] grows his IND idual is the way he grows
[2:52:49] his church
[2:52:52] ages that's why you're not going to grow
[2:52:54] overnight it's going to take
[2:52:57] time it takes discipline consecration
[2:53:01] dedication you're not going to put it
[2:53:03] like AI let me grow and become a stature
[2:53:06] of a perfect man it's not going to work
[2:53:07] that way some things in life just take
[2:53:10] time relationships take time no AI is
[2:53:14] not going to make it a woman deliver in
[2:53:16] two months no it's not going to happen
[2:53:19] some things take
[2:53:21] time Hallelujah growth takes time that's
[2:53:25] why he did not give you to us all at
[2:53:27] once going to be like little here a
[2:53:29] little there a little so that the church
[2:53:31] WIll mature will become
[2:53:33] seasoned
[2:53:35] seasoned season in character character
[2:53:38] growing in them growing in Grace into
[2:53:41] the stature of Jesus Christ
[2:53:45] Hallelujah GL but what was it it was the
[2:53:48] spirit of God disgu as the word message
[2:53:51] in Paul's age in arenus age in Martin
[2:53:53] all down through the Old Testament I
[2:53:55] mean through the New Testament Church
[2:53:56] ages Jesus building his church Upon This
[2:53:59] Rock I'll build my church and the Gates
[2:54:02] of Hell shall not Prevail against
[2:54:08] it I don't have to go over that but show
[2:54:11] he Dem marketed that devil last
[2:54:13] night Dem marketed
[2:54:17] him sh I will tell you no more it's easy
[2:54:19] for me to say this after last night the
[2:54:23] devil is not even in the
[2:54:24] [Applause]
[2:54:25] [Music]
[2:54:27] [Applause]
[2:54:38] picture so what was it God was rest
[2:54:42] showing back the fullness of the spirit
[2:54:44] in the church ages through seven
[2:54:45] dispensations of the seven churches God
[2:54:49] sending the fullness of the spirit down
[2:54:51] in seven steps through the church ages
[2:54:54] not in one hole as he did with Adam
[2:54:56] where did Brother bham get this from
[2:54:58] show me in the Bible where he got this
[2:55:00] from
[2:55:02] Hallelujah
[2:55:06] yeah Glory because people
[2:55:10] say I want a quote I won't make brother
[2:55:13] B my absolute the Bible is my absolute
[2:55:17] good good Bible scholar very
[2:55:23] good like brother J was yesterday just
[2:55:26] Jonah in I never saw that Jonah in the
[2:55:27] belly of a of a
[2:55:32] fish
[2:55:34] oh go and tell them in
[2:55:37] your in your exam that a whale is a
[2:55:40] fish and tell them that
[2:55:48] whale is a
[2:55:49] mammal is a mammal is in our class of
[2:55:52] category it's not it's not not so so
[2:55:54] let's we are talking spiritual things
[2:55:56] now among spiritual
[2:55:58] people this brother Bram got that here
[2:56:01] hallelujah in Paul's age he's releasing
[2:56:04] s of the spirit the spirit of God Came
[2:56:06] Upon Paul as the messenger to that age
[2:56:08] to show him the message for the hour
[2:56:11] like brother de said the pill of fire
[2:56:13] speaking to Paul running through the
[2:56:15] whole Bible and brought a message out
[2:56:18] Hallelujah he wrote almost the entire
[2:56:20] New
[2:56:23] Testament the spirit of God
[2:56:25] condescending into a word message disg
[2:56:28] as a word message in Ephesians Church
[2:56:30] age and it went on into arenus amen
[2:56:35] Colombia Wesley and all the way down God
[2:56:39] adding one more one more one more adding
[2:56:42] more and more and more but they all left
[2:56:45] Loose Ends
[2:57:03] [Music]
[2:57:07] hallu
[2:57:10] so God Through the
[2:57:14] Ages the Fulfillment of the words of
[2:57:16] Jesus Upon This Rock
[2:57:19] of the reation of who Jesus is your
[2:57:21] Redeemer your lord I will build my
[2:57:25] church and it's going to be a building
[2:57:28] you don't build it one day it was
[2:57:29] building this through seven Church ages
[2:57:31] hallah and the Gates of Hell shall not
[2:57:34] Prevail against it they boil them in hot
[2:57:38] oil they cut off their heads amen like
[2:57:41] brother Jesse was saying the other night
[2:57:42] all kinds of things but the church kept
[2:57:44] marching on hallelujah hallelujah
[2:57:49] the devil is no match not because of us
[2:57:51] but greater is he that is in us than the
[2:57:54] devil in the world that's trying to stop
[2:57:55] us he cannot stop
[2:57:58] you he cannot stop the bride all
[2:58:04] right so Jesus did it the way so we can
[2:58:08] grow and not have it dropped on our laps
[2:58:10] like it was dropped on Adam's laps so we
[2:58:13] want Freer either way because easy come
[2:58:16] easy go amen
[2:58:19] amen so the church ages so we can mature
[2:58:23] the church can
[2:58:25] mature the IND can mature and
[2:58:28] grow growing up into Christ and develop
[2:58:32] character how be will speak wisdom among
[2:58:36] them that are perfect among them that
[2:58:38] are maturing in christall oh
[2:58:42] hallelujah
[2:58:44] amen
[2:58:46] amen so since before God built in this
[2:58:49] growth and so every age had the word
[2:58:53] every church had the word but in not in
[2:58:57] full but a portion of the
[2:58:59] word and the spirit of God to anoint
[2:59:03] that word for a manifestation because
[2:59:06] they had to go from Spirit the spirit of
[2:59:08] God in the
[2:59:10] age like Paul's Faith the spirit of
[2:59:13] Faith the mystery of Faith Hallelujah
[2:59:16] and Paul went and let the found
[2:59:18] all the way right back down to the man
[2:59:20] of God and laid it
[2:59:22] down all the way down to the new city
[2:59:25] that's
[2:59:26] right but Paul died I think 8060 or 865
[2:59:30] or somewhere around
[2:59:35] there but the church was still moving
[2:59:39] on so each age had the Spirit come upon
[2:59:44] the messenger and it the spirit dis guys
[2:59:48] as the word message to the
[2:59:50] age but it means nothing until that word
[2:59:53] goes back to Spirit for a manifestation
[2:59:56] that's why he said every age had the
[2:59:59] mechanics the word and the Dynamics the
[3:00:02] word back into Spirit again every age
[3:00:04] had
[3:00:05] it Luther had the mechanics and Dynamics
[3:00:08] for his day Wesley had them the
[3:00:10] Pentecostals had them how about
[3:00:13] day he said the BR should be fully grown
[3:00:16] up Hallelujah ready to go meet Christ
[3:00:19] with the
[3:00:20] manifestation of every divine blessing
[3:00:23] that he promised in the world Hallelujah
[3:00:26] shout
[3:00:27] hallelujah oh
[3:00:30] Hallelujah Glory so each age had his
[3:00:34] mechanics and Dynamics may be
[3:00:36] seated amen as Jesus actually
[3:00:40] foreshadowed in that great discussion in
[3:00:43] s Matthew 13 who do Man say that I the
[3:00:47] son of man I am
[3:00:48] the son of man representing the word in
[3:00:53] every
[3:00:54] age who do men say that I this a
[3:00:59] man some say you are Jeremiah some say
[3:01:01] you are this and some say you are that
[3:01:03] but who do ye the spiritual ones sh that
[3:01:08] I am thank you
[3:01:11] Lord and Peter said thou the son of man
[3:01:16] Thou Art the Christ Christ the son of
[3:01:19] the Living God is a revelation in there
[3:01:23] put together with the me from Malachi
[3:01:25] 4ah what is it that conversation was not
[3:01:29] just for them it was a conversion that
[3:01:30] covered all seven Church ages
[3:01:33] hallelujah what is it each age like I'm
[3:01:37] trying to explain had the word very the
[3:01:40] son of man to the age the word to the
[3:01:43] age which you know the word is the
[3:01:45] spirit to that age disguise as the
[3:01:47] Worden as the message of that age so
[3:01:50] each it had the the word the son of
[3:01:54] man each it had the
[3:01:57] Christ the anointing the spirit to the
[3:02:02] word and each age the mechanics and
[3:02:05] Dynamics together produced the son of
[3:02:08] God in the church ages that's how you
[3:02:10] come about the son
[3:02:12] Jesus he was son of man when he came he
[3:02:15] was Son of God through the church ages
[3:02:17] that's how it
[3:02:20] [Applause]
[3:02:24] come so each age had son of man who do
[3:02:27] Man say that I the son of man
[3:02:30] am thou are the
[3:02:32] Christ each had son of man Christ the
[3:02:36] anointing son of man the mechanics the
[3:02:39] word Christ the anointing the
[3:02:43] Dynamics to the
[3:02:46] mechanics and together produced the son
[3:02:49] of God the seed of God in that age every
[3:02:53] age had that every age had that son of
[3:02:56] man the Christ the son of the Living God
[3:02:59] hallelujah hallelujah oh every age has
[3:03:02] the mechanics and Dynamics for their
[3:03:05] day oh
[3:03:07] Hallelujah
[3:03:10] glory

[3:03:16] man brother bam said add to your

[3:05:59] manifest knowledge virtue all the way
[3:06:01] down and
[3:06:02] produce a Son of God in the age the
[3:06:06] mechanics and Dynamics for every
[3:06:09] age and they without us could not be
[3:06:13] made perfect oh brother
[3:06:17] [Applause]
[3:06:24] so every you send messenger after

[3:07:31] same way he said this men had no certain
[3:07:36] mystery Paul had the mystery of Faith to
[3:07:39] go and go all the way down to the
[3:07:41] bibleall
[3:07:44] and reveal the entire book write the new
[3:07:47] t
[3:07:49] arenus Martin all the way
[3:07:52] down when he came to Malachi for the
[3:07:56] brotherly can's age Leia he said this
[3:07:59] messenger has no certain
[3:08:04] mystery but what he
[3:08:06] has is to go all the way back and tap
[3:08:10] all the Loose
[3:08:11] Ends the things that they left like
[3:08:14] brother de said last night Luther said
[3:08:17] the Jews are Antichrist Luther will
[3:08:19] smoke a cigar and yet he was Messenger
[3:08:21] to the
[3:08:25] age but this is were not open to them so
[3:08:28] all those loose
[3:08:31] ends this Messenger to Le this
[3:08:34] here had no certain
[3:08:39] certain but just like John the Baptist
[3:08:42] was sent to forun the first coming of
[3:08:45] Christ to make the high places low to
[3:08:48] make the low Valleys High Malachi for
[3:08:51] was sent to make the high places low
[3:08:53] make the low Valleys High to go all the
[3:08:56] way down and dig up all the Los ends and
[3:09:00] tie them up so there'll be no leakage
[3:09:02] anywhere in the
[3:09:04] building make the place ready for the
[3:09:07] coming of the Lord hallelujah as John
[3:09:10] the Baptist was sent to forun the first
[3:09:12] coming of Christ so you have been sent
[3:09:14] to forun the second coming you have to
[3:09:16] tie up those losen to make the high
[3:09:18] places Low Low Places high so the Lord

[3:17:13] they couldn't go in the Rapture you know
[3:17:15] the reason why those Angels on the back
[3:17:18] of the book how to give because the
[3:17:20] Rapture I mean going back to Eden where
[3:17:23] Adam was is on the other side of the
[3:17:27] Rapture and they didn't leave long
[3:17:29] enough to take the Rapture that's right
[3:17:33] and Malachi for when he finished his job
[3:17:35] as a seventh
[3:17:38] angel SEL the Bible say
[3:17:42] 10 yesterday silence in
[3:17:45] heaven that was symbols Hallelujah but
[3:17:48] the activity was in Revelation
[3:17:50] 10 when he had finished Hallelujah TI of
[3:17:53] the
[3:17:54] losing the Lord can say it now he's
[3:17:57] ready to come down in the coming of the

[3:18:57] so much about what are the Thunders I
[3:18:59] believe is I believe that it's not

[3:19:06] hallu because the seven Thunders on the
[3:19:10] back of the book is what's going to
[3:19:11] provide access Back to

[3:19:18] on the sales and see what it's all about

[3:19:59] seal I know what I believe them to they
[3:20:02] and I can prove it to if you sit and
[3:20:03] talk together but that's not my point
[3:20:05] here Malachi for revealed the Thunders

[3:21:08] pres to come I must decrease and he must
[3:21:12] increase he's been here all the time but

[3:22:18] age when all all the losers have been
[3:22:21] tied
[3:22:22] up and the seventh
[3:22:25] angel has brought all down to the
[3:22:27] revelation of a son of man the unfailing
[3:22:30] body word of a son of man when the Lord
[3:22:33] himself comes down from heaven the Lord
[3:22:36] himself he has to use
[3:22:39] somebody and he only found one man he
[3:22:42] could use the prophet William bham who
[3:22:45] just finished his job as the messenger
[3:22:47] to Le this year so he veiled in him and
[3:22:50] you'll find that in Revelation
[3:22:54] 10:7 in the days of the voice of the
[3:22:57] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[3:23:01] sound this other message Hallelujah the
[3:23:04] mystery of God through seven Church ages
[3:23:07] should already be finished by that time

[3:23:50] in the third pool Ministry not in the
[3:23:52] open not a Shore in
[3:23:55] [Music]
[3:24:00] secret on the seals but B put to about
[3:24:04] the 10
[3:24:06] vision and I said when I went in there
[3:24:09] he said the angel what he told me I'll
[3:24:11] keep it in my bosom until I go to meet
[3:24:15] him and he also talked in there about
[3:24:19] the seven Thunders under the seventh
[3:24:20] seal Hallelujah and all the place said
[3:24:23] the seventh
[3:24:26] seal amen Mysteries revealed opening of
[3:24:30] the word like is so beautifully
[3:24:32] explained when he rose from the dead he
[3:24:34] did something that he always did in the

[3:24:39] word the hidden
[3:24:41] mysteries of how to go in this rapture
[3:24:47] hallelujah
[3:24:50] hallelujah so if you don't get that
[3:24:52] clear you'll mix brother bham
[3:24:54] up he was mentioned to Le this here and
[3:24:57] then Jesus veiling him to Usher You Back

[3:25:33] is capped by the seven
[3:25:35] [Music]
[3:25:37] Thunders are we ready to go to go out
[3:25:39] into Rapture and all all of those quotes
[3:25:42] there because this this the totally
[3:25:45] different this is the mystery Christ
[3:25:47] himself Hallelujah opening the word to
[3:25:49] you and you recognize him in the opening
[3:25:52] of the
[3:25:56] word and here we
[3:25:59] are what is
[3:26:01] it the spirit of Christ in the church
[3:26:03] Ages was there as the baptism of the
[3:26:05] Holy Ghost in every age but in this age
[3:26:08] here is not just the baptism of the Holy
[3:26:11] Ghost it's the fullness I read it to you
[3:26:15] of the spirit
[3:26:17] coming to the fullness of the world to
[3:26:20] manifest the fullness of the body to
[3:26:23] cause the dead in Christ to rise
[3:26:25] up they without us cannot be made
[3:26:28] perfect because they didn't live long

[3:27:29] here Malachi 4 has decreased and Jesus
[3:27:33] has increased that's why he said I was
[3:27:35] not the one that did these
[3:27:37] things I was only representing

[3:27:45] things is God's
[3:27:48] spirit to bring it down to the fullness
[3:27:50] of the spirit upon the fullness of the
