[9:02] in jesus mighty ask it email and amen
[9:05] god bless you
[9:06] thanks again for being here and um if
[9:09] you have your bibles i like to look at
[9:11] ephesians chapter one and revelation
[9:14] chapter two
[9:14] ephesians one we want to read from one
[9:16] to fourteen
[9:18] revelation two you want to read from one
[9:20] to seven to ninth
[9:22] i want to take a peek at ephesians god's
[9:25] pattern
[9:26] and overview tonight we want to take a
[9:28] look at that
[9:30] ephesians in the book of ephesians
[9:31] quotes pattern
[9:33] and overview and we want to read from
[9:36] ephesians chapter one
[9:38] reading from verse one paul an apostle
[9:40] of jesus christ by the will of god
[9:42] to the saints which are at ephesus and
[9:45] to the faithful in christ jesus
[9:46] grace be to you and peace from
[9:50] god our father from the lord jesus
[9:51] christ blessed be the god and father of
[9:54] our lord jesus christ what blessed us
[9:56] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[9:58] places in christ
[10:00] notice this is a given
[10:03] adoration and praise to god and
[10:06] testifying of what god has done in
[10:09] christ jesus
[10:10] according that he had chosen us in him
[10:12] before the foundation of the world
[10:14] that we should be one holy and two
[10:17] without blame
[10:18] before him in love having predestinated
[10:21] us
[10:22] so all this is god's operation now this
[10:24] has nothing to do with us and you are
[10:25] sinner
[10:26] and saved by grace this is god's plan
[10:28] and program
[10:29] having predestinated us unto the
[10:32] adoption of children
[10:33] by jesus christ to himself according to
[10:36] the good pleasure of his will
[10:38] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[10:40] wherein he had made us
[10:42] accepted and beloved in whom we have
[10:44] redemption through his blood
[10:46] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[10:48] riches of his grace
[10:49] all of this is still in christ jesus
[10:51] wearing he had a bounty towards
[10:52] us in all wisdom and prudence having
[10:55] made known unto us the mystery of his
[10:57] will
[10:58] according to his good pleasure which he
[11:01] had purpose in himself
[11:03] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[11:05] of times
[11:06] he might gather together in one all
[11:09] things in christ
[11:10] both which in heaven which are on earth
[11:13] even in him in whom also we have
[11:15] obtained an inheritance
[11:17] being predestinated according to the
[11:19] purpose of him who look at all things
[11:22] after the council of his own will that
[11:24] we should be to the praise of his glory
[11:26] who first trusted in christ in whom you
[11:29] also trusted
[11:30] after you heard the word of truth the
[11:32] gospel of your salvation
[11:34] in whom also after you believe you were
[11:37] sealed
[11:38] with that holy spirit of promise which
[11:41] is the earnest or the down payment of
[11:43] our inheritance
[11:44] until the redemption of the purchased
[11:47] possession
[11:48] unto the praise of his glory i want to
[11:50] look at revelation chapter two
[11:52] reading from verse one if you have your
[11:54] bibles you should have your bibles this
[11:56] is the bible study
[11:59] revelation 2 verse 1
[12:02] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[12:04] right
[12:06] these theater these things said he
[12:09] that who led the seven stars in his
[12:11] right hand
[12:12] who walk it in the midst of the seven
[12:15] golden candlesticks
[12:16] i know that works and i labor
[12:20] like patience hold up stance not be
[12:23] them which are evil i was try them would
[12:25] say the apostles and are not
[12:28] as found them liars as born as
[12:31] patients of my namesake as labored has
[12:34] not
[12:35] fainted nevertheless i have somewhat
[12:38] against thee
[12:39] because thou has left thy first love
[12:41] remember
[12:42] therefore from wednesday what foreign
[12:44] and repent
[12:46] and do the first works or else i will
[12:49] come unto thee quickly and remove that
[12:51] candlestick except
[12:53] out of his place except or repent
[12:56] what this dog has the dog hate is the
[12:59] deeds of the nicoleta
[13:01] which i also hate now when this age was
[13:04] a deed
[13:05] later only became a doctrine those seven
[13:07] heathers have an ear
[13:08] let him hear what the spirit says unto
[13:11] the churches to him that overcome it
[13:13] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[13:16] which is in the midst of the paradise
[13:18] that god made god bless
[13:20] his word saints brethren church
[13:23] i feel so strange tonight i feel like we
[13:26] are underground
[13:28] you know like if not like dark ages but
[13:31] we are like right now underground
[13:33] christians
[13:35] we not in church we
[13:39] are communicating and it's not the
[13:42] normal scenario
[13:44] and yet we have to press on to save this
[13:46] living god
[13:48] we're not saving a different god a god
[13:51] of our own imagination and thoughts
[13:53] but we are serving the living god so
[13:55] tonight i felt
[13:56] you know to bring this to you about this
[13:59] book of ephesians
[14:01] and we know it parallels the book of
[14:02] joshua
[14:04] uh this is the book of redemption as
[14:06] joshua was
[14:07] a book of redemption joshua
[14:11] is two parts coming out of and going
[14:13] into
[14:14] and this book reflects that this book of
[14:17] ephesians
[14:18] but i also wanted to tie it in with the
[14:20] ephesians church age
[14:22] and to show the quality of spirit and
[14:24] attitude
[14:25] that god people uh had in that time
[14:29] nobody called ephesians the standard
[14:34] is like a template of god's pattern
[14:36] that's what
[14:37] ephesians really represent and it is
[14:40] original
[14:42] it is the harvest of the resurrection on
[14:46] display
[14:47] in a body of believers at that time the
[14:49] church
[14:50] this was god's ideal church which was
[14:53] the alpha church
[14:55] and between the alpha and the omega
[14:58] church
[14:59] you could call it processes whether it
[15:01] belong in the ground whether you looter
[15:03] wesley the jewish history was like
[15:06] processes
[15:07] but it has to have an omega church which
[15:10] is an exact replica of the original
[15:13] alpha church so this is where we have to
[15:17] get back to
[15:18] this this this this this alpha church
[15:21] which was the ephesian church so this
[15:23] book of ephesians
[15:25] is six chapters in that book and the
[15:27] first what we read here
[15:29] dealing with god dealing with christ
[15:32] dealing with the fact
[15:33] that he has a plan and program to bring
[15:36] us gentiles in
[15:37] our sons remember he came to the jews
[15:41] he came unto his own his own receiving
[15:44] not and in rejecting him
[15:46] it gave us an opening that we could be
[15:48] welcomed into this program of god
[15:51] as adopted sons so even though
[15:54] we wasn't in the covenant of the jewish
[15:57] people
[15:59] through christ through christ and
[16:01] because
[16:02] it it it made that rich for us to have
[16:05] direct control and that is why it's so
[16:07] beautiful
[16:08] it says here having uh no
[16:12] i mean just back up a little bit having
[16:13] predestinated us
[16:15] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[16:18] christ
[16:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[16:21] of his will
[16:23] so then this is the dealing with this
[16:25] first chapter here
[16:27] deals with as i said tonight i'm giving
[16:28] over you this chapter
[16:30] deals with all about what the lord has
[16:33] done
[16:33] in christ jesus in whom we have
[16:35] redemption to his blood in whom we have
[16:37] forgiveness of sins
[16:38] whereas he knows known as the mystery of
[16:41] his will
[16:42] that in the fullness of time he might
[16:44] guide it together in one all things in
[16:46] christ
[16:46] so christ becomes the center post of
[16:48] this chapter and this ephesians
[16:50] church was i said the ideal church this
[16:53] particular gospel
[16:54] in ephesians had nothing to do with with
[16:57] all this sin any corinthians or babies
[17:00] in hebrews or the legalistic
[17:03] in galatians it had all to do with
[17:06] perfection
[17:06] this is what is just a solid church
[17:08] small group
[17:10] but paul was the pastor apostle of this
[17:12] church
[17:13] and he was really a place in things in a
[17:15] in a powerful way
[17:16] in whom also is verse 13 you trusted
[17:20] after you heard the word of truth the
[17:22] gospel of salvation in whom
[17:23] also after you believe you were sealed
[17:26] with that holy spirit of promise which
[17:28] is god's ideal order
[17:29] you believe you receive you're here here
[17:32] comes the seal of the spirit
[17:34] as a confirmation of what you believe or
[17:36] receive or
[17:37] a manifestation of what you have
[17:38] received because you receive the seed in
[17:40] wood form
[17:41] and then when god changed that into
[17:43] spirit by his power
[17:45] that becomes the kingdom of god and then
[17:49] and then paul in verse 16
[17:53] he talked about i cease not to give
[17:55] thanks for you making mention of you my
[17:56] prayers and this was his burden
[17:59] and i want you to see paul as a contact
[18:01] person
[18:02] a person that is alive real present
[18:05] sharing it with ephesians church
[18:06] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[18:09] the father of glory be given to you
[18:11] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[18:15] in the knowledge of him this was his
[18:18] burden to the people
[18:19] that the eyes of your understanding
[18:21] being enlightened
[18:22] that you may know what is the hope of
[18:24] his calling
[18:25] and what is the riches of the glory of
[18:28] his inheritance and the saints
[18:29] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[18:32] power to us
[18:33] who believe according to the working of
[18:35] his mighty power
[18:36] which he wrought in christ and he talked
[18:38] about fire above principalities and
[18:39] dominions and so on
[18:41] and so on like that so that is chapter
[18:43] one
[18:44] chapter two he began to describe
[18:47] where he came from and many times in
[18:50] christians they forget where they come
[18:51] from it's sad it's unfortunate
[18:53] uh they tend to be evangelically
[18:56] hypocritical but judgmental
[18:58] and almost arrogant um in in
[19:01] understanding where god took them from
[19:04] and god said you are the quicker who
[19:05] were dead in trespasses and sin
[19:08] whereas in time past you walk according
[19:10] to the course of this world
[19:11] according to the prince of the power of
[19:12] the ear the spirit
[19:14] that now look at the nature of obedience
[19:16] and then you're talking about
[19:18] our conversation the loss of our flesh
[19:21] desires the
[19:22] mind so he's talking about the condition
[19:25] of rat and the condition of hell and the
[19:27] condition of the flesh and the ways of
[19:29] sin we were in
[19:30] but it was for god who's rich and mercy
[19:33] and we can praise god for that tonight
[19:35] god who is rich and mercy would you give
[19:36] god some praise to that tonight
[19:38] god with rich and mercy for his great
[19:40] love where he loved us
[19:42] even when we were dead in sins had
[19:44] quickness together by christ
[19:46] by grace i received and as you raise us
[19:48] up together
[19:49] make us to sit together in heavenly
[19:51] places in christ jesus
[19:52] that in ages to come he might show the
[19:54] exceeding riches of his grace towards us
[19:56] and he went on and say we are his
[19:58] workmanship created in christ jesus
[20:01] so all of this is positive stuff things
[20:04] that we could
[20:04] look at remember that he being in time
[20:08] past
[20:08] gentiles in the flesh who are called
[20:10] uncircumcision
[20:12] by that which is called circumcision so
[20:14] he's bridging the gap now
[20:15] that at that time we were without christ
[20:18] okay
[20:19] being aliens from the covenant of israel
[20:21] meaning that we were not covenanted like
[20:23] they were
[20:24] and strangers from the covenants of
[20:26] promise having no hope without god in
[20:28] the world but now in christ jesus
[20:30] ye which is us who will sometime are far
[20:32] off are made nigh
[20:34] by the blood of christ so he's showing
[20:36] you how the jews and gentiles
[20:38] kiss together through the cross of
[20:39] calvary bring us our sons
[20:41] in the sight of god isn't that wonderful
[20:43] tonight it's not a beautiful thing
[20:45] tonight that god
[20:46] threw the blood of the cross has made us
[20:48] sons and he has become our peace
[20:51] and he has broken down ever here we go
[20:53] the middle wall
[20:55] of partition between us i've been
[20:57] abolishing his flesh
[20:58] the enmity even the law of commandments
[21:01] and that law of commandments
[21:02] is what separated the jews as a people
[21:05] unto god
[21:05] from the rest of the world because god
[21:07] came unto moses give them commandments
[21:09] give them order
[21:10] we are gentiles we were just like
[21:12] barbarians whatever you want to say
[21:13] uh we were away from god didn't know god
[21:17] but through this cross he broke down
[21:19] this war with his commandments
[21:21] and then make that bridge so that he
[21:23] said now that contain the ordinances to
[21:25] make himself twain
[21:27] one new man making peace that he might
[21:29] reconcile
[21:30] both unto god in one body by the cross
[21:35] having slain enmity nearby and
[21:38] you talk about and through him we have
[21:40] access by one spirit
[21:42] unto the father and yet his glorious
[21:43] part here now verse
[21:45] was 19. no i know i'm spinning through
[21:48] here kind of quickly
[21:49] we just went overview tonight because we
[21:51] could drive slow on these things and
[21:53] everyone here is like a service assumer
[21:55] you could get us someone from every and
[21:57] here and therefore
[21:58] we are no more strangers and foreigners
[22:01] and fellow citizens
[22:02] with the saints and of the household of
[22:04] god we can stop right there and preach
[22:06] our own
[22:06] life tonight you can't be deported this
[22:08] is
[22:09] no longer strange is your land
[22:12] if they can't kick you out you can't say
[22:14] their passport with your visa
[22:16] and so on like that so this this year is
[22:18] a sermon we could go down a road tonight
[22:19] here
[22:20] and take over that tangent and take our
[22:21] own this year alone you see on this um
[22:24] immigration regulations and so on like
[22:25] that the angels can't handle that we are
[22:27] sons
[22:28] you have to open the gates we have
[22:30] access to christ
[22:31] ephesians one tells us that and we are
[22:34] grateful to god for that
[22:35] and said no and i built upon the
[22:37] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[22:39] jesus christ himself being the chief
[22:41] cornerstone
[22:42] of whom that he described in a
[22:45] particular way
[22:47] the building fitly framed together grew
[22:49] it into the
[22:50] holy temple in whom we he also are
[22:54] building together for a habitation of
[22:56] god to the spirit
[22:57] so paul give this beautiful reference of
[23:00] our building
[23:00] this body making up a building to become
[23:03] the habitation of god to the spirit
[23:05] and of course we know also alternatively
[23:08] we become a temple of god
[23:10] a temple of his spirit okay
[23:13] chapter three paul give his testimony
[23:16] about the dispensation hold by
[23:17] revelation he made known to me
[23:19] a mystery and he's given his testimony
[23:22] which of ages was not made known
[23:24] unto the sons of men but is not revealed
[23:26] by his holy apostles and prophets by
[23:28] spirit
[23:28] that the gentiles glory should be
[23:31] followers
[23:32] of the same body hallelujah and
[23:34] partakers of
[23:35] his promise in christ by the gospel so
[23:37] paul
[23:38] was excited to share that this
[23:41] revelation
[23:41] that we as gentiles are followers of the
[23:44] same body
[23:45] and then identifying his ministry where
[23:47] i was made a minister
[23:49] according to the gift of the grace of
[23:51] god given unto me
[23:53] by the effectual working on his power
[23:55] who is the least of saints and i'm so
[23:57] happy he said that i should preach
[23:59] among the gentiles the unsociable riches
[24:01] of christ so this is very
[24:03] paul is excited the jews had their story
[24:06] daddy abraham
[24:07] that isaac that moses that jesus and so
[24:09] on
[24:10] now paul is on ministry and seen a door
[24:13] slam open to this gentiles the gentiles
[24:15] his new land
[24:16] the gentiles is exciting and he is
[24:18] considered
[24:19] a grateful and awful thing to call to
[24:22] minister
[24:23] and preach to these gentiles that to
[24:25] make all men
[24:26] see what is the fellowship of the
[24:28] mystery from which the beginning of the
[24:30] world
[24:30] have been hitting god and then he went
[24:32] on and on and so on
[24:34] therefore my desire that you faint not
[24:36] at my tribulations for you
[24:38] which is your glory for this course i
[24:40] bowl my knees
[24:41] and i think he's praying again unto the
[24:42] father of the lord jesus christ of whom
[24:44] the whole family of eminent
[24:46] is named that he may grant you
[24:50] according to the riches of his glory to
[24:53] be strengthened with
[24:55] might by his spirit in the inner man
[24:59] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[25:02] faith
[25:03] that you be rooted and grounded in love
[25:06] that you may be able to comprehend with
[25:08] all saints what is the breadth
[25:11] and length and depth and height
[25:14] and here we go now and to know the love
[25:16] of christ
[25:18] which past set knowledge so this is a
[25:21] different level altogether
[25:22] and that reminds you of when brother
[25:24] branham saw his wife across there she
[25:26] said bill you preach about it but you
[25:27] don't know what it is
[25:28] this is the land of love you see it's an
[25:31] experience it's something
[25:32] at a higher level altogether so he's
[25:34] talking about the love of christ
[25:36] which passage knowledge that you may be
[25:38] full
[25:39] filled with all the fullness of god now
[25:42] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[25:44] abundantly above all that we ask for
[25:46] think
[25:47] according to power that wicked in us
[25:49] unto him be glory
[25:50] i want you to see how poor life was
[25:53] emanating glory to god not
[25:54] ever in my fight oh god oh god pressure
[25:58] no no no no he was saying unto him that
[26:01] is
[26:01] i believe and i said correct me that
[26:04] this letter was written while he was in
[26:06] prison this this was no
[26:08] let paul you know what i mean let's
[26:09] fellowship brethren i mean
[26:11] he was writing under pressure writing
[26:15] because was a higher order writing
[26:17] because
[26:18] you know maybe maybe that prison was
[26:21] given
[26:22] that sense of isolation that he could
[26:23] hear direct from god
[26:25] to inspire him to write these things
[26:27] unto him be glory in the church by jesus
[26:29] christ showed all ages
[26:30] without any amen paul
[26:33] no and that's what country no
[26:37] and then now so so so so so all of this
[26:40] is about christ
[26:41] about us gentiles getting connected then
[26:44] he broke into something now about the
[26:46] church
[26:46] so now he hit and now the church idea
[26:48] for chapter four
[26:50] a prisoner of the lord beseech you that
[26:52] you were worthy
[26:53] of the vocation where you're called no
[26:56] we cannot tell people what
[26:57] if they don't know what to just the
[26:59] calling is all about you kind of tell
[27:01] somebody hey
[27:01] walk right what you know you know who
[27:03] you are you don't know who you are
[27:04] so the revelation from ephesians chapter
[27:07] one
[27:08] chapter two chapter three we are being
[27:11] quickened
[27:11] we want in sin turn of disobedience oh
[27:14] god
[27:15] god has been good to us god rich and
[27:17] mercy now
[27:19] your predestined adoption no no walk
[27:22] worthy
[27:22] of the vacation where you're called
[27:24] you'll walk foolish don't walk like
[27:28] no sense walk smart walk with wisdom
[27:30] walk with understanding i pray that
[27:32] you'll be filled with knowledge with
[27:33] wisdom
[27:34] with revelation that's my burden for you
[27:36] because i want you to see
[27:37] where god took you from stop complaining
[27:40] stop fussing
[27:41] and appreciate and love god let's
[27:43] continue you say with all loneliness of
[27:46] meekness
[27:47] that's a big word boy with all
[27:49] loneliness when i say that with
[27:50] loneliness
[27:51] people always up to tea and proud with
[27:53] all loneliness
[27:54] and meekness with long suffering that's
[27:56] the whole mixtape and they're not just
[27:57] one
[27:58] thing you know like you're making a cake
[27:59] loneliness meekness
[28:01] long suffering for being one hour with
[28:03] love there's plenty things there
[28:04] when you're mixing that day it has to
[28:06] come out right you're shaking some
[28:08] loneliness shaking up some meekness
[28:10] sprinkle some long suffering
[28:11] add some forbearing another endeavoring
[28:14] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[28:16] bond of peace but every time somebody
[28:18] comes
[28:18] they want to have a you're going so
[28:20] they're going so the pastor says so well
[28:21] i ain't moving so i feel like so i got a
[28:24] dream last night so
[28:25] not that not that this is church now
[28:27] this is church now
[28:28] mark them who trying to make division
[28:30] mark them let's give them a tick on them
[28:32] see that brother he's trouble i want his
[28:34] trouble yeah
[28:35] mark them and expose them identify them
[28:38] because this
[28:39] tries them supposed to be the unity of
[28:42] the spirit
[28:42] in the bond of peace so you don't say
[28:44] one piece at all cause in the go to war
[28:46] the unity of the spirit you know what
[28:48] way in the bond
[28:49] of peace here it is
[28:53] how old glory is the bomb there is one
[28:56] body
[28:58] one spirit even a call by one hope of
[29:01] your calling so
[29:02] so paul is lining everything in a
[29:03] straight line for them there's one body
[29:06] there is one spirit there is one hope of
[29:08] your calling there is one lord
[29:10] there is one fate there is one baptism
[29:12] there is one god and father of all
[29:14] who is above all and through all and in
[29:16] you all
[29:17] so do study two gods two ways to no no
[29:20] no no there's only one
[29:22] i want to line up with that one for
[29:24] every one of us
[29:26] is giving grace according to the measure
[29:28] of the gift of christ
[29:29] and righteous the problem all around
[29:32] people don't understand everyone is
[29:35] given grace according to the measure
[29:38] so my measure might be small like this
[29:40] little 10 year old piercing
[29:41] your measure might be the whole pen but
[29:44] thank god for your measure
[29:46] but don't despise somebody who have a
[29:48] small measure medium measure big measure
[29:50] it have all kind you know like as we
[29:52] been saying planting i just discovered
[29:54] so much things it's amazing
[29:56] that's so much different kind of lettuce
[29:57] so much different kind of kale somewhat
[29:59] different kind of pumpkin so much
[30:00] different kind of mangoes you name it
[30:02] gold is called a variety
[30:04] it's everywhere nature so if you figure
[30:06] you have the ripest mango
[30:08] the best mango the only mango forget it
[30:10] you'll feel shame when you see the liner
[30:12] mangoes come
[30:13] so when you talk about gifts god isn't
[30:15] quite a variety
[30:16] it's an evangelist but everybody not the
[30:19] same evangelist
[30:20] everybody the same kind of pastor
[30:22] everybody same kind of kind of prophet
[30:24] either prophets
[30:25] who lie to the side prophet who do this
[30:27] prophet
[30:28] all these guys are different and you are
[30:31] fearfully and wonderfully made
[30:33] you are different don't compare yourself
[30:35] to nobody else
[30:36] when god make your mole he cancel
[30:38] everything else you see
[30:39] not another one like that coming you are
[30:43] you who you
[30:43] are and be grateful and thankful so that
[30:46] gift where wherever he said he has sent
[30:48] it on high
[30:49] you let captivity get captive and i'll
[30:51] skip that and he gives some apostles and
[30:53] some prophets and some evangelists and
[30:55] some personal teachers
[30:56] why is it that he didn't have one gift
[30:58] alone let's say a pastor
[31:00] everybody passed everybody's ship
[31:03] why you need to have apostle one cent
[31:07] a prophet direct word of the lord
[31:09] evangelists
[31:11] amen to green souls and so on pastors to
[31:14] anchor the people
[31:15] stay with the group and teachers that
[31:16] would break the mysteries on revelation
[31:18] why it is that you have all these gifts
[31:20] he knows why and these gifts are for the
[31:22] perfection of the saints work of the
[31:24] ministry yet he founded the body
[31:26] why these gifts are needed till we all
[31:28] come into confusion
[31:31] an argument until it fights the law
[31:34] until we clang swords that's not what
[31:36] the bible say you know until we come to
[31:38] the unity of the faith
[31:39] knowledge of the son of god the perfect
[31:42] man
[31:42] unto the measure of the structure of
[31:44] christ that we henceforth be no more
[31:46] children touched
[31:46] and throw carried about by every wind of
[31:49] doctrine by the
[31:50] slave of men con craftiness were by the
[31:52] lying way to receive
[31:54] speaking truth and love for who the
[31:56] whole body fit so he's talking about the
[31:57] church here now
[31:58] this body church so we come from
[32:01] predestinated adoption we come from
[32:03] where we come from
[32:04] you come from paul saying i'm a minister
[32:06] to you gentiles
[32:07] and here is no he's talking about the
[32:08] church talking about perfection walking
[32:11] in
[32:11] love and this i see therefore that you
[32:14] walk not as other gentiles walk
[32:16] in the vanity of your mind so now paul
[32:19] is making a bridge of this gospel of
[32:22] this world
[32:23] that must be effective in our lives i
[32:25] want you to get that tonight
[32:27] it's not just okay you have religions
[32:29] where
[32:30] you do things how your beads
[32:34] close your hand you do things to deity
[32:38] and whatnot
[32:39] this is not that type of thing this is
[32:41] word coming to you
[32:43] that it could be effected in your life
[32:46] you
[32:47] won't see the effect of what you're
[32:50] hearing
[32:51] in your life on a daily basis
[32:54] let me see it again you want to see
[32:57] the effect of this gospel
[33:01] on your life on a daily basis
[33:05] if all you are content with is to
[33:08] hear the gospel on a sunday and a
[33:11] wednesday
[33:12] as a church basis you are really uh a
[33:15] very nice fine
[33:16] church member you follow because
[33:19] the gospel is not that come like you go
[33:22] to the temple then you let this put this
[33:24] way
[33:24] and you make your offer in them and and
[33:26] you worship your god then
[33:28] and you come home knowing that your
[33:29] entire ribbon or you do whatever
[33:31] you do and you come back and you go home
[33:34] and you can fight with your neighbor you
[33:35] can cuss your husband
[33:36] you could embarrass your wife you could
[33:38] run out and slam the door and do
[33:40] anything but you know you give the offer
[33:42] you know
[33:42] you worship your god you see that is
[33:44] what the heathens do that is what
[33:46] worshipping other gods
[33:47] this is living god no this is not that
[33:49] because even though the tablets came out
[33:51] in stone
[33:52] god said i'll write it in your heart so
[33:54] therefore because the people were
[33:55] ignorant of god's law and of god's word
[33:58] he first had to bring something that
[33:59] they could connect with though shanks
[34:00] might steal
[34:01] those shall not commit adultery remember
[34:03] this day he had to bond the mind and
[34:06] bond the head with the law
[34:07] to give them a sense of order because
[34:10] that's what the commandment do you know
[34:11] put you in a rigidity
[34:12] you know what you know i go there you
[34:14] know because this is the law this is the
[34:16] law
[34:16] this is the law this is a law so that
[34:19] law put them in bondage
[34:21] but that money was to keep them from
[34:23] themselves keep them from sin and keep
[34:25] them but they couldn't do it because the
[34:26] nature is sinful
[34:28] because adam fought adam phil and
[34:31] because how we were born
[34:32] in sin not born and sin applied born in
[34:35] it
[34:36] so because we born in it is part of us
[34:38] and therefore that's why christ has died
[34:40] to deliver us from what was in us so
[34:43] when you put christianity as a cloak
[34:44] over you
[34:45] that don't mean sin that means you put a
[34:48] cloak
[34:49] so jesus come and correct all others and
[34:50] say you must be born again
[34:52] meaning inside have to transform and
[34:54] when inside is transformed
[34:56] then you have a new man you talk about a
[34:58] new man we found out about this later on
[35:00] paul talked about
[35:01] so then he said uh our nice uh this i
[35:04] say therefore
[35:05] that you walk not as a gender as walk
[35:08] you know
[35:09] your agenda awoken in the vanity of
[35:10] their mind having their understanding
[35:13] darkened
[35:14] alienated from the life of god through
[35:15] the ignorance that is in them
[35:17] because of the gladness in their heart
[35:19] giving themselves on grieving greediness
[35:21] and penis
[35:22] so you have not learned christ so if so
[35:26] that you have heard him and have been
[35:29] taught by him as the truth is in jesus
[35:33] that you here we go got you what put off
[35:37] concerning the former conversation the
[35:40] old man
[35:42] so now he's introducing something that
[35:44] connects directly to us
[35:46] to our life that this gospel brings on a
[35:50] new man
[35:51] and you have to put off say the old man
[35:54] say no lord
[35:56] the old man you have the point of what
[35:58] the say it again the old
[36:00] man watch that you put off
[36:04] the former conversation of life the old
[36:06] man which is corrupt
[36:08] according to deceitfulness and we will
[36:11] be
[36:11] you and this is important be be you
[36:14] renewed
[36:15] in the spirit of your mind now ramsay
[36:18] you see a child
[36:18] child born three four year old
[36:22] put some boogie woogie music the child
[36:23] will dance because it is built
[36:26] in it is built in because of the nature
[36:28] that is there
[36:29] think about it now our whole life has
[36:32] been channeled by the world
[36:34] by what we see by our senses and
[36:36] everything else
[36:38] so therefore come into the gospel now
[36:40] our mind have to get a refreshing
[36:43] and that's what renewing is and that
[36:45] reminds you of what
[36:46] what isaac always emphasized about
[36:48] meditating in the word
[36:50] once in a while day and night they are
[36:53] night what that is doing
[36:54] refreshing your mind of what god has
[36:56] promised i will keep you i will preserve
[36:58] you
[36:59] i'll overshadow you you'll be my rock
[37:01] you you i'm on your rock i'm your shield
[37:04] what you're doing you shout your mind uh
[37:06] you are my protector even this corona
[37:08] virus you have to be anointed something
[37:10] you can't be looking for quantifiers
[37:12] you're not looking for him he is
[37:14] wherever he is but what you looking for
[37:16] is god's hand of protection
[37:18] god be my shelter god be my shield
[37:21] called me my rock now you can stay fight
[37:23] now and lock up the stephanie basement
[37:24] and look what i told him
[37:26] but that doesn't solve yes i'm saying
[37:28] that just you fearful up there
[37:29] but you still have to be aware and doing
[37:32] all that needs to be done
[37:34] that you have trust in the lord so he
[37:36] says here now
[37:37] that you put on the new man which is
[37:40] after god
[37:41] is created in righteousness and truly
[37:44] says two things here
[37:45] you have to put off one and put on one
[37:49] you're putting off the old man and
[37:50] you're putting on the new man
[37:52] you are responsible to do
[37:55] that let me say it again you see the
[37:58] minister preaching the word
[37:59] that is one thing you see when you go
[38:01] home you have an old man and a new man
[38:03] and as which one you want to feed you
[38:05] could see the old man
[38:07] with movies with books but this all kind
[38:09] of crazy stuff
[38:10] or you could feed the old man or you
[38:12] could feel a new man if you feed a new
[38:14] man
[38:14] you want to worship you want to pray you
[38:16] want to seek the lord you want to get on
[38:18] the scriptures you want to apply the
[38:19] word to your heart
[38:20] you're working on that new man wherefore
[38:22] put away a lion
[38:25] you got to put that away too so
[38:27] everybody who knew they're not spoiled
[38:29] they're not fully speaking the truth in
[38:30] this room here doesn't have problems
[38:32] speaking
[38:33] full truth you have to put away what is
[38:35] not true like
[38:36] speak every man troop with his neighbor
[38:38] for we are members one another
[38:40] be angry and still not let your not your
[38:42] son go down
[38:43] so this is practical living i like this
[38:46] this is perfect this is a complete
[38:48] package you know sometimes
[38:50] you get a sandwich and something listen
[38:52] in it you have no lettuce it have no
[38:53] something there's a kind of boring
[38:55] sandwich
[38:55] this sandwich this this this menu that
[38:58] called quotation efficiency
[38:59] is the full menu a full menu
[39:03] you talk about supernatural before the
[39:05] foundation of the world
[39:06] you are predecimated you talk about you
[39:08] have been quickened you talk about the
[39:10] british
[39:10] cross or you talk about the building you
[39:13] talk about the unity and everything else
[39:14] and always talking about the practical
[39:16] application
[39:17] of this world to your life be angry and
[39:20] say not
[39:21] let not sun go down upon your rat and i
[39:24] used to take that real personal
[39:25] when i got married i remember whenever
[39:28] we have a foster something in the early
[39:29] part of our marriage
[39:31] the sudden when you start going long i'm
[39:32] making sure everything's straight now
[39:34] nothing you're going back the next day
[39:36] and you're not talking and you're not
[39:37] saying nothing at all
[39:38] no no let not sun go down up on your
[39:40] right neither give place to the devil
[39:42] let him that stole steal no more rather
[39:45] let him
[39:45] labor who came with his hands the things
[39:48] which is good
[39:49] that he may have to give them an either
[39:50] i like this one there's a big big one
[39:53] you find somebody working hard like they
[39:55] want too much of money
[39:57] then they'll be pointing that basically
[39:58] i'm thinking but here at this point
[40:00] labor that he may have to give that
[40:03] needed
[40:04] you know bible says no blessing to give
[40:05] them to receive but you can't give away
[40:08] you
[40:08] have think about it it's more blessed to
[40:11] give them to receive right i'm not
[40:12] straining a little bit here
[40:14] but is you in order to give you have to
[40:15] have and to have you have to get
[40:17] and i get you after labor
[40:22] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[40:24] of your mouth but that which is good
[40:26] so this year the church can't do this
[40:28] for you
[40:29] you could hear mysteries revelations uh
[40:33] uh new tongue new name
[40:38] new language other language and so on
[40:40] like that you can have all these things
[40:42] but let no corrupt communication
[40:44] position anymore because you see you
[40:45] could know all them things and then
[40:46] oh okay corrupt communication you see
[40:50] so then here let's go again let no
[40:52] corrupt communication proceed out of
[40:53] your mouth
[40:54] but that which is good to the use of a
[40:57] define
[40:58] that it may minister grace to the
[41:00] hearers
[41:01] and big one grieve not the holy spirit
[41:03] whereby you are sealed until their
[41:05] redemption
[41:06] let all bitterness which some people
[41:08] still have
[41:10] and the bible says sweetness speech
[41:13] speaking it about with prayer so you
[41:15] know going on the devil or you pray
[41:17] because you know what i treat now
[41:18] now it's one thing that bitterness you
[41:20] know but you can't let it stay too
[41:21] bitter yeah they get it
[41:24] by sweeten it up right and rat and
[41:27] anger and crap now listen he's not
[41:30] talking to
[41:31] gentiles outsider this is church people
[41:35] in case you're he's talking about you
[41:37] and either
[41:39] jewish folks he's talking about
[41:41] believers he's talking about brethren
[41:44] so i don't always look again
[41:48] could somebody say amen out there so
[41:52] he says uh little bitterness and wrath
[41:55] and anger and clamor
[41:56] he was speaking we put away from you
[41:58] with all malice
[41:59] and be kind
[42:02] one to another that's a wholesale monday
[42:06] on kindness i think this message need a
[42:09] message on kindness
[42:10] knowing that any preachers in our midst
[42:12] want to work on something on that
[42:14] but people need to be kind so it's not a
[42:18] common word
[42:19] um it's not a word that is um because
[42:21] kindness is demonstratable
[42:24] kindness is demonstratable it's not like
[42:27] i
[42:27] have a text on kindness and the text i'm
[42:30] going to reveal the mystery behind
[42:31] kindness
[42:32] no just be kind and we get the
[42:34] revelation industry right there too just
[42:36] just be kind and um be kind one to
[42:40] another
[42:41] tenderhearted that's the next
[42:49] um my grandson uh
[42:52] my grandson samuel i tell him uh one
[42:55] time i sell them i said um your mommy
[42:57] would say samuel come here
[42:59] he said um my mommy don't speak like
[43:01] that so i said
[43:02] how does your mummy speak she says
[43:04] softly
[43:07] i just was amazed because that is how
[43:09] his mother speak
[43:10] oh that's kind of speak very soft so i
[43:12] recognize he's aware
[43:14] of how his mother speaks he's aware of
[43:17] how his father speaks
[43:18] so if anybody speak to him rough and
[43:20] gruff it's a different tone altogether
[43:22] but you have to be tenderhearted
[43:25] uh even as christ even as god for
[43:28] christ's sake have forgiven me
[43:30] you realize that um we
[43:33] i don't know you currently measure sin
[43:36] in terms of
[43:38] so much sin i i understand seem to be
[43:40] sin
[43:41] but some sins are you know more terrible
[43:44] than our sins if you could use it that
[43:45] way
[43:46] but the fact is christ has forgiven us
[43:49] and is because of the heart he has for
[43:52] us
[43:53] because it's not like he forgive us when
[43:55] we say we you know when we we were nice
[43:57] and we were good
[43:58] he forgive us why we were against him
[44:00] why we were
[44:01] in our condition and and that redeeming
[44:04] love is what reached out to us
[44:05] in our condition it's not that we were
[44:07] clean we were filthy but
[44:09] his love reached out to us and until us
[44:11] and then
[44:12] chapter five chapter five
[44:15] he's going long again uh to the
[44:18] believers
[44:19] he's going further in christian living
[44:22] be followers of god yet children walk in
[44:25] love that's just
[44:26] actionable as christ love us and give
[44:29] him
[44:29] himself a sweet self offering
[44:31] fornication all uncleanness
[44:33] consciousness letting that be named
[44:34] among you neither filthiness
[44:36] or foolish talking or justin uh
[44:40] and and and this no no monger no opine
[44:43] person no covetous man
[44:45] had any inheritance in the kingdom of
[44:47] god let no man deceive you with vain
[44:48] words
[44:49] for because of these things common iraq
[44:51] on terminal business of children
[44:52] disobedience
[44:54] you talk about ye who were sometimes in
[44:56] darkness and now
[44:57] light in the world walk as children of
[45:00] light
[45:01] and the fruit of the spirit aha let's go
[45:04] the fruit of the spirit some people
[45:05] claim to have these spirits some people
[45:06] claim to be anointed with the spirit
[45:08] and uh touch will be spread hallelujah
[45:10] right
[45:11] but the fruit of it is
[45:14] goodness righteousness truth
[45:18] proven what is acceptable unto the lord
[45:20] have no fellowship with the
[45:21] unfruitful work of darkness but rather
[45:23] reprove them
[45:25] for it's a shame even to speak of those
[45:28] things which are done in secret
[45:29] but all things are reproved and so on
[45:31] see then that you walk
[45:33] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[45:36] redeeming the time because these are
[45:38] evil
[45:38] so he's talking about aha let's go and
[45:40] angle and whereby
[45:42] be not unwise church listen to this part
[45:46] this is verse 18 verse 17
[45:50] but understanding what the will of the
[45:52] lord is
[45:53] i think i trust god gave you a burden
[45:56] that you would want to know
[45:58] what is the will of god for your life we
[46:00] all have our
[46:01] decisions and choices and what we want
[46:03] to do but
[46:04] you want god's will for your life and be
[46:07] not drunk with wine
[46:08] we're in his excess but be filled with
[46:10] the spirit 19
[46:12] speaking to yourselves in psalms and
[46:14] hymns
[46:15] and spiritual songs singing and making
[46:18] melody
[46:19] in your heart to the lord so if nobody
[46:22] talking to you you could speak to
[46:24] yourself
[46:25] if nobody encouraging you you could
[46:27] speak to yourself in psalms and hymns
[46:30] if you're already psalms you're not
[46:32] you're not going to get back something
[46:33] from the word
[46:34] so sounds and sings and spiritual songs
[46:37] singing and making a melody in your
[46:38] heart to the lord
[46:40] so even if you can't sing like you can't
[46:42] hold a song in a bucket
[46:43] you could say something in your heart if
[46:45] your voice out the tune
[46:47] and that is okay but you're sticking in
[46:49] your heart
[46:51] if you if you if you if you if you're
[46:53] personally wrong you got complaining
[46:54] about your voice and so
[46:56] on singing yeah and then after that
[46:58] you're singing
[46:59] all of the spirit atmosphere creator
[47:02] and then giving thanks always that's
[47:04] some people like to complain oh gosh
[47:06] they
[47:07] i don't know we call them yeah yeah yeah
[47:11] yeah it just happened yeah yeah they're
[47:13] complaining complaining
[47:14] complaining hinders your feet let me say
[47:16] it again complaining
[47:19] weakens the faith when you feel to
[47:21] complain
[47:22] just say lord i bless you i praise you
[47:24] right thank you
[47:25] look how much people come with
[47:26] congratulations where are you supposed
[47:28] to complain
[47:29] so when i went and had a good time by
[47:32] election they had a good time and
[47:34] bars that a good time all the good times
[47:36] are over
[47:37] they're on a bed you follow them saying
[47:40] that people get reacted and different
[47:41] kind of things like that people careless
[47:43] some people were careless and so on
[47:45] there were some who were not but there
[47:46] were some who were like one man
[47:48] understand he knew what he had but he
[47:50] went here you went dear
[47:51] you want to go to private hospital this
[47:53] and that and that and a lot of people
[47:55] got connected
[47:56] so it's not right because right now
[47:58] through this whole thing you recognize
[48:00] how what we do
[48:00] affect others that's big that's big
[48:04] enough
[48:04] when you think deeper how one person
[48:07] represents the
[48:08] kingdom of god and then how does the
[48:12] kingdom
[48:12] how does your life or our life reflect
[48:15] in god's program
[48:16] and you know but i thought sometime i go
[48:18] talking about working in the business
[48:20] only business and above the business
[48:22] and we're going to go down a little bit
[48:24] to that when we go to the church it's
[48:25] just part of this
[48:26] whole exhortation tonight to see how god
[48:29] has seen things
[48:30] at the church level which was fighting
[48:32] the labor in and it
[48:34] and they find all the apostles who sit
[48:36] there nothing from
[48:37] liars and so on and that is at this
[48:39] level here at the ground level
[48:41] but above level god's seen something
[48:43] different
[48:44] he's seeing the love is lacking he's
[48:46] seeing working like a mule
[48:48] he's seeing labor but he's not seeing
[48:50] the love that's supposed to go
[48:52] with the burden of the world and it
[48:54] gives a different tone
[48:56] when we begin to see not at our level
[48:58] but at god's level
[49:00] and sometimes i wonder if people think
[49:01] at all how does god see
[49:04] our behavior or our attitude
[49:07] or our action how does god see that
[49:10] we're not talking about people now
[49:12] because the people consider god bless
[49:14] praise the lord and so like that you
[49:16] could do a performance
[49:17] but as i say you know acting a hollywood
[49:19] performance you got
[49:20] award but when you go to the level of
[49:23] watching it's different and it comes
[49:26] back to how goku tell by the branham
[49:28] be more sincere because god was seen in
[49:31] his heart
[49:32] we as humans can't see that we can't see
[49:35] i know what is going on people's lives
[49:36] we see
[49:37] somebody whole they might be smiling or
[49:39] they might be crying on the inside
[49:41] they might be smiling or they might be
[49:43] in pain in a pain
[49:45] and so on like that and only god could
[49:46] come and give that kind of healing and
[49:48] that he didn't touch
[49:49] so given tanks and then all this is in
[49:52] five
[49:53] we almost finish this part of it here
[49:56] and um he's talking about giving tanks
[49:59] always
[49:59] always for all things under god and the
[50:02] father
[50:03] let me be that slowly this one to drive
[50:04] slowly
[50:06] slow down the gear we don't want to
[50:07] drive this one too fast we want to drive
[50:09] slowly on this one
[50:10] given thanks always for all things
[50:15] unto god and the father in the name of
[50:18] our lord jesus christ giving time
[50:19] thank you lord this will happen this
[50:22] happened this did not happen
[50:23] as we say you're tanking god for the
[50:25] nose as if it's here yes
[50:27] because he knows protecting you you want
[50:28] this god said no
[50:31] and you you instead of getting upset say
[50:33] thank you lord hallelujah thank you you
[50:34] told me no
[50:35] because you know best and that
[50:37] demonstrates trust in god what i have in
[50:39] this point you know you should not
[50:40] abraham you should not know what you
[50:41] should not have
[50:42] every son that committed god will be
[50:44] trying so god wouldn't have no others as
[50:46] you do nobody see past behind
[50:48] no god does not it's kind of different
[50:50] all right
[50:51] and then i went on to said wives submit
[50:54] yourselves unto your husband's under the
[50:55] law
[50:56] now this is not um a suggestion this is
[50:59] just the word
[51:01] it's not opinion this is just what the
[51:03] word unfolds
[51:05] how why is supposed to behave husband is
[51:07] the head of the wife
[51:08] he must christ the head of the church
[51:10] and what paul is doing
[51:11] paul is comparing the behavior with the
[51:14] revelation
[51:15] of the mystery of christ and the church
[51:17] so this husband and wife thing is not
[51:19] just about the writing
[51:21] this husband and wife thing is a little
[51:22] deeper than what we see
[51:25] it's a reflection of what the operation
[51:28] is supposed to be
[51:29] of christ and the church could imagine
[51:32] the
[51:32] wife of christ busting a slap on him
[51:34] could you imagine the wife of christ
[51:36] abusing could imagine christ's wife and
[51:38] send him back
[51:40] and being disrespectful i want you to
[51:41] think about that then you come down to
[51:43] the natural husband and wife
[51:45] what can i behave is dear you know the
[51:48] christ fight walk out on him i ain't
[51:50] coming back
[51:50] oh my god done so watch
[51:54] therefore as the church is subject unto
[51:57] christ
[51:58] so let their wives be to their own
[52:00] husband in everything
[52:02] no to to put the balance and that
[52:05] husband's love your wives how not as a
[52:08] father of your mother just talk about
[52:10] that
[52:10] but as christ loved the church and gave
[52:13] himself for it
[52:14] that so in other words uh you have to
[52:17] put your wife above you
[52:18] in order to love her when i say above
[52:20] you in order to treat her well
[52:23] okay value her cherish her because
[52:26] love is demonstratable i want to say it
[52:29] again
[52:29] love is demonstratable you see
[52:34] the new name or the mystery of the
[52:37] trumpets and the vials you can't
[52:38] demonstrate that
[52:40] you're what i'm saying we could teach
[52:41] that um
[52:43] the mystery of the woman on the seven
[52:44] hills the mystery of revelation 17.
[52:48] all these different mysteries are not
[52:50] demonstrated
[52:51] they are i know it's not a word
[52:53] revealable they could be revealed or
[52:54] unfolded
[52:56] but this here is demonstrable husband
[52:59] love your wife how christ of the church
[53:01] give himself
[53:02] that he might cleanse it by the washing
[53:04] of the water by the word that might
[53:05] present himself a glorious church
[53:07] not having a spot a wrinkle so what
[53:09] meant to love their wives as their own
[53:10] bodies see that love it his wife love it
[53:12] himself if you do love your wife you
[53:16] answer that personally
[53:17] no one is his own flesh and then he says
[53:19] we are members of his body his flesh his
[53:21] bones and so on
[53:22] and for discourse shall a man leave his
[53:24] father mother shall be joined unto his
[53:26] wife
[53:27] and they too shall be one flesh without
[53:30] the mother-in-laws and
[53:31] in laws of outlaws and getting involved
[53:34] because the man is mature
[53:35] a man going into his family his
[53:37] blessings and that's it
[53:39] all right now watching nevertheless let
[53:40] every one of you in particular so love
[53:42] his wife imagine himself
[53:44] and see that the wife reverence a
[53:46] husband or respectful husband
[53:48] chapter six okay
[53:52] chapter six talk about children will be
[53:54] your parents still demonstrating
[53:55] honor your father and mother that it may
[53:57] be wrong well with the
[53:59] fathers do provoking children you see
[54:01] all of these are
[54:02] living mysteries all of these are things
[54:04] that could be applied all these things
[54:05] are life skills
[54:07] life stories uh
[54:12] life and godliness this is it right here
[54:14] in chapter six for children
[54:16] servants will be in their uh masters and
[54:18] so on singles of heart
[54:20] not with eye service um they just get
[54:23] down there quickly
[54:24] no finally my version is verse 10 of
[54:27] ephesians chapter six
[54:28] you talk about put on the old armor of
[54:30] god destroying the lord
[54:32] of might and here it is after
[54:35] the destination after his quickness
[54:38] after he talked about uh
[54:40] one lord one thing on baptism after he
[54:42] speaks about
[54:43] all these life skills and stuff he's
[54:45] introducing something new
[54:46] in this whole chapter now the devil the
[54:49] enemy what we want against
[54:51] so it's not so that's what i'm saying
[54:53] ephesians is a complete package
[54:56] it's a holistic package here it is after
[54:58] you talk about put away rat for the
[55:00] rebittance and whatnot
[55:02] so that's you know so you have your own
[55:03] challenges you have your own thing so
[55:05] put off the new
[55:06] put off the old man put on a new man
[55:08] love your wife do this do that subject
[55:10] yourself and whatnot
[55:11] here it is he's introducing for
[55:13] irrational not against flesh and blood
[55:16] so we fight besides our own personal
[55:18] problem we're not about lucifer we're
[55:19] not about demons
[55:20] not about demon activity we're not
[55:22] talking about that here
[55:24] rat and anger and whatnot that have to
[55:26] do with us putting away this
[55:28] rejecting this walk away from this
[55:30] that's you and what you have to do
[55:32] things that you have to do illusions you
[55:34] have the time
[55:35] no in addition to that we
[55:39] understand by the word that we are not
[55:42] wrestling against flesh and blood
[55:44] but against principalities against
[55:46] powers
[55:47] against rulers of darkness of this world
[55:50] against spiritual weakness in high
[55:51] places therefore
[55:53] you have to put on the whole armor of
[55:54] god to stand
[55:56] then he explained the world armor of god
[55:58] and so on like that
[55:59] taking the shield of fate uh taking the
[56:02] shield of faith
[56:03] uh helmet of salvation sword of the
[56:05] spirit
[56:07] praying always with all prayers
[56:08] application and the spirit watching unto
[56:10] all
[56:11] saints and something like that and for
[56:12] me that will be given
[56:14] that's it grace be and that's it so i
[56:16] trust tonight that you were blessed
[56:19] here in this scripture and um i just
[56:21] have an excellent power to go through
[56:22] considering tiny little ages
[56:24] but this is the ephesians ephesians what
[56:27] abraham said
[56:28] is the plumb line okay let me just look
[56:31] back at one more thing in the future i
[56:33] forget to talk about
[56:34] this um right
[56:37] above all taking a sheet of fate whereby
[56:39] this is 16 whereby you shall
[56:41] able to quench all the dust of the
[56:42] wicked take the helmet of salvation the
[56:44] sword of the spirit with the word of god
[56:46] praying always with all prayer and
[56:48] supplication in the spirit
[56:49] watching therefore with all perseverance
[56:51] and all supplications with all saints
[56:53] and so on like that so paul was saying
[56:55] praying always
[56:56] in order to bring praying and other life
[56:59] things into a habit
[57:00] because that is what praying always does
[57:02] praying always
[57:04] is is praying until you become a habit
[57:06] you're going to pray
[57:08] on dead bones so you make praying a
[57:09] habit so pray becomes part of him
[57:12] part of the operation i think there's
[57:14] some statistics that show how long it
[57:16] takes for something to
[57:17] be active in you then in repeating it
[57:20] when you keep doing it over
[57:21] and over and over so like all we have
[57:24] this zoom study
[57:25] as we do this over and over and you're
[57:27] getting benefit from it and they get
[57:28] trained from it afterwards you look back
[57:31] and say but this is who
[57:33] how could we how could we not do this
[57:35] you see because we are
[57:36] we have benefited from it we are being
[57:38] strained from it so brother branham
[57:41] this uh he's he spoke about
[57:44] a key that was given to him that
[57:46] determined the messenger of each agent
[57:48] is the most scriptural one
[57:50] he said it's called the keystone of the
[57:52] bible it's the revelation
[57:54] that god never changes that his ways are
[57:57] unchangeable as he is
[57:58] that's the key the key is what god
[58:02] never changes now that's that's on top
[58:04] here
[58:05] that's that's the upper level now down
[58:07] here
[58:08] it have man who introduces things like
[58:12] if god has changed
[58:13] but the reality is he's hebrews today
[58:16] he's jesus christ
[58:18] he's saying yesterday and forever and
[58:19] ecclesiastes 3 14 15 says i know
[58:22] that god whatever god do it it shall be
[58:24] forever
[58:25] nothing can be put to it no anything
[58:27] take me from it and god do it
[58:29] that men may fear before him that which
[58:32] has been is now
[58:34] that which is to be had already been and
[58:36] god required that which is
[58:38] past so here it is and i'm changing god
[58:43] with unchanging ways we want to take our
[58:46] time slow here
[58:47] what he did at the first he will have to
[58:49] keep on doing
[58:50] until it is done for the last time there
[58:53] will never be
[58:54] a change apply that to the church ages
[58:58] the kind of man that god choose for the
[58:59] first age and how god manifested
[59:01] in that man's ministry would be the
[59:03] example
[59:04] for all other ages what god did in the
[59:06] first church age is what he will do in
[59:08] all other ages
[59:10] so therefore this is the pattern this is
[59:12] the key all right
[59:14] so the beginning of the word was that
[59:15] god the word was and word
[59:17] was god no change to him now if any man
[59:20] shall take any words
[59:22] voice from the book of this prophecy god
[59:23] shall take away his part of the book of
[59:25] life
[59:26] out of the holy city and the things that
[59:27] are written in this book here i want to
[59:29] get to
[59:30] what the church was at pentecost is the
[59:33] standard
[59:37] remember the class what
[59:40] the church was at pentecost is the
[59:44] standard
[59:45] that is the pattern there is no
[59:49] other pattern i wanted to stick tonight
[59:53] no other pattern no matter what scholars
[59:55] say
[59:56] god has not changed that pattern
[59:59] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[1:00:02] on doing until the church
[1:00:03] closes glory so when
[1:00:07] the quote be a custom reading from
[1:00:09] adoption
[1:00:11] when a church is groaning
[1:00:14] that the holy ghost is just as
[1:00:17] real as when it fell on their pentacles
[1:00:21] how they groan and cry and when they are
[1:00:24] born
[1:00:25] and positionally born then god sets in
[1:00:28] the church apostles
[1:00:30] and teachers and prophets and
[1:00:31] evangelists and then god sent all the
[1:00:33] other gifts inside of you
[1:00:35] but watch what you have to believe that
[1:00:37] the holy ghost
[1:00:39] is just as real i was there pelicans
[1:00:43] why did goshen a prophet what was the
[1:00:46] mission of that prophet
[1:00:47] to turn our hearts back
[1:00:51] to the fate of the father the purpose of
[1:00:54] sending a profit was to get us to
[1:00:56] connect back with the original
[1:00:58] which is what's pattern that cannot
[1:01:01] change
[1:01:03] no minister power of authority to change
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] to show that that is not the pattern
[1:01:09] that is the pattern
[1:01:11] there has to be another day of pentacles
[1:01:14] there has to be dynamics upon this last
[1:01:16] day right it has to be
[1:01:18] the power of god as never before no man
[1:01:20] can change that nobody can preach that
[1:01:22] out
[1:01:23] these scenes reveal that the quickening
[1:01:25] power has to come back to the church
[1:01:26] that the holy ghost was born by praise
[1:01:29] and dogmas
[1:01:30] but is it being loosed by the even time
[1:01:31] message that is what this message comes
[1:01:33] to do
[1:01:33] loosely holy ghost hallelujah not just
[1:01:36] loose men around the world with the
[1:01:37] interpretation you could find out
[1:01:39] you found out what they meant these guys
[1:01:41] but the loose equal equals
[1:01:43] and the holy ghost has been loosed since
[1:01:45] the prophet came
[1:01:46] the holy ghost has been loosed but it
[1:01:48] has been loosed in the form of promises
[1:01:51] god hide the holy ghost any form of
[1:01:53] promises and people let the promises go
[1:01:55] they have their own interpretation they
[1:01:57] preaching their own mysteries they're
[1:01:58] preaching on revelation
[1:01:59] but the seed the secret is the wood and
[1:02:02] the bride
[1:02:02] god then promises thunder inside that
[1:02:04] right now the bride have their promises
[1:02:06] and god going and change them with same
[1:02:08] word inside of you after spirit
[1:02:10] what a dynamic i know we haven't have a
[1:02:12] tremendous revival
[1:02:13] and coronavirus can't stop i'm not
[1:02:15] promising
[1:02:16] stopping and revival no no virus is
[1:02:20] stopping the revival this revival come
[1:02:22] from god
[1:02:22] god ordained this revival he called that
[1:02:24] bright survivor you chose to understand
[1:02:26] we got revival right now we underground
[1:02:29] hallelujah
[1:02:30] god allow this could you imagine we have
[1:02:32] more services than ever before
[1:02:34] we have more things operating than ever
[1:02:36] before think about it
[1:02:40] think about it who arranged all of this
[1:02:42] the same god
[1:02:43] that had the print and press introduced
[1:02:45] before the word come to print
[1:02:46] and get looted to spread it in pamphlets
[1:02:48] and whatnot the same god that had west
[1:02:50] leader run around the world with
[1:02:51] the same god hallelujah that do all
[1:02:54] these different things that that tape
[1:02:55] recorder being invented
[1:02:56] that we could get the days of the voice
[1:02:57] the same god that invented internet that
[1:03:00] we could do we're doing right now
[1:03:01] he's a god that do all these things
[1:03:03] we're still under the anointing
[1:03:04] of god the devil hallelujah all we never
[1:03:08] tried all this kingdom god using it
[1:03:10] there's a divorce but around gone and we
[1:03:12] are the voice still here
[1:03:13] hallelujah and there's a people in the
[1:03:15] land under their messenger all glory
[1:03:18] will be the final voice at the final age
[1:03:20] what a wonderful time
[1:03:22] so the church at pentecost was the
[1:03:24] pattern
[1:03:25] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[1:03:28] doing
[1:03:29] until the age closes those scholars may
[1:03:31] tell you the apostolic is age is over
[1:03:33] don't believe it susceptible is wrong on
[1:03:36] two comments first
[1:03:37] it's wrong and then he explained this
[1:03:39] and he went slowly across the scripture
[1:03:41] of acts 2.
[1:03:42] then peter said unto them repent and be
[1:03:44] baptized
[1:03:45] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:03:47] christ for the mission of the sins
[1:03:48] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:03:50] holy ghost for the promises unto you
[1:03:52] and he says the promise of power which
[1:03:55] the apostles been doing that pentecost
[1:03:57] is to you the jews
[1:03:59] to your children jews and to all them
[1:04:02] that are far off
[1:04:02] gentiles that's the interpretation of
[1:04:04] that scripture
[1:04:06] it powers unto you jews your children
[1:04:08] jews
[1:04:09] to them that are foul of gentiles as to
[1:04:11] many as the lord of god shall call both
[1:04:13] jew and gentiles
[1:04:14] until he stops calling the pentecostal
[1:04:16] message and power
[1:04:17] will not cease hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:21] i will connect with that i will stay
[1:04:23] with that it cannot cease
[1:04:25] what the church had at pentecost is an
[1:04:27] inalienable right
[1:04:29] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:04:31] she had the power of
[1:04:32] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[1:04:36] and wonders and gift of the holy ghost
[1:04:38] and then he read the scriptures of
[1:04:40] hebrews
[1:04:41] two one to four therefore we ought to
[1:04:43] give more uranus he to the things which
[1:04:45] we have heard
[1:04:45] at least at any time we let them slip
[1:04:47] but if the words spoken by angels were
[1:04:49] steadfast
[1:04:50] and every transgression and disobedience
[1:04:52] to the word receive a
[1:04:53] just recompense of reward how shall we
[1:04:56] escape
[1:04:57] if we neglect so greater salvation which
[1:04:59] at first begin to be spoken by the lord
[1:05:01] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:05:04] heard
[1:05:04] god also bearing witness both with signs
[1:05:06] and wonders with diverse miracles and
[1:05:08] gifts of the holy ghost
[1:05:10] according to his will that original
[1:05:12] church
[1:05:13] was not organized by men it was led by
[1:05:17] the holy ghost
[1:05:18] it wasn't very big it was hated on the
[1:05:20] spice
[1:05:21] it was oppressed it was prosecuted we
[1:05:23] counter debt
[1:05:24] but it was true to god it stayed with
[1:05:26] the original word pattern
[1:05:29] now don't let get let no don't get
[1:05:31] astray
[1:05:32] he said when i said that the church god
[1:05:34] and his ways never change i did not say
[1:05:36] that the church and his messengers
[1:05:38] could not change the church isn't god so
[1:05:41] she can't change
[1:05:42] what i said was that because of the
[1:05:45] unchanging god
[1:05:46] with the unchanging ways we can go back
[1:05:48] to the beginning and see the first
[1:05:50] scientific act of god
[1:05:52] and then judge by that standard that is
[1:05:54] how it is done the true church here we
[1:05:56] go
[1:05:56] will always try to be like the original
[1:06:00] at pentecost that is the aim
[1:06:05] that is the target what it had at
[1:06:07] pentecost
[1:06:08] we are striving towards that the true
[1:06:11] church today
[1:06:13] will try to approximate that fully first
[1:06:16] one
[1:06:17] and the messengers to the churches
[1:06:19] having the same spirit of god in them
[1:06:21] will try to approximate the apostle paul
[1:06:24] they won't exactly be like him but the
[1:06:27] true messengers will be the ones that
[1:06:28] come the closest to paul
[1:06:30] who was one free of all men
[1:06:33] that mean no no hierarchy behind them
[1:06:37] all right sold out to god and gave
[1:06:40] forth the word of god only and
[1:06:44] manifested the holy ghost in power none
[1:06:47] else would do
[1:06:48] you have to work from the original as
[1:06:51] like begets like the true church would
[1:06:55] always be the one
[1:06:56] that tries to follow in the steps of our
[1:06:58] founders at pentecost
[1:07:00] and our messengers will follow the
[1:07:02] apostle paul the first messenger to the
[1:07:04] first church age
[1:07:05] it is that simple and that wonderful
[1:07:08] isn't that glorious tonight
[1:07:10] so then he talked about with this key he
[1:07:12] was um
[1:07:13] he was just selecting messengers and so
[1:07:15] like that here is part i want to get to
[1:07:17] know
[1:07:18] since you understand how we judge what
[1:07:20] the true church was like
[1:07:22] what she was at pentecost and she was
[1:07:24] the in the apostles
[1:07:25] age set forth by the word in the book of
[1:07:27] acts we can apply that same rule
[1:07:29] to show how the church failed
[1:07:34] the basic era or errors
[1:07:37] that crept into the first church were
[1:07:39] revealed in the book of acts and
[1:07:41] revelation also new pistols will
[1:07:43] become more and more visibly manifested
[1:07:46] in each
[1:07:47] subsequent age until we come to a
[1:07:49] complete blackout
[1:07:50] in the laodicean age now
[1:07:54] out of this first key we have received
[1:07:57] of the lord
[1:07:58] there comes another slightly less
[1:08:00] wonderful truth i said
[1:08:02] that the true church will always trying
[1:08:04] to be like the book of acts
[1:08:05] that is exactly right but we have
[1:08:07] discovered that the word also teaches an
[1:08:09] invasion of error
[1:08:12] until there's a complete blackout of
[1:08:15] truth in the last days
[1:08:16] when the lord is about to appear the
[1:08:19] question now arises
[1:08:21] in our minds does god forsake his own
[1:08:24] and let them fall into a state of
[1:08:26] complete deception
[1:08:27] there's a prophecy does god
[1:08:31] forsake his own and let them
[1:08:34] fall into a state of complete deception
[1:08:38] he said no a no account so god will not
[1:08:42] let the bride or the elect fall into a
[1:08:44] state of
[1:08:45] complete deception some deception but
[1:08:48] not the complete one
[1:08:50] no because god will bring his elect out
[1:08:51] of deception
[1:08:53] all right so watch on no account for the
[1:08:55] scripture said the elect cannot be
[1:08:57] deceived
[1:08:57] for they shall rise force christ false
[1:08:59] prophets shall show signs and wonders
[1:09:01] and so much if it were possible they
[1:09:03] shall receive the very like
[1:09:04] then what then the answer is clear
[1:09:06] before us there's a true church and
[1:09:08] fourth church there's a true vine
[1:09:10] false fine of course that false church
[1:09:11] and false fine body
[1:09:13] will always try to use the position of
[1:09:16] the true church
[1:09:17] and contend that she is and not the
[1:09:19] elect that are real
[1:09:20] and authentic the false church
[1:09:24] the false will try to kill the truth
[1:09:27] that is how it was in the book of acts
[1:09:29] that is how to set forth in the century
[1:09:31] of ages
[1:09:32] and that is how it was declared in
[1:09:33] various epistles that is how it has been
[1:09:35] that is how it is now it can't change
[1:09:38] so let's be careful that we are not
[1:09:40] confused at this point
[1:09:42] thus we will seek the word to validate
[1:09:44] this claim
[1:09:45] and then he talked about the gardener
[1:09:46] eden two trees one was good
[1:09:48] one was evil one produced life one
[1:09:51] produced debt
[1:09:52] and then there are two brothers cain
[1:09:54] abel we understand that
[1:09:56] they worshipped and that order had his
[1:09:58] reflection almost done
[1:09:59] o praise god so these illustrations
[1:10:02] depicted the parable of the lord jesus
[1:10:05] christ
[1:10:06] when he said that the kingdom of the
[1:10:08] heaven was like unto a man who sowed
[1:10:10] good seed
[1:10:10] and only the enemy come and plan tears
[1:10:12] among them whose good seeds
[1:10:14] all praise the name of the lord so i
[1:10:16] realized that something has been cut
[1:10:18] short here
[1:10:19] but god is good you love him tonight oh
[1:10:22] my i wish i could
[1:10:23] hear you all but god is good i want to
[1:10:26] get one more thing here
[1:10:27] are we going to the degrees of god
[1:10:30] there's not something here i want to get
[1:10:49] okay
[1:10:53] okay
[1:10:56] all right so then um
[1:11:00] revelation two two the three i knew that
[1:11:03] i works that labor like patience how do
[1:11:05] cancer bear them are evil
[1:11:07] although i tried them would see the
[1:11:08] apostles and are not as found them liars
[1:11:11] and as born and as patients and for my
[1:11:13] name
[1:11:13] as labored and not fit how beautifully
[1:11:16] the savior praises and commands his
[1:11:18] children
[1:11:18] he takes full account of their fine
[1:11:20] spiritual attitudes and behavior
[1:11:22] he knows that there is weaknesses among
[1:11:23] them and yet he does not crowd against
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:26] isn't that just like the lord he knows
[1:11:29] how to encourage us
[1:11:30] in the right matters discourage us in
[1:11:32] the wrong matters
[1:11:33] we could all learn a good lesson right
[1:11:35] here in running the church
[1:11:37] and our families and better still
[1:11:41] we could all learn a good lesson in that
[1:11:44] god deals with each one of us
[1:11:45] in exactly this way don't ever be
[1:11:48] discouraged
[1:11:49] saint of god for god is not on gracious
[1:11:51] to forget your labors of love
[1:11:53] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[1:11:56] water to someone
[1:11:57] has a reward and blessing from the lord
[1:12:00] i know thy works
[1:12:01] thy labor by patience as he walks in the
[1:12:03] midst of his church
[1:12:04] he's aware of the suffering of his
[1:12:06] people and he cares
[1:12:09] as it was in the days of captivity in
[1:12:11] egypt when he heard their cries
[1:12:14] he who never changes still hear the
[1:12:16] cries of the oppressed
[1:12:18] as he walks among them the very word
[1:12:20] labor
[1:12:21] signifies awareness through oppression
[1:12:25] god's people do not only work for him in
[1:12:27] a label of
[1:12:28] love but they suffer for him with joy
[1:12:31] they are patient and they're in the yolk
[1:12:33] this age suffered
[1:12:35] great persecution he had to work hard to
[1:12:37] preach the gospel
[1:12:38] check for truth the high calling in life
[1:12:40] was to serve god
[1:12:42] and when their hopes and life were
[1:12:43] belighted they were patient
[1:12:45] committed all to him who had promised a
[1:12:48] lasting recompense in heaven
[1:12:49] for what they had given up for humankind
[1:12:52] i think we ought to stop here and deal
[1:12:55] with the thought
[1:12:56] that god's people have always been and
[1:12:59] always will be persecuted
[1:13:01] genesis cain abel and so like that he
[1:13:04] said listen to this something i'm gonna
[1:13:05] i won't close
[1:13:06] almost finish no matter how just an
[1:13:08] upright a christian is before the public
[1:13:10] how gracious he is to his fellow man
[1:13:13] doing not but good
[1:13:14] let him confess christ and his the
[1:13:17] operation of the gifts of the holy
[1:13:19] spirit and tongues
[1:13:20] prophecy healing and miracles and he
[1:13:22] will be condemned
[1:13:23] the spirit of this world hates the
[1:13:26] spirit of god
[1:13:27] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[1:13:29] of the lord it tries to destroy the
[1:13:31] vessel
[1:13:32] in whom the spirit of truth dwells
[1:13:35] push aha persecutions and trials a
[1:13:38] natural
[1:13:40] normal part of the christian
[1:13:44] life let me say it again
[1:13:47] so all the people who are trial weary
[1:13:50] and test weary
[1:13:52] persecution and trials a natural
[1:13:56] normal part of the christian life
[1:13:59] there's only one thing you can do about
[1:14:00] them one thing
[1:14:01] commit them all to god judge not leave
[1:14:04] the outworking
[1:14:05] and final judgment of god dog cancer via
[1:14:09] them which are evil
[1:14:10] doers try them which say the apostles
[1:14:12] and are not
[1:14:13] and has wronged them liars these
[1:14:15] ephesians
[1:14:16] believed that god's people ought to be
[1:14:20] holy h-o-l-y
[1:14:23] according to this verse they took steps
[1:14:27] to keep the body unlevened from sin
[1:14:31] most evidently the apostasy had
[1:14:34] already started sin had entered into the
[1:14:38] church
[1:14:38] but they were beaten to the words of
[1:14:40] poor when he said to put away
[1:14:43] the wicked from among them they were
[1:14:46] separated people
[1:14:47] they had come out of the world and now
[1:14:49] they weren't going to let the world
[1:14:51] enter amongst them
[1:14:52] they would not put up with sin in the
[1:14:55] church
[1:14:56] holiness as if i want to close off with
[1:14:58] them wasn't a
[1:14:59] phrase with them or a figure of speech
[1:15:03] it was a way of life let's bow our heads
[1:15:07] hallelujah heavenly father i thank you
[1:15:11] for this session lord this overview of
[1:15:13] ephesians
[1:15:14] entirely with the ephesus church and
[1:15:17] lord closing with this
[1:15:19] thought holiness wasn't a speech was a
[1:15:22] way of life
[1:15:23] father me the believers somehow may
[1:15:25] their minds be enlightened tonight
[1:15:28] may they be inspired tonight to connect
[1:15:31] with this
[1:15:32] ephesians church that was there in the
[1:15:34] beginning
[1:15:35] because that is what this message came
[1:15:37] to do father

[1:19:20] i want to see you one more time holy
[1:19:24] holy
[1:19:25] oh holy holy holy
[1:19:30] oh holy holy holy
[1:19:34] i want to see you
[1:19:38] i want to see
[1:19:42] amen god bless you tonight uh
[1:19:46] certainly blessed with the teaching
[1:19:49] tonight
[1:19:50] and there was so much tremendous that
[1:19:52] was said
[1:19:53] and um before it was in prayer
[1:19:56] you know there's this there's a
[1:19:58] scripture but i've been reading
[1:19:59] ephesians and
[1:20:01] and um you know we say it in different
[1:20:03] ways
[1:20:04] and uh i believe i would have said it uh
[1:20:07] last sunday where david encouraged
[1:20:09] himself in the lord you know and
[1:20:13] as beloved was reading this one this was
[1:20:14] ephesians 5 and 19.
[1:20:16] he said speak into yourselves
[1:20:19] in psalms so it's not just in one way
[1:20:23] it's not just of words to yourself but
[1:20:25] speaking to yourselves in psalms
[1:20:27] and hymns and spiritual songs so
[1:20:31] paul is actually making a distinction
[1:20:33] between psalms
[1:20:35] and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:20:38] singing and making melody so it's not
[1:20:40] just singing
[1:20:41] so he's making a distinction between
[1:20:43] singing and making
[1:20:45] melody in your heart to the lord and
[1:20:48] then he goes on to say
[1:20:49] giving thanks always i love
[1:20:52] when there's this displacing of a
[1:20:56] condition
[1:20:56] that you kind of debate giving thanks
[1:21:00] always for all things
[1:21:03] unto god and the father in the name of
[1:21:06] our lord jesus christ
[1:21:08] and one of the best remedies for
[1:21:12] feeling down is given thanks to god
[1:21:15] if you're ever feeling low just start to
[1:21:18] give thanks
[1:21:19] and i want to challenge you as homework
[1:21:23] from tonight into tomorrow and the next
[1:21:25] day i want you begin to give thanks
[1:21:29] and many times we don't realize how much
[1:21:33] there is to give thanks about you know
[1:21:35] we take so much for granted
[1:21:38] and if you go through your day looking
[1:21:41] for a reason to be thankful
[1:21:43] you will shock yourself the fact that
[1:21:45] you can even move your hand
[1:21:46] before you before you reach off the bed
[1:21:49] and it's at the stretch
[1:21:51] thank god to be able to stretch we could
[1:21:52] have people this morning couldn't
[1:21:54] stretch
[1:21:55] we we are rich only very yet to know
[1:21:57] just the fact
[1:21:58] that you could stretch that people can't
[1:22:01] open their eyes so before you even get
[1:22:03] off the bed
[1:22:04] you're tanking god that he could open
[1:22:05] your eyes your tongue go that he could
[1:22:07] stretch your tongue go that you can move
[1:22:08] your foot
[1:22:09] because that people have to get help to
[1:22:11] come over in them when you're tangled
[1:22:12] they can move you
[1:22:13] and i decided to go to instead of
[1:22:15] complaining they thank god for
[1:22:17] for hot water that the kettle could work
[1:22:20] that he didn't have to go and get gas at
[1:22:21] gas tank this morning
[1:22:22] and after a while to realize how much
[1:22:25] you have to thank god for
[1:22:26] and then you move from the natural and
[1:22:28] you move from the
[1:22:30] the stuff around you to the spiritual
[1:22:32] blessing of being able to give thanks
[1:22:34] to god for his word for this great
[1:22:36] message of this elijah prophet malachi
[1:22:39] 4 and how it has sustained us and
[1:22:41] knowledge us that is
[1:22:42] enough to be super thankful for tonight
[1:22:44] so i really want to appreciate and be
[1:22:46] thankful tonight for our pastor brother
[1:22:49] for
[1:22:49] this wonderful uh teaching tonight you
[1:22:51] appreciate our pastor
[1:22:52] tonight really really a blessing really
[1:22:54] and encouragement
[1:22:56] and um i want to acknowledge but uh leno
[1:22:58] terrado
[1:23:00] diolo bendigo merman but eleno is here
[1:23:03] with us
[1:23:04] he was a tremendous blessing at the
[1:23:07] convention
[1:23:08] translating in spanish and he has also
[1:23:10] been translating
[1:23:11] some of the recent messages uh in
[1:23:14] spanish as well
[1:23:15] but over and over on a brief call with a
[1:23:17] pastor from mexico and honduras
[1:23:19] yesterday or zoom call
[1:23:21] and um you know fellowshipping on one of
[1:23:24] the message
[1:23:25] uh but over preached a couple weeks ago
[1:23:27] uh feasting on the unfeeling body word

[1:23:32] and they played it
[1:23:33] in their churches and um testimonies
