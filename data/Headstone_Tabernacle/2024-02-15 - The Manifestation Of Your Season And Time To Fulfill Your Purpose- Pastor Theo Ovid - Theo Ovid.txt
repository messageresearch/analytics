into your hands in Jesus precious name and father God as we approach your word tonight may your presence coming in a special way you your people here tonight have great need Lord we confess we are such a native evil and we look to you the order and finisher of faith You Who start a good work in US is able to complete it father come on this scene tonight and speak lip to air the pillar fire drop down lord may you speak from that fire you speak from the glory Lord May May the angels descend back on forth Lord bringing Revelation bringing inspiration changing and transforming hearts and lives in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you hallu if have bibl I to turn to Luke chap 8 reading from verse 11 to1 15 and Romans chapter 8 Luke 8 and Romans chapter 8 scripture reading tonight hallelu I know we took the scripture from Matthew 13 in the camp but I want to take it from Luke chapter 8 I'm doing that on purpose we read from verse 11 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those that by the ways side and they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts least they should believe and be saved they on the Rock a day which when they hear receive word with joy these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation fall away and that which fell among torns the they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but on good ground are they which are in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bringing forth fruit with patience I want you to note the word patience there bringing forth fruit with patience and we want to turn to Romans chapter 8 want to read from verse 28 it reads and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are decalled according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren amen so that's what Jesus supposed to be the first born among many Brethren amen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemn it it is Christ that died he rather that is risen again who is the at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword for it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter n in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord let's pray father how we thank you for your word tonight and we are so blessed Lord to hear these powerful scrip and I pray father God that your presence will just have the pinenes and may your word come to light and life tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated hallelujah oh praise God blessed be the name of the Lord hallu hallelujah praise God glory and uh I will take a little inspiration from uh Ecclesiastes 3 verse1 to everything there's a season and time to every purpose under the heaven and I'll connect that to Romans 8:28 and uh I have a title the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose Hallelujah the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose amen amen oh praise God so don't be too uh anxious you have to have patience yes sir that that seed going to come ripe and mature in the camp I wanted to emphasize 30 fold 60 fold 100 fold to show that once the seed strike good ground it will bring forth am it might bring to the measure of you know of of 100% but it be 30 it'll be 60 you'll get your measure you will get your Harvest Hallelujah but tonight I want to kind of emphasize that patience because the Bible talk about the husband man waited for the fruit of the earth and he had long patience you see when you plant something you can't be so excited to try to pull the fruit out of the tree the fruit have to unfold the life have to unfold and the fruit will come in due course now if you don't plant you don't reap if you don't plant you have no Harvest but if you plant you have to wait for somebody say Amen you have to wait as we said the sewing for to sew and as he keep sewing the birds take some we say don't stop at the birds don't let the birds Show You Off Track that bird is just that's what they do they take some they can't take all some fall among rocks not all will fall among the rocks just some will fall among rocks isn't that right some will get tired with torns just some not all but some will fall on good ground so your duty is to keep on sewing Keep On Believing keep on planting keep on pressing all might hold tonight but some going to hold someday someday something going to strike you something going to open up something going to break upon you Revelation going to break upon you you don't know when tonight may be your night tonight may be a special night you could make this a special night if you declare to be so you have to speak it first like that man who was half blind and they want know what room to take him in he said this room will be perfect they describ say how you know he said I make it so praise God and you could make this night your night because you choose it to be so you declare it to be so that's what our father did he said let there be he didn't argue with the darkness he didn't say do chaos and he said let there be and he just waited until it be praise God he waited for the season and time because once God said let their beat have a season and time for that seed to come to life but every seed must bring forth after it's kind it's a law built in built in just like summer is built in and Autumn is built in and winter is built in and spring is built in and nobody could stop the season and time because God said that in the heavens and man is on Earth and they can't change what God Said in the heavens and thy word oh Lord is settled forever in the heavens and once that word is settled man on Earth cap change so once God predestinated you unto his purpose and has all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are be called according to his purpose and if you are called according to his purpose I don't care what road you have to pass you through I don't care what way he have to pass you through you're going to come through nothing going to separate you from the purpose that God elected you and predestinated you nothing will to separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus not tribulation not nakedness not poverty not depression not frustration not family issues not mind battle not even sin praise God because who he found you he called and who he call he justified what more shall we say tonight of these things if God be for us who can be against us it's time you recognize God is for you can somebody say can somebody give a shout of Praise You see how the Holy Spirit all together to everything there's a season and time to every purpose give God a shout of Praise hallelujah oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's a powerful thing to plant and Watch The Life unfold Hallelujah so if God want to show down the devil's Kingdom he just have to put in a seed a virgin shall conceive you didn't hear me tonight when he wanted to destroy and wreck the devil's Kingdom he had to put the seed so he said a virgin shall conceive and be a child his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Everlasting father Prince Mighty God Prince of Peace what God did he put a seed in in there his womb hallelujah hallelujah to booze that devil Hallelujah to knock that Si's head isn't that right he put the seed a Manch child Christ Jesus and when he want to send a a message in this day to bring a Revival in this day all you have to do is to put a seed he said the bride had no Revival is here it will take them seven Thunders and he will send it he promised he just have to put a seed oh come on say Amen somebody and when God took the prophet off the devil thought it was cut off but he s an apostle behind the prophet to keep putting on that se some fell on the way side some fell on the Rocks some walk away but some fell on good ground I feel tonight that that spoken word which is the Original Seed has found some good ground in Trinidad oh Hallelujah I believe tonight we are ready for the rain I believe tonight you are ready for your season and your time to manifest your us give the Lord some praise His People you will be seated hallelujah hallelujah so I trust that when you raise your hands up to God to worship you understand what you're doing when you raise up your hands to God to worship you are really Watering your seed you have no excuse right now tonight you are breaking into Revelation the same camel that Rebecca watered was the the same camel that took up to Isaac and the same word we are watering tonight is the same power that going to take us to where we supposed to go so you better start worshiping you better start forgetting your problems and forgetting your situation and trying to figure out and begin to praise God and join them in the Revelation chapter 5 when they say wory is the Lamb for that was redeemed us from now that thy blood when we shall rain on the earth God don't care about your problems this morning he care about your Praises because your Praises will bring the water to water the seed in you and that will solve your problem come on say Amen somebody stop studying the problem study the seed come on say Amen somebody oh give the Lord some Glory Hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and as we grow in God and grow in Grace it will become simpler and simpler not more complex no it become very simple brother B said it is way from Genesis to Revelation could be described as word made flesh full step word made flesh God want to get something done he have to put a seed he can't help it because it's word is taught expressed his thinking have to be expressed by word and once his word is seed so but the Brandon preacher M spoken word is Original Seed it have contrary seed I we see them Cor in America you all you can do is eat it you can't SE it back because his man that man tamper with that and once man tamper with that it corrupt I we say once you're born of a woman you're subject to death you have no promise or anything else but death unless it comes to the Rapture time when you're going to be Chang in a moment and that's what we all looking forward for and if it's not us it's somebody else but for the meantime we under the law of debt isn't that right but we have life within us by the word now you can only overcome by the word you can't overcome by ethics by education by degrees you can only overcome by the word not by philosophy not by TV you only overcome by the word so the devil his job is to keep you away from the word isn't that right but to be bride you have to accept the atonement in his fullness which is the fullness of the word and once you accept the fullness of the word it means that you have to be born His Image you come into the fullness of his image which is his image and likeness he not only predestinated you but unto a purpose who he found he call who he call he justified who is Justified he ha already glorified isn't that right isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord watch he predestinated what to be conformed to the image of his son so in reality you are to be M you have to manifest the word image you have to come into the word image in other words you have to become the word to be bride Hallelujah all else is just church members ah Glory oh this is good this is very good all else is church members you understand Abraham had ishma too that's right not only Isaac you understand that ishma have a great generation nation and so all the Arabs and all them all

you have to want to be born into manifestation to be bride hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you with me Glory do you understand that the 144,000 are elected seeds that are the generation coming from Abraham that God recognize out of different tribes how do God seeing the generation after generation he know them by name he said 10,000 from this tribe 10,000 from that tribe 10,000 144,000 by name oh Hallelujah notice when people are called they are called by name who he form you he call he call you my name but not your literal name is the mystery of the book being unfolded to you that reveals your name to you and when you see your name your husband can keep you your wife can keep you children can keep your mama brother it have nothing to do with d it's not a family business God

saying back what somebody say the whole family talking the same talk same head when the when the whole family wrong when one person wrong get a wrong message the whole family have a wrong message

brother say what your mother say what your father say what your sister say what nobody say because you are individual that have to have Revelation and that's the faith that you have to approach God to get your breakr Hallelujah too many people looking for uncle and tanty and somebody do for them praise God looking for entitlement and all you have entitled to do is to work and every place you put

Life Le in Adam's condition he partake of it butam call it in the season the unrighteous partaking of the Holy Ghost oh yes contrary life trying to access power see so God wouldn't allow that he has to make sure life is right it's not even gift because gift and calling is without repentance these brothers these Apostles and people in the old in New Testament they had the virtues in them they had these seven rainbow inside them those Sarah was flying all back and forth around them the Judgment Throne was in Peter's heart that's why when anaz and of thought was brother Peter that they know all these years only to find out somebody else was sitting on that man's Throne that Throne went from Heaven to Christ and that Throne went from Christ into Peter and nobody could see him touch him and but but Angels brought back and forth where he walk Angels walking come now you understand why the Angels walk with these men you understand when they went to prison the angel was with them wherever they went the Lord himself went with them wherever wherever wherever it doesn't matter if they're going in the grocery it doesn't matter if they go in the supermarket wherever they go God is going

live voice where is the life hallelujah hallelujah people walking around with hate chains of hate chains of anger things of bad attitude not even seeing the Lord they seeing flesh and blood they fight with flesh and blood they want to confront flesh and blood they want to question Flesh and Blood they're not questioning God hallelujah look at job when he begin to be strip strip strip and Jo begin to question stuff and begin to talk to God and and God say answer me like a man where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth talk to me man Hallelujah talk to me something man oh man where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth what you talking about Hallelujah I invite the devil to check you out cuz I know what's inside of you is greater than what the devil could put around

could be squealing balling sick and body that have nothing to do with that thundering seed that's in your soul and the seed of all the potential the seed of all the life the seed of all the ability

God want your life Jesus was hungry one time he come by a fig tree he could do some good boiled fig cook fig it had no fig he cursed it it wasn't the season for fix he was showing when that when that he had power to curse the tree from the root stop then he went on in a deeper Parable I love him I love him I love how he teaches I love how he unfold things he talk about in John 15 if you're bad in

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah do you understand the spirit writes the word do you understand the spirit follows the blood do you understand the water is what the disciples was waiting on in the upper room amen do you understand the seed was already in them they didn't have more teachings to get Jesus already unfold the Old Testament to them he already unlocked the understanding isn't that right so now all they want is word is all they want was water and I'm saying that the bride have to come to a spot where all they want is water now when you see the fruit come forth the fruit could only grow so much and no more the mang only read so much and was after while it have no more it done grow after only ring [Applause] [Music] time I wonder if all the food value already in then is only riping time then you need hot du lion you ready for rain yet if God said rain and your see right see go rot when your seed mature it come like the corn the corn is growing have the husk isn't that right if the corn is Young you pull it out you can't bury that you can't dry that the corn have to be mature and when it mature you know long time Farmers they hang it up them young people would know what tie it up hang it up on a string and you dry everything dry you see dry corn it drying drying drying looking like a dead no you ain't going and make that boil corn you will break your teeth you have to get false teeth after that so you're not touching that that is not for boiling that passing boiling stage certain stage you can't boil it so one time is boil corn next time is roast corn when it pass that stage is dry corn to plant Hallelujah so you're going drying up there and my goodness that is what you want you want to plant a holy a corn this what God did so he come to a spot where you have to get Dry Bake you out some wife you bake out want to see some the children have you out sometime your husband help bake you out but the problem is the thing is God want you bake out sometime the boss help bake you out coworkers have bake you out trials have bake you out fire B will B you out all kind of troubles to help bake you out so you get out your human Spirit you you start to trust God my trust is in you why because you're trust in yourself all the time listen to this from per perfect this is brother brandom he's praying he said there may be some here this morning Lord that has emptied themselves up okay let me back up a little bit he said now and there may be others out into the land where these safes will go where little humble women and men will take them into the homes and into the tribes out into the other lands may they hear Lord and understand empty themselves up so that the Holy Spirit can fill them and there may be some even here this morning Lord that has emptied themselves up since we started speaking and has listen and has realized that they have trusted too much in their own thoughts of their own ability trusting in the shrewdness of their own simple human mind which is nothing but filthiness before God oh God may they just empty themselves out now humbly submitting themselves and come for the filling of the spirit amen granted Lord amen you see the thing about it along long life's journey along the way what had happened is that people leave the Holy Spirit and they begin to use the cunning of their own mind and that bring out spirit and man Church politics so then people begin to be manipulative and controlling because they want influence but it end up being man's influence and not God's influence so then what end up happening is that the influence of the Holy Spirit become placed upon man and then now that man become a pope eventually then all of God's presence that's supposed to be among the people people end up Upon A man that become Antichrist Spirit isn't that right but God is a god of the audience so he want to release his Spirit among the people because he want to manifest himself as the god of his people now remember ministers supposed to be servants Hallelujah not power mad people supposed to be servants we supposed to put on the apron and bring the big tree to serve you it's not we are the important people you are We Are The Messengers to bring message to you hallelujah praise God maybe you get that anybody could be a minister toct scriptures and read scripture but very few going to be servants and God show me that since in Kyo it take a certain quality to be a servant a servant comes to serve not to be served and Jesus said the son of man come to serve not to be served and that's why in feet washing you have washed one 's feet to show that you're humbling one towards the other and Jesus is the one that washed your feet first and when Peter declined he busted Peter he said if you David don't let me do this you don't part of me praise God because the son of man not come to be served but to serve you understand that so you are very important to God why would a King die for you why would a King die for you and send Messengers to give you love letters Hallelujah every service is a love letter praise God every service is a word from God if it could State me out of the way and recognize wait a minute what is that man saying to me no what is God saying to you God have to use somebody he has to use a man Hallelujah could I find a man that I could pull out of the way that I could influence my people then you are influenced by the word then you are influenced by God then you no longer govern by human spirit that tra you into your own thing but you break

grocery they don't even want to park the car and walk that's right a little B they want to drive inside the pharmacy that's how people are they want to come right up the lap and that's what I love God how God is he saw Moses bringing them up to the land he saw Joshua Crossing them into the land Hallelujah never nothing out to the elders never tell the elders anything he talk to Joshua he say Joshua

that mean you C to come into the fullness of [Applause] patience waiting for your fruit you may be seated what was E problem she couldn't wait the word tell them multiply and replenish but God didn't tell them how that was a further Revelation to unfold to them the devil come to show Eve how and it wasn't by God's divine plan sex wasn't original in other words the spoken word supposed to come to speak to Eve to bring forth another seed another spoken with son the devil bring it at the flesh level oh Hallelujah that wasn't even original Hallelujah that was not the original so when Jesus came he said you must be born again of the word and the spirit in other words you have to come back to spoken word so he hide the SE in the gospel and he said we preach the gospel is foolishness to them who perish but to us who believe it is life oh give the Lord some Praises my God Terry but ter I'm enjoying myself tonight do you understand the power of the word was put in the gospel and when the gospel is preached the devil get hold it because the son of man sewing the seed in your heart and every seed brother night's going to bring for after kind Give the Lord some Praises [Applause] people [Music] Halles Hallelujah when God want to you think God couldn't let Pharaoh get a heart attack and let them children of Israel run over them Egyptians and beat them up understand this there were Millions there were thousands and thousands of they were multiplying like like the sand under Pharaoh but Pharaoh had the whip Pharaoh had the power you think God couldn't out but when he want us to deliver he's put [Music] seed mes Hallelujah hold you see you see God have to get the right one what if you are the right one tonight help me please I want you to I want you to ride with me now what what if you are the one God waiting on all this time one Moses bringing out 2 million people Moses is the right one sir one Abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I what I'm about to do seeing he's he of the earth you you you you underestimate who you are you you don't know who you are yet but at that day you shall know you don't understand you just struggling in your mortality and your emotions and your sad face or your angry face or your surprise face or your joy face and you have all these faces you make my God all these different emotions and you're acting up and whatnot and that have nothing to do with the mystery below that amen let me just PE you now say the woman at the well now she was depressed is not a nice thing to be living kind of contrary life everybody know everybody seen you and your contrary and what it's not it's not a nice thing for any woman to go through that and so on she's in that mode that's her emotion she's depressed Jesus come and say woman water please he has no bucket he know you have no bucket you can't go by no well with no bucket who just go by well without bucket you have to have a well you know was a pipe you open like that it's well it's bucket it's somebody to pull it up pull it down but Jesus told the disciples and needs past TR Samaria that sound like I needs to find [Applause] you so then then then he begin to talk to the woman he was sent there because her name was in the book and she didn't know am so the mystery have to unfold to her which is mystery not not paper mystery so God ask some of your family and loved ones waiting for you to become a living mystery God don't ordain them to hear no paper mystery you have to be Christ the mystery being revealed to them when them want to see God God say look me there in you come on you should be screaming and shouting what a privileged people we are to be chosen of God elected [Music] Jacob had to become Israel it was the 12 tribes of Jacob come on now it wasn't the 12 tribes of Jacob it was the 12 tribe of Israel but Jacob had to turn right man doing contrary things Hallelujah right woman doing contrary things but they have to have a turn there's a season time to get that turn maybe tonight is that night to get that turn Hallelujah thing in your life not supposed to be in life but maybe tonight is that 10 you have to believe it now you have to receive it you have to believe it now that tonight is a turning point in your life glory to God hallelujah a cut off point God God told them the Egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we got to believe in godall give me seated I think brother George and but ter was telling me I think during the Sixth Day War I think it was that's some so much of Supernatural things happen on the battlefield and them enemy drop the tank and drop the guns and run engine running they just run they seen Supernatural things they drop things and run because God was with Israel getting the people back to the Homeland and so forth getting them back into to overcome the syrians and to overcome all them Arabs and different kind of things like that could you imagine God say if you stay with my word I'll let your enemy flee from you could you imagine you Believers coming back to the point that you could expect God to run your enemies I'll be an enemy to your enemy I'll fight for you no weapon form against you will prosper you're not walking life fearful oh God this going to happen forget about it if God before us come on now who can be against us hallelujah if God before you who can be against you you may be seated praise God when you start to connect to a reality of the omnipotence of God and veiling to these brothers L hear this it wasn't car time in that time was donkey and and camel so so Moses and Abraham them C Lord s s a 28c that can't be the prayer Lord Lord Lord you can send a Ben for or or long Maxi taxi to help next T these people out you Jour too long that prayer is not going to be answered God could say the max taxi there but that is not the age according to my script quite down here so you have to ask good that your soul way out that your shoe way out that your sandals are way out that's the prayer [Applause] because that season Maxi season on plane season that shoes sandals donkey planting land songs tambourine you name it that's where we go so other words if you were to church in this day see you you TI and what waving your pal and you're heading out to Egypt praise God you're going to the promised land yes now I know andore keeping you you know you the ones that follow D Andora D is a two by the just leave them alone forget d Andor you understand I'm saying then because them saying let's go back to Egypt because they had position down there but you saying you're going to a place you never went before but where God taken us we never went before this omnipotence this Glory we talk about it we preach about it but we haven't tasted of it we know about to taste this thing this is a good land you know it's 30 plus years we waiting to taste this thing you know we only hear prophecies about it brother bam had it he demonstrated it he had living gospel he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord he is here I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God and the angel is there to manifest the gospel oh Hallelujah we prophesy that what you see temporarily will be manifested in his fullness Hallelujah as we come down to the spot as we come to The Headstone as we come to the capsu anointed oh Hallelujah super Church a super race omnipotent speaking the miraculous taking place you know what's awaking us missing limbs being restored oh Hallelujah could you imagine somebody with no foot and you said foot Comfort we don't caught somebody with eyes and you can say I [Applause] comfort help me Jesus you may be seated what problem you have what problem you have you problem is a lack of faith I trust that God help you and begin to trust God you pray for the pastor you pray for the minister and really begin to trust God look how God teaches prophets and so on he bring Ezekiel down to the valley of dry bones he said look at them bones and Jesus said Lo is very dry there one thing to had Dry Bones you but when he very dry it was really dry but them BS are looking like silver bones White Bones Dry Bones he said Can these bones live what you trying to do teach him teach him don't doubt teach him don't watch the situation don't don't look through your eyes ask God to look through the eyes of God hallelujah people see Flesh and Blood this one do me and that one do me and this one hinder me and that's one keeping blessing that's foolishness that say you and your horrid Spirit messed up chains around your life Hallelujah you're not seeing God Paul said I come among you in fear and trembling to see Jesus Christ and him crucify I reject this Flesh and Blood foolishness Hallelujah let I say somebody drum dead I walk over them I walk to the side of them you think I hold them no go one this one backslide this one gone I se this one forget about it I have nothing to do with that all the fire given me will come all how God me the PRI to they will come that's how always been I ain't sent for none of you praise God your choos this way is the hard way it's the now stop complaining do you it do you it you said like how you are that's not your problem that's not my problem God's problem God make the man for the hour he make the man for the child of hour Hallelujah I am built to be here now I am build myself god build me and he put something in me to handle things a certain way to get a certain result to have a effect we going to have a Revival I don't care what the devil say nothing going to separate us from the love of God in Christ [Applause] Jesus you be seated watch watch how Paul said it who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified she so and so that sister so and so Peter deny Christ this one do this this one do that oh yeah but here the scriptures it's not you that justify it it's not your thoughts that justify it it is God that's right that justifies amen if you hear and read what d uh Jacob did you want to know how he become a prince he wasn't easy what Noah did what David did what Solomon did what all them did they were Flesh and Blood just that's right but it is God that's right that justify [Applause] Hallelujah I love it Hallelujah that's why I know God don't have to ask nobody permission to bless me God don't have to ask nobody permission shall I bless this brother shall I bless as you think no nobody holding your ticking papers nobody a don't let nobody correct your papers that's what they want to do they want to judge you they want to correct your papers don't let them correct your papers let God correct the papers because when they brought the woman to Jesus said listen we have plenty points against her she failed this exam she failed this moral life we caught in adultery look she complete F hall Hall you say okay why all bring all the exam let me test all and see pass it bring the paper from the inside not the outside paper you're looking good on the outside but bring the inside paper let me check your paper them fell say you know what I can't wait for this exam I goone nobody would Jesus correct the paper nobody want to bring the inside paper which one of you without sin cast the first stone you see a c see Gile but you could see somebody fail here and fall there you can't see hypocrisy you can't see somebody smiling for your face and stabbing in your back you somebody lying and twisting things you can't see that with unclean objective you can't see somebody craves and somebody arrogant excessive Pride you can't see that but these are things in the spirit realm sir sir you can't see somebody filthy Spirit but these are things in the spirit realm that's right that's right so Jesus in his Spirit realm seeing them Hypocrites the naked before him understand this in your cloth right now you Hallelujah Anthony said something these Adam and Eve were so veiled with the Holy Ghost they didn't even know they were naked and they were but it was withheld from them because of the veil over them that same Veil is to come upon [Applause] us we never had a veil before [Applause] hallu Glory my God I'm in Heavenly places tonight you know what is to be veiled from your past Hallelujah and when you go in your pass you go back to [Applause] Eden oh jesusall you know what it is to be chosen and to be seen as if you never did it you never sinned never failed God see you as as if you never did it he sink it so low in a SE the sea of forgetfulness he himself can't remember [Applause] it he can't even bring it up you you didn't hear me tonight this place will be exploding tonight when God drop it in the sea of forgetfulness he himself can't [Applause] remember you what that some beat you know we can go and find some bottle and pick it up you know that the sea of forgetfulness when it drop it drop so when Jesus told up woman woman where are th accusers she said none my Lord he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more in other words woman you are free and who the son of man set [Applause] freeall let me let me wrap up here oh Lord waa I'm I'm going to close hallelujah oh this is oh I I'm trying to get through this and I'm not getting anywhere I want to read something that us to introduce what I want to preach tonight and service is over it's already done oh my my my my my my but God is good he wants you to understand the mystery is that you are the seed itself am the Pentecostal was shock so therefore when fire and dynamic TR the Pentecostal all they could do is Manifest tongues and so forth when your Dynamic St you to manifest seven Living [Applause] Voices in other words you have to bring on the war that the devil started in heaven that fell on the earth in Genesis you taking on that end part in the last days when I'll close with this when the devil realizes the bride has escaped the Bible said he'll make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that is church members who haven't come into a manifestation all they have is intellectual they haven't come into the oil you see so one part is the water spirit another part Spirit oil wise virgin Hallelujah they have the seven altars they have the sacrifice but no oil the strange thing about this oil and we're going to call this oil charity the oil of Charity Hall to get charity it needs faith and that faith is based on forgiveness Hallelujah so therefore to access the Skylight you have to come true brotherly kindness watch not people brotherly kindness no Spirit of Brotherly kind Hallelujah so God has to allow people to do you wrong that's the only way for that to come forward God has to let people push you around and if you fight it I want nobody push me WR I let yeah yeah I want people to I want to push WR I want to see push you could take because only the person who God could push around God could [Applause] use you see some powerful things tonight yeah could God push you around or are you like a bulldozer am moving well God will move around you that's right that's right cuz you were moving and God want to move you to do the job you see you see you see when David was in the backside and dealing with the bear and the lion that's David experience God want to move him from the back side to the front side David right now on the back of the book cast send me back all the time you understand me that's why he take from the back and put it on the seventh fold on under the in the seven seal so he put the tunders on the back he put it in front but hide it from the devil so then move David now from the back and bring him to the front to Ser him his father said take them Roy take them sandwiches and carry it for your brother serve them if David had attitude I I go and see them brothers already always have that Breen Brethren Brothers whoever it is jph Brothers this brothers that Brothers always
