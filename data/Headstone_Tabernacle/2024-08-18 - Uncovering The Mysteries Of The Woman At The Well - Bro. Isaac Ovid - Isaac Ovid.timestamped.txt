[56:16] enemy knows that time is short and we
[56:19] have seen an intensifying of the attack
[56:22] but this is what we were trained to
[56:24] expect this is what we were born to
[56:26] address this is what we were
[56:28] commissioned to deal with so we are
[56:30] unfazed Lord by what the enemy is doing
[56:33] in this hour because as the last Lord
[56:36] the last group of people for the last
[56:38] great kill as your Prophet said we stand
[56:41] ready father knowing that the host of
[56:43] angels are behind us Lord when Elijah
[56:46] stood on the earth he told his servant
[56:48] go look again and when he said open up
[56:50] this boy's eyes he said they are more
[56:52] for us than against us so this morning

[56:56] are more for us than against us father

[57:43] we say House of hell you have no power
[57:45] house of Hell give weight in the name of
[57:47] the Lord Jesus Christ we know in whom we

[57:53] this morning so father may you get Glory
[57:55] and Honor to your Holy Name may you
[57:58] bless the service today here lord and
[58:00] there are so many services around the

[58:09] true worshippers are worshiping in

[58:53] may you touch me a fresh may you use me
[58:55] as your mic phone in the mighty glorious
[58:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[58:59] church says and the church says amen are
[59:04] you happy to be in the house of the Lord
[59:05] this
[59:06] morning blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:11] hallelujah so certainly good to be back
[59:13] in the house of the Lord and certainly
[59:16] grateful for your prayers for your
[59:18] support for the
[59:21] encouragement and if you have your
[59:24] Bibles let's just turn to two portions
[59:26] of
[59:28] scripture so that we can take our
[59:30] seats reading from Isaiah
[59:35] 49 reading from verse
[59:43] one
[59:50] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:54] Isaiah 49 and also reading from St John
[1:00:01] 4 and this is a powerful scripture in
[1:00:04] Isaiah just a kind of lay a foundation
[1:00:05] for a few things we'll touch Isaiah 49:1
[1:00:08] listen o
[1:00:10] Isles that's that's Islands that's
[1:00:12] Beyond the Seas listen oh Al unto me and
[1:00:15] hearken ye people from
[1:00:17] afar so this is Isaiah speaking and he's
[1:00:20] not speaking to those within close
[1:00:21] proximity he's speaking to those that
[1:00:23] are not within the sound of his voice he
[1:00:26] is speaking I dare say to us this
[1:00:29] morning listen oh is unto me and hearken
[1:00:32] you people from far the Lord had called
[1:00:34] me from the womb from the bowels of my
[1:00:36] mother had he made mention of my name
[1:00:39] and he had made my mouth like a sharp
[1:00:41] sword you know the word is sharper than
[1:00:43] any two it sword in the shadow of his
[1:00:45] hand had he hid me and made me a
[1:00:48] polished
[1:00:49] shaft in his quiver had he hid me and
[1:00:52] said unto me thou art my servant o
[1:00:54] Israel in whom I will be
[1:00:57] glorified then I said I have labored in
[1:00:59] vain I have spent my strength for not
[1:01:01] and in vain yet surely my judgment is
[1:01:03] with the Lord and my work with my God
[1:01:05] and now say the Lord that formed me from
[1:01:07] the womb to be his servant to bring
[1:01:11] Jacob unto him which is a Ministry of
[1:01:13] reconciliation Redemption though Israel
[1:01:16] be not gathered so he's speaking to the
[1:01:19] fact that Israel is scattered though
[1:01:21] Israel be not gathered though Israel be
[1:01:24] not together though Israel be not in one
[1:01:26] place yet shall I be glorious in the
[1:01:29] eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my
[1:01:32] strength so Isaiah is speaking but it's
[1:01:35] really the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:37] Christ is identifying here right and he
[1:01:39] said it is a light thing that thou
[1:01:41] should as be my servant to raise up the
[1:01:44] tribes of Jacob so this is not Isaiah
[1:01:46] can't raise up the tribes of Jacob but
[1:01:48] this is the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:01:50] to restore the preserved of Israel so
[1:01:52] there's a preserved of Israel and I will
[1:01:55] also give thee for a light to the
[1:01:58] Gentiles that thou mayest be my
[1:02:01] salvation unto the end of the Earth and
[1:02:04] let's go to St John 4 and we're going to
[1:02:06] read from verse
[1:02:08] one when therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:02:13] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[1:02:17] baptized more disciples than John though
[1:02:21] Jesus himself baptized not but his
[1:02:24] disciples he left Judea and
[1:02:27] departed again into Galilee and he must
[1:02:31] needs go through
[1:02:33] Samaria then cometh he to a city of
[1:02:35] Samaria which is called SAA near to the
[1:02:39] pel of ground that Jacob gave to his son
[1:02:44] Joseph and Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:02:48] therefore being Wei with his journey sat
[1:02:51] thus on the well and it was about the
[1:02:54] sixth hour may the Lord add a blessing
[1:02:57] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:03:00] seated in the presence of the
[1:03:02] Lord hallelujah glor everybody feeling
[1:03:05] fine amen happy to be in the presence of
[1:03:07] the Lord in such a time as this
[1:03:10] Hallelujah when the lid of hell is open
[1:03:13] and streams of demon powers are loosed
[1:03:15] on the earth to try to stop this bride
[1:03:17] from coming to Perfection but we know
[1:03:20] that nothing could stop this bride from
[1:03:22] coming to Perfection we know that
[1:03:24] nothing could stop you from ful
[1:03:25] fulfilling your purpose we know that no
[1:03:28] weapon that is even formed against you
[1:03:30] could Prosper we know that the steps of
[1:03:32] the righteous are ordered by God we know
[1:03:35] that my help coming from the Lord we
[1:03:38] know that the present trials and the
[1:03:40] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:03:42] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:03:44] which shall be revealed in us we come
[1:03:47] into the house of God with Thanksgiving
[1:03:48] and singing and worship knowing that God
[1:03:51] is more than able to do what he said he
[1:03:53] would do we come to push back on enemy
[1:03:56] we come that like talk about if you
[1:03:59] don't have any teeth you use your gum to
[1:04:00] fight the enemy but nothing going to
[1:04:02] stop you from doing all you could do for
[1:04:04] the glory of God and there's a plan
[1:04:07] there's a great plan and a purpose for
[1:04:08] us being here this morning you feel that
[1:04:10] way this morning so I have a title this
[1:04:13] morning Hallelujah uncovering the
[1:04:16] mysteries of the woman at the well
[1:04:19] uncovering the mysteries of the woman at
[1:04:22] the well and a subject and unlike L
[1:04:26] bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles
[1:04:30] and an inspiration the unfolding Plan of
[1:04:34] Redemption so I'm going to take my time
[1:04:36] this morning good to be back into the
[1:04:38] seat I'm going to take my time get my
[1:04:41] rhythm this morning and we'll see what
[1:04:43] the Lord will do but I know but the
[1:04:45] Clarence the devil is in trouble Satan
[1:04:48] is mad because the B the B said once the
[1:04:51] bride gets to know who she is then it's
[1:04:53] it's finished and everything that the
[1:04:55] enemy is doing is try to get you to not
[1:04:57] see who you are because the moment you
[1:04:59] understand who you are and see it by
[1:05:00] divine revelation then you understand
[1:05:02] the authority that's locked up in you
[1:05:05] because Authority is ours power belongs
[1:05:07] to God God gives power to those with the
[1:05:10] authority and when power and authority
[1:05:12] comes together then the sick cannot stay
[1:05:14] sick the dead cannot stay dead those
[1:05:16] that don't know can stay in ignorance
[1:05:18] because he comes to those that are in
[1:05:19] ignorant he'll come in the middle of
[1:05:21] your marriage he'll come in the middle
[1:05:22] of your home he'll come in the middle of
[1:05:24] your life can the ch say
[1:05:28] Amen so I want to just build a
[1:05:31] foundation so we know that everything
[1:05:33] leading up to this time has been this
[1:05:35] great Plan of Redemption and that's why
[1:05:37] the inspiration is the unfolding Plan of
[1:05:39] Redemption because when man fell God
[1:05:42] told himself I'm not going to leave it
[1:05:43] this way and we know the lamb was slain
[1:05:45] before the foundation of the world so
[1:05:47] Redemption was already in motion before
[1:05:49] man was even here Redemption was in the
[1:05:51] thoughts of God you were in the thoughts
[1:05:53] of God before you even born you were in
[1:05:56] the thoughts of God uh in the middle of
[1:05:57] your trial you were in the thoughts of
[1:05:59] God God is not now thinking about you in
[1:06:02] the middle of your trial he thought
[1:06:04] about you before you even had a trial he
[1:06:06] thought about you before you even had a
[1:06:08] situation he thought about you before
[1:06:10] you had no
[1:06:11] money he thought about you before you
[1:06:13] had a headache he thought about you
[1:06:15] before you were sick he thought about
[1:06:17] you before you were depressed can the
[1:06:19] church say
[1:06:22] Amen Plan of Redemption and every
[1:06:25] Apostle every Prophet every King every
[1:06:28] single piece of this great plan that
[1:06:30] started in Genesis was leading up to
[1:06:32] something can the church say Amen in the
[1:06:35] message
[1:06:36] identification brother Bram said and
[1:06:38] when he seen that his creation had
[1:06:41] fallen Hallelujah now his own loving
[1:06:44] character this is the character of God
[1:06:47] molded himself into the person of Christ
[1:06:50] his nature expressed itself his
[1:06:53] character expressed itself he couldn't
[1:06:55] help himself because it was who he was
[1:06:59] he was love he was Mercy he is love he
[1:07:03] is Mercy he is redemption he is healing
[1:07:06] the very definition of God is love so he
[1:07:09] couldn't help himself his character had
[1:07:12] no choice but to express itself in the
[1:07:15] man Christ Hallelujah brother Bram goes
[1:07:19] on no one could ever do that but God
[1:07:21] this was done so he could pay the
[1:07:23] penalty of the fall of his creation
[1:07:25] brother brandham goes and he said there
[1:07:27] must be something to save this
[1:07:29] creation and nothing could save it
[1:07:32] listen because the highest species of
[1:07:34] his creation had fallen in other words
[1:07:37] when man fell this was the highest
[1:07:44] species hallu hallu this was the highest
[1:07:48] species that God had created and but
[1:07:50] Bram said and everything under it fell
[1:07:54] with it because it fell there's only one
[1:07:57] thing left that did not fall listen to
[1:07:59] the listen to The Prophet now and that
[1:08:01] was
[1:08:03] God so brother Bram said when man fell
[1:08:06] he tued down the entire thing with him
[1:08:08] because he was the highest point of
[1:08:10] God's creation in other words when God
[1:08:13] created Man In His Image he was more
[1:08:15] important than the sun the Stars the
[1:08:17] Earth he was more important than the
[1:08:18] trees and nature no wonder the whole
[1:08:21] creation is groaning the whole of
[1:08:24] creation not part of creation
[1:08:26] come on now he said the whole of
[1:08:28] creation is groaning for the
[1:08:30] manifestation of the sons of
[1:08:33] God because when man fell the entire of
[1:08:36] creation was broken and mother Bram said
[1:08:39] only one thing did not fall and that was
[1:08:42] the Lord himself so the only way for
[1:08:44] Redemption to come was for the Lord
[1:08:46] himself to get involved in his creation
[1:08:50] you don't hear me this morning oh
[1:08:53] Hallelujah I'm building something
[1:08:55] something this is the prophet's word now
[1:08:57] there's only one thing left that did not
[1:09:00] fall and that was God the heavens so
[1:09:02] something of the heavens had to come
[1:09:05] down to redeem this creation because
[1:09:08] there was nothing here that could create
[1:09:10] it nothing you could do could ever
[1:09:12] redeem yourself your best efforts could
[1:09:14] not save yourself your best idea cannot
[1:09:17] save yourself but when God saw this and
[1:09:20] some man had fallen saw the trees Fallen
[1:09:23] saw the animals Fallen saw sickness
[1:09:26] coming saw death coming the Lord himself
[1:09:28] said I got to fix the problem because he
[1:09:31] was the only one that wasn't Fallen I
[1:09:32] want you to remember Angels fell also
[1:09:36] Angels left their estate so Angels
[1:09:39] themselves were subject to a spirit of
[1:09:41] falling but the only thing that could
[1:09:42] never fall is the Lord himself so it had
[1:09:45] to take the Lord himself to unfold for
[1:09:48] himself I want you to catch that unfold
[1:09:52] for himself The Plan of Redemption
[1:09:55] can I go on a bit are you with me this
[1:09:58] morning can you help me preach this
[1:09:59] morning the Lord is not going to trust
[1:10:02] anybody else with his Plan of Redemption
[1:10:04] he is taking personal responsibility for
[1:10:08] the Plan of Redemption he is taking
[1:10:10] personal responsibility for every name
[1:10:13] on the book he is taking personal
[1:10:16] responsibility once your name is on the
[1:10:18] book he is looking for you once your
[1:10:20] name is on the book he is coming for you
[1:10:23] once your name is on the book he he's
[1:10:25] going to deliver you somebody preached
[1:10:28] back to me this morning he's not leaving
[1:10:30] that to the preacher he's not even
[1:10:32] leaving it to a prophet he's not even
[1:10:34] leaving it to a messenger he is taking
[1:10:37] personal responsibility for
[1:10:42] Redemption Hallelujah I'm not talking
[1:10:45] about preaching I'm talking about
[1:10:47] Redemption I'm talking about bringing
[1:10:49] you back to Eden bringing you back to
[1:10:52] Authority bringing you back to Power
[1:10:54] that's not my job it's not your pastor's
[1:10:57] job the Lord himself is taking personal
[1:11:02] responsibility for Redemption it's his
[1:11:06] plan it's his plan it's his plan and
[1:11:10] he's not trusting his plan with anybody
[1:11:13] you don't hear me this morning can the
[1:11:15] Church Say Amen
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:39] Hallelujah don't worry about your son if
[1:11:42] her name is on the book God is taking
[1:11:45] personal responsibility oh don't worry

[1:11:49] daughter don't worry about your husband
[1:11:51] don't worry about your wife don't worry
[1:11:53] about your situation he is taking
[1:11:55] personal responsibility he's not leaving
[1:11:58] it to an angel he's not leaving it to a
[1:12:01] preacher he's not even leaving it to the
[1:12:03] fold Ministry we're talking about
[1:12:05] Redemption I'm not talking about
[1:12:07] salvation I'm talking about Redemption
[1:12:10] he is the only one who knows the inside
[1:12:13] inside of the Plan of
[1:12:16] Redemption Redemption by Blood

[1:12:22] redeeming you bringing you back
[1:12:34] hallelujah hallelujah anybody in the
[1:12:37] house this
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:44] morning but over told me to take my time
[1:12:47] I want to take my time but we're going
[1:12:49] to leave here with the George with a
[1:12:51] knockout punch with the Enemy because
[1:12:54] let not get ahead of myself you may be
[1:12:56] seated for a
[1:12:58] moment so something of the
[1:13:01] heavens had to come down to redeem this
[1:13:04] creation because there was nothing here
[1:13:08] in this terrestrial Dimension that could
[1:13:11] solve the
[1:13:14] problem natural solutions cannot solve
[1:13:17] spiritual
[1:13:18] problems and God's Own love for the
[1:13:21] World created the
[1:13:23] character that was expressed in Christ
[1:13:27] he was God's
[1:13:29] character he was God's expressed image
[1:13:32] in him was God God in Christ revealing
[1:13:37] himself to the world and no love could
[1:13:40] ever be greater than that love that such
[1:13:43] a person would become what he did in
[1:13:46] order to
[1:13:47] redeem what had been
[1:13:52] lost can we go on
[1:13:55] in the unveiling of
[1:13:57] God we're going to talk a little
[1:13:59] bit read some quotes do a little bible
[1:14:03] study we in church on Sunday is the
[1:14:05] Lord's day
[1:14:07] notice there sometime I say I'm going
[1:14:09] not going to be too long with you but
[1:14:11] brother Clarence you notice I didn't do
[1:14:20] that we're going to take our time this
[1:14:23] morning in the UN of God the prophet
[1:14:26] said and when Jesus
[1:14:27] came he was the
[1:14:29] word in its
[1:14:32] fullness because the whole plan I want
[1:14:35] you to underline those words in your
[1:14:37] mind the whole Plan of Redemption laid
[1:14:41] in him the whole plan not a piece of the
[1:14:45] plan the whole Plan of Redemption didn't
[1:14:48] lay in Moses so in other words Moses
[1:14:50] only had a measure of the portion of the
[1:14:53] plan that God allowed him to see and he
[1:14:55] couldn't see anything more because it
[1:14:57] was the unfolding of a plan brother
[1:15:00] brandham goes on the whole Plan of
[1:15:02] Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't
[1:15:05] lay in Joseph didn't lay in
[1:15:07] Elijah see they were only part of the
[1:15:11] word pointing to it see now notice keep
[1:15:15] your thought here it comes as I say see
[1:15:17] the whole plan wasn't in them they were
[1:15:19] pointing to it so now I want to get to
[1:15:22] this scripture that we read
[1:15:25] in St
[1:15:28] John and we're going to do a little
[1:15:31] bible
[1:15:33] study a little bit if that's okay with
[1:15:37] you and see some things in here
[1:15:41] that we would have seen but maybe we
[1:15:43] want to take a next look at it so St
[1:15:46] John 4 finds it at a very interesting
[1:15:49] point in scripture now the Book of John
[1:15:52] is unique it doesn't bring out the G
[1:15:55] genealogy like the Book of Matthew and
[1:15:57] this one beg got this one and this one
[1:15:59] beg this one John starts off simply with
[1:16:01] a declaration in the beginning was the
[1:16:03] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:16:05] Word was God he he get straight he just
[1:16:08] punching right away out of out the gate
[1:16:10] there's no
[1:16:12] buildup there's no there's no warmer
[1:16:14] period with John John just goes straight
[1:16:16] for it in the beginning was the word if
[1:16:17] you didn't know and the Word was with
[1:16:19] God and the Word was
[1:16:21] God
[1:16:23] GL he goes down to verse 11 he came into
[1:16:26] his own and his own receive him not he
[1:16:28] he actually is speaking what is
[1:16:30] happening and coming to conclusions
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:34] away everybody with me so by the time we
[1:16:37] get to St John
[1:16:39] 4 a few things would have
[1:16:42] happened Jesus would have been baptized
[1:16:45] by John in fact John picks it up he
[1:16:48] would have gone through the Wilderness
[1:16:50] he would have called a few of his
[1:16:51] disciples and in St John 2 is where they
[1:16:55] he would have gone to the wedding in
[1:16:57] canaa which was Jesus first miracle
[1:16:59] everybody with me
[1:17:01] right so John 2 is wedding in Kaa first
[1:17:05] miracle John 3 is Jesus almost is the
[1:17:09] first big aspect of doctrine that we
[1:17:11] could preach because this is when
[1:17:12] Nicodemus come to him and say how what
[1:17:14] what what what what can a man do and
[1:17:17] Jesus bring out you must be born again
[1:17:19] everybody with
[1:17:20] me Jesus would have cleansed the temple
[1:17:24] and he is now baptizing and because of
[1:17:25] what's happening with the baptism and
[1:17:27] the Pharisees here Jesus starts to make
[1:17:29] a move and it would seem as if he's
[1:17:30] getting away from the Pharisees can the
[1:17:33] church say amen amen so the Bible said
[1:17:35] he
[1:17:37] departs to
[1:17:39] Galilee and I want to just kind of
[1:17:41] honing on these scriptures here verse
[1:17:43] four and he must needs go through
[1:17:47] Samaria now when you read that one verse
[1:17:51] it kind of if you don't already
[1:17:53] understand what happening here you could
[1:17:54] just see
[1:17:55] this scripture as just okay going
[1:17:57] through Samaria but I want us to focus a
[1:17:59] little bit on this thing one in all of
[1:18:02] spiritual history and scriptural
[1:18:04] documentation Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:18:07] Jesus only went to Samaria
[1:18:10] twice so it was not as if it's a normal
[1:18:13] Journey for Jesus it's only twice he
[1:18:16] went the first time he went which was
[1:18:18] actually before this captured in another
[1:18:19] book was when he passed through Samaria
[1:18:21] on the way to Jerusalem and they wanted
[1:18:23] to get rid of him and they say can we
[1:18:27] call for fire and burn them up anybody
[1:18:29] remember that and Jesus say you don't
[1:18:31] even know what Spirit you of just go
[1:18:33] your way just keep
[1:18:36] walking but the Clarance at this day and
[1:18:38] time no Jew goes to
[1:18:41] Samaria if you wanted to go from Judea
[1:18:46] to Galilee you avoided
[1:18:49] Samaria Samaria was a no-o zone no true
[1:18:54] Jew Blackman would would decide to go
[1:18:57] through Samaria so there's a secret
[1:18:59] hidden inside of this thing because at
[1:19:01] that day there there was
[1:19:04] animosity between the Jews and the
[1:19:06] Samaritans amen am amen amen anybody
[1:19:10] with me so when Jesus decides to go
[1:19:13] through Samaria and the Bible said and
[1:19:15] he cometh he to a city of Samaria which
[1:19:18] is called SAA near to the pastel of
[1:19:20] ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph
[1:19:24] now Jacob Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:19:27] therefore being wared with his journey
[1:19:29] sat thus on the well and it was about
[1:19:30] the 6
[1:19:33] hour Jesus would would have been one of
[1:19:35] the few Jews brother Anthony who would
[1:19:37] have gone into Samaria for a very long
[1:19:40] time I want us to settle on this for a
[1:19:42] little bit so Jesus is going against
[1:19:44] Jewish
[1:19:46] tradition to even enter Samaria forget
[1:19:49] what he about to do just the entrance
[1:19:51] into that place alone is breaking the
[1:19:54] pattern of
[1:19:55] day Samaria a place rich in history a
[1:19:59] place that was known for its battles for
[1:20:02] its covenants for its Wars for the
[1:20:05] history that was written and Rewritten
[1:20:07] Samaria is critical in the economy of
[1:20:09] God and for centuries Jews said I'm not
[1:20:13] go if the service in Samaria I'm not
[1:20:16] going and it's not just that the Jews
[1:20:18] felt that way the Samaritans also felt
[1:20:20] that way we don't want any Jews here
[1:20:25] anybody with me this morning so I just
[1:20:28] want to bring a little history so we
[1:20:29] understand the context because it's
[1:20:31] important when we get to the
[1:20:32] conversation with the woman at the
[1:20:35] well you could ask the question how did
[1:20:37] Samaria even become significant a little
[1:20:41] bit of History it was in Samaria at
[1:20:43] sheim in Samaria that Abraham was given
[1:20:46] the Covenant and Abraham in Genesis 12
[1:20:50] passed through the land onto the place
[1:20:51] sheam onto the plane of
[1:20:53] morah and and the Lord appeared unto
[1:20:55] Abraham and said unto thy seed will I
[1:20:58] give this
[1:20:59] land this was a land of promise and Jews
[1:21:02] were not welcome in this land anybody
[1:21:05] with me this morning it was in this land
[1:21:07] that Abraham would have walked and would
[1:21:09] have meditated and talk to God in this
[1:21:11] land Jacob settled in this land can the
[1:21:15] church say Amen not only did Jacob
[1:21:17] settle here and live here but Jacob
[1:21:19] built a well in this land this land of
[1:21:22] Samaria Jacob had spent time and built a
[1:21:24] well and he and the Bible said he gave a
[1:21:27] piece of his land to his son Joseph
[1:21:29] that's rich history that's gathered in
[1:21:31] this land of Samaria by n sheim anybody
[1:21:35] with me this morning it'll get important
[1:21:37] in a
[1:21:40] minute it was in this same place the
[1:21:43] Bible said in Joshua 24 and Joshua
[1:21:46] gathered all the tribes of Israel to
[1:21:49] sheam and it was in this same place he
[1:21:52] said choose you this day
[1:21:55] whom you will serve and the Covenant
[1:21:57] between God and the children of Israel
[1:21:59] was reestablished right
[1:22:02] there and in this place for centuries
[1:22:04] but the Thompson a Jew was not welcome
[1:22:07] to this place can the church say amen
[1:22:11] and Friends it was not always this
[1:22:14] way it was on Mount jerim which is in
[1:22:17] the epicenter almost of
[1:22:19] Samaria near to Jacob's Well that Moses
[1:22:23] in Deuteronomy said let the blessings be
[1:22:25] pronounced from Mount
[1:22:29] jerim it was on Mount jerim in Samaria
[1:22:32] by sheam by the the The Well of Jacob
[1:22:36] that the Samaritans build their own
[1:22:39] Temple huj and say this is where we will
[1:22:41] worship Hallelujah why will we worship
[1:22:44] here because God spoke to Abraham here
[1:22:47] and Joshua reestablish the Covenant here
[1:22:50] they had Rich history there can the
[1:22:51] Church Say Amen
[1:22:54] amen we're going to get to something in
[1:22:56] a
[1:22:58] minute but why is it that Jews were not
[1:23:01] welcome in
[1:23:02] Samaria well for two
[1:23:04] reasons I touch this a few times in
[1:23:06] different messages we know that under
[1:23:09] David the Kingdom of Israel was all
[1:23:12] United was one under Solomon they were
[1:23:15] all one but after Solomon died because
[1:23:19] of Solomon's
[1:23:21] idolatry which brother Branham traced
[1:23:24] all the way back to balam and to Moab
[1:23:28] because B Bram said the seed of idolatry
[1:23:31] was sown there so bam tied the
[1:23:34] Samaritans all the way back to balam and
[1:23:39] to the king of Moab I'll read the quote
[1:23:41] for you everybody with me but let's
[1:23:43] build here so the children of Israel
[1:23:45] they are one people and under the rule
[1:23:47] of David they are one under the rule of
[1:23:49] Solomon they are one and when Solomon
[1:23:51] dies there's a split political iCal
[1:23:54] discontent spiritual Decline and God
[1:23:58] turned away from Solomon his son is
[1:24:02] King and his son imposes taxes we
[1:24:05] preached this before and because of the
[1:24:07] tax 10 tribes decide to say we are
[1:24:09] breaking away amen and they formed the
[1:24:13] northern kingdom so to the north is 10
[1:24:15] tribes and to the South is the kingdom
[1:24:17] of Judah with the tribe of Judah The
[1:24:19] Tribe of Benjamin and all other 10
[1:24:21] tribes are in the north but the brandham
[1:24:23] said the seed of idolatry which was sown
[1:24:25] by Moab and balam was carried through
[1:24:27] into the northern kingdom can the church
[1:24:29] say Amen so they have you have the kings
[1:24:33] of Judah and the Kings of Israel and
[1:24:35] most time in scripture the king of Judah
[1:24:37] the king of Israel the prophet of Israel
[1:24:38] the prophet of Judah back and forth
[1:24:40] throughout spiritual history can the
[1:24:42] church say amen amen but over time and
[1:24:46] if you read it Israel always had the
[1:24:48] worst lot of Kings Israel was known for
[1:24:51] being much worse than Judah Judah had
[1:24:53] their own isue
[1:24:55] but God reached a point where he was fed
[1:24:57] up of what was happening in the northern
[1:25:00] kingdom and if you go down to 2 Kings
[1:25:07] 17 everybody with me yes sir 2 Kings
[1:25:12] 17 in the 12th year of ahaz king of
[1:25:16] Judah began HOSA the son of elah to
[1:25:20] reign in Samaria over Israel so the
[1:25:23] capital of of Israel is Samaria and King
[1:25:26] HOSA is the last king of
[1:25:30] Israel the last king of Israel King hos
[1:25:33] became king because he assassinated the
[1:25:35] last king Israel was in is a lot of
[1:25:37] trouble and during his period here verse
[1:25:40] two and he did with that which was evil
[1:25:42] in the sight of the Lord but not as the
[1:25:44] Kings of Israel that were before him
[1:25:47] against him came up shal manzar King of
[1:25:49] Assyria and HOSA became his
[1:25:52] servant and gave him presence and the
[1:25:55] king of Assyria found conspiracy in HOSA
[1:25:58] for he had sent Messengers to so the
[1:26:01] king of Egypt and brought no present to
[1:26:04] the king of Assyria as he had done year
[1:26:06] by year therefore the king of Assyria
[1:26:08] shut him up and bound him in prison so I
[1:26:11] want you to see what's happening here
[1:26:12] this is we are watching here the end of
[1:26:14] the Kingdom of Israel after this Israel
[1:26:17] as a kingdom the northern kingdom ceases
[1:26:20] to exist you know what it is to be the
[1:26:22] leader of the collapse of of the Kingdom
[1:26:25] this is King
[1:26:28] HOSA after this Israel as a as a kingdom
[1:26:31] the northern kingdom doesn't exist
[1:26:32] anymore only Judah would have existed
[1:26:34] for about 10 something years afterwards
[1:26:35] before the Babylonians would have taken
[1:26:37] him up but this was by no accident I
[1:26:40] want to to see the unfolding of this for
[1:26:41] a few
[1:26:43] minutes then the king of Assyria verse 5
[1:26:45] came up throughout all the land and went
[1:26:47] up to Samaria and besiege it three years
[1:26:51] and in the ninth year of HOSA the king
[1:26:52] of Assyria took Samaria and carried
[1:26:55] Israel away deported them away into
[1:26:59] Assyria and placed them in Hala and in
[1:27:02] Habor by the river of gozan and in the
[1:27:04] cities of the mes and so it was that the
[1:27:07] children of Israel had sinned against
[1:27:09] the Lord their God which had brought
[1:27:11] them up out of the land of Egypt from
[1:27:14] under the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt
[1:27:15] and had feared other gods and walked in
[1:27:18] the statutes of the Heathen whom the
[1:27:20] Lord cast out from before the children
[1:27:22] of Israel and of the king of Israel
[1:27:24] which they had made and the children of
[1:27:26] Israel did secretly those things that
[1:27:28] were not right against the Lord their
[1:27:30] God and they built them high places in
[1:27:33] all their cities from the Tower of the
[1:27:35] Watchmen to the fence City and they set
[1:27:38] them up images and Groves in every high
[1:27:40] hill and under every Green
[1:27:42] Tree and there they burnt incense in all
[1:27:46] the high places as did the Heathen whom
[1:27:48] the Lord carried away before them and
[1:27:50] wrought wicked things to provoke the
[1:27:52] Lord to anger for they ser Idols whereof
[1:27:55] the Lord had said unto them ye shall not
[1:27:56] do this thing amen yet the Lord
[1:27:59] testified against Israel and against
[1:28:01] Judah by all the prophets and by all the
[1:28:03] sear saying Turn ye from your evil ways
[1:28:05] and keep my Commandments and my statutes
[1:28:07] according to all the law which I
[1:28:09] commanded your fathers and which I sent
[1:28:11] to you by my Servants of prophets not
[1:28:14] withstanding they would not hear but
[1:28:16] Harden their necks like to the necks of
[1:28:19] their fathers that did not believe in
[1:28:21] the Lord their God and they rejected his
[1:28:23] statutes and his Covenant that he made
[1:28:25] with their fathers and his testimonies
[1:28:27] which he testified against them and they
[1:28:29] followed vanity and became Vain and went
[1:28:32] after the Heathen and were round about
[1:28:33] them concerning whom the Lord had
[1:28:35] charged them that they should not do
[1:28:37] like them and they left all the
[1:28:39] Commandments of the Lord their God and
[1:28:41] made them molten images even two calves
[1:28:45] and made a Grove and worship all the
[1:28:46] hosts of heaven and serve Bal and they
[1:28:49] caused their sons and their daughters to
[1:28:51] pass through the fire and use divination
[1:28:54] and enchantments and sold themselves to
[1:28:57] do evil in the sight of the Lord to
[1:28:58] provoke him to anger therefore the Lord
[1:29:01] was very angry with Israel and removed
[1:29:04] them out of his sight amen there was
[1:29:06] none left but the tribe of Judah
[1:29:08] only also Judah kept not the
[1:29:11] Commandments of the Lord their God but
[1:29:13] walked in the statutes of Israel which
[1:29:14] they made and the Lord rejected all the
[1:29:17] seed of Israel and Afflicted them and
[1:29:20] delivered them into the hands of
[1:29:21] spoilers until he cast them out of his
[1:29:23] sight yes for he rent Israel from the
[1:29:26] House of David and they made Jobo the
[1:29:28] son of nebat King and Jobo drove Israel
[1:29:31] from following the Lord and made them
[1:29:33] sin a great sin so you see all I'm not
[1:29:35] going to read but all of this is
[1:29:37] Judgment coming upon them because of the
[1:29:39] idolatry and the worship can we go on so
[1:29:43] there's the kingdom in the north the
[1:29:45] kingdom in the South and because of
[1:29:47] God's being God being fed up of them he
[1:29:49] sent judgment in the form of the
[1:29:50] Assyrian army
[1:29:54] send the people all through the Assyrian
[1:29:56] Empire so what is left in Samaria is a
[1:29:59] small remnant of Israel that has not
[1:30:01] been deported and foreigners who have
[1:30:03] been brought in and this group of people
[1:30:07] who is now a mixture of foreigners and
[1:30:09] the remnant of Israel mixed together and
[1:30:12] they form the
[1:30:15] Samaritans it goes on because the
[1:30:17] Samaritans now are a mixed group of
[1:30:19] people they're mixed in culture they're
[1:30:22] mixed in race they're also mixed in
[1:30:23] religion because but AB Bram said and
[1:30:25] the Bible said that they worship God but
[1:30:27] they had little Idol practice kind of
[1:30:29] here and there there some Little Sim
[1:30:31] here but it's still acknowledging God is
[1:30:32] God and because they're in the north and
[1:30:35] because Samaria is there they can still
[1:30:37] say but Abraham was here and Jacob was
[1:30:40] here and we have to worship here so they
[1:30:42] have enough of spiritual history to
[1:30:45] stand up and say but we are the True
[1:30:46] Believers you
[1:30:47] know can the church say Amen so by the
[1:30:51] time Jesus is on the earth you know what
[1:30:53] is the number one spiritual debate
[1:30:56] between the Jews and the
[1:30:57] Samaritans the number one debate is
[1:31:00] where we supposed to
[1:31:03] worship because the Jews would tell you
[1:31:05] worship is supposed to be in Jerusalem
[1:31:07] but any Samaritan would say worship is
[1:31:10] supposed to be in Samaria on Mount
[1:31:13] jerusalm because that where God spoke to
[1:31:15] Abraham that's where Joshua reaffirmed
[1:31:17] the Covenant and they could go through
[1:31:18] all of spiritual history to show why it
[1:31:20] should be in that
[1:31:22] place and because because of the war of
[1:31:25] where should we worship that created a
[1:31:27] big divide when they were trying to
[1:31:30] rebuild the Temple the Samaritans came
[1:31:33] and said can we help and the Jews said
[1:31:35] we don't want your help because you're
[1:31:36] not pure enough that further created a
[1:31:39] wedge between the Jews and the
[1:31:41] Samaritans so it is against this hostile
[1:31:44] territory Jesus finds himself walking
[1:31:48] into Samaria one day nobody in Samaria
[1:31:51] wants to see a Jew nobody in Samar wants
[1:31:54] to hear truth those that are in Samaria
[1:31:56] believe that they are worshiping what
[1:31:58] they're supposed to worship and worship
[1:32:00] supposed to be on Mount jerusem and here
[1:32:02] comes the Messiah the book of redemption
[1:32:04] Redemption
[1:32:06] himself and and listen because of the
[1:32:09] way the Jews watched Samaritans no Jew
[1:32:12] would have ever gone to testify in
[1:32:14] Samaria no Jew would go and preach in
[1:32:16] Samaria so the people who were in
[1:32:18] Samaria who had to hear the gospel they
[1:32:20] could have never heard it from a normal
[1:32:22] Jew but this Jew who was walking into
[1:32:24] Samaria was not a normal Jew he didn't
[1:32:27] care about tradition he didn't care
[1:32:29] about the history of where they started
[1:32:32] and where the church started and who was
[1:32:34] here and who was there all of that
[1:32:36] didn't matter to him because he was just
[1:32:38] interested in one thing
[1:32:40] Redemption he not interested in location
[1:32:43] he not interested in who did what where
[1:32:45] he wants to redeem every name on the
[1:32:47] book somebody preach back to
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:52] me we going to get somewhere in a minute
[1:32:55] trying to take my time
[1:32:57] here so I want you to see the drama when
[1:33:00] Jesus say he have needs pass through
[1:33:02] Samaria it's been centuries before a
[1:33:04] Jewish preacher pass through
[1:33:06] Samaria Hallelujah Jewish preachers
[1:33:10] didn't decide to go and evangelize in
[1:33:12] Samaria because the Samaran the
[1:33:14] Samaritans were firmly of the belief
[1:33:16] that they don't need to hear what the
[1:33:18] Jews had to
[1:33:20] say can the church say amen amen
[1:33:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:27] hallelujah but we know that Jesus going
[1:33:29] into Samaria was with a purpose he
[1:33:32] wasn't just feeling to go to Samaria he
[1:33:34] could have gone the way any other Jew
[1:33:36] would have gone and take the road take
[1:33:38] the taxi take the donkey take the
[1:33:39] journey take the walk but he said tell
[1:33:41] said he needs part to Samaria the
[1:33:43] disciples didn't even know why he was
[1:33:45] going but there was something in him
[1:33:47] that compelled him to go into hostile
[1:33:50] territory in an uncomfortable place
[1:33:53] where people will say why why is that
[1:33:55] Jew here or is see the
[1:33:57] Jew you may be SE
[1:33:59] itall I want you to see the picture of
[1:34:01] it because the picture is important for
[1:34:04] centuries no Jew had gone to The Well of
[1:34:08] Jacob and here it is a Jew like no other
[1:34:11] Jew he's walking on the footprints
[1:34:14] placing adding footprints in the sons of
[1:34:16] time where Abraham would have walked and
[1:34:19] where Jacob would have walked and where
[1:34:22] Elijah would have walked because Elijah
[1:34:24] was the prophet to Samaria where Elisha
[1:34:26] would have walked he looked and see
[1:34:28] where Ahab would have walked because
[1:34:30] this was have been the headquarters of
[1:34:32] the northern kingdom he see where king
[1:34:34] juu would have rode through here come on
[1:34:36] somebody preach back to me when Elijah
[1:34:38] was on his way to mount carel he would
[1:34:40] have had to walk next to the next to The
[1:34:42] Well of Jacob if Jacob's Well had a
[1:34:45] voice Jacob's Well could speak of seeing
[1:34:47] Jacob coming and dipping from this well
[1:34:50] if Jacob's Well had a voice it could
[1:34:52] speak of Cena wey Elijah coming to get a
[1:34:56] cup this wasn't any well this was
[1:34:59] Jacob's
[1:35:01] well
[1:35:04] Hallelujah Jacob's Well had served but a
[1:35:07] c many a tired wary stranger but on this
[1:35:11] day in the heat of the sun with the wind
[1:35:14] blowing ever so quietly here comes the
[1:35:17] master and he's walking to Jacob's well
[1:35:20] he's taking his time because he's tired
[1:35:22] he's taking his time because he's weary
[1:35:24] he's he's so tired he sits down on
[1:35:27] Jacob's Well if Jacob's Well had a voice
[1:35:30] it would say who is this that's sitting
[1:35:32] on top this
[1:35:35] well because For the First Time a well
[1:35:38] met a well oh you don't hear me this
[1:35:40] morning for the first time Jacob's Well
[1:35:43] a deep well met a well that was deeper
[1:35:45] than he was oh you don't hear me this
[1:35:47] morning come to church see amen
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:01] anybody with me this
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:04] morning I hope I'm not losing anybody
[1:36:06] you know all right we see the picture
[1:36:09] now right so Jesus is sitting there and
[1:36:13] the Bible said he is
[1:36:16] waiting he's
[1:36:17] waiting he's waiting I can imagine
[1:36:22] people looking from the Shadows asking
[1:36:25] why is there a Jew
[1:36:27] sitting on Jacob's Well by what
[1:36:31] Authority is this Jew sitting downall on
[1:36:35] Jacob's well this is our well this is
[1:36:38] this is Samaritan well by what Authority
[1:36:41] where do Jew come from there's something
[1:36:43] about him there's a confidence he
[1:36:45] looking tired but there's a confidence
[1:36:47] that we cannot explain he looks like he
[1:36:49] belongs here nobody there challenges Jew
[1:36:53] even though hostile territory everybody
[1:36:55] keeps their distance because there's
[1:36:57] something about this man who is sitting
[1:36:59] on Jacob's Well somebody preach back to
[1:37:02] me this morning is there any this body
[1:37:04] this morning wants to go and visit
[1:37:05] Jacob's
[1:37:07] Well that well represented
[1:37:09] transformation you know that well was
[1:37:12] named after a man that got changed that
[1:37:15] spot marked a spot of Deliverance it had
[1:37:17] a historical be but at that point it was
[1:37:20] also past and future present mixed
[1:37:22] together at Jacob's
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:40] Well just to highlight friends how bad
[1:37:44] the beef
[1:37:46] was between the Jews and the Samaritans
[1:37:50] in John 8
[1:37:54] in John
[1:37:55] 8 the Bible
[1:38:00] says this is Jesus said unto them in
[1:38:02] verse 42 if God were your father you
[1:38:04] would love me for I proceeded forth and
[1:38:06] came from God neither came I of myself
[1:38:08] but he sent me why do you not understand
[1:38:11] my speech even because you cannot hear
[1:38:15] my word year of your father the devil
[1:38:17] and the lust of your father you will do
[1:38:19] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:38:21] not in the truth because there's no
[1:38:23] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:38:25] speak it of his own for he's a liar and
[1:38:27] the father of it and because I tell you
[1:38:29] the truth you believe me not which of
[1:38:31] you convinced me of sin and if I say the
[1:38:34] truth why do you not believe me he that
[1:38:37] is of God heareth God's words ye
[1:38:39] therefore hear them not because you are
[1:38:40] not of God listen to the response of the
[1:38:43] Jews in verse 48 then answered the Jews
[1:38:46] and said unto him say we not well th a
[1:38:48] Samaritan and H a devil yes yes
[1:38:52] yes yes so they were accusing Jesus of
[1:38:55] being a Samaritan or being demon
[1:38:57] possessed so you can make a equal sign
[1:39:00] there they they trying to figure where
[1:39:01] is the worst
[1:39:02] insult he either say you have a devil or
[1:39:05] you're a
[1:39:05] Samaritan and it's in the midst of
[1:39:07] Samaria Jesus finds himself in an
[1:39:10] unlikely
[1:39:12] place on an unlikely day at an unlikely
[1:39:16] time in the middle of the day when his
[1:39:18] son is at the hottest point and he's
[1:39:21] tired and he's thirsty and he's weary
[1:39:22] and he's hungry but he's not
[1:39:25] moving because he's waiting for
[1:39:29] somebody he is waiting for somebody and
[1:39:32] his tiredness his thirst his concern
[1:39:35] about where he is doesn't matter because
[1:39:37] who he's coming to see is more important
[1:39:39] than his thirst who he is coming to see
[1:39:41] is more important than his hunger who he
[1:39:44] is about to see is more important than
[1:39:46] his
[1:39:49] discomfort can the church say Amen could
[1:39:51] you take some more just encourage you a
[1:39:54] little bit this
[1:39:56] morning now you'll see in a short while
[1:39:59] I am preaching about the woman and the
[1:40:00] world but I'm not reaching preaching
[1:40:01] with her you know I'm really trying to
[1:40:03] get to
[1:40:05] you that's why my subject is an unlikely
[1:40:09] bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles
[1:40:11] because salvation is of the Jews God had
[1:40:14] to make a decision to get to the
[1:40:15] Gentiles but before he get to the
[1:40:17] Gentiles I want you to understand that
[1:40:19] Jesus walking into Samaria was the first
[1:40:21] non-jew encounter he had
[1:40:25] every experience that Jesus had on the
[1:40:27] earth at that point was with Jews when
[1:40:30] he entered Samar is the first time he
[1:40:32] speaking to anybody meeting anybody
[1:40:35] dealing with anybody who is not a Jew
[1:40:37] but we read in Isaiah that his ministry
[1:40:40] is to the ends of the Earth so Jesus his
[1:40:43] great Plan of Redemption was not just to
[1:40:45] Jews only it was to Jews it was to
[1:40:48] Samaritans and it was to the Gentiles
[1:40:51] but the P said there are only three es
[1:40:53] on the earth they only Jews they're only
[1:40:56] Samaritans and they're only Gentiles and
[1:40:58] before the Assyrian
[1:41:00] Invasion there were only Jews and
[1:41:02] Gentiles God allowed the Samaritans to
[1:41:05] be born because the Samaritan is a
[1:41:07] hybrid half Jew half gentille Jesus
[1:41:10] never went to the Gentiles his ministry
[1:41:12] was not to the Gentiles when he was in
[1:41:14] the flesh but while he was on the Earth
[1:41:16] but AB Bram said he was introducing
[1:41:17] himself to the Jews he was introducing
[1:41:19] himself to the
[1:41:21] Samaritans and but AB Bram said if he
[1:41:23] introduced himself to the Jews a certain
[1:41:25] way and he introduced himself to the
[1:41:26] Samaritan a certain way he has to
[1:41:28] introduce himself to the Gentiles the
[1:41:30] same
[1:41:33] way so the woman at the well was not
[1:41:35] just a sister who needed help she was
[1:41:38] unlocking a precedent of the Gospel
[1:41:40] going beyond the Jews that had never
[1:41:43] happened before if she didn't get the
[1:41:45] gospel the Gentiles couldn't get the
[1:41:50] gospel you don't hear me I'm going to
[1:41:53] prove it in scripture in a
[1:41:56] minute so that woman in well brother
[1:41:59] Andrew was more than her situation it
[1:42:02] was more than her people if the
[1:42:04] Samaritan because listen you remember
[1:42:06] when God tell Peter to go to Cornelius
[1:42:08] and stuff he had to show Peter a vision
[1:42:11] once twice Peter said no he said how you
[1:42:14] can be clean with the unclean or because
[1:42:16] Peter wasn't ready to accept that the
[1:42:18] Gentiles could get his
[1:42:21] thing anybody with me
[1:42:23] so God in his divine plan had to find a
[1:42:26] way to create you know in court in court
[1:42:28] of law there's
[1:42:30] precedent so God between the first
[1:42:33] miracle and the second Miracle this is
[1:42:35] not the middle of Jesus ministry this is
[1:42:37] the beginning the early stage of the
[1:42:38] ministry he does a diversion in the
[1:42:41] Samaria to set a precedent in law that
[1:42:44] could allow a non-jew to accept this
[1:42:47] thing because he know his end game is to
[1:42:49] get the Gentiles but if he don't stop
[1:42:51] this way and find the Samaritans unlock
[1:42:54] Grace to them unlock Mercy to them
[1:42:56] unlock Redemption to them nobody could
[1:42:58] unlock the Gentiles anybody with me this
[1:43:00] morning and I'm going to find it in
[1:43:04] scripture anybody with me this morning
[1:43:06] God loves to find unlikely people in
[1:43:09] unlikely
[1:43:17] places Jesus said salvation is of the
[1:43:20] Jews you know but here he is unlocking
[1:43:22] this in order for the Gentiles to get a
[1:43:25] piece of this thing you remember
[1:43:30] Rahab against all ODS this one woman in
[1:43:33] Jericho a gentile woman at that somehow
[1:43:36] some come up on her heart because she's
[1:43:38] in the book of redemption she's not a
[1:43:39] Jew she not under any Covenant but
[1:43:41] somehow her name written there somehow
[1:43:43] she a representation somehow she rep
[1:43:46] Nobody Knows It But but God knows it so
[1:43:48] when the spies go there something in her
[1:43:50] wakes up she had been looking for this
[1:43:52] moment entire life and it wed it woke up
[1:43:55] when she saw them she knew that was her
[1:43:57] people she had grown up in Jericho but
[1:43:59] this was her
[1:44:04] people and that woman married General
[1:44:08] salmon and OB J see David all the way
[1:44:11] down in David was some prostitute blood
[1:44:13] in in David was some Gentile blood in
[1:44:16] know in David was some general blood you
[1:44:19] know and God allow all that mix of blood
[1:44:23] to set a presedent that you who have no
[1:44:26] chsh blood could be able to receive this
[1:44:28] or you don't hear me this morning reab
[1:44:31] was an unlikely Bridge from the Jews to
[1:44:34] the
[1:44:35] Gentiles and that woman had the well she
[1:44:38] was also an unlikely Bridge from the
[1:44:41] Jews to the Gentiles because if Jesus
[1:44:43] didn't come to her nobody was coming to
[1:44:45] her she would have been coming to that
[1:44:47] well every day but this day was
[1:44:50] different this day was different this
[1:44:53] service was different that morning she
[1:44:55] got up she got her water pot ready you
[1:44:58] may be seen
[1:45:04] it that morning but the punch she got to
[1:45:06] me she got her water pot ready as she
[1:45:08] normally would maybe she's looking out
[1:45:10] the window to see what time it is to see
[1:45:13] if the regular ladies had already gone
[1:45:16] because but Bram said she couldn't go
[1:45:18] when the regular ladies were going she
[1:45:20] had a reputation she had her guilt she
[1:45:23] had her shame she had her condemnation
[1:45:25] brother Brom said they would look at her
[1:45:27] they would talk about her so she had to
[1:45:29] wait at the the hottest
[1:45:31] moment when the course was clear after
[1:45:34] all the good people will finish getting
[1:45:36] their water
[1:45:40] Hallelujah friends she was an outcast
[1:45:43] not from the Jews in know she was an
[1:45:46] outcast among her own people the same
[1:45:49] Samaritans who had their little twisted
[1:45:51] up Doctrine they were rejecting her so
[1:45:55] it was an outcast people and she was an
[1:45:57] outcast among Outcast people who would
[1:46:00] bring Salvation to that woman oh come on
[1:46:02] somebody help me this
[1:46:04] morning and there are some Gentiles and
[1:46:07] there are some Outcast among the
[1:46:08] Gentiles who will bring Salvation to
[1:46:11] those
[1:46:14] [Music]
[1:46:16] people anybody with me this
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:20] morning I'm trying to take my time
[1:46:23] Gideon don't
[1:46:24] worry she got up that morning her water
[1:46:27] pot she's ready to go amen amen she's
[1:46:30] thirsty she has a a mix of thirst
[1:46:34] there's a natural thirst for water
[1:46:36] that's what people know about they could
[1:46:38] see it because that's the only reason

[1:52:12] [Music]
[1:52:27] she is walking into the

[1:52:36] silence she just walks and maybe she

[1:53:10] out just get my little T of water and go
[1:53:12] back home
[1:53:14] hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus
[1:53:19] interrupted whatever she was thinking
[1:53:22] because she didn't offer Jesus water
[1:53:25] Hallelujah she didn't ask him what you
[1:53:27] doing here she didn't say why you're
[1:53:29] here she was about to go about her own
[1:53:33] business but when Jesus looked at her
[1:53:36] Hallelujah he saw something in her that
[1:53:38] she couldn't see
[1:53:41] herself and but said Jesus was trying to
[1:53:43] contact her spirit he wanted to go
[1:53:46] beyond the flesh beyond what other
[1:53:47] people were seeing to contact a soul
[1:53:50] anybody with me and he broke broke the
[1:53:53] Silence of the
[1:53:54] day by saying give me to
[1:53:57] drink and that one phrase broke in
[1:54:01] Ephesians they talk about the middle
[1:54:02] wall of
[1:54:04] partition in that one statement Jesus
[1:54:07] broke tradition he broke culture he
[1:54:10] broke the racial divide he broke the
[1:54:13] religious divide because Jews don't talk
[1:54:15] to Samaritans men don't just approach
[1:54:18] women and nobody has speak to outcast
[1:54:25] and in that one statement he broke the
[1:54:29] walls between him and
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:35] her verse seven there cometh a woman and
[1:54:38] in St John 4 of Samar to draw water
[1:54:41] Jesus sath unto her give me to
[1:54:43] drink for his disciples were gone away
[1:54:46] until the seated to buy meat they were
[1:54:48] hungry Jesus thirsty Jesus tired he's
[1:54:50] sitting up he not standing up
[1:54:53] here we see the humanity of the Lord
[1:54:55] sitting down as it were almost
[1:54:57] vulnerable weak tired thirsty say give
[1:55:00] me to
[1:55:01] drink then said the woman of Samaria
[1:55:03] unto him how is it that thou being a
[1:55:07] Jew ask it of me which am two things a
[1:55:11] woman meaning men in that day don't just
[1:55:13] approach women who you don't know and of
[1:55:15] Samaria meaning we don't
[1:55:19] talk we don't believe the same thing
[1:55:23] we not in the same church we don't have
[1:55:25] the same interpretation we do have the
[1:55:27] same understanding of the
[1:55:29] word for the Jews have no
[1:55:32] dealings with the
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:37] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto
[1:55:39] her if thou knewest the gift of God and
[1:55:42] who is it now now let me add something
[1:55:44] here in all of the Bible Matthew Mark
[1:55:47] Luke and John if you go and look brother
[1:55:51] uh bar
[1:55:52] at every conversation Brother Andy
[1:55:54] between Jesus and one onone with anybody
[1:55:56] in scripture this is the longest one
[1:56:00] onone conversation recorded in the Bible
[1:56:03] between Jesus and
[1:56:06] anybody so there has to be a
[1:56:07] significance with a punch to this
[1:56:10] particular conversation go read every
[1:56:12] conversent Jesus had this is the longest
[1:56:14] one Jesus take his time to talk to this
[1:56:18] woman Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:56:21] if knowest the gift of God and who it is
[1:56:25] that sayth to thee give me to drink thou
[1:56:27] wouldest have asked of him and he would
[1:56:30] have given thee Living Water
[1:56:33] Hallelujah and this woman brother Bram
[1:56:35] said she knew more than many of the
[1:56:37] preachers
[1:56:38] today don't look at nobody small in this
[1:56:41] place because that little woman that
[1:56:44] Samaritan woman that woman who was a
[1:56:45] woman of brother of ill
[1:56:48] Fame you know when said the secret is
[1:56:51] the word in the bride she had some word
[1:56:53] locked up in
[1:56:55] her in the midst of her struggles the
[1:56:58] word had found a resting place there was
[1:57:00] some good ground in her soul that when
[1:57:02] it have time to rely on the word she
[1:57:04] could Rock back on the word anybody with
[1:57:06] me this
[1:57:07] [Applause]
[1:57:11] morning verse 11 the woman said unto him
[1:57:14] now now this is some what what's an
[1:57:16] opportun of a conversation with
[1:57:19] Jesus Jesus bow the ball and she hold
[1:57:21] the back
[1:57:24] Hallelujah and say Sir thou Hast nothing
[1:57:27] to draw it and the well is
[1:57:30] deep from whence then hast thou that
[1:57:34] Living Water what come on what are you
[1:57:36] talking about on and she goes now into
[1:57:40] the word now a dog greater than our
[1:57:43] father
[1:57:44] Jacob so she knew her history there
[1:57:47] might be some idolatry mixed up there in
[1:57:49] the bloodline somewhere but she know
[1:57:51] Jacob is her father
[1:57:53] you say I thought greater than our
[1:57:55] father Jacob which gave us this
[1:57:58] well and drun thereof himself he himself
[1:58:01] drank here and his children and his
[1:58:03] cattle yes hallelujah amen so she she
[1:58:07] bed there so Jesus had to bowl again
[1:58:11] Jesus answer said unto her whosoever
[1:58:13] drinketh of this water that I talking
[1:58:16] about whoever drinketh of this water
[1:58:18] speaking about the water in the well
[1:58:20] rather shall thirst again
[1:58:23] but whosoever drinketh of the water I
[1:58:25] shall give him shall never
[1:58:30] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:58:33] him shall be in him there's a
[1:58:36] transference from the physical well to
[1:58:38] the well being on the inside now in him
[1:58:41] a well of water springing up into
[1:58:43] everlasting
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:50] life any with me this morning can we
[1:58:53] give the Lord a shout of
[1:58:59] Praise when Jesus said that the woman
[1:59:03] said n hold on hold on like you and know
[1:59:05] who you're talking to here today he said
[1:59:07] sir give me this
[1:59:09] water that I thirst not listen to her we
[1:59:13] got I thirst here but I thirst not
[1:59:16] neither come here to draw in other words
[1:59:17] if I get this thing I don't need to come
[1:59:19] back here again I don't have to walk
[1:59:21] back this way and know the woman
[1:59:23] watching me and they talking about me
[1:59:25] and they say look she again that's a
[1:59:27] real man look at she again that that
[1:59:30] woman is trouble give me this water that
[1:59:33] I don't have to pass by this way again
[1:59:36] and I don't have to thirst again can the
[1:59:37] church
[1:59:40] amen Jesus said unto
[1:59:43] her go this is when now he now he reach
[1:59:47] a spirit now and he know what he dealing
[1:59:50] with he know the problem he come to fix
[1:59:52] he know what her problem is he knows
[1:59:54] what her situation is and he said go
[1:59:56] call thy husband and come
[2:00:03] backl and the woman said unto him I have
[2:00:06] no
[2:00:11] husband she looking her wrong day making
[2:00:13] sure no nobody are
[2:00:16] heing because this is her deeply held
[2:00:19] secret this is the Crux of her issue
[2:00:22] this is the issue that been bothering
[2:00:23] her this is the issue that's stressing
[2:00:25] her
[2:00:29] out Hallelujah Jesus said unto her thou
[2:00:33] Hast well said I have no husband for
[2:00:36] thou Hast had five husbands and he whom
[2:00:39] thou Hast is not thy husband in that
[2:00:42] sest thou
[2:00:44] truly amen now when she heard that now
[2:00:47] you need to be spiritual friends she say
[2:00:50] I perceive that thou art a Prophet now I
[2:00:52] want to catch
[2:00:54] this this is the Pharisees and the
[2:00:57] Sadducees and all them fellas trying to
[2:00:58] figure out who is this man and and if
[2:01:00] doubting and this Samaritan woman
[2:01:03] outside of the most of the Miracles
[2:01:05] Jesus would do have not been done
[2:01:07] yet I want us to catch this most of what
[2:01:10] they would criticize has even happened
[2:01:12] yet but the moment he said this she
[2:01:13] catches a revelation one time about who
[2:01:16] is she speaking to I perceive that th
[2:01:18] are a Prophet come on and then she go
[2:01:20] deeper into the word now so now she
[2:01:23] jumped on the anointing of who she
[2:01:25] talking to she say this is a prophet let
[2:01:28] me let me drive this thing as far as I
[2:01:30] can go with it she said our fathers
[2:01:32] Worship in this mountain Mount Jerusalem
[2:01:35] Abraham was here Joshua was here Elijah
[2:01:37] was here our fathers were here and ye
[2:01:40] say in Jerusalem so she now calling out
[2:01:43] the
[2:01:44] Jew our fathers claim this mountain and
[2:01:48] ye say in Jerusalem is the place where
[2:01:50] men ought to worship she asking him a
[2:01:52] spiritual question our fathers have
[2:01:55] something tight among Jerusalem but you
[2:01:58] people say Jerusalem is where and are
[2:01:59] not coming in other words are not coming
[2:02:01] to
[2:02:02] Jerusalem because I believe my Doctrine
[2:02:05] is that worship is in
[2:02:06] jism on this mountain and you Jews want
[2:02:09] us to believe that worship has to be in
[2:02:12] Jerusalem listen to
[2:02:14] Jesus Jesus said un a woman believe me
[2:02:18] the hour cometh when he shall neither in
[2:02:21] this mountain of jism nor yet at
[2:02:24] Jerusalem worship the father Jesus at
[2:02:26] that moment busted location based
[2:02:28] worship he said the hour cometh when it
[2:02:32] wouldn't be whether you're in jerusem or
[2:02:33] Jerusalem it don't matter whether it's
[2:02:36] this church or that church don't
[2:02:38] matter you don't hear me this
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:45] morning the Lord himself stood there the
[2:02:49] book of redemption stood and busted
[2:02:51] location based
[2:02:54] worship anybody tell you you have to be
[2:02:56] here or you have to be here and listen
[2:02:58] you may be seated the history nice to
[2:03:00] know because I could give you a whole
[2:03:02] message on why I should Worship in
[2:03:04] Jerusalem and I could preach a whole
[2:03:06] message about why I should Worship in
[2:03:10] charism we can find scriptures to defend
[2:03:13] with the CL B places of
[2:03:15] worship and Jesus said the hour cometh
[2:03:18] when it wouldn't be here or there this
[2:03:21] church or that church this group or this
[2:03:24] group this country or this country in
[2:03:26] other words it don't matter where you
[2:03:28] Fellowship there's something more
[2:03:30] important than the church you go to
[2:03:32] there's something more important than
[2:03:34] the location of your worship or you
[2:03:37] don't hear me this
[2:03:44] morning
[2:03:46] Hallelujah are you getting it Church you
[2:03:49] may be seated so any preacher any group
[2:03:52] that say you had to be connected here or
[2:03:54] you have to go there even reads in John
[2:03:59] 4 because Jesus himself said the hour
[2:04:02] cometh when you shall need her on this
[2:04:04] mountain even though Abraham was here
[2:04:07] even though Joshua was here even though
[2:04:11] Jerusalem is the place for the prince of
[2:04:13] PE and all of that the hour
[2:04:16] coming when he shall neither in this
[2:04:18] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem in neither
[2:04:22] of these places you will worship the
[2:04:26] father he goes on you worship you know
[2:04:29] not what but we know what we worship for
[2:04:33] salvation is of the
[2:04:35] Jews but this is it now this is the one
[2:04:39] this at this point this the greatest
[2:04:41] introduction of teaching that Jesus does
[2:04:43] since he's on the earth because this is
[2:04:45] how he grafts in the Samaritans and the
[2:04:49] Gentiles so he busted the place of
[2:04:52] worship of the Samaritans he busted the
[2:04:54] place of worship of the Jews between
[2:04:56] he's ending the doctrinal war between
[2:04:58] the two
[2:05:01] groups but the brandham said both the
[2:05:03] Jews and the Samaritans were looking for
[2:05:05] the Messiah that's why she could have
[2:05:07] spoken that way and even though they
[2:05:10] were both looking for the Messiah their
[2:05:12] Doctrine was mixed
[2:05:14] up the Gentiles but the said had no
[2:05:17] chance because they were not even
[2:05:18] looking for the Messiah am amen amen but
[2:05:21] Jesus said list he said you worship you
[2:05:23] know not what we know what you worship
[2:05:25] for salvation of the Jews but the hour
[2:05:27] cometh come on now we going to tell them
[2:05:30] where to
[2:05:31] worship oh come on now I I have in my
[2:05:35] own service here this morning I don't
[2:05:37] know what service you have
[2:05:38] it because if it's not Jerusalem and
[2:05:41] it's not Jerm where should we worship he
[2:05:44] said the hour cometh and now is when the
[2:05:47] true worshippers because the father
[2:05:49] looking for some true worshippers shall
[2:05:51] worship the father in spirit and in
[2:05:55] truth in other words the place where he
[2:05:57] supposed to worship is where spirit and
[2:05:59] truth comes together word and spirit
[2:06:02] Dynamics and mechanics oh
[2:06:08] Hallelujah and that place is not a
[2:06:10] physical location that place is another
[2:06:13] dimension that place is another realm
[2:06:16] where word and spirit comes together
[2:06:18] spirit and Truth come together
[2:06:22] can the church Give the Lord a shout of
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:28] [Music]
[2:06:34] praise for the father seeketh such to
[2:06:36] worship Him and Jesus goes on this the
[2:06:39] longest conversation recorded in the
[2:06:41] Bible one and one between Jesus and
[2:06:45] anybody and he not talking to a priest
[2:06:49] he didn't take this to kyus
[2:06:51] he didn't take this to the Sanhedrin
[2:06:55] Council he didn't even share this with

[2:08:25] a serious back and forth there's a
[2:08:27] serious conversation here now he
[2:08:30] contrast this to these stupid
[2:08:31] conversations Jesus would have had to
[2:08:33] have suffered from these Pharisees and
[2:08:35] these people where they act accuse him
[2:08:37] is either you're a Samaritan or you're
[2:08:39] demon
[2:08:40] possessed after he do all these Miracles

[2:09:42] for such a time as this with Esther and
[2:09:45] boys s get our message two three times
[2:09:47] in the week leading up to the service
[2:09:51] P my daddy we I said to preach this
[2:09:54] famous I call him I call him back again
[2:09:57] and and I said to him this message came
[2:09:59] to me when he was preaching about two
[2:10:01] Sundays or so
[2:10:02] ago and he made a statement and when it
[2:10:05] get Quicken to me because all through

[2:10:09] man tell no man tell no man don't tell
[2:10:11] nobody don't tell nobody don't tell
[2:10:12] nobody and then it became too much after
[2:10:15] Lazarus rode from the dead the key
[2:10:18] couldn't shut them up no more that is
[2:10:20] what caused the virgins down into
[2:10:22] Jerusalem because the hosana cry was
[2:10:24] they say this thing is too much we can't
[2:10:26] keep quiet no
[2:10:28] more but check this Jesus public
[2:10:33] Declaration of who he
[2:10:35] was this is the first time in the Bible
[2:10:38] he actually says who he
[2:10:41] is Jesus said onto H verse 26 I that
[2:10:44] speak unto thee I'm
[2:10:47] he this is the first time Jesus ever
[2:10:50] said he is the
[2:10:52] Christ he came right out and said it to
[2:10:56] a woman of ill Fame in some
[2:11:00] Mar who no Minister was ever going to
[2:11:03] try to
[2:11:05] convert he came direct and say I that
[2:11:09] speak to you that Messiah you're looking
[2:11:11] for I am he listen his own disciple it
[2:11:14] was until Matthew 16 he said who do men
[2:11:17] say I am this is this is way after that
[2:11:20] you know
[2:11:22] bear in mind this conversation happening
[2:11:24] the disciples not there it's just him
[2:11:26] and the
[2:11:27] woman they going to find food they going
[2:11:30] down
[2:11:31] to they going to KFC they going to Royal
[2:11:34] Castle they going to find some
[2:11:38] meat and here it is this is Brother
[2:11:41] Stephen this is the only person on the
[2:11:43] earth who has heard the words direct
[2:11:45] from the Lord I am the
[2:11:49] Messiah before before this Brothers had
[2:11:52] speculation they say we believe he's
[2:11:53] he's the Christ you know go back and
[2:11:55] read early John with Philip and nataniel
[2:11:57] and them saying we have found him but
[2:11:59] Jesus never admitted he never he never
[2:12:02] approved it he never confirmed it but to
[2:12:04] this woman who was not a Jew in the
[2:12:07] middle of Samaria hostile territory a
[2:12:10] place where he broke his own oh come on
[2:12:12] he broke the rules of
[2:12:14] engagement because her name was in the
[2:12:16] book and the Samaritans had to be
[2:12:18] grafted in and the Gentiles had to
[2:12:20] follow that
[2:12:23] [Music]
[2:12:27] is after he declared
[2:12:30] that the Bible say in verse 27 and upon
[2:12:33] this after this statement come his
[2:12:36] disciples and marveled that he talked
[2:12:39] with the woman
[2:12:41] yes yet nobody everybody B in the greas
[2:12:45] yet no man said what seekest thou or why
[2:12:49] talkest thou with her they just watching
[2:12:52] you know you know when preach testimony
[2:12:53] on you see he said they were just
[2:12:55] fellowshipping saying remember when
[2:12:57] Jesus did this for them brothers day we
[2:12:59] had chicken here but what Jesus
[2:13:03] doing hallelujah what Jesus doing
[2:13:06] anyway you think we just start to eat
[2:13:07] her
[2:13:10] really nobody want to talk to him nobody
[2:13:12] asking him what he looking for and why
[2:13:13] you talking to her and villagers the
[2:13:16] sidelines I want you to see the
[2:13:18] unfolding of this picture and I love
[2:13:21] vers
[2:13:21] 28 you know but brandom say when the
[2:13:24] Revival break the woman can't even wash
[2:13:26] the
[2:13:27] dishes verse 20 and the woman then left
[2:13:30] her water
[2:13:33] pot but Lon she leave the water pot the
[2:13:37] reason she thought she came to the
[2:13:41] well but Mike he she came with a water
[2:13:44] pot and leave the water
[2:13:49] part she came to church for one reason
[2:13:53] and the reason she came to church for
[2:13:54] wasn't the reason she left with oh God
[2:13:56] tell somebody
[2:14:02] help for anybody watching her they had
[2:14:05] to know something happened because she
[2:14:07] left a well with no water
[2:14:09] pot they saw her going to the well with
[2:14:11] the water pot to get water and he the
[2:14:13] woman coming back moving brisk brisk no
[2:14:16] water pot before she said something they
[2:14:19] already know something happened
[2:14:21] and maybe when she left they thought the
[2:14:24] water but break or
[2:14:26] something but she want to say come see a
[2:14:28] [Applause]
[2:14:34] man the woman left her water verse 28
[2:14:37] and went her way into the City and said
[2:14:39] to the men come see a man which told me
[2:14:43] all things that I ever did listen to our
[2:14:46] words is not this the Christ the Jews
[2:14:49] were not talking so the Pharisees when
[2:14:51] talking so the sadu SE when not talking
[2:14:53] so here is a woman now who is
[2:14:56] transformed not only did she leave the
[2:14:59] physical water pot but with that water
[2:15:02] pot she left her guilt she left her
[2:15:04] shame she left her fear she left her
[2:15:07] desire to be alone she left a desire to
[2:15:09] not talk to anybody her desire to not
[2:15:11] Fellowship she ran to the men the men
[2:15:14] she didn't want to talk to she said come
[2:15:16] see a man come and see a man who told me
[2:15:20] all about you is this not the
[2:15:26] Christ come on somebody preach back to
[2:15:35] me she had to be extremely
[2:15:39] persuasive because the next verse of the
[2:15:41] Bible said then they went out of the
[2:15:43] city and came unto him amen amen so I
[2:15:48] preached this before you may be seated
[2:15:50] I'm feeling
[2:15:52] Goodall what time is it could you take
[2:15:55] some more because if I could go you
[2:15:57] could go if I could keep pushing then
[2:15:59] you have no
[2:16:00] excuse anybody feeling tired anybody
[2:16:03] feel like passing out
[2:16:07] anybody let's go
[2:16:11] so I preached it before Jesus when Jesus
[2:16:14] does something he has the amazing
[2:16:16] ability to do multiple things at the
[2:16:18] same
[2:16:19] time so when Jesus died on the cross
[2:16:23] simultaneously the failes ran from top
[2:16:25] to
[2:16:27] bottom simultaneously he could leave
[2:16:30] this physical body and go into the realm
[2:16:32] and take the keys of death and
[2:16:34] hell so it's only afterwards you could
[2:16:37] see all the things that are happening
[2:16:39] with that one event and the second order
[2:16:41] consequences of that one event Jesus
[2:16:44] didn't just come for that woman at the
[2:16:46] well he came for a group of Samaritans
[2:16:50] who would have been marginalized who
[2:16:52] would have been ostracized who would
[2:16:53] have not been allowed to come to a
[2:16:54] Jewish temple to ever hear Jesus preach
[2:16:57] or even be in Jerusalem or on the mount
[2:16:59] to hear The Sermon on the Mount they
[2:17:02] would not have been welcome to hear the
[2:17:04] sermon of the mount they would not have
[2:17:06] been welcome to be in anywhere Jesus
[2:17:08] went in bethl in Bethany in Galilee in
[2:17:10] capernium
[2:17:12] so when Jesus came to that woman it
[2:17:14] wasn't just her he was coming to he was
[2:17:16] coming just like Rahab to her
[2:17:19] family to her house to her
[2:17:23] people so when she said come see a man
[2:17:25] which told me all things that I ever did
[2:17:27] is not this to Christ then they went out
[2:17:30] of the city and came unto him verse 31
[2:17:33] in the meanwhile his disciples play
[2:17:36] prayed him or ple with them
[2:17:38] Master eat something
[2:17:42] now notice Jesus they getting no water
[2:17:44] yet
[2:17:53] rightall the woman came with a water to
[2:17:55] get water she gone without the water
[2:17:58] Jesus asked the water he get any water
[2:18:01] the disciples went to buy food to bring
[2:18:02] it back and they
[2:18:05] say eat something now and verse 32 he
[2:18:09] said unto them I have meat to eat that
[2:18:12] ye know not
[2:18:13] of he said what I do in here is so this
[2:18:16] thing like
[2:18:19] food he said I don't say e here right
[2:18:21] now because this is his character of
[2:18:24] love being expressed to a Samaritan
[2:18:27] woman and to her people it was more
[2:18:28] important to him not even
[2:18:30] eating verse 33 then said the disciples
[2:18:33] one another had any man brought him or
[2:18:36] to eat meaning somebody give him
[2:18:39] something because we know reach we know
[2:18:42] bring the food everybody looking for and
[2:18:44] like he looking like he not hungry
[2:18:45] anymore he clearly a tired anymore he a
[2:18:48] thirsty anymore maybe somebody give him
[2:18:49] some puffs somebody give some sweet
[2:18:51] bread somebody because we have the food
[2:18:53] here but look at look at
[2:18:55] Jesus verse 34 Jesus said unto them my
[2:18:59] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[2:19:02] me and to finish the work come on now
[2:19:06] somebody speak to me this whole thing is
[2:19:08] a spiritual thing you know the anointing
[2:19:10] is so Upon Jesus his appetite gone not
[2:19:14] because he tired of frustrated because
[2:19:15] there's a joy to see a soul come to
[2:19:18] Salvation a joy to see a people will
[2:19:20] come to
[2:19:21] [Applause]
[2:19:28] Redemption Hallelujah verse 35 say not
[2:19:32] ye they are yet four months and then
[2:19:34] cometh Harvest Hallelujah behold I say
[2:19:36] unto you lift up your eyes and look on
[2:19:38] the fields for they are white or already
[2:19:40] to harest in other words Jus saying time
[2:19:41] is short time is short there's work to
[2:19:44] be done more important than the natural
[2:19:46] things are coming on a mission you can't
[2:19:49] slow on the mission there's something
[2:19:50] somebody who needs me can the church say
[2:19:52] amen and he that reapeth receiveth wages
[2:19:55] and gathereth fruit unto life eternal
[2:19:58] that both he that SW it and he that reap
[2:20:00] it may Rejoice together and hearing is
[2:20:02] that saying true one SW it and one
[2:20:04] another reap it I send you to reap that
[2:20:06] whereon he bestowed no labor other men
[2:20:09] labor and he are entered into their
[2:20:11] labors can the church say amen amen wo
[2:20:15] Glory
[2:20:17] [Applause]
[2:20:21] let me try to kind of bring these things
[2:20:24] together you enjoy any word this
[2:20:27] morning and verse 39 and many of the
[2:20:30] Samaritans of that City believed on him
[2:20:34] so here's a converted group of
[2:20:37] Samaritans for the saying of the woman
[2:20:40] so her she was the first
[2:20:44] witness read scripture so she's the
[2:20:46] first
[2:20:49] witness for many many and many of the of
[2:20:52] that c believed on him for the sing
[2:20:53] woman which testified he told me all
[2:20:56] that I ever did verse 40 so when the
[2:20:58] Samaritans would come unto him they
[2:21:00] besought him that he would t with them
[2:21:02] and he Abode there two days so for two
[2:21:05] days Jesus is welcome in
[2:21:10] Samaria two days they fellowship with
[2:21:13] two days they get to ask questions two
[2:21:15] days he get to share things with them
[2:21:17] and verse 41 and many more believed
[2:21:19] because of his word
[2:21:22] and said unto the
[2:21:23] woman now we believe not because of thy
[2:21:27] saying for we have heard him
[2:21:30] ourselves and know that this is indeed
[2:21:34] the Christ the savior of the
[2:21:38] world this is before Matthew
[2:21:41] 16 this is before Jesus walk on water
[2:21:44] this is before last restation be
[2:21:48] dead Hallelujah
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:52] Glory
[2:21:55] Glory let me try to bring this to close
[2:21:58] everybody feeling fine so my mind is
[2:22:01] blown friends I just want to talk a
[2:22:02] little bit to see how
[2:22:04] Jesus Plan of Redemption God's love for
[2:22:08] a gentile people for a marginalized
[2:22:11] people for a people that would not have
[2:22:13] been welcomed into a temple in Jerusalem
[2:22:16] and here it is as brother Bram said
[2:22:17] Jesus didn't go to the Gentiles but he
[2:22:19] went to the Jews who were were expecting
[2:22:21] him he went to the Samaritans who were
[2:22:23] expecting him and I want to now pick up
[2:22:25] something very powerful in Matthew
[2:22:31] 10 to even show you something here and
[2:22:34] you'll see now why this is important and
[2:22:37] the unfolding of the ministry to the
[2:22:39] Gentiles Matthew 10
[2:22:51] and you'll see here now in Matthew 10 he
[2:22:53] said and when he had called unto him his
[2:22:55] 12
[2:22:56] disciples he gave them power but this is
[2:23:00] Matthew 10 verse1 against unclean
[2:23:02] spirits to cast them out and to heal all
[2:23:06] manner of sickness and all manner of
[2:23:08] disease now the names of the 12 apostles
[2:23:11] are these the first Simon who was called
[2:23:12] Peter and Andrew his brother James the
[2:23:15] son of Zebedee and John's brother Philip
[2:23:17] and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the
[2:23:19] Publican James son of alus and leus
[2:23:22] whose surname was thadius Simon the
[2:23:24] Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also
[2:23:26] betrayed him these 12 listen carefully
[2:23:29] Jesus sent forth and commanded them
[2:23:32] saying go listen carefully to the
[2:23:34] command he gives them go not into the
[2:23:37] way of the
[2:23:39] Gentiles and into any city of the
[2:23:42] Samaritans enter ye not amen but go
[2:23:45] rather to the lost sheep of the House of
[2:23:47] Israel amen and as you go preach saying
[2:23:50] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so this
[2:23:53] blow my
[2:23:55] mind because here it is he is given his
[2:23:58] disciples power but the power they get
[2:24:00] is
[2:24:02] jurisdictional he's saying he have power
[2:24:03] to heal the C devil said but the power
[2:24:05] given you I'm not giv you enough power
[2:24:08] to go into the Samaritan and the
[2:24:10] Gentiles you ready for that he is saying
[2:24:14] it that way to them but in the divine
[2:24:15] plan of God you're ready for that yet
[2:24:17] you need a different kind of power to go
[2:24:19] after the Samaritans and the Gentiles
[2:24:21] this is why when he goes to the
[2:24:23] Samaritans he's he God wants to handle
[2:24:25] it
[2:24:26] himself it was not the ministry of those
[2:24:31] Apostles at that time to go to the
[2:24:33] Samaritans or he say with this power it
[2:24:35] is restricted to
[2:24:37] Jerusalem Judea that's your jurisdiction
[2:24:40] do what you want in this area but do not
[2:24:42] enter into the Samaritans or the
[2:24:43] Gentiles that Ministry is not for
[2:24:46] you anybody with me it's powerful I want
[2:24:50] you to say how important you are so we
[2:24:51] see in scripture Jesus himself went to
[2:24:55] the Samaritans he didn't leave it to his
[2:24:59] disciples but now let's relook at a very
[2:25:02] famous very familiar scripture to us to
[2:25:06] now reconcile this acts
[2:25:10] 18 you know the scripture acts:
[2:25:14] 18 so the power and the ministry given
[2:25:17] to the disciples before the Holy Ghost P
[2:25:19] was very different to after because in
[2:25:21] acts when he says but he shall receive
[2:25:24] power which is different from Matthew 10
[2:25:26] power he said you shall receive power
[2:25:28] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:25:30] you and with this
[2:25:32] PowerAll ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[2:25:35] listen both in Jerusalem and in Judea
[2:25:39] and in the job World your job
[2:25:41] description get
[2:25:42] expanded he say in Matthew 10 I couldn't
[2:25:45] give you this part but now that I've
[2:25:47] died and rose again now this power and
[2:25:51] releasing gives you the authority let's
[2:25:54] read it
[2:25:55] now and ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[2:25:58] both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in
[2:26:02] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[2:26:04] the earth which is which is to the
[2:26:06] gentille so in other words the ministry
[2:26:09] to the
[2:26:10] Samaritans before Jesus died only he
[2:26:12] could handle it and even after he died
[2:26:15] he said I want to be involved so I'm
[2:26:17] going to give you power which is God
[2:26:19] himself in the form of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:20] so is God in Paul is God in Phillip is
[2:26:24] God in Peter anybody with me so the
[2:26:27] ministry to the Samaritans and the
[2:26:29] Gentiles was all Christ Ministry he
[2:26:32] introduced himself to the Jews he
[2:26:34] introduced himself to the Samaritans
[2:26:35] when he went to that woman of the well
[2:26:37] and to the people there and after that
[2:26:39] the only salvation to the Samaritans was
[2:26:43] in Acts 10 after the Holy Ghost poured
[2:26:46] out when philli went and preached and
[2:26:48] they were baptized and Peter the SA
[2:26:50] Peter come and lay hands upon them and
[2:26:52] they were filled with the Holy Ghost can
[2:26:54] the church say Amen the unfolding of the
[2:26:58] Plan of
[2:26:59] Redemption to see how God created a
[2:27:03] bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles
[2:27:06] and why his interaction with the
[2:27:07] Samaritan woman and the placing of even
[2:27:09] Samaria within the Great Commission and
[2:27:12] he shall be witnessed unto me both in
[2:27:13] Judea in in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and
[2:27:17] in the uttermost path of the earth amen
[2:27:19] amen
[2:27:22] amen can the church say
[2:27:25] [Applause]
[2:27:27] Amen a
[2:27:29] bridge but the bandam said it this way
[2:27:31] he said and done then in recognizing
[2:27:33] your day and his message but then one
[2:27:34] day the lightning begin to flash the
[2:27:36] Thunders begin to Roar and the Spirit
[2:27:38] come upon the prophet talking about job
[2:27:39] and he saw the coming of a man who could
[2:27:42] put his hand upon a sinful man and a
[2:27:44] holy God and bridged
[2:27:45] way we talking about creating a bridge a
[2:27:49] bridge between Jew that salvation of the
[2:27:51] Jews and the Gentiles a bridge between
[2:27:53] you having access to God somebody had to
[2:27:55] bridge that woman who came to the world
[2:27:57] because nobody was coming to her Jesus
[2:27:58] himself became the
[2:27:59] [Music]
[2:28:01] bridge and by him being a bridge to her
[2:28:04] her testimony became a bridge to her
[2:28:06] people because of her her people were
[2:28:08] saved and that testimony became a bridge
[2:28:10] to us that the Samaritans could be saved
[2:28:12] now the Gentiles could be go after Jesus
[2:28:15] himself not going physically after them
[2:28:17] but as the form of the Holy Ghost among
[2:28:19] his disciples he now goes after the
[2:28:21] Gentiles the ministry of Paul the Holy
[2:28:23] Ghost himself veil in Paul the messenger
[2:28:25] to the Gentiles can the church say
[2:28:28] [Applause]
[2:28:30] [Music]
[2:28:34] Amen in influence I think that's a great
[2:28:36] thing that we should look at in
[2:28:38] Christian Life there had to be a bridge
[2:28:40] to span way for the human race to leave
[2:28:42] this world someday and there was no one
[2:28:45] could do it an angel Archangel seraphim
[2:28:48] a cherubim nothing could do with God
[2:28:51] himself came down in the form of a man
[2:28:53] and bridged away and made the way and
[2:28:56] crossed the bridge first from the grave
[2:28:58] to glory and it shows through the
[2:29:00] reflection
[2:29:02] ameno Hallelujah from a message behold I
[2:29:05] stand at the door and N but and said
[2:29:07] going back to that woman of the well she
[2:29:08] ran into the City and said come see a
[2:29:11] man who told me the things I've done
[2:29:13] isn't this the Messiah if that was the
[2:29:15] sign of the Messiah then to the Jew and
[2:29:18] the Samaritan ham and jaffet people it's
[2:29:21] all that's left Jew Gentile Samaritan
[2:29:23] and now we've had 2,000 years of church
[2:29:26] God has called the Gentile bride out
[2:29:29] down through phiney and sanki and so
[2:29:31] forth the age now we at the end of the
[2:29:33] Gentile age at the end time as I spoke
[2:29:35] of last night at anytime something could
[2:29:37] happen the world's nervous you hear the
[2:29:39] president speech yesterday and well we

[2:29:46] be and everything the whole world shaken
[2:29:49] men dying with hard failure perplex of
[2:29:51] times and stress between the Nations and

[2:30:05] himself to the Jews and to the

[2:30:12] church say Amen so almighty God can we
