[28:25] there's an ultraman but he wants you to
[28:26] be strengthened in the inner man
[28:28] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[28:30] faith and that he being rooted and
[28:32] grounded in love
[28:33] may be able to comprehend with all sins
[28:35] what is the bread
[28:37] the length the death the height and to
[28:38] know the love of christ which pass it
[28:40] knowledge
[28:41] that you might be filled with the
[28:42] fullness of god
[28:44] filled with the fullness of god amen
[28:46] praise god
[28:48] and to know the love of christ which
[28:50] passes knowledge
[28:52] and oh my my knowledge shall increase
[28:55] but we have to get into the love of
[28:56] christ amen which passes knowledge isn't
[28:59] that right
[28:59] because we could know all things we can
[29:01] know all mysteries but if we don't have
[29:03] this charity we
[29:04] are nothing amen and this is what i was
[29:06] referring to last night dear jesus but
[29:08] i'm praying for
[29:09] a man running from the presence of the
[29:10] lord he said help us tonight
[29:12] in these few words as we wait upon thee
[29:14] and we pray that your grace and mercy
[29:16] will be with us
[29:17] and tend our hearts move back the shocks
[29:19] the thorns
[29:20] the tissues let the blessed sunshine of
[29:22] god falling upon the word lord
[29:24] and may we have such a meeting till
[29:26] there'll not be an unsafe person among
[29:28] us
[29:29] all the children will be in the kingdom
[29:31] of god amen
[29:32] i'm liking that good kingdom it just
[29:35] raises you above this church thing
[29:37] oh glory to god isn't that right amen
[29:39] the kingdom of god
[29:41] those without the baptism of the spirit
[29:43] may they receive it father
[29:44] here we go may all the great mysteries
[29:47] that we are supposed to know at this age
[29:49] lord be unveiled to
[29:51] us that we that we will see the
[29:54] plainness of god
[29:55] so that we know how to behave ourselves
[29:58] and act amen correcting ourselves
[30:02] and bringing the members of our body
[30:04] into the discipline of the word
[30:06] amen that we might know how to live in
[30:08] this present day
[30:09] at the approach of the lord jesus so the
[30:11] purpose of the reveal of the mysteries
[30:13] wasn't for education
[30:15] no it wasn't for information it was for
[30:17] us to see this is god
[30:19] to see the plainness of god to bring you
[30:21] into our god consciousness
[30:23] because remember we lost our god
[30:24] consciousness because we were born in
[30:26] sin
[30:26] shape iniquity like we said those
[30:28] children born into monarchy in england
[30:30] they're born into a certain environment
[30:33] they have to take the child and place
[30:35] the child and groom the child in that
[30:36] environment
[30:37] that's right then the child's
[30:38] consciousness is royalty so when they
[30:41] on the on the track chariot or chariot
[30:45] on the uh i don't know what they call
[30:47] the carriage and so on
[30:48] and people will even they expect that
[30:50] amen amen
[30:51] if nobody waves they call them they will
[30:53] face my word
[30:56] in other words this is the prince this
[30:57] and the prince's that and everybody
[30:59] waving and
[30:59] waving everybody want to wave and have
[31:01] flags and so that is what they're
[31:02] supposed to do because that's royalty
[31:05] but you were royalty amen that is what
[31:08] you come here to get into a
[31:09] consciousness and awareness
[31:11] and that's what we say last night the
[31:12] bible said you shall know as you are
[31:14] known
[31:14] that's right think about that now you
[31:17] shall know as you are known
[31:19] you don't know yet what god knows about
[31:21] you but one day
[31:22] you're gonna know as you are known amen
[31:25] oh glory to god we seek you a glass
[31:28] darkly
[31:29] but then face to face we know impact
[31:33] we prophesy in part but when that which
[31:35] is perfect has come
[31:37] a perfect realization of where you come
[31:40] from
[31:40] where you're going who you are and whose
[31:43] you
[31:44] are oh
[31:46] [Applause]
[31:57] so the message is come out of and going
[32:00] into that's what it's all about that's
[32:01] right many people come out and argue
[32:04] come on first we'll quote come out and
[32:08] foster one another
[32:09] like i was preaching sometime i was
[32:10] talking about david and his brothers
[32:13] and david now come here father sending
[32:15] some food
[32:16] for his brothers and so on so david get
[32:18] there and they're trying to embarrass
[32:19] david
[32:20] they're trying to tell david this and
[32:22] david tell us
[32:23] certain goliath is over there but if
[32:25] david killed he wants to
[32:36] [Laughter]
[32:40] david the little david he's not
[32:42] qualified for the army and david is the
[32:44] man to defeat goliath
[32:46] because david have a backside of the
[32:48] desert experience
[32:49] amen that is unknown to the minister
[32:51] association
[32:52] hallelujah giving her a backside of
[32:56] the desert experience that's not known
[32:57] from everybody else
[32:59] all you have is a simple testimony when
[33:01] i was seen about the sheep
[33:02] a beer came and i dealt with him and the
[33:05] lion came and i dealt with him
[33:07] at that dude out there that giant out
[33:09] there
[33:10] he lost in his head and i don't even
[33:12] have a sword
[33:14] because i have the testimony of jesus i
[33:16] have the spirit of prophecy
[33:17] i'm anointed to prophesy because god is
[33:20] with me
[33:21] oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah and
[33:24] as long as you know god is with you
[33:26] move forward amen speak and move forward
[33:30] let your steps be of faith that is what

[44:16] missions have been left off
[44:17] he said no watch he said looted
[44:20] pre-justification my fate
[44:21] and common wesley signification but we
[44:23] are promised a quadration 10
[44:25] according to malachi 4 luke 22 17
[44:28] and so forth that there's got to come
[44:30] another ephesians to this
[44:32] yes this is promised friends
[44:35] not groups ephesians
[44:39] hallelujah and we find ephesians is a
[44:42] parallel of joshua
[44:43] so to preach ephesians where the prayer
[44:45] joshua and there's more land to be taken
[44:48] some people figure they satisfied with a
[44:49] couple of books and tapes on the prophet
[44:51] and there's plenty like they have a
[44:53] whole load of books and tips
[44:54] there's more land to be taken amen you
[44:56] see the word spirit now
[44:58] from profession to possession real land
[45:01] to be taken
[45:02] the only problem is yet across jordan
[45:04] they take it so it doesn't make sense
[45:06] don't use it binoculars and saying way
[45:08] looking real good let's check the map
[45:10] again let's check these books
[45:12] and these tips and so on you know you
[45:13] only spying over because jordan right
[45:15] there
[45:15] but you only spine hey you can't fight
[45:17] no philistines
[45:20] you can't fight the job you're looking
[45:23] across
[45:24] hey man you have modern technology
[45:26] you're zooming in and zooming out
[45:29] you're bringing the picture closer to
[45:30] you but you're not crossing jordan
[45:33] that's right because there's a weight
[45:34] across jordan there's a spirit
[45:36] atmosphere to cross your head amen
[45:38] there's something that will kill you
[45:40] because jordan represents death that's
[45:42] right
[45:43] that's right
[45:57] all of these woods dropped when the
[46:00] spirit of forgiveness
[46:02] comes upon you then you are free
[46:05] then you could see the person without
[46:06] getting a fight
[46:10] like one time i wanted to meet that
[46:11] brother
[46:13] i i want to know if i had something
[46:14] against him i want to meet him because
[46:16] if i have something against him how can
[46:17] i shake his hand properly
[46:19] if i have some kind of funny business so
[46:21] i reckon he's docking me and say brother
[46:26] see because you see you don't want that
[46:27] you want clarity in your spirit
[46:29] amen amen and you will see why to be a
[46:32] channel of charity
[46:33] and that's why brotherly kindness you
[46:35] could feel with that
[46:36] but brother the kindness is the platform
[46:39] for charity to come upon
[46:41] faith is based upon forgiveness amen so
[46:44] all this turn your heart back to the
[46:45] fate of the fathers
[46:46] and you're grumpy mean and nasty i want
[46:48] earth that could be the fate that was
[46:50] delivered
[46:52] that can't be before the woman have a
[46:55] baby
[46:56] a sweet spirit comes over her that's
[46:59] right
[46:59] regardless if she's a prostitute that's
[47:02] god's operation
[47:03] amen amen that sweet spirit that's
[47:06] probably kindness
[47:07] supposed to come upon the bride before
[47:09] the church is built
[47:10] into a manifestation because the sons of
[47:12] god have to be born
[47:14] listen into manifestation amen
[47:17] did you hear that yes sir jesus born
[47:19] grew up
[47:20] and he came to maturity and he came into
[47:22] manifestation by coming to identify the
[47:24] book and say the spirit is upon me and
[47:26] he begins to do the works of god that's
[47:28] right
[47:28] but sons of god have to be born into
[47:29] manifestation amen
[47:32] amen so we are promised another
[47:35] ephesians is predicted in the scripture
[47:37] and therefore i believe we are living in
[47:38] ephesians again back again
[47:40] we are living in what was left off in
[47:42] the street ages
[47:43] so alpha and omega that's what it's all
[47:46] about
[47:47] so that god hit from the devil and put
[47:50] it
[47:50] under the seventh seal this unfolding of
[47:54] this ephesians
[47:55] and put the thunders to make the bridge
[47:57] to unfold that amen oh hallelujah praise
[48:00] god amen listen though we said no we are
[48:02] in the last days we are given to
[48:03] understanding
[48:04] by the word we are going to understand
[48:07] it
[48:07] because it will come and efficiency it
[48:10] so you will not you know always you're
[48:11] not supposed to be confused
[48:13] by any promise that's right it's too
[48:15] late for that it's over 40 plus years
[48:17] brilliant random of common earth there
[48:18] shall be no confusion amen
[48:20] there should be clarity of mind and
[48:22] purpose and vision as to what we're

[50:12] and god allow a lot of things to happen
[50:14] to test our attitudes
[50:16] to see how we will make out and sound
[50:18] like that oh
[50:19] my oh my oh my god so listen to this
[50:22] the scripture we read in genesis 26 who
[50:25] is one of gera this is amplified call
[50:27] with isaac huzman
[50:28] and say the water is ours and he named
[50:30] the world essec that name means
[50:32] contention
[50:33] because they qualified him and then they
[50:36] quarrel over the next well
[50:38] they call it now that means enmity and
[50:41] the third one
[50:42] no no more recorded over it well they
[50:45] call it real but
[50:46] because room there's room for all of us
[50:48] amen
[50:51] oh do you believe that amen all right so
[50:53] but obama's talking about here the
[50:54] lutheran church lost his light
[50:56] medicine lots of light the pentecostal
[50:58] church lost her light
[50:59] all lighting to be gone the church has
[51:01] no conscience no more
[51:03] you could hardly wake them up the bible
[51:05] said they will come in that day
[51:07] low the lord delay is coming and they'll
[51:10] be devouring and biting one another and
[51:11] fighting around it's exactly at hour
[51:14] that's something going to take place he
[51:15] said no she had a whole steering time
[51:17] she scrubbed the floor she swept the
[51:18] walls she took on the cobwebs you can't
[51:20] be proud and do that now
[51:22] if you're proud you wouldn't do that
[51:23] because your daughter your neighbors see
[51:25] half dust
[51:26] and how long you had the dust but this
[51:28] woman didn't care
[51:30] she swept the floors she throw the cup
[51:32] where neighbor said
[51:34] look at that garbage in front of that
[51:36] house
[51:37] yeah never you better check your garbage
[51:39] but that woman wasn't caring
[51:41] because she knew charity was coming she
[51:44] know the king was coming
[51:45] she knew her husband was coming so she
[51:47] decided to have a house cleaning time
[51:50] and when we leave here we're going to
[51:51] have a house clean in time
[51:54] oh glory to god forget your neighbor
[51:56] amen
[51:57] amen forget what allah is talking
[52:00] about one brother what brother
[52:05] accusation and what kind of stories
[52:06] against him he said just wind up his
[52:08] glass
[52:09] and could you try it i kind of like that
[52:12] why not the glass pony air conditioner
[52:13] and continue driving
[52:15] you can't even hear what they're saying
[52:16] out there and you will survive
[52:19] it will come true because when you hear
[52:20] and this is the point
[52:22] you say at them boxes see when they're
[52:24] going to win those heavyweight boxes and
[52:26] it's time to win
[52:27] must watch bombs they'll be talking to
[52:29] one another i'll beat you in the
[52:38] you don't say nothing that's right in
[52:40] your mind
[52:42] because that man just beat you you hear
[52:43] what i said i'm gonna beat you
[52:46] because you're trying to win the mind
[52:47] you win the fight before the fight
[52:49] that's what the devil does that's right
[52:51] no you're supposed to say put back devil
[52:52] if
[52:53] you don't say that if you don't say i'm
[52:55] going to
[52:56] be you see it for i'm going to turn
[52:57] wrong

[53:08] have to begin to speak back
[53:10] get the lord and shout on that
[53:22] she swept the walls she took down the
[53:24] cobwebs she kept on until
[53:27] she found what she had lost and when she
[53:29] did she called her little sister

[1:06:20] will be shaken
[1:06:21] by the things coming up on the earth
[1:06:23] nothing will stop it
[1:06:25] it's called perplexity men are feeling
[1:06:27] for fear for the teams that are coming
[1:06:29] upon the world
[1:06:30] but there's going to be a people that
[1:06:32] have faith that this ephesians gonna
[1:06:34] come forth amen because joshua was his
[1:06:36] ephesians
[1:06:37] when he said son stand still all these

[1:11:48] justification
[1:11:49] what watch spirit water blood spirit
[1:11:52] now this last great step must come into
[1:11:56] perfection
[1:11:57] that the holy spirit has to live in that
[1:12:00] church so perfectly
[1:12:01] it will make the head and body unite
[1:12:03] together amen this
[1:12:04] last great step oh glory to god let's
[1:12:07] continue a little bit
[1:12:08] he's talking about adoption the tutor
[1:12:10] brought word to the father
[1:12:12] that there was to be a placing of a son
[1:12:14] and we have we have seen
[1:12:16] watch and the same son that was born
[1:12:19] into the family could be abducted into
[1:12:21] the same family or placed in the same
[1:12:23] family or give a position in the family
[1:12:25] he was born into
[1:12:26] and i do believe that is what the work
[1:12:28] of the holy spirit today
[1:12:29] among the church is trying trying to
[1:12:32] place in the church positionally
[1:12:34] apostles and and teachers and prophets
[1:12:36] and so forth and we have seen here we go
[1:12:39] many false alarms go forth among the
[1:12:42] people
[1:12:42] which only vindicated indicated real
[1:12:46] genuine adoption was at hand
[1:12:52] for adoption listen listen remember what
[1:12:55] we reached last night about royalty and
[1:12:56] so on
[1:12:57] listen up around words he was taken out
[1:12:59] in the public place
[1:13:00] and he was robed on a robe past purple
[1:13:03] or some color of royalty
[1:13:06] royal robe to those sons oh my
[1:13:09] and was set up to the whole city they
[1:13:11] could look and he was here
[1:13:12] oh my the next move of the church is for
[1:13:15] god after you have seen for salaam but
[1:13:17] now
[1:13:17] god will place in his church correctly
[1:13:21] god will do that amen not a man
[1:13:24] picking man man choosing man god
[1:13:27] sets in the church not some man set in
[1:13:31] the church
[1:13:32] okay so god will place in his church
[1:13:34] correctly apostles prophets teachers
[1:13:36] evangelists not man made cemetery borton
[1:13:39] is important but god will place into the
[1:13:41] church
[1:13:42] not theology runovers and overnights but
[1:13:44] go god placed in the church as god has
[1:13:46] chosen
[1:13:47] as the holy ghost has tutored oh my
[1:13:50] hallelujah praise peter jesus
[1:13:53] oh hallelujah you love him jesus amen oh
[1:13:56] my my mind
[1:13:57] there are three states of the journey
[1:13:58] we're going good
[1:14:00] page 13 out of 30. just like 17 more
[1:14:03] pages don't worry
[1:14:04] all right there are three stages of the
[1:14:06] journey and there are creatures on this
[1:14:07] journey but we are justified by faith
[1:14:09] believing on the lord jesus and so did
[1:14:12] israel in the wilderness to join us no
[1:14:13] place
[1:14:14] of rest traveling night and day fall in
[1:14:16] the pillar fire but
[1:14:17] finally they come to the promised land
[1:14:19] where they settle down
[1:14:20] israel had not received their promise
[1:14:22] but they were on their journey
[1:14:24] so god can't give inheritance on your
[1:14:26] journey
[1:14:41] don't leave it here put it in that land
[1:14:44] oh praise
[1:14:45] god amen amen hallelujah amen you love
[1:14:48] it
[1:14:48] yes sir praise god says but the
[1:14:50] believers in the kingdom is just your
[1:14:52] outfit
[1:14:52] that was going on to the promise they
[1:14:54] move over into the land
[1:14:55] and took the land as a possession let's
[1:14:58] not go on to the battle of the holy
[1:15:00] spirit let's not stop believing in the
[1:15:01] lord jesus
[1:15:01] being baptized but we go on to the
[1:15:03] promise of the holy ghost itself
[1:15:05] how god has set in the church through
[1:15:07] labor pains they get tremendous
[1:15:09] sometimes
[1:15:10] or when a church is growing this is one
[1:15:11] of my favorite quotes if you're hearing
[1:15:13] my siblings you might hear me question
[1:15:14] this over and over and over
[1:15:15] see policy always echoing that same
[1:15:16] thing because it's it's
[1:15:18] so real to me when god has set someone
[1:15:21] to church through the labor pains
[1:15:23] they get tremendous some time i want a
[1:15:25] church has grown in
[1:15:26] under the prosecution of the outside
[1:15:28] world believe in our lord jesus yeah we
[1:15:30] go that the promise of the holy ghost is
[1:15:32] just as real
[1:15:33] as it was to the pentecost how they
[1:15:35] groan and cry
[1:15:36] on the labor beings but when they are
[1:15:38] born and positionally born
[1:15:40] into the kingdom then god has set in the
[1:15:42] church apostles and prophets and so on
[1:15:43] like that
[1:15:44] oh praise the name of the lord amen
[1:15:47] glory to god amen
[1:15:48] amen god is trying to please his
[1:15:51] church in position to manifest himself
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:54] manifest himself so all these sermons
[1:15:57] and teaching
[1:15:58] like you know people like to talk about
[1:15:59] teachers and teachers and their
[1:16:00] preachers
[1:16:01] you know this preacher is sinner and
[1:16:04] evangelist to talk to the sinner
[1:16:06] and teach us disposition he plays the
[1:16:07] believer and i ask myself what
[1:16:09] are the believers being pleased for you
[1:16:12] have to be placed for power
[1:16:14] so it comes right back to the spirit
[1:16:16] it's not just teaching to be taught
[1:16:18] and preaching evangelism in this end
[1:16:20] time is not regular evangelism he said
[1:16:23] evangelism
[1:16:24] is shaping stones amen so eventually
[1:16:27] end time evangelism is not regular
[1:16:28] evangelism end time evangelism is
[1:16:31] cutting
[1:16:32] and shaping you to fit into god's
[1:16:34] program amen
[1:16:35] that is what that is about amen so god
[1:16:37] is trying to place his church in
[1:16:39] position
[1:16:39] to manifest himself getting one he can
[1:16:42] walk through like this and say dear it's
[1:16:43] my spirit
[1:16:45] freely adopt him place and manifest and
[1:16:48] take him out there
[1:16:49] and visit him with an angel tell him
[1:16:51] something if he's just making it up it
[1:16:53] won't work
[1:16:54] i mean manifestations of sons of god
[1:16:56] when god manifests himself
[1:16:58] he sends him out when he goes forth what
[1:17:00] he says is truth
[1:17:01] what he does is the truth what he does
[1:17:03] he manifests christ how do you judge him
[1:17:05] by the way he stays with the word right
[1:17:07] with the word
[1:17:09] oh glory to god so this weak word bride
[1:17:12] would have
[1:17:12] signs wonders and miracles isn't that
[1:17:14] right and she'll be following after
[1:17:16] second peter 147. isn't that right and
[1:17:19] the other church the other crop
[1:17:20] going to be second timothy one to nine
[1:17:22] amen oh glory to god having a form of
[1:17:24] godliness with all kind of attitudes
[1:17:26] and bad behavior and christian-like
[1:17:28] behavior you want to know the people
[1:17:29] even
[1:17:30] saved oh hallelujah that's right that's
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:33] that that is second timothy oh glory to
[1:17:35] god amen
[1:17:36] but it says in revelation 22 17 the
[1:17:38] spirit and the bride
[1:17:40] say come over hallelujah so let's take
[1:17:44] that to it well now
[1:17:45] oh glory to god hallelujah amen the
[1:17:48] first world they fight on it
