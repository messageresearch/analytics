connected to this service on this sunday morning lord we thank you for the presence of the angel that's in our midst father we welcome you lord into our hearts and lord as the world will go forth that you would take complete control father may you touch our hearts in a special way today father may you speak to us from your word and inspire your word to us to be lord better christians to be better sons to be better daughters father may you have your preeminence in the service this morning we commit to service into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen give the lord a hand of praise [Applause] you on the expectation this morning so i want to greet you one and all and if you have your bibles i'd like to go to two portions of scripture thank you brother anthony thank you musicians reading from the book of malachi 3 and hebrews 13 familiar passages of scripture this morning to lay a foundation reading malachi 3 and reading verse 6 for i am the lord and i change not we'll stop right there and hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord i trust you appreciate all the services that we've been having what a mighty blessing you appreciate your pastor this morning amen and uh i want to sleep with the terence for the exhortation on friday night as well god bless you with deterrence so this morning i have a title an unchanging god a changing world and a changing people an unchanging god a changing world and a changing people and for a subject i am the lord and i change not and an inspiration jesus christ to seem yesterday and today and forever so i want to kind of talk with you a little bit this morning to build into the thought and i trust and pray that it'll be a blessing to you this morning i was in school i was thought that the only constant exchange and at a time it kind of made sense the economy changing the jobs changing lives changing technology changing and it sort of made sense that the only constant was change but the deeper you go into scripture you realize that that is not true because an absolute statement like the only constant is change brings no context of god because the only thing that is constant is god [Applause] god existed before time he exists through time and when time is finished god will still exist you believe that this morning and if you are part of god it means you existed before time you will exist in time and when time is finished you will also exist the unchanging nature of god is what brings us into the house of god this morning because if he was a changing god we would have nothing to hold on to we would have nothing to anchor to and i'm going to get into it in a bit but i want to talk about the unchanging nature of god and tie it into the fact that this world is changing economics are changing lives are being changed people are changing situations are changing governments are changing just to think in scripture there are rows of pharaoh who did not know joseph that in and of itself is a paradox because the famine that the world would have gone through would have been so significant in that day so it's almost a mystery how a pharaoh would be raised up who did not know joseph but that change had to come to bring about something bigger the one constant in that situation was the fact that god remains the same he's the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever and he declares that i am the lord and i change not come the church say man so i want to lay a foundation because i want to really talk to the church this morning and on changing god interacting with a changing world you know what it is to sit for years and see the world changing you sit with somebody who has been here for a long time somebody who was here for a long time somebody who's 18 90 or 100 years old and they have seen a lot they've seen the world change you see a time before they were microwaves and before there was fast food and before there was facebook and before there was automatic washing machines and automatic dishwashers and automatic coffee machines and no matter how much technology we add to it we still can't find time to do what's important because the world is changing nothing is stopping the change and in the midst of the world changing god remains the same it's the same god that was there when adam walked the earth the same god i was there when noah was on the year the same god i was there when joseph was in prison in egypt the same god when moses led them out of egypt the same god is watching things unfold and he is not changing but the world is changing kingdoms rising kingdoms falling kings rising kings falling different things happening he watched the days of riding the horses and he watched the horses run around the walls of jericho and as these chains are happening he he is not changing he is the only constant stars rise stars disappear the landscape of the earth the coastline changes but god doesn't change the same yesterday today and forever you hear old people say they wish how it was or years ago when people used to say good morning and people were nicer to one another but just think about god he is the only one not changing oh how he wished things were the way they were back in the garden of eden before man got so corrupt the only one who has watched everything unfold and he can't change because his his nature doesn't allow him to change his nature doesn't allow him to to lie his nature doesn't allow him to [Applause] he can't even pull back his word when he speaks a blessing on you he can't even undo it because he is the god that changes not [Applause] [Music] oh he watched the children of israel walk through the open red sea he watched him in the promised land he saw him tend the tambourine when miriam beat the timer marine and and they are changing locations but he is not changing they are changing the kind of food they eat but he's not changing he watched david put those stones in the sling and he saw david take out the lion and take out the beer he saw david getting older david was changing but god was not changing david was getting mature in the backside of the desert the david who was there with the lion was not the same david who met goliath but the god was the same god oh you don't hear me this morning an unchanging god a changing world a changing people and he remains the same he saw prophet after prophet the weeping prophet jeremiah the great prophet elijah he saw them come they saw nebuchadnezzar he saw kingdoms rise he saw daniel he saw them all unfold and yet he remains the same he saw the political turmoil around the time that jesus would come the world had changed so much friends do you realize that the decision to pick barabbas over jesus was a political decision the world had changed so much that the children of israel as it were or the jews as it were were so oppressed by the politics of the time by the romans at the time they were looking for a deliverer who would be a revolutionary it was not based on the word or scripture it was based on the political upheavals of the time the military changes of the time was so much that against the backdrop of the miracles that jesus had wrought they still picked barabbas because the pressures of the world and the changes of the world were too much for them to look at spiritual things they were more concerned about the natural things so they picked a natural leader instead of a spiritual leader that's the impact of change on the world in which we live but yet still god says i am the lord and i change not [Applause] can we talk a little bit this morning have a conversation a little bit this morning from the message convinced and concerned i'm just laying the foundation to god really want to get to the changing people part but i want to touch on the changing god part for the unchanging god part first god gave the promise and when god gave the promise to abraham he said he would possess the gates of his enemy and so shamgar believes that and look at the odds against him god only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced that listen that jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand through and go on because he's thoroughly convinced that god is god and if he ever was god he is still god if he isn't the god he was he never was god that's right he's the infinite god the all-powerful almighty omnipresent omniscient infinite he's god he's the same god that opened the red sea he's the same god that brought daniel out of the lion's den the same god that brought the hebrew children from the fiery furnace he's the same god i'd raise up jesus christ on easter morning he's the same god and fell in the day of pentecost he's the same god and raised lazarus out of the grave he's the same yesterday today and forever and i'm convinced that this is the holy ghost peter said on the day of pentecost this is that if this isn't that i'll keep this till that comes for i believe this is that i'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the lord jesus in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in the pride so in the midst of everything that's taken place with the world changing the land's changing with what's happening in russia and ukraine and all this that's the world changing and people are changing and getting worse and worse and worse but in the midst of that there are also some people who are changing into a wonderful glorious image of sons and daughters of god can the church say amen so a change is happening this morning but ibrahim said his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes he said in malachi 3 i am god and i change not you change but god don't change god's method doesn't change he is still interested in taking sin out your heart that will never change he is still interested in giving you a transformation that will never change he is still interested in you getting a personal experience with god that can never change up i don't care how much new technology is put in place god's desire to be resident in your heart that will never change up i don't care how corrupt the world becomes god's desire to sit on the throne of the heart of sons and daughters that could never change up his desire to have a people in love with him and in love with one another that could never change and okay how dark the world gets up it's time to arise and shine thy light has come that could never change because that's how he is made up and his sons and daughters put them anywhere put them under any condition put them through any trial and something will anchor their souls to a constant god the anchor will hold despite the storm you may be seated you can learn more by going to school you can learn more by getting a degree but god can't learn more because he already knows everything oh you don't hear me this morning we learn we grow we change we mature but god cannot grow he cannot learn he cannot change he cannot mature because if that's what he has to go through he cannot be my god my god already knows the end from the beginning he has declared he's the alpha and he is the omega he is the beginning and he's the end can't you trust this god to make things work out for your family can't you trust his god to change your situation can't you trust this god to change your circumstances oh i declare this morning he's still a healer he is still a deliverer he is still a restorer he is still a baptizer he still hears the cries of his people he still responds to the call of somebody this morning can we give the lord a shout out praise can we lift him up this morning oh hallelujah [Applause] he never changes he said in malachi 3 i am god and i change not the way he does it therefore if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one he'll have to save the next one and everyone he saves would have to be the same way oh god i thank god that he repeats the process i thank god that he don't change because he don't change i have a chance oh god help me this morning because he don't change i could get access to his power because the same blood that tell peter the same blood that was through the ages is the same blood that covers me this morning oh come on now the blood prevails there's still power in the blood thank god for the blood up i don't care what technology come there's no technology that could fight the blood the blood could never lose its power oh you don't hear me this morning you may be seated if he healed a man at any time this is called precedent in law god's law is unchanging so based on the law you could go to a court case and say your honor based on case so and so you hear somebody who had enough fear for healing and are coming this morning with faith based on the precedent that it was done before are coming to claim what is mine this morning and the good thing is that the law and the writer of the law and the lawyer in the courtroom and the judge of the seat is all the same person so god is enforcing his law he is defending his law he's advocating for his law and he's approving his law or you don't hear me to slow them i am god and i changed not so what are you worried about your children because of promises unto you and your children it has nothing to do with you saving them it's god law being made effective to your house he said plea the blood apply the token for your children do your part apply the token for your house apply the token and god will do the rest come on somebody preach back to me [Music] [Applause] if he healed a man at any time through the journey of life let it be in the days of jesus the apostles the prophets whenever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again there's no room for him to not do it because thank god he's the same god so he's got to do it again that's right i'm reading he doesn't change man changes time changes age changes dispensation changes but god remains the same he is perfect what a hope that ought to give to sick people oh my my my my my and by the branham goes on if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met he ever ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time listen if he ever filled a man with the holy ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raise a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle somebody give god a shout out praise [Music] [Applause] i'm still laying a foundation i'm trying to talk to you i'm not preaching it he doesn't change or what a hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made theory something that groups of men have come together but his unchangeable word hallelujah the psalmist david my days are like a shadow that decline it in psalms 102 and i am with it like grass so david is recognizing his changes and the changes in his life the changes in the situation the changes in the circumstance my days are like a shadow that decline it and i am withered like grass the use of the word wither is a is a transformative word because the weather meant you were better before and you declined so he's building a case but he goes on but thou o lord shalt endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favor her year the set time has come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord for he had looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven to the lord behold earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to lose those that are appointed to death there are those that are appointed to death but god is looking now to loose them from that appointment or you don't hear me this morning to declare the name of the lord and zion and his praise in jerusalem when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord and david reversed himself he weakened my strength and the way he shortened my days i said oh my god take me not away in the midst of my days the years are throughout all generations david was recognizing the difference in in his time and the way god counts years through the generations he said of all hast thou lay the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands they shall perish but thou shalt endure ye all of them shall wax oh like a garment as a vestia shalt thou change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and their years shall have no end can the church say amen everybody feeling fine this morning can we give the lord a hand of praise still laying a foundation to get to somewhere james 1 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and coming down from the father of light with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning speaking about the fact that god doesn't change and as a vesture shall thou this is hebrews 1 12 fold them up and they shall be chained but thou are the same and thy ears shall not fail paul is repeating what david said god cannot change his expectations cannot change god's word cannot change god's promises cannot change god's mercies cannot change god's sovereignty cannot change god's nature cannot change god's desires cannot change his favor cannot change his desire to predestinate you cannot change or you don't hear me this morning you could change in the morning and change your mind but when you changing god cannot change when you backslide thank god that he doesn't change and he can't change his mind about you oh come on now somebody gave god a shout out praise when you feel down and depressed because you are subject to change thank god that god doesn't change because he doesn't get depressed he just holds on to his word because it is his word can the chain should say amen so you thank god he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever but i branham in preaching this he would reference the fact that as he traveled different places in the world he referenced 35 years ago he was in a certain place under and the roads were different once there was something and now there's a park once there was something else and there's something else there change it's different and he was saying all of the medicine all the technology he he referenced how how john wesley's mom didn't have access to the technology we have but she still made time to pray modernly we have all of the things that increase productivity and fast this and fast that and and still we can't find time and that's the world changing and you if you get caught up in this you change with the world and you miss the mark of what's important and because you have less time because you have to do all these things doesn't make god's word changer you spending time doing all kind of stuff doesn't change god's requirement for the token to be displayed the world being discourteous to one another doesn't change the fact that you have to have love for your enemies you know i don't care if you're the only one walking in your office saying good morning and have a blessed day how they act can change the way you act because you are you are not from here and you can't change the way the world is changing the world will continue to get worse you may be seated the technology in the world is designed for change if you study the psychology of social media and the new social media platforms they are actually proven to rewire your brain to shorten your attention span people get this thrill of going to platforms and in in in they call it short form video 15 seconds 10 seconds eight seconds 30 it's short and and you're spending time jumping from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing getting a dopamine rush that makes you looking for just short-term satisfaction until in school students can't study anymore they can't focus anymore they talk about adhd and all these things because we have programmed ourselves to want to consume things in small pieces we can't sit down anymore and whereas god told us to meditate on the word day and night in other words concentrate on it this is not something you're taking a 10-second gospel and a 15-second thing and a 20-second sam and you're jumbled to something else you have to bask in this thing you have to live in this thing you have to want to enjoy this thing you need to plug into this thing for a while to detox your brain oh come on somebody help me this morning detox from all of the stuff in the world i want to help us this morning i don't care how much the economy changed there was a time man used to batter for goods and services there was no currency to exchange i had chickens and they laid eggs i bring the eggs to you and you give me milk from your cow and eventually currency came into play now they're talking about cryptocurrency so no longer paper currency we have credit cards we have bitcoin we have ethereum we have all these things the world is changing but in the midst of that god says i'm still your provider i'm still jehovah gyra i don't care what man calls what they're trying to do to solve their problem my children can speak for what they want and it's supposed to create itself because this spoken word is the original seed you don't hear me this morning [Music] i am the lord and i change not he provided there in the desert he provided here when the prophet was on the earth and he'll still provide for you it doesn't matter how much your world changes this world will change and continue to change but god still remains the same you may be seated but a brandon would reference the way people dressed in the 50s and before and now now we see there's no moral compass and you speak about it you're a hater you're you're anti-feminist you're you're this and you're that and all of these words and phrases who independent and all these things and in the meanwhile god's standard change you know if your employer changes the standards they could do that but god not changing this standard [Music] if the government change a law and a policy that is not that don't mean god lord change if the government allowed things to happen that were taboo years ago don't mean god change his mind about the way he feels about things oh you don't hear me this morning the world has changed to make things acceptable and they try to climb down speaking against sin oh god help us as i say if god don't judge his will he'll have to repent of sodom and gomorrah because he cannot change and because he cannot change judgment is set judgment is set the arrow of judgment has already been loose and has just been held back until sons and daughters are sealed into the kingdom of god you don't hear me this morning [Music] because the world has changed some job that existed years ago no longer exist if you were the best horseshoe maker in the world when henry ford drove the first car you could not improve on being a horseshoe maker because the age of the horseshoe was over you had to change to becoming a mechanic if you wanted to be tied to the movement or the automobile or the transportation industry you couldn't say well i'm going to do a masters in horseshoe now because the horses were being put in stables and cars were now on the road technology change economic change but with it time and thing listen this plan they make change people don't know do you know how you have changed because of the pandemic i'm gonna get to it a little bit do you realize how much you've changed people have gotten so relaxed churches now uh i click i could click on and you could connect to god like just connect into to some other app you're switching apps you could watch anything on youtube and then switch your servers and switch back to another thing on youtube and it's just another thing to do when moses walked up under the mountain where the burning bush was he said moses take off your shoes from off your feet because the place you're standing is holy ground don't approach me like you approach everything else don't approach me the way you approach your boss don't approach me the way you approach your co-worker don't even approach me the way you approach a priest or a pastor you're approaching god and you have to conduct yourself a certain way take off your shoes because the place you're standing is holy ground come with reverence even isaiah had to walk and when he got into the presence of god he didn't even realize his own issues until the light shone upon him and he said woe is me i didn't i didn't realize i had this baggage in my life because he came into presence you have to realize what god is testing what god is allowing to see if you really understand who he is and the fact that he is the same god that say put off your shoes is the same god that operates today you know so if he hasn't changed and you allow the world and the technology changes to change your reverence to the things of god think about it friends can you watch a youtube video the same way you watch a service the same atmosphere the same approach is just it's just another thing to do where is the reverence where's the respect this is not about the church this is about god he is god and he hasn't changed he killed ananias and sapphira because of what was in their heart don't you realize people are spiritually dead and they're still in the church connected on the internet and dead god hasn't changed his word hasn't changed oh let me help you this morning in a message as i thought in my way we cannot alter god's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind of christ be in you then you'll think like he thinks we can't put god into our bucket of our imagination he becomes a god of our imagination we have to go up to his standard friends so this morning i'm talking to you an unchanging god a changing world and a changing people moses listen friends you cannot come into contact with god and remain the same you either get worse or you get better but there's nothing like being the same so there are people in here this morning and listening on the internet who are either getting better or getting worse but you're not staying the same how will you leave this service this morning will you leave better or will you leave worse but isaac is it true could you leave worse of course i'll get to it in a bit moses had to go through a change he had thought that his ability could have helped them and he killed one man ran for his life 40 years in the wilderness mining somebody else sheep i think brother anthony preached it you see he didn't even have his own stuff by then after 40 years but when he met god he had an encounter with god and he had a change an unchangeable god met a man who could change and that man was changed can the church say amen an unchangeable god stood there and said take off your shoes he said i have heard the cries of my people and i've come down to the liver now you need to go but the condition you are in you can't go like that you need a change you need an encounter something has to happen in your life [Music] you don't hear me this morning that's why we came to church the problem in the message people have knowledge and they haven't changed oh i want to say it again you know knowledge can make you better always so people sit in a message and the knowledge of this revealed word has actually made them worse the knowledge of the mysteries and sabino canyon and the king's sword has actually made them lose love can't forgive can reach out to somebody else because change is guaranteed you know oh yeah we're gonna get it but i thank god when moses met the pillar of fire his change was for the better he changed supernatural encounter a man that could change met an unchangeable god and change for the better anybody wants to meet an unchangeable god and get a change for the better don't come to service this morning and go back home worse you know i'm not even going to say go back home the same way you came because i know you're not going to go home the same way you're going to go home better or you're going to go home worse a lot of people in this pandemic over the last two years have gotten worse their knowledge of the world has increased but their behavior their conduct has actually gone worse can i take my time isaiah came into the presence of god and he couldn't stay the same he said woe is me he said take the calls cleanse my lip isaiah didn't realize before his encounter that he had issues that his lips were impured jacob had an encounter with god but abraham said it would maybe have been the first time he got a hold of something real in his whole life and he had a change like we all have to go through changes and he got changed for the better his walk changes his walk his walk changes his life changes his language changes [Music] it's impossible but a shame to meet god and remain the same oh what it would be like to meet jesus face to face and to have the opportunity for a change isn't that your desire and here it was in scripture a young man gets this opportunity to walk up to jesus good master what more must i do to have eternal life a man that could change looking for change speaks to an unchangeable god about what he had to change the question he asks is what more must i do in other words i know i need to change help me to understand this morning the change i need to make in my life from my youth i've obeyed the commandments from my youth i've done what i'm supposed to do what lacquer yet do you know you need change do you know that's why we came this morning to to change and jesus loved this man looked into his heart and he said go sell all you have and give to the poor and jesus wrote a prescription brother popcorn for him to go and take the pharmacy and begin to administer for himself this is not jesus have to do it he said you go and do it in other words i'm writing the prescription for the change you need in your life to fix the things that need to be fixed i didn't come to you you came to me looking for a prescription you know there are issues and you come looking for it i'm writing the prescription for you to change your diet for you to change your friends for you to change how you live and when jesus wrote the prescription this young man went home sorrowful because he refused to change the change was too much for him he left worse you know what it is to meet jesus and leave worse warning you friends this service is to prick your heart that there are issues i i i need a change i want god to speak to me through his word this morning so i can know what i need to change and uh lord give me the strength to take this prescription give me the strength to do what i need to do because my joy my peace i know something isn't right that's how the rich wrong that's what prompted him he didn't come because he was feeling to come to church you know he came to jesus because he knew that he had some issues can the church say amen let me talk to you for a little bit friends every experience in life changes you every word every song every image you see every video you watch every conversation you have changes you when you rest your body changes if you don't get enough sleep your body also changes the food you eat changes you your prayer life changes you when you stop praying it changes you when you speak positively it changes you when you speak negatively it changes you when i got married it changed me when my daughter was born it changed me your successes change you your failures change you the people around you change you every interaction every experience in life changes you in a constant war to align the physical natural mental emotional and ever-changing beings we are a war between that and the spiritual eternal beings that we are in the mind of god a war of reconciliation because we are changeable but god cannot change and the attributes seed in us from god also cannot change but our state on a day-to-day basis right now might be variable your standing might be variable as we work towards a perfect standing and a perfect state or anybody with me this morning can we have a conversation you may be seated a lack of a deep understanding of this reality results in pain frustration and a range of emotions sometimes we are different people in the morning then in the evening i thank god and he doesn't change and the way he receives the prayer in the morning and the way he receives a prayer in the evening it doesn't change but we change we are different people when we receive good news and when we receive bad news we talk about having to time people to have a conversation with them because we don't know who they are at that particular point in time we make comments like he's a different person you see how that job changed him yesterday change him you see we get promoted and he different he don't talk to us anymore you say we leave the community and be different change constant every experience every action every newspaper article every online piece of content is either making you better or making you worse do you realize this friends every phone call every whatsapp message every forward you receive and every forward you forward exactly changing you when someone backslides it means the combination of negative changes were more than the combination of positive changes in scripture we see a pattern over and over again the children of israel went from a victorious standing and state to becoming relaxed change again it wasn't overnight you know it was always gradual the missiles missile service the missile offering and they miss doing a thing here and before you know it they became relaxed end up in sin end up in judgment and up in captivity until the pain was enough that they started to repent and then god would step in he would restore them put them back in the victory but that victory would last as long as they started to just slip away again such is the story of every age change of the world and the people and there's an unchangeable god watching all of this taking place friends are you working on changing your life people sit down in churches this morning taking notes and writing stuff and they don't want to change you know because they still don't want to forgive because the change is not just a change of thinking it has to lead to a change in behavior it must lead to a change in conduct that is the thunder that shakes the devil and change forward change is a choice you could change your worship right now you'd have to wait till the end of the service pop-pop well you could change it right now i know you can say wait a minute i lift my hand for this service let me just lift my hand but abraham said that's defining law of gravity just to lift your hand defies the law of gravity and let the devil know listen i am changing i may not have a reason in my mind to worship but i still wishing with god anyhow just to confuse the devil just to frustrate the enemy just to show the devil that i might just have my gums but i'm not gonna back down anybody feel that way this morning [Applause] i hope this helps you know but the brandon was operating for years and god said my son you still have some more changing you need to be more sincere many experiences were designed to change the way the prophet looked at certain things and god says you have an exchange you know are we open to hearing god telling us what we need to change or you have to take me as i am you know how i was with 20 years don't try to change me now and i just see it you know i just see it or i don't know what live from emotional if you come to me you know you're getting straight and let's be good until you push me to push me i didn't start it she started and dies why i say that and you don't see the need to change you don't seem to check yourself against your word i thank god that hero changing them i hope this is a conversation this morning i hope it helps you know question what changes are you willing to make today are you willing to shut off somebody facebook and the videos and the content i see believers i mean sharing things and i want to know why you would share that how is it edifying you or somebody else i see young people sharing content from people and singing and is that is are those your idols are those your role models are those people you look up to and then you want to know where you went wrong and what happened to you and why but just can't get a new spirit at this fine service this is a certain way i really can't get me spirit how much time you spend on fake on facebook and tech talk on instagram and old talking and watching movies and and and you want and you have a problem getting it and you don't wonder why it's on you all we're hearing is he promises and he promises and he promises is he promised real to you because when they found you well shiman looking for the world revival he said we're looking for because i am the rival the revival right here i don't know what you're looking for the revival was in him is he revival in you because the minister can't bring the revival are you coming parade up are you coming in the spirit are you coming with your gun shooting the devil left right and center so that when you enter the church the atmosphere changes anybody with me this morning [Applause] what changes are you willing to make today this week this month this year if the lord tarries the rich young ruler was not willing to change change unchangeable god a changing world a changing people could you take some more brother jude found himself looking around the service one day and jude realized that the church changed and that prompted you to write a letter beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly content for the fate which was once delivered to the saints in other words are looking around and things are not where it's supposed to be and more than that is not how it used to be churches change can we go on pastors change ministers change elders change deacons change ushers change musicians change trustees change some for the better some for the worse some lose the burden it just becomes something to do you're just playing music you're playing you're playing music you're doing the technical but the passion and the zeal you used to have is no longer there who is responsible did god change because he can't change that's why the prophet can say if you ever find you're disconnected from god you have to go back to where you left him because god doesn't leave you god doesn't change friends could you see how you have changed and and are you willing to work back and then work harder to move beyond where you've ever been before in a spiritual walk climb higher i'm not preaching to you i'm looking at this i'm looking at my own life i'm saying listen friends we have to do something we must do better paul himself recognized his own vulnerability let me just find it quickly you saying people can't change paul said but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accused so paul was being so careful as a minister that he was saying listen i don't know how much i'm going to change and i don't know if i will change i don't know where i'll be in years to come so if i come back to you and preach something different from the service this morning curse me also because i don't see myself this is an apostle speaking here again i want to make the point anybody with me this morning change jude spoke about it pastors change listen being tattooed he has any pulpit don't mean you could be faithful to the poor people are not faithful to the world so i want us to understand some things friend that this thing about change is really deep because sometimes it is only be when people see us for a long time they recognize how much you're different pastors ministers elders deacons ushers and paul in his wisdom put today in scripture for us to see his vulnerability and in two places i always reference this paul said follow me as i follow christ he put a clause a limiting clause so i'm not following paul till till i did i don't know paul said watch me and watch christ and don't ever lose sight of christ because if i deviate keep following christ and forget me you know and paul's saying i know what i'm preaching this morning is the truth if i come and preach any other gospel because if my life because paul had his struggles he said when i would do good evil is present paul going to his own experience paul wasn't perfect he said if i come back and preach a different gospel which means i have changed i've heard many people say listen that preacher he's not preaching like he used to anymore he doctrine change oh you could change your doctrine in this message when we have one message one prophet one lord one faith one baptism all the word revealed and you have a change in doctrine that is a mystery that is what you call a mystery because the revealed word is one plum liner it'll have 15 plumb line can we go a little further it's just a conversation this morning to help us right change [Music] and realizing this thing called change the pastor and i have stood behind this sacred desk and walked couples through their vows and we asked them to answer the question for better offers for richer or poorer for sickness or health the question is never the person they are right now you know i want that to sit a little bit the moment a young brother sister says i do they have changed every interaction changes you so when you say i do at the altar you have to realize that you really have to say i do to all the future versions of this person and what this person will become that is what makes it love and commitment i've never seen a couple leave you alter with a desire to fail but i've heard many couples said i've grown apart which men they did not change together they change in separate directions and unless you understand that we are in a changing world with changing people and the only content is god then you end up in a rude awakening that the person you married five years 10 years 15 years 20 years ago is actually not the person who walked at the altar you've both been through some stuff that change your perspective change your expectations change your hopes and change your dreams the only constant who was at that wedding was god because even the officiated minister would have changed the guess in the wedding would have changed friends we're going into a kind of mature kind of conversation how much grace we must have if we realize the person we're talking to is not the same person we married it is impossible for it to be the same person because that's not how life is change is guaranteed the child in your house last week monday and this monday is two different children simply going to school simply doing school work simply learning a new topic simply hearing something they are changing and if they're not anchored to the constant of god they could change so much they lose their connection to god i hope this helps somebody this morning i'm not going to be too much longer how has this pandemic changed you are you more consecrated or less consecrated do you have a greater desire to serve god or you're just going through the emotions i can't say it for you you know you have to answer it for yourself do you realize how you have changed and then if you change i've been over preached many times if you're behind you either stay behind or you do something to catch up and make up the distance you know just a few more and i've done this morning from the message who is this then if that is true a supernatural god cannot change his nature to fit people's nature people has to change their nature to fit god's supernatural plans that's why people cry who is this is god in the midst of his people they don't understand it god will never come to your level you have to come to his god will not come to your requirement you have to come to god's and then when that requirement is met upon a promise that god made to redeem the people if that requirement has met your entire being changes your thinking changes your habits change everything about you changes your desires change your livings change your habits change you change everything about you changes god is a new life in you and that's the hope that's the expectation that's my desire is anybody looking for a change hallelujah oh my and that's what makes the people today say who is this is that the fella who used to work over here is that who is that where did he go to school at what credential city pack what's the matter with us something happened in this the woman who used to wear shorts but something happened isn't this the man that used to smoke cigars but something happened isn't this the man that used to drink but something happened isn't this the man and woman used to curse i'll go to the nightclub but they don't do it no more what is it it's the holy spirit the person of god living in them i'll go down to their churches to find out what's the matter can the church say man my from who is this those who believe in god those who is born of his spirit those who have the holy ghost and they know that the holy ghost is the spirit of god and that he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change his nature for he is god but when god comes into people oh my when god comes into people it makes them believe for the impossible oh come on somebody help me this morning [Applause] so i'm looking for a change i'm an expectation for a change friends a change from this mortal to immortality a change from okamo now a change from a world into a butterfly a change from a wretched man into a son of god this world is looking for a change the whole creation groaning to failing for the manifestation of the sons of god what is that it means a change must come upon some sons come back into their position they have to change from church members into their position they have to change your message believers into sons of god oh come on now the change is not into the message the changes from the message into manifested sons of god all the changes from in the message to adopted sons of god the changes from in the message to perfect sons of god oh that's a change when born sons fill sons of places and speak and what they said is created dear that's what i'm looking for can the church say man i'm almost done oh hallelujah just to think that in a changing world and with changing people getting worse worse worse you look at the people there's crime it's murder it's rape it's kidnapping if the world is changing the people are changing but there's another change going on with another people in their land who under their messenger will change to become the final voice to the final age there's another transformation taking place be transformed by the renewing of your mind you're not gonna be the same person no more but from this day from this day forward as for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord as for me and my house i'm identifying i'm part of the change all glory to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory oh my glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah i'm looking for a change a change in my thinking a change in my work a change in my talk i'm trying to get above the technology get above the economy get above the world system get above the virus that's all distraction get above russia and ukraine get above all of this and change from natural to supernatural because we don't serve a natural god we serve a supernatural god we are not natural people we are supernatural people oh god help me to see the change this morning change from glory to glory change from power to power change from the old wretched man that you came in this morning and you're leaving different because your mind been opened you've been rebooted you've been renewed by a chance from in power that lets you know that the unchanging god is still more unable to open the red sea in your life that the unchanging god is still able to help you deal with the goliath that's waiting for you at home it's going to be power coming into you to deal with your oppositions can the church say amen [Applause] what are you speaking about preacher a change in your nature because when your nature changes your words change when your nature changes your walk change when your nature changes your love changes that's why the bible says i give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and i'm going to put my holy spirit inside of there but abraham said your heart and your spirit can't even get along with yourself father let's get along with your wife take it along with your neighbor to get along with the co-worker but if i change your nature and put a new nature in there i don't want a change that comes from an education i don't want a change that comes from being in the message i don't want to change of understanding but abraham's ministry all that is fine but the real change i want is a change in my heart because when i have to go to the rapture express it's really assessing how much you change because this mortal have to change into immortality you see that kind of change that's what i'm talking about i thank god that he doesn't change but we could change to be just like him or somebody help me this morning i thank god that he does not change but it is possible it is possible for me to change hallelujah somebody gave god a shout out praise you could change this morning you could change on being dead to being on fire you could change from being a backslider to being on the front line up you could change on being a church member to be identified in the pride you could change from being a make-believer to being a true believer you could change from an unbeliever into a son of god [Applause] you may be seated i'm almost finished you cannot make a man see the word of god till his nature has been changed that's from her but abraham and broken systems but when his nature is changed from what he is to a son of god and the holy ghost comes into him oh my that's a different man oh i want to be different i don't want to be church different i want to be had different i want to leave this service this morning and the devil said where you went what you did oh hallelujah hallelujah is not just shouting and jumping it's not just shouting and jumping listen the devil wasn't moved when they had the day of the pentecost you know but you see when peter went by the gate called beautiful and say stand up rise up on your feet silver and gold i don't have but such as i have peter had a change that he could express he had a change it wasn't a book it wasn't a tape it was not testimony it wasn't a word of encouragement it wasn't you could make it no it was a change that he could express and pass on it was power because this gospel is not in word only but it is in power and demonstration that's the change i'm talking about you may be seated you may be seated don't put anybody in a bucket because thank god we could change god could change anybody don't put nobody in a bucket don't put anybody in a bucket don't leave your children in a bucket don't show nobody outside don't write off nobody or because god to change anybody look at paul when he was saul he was persecuting the church nobody thought that that soul could ever ever be in church far less to be a messenger far less to be an apostle but god had other plans and brother saul who oversaw the stoning of stephen was the same soul when he was in a mission to do more damage god met him and that encounter with god changed saul to a man called paul and that man called paul became the messenger who wrote most of that new testament don't put anybody in a bucket i don't care who they are the same god that delivered you could deliver them the same god that helped you could help them the same god that restored you could restore them i don't care who it is if it's anybody god should have said never let him in would have been paul because he was there to kill stephen but god hallelujah he's a sovereign god and he doesn't change don't deny god his sovereignty this morning to deliver your son to deliver your daughter to deliver your wife to deliver your husband [Music] [Applause] if god said it coming then they're coming rejoice for them and it's maturity for you rejoice with them and thank god for them even if they hurt you look at the prodigal son nobody thought he was coming back home but the father in his heart said oh god i hope something changed he leave here one way i know that boy i potentially know but i hope he go through something that bring him back to his senses meanwhile in the midst of the pig pen a change has taken place and the prodigal son the bible says he came to his senses oh god thank god for somebody experiences that change us to bring us back to our senses [Applause] oh god brother pop well every interaction every experience changes us this boy who was a prodigal son he had left home one way but he went through some stuff he went through some stuff and the stuff that he went through changed him every time he ate pig food it was changing him when he looked around him and he saw it and his mind captured it he said this copyright he looked at it one day he looked at it another day he eat pig food the next day after a while these experiences added up brother clarence to a change in who he was until he mastered the courage overcame the embarrassment throw down his pride to say i will arise i will go back to my father i will say i have sinned i will say i have messed up friends you may be seated he was eating pig food for a while stuff wasn't bad enough until he had to come to his senses he was out of his own senses until he started to realize he said wait a minute not even my father's servants going through this thing here listen it's a shift in his mind he had to change from even thinking as a son friends he went back not as a son you know he went back in a servant mindset you know the courage he mustered the experience he went through changed him so much he didn't come back as a son with an entitlement of daddy i'm home enough what encouraged him is when he thought of the servants he said but wait a minute his experience changed his thinking so much he said even his servants but wait a minute if i'm not qualified to be your son but even his servants eaten better than this and that it was enough motivation he left a son and in his mind came back a servant didn't even realize that once a son you
