[23:47] feet and turn to three portions of
[23:49] scripture we want to go to the book of
[23:51] St Mark The Book of Romans and the Book
[23:54] of Revelation
[24:02] amen going uh to the book of St Mark
[24:05] chapter
[24:07] 16 Romans 8 and Revelation
[24:14] 1 reading in Mark 16 and reading from
[24:18] verse
[24:22] 1 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[24:26] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[24:28] and salomi have brought sweet spices
[24:32] that they might come and anoint him and
[24:35] very early in the morning the first day
[24:37] of the week they came unto the suula at
[24:39] the rising of the Sun and they said
[24:42] among themselves who shall roll us away
[24:44] the Stone from the door of the
[24:48] seula and when they looked they saw that
[24:50] the stone was rolled away for it was
[24:52] very great and entering into the saula
[24:55] they saw a young man sitting on the
[24:56] right side clothed in a long white
[24:58] garment and they were affrighted and he
[25:01] saith unto them be not AF frighted he
[25:03] seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[25:05] crucified he is risen he is not here
[25:07] behold the place where they laid him but
[25:10] go your way tell his disciples and Peter
[25:13] that he goeth before you into Galilee
[25:15] there shall you see him as he said unto
[25:18] you reading Romans 8 and verse
[25:23] 11 Romans 8 and:
[25:26] 11 but if the Spirit of him that raised
[25:29] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[25:32] that raised up Christ from the dead
[25:34] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[25:37] his spirit that dwelleth in you I'm
[25:40] reading Revelation chapter
[25:42] 1 reading from verse
[25:50] 12 and I turned to see the voice that
[25:53] spake with me and being turned I saw
[25:56] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[25:58] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[26:01] unto the son of man clothed with a
[26:02] garment down to the foot and C above the
[26:06] PS with a golden girdle his head and his
[26:08] hairs were white as wool as white were
[26:11] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[26:13] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[26:16] like unto fine brass as if they burn in
[26:18] a furnace and his voice as the sound of
[26:21] many Waters and he had in his right hand
[26:23] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[26:26] sharp Ted sword and his countenance was
[26:29] as the sun shine it in his strength and
[26:31] when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[26:33] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[26:36] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[26:39] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[26:41] dead and behold I am alive forever more
[26:44] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[26:47] Death Shall We bow our heads for word of
[26:50] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we
[26:52] thank you this morning for your love for
[26:54] your mercy to us Lord and any man can

[27:17] hearing of the word the speaking of the
[27:18] word may you take me completely out of
[27:21] the way and speak directly to your
[27:22] people may you use me as your instrument

[27:27] people this morning morning may the
[27:29] shout of the king be in the camp may you

[29:02] going to get the Holy Ghost he's been
[29:04] saying that you're not going to
[29:05] understand he's saying that you're a
[29:07] nobody but I have a question this

[29:12] the devil even messing with you if you
[29:14] are a nobody why are you even still
[29:16] having mind battles I say this morning
[29:19] you are a threat to the devil's Kingdom
[29:21] when you woke up this morning Satan said
[29:24] I hope this morning is not like that
[29:26] morning Satan said I hope this morning
[29:29] is not like that morning because that
[29:31] morning the devil still hasn't recovered
[29:33] from that morning brother Benjamin the
[29:36] devil still has not recovered from that
[29:38] first Easter morning and this morning I
[29:41] believe that the bride is in a position
[29:43] to have her Easter if the groom had his
[29:47] Easter brother brandom said the bride
[29:49] has to have her Easter and the groom's
[29:51] Easter suck the world for 2,000 years
[29:55] now the bride is about to have her
[29:56] Easter and it's not going to shake for
[29:59] another 2,000 years it's going to be a
[30:01] short quick message to shake the whole
[30:04] nation and all the rest of hell and
[30:06] every spirit is going to be subject to
[30:08] this bride because Christ will beeve in
[30:11] this Bride Can the church say
[30:15] Amen so I'm prophesying this morning
[30:19] there will be an Easter for the bride
[30:21] and I believe this morning that Easter
[30:24] morning there's Dawn there's light
[30:26] coming but the BR preaches rising of the
[30:28] Sun what I say this morning the sun is
[30:31] rising it's rising over you this morning
[30:34] the sun is rising over you this morning
[30:36] can the church say
[30:38] amen
[30:39] hallelujah don't worry the devil is
[30:41] already trembling it doesn't matter how
[30:44] you feel your emotions have nothing to
[30:46] do with it what your eyes see have
[30:49] nothing to do with it what you're
[30:50] feeling on the inside have nothing to do
[30:52] with it having the virus has nothing to
[30:55] do with it being sick has nothing to do
[30:58] do with it being backslid has nothing to
[31:00] do with it being dead doesn't even have
[31:03] nothing to do with it because an Easter
[31:05] morning the dead came back to life so I
[31:08] don't care if you've been dead all week
[31:11] all month all year dead since you come
[31:14] into the message dead since you're in
[31:16] church uh this morning there is power to
[31:19] raise you up uh you are not going to
[31:21] leave here on a wheelchair you're not
[31:23] going to leave here on a stretcher this
[31:25] morning the Holy Ghost is here to bring
[31:28] a resurrection in your life uh to bring
[31:30] a resurrection in your walk uh to bring
[31:32] a resurrection in your talk uh to make
[31:35] a in your house in your
[31:37] [Music]
[31:40] family oh you may be seated you got to
[31:44] help me preach this morning my throat is
[31:46] already weak but God is strong this
[31:48] morning he tell let the weak say I'm
[31:50] strong the preacher could never bring
[31:52] the Revival so I hope you brought your
[31:54] Revival this morning you may be seated
[31:57] so I'm just warming up a little bit so
[31:59] the devil send sickness to cut your life
[32:02] short he but we come against sickness
[32:05] this morning you are going to be
[32:06] reminded this morning you shall not die
[32:09] but live uh Satan could not stop Jesus
[32:12] uh death could not stop Jesus the grave
[32:16] could not stop Jesus listen Satan
[32:19] thought that Jesus was going to stay
[32:21] dead but Easter was
[32:25] coming oh somebody say
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:30] amen the mistake The Devil Makes is that
[32:33] he thinks whatever condition you're in
[32:35] you're going to stay in that condition
[32:37] it is confusing to me because the devil
[32:39] was always listening to Jesus's Services
[32:42] the devil was always trying to know
[32:44] where Jesus was going he should have
[32:46] known better because Jesus told his
[32:49] disciples I'm going to lay this body
[32:51] down and in 3 days I'm going to raise it
[32:54] up again he said destroy this Temple and
[32:56] in 3 days
[32:58] I'm going to raise it up again the devil
[33:00] should not should have known better he
[33:03] believes but he doesn't believe
[33:05] everything but this morning the devil
[33:07] doesn't even realize that what we see
[33:09] with our eyes is irrelevant the grave
[33:12] could be seen with a stone this morning
[33:15] but that stone is moving this morning
[33:18] that stone is being rolled away this
[33:20] [Applause]
[33:24] morning there will be an Easter for the
[33:26] bride there will be a bride's Revival
[33:29] and it's starting right now it's already
[33:32] started it's already on it's already
[33:35] happening if you could just get in the
[33:37] spirit if you could just get in the
[33:40] spirit and feel the rustle in the mberry
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:46] tree Hallelujah you belong to God you
[33:50] don't belong to the devil you don't
[33:52] belong to the world Satan trying to hold
[33:54] you but Satan I got news for you when
[33:57] Christ died we were in him when he died
[34:00] uh when he rose again we rose with him
[34:02] uh don't look at me right now don't look
[34:04] at me right now you better be afraid
[34:08] because my Easter is coming my Easter is

[34:24] something if you take something that
[34:26] belongs to me I'm coming to get it I'm
[34:28] speaking about myself now not anybody
[34:30] else if you take something that belongs
[34:32] to me you have a problem with me because
[34:34] I'm coming to get it back and the same
[34:37] way God is uh you touch God's anointed
[34:40] you have a problem with God he's coming
[34:42] to get it back and I don't care how far
[34:44] you have gone how low you have gone his
[34:47] hand is not too short to pull you out of
[34:50] the bar to pull you out of depression to
[34:52] pull you out of your mind battle to pull
[34:55] you out of your situation
[34:59] you may be seated he's not going to
[35:01] leave you he's not going to leave your
[35:03] family he's not going to leave your
[35:04] friends in the hands of the enemy he's
[35:07] going to take it back you don't belong
[35:09] to Satan you might be backsliding this
[35:11] morning but backsliding doesn't change
[35:14] your ownership you still belong to God
[35:17] you might be sick this morning but you
[35:19] still belong to God you might be
[35:21] defeated this morning but you still
[35:23] belong to God you might be dead like
[35:26] Lazarus but you still belong to God
[35:29] Lazarus come forth this
[35:32] [Applause]
[35:36] morning you made me seated Hallelujah
[35:41] Lazarus was dead for 4 days his body was
[35:44] already messed up and Jesus said roll
[35:47] away the stone I can't get to him if
[35:49] that stone is in front of him roll away
[35:51] the stone take away the obstacle take
[35:55] away the barrier take away the hindrance
[35:58] take away everything from in front of
[35:59] you that is hindering God reaching to
[36:02] you this morning roll away the stone
[36:04] don't roll the stone halfway don't roll
[36:07] the stone 3/4 away but roll away the
[36:09] stone roll away the stone you don't hear
[36:12] me this morning roll away the stone I
[36:15] don't know what kind of stone they had
[36:17] in Lazarus but my Bible tells me there
[36:19] was a stone that they placed in front of
[36:21] the Tomb when Jesus was buried inside
[36:24] the tomb the Bible says it was a great
[36:26] Stone
[36:30] you may be
[36:31] seated the Pharisees the statues and the
[36:34] Romans said let's put a stone in front
[36:36] of Jesus tomb because we heard a rumor
[36:38] that there there's a talk in the town
[36:40] that Jesus is going to raise from the
[36:42] dead we don't know if it's true or not
[36:44] but just to be sure we don't want to
[36:46] take chances so let's put a stone a
[36:50] great Stone historians said it took
[36:52] about 20 men to put the stone in place
[36:55] to lock the stone not only that tomb was
[36:58] down in a valley so it was not a tomb in
[37:01] front of a straight wall it was down in
[37:03] a valley so the stone was resting on a
[37:06] hole that was at an
[37:08] incline so you can just roll it along
[37:10] the axis no no no no no it was almost
[37:13] embedded on the tomb and not to take
[37:15] chances to put Gods to God the tomb the
[37:18] devil don't want to take chances for you
[37:20] to have your freedom the devil don't
[37:22] want to take chances for you to have
[37:24] your Victory so he said bring a big
[37:27] Stone a stone of condemnation a stone of
[37:30] sin weighed down by your past and he
[37:33] said put Gods put demons to block the
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:39] stone somebody help me this morning you
[37:42] may be seated but we read the scripture
[37:44] that
[37:47] morning that
[37:49] morning this very morning this is our
[37:52] spiritual birthday this morning this is
[37:55] our birthday this morning you may be
[37:57] seen it that morning
[37:59] Mary and salomi and the sisters gathered
[38:03] together and they had fate to just get
[38:07] to Jesus they knew he was dead they had
[38:11] fate to just get to Jesus they didn't
[38:13] work the whole plan out they didn't work
[38:16] the whole thing out they just packed
[38:18] their ointments they just packed their
[38:20] oils and they walk into Jesus and along
[38:23] their way to service they ask themselves
[38:26] a question who will roll away the stone
[38:29] they didn't even know how the stone was
[38:31] going to move they themselves weren't
[38:34] even convinced understand this they
[38:36] themselves who were under Jesus's
[38:38] Ministry for three and a half years they
[38:41] want to even convince that he was going
[38:43] to raised from the dead you don't get me
[38:46] this morning the very disciples that
[38:49] Jesus spoke to Peter James John they
[38:51] were in
[38:53] hiding Jesus told them in 3 days I'm
[38:56] going to raise again again those
[38:57] Brothers went into hiding it took a few
[39:00] sisters like we have some sisters this
[39:02] morning who don't care about what the
[39:04] devil says it took some sisters the
[39:06] brothers were Mia missing in
[39:12] action you may be seated the brothers
[39:15] were m a missing in action Peter wasn't
[39:19] there James wasn't there John wasn't
[39:22] there and these sisters taking their
[39:25] time coming to service every Sunday come
[39:28] to service every Thursday come to
[39:31] service they say we got to do Jesus one
[39:34] last service you may be
[39:37] seated you may be seated they came for
[39:40] their last service with Jesus you may be
[39:44] [Applause]
[39:47] seated I feel a rumble in the camp I
[39:50] feel like I can start to preach now
[39:52] brother kangali I feel like they have
[39:54] the devil on the ropes and I like when
[39:56] we have the devil on the ropes because
[39:58] whenever you get him on the ropes all
[40:00] you got to do is keep
[40:03] punching
[40:08] keep just don't
[40:13] stop don't stop we got him on the ropes
[40:16] this
[40:17] morning you may be seated so those
[40:21] sisters they had enough Hai this was
[40:24] going to be their last service with
[40:26] Jesus because they didn't know what was
[40:28] going to happen next according to Jewish
[40:31] tradition sisters are not supposed to
[40:33] anoint the bodies it was supposed to be
[40:36] brothers supposed to be the males in the
[40:38] family traditionally to anoint the
[40:40] bodies but the brothers were nowhere
[40:43] around God help us find the brothers who
[40:46] could take their place in the church and
[40:48] begin to call for fire but that's
[40:50] another service so these sisters they
[40:53] brought the ointment they brought the
[40:55] oil but they had a big problem because
[40:58] as far as they understood there was a
[41:00] great Stone the Bible says in front of
[41:03] the Tomb and the only question they had
[41:06] is who will move this stone for ush they
[41:10] knew their strength couldn't move it
[41:12] they know they didn't have enough people
[41:13] to move it but they said who will move
[41:16] this stone for us
[41:19] [Applause]
[41:30] hallelujah
[41:32] hallelujah
[41:34] hallelujah
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:37] hallelujah but I love this
[41:40] gospel I love this gospel and the enemy
[41:43] has put a lot of stones in our
[41:46] lives a lot of
[41:48] obstacles a lot of
[41:50] barriers all of the barers of your past
[41:52] of your mind battles of different
[41:54] situations heal barriers family barriers
[41:58] people on the job different situations
[42:00] to just prevent you from getting to
[42:02] Jesus but as these women draw closer
[42:06] they made a discovery like we are going
[42:08] to make this morning that the stone was
[42:10] already rolled away what they have been
[42:13] trying to move for all this time was
[42:15] already rolled away what they were
[42:17] trying to move had already been rolled
[42:20] away so you have a question this morning
[42:23] Who Will Roll Away Your Stone I say this
[42:25] morning that same Jesus
[42:27] he is still in the Stone Rolling
[42:31] business he is still in the Stone
[42:33] Rolling business you may be
[42:41] seated I asked myself the question who
[42:43] was the first witness on Easter
[42:48] morning and the first witness of the
[42:50] resurrected Christ was that stone
[42:54] [Music]
[42:57] woo because when Jesus rose from the
[43:00] dead that stone began to tremble because
[43:04] the stone at the builders
[43:06] rejected had become The Headstone of the
[43:09] corner you can't lock up the Chief
[43:12] Cornerstone you can't lock up this Jesus
[43:15] that stone knew its
[43:18] place I wasn't there when the stone
[43:20] rolled away but the one thing I know
[43:22] when Jesus began to move towards the
[43:24] stone the stone recognize its maker the
[43:27] stone recognized God the stone
[43:30] recognized listen many people have been
[43:33] crucified before but this was a
[43:35] different kind of testimony this was the
[43:37] first one who got back up after he was
[43:40] knocked
[43:42] down because God knew that there were
[43:44] going to be hundreds of people thousands
[43:47] of people who would come later on who
[43:49] would get knocked down but they will
[43:51] share the same testimony they're going
[43:53] to get back up
[43:57] [Applause]
[44:07] Hallelujah and I left my notes
[44:09] [Music]
[44:12] already so this morning I don't care
[44:14] what condition you
[44:16] in whether you consider yourself as bad
[44:18] as lazaros or worse like the valley of
[44:20] dry
[44:22] bones that just had no life I see this
[44:24] morning these bones are going to live
[44:26] again amen the calebs that are on the
[44:29] edge saying I've been in this thing for
[44:30] so long I lost my joy I lost my Zeal
[44:34] will God ever answer my prayer can these
[44:36] bones
[44:38] live and I say this morning these bones
[44:41] are going to get some some some muscle
[44:43] and some flesh and some skin and the
[44:46] breath of life is going to come into
[44:48] your house into your Christian walk
[44:51] until it becomes so tangible it becomes
[44:53] so real that backsliding is no longer an
[44:57] option that the world is no longer an
[44:59] option that what the world has to offer
[45:01] is no longer an option can the church
[45:04] say Amen hatred had a beginning and will
[45:07] have an ending sickness had a beginning
[45:10] and will have an ending doubt had a
[45:13] beginning and will have an ending fear
[45:15] had a beginning and will have an ending
[45:18] nervousness had a beginning and will
[45:20] have an ending sin had a beginning and
[45:23] will have an ended Satan had a beginning
[45:26] and will have an ending but you you
[45:28] never had a beginning because you were
[45:31] always in God you were always part of
[45:34] God before there was a moon before there
[45:37] was a star before there was a molecule
[45:39] before the foundation of the world you
[45:42] were in God's thoughts and you can't
[45:44] fail because God can't
[45:48] fail you are going to have a testimony
[45:51] you may be seated we spend so much time
[45:54] brother Steven preaching about Samson
[45:56] and pre about Daniel and preaching about
[45:58] all of them and they are looking down
[46:00] saying I can't wait to hear your
[46:02] testimony how you made it in
[46:04] 2015 when all hell was against you when
[46:07] the internet was against you when the
[46:09] school system is against you with all
[46:11] the drugs and the pornography and the
[46:14] music and the movies and the Styles and
[46:17] the passion and this and that and you
[46:19] made it
[46:23] [Applause]
[46:26] [Music]
[46:29] so we are not afraid this morning from a
[46:31] message of restoration of the Bride tree
[46:34] but the ROM said Easter is the
[46:35] resurrection restoring to restore back
[46:38] it's God's restoring time you look out
[46:41] over the Earth God is restoring
[46:43] restoring what nature that's right he's
[46:45] restoring the flowers he's restoring the
[46:47] leaves he's restoring the fruits of the
[46:50] field what is it God is restoring it's
[46:52] Easter it means to bring it back and we
[46:55] have power here this morning to enforce
[46:58] give it back
[47:01] Satan what is it enforcing give it back
[47:04] restore it bring it back to its right
[47:07] owner and if Satan listen has robbed you
[47:10] of the
[47:11] privilege of being a son or daughter of
[47:14] God we have a right this morning by the
[47:18] Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God
[47:22] to bring them back do you believe it
[47:24] this morning there's a law of life you
[47:27] God put a law of life in the birds they
[47:29] can't help but
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:32] fly God put a law of life in the fish
[47:35] they can't help but swim and in the
[47:37] Christian in the bride he put a law of
[47:40] life of the spirit and when the season
[47:42] comes and when the time comes when the
[47:45] moment comes it's time to say give it
[47:48] back and down will come charity down
[47:50] will come the Holy Ghost oh I feel
[47:52] religious this morning I feel excited
[47:55] this morning to know all that and I lost
[47:58] I'm going to get it
[47:59] back somebody say
[48:05] Amen
[48:07] hallu so Easter is all about
[48:10] Jesus it's all about
[48:13] Jesus it's not about us it's all about
[48:16] it's all about
[48:18] Jesus and the Bible tells the story of
[48:22] when Day Jesus was so tired he was so
[48:24] wary from preaching from teaching
[48:27] that all the virtue had left him and I
[48:30] shared this with the young people all
[48:32] his strength had left him and it's very
[48:34] almost difficult to understand how
[48:36] almighty God could be so physically weak
[48:39] but he was subject to the same things
[48:41] that we are sometimes subjected to amen
[48:45] he went through the same emotional
[48:48] roller coaster so to speak that that we
[48:51] go through and Jesus was so weak the
[48:53] Bible said that They Carried Jesus into
[48:57] the boat and that word carry was to
[48:59] physically carry so I want you to
[49:01] picture the same Jesus that walked on
[49:03] water here he is being physically lifted
[49:07] into the boat as some of us sometimes we
[49:09] need something somebody to just Lift us
[49:11] up a little bit amen and it's important
[49:13] to have the right people around you who
[49:15] could give you the right words of
[49:17] encouragement sometimes there are lot of
[49:20] other people who like to delve in the
[49:22] negativity and why don't you go and
[49:24] drink and why don't you go and party and
[49:26] why don't don't you go and do this but
[49:28] but these brothers they looked Jesus and
[49:30] took him into the boat because just
[49:32] before I guess he was just too tired as
[49:34] py say I I have to go to the other side
[49:37] and he didn't understand what he was
[49:39] talking about but these brothers were so
[49:40] obedient that they just responded to his
[49:43] need that he had to go to the other side
[49:47] and Jesus is so tired he falls asleep on
[49:50] the boat and brother bam said that the
[49:52] devil took the opportunity to try to
[49:54] wipe him out
[49:57] raise up a big storm and here it is
[49:59] Jesus in the boat and he is so tired
[50:01] he's so weary that the winds don't wake
[50:04] him up and the and the waves don't wake
[50:07] him up and the screams of the brothers
[50:09] don't wake him up and these were
[50:12] experienced fishermen they were not used
[50:14] to going over on that other side because
[50:16] that side were where the heathens were
[50:18] but just being obedient they did the
[50:20] best they could to salvage the situation
[50:22] until somebody said let's let's wake up
[50:25] Jesus let's let's get Jesus involved in
[50:28] the situation and they woke Jesus and
[50:30] Jesus turned to his disciples and say oh
[50:32] ye of little fate and he rebuked the
[50:34] storm and say peace be still and Jesus
[50:37] went back to sleep and they asked
[50:39] themselves a question what manner of man
[50:41] is
[50:43] this that even the wind and the Seas
[50:47] obey him and Jesus went back to sleep
[50:49] because he was still tired but the power
[50:51] was still in Jesus and Jesus what he did
[50:55] was just he had to do that but he was on
[50:57] a destination yes sir because on the
[51:00] other side there was somebody on the
[51:03] other side yes
[51:05] sir there was somebody living on the
[51:08] other side he didn't have the
[51:09] opportunity to hear Jesus or see Jesus
[51:12] or speak to Jesus so almighty God saw it
[51:15] fit to send Jesus to
[51:19] him and the Bible says that this man was
[51:22] living in
[51:23] tombs he wasn't living in a house he
[51:26] wasn't living in a tent he wasn't living
[51:27] in a cottage he was living in tombs and
[51:30] he was tormented by demons he was
[51:32] tormented by Spirits the Bible call the
[51:36] spirits that were upon Him
[51:38] Legion but when Jesus stepped out of the
[51:41] boat and this man saw Jesus the Bible
[51:44] says he bow down to
[51:50] worship and that's a powerful mystery
[51:52] right there friends because all of the
[51:55] demons in him could not stop the
[51:59] seed that was in his
[52:03] soul it was not the spirits that were
[52:05] upon him that was worshiping but there
[52:07] was a seed in his soul that recognized
[52:10] the
[52:12] master and all the filed was in his life
[52:16] for that moment when he saw Jesus he
[52:18] fell down to
[52:20] worship because as much as the devil
[52:23] attacks your mind and attacks your body
[52:25] your soul has has a sign on it that says
[52:27] access
[52:29] denied access denied I heard about a
[52:32] country preaching in that he said no
[52:34] matter what mind battle the devil bring
[52:37] to your mind what sickness he brings to
[52:39] your body on your soul is written access
[52:42] denied he can touch he can touch your
[52:45] soul you are predestinated to receive
[52:49] the Holy
[52:52] Ghost you may be seated and because
[52:55] there's a Eed in your
[52:57] soul how your hair is right now doesn't
[53:01] really matter the clothes you have on
[53:03] this man didn't even have on clothes the
[53:05] Bible says but the seed and his soul
[53:08] connected to the great
[53:13] Creator and without Jesus speaking a
[53:16] word Jesus life was so powerful that the
[53:19] demons upon that man said why have you
[53:21] come to torment
[53:25] us why have you come to bother us and
[53:28] those demons made a request to send them
[53:30] into the pigs and Jesus cast these
[53:32] demons out into the
[53:34] pigs and those pigs ran into the sea and
[53:37] that man listen you know what the Bible
[53:39] says he went and put on
[53:43] clothes so when you see people ling a
[53:45] wet
[53:52] clothes because soon the spirits left
[53:55] him he ran and got some cloes
[53:58] CL and the people Marvel is this the
[54:01] same man it used to take a whole bunch
[54:03] of people to hold this man but is this
[54:05] the same man and this man began to
[54:08] testify in fact he wanted to go with
[54:10] Jesus but Jesus said no you testify to
[54:12] your family testify to your neighbors
[54:14] testify to your friends and listen
[54:17] listen the people in that area were so
[54:20] upset with Jesus because they used to
[54:22] raise
[54:24] pigs and when Jesus put the spirit in
[54:27] the pigs and the pigs ran into the sea
[54:28] they said Jesus killed their whole
[54:30] business and they ran Jesus out the
[54:33] tongue but Jesus wasn't concerned about
[54:34] that he was concerned about the
[54:36] predestinated seed that one soul that
[54:40] had a seed inside of that soul and God
[54:43] is going to hunt you down he will find
[54:45] you wherever you are wherever there's a
[54:48] predestinated
[54:50] seed because the devil cannot touch your
[54:53] soul
[55:02] [Applause]
[55:03] somebody say Amen am that's why the
[55:06] devil's only Power is your family and
[55:09] your mind and who said this and you get
[55:11] Disturbed and you get thrown out the
[55:12] spirit and you Fe to come to church and
[55:15] you're just frustrated and is your
[55:16] husband and is your wife that have
[55:18] nothing to do with your
[55:22] soul you have to become Vigilant about
[55:25] your purpose until nothing moves you you
[55:28] have to begin to separate what's natural
[55:31] from what is spiritual but for you to do
[55:34] that you have to roll away the stone of
[55:37] all the stuff that you have in your life
[55:39] that does not belong there and you have
[55:40] to be vigilant about
[55:42] it brutal about it from this day on
[55:47] nothing will hinder my walk with
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:53] God from this day forward not friend not
[55:57] family not job not relationship husband
[56:00] wife no husband no wife bad husband Good
[56:04] [Applause]
[56:06] Wife nothing will separate you from the
[56:09] love of God can the church say
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:18] Amen talking about Jesus hallelujah what
[56:22] manner of man is this he was a man when
[56:24] he was Weeping at the grave of life
[56:26] Lazarus but when he said Lazarus come
[56:29] forth he was Hallelujah he was more than
[56:32] a man he was a man when he was looking
[56:34] for something to eat and he saw the Fig
[56:36] Tree had no fruit but he was more than
[56:38] man when he took Five Loaves and two
[56:41] fishes and Hallelujah F 5,000 but the B
[56:45] said what kind of God is that who could
[56:46] take cooked fish break it and make
[56:49] cooked
[56:50] fish bypass the
[56:53] oven take cooked bread break it and make
[56:57] Coke bread just like the first Coke
[57:02] bread he was a man when he was hungry
[57:04] but when he was breaking I I wish I was
[57:07] in that
[57:09] day you imagine all the businessmen all
[57:11] the bakery owners today wish they could
[57:14] see that when he could just make bread
[57:16] on demand like that but that was more
[57:19] than
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:20] [Music]
[57:22] man
[57:24] hallu God that was more than a man that
[57:27] was God but the B said he was a man when
[57:29] he was tacked at the cross that's right
[57:33] as a sacrifice to take away sin
[57:36] Hallelujah he was a man when they drove
[57:38] the nails into his hand he was a man
[57:40] with thorns over his head he was a man
[57:44] that mockery Soldier spit on him he was
[57:46] a man was bruised and stripped and
[57:48] wounded he was a man when he cried my
[57:51] God why hast Thou forsaken me he was a
[57:54] man crying for help but Easter morning
[57:57] when the seals of death broke loose at
[57:59] the tomb that was more than man he
[58:02] proved that he was God can the church
[58:06] say
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:09] Amen why had to be Shepherd but the bom
[58:11] said no wonder the mountains jumped and
[58:14] shouted on that day no wonder the sun
[58:17] hid its face and screamed for Joy no
[58:19] wonder all NAA broke loose the wind
[58:22] shook the trees until they shook and
[58:24] Shook and joyed and and jump they seen
[58:27] the prophet Shepherd on the mountain
[58:29] redeem every name on The Book of Life
[58:31] they seen their own nature was redeemed
[58:34] they scream and jump and the world went
[58:36] into an earthquake and the mountains
[58:38] rent and the Rocks fell out and the sun
[58:40] went down and everything PL took place
[58:43] can the church say Amen the moon turned
[58:45] to blood
[58:49] everything amen
[58:52] hallelujah thank you Jesus and that
[58:55] Mighty con
[58:58] went down into Satan's
[59:02] headquarters to get something from the
[59:05] devil because Abraham and Ezekiel and
[59:09] Daniel and they were all locked up in
[59:11] Paradise Beau all waiting for somebody
[59:15] to come and get them
[59:16] out so Jesus went down and interrupted
[59:19] the devil's
[59:21] celebration because the devil thought
[59:23] that Jesus was dead and finally the
[59:25] greatest problem
[59:26] ever had was
[59:29] finished when Jesus said it is finished
[59:31] the devil say yes
[59:34] finished and then there's a knock on the
[59:37] door and Jesus comes down and not only
[59:39] he comes to get all those who are locked
[59:42] in Paradise because he took the keys of
[59:45] death and
[59:47] hell not just death alone you know he
[59:50] took the keys to hell which mean the
[59:52] devil is running around in hell and he
[59:53] don't even have his own keys right
[59:56] [Music]
[59:56] [Applause]
[1:00:05] so you know people tell me ask how how
[1:00:08] how are you doing whether I living in
[1:00:09] Hell or no well don't worry Jesus got
[1:00:11] the keys that's it he could unlock you
[1:00:13] this morning I don't care what kind of
[1:00:15] hell you're going through this morning
[1:00:17] Jesus took the keys of death and hell so
[1:00:21] death has no power over you and hell has
[1:00:24] no power over you because Jesus took the
[1:00:27] keys he can let out who he wants to let
[1:00:30] out and this morning the house of hell
[1:00:33] has got to give way to the name of Jesus
[1:00:36] you have got to go free because all the
[1:00:39] doors are unlocked this morning all of
[1:00:42] the doors are open this morning and you
[1:00:44] could go free if you want to go free you
[1:00:47] could shout if you want to shout you
[1:00:49] could worship if you want to worship you
[1:00:52] can say hallelujah if you want to say
[1:00:54] hallelujah you can have Revival if you
[1:00:57] want to have a Revival you can have joy
[1:01:00] if you want to have joy because there's
[1:01:02] nothing stopping you there is nothing
[1:01:04] against you there is nothing against
[1:01:07] that Joseph Perfection seed I don't care
[1:01:10] what your flesh did I don't care what
[1:01:12] your mindset that seed inside of you is
[1:01:15] perfect this morning and there's no hell
[1:01:17] could hold you no demon could hold you
[1:01:20] no sickness could hold you no depression
[1:01:22] could hold you no problem could hold you
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:35] Hallelujah can the church say amen and
[1:01:38] the mighty conqueror he rose with the
[1:01:42] keys of death and hell and roll away the
[1:01:44] stone and stepped out and he left an
[1:01:47] angel there to testify so that when
[1:01:49] people come looking for him the angel
[1:01:51] could say why are you looking for the
[1:01:53] living among the Dead God is not dead he
[1:01:57] is not here look at where you laid him
[1:01:59] God left an angel to point to look at
[1:02:02] the evidence yeah he was
[1:02:05] here but he's not here no more and
[1:02:08] you're going to have the same testimony
[1:02:10] you were backslid but you're not backing
[1:02:13] no more look at the drugs you left look
[1:02:16] at the clothes you left look at the
[1:02:18] friends you left look at the problems
[1:02:21] you left yeah he was here but he's not
[1:02:24] here no more he's ra from the death he
[1:02:28] has a new life he has a new walk he has
[1:02:30] a new talk he has a new inspiration he
[1:02:33] has a new anointed and you can't kill
[1:02:36] him again because he already rose from
[1:02:38] the
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:44] dead can the church say
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:49] hallelujah amen amen amen so Christ the
[1:02:52] word has been placed into your heart
[1:02:55] that's right and Satan has tried to
[1:02:57] block the life in you from being lived
[1:02:59] out just like he tried to block Jesus
[1:03:02] try to bind the word with denominational
[1:03:05] Stones try to bind the word with all
[1:03:08] kinds of stones and the question was
[1:03:10] asked by this woman who would roll away
[1:03:12] the stone and Jesus himself he break
[1:03:16] that seal to uncover what was there to
[1:03:19] show you that there's life beyond the
[1:03:21] river to show you that there's hope to
[1:03:24] show you that after this there's
[1:03:26] something else and we ought to check up
[1:03:28] ourselves to ensure our destination the
[1:03:32] world wants you to think that this is
[1:03:33] your home and this is your destination
[1:03:36] and to have a plan for your future but
[1:03:38] this natural world doesn't hold your
[1:03:40] future your future belongs to God your
[1:03:43] future is belonging to the Heavenly
[1:03:46] places can the church say
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:52] amen blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:03:55] this morning there will be an Easter for
[1:03:58] the bride amen prom but the B said in a
[1:04:01] message the restoration of the Bride
[1:04:03] tree now all the bugs that hell could
[1:04:05] turn loose in her will never stop her
[1:04:07] talking about this bride no communism
[1:04:10] Catholicism no nothing else will stop it
[1:04:13] I will restore sayth the Lord all the
[1:04:16] man-made Roman trees will never hang it
[1:04:19] there all the graves will never keep it
[1:04:21] there all the big denominational Stones
[1:04:24] laying at the door will will never keep
[1:04:26] it there I will restore say the Lord
[1:04:29] there will be an Easter I'll bring forth
[1:04:32] the same church in its same power it
[1:04:35] I'll bring that bride out just like she
[1:04:37] was back there with the same signs the
[1:04:40] same fruits the same things that they
[1:04:42] did I'll bring her back again I will
[1:04:44] restore say the Lord can the church say
[1:04:47] amen amen
[1:04:50] amen and this is where I got my
[1:04:52] inspiration this morning from the same
[1:04:54] message but B said I'll send forth the
[1:04:56] evening light and it'll bring back the
[1:04:58] word making it manifest I will restore
[1:05:01] all that I've promised all that I've
[1:05:03] promised the same holy spirit will bring
[1:05:06] and bear the same signs I'll have an
[1:05:08] Easter a resurrection for the bride the
[1:05:11] same as I had for the bridegroom can the
[1:05:15] church say
[1:05:17] amen and brother brand said the
[1:05:19] resurrection was proof that scripture
[1:05:21] was fulfilled about Jesus yes sir amen
[1:05:24] amen because when you really study
[1:05:26] the story of Jesus up until that time
[1:05:28] not even the disciples really truly
[1:05:30] believed him but when Jesus rose from
[1:05:33] the dead their faith became
[1:05:37] anointed Peter had Faith he said bid me
[1:05:39] to come and he walked on the water that
[1:05:40] took Faith but when Jesus rose from the
[1:05:43] dead his resurrection Ministry anointed
[1:05:46] their fith yes sir to a fate that was
[1:05:49] not like the original feet this was
[1:05:52] seven Thunder anointed Resurrection feet
[1:05:56] and that is the faith that drove them to
[1:05:58] the upper room waiting for the promise
[1:06:01] to be manifest so I pray this Easter
[1:06:03] your faith becomes anointed by this
[1:06:06] message of Malachi 4 that has brought
[1:06:09] back evidence that he is not dead but he
[1:06:12] is the same yesterday he is the same
[1:06:15] today he is the same forever and he has
[1:06:18] the same power that he had back there
[1:06:20] can the church see
[1:06:23] amen I'm not going to be too much longer
[1:06:25] with you amen praise God from the
[1:06:28] message it is the rising of the sun I
[1:06:30] just want to nail this down here but the
[1:06:34] B said no matter how much theologians
[1:06:36] claim how well you got your church set
[1:06:41] how much education you got how much like
[1:06:44] the Bible until that wave sheath until
[1:06:48] listen the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[1:06:51] person to Quicken that word the gasoline
[1:06:56] represents the word is the truth but
[1:06:58] without the spirit it won't move the
[1:07:01] Bram said we have put too much stress on
[1:07:04] the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic
[1:07:07] that's right he said it takes the
[1:07:09] dynamic power of God the resurrection
[1:07:12] power of Jesus Christ upon the church to
[1:07:15] manifest it and bring to pass that this
[1:07:18] is
[1:07:19] gasoline so brother BR is saying all the
[1:07:22] word that you hear every service is
[1:07:24] gasoline
[1:07:26] but the only way to prove that it's
[1:07:29] gasoline is to light a
[1:07:33] match right now brother the band said
[1:07:35] every Church saying they have
[1:07:39] gasoline every Church saying they have
[1:07:42] word as gasoline which is
[1:07:44] mechanics but it takes a spark
[1:07:47] Hallelujah it takes the spirit to put
[1:07:51] the match on it light it a fire and when
[1:07:55] that catches a fire then you know that
[1:07:58] you know that you know that is really
[1:08:02] gasoline we're getting to something now
[1:08:05] so listen butam typed it like this he
[1:08:08] said Jesus was a fulfillment of
[1:08:09] scripture that's right but the Jews were
[1:08:12] used to prophets used to Miracles used
[1:08:15] to all of this but the proof that he was
[1:08:17] Messiah was when he rose from the dead
[1:08:21] that was when the matches hit the
[1:08:23] gasoline and the fire exploded then that
[1:08:27] was proof there was no doubt there was
[1:08:29] no question there was no debate and
[1:08:32] there's coming a moment when God himself
[1:08:35] will strike the match in this
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:39] church and all the word you've been
[1:08:41] hearing all these years
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:47] will will catch a fire and then you're
[1:08:50] going to see a a prize Revival then
[1:08:52] you're going to see a seven tunder
[1:08:54] Revival because what will it be
[1:08:56] mechanics and Dynamics together can the
[1:08:59] church say
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:05] Amen so right now everybody in the
[1:09:08] message is debating on
[1:09:11] gasoline is a gasoline debate un Leed
[1:09:19] super how much
[1:09:22] impurities what's in the gasoline the
[1:09:25] makeup of the gasoline that's the debate
[1:09:26] that's what brother Bram said he said
[1:09:28] that's it but there's coming a proving
[1:09:32] time so you have to make sure you have
[1:09:34] the right
[1:09:37] gasoline in the gas store you get super
[1:09:40] and un leted but here we talking about
[1:09:42] is pure
[1:09:43] gasoline the whole the whole concept of
[1:09:45] un Le is to take the lead out take the
[1:09:47] impurities out right but when we come to
[1:09:49] this kind of Holy Ghost gasoline there's
[1:09:52] no impurity because it has to be the
[1:09:54] word
[1:09:55] self so that when the matches strikes
[1:09:59] because if you have impurities in there
[1:10:01] when the match strike it could burn out
[1:10:03] but when it's a real thing it keeps on
[1:10:04] burning all the way to your Redemption
[1:10:07] can the church say Amen is that why we
[1:10:11] spend so much time trying to nail down
[1:10:13] the word listen in the Pentecostal
[1:10:16] church you can sit down and just say
[1:10:17] jump jump shout shout raise your hand
[1:10:19] and then go back home you know and
[1:10:20] there's no word there when Dynamics
[1:10:22] strike it only bring up what's there
[1:10:24] which is not much that's amen amen so we
[1:10:28] it took a prophet to come and restore
[1:10:31] tie up all the Loose
[1:10:32] Ends every
[1:10:35] mystery amen so that we can have the
[1:10:38] fullness of the word and the fullness of
[1:10:41] the word restored is the mechanics we
[1:10:43] are contending for to connect with
[1:10:46] Dynamics because he is the
[1:10:48] Dynamics can the church say amen and the
[1:10:51] Christ which is the spirit and Dynamics
[1:10:53] he wants to unite with you and create an
[1:10:56] explosion can the church say
[1:11:00] Amen is that striking home this morning
[1:11:03] and that will be the Easter for the
[1:11:05] bride yes sir that will be the bride's
[1:11:07] Revival so what are we doing all these
[1:11:09] Services cleaning out the church tying
[1:11:13] up the Loose Ends rolling away the stone
[1:11:17] so that there's no hindrance there's no
[1:11:19] obstacle in your life in your heart no
[1:11:22] ought butam said if there's one ought
[1:11:26] one some of us holding Millions all
[1:11:29] against your school teacher all against
[1:11:30] your brother all against the man who a
[1:11:32] bad drive all against this that all
[1:11:35] over and brother if you have one ought
[1:11:38] in your heart against listen a saint or
[1:11:41] a
[1:11:44] sinner that's a serious reuk know
[1:11:46] because you have those who who love just

[1:13:43] be an Easter for the bride and every
[1:13:46] word that's why every loose end will be
[1:13:49] tied up because God is coming for a
[1:13:52] bride not for a church church is for
[1:13:54] church members
[1:13:55] there are many churches this morning but
[1:13:57] Bride is a different thing Al together
[1:14:00] bride is people who could take the word
[1:14:02] and apply to them to their Liv without
[1:14:05] hesitation without fear without favor
[1:14:08] without thought of what the consequence
[1:14:11] is because they want to live the word
[1:14:13] they love to hear the word they want to
[1:14:15] read the word they want to be in the
[1:14:17] word they don't want to come to church
[1:14:19] they want to be word prde they want to
[1:14:21] live word word word word word because
[1:14:23] that's gasoline gasoline
[1:14:25] because one day God is
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] coming spark spark spark fire fire
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:34] fire can the church say amen amen real
[1:14:39] bride not fake bride real bride can the
[1:14:41] church say amen
[1:14:43] amen the brandom said there's been
[1:14:45] churches churches Brides brides churches
[1:14:47] Brides brides but there's got to come
[1:14:49] one Hallelujah there's to come a real
[1:14:52] prde there must come one that that's not
[1:14:55] only God the mechanics but the Dynamics
[1:14:57] of it makes the church live move in what
[1:15:00] the power of his resurrection amen amen
[1:15:05] amen until we come to that place until
[1:15:09] we find that place what good does it do
[1:15:11] to polish the
[1:15:14] hubs no matter how much the mechanics
[1:15:17] prove to be right there has got to be
[1:15:19] Dynamics to make it work brother bam
[1:15:23] said that is what he proved
[1:15:25] that's what Easter proved he wasn't only
[1:15:28] the word but he was God himself the
[1:15:31] Dynamics in the word that made the body
[1:15:34] of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in
[1:15:36] the grave Shake into life and rise again
[1:15:39] and roll away the stone amen amen I am
[1:15:42] he that was dead so dead Till The Sun
[1:15:44] said he was dead the moon said he was
[1:15:47] dead the Stars said he was dead all
[1:15:49] nature said he was dead and now the
[1:15:51] whole world has to recognize that he's
[1:15:53] alive again he was not only the
[1:15:55] mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics
[1:15:58] to prove it
[1:15:59] amen am just a few more cours and I'm
[1:16:02] done and as he being the groom the bride
[1:16:05] has to come forth because it's a part of
[1:16:08] him and it can only be the manifestation
[1:16:11] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:16:14] any others have spoke of the Bride In
[1:16:17] other words if it does something
[1:16:19] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:16:21] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:16:25] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:16:28] of his power she is him as man and woman
[1:16:32] are one the woman taken from his side
[1:16:35] she has taken on the feminist Spirit
[1:16:37] from him Hallelujah brother BR went on
[1:16:39] he said if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[1:16:42] will the
[1:16:43] pride because whatever he did the pride
[1:16:45] must
[1:16:46] do the power he had the pride must have
[1:16:50] the same Works he did the pride must do
[1:16:53] the same signs wonders miracles The
[1:16:55] Pride must do so get ready get ready get
[1:16:58] ready because Greater Works than these
[1:17:00] shall you do that's what you are called
[1:17:02] to do there will be an Easter for the
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:09] pride
[1:17:11] Hallelujah last quote on this but random
[1:17:14] said it just won't move no matter how
[1:17:16] good the mechanics is no matter how good
[1:17:18] the preaching is no matter how good the
[1:17:20] teaching is no matter how good you know
[1:17:21] the word until the Dynamics comes when
[1:17:24] the dyn dams come that fire is made to
[1:17:26] connect with that octane in the gasoline
[1:17:29] and when that explodes it causes a
[1:17:32] combustion and that combustion moves
[1:17:34] every motion every move for he's the
[1:17:36] same yesterday today and forever that's
[1:17:38] the resurrection somebody's say Amen so
[1:17:42] when you see somebody jumping and
[1:17:43] shouting in the spirit they having a
[1:17:45] little Revival because there's a little
[1:17:47] spark that's coming to the gasoline in
[1:17:49] them but one day there's the great
[1:17:52] Dynamics will come to the entire bride
[1:17:54] and we'll have a super church we'll have
[1:17:56] a Revival you won't be able to sit down
[1:17:58] in church and put your hands like this
[1:18:01] no you'll be jumping you'll be shouting
[1:18:03] you'll
[1:18:05] be you can help yourself why because
[1:18:09] it'll be power it'll be fire it'll be
[1:18:12] the Holy Ghost in action in The Bride
[1:18:14] Can the church say
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:20] Amen so this morning the bride there
[1:18:22] will be an Easter for the bride
[1:18:25] just as Jesus proved scripture the bride
[1:18:28] will also prove scripture because she
[1:18:31] will be a continuation of the word and
[1:18:34] every single scripture that is left to
[1:18:36] be fulfilled is the bride's
[1:18:40] Ministry because with this bride all
[1:18:43] will be
[1:18:44] completed everything is to be fulfilled
[1:18:47] in this bride all will be fulfilled in
[1:18:50] you so if you don't want to believe it

[1:21:54] Jesus Christ the
[1:21:57] resurrected Christ and these signs shall
[1:22:00] follow them that believe right now we
[1:22:03] have the mechanics but by prophecy the
[1:22:06] Dynamics is here to produce seven Living
[1:22:09] Voices not just voices laying dormant
[1:22:12] but living moving vibrating so there's
[1:22:15] no more excuses this morning the word is

[1:23:00] Perfection by his word Jesus Christ just
[1:23:03] as justification made a way for
[1:23:05] sanctification and sanctification made a
[1:23:08] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a
[1:23:12] way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:23:14] down in Perfection back to the word
[1:23:16] because God will have a perfect church
[1:23:18] that will be the Easter for the bride a
[1:23:21] perfect Church in action listen what's a
[1:23:23] perfect Church there'll be no mistakes
[1:23:25] in the
[1:23:28] church that's powerful brother bam spoke

[1:23:50] a church that was in order and God will
[1:23:52] have that kind of church some of you may
[1:23:55] not make it into that kind of church
[1:23:56] that's the truth but God will have those
[1:23:58] who would live in that kind of
[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:01] church a church where sin cannot stay in
[1:24:04] it can the church say Amen every word
[1:24:08] from the pulpit will come from God every
[1:24:11] word will be directed by God because
[1:24:13] it'll be God speaking God veiled once
[1:24:16] more behind human
[1:24:18] skin right now all the ministers are all
[1:24:21] mechanics waiting for Dynamics but when
[1:24:24] the spirit for to the denam is come then
[1:24:26] you will see who is Pastor and who is
[1:24:27] Apostle and who is teacher and who is
[1:24:29] evangelist amen you wait till the denam
[1:24:31] is come to operate what's in the church
[1:24:34] and then you will see sin called out in
[1:24:37] the
[1:24:38] church people want to come to church and
[1:24:40] do what they want and sit in the church
[1:24:42] when that time comes sin will be called
[1:24:44] out it'll be another book of Acts that
[1:24:46] will be an Easter for the
[1:24:49] bride back to ananas and you have lied
[1:24:52] to the Holy Ghost amen
[1:24:54] drop dead in the church amen because
[1:24:58] it'll be Jesus Christ operating his
[1:25:00] church can the church say amen amen amen
[1:25:05] so we are in Harvest time we are in
[1:25:07] another Easter the spirit must bring
[1:25:09] forth the potential in the seed you may
[1:25:11] not have the Holy Ghost yet but you are
[1:25:13] going to get the Holy Ghost you are not
[1:25:15] healed yet but you are going to see your
[1:25:17] healing because you were already healed
[1:25:19] waiting just for the manifestation of it
[1:25:22] and in this harest time the the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost must be manifested in you any day
[1:25:27] now what are we looking for a short
[1:25:29] quick message to shake the whole nation
[1:25:32] can the church say Amen but this is a
[1:25:35] secret
[1:25:36] friends the rain cannot fall before it's
[1:25:39] time
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:44] right it has to fall in its
[1:25:47] season we don't have the seasons like in
[1:25:50] the temperate countries where there is
[1:25:52] summer and fall and winter
[1:25:56] but you cannot have Easter in
[1:25:58] summertime you can't have Easter in Fall
[1:26:02] Easter could only happen after
[1:26:05] winter so after summer then there's fall
[1:26:08] and all of the leaves fall of the tree
[1:26:10] then you go to the winter period the
[1:26:11] cold period a dry period Hallelujah you
[1:26:14] can't move as you want to in the winter
[1:26:16] because it's cold it's dry all the life
[1:26:19] leaves the leaves and all the fruit
[1:26:21] dries up and everything life comes down
[1:26:23] into the root amen
[1:26:25] you could call for sunlight and call for
[1:26:27] life but if you're in the winter you got
[1:26:29] to wait till winter is
[1:26:31] over it can happen before it season but
[1:26:35] when the season changes and the leaves
[1:26:39] begin to get back their life and the
[1:26:41] rising of the sun takes place and the
[1:26:43] snow begins to melt and the season comes
[1:26:46] around and there's another Easter then
[1:26:49] listen everything that looked Dead all
[1:26:52] the trees that lost their leaves all the
[1:26:54] trees that lost their fruit all of the
[1:26:56] trees that just looked as if there was
[1:26:58] no life then all of a sudden the life
[1:27:00] come back and there's a resurrection
[1:27:03] because there's an Easter and this whole
[1:27:04] world has gone
[1:27:06] through all of these seasons and we are
[1:27:10] listen we are at the end of winter
[1:27:13] breaking into our Easter can the church
[1:27:16] say Amen all these years that Alpha
[1:27:20] Church died and went into the ground and
[1:27:22] all these years has been going through
[1:27:25] something going through something but
[1:27:27] this morning I see the rising of the sun
[1:27:30] I see the bride coming into Power I see
[1:27:32] the young people coming to know who they
[1:27:35] are can the church say Amen am musan
[1:27:38] begin to play something I'm closing out
[1:27:41] GL
[1:27:43] Glory Hallelujah
[1:27:46] Hallelujah final quote brother B in the
[1:27:49] message who is this says something had
[1:27:51] to take place because a living Christ
[1:27:55] was amongst a living people something
[1:27:58] had to take place the coming of the Holy
[1:28:00] Ghost in This last days has caused
[1:28:03] somewhat a like manner stir amongst the
[1:28:05] people of the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:08] in these last days has sent forth a
[1:28:10] Revival a people that's called out
[1:28:14] separated a people that's free in their
[1:28:16] religion that shout and screams the
[1:28:18] Praises of God that believes in signs
[1:28:20] and wonders Hallelujah and the religious
[1:28:22] world looks on and say what's the matter
[1:28:24] with them people who is this what's
[1:28:27] causing this or might I say what is this
[1:28:31] what is this that causes this if they
[1:28:33] would only read the scriptures they
[1:28:35] would find out that it's the spirit of
[1:28:37] Christ promised by God that in the last
[1:28:40] days I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:28:42] Flesh and there'll be a latter rain a
[1:28:45] rain of the spirit of God falling upon
[1:28:48] the people in the last day and he said
[1:28:51] there'll be a latter rain and a former
[1:28:52] rain in the same time so this morning I
