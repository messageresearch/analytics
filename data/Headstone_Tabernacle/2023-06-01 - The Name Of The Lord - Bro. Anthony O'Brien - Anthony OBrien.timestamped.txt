[26:35] for the songs tonight we certainly
[26:37] appreciate the musicians amen so God
[26:38] bless you
[26:39] amen so let's just turn to our Bibles
[26:41] now we like to change your order to
[26:43] service
[26:44] amen and we have just two portion of
[26:47] scriptures we like to read first from
[26:49] proverbs
[26:50] chapter 18.
[26:52] and just one verse in there
[26:54] for context for a title and Saint Luke
[26:58] chapter 10 for context for subject
[27:02] tonight amen so Proverbs chapter 18
[27:06] verse 10.
[27:08] it says the name of the Lord is a strong
[27:12] tower
[27:13] the righteous runeth into it and is safe
[27:17] amen until over now to Saint Luke
[27:19] chapter 10.
[27:21] amen
[27:22] just
[27:23] if you could raise a monitor brother uh
[27:26] man that'd be great amen thank you Saint
[27:30] Luke chapter 10
[27:31] reading from verse 17.
[27:34] and it says and the 70 returned again
[27:36] with Joy saying Lord
[27:40] even the devils are subject unto us
[27:43] through thy name
[27:45] and he said unto them I beheld Satan
[27:49] as lightning fall from Heaven
[27:52] behold I give you power to tread upon
[27:56] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[28:00] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[28:04] any means hurt you
[28:06] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[28:09] that the spirits are subject unto you
[28:13] but rather Rejoice because your names
[28:16] are written in heaven
[28:19] and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the
[28:22] spirit
[28:23] and said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[28:28] Heaven and Earth
[28:29] that thou has hid these things from the
[28:32] wise and prudent and has revealed them
[28:35] unto babes even so father for it seemed
[28:40] good in thy sight may God have blessing
[28:43] to the reading of his word let us bow
[28:45] our hands
[28:47] almighty God we thank you for your word
[28:49] tonight Lord
[28:50] your word that has lasted from
[28:53] generation unto generation father
[28:56] and here we stand tonight on this same
[28:58] word Lord Lord you are never changing so
[29:03] father we thank you Lord that Lord we
[29:05] can rest our hearts and our faith upon
[29:07] you tonight
[29:09] Lord we pray now that you take the same
[29:11] word Lord
[29:12] that has kept the prophets of older kept
[29:15] every saint of God throughout all the
[29:17] ages
[29:18] father in your word tonight also as we
[29:21] hide behind it Lord and as we look to
[29:24] see what you will speak to us tonight
[29:26] Lord we just bow ourselves before your
[29:29] throne of grace Lord we pray that you
[29:31] open your word to us and bless us Lord
[29:33] pour your spirit down upon us and
[29:36] breathe life in the word father and Lord
[29:39] may it satisfy our needs oh God may you
[29:42] answer every question in our heart Lord
[29:44] may you bless our lives with more of you
[29:46] tonight as we wait upon you take charge
[29:48] in this service tonight we pray that you
[29:50] have your waived us for a few moments in
[29:53] Jesus name we pray and ask it amen and
[29:56] amen please the Lord amen you have your
[29:58] seats tonight praise God
[30:06] amen well Sydney feels good in here
[30:09] tonight and praise God
[30:12] certainly appreciate the Lord
[30:15] amen so just for us uh title tonight
[30:19] amen from our scripture reading
[30:22] I choose for a title the name of the
[30:25] Lord
[30:26] and for a subject I chose your name is
[30:30] written in heaven
[30:31] amen and so um I was just thinking on
[30:35] these things
[30:36] and um you know I was asking the Lord
[30:39] what to come tonight to say
[30:41] and I was thinking about a long time and
[30:43] I had a lot of Inspirations written down
[30:45] but it just didn't get a witness back
[30:46] from it
[30:47] and I just kept praying like that and
[30:50] all of a sudden God like he just spoke
[30:52] to me and told me but I give it to you
[30:54] already
[30:55] so um so it was almost like a why cry
[30:58] speak moment and I went back to
[31:01] something I wrote down
[31:03] and then the last convenience service
[31:05] and we had plenty tape on brother
[31:07] Branham
[31:09] um and I and the spirit just
[31:12] dropped on me like that and began to
[31:13] give me this word so I just wrote run
[31:16] down real quick down by the bathroom and
[31:18] I wrote it down the whole message and I
[31:21] actually didn't know I'd forgotten I'd
[31:22] done it so here was a few weeks later
[31:25] and God is bringing back to my
[31:26] remembrance all these things amen praise
[31:28] God so uh it it's not me praise God Amen
[31:32] I I is what he just gave me in in the in
[31:35] the moment
[31:36] and so he reminded me of these things
[31:38] and when I went back through it I just
[31:41] felt that it was right so amen so that's
[31:43] what I have tonight amen the name of the
[31:47] law
[31:47] are you happy tonight
[31:50] so we know that everything in this world
[31:51] has a name
[31:53] it's not right you have a name
[31:55] I have a name
[31:57] most of us are born into we were born
[31:59] into our family
[32:01] we are all given a name
[32:04] a family name
[32:05] and then you have a a given name isn't
[32:08] that right
[32:09] but the most important name is the name
[32:12] you make for yourself
[32:14] like to say Amen it's not right because
[32:17] behind every name
[32:19] there's a spirit
[32:20] behind every name there's a personality
[32:23] that's why naming children is such an
[32:27] important thing because there's a spirit
[32:29] behind that
[32:31] and that when you speak that name you're
[32:33] actually pronouncing a blessing over
[32:36] that child or over that person
[32:42] give your children Bible names pronounce
[32:45] a blessing over them amen that that
[32:48] comes from the Lord there's a testimony
[32:51] behind the names amen it's not
[32:54] old-fashioned it's the truth amen and um
[32:58] we ought to be careful what we name
[33:01] things it's not right
[33:03] naming is very important and so there's
[33:05] a spirit and a life behind a name
[33:08] a name
[33:10] takes a form of an identity
[33:12] if you name something isn't that right
[33:15] so if we call someone by name if we call
[33:18] you by name by your name your full name
[33:22] and you know sometimes mothers like to
[33:24] call their children by their full name
[33:26] you know that that's a lot of trouble
[33:28] amen
[33:30] full name middle name included
[33:33] you know they usually they're addressing
[33:36] a specific somebody
[33:38] isn't that right so because Mama doesn't
[33:40] want to miss she calls you by your full
[33:43] name so you know exactly who she's
[33:46] calling
[33:47] isn't that right and when someone calls
[33:51] your name you can't help but respond to
[33:54] it
[33:55] because that is your name you know that
[33:58] they're not speaking to the person next
[34:00] to you you're not speaking to the person
[34:02] in front or somebody behind you know
[34:05] that it is you that they are speaking to
[34:07] if they call someone else's name then
[34:10] that's someone else's response but when
[34:13] they call yawning you are responsible
[34:17] for responding to your name because that
[34:20] name belongs to you isn't that right
[34:23] hallelujah hallelujah and the book that
[34:26] God has in heaven is a book of names
[34:30] isn't that right it's a book of names
[34:33] and that book has many names the names
[34:37] of all of the men and women that would
[34:39] walk the earth God knows them all by
[34:43] their names and he knows your name
[34:46] tonight it's not by accident it is not
[34:50] by chance that you are living the life
[34:53] that you are living tonight it is
[34:55] because you have a name and God knows
[34:59] your name tonight he knows who you are
[35:02] and he knows where you are tonight he
[35:06] knows how you feel he knows the
[35:09] individual experiences that you are
[35:11] having right now in this instance of
[35:15] time that you are living in God knows
[35:18] the end from the beginning and he knows
[35:21] what name that you are going to pick up
[35:23] when you drop down here on Earth oh
[35:27] Hallelujah not right that's why when he
[35:30] come down he could call Abraham he could
[35:33] call Abram by name and he said come out
[35:36] from among your people and be separate
[35:39] say it gone walk unto me walk before me
[35:43] and be therefore perfect oh that's why
[35:47] he could come down and speak to Jacob
[35:49] and speak to Isaac and speak to Ephraim
[35:53] and speak to this one isn't that right
[35:54] he knows them all by their names and you
[35:59] have a name tonight oh Hallelujah do you
[36:02] believe it your name is not leaving your
[36:05] name is not John Jones but the mystery
[36:08] of what this book is while it is calling
[36:12] those names oh hallelujah hallelujah
[36:16] hallelujah glory to God so a name
[36:20] is a very important thing
[36:23] it identifies someone
[36:26] isn't that right and every soul is
[36:28] precious to God
[36:30] isn't that rhyme a name represents a
[36:33] life a person
[36:35] spirit
[36:36] is
[36:37] so appreciated brother Gideon's Ovid
[36:41] service on The Last Cry
[36:43] amen was a real inspiration
[36:46] and on that message he was talking about
[36:50] Samson and he said that how Samson had a
[36:53] name that was feared
[36:56] when the name Samson was proclaimed
[36:59] there was a certain reputation
[37:02] that went behind that name
[37:04] the enemy know what to expect when they
[37:08] hear the name Samson is coming through
[37:10] all you had to do was mutter the word
[37:13] Samson and that had a certain feeling
[37:16] behind that it had a certain energy
[37:19] behind that oh hello isn't that right
[37:22] when you name the name Abraham oh the
[37:26] father of Faith oh hallah isn't that
[37:28] right who stood for God who built an
[37:31] altar who was the sacrifice his son but
[37:35] the Lord provided for him a sacrifice oh
[37:38] Hallelujah and he called that place
[37:40] Jehovah oh hallelujah hallelujah when
[37:43] the name Abraham was spoken you know who
[37:46] he was talking about when you say in the
[37:49] name Jacob when you name the name Joseph
[37:52] when you name the name Isaac you know
[37:55] who you was talking about but tonight we
[37:58] want to talk about the name that is
[38:01] above every other name when God came
[38:05] down and he spoke to his people he said
[38:08] I am the god of your fathers Abraham I
[38:12] am the god of Isaac and I am the god of
[38:15] Jacob in other words the same God that
[38:18] walked with Abraham
[38:20] and call them out of his people out of
[38:23] his nation and separated him is the same
[38:26] quarter was upon Isaac oh Allah who got
[38:29] for him a wife who is the same God I was
[38:32] upon Jacob oh wrestle all night long and
[38:36] overcame and when he overcame God gave
[38:41] him a new name oh he renounced the old
[38:44] name and he gave him a name called
[38:47] Israel oh because he overcome with god
[38:51] oh and he was a prince with God and when
[38:55] God dropped down he said I am the god of
[38:58] Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the
[39:01] god of Jacob I am the god of Joseph I am
[39:05] the god I was with Moses when I parted
[39:08] the Red Sea I was the god I was with
[39:11] Moses when I spoke flies into existence
[39:14] when he spoke frogs into existence that
[39:17] same God is here tonight that same God
[39:20] made his witness with men and women on
[39:23] the earth who walked like you did who
[39:26] talk like you did who had failures like
[39:29] who did who had shortcomings like you
[39:31] did but that chord was made Mighty in
[39:35] their weakness he was made strong and if
[39:38] God could do that for them tonight then
[39:41] God could do the same for you I believe
[39:44] in all my heart oh
[39:47] hallelujah hallelujah somebody speak
[39:50] back to me tonight
[39:52] Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah
[39:56] so there is a name
[39:58] that is above every other name
[40:02] and that name is fulfilled
[40:05] every expectation of that of that name
[40:09] isn't that right
[40:10] that name Jesus is able to fulfill every
[40:14] expectation of that name
[40:17] in other words because Jesus Is A Healer
[40:20] when we speak the name Jesus
[40:23] there is healing because he is a Healer
[40:26] and that is what his name means oh
[40:29] Hallelujah because he is able to do it
[40:31] because he is able to accomplish it
[40:33] because he has done it before he can do
[40:36] it again I know he can do it again
[40:39] because his name is the same
[40:42] oh Hallelujah and there's power behind
[40:46] that name there's a certain expectation
[40:48] behind that name when we speak the name
[40:52] Jesus demons start to get edgy they're
[40:55] starting at Unseen they start to get
[40:58] troubled they say you come to torment us
[41:00] before time because they're scared of
[41:04] that name Jesus oh
[41:08] oh one of these Glorious Days God is
[41:11] going to put his name into a pride and
[41:14] she's gonna have to say the Lord she's
[41:17] gonna speak and it'll flash like
[41:20] lightning oh Hallelujah
[41:27] because Jesus is a deliverer
[41:30] when we speak the name Jesus
[41:33] there's Deliverance
[41:34] amen because Jesus is the light
[41:38] when we speak the name Jesus Darkness
[41:41] has to flee
[41:43] because Jesus is a Shepherd when we
[41:46] speak the name Jesus I shall not want oh
[41:50] Hall is not right oh Hallelujah he
[41:53] leaded me beside the paths of
[41:55] righteousness for his name's sake oh
[41:59] Hallelujah he leaded me beside the Still
[42:02] Waters because his name o Hallelujah is
[42:05] a refresher his name always an oasis in
[42:09] the desert doesn't matter what you're
[42:11] going through his name represents
[42:13] something Supernatural all the men that
[42:16] walk this hurts couldn't do what Jesus
[42:19] did all the men that came around in
[42:22] their tail couldn't amount to what Jesus
[42:25] did for you and I oh and he made a name
[42:28] for himself oh a name in heaven and a
[42:31] name on the earth oh hallelujah
[42:34] hallelujah when you speak that name
[42:36] Darkness knows where to go because that
[42:39] name has a light with it when you speak
[42:41] that name sickness knows where to go
[42:44] because he is a mighty healer when you
[42:47] speak that name the devil knows where to
[42:49] go oh Hallelujah because he has the key
[42:52] of death of hell and the grave oh
[42:57] Hallelujah in his name
[43:00] There Is Power
[43:02] in that name isn't that right
[43:04] Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd I
[43:07] shall not want Psalms 23. he maketh me
[43:10] to lie down and Green Pastures he
[43:13] leadeth me beside The Still Waters he

[43:21] paths of righteousness what for his
[43:25] namesake
[43:26] oh Hallelujah he does it for his
[43:29] namesake amen I believe it was her
[43:32] precious brother maduka who was
[43:35] preaching one time in one of the
[43:37] conventions we had and in the past and
[43:39] he was saying that if a company if a
[43:42] businessman has a name then what he has
[43:46] is his reputation to protect he has a
[43:50] reputation at stake therefore for the
[43:53] cause of his name he will do things
[43:56] because his name his reputation is at
[44:00] stake he doesn't want no one saying bad
[44:02] things about his name he doesn't want
[44:05] anyone tarnishing his reputation so
[44:08] therefore his product has to be perfect
[44:10] every single time and if someone has a
[44:13] complaint about the product he will be
[44:15] quick to reimburse he'll be quick to fix
[44:18] a problem why is he doing it for his
[44:21] name's sake and if God made a promise if
[44:25] natural man would try to protect his
[44:28] name then God has an obligation tonight
[44:31] to protect his name and when you were
[44:35] thought of on his mind he wrote your
[44:38] name down in the Book of Life oh
[44:41] Hallelujah he swore by himself that he
[44:44] would bring you out and for his name's
[44:47] sake he would move mountains for you he
[44:50] would take you out he would break the
[44:53] back of the enemy he would wrote
[44:55] righteousness or for his name's sake he
[44:59] would move mountains tonight because he
[45:01] loves you and because he has elected you
[45:04] because the king projected his love to
[45:08] you Sovereign Grace took over oh
[45:11] Hallelujah and he claimed you to himself
[45:15] for his name's sake
[45:18] whoa Hallelujah he said you have not
[45:21] chosen me
[45:22] but I have chosen you and because he
[45:25] chose you he put his reputation on the
[45:28] line therefore God is obligated to meet
[45:33] you on the basis of every promise that
[45:36] he made because his name is at stake
[45:40] he's got to meet you on the basis of the
[45:43] promised World he's obligated to meet
[45:46] you on it all you have to do is say Lord
[45:50] you made a promise and if you don't
[45:53] bring your promise a pass then you'd
[45:55] have told a lie but God is not a liar
[45:58] God is not a man that he will lie when
[46:01] God makes a promise he keeps his promise
[46:04] and if God promised a heal you tonight
[46:06] he's going to heal you if God promised
[46:09] to deliver you he's going to deliver you
[46:11] there are not enough temples in this
[46:13] universe to stop God from delivering you
[46:15] if he promised her to do it he's going
[46:18] to make a way somebody say Amen
[46:22] somebody say Amen
[46:24] oh hallelujah
[46:27] oh glorial God

[48:33] man what's fixing to take place oh
[48:36] brother oh sister there's coming a time
[48:39] when the sick cannot stay sick when the
[48:42] blind cannot say blind when the
[48:45] cannot say because Jesus that
[48:48] name that is above every other name is
[48:51] gonna step into 16 elements and he's
[48:55] gonna walk again he's gonna talk again
[48:57] oh Hallelujah I believe it
[49:02] do you believe it tonight
[49:05] Philippians 2
[49:07] verse 5.
[49:09] Apostle Paul says let me let this mind
[49:12] be in you
[49:13] which was also in Christ Jesus
[49:16] who being in the form of God
[49:18] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[49:20] God
[49:22] but made himself
[49:24] of no reputation this man Jesus
[49:27] this is what he lived
[49:29] this these words here is what he
[49:31] vibrated oh Hallelujah this is what made
[49:34] the devil so sick oh Hallelujah because
[49:36] king after King and potentate of the
[49:39] potentate and ruler after ruler but
[49:42] never was there a man that walk like
[49:44] this man Jesus never was there man that
[49:48] lived like this man Jesus isn't that
[49:50] right and if we name our name there's a
[49:53] spirit behind our name my brother
[49:54] Branham said of the spirit of Ludwig van
[49:57] Beethoven amen it was in me I would do
[50:01] what he did I would write songs I would
[50:04] write it is not right for I'd be
[50:06] inspired if that Spirit living me if I
[50:10] had a spirit of Don Dillinger I'd be an
[50:12] outlaw he said isn't that right but if I
[50:15] had the spirits of the same Jesus inside
[50:18] of me then the same works that he did
[50:21] you shall do also if that same spirit
[50:25] that raised Christ from the dead dwells
[50:29] in you you it will Quicken your mortal
[50:32] body you you can't be the same anymore
[50:35] all of a sudden the devil that had you
[50:38] bound that you are running from they
[50:41] will be running from you because of the
[50:44] Jesus that is in your soul or somebody
[50:47] say Amen oh
[50:50] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[50:53] because when Jesus is around the dead
[50:56] cannot stay dead when Jesus is around
[50:59] there's always a noise about him abroad
[51:02] oh they went out of Fame about him
[51:04] around the region round about that Jesus
[51:08] was passing this way and anytime Jesus
[51:11] is passing this way there's an
[51:13] expectation if you are sick all of a
[51:16] sudden in the midst of a dead life in
[51:19] the midst of a life filled with sickness
[51:21] all of a sudden light Springs up and you
[51:25] get hope because the man that could heal
[51:28] sickness the man that could heal
[51:30] diseases is walking through the aisles
[51:32] tonight oh I wonder if that same Jesus
[51:36] From Galilee tonight was to walk through
[51:39] these Isles what would be your
[51:41] expectation what do you have me to do
[51:44] for you oh
[51:46] oh what would be your answer tonight oh
[51:50] Hallelujah
[51:52] my
[51:53] it's an expectation isn't that right
[51:56] so he said
[51:59] he made himself of
[52:01] no reputation
[52:03] and took upon him the form
[52:06] of a servant
[52:07] he was the high and lofty one
[52:10] who created all things
[52:12] yet he
[52:13] took the form
[52:16] servant
[52:18] said let the greatest among you
[52:20] let him be your servant
[52:22] that's really the key friends
[52:24] it's not about what you can get
[52:27] it's about what you can give
[52:29] it's not
[52:31] oh my God wants true Silvers in this end
[52:34] time I generally believe that
[52:35] if God's Gonna raise up a faithful
[52:37] Ministry
[52:38] by his spirit
[52:40] and they have to be servants
[52:42] because Jesus said a servant is no
[52:45] greater than his Lord
[52:47] therefore if I wash your feet then so
[52:50] much you do likewise to your own
[52:52] brothers and if I forgive you then so
[52:55] much you also forgive them that trespass
[52:57] against you them that speak evil against
[53:00] you be kind that isn't that right amen
[53:04] no we give evil for evil oh but do good
[53:07] oh father isn't that right if your
[53:09] brother asks you'll go on my I'll go to
[53:11] with him live the life that Christ live
[53:14] isn't that right Hallelujah that's what
[53:16] we're called to do we're called to be
[53:18] servants oh Hallelujah to serve God's
[53:21] people amen amen there's a reward praise
[53:24] God for God servants isn't that right
[53:27] it was made in the likeness of man still
[53:29] reading the scripture here and being
[53:31] found in a passion as a man he humbled
[53:34] himself
[53:35] and became obedient unto death
[53:38] even the death of the Cross wherefore
[53:42] God also had highly exalted him
[53:46] and given him a name which is above
[53:50] every name oh that at the name of Jesus
[53:54] every knee should bow of things in
[53:58] heaven and things in Earth and
[54:01] everything under the Earth and that
[54:04] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[54:07] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[54:12] Father oh Hallelujah that's the name
[54:15] that I am praising tonight that's a name
[54:19] that we cry out when we're in trouble
[54:22] don't be afraid to cry out the name
[54:25] Jesus to call Upon Jesus oh he is able
[54:30] to answer your cry he can hear your
[54:33] prayer tonight anything that you have
[54:36] need of he is able to provide Jesus can
[54:40] provide it Jesus can help me Jesus alone
[54:44] God likes to bring situations in your
[54:47] life where you know that you cannot make
[54:51] it on your own you know that you can't
[54:54] fix this because the more you try to fix
[54:57] it is the worse it gets when you're
[55:00] gonna turn over when are you gonna give
[55:03] up when are you gonna give yourself over
[55:05] to Jesus let him fix the broken things
[55:09] in your life in your marriage in your
[55:14] walk in your talk how long are you gonna
[55:17] make circles in the deserts oh come on
[55:19] tonight there is a fountain filled with
[55:22] blood tonight drawn from Emmanuel's
[55:26] veins where Sinners plunge beneath that
[55:29] flood lose all their guilty stains Jesus
[55:33] is here to help you tonight in ways that
[55:36] I can't do your mother couldn't do it
[55:39] your father can't do it but I know Jesus
[55:43] he can do it tonight whatever you have
[55:46] need of don't just listen to me tonight
[55:48] but call Upon Jesus
[55:53] he is waiting
[55:55] to hear your cry
[55:58] oh Hallelujah
[56:00] yeah
[56:04] Oh Glory
[56:06] one time
[56:08] we had come from a Victory Heights Camp
[56:09] I think
[56:11] and it was a really Victorious One
[56:14] I came back home and I was wary
[56:16] but I was happy
[56:18] we had a great time in the lawn
[56:21] and I remember falling asleep
[56:24] and
[56:25] I felt like a dream because the room got
[56:27] dark
[56:28] and evil and the presence came inside
[56:32] and it felt I could want to wrestle me
[56:34] while I was on the bed
[56:36] and I was fighting up with it
[56:38] and all of a sudden something spoke in
[56:40] my ear and said why don't you call on
[56:42] Jesus
[56:44] and as I said Jesus help me
[56:47] the power that was holding me down
[56:50] smashing down billion pieces
[56:52] scattered across the room
[56:54] and then I woke up moments after
[56:57] and I felt a peace come in the room
[56:59] praise God it's not the name of Jesus
[57:03] there's power in that name
[57:06] to do stuff that you can't do
[57:08] when it's too much for you it's not too
[57:12] much for Jesus
[57:13] when you can make it on your own
[57:16] Jesus can help you
[57:18] Jesus alone oh hallelujah hallelujah
[57:21] hallelujah this is not just something
[57:23] I'm talking about it's something you
[57:25] have to experience for yourself that
[57:28] when you cry out the name Jesus he comes
[57:31] to your rescue oh he always hears a
[57:35] desperate cry call upon the name of the
[57:38] Lord tonight
[57:39] and so shall you be saved amen amen from
[57:43] your distress it's not right
[57:46] it's nine
[57:48] praise God

[1:02:02] he means
[1:02:04] so much to me
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:14] can I preach a little bit
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:18] oh my
[1:02:19] in the beginning when God created The
[1:02:21] World God spoke he said let there be
[1:02:23] light isn't that right
[1:02:25] and then the next thing he did
[1:02:27] was he separated a light from the
[1:02:29] darkness
[1:02:30] and then the next thing he did
[1:02:32] was the name Delight
[1:02:35] because God is into this
[1:02:37] naming thing
[1:02:38] he's been doing it a long time
[1:02:41] when he created a world
[1:02:43] he began to name things
[1:02:46] because that is how
[1:02:48] God shows his authority over something
[1:02:51] when he gives it a name
[1:02:54] and when Adam had Authority on the earth
[1:02:56] he had the ability
[1:02:58] to name the things around him and
[1:03:01] whatever name he gave it
[1:03:03] was the name thereof The Authority was
[1:03:06] signed
[1:03:07] on on on on unretractable isn't it
[1:03:10] undoable it was all irrevocable isn't
[1:03:14] that right it was already spoken
[1:03:17] so shall it be
[1:03:19] it's not I was the authority
[1:03:21] I was being expressed in Adam
[1:03:24] from God it's not right oh my God's
[1:03:27] gonna have a people like that one more
[1:03:28] time
[1:03:29] oh Hallelujah they're gonna be walking
[1:03:32] into hospital rooms and stuff that the
[1:03:35] doctors can't figure out these
[1:03:37] Supernatural intelligence will drop down
[1:03:39] and say thou foul Spirits you've been
[1:03:42] here these past 15 years I cast you out
[1:03:47] don't know about you'll be naming them
[1:03:50] you'll be calling them I said get out
[1:03:52] get up and move the authority is on the
[1:03:56] earth now I charge you Hallelujah isn't
[1:03:59] that right the authority will be in the
[1:04:01] pride to speak and you create itself
[1:04:03] just like that
[1:04:04] and so the prophet said isn't that right
[1:04:07] that same Authority it's going to come
[1:04:09] upon a bride amen amen oh my see so he
[1:04:14] named the light
[1:04:15] call it like d
[1:04:17] ude and he called The Darkness night
[1:04:21] give it a name
[1:04:23] so
[1:04:24] from since that time
[1:04:26] we know that it takes light
[1:04:29] to declare the day it's not right it
[1:04:32] takes light and what is the light the
[1:04:34] prophet said the light is actually the
[1:04:35] Vindicated word of God to declare the
[1:04:38] day that we are actually living in
[1:04:41] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:44] uh Jesus said on that day you shall know
[1:04:46] Saint John 14 18. he said I will not
[1:04:49] leave you comfortless but I will come to
[1:04:52] you and yet a little while and the world
[1:04:55] see at me no more but you are going to
[1:04:58] see me and because I live you shall live
[1:05:02] also and at that day you shall know that
[1:05:06] I am in my father ye and me and I knew
[1:05:10] what day that's this day and what
[1:05:14] declares are they the light and the
[1:05:17] light is a Vindicated word or declaring
[1:05:20] the day that you are living in isn't
[1:05:23] that right oh Hallelujah II Peter 1 he
[1:05:25] said uh verse 19 he said we also have a
[1:05:29] more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye
[1:05:33] do well that you take heed as unto a
[1:05:36] light that shineth in a dark place until
[1:05:40] the day Dawn and the Daystar arise in
[1:05:44] your hearts who is that day sir jsus the
[1:05:49] son of the Living God arising in your
[1:05:51] hearts arise and in power arise in an

[1:06:01] Dawn and until the day star arise in
[1:06:04] your hearts oh isn't that right
[1:06:08] the Bible says arise and shine for thy
[1:06:11] light has come because gross Darkness

[1:06:16] stools cross Darkness cover everywhere
[1:06:18] cover politics cover the Genesis comma
[1:06:22] children with all kind of satanic
[1:06:25] sodomite Spirits running loose upon the
[1:06:28] Earth but God promised to lift up your
[1:06:31] heads that there shall be light oh
[1:06:35] Hallelujah arise and shine for thy light
[1:06:38] has come oh that though there be
[1:06:40] darkness in the world will there be
[1:06:42] darkness in the politics though there be
[1:06:44] darkness in the governments do there be
[1:06:46] Darkness on the streets and everywhere
[1:06:48] god promise that you are gonna have
[1:06:51] light he said the Gentiles shall come to
[1:06:53] thy light oh hallelujah hallelujah

[1:07:08] to under stand that your name is written
[1:07:11] in the Lamb's Book of Life you're gonna
[1:07:14] understand that it's not about the works
[1:07:16] lest any man should post but it's about
[1:07:19] the power it's about the predestination
[1:07:21] or that he's put inside of your soul
[1:07:24] that's the only reason you made it out
[1:07:27] the devil is a liar tonight he told you

[1:08:17] any private interpretation
[1:08:20] for the prophecy came not an old time by
[1:08:22] the will of man
[1:08:24] but holy man
[1:08:25] of God speak as they were moved by the
[1:08:29] Holy Ghost
[1:08:31] the light for our day
[1:08:33] has a name
[1:08:34] it's not right the Vindicated word of
[1:08:37] God in Noah's day was the life of his
[1:08:39] day when he said it will rain that was
[1:08:42] the word for his day which represented a
[1:08:45] light for his day that way he was
[1:08:47] walking in our Vindicated light for that
[1:08:49] day oh Hallelujah to walk not in that

[1:08:58] about 120 years and only eight Souls

[1:09:06] the rest perish and darkness oh because
[1:09:09] I received not the light isn't that

[1:09:17] day let the uh Let My People Go isn't
[1:09:21] that right that was the light for his
[1:09:24] day to not be in Goshen to not walk in

[1:09:30] be under plagues is to be on the famine

[1:11:48] at a singular time at a singular event
[1:11:51] and a singular instance oh Hallelujah
[1:11:54] and God knew that time and the season
[1:11:56] that he was supposed to appear to marry
[1:11:58] Mary herself didn't even know who she
[1:12:00] was she was just walking around learning

[1:17:54] the Earth in the natural lights he said
[1:17:56] no matter how much artificial light that
[1:17:59] we can have
[1:18:00] how much great electric Rays we can
[1:18:02] produce yeah it is Big spotlights they
[1:18:05] have when they're doing construction in
[1:18:06] the night always look at atena
[1:18:09] you're driving down the road and
[1:18:10] sometimes they have these construction
[1:18:11] things up
[1:18:12] the big China big life is a huge
[1:18:14] halogenberg I guess they call it
[1:18:16] and it's so bright sometimes you can
[1:18:17] feel a heat from it and he said wow it's
[1:18:19] almost like daytime you know
[1:18:21] but when the real light comes out
[1:18:24] when a real sun come up well that bulb
[1:18:27] is a joke
[1:18:29] they want nothing on the real light and
[1:18:32] that's what goes uh ghost Prophet is
[1:18:34] talking about here
[1:18:35] said that light not how many electric
[1:18:37] Rays we can produce when that sun rises
[1:18:41] all the rest of them came out oh holiday
[1:18:44] I said and that's the same thing it is
[1:18:46] with the word of God
[1:18:49] he said when the word of God arises all
[1:18:53] superstitions denominational fanaticisms
[1:18:56] and things they spread away and it just
[1:19:00] shows up exactly what it is
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] shall proceed no further when the real
[1:19:08] light comes up oh brother give me a
[1:19:11] church full of the Holy Ghost God's
[1:19:13] Gonna raise up the real Pentecostal
[1:19:15] lights and when that light strikes the
[1:19:17] Earth One More Time all these
[1:19:20] denominational schisms and all these
[1:19:22] isms will fade away when God fails
[1:19:26] himself in a bride on earth oh brother
[1:19:29] there's coming a real Revival brother
[1:19:31] that's coming a real stirring the bride
[1:19:34] hasn't had a stir in the edge but he
[1:19:36] said it will take these seven unknown
[1:19:39] Thunders to wake her up again he will
[1:19:43] send it he promises oh and I believe it
[1:19:47] and that settles it tonight I could
[1:19:50] praise God on that one I could shout on
[1:19:52] that one I could dance on that one I've
[1:19:55] got a victory what is it faith is a
[1:19:58] victory that overcomes the world oh
[1:20:00] faith in God's word faith in what he
[1:20:03] said not the one a man thinks
[1:20:06] but just take it as as he says
[1:20:09] if he says he'll heal you
[1:20:11] he is of no private interpretation
[1:20:14] take it just the way he said it isn't
[1:20:17] that right Professor always said that
[1:20:20] and I heard a preacher say one time he
[1:20:22] said the word of God has to be enough
[1:20:25] for you
[1:20:26] it has to be enough enough for you to
[1:20:28] sustain you he said if it's not enough
[1:20:31] for you you will go look in for other
[1:20:33] deceptions you'll go looking for other
[1:20:35] gospels you will have itching ears
[1:20:38] looking for other knowledge looking for
[1:20:40] some new mystery or some new thing to
[1:20:43] excite you but when the word of God is
[1:20:46] enough for you you don't need the
[1:20:48] devil's lie you don't need the devil's
[1:20:51] tricks all you need is God's word that
[1:20:54] satisfies the long and hearts that
[1:20:57] satisfies the thirsting soul
[1:20:59] that's what I want tonight I hope that's
[1:21:02] what you want tonight
[1:21:05] but if I don't always talk about that
[1:21:06] day when the day is weak and wounded
[1:21:09] I'm being chased by the wolf
[1:21:11] when the day is low
[1:21:13] and running out of battery and he needs
[1:21:15] a recharge
[1:21:17] Barbara said there's some glands in the
[1:21:19] hoof of that of that day
[1:21:21] anytime they touch water
[1:21:23] something happens
[1:21:25] to them physically they get an energy
[1:21:28] they never had before they gotta
[1:21:30] recharge every time they drink water
[1:21:32] real water I'm not talking about Blue
[1:21:34] Waters water
[1:21:36] soft drink can't give you this kind of
[1:21:38] buzz
[1:21:39] Minute Maid not ready for this we're
[1:21:42] talking about God's water we're talking
[1:21:44] about Adam's ale we're talking about the
[1:21:46] real deal when that hit the deer
[1:21:49] something else takes place and brother
[1:21:51] nothing this world could produce can
[1:21:53] ever satisfy the long and hearts and The
[1:21:57] Thirst and soul the real believer who
[1:22:00] wants a real Revival she is looking for
[1:22:03] it brother he is looking for it brother
[1:22:05] he is looking for a real Revival in his
[1:22:08] soul something that satisfies the long
[1:22:11] and hearts something that answers the
[1:22:13] question that is in his soul something
[1:22:15] that revives something that heals
[1:22:18] something that delivers something that
[1:22:20] restores
[1:22:22] only God could do that
[1:22:24] only God could transform
[1:22:26] a disfigured life
[1:22:28] isn't that right
[1:22:30] prison try to transform people and the
[1:22:33] best they come up with is reform
[1:22:35] they try to reform people into society
[1:22:38] and make you fit to walk back out those
[1:22:41] prison doors again they have tried and
[1:22:44] they've failed because sometimes some
[1:22:46] people go into prison and come back out
[1:22:47] worse than when they went in prison
[1:22:50] could only do so much the systems can
[1:22:53] only do so much but only God has the
[1:22:56] power to transform he's in the
[1:22:59] transforming business whatever however
[1:23:01] disfigured you are God could take your
[1:23:04] life and change it over and make
[1:23:07] something better out of it he is the
[1:23:09] Potter tonight you are just declare
[1:23:12] don't try to be the Potter you can make
[1:23:15] yourself the Bible says it's not we that
[1:23:18] have made ourselves but it is he that
[1:23:20] had made us he is our Shepherd and we
[1:23:23] are the Sheep of his pasture and to
[1:23:26] enter his gates with Thanksgiving and
[1:23:28] come into his house with praise be
[1:23:31] thankful unto him and bless his name
[1:23:33] tonight for the Lord is good his Mercy
[1:23:37] is Everlasting and his truth endure to
[1:23:40] all generations
[1:23:42] blessed be the name of the Lord be
[1:23:44] believer tonight
[1:23:45] amen oh my all resting on demo that's
[1:23:49] the same thing of the word of God
[1:23:50] spreads away he said let it be light the
[1:23:52] light only comes with True Light and the
[1:23:54] King light comes by the word of God see
[1:23:57] and God separated the light from the
[1:23:58] darkness in the beginning and the word
[1:24:00] of God made manifest always separates
[1:24:04] the light from the darkness amen is that
[1:24:07] right he said people can rise up with
[1:24:08] this or that or isms rise up communism
[1:24:11] fascism he said all these are isms can
[1:24:13] rise superstitions Cults whatever it
[1:24:16] might be might rise but when that King
[1:24:18] light of the Bible Rises up all
[1:24:21] superstitions and things see goes away
[1:24:24] see but you see now you know it's there
[1:24:26] but until it's Vindicated proves it is
[1:24:29] light he said then we have no right to
[1:24:31] argue against that because it shuts all
[1:24:34] other lights out Jesus said amen God's
[1:24:37] word God's light shuts all other lights
[1:24:39] out he said let every man word be a lie
[1:24:42] and mine be true
[1:24:44] be true his word is superior over all
[1:24:46] man's words over all anything his word
[1:24:49] is
[1:24:55] so there's power in a name isn't all
[1:24:57] right we're talking about that right let
[1:24:59] me come in this thought here and just
[1:25:00] kind of drop down get ready to close out
[1:25:02] and wind down so when God met Abraham he
[1:25:04] changed to Abram changed his name to
[1:25:07] Abraham what happened somebody took
[1:25:10] place Abraham overcome with God isn't
[1:25:12] that right God gave him a name to
[1:25:15] reflect the promise that he had gave to
[1:25:17] him to make him a father of Nations he
[1:25:21] may pronounce a blessing over Abram's
[1:25:23] life no more would he be called Abram
[1:25:25] but now he was called Abraham the father
[1:25:28] of Nations
[1:25:30] bear that name until his son Comforts he
[1:25:34] had to bear that name isn't that right
[1:25:35] oh Hallelujah did the doctors laugh at
[1:25:37] him though he had mockers and scoffers
[1:25:39] he said God promised me a son and I'm
[1:25:42] gonna have it that's the say of the Lord
[1:25:44] and I'm hanging on to God's every word

[1:25:57] Adam Adam's name in the Hebrew is
[1:25:59] actually Adam which means of the land
[1:26:01] which means every time God spoke the
[1:26:04] name Adam who reminded Adam of where he
[1:26:06] had drawn him from he said I call you up
[1:26:08] from the land to serve my purpose and to
[1:26:11] serve my cause and to serve amen is not
[1:26:13] right and to walk before me and to have
[1:26:16] dominion over to follow the air and to
[1:26:18] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:26:19] and over everything that is upon the
[1:26:21] earth oh hallelujah how far has man
[1:26:24] fallen from that understanding and that
[1:26:26] Consciousness that it is God that raise
[1:26:28] him up from the dust oh Hallelujah to

[1:27:13] he gave him a name called him cephas
[1:27:16] which means Little Rock and little did
[1:27:19] we know that later on in the Scripture
[1:27:20] it was only a sign of the Revelation
[1:27:23] that he was going to place in Peter's
[1:27:25] heart praise God only at all who do men
[1:27:28] say I the son of Madam many were
[1:27:30] wondering some say it is some say it out

[1:27:37] name that was pronounced upon upon
[1:27:40] cephas all of a sudden anointing come
[1:27:42] around him Jesus knew what was taking
[1:27:44] place and Revelation shook his heart as
[1:27:47] he towered the Christ son of the Living
[1:27:49] God and Jesus come around and said power
[1:27:51] Peter pray and Upon This Rock I'll build

[1:29:07] they were studying is the actual
[1:29:08] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[1:29:11] church and his work in the future ages
[1:29:13] he said then I mentioned that it takes
[1:29:14] the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or
[1:29:18] we fail to get it bringing these two
[1:29:20] thoughts together Prophet said you will
[1:29:21] see that it won't take just ordinary
[1:29:24] study and thinking to make this book
[1:29:27] real he said it's going to take the
[1:29:31] operation of the Holy Ghost oh
[1:29:33] Hallelujah so not an enticing words of
[1:29:35] man's Wisdom but is in a revelation that
[1:29:38] the Holy Ghost brings to the individual

[1:29:42] just like Jesus walked the streets and
[1:29:45] the Pharisees didn't know he was the

[1:30:55] special class of people oh hallelujah
[1:30:59] hallelujah he said he'll take one with

[1:33:02] true that every Jew born since Christ
[1:33:03] came will be saved praise God who would
[1:33:05] have put 144 000 we know this quote
[1:33:06] right so he steps down he says well
[1:33:08] there's about two questions here but he
[1:33:09] said no he said nothing will be saved
[1:33:11] only those names were put on a Lamb's
[1:33:14] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:33:16] the world Jew or Gentile see that's all
[1:33:18] he said the book holds that mystery
[1:33:23] the mystery of what the name is and
[1:33:26] reveals it in a time that it's supposed
[1:33:27] to be revealed oh man and here you
[1:33:29] comfort your name come you come out when
[1:33:32] your name is spoken through the mystery
[1:33:34] isn't that right oh my no wonder God
[1:33:36] sent a prophet to call your name from
[1:33:38] the book that's why we come here tonight
[1:33:40] it wasn't by chance because God ordained
[1:33:43] you in his mind from the beginning and
[1:33:45] said because you are coming on the earth
[1:33:47] I need to announce my bride coming by
[1:33:50] sending a prophet behold I send Elijah
[1:33:52] hallelujah praise God to prophesy amen
[1:33:56] the names in that book and here we are
[1:33:58] tonight he said uh that's all see the
[1:34:00] book holds a mystery and the book is
[1:34:02] only unfolding it now not each one's
[1:34:05] name but what the mystery of the book is
[1:34:08] while it is calling those names he said
[1:34:11] you finally understand it now amen is
[1:34:13] not your name literal name praise God
[1:34:15] but the word of God concerning you for
[1:34:18] this age oh Hallelujah so when he said
[1:34:20] there'll be a bride on the earth he
[1:34:27] to manifest the things that are written
[1:34:29] in this book for the time is at hand oh
[1:34:32] Hallelujah Hallelujah hey man you can
[1:34:35] begin to play something softly man oh
[1:34:37] the book doesn't say Lee Veil to be
[1:34:39] saved in the time of this church age or
[1:34:40] something or Orman Neville or whoever no
[1:34:43] don't say that it just shows the mystery
[1:34:46] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[1:34:48] and he said but we lay we ourselves by
[1:34:50] faith believe it and that's what I said
[1:34:53] the other night amen we connect with it
[1:34:56] oh one last quote not finish
[1:34:57] in the hidden Life of Christ Prophet
[1:35:00] said the Bible said that he that
[1:35:01] overcome it I'll give him a new name
[1:35:05] I'll put my spirit what name I'll put my
[1:35:07] spirit in him that's it right there I
[1:35:09] said watch there's an overcoming first
[1:35:11] you've got to overcome these things in
[1:35:14] order to be in Christ he said there's
[1:35:16] where the church is fear are failing in
[1:35:18] one place overcoming overcoming
[1:35:20] Temperance temper overcome difference
