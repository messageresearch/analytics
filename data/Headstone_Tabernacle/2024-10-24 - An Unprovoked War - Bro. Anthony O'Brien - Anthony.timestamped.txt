[39:42] for the
[39:44] message that God U I believe is inspired
[39:47] to me and uh had this a while

[39:54] ordered this day and so I feel that
[39:58] uh this is what God put up on my heart
[40:00] amen so 1 Samuel chapter
[40:03] 30 and vers 1 to8 it's a familiar
[40:08] story and it says and it came to pass
[40:12] when David and his men would come to
[40:14] ziklag on the third day that the
[40:17] amalekites had invaded the South and
[40:21] ziklag and smitten ziklag and burnt it
[40:24] with fire and had taken the word women
[40:27] captives that were therein they slew not
[40:31] any either great or small that's amazing
[40:35] no one got killed in this attack but
[40:38] they carried them away and went on their
[40:42] way and so David and his men came to the
[40:44] city and behold it was burned with fire
[40:48] and their wives and their sons and their
[40:51] daughters were taken
[40:53] captives then David and the people that
[40:56] were with him lifted up their voice and
[40:58] wept until they had no more power to
[41:01] weep and David's two men uh two wives
[41:04] were taken captive aoam the jezreelite
[41:07] Tes and Abigail the wife of nabal the
[41:12] car uh the carite and David was greatly
[41:15] distressed for the people spake of
[41:18] stoning him because the soul of all the
[41:21] people was grieved every man for his son
[41:24] for his
[41:25] daughters but David in encourage
[41:28] himself in the Lord his God Amen tonight
[41:33] and David said to
[41:35] AB abatha the priest sorry ahc son I
[41:40] pray thee bring me hither the ephod and
[41:45] Abitha brought thither the ephod to
[41:48] David and David inquired at the Lord
[41:52] saying shall I pursue after this troop
[41:56] shall I over overtake them and he
[41:59] answered him pursue for Thou shalt
[42:02] surely overtake them and without fail
[42:06] recover

[44:23] unprovoked
[44:25] War that's my title tonight
[44:28] an unprovoked
[44:30] War I want to read a story here before I
[44:33] get into it um there a little
[44:36] story uh about a young girl's account
[44:39] and I just want to read it and you'll
[44:40] just grab the gist of it as we go
[44:43] through all
[44:44] right it says the beginning was on
[44:46] February 17th
[44:49] 2022 I was having physics classes online
[44:53] when we first heard explosions 10 km
[44:56] away
[44:58] they then began to land on nearby
[45:00] streets so it's coming
[45:03] closer our teacher instructed us to rush
[45:06] to the
[45:07] shelter when I got to the corridor I
[45:10] heard a loud explosion I only managed to
[45:13] sit next to the wall close my ears and
[45:16] open my mouth to avoid being shocked by
[45:19] the blast wave we then dashed to the
[45:22] basement closing the door only to have
[45:25] fragments fly across the basement the
[45:27] roof and the
[45:29] asphalt I sobbed it was a typical
[45:33] morning yet here we are the shelling
[45:37] continued in the days that followed on
[45:39] February 21st I awoke to the most
[45:42] powerful explosion just a big bang the
[45:46] birds flew and then there was silence it
[45:50] felt like the end of the world we didn't
[45:54] have time to go to the basement so my
[45:56] grand mother and I hid between two walls
[46:00] later that day we had a session with a
[46:02] physiologist uh or psychologist rather
[46:05] at the Village Club where we heard a
[46:07] loud explosion I realized it was
[46:10] somewhere around my house and I remember
[46:12] everything in bits and pieces how I got
[46:16] to my yard there was no windows in the
[46:18] summer kitchen how a window in the house
[46:21] completely fell out with all the pains
[46:23] and how I entered into my room and saw
[46:25] small sharpn piece that pierced the
[46:28] window and hanging on curtain hanging on
[46:30] the curtains when we went into hide in
[46:32] the basement of an apartment building
[46:34] beds on a stove and a table had been
[46:36] arranged there since 2014 when
[46:39] hostilities had first started in our
[46:41] region I was in the second grade then
[46:44] and I remember how it was in our village
[46:46] with tanks firing from the streets I
[46:49] recall how happy we were as children
[46:51] sitting in that same basement when a
[46:53] lady brought us cooked corn and so forth
[46:55] like that she goes on
[46:58] and she said the region uh where I live
[47:01] now is rather safe and I was able to
[47:02] spend the entire summer there I moved
[47:04] with my grandmother to the hostel to her
[47:06] house in July where we now live for free
[47:09] and in the Autumn I began my senior year
[47:11] in high school we be taking exams to
[47:13] study journalism at University I want to
[47:16] get a good
[47:17] education however I am still affected by
[47:21] the War I haven't heard anything from my
[47:24] mother in 8 months it would be a huge
[47:27] relief to learn that she is
[47:31] alive this story I just
[47:33] read is the account of a girl named
[47:36] Sophia who lived in Ukraine and this is
[47:39] her account of what happened in the
[47:42] invasion of
[47:44] Russia in February of
[47:46] 2022 and that is still presently going
[47:48] on right now this attack on Ukraine and
[47:52] its Beloved Country and its citizens
[47:55] seemed unfair
[47:58] it seemed
[47:59] unprovoked it seemed
[48:02] unwarranted it seemed uncalled for and I
[48:06] could only imagine that this is exactly
[48:08] how David and the people of ziklag felt
[48:12] when the amalekites Came Upon them on
[48:15] this faithful day in 1st Samuel chapter
[48:18] 30 let's read that verse again and it
[48:21] came to pass that when David and his men
[48:23] were come to ziklag on the third day
[48:26] that the amalekites had invaded the
[48:28] South they there was an invasion and on
[48:31] their way through the invasion they
[48:34] happen to pass through ziklag and ziklag
[48:38] and smitten ziklag and burnt it with
[48:41] fire that's what the Bible says that
[48:44] what happened and here is David David in
[48:47] the prior chapters if you read back he
[48:49] was just returning from a disagreement
[48:52] he was just returning from a
[48:54] disappointing campaign uh a
[48:57] disappointing Journey uh he was supposed
[48:59] to go up with some Men of War uh but he
[49:02] could find no favor with them and uh
[49:05] they didn't want to go up with him they
[49:07] told him to go back where you come from
[49:10] we don't want you here so here is David
[49:13] returning from a failed campaign
[49:17] returning from a
[49:19] disappointment uh a disappointing
[49:21] journey of three days only to find more
[49:25] disappointment
[49:27] when he comes to his place of abod his
[49:30] place of living his place of dwelling
[49:33] isn't that right and sometimes brothers
[49:36] and sisters in our very own lives and in
[49:39] our very own Christian Journeys we end
[49:43] up in a situation in a war that seems
[49:47] unprovoked you didn't go around looking
[49:49] for trouble amen trouble came knocking
[49:52] at your door to test you to see if you
[49:56] really want to be a Christian to see if
[50:00] you really got your boots on to see if
[50:03] you really got what it takes to go all
[50:06] the way with God and if you're going to
[50:09] be a Christian tonight then you have to
[50:12] be able to prove every inch of ground
[50:15] that you claim to stand upon and tonight
[50:18] the devil is going to make you prove
[50:22] every inch of ground you claim to stand
[50:25] upon
[50:27] God told Joshua every place where the
[50:30] soul of your foot shall tread upon shall
[50:33] be yours therefore the fight of the
[50:36] enemy is to make sure your foot don't
[50:39] step on it but once you step on it it is
[50:43] yours oh because Footprints represent
[50:47] possession oh and we are called tonight

[53:53] the power thereof he can come this much
[53:56] close oh but no more he he can't get

[54:35] where are you now coming from devil said
[54:37] I've been to and fro walking around

[54:42] trouble God said well look I've got a
[54:45] assignment for you here have you
[54:48] considered my servant job and the devil

[54:54] hedge around him you are he is God's

[55:04] long time and God said listen I want you
[55:06] to take a crack at him I want you to
[55:09] come at him with all you've got but God
[55:12] said listen this is my game and I set
[55:14] the rules so I want you to come at him
[55:16] with all you've got he said but there's
[55:18] one rule you can't break devil you can't
[55:21] take his life friends I truly believe
[55:24] that if God did didn't tell the devil to
[55:27] not take job's life the devil would have
[55:30] taken his life that is without a doubt
[55:34] because the devil praise God does not
[55:36] want your life to give him glory oh amen
[55:40] he knows that there's no glory in death
[55:42] praise God so if God didn't set the
[55:44] rules of the game the devil would have
[55:46] played by his own rules so God said
[55:48] listen you're going to play this thing
[55:49] by my rules you're going to do as I say

[1:00:17] a chance to defend
[1:00:19] yourself came without warning came
[1:00:22] without uh uh premeditation just coming
[1:00:25] at you from all sides and I myself feel
[1:00:29] like I I've been in an unprovoked War
[1:00:32] for about the past 3 weeks the devil was
[1:00:35] coming through the front door he was
[1:00:37] hitting the front door then he started
[1:00:39] hitting the windows then he started
[1:00:41] scraping at the ceilings like a cloud of
[1:00:44] Madness surrounding you on all sides
[1:00:47] praise God first it was my skin then it
[1:00:49] was my wife then it then it was Ezra
[1:00:51] then it was Eden and sickness and
[1:00:54] viruses and diseases and through all of
[1:00:56] this I had to hold on to faith somehow
[1:00:59] that God would work it out somehow that
[1:01:03] God would make it happen somehow that
[1:01:05] his Deliverance would come to me somehow
[1:01:09] I am a witness tonight that it is an
[1:01:11] unprovoked War you didn't go looking for
[1:01:14] trouble trouble come looking for you oh
[1:01:18] Hallelujah but God is able to Deliver Us
[1:01:20] from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul
[1:01:24] the Lord shall Preserve thy going out uh
[1:01:27] the Lord shall preserve thy coming in uh
[1:01:30] from this time forth uh and even forever
[1:01:33] more and the skin worms destroyed his
[1:01:36] body yet in my flesh I shall seek God
[1:01:40] for myself David said I shall not die
[1:01:45] but live and declare the works of the
[1:01:47] Lord the Lord has chasen me sore but he
[1:01:51] had not given me over unto death open to
[1:01:54] me the gate of righteousness and I shall
[1:01:58] go into them and I will praise the name
[1:02:02] of my God this gate into which the
[1:02:05] righteous shall enter tonight oh
[1:02:09] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh open
[1:02:13] to me those Gates tonight oh we are the
[1:02:17] children of Zion those gates are for you
[1:02:21] to come back
[1:02:22] home to your Dwelling Place to the place
[1:02:26] where you belong hallelujah oh
[1:02:28] hallelujah praise
[1:02:30] God sometimes it's when our back is
[1:02:33] turned it's when we least
[1:02:35] expected that's when the enemy
[1:02:38] chooses to come at us that's why we've
[1:02:41] got to be
[1:02:42] ready and stay ready for when the enemy
[1:02:46] would come at you your enemy is as a
[1:02:50] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:02:54] isn't that right a pack of lions don't
[1:02:57] run up against a pack of wild boar or
[1:03:00] wild Wilder beasts they are smarter than
[1:03:04] that they can't tussle with those
[1:03:06] horns they get killed so what they do is
[1:03:10] they look around in the Safari Plains
[1:03:14] looking at the wild beasts and what they
[1:03:16] are looking for is a point of
[1:03:19] weakness they're looking for a point of
[1:03:21] entry they are looking for one to stray
[1:03:25] away from the
[1:03:26] pack far enough so that the lionesses
[1:03:30] could come up on approach and without
[1:03:33] warning they will strike and before you
[1:03:36] know it they're already upon you before
[1:03:38] you know it they've already severed the
[1:03:41] jugular and blood is pouring out and
[1:03:44] it's too late for the youngling then
[1:03:47] it's already it's cleaners time isn't
[1:03:49] that right the lionesses eat the meat
[1:03:51] first eat the bring the meat back for
[1:03:53] the the big lion and he has the and
[1:03:56] share and then he gives the rest to the
[1:03:58] younger ones praise God and that's the
[1:04:00] end of that isn't that right that's what
[1:04:02] the devil likes to do look for a points
[1:04:05] of weakness where he could tap at you to
[1:04:08] see where you are weak that's why God
[1:04:10] has released his spirit in these last
[1:04:13] days that's why he's passing us through
[1:04:15] valleys and through tests and through
[1:04:18] tempests and through Wilderness so he
[1:04:21] can strengthen the feeble knees so he
[1:04:23] can strengthen you at your weak points
[1:04:25] so he can strengthen you in the places
[1:04:27] where you are weak so that you can be
[1:04:30] fortified against the enemy who is as a
[1:04:32] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:04:37] looking for weak points in your
[1:04:39] Christianity so tonight strengthen the
[1:04:42] feeble knees tonight there's a call to
[1:04:44] war going out oh I make sure your boots
[1:04:48] are shined up make sure your gun is
[1:04:50] loaded make sure your knife is on your
[1:04:53] side make sure your belt is straped
[1:04:56] make sure you know where your uniform is
[1:04:58] because at the sound of the alarm we
[1:05:01] have to go up and take the enemy before
[1:05:04] he takes us oh hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:05:07] who's going to go to war tonight who
[1:05:09] knows whose side you're standing on
[1:05:11] tonight oh as for me and my house we are
[1:05:14] standing on the Lord's Side we will
[1:05:17] serve the Lord oh H let us go up at once
[1:05:22] and take the land that he had sworn unto
[1:05:25] our fathers
[1:05:26] the land that was once delivered the
[1:05:28] land that was once given on Pentecost
[1:05:31] when the Holy Ghost poured out upon
[1:05:34] disciples waiting in the upper room it
[1:05:37] was once delivered and I know God can
[1:05:40] deliver it again if God gave the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost once he could do it again if God
[1:05:46] gave his power once I know he can
[1:05:48] release it again and just like Samson
[1:05:52] I'm standing at the pillars oh god oh
[1:05:55] once more Lord send down the Holy Ghost
[1:05:59] upon this church uh once more Lord send
[1:06:04] down the anointing send down the power
[1:06:07] release your power release your Dynamics
[1:06:11] release your quickening power and may
[1:06:14] the sick be healed May the blind see May
[1:06:18] the walk and may the gospel be
[1:06:22] preached in its
[1:06:23] power that's what we're looking for
[1:06:26] tonight that's why we come to church
[1:06:30] because an event is about to
[1:06:32] unfold and we want to be ready
[1:06:35] Hallelujah when he comes he says behold
[1:06:38] I come quickly my reward is with me it's
[1:06:42] with him the Seal of God is with him to
[1:06:45] seal every man in their forehead every
[1:06:47] woman who was faithful and true who have
[1:06:49] kept the words of this book he's coming
[1:06:52] with your reward to give every man
[1:06:54] according to his worku amen so we got to
[1:06:57] work
[1:06:58] tonight but I don't mind working because
[1:07:01] he died for me I I got to work for him
[1:07:05] he saved my soul from despair he saved
[1:07:09] my soul from depression i' I've got to
[1:07:11] work for him tonight oh how many feel
[1:07:13] that way amen
[1:07:16] amen praise God isn't that right so
[1:07:19] these guys that came and attacked David
[1:07:21] they were the
[1:07:21] amalekites Apparently these are
[1:07:23] descendants of Esau amen this tribe was
[1:07:27] a pesky tribe to Israel they were like a
[1:07:30] Scourge isn't that right upon the land
[1:07:32] these are the same tribes that attack
[1:07:34] Moses and the Hebrews that were coming
[1:07:35] out of the Wilderness so many years
[1:07:38] before isn't that right God had a bone
[1:07:41] to pick with these guys even back then
[1:07:44] and tonight they came without
[1:07:46] warning sometimes the enemy comes that
[1:07:49] way isn't that right in the days of
[1:07:52] Shamar when the people labored and sowed
[1:07:55] and kill their land the Philistines
[1:07:57] would come
[1:07:59] unprovoked and harass the people and
[1:08:02] take their crops take their increase
[1:08:05] take their Harvest everything that they
[1:08:07] work so hard to do these these these
[1:08:11] pests these these these these low lives
[1:08:15] come and take their reward from them
[1:08:17] isn't that right and God raise up a man
[1:08:20] called Shamar who had had enough than
[1:08:23] enough he had had more than enough of
[1:08:25] what was Tak place and he took an ox go
[1:08:27] isn't that right and challenged 600
[1:08:30] Philistines isn't that right and he beat
[1:08:32] the Philistines so much that his actions
[1:08:35] actually delivered Israel from that day
[1:08:38] forward isn't that right oh
[1:08:41] Hallelujah the Bible says in verse two
[1:08:43] they took the woman captive and they
[1:08:45] that were in therein but slew not any we
[1:08:48] were talking about that earlier right
[1:08:50] and I found that that was such a
[1:08:51] tremendous verse in the
[1:08:53] scripture that even though though this
[1:08:55] attack was happening even though David
[1:08:58] was powerless to stop what was going on
[1:09:01] none of the people were killed in this
[1:09:04] attack and this always speaks to me to
[1:09:07] the grace of God that is in the midst of
[1:09:10] every trying
[1:09:11] situation we can always look and see
[1:09:15] that it could have been worse it could
[1:09:17] have overcome us it could have taken
[1:09:20] over us the proud Waters could have
[1:09:23] overtaken our soul but for the grace of
[1:09:26] God where would we be tonight his hand
[1:09:29] was still in the midst of your storm and
[1:09:33] you are going to recover all that you
[1:09:35] lost just have faith in God tonight in
[1:09:39] the god that is able to deliver in the
[1:09:41] god that is able to restore in the god
[1:09:44] that is able to
[1:09:47] redeem to restore to bring back to a
[1:09:51] former state of condition there's a
[1:09:54] promise of restoration
[1:09:56] in this story here tonight isn't that
[1:09:58] right amen amen so these four words are
[1:10:02] very very notably mentioned they slew
[1:10:04] not any and this is the grace of God
[1:10:07] isn't that right to David in this
[1:10:09] situation you can always see in every
[1:10:11] situation that there's the grace of God
[1:10:13] in it God's hand was still in it despite
[1:10:17] what was happening to
[1:10:18] you despite feeling like you were
[1:10:21] powerless Hallelujah still God was in it
[1:10:24] he does not give you more than you can
[1:10:26] bear and with every Temptation he makes
[1:10:29] a way of Escape for your soul tonight
[1:10:33] this is our God tonight he is gracious
[1:10:36] and full of compassion slow to anger and
[1:10:40] plenteous in
[1:10:41] Mercy amen and amen if you're in his
[1:10:44] hands tonight then we have to
[1:10:47] testify of the mercy of God so David's
[1:10:50] men came to that City David and his men
[1:10:53] came to the city and behold it was bur
[1:10:55] with fire and their wives and their sons
[1:10:57] their daughters were taken captive and
[1:10:59] the people lifted up their voice and
[1:11:02] wept this was the response until they
[1:11:04] had no more power to weep they cried
[1:11:08] until they were ran out of Tears they
[1:11:11] cried until they had no more cry left in
[1:11:13] them there were just moans and pitiful
[1:11:17] size of grief and despair this is the
[1:11:20] situation that we are seeing here
[1:11:23] unfolding in the scripture David's two
[1:11:25] wives were taken and so on the Bible
[1:11:27] said David was greatly distressed for
[1:11:30] the people spake of stoning him oh these
[1:11:33] men were human just like us they were
[1:11:36] had like passions just like us
[1:11:38] hallelujah they felt the same pains that
[1:11:41] we feel even in our day and in and in
[1:11:44] our time and with our situations they
[1:11:47] felt the same pains that that we feel oh
[1:11:51] it feels good to know that tonight that
[1:11:53] this Bible is full of stories
[1:11:55] stories of men just like us women just
[1:11:59] like us who had fears and doubts just
[1:12:01] like us but just like us God put
[1:12:04] something inside of their souls God put
[1:12:07] something inside of their beings that
[1:12:09] was beyond the natural it was it wasn't
[1:12:12] normal what they were doing by faith
[1:12:14] because it was something that God put
[1:12:16] inside of them by predestination that
[1:12:19] God knows that in the moment when it is
[1:12:22] needed the most when they reach deep
[1:12:24] down and inside the call that God put in
[1:12:27] their heart comes to the four and
[1:12:30] everything else goes in the backdrop and
[1:12:33] they said Lord if it's you bit me come
[1:12:36] oh I I know the storm is out there but I
[1:12:39] can't deny that it is Jesus oh it is
[1:12:42] Jesus it is Jesus in my soul oh oh I
[1:12:48] have touched the ham of His Garment and
[1:12:52] his
[1:12:53] blood had made me whole I know what I
[1:12:56] felt was real I know hallelujah oh and I
[1:13:00] want a double portion of oh praise God
[1:13:03] of that mantle I know it was real I've
[1:13:06] got to go all the way got to go past
[1:13:08] gilgal got to go past bethl got to go
[1:13:12] past the school of the prophets oh hold
[1:13:15] your peace I know what I'm after I'm
[1:13:18] after that same
[1:13:20] power the same thing that I felt I know
[1:13:24] it's real
[1:13:26] regardless of what I see around me I
[1:13:30] can't deny the call is in my heart amen
[1:13:34] and that's the way we feel tonight
[1:13:36] something Beyond us is calling us higher
[1:13:39] friends calling us to the Holy Ghost
[1:13:42] calling us to a birth calling us to
[1:13:45] adoption calling us to Perfection
[1:13:48] calling us to handle that sword to be
[1:13:51] able to hold it firmly with all the
[1:13:54] faith that you've God Seven tunders give
[1:13:57] you Fai to cut out the promises of God
[1:14:01] tonight for this last day you are the
[1:14:04] one that was raised up for such a time
[1:14:07] as this tonight oh Hallelujah you've got
[1:14:10] to believe it so David was only
[1:14:14] human he was distressed Hallelujah not
[1:14:17] just distressed but greatly distressed
[1:14:20] when you are in it it affects you they
[1:14:24] always say hindsight is 2020 you look
[1:14:26] back and you could see clearly and
[1:14:29] you're not in the emotional thing you
[1:14:30] can look back and see all what God has
[1:14:33] done but when you're in it you can't see
[1:14:36] nothing because it's flying debris
[1:14:39] everywhere and your emotions are shut
[1:14:43] and you are you're going through it and
[1:14:45] it feels like there's no answer it feels
[1:14:48] like there's no cure it feels like no
[1:14:50] one is giving you the satisfying portion
[1:14:53] or or the answer to your problem or the
[1:14:55] the the the the the the uh uh the answer
[1:14:58] to your cry but God has the answer
[1:15:00] tonight he set it up in such a way that
[1:15:03] you can't find it anywhere else but in
[1:15:06] the presence of God you can't find what
[1:15:08] you're looking for unless you come to me
[1:15:10] Jesus said come unto me all that you are
[1:15:13] laid burdened and heavily Laden I'll
[1:15:16] give you rest if you want real rest
[1:15:19] you'll find it in Jesus tonight amen and
[1:15:22] amen so it affects you you're not a
[1:15:24] robot
[1:15:25] God knows the pain that you feel in your
[1:15:28] current condition in your current
[1:15:31] situation isn't that right
[1:15:34] hallelujah amen so all the people all
[1:15:36] the soul of the people was grieved every
[1:15:38] man for his sons and daughters David
[1:15:40] understood where that grief was coming
[1:15:42] from that's right he wasn't mad at the
[1:15:45] people for wanting to Stone him they
[1:15:48] wanted someone or something to hold
[1:15:50] responsible for their loss because they
[1:15:53] felt powerless in the situation here it
[1:15:56] was everything they had was taken from
[1:15:58] them and now somebody has to be
[1:16:01] responsible for why we're in this mess
[1:16:03] isn't that right and so the people saw
[1:16:06] no other person to blame but David even
[1:16:09] though his back was turned and even
[1:16:11] though he didn't know about it he had no
[1:16:14] clue what was going on until he returned
[1:16:16] yet somehow they are wrongfully accusing
[1:16:19] David for causing all of this trouble
[1:16:21] all of this unwarranted uh uh uh
[1:16:25] distress all of this unprovoked wrath
[1:16:28] that is being poured out upon them and
[1:16:30] David wasn't mad at them because he knew
[1:16:32] where he was coming from he he was a
[1:16:35] mature Christian see when people Point
[1:16:37] accusations at you and they try to drag
[1:16:39] your name down and they try to bring you
[1:16:41] down you've got to know where that's
[1:16:43] coming from you've got to know that
[1:16:45] there are spirits at work amen come on
[1:16:48] tell me help me out somebody you got to
[1:16:50] know that the devil is at work and he's
[1:16:52] trying to assassinate your character
[1:16:55] he's trying to get you to fight at his
[1:16:56] level down there in the emotional realm
[1:16:59] where you're having a pity party and oh
[1:17:02] who is me and nobody understands me and
[1:17:04] nobody knows the trouble I see the devil
[1:17:06] wants you to fight down there at that
[1:17:08] level but what Eagles know how to do is
[1:17:11] to take the battle higher take the
[1:17:14] battle on Higher Ground oh Lord plant my
[1:17:17] feet tonight on Higher Ground oh you
[1:17:21] take that snake up when he wants to drag
[1:17:24] you down pick him up and carry him where
[1:17:27] the air is thin where the air is rare
[1:17:30] where you can spread your wings and be
[1:17:33] who God meant you to be lift yourself up
[1:17:36] in prayer lift yourself up in the
[1:17:38] anointing lift yourself up in the
[1:17:41] presence of God the only way to go up uh
[1:17:44] is to get down low on your knees and get
[1:17:48] some neology oh and when you do that God
[1:17:51] will raise you up
[1:18:01] so they were greatly distressed but but
[1:18:04] but David encouraged
[1:18:06] himself in the
[1:18:08] Lord sometimes that's the only place you
[1:18:10] could Encourage
[1:18:12] Yourself you can't find enough courage

[1:20:16] but God loves when the situation gets
[1:20:18] hotter God loves when there's no way out
