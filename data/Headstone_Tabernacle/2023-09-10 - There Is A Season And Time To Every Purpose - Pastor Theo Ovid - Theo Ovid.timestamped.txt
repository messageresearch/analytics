[46:53] the word of God Amen and um at this by
[46:58] now all of you would have heard that our
[47:00] precious brother Michael mcmo passed
[47:02] away yesterday he went home to be with
[47:04] the Lord he had after a long time in
[47:11] hospital we thank God for his life and
[47:13] his
[47:14] testimony that he had in the Lord and He
[47:16] is the backbone and Foundation of this
[47:19] very church I remember was being about
[47:22] 21 years old 22 years old when he asked
[47:26] me to go up Kaa with the Saints up there
[47:29] um while he was Station in New
[47:31] York and um this is the history of our
[47:34] church I was a member of the church long
[47:38] in Enterprise but lupas was a pastor at
[47:40] the time and he used to come back and
[47:42] forth from New York and um you know he
[47:46] started a group or work and B George was
[47:48] part of that original work I believe uh
[47:51] but the that's right but the George
[47:52] right here and Samar Ali and different
[47:55] names and and um we still have brother
[47:58] George from way back then and sters
[48:00] brother brother bran Striker his son is
[48:03] here Joel and his wife his mother is
[48:07] also wrong so there are people who still
[48:09] wrong from way back in the 70s back
[48:12] there and how God took us from there to
[48:16] where we are now and it was brother
[48:18] Michael mcmo who introduced me to
[48:20] Brother Joseph colan in 1982 as a
[48:22] brother who has claimed a revoltion of
[48:24] Brotherly kindness and this Ed me to
[48:28] Brother Joseph
[48:30] kman but
[48:32] Michael would forever be in our hearts
[48:36] he was a prolific testifier and winner
[48:39] of
[48:40] souls anytime you encounter him you
[48:42] stand at risk of being invited to a
[48:44] service he had that kind of
[48:46] passion wherever he went within New York
[48:51] Trinidad doesn't matter he always
[48:54] testifying about the Lord and he was a
[48:57] laborer but George will know he would
[48:59] live with one soul for
[49:01] hours hours I used to say even Jo would
[49:05] be impressed at his patience he didn't
[49:08] have that kind of
[49:09] patience but I believe that at the end
[49:13] of it all when he goes to get his reward
[49:18] I could hear God say Well done my good
[49:21] and faithful servant
[49:28] so this time I want to stand and have a
[49:30] minute of

[1:00:54] school we got is speaking about
[1:00:56] different things his wife what was
[1:00:58] hatred I said hatred had a beginning so
[1:01:02] it has to have an end love had no
[1:01:04] beginning so it has no end hatred is
[1:01:08] forever love is eternal hatred begins
[1:01:11] and hatred will end love never did begin
[1:01:14] it will never end it's Eternal and When
[1:01:17] a Man Loves a Woman and marries her
[1:01:19] because she's a pretty there'll be an
[1:01:21] end to that but when a man lives finds a
[1:01:24] woman that he loves he don't know why
[1:01:26] but he loves her she she finds a man
[1:01:28] that she loves no matter what he looks
[1:01:30] like she loves him that's an eternal
[1:01:33] meat and Glory death or nothing else can
[1:01:37] separate them because they are from
[1:01:39] eternity here we go and they stepped out
[1:01:43] into space of time and returned back to
[1:01:47] Eternity eternity has dropped down in a
[1:01:50] body called
[1:01:51] time oh glory to God so that seed German

[1:02:05] today is a Time body and time have a
[1:02:08] beginning and time has an ending and he
[1:02:12] has set boundaries that you cannot cross
[1:02:15] herbs tablets exercise gym that they
[1:02:19] changing it he has set boundaries that
[1:02:22] you cannot cross could we say Amen
[1:02:24] somebody Oh Glory to God hallelujah so
[1:02:28] they stepped out into space of time and
[1:02:31] returned back to Eternity eternity

[1:02:39] have never yet entered into this word
[1:02:41] form body this body is subject to word
[1:02:44] to the word and and about the theophany

[1:02:59] live in that in the personal mzc then
[1:03:01] later we never heard no more mzc because
[1:03:04] he became Jesus Christ MDC was the
[1:03:07] priest and he became Jesus Christ now
[1:03:10] you bypass that because in that form he
[1:03:13] knowed all things and you have never
[1:03:16] been able to know that yet you come like
[1:03:19] Adam like me you come from attribute to
[1:03:22] the flesh to be tempted but when when
[1:03:26] this life is finished here not if when
[1:03:29] this life is finished here if this
[1:03:31] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:03:33] one already waiting that is where we go
[1:03:37] that is the word then we can look back

[1:03:56] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:03:59] was God in the beginning is where God

[1:07:25] envy and jealous and all kind of malice
[1:07:27] and strife or what Reon how Petty and
[1:07:29] foolish it
[1:07:33] is Ecclesiastes is a powerful book you
[1:07:38] know it's almost like a sarcasm of Life
[1:07:42] the rich and the poor go in the same
[1:07:47] place the rich are going to Executive
[1:07:49] grave
[1:07:52] in the of d a rich gold to the death you
[1:07:56] know the same pain you know same
[1:07:59] sickness same old a same everything you
[1:08:03] know so listen this back
[1:08:07] now you
[1:08:09] see in order to stand
[1:08:12] Temptation you are to bypass the
[1:08:15] theophany you are to come down here in
[1:08:17] flesh to be tempted by
[1:08:20] sin
[1:08:23] now is not God want to heal you know he
[1:08:27] is a
[1:08:32] Healer is not God want to save you now
[1:08:35] he is a savior that is in him that is
[1:08:39] who he is he is a savior he is a
[1:08:43] redeemer he is a deliverer he is a
[1:08:46] baptizer he is the I am that I am that
[1:08:49] is what he
[1:08:52] is but when man was perfect in the
[1:08:55] Garden of Eden he couldn't
[1:08:59] manifest what he
[1:09:01] is so to get it going he put on free
[1:09:04] moral agency to choose you say of every
[1:09:08] tree don't touch that tree the day you
[1:09:10] eat that day you die so when man
[1:09:14] fell and
[1:09:16] died God got the
[1:09:18] opportunity to express who he
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:23] is so the can stop you from being healed
[1:09:26] He Is A
[1:09:27] Healer it's not God trying to heal you
[1:09:30] God have to exercise oh God I want to
[1:09:32] heal them I want to heal them it's not
[1:09:34] that he is a Healer he is a way maker he
[1:09:37] is a provider he is Jehovah Gyra he is a
[1:09:42] protector oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:09:44] the
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:50] house so sin brought about this element
[1:09:55] and that is how we bypass our theophany
[1:09:58] because Adam was supposed to make sons
[1:09:59] in His image and likeness to reflect
[1:10:02] Adam andam was born Spirit man and God
[1:10:05] put him in flesh look what God did God
[1:10:08] take a spirit man Genesis 1 and then
[1:10:10] form a flesh man Genesis 2 and breathed
[1:10:13] that Spirit man into the flesh man
[1:10:15] because he brought dust the very Earth
[1:10:17] that we standing on is what God formed
[1:10:19] the dust what form God man out of that's
[1:10:21] why he said dust Thou Art and the dust
[1:10:23] Thou shalt return oh get the Lord a
[1:10:25] shout this body come from the dust this
[1:10:28] body going back to the dust but there's
[1:10:29] going to be a bride in the last days
[1:10:31] will not see death she shall be changed
[1:10:34] it's going to be a
[1:10:36] Rapture Oh Glory to God this time body
[1:10:39] going to be transformed glory to God
[1:10:42] Amen do you believe
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:46] that see come here in the flesh to be
[1:10:48] tempted by
[1:10:51] sin so Temptation come with it
[1:10:56] Temptations is part of the package you
[1:10:58] don't want to be tempted you want to go
[1:10:59] on the mountain and hide on some sheet
[1:11:01] or something so when you finish that you
[1:11:03] still at the face of
[1:11:14] Temptation before the found of the world
[1:11:16] his name was put in L book of life then
[1:11:17] from that he become the word the
[1:11:19] theophany that could appear and
[1:11:21] disappear talking about Jesus then he
[1:11:23] become flesh and return back again
[1:11:25] resurrected that same body in a
[1:11:27] glorified condition but you bypass the
[1:11:30] theophany and become flesh man to be
[1:11:33] tempted by sin and then if this Earth
[1:11:36] temp be dissolved we have already a one
[1:11:38] waiting we have not yet the bodies but
[1:11:41] look when this body received the spirit
[1:11:43] of God The Immortal Life inside of you
[1:11:46] it throws this body in subjection to God
[1:11:49] he that's born of God does not commit
[1:11:53] sin oh praise God
[1:11:55] who started time when this time start
[1:11:58] when when did this thing kick off
[1:11:59] Genesis 1:14 and God said let there be
[1:12:02] lights in the firmament and of the
[1:12:03] Heavens to divide the day from the night
[1:12:06] let them be for signs and for seasons
[1:12:09] and for days and for years so he
[1:12:12] introduced days years seasons and time
[1:12:15] isn't that right praise God and now we
[1:12:18] said what in the beginning that is when
[1:12:21] time started brother when eternity broke
[1:12:24] down into time and after a while it
[1:12:26] comes back to Eternity of course time is
[1:12:28] eternity too but time is a lotted space
[1:12:31] so time is a slot in this this circle
[1:12:35] called eternity God put a slot for us to
[1:12:38] have time oh praise God hallelujah oh
[1:12:41] give the Lord some praise right with me

[1:34:13] looking young and strong but the time
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:20] up I want to skip on this quickly
[1:34:23] seasons and natural divisions of the
[1:34:25] year that are primar caused by the tilt
[1:34:28] of the earth axis and orbit around the
[1:34:29] sun there are four primary Seasons
[1:34:31] spring summer autumn fall winter each
[1:34:33] season has distinct characteristics and
[1:34:36] is associated with specific weather
[1:34:38] patterns changes in vegetation
[1:34:39] variations in daylight hours Spring
[1:34:41] occurs after winter it is characterized
[1:34:44] by gradual warming of the earth so God
[1:34:46] set this like a like a like a engineer
[1:34:49] you know set the sun set the everything
[1:34:51] just set it and just leave it in order
[1:34:53] he said now science now could say what
[1:34:55] the the calendar going to be 20 years
[1:34:56] from now 30 years from now God said it
[1:34:58] so perfect they could tell you what day
[1:35:01] what day is on 2036 they could tell you
[1:35:03] what day they're going to be because God
[1:35:06] set it so no man has set it God set it
[1:35:09] God set time oh gor and we have a set
[1:35:12] time oh glory to God there's going to be
[1:35:15] Revival in our home and he going to make
[1:35:16] it how many going to prepare for it how
[1:35:18] many going to be expecting it how many
[1:35:20] going to shake out their fullness
[1:35:22] Oh Glory to God and this church going be
[1:35:24] a church that could be on fire for God
[1:35:26] oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:35:29] Hallelujah Autumn marks the transition
[1:35:31] from Summer to Winter it is
[1:35:33] characterized by Cooler temperatures
[1:35:34] shorter days shedding of leaves utum is
[1:35:36] very beautiful all the bleed go gold and
[1:35:39] yellow and and brown and golden and
[1:35:41] everything else very beautiful to see
[1:35:43] and then winter is the coldest of the
[1:35:45] year it follows Autumn it's
[1:35:46] characterized by shorter days longer
[1:35:48] nights freezing temperatures and so on
[1:35:50] so the changing of seasons have a
[1:35:52] significant impact on on many aspects of
[1:35:54] life including agriculture ecology human
[1:35:57] activities cultural Traditions it
[1:35:59] influences the behavior of plants and

[2:00:30] advancement that's ambition ambition
[2:00:33] aspiration pretention means strong
[2:00:35] desire and advancement ambition applies
[2:00:38] to the desire for personal advancement
[2:00:40] or preferment may suggest equal equally
[2:00:43] a praiseworthy or inordinate desire
[2:00:46] driven by ambition aspiration implies
[2:00:48] striving after something higher than one
[2:00:53] why did I talk about ambition because
[2:00:55] there are some people have
[2:00:58] none ambition is what jams you to get a
[2:01:01] higher
