[0:02] Amen.
[0:10] Blessed be his wonderful name. Reading
[0:12] from the book of Exodus, just one verse
[0:13] there, chapter 3 and verse 8.
[0:17] And it says, "And I am come down to
[0:19] deliver them out of the hand of the
[0:22] Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
[0:25] that land, unto a good land, and a
[0:28] large, unto a land flowing with milk and
[0:30] honey, unto the place of the Canaanites,
[0:33] and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
[0:35] the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[0:37] Jebusites." And just to paint a picture
[0:39] here, this is just after
[0:43] Abraham
[0:45] had the challenge to sacrifice Isaac.
[0:49] God provided a ram. And this was the
[0:52] promise at this point.
[0:54] Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; I am come down to deliver.
[0:58] And he went on to say the land was a
[1:00] good land flowing with milk and honey.
[1:04] And he said it was the place of the
[1:05] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[1:07] Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and
[1:09] Jebusites. Amen. Amen.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Now, if we were to turn to Deuteronomy
[1:14] 11,
[1:16] reading from verse 22 to 25,
[1:25] speaking to Moses here, he said, "For if
[1:28] ye shall diligently keep all these
[1:31] commandments with which I commanded you
[1:34] to do them, to love the Lord your God,
[1:37] to walk in all his ways, and to cleave
[1:39] unto him,
[1:40] Then will the Lord drive out all these
[1:43] nations from before you, and you shall
[1:46] possess greater nations and mightier
[1:49] than yourself.
[1:51] Every place whereon the souls of your
[1:53] feet shall thread up thread shall be
[1:56] yours. From the wilderness and Lebanon,
[1:59] from the river, the river Euphrates,
[2:01] even unto the uttermost sea shall your
[2:03] coast be. There shall no man be able to
[2:07] stand before you. For the Lord your God
[2:09] shall lay the fair of you and the dread
[2:12] of you upon all the land that he shall
[2:15] tread upon as he had said unto you. And
[2:19] if we were to shift with me to Joshua
[2:22] 1:es 1:5, it sounds very similar, but it
[2:25] says, "Now after the death of Moses, the
[2:28] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[2:30] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[2:32] of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[2:36] my servant is dead. Now therefore arise,
[2:39] go over this Jordan, thou and all this
[2:42] people unto the land which I do give
[2:45] them, even to the children of Israel.
[2:48] every place that the soul of your foot
[2:51] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[2:54] you, as I said unto Moses, from the
[2:57] wilderness and this Lebanon, even unto
[3:00] the great river, the river Euphrates,
[3:02] all the land of the Hittites, and unto
[3:04] the great sea, toward the going down of
[3:06] the sun shall be a coast. There shall
[3:09] not any man be able to stand before thee
[3:11] all the days of thy life. As I was with
[3:14] Moses, so I will be with thee. I will
[3:17] not fail thee nor forsake thee. Let's
[3:20] just bow our heads. Oh heavenly father,
[3:22] we've read your word, Lord. Lord, any
[3:25] man could read your scripture, Lord, but
[3:27] I pray that you would inspire it to us
[3:29] tonight, Lord. I pray that you will open
[3:30] it aresh to us, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[3:33] whatever be said, Lord, that you will
[3:35] guide it, Lord. Lord, I pray that these
[3:37] few broken up words here be stitched
[3:38] together seamlessly, Lord, the way you
[3:41] want to deliver, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[3:42] you would bless your people tonight.
[3:44] Speak lip to air to them. Take me out of
[3:46] the way, Lord, Lord, and use me just as
[3:48] as a mouthpiece tonight, Lord. That your
[3:50] word could go forth, Lord. Lord, I pray
[3:52] that when we leave this place, we will
[3:54] be better or worse, Lord. That you will
[3:56] stir our hearts, Lord. That you will
[3:58] drive us into action in Jesus name we
[4:00] pray. Amen.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; You love the word.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I read three scriptures and to some
[4:11] it may sound like I'm reading the same
[4:12] thing. different parts of the Bible the
[4:14] same thing. But I want to start with a
[4:17] simple point
[4:20] and I will start by giving my title
[4:22] actually for a title. The mission must
[4:25] be completed.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; The mission must be completed.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; For an inspiration not without a fight.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be simple. It's not
[4:40] going to be a walk in the park. not
[4:42] without a fight, but the mission must be
[4:44] completed.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Now, if if you could picture this now,
[4:49] &gt;&gt; God in speaking to Abraham, the angel
[4:52] came down. God provided a ram and there
[4:54] was a sacrifice made and he said,
[4:56] "Listen,
[4:59] I'm going to deliver the people of
[5:01] Israel. I'm going to take them to a good
[5:04] land.
[5:06] I am going to take them to a land that
[5:08] have giants in it." He probably didn't
[5:10] say it like that. He said, "A place of
[5:12] the Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[5:14] Amorites and the Perizzites and the
[5:16] Hivites and the Jebusites." But later on
[5:19] we see when speaking to Moses, he said,
[5:21] "Listen, I want you to take them there.
[5:24] The same thing I promised before, I want
[5:26] you to carry them through and he
[5:29] described the same place to Moses.
[5:32] Subsequent to that, Moses would have
[5:34] passed.
[5:36] So Abraham would have passed. Moses
[5:38] would have passed and Joshua was on the
[5:41] scene. He said, "As I was with Moses,
[5:43] the promise is still the same. It
[5:46] doesn't matter that that that Moses
[5:48] died. The mission must be accomplished.
[5:52] I will come down myself and fulfill my
[5:56] word."
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it doesn't matter the
[5:59] circumstance. It does matter once God
[6:01] promised it, it will come to pass.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; So he could use whoever he want. Amen.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; So here we see God made a promise to to
[6:09] Abraham
[6:10] &gt;&gt; to be able to possess a p a a certain
[6:13] inheritance to be able to to to inhabit
[6:16] a particular place.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; And at the same time he said listen it
[6:20] not finished yet. Moses I want you to
[6:23] take them out of Egypt and take them to
[6:26] the same place that I promised them that
[6:29] are promised that they will they they
[6:31] will be able to occupy and possess.
[6:34] Don't mind it have Canaanites and
[6:35] Hittites and Jebusites in it. That is
[6:37] still the promise that I made to you.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; And even if you die,
[6:42] &gt;&gt; I will raise up a man. This was Moses
[6:44] minister. And we still must complete the
[6:48] promise I made. I still want more people
[6:50] to come here and possess the land. So it
[6:54] doesn't matter if you worship tonight.
[6:56] It doesn't matter if you praise tonight.
[6:58] He will he will raise up persons to
[7:01] worship and praise. He will raise up his
[7:03] seeds. He will raise up the
[7:06] predestinated bride to to be able to
[7:08] take the word and accept it and hand IT
[7:10] THERE AND SLICE AND CUT. AMEN.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Speaking about Joshua in s we would see
[7:18] Jesus paragraph 32 brother Brandham said
[7:21] brother footprints is possession.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Minister and brethren don't be afraid to
[7:26] put footprints where God has told you to
[7:28] go. Amen. It's possession. He told
[7:31] Joshua, "Everywhere the souls of your
[7:33] feet set, that's yours.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Every promise he leave, every promise he
[7:38] laid down, EVERY PROMISE EXPRESSED,
[7:40] THAT'S YOURS. BUT YOU HAVE TO POSSESS
[7:42] IT. SO YOU HAVE TO STEP ON IT. YOU HAVE
[7:45] TO WALK ON IT. YOU HAVE TO GO and
[7:47] experience it." Amen. He said, "Don't
[7:49] back up. We take what God said and
[7:51] that's the truth. No matter what the
[7:53] opposition is, how great it seems, and
[7:56] how DIFFICULT IT SEEMS." THAT SOUND LIKE
[7:58] FIGHTING TO ME. IT SOUND LIKE YOU WILL
[8:01] FACE SOME RESISTANCE. IT SOUND LIKE
[8:03] listen that you need to stand and you
[8:05] need to withstand. It sounds like you
[8:07] can't just be on the defense. You need
[8:09] to be on the attack BECAUSE HE SAY NO
[8:11] MATTER HOW GREAT THE OPPOSITION SEEMS,
[8:14] HOW DIFFICULT IT SEEMS, IF GOD SAID SO,
[8:17] IT'S YOURS.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; So healing is MINE TONIGHT, IT DOESN'T
[8:21] MATTER WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, listen to this. It says
[8:29] when he gave it to Joshua, he never
[8:31] said, "I'll take all all the Habites and
[8:33] Philistines and give it to you."
[8:37] Joshua had to fight for every inch.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Every inch of ground. But God was with
[8:42] him. And every inch of ground you'll
[8:44] cover, brother, to make footprints,
[8:47] you'll fight your way through.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; So, you're not going to become
[8:50] victorious WITHOUT A FIGHT. YOU HAVE TO
[8:53] FIGHT YOUR WAY through in order to
[8:55] possess this land.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; But take the sword of the spirit,
[8:59] brother, and move right on. Footprints
[9:01] is possession. No matter how simple, how
[9:05] triv listen, deliverance is yours
[9:08] tonight. You know,
[9:09] &gt;&gt; healing is yours tonight. BUT YOU HAVE
[9:11] TO POSSESS IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BECAUSE
[9:14] LISTEN, Satan is not going to sit back
[9:17] and say, "Look, look, they're winning.
[9:20] Look, you see the sons of God are
[9:22] rising. You see, they're moving on to
[9:25] perfection. No, no, no, no, no. He's not
[9:28] going to rock back. Let's expose them
[9:30] tonight. He is going to do what it takes
[9:33] to derail you, to distract you, to
[9:36] discourage you, to frustrate you, to
[9:39] drive you, and and and make sure you
[9:42] have a mental health crisis. He want you
[9:44] to start to feel like you're going
[9:46] crazy. He want you START TO DOUBT. HE
[9:49] WANT YOU TO START TO live in fear. He
[9:51] want you to be overly CONCERNED ABOUT
[9:53] THINGS THAT MAY not concern you.
[9:55] Remember, his job is to steal, to kill,
[9:58] to destroy, to derail and distract.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; He want to steal your joy.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; He want to steal your peace tonight.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; He want to KILL YOUR POTENTIAL.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; HE want to kill your prayer life. He
[10:12] want to destroy your family. He want to
[10:15] destroy your marriage. He want to
[10:17] destroy your relationships. He is out to
[10:21] get you. He's not going to leave you
[10:23] alone. When he talk about Job, what he
[10:25] say? He was moving to and fro. He was
[10:28] busy. Listen, he not taking vacation or
[10:31] no. He not taking time off and sick
[10:33] leave. The devil is seeking to see who
[10:36] he could devour. He's seeing who he
[10:38] could attack. He is coming to to look
[10:40] for chinks IN YOUR ARMOR. HE'S COMING TO
[10:43] see where you have weak points. He's
[10:46] coming to ensure that he could probe you
[10:48] and poke YOU AND MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.
[10:52] That that's his role.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; We not vex for that or know that's him
[10:56] doing his role.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. But listen,
[11:00] greater is he that is in you tonight.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; God has promised that listen, no matter
[11:06] what the opposition looks like, you will
[11:09] be victorious.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; You will overcome. You know why? The
[11:12] battle is not yours. When David saw
[11:15] Goliath, Goliath seemed like a great
[11:18] opposition. He seemed LIKE A BIG BAD
[11:21] WOLF, A BIG OPPOSITION COMING AGAINST
[11:24] THE ARMIES of the living God. AND DAVID
[11:26] SAW HIM AND SAY, "LISTEN, when he got a
[11:28] revelation that the battle was the Lord,
[11:31] they said David ran in haste. HE WAS SO
[11:34] CONVINCED. HE HAD A TESTIMONY. He had a
[11:38] A PERSONAL REVELATION THAT THIS BATTLE
[11:41] WASN'T AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. THIS
[11:43] BATTLE WAS ORCHESTRATED BY JEHOVAH. AND
[11:47] GUESS WHAT? IF YOU FAST FORWARD THIS
[11:49] FILM, Jesus gets the victory.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Victory belongs to Jesus. He is the
[11:56] mighty conqueror. He is the prince of
[11:58] peace. HE'S THE EVERLASTING FATHER. HE'S
[12:01] THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. HE IS THE ROSE
[12:04] OF SHARON. HE IS THE BRIGHT AND MORNING
[12:06] STAR. SO NO DEMON, NO DEVIL, LISTEN, NO
[12:11] SATAN COULD COME AND defeat you. HE
[12:14] COULD CHALLENGE YOU. HE COULD STAND UP
[12:16] AGAINST YOU. HE COULD OPPOSE YOU. HE
[12:19] COULD TRY TO SHAKE YOU AND SHIFT YOU AND
[12:21] THROW YOU OFF. BUT HE WILL NOT GET THE
[12:24] VICTORY. Victory belongs to Jesus.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Listen. Moses Moses had a commission. He
[12:36] went and he saw the burning bush. And
[12:38] God said, "Listen, I've heard the cries
[12:39] of my people." And we know the story. We
[12:41] heard it over and over. I've heard the
[12:43] cries of my people, but keep in mind, he
[12:46] still had a promise. He promised to
[12:48] deliver them and carry them to this
[12:49] land.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Since Abrahamic days, he said, "Listen,
[12:53] this is the place you will occupy. This
[12:56] is the place your seed will occupy. This
[12:58] is THE PLACE THAT THAT generation after
[13:00] generation will occupy. You may not see
[13:03] it today, but I see it by vision and I
[13:06] could tell YOU THEY'LL OCCUPY IT. BY
[13:07] FAITH, I KNOW THEY'LL OCCUPY IT. SO
[13:10] Moses was commissioned to bring them out
[13:12] of Egypt because he said they will
[13:14] sjourn in a strange land as slaves.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; So they spent 400 years in slavery.
[13:22] The thing about it,
[13:24] I have a feeling that because of the
[13:27] experience between Moses and Pharaoh,
[13:30] Pharaoh had to know. He had to know that
[13:34] something was up when this excon, this
[13:37] ex criminal came and said, "Let my
[13:39] people go." Because normal people don't
[13:41] do that.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Criminals tend to hide. They want to be
[13:45] obscure. They want to to live in the
[13:47] shadows. So for this man to boldly come
[13:50] and say listen I am sent me. Let my
[13:54] people go with boldness AND CONFIDENCE.
[13:57] PHARAOH HAD TO KNOW THAT THIS MAN WAS
[14:00] SERIOUS. THIS MAN HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH
[14:03] GOD. SO I KNOW YOUR BOSS HAVE TO KNOW
[14:05] THAT AFTER ALL THEY DO. WHEN YOU WALK
[14:08] WITH CONFIDENCE, WHEN YOU WALK IN POWER,
[14:11] KNOWING THAT YOU HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH
[14:14] GOD, YOUR NEIGHBOR HAD TO KNOW THERE WAS
[14:17] SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU. YOUR
[14:19] FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS HAD TO KNOW THAT
[14:22] SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT. THAT YOU
[14:24] WEREN'T THE SAME AS YOU WAS YESTERDAY.
[14:26] YOU MAY NOT BE what you want to be, BUT
[14:28] THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU USED to
[14:30] be. Amen. PHARAOH HAD TO KNOW SOMETHING
[14:34] WAS DIFFERENT. IMAGINE. Just imagine for
[14:37] a second Moses came and you saw one
[14:39] plague. You see water turn to blood. YOU
[14:42] SEE FLIES. YOU SEE FROST. YOU SEE BOILS
[14:44] AND so on. Plague after plague after
[14:47] plague. I think it's safe to say it
[14:52] would be safe to assume that Moses knew
[14:56] the time was at hand. Moses knew this
[14:59] wasn't normal living.
[15:01] Moses knew that God was fixing to move
[15:06] plague after plague. He may have been
[15:07] surprised at first. He see the snake. He
[15:10] see the rod turn to a snake.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; He himself, he would look on and he say,
[15:14] "Listen, this is not the norm. This is
[15:17] not what I'm ACCUSTOMED TO. SOMETHING
[15:19] HAVE TO HAPPEN. THIS IS COMING TO A
[15:21] CLIMAX." But but just picture Pharaoh
[15:23] now.
[15:25] Pharaoh was observing. He noticed, okay,
[15:28] Moses
[15:30] staff turned into a snake and ate up the
[15:33] snakes of his men.
[15:36] From a distance, he saw the water turned
[15:37] to blood. From a distance, he saw flies
[15:41] and frogs and so on. He saw plague after
[15:44] plague, and he saw the climax when the
[15:47] firstborn was being killed. He would
[15:50] have witnessed this. And as a man that
[15:53] would have studied because you couldn't
[15:55] be Pharaoh Jessu. You had to go to
[15:57] school. You had to have tutors. You had
[15:59] to have governors. You had to study
[16:01] history and mathematics and leadership.
[16:03] Amen. After all that, can you imagine?
[16:09] He looked at them and he said, "You know
[16:11] what? This is it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go
[16:16] ahead. I give up.
[16:19] This is the last straw. There's nothing
[16:22] more I could do. But remember,
[16:24] &gt;&gt; victory belongs to Jesus.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; God is not satisfied with the enemy
[16:30] giving up.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; I don't serve a God that allows you to
[16:33] win by default.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; He don't want your win by default. He
[16:37] don't want the enemy didn't show up so
[16:39] by default you get the victory.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; The enemy get little fed up and allow
[16:43] you to go. No. So here's what the Bible
[16:45] said. In the Bible it said God hardened
[16:49] the heart of Pharaoh.
[16:51] Because God had a point to prove.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; He wanted beyond a shadow of a doubt
[16:56] like in court where they say beyond
[16:58] reasonable doubt. He wanted to ensure
[17:02] &gt;&gt; that you know that I know that this is
[17:05] God business.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; This is not by might. This is not by my
[17:10] power and MY STRENGTH BUT BY his spirit.
[17:13] AND AS SUCH HE HARDENED THE HEART OF
[17:16] PHARAOH and he said you know what I know
[17:19] I tell them to go ahead I tell them take
[17:22] everything I tell them take the cattle
[17:25] take the you know all the beasts take
[17:28] all their belongings take the clothes
[17:30] the shoes whatever they could move with
[17:32] I tell them to go because I felt it was
[17:35] about time to do so but when God
[17:37] hardened his heart
[17:40] &gt;&gt; there was a change at that point
[17:42] &gt;&gt; God was just getting started. You know,
[17:45] you may have thought it was about the
[17:46] plaguesh, but this was the final
[17:48] showdown.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; A final showdown has to come.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; It's not for your natural eye to see,
[17:55] but God was setting up this play to get
[17:58] checkmate in a game of chess. He wasn't
[18:00] playing checkers. He wanted checkmate.
[18:03] So, he said, "Listen, let me harden his
[18:04] heart. Let me allow him and read the
[18:07] Bible. It says Pharaoh got every chariot
[18:11] he could find. He didn't take a few, you
[18:13] know, he didn't take some some
[18:14] supervisory chariots, just three or four
[18:17] to chase them down and watch them. No,
[18:19] it say he got all. And he got men. He
[18:23] got captains. He got men with leadership
[18:26] qualities, trained, experienced men to
[18:29] ride THESE CHARIOTS AND FOLLOW THEM into
[18:32] the sea.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; But you see, God made a way. And when
[18:36] God made a way for you, that way was
[18:38] predestinated for you. It wasn't
[18:41] predestinated for the enemy. But what he
[18:44] created for you was for you to escape.
[18:46] That way of escape was really
[18:49] destruction of THE ENEMY. THAT'S WHY IT
[18:51] WENT ON TO say the Egyptians you see
[18:54] today, you're going to see no more
[18:56] forever. SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE WAY
[18:59] I FEEL TODAY, I'm not going to feel
[19:02] anymore. The thing that held you bound,
[19:04] THE THING THAT HELD YOU CAPTIVE, TODAY
[19:06] IS THE LAST DAY FOR THAT. YOU MEAN THAT
[19:09] DEPRESSION HAVE TO GO TODAY? YOU MEAN
[19:11] THAT FRUSTRATION HAVE TO GO TODAY? YOU
[19:14] MEAN THAT THAT FEELING OF GREED, THAT
[19:16] FEELING OF ANXIETY, THAT FEELING OF
[19:19] BACKBITING, THAT FEELING OF FRUSTRATION
[19:21] HAVE to disappear today forever? He
[19:24] could do it. HE DID IT FOR THEM. HE TELL
[19:27] THEM, "LISTEN, WATCH FOR THEM." You see
[19:29] them? You see those Egyptians? The ones
[19:32] that used to beat you. The ones you
[19:34] thought you had to slave over. THE ONES
[19:36] YOU THOUGHT YOU had to serve forever, as
[19:38] of today, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM NO
[19:41] MORE. FOREVER.
[19:44] It went on to say,
[19:47] Moses said, listen to Moses now in
[19:50] Exodus 14 verse 13. And I love this. He
[19:53] say, fear not. Fear ye not. Stand still.
[19:59] In other words, this is not about you.
[20:02] This is not about you and what you do
[20:04] and and you feeling to move a particular
[20:06] way. He says stand still. See the
[20:08] salvation of the Lord
[20:11] &gt;&gt; which he will show you today,
[20:14] &gt;&gt; not tomorrow. Today for the Egyptians
[20:16] whom you have seen today, you shall see
[20:19] them again no MORE FOREVER. BUT VERSE
[20:22] 14, here's what it says. THE LORD SHALL
[20:24] FIGHT for you and ye shall hold your
[20:27] peace. So that tells me, LISTEN, THIS
[20:30] BATTLE IS NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD.
[20:33] IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR
[20:35] MIGHT. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR POWER AND how
[20:37] you feel. He will do the battle for you.
[20:40] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET STARTED AND HE
[20:43] WILL do the rest.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of the three Hebrew boys.
[20:53] No matter what in scripture, WHEN YOU'RE
[20:56] ABOUT TO GET THE VICTORY,
[20:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; they turn up the heat a little bit. They
[21:00] turn up the fight a little bit.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew boys were were boys.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; They serve the Lord with innocence.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; They believe what they believe by faith
[21:10] and they held on to that.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; They stood firmly on that.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; When challenged and the king said,
[21:15] "Listen, if you don't bow down, we're
[21:18] going to heat the furnace seven times
[21:20] hotter."
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:23] Come on.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; They stood their ground.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; They stood up. They probably considered
[21:29] what he said and said, "Listen, I think
[21:30] this is an appropriate response. The God
[21:33] we serve is more than able to deliver
[21:35] us.
[21:36] But in the event in the unlikely event
[21:41] in the given the circumstance if for any
[21:44] particular reason perhaps there is some
[21:47] kind of flaw in our communication today
[21:50] and he's unable to come and deliver us.
[21:53] We have decided that we are still not
[21:56] going to bow to your request. We are not
[21:58] going to bow to worship you. We are not
[22:01] going to serve you how you believe we
[22:03] should. We are not going to go in the
[22:05] places you think we should. We're not
[22:08] going to drink your drinks. We're not
[22:10] going to eat your food. We going to
[22:12] stand our position because this is what
[22:13] we believe. So, we're not GOING TO CUT
[22:15] OUR HAIR. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WEAR THE
[22:17] MINISKIRT BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED THAT
[22:20] EVEN IF you don't deliver, we are not
[22:22] going to give in. We not going to GIVE
[22:24] UP. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. WE'RE
[22:27] GOING TO STAND ON OUR FAITH. STAND IN
[22:29] OUR belief because WE BELIEVE THAT THE
[22:32] PROMISE WE HOLD ON TO IS MADE BY GOD AND
[22:36] IF GOD COULD PROMISE IT, HE WILL BRING
[22:38] IT TO PASS. SO WE SAYING HERE UNTIL
[22:42] BETTER COME WE STANDING on this AND
[22:44] GUESS WHAT WE KNOW THE STORY BEFORE LONG
[22:47] THEY SAY THE MEN who threw them in were
[22:49] burnt. IT WAS SO HOT THEY THEMSELVES
[22:52] WERE BURNT. But when there was the
[22:56] FOURTH MAN IN THE FIRE and the king
[22:58] ordered them to come out, they said not
[22:59] even the smoke was ON THEM. THEY SAID
[23:02] NOT EVEN THE SMELL OF SMOKE WAS ON THEIR
[23:04] CLOTHES. He is such AN AWESOME GOD. HE
[23:07] IS SUCH A PROTECTOR. HE WANTED TO ENSURE
[23:10] THAT MAN COULDN'T TAKE THE GLORY. HE
[23:13] WANTED TO ENSURE THAT MAN COULDN'T TAKE
[23:15] THE PRAISE. So when they WALK BACK OUT,
[23:18] THEY COULD WALK IN CONFIDENCE KNOWING
[23:20] THAT THIS victory belonged to Jesus.
[23:23] THAT NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHAT THE
[23:26] OPPOSITION, NO MATTER WHAT THE
[23:28] CIRCUMSTANCE, HE IS GOING to deliver.
[23:31] THEY MAY HAVE HAD A FIGHT. THEY MAY HAVE
[23:34] HAD OPPOSITION, but he is able to
[23:36] DELIVER THEM AND BRING THEM THROUGH.
[23:38] AMEN.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, nobody said it
[23:42] was going to be easy.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; You weren't promised a easy ride, a easy
[23:47] journey. God has no spoiled children.
[23:50] It's natural for us to say, you know,
[23:53] child, you know, I love you so much. And
[23:54] you lift them up and you give them
[23:55] things. And God loves you,
[23:57] &gt;&gt; but he don't love your shipping.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; He want you to be trained. So, it's one
[24:01] thing to be a son. And yes, you're a son
[24:03] and you're a daughter and that sounds
[24:04] good. But when it comes to adoption,
[24:06] &gt;&gt; he don't just take you and pull you
[24:08] through and say, "Hey, that's my son, so
[24:10] you get a pass." He said, "No, he put
[24:12] you under tutors and governors. He give
[24:14] you classes and guidance cuz he want you
[24:16] to have wisdom. He want you to have
[24:18] experience." It even says Jesus learns.
[24:20] He had to learn obedience by the things
[24:22] that he suffered.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; He had to go through. And guess what he
[24:26] said? To as many as I love, I rebuke and
[24:28] chasen.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; So he don't want you to say the same and
[24:31] just say, "Bless me, Lord. I'm I'm good.
[24:32] I'm fine." No. He said, "Listen, if you
[24:35] bring forth fruit, he want to prune you.
[24:37] He want to cut you. He want to bend you
[24:40] because he want you to bring forth more
[24:41] fruit. He want productivity. He want
[24:45] multiplication.
[24:46] He want to see YOU CAN APPLY THE
[24:48] PROMISES TO YOUR life and see abundance.
[24:51] HE SAID, "I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT have
[24:53] life and HAVE IT MORE ABUNDANTLY, NOT
[24:56] LIVE LIKE everybody else."
[24:58] &gt;&gt; He want you to live a particular way. He
[25:00] wanted to walk a particular way. Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; David, sorry, Daniel.
[25:08] Daniel,
[25:10] &gt;&gt; was an interesting guy. Yes.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; He had such a close relationship with
[25:16] God that he prayed all the time.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; You pray all the time.
[25:22] Daniel prayed and and you know what it
[25:24] says? It says while he prayed, the angel
[25:27] of of the Lord was fighting.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; It said not without a fight. The angel
[25:33] didn't just come and say, "Daniel,
[25:34] because of you, I just want to show up
[25:36] on the scene." No. The angel had to
[25:38] fight
[25:39] serious demons to come
[25:42] &gt;&gt; in order to come to his rescue, to come
[25:44] to his aid. He had to do something and
[25:47] the angel was working on the next side.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; So he had to pray and the angel had to
[25:53] fight. IF HE STOPPED PRAYING, the angel
[25:55] stopped fighting. So what you think we
[25:57] have to do?
[26:00] &gt;&gt; What about us?
[26:02] &gt;&gt; The victory is guaranteed or know
[26:04] &gt;&gt; but not without a fight. YOU HAVE A JOB
[26:06] TO DO. You have a task and a role to do.
[26:10] You have something to do tonight. You
[26:13] have something to do tomorrow. Right?
[26:15] Like Daniel in a in a message at thy
[26:18] word, paragraph 54, it said, "So what
[26:19] happened?" Here's what it was. The angel
[26:22] of the Lord who had spoke the word was
[26:24] coming through the neighborhood
[26:25] confirming his word.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes they can't get on a spury
[26:31] moment.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; So you pray and you didn't hear the
[26:34] answer today. So what sometimes they
[26:37] can't come at the spur of the moment
[26:39] Daniel prayed the angel said it was 21
[26:42] days I believe before is that right
[26:45] before he got to him now we must
[26:47] remember it's God but when God had said
[26:50] anything it's the truth
[26:52] &gt;&gt; hold right onto IT IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN IF
[26:55] you're weakened then unbelief will take
[26:57] over but you stay with the word of God
[26:59] you remember that guy came through the
[27:01] prayer line brother Brian ministry and
[27:04] he said,
[27:06] "You're going to see." He was blind
[27:09] and he came back and he had doubt in his
[27:11] heart and his faith had none to hold on
[27:13] to.
[27:14] And he sold the paper and say, "Extra,
[27:16] extra, read all about it." Familiar
[27:18] story. And while in the barber shop, he
[27:21] was just anointing his feet,
[27:24] &gt;&gt; anointing it, anointing it, anointing
[27:26] it. It wasn't easy, you know. He didn't
[27:28] come through a prayer line and he walk
[27:29] out, I could see, blessed be the name of
[27:31] the Lord. He had a process to go through
[27:35] &gt;&gt; and while he was anointing it and
[27:37] testifying about it, it happened like
[27:39] that.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden it happened.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; After a while, all of a sudden it
[27:46] happened. So Daniel was praying and the
[27:48] angel was fighting and all of a sudden
[27:50] the angel show up and it happened. But
[27:53] it took A FIGHT. IT TOOK a process. It
[27:54] took some work to get there.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; What about you and I tonight? Listen,
[28:03] when Jacob
[28:06] &gt;&gt; was a shy, right? He was a smart man, as
[28:08] we would say. When Jacob was around,
[28:10] listen, he wanted the birthright. As we
[28:12] know,
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Jacob thought he was the smartest man
[28:15] around.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Until he had to come come face to face
[28:19] with himself.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; There came a time in which he said, "You
[28:22] know what? I want to appease my brother
[28:24] Esau cuz I know what I did. I know
[28:26] myself. I could look in the mirror and I
[28:28] know I know good. I'd do what I had to
[28:31] do. I know it didn't sound right. It
[28:33] didn't look good, but this is me being
[28:36] me.
[28:38] Still thinking in his humanness, he
[28:40] said, "Listen, let me send some gifts.
[28:43] Let me send some presents. Let me see if
[28:45] I could appease my brother because I
[28:47] feel my brother hate me. I feel he don't
[28:50] like me. I feel he had problems with
[28:52] me." And for good reason. I know what I
[28:55] did and he know what I did. He even sent
[28:57] different camps out and he said listen
[29:01] present him with presents and tell him I
[29:03] just behind send one out two out three
[29:06] out it didn't matter how much you sent
[29:08] know Esau not budging because this is my
[29:11] wicked brother
[29:13] &gt;&gt; this is my brother who steal the
[29:14] birthright who fake and forge his way
[29:17] into getting it.
[29:20] So he have a serious problem until one
[29:23] day
[29:24] &gt;&gt; the Bible gives an account and says he
[29:26] sent his wife, his family, his his
[29:29] cattle, everything away. And the Bible
[29:32] says Jacob was left alone.
[29:35] He alone just like you and I alone.
[29:40] But it didn't stop there. When he was
[29:44] left alone, he had to come face to face
[29:46] with himself.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Alone. Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; At some point you will come face to face
[29:52] with yourself
[29:54] &gt;&gt; alone. No matter how busy you are, no
[29:57] matter how much you run and you hide and
[29:58] you play and you fuss, you have to come
[30:01] face to face with yourself.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; You and you alone.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; And at that moment, he realized how
[30:07] fickle he was, how weak he was, how
[30:11] undone he was. And he had an experience
[30:14] with an angel.
[30:17] It says he wrestled all night.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; And he was determined. He was resilient.
[30:23] He listen, no matter what happened, he
[30:25] wasn't going to let go. It said the
[30:27] angel pushed and ensured that listen,
[30:32] his hip was out of joint and he still
[30:35] wasn't letting go. The daytime was
[30:38] coming. Day was about to break and he's
[30:40] still not letting go.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Talk about fight. THIS IS THE FIGHT HE
[30:45] HAD TO GO THROUGH.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; He and the angel alone. He said,
[30:48] "Listen, I not even letting you go under
[30:51] any circumstance unless you bless me
[30:54] because I reached the point where I
[30:56] realized I can't go to church and go
[30:58] back home the same way anymore. I can't
[31:01] go to church every Sunday and Wednesday
[31:03] and Friday and convention and and this
[31:05] and that and the other anymore. Tonight,
[31:08] tonight, tonight, I'm not going to let
[31:10] you GO UNTIL YOU BLESS ME." LIKE THAT
[31:13] MAN WHO SAID, "IF YOU DON'T CENTER IN,
[31:15] YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MY BONES RIGHT
[31:16] HERE.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU BLESS ME, I'M NOT GOING TO LET
[31:20] YOU GO. I'm not going to leave you
[31:22] alone."
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Until the angel could say, "Listen,
[31:27] &gt;&gt; take win.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; We started to fight as Jacob,
[31:33] &gt;&gt; but you're going to have a name change.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to be Israel from now on."
[31:38] After that experience,
[31:41] you could have seen this wasn't the same
[31:43] man that went into the fight.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; This wasn't the same man that was face
[31:48] to face with himself because he had an
[31:50] individual experience by himself with
[31:53] the angel.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane
[32:00] &gt;&gt; and we know the story prophets that that
[32:03] is where he conquered.
[32:05] That is where he understood that it
[32:08] wasn't about him. It wasn't about his
[32:11] will. It wasn't about his feelings and
[32:14] his his experience and how traumatic it
[32:17] would have been to have been crucified.
[32:20] He knew he came for a purpose. He knew
[32:23] he came to be that bridge to ensure that
[32:28] we could accept redemption.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; He knew his blood had to be shed. So he
[32:33] say listen if it were possible
[32:36] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass
[32:39] &gt;&gt; but not my will
[32:41] &gt;&gt; that was a fight for him.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Now he was going to get the victory you
[32:44] know
[32:45] &gt;&gt; but not without a fight
[32:48] &gt;&gt; not without a fight.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; No matter what happened
[32:53] he knew the mission had to be completed.
[32:56] He had to go and die for us
[33:00] &gt;&gt; for you and I. It wasn't by any means a
[33:03] easy walk. It wasn't an easy journey. IT
[33:07] WASN'T WITHOUT A FIGHT. BUT HE HAD TO GO
[33:09] through to get the victory.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; He couldn't get the victory just walking
[33:13] and talking and having a good time. IT
[33:16] HAD TO COME TO A FINAL SHOWDOWN WHEN HE
[33:19] COULD come face to face with death
[33:20] itself. Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; At that point, the mighty conqueror had
[33:28] prevailed
[33:30] &gt;&gt; on the cross.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; When they pierced it side and blood
[33:36] dripped down,
[33:39] he had the victory.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; The victory belonged to Jesus.
[33:44] No matter what, when the the skies
[33:48] turned black and the earth quaked and
[33:51] shook under the presence of Almighty
[33:54] God, the victory was won for you and I.
[33:58] That's why we here tonight.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; But it took a sacrifice. It took a
[34:02] price.
[34:04] This message is dripping with blood.
[34:05] When you think about it, through the
[34:07] dark ages, they try to boil it out. They
[34:10] try to burn it at the stake. They tried
[34:13] to even crucify them. They stoned them.
[34:17] They beat them, kill them. But you know
[34:19] what? They couldn't kill that seed.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; They couldn't kill that predestinated
[34:24] seed from coming forth
[34:27] &gt;&gt; no MATTER WHAT. NO MATTER HOW THEY FIGHT
[34:29] AND TRIED TO CRUSH IT,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; LUTHER FOUGHT and Wesley fought. THE
[34:34] PENTECOSTALS FOUGHT, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[34:36] FOUGHT.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; What about you and I in this day?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO FIGHT. NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT
[34:43] TONIGHT.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; There is no easy wins. There's no easy
[34:47] victory. We're not going to be
[34:49] victorious by chance. And we happen to
[34:52] get a good run. Listen, the the the
[34:55] enemy was real weak. You know, we went
[34:57] and beat them up. No, listen. The
[34:59] devices of the enemy
[35:02] are
[35:04] the crosshairs on you. you know,
[35:07] &gt;&gt; well trained on you. You know, if you
[35:10] don't have that full armor like
[35:12] Ephesians 6 describes, you're in
[35:14] trouble. You know,
[35:16] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE the helmet of
[35:18] salvation,
[35:19] &gt;&gt; the sword of the spirit, the shield of
[35:21] faith. You have to be listen, you need
[35:24] to be dressed for the occasion. This is
[35:26] not a jokey army. Listen, no, nobody
[35:28] enters the army because they they want
[35:30] to learn to match. That is for that is
[35:33] for cub scouts and school and thing you
[35:35] like to march so you doing march pass
[35:37] that that sports thing when it come to
[35:39] battle is training or no
[35:42] &gt;&gt; the objective of joining the army they
[35:45] don't enlist you and recruit you and
[35:47] they come and they make you run for
[35:49] miles and they tell you look discipline
[35:51] march push-ups handle guns whatever it
[35:54] is is not because they want independence
[35:58] parade or no
[36:00] they do that because They want you to be
[36:02] able to defend yourself and they want
[36:04] you to be able to attack.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; They know when called upon you need to
[36:08] be prepared.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Just like cub scout motors always be
[36:12] prepared.
[36:13] When the army recruits you and they put
[36:16] you through training is because they
[36:18] want in the event that they have to
[36:21] sound the alarm. You are well trained
[36:24] and you're ready.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Once you hear a certain sound, you could
[36:28] respond.
[36:29] Just like the army of the Lord, the
[36:32] Christian soldiers, God wants, he want
[36:33] them well trained.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; He want them disciplined because there's
[36:38] going to be a final showdown.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A BATTLE.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; There is no way the the devil is not
[36:45] going to sit back and watch you and say
[36:47] them guys real well. No, look how
[36:49] they're walking up every step to
[36:50] perfection.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Remember the devil believe and tremble,
[36:56] you know.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. So as he see you trying to to
[37:00] listen, I want to to expand my faith. I
[37:03] want to practice the presence of God. I
[37:05] want to imp
[37:08] drawn closer to to the Lord. I want to
[37:10] delve deeper in the word. As you're
[37:12] doing that, listen, he have arrows. He
[37:15] have darts. He have all kind of thing he
[37:17] going to send your way. You know,
[37:20] &gt;&gt; he want to mash you up and know.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; He want to kill you if he can.
[37:24] But you are predestinated
[37:26] to beat him anywhere, any place, any
[37:29] under any condition, NO MATTER WHAT THE
[37:32] CIRCUMSTANCE, you were predestinated
[37:34] before the foundation of the world to
[37:36] conquer that. You know,
[37:41] &gt;&gt; you see a eagle is a eagle no matter
[37:43] what.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Even in a cage, a eagle is a eagle.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; The behavior is a is the same.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Even a wounded eagle is a eagle. or no
[37:52] &gt;&gt; when they see the storm they don't say
[37:53] they see me I really tired of this eagle
[37:55] thing I want to be a vulture I want to
[37:57] be a dove no it don't work so no it's
[38:00] innate innate means built in it's
[38:03] something in the inside that you can't
[38:05] take away the same way it's it's built
[38:07] into a believer have faith it built into
[38:10] the eagle TO STORE SO ABOVE THE STORM
[38:14] ABOVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE ABOVE YOUR
[38:17] CHALLENGE ABOVE YOUR PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU
[38:19] WERE BORN AN EAGLE
[38:21] LISTEN, you may have been caged for a
[38:23] while. You may have been tied up for a
[38:26] while, but when you hear mother eagle
[38:28] call,
[38:29] &gt;&gt; you know how to respond.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Just Sunday, brother preach. He said,
[38:34] "Listen, a cat says meow.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; A dog says roof.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; You can't make the dog say meow." No,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; the roof is built in.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; The meow is built into the cat. So the
[38:45] eagle it's built in the DNA that when
[38:49] the storm come I don't want to stay here
[38:51] as a matter of fact from birth when
[38:53] mother eagle decide to take it for that
[38:56] listen that virgin trip that very first
[38:59] experience and the wind blowing through
[39:02] the wings and the wings not quite strong
[39:04] enough they know it's builtin to fly you
[39:07] know when the mother eagle throw them
[39:10] off and shake them off mother eagle know
[39:12] that's my boy that's my girl At some
[39:14] point they will learn to fly. When they
[39:17] they they BRUSH ALL THE FEATHERS out the
[39:19] nest and make them uncomfortable and
[39:22] uneasy. They're not waiting and you come
[39:24] to church going to get a little juice or
[39:26] you got Bible or you get a hopspread.
[39:28] No, you know you come and you could take
[39:30] the word and you could hand it there AND
[39:33] YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. YOU KNOW
[39:35] WHEN to move. You listen, YOU'RE
[39:37] SPIRITUALLY MATURE. AT THAT STAGE, the
[39:40] mother eagle could watch you because
[39:42] THEY KNOW YOU TRIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK.
[39:44] YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME because it's built
[39:47] in. It doesn't go eagle school to learn
[39:50] to fly. You know, a bird doesn't run
[39:52] down the runway and take off like a
[39:54] plane because it's built in to operate a
[39:56] particular way. Just like that. You are
[39:59] eagle tonight. The fight IS BUILT IN.
[40:03] YOU ARE A BELIEVER TONIGHT. THE FIGHT IS
[40:06] BUILT IN.
[40:07] YOUR MISSION must be completed. IN A
[40:10] LITTLE WHILE, WE'LL REVISIT THE MISSION
[40:12] BECAUSE IT MUST BE COMPLETED. GOD
[40:14] DOESN'T START THINGS and don't finish. I
[40:17] showed you through history. He's told
[40:19] Abraham, "Listen, the land where the
[40:21] Canaanites and Jebusites and Hivites and
[40:23] Amorites are, that's where my people
[40:26] will be. THAT'S WHERE I'LL carry them."
[40:28] By the way, Abraham just had a son.
[40:31] Then, you know,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; he just almost sacrificed Isaac. And the
[40:36] angel say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[40:37] wait, wait, wait. I know you believe ME
[40:41] SO MUCH
[40:42] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE willing to do
[40:45] &gt;&gt; exactly as I say
[40:46] &gt;&gt; in obedience to the word
[40:48] &gt;&gt; so I trust you.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; I could show you more."
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Later on, when he told Moses, "Deliver
[40:55] my people,
[40:57] &gt;&gt; the promise was still unfolding." You
[40:59] know,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; it didn't matter time. So I know you
[41:04] read the quotes and you say but you know
[41:06] the quotes say and we in 2025 but you
[41:10] know it didn't matter.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; It's still the word
[41:13] &gt;&gt; the promise is the same yesterday, today
[41:15] and forever.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; His word don't change and God can't lie.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; So think about that.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; So the manifestation
[41:23] &gt;&gt; has to be close.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came to restore the
[41:28] faith. Yes sir. And I believe in the
[41:31] message of contest he said raise up
[41:33] mighty men,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; mighty warriors of the faith.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Warriors of the faith. He didn't say
[41:40] raise up men who could just go through
[41:42] the motion.
[41:44] The difference between a warrior and a
[41:46] warrior
[41:47] &gt;&gt; is the ability to fight. You know,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; warriors are men of war.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Are those who listen, they trained for
[41:54] this thing.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; They polishing boots whole day. They
[41:58] know to draw their sword quickly.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; They know the gun clean and loaded. They
[42:04] don't have to wonder, you know, I did
[42:06] that some time ago. I remember some time
[42:08] ago they talk about the virtues, you
[42:10] know, but I just can't put my finger on
[42:12] it. Not like that. They sharpen like
[42:15] mercenaries know. So, brother say,
[42:17] "Listen, raise up them kind of men in
[42:19] this hour because they have a job TO DO.
[42:22] THERE'S A FINAL show coming and he saved
[42:25] this battle for his best men for his
[42:28] best SONS AND DAUGHTERS THAT ARE TRAINED
[42:31] TO handle the word. Amen. He wants a
[42:34] church without spot or wrinkle. He
[42:37] looking for perfection and adoption. He
[42:40] looking to see those who could go
[42:41] THROUGH THE PROCESS, NOT LOOKING FOR THE
[42:44] SHORTCUT, WHO COULD UNDERSTAND the
[42:46] sacrifice and walk through, COULD
[42:48] UNDERSTAND THE FIGHT. And you spot the
[42:50] devil wherever he coming and you know
[42:52] you're ready for him. Just like David,
[42:55] listen, they say David didn't just run
[42:56] to Goliath. He run towards the army. I
[42:59] wasn't sure what he was up to. But he
[43:01] was so convinced he was going because he
[43:03] knew it wasn't him. He knew it was the
[43:05] Lord. He knew the Lord was with him. He
[43:08] was empowered to do what he did. It
[43:10] didn't matter if he swing slow, swing
[43:13] fast, if it was a big stone or small
[43:15] stone. Goliath was bound to fall. No
[43:18] matter what happened, your challenge
[43:21] tonight bound to be defeated or your
[43:23] your problem, your mind battle bound to
[43:26] fall because it's not about you, BUT
[43:29] YOUR FAITH IN HIS WORD, YOUR FAITH IN
[43:31] HIS PROMISE GOING TO MAKE IT MANIFEST.
[43:36] In the fourth seal it say wait till them
[43:37] seven thunders utter THEIR VOICES TO
[43:39] THAT group who really can take the word
[43:42] and hand IT THERE IT'LL SLICE AND CUT
[43:45] and it'll close THE HEAVEN. AMEN. THAT'S
[43:48] THE KIND OF GROUP WE'RE looking for. The
[43:50] group that could make a church that
[43:52] could make a REVIVAL THAT SIN CAN'T EVEN
[43:54] WALK IN IT. That listen if the sick come
[43:57] they will be healed. That nobody will
[43:59] leave the same way that THEY CAME.
[44:01] THAT'S WHAT we looking for.
[44:04] This battle is not yours. I'm not asking
[44:07] you to pick up arms. I'm asking you to
[44:09] pick up faith. I'm asking you to pick up
[44:12] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[44:14] patience and add godliness and brotherly
[44:17] kindness and charity, the absolutes to
[44:21] your life. So you'll realize it's not
[44:23] against flesh AND BLOOD, BUT AGAINST
[44:25] PRINCIPALITIES, against powers, AGAINST
[44:28] RULERS OF DARKNESS of this world,
[44:30] against spiritual wickedness IN HIGH
[44:32] PLACES. THAT'S WHAT WE FIGHTING AGAINST.
[44:34] The musician could get ready in in in
[44:36] the message, the greatest battle ever
[44:38] fought. Paragraph 149, it says, "The
[44:42] great hour of charge is at hand. It's
[44:44] not TIME TO PLAY. IT'S NOT TIME TO SLACK
[44:47] OFF. IT'S NOT TIME TO RELAX BECAUSE THE
[44:50] GREAT HOUR OF CHARGE IS AT HAND.
[44:52] HALLELUJAH. Soldier with armors
[44:56] gleaming, colors streaming, faith and
[44:59] doubt is setting yourself in array in
[45:02] this tabernacle this morning. And I said
[45:04] tonight, doubt on one side, faith on the
[45:07] other. Soldiers, stand at your POST OF
[45:11] DUTY. THAT'S YOUR COMMISSION. THAT'S the
[45:14] mission TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE SON OF
[45:17] MAN COMES HE COULD FIND THE SAME FAITH
[45:20] THAT WAS RESTORED UNTO THE SAINTS THAT
[45:22] when the holy spirit come that you could
[45:25] be magnetized to that absolute YOU CAN
[45:28] BE MAGNETIZED TO THAT WORD.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Listen it said soldier stand at your
[45:34] post of duty. Hallelujah. Our captain
[45:37] the morning star leads on. He never goes
[45:41] back. HE NEVER, HE DON'T KNOW THE word
[45:43] retreat. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BACK DOWN. WE
[45:46] HERE TO STAND UP AND FACE THE DEVIL EYE
[45:49] TO EYE, MANTO MAN WITH YOUR SWORD DRAWN
[45:53] WITH YOUR SWORD DRAWN BECAUSE YOU'RE
[45:55] READY FOR WAR. YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT
[45:58] BECAUSE YOU WANT THE VICTORY. You're not
[46:00] going to just sit down and wait for
[46:02] SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
[46:04] CAUSE SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. IT SAYS
[46:07] certainly the greatest battle ever
[46:09] fought. She is going on right IN HERE
[46:12] NOW, SIR. YES, SIR. Between life and
[46:15] death. Between sickness, you can play
[46:17] sound something softly. Between sickness
[46:19] and health, between faith and doubt. Oh
[46:23] my. BETWEEN LIBERTY AND BONDAGE, THE
[46:26] BATTLE IS ON. Shine your spear,
[46:28] soldiers. Polish up the armor. God is
[46:32] getting his soldiers ready. Amen. God
[46:34] anoints his army. God richly bless you.
[46:40] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[46:43] [Music]
[46:48] Thank you, Jesus.
[46:51] Thank you, lamb of God.
[46:55] Amen. Amen. You know your mission. You
[46:57] know your position.
[47:00] It's not going to be easy. It's not
[47:02] going to be without a fight, but he's
[47:04] going to get the victory.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] So it's not about you but about him.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Let's just lift our hands tonight.
