[1:01:01] spirits and angels behind watch and all
[1:01:05] the demons out of poor mint will never
[1:01:07] upset you
[1:01:08] god grant my brethren that with each one
[1:01:11] receive that blessing now we didn't say
[1:01:15] go and teach the word he said go and
[1:01:16] preach the gospel go teach the word no
[1:01:19] go preach the gospel and the word is the
[1:01:21] beginning like we see here or the
[1:01:23] forerunner of the gospel the word goes
[1:01:26] out and the gospel of the power of the
[1:01:29] demonstration of God follows the word
[1:01:32] and makes the word manifest so that's a
[1:01:36] what we striving for so people want to
[1:01:38] fight me because I started preaching us
[1:01:40] but yet noise that our body gets started
[1:01:43] 40 years like a started but we all
[1:01:45] guess either burned it or who get
[1:01:47] started already
[1:01:48] god bless them but we gonna get started
[1:01:50] or chlorine according the world reporter
[1:01:53] which power and after every service
[1:01:55] demons jamming right on the building as
[1:01:57] they come be backing them out as they
[1:02:00] can be cutting them off a sickness come
[1:02:02] with blowing it back push it back every
[1:02:06] service every time you believe that
[1:02:12] all glories are gone almost done he the
[1:02:16] world goes out the gospel of the power
[1:02:18] of demonstration of the God follows the
[1:02:20] word I mixed the word manifest that is
[1:02:22] the gospel and in order if man could
[1:02:25] preach the gospel the last word he said
[1:02:27] on what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:02:28] his power to us what he said they say
[1:02:30] the power was gone he said the power
[1:02:31] hasn't even arrived yet
[1:02:33] Oh glory to God hallelujah this city
[1:02:37] power God hallelujah the power gone
[1:02:40] before Eve Moravia God trying to prepare
[1:02:44] you for this power where they are you
[1:02:46] ready or not the power coming where
[1:02:48] every petal not be power coming
[1:02:50] Oh blowing up got the power in car
[1:02:53] blowing computer or the water space
[1:02:56] power to do support you what kind of
[1:02:58] things and a chisel lolly in some old
[1:03:01] power
[1:03:01] on old engine out there but the church
[1:03:03] gonna get that power dynamics what we
[1:03:06] are the preacher that's why we want you
[1:03:08] to be expecting it so when you come to
[1:03:10] service you come at a genuine
[1:03:12] expectation for the power of God to be
[1:03:14] loose to you
[1:03:15] okay just a few more hallelujah we have
[1:03:18] a specialty future this morning I listen
[1:03:20] to you it's not long so that's why I
[1:03:22] change something with you and Balarama
[1:03:24] saying let's add to our feet these
[1:03:25] things that we might comment the full
[1:03:27] search of Christ being joined together
[1:03:29] with godly love fear of God reference in
[1:03:32] our hearts to one another deep deep
[1:03:35] listen to this this is let's add to our
[1:03:39] feet these things then we might come in
[1:03:41] full statue of Christ being joined
[1:03:43] together with godly love fear of God so
[1:03:48] when somebody said I don't care that's a
[1:03:50] dangerous statement anytime you hear
[1:03:52] somebody's advocate watch them close
[1:03:55] what's that word please
[1:04:07] you have the key
[1:04:10] I'm talking about I care - the milkman I
[1:04:12] care how I treat the Cabot man I can't
[1:04:15] holler to the postman
[1:04:16] we can't don't want nobody misinterpret
[1:04:18] my behavior to have a way of seeing
[1:04:22] Christ because here no you don't care
[1:04:24] he's a Pharisee I don't care what if are

[1:04:44] didn't win a special glasses they could
[1:04:46] see superseded and see shocked i hain't
[1:04:49] care as a shock you can't see that
[1:04:53] because is a soul and when you pawn your
[1:04:55] glasses he solves all so looking for
[1:04:58] funding Christians but Solomon
[1:05:01] superseded Salah the son of God he I
[1:05:04] know that yetee riding high horses Ellis
[1:05:06] he sell us for his doctrine the language

[1:05:19] yourself you for your own life or your
[1:05:21] own ambition when is that I'm gonna flip

[1:05:24] everything on a walk so perfect for you
[1:05:26] you'll be shocked oh go go the whooping
[1:05:28] smoothed out for you yes because you're
[1:05:31] putting God first
[1:05:33] so let's he said I he said watch what a
[1:05:37] godly love you have God reverence in our
[1:05:40] heart to one another deep respect to one
[1:05:44] another brotherly and sisterly kindness
[1:05:47] never vulgarity nothing just purity of
[1:05:51] the Holy Ghost listen be a Christian
[1:05:54] walk with feet let the virtue of God
[1:05:57] flow through you let the knowledge of
[1:05:58] God when it comes to right and wrong is
[1:06:00] I imagine and never acting like us they
[1:06:03] were men of few words till they got in
[1:06:05] the pulpit
[1:06:05] they walked him done what he's supposed
[1:06:07] to do and walked out they had power they
[1:06:10] had thought you they had no arguments
[1:06:12] with men they know where they stood he
[1:06:15] said hall and warlin not from God they
[1:06:18] just do it as soon why
[1:06:19] how could they know it wasn't not from
[1:06:20] God they had all these virtues in here
[1:06:23] all these qualifications and the first
[1:06:26] rule none of God
[1:06:27] compared with everyone of this denote it
[1:06:29] was the Word of God and the widow went
[1:06:32] oh praise God
[1:06:34] so no board is eternal he was the
[1:06:36] perfect perfect love perfect peace
[1:06:38] perfect joy perfect satisfaction all
[1:06:40] those seven spirits as we get in
[1:06:42] Revelation and the only way we can come
[1:06:44] back to perfection is to come back to
[1:06:46] that perfection which is God so to come
[1:06:49] back to what the perfect spirit is not
[1:06:52] right
[1:06:52] no there are seven steps that goes to
[1:06:53] God this is what the prophecy on my
[1:06:57] steps just seven not twenty-seven
[1:07:01] several steps that goes to God for the
[1:07:04] seven spirits as it comes down seven
[1:07:07] steps comes down seven steps go up isn't
[1:07:11] that right now there are seven Church
[1:07:13] ages seven steps God building his church
[1:07:18] it's like one person into an individual
[1:07:21] into himself the glory the power of God
[1:07:24] coming down through this well in it
[1:07:27] together
[1:07:27] therefore the pinnacles of people let
[1:07:29] all the Lutheran let all the Wesleyan
[1:07:31] they doesn't know what they're talking
[1:07:32] about you see but the way some people
[1:07:34] can come up at that high and drop off
[1:07:37] aha let me get pet on the pyramid and
[1:07:40] it's getting narrow and top off what but
[1:07:43] there's a genuine part of that that
[1:07:45] keeps me big making the building come on
[1:07:48] some people talk about that feed some
[1:07:50] people keep dropping off dropping off
[1:07:51] dropping off but you have to keep
[1:07:53] pressing on up those seven steps almost
[1:07:55] done you know he said an Enoch sign in
[1:07:58] Egypt the pyramid and before the
[1:08:01] destruction and in that pyramid is seven
[1:08:04] steps going into the King's Chamber
[1:08:06] I myself watch on the seventh step if
[1:08:10] you ever study the dimensional pyramid
[1:08:12] what comes out to take the uncommon to
[1:08:15] introduce a king the king
[1:08:16] watch who station that is standing there
[1:08:19] and you will see the day you are living
[1:08:22] in the pyramid so he is prophesied that
[1:08:24] one day you want to come to the
[1:08:26] knowledge but you're living in the
[1:08:28] pyramid and there are seven steps to go
[1:08:31] into the presence of the King and you're
[1:08:34] gonna hit that seven step you know what
[1:08:36] that seven step is that's brotherly love
[1:08:38] that's the blood of the edge one day you
[1:08:41] gonna strike it by revelation by
[1:08:45] inspiration by manifestation and because
[1:08:48] when you stand praying you could forgive
[1:08:50] the Holy Spirit charity dynamics come
[1:08:54] upon you because you have the spirit of
[1:08:56] forgiveness the sweetness around the
[1:08:59] mother when she's about to bring birth
[1:09:01] which I bought to have but the sweetness
[1:09:03] of that anointing and Charlie coming
[1:09:06] upon that anointing upon your life or
[1:09:08] the bride will be live in brotherly
[1:09:10] kindness manifest in brotherly kindness

[1:13:24] I was glad when they said unto us and to

[1:13:32] the Lord then my subject today is coming
[1:13:35] to church isn't that beautiful
[1:13:38] what a nice subject and my inspiration
[1:13:40] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:13:43] Lord forever
[1:13:44] my isn't that your desire
[1:13:47] that's why I desire so I wanna just have
[1:13:50] it kept salgo but back so just pick up
[1:13:55] the caning since navien thinks it ought
[1:13:57] to be I send this to our church the
[1:14:00] smarty this is not the only way that you
[1:14:02] feel to be a son a daughter of God
[1:14:04] because you have to help eternal life in
[1:14:08] his only one form of eternal life and
[1:14:10] that's God's life only one form of
[1:14:13] eternal life and that was God there to
[1:14:17] be a son of God you had to be in him
[1:14:19] always the gene of your life spiritual
[1:14:22] life tonight was eco the Father before
[1:14:25] there was even a molecule and you are
[1:14:27] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:14:29] gene of life it was in God as a son of
[1:14:33] God and you exist after his word is
[1:14:36] coming to you to light up this age you
[1:14:39] express God's life in you because you're
[1:14:42] the son in daughter of God therefore you
[1:14:44] get what I mean
[1:14:45] congregation says amen you are it says
[1:14:48] you are now mate
[1:14:49] you said it says you sitting in this
[1:14:52] church tonight we said this morning
[1:14:54] because your duty is to express God to
[1:14:58] the solution and to the people of his
[1:15:01] neighborhood
[1:15:02] wait when you were so shy wherever you
[1:15:04] are God knew that you would be here
[1:15:07] because you have to be one of these
[1:15:10] genes all these attributes you had to be
[1:15:13] if you ever it says if you ever got
[1:15:16] eternal life then it was always eternal
[1:15:19] so you didn't come eternal the day you
[1:15:21] got saved of the day you gave your heart
[1:15:23] to the Lord or the day you met them as
[1:15:25] he says you are always eternal so in
[1:15:29] other words before you and your great
[1:15:31] grandmother and father came together you
[1:15:34] were already there now you mix orange
[1:15:37] you know what I'm saying
[1:15:38] now the German gets carried down all the
[1:15:40] ways so you were eternal before you your
[1:15:43] father and mother came together you are
[1:15:46] already there you are eternal he says
[1:15:49] and always was eternal life and God
[1:15:51] before there was a foundation the world
[1:15:53] knew that you would be here so if you
[1:15:56] see that then you realize what I got a
[1:15:58] great the purpose I'm not just here to
[1:16:00] to be in church and have a family and
[1:16:02] work and have a job no I'm here to
[1:16:05] express God to destination I am here to
[1:16:08] express God to my neighborhood on the
[1:16:11] job in the school adversity hallelujah
[1:16:14] you're an attribute of God God will take
[1:16:16] a great denominations apart he takes
[1:16:19] individuals apart speak to them this is
[1:16:21] in your him he says yeah he takes you
[1:16:24] apart and speak to you sometimes over in
[1:16:27] the closet when you feel led to go and
[1:16:29] you don't go then you might miss
[1:16:31] something so if you don't go to your
[1:16:33] closet to pray he says and if you don't
[1:16:35] go some as you feel led to go but you
[1:16:37] don't go he says you're gonna mess
[1:16:39] something and that's how these you feel
[1:16:42] led to go to church you don't go you
[1:16:44] miss something because God is imparting
[1:16:46] something don't want you to go to church
[1:16:49] you want you to manifest something to
[1:16:51] you through his word through some move
[1:16:54] that is making you fail to go and you
[1:16:57] must see something amen
[1:17:00] so that's the importance of coming to
[1:17:02] church we're trying to show the
[1:17:03] importance the reason we come we know
[1:17:05] Church don't save you the building or
[1:17:07] save you but there's something that God
[1:17:09] is doing in the church and this is easy
[1:17:11] imparting something and he says if you
[1:17:14] know that you gonna miss it and once
[1:17:17] it's gone is gone thank you brother gave
[1:17:20] recruited a nice message of thanks
[1:17:21] brother Gabriel I appreciated that put a
[1:17:23] nice message of the sermon of last week
[1:17:26] on his I don't know his profile in
[1:17:27] something and someone sent to me said I
[1:17:30] can mention my Peter James John come on
[1:17:32] the mountain of the Dead Mountain they
[1:17:34] would have missed that for nothing
[1:17:37] wish I had been there the prophecies
[1:17:40] says don't you
[1:17:44] and you wish you were there on the
[1:17:46] mountain when transfiguration he says
[1:17:49] here he says then he says you a position
[1:17:51] of a belief in Christ then just as sure

[1:19:07] on the altar and always but them Merry
[1:19:10] Christmas because they won't be back
[1:19:11] until next Esther I said because they
[1:19:14] just church members they just church
[1:19:19] members not born again so yet the
[1:19:22] prophets bringing a difference between
[1:19:24] people that's hungry for God they are
[1:19:26] born again but it says there's a
[1:19:28] difference and others why they why they
[1:19:31] do that because they church members now
[1:19:33] we know one church members we want
[1:19:35] born-again people you must say I am born
[1:19:38] again

[1:19:41] don't settle to be a message member I
[1:19:44] want to be a born-again member of the
[1:19:46] body of Jesus Christ hallelujah he says
[1:19:50] yeah and a man that's born of the spoon
[1:19:52] of God loves to go to church now he
[1:19:55] loves to go to church hallelujah brother
[1:19:58] there's something when you love to go to
[1:20:00] church my and nothing can teach you you
[1:20:03] love to go to church better then you
[1:20:05] says then he loves to eat his dinner you
[1:20:10] can love God more than you love your
[1:20:12] food and then there's something in you
[1:20:14] brother that even the food doesn't
[1:20:16] matter food or no food we showed last
[1:20:20] week shoes or no shoes if you come in
[1:20:22] with an overall it doesn't matter no one
[1:20:24] is gonna look down Moneo why but you
[1:20:27] come into church my more than the dinner
[1:20:33] when he's hungry the spiritual man on
[1:20:35] the inside has to be fed if that man
[1:20:38] isn't fair he will die so I'm gonna say
[1:20:42] friends you can't survive only by just
[1:20:44] coming to church on Sunday and Wednesday
[1:20:46] you gotta feed that man if you eat every
[1:20:49] day isn't it and reverse it every day
[1:20:52] some eats three meals some it's five
[1:20:54] meals but you feel that this nature made
[1:20:57] how much more the spiritual man has to
[1:21:00] survive brother you will read your Bible
[1:21:02] you wanna pray you're gonna read the
[1:21:05] spoken word you
[1:21:06] get into why you feel in the spiritual
[1:21:08] man hallelujah the Bible said Jesus told
[1:21:13] Satan in the debate he said it is
[1:21:16] written man shall not live by bread
[1:21:17] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:21:19] out of the mouth of God
[1:21:21] that's how man lives not by the bread
[1:21:23] alone but by the Word of God man lives
[1:21:26] he's out the man loves my British inward
[1:21:28] man lives by the bread of God Jesus and
[1:21:32] the bread of life that cometh down from
[1:21:34] the Father my Cillian position of the
[1:21:37] believer in Christ they just show us the
[1:21:38] church sign comes you just can't keep
[1:21:40] from coming to church you're just going
[1:21:42] to go if you have to hold okay that's
[1:21:45] the one we read so okay Souza is one of
[1:21:48] the most important days are they on
[1:21:49] Calvary of the days that God ever let
[1:21:52] down on the earth and if it's so
[1:21:54] important that the human race Calvary I
[1:21:56] think it's good for us to go back and
[1:21:58] examine see that what it means so we got
[1:22:02] to examine and see what did that day
[1:22:04] means to us for I'm sure that the slate
[1:22:07] power that we live in in now this was a
[1:22:10] breach in 60 and it's called it they're
[1:22:12] the late hours that we live in we are
[1:22:14] seeking every importance of God that we
[1:22:17] can know and and all that we can find
[1:22:20] out why we are here to learn of it to
[1:22:23] see what it is for us and what God has
[1:22:26] done for us and see what his promise to
[1:22:28] us for this day he says and that's what
[1:22:31] we come to church for to find out the
[1:22:34] hour the lateness the time we live in in
[1:22:36] how serious what is happening why is
[1:22:39] this going on and if I know most of the
[1:22:41] time is prophetic what you see that
[1:22:44] happening all day at the prophet
[1:22:45] prophesied
[1:22:46] what's happening this fools the pro
[1:22:48] football society what happening in the
[1:22:51] government that refer to society so you
[1:22:53] don't know the word now you wonder
[1:22:55] what's happening oh if you know the word
[1:22:57] you know the spoken word do you know the
[1:22:59] Bible then you know this must happen

[1:23:04] does fast take place so you don't get
[1:23:07] shaken you don't be back you realize
[1:23:09] thank you God I see the word fulfilled I
[1:23:12] see the power of God I mean back mind

[1:26:01] certainly with a difference for the car
[1:26:02] can never help you I can never be a
[1:26:05] blessing to you because you're always
[1:26:06] sitting there with something on you I

[1:26:32] and I wanna go that way men there's so
[1:26:34] many things I can say but I'm trying to
[1:26:37] keep my balance here hallelujah
[1:26:40] so you can forsake your sense raise up
[1:26:43] and serve the Lord and minister to seek
[1:26:45] those things then that's what I'm doing
[1:26:47] because I see the love I see the thing
[1:26:49] coming in so promises brother oppa then
[1:26:51] you go in there and you cut it out and I
[1:26:55] said last week don't move in squabble
[1:26:56] because if you're offended in the word
[1:26:58] it says blessed is he whose not offended
[1:27:00] in me and my words if the said I'm
[1:27:04] saying is truth and you get offended
[1:27:06] then there's something wrong your spirit
[1:27:07] let me my spirit can cooperate to the
[1:27:10] word then you gotta check your spirit
[1:27:14] and this is serious this is serious
[1:27:17] business we not plain we're not gambling
[1:27:20] we don't playing around the serious
[1:27:21] brother
[1:27:27] my and that only last week this is got
[1:27:30] to do with Jesus every interesting it's
[1:27:33] not about you it's about Jesus every
[1:27:35] quiet that comes into yeah it's about
[1:27:37] Jesus not about the choir all the
[1:27:40] magicians it's not about them it's about
[1:27:41] Jesus reduce about Jesus everything we
[1:27:45] do when we praised it it's about Jesus
[1:27:47] when we in the world it's about Jesus in
[1:27:50] the moon is about Jesus presence and his
[1:27:53] power when he comes down so get yourself
[1:28:15] out of the way and like I said he's not
[1:28:18] speaking to the church is speaking to
[1:28:20] individuals it's calling individuals
[1:28:23] apart by because you say otherwise if

[1:41:39] church no matter how good our cold it is
[1:41:42] they'll wrap up in a blanket set on a
[1:41:44] bobsled and try for the horses for 30
[1:41:49] miles he speaking of those who people in

[1:42:17] all grouped together
[1:42:18] one family gets another and they start
[1:42:20] walking and they go it's a sacrifice
[1:42:23] that makes that they make is what causes
[1:42:26] them to get so much out of the service
[1:42:30] so he sees what you put in what you get
[1:42:32] now if it's not a sacrifice then you're
[1:42:34] not gonna get nothing you just come to
[1:42:37] choose to be just you're gonna need
[1:42:38] nothing but when it's a sacrifice and I
[1:42:40] know I got so many things to do and
[1:42:42] though she's not done in the washing
[1:42:45] leave there brother
[1:42:46] but I come to also got this show and he
[1:42:49] says the bigger the sacrifice the bigger
[1:42:51] the blessing let's face it we are men
[1:42:56] what we are doing we haven't even
[1:42:58] resisted to blood yet but brother come
[1:43:01] on man we can make it yes we can make
[1:43:04] I'm here to tell you we can make it
[1:43:07] hallelujah and when there's no second
[1:43:10] friends is not very much to the service
[1:43:13] you have to really get down in and do
[1:43:15] something that hurts real bad us even at
[1:43:19] you to come my hurt you even if you
[1:43:24] force to use the rent money sometimes
[1:43:28] master but cuz you know it's gonna oh I
[1:43:31] can say something one woman was walking
[1:43:34] and those years it was very cheap but to
[1:43:38] go over the bridge was fifteen cents and
[1:43:41] that's all she had in the purse so she
[1:43:43] has go back over the bridge but for her
[1:43:45] to cross is gonna cost 50 cents but
[1:43:47] while she's walking years of megacity
[1:43:49] and the Holy Spirit says give that 50
[1:43:51] cents to the beggar and then she's back
[1:43:53] in the soup I brought but how manicotti
[1:43:55] and he said to her what is that to you
[1:43:59] follow down on me when I can preach the
[1:44:06] sermon on that what is there to do
[1:44:07] what's going on what is that to thee
[1:44:09] follow thou me
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:12] [Applause]
[1:44:14] span she took it out when she gave it
[1:44:15] because she wanted to follow the lead
[1:44:17] knowledge but it and she sits by fate
[1:44:19] she walked towards the bridge and she
[1:44:21] didn't know what's gonna happen when she
[1:44:23] get there and just before she gets to
[1:44:25] the bridge yes Lane the 15 cents now if
[1:44:28] she was an obedient to the Holy Spirit
[1:44:30] brother do you think that would happen
[1:44:32] disappointed my obedience thank you
[1:44:58] brilliance is better than sacrifice amen
[1:45:02] so I get to go to church show God that I
[1:45:05] love you and you make a sacrifice
[1:45:06] because then they do into something goes
[1:45:09] out because you don't know what's going
[1:45:11] out he says I just like Mikey disbelieve
[1:45:14] all I thought I would get anything that
[1:45:17] I was the kid mama used to get maybe
[1:45:19] once once sake of candy and she's
[1:45:22] measured out two or three pieces to each
[1:45:24] one maybe for Christmas we get a little
[1:45:26] turn 1 and our little kept personal or
[1:45:29] something and I seen other kids would
[1:45:32] sleep sleep what colored slaves slaves
[1:45:36] and bicycles and things good clothes
[1:45:38] warm jackets and it just made me feel so
[1:45:41] bad I said if I ever have any children
[1:45:43] of my own I'm gonna do everything for
[1:45:45] them I could well I would be willing to
[1:45:47] go hungry to get something for my kids
[1:45:49] and when I loved when belly was just a
[1:45:51] little boy I get him a little price a
[1:45:53] tricycle and I got him everything and
[1:45:55] mirror a mirror who tried everything to
[1:45:58] sacrifice her own clothes and things to
[1:46:01] get him something but you know what we
[1:46:04] begin to find out I got him a little
[1:46:05] tricycle and a little boy a bow and
[1:46:08] arrow and everything I find him with a
[1:46:10] spoon or a stick out in the backyard
[1:46:12] dick in some way the next ones won't be
[1:46:15] like that
[1:46:16] you just got to he says you can give
[1:46:19] anybody everything right on their hand
[1:46:22] and they don't want it it's something
[1:46:24] you have to sacrifice for so you can
[1:46:27] give people anything they want for name
[1:46:29] but you have to sacrifice and that's way
[1:46:32] these will suffice in other words
[1:46:34] promises wanted to do better but when he
[1:46:36] found him is a plane with a tricycle
[1:46:38] he's there with the spoon and a stick
[1:46:40] and it's not why it didn't happen it
[1:46:42] didn't sacrifice he got it for nothing
[1:46:44] and it says that some people is and
[1:46:46] that's the way with salvation it's a
[1:46:49] complete sacrifice you gotta sacrifice

[1:47:27] to you all this morning sir Tina's heart
[1:47:30] building is we said yeah
[1:47:31] let's keep our minds on the greatest
[1:47:33] sacrifice that man kind ever was given
[1:47:36] to do that was Jesus Christ when he was
[1:47:38] charged to come to the earth and do a
[1:47:41] anti in our state not only that but he's
[1:47:44] so descended into hell and they was
[1:47:46] there for three days and nights and on
[1:47:48] the third day he rose and he ascended on
[1:47:51] high sitting at the right hand of God in
[1:47:53] heaven making intercession upon our
[1:47:55] confessions of his atonement and His
[1:47:59] grace that's been provided for us now I
[1:48:01] want to speak to you this morning on a
[1:48:03] parable on some way the most unchurched
[1:48:07] person is here we'll be able to
[1:48:09] understand now we come to church to
[1:48:11] better ourselves we come to ourselves he
[1:48:14] says yeah okay better Christians better
[1:48:17] fathers I didn't read that one it says
[1:48:20] yeah
[1:48:21] and we feed us by the word see and the
[1:48:24] Holy Spirit is sent from God to take his
[1:48:27] word of God and give it to us as we have
[1:48:29] need of and I'm glad that God made the
[1:48:31] provision like that aren't you glad that
[1:48:35] he would feed us aren't you glad that he
[1:48:38] would feed us this morning because
[1:48:41] there's a famine in the world right now
[1:48:43] for the yearly not the preaching for the
[1:48:47] year in of the true Word of God we have
[1:48:50] many preachers but God says for the
[1:48:53] yearling so you need an ear to hear what
[1:48:57] does Fergie sign unto you you need to
[1:49:00] hear what God does one is speaking to
[1:49:03] you and I'm not speaking of the natural
[1:49:05] here you can immerse it just put it to
[1:49:10] you man let him the death in here yeah
[1:49:18] my judgment is conditioned how many
[1:49:23] attend church this morning let's see
[1:49:24] your hands all over the building well
[1:49:26] that's fine
[1:49:27] how many intended to attend tonight
[1:49:30] let's see the ends it's communal tonight
[1:49:34] let's see how many intend to attend
[1:49:36] tonight with the answer sir are you
[1:49:40] coming tonight
[1:49:41] it's communion most important service my
[1:49:49] drink your cup is it although it is
[1:49:52] possible let this cup pass me but it had
[1:49:54] to treat your cup
[1:49:55] now you don't want to drink his cup come
[1:50:02] on okay
[1:50:05] up to you know blessing you machine and
[1:50:09] you can never come back you know yes
[1:50:12] they can never come back its history no
[1:50:15] matter what happens to its history right
[1:50:18] we started at what ten o'clock exactly
[1:50:20] do you know that's fast I came up in the
[1:50:26] quarter to eleven it's almost awkward
[1:50:28] slim I mean current elements almost of
[1:50:30] course all that forty five minutes is
[1:50:32] gone you can't regain it and you know
[1:50:46] even if as you sitting there god knows
[1:50:47] what's in your thoughts what thought you
[1:50:50] thinking what's in your heart
[1:50:54] so that's why it's always important to
[1:50:57] come with the right attitude but the
[1:51:01] Matthew the right perspective how many
[1:51:06] he says will attend church tonight
[1:51:10] intend to a change so tonight let's see

[1:55:05] and I need to say before I'm leaving on
[1:55:08] Wednesday so that's why I'm speaking
[1:55:12] others I would have preached this man
[1:55:14] that we should not forsake the
[1:55:16] assembling ourselves together as some
[1:55:19] who have not faith but we are to set
[1:55:22] ourselves together
[1:55:23] and we are taught also that we are set
[1:55:26] in heavenly places in sa that early we
[1:55:29] are taught that were seated in heavenly
[1:55:30] places in Christ Jesus been baptized
[1:55:32] into his body by one spirit that we are
[1:55:35] with him raised up in his resurrection
[1:55:38] and in his presence knowing that he ever
[1:55:42] lives to make intercession and we thank
[1:55:45] thee for that so we are not seated just
[1:55:48] here we are seated in heavenly places
[1:55:50] and heavenly places brother when you're
[1:55:53] up there there brother says we are all

[1:58:23] worship was the first thing in heaven
[1:58:25] that made in God there was no pretty but
[1:58:30] it was worship and when the angels
[1:58:32] worship Him then only trading colonies

[2:01:01] beginning was the word and the word was
[2:01:02] god and would but there was no preaching
[2:01:04] God didn't speak yet only when they
[2:01:07] worshiped him and come I tell you
[2:01:10] something you know you know whatever
[2:01:11] because Lucifer was angel he was a
[2:01:14] covering danger he was the cherubim ah

[2:01:22] cords was every was every tuning cierto
[2:01:26] bass baritone uh-oh
[2:01:28] every voice he worship he was angel that
[2:01:31] to care worship Michael was an angel of
[2:01:36] war gala was the angel that brought the
[2:01:39] word but this is the enemy came to
[2:01:47] proudly became too big he wanted all of
[2:01:49] that and he felt is bigger than go
[2:01:51] because he's so deep
[2:01:59] and then the Bible says he deceived
[2:02:01] two-thirds of the angels but whatever
[2:02:03] Michael and his angels they keeps you
[2:02:05] out of heaven brother I'm telling you
