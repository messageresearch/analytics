sing this song as we amen get ready for god's saving amen amen i will praise him and i will praise him praise the lamb for savers and give him glory all he people for his blood [Music] thank you lord god bless you amen amen comes amen [Music] i want to use this opportunity to really appreciate this moment the year of our living and to thank the lord for making it possible for this visual convention coming all the way from ghana i want to thank god for our precious brother um suleiman nachna for the faith of his heart to call this convention and i pray that god be blessed in his church his wife and family and also bless all the ministers that have been gathered to come and speak in this convention mine is just to bring you a greeting and i'm saluting all of you all the ministers believers all around the world and i trust and i know that god who is so merciful and have kept us all this way we bless you richly without wasting time i just want to read from the scriptures just in line with the inspiration of the meetings isaiah 21 i want to read verse 11. the burden of dharma he call it to me out of seer watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said money and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come may god a blessing to the reign of his word in jesus christ's name amen i just want to follow the inspiration of the meeting as concerning matthew 25 from verse 1 talking about um the parable of the ten vegans five we are wise and five were foolish and jesus was speaking in this parable pointing to today the end time concerning the preparation of the bride for the takeoff into the rapture and we know too well how the entire world had been today we know very well how the world has been falling apart and it's no more a surprise that all the scriptures are almost fulfilled and the question we have in our heart is are we prepared and bro abraham was speaking here in this message he said well they just say that something today there is no difference the devil always takes his man but never the spirit it lives on another man god takes his man but never the spirit it comes on down living on someone else so the same spirit still exists today we are not blind to these things and it would be good if we would listen to the voice of the one in the torah the holy spirit that is warning us fleeing the rot that is to come make ready because the hour is approaching amen and that's also the same situation the five wasn't fed the five wise virgin the five foolish virgins they got they they were together they had the way of agents and in that same way today we have people who have believed [Music] and having believed we are trying to scale our standard by what we reason by what we think by what we feel but this is the time we don't scale ourselves or measure with what we think what we believe what we what we want to get ourselves as a measure the measure we should have today should be the absolute revealed word of god thus said the lord or we keep still and the prophet said if you have to do the things i ask you to do i will meet you in the morning but we found out today that the message has been filled up with all kinds of ideas but there is always one idea by the holy spirit and i ask that god we help his people today the predestination of god that will we heed to that voice of god and if we have to start with our voice of god revealed word of the hour and live by it by the revelation of the holy spirit god is obligated to lead us to the end so i believe that god will still do what he says he would do amen god said in the bible take heed to the flock which the holy spirit has made you a watchman over be sure that they are fed with the right food making ready for the coming of the lord oh how it was sad when that great midnight crime came and it was all over it reminds me of a story that i read some years ago about a prosperous prospector in arizona he was one of those gold-minded people and he wanted to get rich all at once so he goes in to the desert to prospect while he was prospecting the story goes that he found a great nest of nuggets and just overnight became a multi-millionaire with the sacks full of gold and he packed his bureau and he and his bureau and friendful dogs started back to civilization with a sweat flying from his face his eyes a glittery and on his road to have a good time the rest of his life so when he was nearing to his place where he where his destination would was to be they said there was an old abandoned shack and he went into the district and laid the money out upon the table by a little green scandal and was looking over the nuggets little did he know that there was eyes watching him and along about the time that he laid down and went to sleep while he started to go to sleep the old faithful dog began to bank and he was lying on his below thinking oh tomorrow i will change this nuggets for currency and i will buy great cars and i will drink good whiskey i will do all these things and have a big time and i will go to every dance and all he would do they're drinking that and his dog kept barking backing away he went to the door and opened the door and said shut up and the dog went he was tied to a lush and he tried to warn his master but he went back again and laid down on his bed on his bed and again the dog started bathing again and he called him this he called him time after time shut up i don't want to hear you i want to love you i want lovely dreams tonight of the good times i am going to have tomorrow when i cash in my gold and finally the dog barked again he became he become angry he reached in the corner and got a double barrier shotgun and went to the door we bought the hammers back and shot the dog down to the dead said that we take care of you i wouldn't need you anymore anyhow set the gun down and lay down on the bed and fold in his hands with his dream and fell off to sleep just in a little while the door opened easily someone slipped across the door the floor and plunged a server knife into his bosom and took the gold and left with him left with it oh what did he do he killed the voice that was warning him let that not be our stand all that voice of the holy spirit that warns the church day after day as we see the approaching of the lord let's not steal that voice by ignoring it and turning it away but let's take heed to the warning that it gives us god has watched men over his heritage god richly bless you [Music] thank you jesus god bless you my brother we appreciate those eddie fine words amen god richly bless you thank you very much praise god just close your eyes raise your hands [Music] foreign [Music] i will praise it i will praise him [Music] away [Music] the [Music] i shall never cease to praise him i shall never cease to praise glory glory to his name oh and glory glory to his name amen as you get ready for god's event become powered let's think about all our hearts amen praise god hallelujah thank you jesus oh may god use this servant in a powerful way the mighty way to bless our hearts today oh praise god praise god yes lord jesus [Music] will you open your hearts today amen hallelujah god will pour out his blessings upon you today hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord [Music] [Music] good morning and god bless you all as if it is not morning in other parts of the world we are there in whatever day it is there afternoon evening whatever we appreciate you all for another privilege to have this opportunity to speak to the bride of christ all over the world and we trust that what we are going to share will be of a blessing to the body of christ i would like to appreciate pastor joseph for giving me this privilege to be of service to the saints uh in the hope and in the faith that we shall be of a blessing somewhere along the line and i appreciate the recording the reproduction the production team in trinidad for the job that they are doing i pray that the lord will bless them bless most of you brother isaac and the rest of the saints out there too and uh i also want to appreciate other servants of god will be speaking at the convention i pray that the lord will grant function and inspiration for all small to be a blessing to the body of christ and bring edification to them as we near the coming of the lord may god bless you all very richly if we don't find it can we please rise up for the reading of the world gracious father we thank you this morning for another privilege to serve you we're grateful for the grace uh to be a branch of jesus christ and we thank you lord for the book that make it not ashamed that this life race will not be run for nothing oh god there is a blessing there is a reward that lays ahead for us all their father would pray that distance will indeed be a revelation unto us that we might in the light of your glory that we may abide in the power of your grace oh god be our head this morning as we fellowship around divine elements come by and visit with us take glory in this service keep walk slowly behind the cross where the devil can will do us know how the blessings that we share in long deep into the house of your people walking upon the atoms of the bodies of your children who change them from glory to glory to welcome to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god next our gathering and take glory the same in jesus christ's name we pray amen if you have your battles with you our humble requests that we turn to the book of 2nd peter chapter 3 2nd peter chapter 3 verse 1 to 9. this second episode will be loved and i'll write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of all the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this quest that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their whole lost and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for these they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of hope and the heads standing out of the water and in the water whereby the walls that then was being overflowed with water perished for the heavens and the earth which are now by the same words are kept in store results onto fire against the day of judgment and petition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men comes luckness what is not suffering towards what not willing that any shall perish for that all should come to repentance amen first thessalonians chapter 4 first thessalonians chapter 4. i would like to read from the 13th verse but i will not have you to be ignorant progress concerning them which are asleep there is sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rules again he will serve them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this will say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the hack anger and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the earth and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with his words my lord has pleasant to the reading of his own word makes you sense [Music] like to once again greet the saints in the name of the lord jesus christ the theme of the convention or the inspiration of the convention says behold the bridegroom comments and it's in love dreaming time amen now i want to speak on what the bridegroom is coming to do amen if the bright group is coming what does he have for us in his coming so in this convention i'll be speaking as much as i could i'll be speaking as much as i could on the rapture of the church of christ the rapture amen amen if the bridegroom is coming it's coming for one purpose and that is to take his bride out of the sin in the book of john chapter 14 the lord jesus christ told us not to be troubled the lord jesus christ told us not to be scared the lord jesus christ told us not to be perplexed and he told us these things in a manner to give us a real assurance he said in my father's place there are many mentions amen and he said if these things were not so i would not have told you is that the reason i had to leave after the first time i came is for me to go and prepare a place for you amen i'm after the reparation of the place when he is ready he said i'm coming back to take you to myself now it might look like a general statement but i want you to know that christ has his own intentions of the kind of people he is coming to think to himself christ might have come for all in his first coming which the bible even told us that even though it seems presented for her yes the announcement of the angel said that he's coming for the salvation of his own people amen so if it was for the salvation of his own people if we look at that in the context of john chapter 3 16 wherein he said for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen it was his love that made him give his only begotten son but come to think of it even though the begotten son was given for the entire world by that verse of the scripture it shows also that it is not the entire world that will embrace the gift of god he said but whosoever believes that whosoever are the people that christ had in his mind when he was coming in flesh in order to bring salvation to mankind and this is the reason it is important to note that if we have problems with the word predestination it will be a permanent problem in time the salvation that christ offers was offered for all was presented to all for by predestination it is not all that will accept that offering and you see let me take it further your acceptance of that offering has not gotten anything to do with your ability to choose and choose correctly your acceptance of that offering is also a work of election in itself your choice is not as independent as you thought if you think it was that independent then you will be slapping some scriptures the bible said god said i will have mercy on whom i will [Applause] we have compassion and we love compassion if he chooses not to have compassion on you you can never choose correctly so the choice you made was inspired by the election god has made of you as a matter of fact jesus our lord said you were not the one who chose me so really you have no choice in this business he said i chose you [Applause] so predestination is the maker of the clay or the product from the clay who will call potter choosing to make you a vessel of honor unto himself it's beyond your it's beyond your choices it's beyond your intention it is the mercy of god if you have accepted this message i congratulate you in the name of jesus christ it is only those who accepted that mercy in their age in the fullness that this is coming is actually meant for in john 4 37 i am going to prepare a place for you so that where i am there shall you be also amen christ wants to have a living experience with you he wants to spend some good quality time with you he wants to have fellowship with you and that is the reason it will come back our lord will return to this act some sweet days amen satan will be bound a thousand years we will have no temper then after jesus return to the earth i mean how many are living by the hope of his covenant how many believe you will come how many are expecting is coming how many are preparing for is coming behold the king comments he will suddenly come the unbelief of the world will be not in there is coming our lord will return to jesus he said we say to you by the word of the lord amen but there are some things we must do there are some things we must understand about this is coming if it is coming we have established by the scriptures that is coming for his own amen if you have no beginning with him you cannot end up in him hallelujah and christ does not hide that fact amen christ has made odd choices that will make you realize that he can do without anybody and but nobody can do it without him when he went to the pool protester there were so many sick land and all kind of categories in there christ went there he chose to heal only one person and it departed does it look like he doesn't have compassion for the rest amen but that was his problem for that time he is that one person and he left and nothing more do you realize that he did not reduce the fact that he is christ you realize that he did not change his position to us yesterday it was our lord today he is our lord tomorrow it will be our lord [Music] amen even the three children said even if jesus is not to deliver us yet we will not deny him because the man that came into the fire kingdom who cannot testify he said the appearance looks like that of the son of god and that was with all abraham that he rejoiced to see his name came again in the body form and he opened the eyes of an even king to recognize who he was because indeed everybody [Music] [Applause] are you following so if christ come tomorrow and take only 10 people he will still remain crushed and speaking for those who believe that god will be too merciful to send anybody to the fires of hell hell is not being created for animals health was originally designed for satan and his angels but then they were cast down and they came with the lying spirit the spirit of the three of kin floods by which they have deceived the whole earth as many as follow their deception will not make it amen so the bride of christ will be those who has kept that deception you love him this morning all right i'm going gradually but i won't take the church for too long amen so what we are establishing is the fact that christ is coming and even it is coming he's not coming for sightseeing it's not coming to for sure mentioned he's not coming to show that he can come is actually coming in order to take his home there was a visible audience that he was addressing in that particular day do you realize that he was addressing his followers amen and in his prayer in john chapter 20 or chapter 7 he said never pray for this alone did you catch that for as many people as many as we believe me through the awareness amen so the path to those who will make it when it comes the path of those whom christ will take when they come is the part of those who are following christ through the words of those visible apostles so you cannot preach against the adoption and expect christ to come for you amen if if peter baptized in the name of jesus christ you cannot do contrary and expect christ to come for you if peter never obtains a woman preacher or paul never did a woman preacher as a matter of fact they spoke contrary to that amen you cannot you cannot do contrary to them and expect christ to come for you that part of those whom christ will fall comfort will follow the direction of the disciples you love him because they were the visible audience that he was speaking to on that day he said i'm coming for you and he said neither praying for these ones alone but for those who will believe me through the awareness so if you are believer in apostles and the prophet's doctrine you are a candidate for that god we shall get money together you love him this morning so christ will come and it's coming for the bride so be that is coming for the bride how does it takes its own that is coming for a way it takes them away by way of the what we have now come to know as rapture away rapture is not a word you will find in the bible what is the word that describes what christ will do when it comes in matthew chapter 25 the bible says there were two categories of people who were expecting the coming of his bridegroom amen and one category was called the wise vegans the other category was called the foolish vegetables amen and they were described as being wise or foolish entirely only by their preparation because both of them were virgins i want you to underline that the only thing that qualifies one for to be a wise and qualifies the other has been foolish is just preparation preparation was what made a difference hallelujah between the foolish and the wise and i tell you today also preparation is the only thing that is gonna make a difference between the right of the people that christ will go with when it comes and those who will be left behind god has shown these two different types and shadows in the bible the rapture we are talking about is not going to be the first ever there have been several raptures in the bible follow me church in the time in the beginning in the time of in the era of enoch and noah there was a rapture amen when elijah the teacher was here there was a rapture amen when our lord jesus christ was here there was a rapture and now there will be a rapture and he will not have a rapture there will be another one amen according to revelations chapter 11 there will be another option so rapture is a common exercise of god throughout history there is only one thing that can prepare amen for the breadcrumb coming nobody ever is able to prepare it takes god to furnish preparation the mistake people will make is to be looking for how to prepare or inventing a preparation for themselves amen they said it is love dreaming time the question is how do you trip your lives and what is the treatment of the lamb because you are alive we are not going to be giving a physical love amen it looks like a love dreaming time because the world is going to get through at night time you know the foolish and the wise they've been waiting since morning did you catch them they've been waiting from morning and they waited till night and even the bridegroom never came at night did you catch that the bridegroom came after midnight oh yes so they waited a whole day it was the beginning of another day that witnessed the coming of the bridegroom [Applause] amen so for there to be a coming that will take you away another day must be declared till night amen the bible said that wait was so long until the are in some laps why do they carry the land there never nobody needs their love during the day did you catch them their love is for help at amen but the energy that powers the love is the holy spirit let us make it so simple so that we can grasp it and do not have a denominational understanding of all these blessings amen because the prophet said rapture is a revelation the revelation of which has been simplified for the bride of christ the foolish virgins and the wise veterans that what had the love [Music] and they bought and why for a long time in their lives but the waiting was so long amen and that is why apostle peter is here telling you and her do not surrender to the message to the revival of this coffers because their weight will be too unlocked for discovers to have revival they have to take advantage of the times in order to swear the fate of many people away opposed to peter said they will question the time the season and even the veracity of the message of his coming is that what the scripture said we read it together he said where is the promise of his coming some generations are raised to query that and that was why if you watch when the prophet was preaching the message rapture he devoted several pages before he even went into the contents of the rapture he devoted several pages to deal with the activities of discovers but here is a lesson i found to summarize it for you scoffers are those who try to um preach the truth yes if god give me a better summary we give the church sculptures are those that not only attack the truth they try to um preach it amen that is why if you reach the message rapture the prophet says coffers have risen now and what were they saying they were telling the people that some of the truths that we had in the scriptures are not supposedly like that again they attack the virgin birth listen church they attack the crossing of the red sea amen and in these last days they are packing something else similar in that life there are many things that are coming under attack but there are some three things that you must not discontinue because if dustin do not exist there is actually no exodus if those things did not exist there is actually no redemption i believe the church knows that we are in the exodus the prophet preached the message told exodus even though he called in the church he took time to show us the first and the second the first was when god was calling a nation out of a nation amen bringing out his own people out of the church watch that was the first exodus that was when he was calling israel out of egypt amen the second was when he was calling the church out of religion and the time was when he was calling the bride not even when he was when he eats because this is the commenter he's calling the bride out of the church now each of this exodus as a major lack of redemption that's right and what this compass intends to do is to attack the major mark of redemption to disprove that exodus and god's redemption now look at it if you take the red sea crossing of the children of israel out of the first exodus does that exodus make sense the prophet said the red sea crossing was to give them redemption blessing by power they cut it by blood through the lamb of the passover amen because redemption has got two parts hallelujah if you can send your soul it can heal your body you must enjoy retention by love then you enjoy it by power that is why for the church that is redeemed miracle signs and wonders will follow them he said this and shall follow those that believe in my name hallelujah i hope we are still shouting because we shall we don't look for signs and wonders they follow us that is the difference they won't look for it the sense of wonders look for them right if those things are not happening in your life the prophet said your life is not associated with victory it is not happening in our homes it is not happening in our church we are becoming powerless they must be there it is the word of the lord this is the article of our redemption and we hold them very there so our redemption must come by blood it must go by power if we have the wedge we will have the life because the word releases the spirit and the spirit manifestation wherever the spirit of god is there must be liberty there must be deliverance there must be practice there must be a holy [Applause] [Music] there must be truth and he shall know the truth and the truth will set us free then we must be free we must be at liberty to enjoy the blessings that god has really given unto us all glory to god above the smallest take that number two in the second exodus if you take the virgin bench out of the second exodus that exodus does not make sense because you are proving that jesus wasn't better than us and his blood was shed for nothing don't forget without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins [Applause] so the redemption of the second exodus can only be punctuated by the shedding of the blood what do you know there's coffers attached these two things they said moses never actually opened no red sea they were trying to um preach the truth they sent israel and only passed through a bunch of reach and you know when they began to preach that some people believe in them because they are brought to believe blessed are those who are not offended in me but i tell you there will be a generation to offend and you cannot help them i'm building a case because i'm coming to this day until i reach here what i'm saying is not complete and i will reach here because i was attacked and they are influenced in the life of the believer opposed to peter [Applause] amen the birth of jesus was in virgin bed the prophet said the first time that was preached 500 ministers denounced the abduction of the fetching bear hey i started preaching contrary there will always be believers or such are you catholic no matter how wrong a subject is it will have its followers this is why even have is being enlarged because the followers are getting much more than expected because the whole man because there was just nothing in them to believe the truth and from 500 imaginative 500 ministers overrun a place let even say by pyramid scheme they are getting one world coverage i tell believers in that today will be millions the prophet said is in 1965 1965 tonight's over 50 years so there's a generation believing today that jesus was not vegetable and what were they doing they were attacking the redemption punctuation the redemption mark of the second exodus in these last days the scoffers are back and i will warn you of them amen now what church the prophet of the lord told us as we are going to see don't forget the prophet rapture is a revelation and i'm trying to open in simplicity the revelation of rapture amen the prophet of the lord told us that for christ to bring rapture he brought a three-stage ministry amen i'm not going into first testament here i'm going into the first stage of first thessalonians follow me because first thessalonians chapter 4 have been confused and language but you will hear the truth that you can find in the pages of the world in simplicity now [Applause] the word of god is without confusion i know someone will be getting uncomfortable in their seats for the world of god doesn't make new man uncomfortable listen to the word and be delivered [Applause] but let's prepare the ground for him like this the lord jesus came with the three-stage ministry in his physical coming amen amen because he did not just get the people he addressed as wrap-up candidate in john 14 like that they went through a series of quality assurance process the communication it was addressing was so few but the revival of jesus gathered thousands how come it became few that received the message of rapture think about that for a minute we are seeing a convention that jesus addressed five thousand brethren we have seen in the program that jesus addressed four thousand brethren but when it came to the message of the rapture he was addressing very few people because he has already told us stretch is the gate narrow is the way i'm feeling happy that we find it because for the true church that we make rapture rapture is a revelation watch this the prophet called his three stages of ministry three pools he was using the word pools because of the vision god gave him because god gave him a vision that sacrifices ministry as a fish catching experience are you cutting it in cutting fish or you pull the hook with the layer on top of it amen the prophet said when you do a festival you do it to make the fish relax your pool flows with the ocean current so that the fish cannot detect that there is a pulling so you've got to be an expert in order to pull the hook that has the bait amen without the fish knowing that you were pulling the fish would think it is the current of the water that is pulling the hook so if god will be smart sensitive this is why this ministry of the messenger cannot be carried by everybody and that is why every imaginations that we have gotten around it are collapsing you can never be using the word of the prophet and let me tell you there is no finished business in terms of bringing the revelation of the world yes by the prophet law of finnish business he said all the mysteries have been revealed and the seals are open for it is the thought of a finnish business that has attracted the generation of old fighters who only succeeded in taking the believers back to the denomination the message called them all off but thanks be to god the jubilee time has arrived incarcerations of this meeting all fighters are giving way because the children of jubilee must be delivered it was the blood of jesus that portrays you it is the blood of jesus that will be serve you it is the blood of jesus i will give you the rapture you love me amen so when he thinks the first time because he made it so disarming the fish follows amen then the fish is gathering confidence that this is not a trap and is following and they will put his mouth and start tapping on the beach and the fishermen we give another pool amen and that another pool was a big farmer but it looks as if the ocean current was beaten either to the fish and then because of much more confidence the fish is now ready to swallow oh man [Music] for swallow debate you know when he swallows the pigs [Music] hook because the bait is hiding the hook are you catching it so when the fisherman sees that the fish has gained confidence and is already swallowing the whole thing what will they do if we go for the third one and the third one is what is that the third one is the total that gives a serious job when it's just that they hook this time around it uncovers and it holds a portion of the fish and the fish have no option like you have no option amen if you still think you have an option you are not yet a believer if you are still looking for an alternative for this glorious message you are not yet converted that fish that is being touched by the top pulley which is a serious jack have no options even when he protests he have no option he must come with the hook he must [Applause] then you will surrender and use that sage be listened to me according to your words hallelujah [Applause] it is against your position it is against your child it is a work of election and you all can relate with him that there was a time you don't mind the message there was a time you were looking like this like that for one day you couldn't sleep one day you began wrestling do you know what the prophet said it is the situation that is connected with what is hearing i'm telling your chemistry this is your life this is the truth you will never know you will never know john until you surrender and today you are here are no longer struggling to surrender it has become easy because you've got the hook happy who got you if you are biting me and my mother fighting you [Applause] [Applause] amen reasoning days are over it is time to surrender it is time to let go and laying the presence of the restaurant to back out the big green out of your life and prepare yourselves for the master's eyes it looks like i've gone ahead of myself amen that is god's problem so that is what is called the three pose so the first full spiritually speaking amen was what the sign in the hand hallelujah hallelujah the second bull was the worst was the ability to tell the secrets of the heart amen you know even though those two things were outstanding yes they were not salvation come and judge yes come and join the only way you will know is that what is the effect is it permanent did he change your permanent you could get ill of one sickness today and you can have another tomorrow amen you could feel for standing today hearing your secrets being told you and tomorrow you lose confidence as some are doing and their faith is being overthrown you will respect those who are attacking the message today to at least respected the fact that even their mummies and daddies are outstanding experiences and testimonies that they themselves are preached about they only preach those things it never makes me faint in your heart coming church you will expect that at least this man was vindicated the prophet of the lord said listen to me church the prophet of the lord said when jesus began to sound his thought pool after the healing and discernment when he began to break his message which message i'm coming to it is actually the first stage of the coming of the lord amen i will knock some things out of here too amen which message is actually the first stage of the calling of the lord the third face of the ministry what's actually the first phrase of christ's comments are spoken in first thessalonians chapter four the prophet said when jesus our lord was here he has a three-stage ministry also the reason the messenger of this last age must have a three-stage ministry was because he actually had no ministry amendment the ministry he had is to reveal the son of man so if he is to reveal the son of man he must bring to you the reincarnated ministry of jesus christ will islam will not be the person of christ for the ministry it brings will be the ministry the exact ministry of the lord jesus christ nothing more [Applause] so the characteristic of that ministry must be the same why will he bring it he has to bring it because when christ our lord himself brought it he brought it to only two classes or races of mankind whereas we have three he brought it to the jews and to these americans he never gave the gentiles radical gentiles by god's providence taught some blessings god's magical truth by god's dominance today is getting our blessings [Applause] [Music] [Applause] brother we'll reveal this son of god the lord jesus christ for him to bring a perfect revelation christ must have known to him his ministry this is why we believe in the incarnate ministry of the lord jesus christ so what he teach them must be repeated again because it is the cycle of life the genitals must have their full content like those guys are there this is our season this is our day and we are enjoying it and we are not going to allow any evil fly because we must destroy the influence of this conference in your life because the activity according to the scripture is to destroy your faith for the rapture for christ will come the prophet said when he began to sound his message which was his purpose the reason for which he came which is the message to prepare the bride out of the groud for the rapture a lot of people took offense where were the five thousand where were the four thousand where were they 70 it's in your bible where were those who were so excited about his ministry i never concluded we must install him as our king the official house the bible said they took offence but there was this generation of fear for which you belong listen this is the blessing i'm bringing you know what the prophet said he said these people did not even understand what christ had said but christ has been vindicated love for them to know you can never tell them wrong this was one god bless you this was my peter said [Applause] [Music] and whatever it means [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the revelation of it so any little upset they take offense what is your joy to appreciate you for 45 years and you are attacking it today brother you were blind before you were planned let me tell you there have been many things that [Music] [Applause] i said many things you will never be able to understand hallelujah intentionally amen just to watch what you are going to do with that but you know why we are going there do you know why we will not worry you [Music] [Applause] indicated i can show you in the scripture with my natural heart things that look like discrepancies and you stop it for me amen they look like underlying it is the poverty of our understanding they are making sense so for reading verbally reading reading naturally they look like even in their accounts there are the four hospitals the fourth hospital matthew mark [Applause] [Applause] what happened what happened through your bible inside fire because the bible the love of the bible [Applause] it is possible for the interpretation of the bible to also look like that it is very important for the interpretation because this interpretation can only interpret what has been written if the writing is like this the interpretation will [Applause] it is for those who are brought to salvation to pick their salvation [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'm going somewhere so in these last days just as they took offense and they began to speak full events about the article of redemption they've come back discovered to attack the article of redemption in the dead exodus if the first game under the attack secondary attack the time will come under the attack do you know brethren you cannot talk about redemption the exodus the calling out of the gentile bride without referring to the mystery cloud that's right that's for those who want revelation that's [Applause] [Music] spiritual it is men that carry them and once more they jump on another you kill the thief in the same place you are shooting the thief stealing is going on come on you cannot actually kill a deed you are only killing the victim of the thief because everybody being controlled by demons they don't need our judgment they need our pity they need our transmission that the lord will deliver them whatever is holding you captive makes you a victim hallelujah i can assure you you will get my prayer you will get my intercession if you are honest and you have issues come up and tell it i will mock you because the bible said confess your fault to one another and pray for one another [Applause] one [Applause] with the festival signing the hat he came with the second ability to know the secrets of the house but you know what they called it because the true [Music] coming to 1964 he calls the two the signs and if there's a sign there must be a voice [Music] the sign is announcing you getting it so those things as powerful and as long as they were that we enjoyed them they were not salvation they were only the attractions for us to get the real thing so if you are attracted by signs and wonders there is no proof that you will wrap your candidates some people were attracted by loaves and breads and before jesus left they showed their calls even though they have enjoyed his blessings are you catching them but before he left they showed their color every blessings they enjoyed never mix with faith in their heart there was a generation who saw the supernatural power of god in the wilderness and the bible said they were everyone dead because what they saw never makes you faint judge i'm bringing it over to you now look at this church now after those signs and wonders were good the prophet kept talking about his message amen yeah the sun in the heart takes care of your body the messianic disarmament takes care of your spirits but something must take care of your soul this is why many people who enjoyed those great outstanding miracles and not believers today thousands in bombay india thousands in south africa thousands all over the world we are in the bride should be up to a billion right now but you aren't going to have such figures amen why was the message of rapture only to few listen to my church when people are attracted they are attracted to get a message it is that message that actually touches your soul i begin the formation of christ amen because you must be of the same material with the one who is coming for you if i'm holding a magnet a real potent magnet the magnet if i wear it like this it will only attract products of similar material [Applause] even affect people for if your material is metal not in your aluminium you have the chances of being attracted and as you are turning the magnet around those materials will be turning around if you guard them for a little sweet you will see them catching up catching up that's exactly our option you've got to build the same material with him in order to be caught up with him are you catching that one because there will be a sweep his feet is not going to touch here but they are being sweet enough to give you such a connection oh man this is why you need something that can prepare you in the material shape of the great magnet i'm saying the sun in the hands can't be behaved the mysteries of god unveiled from cover to cover amen if it gets the heart of that bride is that what it starts the process of nourishing the city which was your and is your real you amen the prophet said the nature of your face was the nature imposed by sexpert amen that is why it has got to die so that your real you reach the best invisible union the one you really are because that is your true justification it was an impossible nature of that misbehave he that is one of god does not and cannot commit sin because it doesn't happen to him as a desire it doesn't happen in him as an appetite everyone that can commit sin was laying dormant until the light of the hour i'm bringing it to the light again until the light of the hour that can never come down amen because the oil is not sustained by you did you hear hearts not the oil and the wine amen do you hear god commanding and charging the forces of darkness that this one cannot be hot if it's hot in your life you are not in the program this one is so dense but the one who is preparing you inside all you are doing is that you are yielding and surrendering to the problem and grace is taking over every day walking upon the atoms of your body and changing you from georgia glory you cannot prepare by yourself you need the message of preparation and what do you do with the message of preparation ascension take it into you as it comes into you it gives quick notice to everything undesirable all the false glows all the fools glow we've been beating out what to be left of you is a pure one that will magnetize with the great magnet [Music] [Applause] the top pull is not signed in the hand the top one is not the same examination the top pull is the opening of the word something that reaches down to your soul and that is [Music] if anybody tells you that is confused the shout is not illegal the shout is not oh church church is the shout is not signing the shout is not the ability to tell the secret the prophet said you are not a foolish people oh yes you are that i have a message that i have a message that i have a message he says [Applause] what is that message is that you remember says is this the time what is this the time it was the testimony of the blast that the prophet had which he thought was the end of his life are you catholic and that he so much believe it was the end of his life until he started doing valentine's declaration he told his wife how to raise the children he told the church what to do because he thought he was living that god killed them amen i'm told it is not your death it is the change of your ministry did you catch that and six months later amen it was at arizona sunset they don't want us to talk about it whatever they make out of it because the prophet told me i said you have had many theories about it he said let me now tell you what it is that telling what it is is the message of the rapture that telling what it is was not for general it was for dogs which is meant for it was meant for me that is why we believe that i don't care who you are i don't care whatever you make out of it i don't care what your research says i have proven i am proof all true i am holding that's my conclusion if you are telling the world that this rink of mystery is the smoke of an evil play you a blasphemer i'm coming close now the only thing is i won't mention it but not because i'm afraid to mention names i don't need any man's daughter i need the favor of god [Applause] but i will give unto your names but if you're among those who are advocating that this ring of mystery is the smoke of aeroblade you ain't blasphemous you are a backslider [Applause] [Music] show us the plane give us the picture because if they protect the picture of this there must be a picture of the aeroplane and the movement of the same nonsense in the last days trying to destroy our of redemption what happened what is the significance of this world that was when the ministry changed amen from the denominational messenger to love this year do you know from 1946 to 1962 william brown was a messenger to love jesse and job [Applause] hallelujah [Music] for the rapture to begin with the iran must get of the same amen no opinion no thoughts no ideas no appealing to the teachings of great theologians he's going to be the teaching of the mighty angel of the lamb who took the book and lose themselves come on john are you catching this there were many things within guess the ash aha yes you become quiet for me now he said it by himself there were many things many theories that teaches they are beautiful because the revelation hasn't come how about coming the white house writer of revelation 6 the lord jesus christ amen how about preaching that to the church if you call the white house brother the lord jesus christ are we not going to worship him till tonight he still did not jesus christ to many but to us we know it was the devil do you know it is my wrong reason when abraham said when those sins became open my bible in my heart became one and it was a new one amen for that book to be opened there must be mystery cloud amen brother amen amen when those things were happening william brown one or two of them is still alive the question is did it happen like that or not if it happened exactly what should they take cover for amen and seven angels came down hallelujah and they took him in the pyramids of themselves because the truth of god is known only in vietnamese so the prophet had a temporary rapture he was carried to heavenly places to show the vision of the real tabernacle the fleshly temples how they must be puked and it was brought back with the church go back east come on now wait for it you will see the advent of the foolish veterans now wait for it amen just [Music] not to come back to jerusalem east rising of theirs amen so the sun was setting for now this year but the sun was rising for the blind because they were not meant for it you've waited all day until the sun sets hmm i will connect it to something to give you understanding you waited all day until the sun sets what were you waiting for the common bridegroom i like the word bright room because [Applause] because the bread room is the hospital of the drive [Music] the church who had waited do you know why they were waiting do you know why let me show you why because till 62 according to the message recognizing your day and its message there has been a cry for a greater revival how many ever read it church is successful you know the faith he wrote of his coming they said we need a greater revival it is not yet let's yet pray fast pray for the bible but what it takes to bring that reminder because now this is the revival for growth this is the river for preparation to go with christ what did we take for giving the church admitted we don't have it but you know at that time everybody looks like a bride because everybody was following the messenger did you catch that i knew they seemed like they all bright those who followed jesus when they're the church of jesus where they're not in church of jesus christ the five thousand this one everybody claiming machine until until we go to sunset now george if the sun is setting what is it announcing night is you're getting some ideas night is coming so the bright room never came until the other day did you catch that did you catch that it is only when your night there comes that you announced it is the rising of them the rising of the sun actually announces a new day i'm bringing it for you son was setting to the church world and the tragedy was admitting we had something but it's not enough we need something more what is something how is it going to come who is going to release it they have no idea they love this young age messenger does not have that something more it takes the breakthrough himself to plummet something more hey then to announce the close of another of this day seven angels are here amen amen and say what it will take to bring that new day to prepare their bride is not available today but we shall give you the commission then walk back and announce it is the rising of our other song so the voice of the bridegroom can only be heard not on that same day in another day [Applause] behold the bridegroom the revival up to that time could only take people that far too trump is simple living trying to live [Music] but we need something beyond love we want something that is effortless we want to come to a statue of friends that when people speak bad at us we don't struggle not to react [Applause] when people do bad to us there is no heart in us we even repent for them i have quotations for what i'm saying we stop telling god intercessory that it doesn't even mean to do it [Music] it is the setting of the sun for struggling times for trial by hero for partial revelation for childhood milk common church amen but every congregation were there the foolish and the wife at the setting of the sun the sun went down then it was a midnight why would it be during the night because another day must be announced did you catch that another day it's been what it is the rising sunrise speaks of another day this is where the bridegroom never came amen in the second book which closed systematically at 62 year 1962 that's what the prophet no 63 in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed whenever that was preached the prophet said now at two o'clock this is the end of the second meaning that the dispensation of that is over it is not as safe it will no longer discern but that is not the face of the ministry any longer amen so laughing into 63 a new day was announced because the bridegroom arrived amen amen the christ is not just waiting for a physical christ their blight is in that crash now yes yes began to speak if i wasn't the one to do this thing i am preparing glam for him and blind men took that as them [Music] who don't even know the meaning of joshua joshua means jehovah's savior which is the contemporary word today it's called jesus did you hear me that is too big for you you are saying will implant will for you does it make even sense those of you who are kept in spiritual foolishness a very very happy believer doesn't even make the messenger we follow the lesson the nature we follow the lesson i know what's on your mind is it but moses foreign you don't even have the understanding we are dealing with taxi do you know moses has his own mystery cloud for you to know that moses was just a human figure it was beyond moses yes yes it was beyond moses listen to me to know how to pull down the word of jericho it was beyond joshua did you hear me [Applause] the mighty indiana will come down what are you talking about do you understand your life the mighty angels have to do what just you are jewish are you foreign said to worship if it's from god give me a certain worship is the lord jesus christ [Applause] that was the real truth that this church will personify but it was personified by moses amen a muslim's run the coming of that joshua which is not the joshua the son of known did you hear me it was the lord jesus christ himself but joshua talked to jericho he didn't know what to do it was a high wall that seals the blessings what is it when he told them round it one time if i call that the first [Music] [Music] sixth day six years [Music] it was not one time london around it seven times and what was your lesson as god shout amen he said when you finish running in the seven times and you hear yes amen this book was filled with several sales hallelujah still one white horse rider seal two redness rider seal three [Music] ghost rider black horse rider shield four payloads rider simplified [Music] you know it was a silent message the angel that appeared to joshua tell me what he told me no you tell me what he told him did you know what he told me can you read this on the boat on the or you think the angel appeared for nothing after the angel introduced himself there was a fellowship you know what he was doing the fellowship was not spoken out or written but it was acted out did you catch that after the indian visitation was when joshua told the people you know that's what we're going to do it's like revelation has come amen what am i going to do we don't need caterpillars we don't need [Music] [Applause] do you know the words do you know the words it's a six name one a six lane one in weed it's one wide six lane you know six vehicles can be moving without and you're thinking that just randomly what does that got to do silence what was in that seat nobody knew what we need to know because that is the path for raj that is why it was called it will keep rapturing get straight for your rapture [Music] it is the refiner for the bride that's right the followers who are gathered up to that i can never take that it is only meant for the redeemed people who are counted to go in the rapture it is not everybody remember through the wilderness experience a lot of people fell back only 2 out of two million the multitude you saw where children born along the way did you get that when we come to california there was no more quora there was no more data there was no more habit did you realize that there were [Applause] but they couldn't take the open sleeve they couldn't even wait enough to get the open seat the dream of brother junior jackson the pyramid oh am i true the pyramids amen inside this place are revelations the prophet said i always thought they were outside the bible he said but i realize that god cannot give a blessing outside of his word it takes about sin to make him know that hallelujah that is going to be the mystery content of this amen church we are not giving a close by billion believers and christians in the world are closed are carrying close fires but there's a few remnants for which this close bible has been opened until it was opened in revelation 6 and revelation 8 by revelation 10 it was completely open waiting for that bride waiting for that job to turn the open door [Applause] and do what we did [Applause] keep walking keep walking one day hey [Applause] [Music] loose these heels is the shout out amen glory to god you love him this morning they cut it open and he said he has interpreted things written around it but he couldn't tell of that precious story that was inside it the only thing they told them look upon this and watch and what where did he started going he was going to sunset arizona amen in order to have this encounter that will give him the church to come back to serve us over in order to do what to reveal the revelation declares what a new day the rising of the sun but these these people were told to wait wait till that time come on charge the building block for foolishness the bible said while the prophet disappeared the story said why the prophet disappeared a lot started looking away amen as the enough as ignore don't ask me look for yourself by the time majority saw is gone so far they started telling themselves now that is god what do you think this means and each person each person who disobeyed the command to look started fashioning down their interpretation of what they taught their job meant that is where around the seventh seal there has been so many theories but this is the very evidence that there is the truth somewhere um hallelujah later the prophet was referring to it is i remember you know jackson's dream when i told them to wait they never waited is the reason today people are teaching things preaching things that i am not responsible for the prophet said i'm making denominations out of the rights for thanksgiving this amen the message of the short king by the temple amen amen whoever tells you that the festival of the prophet uh was the shout he told you in life that's right and you see human beings have a way of appropriating because it is three the first is uh the second is the boy the third is the trumpet would you know better than james amen it was because you thought the prophet must do everything it is christ that was doing it was christ that the prophet foreign amen himself when it does appear i must decrease and he must increase each brother which did not decrease he brought the shout on his fear and he went quiet just as john did what happened there the ministry of the laodicean age messenger gave way to the ministry of the lord jesus christ himself that was when the prophet could come and say you are not feeding on me but you are feeding on the unfailing body watch of the son of man i was not the one that appeared at while i was only the person nearest when he appeared a man is what we fail but you are not feeding on me we are feeding we are having communion on the body and blood of jesus christ that is the message of their power the mighty india took over and that was why the interpretation of the bible the prophet said came better than my own personal judgment from that moment it was no longer the thoughts or theories of willie brown or any better for that matter it became the fullness of god this was why in revelation 10 the mighty just church that is your preparation that is your rapture there that is what we give you rapturing face that was the shout that you needed to pull out the jericho walls of your life and get into your inheritance hallelujah that is the message of the house now how does this preview how does it prepare you i'll give you a time how many of us will be prepared for rapture let me just give you a trip and close this is your love dreaming now amen this is how you trim your life there was a time a king needed a queen amen they call him hazuras 127 the promises of america is about 52 and yet it's one of the largest nations under heaven even in science canada and i need to go in science not in population are you cutting them now foreign and the wise men said that if we allow this to go all the women will never regard their husband so vashti must not come into the king again by this spiritual denominations was put away to make room for a new brand [Applause] everything god wanted to do has done [Applause] [Music] [Applause] was to be selected because before each bride could become queen she must be prepared to meet the king amen she must treat allah this is your love trinidad amen did you hear me the bible said it wasn't only one particular girl there were several girls who were pure vegetables they have the potential to be the queen are using the vegan concept again [Applause] let's see those who can endure let's see they watch amen this is not long time this is spiritual london enough what in the light and there was no muslim walk with god it's all about walking until you struck the king's highway let's watch it next time amen another glorious time here amen amen amen so esther was among the veterans and then for the first six months nobody had any idea they give them some cleansing materials and after the cleansing material you are now left to get appearing materials you see you see in the past six months the first full second full economy there was no discrimination everybody enjoyed this thing it is the top book that makes a difference are you catching it when it now comes to god meets the king which is the rapture on how to prepare themselves for the rapture it's in your mind [Music] yes give me this give me that everybody has to interact with one person they call him he's a chamberlain a chamberlain and you know he's got no seats forgive nobody but you see this man is not useless because this is [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i have a message for them if somebody has been doing good for 40 years i cannot stop doing it for one year i did not came upon him what did the bible say yeah [Music] if you only work on your time you will become one you become cannon it will never move the bride you cannot intimidate these end times because this entire bride doesn't look away to a man he looks away to jesus even if god will meet his next true man yes but he looks up unto god and god touches us for nothing around his blessing we will never hold the faith of our lord jesus christ with the respect of persons if you are doing this topic because you will be able to tell the truth you will be able to stand for the truth hypocrites will never make it no be loving church you love him praise god you got the all interacted with anger in the dispensation where nothing seems different because when it comes to the rapture it becomes a message of identification you so you must get your preparation with the inspiration of your destination no matter how bad the world is getting there will be a glorious breath [Applause] because this bride came from somewhere and they must get back there and in this hour the lord will release the anointing the spirit of supplication the inspiration that will drag them back home that will tell them it is ongoing they must have the desperation that is our comfort so don't take the wrong influence you know where you are going you don't know where the next person is sitting by you is going let every man be his own body praise god [Applause] so each of this veteran came and started asking a guy what they wanted give me this give me that give me this give me that i [Music] they will be taken care of there will be generations who are in the message yes they will be taken care of it was the same christ who took care of judah's character and was it not the same ground the dynamics and the mechanics of judas was in the end of christ and so the dynamics and the mechanics of the real 11 disciples were also in the house of christ amen is the light out every life must interact with life in order to prosper and manifest them that they are common the bible says when it comes to the tone of this particular girl they call her esther generation extra people where are you hallelujah [Applause] the prophet said when you rotated off of the body of christ in eternity you were not deceived by the one who deceived two thoughts the same was too dead in heaven so we stand here on him [Applause] [Music] it is all the work of grace from glory to glory i love that and [Music] nothing will happen the land will fall upon me in goodly places i must have been good i must take possession i must possess the gate of the enemy they can't defeat me i will defeat them [Applause] i was identified with joshua and killers the generations that were not deceived or influenced by the child they are my branch i will eat them i will kill them i will swallow them digest them nothing [Applause] are you thinking again you can take care of this but not this business no no no no esther sir hey guys what do you need let's not smile what [Music] [Applause] you are the one you see the revelation separated out you are the one that knows the king you know you are used to him whatever you think the king lost you've got no thoughts you just ascend his thoughts amen i live by the faith of the son of not by my faith in the son of god loser it will be my belief my opinion but in this case esther told the guy i've lost my mind amen if i lose my mind it needs a replacement which one do you want to replace but let the monster was saying gospel just give me the mind of god when it takes over christ becomes my heart better it becomes my revelation it becomes the center of my life it becomes my affection it becomes my top it becomes my hole in heart it becomes my dressing it becomes my hardship it becomes my reaction it becomes everything to me [Applause] [Music] give me that christ i know he's not christ he revealed what that is why when the prophet was talking about the mystery class amen you know he always turned the picture sideways upside down in one way then the god who knows the right angles came and said as long as you have a slanted position you cannot see what you should be saying keep the position correct and your eyes will be open and when it bonded to the right angle behold the eyes of christ the nose of god the mouth of god brother abraham's dream and it was our lord not our congregation this is what we are being gathered from nations to nations the blight is being guided by the message of the show and what is gathering us is preparing us walking upon the atoms of our body changing us from glory to glory until that change we come to a perfection amen and it should be a time to work for christ to do what connects the day amen so you have a job in that you're ripping it we signify the readiness to call out the dead and they will be called up by the same voice the work of lazarus how lazarus had it what it meant to him amen wait for the dead saints to rise up they will tell us about it then we hear the voice of the archangel that voice is not meant for the living saints are you listening to me the accept the simplicity of the message after the opening of the seals in the messenger rapture from the problem resurrects the saints the self-worth in john chapter 11. yes that's right it is not for you amen it is for persons who are followed when they hear it they will tell us the experience i am not fighting over nonsense amen let me deal with myself hallelujah leave their voice for those whom it is meant for because is to get them home for us to have a united gathering amen the prophet said god has so arranged it that you and i will not wait to get to heaven to see those who made it we shall see ourselves here like 30 to 40 days of fellowship because we are connected with the same material when you blend into that dimension give god thanks when you begin to see the saints who have come back you are blending to another you blend them into another dimension because it is only then you can see one another on this up for 30 to 40 days we're going to have a fellowship we're going to have a campaign we don't have a revival after which we shall do what happens to make the fifth rapture the first was enoch the second was elijah amen the tenth was the lord jesus christ the fourth was the old testament saints hallelujah the fifth will be us because as enoch was seven from either we are the seventh church age from pentecost so rapture will take place in this age their preview was seen it has been spoken it will happen there without us we are the generation paul was talking [Applause] [Music] how do we come to our preparation the prophet said watch upon what because before rapture the spirit of the lord will be withdrawn amen there have been no more salvation there have been no more repentance there will be no more conviction the voice of god's work will pour down but not to change people in the tribulation but to make them eat god's demon because the spirit of god has been withdrawn but while we can get out the spirit i invite you my brother i invite you my sister i invite you saints who are still having a crisis of up and down god can stabilize your testimony keep it consistent and growing by the message of preparation our love dreaming is to each the message is to keep checking the word to see our life don't tell me those words and we go from glory to glory until we come to full measure praise god and one day the trumpet will sound like it will be something loud and clear in such that there will be a gathering trumpet gathers the living and the dead will be resurrected with god and they will be prepared for their flight when you see us flying off our comfort zone when you see us takes dimension our truck beds are there amen and so shall we ever be with them because from the wedding supper from the rapture christ will never separate from us again we have to wait and support together we have the millennium together we sit in the white room judgment together hallelujah are we led into a tender living god
