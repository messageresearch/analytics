and your grace extended to us we're wretched miserable but your love lord reach down to pick us up out of the my reclaim father we bless you we invite you no minutes to have the preeminences have the oversight look into our lives and god maybe not leave it the same we came but may you visit us in a special way in the name of jesus we bless your wonderful name and father pray you visit maury mitchell in a special way also with your healing virtue and touch in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated okay keep on playing birth stephen where would i be that's my testimony i don't know

this morning [Music] hallelujah while you sit in your seat just think about him many things upon his love meditate about his grace meditate about his supernatural presence and power amen where would i be where would we be this morning if grace please us where we are who are we to knock somebody out beat somebody up sit down in somebody's head walk on somebody's back who's somebody and we are only where we are but the grace of god we are in the palm of his hand if you move it before so be careful you're in the palm of his hand if you shift it you're going to fall so you're here by the grace of god do you know what a revival is a revival is a move of god in power not man moving [Music] god moving that's what the prophet said the revival is what say it after me a move of god in power not in talk in power power to cast out devils power to heal the sick power for sinners to come at the altar power of the people around the altar without even making an altar call that's a move of god not a man move but a god move and when god decided to move no man could stop him no one could hinder him when god decided to move on your life or your family life nothing going to stop it because your season has come your hour has come and when your overcome nobody can change that stop that rearrange that what god bless no man oh i am happy this morning where would i be where would you be but for the grace of god you have something to shout about you have activity in your limbs you could tell stand up you can still raise your hands you can still shake your neck a little bit praise god hallelujah praise god hallelujah you still have something to shout about sit down you may have failed god you may have sinned but i don't think you have committed the unpardonable sin so there is still room for blood there is still room for redemption there is still room for restoration i don't think you will be here if you are committed unpardonable sin because you're here this morning i mean there's a desire in your heart to be reconciled to god and to get closer to god and once there's a desire in your heart there's a god that could meet you and meet that desire that's in your heart [Applause] amen so last sunday we had by these precious revealed promises of the title the subject was partakers of his divine nature and the inspiration was possessing your individual inheritance this is the challenge here that last one possessing your individual inheritance because what people have learned for the past hundred years or two these two changes thing is is a group thing it's it's church thing and and sad to say it doesn't have that at the end of the day you have to say like caleb now therefore give me my mount amen amen there's a couple of things saturday no therefore right now give to me not them it's my own my means ownership mountain we have to take notice that give me my plane we just walk flat in it it's a mountain you have to look up you have to climb you have to make an effort the mount is not falling on you you have to take it it's not coming to you that is one mountain that's not moving that is mountain must be taken so you have to say i want it it's mine faith is mine come on virtue that's mine's true what about knowledge what about temperance what about patience what about godliness there's divine nature it's a mountain hallelujah and the higher your goal is the less people you see give it all a shout out you may be seated glory the higher you go the less people you see because it gets steeper it gets sharper you get more cuts you get more bruises you get more honing you get more tryouts because you're bringing forward fruit he has to prune you to bring forth more fruit you have to get much fruit is there people in the house this morning that want to give the lord a shout out oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah okay [Music] so your behavior is what sets you up to adoption that is why it's not only ministers going to be adopted they're going to be some sisters that are going to be adopted also my god and that those sisters they are not going to be preaching sisters they're going to be living sisters living [Music] there's not like mother teresa you know this is not that same thing you know this is living since hallelujah praise god do you believe that sons and daughters going to be adopted do you believe that hallelujah so this is just recapping but i want to just strike something small or just thinking about it or put interviews and i might have it all together but i'll just see what come to my mind sometimes you're going to interview everybody at the same qualification have a degree you have subject and so on but then they filter you further than that a little deeper than that because that is just intelligence passing papers and whatnot and job skills and stuff like that there's something called a psychometric test it's a big word it's not a common word but it's designed to test your behavior and tendencies because the people want the best people for their company they want to have the best fit so having the best qualifications doesn't mean you have the best fit you may not be you may be anti-social they may not want to mix with others you may be like to work solo and that job may cause for a non-solo worker you have to interact with many many people so they have these tests and they give stories acts a way of fit in the family if you get an accident and this happens how you're gonna behave and you don't know what they're looking for you just give answers and sometimes people feel that even though they have the degree and they have the qualifications but because of different personality issues and pro they want to profile you that is what they look for then they could snatch you up into the company and get the very best and the company only could be great as the people in it are great the company could only be powerful as the people that are powerful so these companies they want the best so let's flip it now our god he runs the company [Applause] a company of saints [Applause] hallelujah a company of believers people are qualified they have books they have tapes you may be seated they know what the prophet said they know what in this book and in this table and that book they qualify but then they have something called a psychometric test god doesn't have that name it have the behavioral test have a virtuous test my test and character so then the interviewer come and give her this trial and that trial to see how you gonna behave if they're gonna pass that test oh hallelujah is that who gonna talk the talk is we're gonna walk that talk oh glory to god that life really shakes up you know oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that i wanted to get that to you it's a little more than written word so there's a more than saying i believe it's a little more than that we said the same power this is called somebody branham just summarizing for last week just to connect to this sunday same power when jesus rest in placed sons in the body of christ specific placed sons but ibrahim under the joshua commission took us over into the new holy ghost land on the back of the book he said break to us the seals on the back of the book because joshua entered in his land to divide the inheritance of the people so he put the back of the book the seven thunders as the new land of promise holy ghost man he went even deeper he said we are now living by the evidence of the new land the son of man so this salman is the evidence of the new land and the son of man is the word revealed so he malachi 4 came to introduce this tournament this sunderland was veiled in asana man so he's on boxes and tapes his mysteries hidden right there being unfolded to his elect so we are now even in 2016 living by the evidence of the new land we are now i'm saying again we are now living by the evidence of the new land somebody crossed over somebody went back and bring a testimony it has spoken word in it it has stopped any elements in it it have creation in it it has before the doctors and touches my wife the tumor will go down you have that in it and i have little fishy i give you back your life it's that resurrection and that somebody went over and brought a witness that we are not normal people we're not ordinary people we belong to a different class we belong to a god class [Applause] oh give the lord a shout you sit there looking at me normal normal normal and you are different blaster people all together why is god the bible said the people that know their god shall be strong and the great exploits my god you can't sit there like you want nobody praise god wonder the best that's why he leave you for last oh he leave the best for tell somebody that you leave the best there's somebody there [Applause] [Applause] i know some of you are going to fight to see a man you know because you don't believe you're the best but that's not you judging that is that you judging yourself is that you call yourself is who he for you he called you can't feel like the best there's not a feeling job jesus never said feel as though this he said believers though this so i'm not asking you to believe you are the best i'm asking to believe god [Applause] he wasn't calling because you're troublesome you know you call it because your name on the book [Applause] that is all that's all you call it because you have gray hair black yet because you're tall you're short whatever it is in this family you're gonna put your outer space you still have to come you're not hearing what i'm saying i became your mother was a prostitute and the father was a drunkard he said have to come i don't care who god put you as your parents because you can't choose them come on now you couldn't choose your mother or your father or could we get there's a lot of shout neither could you choose who your father is hallelujah jesus i come from god i go back to god you're gonna get a revival you're gonna get a revival it belongs to you [Music] let me be seated oh hallelujah praise god still trying to find myself here amen so this promised land is to live in the land of the holy spirit and the guide was released by the prophet first 1966 that guide that he preached on was to guide us to a wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness no come like a child riding a bike you have to have extra wheel three wheel extra wheel because the child doing all the balance here after a while the two wheels at the side one will go on and then the other training will go on and the child is on his own then it's no more a conscious effort to ride it's a unconscious effort jump on the bike and ride but the child didn't automatically get there it had extra wheels to train him that he become accustomed to this movement well you can't just get them virtues and just get there you have to have some training wheels that exercise in wheels that you can exercise the virtue and exercise the patients and exercise your gut and exercise you have to have some training wheels you have to have an effort to ride that bike and after a while it will be operating in you from your subconscious level where you're not trying to be nice because you're a christian and you're supposed to be nice no no no you're just nice because you're just nice oh god give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah shall be talking about what we are preaching becoming ingrained in your spirit in other words the word started to become flesh said is that a ooze outside of you holla do you understand what i'm saying you choose not to be a church member they're just listening and just listening like they're just listening but you are elect that the word that you're hearing becomes a conductor of the spirit to get into your life because what you're hearing is at a mental level but there's a channel hallelujah that drops down from the mind to the heart [Applause] so but the brandon said the mind is the womb to the soul so you're not really here to be entertained you're not just here to be informed you're here to be in the spirit that this spirit could reveal his word to you or give the lord a shout our praise you may be seated are we going to go into scriptures so don't waste one minute of this service [Applause] let's do like this the last service you're going to hear hallelujah the wrath of god is about to strike and this is the last service you want every word when you leave here you can pray for your children when they leave you they can say devil get out right now you have to hear what i'm saying i don't have the power but i have the authority to cast you out [Applause] at this point before we approach the scriptures you have no enemies outside. don't blame your wife your husband your brother sister father mother uncle thank you boss neighbor nobody it's just you you and your demons [Applause] [Music] you and your struggles you and your battles that you're going to have victory over because before jesus was loosed under his word of adoption god loosed him into wilderness first nothing no crowd not with a bunch of decrees back and then jesus you can make it you can make it jesus i with you he was led by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome all by himself say after me all by myself that's how it's going to be good with lord a shout in the house when you overcome himself got to trust him [Music] here are the principles and laws but imam said usually when somebody gets blessed they get buffed up hit them there's somebody god only i don't drop him go testing them i'll drop a blessing now that drop from god is a big drop but it's still a drop you have a whole pointer a love and blessing deport upon you a little drop and all of a sudden you stop coming to church oh you know what i'm feeling you're up there somewhere so god looking for somebody the more he blesses is the more humble they become and for the ministry he said take a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ into present tense so all the promises are there waiting for faith in somebody's heart to make it come alive are you going to make it come alive but i branham said a minister cannot bring a revival so super preacher super personality that's finished holla waste of time try to hold on to some man waste our time don't even try that here the revival have to come by the people you have to bring the revival you got to know what's in you you have to be a revivalist you have to come to make something happen you have to come to start the fire if you had to hot the coals on the stove hot it on the stove but afterwards it'd have to catch a fire you have to blow [Applause] but do something don't let that fire go out don't let the fire i don't think a little i don't think burning soul a little smoke a little amen come and blow on it wave on it say amen on it shout on it but my god don't let the devil out the light that's in your soul [Applause] trying to get fast as i could [Music] in the early church god was the god of the audience god of the people they took god from the audience and put it on a man eventually become a pope god said i hate it i hate it the deeds of the nicolaitans where the laity suffers conquered and something came back to me with brother branham on the platform on the discernment watch this he's on the platform people get numbers and have to fight for numbers and get numbers to get in the prayer line you have to up the platform all of a sudden he's going to somebody and see the pillar fire move over there that woman across there so and so don't struck me god's the god of the audience god hell always nobody to interfere once the audience pulled that fire they have to get it so the prophet is up here but the audience fire pulling so he you have to move with the fire and i'm saying god is a god of the audience you could pull that fire you could pull that anointing you could pull your healing don't worry about the preacher don't worry about the preacher give the lord a shout in the in the house glory glory glory glory hallelujah so watch this even though the person on the platform god put prominence to what was happening in the congregation with faith pulling on the pillar of fire your faith could pull on that fire that god could give you what you have need of before you even go home the sick person that you have home they could be healed by your faith oh could we stand this morning o blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah we want to go into the scriptures deuteronomy 29 verse 29 colossians 1 verse 26 to 29 revelation 4 verse 1 to 5. my title this morning is god's purpose expressed through the acts of believers god's purpose expressed through the acts of believers my subject is what god's great goal is i phrase it that way the way but ibrahim said it i could have said what is god's great goal but i put it what god's great goal is inspiration becoming a partaker of his divine nature so let's read deuteronomy 29 verse 29 god bless you welcome there are some believers here from the world trade thank you cease the water now only god bless you welcome to our sunday morning service reading from uh deuteronomy 29 verse 29 the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of the lord colossians 1 reading from verse 26 even the mystery which had been hit from ages and from generations but now is made manifested his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus way unto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me my today and revelation chapter 4 you want to read from verse 1 to 5. after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be here after and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sad line stone and there was a rainbow wronged about the throne in sight like unto an emerald wrong about the throne were 420 seats and upon the seats i saw 120 elders sitting clothed white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god let's pray father we thank you for your word god may you inspire the word to our hearts this morning we wait on you with a pill of fire drop down here this morning and speak life to your people oh god in jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated oh praise god that title again god's purpose expressed through the acts of his believers habakkuk 2 says i will stand up on my watch and set me up on a tower and will watch to see what he will see unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readed it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie do it terry whitfield it shall surely come hallelujah write the vision and make it plain well that's what brother branham came on to to do right to the bride of vision and over 40 50 plus years the vision was supposed to be made plain to the people that we could run that we could act not that we could just read but that we can do these are action words the secret things belong to god but the things that are revealed all these promises belong to us and to our children what's the purpose that we may do all the words of the law so the object is not just for informational purposes the object is to get us into action the object is to influence us to perform and to achieve and to fall into a channel of god's purpose and god's accomplishment that we can act as believers walk as believers talk as believers live as believers not unbelievers not make believers but as believers do you believe that oh glory to god amen so put a after the seals after all these great mysteries he came up and said this message going to summarize everything this one message and he preached the message called the token it's the greatest message and inspiration to preach he said was to talk and i want to just bring some things back there's a purpose that we're doing this this morning think about it now it had trumpets vials thunders seals mysteries and yet he zoomed into a target of the token when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you and that's the even time message is to apply the token he is zeroing to a bullseye it have a lot of loose ends a lot of things but what happened the gardener eden and information on the pope and rome and los angeles and all of that and all that is frills around the target but the target the bullseye what you're aiming at what you're longing for what you're pressing on to is the token oh could we give the lord a shout [Applause] in the house no no no paul said it this way he didn't say i pressed towards the mark he didn't say that he said forgetting the thing that i passed [Music] i press you want to press you have to forget did you hear me did you hear what i'm saying if you want to hit target you can't be hitting target and you're looking so you're looking so you're looking so [Applause] i come like your olympics and you're running and looking at this one is a race you're taking time off to drink some juice you're looking to come last you know you want to say you already run listen ahead of us it's just two things rapture or tribulation if you get quiet inside [Applause] but if you want to stay here that's fine i'm not staying with you no i'm not staying with no church no tribulation i appreciate there'll be no tribulation trying to understand why i missed it no no no i'm not doing that i'm preaching because there's a rapture [Music] and there's a rapture because listen listen this is important there is no way out [Applause] you could put two things in the ears and hear music whole day that can't get you out you could sing message songs all day that can still get you out you could put some books and sleep on it that still can't get you out there's only one way out faith virtue knowledge diamond temperance patience godliness the same way enoch went out enoch walk with god and was not hallelujah not with church he walked with god oh give the lord some praises people some of you need some props to walk you have to have this friend you have to have this family member you have to you know it's not god first it's family first family second family third you have to walk with god alone friend or no friend sink or drunk get his bomb whether i maintain my family or not let me maintain christ because that's the mystery what's the mystery christ in you hope of glory this mystery that was hidden from ages no being men manifest what is going to be christ where in some book no in some prophet back there no christ in you so all what we are coming into is to produce grace in you the hope of glory are you with me let's go then the blood was a token for identification the blood watch that the worshiper had slain the lamb if there was no blood it mean the lamb alive and kicking the fact there's blood is because you killed the lamb you put your hands on the lamb and you're all bloodied up when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you you have to kill the lamb to get the blood it means a price has been paid it means you apply to the doorpost because the death angel person not the pastor not the deacon not the church elder not some nice brother not some precious minister brother person it is that angel he's not asking what church you belong to he's not asking who your pastor is when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you come on help me somebody help me preach that's my problem zoomed in on the token he zoomed in on the target [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory my so many people what all right and he was not a shame he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it it was placed in a position that everybody passing by could see that token listen young people young people in particular everybody could have seen that talk and the dopplers yes so many people want to be christians they want to do it secretly nobody would know that they were christians they associate they run around with some of them think well you know i want to become a christian but i don't want someone so to know about it you see that's not christianity christianity has to display its token publicly [Applause] so it have no private christianity i'm a private person that you're a private person but that's not what has been taught here christianity has to have the token praise god it's a public thing so you use a public servant not the government kinda public life at the office on the street when troubles are wrong in the church everywhere the blood is a token and the token must be applied must be say it again say it again apply no we're not even talking about the private talk about displaying it coming to but before you can display it you have to apply it hallelujah they talked they got hyssop baron said was coming wheeze take his up i just dip it in the blood and apply it and adopt when i see the blood i'm going to pass away the blood was a token of identification identifying this person was redeemed and they were redeemed before anything had happened by faith they applied the blood before it actually happened the blood was applied by faith believing it was going to happen because the wrath of god passed through the land the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the rat had fallen so judgment is set it's not coming it is already set it is fixed the judgment of god arrow has already been loosed there's only one way to be under the blood under the token under god's covenant he's not talking about your sins he's not talking about your failures he's not talking about your shortcoming he's not talking about that he's talking about the blood he's talking about the token he's talking about they come home he understands that same with the woman at a well he made him want to well he wasn't coming to talk about the sins of failures how much man she had of a man she went who she would know he wasn't talking about that he come to tell her her name is under book woman if you understand your name is in the book you'll be liberated you'll be free yes you'll break out [Music] you would realize you don't have to live that way no more and who the son of man set free it's free indeed come on give the lord some praises now watch when i see the blood i will pass over you nothing else would work it must be the blood now the holy ghost is our talking hallelujah did you hear that the holy ghost is our token i don't know what our people have as their token but for us the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] not this church is your token sorry i am not your token amen hallelujah i hope you get that good right yeah hold on to my pastor he's been talking not this man not this one the holy ghost is the token and when you apply it you apply it nobody can unapply it [Applause] you apply it as an individual to your house somehow there are people that are not seeing amen [Music] i'm preaching the word [Applause] email no i'm not preaching down to you you know what i'm hearing you hearing do you know this is for me also you know [Music] you mean this is for you but over yes you mean the playing field level yes you mean we're on the same page yes you mean we all waited on the promise of god yes you mean we we're all waiting for dynamics yes you mean you're not up here and we are down here no you mean we all in the upper room yes you will be all under the promise of god yes all looking for inheritance oh yes okay the lord i shout in the house [Applause] the token today is the spirit but abraham said paul i could get my body to be burned and sacrificed all my blood goods to feed the poor i have faith in a mountain and so forth i am nothing until the token has been applied until this token that i'm speaking about tonight the love brothers even until the love now until this has been applied i am nothing god expect us to go beyond the love of our own brethren because jesus bless his own disciples and tell them except you exceeded your righteousness private spirit you're just like them they they love their own too you have to love your enemies you have to do better than them you have to go beyond where you are you can just love your own family alone love your own kind love your own what you think is your own no you've got to love like god love come on now come on same as somebody you got to be able to express the love of god so all them husband and wife chorus where that going all that fussing in the home what whatever it's about [Applause] that's not even a test most of the time is a bunch of foolishness everybody want to have their own rights and nobody want to eat humble pie i'm a pie just too small oh pie let's make it humbling must bake some more instead of the argument pie or the coral pie and he picked some humble pie hallelujah jesus taught it not robbery to be equal with god but humbled himself and became obedient to go to the cross everybody want to be somebody everybody want to show up the muscle all right so i don't care you might cast or devils you might heal the sick the prayer of faith you might have done these things but if that talk is not there you are under the right of god you might be a believer hear this you might stand in the pulpit and preach the gospel amen but obama was leveling it out he said many will come to me he given a scripture in that day and said after i cast out devils in the name that's methodist baptist pentecostal jesus depart for me you were iniquity i never knew you but when i see the token i'm gonna pass over you then he said the evening time message is to apply the token so if he brought a seven thunder seven seal message the purpose of that message for us to apply the token the token is your assurance it is your assurance guaranteed [Music] hallelujah guaranteed that everything will be all right [Music] glory you may be seated listen let's go back to egypt blood has been applied the children under pressure in the daddy's home question they were asking about are you he sure son moses said that god told him moses is the messenger of the age moses brought the word of the lord moses said took a lamb i took the lamb moses said kill the lamb children i killed the lamb moses said take the blood and put it on the doorpost children i did that and if i did what god said the devil could watch but he can't touch he could come near but he can't come in he could go over but he can't come here because god said when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over give the lord praises in the house there's gonna be a move of god there'll be a move of the spirit of god the spirit will be applied to your life come on jump into it move into it oh hallelujah [Applause] maybe see that few houses lower down have some priests or some elders they say we in this thing a long time we printed you over a long time we are feeling led to apply no blood no seven thunder blood no seven sealed blood we don't have to apply faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of god which are the seven spirits of god god don't have seven spirits it is one holy spirit manifested in seven parts through seven churches god divided the holy spirit but in the last year he has gathered it up to bring back the token to bring back his spirit or give the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god do you see it glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah holland this is the message this is william branham's message the token okay [Applause] of shaking hands and evidences and everything like that forget it the all has arrived that the token itself not some counterfeit or make believe or anything the talking has got to be there watch now the holy spirit but the life that was in the blood is a token unto you the holy ghost is the token what's the token what's the token sage out lord what's the token the holy ghost is the token hallelujah now the spirit is the token and then he quote you shall be filled with the holy ghost not many days hence that was the team of every apostle it was have you received the holy ghost since you believe repent every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost apply a church don't fail will you now don't don't don't let the sun set don't don't don't rest day or night don't take any chances it won't work children it won't work you must have the token these are not my words these are the prophet's words speaking to random tabernacle he's telling them it won't work let's go on you say i believe i believe the message that's all right but that's good but you must have the token he said do you hear branham tabernacle you must have the token displayed so then he went from token to it displayed it means faith have to come out but you have to come out knowledge have to come out temperance and have to come out it has to come from the inside to the outside they have to apply it on the inside and it will ooze out on the outside and when i begin to come out as the word become flesh among us and when the word becomes flesh it brings the spirit the spirit is evident that the word has become flesh all glory now that god was the great functional spirit he was so mysterious he formed himself into the lord's body called the word a theophany oh hallelujah he wanted to express himself and then in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and then the word became flesh so this divine spirit function of spirit wanted a way to get into man [Music] [Applause] too mysterious hallelujah you say you must have the token do you hear about them tamaraca you must have taken this place without it all you believe in is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the words say you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when i see the blood that's the token i'm talking here watch he said moses time he had to see the actual chemistry because the life had gone it was an animal but now the life itself is the token not the books and tapes people get fight with me when i talk about books and things if i against books and tapes oh it could be a case book until i read it from the books but i'm saying having the books on tape on the bottom top of your head that's not the talk knowing where abraham said this and paragraph and page number and whatnot that's not the token other people used to write that off until the program come on the computer don't need to have that all in your head you could just do a research like long time you have all of my encyclopedias inside video set some big books on your juice one spin page like all these spinning pages like that no google just replace all of that that's what age we're living in god bring the pop the message right into your hands you have a phone number right there you can just get the message any code you want right inside your hands what do you think god wanted to decide how to read read read read you have to run had a conflict inside of you that's the problem everybody reading everybody knowing everybody quoting but who's going to live and thunder when they ever see them coming run run run look they come in they come and they somebody have a big spoken book sign up so they're definitely moving they will come and snap right back to them and he spoke on book two because i never believed in trembling so he had books everybody above never line up with them too but when that life starts to come the devil says wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hallelujah that's the thunder that takes the devil hallelujah there's coming a short quick message let's shake the whole nation oh hallelujah praise god what about him let me tell you today as a servant unless the token is on the door there is spiritual that's going to strike all churches are heading back for the council of churches they are all going back to catholicism and the only those who are genuine born again is going to stay out remember not your pentecostal denominations cause you're already in it show that they're dead they're perish they put him outside the door and he's looking for the token because the only thing they rely on speaking in tongues don't you rely upon not speaking in tongues no nothing else but let the token itself be there and he says the person of jesus christ his own life in you so friends we have no room to gossip to be indifferent to to lose time and be distracted we have to have a burden to receive the life of jesus christ what do you do when you apply to your house what do you do move all the trash out you get all the short skirts the cards the cigarettes the televisions you kick them out the door when you apply the token won't stand still for it take it out all the dancers parties rock and roll falcon newspapers all the stuff of the world cater out the door and say we are cleaning out the place along here so to apply the token is to do something about your situation just like the coin of brotherly kindness to find that coin you have to clean up the place because that point was lost and you want to find your brotherly kindness right fine you have no kindness whatsoever brotherly or sisterly otherwise so the coin lost so you need to find that coin and baram says she began to sweep the floor and scrapped up she kept until she found it when she found her she called her sisters and her brother churches come and rejoice with me i found a coin if they don't wanna rejoice that is their business but you you found your coin hallelujah they're not happy with you unhappy for you that is their problem but you are rejoicing because you could forgive now you could you could drop your orcs now you could call for charity now when you stand praying for him the person the talk and the holy ghost you have no oughts in your heart then you're ready for the holy ghost because god gave the holy ghost to them who obey him and the blood for the age is brotherly kindness so we're going to make sure to have enough around you enough people to match your corn if you have people to hurt you in different ways to see what you're going to do he's not testing them he is testing you hear what i'm saying this morning oh give the lord some praises let me say it again he is not testing them they are there to hurt you they are just inflicting on you and you are there to act like christ father forgive them they don't know what they are doing or give the lord some praises in the house jesus on the cross nails in his hands fire abundant bunch of rascals i raised the dead i healed his sick i feed him with bread and fish look at them ungrateful people [Applause] no no he may have rights to do that a good thing good thing is jesus christ but in that pain in that suffering he expressed something because it was the key for the resurrection he is moving into power he's suffering he's in pain but he's still living the blood for his age voice for his age bradley kindness because resurrection power is next and when we hit that stop step we go into the prison of the king because bradley khan is the top of the pyramid given the right to enter into the king's chamber like queen esther with the scepter of authority and dominion whatever you want queen esther up to half my kingdom oh hallelujah praise god but you have to be on a platform of forgiveness no hearts no grudges no jealousy no envy just a cleaned out life waiting for your lover your husband your mate even christ the revealed word to come to you oh glory to god but obama said we'll take more than the power of gifts it will take more than joining church it will take the birth of the holy spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great christian body moving for one objective and one goal let's continue hallelujah from what what does it take to make a christian life god intended his church to be a powerful church a glorious church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of christ well expected and exposed to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that god will be proud of this church to present it to christ at the coming of the lord watch he said now if the church okay god never intended the church to be governed by denomination neither by creeds if god only intended for the church to be governed or carried by creed and denomination and intellectuals then we do not need the holy spirit in the church its success will be placed upon intellectuals of the best of us the better intellectual we would have the more church progressive we will be but in the word i find that god did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by theology of man but the holy spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of christ amen does any man try to govern the body of christ that's a real serious thing you know because he could govern bodies but nothing but their crimes because that's an international bright body not a spirit body as we said on tuesday night when when you're baptizing water and you get put in water and you're buried identified god will take you on burying your spirit baptizing your spirit when you come back up you're soaking wet with spirit all inside your spirit your soul your body your being hallelujah your amen your dreams in the spirit of god that's what god wanted to do oh do you believe that oh praise the name of the lord i am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into position to wear their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of god that will be one of the most powerful churches ever existed now i know some of you know it some of you may not from blasphemous names sister shepard had a dream about the holy spirit passing over her and waters and different things like that and the rock box and honey being poured into it and so on and but iran went and explained the dream and says no group or no church could hold the holy ghost but the group as a group could hold the honey which is forgiveness that way you can't get bury kind by yourself you can shake your number god bless you forgive you i'll drop you out has to have a group where you interact with people when you get involved with people where you get disappointment and so on give you the opportunity to say i'm sorry forgive me i cannot see somebody go through the whole christian life with all saying i am sorry i cannot i cannot explain i cannot i don't accept that i i can't accept that even god repented at all and you can read that god repented what he's doing he's going to judge never never repent and god repented of his intention what he's going to do for the neighbor so said our words so broadly kindness spirit of forgiveness give us the opportunity to say i'm sorry forgive me and give you the opportunity to say i forgive you i forgive you you should want to say that i forgive you about sex no not that bad i forgive you should not do me that no no do like what god do father forgive them forgive as we forgive those who trespass against us god gonna forgive you just freely forgive drop it your visa don't stop already on your way to glory oh my hallelujah so watch i want to bring back something from there no he says no here is what wrong with the brand of tabernacle there are two kinds of faith there are two kinds of virtue two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperaments so we're not talking about painting the trainer itself for temperance we have assignment temperatures i have temperance now i have a button mark temperance what time i read and means your feet it doesn't work that way or somebody breathing in theater virtue it doesn't come in that way by breathing all these exercises and so on so it has the natural temperance natural patience natural knowledge have spiritual temperaments the temperaments of jesus christ the patience of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ after they get the blood transfusion amen and blood transfusion means they hook you up to the equipment and your blood going out and jesus is not coming in that brings in the blood of jesus it brings in the faith of jesus the virtue in other words you become a partaker of his divine nature by your blood going out so he become to get the preeminent in your life so listen how we bring it now patience right pretending to be a nature giving faith there's a nature giving faith and there's a need to give a virtue there are some people by nature they are patient they're very patient even job will be expressed impressed but but it's not the patient of jesus christ [Music] it's just that is how they are there's some people who can listen and listen and listen are there some people who could talk very very long they can't say good morning in two words they have to see it all over all over and there's somebody who patience and the patient and time going patience patience going that is not the patience of jesus christ the patients these guys surely have more things to do than that so you have natural patience i have jesus patience now listen to all about the brain i'm bringing it here now by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god but if this coming from above if it ever strikes this which is the holy spirit a godly spiritual fate then what does that faith do that faith only recognizes the word so when you hear the word it's a mental fate but when the holy ghost take that fate from here and drop it into here what changes is that faith could only recognize the word so somebody tell you you feel this and you feel that it doesn't go by feeling what does the word say [Applause] so no matter what anybody else says is only recognize the word because it's the word right so then the word itself is pouring into your feet our mental fate becomes a spiritual revelation i was a catholic but when the lord shine light and this message upon me it was revealed to me and that left me above all the criticism i got from my family so my family couldn't family couldn't stop me from breaking out because it was a revelation now if it was intellectual they could talk me out of it if it's intellectual anybody could talk you out of it so just with a different talk your mind twists and you somewhere else you think somewhere somehow different but if you have a revelation you can't nobody can talk you out of it because jesus said this way he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell is guaranteed not to prevail against it because the gates of hell will come against but it can't prevail so whenever god gives you a revelation it doesn't mean no opposition it just means it can't prevail hell will fight it but it can't prevail that's why jesus could tell them you can't touch me because my hour has not yet come [Music] hallelujah he knew he had to be crucified but he knew he had a ministry and they couldn't stop him before time hallelujah and when they thank him he said my hour is now come go give the lord some praise oh hallelujah so let me tell you something david said i was old no i was young no i'm all i've never seen the righteous forsaken or in seed-backed bread you are not going to bag bread forget about it the devil is a liar you are not going to be on the street you are not going to be homeless you are not going to be hungry you're not going to be unprotected [Applause] oh hallelujah give the lord a shout [Applause] let me be seated so the holy spirit coming down then he will give you a supernatural fate spiritual fate that faith only recognize the word not ministers and and churches of just the word just take the word and slam it on that believer they say that's amen that's the word that's the truth because there's an anchor inside the soul if the backslide it's still there peter but it was still there please i couldn't change it he denied christ but there was a rock inside of him that the devil could not dig out primo bulldozo ramo jamo [Music] oh hallelujah glory hallelujah [Applause] yeah i just believe in you know [Music] they believed god gideon was believing gideon until god has said how to believe me get gideon go accept that i'm at least in my father's house my father had at least traded he tried everybody at least at least least god said finish mighty minerva [Music] god had to tell that man that until it dropped from his head to his heart god said you know what take more than that say by the sword of the lord and of gideon [Applause] put your name in that battle put your name in that fight draw your sword hallelujah say you're son of god say your daughter of god sail overcome say he will break out reach out [Music] [Applause] [Music] some of you were imprisoned in your mind only in your mind but i come this morning [Music] i come to break out this morning break your own prison of your mind break out the prison of your limitations i have no education i can read i can't write to this this i know good job and what not forget all that break out all of that that has nothing to do with the program of god bobby said he needs patches of marriage somehow connected to this woman of the wealthy forgiveness i got tired preach upon her about her i will still be preaching about her you'll get where he hear me preach about him you guys feel just like that woman he needs passion my way to find me and since i see my name and they put the devil in trouble [Applause] [Music] hallelujah to pick up a seed to pick up a name in the book oh hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah so now watch number one coming down into a mental fate comes down the holy spirit so far there's mental fate but ram say intellectually we're hearing a message but it have to be done it has to get into spirit he said he said i believe we have received a message but we're hearing it intellectually his books and tape everybody's reading studying listening and so that's fine that's good you have to do that but then you have to get room for spirit to be done and get this intellectual thing more in the spirit thing or you're feeling good about yourself about your life about god you love jesus i miss your trial you love jesus you lost this you still love jesus you still love the lord you're sick but you love jesus you're not trying to duck hell you love jesus you're not trying to escape because you have no testimony whatever what are gonna happen take with the heavy lord why well i get in trouble in a job i remember some teachers in my job you said boy all the christians all the religions would have said no not this one i say i want to be a testimony to you guys i said that that diamond going on is easy enough is to leave your mark on earth it's one life you have to learn you want a real testimony and the testimony can only come when the tests come [Music] right though you write down everybody i believe everybody believe here but then when you go out satan waiting to see to qualify how much you really believe his whole easily even just disappear in that one day because the secret things belong unto god but the things that are revealed belong to us that's first thing once it reveals ours the prophet revealed that's ours nobody can say it's not yours it's yours deuteronomy 29 29 says oh [Applause] so every revealed promise is us give the lord every reveal promise belongs to us do i have a shout in the house for that [Applause] things that are revealed to us and to our children that we may do [Music] so watch are we going good number one coming down into your mental comes the holy spirit making it a spiritual fate then that spiritual faith this is imperimental recognizes only the word number two then you have a spiritual you have the holy spirit seal all these things into you as the holy spirit covers this here we go from your faith to the holy spirit what is he speaking about we don't have the pyramid here but they put in our faith virtual knowledge temperance patience godliness broadly kindness and on top broadly kindness have holy spirit so he has seen from your faith the holy spirit that slot seals you in with christ [Music] do you get that now faith mental faith conquer the holy ghost spiritual revelation damn there's a rock inside your soul god could drop in china it is still there australia is still there he could drop here in prison it is still there he could be wherever he dropped you it is still there nothing could move that that's a rock that is flesh and blood had not revealed it to you but my father had revealed it unto you that little pastor shared with you something can play it for you no it's a revelation in your soul hallelujah watch from your faith up to the holy spirit seals you with christ then you become one christ and you live together at that day you will know that i'm in the father father and me and i and you and you and me then here we go that's a sealed unit of the lord god no then there we go they are vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become vindicated sons and syndicated daughters right now we are just sons and daughters but when that time comes when that time comes when that time comes they become vindicated sons and vindicator daughters this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased oh give the lord some praises jesus christ a man approved of god [Applause] this is not people claiming this and claiming that and saying this this and saying that and raising their own flag this isn't that this is god's approval by vindication confirmation manifestation this is my son this is my daughter i am with her i am with him oh hallelujah when you walk god is walking i'm an angel of the lord and camp all around about you you are protected you are covered covered by a split covered by the token oh glory to god your life becomes overshadowed with god [Music] you may be seated i want to bring back something i read last sunday from man running from the presence of the lord of prayer but was praying he was seeing me all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us and we will see the plainness of god so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the lord jesus let's take that slowly may all the great mysteries that we're supposed to know at this age be unveiled to us what's the purpose that we might see the plainness of god listen carefully now this is my burden god was so mysterious he wanted to reveal himself his purpose and objective and goal was to reveal himself not for him to be mysterious so he had to find a way to unfold his great mystery of what he was so whenever he began to reveal himself it's supposed to produce the plainness of god it's supposed to produce a god in simplicity reveal himself to his people and he did that through jesus christ because christ his life unveiled god [Music] i wonder if you catch that people take the mysteries as a as an intellectual assault fighting argumentative tool i have one more machine on you i know more machines than you my mystery more hidden than your own a long time preachers have preached he said make some strange statements i said let me break it down so why they didn't break down people to begin the first place they make a long long highfalutin statement and people lost people let me break it down i thought that was supposed to be happening right division [Music] and make it plain but the branham said i hope god raised up men to make more sense to this hallelujah raise up mighty men to make more sense to what the message is that when you see it you can say wait a minute this is mines you mean i could have it you mean i don't wait for the preacher to play hands on the sick you mean these signs shall follow them that believe that mean i could cast out devils that mean i could run that demons playing all the time you mean i could overcome you mean i could be filled with the holy ghost it means i could be a vindicator this sun affiliated potter that mean i could get my inheritance you mean i could go to the angel you mean i could claim the book [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in germany at a big whistle anybody sleeping you there i don't think i need that whistle reverend chapter four by the brown the same voice that someone john come up that same voice with someone to church someday the same voice that some some some john to come up the same voice that summons dead lazarus out of the grave that same voice of the archangel christ is the voice of the archangel who is the voice of the archangel some man in america someone in france or germany or somewhere no christ is the voice of the archangel here brother branham we got the doctrine of christ we believe he's the son of god these things are wonderful but leaving that let us go on to perfection oh my is i wish i had the voice of an archangel now to bring this to a place where you could see it amen so the voice of the indian ministry which is the ministry of christ is to bring it to a place where you could see it you have to see something bigger than you [Applause] you have to see something more powerful than you you have to see redeeming love you have to see restoration grace you have to see the power of reconciliation you have to see the power of forgiveness you have to see the quick then power could bring you out of what you in your cancer could be healed your tumor your diabetes your high blood pressure whatever condition he's a healer peter peter caught over my ears and jesus take up the mind of the gun and stick it back and he didn't use glue [Music] that man air was right back in position just a touch only a touch just a touch this morning oh anybody want to touch this there's a touch [Applause] oh hallelujah so therefore the voice of the archangel is to bring it to a place where you could see it [Music] the lord is able to shout and the voice of the archangel oh hallelujah could you take a little more of course you could take a little more this is what you come here for you come here to go home you come here to take the word man give me the book give the lord a shout give the lord a praise offering glory to god hallelujah glory all you want is the word you know hallelujah [Applause] god's purpose expressed through the acts of the believers i ain't getting that yet but we don't get it because god wants to destroy the philistines and raise upon my name samson and samson bahram says was no big muscular man like he become for the gym and he had big big hard muscles samson wasn't like that another wrong feeling fella with some little girlish looking cool seven of them nothing looking like this superman this big s on his chest he he didn't have that all usually happen is the spirit come upon subs that's it no box no tips feel like dancing right now no books no tips no books not heads just a spirit come upon him does the spirit come upon him samson know what to do when they meet the lion just to spirit come upon him samson know what to do when the head is in the city you take up the doorpost you take out the hinge you take up the whole the whole gate with the post and put it in a hill just a spirit when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart i would sing like david's son i will dance like david does i will shout like david show something when the spirit comes upon your life [Music] [Applause] what what what did the spirit get a hold of to make these believers brethren prophets saints of all act the way they act what made abraham believe god for 25 years our old man his wife all have no children and god say abraham sarah she old but sarah look you say you know sarah to treat her writing abraham because it's true sarah so abram can't say i've got 54 you know because she ain't making no big making a cake she grumpy she want to cook no god don't tell him through sarah say abram are banned so to speak god want him in that bank god god want to produce a promise god wants to show he could take nothing and make something god want to show he could take all and make it young god want to show he could take your old condition and make it new yeah yeah he could renew you yeah he could change you he could rearrange you that's god we serve oh give the lord a shout in the house what remember season what what would make a man testify for 25 years go to the doctor doctor to run him outside don't come back don't come back take your money i don't want your money don't come back if i'm saying but god said i have a son he said i don't want to check you no more it's because it's god's faith in the man god sees in the man without the scripture [Music] without a book without a quote but god acting on his life through his believers he's about to restore back his image the devil is clueless because when man fell he began to bring back his image by bringing abraham fate isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection and he put a platform and on top of that he bring prophet after prophet after prophet beginning at moses to build up the body work then john the baptist come as the neck part and jesus come at the head the cap of the old testament and become the cornerstone of the new testament god was always building his objective is to restore his objective is to bring back the image his goal is to bring back that perfect man back on the earth he has done it [Applause] not will do it he has done it you may be seated understand this when adam fell the book that adam had or what he was to release because adam was supposed to release the names of the sons from that book by his spoken word so adam's son was to be born like how he came forth as it was by spoken word but because he felt it went into sex and that's how we get baby born and water and grow through that process but what should jesus come back and say you must be born again of word and of spirit so this second birth is back to adam again where gene thought would activated inside of you hallelujah are you with me so the book that adam had this mysterious book of god went back in the hands of the original owner this book of names [Applause] this book always had names adam was commissioned to multiply hallelujah bring forth on the earth make more sons like you express more sons like you having my purpose having my objective having the goal of god i want more like that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so when adam fell lost the book the book won back and the hands of the original owner the one that sat on the throne that book that man had is now in the hands of one that sat upon the throne that book is to be loosed that book is to be unveiled that book is to be released because there are names that has to be called the thing of it is the names has always been unfolded not knowing it was names all the ages gone past is the book being unfolded because god promised in the last day the prophet will come and make known what took place all along should the prophet come at the very end and say you know what there were names calling that age names calling that age and name will be calling this age so the lord decided to shout revelation chapter 10 with the book open seven thunders throw their voices out because seventeen will catch that bride seventh and lord get every name on that book he knew when them voices go out it will connect to the elect it will connect to the predestination it will connect to the elected hallelujah praise god that will be your land that will be your inheritance that will be your portion john represented the bride give the lord a shout in the house you may be seated praise god praise god notice notice it was the lord himself descend with a shout jesus himself come down in his word because he making no mistake this time no mistake this time about who is his wife who is his bride he actually gonna be called by the word itself that's why the world does something to you you can't help it you can't help it you can't help it you are hearing from your theophany oh glory to god you can't help it [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's trembling because he he's concerned with you getting to know who you are this is the problem you see when moses time comes those witchcraft people and those wizards and so on they know somebody born they know the stars unknowns the hell of a child special child they ask for constantly what what to do what the pharaohs say what to do they kill they say kill kill every baby must catch up with him you must catch up with him everyone for three years and under two years and kill everybody kill kill kill kill kill they are parents just like everybody else somebody was stuffing a child had a child under the crib on all about they may hide in nothing they said the lord

know this child have a light on him do you know you have a light over you if you didn't know no you know oh give the lord a shout in the house let me sting you a little bit how do you think they'll find you were you trying to dock and hide and pray private living could you ever see a big light over you that's why you'll be after you to be after you it's a big light you can hide you play you're

will find you he would seek you and find you out you always was a son you always was a daughter of god you can miss it if you try oh hallelujah hallelujah the devil can have some but he cannot have all right [Music] glory glory hallelujah you don't understand the world don't like you you are fitting you'll be miserable out here you are christian you come from god you're going back to god you are elected you are predestinated we fall you who he called justified who he justified he had already glorified give the lord a shout [Applause] hello this book is a mysterious book it's a book of redemption at the end of the age seven is the biggest song he winds up all the loose ends which them fellas probes are now the loose end is not the message serpent seed baptize the name of jesus christ that's not the message that is loose ends things that's supposed to be corrected before you come to your message [Music] there's something called loose ends information daniel go that way the book is sealed to the time of the end knowledge shall increase god will clarify issues and things that we did not know back there he will clarify that no one can stop and see that doesn't help you for the rapture can be inspired he doesn't give a rapture in power you know cain is a concealed and serpent seed and sepancy what will you do with that you are not sipping there is killing his family well listen to the prophet now when the seventh angel begins to song his mystery he winds up all the loose ends that he's fell approved at are you ready are you ready anybody sleeping raise your hands all right nobody say that caught you here we go the mysteries come down from god amen as the word of god and reveals the entire revelation of god the mysteries themselves come down as the word so when the word is preached the mysteries is being preached hallelujah now god's great secret mystery that he had before the world began in the back path of god's mind there was something he was trying to achieve he had a motive in order to let himself be expressed so first he made the angels to worship him and that make him before becomes god god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak to you this church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind unfolded back to this present are god great mystery is a secret he kept it a secret not even the angels understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under when the seventh seal was opened there was silence even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen god kept that all to himself john was even a forbidden to write it the coming of the lord that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come here we go therefore that's what i want to get to the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ here we go the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers that's where i get my taught from all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type expressing what god's great goal is and now is the last days he has revealed it and he has shown it god and a truthful purpose one god wants to reveal himself to the people so god become from god become to me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him and go back to his great purpose as sons and daughters of god the attribute that was in him now watch the coming of the lord is a mystery we don't know when he is coming how he is coming but we know he is coming so was all the mysteries of god waiting for this last day here we go after it's already been completed then he reveal and show what he has done pause a little bit after it's completed then he reveal what he has done so he's not revealing it as it unfolds when it's completed you reveal it and identify it so watch he never give his mystery in full hear the bomb it's like comparing the seven seals now when god used martin luther for the coming out of that first church or that church age then he used john wesley he gradually brought them out here we go and was revealing in them that church so they were just living out living on a mystery of a church age and they didn't even know in them the mystery of the church was being lived out as a church's messenger and they didn't even know it it took a prophet to come at the end of time and say paul martin luther wesley columbus over all of them because it's already completed then he could reveal every messenger for every age are you with me hallelujah saluter he preached justification and just pounded away but he didn't know what his age was hallelujah wesley the same way right now we are pulling away and we living in a bright age [Applause] mystery being unfolded right now in you let's continue moses was failed the living word of god veil behind human flesh brother sister has been revealed to the ages according to the word of god it will be open in the last days those seven seals will be broke and the full thing will come into view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seven angels message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah amen all the mysteries will be made known in that elijah so brother branham himself was holding the mystery of god he was a son of man revealing d son of man he was holding christ the seventh seal was failed in him amen oh hallelujah so watch all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah how that christ is put out of his church one he'll reveal a son of man again how the church is to be put in order in the last days no creed no denomination just here we go the word living individual i want a bigger shout than that he is saying how the church will come in order we can say we believe this thick we believe that tick we believe that tick no no not ticks it has to come down to the word living in the individual not who your pastor is not wherever the church that is irrelevant it has to be the word living in you save an earthquake come and pluck break up train that in 24 parts and there is no church to go to it still has to be the word living in you [Applause] oh glory to god people think election is something that has been hatched up here lately that's one of the oldest teachings that we have election and calling so irenaeus here we go was one of the angels of the church age as we've seen as we studied we believe of course now they were all mysteries did you hear that they were all mysteries paul was a mystery arenas was a mystery columba was a mystery seven mysteries but they have to be revealed in the last day it started off with paul so we understand that these messengers they were a mystery they were mysteries hid let me read it again of course they were all mysteries they are all here hid right here in these seals could we give the lord a shout on that day this is not me trying to explain this this is what the prophet is saying that these men were mysteries hid in the seals and the prophet came at the end of the age and reveal it like a mystery here look a mystery there look another mystery here look a mystery here you talk about mysteries [Applause] [Music] someday he comes forward to get this book that is redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book who is the believer who are the believers the words in the book and as isaac preached when we read our book you see the voice of one cry in the wilderness when god look at his bookies you see john the baptist [Applause] are you with me now so we see scripture god see individuals in our book we see a virgin shall conceive but in god's book he see mary okay the lord so john the baptist he had to live out the scripture the voice of one crying in the wilderness so he had to go into wilderness and step out as the voice of one and he's fulfilling the scripture a mystery is being unfolded you don't hear what i'm saying [Applause] [Music] hallelujah then it says there's a time but ram says time shall be no more here notices that time is over what happens could that now be so brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders you remember the premium message it's the capstone what did it do here we go he's going to the perfect man the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith we kept adding seven things now that's how he makes the individual then he caps him and see them by the holy spirit then he comes to say if that be so hear what this person has he has got seven ages that he had seven mysteries that have been stronged away and they fought for to bring back another headstone comes the cap of the church does the thunders mean that my bedroom so when these virtues are in an individual what that person have is not just virtues they have seven mysteries seven ages seven lights seven rainbows hallelujah seven voices seven thunders all that wrapped up in our individual the devil is scared and shaken because these thunders overcome in every age god releasing to you the overcoming power that got victory over the devil in every age god gathers it up and put it in a bride and put that pride on the earth we beat him in paul h we whip him in irena's age and columbus luther we put licks on him and loot and wesley be overcome and we go every age there was a bunch of overcomers what about our day what about our age when god is about to release the full power back into the church oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god just a little more we're going to wrap up you may be seated notice before the throne was seven stars the voice of the stars not one voice voice is plural god what is it hear the interpretation god speaking to the church so when you look at the scriptures he voices and lightens and thunders when the prophet look at it now that's god speaking to the church reflecting himself you're the bomb through seven spirits [Music] hallelujah so the seven spirits coming out for god to reflect himself by red orange yellow blue eagle

spirits of god they went from the great fountain or that great diamond that jesus spoke of that great diamond was chipped to reflect these colors that whole big rainbow had become a teopany or made an image like a man yet he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet he was a theophany oh my i'm going to close just tomorrow's musician come on what am i talking about from adoption hey branham tabernacle you had your chance here we go when a man once is anointed with the holy ghost are you ready to be adopted into the family of god so before adoption a man have to be anointed with the holy ghost to be adopted to be positionally placed by the father and set into service out there into his purpose of life what god call him to do his walk must be holy holy unto the lord amen final quote i have here from as i was with moses last evening last tuesday morning about two o'clock something else happened i was at home standing before me in a room was a divine one that spoke words that i did not understand that the time that he appointed is near him i did not hear him too good but he was a divine one he said seven more days you stand as moses stood or will be as moses was something that considered moses that leads me to wonder one day you'll have to stand i told my family i told him i told my loved ones that i saw this divine one yet he spoke as a man i close with these words it is becoming clear and clearer to me all the mysteries all the great revelations and knowledge and understanding is to bring us into a pathway of life that we can partake of the life of god and the nature of god to express god and then go back to eden but more than that adoption is to bring you into the presence of a divine one a nazi zafar got judged and church for lying to peter peter was a man that he could see listen sapphira knew better she knew the kind of man she was living with he died she didn't have her to die she didn't have to stand up with her husband she has stunned with the word she lied also and she died and that was a man that had god veil and strong what about coming into divine one where brother branham said he never got accustomed to the presence of the angel where john said he fell as one dead and john lived with jesus when jesus was only earned but when john got in the book of revelation and christ come in that glorified condition he fell as one dead amen all the prophets the experience like isaiah fellas one dead i signed the president of god who is me i'm undone when the vision broke about brother branham with with the return since this is the time he said he was numb for days he couldn't feel his hands numb for days and that was off the vision that wasn't even the angel yeah hear what he said adoption god will visit you with an angel is your life ready for a visitation play something softly is your life ready for god to visit you with supernatural divine presence and this is where i could see a man anointed his work must be holy holy oh this takes us beyond church now there's not trying to please some sister or some brother or some elder or some deacon or some person it's not that this is you conscious that someday you have an appointment with the supernatural and if you see the plainness of god then it's you to make yourself ready you to prepare your spirit and your soul and your mind and your heart atmosphere look at abraham hello michael gabriel drop down three men walking abram said my lord god keep the ibrahim about the judge set up and abraham because of what was in him began to plea to god god it's just 50 he said no 14 no 25 no he couldn't find 10. abraham pleases with god he didn't say i am right all him is wrong take me lord burn everybody else accept me no it was christ living out in these brothers christ and joseph christ and jacob christ and noah christ and joshua christ and moses god was living out mysteries all along the people not even knowing it a seed in them david christ and david yes he fell he fell in sin was christ and david christ and solomon all of them sons of god hallelujah noah end up drunk this one end up not crossing over to the land this happened this one that effed up nothing from their sonship their godship the inheritance this tumble they fell they rose up but it's all reflecting jesus christ hallelujah [Music] i am conscious to go to the next level is to prepare for the citizens of angels not little doves not piccados but angels angelic beings dropping down upon the people oh another book of acts angels came to open the prison bars not a book of acts angel visiting the people setting them free bringing messengers angels angelic beings supernatural beings coming among god's people are we ready for that are you expecting that paul said the age of the lord of who servants are

thunder the trumpet sounds within my soul hallelujah i don't have love we don't have love since we don't have love to stay but let's worship the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] this morning [Music] oh
