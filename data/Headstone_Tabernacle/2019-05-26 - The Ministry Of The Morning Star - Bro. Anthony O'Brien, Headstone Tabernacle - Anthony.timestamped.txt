[1:13:25] be she he see the church body but is he
[1:13:28] not overcoming the individual he's
[1:13:31] speaking to he not personal pronoun you
[1:13:35] you that overcome you that put down your
[1:13:39] loss
[1:13:40] you that put down your line you that put
[1:13:42] down your idolatry you that put away

[1:14:38] ministry that is promised in this last
[1:14:41] thing holiday there's a condition to be
[1:14:43] met there's a requirement that must be

[1:14:48] ministry that perfect ministry to heal
[1:14:51] the sick raise a Ted
[1:14:54] that casts out Devils the triumphant
[1:14:56] spirit dwelling Christ is promised to
[1:14:59] live in this endtime bride if you can

[1:15:10] world can you take the trials can you
[1:15:14] take the tests that he and his wisdom
[1:15:17] sends your way knowing what is in you
[1:15:21] that he had not made a temptation for
[1:15:24] you that he has not also made a way of
[1:15:27] escape for hallelujah is not he knows he
[1:15:31] does not give you more than you can bear

[1:32:36] was the first Bible you know that God
[1:32:39] created the heavens on the air to create
[1:32:40] the Stars and everything in the
[1:32:42] beginning laid a full moon up to heaven
[1:32:44] there's no lay the foundation thereof
[1:32:47] well everything was rotating everything
[1:32:50] was a march into a certain to march into
[1:32:54] God's order March into God's program
[1:32:57] Holly are just as the stars in heaven
[1:33:00] hallelujah and God said Let there be
[1:33:02] lights in heaven and to divide the day
[1:33:04] from the night and let them be for signs
[1:33:06] and for seasons and for days and for
[1:33:10] years and let there be for lights in the
[1:33:13] firmament of heaven to give light upon
[1:33:15] the earth and the Bible said and it was
[1:33:17] so it's not right so the lights in the
[1:33:20] heaven and all these things were created
[1:33:23] to announce the seasons and the times
[1:33:27] and it dispensations upon yet another
[1:33:30] reason God is getting ready to do
[1:33:32] something he would so I shot a sign of
[1:33:35] what will take place up in the heavens
[1:33:37] isn't that right the light and the
[1:33:40] heavens are knows the season times now
[1:33:42] right any time or season that was coming

[2:09:32] abandon have the same ministry as others
[2:09:34] different ones coming on you all
[2:09:37] reflected the light of their day it's
[2:09:39] now right people know us from one
[2:09:41] another now right and Jesus said is that
[2:09:43] is that Morning Sun he said Jesus is
[2:09:46] that morning star here it is he's
[2:09:49] identified we struck it it man glory
[2:09:50] finally I got here feels good
[2:09:53] Jesus is that morning stars the
[2:09:56] brightest of all of them
[2:09:58] he's a practice of all and we reflect
[2:10:02] that oncoming Sun as a day grows darker
[2:10:05] and as the shadows fall those morning
[2:10:07] stars get brighter and brighter as I
[2:10:10] reflect the oncoming Sun as I reflect me
[2:10:13] I saw hand of God isn't that right he's
[2:10:16] raised from the dead and he's alive
[2:10:17] forevermore reflecting a man they were
[2:10:20] different from one another will DIF will
[2:10:22] different from one another show but he's
[2:10:24] a morning star he's a brightest of all
[2:10:25] of them but we find him in Revelation
[2:10:28] one with seven stars in his hand prophet
[2:10:32] said he's and he interprets that and
[2:10:33] said these seven stars are the seven
[2:10:36] angels to the seven churches or the
[2:10:39] seven church ages that's coming like
[2:10:42] what but over truck a few weeks ago as I
[2:10:43] ran then he said how could have been
[2:10:45] that it got the Morningstar prophet said
[2:10:47] here he said I said that the stars that
[2:10:50] were in his hand were only the
[2:10:52] reflection stars from the morning star
[2:10:55] himself it's not those each and their
[2:10:59] age and their age and their dispensation
[2:11:01] and time was only reflecting the
[2:11:03] oncoming Sun they were reflecting the
[2:11:05] glory of the Lord but he is the Lord and
[2:11:08] we are reflecting his glory even as by
[2:11:11] the Spirit of the Lord is not right we
[2:11:14] are changed into that same image but
[2:11:16] glory to glory to glory from peak to put
[2:11:19] you to knowledge a temperance we reflect
[2:11:21] his glory is now Luther reflect his
[2:11:24] glory whether in fact

[2:11:33] down in the end and begin to show to the
[2:11:35] Prophet what it was laying up to all
[2:11:37] along I don't forget to put the whole
[2:11:38] puzzle together and we see the whole
[2:11:41] picture of God and what we see should
[2:11:45] make a church that should make her in

[2:35:44] that since God is immutable in his
[2:35:45] nature he is just as immutable in his
[2:35:48] wings that Sita knows shortly that the
[2:35:52] original Church at Pentecost with the
[2:35:54] power of God st. mark 16 and action is
[2:35:57] the true church that's the true church

[2:37:29] atmosphere he just want you to get into
[2:37:31] spirits he doesn't wanted to get into
[2:37:33] the revelation we're gonna get caught up
[2:37:35] in a vision of God we're gonna
[2:37:36] understand who he is what he is his
[2:37:39] nature his being
