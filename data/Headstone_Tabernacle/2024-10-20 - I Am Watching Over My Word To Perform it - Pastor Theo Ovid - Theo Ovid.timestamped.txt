[46:03] the purpose of him going there and
[46:06] sometimes in our lives because we are
[46:08] not in helicopter to see the big vision
[46:11] and we under the ground on the street
[46:13] and you're struggling and you're
[46:15] battling but sometime there's a big
[46:17] higher picture that God have in his mind
[46:21] for Joseph to come into position it
[46:23] means that his brothers have to sell him
[46:25] out for the brothers to have to sell
[46:27] them out it means you have to be gifted
[46:29] enough for they to get jealous and that
[46:32] jealousy provoked them to the place
[46:34] where they could get rid of him in
[46:36] getting rid of him he still performed in
[46:39] a land that was not his own in a
[46:42] language that not his own hallelujah
[46:43] it's a young boy but he learned your
[46:46] language and he pressed on he performed
[46:49] in party first how did he get promoted
[46:51] until God could get him into prison the
[46:54] target was the prison because the bottle
[46:57] connected to Pharaoh was going to be
[46:58] dear forget the baker for now but the
[47:01] butler is who was going to connect him
[47:04] to to Pharaoh now the thing of it is
[47:06] when Joseph tell that Butler remember me
[47:09] he forgot that's human but the reality
[47:13] was Joseph wasn't ready yet and
[47:15] sometimes we want to escape route we
[47:17] want to get out of what we in but are
[47:20] you ready you blame others but are you
[47:23] ready you say this and that and make
[47:25] excuses but you have to become ready
[47:28] that's the most important thing amen and
[47:31] if you hang around me long long enough
[47:33] you'll know I don't like excuses I like
[47:35] people to accept responsibility for
[47:36] their attitude and their actions and
[47:38] their behavior I like to choose my
[47:41] behavior and action choose to love
[47:43] choose to forgive choose to drop things
[47:45] choose to Live and Let Live there's a
[47:47] choice choose not to be hurt and and and
[47:50] be angry and cursed and and you know is
[47:53] a choice we make and God reward you for
[47:55] the choices that you make
[47:57] remember reputation is what people think
[47:59] you are but character is what you
[48:02] are amen amen amen amen praise God you
[48:06] love him so he saying a few thing before
[48:09] we get into the word this morning so you
[48:12] know God have his requirements and we
[48:14] have to meet them it's not the gift I
[48:17] was thinking something this was striking
[48:19] me so strong God want better
[48:22] sermons think about that that song
[48:25] Stranger God don't want better sermons
[48:28] God want better
[48:30] men and better men will produce better
[48:34] sermons and that's why he couldn't
[48:36] handle Saul he said I found me a better
[48:38] man Hallelujah and that was David
[48:40] Hallelujah so God don't need to talk so
[48:42] much from you and know he wants
[48:43] you a better
[48:48] you could you see yourself becoming a
[48:51] better you or do you want to continue as
[48:54] you
[48:55] are why sometimes they're so sad there
[48:58] some people all they know is what they
[48:59] know for the last 20 years they add
[49:01] nothing to it they didn't read an extra
[49:04] book nothing listen to nothing all they
[49:07] know is what their brains have in last
[49:08] 30 40 years they add nothing to
[49:11] themselves that's a shame because
[49:14] whether you don't know or where you know
[49:15] you don't know the world is spinning
[49:17] around and there are things you're
[49:19] supposed to know and the Bible said my
[49:20] people perish because of lack of
[49:22] knowledge you need knowledge because
[49:25] knowledge gives you the access to
[49:26] discernment
[49:27] and you need discernment in order to
[49:29] escape the Ws of the enemy and I and but
[49:32] Andrew was Shar with us that he read
[49:35] Proverbs every day so on the first days
[49:37] 31 chapters on the first day if it's day
[49:40] three or four he read the third book of
[49:41] prbs and so I tell him that book was my
[49:43] mother grandmother father everything
[49:45] else as a young Christian that was The
[49:47] Guiding Light of my life that book
[49:50] called Proverbs it kept me from woman
[49:52] kep me from so much different things
[49:53] snares in life that book called Proverbs
[49:56] it's a book of wisdom is a book that
[49:57] every young man woman should study the
[50:00] Book of
[50:00] Proverbs and it's not hard to do that
[50:03] because you could just get into it every
[50:04] day day one read Proverbs one you know
[50:07] and get into side of it because what the
[50:09] devil was the devil don't want you to
[50:10] get into the word get you in Facebook
[50:12] getting all kind of foolishness and all
[50:14] kind of all kind of gimmick people be
[50:16] saiding on whatnot but to get into the
[50:17] word that's a challenge but in that word
[50:19] of life and that word have your calling
[50:23] if that word have your election if that
[50:25] word have your anointing in that word of
[50:27] your deliverance that word is for all
[50:30] nations all countries everyone it's
[50:32] subject to the word of God not your
[50:34] emotions so much you got people go by
[50:37] their feelings and their emotions and
[50:38] their hurts and their fears and God have
[50:40] nothing to do with that he's not in the
[50:41] realm of your feelings emotions in the
[50:43] realm of your word of the of his word if
[50:45] we get to catch the mind of God we see
[50:47] everything
[50:48] different praise God so this coming week

[53:01] scripture I like to read this morning
[53:03] Jeremiah 1: 11 to 12 and Isaiah 55 1
[53:07] verse
[53:08] vers1 God bless thanks to see all of you
[53:10] all out here this
[53:15] morning Jeremiah 1 reading verse
[53:19] 11 moreover the word of the Lord came
[53:21] unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou
[53:25] and I said I see a rod of an almond
[53:29] tree then said the Lord unto me thou are
[53:32] seen well thou has well seen for I will
[53:36] hasten my word to perform it Isaiah
[53:45] 5511 B says so shall my word be that
[53:47] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[53:50] return to me void but it shall
[53:53] accomplish that which I please and it
[53:55] shall press prosper in the thing where
[53:58] to I sent it let's bow our
[54:01] heads Heavenly Father we stand in all of
[54:04] your presence and we thank you for your
[54:06] mercy and your grace and I pray that
[54:10] reverence and respect will come for you
[54:12] more and more in this place in your
[54:14] house and among your people may you come
[54:17] and breathe upon your word and bring
[54:19] life to your people by Your Word through
[54:21] your word in Jesus name I ask it amen
[54:23] and amen you may be seated
[54:28] the scripture you read in Jeremiah I
[54:29] want to read it in the Amplified just to
[54:32] give a little a fresh uh meaning on it
[54:37] in the Amplified it reads moreover the
[54:38] word of the Lord came to me saying
[54:39] Jeremiah what do you see and I said I
[54:43] see a
[54:44] branch or Chute of an almond
[54:47] tree the emblem of alertness and
[54:51] activity blossoming in late
[54:54] winter then said said the Lord to me you
[54:57] have seen well for I am
[55:00] alert and
[55:03] active watching over my word to perform
[55:09] it and I want to get this part here he
[55:12] is
[55:13] alert and
[55:16] active watching over my word to perform
[55:20] it and the title of the message this
[55:22] morning is I am watching over my word to
[55:26] per perform
[55:28] it now the English word
[55:30] perform is derived from a old French
[55:34] perform
[55:36] per which means thoroughly and for is to
[55:40] complete does its original meaning is to
[55:43] bring to
[55:45] completion or to finish
[55:48] entirely so when he says he is watching
[55:51] over his word to perform it it means he
[55:55] want to bring it to full
[55:57] completion or to finish
[56:00] it sometimes they use the word perform
[56:03] as they use the word
[56:05] fulfill in some instances the use of the
[56:09] word
[56:10] perform it carries okay I'll skip that
[56:14] in Modern English however perform has
[56:16] lost its narrower focus on completing an
[56:20] act and can simply indicate doing an act
[56:25] does the English versions use perform as
[56:29] to do or to make but this is not just
[56:32] action this is God going and complete
[56:36] what he prophesied that would happen and
[56:38] I have an inspiration my word shall not
[56:41] return unto me void I news and as I get
[56:45] the news I'm going to share with you
[56:47] North Korea soldiers have now entered
[56:49] into the war with
[56:50] Ukraine and they are fighting along with
[56:53] the Russians they'll be fighting along
[56:55] with the Russians to go against Ukraine
[56:59] so North Korea has joined this
[57:03] thing in the Middle East
[57:06] now Russia has warned Israel about
[57:11] attacking Iran's nuclear facilities and
[57:14] so on like
[57:15] that Russia right now presently has
[57:19] warships in the ports of Iran at
[57:23] present right now Israel is been a
[57:26] attacked by four countries at the same
[57:27] time hisbah and and it just killed the
[57:30] head of Hamas the guy who was the
[57:33] orchestration orchestrator of what
[57:35] happened last year
[57:37] October and they got him by accident so
[57:41] the new
[57:42] see but we know that nothing is by
[57:47] accident but because that man got killed
[57:51] there's heavy repercussions that is
[57:53] going on right now so what I want to say
[57:56] is this things are heating up it's like
[57:58] a low burner and now is increasing right
[58:01] now amen so I want you to shake off your
[58:04] foolishness and your nonsense and get
[58:07] real that this is a real thing that we
[58:10] are confronted with so Russia warns
[58:13] Israel about bombing Iran nuclear
[58:15] facility Russia warships are now at the
[58:17] Port of Iran and they will be conducting
[58:19] exercising exercises with Iran in the
[58:22] next few
[58:24] days I read this before before I'll read
[58:27] it again B had seven Visions 1933 which
[58:30] is say must come to pass before Jesus
[58:32] Come Again the sixth Vision there arose
[58:34] America most beautiful but cruel woman
[58:38] she held the people in her complete
[58:39] power I believe this was the rise of the
[58:42] Roman Catholic Church though I knew it
[58:44] could possibly a vision of some woman
[58:47] rising in great power in America due to
[58:51] the popular vote by women
[58:56] am then in the sixth Vision There Rose
[58:58] up in America most beautiful but cruel
[59:01] woman the last and seven Vision was when
[59:06] I heard a most terrible explosion as I
[59:09] turned to look I saw nothing but Deb
[59:11] craters and smoke all over the land of
[59:14] America so this was Vision that he saw
[59:17] and you know how a vision comes the
[59:19] prophet go UPS into the knowledge of God
[59:22] that stretched out into prophecy into
[59:24] the stretched out into the future and he
[59:26] pulls it down and then prophesy so he's
[59:29] not hoping this happen it's a vision you
[59:32] see it and then you come back and see it
[59:34] so you're not seeing what you're not
[59:36] seeing what seest thou Jeremiah what
[59:40] seest thou elij they see it and they
[59:43] come and prophesy it and God is active
[59:46] over his word of Prophecy to ensure it
[59:49] come to pass what about your life what
[59:53] about the word over your life you don't
[59:55] feel sometime you don't what but but he
[59:57] is
[59:58] active whether you feel or you don't
[1:00:00] feel he is active over his own word that
[1:00:03] word is what is hanging over your life
[1:00:06] when the prophet stood and said this
[1:00:08] message will fall in the hands of the
[1:00:10] predestinated he was talking about you
[1:00:13] however it had to be done this message
[1:00:16] of the hour had to come to you he had to
[1:00:18] put you in the family put you in the
[1:00:20] right location put you to the of the
[1:00:22] right person he had to put you wherever
[1:00:23] you had to put you to make sure you get
[1:00:25] this word
[1:00:26] this is not Baptist Methodist
[1:00:28] Pentecostal this is an end time message
[1:00:31] for end time people that are about to
[1:00:33] get out of here give the Lord some
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:38] Praises
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:43] Hallelujah this is not a message of
[1:00:44] Kentucky Fried Chicken this a message of
[1:00:47] judgment he said behold I send you
[1:00:49] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:00:52] terrible day of the Lord because that
[1:00:54] day is coming hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:57] praise God praise God I read this also
[1:01:01] picking up the other day an old book up
[1:01:03] here reading some of the things that the
[1:01:05] Lord had told and for told already come
[1:01:08] to pass about this juvenile stuff and
[1:01:10] how the war would come out and all those
[1:01:12] things has hit just two things left in
[1:01:17] one of those great prophecies that is
[1:01:20] for cars to be on the road with remote
[1:01:23] control looking like a egg only you
[1:01:26] don't drive it it controls itself and
[1:01:30] then there will be a great woman rise up
[1:01:32] because America is a woman's Nation a
[1:01:34] great woman will rise up and be
[1:01:35] president or something like that in the
[1:01:37] nation and then there will be total
[1:01:42] Annihilation the entire nation will be
[1:01:45] wiped out so the time I read this a
[1:01:47] couple of months ago I pre I think end
[1:01:49] the time end has come and I've told you
[1:01:51] that they were working on the car
[1:01:52] without steering wheel and without pedal
[1:01:55] I want you to say that this uh think
[1:01:57] last week or week before they launch
[1:01:59] that car so Whata just wanted to put on
[1:02:02] the clip let them see what we talking
[1:02:04] about a bit overnight in Los Angeles
[1:02:06] Elon Musk revealing his next destination
[1:02:09] the fully driverless cyber cap as you
[1:02:11] can see I just arrived in the rubber
[1:02:14] taxi the Cyber cab the Tesla CEO showing
[1:02:17] off what he says is the company's first
[1:02:19] fully autonomous Robo taxi with no
[1:02:21] steering wheel no pedals a whole lot of
[1:02:23] AI and a price tag of around3 ,000 you
[1:02:27] could fall asleep and wake up at your
[1:02:28] destination musk also hyping a robo van
[1:02:31] that can carry up to 20 passengers now
[1:02:34] can you imagine going down the streets
[1:02:35] and you see this coming towards you but
[1:02:38] critics are quick to question the
[1:02:39] timeline of that future musk says mass
[1:02:42] production of the Cyber cab is at least
[1:02:44] 2 years away I tend to be a little
[1:02:46] optimistic with time frames Tesla's
[1:02:47] stock dropping 8% today investor
[1:02:50] skeptical after musk's track record of
[1:02:52] over promising on deadlines it's still 4
[1:02:55] years behind find competition there's a
[1:02:58] lot of ground for Tesla to make up
[1:02:59] that's for sure meanwhile competitors
[1:03:01] like Google's wh have been on the roads
[1:03:03] for years without drivers it's just me
[1:03:07] and the steering wheel here weo having
[1:03:09] logged more than 22 million driverless
[1:03:11] miles across four cities while Teslas
[1:03:14] with full self-driving capabilities
[1:03:16] still need a human in the driver's seat
[1:03:18] and even that Tech is under scrutiny
[1:03:20] earlier this year Federal Regulators
[1:03:22] said a critical safety Gap in Tesla's
[1:03:24] self-driving systems contributed to at
[1:03:26] least 467 collisions including 14 deaths
[1:03:31] we'll see autonomous cars become 10
[1:03:34] times safer than a human but for now
[1:03:37] that promise of a cyber cab and full
[1:03:39] self-driving safety remains as elusive
[1:03:42] as an
[1:03:43] Android so that's it so you you call the
[1:03:49] car door is open you sit in it you
[1:03:51] punching your destination and you enjoy
[1:03:53] the ride there's no pedal to press
[1:03:55] there's no breaks to press there's no
[1:03:56] gas to press there's nothing to press
[1:03:58] there's no stearing to turn the car take
[1:04:00] you where you to go you could fall
[1:04:02] asleep and I will take
[1:04:04] you and that's is what the prophet saw
[1:04:07] in
[1:04:08] 1933 where at those time the scar was
[1:04:10] sare and
[1:04:12] black the color choices was black and
[1:04:14] black it was for in those times you
[1:04:17] could choose any kind of black but it
[1:04:18] was black and it was very Square now you
[1:04:21] see what he's talking about the egg
[1:04:22] shape curve like that this is what a
[1:04:25] vision is
[1:04:26] like going up in the spirit go forward
[1:04:29] into the Future come back and see what
[1:04:32] going to happen that's a vision so this
[1:04:35] makes the Bible such a powerful book
[1:04:37] more than just behave right and act
[1:04:39] right and live right the reality is a
[1:04:41] prophetic book that tell you what is and
[1:04:44] what is to come and how you are going to
[1:04:46] be prepare for what is Yet to Come he
[1:04:49] said watch and there will become a total
[1:04:52] anation the entire nation will be wiped
[1:04:54] out
[1:04:56] so much for who want to go and head for
[1:05:00] America I not tell you don't go to
[1:05:02] America you say p through there but all
[1:05:05] I'm telling you is that that nation is
[1:05:08] heading for total
[1:05:10] Destruction because you see the thing
[1:05:12] about it God is longsuffering and people
[1:05:16] misinterpret the longsuffering of God
[1:05:19] and and I said it sometime ago with
[1:05:21] Samson and this one was so shaking for
[1:05:22] me and scary for me because when Samson
[1:05:26] when the lla was trying to get
[1:05:27] information from Samson about his
[1:05:29] strength he began to lie and play games
[1:05:32] and whatnot but his strength was still
[1:05:33] there his power was still there when he
[1:05:37] give all to the ler and say about his
[1:05:40] here and she cut in the Bible said he
[1:05:42] Shake himself like before and the Bible
[1:05:45] said he knew not God was not with him so

[1:20:17] that it means that whatever he said is
[1:20:20] final it means that whatever he said to
[1:20:23] the first age to the second age to all
[1:20:25] the ages about his own true church about
[1:20:27] the false Vine is exactly right it won't

[1:20:34] Revelation he has to be for he is the
[1:20:37] amen so let it be now now we can see
[1:20:41] again why the devil hates the Book of
[1:20:43] Genesis and Revelation he hates the
[1:20:45] truth he knows the truth will prevail he

[1:21:41] Tik Tok and and get likes
[1:21:48] andall these things sayth the faithful
[1:21:50] and true witness now I want to show you
[1:21:54] what I find in the thought of faithful
[1:21:57] you know we often talk about a great
[1:21:58] unchanging God whose word does not
[1:22:00] change but when we speak of him after
[1:22:03] that manner we often get a view of him
[1:22:06] that makes him seem very
[1:22:08] impersonal it is as though God made the
[1:22:11] whole universe and all the laws that
[1:22:12] pertain to it and then stood back and
[1:22:15] became impersonal God it as though God
[1:22:18] made a way of salvation for lost mankind
[1:22:20] the way being the cross and then when
[1:22:22] the death of Christ had atoned for our
[1:22:24] sins and his resurrection give us the
[1:22:26] open door to him God just folded his
[1:22:28] arms stood back it is as if we majored
[1:22:31] in Believing on a great Creator who
[1:22:34] having created lost personal interest in
[1:22:36] his
[1:22:37] creation now I see that is how too many
[1:22:41] people are apt to think but that is
[1:22:44] wrong thinking for God is governing in
[1:22:48] the Affairs of men right now
[1:22:52] [Applause]

[1:23:05] pregnant and the government passed a
[1:23:08] law that you had to go and pay taxes in

[1:23:19] gang and you take up a Facebook page to
[1:23:22] fight the government and fight taxes and
[1:23:23] fight that
[1:23:25] you see what Spirit you
[1:23:27] have
[1:23:35] Mary Mary in her pregnant self has to
[1:23:39] find her way back to the original place
[1:23:43] you know why because Jesus was going to
[1:23:45] born out of
[1:23:47] place if it remain as is that whole
[1:23:50] taxation story was to get Mary in
[1:23:52] position to get Jes into him oh give the
[1:23:56] Lord some praises and sometime God to
[1:23:59] flip so much things to get you in

[1:36:52] song HJ
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:59] let's
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:04] continue there was nothing could happen
[1:37:07] unless you would have Master it that is
[1:37:10] what you were created for Hallelujah
[1:37:13] then Sim came along to fall and blinded
[1:37:15] the eyes of it and now Jesus came along
[1:37:18] and redeem it back now the father gives
[1:37:21] you the Holy Spirit to lead you and and
[1:37:23] guide you giving you all the Divine
[1:37:25] promises and I believe that this is
[1:37:27] God's word and if this is God's word as
[1:37:30] I believe it to be I believe that he's
[1:37:32] obligated to answer for me every promise
[1:37:36] that's in the book if I meet his
[1:37:39] conditions and he seals me into his
[1:37:42] kingdom by the Holy Spirit which I
[1:37:44] believe is not fanaticism though we have
[1:37:47] a lot of fastic with it yet it is not
[1:37:49] fism it is the truth and then God is
[1:37:52] obligated his word and to take care of
[1:37:54] his word he listen he watches over it to
[1:37:58] perform
[1:38:01] it so I want you to think about this God
[1:38:05] literally watching over his word that's
[1:38:07] why the Bible is
[1:38:09] perfect if the god of the universe can't
[1:38:11] write the book what we going
[1:38:14] trust man always apologizing in the
[1:38:16] newspaper and what not for lies to
[1:38:17] telling but God is not a man that going
[1:38:19] to lie he call out Babylon he call out
[1:38:23] all them he call them
[1:38:29] out let's go the Lord is our refuge and
[1:38:33] strength a very present help in a time
[1:38:35] of trouble and in the Redemptive names
[1:38:40] shama is the Lord is
[1:38:42] present Jehovah Gyra is provider Jehovah
[1:38:45] the provider is present but Jehovah
[1:38:48] shama is present so whenever Jehovah is
[1:38:52] present shama the name shama is in
[1:38:55] effect I am present in our midst I am
[1:38:59] present to heal I'm present to guide I'm
[1:39:01] present to instruct Moses parents
[1:39:04] instructed him because they had
[1:39:05] Revelation that that child was a special
[1:39:07] child that's why they put him in AR and
[1:39:10] sail him to pharaoh and what not they
[1:39:11] wasn't fearful because they know no
[1:39:14] alligator no tiger no lion nothing could
[1:39:15] touch that life that's ordained life
[1:39:18] onto our purpose but they couldn't bring
[1:39:21] Moses into illumination of his calling
[1:39:25] they could share by words from an
[1:39:27] intellectual standpoint you are called
[1:39:29] to this and Moses believeth his parents
[1:39:31] telling them what God told them but
[1:39:33] Moses himself never had a god encounter
[1:39:36] until he met the pillar of fire in the
[1:39:38] burning bush after flee in Egypt and
[1:39:41] unchill for 40
[1:39:43] years but when that time up and he
[1:39:46] settled down now know we get mortgage
[1:39:48] now we get you house and now we got you
[1:39:50] fancy
[1:39:50] car now we settling down he planning now
[1:39:54] to buy some more acres and do this and
[1:39:55] do that and expand and whatnot that when
[1:39:57] God choose to say
[1:39:59] hey I want to talk with
[1:40:02] you fire attracted him he gone up there
[1:40:05] when God finished him so he come down he
[1:40:07] tell the wife going on Egypt she just
[1:40:11] going to the market
[1:40:12] tomorrow not down Market
[1:40:16] Egypt some say where going on the FL to
[1:40:18] take
[1:40:20] over Hallelujah they say Moses lost
[1:40:25] it but I when a man hear from
[1:40:28] God the vision is always bigger than
[1:40:31] you the plan is always bigger than you
[1:40:35] if you could do it why need God to tell
[1:40:36] you to do it but when the vision is
[1:40:38] Broad when the vision is great you could
[1:40:41] see how to be God to fulfill that
[1:40:44] purpose and when that purpose when the
[1:40:46] God bring the anointing of the purpose
[1:40:48] for your life nothing could break it
[1:40:51] nothing could stop it
[1:40:53] Hallelujah that's why saming to pray
[1:40:55] once more Lord he once had it so he can
[1:40:58] ask for a double portion he once had it
[1:41:01] so he could acttiv it again he once was
[1:41:03] in contact with it he lost it for how
[1:41:05] much years but he was in a position he
[1:41:08] found himself in a position where he
[1:41:10] could call once more Lord because the
[1:41:12] Lux was restored and the prophet labored
[1:41:15] to bring back these seven tunders these

[1:53:21] because you are the same
[1:53:23] last same dress say last month so what
[1:53:25] you saved money for you last
[1:53:34] month we have to become detached from
[1:53:37] the external
[1:53:38] voices external people remember a man
[1:53:42] probably talk about the man who was
[1:53:43] playing a piece and people clapping and
[1:53:46] applauding and he's waiting watching
[1:53:49] somebody up on the balcony there that's
[1:53:52] the man who train him he's wanting to
[1:53:54] see his reaction he's not concerned
[1:53:56] about all clapping maybe they don't even
[1:53:58] know see from D
[1:53:59] note in their ears is sounding good but
[1:54:03] when that man raised his hand to say was
[1:54:05] fine then he felt good because that is
[1:54:08] the man that train
[1:54:11] him somebody could play a PC set
[1:54:13] mistakes in it you hear no mistakes
[1:54:15] because you love it you love songing but
[1:54:18] somebody who really know music oh you
[1:54:20] hear that bad note yes
[1:54:23] yes but you a here no bad because you're
[1:54:26] not
[1:54:27] trained and therefore who we are to be
[1:54:29] playing for is not people
[1:54:32] around it is God and that's why all
[1:54:35] these women all these men who break
[1:54:37] through and press through note that they
[1:54:40] did it alone the one where the blood
[1:54:42] issue she pressed through alone and when
[1:54:44] she touched and she got healed Jus said
[1:54:46] who touch my
[1:54:49] clothesall hallu so this gangster and

[1:54:54] always was somebody let we go and go and
[1:54:56] go and go you had to cut that out you
[1:54:57] know that means you have some maturing
[1:55:00] to do you have to make a choice yourself
[1:55:03] to serve God is the greatest thing you
[1:55:05] could do I am not talking about going to
[1:55:08] church there are too many people going
[1:55:10] to church and they're not serving God
[1:55:12] I'm not talking about going to church
[1:55:13] now I'm talking about serving God when
[1:55:16] nobody else is around you serving God
[1:55:18] when nobody is around you're loving God
[1:55:21] oh glory to God you know why Satan like

[1:56:55] your business to act upon it but God
[1:56:58] will take care of
[1:57:02] it glory to God
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:19] hallelujah be seated
[1:57:22] this is to come what I'm about to
[1:57:25] read God calling his children aside by
[1:57:32] manifestation they don't have to say one
[1:57:34] word about it you would see something
[1:57:41] happen positionally placing his son
[1:57:44] getting him into order he just has as
[1:57:48] much Authority his word is just as good
[1:57:50] as an AR angel or
[1:57:53] better the son was adopted put on a high
[1:57:56] place out there change his robe change
[1:57:58] his colors the father had a ceremony he
[1:58:00] said this is my son from hence forth he
[1:58:03] is Governor he's the ruler he's over all
[1:58:05] my inheritage all that I got belongs to
[1:58:07] him then we could go back to the same
[1:58:10] Elohim where he was self-existent then
[1:58:13] they come back to Jehovah who made
[1:58:15] something he gave man dominion over the
[1:58:17] Earth and what are we waiting for the
[1:58:20] manifestation the Earth is groaning just
[1:58:24] take any Divine promise listen to this
[1:58:26] you can take make take this statement
[1:58:27] it's on recording everything else but I
[1:58:29] say this and challenge anybody the right
[1:58:33] mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:58:36] promise of this word will bring it to
[1:58:39] pass regardless of what it is if God
[1:58:42] said so you take the right mental
[1:58:43] attitude towards the word it will bring
[1:58:46] it to pass so why should I preach
[1:58:48] anything less than the promises to you
[1:58:50] why should I go down the road a long Mor
[1:58:53] or
[1:58:54] long car or something so and you're
[1:58:56] stretching it stretching it stretching
[1:58:58] it stretching it without a promise you
[1:59:00] need the promises is by these promises
[1:59:03] we become partakers of his divine nature
[1:59:05] you need to know what God promised
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:09] you those scribe and Pharisees they have
[1:59:12] the books they have the tape they head
[1:59:13] straight down inside of it and they miss
[1:59:14] Jesus clean a woman at the well say we
[1:59:17] know when the Messiah cometh he shall do
[1:59:19] these things
[1:59:22] Give the Lord a shout that woman was
[1:59:24] more activated than God by the word to
[1:59:27] expect Jesus that she could say when the
[1:59:30] Messiah come he will do these things and
[1:59:32] Jesus said I that speak unto you am
[1:59:35] he direct identification of who he was
[1:59:38] because she was spiritually sensitive
[1:59:40] and spiritually aware that this man was
[1:59:42] different this man was bringing
[1:59:44] something completely different than the
[1:59:45] Scribe and the Pharisees and and so
[1:59:47] [Applause]
[1:59:48] on and God freed her Oh Glory something
[1:59:52] for go to free you know free you from
[1:59:54] your past we all have a past don't look
[1:59:56] at me don't look at me like that you all

[2:00:00] bigger amen than that every one of us
[2:00:03] every one of you here have a pass and he
[2:00:05] can free you from your past let your

[2:00:10] future that was just your past oh give
[2:00:13] the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God
[2:00:25] [Applause]
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:36] we know in the beginning was the word
[2:00:38] and the Word was with God and the W was
[2:00:40] God and the Word was made flesh and
[2:00:42] dwell Among Us therefore here we go God
[2:00:44] and His word is a self same
[2:00:47] thing church are you ready here this it
[2:00:50] is God in print
[2:00:57] form that's why the devil that's try you
[2:01:01] to avoid the
[2:01:02] Bible you reading this book that book
[2:01:04] you're reading this listening to this he
[2:01:06] in this podcast hear in this and that
[2:01:07] that about the Bible
[2:01:09] no because those modern day preachers
[2:01:13] don't believe the Bible to be God you
[2:01:14] know they believe that that that
[2:01:17] translations until they become a
[2:01:19] translator themselves
[2:01:23] and they translating whatever they want
[2:01:24] to
[2:01:28] translate they feel God is one big
[2:01:30] Entertainer you know he need
[2:01:31] entertainment in Industry lights I I see
[2:01:35] a preacher thing and they have fire
[2:01:37] behind them not not not Holy Ghost
[2:01:42] Fire you know like a kind of camera fire
[2:01:44] thing and then that smoke and lights
[2:01:48] flashing and thing and they singing and
[2:01:49] people rejoicing
[2:01:52] that even atmosphere know that just
[2:01:56] entertainment
[2:01:59] justs have
[2:02:02] fire listen to
[2:02:05] this Jesus looked upon the audience and
[2:02:07] perceived their thoughts is that right
[2:02:09] perceive their thoughts the word of God
[2:02:11] is sharpen to Ed sword is that right
[2:02:13] Jesus was the word you believe that and
[2:02:15] he is the word and the Bible is Jesus in
[2:02:18] printed form
[2:02:22] So Daniel could look by books what the
[2:02:24] Prophet Jeremiah say because Jeremiah
[2:02:26] words is just God from the mouth of
[2:02:29] godall are you with me so I want you to
[2:02:32] come back now to the printed word the
[2:02:35] very text the very Bible because brother
[2:02:38] didn't come to reveal something outside
[2:02:39] the word he can reveal what was inside
[2:02:41] the word the word is first the word is
[2:02:44] God and when the angel came he compare
[2:02:46] what the angel said to what the Bible
[2:02:47] say because the Bible is the Anchor
[2:02:50] Point
[2:02:52] let's go amen 40 men wrote the Bible
[2:02:55] within the space of thousands of years
[2:02:57] apart never knowing one another seeing
[2:02:59] one another and not one would contradict
[2:03:02] one another it is
[2:03:03] inspired now many look at the Bible the
[2:03:05] Book of Ruth it's a love story of the
[2:03:07] Bible the Bible is a love story the
[2:03:09] whole Bible is a love story not only is
[2:03:11] a love story it's a prophet not only is
[2:03:12] a prophet it's history not only is a
[2:03:14] love story a history a prophet is God
[2:03:16] himself because in the beginning was the
[2:03:18] word the word was with God and the Word
[2:03:20] was God so the word is God on print that
[2:03:24] ought to settled brother God on print
[2:03:26] Jehovah printed on a
[2:03:33] book
[2:03:34] Hall and this story was written and all
[2:03:37] the old manuscripts when they were segre
[2:03:39] in the Bible holy men when they're
[2:03:40] trying to put it together in the Old
[2:03:41] Testament This Book of Ruth was one of
[2:03:43] the outstanding books that they accepted
[2:03:45] why it's just a love story why would the
[2:03:47] writers and ancient sages accept this
[2:03:49] book as inspired because there's a
[2:03:50] hidden revelation in it and in this in
[2:03:52] Revelation you catch the meaning it will
[2:03:54] bring you close to God and I pray my
[2:03:56] whole soul this morning that God will
[2:03:57] catch every heart so Spellbound till he
[2:04:00] reveal himself amen let's go now God
[2:04:05] knowing that this last
[2:04:07] days there will come intellectual Giants
[2:04:12] this is gol
[2:04:14] cousins and
[2:04:15] relatives it's just that this is
[2:04:18] intellectual Giants now those had

[2:04:21] their height and everything else and oo

[2:04:40] prove to the church that there's a

[2:05:59] with it and reason with it there's got
[2:06:01] to come some group somebody somech

[2:06:08] message and those who pressing and
[2:06:10] playing they can't handle it you know
[2:06:12] because you have to press and play for
[2:06:13] they to see with
[2:06:16] you thees and scri you know Jesus come
[2:06:19] according to the book their books
[2:06:22] but according as Moses written of him he
[2:06:24] came according to that written prophecy
[2:06:26] oh praise the name of the
[2:06:28] Lord but
[2:06:31] Bram what good does it do to give a
[2:06:33] canary bird vitamins make him have good
[2:06:36] strong wings and keep him in a
[2:06:39] cage why they try to do that with people
[2:06:41] feed them all kind of
[2:06:43] vitamins and tell them these
[2:06:48] americ these birds in message

[2:06:58] remedy Mysteries and people
[2:07:01] weaky no power no
[2:07:04] nothing God know it will take the
[2:07:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove his
[2:07:10] Latter-Day
[2:07:13] signs listen we cannot leave here weav
[2:07:17] leaving spoken books
[2:07:19] devil we cannot leave here we even books
[2:07:21] to the government you know all closes
[2:07:23] down but we have the
[2:07:25] word it can't work you we sh the
[2:07:28] government word we can't go word doubt
[2:07:34] no it can't be
[2:07:35] that it had to be the witness of the
[2:07:39] spirit almost
[2:07:41] done all right so we're going very good
[2:07:45] after Pages we now on page n almost
[2:07:50] there Jeremiah again we want to read it
[2:07:53] moreover the word of the Lord came to me
[2:07:54] saying Jeremiah Amplified what do you
[2:07:56] see and I said I see a branch or a shoot
[2:08:00] of an almond tree the emblem of
[2:08:03] alertness and activity blossom in L with
[2:08:07] then the Lord said to me you have seen
[2:08:09] well for I am alert and active watching
[2:08:14] over my word to perform it now all about
[2:08:18] to read here I've read plenty times but
[2:08:20] I hope it struck different t tonight
[2:08:23] but Christ is the
[2:08:25] word God dwelt With Us in flesh he was
[2:08:28] the word before a word it's a thought a
[2:08:33] thought has to be created God thoughts
[2:08:36] become creation when it's spoken by a
[2:08:38] word he presented to you as a thought
[2:08:42] his thought it's revealed to you but
[2:08:46] it's still a thought until you speak
[2:08:50] it so this word that can't return void
[2:08:53] must come from
[2:08:56] somewhere so God will drop to you
[2:08:58] Revelation which is his thoughts but you
[2:09:00] still have to speak it and when you
[2:09:02] speak it it become a word oh give the
[2:09:05] Lord some
[2:09:08] Praises he presented to you as a thought
[2:09:11] his thought it's revealed to you then
[2:09:14] it's still a thought until you speak it
[2:09:17] now he said there's three Realms
[2:09:18] humanistic divine revelation and vision
[2:09:21] there only three real people live in
[2:09:23] people Liv in a natural realm humanistic
[2:09:25] realm I hoping hoping hoping Revelation
[2:09:27] is when it's revealed to you and vision
[2:09:30] that's thus say the Lord that's the
[2:09:32] completion that's the final you have a
[2:09:34] vision you know it's going to come to
[2:09:36] pass Moses went out to pray pill fire
[2:09:38] around him he said go and hold your
[2:09:40] stick towards East and call for
[2:09:42] flies so God could have tell Moses go
[2:09:44] and call for flies and Moses holy stick
[2:09:46] towards the east and shake it so
[2:09:52] no fly ain't coming you know he
[2:09:56] could thinking about flies no he had to
[2:09:58] speak it let there be
[2:10:01] flies and then them flies
[2:10:06] come there was no flies but when he went
[2:10:08] and held a sick and said let there be
[2:10:10] flies no flies at all yet went back but
[2:10:13] the words God's thought has already been
[2:10:16] spoken it's a word now it's got to
[2:10:19] happen Hallelujah
[2:10:21] now you see what Jesus said if you say
[2:10:23] this mountain if not if I say but if you
[2:10:26] say to the mountain me move now he said
[2:10:28] this now you can express it by a mental
[2:10:30] conception but if it becomes a real
[2:10:33] revelation of God you see it before it
[2:10:37] happen and express it in word form and
[2:10:40] God takes a whole and becomes material a
[2:10:43] taught
[2:10:45] Express almost done this is good Oho
[2:10:49] boyall did you ever think what Israel
[2:10:53] done in the wilderness there they
[2:10:54] married wives they raised children crops
[2:10:56] and so forth God blessed them and they
[2:10:58] prospered but they were still out of the
[2:10:59] promised land that's the way Pentecost
[2:11:01] is today 40 years ago you wouldn't have
[2:11:04] thought your mother and father wouldn't
[2:11:06] have spasm if they thought you would
[2:11:08] gotten the condition you in them
[2:11:09] oldtimers had tight was tight and
[2:11:11] absolute they held on to the word
[2:11:13] because of what it was he said now the
[2:11:15] hour has arrived he wants to get a
[2:11:18] church ready I'm going to say this with
[2:11:20] a prophetic voice voice I trust I'm not
[2:11:22] saying it in the name of the Lord but I
[2:11:24] believe that it is true the Rapture
[2:11:27] you'll be talking about the Rapture when
[2:11:29] the Rapture has been gone a long time
[2:11:32] you'll be saying bless God the Rapture
[2:11:33] is come it's done pass then Jesus said
[2:11:36] about John why does the scribe say John
[2:11:39] elas must first come you already come
[2:11:41] and you didn't know it one day there
[2:11:43] will come a judgment upon the earth and
[2:11:46] the first thing you know you're going to
[2:11:48] find people here looking for the Rapture
[2:11:50] and they done be been gone a long time
[2:11:52] ago it will be such a minority he said
[2:11:55] as in one the days of Noah so shall it
[2:11:57] be in the coming of the son of man he
[2:11:59] said we think this great big bunch of
[2:12:01] Canon further here Atomic Ash is going
[2:12:03] it's only go if it's got the Life of
[2:12:05] Christ in it so he's saying the amount
[2:12:08] of church folks WR is like Atomic Ash
[2:12:11] the only thing going is with those with
[2:12:12] the Life of Christ in it there will be a
[2:12:16] raptor you think two or three people
[2:12:18] here one over there one over there
[2:12:19] somewhere going missing
[2:12:21] watch looking for the Rapture is already
[2:12:24] passed God places his great power out of
[2:12:27] his church and take a group in Praise
[2:12:29] the Lord now this the part I want to get
[2:12:31] to
[2:12:32] H you see we living in a terrific time
[2:12:36] mustion come up please and that's the
[2:12:38] pressure is upon the church you want to
[2:12:41] see something you want to see something
[2:12:43] but
[2:12:44] now how can God ever watch over his word
[2:12:47] to vindicate it and a person disbel in
[2:12:49] that word won't receive it in their
[2:12:50] heart
[2:12:51] how can the sun shine upon a seed and
[2:12:53] bring it to life when it hasn't got any
[2:12:55] life in it it's got to be germatize seed
[2:12:58] so a Creed is gered listen listen a
[2:13:02] Creed brother George is gerti to make
[2:13:04] more
[2:13:07] members but the word is dramatized to
[2:13:10] make
[2:13:13] Saints to make Believers that's right
[2:13:17] God works to perform his word numbers
[2:13:21] 29:19 says God is not a man that he
[2:13:24] should lie neither the son of man that
[2:13:27] he should repent at he said shall he not
[2:13:29] do it at he spoken shall he not make it
[2:13:31] good Hallelujah the Amplified God is not
[2:13:34] a man that he would tell or act a lie
[2:13:37] neither the son of man that he would
[2:13:38] feel repentance or compunction for what
[2:13:40] he has promised has he said and shall he
[2:13:43] not do it has he spoken and shall he not
[2:13:45] make it good I'm going to wrap
[2:13:48] up God has promised to bless his word
[2:13:52] he will watch over his word to perform
[2:13:54] and take care of it do you believe it
[2:13:58] but I'm talking about the church is no
[2:13:59] longer the mouthpiece of God it is his
[2:14:01] own mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[2:14:05] he will confound her through the prophet
[2:14:07] and the bride here this part for the
[2:14:09] voice of God will be in
[2:14:13] her not on the books and tapes what are
[2:14:16] the books and tipes
[2:14:17] coming in her the voice of God
[2:14:22] and then he give a scripture for R 17
[2:14:24] says the spirit and the bride say come
[2:14:25] once more the world will hear direct
[2:14:28] from God because the word heard direct
[2:14:30] from God in a prophet now they will hear
[2:14:32] direct from God in a bride Hallelujah
[2:14:36] not pressing play but direct from God
[2:14:39] like how Peter said this is the stone
[2:14:41] you bu is refused this is that that the
[2:14:44] prophet Jo
[2:14:46] speaker
[2:14:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:51] look at that I'm really
[2:14:55] done I'm on the last
[2:14:57] page oh praise God hallelujah but not by
[2:15:01] speaking in tongues not by dancing in
[2:15:03] the spirit not by joining church but by
[2:15:07] fruit of the spirit Christian sanss
[2:15:08] canot SM anyone that it's the word
[2:15:11] living there it is if they only looked
[2:15:14] he was Messiah he was the word living
[2:15:18] made manifest and a man that's got the
[2:15:21] spirit of God in him or woman lives that
[2:15:24] word right out in them that's the
[2:15:27] heartbeat the predestinated here we go
[2:15:29] for the word of the Lord comes to them
[2:15:32] and they are the word to the people so
[2:15:35] the word of the Lord comes to the
[2:15:37] predestinated so you could get the word
[2:15:40] coming
[2:15:41] directly to
[2:15:43] you this is it
[2:15:47] hallelujah hallelujah you begin to play
[2:15:50] something We Believe last quote that
[2:15:52] there is to be a church in these last
[2:15:54] days that will receive both former and
[2:15:56] latter Reign it will be scattered
[2:15:58] throughout the world in this loud
[2:16:00] Eastern age it will be a church that is
[2:16:02] called back to the original faith in God
[2:16:05] it will be a church that will have Jesus
[2:16:07] Christ walking in it manifesting himself
[2:16:10] the shout of the king will be in it may
[2:16:13] the Lord bless you praise God I chust
[2:16:17] this message will do something special
[2:16:18] for you that God himself
[2:16:22] would watch over his word to perform it
