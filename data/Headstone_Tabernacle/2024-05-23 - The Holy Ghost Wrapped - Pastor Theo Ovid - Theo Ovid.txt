tonight by pouring out your spirit and pouring out the baptism of the Holy Ghost granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you you it's a blessing to be here tonight just three portion of scripture Joel 2 verse 20- 29 sorry I just put 20 28 here but 20829 and Luke 2 verse2 and acts 18 Joel 228 it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this is God speaking what he will do this has this God not asking anybody opinion about it I it shall come to pass afterwards I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy so there's a clear distinction that the spirit of Prophecy will be here Among Us your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the had mids in those days will I pour out my spirit uh Luke Chapter 2 verse2 and this shall be a signed unto you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the

earth okay so tonight I have a a title the Holy Ghost wrapped that's title the Holy Ghost wrapped and I have a context scripture from Luke chap 24 verse 49 it says behold this is Jesus speaking I send the promise of my father upon you again this have nothing to do with Pastor Bishop Pope message the uh who is pop message Pope they have nothing to do with that this is Jesus speaking here behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from one high so that's a promise power from on high same one that say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you he said power from on high that coming I sending that to you I send the promise of my father upon you Joel prophesy it shall come to pass afterwards I I will pour my spirit Dynamics is guaranteed the rain is thust sayeth the Lord oh give the Lord some this latter rain is thust say the Lord don't study the rain study the seed because rain coming and every seed will bring forth after its kind we give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so when Jesus break this bom on them and said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tiing the city of Jerusalem until be J from on high when Jesus break that upon them verse 50 he led them as fast to Bethany lifted up his hands blessed them and he came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them carried up into heaven and they worship Him Glory to God they wasn't frustrated they wasn't fed up they wasn't trying to give up and the backslide because Jesus gone he said if I don't go the comforter will not come he went he raised from the dead he appeared among them he opened the scriptures he opened their understanding he gave Clarity of the vision of why they were there of what they were called to receive Oh Glory to God they knew exactly what they were waiting for Dynamics to the mechanics the spirit to the word oh give the Lord I shout in the house these disciples knew exactly what they were looking for the Dynamics and mechanics the Spirit come into the word they had the word they had the comforter they had the promise of the comforter but now the spirit must promise oh give the Lord a shout in the house and it came to pass he blessed them he was parted from them CED up into heaven and they worship Him and return to Jerusalem with great joy because the comforter is come it's coming it's coming it's all its way Hallelujah Jesus give it he don't need to come back and tell us again we don't need Malachi for to come again we don't need a new Prophet another Prophet or give the Lord I shout Elias is already Come Oh Glory to God be standing on this word no devil can move us no Spirit can move us no trial nothing present nothing to come no test can move us Oh Glory to God hallelujah and God must always be veiled God must have some skin on him oh give the Lord a shouting house God must be covered get this part and they worship Him and return to him with great joy and we Contin in the temple praising and blessing God May that start tonight Oh Glory to God Hallelujah in the temple continually every time you come to church you're praising God you're blessing God you have joy because you know the Holy Ghost is coming the Dynamics is coming Fire coming who said so God said so and God can't lie he can't make a promise and he can't keep it he said it shall come to pass afterwards I will pour out my spirit which man will stop that Putin can stop that Biden can stop that no Kingdom no power no country nothing could stop the spirit of God from coming and anoint that word Oh Glory to God there is going to be a resurrection I don't care what you think I don't care what you feel oh give the Lord a shout in the house you may be seated Sarah doubted and that couldn't stop her transformation Sarah had question marks Sarah start there standing before God and have a question oh is this thing really true is it so real and that couldn't stop it from happening because once it come out the mouth of God it can return void I am confident every word spoken out to the mouth of that Prophet th s will surely come to pass praise God you watch in front your very eyes he talk about the car coming that going to be driving on his own praise God you see it right in front your eyes praise God you're seeing things fulfilled right in front your very eyes what about the manifestations of sons of God what about the point of the Holy Ghost what about R bride Revival what about the 700 Revival he said I he will send it he promis it he will send it he don't need a train that minister to explain something away from that he said he will send it whether the minister and trainer believe it or not he will still send it he promised it he's a god of promises he's a mighty God he could go past your trials your failures your fears your condition your weakness your low spot you could go past all of that and raise you up you must want change you must want to have a change you must want transformation Oh Glory to God hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah don't miss Sunday service the two kind of pain that have you know the pain of discipline or the pain of regret but either way is pain pick your pain all right but a brown he I want you to notice one thing one of the fulfilling those people who are formal in these formal churches is rising up against the move formal churches formal churches in this message fighting the Holy Ghost fighting praise and worship and the atmosphere and the anointing and we have to create an atmosphere that God could step into it that's what we doing you know God can't come down and dry a bunch of dead training ad what God will do with that not even Cricket do have that kind of people not even Cricket not even footballers have them kind of people everybody going Cricket listen I don't go I don't go Cricket I'm not a cricketer that's why I don't go I can't get any spirit of it's not my thing but anybody who going into Cricket they love Cricket it's one the most boring game I know tell me end all the but my I'm saying is this but when they go in the spirit of it so is also the people like the football that air passing back and forth oh go but in church they dead as a d how no goal to score with that but brandom they have former godliness Den the power there of they are taking their stand here we go communism is taking their stand the but the Holy Ghost is taking its stand when the enemy come like a flood I'll raise up a hand against it that's right and the church has taken a stand I me the Holy Ghost Church and tonight I take him a stand I take him a stand for the Holy Ghost is that you want it or you don't want it if you want to be in the message you stay in the message I want you to want the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the message that's what the prophet brought the Holy Ghost Glory Hallelujah brother B now watch that's now that is all I'm interested in friends when I'm out there I pray for the sick but in here I'm interested in one thing that's the Born Again Church that is what I'm interested in I am not interested in bylaws and deacons and so forth and Orders of the churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day so the prophet had his own burden for his his Tabernacle for his church that the Holy Ghost come upon his church we want fire from we don't know man handle we don't want a man govern we want Holy Ghost to come the pastor under the Holy Ghost the deacons under the Holy Ghost the elders under the Holy Ghost the musicians under the Holy Ghost the singers under the Holy Ghost the congregation under the Holy Ghost the ushers under the Holy Ghost the whole bunch under the Holy Ghost then the pillar of fire hanging over the building no sick could come in here sick oh give the Lord I shout no sick could come in a building sick the sick is healed the blind heal the death here oh the Lord I shout because the shout of the king is in the [Applause] camp I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church he's praying Lord Jesus we close this little gathering tonight after the fellowship around the word and the Holy Ghost and he has blessed us and poured out our hearts the oil of his word there are ministers here men over all walks of life that tasted and seen the Lord is good we know what the holy spirit is now a promise of God now bear in mind he's preaching what is the Holy Ghost given for the night before he preached what is the Holy Ghost so he was already identifying we know what the Holy Ghost is is because he show he a comforter he's an advocate and all these different promises and so on he said we know what the holy spirit is is not an explanation it's a promise of God I care what Pastor saying in this message you know they could mystify it mystery it add history to it but it's a promise of God to you I don't want to leave it hanging there you know I want to put it to you I promise to you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you is you he talking about oh give the Lord a shout the Holy Ghost has poured out on individuals so you can break out tonight you don't have to look to your left or to your right or to behind or in front the Holy Ghost is p of individuals you could be home by yourself tonight hearing this word and the Holy Ghost poured on you oh give the Lord a shout you don't even have to be in this church you don't even have to be in his Tabernacle and the Holy Ghost got poured on you [Music] the Bible said tongues of fire went on each one of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost everybody had their own lick of fire Oh Glory to God you can't take from your brother you can't take from your sister you want your own lick of fire you can't take from your father or your mother you can't take from your wife experience or your husband experience come on give them a lord a shout in the house you got to get your own experience erience oh my Hallelujah we know what the Holy Spirit was the pillar Spirit of Christ sent back and he's in us today as God was above us in the pillar of fire he walk with us a body called Emmanuel God With Us and he's in Us by the Holy Spirit now Jesus said at that day you shall know I'm in the father and you and me and I in you you understand that day because you are in the world of Darkness but at that day you'll understand he what he say now father it could not be made plain and perfect because then we'd have nothing to have faith for but all works of God is governed by faith and by faith in your word in the evidence of the Holy Spirit as we know is now I ask that every hungry soul in here be filled with the Holy Ghost those who do not have it and are hungering for it just remember we say to them Lord like you did blessed are you you when you do hunger and thirst you shall be filled he said that that's a promise you shall be filled that's a promise and it's even blessed to be hungering you are blessed even to know that God has spoke to you no man could come to me except my father draw him and Lord those who are all veterans here they put up their hands I had up mine Lord give us strength give us power to stretch fought the Hand by thy holy Child Jesus that signs and wonders might be done that it might be a deeper Ministry a greater thing than ever happened yet give us boldness and love to speak to the people Grant it Lord Oh Glory not boldness and a stick not boldness and wood not boldness and cracker them but boldness and love to speak to this people oh my Hallelujah praise God there's only one group and that's the Blood Washed Saints of the Living God that's been predestinated since the foundation of the world and I don't care what it is if it's not gmati it will not come up I don't care how much times you join Church how many you belong to unless that life you see all this foolishness about you to come to this church you to come to this group you to come to this thing and come how that is Dem is lying Spirits he said if it's not dramatized so somebody can have 10,000 people and 900 how much are they Stone dead if two drti the church inside of there you it's not the numbers you know it's not the place it's not the location it's not the building is not who is the pastor it's whether or not you get quickened whether or not you get dramatized whether or not Fire Fall upon [Music] you understand this you can't sit down here like some je witness like if some Kingdom Hall heing lectures nothing can quick with that you getting hit your your gra matter stimulated you understand that so what's the devil job if I was the devil I'm not the devil what do you think the devil will do make you coold formal out of the spirit because once you're cold and form out of the spirit no Revelation they coming no quickening they coming no inspiration they coming that's the devil's job that is why when Jesus dropped the promise on them and they returned to Jerusalem with great joy they were in the temple praising and blessing God continually not when they get the razor pay not when some they get a new car no they praise God in advance for a promise that was yet to come oh give the Lord a shout did you get [Applause] thatall they were praising God in advance for a promise that was yet to come because the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come he didn't tell him when it was coming the praise until he said t until until you be doing powerful and high somebody feel L to walk out just so he say you get power yet well I read a quote sit down and shut up oh glory to God hallelujah wait until you changeed yet well you know what what come to me and you know what break upon me I don't want to care what break upon you you sh the power the ho come on you yet well you know I had a dream last night and there a confirmation or read the before that you train that foolishness they have and key unlock liar no key unlock nothing you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost come upon you and when that come upon a when it come upon you it hit you come upon you come upon me no no no it's do something to you it will make you act just like them act when it hit Mary she didn't say I Mary no don't I Mary you know it hit her and they start to walk like drunk men start to stagger because start to move them oh glory to God it gets you out of their flesh it get you out of your tie positioning Place fix and SW if your T FL so it doesn't matter if your if your wig fall off it doesn't matter amen if your if your false teeth fall off you put it back in your mouth it doesn't matter if you fall on the ground it doesn't matter oh give the Lord a shout however God send it we want it oh give the Lord I shout in the house did you hear me Church however God send it we want it give the Lord a shout in the house I want the war without sensation you take that you take that one Hallelujah you take that one I want one sensation no [Music] sensation he said I don't care what it is if it has dramatized will not come up I how much times you join a church how many time you belong to unless that life of yours is gumati by the Holy Spirit you will never go in the Rapture you never raise in that place that you go beneath the grave Hallelujah Hitler tried to make a super race Pharaoh tried to make a super race all them all them Kings of the earth they trying to make a super race I better than you about you know my country better than yours my people better than yours my Army better than yours says men boasting that same Spirit come into churches that same pharoh Spirit come upon pastors ministers message Pope I am more than yours therefore you under me and I am above and who I'm I'm not the you the tail I'm the head hallu God hate that foolishness and yet there's a prophecy that is going to be a super race a super church when has been near the headstone so you know the headstone to get to The Headstone it hones down it is shaped to The Headstone and just before the headstone is what Holy Spirit slot and on top under that Holy Spirit is brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness abos is a Shepherd dream had a rock Box on top there and a big jar honey it couldn't hold the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was boiling through the church and he said no church could hold the Holy Ghost it has boil out the trash but no church could hold the Holy Ghost so no church could say I have it the other one don't have it that's lies that's foolishness you can't say that because the Holy Ghost is poured on individuals so individuals in the church could hold the Holy Ghost not the church as a group so anytime a pastor a minister say they that church have it what that it is he's a liar run for your life oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God do you get it now Enoch didn't have a group Revelation you know Enoch walked with God you know not even WIP went with him you know his mechanics became Dynamics and God took him you know the Bible said there be a two in a bed you know one taking one left you Hallelujah so watch this show it showed that everything man does is corruptible and the prophet talk about all this vaccine and all this medication they have you say as much as they save as much as they killed we know that every time you hear the break up a du the side effect they go to it very fast the side effect is called blindness go kidy problem because man hand on it as long as man hand is the knowledge of Good and Evil so always part of good am car good take from one point to next Point get killed with car man what does it what makes a man do that right want this power thing and what does that is because there's something behind it and he tries here we go to take his own way instead of taking God's way and that's the reason they try to build super denomination super Transportation super cities and so forth and so like that build super things isn't that right but God said I'm going to give you a sign a super sign the Jews want a sign everybody want a sign the world today want a sign they're trying to make their own signs I'm going to give them a sign a virgin shall conceive how humbly he made it this is a super sign a virgin shall conceive and bear a son this was the Fulfillment of all prophets and prophecies this baby wrapped in swaddling clothes could you imagine that all the prophets prophet design always the climax enter the baby you shall find shall be wrapped in swaddling clothes they clo over oxen she had no quilt hallu she had no special thing from the store she didn't get it from Amazon and waiting and and the Box said come on time she didn't have that kind of thing like that she had was the ox that cloth around the ox head there she take it and wrapped her baby in swaddling cloth and that was Jehovah as a baby oh glory to God that was God veiled right there oh give the Lord a shout that was God in Simplicity Hallelujah brother Bram how striking it ought to be God himself would become a baby how that God so love the world one of the greatest scripture that is now the love of God so loved the world he give his only begotten son the very dust that he created on the earth he became that dust how striking it ought to be God Emmanuel changing his cast from God to man stretching his tent from the stars of Heaven to live on Earth with filthy creatures as we are the love of God how that he would do it how striking it ought to be to The Sinner to know little Jehovah crying in his mother's arm little Jehovah not come as a Polish as an angel he come as Abraham's seed he come as a man he never come down the golden corers of Heaven Oh Glory to God but he was born in a manger so poor he had to borrow a womb Hallelujah to be born morning and when he left he borrow a grave to be buried in it was Jehovah Emmanuel a super sign God send prophets he send signs he said he said I'm I'm going to give you a super sign a great sign me myself I am coming down to dwell among you and be called Emmanuel it ought to strike the people himself made flesh dwell Among Us born in a dirty stinking stable little Jehovah not laying in a pink basket in the hospital room but in a stinking manger over a Manuel Pile in a b Emmanuel the creator of Heaven and Earth with a swadding cloth on the Magis had already be on the road they seen a star and was coming to worship God's little gift package that he was sending to the world and when God begin to make his appearance people what they were saying we have seen his star in the east and we come to worship Oh Glory to God isn't that something else a little while the world was going to receive the greatest gift they ever receive a little package wrapped up a little Christmas package it was wrapped up God wrapped it up oh G the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world God did the wrapping he didn't ask permission on how to wrap it and what to wrap it with oh give the Lord a shout you want to tell me God can wap himself with you come on now pre back to me somebody come on preach back Hallelujah why did he refuse it it didn't come as they wanted and the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were use to gifts being handed and that's the reason rejected tonight is because it's not handed to the people in the custom that been used to receiving gifts so the people had open they locking to the pastor and Min only he could tell them that's so foolish yeah so they could talk to the pastor and they go light next minut Minister oh because you don't respect that man but what we are taught to respect all have respect because you don't know if you're talking to an angel you don't know if God send that person into your life to speak you don't know you all people playing with God they claim to believe this message but God himself going to

stop fooling around and you stop in your fighting your fighting you're stopping and you start back and you're stopping and you're going in and out in and out you could fight up with that but this is different this is you pressing that your spirit could be quickened by the spirit of God and God changes your desire and as you're drawing New Life your old life falls out your old leaves drop off your old way drop out because New Life coming in you're drinking from the fountain Oh Glory to God you're drinking from the fountain you understand what you're called for you're called to be a little lower than the Angels not higher above the animals you call to a higher life God give you a higher call that's what Jesus showed the woman well she prostituting and brother M had the compassion to see her life to say she was seeing she is doing that to minor children but Jesus come to release her and say you could get high on that God could bless you above that Hallelujah you could say once I was in that but now I'm out of that once I was lost now I'm found once I was drinking but now I'm out of [Applause] it now I'm free God want to loose you from your past loose you from slavery what the devil keep it do it do it you have to do itall Hallelujah Jehovah crying like a baby they refused the truth of the Gospel no wonder there was no room for him any in no it wasn't wrapped right it wasn't wrapped the classical people wrong it it wasn't it was wrapped as a gift a gift from God sent from God a god they didn't know nothing about they claim they did but they claim they were looking for him them but he did not come the way that they thought he was looking coming according to their Creeds they could not receive God's Gift he was wrapped different he was wrapped like a baby he was born in a manger he came from poor people he come from a bunch of Fanatics how could they receive something like that no wonder there was no room for him then he dropped down here and said this there's no room for him yet in the churches they Ed him they don't believe in it they will say a away with such a is fanaticism people say that in ch Fanatics that Catholic all over again executive message Catholics have Catholics in message a nice good Presbyterian Message Church a nice good Baptist message church we supposed to be in other words if the Pentecostals had received the prophet Raptor gone we left back already the Raptor Raptor already you know but because the Pentecostal reject the message God open a way for us to come in so we supposed to be what Luther came and bust all the Catholic church right then Wesley was Luther plus Pentecost was Luther plus Wesley plus we supposed to be all three plus not minus we can minus Revival minus shouting minus worshiping minus the Holy Ghost and we the word or say the letter kill it but the spirit give it life say here where it goo time going so fast away with suching fanis he said we want nothing to do with it it's against our father's doctrines doctrines of this church doctrines of the message and how M all these years the country that's what they say Christ is just as rejected today as it was back there there's no room tonight in our good churches but I'm drilling down now our big churches our fine churches there's no room in our religious circles today for a holy ghost meeting or have that too yes Holy Ghost meeting it be they don't want it it belittles them in the sight of the class of the country it belittles them to think they have to Humble themselves to come down to the altar to cry and T there until they are filled with power from on high to rise up from there with the newness of life to let woman let their hair grow out and act like women ought to to make men throw away their cigarettes and quit their drinking and treat their families right it's too much for them so they hold onto their Creed and the Creed make them more right than you more right than the shouters oh Hallelujah more right than the Fanatics because they have a creat to hold I believe this no Fellowship but I believe this they can't shake your hand I believe this and they go which Rapture they joining the bunch of what I call tration Saints they rather have a Creed than they would the gift they rather have the paper than the gift like the who throw away the gift and play with the box or you had the money throw the money and play man wrap up in they rather have the paper than the gift a lot of fuss they can about it but the real gift that's on the inside of it they don't want it he was wrapped in a dirty cloth a swaddling cloth he was wrapped today in the same thing let's hear it which is called Holy Roller fanaticism a bunch of herit it is wrapped in swatling cloth and the world don't want it Oh Glory to God this is not the message thing how the messages run we don't care how the messages run we want the Holy Ghost we want to be part of the Holy Ghost Bunch Oh Glory to God we standing for Holy Ghost

to stop that bride from coming forth halloo Glory Glory Hallelujah [Music] he said I'm so glad to raise that cloth off and look what's laying underneath it eternal life God made flesh and dwell Among Us he said as long as God got a People God got a church God's got the Holy Ghost matching with it that is what God gave the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will rise always have but God's got a minority somewhere God's got a little church that will move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to claim in the light and they will be the ones that through their testimony will judge the world I don't care how much Mysteries they have how much histories they have but this Pride with the testimony of the Holy Ghost they are the ones that will judge hallelujah hallelujah don't the Bible say blessed is a pure in heart they shall see God and the other today the saint shall judge the Earth your testimony today will bring judgment against the city testimony our testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God will bring judgment against this city hallelujah hallelujah them that are first will be last and they that will last will be first I don't know I won't know nothing about sank moody in the resurrection they will not know nothing about me in this one but I'll Stand in this one to give him a testimony so will you and through that and by scattering of your light and the baptism of the Holy Spirit and by the lives that you live and the things that God has done to prove that he's moving here with the intellectuals walk away from it they'll be judged by the Saints hallelujah hallelujah power of prayer power of speech power of deliver holy life that is what the Holy Ghost is to do so the Holy Ghost will make you a message believer the Holy Ghost put power in your life power to pray praise God power of speech Hallelujah power to live a holy life power to press forward you need the Holy Ghost you need the power this power will make you live make you a better husband make you a better wife make you a better father better mother better brother better sister better person Hallelujah let's continue let me hit the home Str here they know what was inside of it but they didn't want it and that's the reason they don't want it today because it will make women act different make men act different oh yeah you have to bear the name of a fanatic it's a formal fanatic to just let me remind you not just people jumping up and down you I'm calling formal Fanatics they're fanatically formal you'll have to take the way with the Lord is p you let's go now you will have to clean up your life so don't look some Angel come some BR Cutlass to cut your grass for you no angel come to heaven to use your Buton cut glass God give you that cut for you to use you have stuff to clean up you have stuff to do you will clean up your life you'll have to quit your meanness you'll have to stop doing wrong cheating stealing lying commit adultery you have to stop these things and the people don't want it although they know it is right but they don't want it it brings so much truth to them it uncovers their sin they don't want the Holy Ghost today is because they know what's wrapped in it they don't want the experience of the Holy Ghost they want to hear word they want to hear Mysteries they want to hear I never see it so the Bible talk about people in the last days having itching ears he have teachers because they want something new the ti of the old promises dropping on them they watch a person receive the Holy Ghost they stand out there and see that woman as low as she could be till even dogs would how look at her see that woman come up from the altar a new person see that woman clean up her life get out and act like a lady see one that runs Bridge patties smoke four or five cigarettes a day hang around these saloons a regular Barfly as they know accept this gift of God that's wrapped in the package called Jesus Christ it will spoil every bit of your world fun because you won't stand for it it does something to them it changes people and this is the bum tonight I didn't even know the prophet said it he said people don't want to be changed oh they want to go to church that's right they want to shake hands they want to me people like this is a literal Facebook then you meet other faces and thing but to say change no they like the self Hallelujah anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it by Fai anymore hallelujah it's things that we cannot explain that we have to accept by faith we cannot explain God no man can explain God he's Sovereign he is great he's Mighty watch and then watch he is Great and Mighty we just accept it because we know he's there then by our faith here we go in accepting it he brings the response back to us the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen so Abraham had Faith one when after he got the holy ghost or before he got the Holy Ghost before so Abraham Faith expressed to God he really believed and then God give him the Seal of circumcision evidence that the man had Faith so your praising God tonight is evidence of Faith because you're in trouble you have trouble you know don't know what going to open for you but because you believe God your faith through praise expressed to God that you are expecting him to work something for you on your behalf and God recognized that Faith as righteousness the love of God this one touched me brother George the love of God how God unfold himself and come as a Christmas package and Laing a straw when Jesus died love reaching out his own children crying for his blood he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing that is love now hear this one the church don't want that they want Creed we need love the church is dying by Creeds or let's say this way dying by message Doctrine it can only live by love because love is eternal life and love overcome all things love is the most powerful force their is they didn't want him because they know what was in the gift the church one creeds but he said we need love charity shall cover what a little bit a so where to charity charity never feel it some of them had it revealed to them what the gift was some of them looked into it the first ones that look into the Christmas package was Angels the Angels knew it was revealed to them and maybe one of the little Shepherds laying on the hill that night crying there was no room for him and the same time a Shepherd come on the hill the Angels came down and begin to sing The First Noel today in the city of David is born Christ the Savior it was revealed the Angels revealed to Shepherds and he said that's the only way anybody in the world will ever know what's in that package it has to be revealed to you so brother George by lack of Revelation is why we have so much division not because of Revelation but lack of because the intellectuals have interpretation and knowledge information but not Revelation because revelation will bring Christ back on the scene oh hallelujah hallelujah revelation will bring Christ back in position as the center of the Bible center of the book Center of Your Life Center of everything you will be able to see Jesus Christ all right that's the only way anybody in the world will ever know what's in the package it has to be revealed to you you turn it down say it's fism but when you get the Revelation you will seek for it God will you will open up God will come to you and supp with you and you with him you will never know it until it's revealed to you and when it's revealed to you then you'll go hunting for it when you see that it's life and the only way of life when you see that your church is dry and dead when you see your handshake with a pastor or your sprinkle or short sake has nothing to do with it you'll go to investigating when you're laying on the bed dying doctor say there's nothing left for you you'll be dead in a few minutes you'll want to look into that package then course it will be turned from you then the Bible said if you reject me in your days of Health like you are now when Calamity comes I'll laugh at you you better investigate
