[57:16] and we could uh serve him and minister
[57:19] to him so what blessing so what I
[57:22] realized I was in the room at the back
[57:24] there and I was saying Lord wow you know
[57:26] God says that each man has his
[57:29] place and God placed us all
[57:32] differently and uh I might not be able
[57:35] to do what brother bcll or brother
[57:38] George or different ones he doing but
[57:41] wherever you are God placed you
[57:43] there and and God has a work for you
[57:47] there and uh I might not have seen the

[58:21] and different ones and they can relate
[58:24] what they seen and it's so real and it's
[58:27] so so so tangible when they relate it
[58:30] you you feel the anointing because this
[58:33] man was there and he brings it all the
[58:35] way here and you feel that this is
[58:41] real so we appreciate that it's not in
[58:45] vain God had them there for that purpose
[58:48] but now brother we living in our time
[58:50] too each and every one of us has a
[58:53] testimony about this message every one

[1:14:47] can we stand to our feet so thank you
[1:14:50] for all the ministers and that has
[1:14:52] ministered and stood in the Gap and I
[1:14:55] like to say wherever you stand in
[1:14:57] minister in your own way God bless you
[1:14:59] God placed you there in that little spot
[1:15:02] and I always said wherever you are rich
[1:15:05] out in your area you can influence you
[1:15:09] don't have to be all over the world but
[1:15:11] you can be somewhere and you can be
[1:15:14] effective I told the young people don't
[1:15:16] just be so lazy don't sit back do
[1:15:18] something and I I begin to tell them
[1:15:20] what I did as a young man I didn't have
[1:15:22] to consult any
[1:15:23] anyone but every lunchtime I'll go out
[1:15:26] and give
[1:15:27] books I'll make sure I do something I
[1:15:30] kept myself busy took me 6 months to
[1:15:32] read the church ages but I read it took
[1:15:35] me another 6 months to read the seals
[1:15:37] but I read
[1:15:39] it that's why it's important to read the
[1:15:41] spoken so when the minister and Pastor
[1:15:42] comes and preach you know what he's
[1:15:44] saying you don't sit there and wonder
[1:15:46] what is that you read
[1:15:49] it the seed is already in your
[1:15:52] heart
[1:15:53] but our young people don't read we on
[1:15:55] WhatsApp and Facebook but we don't read
[1:15:58] the spoken

[1:18:39] before him in love having predestinated
[1:18:41] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:18:43] Jesus Christ himself according to the
[1:18:45] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:18:47] of the glory of his grace when Heath
[1:18:50] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[1:18:53] we have Redemption through the blood the
[1:18:55] Forgiveness of sins according to the

[1:32:08] Hallelujah the Bible
[1:32:10] says in the Old Testament on the day of
[1:32:14] atonement when the high priest had to
[1:32:17] take the
[1:32:19] sacrifice and go into the holy of holies
[1:32:22] once a
[1:32:23] year to cover the sins of Israel for one
[1:32:27] year and every year he has to do the
[1:32:29] same thing over and every year and every
[1:32:31] year he has to come back and repeat the
[1:32:34] same
[1:32:35] thing but they say this was such a such
[1:32:39] a time of
[1:32:41] desperation that the high priest had to
[1:32:44] be dressed a certain
[1:32:46] way he couldn't just go in there
[1:32:49] anyway he had to be Anointed with a
[1:32:52] anointed oil of the Rose of Sharon that
[1:32:54] ran all the way down and he had to have
[1:32:57] a certain gown on and at the bottom of
[1:32:59] the Gown there was pomegranates and
[1:33:03] bells so that when he walked into the
[1:33:06] holy of holies and he had a blood of the
[1:33:11] sacrifice and they say all Israel will
[1:33:14] stand there outside the temple there was
[1:33:17] like a holy us they didn't know what's
[1:33:19] going to happen will God forgive
[1:33:23] them and as he walks brother says he
[1:33:26] walks past the outer court with the
[1:33:30] Brazen
[1:33:32] uh that prison
[1:33:35] vases and he walks past and he walks
[1:33:37] past the golden
[1:33:39] candlesticks but now he's coming to the
[1:33:41] holy of holies now he's entering a very
[1:33:44] sacred place and he he starts dipping
[1:33:47] his hand into the bowel of blood and the
[1:33:50] Bible says he had to sprinkle seven
[1:33:51] times towards the east he couldn't go in
[1:33:55] there without
[1:33:58] blood oh brother and the bells are
[1:34:01] making a noise and brother and say as
[1:34:03] it's making a noise it's saying holy
[1:34:05] holy unto our God holy holy and he
[1:34:08] sprinkle in the blood and he sprinkle in
[1:34:11] the blood and he sprinkle in the blood
[1:34:13] seven
[1:34:14] times oh brother man say he spoke of the
[1:34:17] seven Church ages that there'll be blood
[1:34:19] in seven Church ages and then blood for
[1:34:22] this age brother and that's why we
[1:34:24] standing on the word of God there's a
[1:34:26] blood for this age and you need to find
[1:34:28] that blood woo
[1:34:32] Hallelujah old brother and he would
[1:34:34] stand there and do his thing but outside
[1:34:37] there was a holy
[1:34:39] Ash and as long as they heard the bells
[1:34:42] they knew he was still
[1:34:44] alive oh Legend said that they would tie
[1:34:48] a rope around him they say not they
[1:34:50] don't show because in case he die how
[1:34:53] would they get him out there cuz no man
[1:34:56] can go in there so Legend says they tied
[1:34:58] a rope around him and if he died they
[1:35:00] could pull him
[1:35:02] out W Hallelujah come on brother sister
[1:35:06] and then there he was and all Israel
[1:35:08] waiting and when the curtain comes out
[1:35:11] and he comes walking out do you think
[1:35:13] they sit still brother they say all
[1:35:17] Israel

[1:35:35] Jehovah has forgiven us for one more
[1:35:38] year they were
[1:35:40] happy over but this man this man by one
[1:35:46] sacrifice he has
[1:35:48] forever forever forever forever
[1:35:54] perfected them that are
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:36:13] Sanctified if Israel could do that for a
[1:36:17] natural he says when he came out all of
[1:36:20] them went into a raw
[1:36:23] shout knowing that Jehovah forgave them
[1:36:25] just for one year and then next year you
[1:36:28] must repeat but this man this man when

[1:42:46] somebody why because you pulling on the
[1:42:48] Holy
[1:42:49] Ghost we don't see a man we see
[1:42:53] Christ this message came to introduce
[1:42:56] Christ this message speaks about this
[1:43:00] man it comes back to this
[1:43:03] man the the new the Old Testament ended
[1:43:06] what with Jesus John introducing Jesus
[1:43:09] then he said I must go off the scene and
[1:43:11] he must
[1:43:13] increase now we come to the end of the
[1:43:15] Old Testament we had our John he
[1:43:18] introduced us to who to Jesus Christ and
[1:43:21] he said now I must go on the scene he
[1:43:24] must come on the scene so who's on the
[1:43:26] scene it's not a man it's Jesus
[1:43:33] Christ we must decrease get of the
[1:43:37] sin so he can
[1:43:47] increase GL GL
[1:43:52] my and they said when that high priest
[1:43:54] came out he says Israel went in a
[1:43:57] raw they'll Scream and Shout God praise
[1:44:01] Jehovah because they save for one more
[1:44:04] year but the Bible say but this
[1:44:07] man oh I love those three words but this
[1:44:10] man no other man this man after he had
[1:44:15] offered the sacrifice for sin Forever by
[1:44:18] one offering he had perfected forever
[1:44:20] them that are
[1:44:24] Sanctified so I'd like to quickly just
[1:44:26] go for 10 minutes to the Garden of
[1:44:30] Gethsemane he says our dear Lord himself
[1:44:33] in the world's B greatest Battleground
[1:44:35] Gethsemane he cried out in despair
[1:44:37] should I take the sins of the world or
[1:44:39] should I remain on Earth with his
[1:44:41] beloved disciples that's what he wanted
[1:44:43] to
[1:44:44] do notice and the Bible says in Luke he
[1:44:47] went a little further he told the
[1:44:49] disciples you pray but he went
[1:44:54] further and I think that's what we got
[1:44:56] to do we got to go further not just stay
[1:44:58] here by our normal uh surroundings we
[1:45:01] got to go
[1:45:04] further and he says here he went a
[1:45:06] little further how more ought you and I
[1:45:08] to go a little further the scripture
[1:45:10] says here in Luke that he prayed
[1:45:12] earnestly brother sister Jesus had to
[1:45:14] pray earnestly how much more have we got
[1:45:17] to pray earnestly if Christ the god of
[1:45:20] Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly
[1:45:22] then how much more are we Sinners saved
[1:45:24] by grace to pray earnestly if the
[1:45:27] decision throw the Son of God into
[1:45:30] despair what will it do to you and I
[1:45:32] desperately we need to cry
[1:45:36] out the Son of God spent so much time in
[1:45:39] prayer if Jesus had to spend much time
[1:45:42] in prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[1:45:44] spirit that was in him how much more do
[1:45:46] you and I have to spend in prayer much
[1:45:49] prayer and that was Brothers sigma's
[1:45:50] desire to come here pray it up pray at a
[1:45:54] prayer
[1:45:56] room because the hour is upon us it's
[1:45:58] it's not we're not pointing to something
[1:46:00] we say it's
[1:46:05] here so Jesus had to make a
[1:46:08] decision will I take the sins of the
[1:46:14] world and before going to Calvary the
[1:46:18] the father brought his own son into a
[1:46:20] conference in Gethsemane while Angels
[1:46:23] took their positions to see what his
[1:46:25] decision would be oh my god oh it might
[1:46:30] not have been this way but let's think
[1:46:33] maybe it
[1:46:37] was I can hear him say son do you desire
[1:46:41] to go to
[1:46:42] Calvary there's a band waiting for you
[1:46:45] but there's
[1:46:47] persecution there's death and murder
[1:46:49] laying in the way there's exposure of
[1:46:51] your own body they'll strip your clothes
[1:46:53] off you they'll beat you into a pulp
[1:46:56] they'll pull the crown of thorns over
[1:46:57] your head and you'll be screaming for
[1:47:00] Mercy should you go on with this
[1:47:11] decision he says he was saying in
[1:47:13] Gethsemane the greatest suffering of the
[1:47:15] son of every man would be upon
[1:47:18] him can you take
[1:47:21] can you the holy Son of God take the sin
[1:47:23] of adultery can you take the sin and the
[1:47:26] punishment of adultery can you take the
[1:47:28] sin in the punishment of a lie can you
[1:47:30] take the sin in the punishment of all
[1:47:32] things can you bear them upon yourself
[1:47:35] yet
[1:47:37] innocent Christ had to make a
[1:47:39] decision they're going to beat you
[1:47:42] they're going to hit you with first
[1:47:44] they're going to knock you with a stick
[1:47:46] over your head they're going to beat you
[1:47:48] into a pulp your back is going to look
[1:47:51] like a plow
[1:47:53] field are you willing to take the sin of
[1:47:56] adultery and fornication and lies and
[1:47:58] Malice and hate are you willing to take
[1:48:01] that so Christ had to make a
[1:48:06] decision brother says the greatest
[1:48:08] Battleground in get
[1:48:11] salmony he says you're going to die
[1:48:13] alone there'll be nobody with you
[1:48:16] they're going to beat you to a
[1:48:18] PP they're going to strip you naked are
[1:48:21] you willing to take the sins of the
[1:48:23] world upon you he had to make a
[1:48:25] decision and then he he said father uh
[1:48:28] when he realized as a man he says is it
[1:48:31] not possible that this cup can pass me
[1:48:34] isn't there a way
[1:48:35] out the flesh begin to realize that this
[1:48:38] is going to be heavy and he said isn't
[1:48:40] there way I can bypass
[1:48:44] this and Jesus oh I love this when he
[1:48:48] looked into the father's face
[1:48:52] the decision was lan with
[1:48:55] him and you know what he
[1:48:57] said then he made a
[1:49:00] decision he said
[1:49:02] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:49:07] done woo
[1:49:09] Hallelujah he made a decision
[1:49:12] nevertheless I want to stay with my
[1:49:14] disciples I want to be in Fellowship but
[1:49:19] nevertheless
[1:49:24] not my will but thine be done the
[1:49:27] decision anchored and swept the world
[1:49:28] and still comes today to every penitent
[1:49:31] Soul not my will but thine be
[1:49:34] done he made the
[1:49:36] decision hallelujah oh God then he says
[1:49:42] man for this cause came I into the world
[1:49:46] this is the reason I'm in the world was
[1:49:48] to take the son of the world was to take
[1:49:51] your punishment in mine I came for this
[1:49:53] reason when I healed the lapis that was
[1:49:56] by the way when I raised the death that
[1:49:58] was but my goal was to go to
[1:50:01] Calvary woo nevertheless for this cause
[1:50:05] came I into the world this is the reason
[1:50:07] I'm here he says I will
[1:50:10] go and he made the decision and they
[1:50:13] nailed him to the Cross this man made
[1:50:15] the decision for you and me we had to go
[1:50:18] to hell we had to die I we were sent
[1:50:21] away to judgment but you know what God
[1:50:24] emptied out all the
[1:50:26] arrows shut it upon
[1:50:28] him every sin of adultery every sin of
[1:50:32] fornication every sin of malage and lies

[1:50:42] punishment he took your punishment he
[1:50:44] took
[1:50:49] mine
[1:50:51] and the process you know all this time
[1:50:53] when he had to make this
[1:50:55] decision he had you and me on his mind

[1:51:02] fail if I don't go Ed is going to fail
[1:51:05] if I don't go if I don't make this
[1:51:07] decision they won't make it Satan will
[1:51:10] have something against them but this man

[2:13:22] him it was his
[2:13:24] faith and his faith went past all the
[2:13:27] voices and the multitude and it stopped
[2:13:29] the Son of
