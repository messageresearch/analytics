[13:54] we would like to express our sincere

[13:57] the elders and the entire headstone
[13:59] tabernacle family
[14:00] for the confidence and the trust that
[14:02] you have placed in us

[14:19] cheers the season has changed hallelujah
[14:22] the season has changed
[14:24] it's not changing it has already changed
[14:27] hallelujah and i believe something is
[14:29] going to happen this morning
[14:31] we know what's going to happen because
[14:32] god's prophet told us to expect
[14:34] what's going to happen so it should come
[14:36] as no surprise to us
[14:38] what's about to take place it should not
[14:40] be a surprise to you
[14:42] because for 40 years you'll be hearing
[14:44] promise after promise after promise
[14:46] so when we move from promise to
[14:48] manifestation
[14:50] then it's time to rejoice it's time to
[14:52] celebrate
[14:53] it's time for revival it's time for the
[14:56] outpouring
[14:56] it's time for deliverance amen you may
[15:00] be seated
[15:02] brother preached five messages to lay
[15:05] the platform for setting the church in
[15:07] order
[15:08] amen the ministry of jesus christ
[15:10] identified by prophecy
[15:13] the true church identified by prophecy
[15:16] rebuilding the true church the robe of
[15:19] the holy spirit
[15:20] and last week the true joshua generation
[15:23] identified in another ephesians and i
[15:26] believe that the bride has turned the
[15:28] corner
[15:29] can the church say amen and for those
[15:31] who were here last thursday
[15:33] but the terence exhorted the church
[15:35] before the prayer meeting
[15:36] on the conditions that must be met for
[15:39] you to receive the baptism of the holy
[15:41] ghost
[15:42] and the holy spirit moved all over the
[15:44] prayer meeting don't you miss these
[15:46] prayer meetings
[15:47] because the holy ghost is about to pour
[15:49] out and once you meet the same
[15:51] conditions
[15:52] that they met in the upper room the same
[15:54] thing is going to happen to you
[15:56] once you meet the same conditions god is
[15:58] obligated
[15:59] to do the same thing he did back there
[16:02] because he's the same yesterday
[16:04] he is the same today he is the same
[16:06] forever
[16:07] let the church say man
[16:11] amen hallelujah
[16:14] [Applause]
[16:16] so i believe this morning we're in a
[16:18] different season the pastor is in his
[16:20] place
[16:21] the ministers are in their place the
[16:23] elders are in their place
[16:25] the deacons are in their place the
[16:27] trustees are in their place
[16:29] the ushers are in their place the
[16:31] musicians are in their place
[16:32] the technicians are in the place the
[16:34] church is being set in all
[16:36] up what for for the dynamics for the
[16:38] outpouring of the holy ghost
[16:40] for the same signs for the same wonders
[16:43] for the same miracles a seventh under
[16:46] revival
[16:47] can the church say amen
[16:54] amen i truly believe that we are
[16:57] preparing for the fulfillment
[16:58] of the prophet's word in the message of
[17:00] second coming of the lord
[17:02] where he said when that time comes when
[17:04] the church finds its brotherly love
[17:06] when the church finds its holy decency
[17:09] when the church finds its place in
[17:11] christ
[17:11] it'll call to the other members of the
[17:13] body come and rejoice with us
[17:15] and i believe that serves is this the
[17:17] time for the bride to
[17:19] reach that third step up is this the
[17:21] time for place in christ
[17:23] is this the time for you to take your
[17:24] position can the church say amen
[17:28] amen so are you ready for the word this
[17:30] morning
[17:31] amen you know there are different types
[17:33] of services you know there are services
[17:35] where you teach your services where you
[17:36] preach your services where
[17:38] you minister their services that are a
[17:39] bit of a bible study a bit of a sunday
[17:41] school and
[17:42] this morning we're going to have a
[17:43] little sunday school this morning you're
[17:45] going to go back to the bible this
[17:46] morning
[17:47] so can we stand to our feet
[17:51] we're going to go to one portion of
[17:52] scripture
[17:54] we're going to go to joshua 7 this
[17:57] morning
[17:58] joshua chapter 7.
[18:06] amen
[18:11] joshua chapter 7
[18:15] in the book of joshua joshua chapter 7
[18:19] and verse 1.
[18:22] but the children of israel committed a
[18:25] trespass
[18:26] in the accursed thing for acon the son
[18:29] of kamai
[18:30] the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the
[18:33] tribe of judah
[18:35] took of the accursed thing and the anger
[18:37] of the lord was kindled
[18:39] against the children of israel and
[18:42] joshua sent men from jericho to ai or i
[18:45] or ie some people say
[18:47] i'll go with ai for the service which is
[18:49] beside that haven on the east side of
[18:51] bethel and spake under them
[18:53] saying go up and view the country and
[18:55] the men went up and viewed ai
[18:58] and they returned to joshua and said
[18:59] unto him let not all the people go up
[19:02] but let about two or three thousand men
[19:04] go up and smite ai
[19:06] and make not all the people the labor
[19:08] feather for they are but a few
[19:10] so they went up to the of the people
[19:12] about three thousand men and they fled
[19:14] before the men
[19:15] of ai and the men of ai smote of them
[19:18] about
[19:18] thirty and six men for they chased them
[19:21] from before the gate
[19:22] even under sherbarim and smote them in
[19:25] the going down wherefore the hearts of
[19:27] the people
[19:28] melted and became as water and joshua
[19:31] rent his clothes and fell to the earth
[19:33] upon his face
[19:34] before the ark of the lord until the
[19:36] evening time he and the elders of israel
[19:38] and put
[19:38] dust upon their heads and joshua said
[19:41] alas oh lord god wherefore
[19:43] has thou had all brought this people
[19:45] over jordan
[19:46] to deliver us into the hands of the
[19:48] amorites to destroy us
[19:50] what to god we had been content and
[19:53] dwelt on the other side of jordan
[19:55] oh lord what shall i say when israel
[19:58] turned their backs
[19:59] before the enemies for the canaanites
[20:02] and all the inhabitants of the land
[20:04] shall hear of it
[20:05] and shall environ us round and cut off
[20:08] our name from the earth what will thou
[20:10] do unto thy great name
[20:13] and the lord said unto joshua get thee
[20:15] up wherefore lie is thou
[20:16] thus upon thy face israel
[20:20] had sinned and they have also
[20:21] transgressed my covenant
[20:23] which i commanded them for they have
[20:25] even taken
[20:26] of the accursed thing and have also
[20:28] stolen
[20:29] and dissembled also and they have put it
[20:32] even among their own
[20:36] stuff therefore the children of israel
[20:39] could not stand
[20:40] before their enemies but turn their
[20:42] backs before their enemies
[20:43] because they were accused neither will i
[20:46] be with you anymore
[20:48] except ye destroy the accursed
[20:51] from among you up sanctify the people
[20:55] and say sanctify yourself against
[20:58] tomorrow for thus they are the lord god
[21:00] of israel there is an accursed thing in
[21:02] the midst of the o israel
[21:03] thou canst not stand before their
[21:05] enemies until ye
[21:07] take away the accursed thing from among
[21:10] you
[21:11] shall we bow our heads for a word of
[21:12] prayer gracious heavenly father we thank
[21:14] you
[21:15] lord for the word lord that is so
[21:18] precious to us
[21:19] lord it is so real to us this morning
[21:22] lord any man can read the scriptures but
[21:24] it takes the holy spirit
[21:26] to walk out of the pages of the bible
[21:29] and bring it as a reality to your church
[21:31] this morning
[21:32] father god we are a needy people this
[21:34] morning
[21:35] we have not come to hear man this
[21:37] morning we have not just come together
[21:39] this morning
[21:40] lord but we have come to hear a word
[21:42] from the lord this morning
[21:44] that's the greatest need lord the word
[21:46] from the lord
[21:47] lord may you give us a word this morning
[21:50] may you take me out of the way and speak
[21:52] to your people this morning
[21:54] may you bring great deliverance among
[21:56] your people this morning
[21:58] father god may the holy ghost pour out
[22:00] this morning lord
[22:02] may backsliders be restored up this
[22:04] morning father
[22:05] may those who are living on the edge
[22:07] come running back to calvary
[22:09] this morning father may those that are
[22:11] sick be healed
[22:13] this morning father may those that are
[22:15] weary and tired
[22:17] and depressed and frustrated lord like
[22:20] joshua was
[22:21] when he rent his clothes and fell to the
[22:23] earth
[22:24] lord may they hear the words this
[22:25] morning of arise
[22:27] get up because there's much more land to
[22:30] be taken
[22:31] father may you take me out of the way
[22:33] and speak to your people
[22:34] in the precious name of jesus christ and
[22:36] the church says
[22:38] and the church says amen you may be
[22:41] seated this morning
[22:44] [Applause]
[22:48] we are in the bible this morning we are
[22:51] in the wood
[22:53] this morning in the message what was the
[22:56] holy ghost given for
[22:58] but abraham said the same holy spirit
[22:59] that saved the lutherans
[23:01] that sanctify the methodists that
[23:03] baptize the pentecostals
[23:05] is now present tense setting in order
[23:08] the coming of the lord jesus that's why
[23:11] we're here this morning
[23:13] and brother branham said the
[23:14] manifestation of the holy spirit is that
[23:17] angel
[23:18] trying to get the people back to the
[23:20] word which means back to the bible
[23:23] so we're going back to the bible this
[23:24] morning because i've come to realize a
[23:26] lot of people don't know the bible
[23:28] they don't know even know the message
[23:30] but we want to dig deep this morning
[23:32] in the message oneness but at random say
[23:34] here we are in the end time
[23:36] coming from the east and the west and
[23:38] the north and the south what are we
[23:39] doing getting ready for that rapture
[23:42] getting ready listen holding ourselves
[23:44] steady for a few minutes
[23:46] till every fiber is filled with the holy
[23:48] ghost that's what we came here this
[23:51] morning
[23:51] till every five up every fiber
[23:54] is filled with the holy ghost can the
[23:57] church say amen
[23:58] that's what this just what generation is
[24:01] all about
[24:02] it's about every fiber being filled with
[24:04] the holy ghost
[24:05] i want it all over me i want it all in
[24:08] me i want it all around me
[24:10] i can't live without it the good
[24:12] old-fashioned
[24:13] sin killing sky blue holy ghost revival
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:19] hallelujah you may be seated
[24:22] we're going to shake things up a little
[24:24] bit this morning because i'm tired of
[24:26] church
[24:27] how could the preacher say that yes i'm
[24:29] tired of church listen to the prophet
[24:32] in the message paradox he said and so
[24:34] has a church world in this last day
[24:37] it's come along church world has come
[24:40] along
[24:40] it's played its part but there's coming
[24:43] a time when it must cease
[24:45] it's coming a time when church politics
[24:47] will cease
[24:48] there's coming a time when coming to
[24:50] church for coming to church
[24:52] it's going to cease why there has got to
[24:55] come an ephesians
[24:56] of this journey just as other journeys
[24:59] there must come an ephesians
[25:01] [Applause]
[25:03] hallelujah and brother branham taught us
[25:06] that ephesians parallels joshua so when
[25:09] we read ephesians
[25:11] we're reading about joshua and when we
[25:13] read joshua we're reading ephesians
[25:15] so i read from joshua and i read to me
[25:18] eastern this morning because that's the
[25:20] word of god
[25:22] you may be seated don't worry i know i
[25:24] haven't given my title yet i'm just
[25:26] building a background
[25:28] in the message adoption tonight our
[25:30] script is divine in the book of
[25:32] ephesians
[25:33] is the book of joshua of the new
[25:35] testament it's dividing up
[25:37] and setting in order the overcome ones
[25:41] it's setting in order who the overcome
[25:43] ones so if you didn't have anything to
[25:45] overcome
[25:46] there's no setting in order for you but
[25:48] you are here this morning
[25:49] as an overcomer you overcome staying
[25:52] home
[25:52] to be in the house of god this morning
[25:55] some of you overcome
[25:56] sickness you drive yourself into the
[25:58] house of god
[25:59] you overcame something and you're going
[26:01] to overcome
[26:02] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[26:05] flesh the pride of life
[26:06] you're going to overcome a false dick
[26:10] doctrine towards teaching for christ why
[26:14] there's something in you to overcome and
[26:17] the devil he can't take it away
[26:19] he can't stop it it's built here on the
[26:22] inside inside
[26:24] amen brother michael
[26:29] hallelujah you may be seated brother
[26:32] branham said in paradox joshua here
[26:34] is a type of the last day ministry he's
[26:37] not a type of the first ministry
[26:39] he's the type of the last day ministry
[26:42] so some things
[26:43] we could only preach a certain way in
[26:45] this season right now
[26:46] because it couldn't happen in luther's
[26:48] day it couldn't happen in wesley's days
[26:50] it couldn't happen in the pentecostal
[26:52] day it couldn't even happen when brother
[26:54] branham was here
[26:55] he had to wait till it turned to his
[26:56] voice because in the days of the voice
[26:59] of the seven angels when he shall begin
[27:01] to sound
[27:02] the mystery should be finished
[27:07] is anybody in the house this morning do

[28:49] i know i haven't given my title yet
[28:51] we'll get this in a minute
[28:55] you know this is a definition of
[28:56] insanity is when you do the same thing
[28:59] and expect a different result so brother
[29:02] branham said you got to do something
[29:03] for something to happen so they're going
[29:05] to be church services brother george
[29:07] like no other church servants it's not
[29:09] going to be the same way we did it 40
[29:11] years ago
[29:12] 30 years ago because in joshua joshua
[29:14] told the people
[29:16] keep a couple pieces back give some room
[29:19] for the levites
[29:20] because we have not been this way before
[29:22] i know how we walk through the
[29:23] wilderness
[29:24] but this time is different because we're
[29:26] getting ready to cross over
[29:28] don't stay too close to me because the
[29:30] holy spirit
[29:33] oh you don't hear me this morning we are
[29:35] having church this morning
[29:42] he may be seated in joshua
[29:45] he had the spoken word he needed some
[29:47] more time
[29:48] to reach his family he needed some more
[29:51] time to reach his husband
[29:52] to reach a wife to reach the children to
[29:55] reach the one who's drinking right now
[29:56] and he said you know what i could win
[29:58] this battle but i need some more
[30:00] sunlight for the jerome
[30:01] he said sun stands still moon hangover
[30:04] agilent
[30:05] the enemy didn't know what was coming
[30:07] they say the battle is supposed to be
[30:09] over
[30:09] we are into overtime joshua say yes we
[30:12] are into overtime
[30:14] because i'm not a creature of time i'm a
[30:16] creature of eternity
[30:18] oh somebody helped me this morning
[30:23] i'm just building a background this
[30:24] morning you may be seated
[30:27] in joshua they put their feet on the
[30:30] neck of the kings
[30:31] read joshua 12 i believe this king got
[30:34] killed
[30:35] and this king god killed him and this
[30:36] king got killed you think god is going
[30:38] to leave kings
[30:40] devil kings alive around your life no no
[30:43] we are serving notice we are serving
[30:46] notice
[30:47] we are serving notice that we are coming
[30:50] [Applause]
[30:53] serve notice to the devil we are coming
[30:56] hallelujah you may be seated that's what
[30:59] happened
[31:00] to the people of jericho they heard a
[31:02] word
[31:03] of what joshua did they heard how on the
[31:05] other side of jordan
[31:07] they had wiped out some amorites they
[31:09] had heard how the jordan river opened up
[31:12] they had heard how the red sea opened up
[31:14] and they started to trim up
[31:16] because they said joshua is coming
[31:20] and i want to say this morning joshua is
[31:22] coming to your house
[31:24] he is coming to your son he is coming to
[31:27] your daughter
[31:27] he is coming to your job he is committed
[31:34] represents the holy ghost and he's
[31:36] coming he's coming
[31:38] let me prophesy he is here right now
[31:48] [Applause]
[31:51] [Music]
[31:52] you may be seated so we are promised
[31:55] according to revelation 10 according to
[31:57] malachi 4
[31:59] that there must be an ephesians to this
[32:01] there must come an ephesians
[32:03] that these sevenfold mysteries of the
[32:04] word of god
[32:06] must be unfolded and ephesus here
[32:09] sets us like joshua positionally
[32:12] in adoption but ibrahim said you notice
[32:14] joshua after crossing over the land
[32:17] and taking the land he divided the land
[32:19] if from here manasseh here this one here
[32:21] god here
[32:22] oh how it just burns your heart every
[32:25] one of those hebrew mothers gave birth
[32:26] to those children
[32:28] she spoke the very place in her labor
[32:31] pains
[32:31] where they would position where they
[32:33] would be positioned in the promised land
[32:36] and joshua not knowing this but by
[32:38] inspiration
[32:40] letter of the holy spirit after being
[32:42] promised the land
[32:43] give every man his promise exactly what
[32:46] the holy spirit promised through the
[32:47] birth back there
[32:51] i almost reached my title
[32:57] went on how that god has set some in the
[33:00] church
[33:00] through their labor
[33:03] [Music]
[33:05] he said oh they get tremendous sometimes
[33:19] is anybody groaning this morning when a
[33:21] church has grown in
[33:23] the persecution of the outside world
[33:26] believing in the lord jesus
[33:28] that the promise of the holy ghost is
[33:30] just as real to us
[33:32] as it was to pentecost how they groan
[33:35] and cry
[33:36] on the labor pains he said but wait a
[33:39] minute
[33:39] but when they are born and positionally
[33:42] born
[33:43] into the kingdom of god then the holy
[33:46] ghost
[33:47] has set in the church some apostles some
[33:50] prophets
[33:51] some teachers some pastors some
[33:53] evangelists
[33:54] then he gives in there speaking with
[33:56] town's interpretation
[33:57] and he goes on you may be seated
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:02] so i have a title this morning and it's
[34:06] only going to make sense halfway through
[34:07] the message
[34:09] but my title is morning how many men
[34:14] must die how many men
[34:20] die my subject coming
[34:23] out of the valley of echo
[34:28] my inspiration ephesians parallels
[34:32] joshua and for a bit of background for a
[34:35] few minutes i'm not going to keep you
[34:36] long this morning
[34:38] but in joshua 1 joshua receives
[34:41] the joshua commission amen joshua 1
[34:44] begins now after the death of moses the
[34:46] servant of the lord it came to pass
[34:48] that the lord speak unto joshua the son
[34:50] of none
[34:51] moses minister saying moses my servant
[34:54] is dead
[34:55] now therefore arise and this is your
[34:58] first mission
[34:59] go over this jordan thou and all
[35:02] this people unto the land which i do
[35:05] give to them
[35:06] even to the children of israel
[35:10] what land was he talking about in
[35:12] question and answer but the branham said
[35:13] the promised land
[35:14] is to live in this land of the holy
[35:16] spirit
[35:18] that's god's promise for the church is
[35:20] to live in the power of the spirit
[35:22] it's another world it's another land you
[35:25] have to come out of the condition that
[35:26] you've been in
[35:27] to come out to live in this promised
[35:29] land to receive the promise
[35:32] hallelujah and we know that redemption
[35:34] is in two parts coming out of
[35:37] and going into it's not good enough to
[35:40] just come out
[35:42] you've got to go into something
[35:44] [Applause]
[35:46] but the pranama's message has brought a
[35:47] lot of people out but how many will go
[35:50] in
[35:50] when moses went down to egypt he brought
[35:52] everybody out

[35:55] but only two went in
[35:58] are you with me this morning listen to
[36:01] brother man i'm in redemption my power
[36:03] just a few quotes and then
[36:04] i'll get to my text in redemption my
[36:06] power by the ban i'm saying that's what
[36:08] god has did today
[36:10] he gives every one of you that wants it
[36:12] the baptism of the holy ghost
[36:14] but you've got to go in possess it
[36:17] that's all
[36:18] fight out the differences tear down the
[36:20] walls
[36:21] and get started in there and get it you

[36:39] that's all
[36:42] hallelujah is there anybody want to
[36:44] possess their promise this morning

[36:54] sitting here tonight with cancer
[36:56] with heart trouble whatever it is god

[37:08] nothing to do with it the promise is
[37:10] yours god gave it to you
[37:12] just go right in and slay philistines

[37:22] [Applause]
[37:28] hallelujah glory to god you feeling fine
[37:31] this morning
[37:32] just building a background
[37:36] told him he would give them the land
[37:37] same message redemption my power
[37:39] send an angel before them to take care
[37:40] of the way to bring them to the place
[37:42] where it is
[37:43] and this is where the problem begins
[37:46] right here
[37:46] he sends some spies over to bring back a
[37:50] report
[37:51] of how good this land is because for a
[37:54] long time
[37:56] we have heard about the land the
[37:58] children of israel were important for
[37:59] 400 years in egypt
[38:00] and all they talked about between the
[38:02] weapons of the taskmaster
[38:04] was this land flowing with milk and
[38:06] honey and with big grapes
[38:09] and then they come out of egypt and they
[38:11] walk 40 years in the wilderness
[38:13] because the spies went over and 10 of
[38:16] them came back with the same
[38:18] testimony same message
[38:21] same inspiration it's too much to take
[38:26] it's too much to handle while this
[38:29] convention was going on
[38:31] joshua and caleb were not in the service
[38:37] joshua and caleb i don't know he who
[38:39] came back last
[38:41] it was a competition for who came back
[38:43] last
[38:44] because but the branham said they had
[38:46] they hadn't had grapes for 40 years
[38:49] there were no grapes in the wilderness
[38:52] and but iran said they were big grapes
[38:53] and it took two men to bring out a bunch
[38:55] of these grapes
[38:57] caleb and joshua they were feasting on
[38:59] some grapes
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:01] i don't know if they ever had grapes
[39:03] before but when they tasted these grapes
[39:05] caleb's clothes was soaked in grape
[39:07] juice
[39:09] grape juice was running on his face he
[39:12] put grape juice on his hair i don't know
[39:14] but this was something that he wanted
[39:16] more of he didn't want just to have some
[39:18] grapes and and go back home and say i
[39:20] came and got some grapes
[39:21] he wanted this all the time and he
[39:23] wanted to stay as long as possible
[39:25] in the presence of the evidence of the
[39:28] new land
[39:29] is there anybody with me this morning
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:33] so here it is just one caleb come back
[39:35] to the convention late
[39:37] convention is over and instead of
[39:40] jubilee
[39:41] instead of this is here jubilee brett
[39:43] anthony instead of noma
[39:44] and ala nasi they come to see
[39:48] lord not even singing
[39:52] just crying in a camp joshua looked at
[39:55] caleb
[39:56] caleb looked at joshua did they eat the
[39:58] same grapes
[39:59] did these brothers tell them how good
[40:01] this holy ghost land is how good this
[40:03] adoption land is
[40:04] how good this perfection land is that
[40:07] the sun they've been trying to reach for
[40:08] all these years that they could get
[40:10] delivered now
[40:10] if we just go into the holy ghost land
[40:13] that that the daughter that's all messed
[40:14] up
[40:15] if she could just get in contact with
[40:17] this holy ghost land
[40:18] something not may happen but something
[40:21] has got to happen
[40:23] do they know that the testimony of jesus
[40:25] is still the spirit of prophecy
[40:27] at every place every place
[40:39] and because of the majority
[40:43] the consensus the going trend
[40:46] the whole children of israel end up
[40:48] walking for 40 years
[40:50] and caleb all caleb knows i'm going to
[40:52] keep on fighting because we're going to
[40:54] come back around
[40:55] we're going to come back around with a
[40:56] new people who don't know about egypt
[40:58] a new people who don't know about
[41:00] negativity and new people who don't know
[41:02] about the old ways and how we used to do
[41:04] it and
[41:05] what you did to me in egypt and why the
[41:07] test method none of that
[41:09] all they know is promised land all they
[41:11] know is promised land
[41:12] all they know is promised land
[41:16] a new generation he may be seated i'm
[41:19] just building a background this morning
[41:21] how you feeling everybody feeling fine i
[41:24] know it's raining outside i know it's
[41:26] flooded all over the country but you are
[41:27] here this morning
[41:28] under the canopy of his presence
[41:31] sheltered
[41:32] abiding on the eye under the shekinah
[41:34] glory
[41:37] we don't need to go back home you know
[41:38] the only one i want to go to is the one
[41:40] on the other side brother
[41:42] let them listen you know what's going on
[41:45] you may be seen
[41:45] the whole creation is grown in it's
[41:47] travailing
[41:48] i was driving up i look at the clouds
[41:50] and say what am i driving into
[41:53] look all dark and gloomy but it's
[41:54] something triggered on the inside that's
[41:56] the creation grown in
[41:58] they are waiting for this message this
[41:59] morning they are waiting for you to come
[42:01] forth this morning
[42:02] the flood is waiting for somebody to say
[42:05] move back
[42:06] somebody to move back the cloud somebody
[42:08] to say
[42:09] sun come on and shine four days
[42:15] we are going to have our episodes we are
[42:18] going to have another ephesians
[42:20] in this church
[42:26] amen you may be seated
[42:29] don't you see in shadow stop here a
[42:31] minute improving his word you know this
[42:33] quote
[42:34] there's got to be a place prepared for
[42:36] the world to be made manifest
[42:38] and we are now living by the evidence of
[42:40] the new land
[42:41] amen the son of man
[42:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:48] it's your promise it's your promise it's
[42:51] your promise this morning
[42:53] hallelujah but iran i'm saying turning
[42:55] northward possess the promise
[42:57] the promises unto you and to your
[42:58] children to them that are far
[43:00] off as many as the lord our god shall
[43:02] call
[43:03] christian brothers sisters we have been
[43:05] on this land long enough
[43:06] we have been around this mountain long
[43:08] enough he said when there's powers
[43:11] that's unknown
[43:12] when the resources is untapped haven't
[43:15] even touched the power yet
[43:18] he made me see this the purpose of the
[43:20] end time message was to loose the holy
[43:22] ghost
[43:23] the holy ghost was bound at the river
[43:25] euphrates for almost two thousand years
[43:27] but christ the son of man failed in a
[43:30] son of man the prophet
[43:32] lose the holy ghost lose your
[43:33] inheritance lose your promise
[43:36] in the form of the word but god didn't
[43:38] want the holy ghost
[43:39] to fall on your flesh on your ideas on
[43:41] your emotions and your pride and your
[43:42] foolishness because we'll be just under
[43:44] the pentecostal church
[43:47] so for all these years it has been
[43:48] disguised as the word
[43:50] and service after service we are
[43:52] supposed to echo what the prophet
[43:54] said waiting for the right people for
[43:57] the just for generation
[43:58] waiting for the old heads in the message
[44:01] who were there for a long time
[44:03] to not be here anymore
[44:09] that's why the prophet say the secret is
[44:11] the word is in the bride
[44:12] not the words in the message churches
[44:15] the word is in the bride
[44:17] and how do you know who is bride she can
[44:19] take the full word
[44:21] you know i really wonder sometimes
[44:22] people tell me they got the holy ghost
[44:24] but i'm saying many times
[44:25] if you got the holy ghost you'll say
[44:26] what the word says
[44:28] so if you say you have the holy ghost
[44:29] and you're not seeing what the word says
[44:31] then i know you have no holy ghost
[44:33] because if you have the holy ghost and
[44:34] you make see something wrong you quick
[44:36] to correct it
[44:39] because the holy ghost could only
[44:40] identify with the word
[44:42] can the church say man so how do you
[44:44] know who the bride is she can take the
[44:46] full word
[44:47] she could take correction she could take
[44:49] rebuke
[44:52] hallelujah so if he didn't find this
[44:54] morning so we're in joshua one just
[44:56] laying the background for a few more
[44:57] minutes
[44:58] verse three every place in the soul of
[45:00] your foot shall tread upon
[45:02] that i have given you as i said to moses
[45:04] in other words the same word that moses
[45:06] got now it's more positive
[45:08] now it's present tense and god begins to
[45:11] give them the drawing map he gives
[45:12] joshua to draw him he don't want just
[45:14] what to miss one inch of ground with a
[45:15] kangaroo so he says from the wilderness
[45:18] and this lebanon unto the great river
[45:21] the river euphrates
[45:22] all the land of the hittites they might
[45:25] be there right now but it's your land
[45:27] and onto the great sea towards the
[45:29] growing town of the sun
[45:31] in other words as far as the eye can see
[45:34] when the sun goes down all day is your
[45:36] land
[45:38] shall be your coast
[45:41] you may be seated i told you we haven't
[45:43] sunday school this morning right
[45:44] we're just reading the bible we're just
[45:46] having a good time around the scriptures
[45:48] hallelujah like i said to them in the
[45:51] midweek
[45:51] services i said there should be a joy
[45:55] that comes from reading the scripture
[45:57] and i know all of you spend time every
[45:58] day reading the scripture right in the
[46:00] morning and in the evening and midday
[46:01] you read the scriptures right
[46:02] so sunday should be just a refresher i
[46:05] said to them on wednesday they said
[46:07] there is a direct correlation
[46:09] a direct relationship between how much
[46:11] time you spend with the bible
[46:12] and how fast you find the scripture on
[46:14] sunday morning
[46:17] season people struggling 20 minutes the
[46:19] minister read the scripture 20 minutes
[46:20] ago
[46:21] and they're still trying to find the
[46:22] scripture but the more you in the word
[46:25] are we gonna get it listen to what god
[46:27] told joshua
[46:28] there shall not any man be able to stand
[46:31] before thee
[46:32] all the days of thy life not for the
[46:34] first 10 years not for 20 years
[46:36] all the days of thy life there shall not
[46:38] be any man
[46:39] be able to stand before you there shall
[46:41] be no problem be able to stand before
[46:43] you
[46:44] no trial no temptation no sickness
[46:47] no evil nothing will stand before you
[46:50] as i was with moses so i will be with
[46:53] thee
[46:54] i will not steal thee nor forsake thee
[46:59] is this the scripture or not
[47:02] be strong enough for good courage
[47:06] for a reason no it's not just be strong
[47:08] and courageous be strong and
[47:09] for good courage and there's a
[47:10] difference between strength and courage
[47:13] you could have a real muscle and be real
[47:14] strong and real scared
[47:19] working out lifting iron bench pressing
[47:21] 300 pounds and the moment you see a
[47:23] squirrel you're running in that
[47:24] direction
[47:26] strength and courage are two different
[47:28] things you could be strong but courage
[47:30] is when you could face the devil in the
[47:32] face
[47:32] brother branham say and say boo right
[47:34] back the devil said boo and some of us
[47:36] with all the muscles all the world all
[47:38] the mechanics we have
[47:39] when the devil said boo we say oh sorry
[47:41] sorry that no
[47:42] not this land sorry sorry sorry i'll see
[47:44] you right here
[47:45] but courage means yeah boo
[47:48] you want you want a piece of this boo
[47:51] what
[47:52] you you really want to try this you know
[47:54] who my god is
[47:55] you know where i come from you know
[47:57] where i'm going i'm not backing down
[47:59] yeah i'll stand up right here
[48:01] to your face and take
[48:10] you maybe see this so be strong
[48:13] enough for good courage for unto this
[48:15] people
[48:17] shalt thou divide for an inheritance
[48:20] the land which i swear unto their
[48:22] fathers to give them
[48:24] but the random said and i see shall
[48:26] possess together his enemy
[48:27] joshua was taking a promised people to a
[48:30] promised land
[48:32] by a promise of god
[48:35] verse 7 only be thou strong and very
[48:37] courageous now
[48:39] students of the bible would realize that
[48:41] whenever god repeats something
[48:44] there's a reason for it he says be
[48:46] strong enough for good courage
[48:48] to divide the inheritance but he brings
[48:50] it back now and i want you to take note
[48:51] of this
[48:52] only be thou strong and very courageous
[48:55] thou
[48:56] thou mayest observe to do according
[49:00] to all the law which moses my servant
[49:03] commanded thee
[49:04] turn not from it to the right or to the
[49:07] left
[49:08] that thou mayest prosper whethers
[49:10] whoever thou goes
[49:11] in other words this word that we have
[49:13] received from brother branham
[49:15] we can turn to the left we can turn to
[49:17] the right
[49:18] we can look around and listen
[49:21] god told joshua be strong and very
[49:24] courageous to do this thing
[49:28] the first strength and courage was about
[49:31] dividing the inheritance
[49:32] the second was strong and very
[49:34] courageous to not turn to the left
[49:36] when people tell you go this way turn to
[49:38] the right when they say try this way
[49:40] but stay focused on the word that i gave
[49:43] through my prophet moses
[49:48] listen to what brother branham said in
[49:50] harvest time he said don't never
[49:52] never anytime leave that scripture for
[49:54] anything
[49:55] not one word of it stay exactly with
[49:58] that scripture
[49:59] do we have any bible believers here this
[50:01] morning
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:04] listen to this verse eight how we doing
[50:06] this morning
[50:07] we came to spend a while right let the
[50:09] flood water subside we're gonna be
[50:11] here we're breaking it to eternity this
[50:12] morning
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:15] verse 8 this book of the law shall not
[50:18] depart out of thy mouth
[50:20] what a testimony it's always in your
[50:23] mouth
[50:24] you're always talking about god you're
[50:26] always meditating on the word
[50:27] you don't have time for politics you
[50:29] don't have time for gossip
[50:30] you don't have time to backbite you
[50:32] don't have time to talk about people
[50:34] this book of the law shall not depart
[50:36] out of thy amount
[50:37] but listen but thou shalt meditate
[50:40] therein day and night
[50:41] that thou mayest observe he is repeating
[50:44] it
[50:44] to do according to all that is written
[50:46] therein in other words even doing that
[50:48] the first time
[50:48] let me see it again
[50:52] what god is doing is laying down some
[50:54] conditions
[50:55] in the joshua commission for what is to
[50:58] happen
[50:58] in the 24 chapters of the book of joshua
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] to do according to all that is written
[51:05] therein
[51:06] for then thou shall make that way
[51:08] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[51:10] success
[51:12] verse nine have not i commanded thee be
[51:15] strong enough for good courage for the
[51:16] third time
[51:18] be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
[51:20] for the lord thy god is with thee
[51:22] with us whoever thou goes but abraham
[51:25] said in god's power to transform
[51:28] the true predestinated believers will
[51:30] stay with the word
[51:31] because they are part of that word
[51:36] listen to brother branham and satan's
[51:38] eden in august of 1965
[51:40] that's a few months before he left he
[51:42] said i don't care what it is see
[51:44] if it's against god's word be against it
[51:48] that's your enemy anything that's
[51:51] against the word is your enemy
[51:53] everything that's for the word is your
[51:55] brother he's a part of you
[51:58] that's the prophet
[52:01] you love the lord this morning
[52:05] how many men must die we're going to
[52:07] touch it in a few minutes
[52:09] so that was joshua 1. in joshua 2 he
[52:12] sends out the spies aspire jericho
[52:14] in joshua 3 the chairman cross jordan
[52:17] and god
[52:18] tells josh what to leave some stones as
[52:21] a memorial for what god did for you that
[52:23] day
[52:24] that's in joshua four in just four five
[52:26] joshua orders the second circumcision
[52:29] and we are introduced to the captain of
[52:31] the host
[52:32] who gives joshua instruction on how to
[52:35] take jericho
[52:39] joshua was inclined to wait on god
[52:42] and when he waited on god to hear a word
[52:45] from the lord he looked up
[52:47] and there was somebody standing there
[52:48] with and who are you for us
[52:51] against us and it was the captain of the
[52:53] house and he gave him the strategy
[52:56] to take the land to take jericho the
[52:59] first city that they were to conquer
[53:01] coming out of jordan they had to deal
[53:03] with jericho or they couldn't go
[53:05] anywhere jericho was the first point of
[53:08] contact
[53:10] and i'm getting close to my text now
[53:13] god told them for six days i want you to
[53:15] just walk around jericho
[53:18] it's going to look as if nothing is
[53:19] happening it's going to look as if
[53:21] you're just going to church and going
[53:22] back home
[53:23] let them talk about you let them laugh
[53:25] on the walls and say
[53:26] is this the great army of israel that
[53:28] defeated the amorites and walked through
[53:29] the
[53:30] jordan and walked through the red sea
[53:31] and it's going to look as if nothing is
[53:32] happening but be quiet just
[53:34] walk around jericho just walk around
[53:35] your problem just just take a good look
[53:37] at your promise walk around it and
[53:39] and tell yourself quietly in your heart
[53:41] it's coming down it's coming down it's
[53:42] coming down
[53:43] don't don't make any noise about it just
[53:45] look in your heart and say
[53:46] this situation is coming down it's up
[53:48] the walls are going to come down
[53:50] they can't stay up forever just walk
[53:52] around there in your heart you just know
[53:54] that you know that you know
[53:55] it might look as if nothing is going on
[53:57] for six days for the kangaroo
[54:00] [Applause]
[54:02] but on the seventh day you're going to
[54:04] walk around
[54:06] seven times and i can imagine whether
[54:08] michael as they walked around that first
[54:10] time by now the guys on the wall had put
[54:12] away their weapons and
[54:14] they were playing monopoly and playing
[54:16] uno and planes
[54:17] gravel because it's like these people
[54:19] just came to work out
[54:21] this is like the savannah just walk
[54:22] around in savannah some people walk
[54:24] around savannah on a monday on a
[54:25] wednesday
[54:25] maybe they're just working hard this
[54:27] week
[54:29] but then all of a sudden there was a
[54:30] second time they went around
[54:33] and the men are going to take note well
[54:35] today seems to be you know the hard day
[54:36] when they woke up and there's a hard day
[54:37] do you push extra
[54:38] you see maybe this is that day and they
[54:40] walk strong a third time and a fourth
[54:41] time and a fifth time in the sixth time
[54:43] and
[54:43] on the seventh time after the seventh
[54:45] time decided to do something different
[54:47] go to joshua when you tell the people to
[54:49] shout let them begin to shout when i
[54:52] built a shout shout and see the wall
[54:54] just come down
[54:55] and brother they started to shout and
[54:57] they blew the trumpet
[54:58] and the men in jericho didn't even know
[55:00] what to expect because this was not the
[55:02] kind of warfare they were expecting
[55:04] they expected a different kind of
[55:05] warfare but god gave them a strategy
[55:08] to take the land because god is a god of
[55:10] strategy
[55:12] can the church say amen
[55:16] [Music]
[55:19] so all of that i said to reach this
[55:21] point of the message
[55:24] to come to my text
[55:27] in joshua six as they are plundering
[55:32] jericho god gives joshua
[55:36] an instruction
[55:39] because when god calls the people
[55:41] brother madam said he calls for a total
[55:43] separation from all the things of the
[55:44] world
[55:46] but random calls it an annihilation from
[55:48] the worldly things
[55:50] he said separate yourself and god will
[55:52] bless you come out from among them be
[55:54] not partakers of their sins
[55:55] york yourself not up among unbelievers
[55:57] but york yourself with believers
[55:59] fellow citizens of the kingdom so god
[56:02] told joshua joshua
[56:05] jericho is a cursed city
[56:11] keep yourselves from the accursed things
[56:16] i've given you the victory but whatever
[56:18] you do
[56:19] don't mess with the accursed things
[56:22] he told us to bring all the silver the
[56:25] gold the vessels of brass and iron
[56:27] into the treasury of the lord but burn
[56:29] everything else
[56:30] in jericho because jericho is cursed
[56:34] i don't want you to be like them i don't
[56:36] want you dressed like them i don't want
[56:37] you to do what they do
[56:40] except for rahab and her family and what
[56:42] she has burn
[56:44] everything else don't try to see what
[56:47] you could use don't try to see what you
[56:48] can salvage don't try to see what you
[56:50] could
[56:50] take back to your house burn it don't
[56:53] listen to their dvds and their movies to
[56:55] see what's on it to see
[56:56] how you could use it burn it
[56:59] burn everything kill everything destroy
[57:03] everything
[57:08] amen and joshua and his men they go to
[57:11] the city
[57:12] and they burn and they destroy and they
[57:14] kill and they do what god says
[57:17] and joshua six ends with so the lord was
[57:21] with joshua
[57:22] and his fame was noise throughout the
[57:24] city
[57:26] but now i can really strike my text
[57:30] jericho is in ruins
[57:34] the smoke is still rising
[57:38] as the ashes blow over the surrounding
[57:40] land
[57:41] the children of israel get ready for the
[57:43] next move
[57:45] the next destination is really bethel
[57:48] because bethel was a sacred place to
[57:50] israel
[57:52] in bethel there abraham built his altar
[57:56] bethel is where jacob saw his ladder
[57:58] bethel was of strategic importance to
[58:00] the children of israel
[58:02] because bethel was plum straight heading
[58:04] into the
[58:05] promised land brethren was a holy and
[58:08] sacred place
[58:10] but to get to bethel you have to pass
[58:12] through ai
[58:14] ai was a city that covered the road on
[58:16] the way to bethel
[58:20] so the bible said that joshua sent out
[58:22] some men to look
[58:24] at ai and these men came back
[58:28] with a very intellectual message we have
[58:31] analyzed it
[58:33] we have looked it over we have done the
[58:35] research
[58:36] after we have the evidence of taking
[58:38] jericho which had a wall this city has
[58:40] no wall
[58:41] jericho was a big city this is a smaller
[58:43] city i think we could just take maybe
[58:45] two thousand or three thousand men
[58:48] and take ai joshua says all right
[58:54] let's do it now bear in mind the bible
[58:57] says that 40
[58:58] 000 men of war crossed jordan with
[59:02] joshua three thousand men
[59:05] went up to ai to take ai
[59:09] they were confident they knew joshua won
[59:12] they knew every place the soul of the
[59:14] foot tread upon was theirs
[59:15] and they went to vanquish the next
[59:18] destination
[59:19] and the bible says before they reached
[59:21] the kid
[59:23] the amorites started to beat them
[59:26] and the amorites chased them down into
[59:30] our valley
[59:31] when they should have had the victory
[59:34] they had to turn their backs on the
[59:36] enemy
[59:37] and they ran away to retreat
[59:40] to the valley of depression retreat to
[59:43] the valley of contemplation
[59:45] retreat to the valley of wondering what
[59:48] went
[59:49] wrong retreat to the valley of confusion
[59:52] retreat to the valley of self-pity what
[59:54] happened to me and
[59:55] why did this happen and how did this
[59:56] happen
[59:59] not only were they chased out not only
[1:00:02] did they lose the battle but when they
[1:00:05] had a scripture such as no man shall
[1:00:07] stand before you
[1:00:09] the bible said 36 men
[1:00:13] died on that day 36 funerals were
[1:00:16] attended
[1:00:18] that should not been attended 36
[1:00:20] eulogies were read by the terrence
[1:00:23] that should not have been read 36 reits
[1:00:26] were laid down at graves
[1:00:28] at men who should have been alive
[1:00:32] because something had gone wrong
[1:00:36] after you read joshua 1 to 6
[1:00:39] this defeat was not supposed to happen
[1:00:42] just what did not expect it joshua did
[1:00:44] not understand it
[1:00:46] instead of gaining ground the bible said
[1:00:48] the people's hearts melted
[1:00:50] they were afraid to worship they were
[1:00:52] afraid to cry out
[1:00:53] free to claim what is their own they're
[1:00:55] covered in a valley
[1:00:58] don't know what to do
[1:01:03] joshua could not go on because something
[1:01:06] had to change
[1:01:09] joshua got desperate just what tore his
[1:01:12] clothes
[1:01:14] rent his clothes laid his head down at
[1:01:16] the ground and he began to cry
[1:01:18] and he along with the elders covered
[1:01:20] dust on their faces and they cried
[1:01:22] the bible said until evening time
[1:01:27] and i asked the question this morning
[1:01:29] how many men must die
[1:01:34] before we really get desperate amen
[1:01:37] how many men must die before we truly
[1:01:40] call on god
[1:01:42] how many men must die before we realize
[1:01:45] we need to hear from the lord because
[1:01:47] joshua this time
[1:01:48] had not heard from the lord how many men
[1:01:51] must
[1:01:52] die before we realize that this is not a
[1:01:53] game and this is not playing church
[1:01:56] how many men must die before we realize
[1:01:58] that satan is not taking prisoners
[1:02:00] he is out to kill you how many men must
[1:02:04] die before we call for real
[1:02:06] real premier how many men must die
[1:02:09] before realize that without the token we
[1:02:12] are finished
[1:02:13] how many men must die before we realize
[1:02:16] that it's a life it's a thunder
[1:02:18] that shakes the devil i asked you this
[1:02:22] morning how many more
[1:02:23] men must die before realizes not by
[1:02:27] might not by power
[1:02:28] but by the spirit of the lord how many
[1:02:32] more young people
[1:02:33] must backslide how many of our young
[1:02:36] women
[1:02:36] must get pregnant out of marriage how
[1:02:39] many of our young men
[1:02:40] must be drunk in clubs how many men must
[1:02:43] die
[1:02:43] before the church gets back on track
[1:02:50] how many marriages must suffer how many
[1:02:53] men must die
[1:02:54] before realize that god will only keep
[1:02:57] his word
[1:02:58] how many men must die before we realize
[1:03:00] that there's a price
[1:03:02] for disobeying god's word 36 men good
[1:03:05] men
[1:03:06] mighty men men who weren't even part of
[1:03:08] the problem
[1:03:10] died on that day
[1:03:13] we are in joshua and this message is a
[1:03:16] cautionary tale
[1:03:17] to all of us because had they stayed
[1:03:20] with the world
[1:03:21] those men would have been alive with
[1:03:23] their wives with their children
[1:03:25] with their families
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:28] i challenge you church how many
[1:03:32] men thank you lord first die praise god
[1:03:36] before we realize that coming the church
[1:03:38] is not good enough
[1:03:40] how many men must die before i realize
[1:03:42] that a house divided against itself
[1:03:44] cannot stand
[1:03:47] how many men must die before realize
[1:03:49] that brethren cannot persecute prejudice
[1:03:52] how many men must die for real life
[1:03:54] without love we're not going anywhere
[1:03:58] how many men must die
[1:04:02] before we clean the sin out of our lives
[1:04:05] how many men must die before we clean
[1:04:08] the sin
[1:04:08] out of the church
[1:04:12] how many men must die before we can make
[1:04:14] a church that would make a revival
[1:04:17] how many men must die before husbands
[1:04:19] can love their wives and wives could
[1:04:20] reference their husband and children can
[1:04:22] obey their parents how many men must die
[1:04:24] before we put on the whole armor of god
[1:04:29] haven't we lost enough haven't we pained
[1:04:32] enough
[1:04:33] haven't we cried enough haven't there
[1:04:35] been enough of a sacrifice
[1:04:38] for moving away from god's word how many
[1:04:40] men must die
[1:04:42] for us to come back to god and say god i
[1:04:44] am sorry
[1:04:46] i didn't know what i was doing i didn't
[1:04:47] realize i went off somewhere
[1:04:49] how many men must die before we see real
[1:04:51] repentance and joshua
[1:04:53] lay down his head and cried until
[1:04:55] evening time he and all the elders
[1:04:58] because they could not go on they could
[1:05:00] not go on they couldn't just go to
[1:05:01] church as if it was normal
[1:05:03] they couldn't just open their bible as
[1:05:05] if it was normal
[1:05:06] because god said i was with you and it
[1:05:09] looked as if god was knocked
[1:05:11] out
[1:05:16] those men who went to a.i they did not
[1:05:19] hear from god
[1:05:22] they were overconfident they didn't
[1:05:24] realize that they didn't even win the
[1:05:25] battle in jericho
[1:05:27] it was the captain of the host who had
[1:05:29] led them to victory
[1:05:31] it was not their strength it was not
[1:05:33] their ideas it was not how much
[1:05:35] quotes they knew how much scripture they
[1:05:36] understood it was only the grace of god
[1:05:39] that the captain of the host had come
[1:05:41] down to tell him what to do
[1:05:45] and their idea was let us have a
[1:05:48] convention
[1:05:49] take three thousand men and we're going
[1:05:51] to do it amen
[1:05:54] they did not hear from god
[1:05:59] but not only that
[1:06:03] there was sin in the camp
[1:06:08] sin in the camp as they found themselves
[1:06:12] in the valley the valley that is
[1:06:16] named the valley of eco and that's why i
[1:06:19] got my inspiration
[1:06:20] coming out of the valley
[1:06:24] of echo because there's no coming out
[1:06:28] until you clean the sin out there's no
[1:06:30] coming out
[1:06:31] until you get back to the word there's
[1:06:33] no coming out
[1:06:35] until you hear from god there's no
[1:06:37] coming out
[1:06:38] until there's real confession there's no
[1:06:40] coming out
[1:06:41] until there's real repentance there's no
[1:06:43] coming out unless husband make things
[1:06:45] white with their eye wives and wives
[1:06:46] make things right where their husbands
[1:06:48] and children repent to their parents
[1:06:49] there is no coming back
[1:06:50] unless brother repents to brother
[1:06:51] there's no coming back unless we are in
[1:06:53] order
[1:06:55] and i looked through the church this
[1:06:57] morning and there are many people in
[1:06:58] their own
[1:06:59] valley of echo after great victory
[1:07:04] at jericho after great victory on a
[1:07:05] mountaintop after hearing the gospel
[1:07:08] after salvation after being baptized
[1:07:09] after coming to this message
[1:07:11] you find yourself in your own trouble
[1:07:13] that would that word echo
[1:07:15] means troubling so it's a valley of
[1:07:17] trouble
[1:07:18] a valley of troubling a valley of
[1:07:20] depression that value
[1:07:22] a value where you wonder where you are
[1:07:25] and i believe that this morning we have
[1:07:26] been in the valley long enough
[1:07:29] friends the valley is not forever the
[1:07:32] valley is just for a season
[1:07:33] we don't belong down in the valley the
[1:07:36] valleys are not inheritance there's more
[1:07:38] land to be taken
[1:07:39] and many people found themselves stuck
[1:07:43] in the valley of eco but i want to
[1:07:46] refocus what that value represents this
[1:07:48] morning are you with me this morning
[1:07:50] i know there's not one of those jump for
[1:07:52] joy preach happy services but
[1:07:54] i told the brothers i had that gift of
[1:07:56] preaching people happy i don't have that
[1:07:57] one
[1:08:00] i believe in getting right with god
[1:08:04] that's the only real message friends get
[1:08:06] right with god
[1:08:08] amen the valley is our opportunity to
[1:08:10] regroup
[1:08:11] to retrain to refocus to get ready
[1:08:16] let the devil laugh while we're in the
[1:08:17] valley but satan
[1:08:20] we're coming out the valley friends
[1:08:23] coming out this valley
[1:08:24] will not be by accident
[1:08:27] there's a way out of the valley
[1:08:31] god told joshua joshua you have cried
[1:08:35] long enough you have wept long enough
[1:08:39] that's enough of that get up
[1:08:42] let's fix the problem get up from your
[1:08:44] condition
[1:08:46] stop crying lift your head up lift your
[1:08:48] chest up
[1:08:49] square your shoulders back look up i
[1:08:51] didn't call you to cry according to
[1:08:52] possess the land
[1:08:54] that land that the amorites have that
[1:08:56] you got defeated at you you got to go
[1:08:57] back there
[1:08:58] because this is not your promise there's
[1:09:00] a lot more land to be taken
[1:09:01] so let's get focused on getting the
[1:09:03] bride in position
[1:09:04] let's get focused on getting a super
[1:09:06] church a super race
[1:09:08] as we near the headstone is there
[1:09:10] anybody with me this morning
[1:09:15] enough minimum time
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:26] god told joshua
[1:09:29] the people have mixed the acoustic
[1:09:34] with their own stuff
[1:09:38] with their own stuff makes the world
[1:09:43] with our own stuff friends god
[1:09:47] is not going to do anything for you if
[1:09:49] you're mixing the world
[1:09:51] with your own stuff
[1:09:56] we've got us had a burn that occurs
[1:09:59] stuff
[1:10:00] this morning burn it out this morning
[1:10:05] the same god who told joshua i took you
[1:10:07] out of egypt i took you
[1:10:08] to the red sea i took you to jordan i'll
[1:10:11] go with you i'll never leave you he said
[1:10:12] i'm not with you
[1:10:14] until you take away the accursed thing
[1:10:18] some of us need to clean our closets out
[1:10:21] clean our cell phones out
[1:10:23] clean our inboxes out clean our
[1:10:25] libraries out
[1:10:26] clean our cars out clean our houses out
[1:10:29] clean our list of friends out
[1:10:30] because we are mixing the accursed thing
[1:10:35] with our stuff
[1:10:38] but the branham and adoption he said why
[1:10:40] did they die innocent men
[1:10:42] because one man stepped out of line
[1:10:45] listen to
[1:10:46] listen to brother branham you see the
[1:10:48] reason this needs to be taught
[1:10:50] the church lining up lining up with the
[1:10:54] word of god
[1:10:55] lining up with god and lining up with
[1:10:57] each other
[1:10:58] walking perfectly upright soberly before
[1:11:02] all men
[1:11:02] fearing god that's from the prophet
[1:11:07] listen to the prophet in presuming acon
[1:11:11] why when he took that little wedge and
[1:11:13] that babylonian garment
[1:11:15] he taught it will never be seen
[1:11:19] he said well what's that just a little
[1:11:21] garment i'll stick it under here and
[1:11:22] probably
[1:11:23] my family will enjoy it if we ever get
[1:11:26] into a tight place i got a little wedge
[1:11:27] of gold nobody will see it
[1:11:29] just wrap the thing together and put it
[1:11:30] under my coat and go on
[1:11:32] he presumed that it was all right but
[1:11:35] god's commandment was take
[1:11:36] nothing out of that clear city don't
[1:11:38] have nothing around you that's cursed
[1:11:41] friends this message is not about your
[1:11:42] life when you're in church shaking
[1:11:43] people's hands
[1:11:45] it's that hidden life when nobody's
[1:11:47] around
[1:11:48] because akon couldn't tear the garment
[1:11:50] and walk with it through the child
[1:11:52] no no because he knew that that's why he
[1:11:56] had to hide it
[1:11:57] because he couldn't wear it openly
[1:12:01] so it's a challenge to all of us friends
[1:12:04] listen to what god did in getting this
[1:12:07] cleaned out could you take some more
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:13] joshua 7 14 in the morning therefore you
[1:12:16] shall be brought according to your
[1:12:18] tribes
[1:12:19] and it shall be that the tribe is the
[1:12:21] lord take each other
[1:12:22] and come according to the families and
[1:12:24] the family which the lord shall take
[1:12:26] shall come by household
[1:12:27] and the household which the lord shall
[1:12:29] take shall come man
[1:12:31] by man there is no hiding in church
[1:12:34] anymore there's no hiding in the message
[1:12:36] anymore man by man and it shall be
[1:12:40] listen that he that is taken with your
[1:12:42] cursed thing
[1:12:43] shall be burned with fire
[1:12:46] is that what happened to ananias and
[1:12:48] sapphira
[1:12:51] dead on the spot is that the kind of
[1:12:53] church we're coming back to yes
[1:12:55] you stray from the word death you lie to
[1:12:58] the holy ghost
[1:12:59] death serious hour friends he that is
[1:13:04] taken with the accursed things shall be
[1:13:05] burned with fire
[1:13:06] he and all that he have because he had
[1:13:08] transgressed the covenant of the lord
[1:13:10] and because he had wrought folly in
[1:13:12] israel so joshua rose up early in the
[1:13:15] morning and brought israel by their
[1:13:17] tribes
[1:13:18] and the tribe of judah was taken
[1:13:21] and he brought the family of judah and
[1:13:23] he took the family of the zaha heights
[1:13:25] and he brought the family of the
[1:13:27] zeitgeist man
[1:13:28] by man and zapdi was taken and he
[1:13:31] brought his household
[1:13:33] man by man and a khan the son of kamai
[1:13:36] the son of zabday the son of zerah of
[1:13:38] the tribe of judah was taken
[1:13:41] and joshua said unto achan my son give i
[1:13:44] pray thee glory
[1:13:46] to the god of israel and make confession
[1:13:49] unto him
[1:13:50] and tell me now what thou has done hide
[1:13:52] it not from me
[1:13:54] now when i read up to this point i i
[1:13:56] began to pray and think about i said
[1:13:58] listen
[1:13:58] akon wasn't stupid he knew what he took
[1:14:02] he knew what he did he had an
[1:14:03] opportunity
[1:14:05] to willingly come and say stop the
[1:14:07] search
[1:14:08] stop the search stop the search
[1:14:13] i am the man
[1:14:16] he knew what was going on he knew what
[1:14:18] he hid he could have stopped it
[1:14:20] but he really wasn't repentant and we
[1:14:23] see in scripture
[1:14:24] it was in his heart
[1:14:27] and it can answer just once said indeed
[1:14:30] i have sinned
[1:14:30] it's almost like when you're calling him
[1:14:32] you're ready to call on him focus
[1:14:34] now is he okay here yeah it was me it
[1:14:35] was me it was me use me
[1:14:38] friends before it reached that point
[1:14:39] where the holy ghost calls out because
[1:14:41] it's prophesied the holy spirit will
[1:14:43] call sin out in the church
[1:14:45] before the holy spirit calls it out you
[1:14:48] better run to the pastor run to the
[1:14:50] ministers run to the elders
[1:14:52] and you get prayer for your condition
[1:14:54] because the holy ghost will judge you
[1:14:56] from this day on out by the word
[1:15:01] you living loose you live in foolish you
[1:15:03] not doing what you're supposed to do in
[1:15:04] the world
[1:15:05] the holy ghost is going to judge you
[1:15:07] from this day on
[1:15:09] you are walking on dangerous ground
[1:15:12] and he can answer joshua and said indeed
[1:15:14] i have sinned against the law god of
[1:15:16] israel
[1:15:16] and thus and thus have i done and this
[1:15:19] part bothered me even more listen to
[1:15:21] what happened
[1:15:22] when i saw among the spoils listen
[1:15:24] carefully a goodly
[1:15:26] babylonish garment and i want to stop
[1:15:30] right there
[1:15:31] imagine you under the gun for the george
[1:15:34] you
[1:15:34] under the pressure all 12 tribes of
[1:15:37] israel
[1:15:38] all of the elders all of the people when
[1:15:40] we are supposed to be fighting we have
[1:15:42] called a halt
[1:15:44] you standing in front of joshua and the
[1:15:46] elders
[1:15:47] and you will still describe the garment
[1:15:49] as goodly
[1:15:54] he picked up a comment in jericho or
[1:15:57] babylonish the bible says
[1:16:00] a garment from babylon that god said
[1:16:03] because of your covenant
[1:16:04] i don't want you to wear their clothes i
[1:16:06] don't want you to look like them
[1:16:08] talk like them walk like them live like
[1:16:10] them
[1:16:11] and in his heart he say it's a goodly
[1:16:13] garment
[1:16:14] i like it it looks nice
[1:16:17] it was good to him isn't it funny the
[1:16:21] stuff that we think is good that god
[1:16:22] said is cursed
[1:16:26] friends it's time we check up what we
[1:16:28] value as good that god said don't touch
[1:16:32] and some people might think they're
[1:16:33] above this message this is a simple
[1:16:35] message
[1:16:36] but you see when judgment strikes you're
[1:16:38] going to come back to this service
[1:16:39] and say oh you mean that book i was
[1:16:42] reading and that close i was reading
[1:16:43] because but the brandon said anything of
[1:16:44] the word how small it is you're going to
[1:16:46] get judged by it
[1:16:47] that's why he said full obedience to the
[1:16:48] world is what will entitle you to the
[1:16:50] token
[1:16:53] is anybody with me this morning he said
[1:16:56] when i saw among the spoils of goodly
[1:16:59] babylon his government in the world
[1:17:02] looking good these tires in the water
[1:17:03] looking good the fashion of the world
[1:17:04] looking good
[1:17:07] and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[1:17:10] gold of 50 shekels weight
[1:17:11] then i coveted them and i took them and
[1:17:14] behold they are hid
[1:17:15] in the earth in the midst of my tent and
[1:17:17] the silver under it
[1:17:19] money that was supposed to be in the
[1:17:21] temple because god told them take it to
[1:17:23] the treasury of the lord
[1:17:25] you people who don't want to pay tights
[1:17:26] that's that's you right there
[1:17:28] you keeping the money for a rainy day
[1:17:30] god will judge you by it yes
[1:17:32] that's the world we're back to the bible
[1:17:34] what's supposed to be god's supposed to
[1:17:36] be god that money was supposed to be in
[1:17:37] the temple
[1:17:38] not under his bed not hiding somewhere
[1:17:40] in his house
[1:17:41] he hit the garment and the money for a
[1:17:42] rainy day a year well the rainy day has
[1:17:44] come
[1:17:46] judgment day has come and joshua sent
[1:17:50] messengers and iran unto the tent and
[1:17:52] behold
[1:17:53] it was hidden his tent and the silver
[1:17:55] under it and listen and they took him
[1:17:57] out of the midst of the ten and brought
[1:17:59] them unto joshua
[1:18:00] and unto all the children of israel and
[1:18:02] laid them out before the lord
[1:18:03] and joshua and all israel with him took
[1:18:06] econ
[1:18:06] all of israel was watching this happen
[1:18:10] took aikon the son of sarah and the
[1:18:12] silver
[1:18:13] and the garment and the wedge of gold
[1:18:16] because now it is all kirst
[1:18:17] and his sons and his daughters and his
[1:18:20] oxen
[1:18:21] and his asses and his sheep and his tent
[1:18:24] and all that he had and they brought
[1:18:26] them into the valley of echo
[1:18:29] and joshua said why hast thou troubled
[1:18:31] us
[1:18:32] the lord shall trouble thee this day
[1:18:36] and all israel stoned him with stones
[1:18:38] and burned them with
[1:18:40] fire after they had stoned them with
[1:18:42] stones and they raised over him a great
[1:18:44] heap of stones
[1:18:45] unto this day so the lord turned from
[1:18:48] the fierceness
[1:18:49] of his anger wherefore the name of that
[1:18:51] place was called the valley of echo
[1:18:53] unto this day i hope this message stirs
[1:18:56] your heart
[1:18:57] i know it's going to kind of jump for
[1:18:59] joy message but friends this is real
[1:19:00] this is reality
[1:19:02] it's back to the bible it's back to the
[1:19:03] word it's back to the principles laid
[1:19:05] down on the day of pentecost
[1:19:08] listen to what brother bannon said in
[1:19:09] the message presuming acon thought
[1:19:12] this little old wedge it won't make any
[1:19:14] difference
[1:19:15] listen to brother random the rest of the
[1:19:17] ladies are cutting their hair i'll do
[1:19:19] the same it won't make any difference
[1:19:21] but what did they do it never brought
[1:19:23] pleasure to his family it brought depth
[1:19:25] to every one of them
[1:19:26] and listen to brother adam and when we
[1:19:28] compromise on
[1:19:30] any commandment of god to please the
[1:19:32] people we kill the thing right there
[1:19:35] one little wedge one babylonian garment
[1:19:38] stop the marching army brother
[1:19:41] one thing that we permit the church to
[1:19:43] do that's wrong
[1:19:45] one thing that we won't call out against
[1:19:47] to make the people straighten it up it
[1:19:49] will stop
[1:19:50] the march of the church
[1:19:55] what are we doing we are still setting
[1:19:56] the church in order
[1:20:01] listen to brother brother they presume
[1:20:03] you're going on
[1:20:04] we may be in name we may be in numbers
[1:20:06] but that ain't what counts
[1:20:07] it isn't what counts is god with us god
[1:20:09] in us god moving through us his word
[1:20:12] alive in us listen carefully friends but
[1:20:15] the brandon when he would do the prayer
[1:20:16] line
[1:20:17] many times he would tell the people if

[1:21:33] josh was seven should not have happened
[1:21:38] those men were not supposed to die
[1:21:42] a heavy price was paid for what akan did
[1:21:46] not only did the 36 good men die but he
[1:21:49] lost his children
[1:21:51] he lost his family he lost everything he
[1:21:54] had
[1:21:54] including his own life because he
[1:21:56] disobeyed
[1:21:58] god friends all god wants his obedience
[1:22:01] to his word
[1:22:02] and that's why he says full obedience to
[1:22:04] the world will entitle you to the token
[1:22:07] i can't worry about who doesn't want to
[1:22:09] believe who was one to obey but i have
[1:22:10] to see lord as for me and my house
[1:22:13] i want to live the way you want me to
[1:22:15] live i want to clean my life up
[1:22:18] because it's the grace of god friends
[1:22:20] but you have to do what you're supposed
[1:22:22] to do
[1:22:23] because joshua eight is coming and in
[1:22:25] joshua eight
[1:22:26] god twelves joshua get up
[1:22:30] you gotta overcome i want you to go back
[1:22:34] to ai
[1:22:35] because now that you clean up the camp
[1:22:38] it's time for you to have the victory
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:41] can the church say amen now that you get
[1:22:44] the house back in order
[1:22:46] it's time for you to have the victory
[1:22:49] now that the sin was out the camp
[1:22:51] now just what he needs to hear from god
[1:22:53] this time he can't go in his own
[1:22:54] strength anymore
[1:22:55] and what i love about this is the first
[1:22:58] time
[1:22:59] they went with three thousand men but
[1:23:02] this time
[1:23:03] god tells them i want you to take all
[1:23:05] the men of war
[1:23:07] don't leave any men cutting potatoes
[1:23:10] don't leave any men in the kitchen
[1:23:12] take all the men of war take all 40 000
[1:23:14] men
[1:23:15] and take them to fight do we have any
[1:23:17] men of war who are ready to fight now
[1:23:21] not only because you see it you see the
[1:23:23] remarkable difference between
[1:23:25] hearing from man and here from god man
[1:23:27] says let's take two thousand men
[1:23:28] and they were whooped god says here's
[1:23:30] what take all the men of war
[1:23:32] and just as in jericho god said i'm
[1:23:34] going to give you a strategy
[1:23:36] i want you to put 30 000 men over the
[1:23:38] nights send them overnight
[1:23:40] 30 000 men and put them on one side of
[1:23:42] ai don't let anybody know they're there
[1:23:44] i want you to put another 5 000 men on
[1:23:46] the other side and i want you
[1:23:49] to ride out to face ai and when you go
[1:23:53] this time with a george they're gonna
[1:23:56] come out to fight you
[1:23:57] thinking it was like the first time and
[1:23:59] he says they're gonna chase you
[1:24:01] and i want you to turn your back and i
[1:24:03] want you to run away from them
[1:24:05] because i wanted to look as if you're
[1:24:07] still defeated
[1:24:08] i want you to look as if you're washed
[1:24:10] up i want you to look as if you can't
[1:24:12] have a revival
[1:24:13] i want you to look as if you still don't
[1:24:15] have the holy ghost i want you to look
[1:24:16] as if you're not adopted
[1:24:18] i want you to look as if you never had
[1:24:19] the victory
[1:24:22] and when you run away from them and they
[1:24:24] come out raise your spear
[1:24:26] and let all the men of israel charge
[1:24:29] the bible says the men of the amorites
[1:24:31] when they look to the left they were
[1:24:33] israelites when they looked to the right
[1:24:34] they were israelites when they looked in
[1:24:35] front of them they were israelites when
[1:24:37] they looked at the back there were
[1:24:38] israelites
[1:24:38] he said burn that city he said i will do
[1:24:41] to ai
[1:24:41] what i did to jericho burn everything
[1:24:45] you maybe see them not only that
[1:24:49] the bible said the men from bethel the
[1:24:51] next city they came to help the amorites
[1:24:53] the bible said all of them died too
[1:24:56] because this time they heard from god
[1:25:00] brother sister i pray you hear from god
[1:25:02] this morning
[1:25:04] and you get your house in order you get
[1:25:06] your life and all up and watch your holy
[1:25:08] ghost
[1:25:09] sweep into this place can the church say
[1:25:11] man
[1:25:14] oh hallelujah sir this is the time
[1:25:18] for i will ride this trail one more time
[1:25:21] hallelujah that defeated position
[1:25:23] that you've been in that weaken position
[1:25:25] that's just temporary you're going to
[1:25:27] have the victory
[1:25:28] there's a prophecy over you god's
[1:25:30] prophecy still applies
[1:25:32] but when you are in order when you're in
[1:25:34] your position
[1:25:36] not the devil could move not a demon can
[1:25:38] move you may be seated
[1:25:41] as they get ready to close out the
[1:25:43] ephesians church
[1:25:44] had word and spirit together the
[1:25:46] ephesian church
[1:25:48] had mechanics and dynamics the ephesians
[1:25:50] church heard from the lord
[1:25:52] just like jericho there was no
[1:25:54] stronghold that would stand before them
[1:25:56] can the church say amen but something
[1:25:58] went wrong the church fell away from the
[1:26:00] word
[1:26:01] because only the world could conduct the
[1:26:03] spirit
[1:26:04] four enemy agents the power worm the
[1:26:06] caterpillar that can't go on the locust
[1:26:08] had come and eat down the tree they had
[1:26:10] lost their right their entitlement to
[1:26:12] the token
[1:26:13] because only for obedience to the world
[1:26:16] will entitle you to the token
[1:26:18] and from a state of great victory from
[1:26:20] the day of pentecost
[1:26:22] they found themselves in their valley of
[1:26:24] echo
[1:26:27] but daniel 12 says and at that time
[1:26:29] shall michael stand up
[1:26:31] in that time of trouble in that valley
[1:26:33] of trouble
[1:26:34] at that time shall michael stand up that
[1:26:37] great prince
[1:26:38] which standing for the children of thy
[1:26:39] people and there shall be a time of
[1:26:41] trouble
[1:26:42] such as never was since there was a
[1:26:45] nation
[1:26:45] even to that same time and at that time
[1:26:48] thy people shall be delivered every one
[1:26:52] that shall be written in the book
[1:26:56] so is this a time for great deliverance
[1:26:59] since it's just a time for a great
[1:27:02] victory
[1:27:04] oh hallelujah you maybe see there
[1:27:07] the great church hallelujah had stopped
[1:27:10] hearing from god
[1:27:11] there was sin in the camp and what a sin
[1:27:14] unbelief
[1:27:14] anything moving away from the word of
[1:27:16] god but in the valley
[1:27:18] god began to set his church in order try
[1:27:21] by tribe age by age family by finally
[1:27:25] house by his house in the very world by
[1:27:27] individual
[1:27:28] what was it i will restore saith the
[1:27:31] lord
[1:27:32] we will ride this trail one more time
[1:27:35] the tree of life will grow again
[1:27:38] the alpha church and the omega church
[1:27:40] will be the same power
[1:27:42] the same signs the same wonders the same
[1:27:45] miracles
[1:27:47] can the transcendent hallelujah
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:52] i feel like samson this morning after a
[1:27:54] while samson said the devil had no right
[1:27:57] to take on my eyes yes i may have been
[1:27:59] defeated yes i may have made mistakes
[1:28:01] but the devil had no right to take on my
[1:28:03] eyes and the devil had no right
[1:28:05] to kill those 36 men yes things might
[1:28:07] have been shaken
[1:28:08] but satan don't forget for a minute that
[1:28:10] we are still the people of god
[1:28:12] we have lost enough men but we are still
[1:28:14] the army of the lord
[1:28:15] you made a mistake when you kill those
[1:28:18] men you made a mistake
[1:28:19] when you attacked my family you made a
[1:28:22] mistake when you attacked the church of
[1:28:23] the living god
[1:28:26] somebody say man hallelujah

[1:28:34] looking for but isaac i'm looking for
[1:28:35] all the men of war
[1:28:37] to begin to take their place to get into
[1:28:39] their position
[1:28:40] because when you're in your position
[1:28:41] there's nothing could move you
[1:28:43] perfect fate is based on your position
[1:28:46] i'm looking for men of god
[1:28:47] who would take up their rightful place
[1:28:49] in the kingdom of god

[1:29:05] you may be seated the prophet introduced
[1:29:08] messiah
[1:29:08] he restored back to fate he revealed
[1:29:11] every mystery
[1:29:12] and left us with a promise of dynamics
