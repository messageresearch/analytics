amen thank you brother Anthony we are so glad to be here tonight to gather around the word and to seek the Lord let's bhead with a prayer we have a pray request for somebody Mar for my name go Paul

be a complete deliverance Lord Jesus from the condition that they in bar with on his Li and go all father God with this alcoholic condition takes your spirit to break these things and we pray for total Deliverance that they come to know the saving of Jesus Christ granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it and father as we approach your word tonight may you speak to our hearts and give us that bur of prayer Lord you said because of iniquity the love of many will wax for help us tonight that our hearts will be so stirred to love you more and that beautiful song Lord I give you my heart my soul and if we could only live to glorify you what a difference it would make in what we see in how we act how we live and what we do interpret the word to our hearts Lord because you are your own interpreter granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and God be with you tonight and if you have your Bibles I like you to turn to Proverbs Chapter 14 we want to read four verses there 1 to4 Proverbs Chapter 41-4 I'll read verse four first then I'll go back to verse one the four reads where no Ox are the crib is clean but much increased is by the strength of the ox now this scripture this verse was given to me my son Andrew and it just red me since he spoke it and I went to see the context of it where uh what is around it and that is where it was placed this verse four let's go to verse one every wise woman build it her house but the foolish pluck it down with her hands he that walth in his uprightness fear of the Lord but he that is perverse in his ways despised him in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of Pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them where no oxen are the CRI is clean but much increased is by the strength of the ox may God bless his word and as we want to share something before we get on with prayer tonight that first verse here oh so what I have is four sayings that's the title I have four sayings Proverbs 14 1-4 and the first one every wise woman builted a house but the foolish pled it down with her hands as you would know Andre and I we would have to do counseling marriage counseling over the years different couples come go and different things like that and this scripture was so applicable to uh a family that we did and the wife the sister was just terrible in her own house just trying to break down whatever the husband do trying to break him like break his spirit and what she really trying to do is to bring her husband under her subjection actually the Bible call a woman that pluck it down her own house with her own hands is a foolish woman because the man was placed by God functionally for a purpose which is not just a lead doesn't lead but to be a priest in the house so the Bible call a wise woman the one who builds one who uplifts one who inspires that is how she builds a house and I'm seeing the same thing with the foolish CH members pulling on the church pulling on the church plucking it down to their own family and others pulling down the ministry pulling down what the church is striving for what the church want to accomplish and in doing that the same church later on they want to look for help and for prayer and for deliverance and viritual but they already pull it down in their own hearts and Minds verse two he that walth in his uprightness fearth the Lord but he that is perverse in his ways despises him now I know something hard to think but but there are people that go to church that hate God that against God and they are against God and hate God by their actions and their words and the attitude and that word perverse perverse is contrary to what is right from Good Wicked or depraved it is characterized by a resulting from willful opposition or resistance to what is Right expected or reasonable there some people so say something they want to oppose they don't know what they want to oppose they just want to oppose they just want to have a different view to appear to be different and that perverse it continues willfully opposing or resisting what is Right expected or reasonable Paul Paul in Acts 20 he said take it unto yourselves and to all the flu over which the Holy Ghost had made you overseers and before that he just say I have not to declare unto you the counsel of God and he exalted the ministry to feed the Church of God which had purchased with his own blood for no this and Paul was prophesying after my departing shall Grievous wordss enter in among you not sparing the flocks now the wolf doesn't come in and have a label on his head I'm a grievous wolf no the Grievious wolf doesn't come with a label and a title no they come just ordinary but what you say but also know of your own selves that's among them shall men arise speaking perverse things purpose what is the purpose of all these Mighty Revelations and Inspirations and so on to draw away disciples after them so at the end of the day it's all about self flesh and that piece of beef that they want to parade so this is what this is about Paul speaking about men speaking things you wonder how could it be but this is the prophecy vers three of the same scripture we read in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of Pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them and in the Proverbs 15:7 I would just want to really amplifi it says the lips of the wise dispers knowledge sifting it a shaft from the green not so the minds and hearts of the self-confident and the foolish so the foolish genuinely lacks discernment they don't have that sifting to know you know what right if from wrong the changing of things so the mou of the foolish it speaks about the speech and the words of someone that lacks wisdom and understanding and these kind and type of individuals they speak things that are negative they speak things that have effect and consequences both to themselves and others but let's go to the last verse here verse four where no Au are the CRI is clean no Ox things thck and span but much increased is by the strength of the ox so this proverb is a reflection of a tradeoff between cleanliness and productivity a clean crib or manger it implies or infers new no oxen around but when you have a oxen they are variable for plowing for producing crops and everything else in other words you have to balance whether you want the place TIY and clean with new oin or productivity and increase so if you don't have an ox you mean that you are short of the benefits and productivity that the ox provide so when I when the scripture was soaking down I was thinking about it or meditating on it I recognized around progress you find things could be quite messy let me repeat that along the way of progress things could be quite messy and then I want to just go down to something what I call confrontational Christianity confrontational Christianity to confront to confront means to face to meet or deal with a situation especially a difficult or challenging one directly or without avoiding it it can involve addressing a problem issue or person directly and often implies a degree of conflict or disagreement that needs to be resolved or address now the Bible itself is a confrontational book Christianity is a foundational thing that's why John the Baptist spoke to the Scribe and phares he did that is why Jesus spoke to the Scribe and phes way he did you ripped through them he was confrontational he went into the temples he beat out the money changers he did what he had to do now go BR persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life so you don't have to make it a loud noise of stuff that you're going through in this life this supposed to be natural you have days of sunshine you have days of rain sometime you're preparing for the rain you want the rain but when the rain comes mud to comes uh the trees being wet and and overflowing drains and so on it have consequences of all what we need to deal with so I want to establish this here as a line persecution and trial are a natural normal part of the Christian Life and if this have not been a natural part of your life that you have been so blessed that you can't be stressed everything has working out smooth for you you have to look again at your Christianity because this is just part of the package there's only one thing you can do about then yeah we go Saints commit them all to God judge not leave their outworking and final judgment to him instead of putting your mouth and loosing your mouth and saying things that you should not say about what you're going through and why you're going through it why not zip up and commit them to God and leave the outw and fining judgment in him so he continues here thou c not bear them which are evil and thou triy them which say the apostles and are not as found them Liars these Ephesians believed that God's people ought to be holy do you believe that tonight do you really believe that tonight and we supposed to be another Ephesians right these Ephesians believe that God's people ought to be holy according to this verse it took steps to keep the body unle from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church and they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from amongst them they were a separated people they had come out of the world and now they won't going to let the world enter amongst them amongst them each one of us is to protect the church from the world entering in that in that sense they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life and I told a pastor in Miami I said they have to turned down the volume knob on the life they turn that down and they raised the volume on Mysteries Revelations Inspirations knowledge and that is what they raised in the volume on so the volume of life has been turned down you don't have to live anything you just in the message they turn on the Life Volume and raise up the Mysteries histories and knowledge and information how they know more than others but these Ephesians Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or figure speech it was a way of life let let's go D Tri them that say they Apostles and are not but has found them as Liars M that's a blunt statement th trying them who call Apostles so these these Believers were confrontational Believers isn't that a presumption what speaking what right as a people to try those who call themselves Apostles and how do they try them oh I love this here in Galatians 1 18 but though we want angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that that which we have already preached unto you let him be a curse it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people note the word original that original word could not change even a DOT or a dash of it Paul knew it was God's who Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if now this is important even if I come and try to bring a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I give originally let me be a cur you see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised a seed to the woman and then later designated that seed come true Abraham and then later said it could come through the same bloodline in David but it was the same Revelation it only gave more more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed and you see what those false prophets were doing they came with their own word but the clance it's so good that I found it I've been saying it for years and somehow I must have missed this little line here but I keep saying men preaching their own thoughts and sprinkling a little Malachi 14 like pepper sauce or like ketchup on this on this meal that they preparing but they already fixing up their own thing they really bring in their own word those Ephesians knew what word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the lay of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false that sets my heart on fire he says get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the lou and church age and you know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for it is he he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God give it and he won't deviate from it at word one moment not by one iota in the last age then when you will be there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene he truly a prophet he will be crying get back to the when you are lost so you see false anointed bind the people to themselves by fear these false Apostles are the Grievious words that Paul spoke of he said once I am gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but destroy you acts 2037 2732 for I have not shown to declare unto you the whole counil of God and then you talk about uh ws and T to flock speaking perverse things their own word and ideas are not God to show disciples unto themselves all right so already they were denying the word setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word now here we go going to close we all know that the Bible teaches the new birth and they substitute handshakes and everything else for the new birth but it will never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience a born again we all know that anything of a bir is a mess when a baby is born it's whether is on the floor hospital it's a rest now watch he says it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret of the real believing Church born again oh I know you get up from the altar crying and boohoo and squeezing squealing and slobbering but it brings life here what he describe in the message now is just amen hallelujah amen Glory One Clap something he's talking about from the altar crying and boohoo and sing and slobbering but it brings life it takes the starch out of you it makes you something that you ought to be it takes all the world and stiff neck out to you and today we just walk up and say I take Jesus as my personal savior that will never take the place of your new birth and when men and women come to the Altar and forget where they are and who's around them until they really die out here we go and are born again only like meetings and the power of the Holy Ghost get back into the church again that's what we need today a good old St Paul Revival the Bible Holy Ghost I like that Bible Holy Ghost preach back in power yet in Simplicity or preaching the power of the Resurrection almost done all right so Paul said I didn't come with you with wisdom but I come to you with preaching of power when we substitute other things and get classy and starchy and stiff we are losing the very secret our lucks are being Shield what's the matter with Christian church today they try to accept some manufactured way it won't work it try to it you'll kill the patient your baby God's Baby by trying to manufacture some way there's no need yeah so he's dramatizing there's no need of this boohoo and crying there's no need of all this and that there's no need of this dying unless we unless there's a death there can be a birth bir only comes by the substance of death Leisa Corner fall in the ground and die he said and that's the way we must die die to ourselves and be born a new of the Holy Spirit I heard I sure you heard me and hear us talk about di diet if you don't get what that means ask God say say Lord tonight what it is to die to myself this week here Christ Ministry they B hosana hosana hosana next week Easter time they say crucify crucify crucify but he himself knew he came to die to pay that price so I'm closing with this scripture here okay okay now they haven't found a better way for chicken to get out the shell but to Peck it way out he say God provides the instrument for the chicken to free himself in the Bible talk about the kingdom is preacher of a man PR you have to pick out if you say they're stiff as a DA stiff in your own human self you're vexed you're upset you don't like this if get raise a pay or some kind of blessing you feel happy if something get cut from you you feel sad it's just you that's normal human behavior but we are not normal human we have a word to believe a word to receive so Paul said this in this scripture here this from 1 Timothy 6 he says let us as many servants as are under the Yoke Count Their Own Masters worthy of all honor that the name of God and his Doctrine be not be B and they have been and they have had believing Masters let them not despise him because they are Brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloving partakers of the benefit these things teach and exalt If any man Teach otherwise and consent to the wholesome word so God address servants God address Masters it doesn't matter if you are servant or you are Master you it is addressed by the word of God that the doctrine will not BL If any man Teach otherwise so he is saying men will teach but they're supposed to teach according to the wholesome Doctrine If any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness here how Paul described this man that is teaching he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and stri of words whereof commit Envy Strife railings that's the production of that kind of teaching perverse disput of men's of corrupt Minds destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself and look at the balance Paul bring with much of the ox has increase but godliness verse six with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certain we can carry nothing out and having F and reignment let us therefore be there with be content they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lust which dra men in destruction and pedes For the Love of Money not money itself the love of it the love of many is the root of all evil some people love money that's why they have no friends because they don't want to share they don't want to give they and they and the family and circle there and they end up lonely and terrible and have a whole ton of money makes no sense for the love of money is the root of all evil which some coveted after they have heard from the fate and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after what righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness may God bless his word tonight I trust you were helped and you were edified where there's no auction the stable is clean but where there is you have the prodction there's productivity around being productive because this is what the talent is about 10 talents five talents one Talent the man bury it he was cool he didn't study what going on he know it buried already just had to show the Master look where it buried he wasn't productive he didn't increase he say add to your faith virtue and virt knowledge God don't want us to come and say Lord you pick me up so and you meet me so Daddy very daddy want Talent he wants a productive life he want increase into life if we are going to increase stretch aim at accomplish there's going to be rough shavings just like a man theying Furniture whatever business you're doing whatever stuff you're doing spiritual or natural they're going to be mess around you don't let the mess stop you be your best and face the test let's bow our hands almighty God I thank you for your word today these four sayings in this Proverbs Chapter 14 Lord I Thank you for the scripture this scripture truly is a guide the scriptures truly is instructive the scriptures could truly speak to our hearts in every area of Our Lives father as the people get in prayer may they understand that this death is real to die out itself Jesus didn't imagine he was dying he knew he was came to service to die and we too have to die that that word can come alive and manifest it in our hearts we have something to press forward tonight oh God we don't want the coolness of the message yeah in the message 30 40 plus years and dull and numb and can't be move and persuaded anymore we want our hearts to be warm want our hearts to be gentle and have a real heart towards you the question is when last have we cry when last have we wait on us of your goodness and your mercy when last have we have we confessed and repented of our our unfaithfulness our lack of trust in you we say we believe you but we don't express it in terms of trust trusting you for finances trusting you for our bread for our water for our food for our covering trusting you in all things because when we demonstrate trust it shows that we really believe you because you are the leader you are the guide you our strength Lord when we fall back in tears and in in in a depression and frustration as if God is not dead when the world outside saying where is their god father would you appear tonight come in every home and every family touch your sisters touch the brothers touch the

read a scripture for you from Deuteronomy chapter 8 chapter 8 it says this here all the Commandments which I command you this day shall he observe to do that he may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swe unto your father and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in Wilderness to Humble thee and to prove the to know what is in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffer thee to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knowest not thy fathers know that he might make the know that man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God not that man live th Reign man waxs not old upon thee neither thy foot swell these 40 years thou shal also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the Lord thy God Chas thee therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him for the Lord thy God bringe thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water fountains and depths that spring out of Valley and Hills a land of Wheat and B and Vines and fiig trees and pomegranates a land of oil honey oil olive and honey a land where thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose Hills thou May dig brass when thou has eaten and at full then shalt thou bless the Lord thy God for the good land which had given thee beware so this is the qution that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command you this day least when thou eaten and full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy hers and thy flock multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiply and all that thou has is multiply then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible Wilderness wherein with fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and there was no water who brought Beth water out of the rock of Flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manner which their fathers knew not that he might humble thee that he might prove the to the good as the L end and th say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand had gotten me this weth but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto thy Fathers as this thing and if and it shall be if thou do do at all forget the Lord th God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish let us pray heavenly father I bless you for your word and your truth and Lord the prophet said at the at the ending of the seven SE we supposed to know all who God is is me his being all about him and we are still learning you learning what you feel what you want what you desire what is the will for your people and the scripture we just read is is the truth how men after being blessed get puffed up we have seen it over the years from nothing people of nothing and you bless them and they just get with pride and arrogance and attitudes later on in life they humbled you're humbled by what you s because you are God you are
