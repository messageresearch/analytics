[18:41] the real thing here is to come to

[18:47] spirit and in truth see some people they
[18:50] more caught up in religion than than God
[18:54] religion is what make people come to
[18:55] church go back home and live like Devils
[18:58] Rel ReliOn is what make people come to
[19:00] church and then they could cuss the
[19:02] neighbor and they could hate the brother
[19:03] and they could be disrespectful to their
[19:05] husband and they have a bad attitude at
[19:07] home and do anything and just come to
[19:08] church it's a ritual it's a it's a form
[19:12] it's a ceremony you know like how the
[19:13] Greeks will come and do things and this
[19:15] one come and do things and and every
[19:18] religion whether is the Indians in in
[19:20] America whether it's the Greeks whatever
[19:23] culture it is they do stuff whether they
[19:26] light candles whether they burn a
[19:27] feather whether they do or whatever it
[19:29] is I don't know all of it but they do
[19:31] rituals and stuff and they they think
[19:33] they worshiping God and people now
[19:35] worship I call it the god of their own
[19:37] imagination whatever they have in their
[19:39] head what the god is so God is I come to
[19:41] church on a Sunday and I get two hours
[19:43] Hallelujah and Glory go home that's God
[19:45] you worship and you do your own thing is
[19:47] God absent for the rest of the time then

[19:51] is when you come to church and
[19:53] Hallelujah glory amen Shake take one G
[19:55] somebody hands and you shake somebody
[19:56] hands and so on and afterward that God
[19:58] is stoned dead that he is dead that that
[20:00] God you're serving there if that the god
[20:02] you talk about that God is Stone dead
[20:03] but the God we are talking about here
[20:05] he's alive he confirms his word he
[20:08] vindicates his word he declares himself
[20:11] he does Judge he does smite he does
[20:13] rebuke he doesn't give instructions he
[20:16] doesn't care praise God what people
[20:18] think of who he is praise God he decare
[20:20] who he is he like to show himself alive
[20:23] he like to show himself strong he like
[20:25] to show himself as a way maker that's
[20:27] the God we serve is not a god of a
[20:29] imagination or God of who you think he
[20:31] is no he's not a religious God it's a
[20:33] god of the word I am God and God Alone
[20:37] he look to the left there is none else
[20:39] he look to the right there is none else
[20:40] he said beside me there is none else oh

[20:45] that's the God we serve this morning
[20:48] hallelujah hallelujah so we not here
[20:51] come we we haven't come here for
[20:53] religious activity and just to be
[20:54] religious there are too many people are
[20:56] just playing religious and we will call
[20:59] that religious spirit out people living
[21:01] by their Dreams by their feeling and
[21:03] come to me and I seen it so you have
[21:05] seen nothing blind as a bat you have to
[21:08] see what God Said in his word to talk
[21:11] about
[21:12] God hallelujah do you get that now God
[21:15] and the word is one praise the name of
[21:17] the Lord like when David went and take
[21:20] basiba and he wasn't supposed to do that
[21:22] 500 wife he have and he's still gone and
[21:24] and the man her husband get that man to
[21:27] die in in and in in in battle and so on
[21:30] and and the prophet came and take give a
[21:32] little story David you know have a man
[21:34] who had so much of sheep and everything
[21:35] else this man had one sheep and he went
[21:37] and take that man sheep and whatnot
[21:39] David said that man shall
[21:41] die and then the prophecy you shall not
[21:43] die that's the grace of God coming to
[21:46] David you judge you judge you think
[21:49] you're in a position to judge and then
[21:51] it's falling right back on
[21:53] you the same judgment you using God
[21:56] useing back on you and say you are
[21:58] guilty the grace of God came to David
[22:01] you shall not die
[22:02] David but have a butt you know when you
[22:06] mess up with God's law have a butt that
[22:08] goes there yeah your children sing some
[22:12] Solomon you wouldn't see it but your
[22:14] children would see it so sometime when
[22:17] you see somebody lying on the street and
[22:19] somebody in vagrancy or what you don't
[22:21] know what happened back there yeah you
[22:23] feel sorry for them but you don't know
[22:24] what happened back there be careful God
[22:28] is not mocked what a man so he's going
[22:32] to reap it's better you never known the
[22:34] Lord than to play games with God because
[22:37] God a playing games nothing in this
[22:38] season here oh praise so we have some
[22:40] praises and prayer requests we'll take
[22:41] right after the service but this coming
[22:45] Saturday um would be our youth service
[22:48] at 5:00 try not to miss it and um by the
[22:52] grace of God
[22:54] Amen uh Stephen just play that song
[22:56] again fil me now fil me now just play
[22:58] this we want to switch to the word we
[23:01] want to welcome each and one of you here
[23:03] this morning and I pray that this
[23:05] morning service would be a help and
[23:07] blessing to
[23:09] you we preached something on Wednesday
[23:11] night very strange Heritage of the
[23:13] servant of the Lord and I didn't
[23:15] understand how I could get that why I
[23:17] would get that but now I know this
[23:19] morning and you would see from the word
[23:21] this morning amen praise the Lord
[23:25] [Music]
[23:32] now we were born in sin shape iniquity
[23:36] but God is not leaving us to remain in
[23:41] sin
[23:43] um when we receive Jesus and receive the
[23:48] applied blood to our hearts it means
[23:50] that God is working on us he's not
[23:53] finished but he's working on us and the
[23:56] Bible speak about he that began a good
[23:58] work is able to complete it am so it
[24:01] cannot be he's beginning a good work and
[24:04] you remain in sinner you have to come
[24:06] out of sin that he could continue the
[24:08] work inside of you he call you out not
[24:11] for you to remain stink and filthy and
[24:13] rotten in your own self but he call you
[24:16] out that something can happen on the
[24:17] inside now we not talking about you stop
[24:19] doing this and stop doing that you could
[24:20] stop whatever you want to stop that is
[24:22] you but when something happens within
[24:25] the desire changes this is what we
[24:27] talking about
[24:28] this is the operation of God where you
[24:31] as a human as a normal human being know
[24:34] this is a little more than you it's not
[24:35] you trying and failing and falling and
[24:38] getting back up this is something
[24:39] happening on the inside of you that
[24:42] changes your disposition changes your
[24:44] attitude that others could see a change
[24:48] in you amen not around you but in you
[24:51] and this is what you come here for
[24:53] tonight to ask God to fill you with his
[24:55] Spirit fill you with his presence fill
[24:58] you with his power just think his Spirit
[25:00] filling you means you'll be a better
[25:02] husband you'll be a better wife you'll
[25:05] be a better parent you'll a better son a
[25:08] better daughter a better person a better
[25:10] citizen of the country because now you
[25:12] are empowered with his Spirit outside of
[25:15] that you're just like any other Thug or
[25:18] any other person out there just going to
[25:19] church and going think about it this
[25:21] morning there are thousands of people
[25:22] going to the Catholic Church thousand
[25:23] going to the Pentecostal Church thousand
[25:25] going to all different churches but are
[25:26] they being changed are they being been
[25:28] transformed so you have to think for
[25:30] yourself what you come here for this
[25:32] morning oh glory to God I want you to
[25:34] think praise God we not here to study
[25:36] what dress you have on what tie you're
[25:37] wearing that is irrelevant what we he
[25:40] what we here to do is to see that you
[25:41] could apply the blood and apply what
[25:43] Jesus the price he paid to your life
[25:46] that something could happen on the
[25:47] inside of you that you could leave him
[25:49] more assured more full of Peace more
[25:52] full of his grace more full of his
[25:54] presence more full of his power oh give
[25:56] the Lord a shout in the meeting on
[25:58] Friday that exaltation from from Joseph
[26:01] being kicked out and betrayed by his
[26:03] brother to become the right hand of
[26:05] pharaoh there's a cost for promotion
[26:07] some people get promoted and they get
[26:08] demoted afterwards because they can't
[26:10] handle the promotion oh give the Lord
[26:12] some Praises you have to be ready for
[26:14] God to take you to the next step you
[26:16] have to prepare yourself to be taken to
[26:18] the next level if you want to remain as
[26:20] you are as a parent and stay stuck in
[26:23] your thinking mode and don't be uh
[26:26] looking for something higher you will
[26:27] stay Just As You Are
[26:29] Oh Glory to God till your children
[26:30] become more mature than you because
[26:32] you're not growing in knowledge you're
[26:33] not growing in information you're not
[26:34] growing in wisdom and understanding and

[31:07] encounter people who don't want to
[31:08] change that might sound crazy but we
[31:11] have we have dealt with that people who
[31:14] like how they are they feel they on
[31:17] Satan deceives them in the gay matter
[31:20] and in the
[31:22] mouth because when you see you for who
[31:25] you are you have to you're frightened
[31:30] the heart is desperately wicked you're
[31:32] not nice that's only in your head you're
[31:36] not good there's none good but God
[31:38] you're not
[31:40] own whatever you have have no currency
[31:42] in heaven if I take Trinidad money and
[31:45] go to America who wants that I could go
[31:47] with $60,000 TT $100,000 a million
[31:50] dollar and say this is money do would
[31:53] laugh I as well bur that it has no value
[31:56] de you have to convert that to US
[31:58] dollars so all your house land car
[32:01] andbody you look at your car what not
[32:02] you have no value
[32:04] dear you can have three story four story
[32:07] a swim pool on the top story it have no

[32:12] of this tick you of this tick he was
[32:14] poor now he Rich tick have not taken all
[32:16] them
[32:17] ticks oh give the Lord a praise and if
[32:21] you catch that you'll free yourself from
[32:23] what man thinks you would free yourself
[32:26] from the opinion of others you would
[32:28] free yourself because a man life does
[32:30] not consist about the abundance of
[32:32] things that a man
[32:33] [Applause]
[32:34] possesses why you saying I'm over
[32:37] because that have to do with pride and
[32:39] pride have to do with lack of humility
[32:41] and if you have to get from God you have
[32:43] to humble yourself okay the Lord some
[32:48] praises and unless you're prepared to
[32:50] Humble you mess up you can't get nowhere
[32:54] because he that humble himself shall be
[32:56] exalted oh give the Lord I shout and God
[32:59] is looking for someone this morning that
[33:01] the more He blesses is the more humble
[33:04] he
[33:07] becomes why let me wrap this up here now
[33:11] why why because usually when we get
[33:13] stuff we get
[33:15] proud when you look deeper in the
[33:17] scriptures time and
[33:18] chance happen to all
[33:21] men a man living in a country and a man
[33:23] living in a city two different
[33:24] opportunities amen country man is harder
[33:28] yeah that's where they're located
[33:30] sometime I was going up talk over to my
[33:32] wife and understand Mar how much car
[33:35] coming
[33:37] none I said look look how much traffic
[33:39] up here
[33:42] none maybe one car pass direction and
[33:44] you look back
[33:47] none why Country go in city now you
[33:52] can't
[33:53] move because in the city and so are some
[33:58] experiences your experience might be
[34:00] country and next experience in the city
[34:03] there two different things time and
[34:05] chance happen to all men so because of
[34:07] where you are and what God provide and
[34:09] make a way and door you get blessed and
[34:12] but what I realize all the blessings all
[34:15] what God give you is to serve him
[34:17] [Applause]
[34:23] better that is not for you to parade
[34:25] your beef and show off all what God give
[34:29] you and bless you is to serve him
[34:32] better so let's sing this s and sing

[35:43] 6- 7 and St John 20
[35:49] 2122 reading from St John 14 verse
[35:53] 12 very verily I say unto you he that
[35:58] believeth on me the works that I do
[35:59] shall do also and Greater Works than the
[36:02] shall he do because I go unto my
[36:08] father and whatsoever you shall ask in
[36:10] my name that will I do that the father
[36:13] may be glorified in the son if you shall
[36:15] ask anything in my name I will do it if
[36:18] you love me keep my Commandments and I
[36:19] will pray the father he shall give you
[36:22] another
[36:24] comforter that that he may abide with
[36:26] you forever
[36:28] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[36:30] can't receive because it sees him not NE
[36:32] an know
[36:35] him but he know him for he dwelleth with
[36:38] you and shall be in you I would not
[36:40] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[36:43] yet a little while and the world seeth
[36:45] me no more but ye see me because I live
[36:47] he shall live also and that day he shall
[36:49] know that I'm in the father he in me I
[36:51] knew he that had my commandment and
[36:54] keepeth them he is that loveth me and he
[36:57] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[36:58] father and I would love him I will
[37:01] manifest myself to him Judah said unto
[37:04] him not es scariot Lord how is it that
[37:06] thou will manifest thyself unto us and
[37:08] not unto the world Jesus answered and
[37:10] said unto him if a man love me he will
[37:12] keep my words and my father will love
[37:14] him and we will come unto him and make
[37:17] our board with him he that loveth me not
[37:20] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[37:22] which he hear is not mine but the
[37:25] father's which sent me these things
[37:27] things have I spoken unto you being yet
[37:29] present with you but the comforter which
[37:32] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[37:35] send in my name he shall teach you all
[37:38] things and bring all things to
[37:40] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[37:42] you St John chapter 16 to veres there 6
[37:45] and 7 Jesus speaking to the disciples
[37:49] he's telling them he's going to die and
[37:50] everything else and so like that right
[37:52] and Jesus words he said but because I
[37:54] have said these things unto you sorrow
[37:58] had filled your
[37:59] heart nevertheless I tell you the truth
[38:03] in other words even though it's bad news
[38:05] from a human standpoint this is the
[38:07] truth it is expedient for you that I go
[38:11] away for if I go not away the comforter
[38:14] will not come unto you but if I
[38:18] depart I will send him unto you he
[38:21] promis to send him unto you and verse 21
[38:26] of St John ch
[38:28] 20 then said Jesus unto them so this is
[38:31] the resurrection peace be unto you as my
[38:34] father had sent me so send I you and
[38:38] when he said this he breathed on them
[38:41] and sayth unto them receive ye the Holy
[38:43] Ghost let's pray father we thank you may
[38:45] you bless this word today and confirm it
[38:47] with your point of your spirit with
[38:49] signs wonders and miracles I ask in
[38:51] Jesus name amen you may be seated oh
[38:53] praise the Lord amen so a title he shall
[38:58] give you another
[38:59] comforter I have an inspiration
[39:02] receiveing the Holy
[39:04] Ghost
[39:06] amen Oh Glory
[39:09] Hallelujah so Wednesday night the
[39:11] heritage of the Servants of the Lord and
[39:14] God himself said he will bring that
[39:16] justification of
[39:18] righteousness this not impersonator
[39:20] something like that this is Servants of
[39:22] God all right now we have a great
[39:24] heritage a great sacred trust that's giv
[39:27] to us and you know we have a sacred
[39:29] trust you know what that trust is we
[39:31] have an inheritance a Heritage that we
[39:34] inherit as believing children so once
[39:36] you start to believe and come into God's
[39:38] plan and program automatically God gives
[39:40] you inheritance you know inheritance
[39:42] like somebody give you land house give
[39:45] you stuff and things like that not that
[39:46] you deserve it you know he did that for
[39:49] you you just have to accept it you can't
[39:52] work for this thing you know it's the
[39:53] grace of God right he said there
[39:55] therefore there's the reason I'm so
[39:56] dogmatic I would call it on standing on
[39:59] this word no matter what anything else
[40:01] says if it's not with the word I don't
[40:02] believe it if you want to believe it
[40:04] it's all right but to me it takes the
[40:06] word he said Heavenly will pass away but
[40:08] my word will never fail I live by the
[40:11] word because man shall a bread alone but
[40:13] by every word you see when you begin to
[40:16] understand that by Revelation that God
[40:18] is the word and the word is God you want
[40:20] to stay with that word now you have your
[40:22] own feelings you have your own emotions
[40:25] you have your own choices and whatnot
[40:26] and God allows that and God will not
[40:29] override that did you get that God will
[40:33] not override your
[40:34] will that's why Jesus asked a question
[40:37] will you be made whole I got Force
[40:40] Holiness on you you have to want it if
[40:42] you don't want it it would not be
[40:44] applied to you you you God will not
[40:46] override your will because like Adam God
[40:49] can't force Adam not to eat the tree he
[40:51] said eat everything he give man free
[40:54] will the choice is always you yours
[40:57] because thou has chosen you chose the
[41:00] right path or you chose the wrong path
[41:02] you chose the right friends or you chose
[41:04] the the amen the wrong friends you chose
[41:07] to delete people from your from your
[41:09] from from your phone book because they
[41:12] are bad for
[41:15] you it's not even worth having the phone
[41:17] number in in your phone delete them
[41:21] block them cut them off because they're
[41:23] not good for you they are bad influence
[41:26] they they playing to be friends but it's
[41:29] Lucifer putting on a friend
[41:33] mask don't say Amen now it's still true
[41:36] sometime it's family Lucifer you know
[41:38] that's why it's friend or no friend
[41:41] family or no family he said I come to
[41:44] being assured mother against daughter
[41:46] father against son I'm being assured for
[41:48] what the

[48:12] [Applause]
[48:17] Hall God help me God help you as
[48:21] Christians never compromise one word of
[48:23] God the sacred trust that was handed to
[48:27] the church to preach this gospel without
[48:30] compromising and if we ever expect this
[48:32] word to ever come to pass if we ever
[48:34] expect God to keep his word we have got
[48:36] to stay with it just the way God wrote
[48:38] it that's the reason if you stay with it
[48:41] the way God wrote it there'll be all
[48:43] kind of things happening among you every
[48:45] word will be fulfilled we want people
[48:47] hungry for the word to be manifest
[48:50] Hallelujah tell your son about it tell
[48:52] your husband about it tell your neighbor
[48:54] about it anybody come in contact you

[48:58] promised a Revival God promised a Holy
[49:00] Ghost Church God promised a listen God
[49:02] never promised a defeated church God
[49:05] never promise a church that can't cast
[49:06] Devils out come on God promise a
[49:08] glorious Church
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:18] Without we lost our heritage when we
[49:24] compromise then we cannot expect God to
[49:26] keep his PR promise to us because we
[49:28] have broke upon the SEC trust we talk
[49:30] about it in Friday Jacob Jacob was a
[49:32] compromiser um a SC man a trickster he
[49:35] tricking mother anybody trick if you
[49:37] stay too long but he trick you
[49:40] too that's Jacob but God said Jacob I
[49:43] love what did God see in that man if you
[49:47] look at that man he's a terrible guy you
[49:49] don't want know you don't want to write
[49:50] him and don't be friends with him but
[49:52] God said that man I love that man why
[49:54] what God seeing he's saying what is
[49:56] going to become he seen Jacob being
[49:59] turned to Israel you don't see that
[50:02] you've seen Jacob you've seen his Rascal
[50:04] ways but you don't see he is on a
[50:07] trajectory for transformation he's on a
[50:10] trajectory for promotion he's a he's on
[50:14] a trajectory to be transitioning from
[50:16] that life to a new life and when he
[50:19] wrestling overcome God said the angel
[50:22] said your name shall no longer be called
[50:24] Jacob your name going to be called
[50:26] Israel and out of that we get the 12 Tri
[50:28] of Israel out of that we have a nation
[50:30] called Israel why because a man chose
[50:33] not to stay as he is he could say I rich
[50:36] I money I don't to care about what he to
[50:38] say no he said Lord I'm
[50:40] frightened and he's wealthy but he's
[50:44] afraid I'm scared and guess what when
[50:47] God finished with him and he meet his
[50:49] brother no
[50:50] fear they hug and wept in other words he
[50:54] was reconciled back to Esau
[50:56] the man he thought was going to kill him
[50:58] and do all kind of wickedness to him he
[51:00] found favor in his eyes and all Esau
[51:02] could do is wept and ask him about his
[51:03] children and his family and everything
[51:05] else oh give the Lord some

[57:04] somewhere I can speak on those plagues
[57:06] and things that is to fall in the last
[57:09] days and the bums and so on I'll skip
[57:12] that so
[57:14] Jesus
[57:16] knew that when he goes his disciples
[57:19] would be in sorrow there will be grief
[57:22] there will be
[57:25] despair he worked with them took them
[57:28] from fish fish as fishermen and so like
[57:30] that they saw Miracles they saw Lazarus
[57:32] he from the dead they saw the bread and
[57:34] fish multiplied and everything like that
[57:37] and he was a comfort to them they know
[57:40] if anybody sick called Jesus is a storm
[57:44] raging the the winds were contrary
[57:46] called Jesus Jesus CM the storm so they
[57:49] know now he's telling them he's going
[57:51] now he's going and he give them this
[57:54] promise of another comfort
[57:57] because he was a comforter being with
[58:00] them he was the word yet with flesh on
[58:05] it he was the word made
[58:09] flesh Noah and these other brothers just
[58:11] had the word now God promised God
[58:13] promised God promised hold to it Abraham
[58:15] held to the promise of Isaac and Noah
[58:17] held to the promise of rain and the Word
[58:19] was a comforter them even though he
[58:21] never saw rain before he's building the
[58:22] ark but he have God's word as a comfort
[58:25] to him but then all the word that they
[58:27] had now became flesh and this person
[58:29] called Jesus Christ the word became

[58:44] she was made whole the word was made
[58:46] flesh there was healing coming out of
[58:48] there there was virtue coming out of
[58:50] there there was power coming out of

[1:06:52] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:06:54] in me he doth the works
[1:06:56] St John 14:10 here it is most evidently
[1:06:59] set forth that the perfect manifestation
[1:07:01] of God in the sun was by the indwelling
[1:07:05] spirit manifested in word and works that
[1:07:10] is exactly what we have been teaching
[1:07:12] all along when the bride will get back
[1:07:17] to being a word bride she will produce
[1:07:20] the very works that Jesus
[1:07:23] produced so a lot of word people talking
[1:07:25] about is just talk because the prophecy
[1:07:28] is when the Bride Comes Back To Be A
[1:07:31] word bride she will produce the very
[1:07:33] works that Jesus produced the word is
[1:07:37] God the spirit is God they are all one
[1:07:41] one cannot work apart from the other if
[1:07:44] one truly has the spirit of God he will
[1:07:47] have the word of God that is how it was
[1:07:50] with the prophets they had the
[1:07:51] indwelling spirit of God and the word
[1:07:54] came to them that is how it was with
[1:07:56] Jesus in him was the spirit without
[1:08:00] measure and the word came to him Jesus
[1:08:03] both began to teach and my Doctrine is
[1:08:06] not my own but the father that sent me
[1:08:09] now remember that John the Baptist was
[1:08:11] born was both the prophet and the
[1:08:13] messenger of his day he was filled with
[1:08:15] the holy ghost from his mother's womb
[1:08:17] when he was baptizing in Jordan the word
[1:08:19] of Jesus came to him the word here we go
[1:08:23] always comes to the truly Spirit fill
[1:08:26] Oh Glory to God so the word is
[1:08:29] connecting to the spirit fill that is
[1:08:32] the evidence of being filled with the
[1:08:34] Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would
[1:08:36] be the evidence I will pray the father
[1:08:38] he will send you another comforter that
[1:08:41] he may abide with you forever even the
[1:08:42] spirit of Truth whom the world can't
[1:08:45] receive now we know what the truth is
[1:08:47] Thy word is truth isn't that right he
[1:08:50] said in John 8:43 why do you not
[1:08:53] understand my speech even because you
[1:08:55] cannot hear my word did you notice that
[1:08:58] Jesus said the world could not receive
[1:09:01] the Holy Ghost well in that verse
[1:09:03] neither could they receive the
[1:09:05] word Oh Glory to God so you sit here
[1:09:09] note all of Israel was hearing Moses but
[1:09:12] the Bible said all of them didn't mix
[1:09:14] the word with faith only Joshua and
[1:09:16] Caleb had the faith to hold the word do
[1:09:18] you get it now so you could sit here and
[1:09:21] this is like like somebody say by cast
[1:09:23] it on here for two hours right
[1:09:28] they could say 2 hours in a wedding they
[1:09:30] could stay 2 hours in a reception
[1:09:31] waiting for food that's staying long
[1:09:32] long long to
[1:09:33] come they could go somewhere else and
[1:09:35] stay 2 hours but for church ity ity ity
[1:09:44] ity sometime when he would come in hot
[1:09:47] so Daddy get up and take a walk in
[1:09:50] because they a ready for that yet but
[1:09:52] you have to take the word and when you
[1:09:55] take the word you begin to apply it even
[1:09:57] though you're not living it yet this is
[1:09:59] what God said I want this for
[1:10:02] [Applause]
[1:10:06] me you think I was always this patient I
[1:10:09] was one of the most impatient person you
[1:10:11] could think
[1:10:13] about very very low tolerance I learned
[1:10:16] this you know I grow into
[1:10:19] this you would like to see me in my
[1:10:21] younger
[1:10:23] form somebody to call me speedon
[1:10:29] house I a
[1:10:32] PA man going one two one two when I come
[1:10:37] what going
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:41] on I couldn't understand that slow
[1:10:43] place so I had a nickname speed
[1:10:47] Gonzales so watch this now but the
[1:10:50] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:10:53] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:10:55] teach you all things and bring things to
[1:10:58] remembrance whichever I read unto you
[1:10:59] right okay I want you to note carefully
[1:11:03] that Jesus did not say the evidence of
[1:11:05] being baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[1:11:06] speaking in tongues interpreting and
[1:11:08] shouting and dancing he said the
[1:11:09] evidence were that you would be in the
[1:11:11] truth you would be in the word of God
[1:11:13] for the age evidence has to do with
[1:11:15] receiving the word now some people take
[1:11:18] this and say interpret this mean they
[1:11:20] don't have to have an experience that is
[1:11:22] not true but the evidence of having the
[1:11:24] Holy Ghost is being ble to receive the
[1:11:27] word so if any man think himself to be a
[1:11:30] prophet Paul said let him acknowledge
[1:11:32] that the things that I write unto you
[1:11:33] are the Commandments of the Lord you see
[1:11:35] that the proof of the indwelling spirit
[1:11:38] was to acknowledge and follow what God's
[1:11:40] Prophet give for this age as he set the
[1:11:42] church in order amen praise the Lord so
[1:11:45] the evidence of a spiritual Christian
[1:11:47] believer is not to produce the truth
[1:11:50] word but to receive the truth word and
[1:11:52] to believe it and Obey it the prophet
[1:11:55] said now they're not interested in
[1:11:57] living it but arguing it the only weapon
[1:11:59] they have is argument that that is not
[1:12:01] the bride the bride is interested in
[1:12:03] living it because she will become the
[1:12:05] final voice to the final age do you get
[1:12:08] that now oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:11] so watch the body of Christ is one
[1:12:13] Spirit where every member from Pentecost
[1:12:16] to this time drink from the same new
[1:12:18] wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth
[1:12:20] the same results how do we do it by one
[1:12:23] Spirit it is God's Open Door the Holy
[1:12:25] Spirit what is it it is God's open door
[1:12:28] it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter
[1:12:32] it's an advocate it's an assurance it's
[1:12:35] a rest it is peace it is goodness it is
[1:12:38] healing it is life it is God's open door
[1:12:42] to all these things oh praise the name
[1:12:44] of the Lord that's the Holy Spirit it is
[1:12:46] peace it is life it is God's open door
[1:12:49] you don't have to go and go in a cinema
[1:12:51] to get a relief because you're uptight
[1:12:53] no he is peace he's a strong
[1:12:55] he is God's open door that is the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost isn't that right hallelujah
[1:13:00] hallelujah glory to God notice Paul
[1:13:03] being a Bible teacher that's what we
[1:13:04] learned that he sat under a great
[1:13:06] teacher one of the greatest of his days
[1:13:08] gel and he was well vered in the Old
[1:13:10] Testament he knew it well he become a
[1:13:13] persecutor on the way that was Christ's
[1:13:14] way because he had been trained in the
[1:13:16] Old Testament under teachers but the
[1:13:20] teachers usually a
[1:13:23] caral I hope hope I don't say anything
[1:13:25] wrong he's still reading but usually if
[1:13:29] a man just the teaching the way of the
[1:13:31] schools is usually man-made see it isn't
[1:13:36] inspired because it becomes a doctrine
[1:13:39] of a
[1:13:40] school but in the Old Testament Paul
[1:13:43] being well trained knew the scriptures
[1:13:45] by the word but you see here we go the
[1:13:48] scriptures no matter how well you know
[1:13:50] them if the spirit doesn't Quicken them
[1:13:54] then letter kill
[1:13:57] it or the Mysteries teaching kill it
[1:14:01] there a big
[1:14:03] one this the letter kill it the spirit
[1:14:07] giveth life see it must be quickened or
[1:14:11] made life by the spirit and if the
[1:14:14] spirit doesn't lifen the word and make
[1:14:16] it a reality to you then the letter is
[1:14:18] just
[1:14:19] intellectual so this thing had to hit
[1:14:21] you oh glory to when it hit you so yeah
[1:14:24] look at the right note you're looking to
[1:14:25] get up and Hallelujah glory to God hey

[1:38:58] haven't listened to it go back and
[1:38:59] listen to it this is what God sees the
[1:39:03] righteousness of Faith because really
[1:39:06] and truly it is his faith in you and he
[1:39:11] is counting that faith for
[1:39:15] righteousness that has nothing to do
[1:39:17] with what you do or you don't do oh give
[1:39:19] the Lord some praises and he is
[1:39:22] attributing to your Faith which is his
[1:39:24] faith in you as righteousness to justify

[1:46:50] rest of them was going to Bow knee to
[1:46:52] him this Vision told him so isn't that
[1:46:54] right Hallelujah notice before he come
[1:46:56] out he had to be taken out and shaved a
[1:46:59] few had to be shaved off before he can
[1:47:00] meet the king and God sometimes take his
[1:47:03] people like that and shave here we go a
[1:47:06] few of their own Wills
[1:47:11] off because you feel you're a boss and
[1:47:14] because you get away all these years
[1:47:16] with having your own way you figure you

[1:47:55] and be a love slave to Christ they had
[1:47:58] to be shaved off and then
[1:48:01] presented sometimes he takes them to the
[1:48:03] desert to do that to shave them off and
[1:48:07] then bring them out the anointed one to
[1:48:11] fulfill the purpose that he's ordained

[2:03:28] church turn him back by showing you the
[2:03:32] nature of man they want Power they want
[2:03:35] to be on display they want to impress
[2:03:37] Brethren they want to impress the
[2:03:39] neighbor they want to say I have you
[2:03:42] don't God nothing in
[2:03:44] that they want to boast God nothing in

[2:03:49] and His glory no man and getting his
[2:03:52] glory oh give the Lord some Praises let
[2:03:54] me finish W here that Big Stone come by
[2:03:58] and pick up all the magnet Stone and
[2:03:59] pick it all up because it was the
[2:04:00] magneti it we have got to be magnetized
[2:04:03] to The Headstone that headstone is the
[2:04:05] Holy Ghost headstone is what ghost and
[2:04:08] every one of us that got the magism
[2:04:09] magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that
[2:04:11] stone strike the image jel Fleet to it
[2:04:14] now when Christ died there was three
[2:04:16] elements come out of his body water
[2:04:17] blood spirit justification believing
[2:04:20] water sanctification through through the
[2:04:21] blood then the baptism of Holy Spirit
[2:04:23] now this last great step talking about
[2:04:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost must come
[2:04:29] into Perfection and he went deeper that
[2:04:32] the Holy Spirit has to live in that
[2:04:34] church so perfectly this have do with
[2:04:36] teaching and explanation and Mysteries
[2:04:38] Holy Spirit have to live in so perfectly
[2:04:40] it will make the head and body unit
[2:04:41] together so there's only four steps
[2:04:43] Luther Wesley Pentecostal and Joseph
[2:04:46] Joseph is the last step which is that
[2:04:49] Perfection that's what this message is
[2:04:50] this message that of perfection to take
[2:04:53] the bride home so that last great step
[2:04:56] has come to Perfection so luu preach
[2:04:58] justification and the people got in the
[2:05:00] atmosphere of justification and was
[2:05:02] justified Wesley preached sanctification
[2:05:05] the people got in the atmosphere of
[2:05:06] sanctification and they were Sanctified
[2:05:08] the Pentecostal brought the gifts and
[2:05:10] the baptism and they got in the spirit
[2:05:12] and they got filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:05:14] what about us our word isn't that right
[2:05:18] to a
[2:05:19] Perfection this word for the bride
[2:05:22] the Holy Ghost itself hear this prophecy
[2:05:25] now as Daniel heard the seven tunders
[2:05:28] and forbidden John heard the voices the
[2:05:30] book was sealed in other words the
[2:05:32] mystery of God will be finished in other
[2:05:34] words God would be known to his church
[2:05:38] not in three people but in one person
[2:05:41] the mystery of God will be revealed here
[2:05:43] we go and when that was completely
[2:05:46] reveal then the seven Mysteries would
[2:05:48] open to the church and those seven
[2:05:50] Mysteries what the seven Thunders right
[2:05:52] because India the church will be living
[2:05:56] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:59] no Debt Service no intellectual
[2:06:02] gymnastics living under the inspiration
[2:06:05] when it's fully revealed him moving in
[2:06:08] and out showing his signs among us
[2:06:11] living among us and then we are
[2:06:14] worshiping the living Christ that is
[2:06:17] among us then you could say we know who
[2:06:20] we worship know what we worship oh give
[2:06:23] the Lord a shout in their house
[2:06:26] Hallelujah he told Daniel and John that
[2:06:29] in the last days these seven voices
[2:06:32] would be known by the real true church
[2:06:35] time shall be no more he announces that
[2:06:37] time is over what happens could that be
[2:06:39] so now Brethren seriously think if it is
[2:06:42] then the pyramid is kept by the seven
[2:06:44] Thunders therefore the pyramid kept by
[2:06:46] the seven Thunders and the Thunders is
[2:06:48] the Capstone and the Capstone is the
[2:06:50] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost Oh Glory
[2:06:52] to God Jo the Perfection that word
[2:06:54] inside of you God going to turn that
[2:06:57] word into power and the kingdom of God
[2:07:00] is within you when the Capstone word
[2:07:02] jully Perfection SE in you turns into
[2:07:06] Power you become a
[2:07:08] Powerhouse Oh Glory to God seriously
[2:07:12] think if it is then the peryer is kept
[2:07:15] by the seven tenders you remember the
[2:07:17] pyramid message it is the Capstone I'm
[2:07:19] going to go oh let me finish
[2:07:23] on page 15 mus get ready to come
[2:07:25] up Noah met God he heard God he had
[2:07:30] God's word didn't make a difference
[2:07:32] anyone said Noah had God's word it was a
[2:07:35] comfort to him when the critics come and
[2:07:37] criticize him how waterfall science test
[2:07:39] him no I forget them he had a comfort
[2:07:43] God's word isn't that right job he had a
[2:07:47] comfort the word God said as long as you
[2:07:49] offering a burnt offering you are fine
[2:07:52] so then his friends come and say a
[2:07:54] secret sinner he said but I offer I
[2:07:56] offer for my children he offer advented
[2:07:58] the sin to had a comfort the word of God
[2:08:02] but then one day one day this word all
[2:08:06] them follow the word each one of them
[2:08:08] was following God's word which was a
[2:08:09] comfort the word itself is a comfort
[2:08:12] because the word is a promise and once
[2:08:14] you have a promise you have a comfort if
[2:08:16] God say he's going to heal you there's a
[2:08:17] word there's a promise you a healed yet
[2:08:20] the manifestation a yet but God gave you
[2:08:22] a word that's a comfort to you Doctor
[2:08:25] say he gave you three more days to live
[2:08:26] that a lie because God gave you a word I
[2:08:29] shall not die but live God gave you a
[2:08:32] comfort you're holding on to God you
[2:08:34] can't hold on to the doctor doctor is
[2:08:35] limited by his eyes and his technology
[2:08:37] and all these equipment but God is God
[2:08:40] isn't that right so watch each one of
[2:08:43] them followed God's word but one day
[2:08:46] that word became flesh that word was
[2:08:48] made flesh in the form of a man the word
[2:08:50] of God that brought come from Was Made A
[2:08:52] man among us we could handle the word of
[2:08:54] God in our hands we could shake hands
[2:08:57] with the word of God he was the word in
[2:09:00] the beginning was the word the word was
[2:09:02] with God the Word was God and the Word
[2:09:04] was made flesh and dwell Among Us that
[2:09:07] word of God was made flesh the comforter
[2:09:09] Oh Glory to God so this word that was
[2:09:11] comforting all these prophets that word
[2:09:15] became a comforter when the word become
[2:09:17] flesh Oh Glory to God hallelujah are you
[2:09:21] with me that's why Jesus tell him I will
[2:09:24] send you another comforter because he
[2:09:27] knew that he was a comforter but this
[2:09:30] time was another comforter oh give the
[2:09:32] Lord a shout in the house hallelujah
[2:09:35] hallelujah glory to God he a little
[2:09:38] while the world seeth me no more but you
[2:09:41] are going to see me I'm going to die at
[2:09:44] the hands of sinful men and the hearts
[2:09:46] were broken they were depressed they
[2:09:48] were in Gloom but he made a promise I
[2:09:51] will not leave you comfortless I will
[2:09:53] not leave you comfortless I will pray
[2:09:55] the father he will send you another
[2:09:57] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[2:10:00] will abide with you forever even the
[2:10:02] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[2:10:04] receive but you know him you know him
[2:10:08] for he is with you and shall be in you
[2:10:11] oh give the Lord some Praises I feel the
[2:10:13] anointing here now then what is the word
[2:10:16] of God what is our comfort today it is
[2:10:19] when we receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:10:22] Ghost and the power of God living among
[2:10:24] us that is when the word of God is
[2:10:27] living word made flesh Among Us he is
[2:10:30] with you now but he shall be in you now
[2:10:33] that same word that the prophet spoke
[2:10:36] that same word I Was Made flesh that
[2:10:38] same word dwells in the church therefore
[2:10:40] if we don't compromise with the word and
[2:10:42] we stay right with it if we don't
[2:10:44] compromise it that same word living in
[2:10:46] you will produce the same thing he did
[2:10:49] that's the reason Visions can break to
[2:10:51] the song barrier that's the reason
[2:10:53] Vision can break through time barrier
[2:10:55] and say thus sayth the Lord It's the
[2:10:58] word coming forth from a spirit and the
[2:11:01] promise I'll be with you the comforter
[2:11:03] I'll send you the comforter and they
[2:11:05] gather in the upper room and they waited
[2:11:07] there until the day of Pentecost and
[2:11:10] when the Holy Ghost came it did exactly
[2:11:12] what the word said it will do prophecy
[2:11:14] are you ready and when it comes
[2:11:17] again when it comes again when it comes
[2:11:21] again and when it moves into a church
[2:11:25] that's born again it will come with the
[2:11:27] power and the demonstration of his being
[2:11:31] God's word a comforter in us bringing
[2:11:34] forth exactly the same thing begin to
[2:11:37] play something I'm done if we expect God
[2:11:40] to keep his word if we expect God to do
[2:11:42] the things for us that we are asking we
[2:11:45] will never be able to do it till we get
[2:11:48] back and Obey what God has said do we
[2:11:51] have got to go back where we left off at
[2:11:54] we have got to go back to Pentecost we
[2:11:56] have got to go back to the comforter we
[2:11:59] have got to go back to the Holy Spirit
[2:12:01] which is our comfort and when the Holy
[2:12:03] Spirit come it will not deny any word
