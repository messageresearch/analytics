requests when I bring for the Lord tonight our title a prisoner of Jesus Christ that's the title tonight prison of Jesus Christ brother Branham preached a message called a prisoner and he was praying and he was seeing this year he again a name of the Lord Jesus and to hear the great mighty works you've done before and now we stand with anticipation raises our feet and anoint us to believe and what I've been asked for tonight will be granted don't know it each and every one of them all that have requested and we pray for them especially Lord those who are near dead bring peace to their soul it

believing that the time is near when you went to raise up the windows of heaven and pour all the promises of God has promised in this last day now we ask Lord to be with us around the nation as we heard so many are wrong everywhere that's the Nene that grant their request forgive us of our sin chaste nurse Lord with thy spirit and thy word that we might discipline ourselves obedient servants obedient servants in the will of God let us remember and try to think in our hearts what the early Christians done what type of people would we meet if we met those who are personally been in contact with you how their faces might have lift up with feet and joy Oh their lives must have been living the Word of God just written epistles read of all men granted once more may our lives be so submitted to Z that the Holy Spirit will live itself true us and speak true us Lord may we remember in our minds as we walk along the street and rob arms of the world we are not supposed to be like those and we step aside and give them the police lord their rightful position on earth we take the backseat knowing we are delegates from another world we have a kingdom that is coming into power Lord and our great king will soon arrive and take over all the king that domine and he shall rule and reign with him here a thousand years forever but this in mind now we look forward to the answer for prayer we look to a confession if we have did anything sella meeting toward anything I was contrary to your great will let the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses lead us Lord as sister said tonight about unsworn by degrees and Lord nor we commit the service to you and the listening for your word of correction and we might know how to prepare for this great hour in Jesus name we ask what a prayer tonight Amen oh praise the name of the Lord and the script reread Paul wrote his letter to Philemon he was sitting in jail in a dungeon and a prison of the prisoner and Paul was not dressed in his physical condition even though he was physically in a prison he called himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ he actually eliminated the concept of what was wrong him as that ready hole in him and an identifying a greater power was holding him the Lord Jesus himself but the Prophet said we are born free moral agent and and and to make a decision what every season we wish to God justly does that he must put every man on the same basis free to make decisions and you know as the years roll by I see the decisions people make and the price that they didn't expect to pay for the decisions that they make decisions are tremendous the right ones it will come out right if you make the right decisions now we are born free he put know so he put man and free the big choices right and wrong sets before each one of us life and death we can make our choice it's up to you to make it and that's the way Adam and Eve did they made the wrong choice and put the whole race under the penalty of debt and then God came down at the Forum man and took that debt and pay the penalty of death his subjects are desired to be free could go free now he took us without the same is it Adam and Eve and death pull us to something I save you whether you want to be seen or not then he put Adam on even the wrong basis you see but each one of us has to choose you choose to come service tonight and you could choose to have the right attitude you could choose to leave at a breakthrough you could choose to leave her it's something from the word tonight that's your choice you choose and I choose to try the serenity lord catch the my night goal or what to present to you tonight to bring the word to you tonight that it will help you and edify you and strengthen you each one of us has to choose this day between death and life we can do it now your life will prove exactly what side you're on I don't care what side you see you on what you do every day proves what you are you heard the whole scene your life is so loud I can't hear testimony your actions is so loud I all believe in shouting and jumping but I always believe don't jump no higher than you live because the world is gonna watch that you must just jump as high as you live because somebody is watching you people don't come to church some of them don't because this seems so much a corruption in church until they don't have nothing doing it many times is flat you can hardly blame them because of people act the callings of Christians they are the greatest stumbling block that the rulers got is a man and woman who profess to be Christian and lift something different from the profession he says that the disappointments when judgment wouldn't be for the drinker the gambler the adulteress when they hear this sentence read depart to everlasting fire he won't be disappointed but that fellow who's trying to hide himself behind some kind of church profession that's the boy is going to be disappointed in the day of judgment that professes to be a Christian and live somewhere away that's the greatest stumbling block we got is for professor that's he's a Christian and live something different here we go always not sometimes always always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform there we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back taking inventory of what kind of fruit that your life you Presley live is not better and somewhere along the somewhere along the line it seems that this word life has been pushed in a corner and information and knowledge and revelation and mysteries has come forward but I think what Isaac was preaching Christ could be presented as wood and he is the wood Christ can be resented that spirit or he's a spirit Christ could be presented as a person he's a person also what do you want him to be to you tonight hallelujah he spoke about a little kid I never saw him here before when by his grandma and he went to his house and he saw a mirror and he saw a little boy in a room he see a little boy in front of him the little boy was running also he stopped a few minutes and what the little lad was doing he turned his head the boy tune is head he scratches hit the boy scratch his head finally walk closer to investigate and he turn around and his mother watching him he said grandma why mother that's me why he saw a reflection of himself whatever he was doing the mirror was doing too and that is how we have to become when you look in the world you have to begin to see a reflection of your life we too are reflecting something our life is reflected now Jesus he ignored the scribes and the Pharisees and yet his life was scriptural oh we think about that he completely ignored it yet he was perfectly with the scripture but not in the way they knew it what side would you have took your life that you live now reflects just how you would have done then because you are still possessed with that same spirit if you take that side now and then you have done it then because he's the same spirit and you know was in them people then the devil never takes his spirit he just goes off from one man unto another and God never take his spirit neither it grew from one to another so that is why Jesus cuz it as was in these are Noah so shall has been a diesel in Solomon because jesus knew the same devils and demons and spirit now as the noise days will be chopping on in this lasts a year and if no one make it you wanna make it if he not make it you wanna make it or glory to God all em heroes of hit-making you wanna make it because God has released a spirit to make sure you call these like old we believe that do you believe that this is real enough oh yes you are being influenced influencing it in the earth from above and below or glory to God you are privileged to have a in France I'm above strike you that you can hear this message and hear this word so the holy spirit upon Christ come upon his disciples all down and still upon the people God never takes his spirit but we are left with a choice so Paul wasn't regretting anything he wasn't sorry was a prisoner he was addressing the church and wrote this letter because the Holy Spirit was causing him to write that he could express it by scene waters are wrong him he was in jail but that wasn't what he was speaking of he was a servant of Christ a minister with him he was speaking that he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ because Christ is the word all glory to God a prisoner to the world I don't care what Bishop say what as Bishop saying what the Pope says what the president say what the Prime Minister say what the ministers Association say a prisoner to the Word of God are we gonna get that back down or plural Iran real manner God real woman are thought prisoners to the Word of God you may be seated priest hallelujah he had ambition great ambition Tomiko he was trained for it he finished college he graduated he had clergy he had orders written and trusted to go on to the mask us to find those at wilted God and all that he trained for God had to take that out of him what his objective ones what is father I spent money for the ambitions of his father his mother you know some people we father and mother put all the burden upon his children to be this they want him to be this and it wouldn't be captain they spend their money they wanted doctor they son tibia engineer you daughter to be a doctor this want to be a lawyer and they put or think about it now all the investment and God say X all the money gone on him because what see I call you for that I call it for something else I have a higher calling for you Oh glory to God amen so all that he had to have been taken away from him that God had something else therefore he was a prisoner here we go from his objective of what he had in life and he has become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who was the word so only road to Damascus going down about 11 o'clock perhaps in the day he was strict on hear the voices Saul why persecutest thou me and he looked and being a Jew he know the pillar five is what led eternal Israel Paul not stupid he know the Scriptures he noticed it will Testament Allah fire let the generation this have to be the same pillar of fire or glory to God hallelujah praise God he was intelligent praise God but you know what he did hallelujah praise God he said he knew he had an experience but here's another goodness in verse experience alone isn't enough it's got to be an experience according to the word all people are not crazy cuckoo all kind of crazy experiences no scripture to back it up and they come at the cuckoo revelation with their experience and they don't want to examine it you see I like what I like do I enjoy talking with the Angels see what do you just see I wanna wait until it is so Paul went to three and a half years almost years Arabia desert the check is experienced by the world forgot to unveil dish just to him so when he came back he came back my revelation by inspiration by experience and he challenged every spirit I was in front of him or gentle even the disciples or glory who walk with Jesus hallelujah [Music] so him seeing was he took three years and six months in the desert in Arabia taking the Bible it was in the Old Testament and going down there to compare the experience he had and see to a scripture and today servants of Christ we become harness an octa we are harness to the word it's like when you connect a horse that carriage your highness the horse I miss to the word you can't get away from the word at all because you're locked in whatever God's say you believe not an interpretation of what God says what Court should leave or glory to God they study early is where you're fighting to read a Bible they not Lutheran it well me to try the brittle chap they tell people what the scriptures we gone way past that or glory to god this is coming to the manifestation of the sons of God when your people know their promises know what they call to know what God call them onto or glory of God God took away the prophet because we didn't need a prophet physically to be here all we need is a prophecy of the prophet or give the Lord a shout we didn't need a brother branham here we don't need a next mother Branham or get the Lord I show what we need is a fulfillment of the prophecy that that prophet brought because he didn't speak for himself he spoke to us here the Lord that kind of failed he saw the bright shield he saw the right corner he saw the right anointed he saw the bright commission he saw the right he saw the replica racks or nice doctor tonight he saw a baccarat he saw science one of the miracles he said Oh God help me live to see it it's so close I [Music] must feel it he was seeing it he said cancer is to take towards coming here plates coming Wars coming he said but we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God when born sons sell sons anointed son speak and your word is created just like that hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my go glory to God you are being York minute by the Holy Ghost as your cue to the world no matter what anybody else is in the word but I feel well I think that's your torch like nobody would say God see my thoughts are higher than your torch my wings I had on your waist don't come with your thoughts don't come with your ways don't come with your ideas we have never been here before we are the first and the edge of going on to Eternity or all these here is time about to run out revelation tell me in yourself I shall be no more Oh glory to glory I bought a brick into eternity time is running out Oh glory to God time is actually running out or time [Music] you're you waited to the word by the spirit he was harness and he had to learn the backs of the ribbon desert there with all the former things experiences and ambition you have been stripped of those things and that's what we find today we must be stripped we must be stripped first I know these things will be preached because what if you is 5 4 I will feel this so call and they do it's even quite a long time and what what but once it goes on I've got go call a man for 30 years for six months ministry you understand that 4:30 has got radar man for six months someone take a 40 years of Pergamon forget a man Shobha Moses while we're eating it but the harvester Moses was training the trainee best manage a panel or when he finished kill that one Egyptian dead man he ran for 40 years God just let him fat desert for 40 years and when after 40 has got ready for him now hey if they know you finish all of Egyptian foolishness ready no no one could use you you hear great when he was don't need to be here black know you he agree know already for your beard long you look angry I will take you through a little bit a little bit know already for you know you're ready to speak word your torture wasn't have your youth on your strength and energy in your you listen to is where no one mic and your own power but I wanted his nut by night it's not my power but by my spirit saith the Lord we must be stripped first and people don't want to be stripped the Methodist brother wants to hole a little bit to his Methodist teaching because father Leo whoever the father is he catch some revelation on a mountain and he he unfold this thing here so then we men who under father you or bishop lee or whoever it is them teaching nothing to and they don't want to let it go because his deity they I want to say is not God could I smear Barisan thing it's not gold yes yeah illusion and I'm Tiger man seen a lights up in the air like a video and it's pronounced in like you know it was a flashback pocket but is people's what kind of Russian I'm walking I think why not they he forget he like didn't win back pocket unless the composition everything motion like moving like moving who the Baptist brother one hold a baptist teaching but you have got to be stripped of everything and just be born again are fresh and take it from there that's why baram says the last is gone dear speaking about the Pentecost they will only be cutting he put the Pentecostal age in the womb of the mother that's a direct quote he has a question a mother having a baby is three stages what a blood spirit and so on like that he said yes you are be cutting first and then born so when the babies and the room is big lucky sell upon sell word a temple when the baby come true is born and he said the Pentecostal is they were begotten that means in the age context they were in the womb because William Branham had the word to produce the bit which was the person of Christ the baby or give the Lord a shout hallelujah that is right their tongues and signs and wonders couldn't reduce adoption it's the word to produce the life the life brings the character the character will be tested and proven and then gocta said this is my son so the Pentecostal fail because the only had gifts signs and one of the miracles but they couldn't come to the life because the life come from it from the word and the word came to the prophet and they reject the prophet so they couldn't get the word to believe the lies but we are the world's over 50 years where is that life that life is promised the professor he said as he said Sarah you're holding that seed long enough the Lateran is fixin to fall or give the Lord a shout you're not hearing the word in vain you are pregnant with God God put a seal inside of you or glory to God I am expecting that win people said you're in here already I'm great yeah yeah yeah got a shame the shame to believe you in coming let us sit here no and here no yes a prophecy the spirit is here dynamics is here in the form of the spirit of prophecy according to revelation 10 18 11 Tom must prophesy again and the testimony of Jesus spirit of prophecy so what I notice all these years with the spirit of prophecy the prophesy we prophesy the sick gonna be healed the plan gonna see that you will be filled with the Holy Ghost your family gonna come in you already delivered you'll be set free your prison bars gonna open up every single service I am moving on that you will get your original Holy Ghost not on you own egos not on modern Holy Ghost the same one Peter had because William Branham came to to the hearts back to the faith of the fathers we want 110 brothers had nothing less than that same power same signs same life same wonders same miracles Oh glory to God I will keep on this line until something happened and I lost something would happen if I mind stay with the word gonna share my continuation of the word or give the Lord a shout if I man stay with a word God will show him a continuation of the word hallelujah you gotta be stripped of everything and be born again afresh and let the Holy Spirit lead you can't say well my daddy said when he got in he went into the church he should come in a pasta he's a good lawyer member that might have been right for his race but we don't know the reefs we must come back to the Bible time for this day we have to come back to the Bible I love people say butter Browns Ibrahim said but they don't know waiters in the Bible this this message come revealed the Bible this reveal would have to slide check into the scripture or glory to God because Jesus came as it is written in the scripture he said he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said even Jesus had to find the scripture that he could announce the Spirit was upon me we have to find our scripture every mystery of a scripture behind it every me every demonstration every unfolding have a scripted behind it Gloria what are you at me tonight hallelujah these priests were honest too but you see that come over into another dispensation they feel the strip off they're all harnessed and put on a new harness the same thing we find today we did come to a denominational age we proved to the church ages the Bible and so forth but now here we go we come to a free age where the Holy Spirit Himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known makes every promise that he promised come to pass what a great time he call it a fridge Oh glory to God and I believe was in the Philadelphia age praise God God set a open door not the Holy Spirit could begin to move in the church however he wants to that door shut yet he said whatever door I open I opened or whatever though I shut eyes shut when he shut the door you shut that door but that's an open door that door is still open tonight that thought of the Holy Ghost is still open tonight that you could be filled with the Holy Ghost no man can operate that door no man can shut that door no man inside that door God said behold I set before you an open door that door is still open tonight oh god I feel good saying that tonight that door is open tonight for whosoever will to come Oh glory to God hallelujah whosoever will [Applause] Oh hallelujah but a Branham says Paul he said he was honest he knew that his ambition drawed him among brethren where he are invited to come and yet he was pressed in the spirit to do something else maybe somebody said but I saw brother Paul we want you to come over here because we got the biggest Church we got the biggest congregation and your offerings will be great and so forth but being pressed in the spirit he told I got a brother over here I like to go over and see this brother get him to the Lord but yet the Spirit pressed him to go somewhere else he was a prisoner correctly so he was entitled ization well if you go Adam brothers you're not with me no more he wasn't tired he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ oh god what a Branham make us prisoners like that from our own selfish ambition from our own judgements and our better way of thinking to be a prison of Jesus Christ I think that was a great statement I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ and remember he's the word no matter what anybody else thinks it's the word and if you're a prisoner to the word nor denomination can show you from it he says the bride he said no man could make her do otherwise he said the secret is the word is in the bride and she don't have the mind of Christ to know what he was done with the word no man could do to take them otherwise Oh hallelujah praise God we not talk about a man with the word knowing again a man that standing where they were constant with the word living with that word it must come to fruit Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God you know somebody's an old crack hypocrite then what new life not at all and some power coming behind them you know that is not that not be the perfect will of God that could be permissive will not be perfect will it has to have a track record that like parameter P Thomas called time-tested memorial go ahead after test you over time go ahead and make a nobody no overnight this and overnight that they not Kentucky Fried Chicken you know it's fast food go to peddle in fast food Stockton coming fashion no coming to the fan testing when Braun took my deduction and he said his son coming true his son coming justified he said give him some more years not some weeks you know give him some more years he coming along real nice drop some more years on him drop some somebody s not just tiny along his child's he's testin i turned his wife again see my tiny church against him I cast him at a better sickness and he said though he's play me and I'll trust him my god are so not easy at all that sounds just like his father Oh God eerie talking faith he live and fit the expression faith he's living in this thing or the devil triger make him frustrated and sick and Eve all I'm the Lord I got a deal Eddie of all I diseases and he said I strike I am healed what a sunny praising God in the bad times he praising God in a good time he praising God when things that difficult when the father see that angel see that the Father cometh to bring an approval Oh glory to God hallelujah look at Elijah and Elijah Elijah tell Elijah stay here and that man who caught a vision who had a purpose who got a revelation I'm not staying here as in Lord liveth I'm following you I'm not gonna stay here he says they better take a girl till Jericho you see I'm not saying when you follow that man of God and then other people tell them you'll know your master we take from you today you say yeah I know it hold your peace that's when our main focus that's when you have focus when you have vision that's when you know where you're going you tell people shut up if you're not going so but I'm look into me you not go anywhere I am going you not seeing what I am seeing do what I say hinder me I see a vision I see cross Jordan have what I want and then try to open up Eli just turning them right I will say what you want me to do what you want he said double portion man I come in from a small portion a comfort double portion I call all these years I come to a tional showers of blessings I want to brief us of living water I want to swim in this river brother or give the Lord some praise these people you can't calm down and asking for lord help me Lord bless me know you want more than you wanna power in your life like we say something you want to be a powerhouse people should be coming to connect to you or give the Lord a shout you wanna saw what I'm saying when people come and contact with you they get attached from you because you are powerhouse glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no they

have a battery to going to put that batch of the holy was inside of you praise God that's a everlasting source of power like no solar power like in a power may be PO any in a man and when God put that power inside of you nobody could own the power go turn had that power inside of him and they boil him in a vat of oil I went to finished put firon boy boy boy boy boy John was still alive normal normal normal you can't boil oh that power you can't burn that power that power good in the fiery furnace that power good in the lion's den or glory they've gotta get me started aside Oh glory to God hallelujah this is the old-time Holy Spirit I'll never go near it that's the reason people hear it what is good enough for me this part will charge your battery this point will revive your soul this one will make it stand up in church and give God praise and give what I show this power give God make it give go to hallelujah and a praise and worship or glory to God that is what this is about [Music] [Applause] my mind so tonight if we expand on Tabernacle come on become prisoners to our own selfish being to own ambition and we could completely surrender ourselves and be yoked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we are yoked with fetters of love we are prisoners my feet is so yo cat won't dance my eyes are so you up to Christ till when I see these models trapeze on the street it turns my head my heart is so you can love to him till I can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yoked to him then I don't even know know what my ambitions are wherever you lead Lord I will follow Lord I'll be a prisoner Paul was correctly a prisoner he wasn't making any wrong statement he was trained by the holy ghost to wait on the word no he had been trained one way but now go treat him another way he was trained by the horse pray to wait upon the Lord no matter what his ambition was say not born with this there's a training what a train you in the spirit trainer with the things of God you have to be trained Oh glory Lord God no God is looking for prisoners let's take the character Moses he was born deliverer he knew he was born deliverer oh praise God God always has to take a man that was sitting truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything his life his soul his body his will his ambition and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God listen to this you might have to walk on carry to your better judgment maybe in a certain organization you might have to think that they could lift you up and give you something great and you might flash and when you find yourself you are defeated after why until God get that man willing to become a prisoner here so they never feel and money and popularity man one popularity I wanted to go here and somebody call a year because you want you want to be more exposure you want a piece of Fame what my Lord God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might say to the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ stop see that again I will see it again you cannot be connected with anything but Christ whose side you're on whose side you're on these doctrines I know that dr. Assad who say oil is the wood the wood is Christ therefore you cannot be kind of end about Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you look Oh see you as that is it doesn't matter if the pastor for long dead you connected to Christ it doesn't matter B - it split in 15 pieces or trillion of expected to 20 pieces you are connected to Christ doesn't matter Pope Francis among young give everybody to a Lemurian - or father in a chaplet you connected to Christ only Christ the word is God you're not watching the next brother and that's just oh he does do it so he doesn't do it no what did he would say they're making excuses for your behavior because you watch it brother's doing this I'm sisters doing that and you think you could do it - or whether they would say don't do what they do do what they would say then you're locked in with Christ going on sometimes speak rough the people I'm trying to get you to cut loose this is been around you got to have a starting place like something called a woman Bob in the hair wearing these clothes and maintain the Christian profession you say that's a little thing when they gotta start somewhere so begin with your ABCs and cut truth the world looks and become a prisoner and then keep on cut loose until the last and has cut loose so you have to start to cut somewhere and eventually a cut more you cut more you cut more until you're fully loose loose from the world then your prisoner then and you becoming his grip so Moses Moses got training he could teach the Egyptians he could teach the psychologist he could teach the generals they what military was he was a great man people feared Moses because of his greatness scholarship he was a bishop maybe like a pope he's a great fellow a mighty man and he knows he was born to do this so there's a man have a anchor on the inside of what he was born and called to do God before he could get the man in his hand he had to strip him of his ambition you have to strip him of all his training he called he killed one Egyptian and when he did he thought he wasn't wrong he couldn't run any desert run in the wilderness you're just kind of strange go to have a message for them men did he get me to the desert because he took Paul in the desert and training go to desert Moses time he took him that desert kept in there for 40 years and stripped him of all the theology and his ambition what a time Oh glory to God wannabe strip people know this and I know this and along that message and that's why I always as I speak us anyway you know we have not been here before see it can't go by the history and past record you need a fresh experience Oh glory to God even when Joshua getting tired and where you getting old God come and tell Joshua Joshua there's more land to be taken so do this talk that talking although that no no it's a mall and I take the land of the distant land is that - yeah yeah mall and to take just show one every place we put in for this yours but after while there is more land to be taken listen us not to take linear we only observe inland talking about land this is you know when you begin just when you said take your land you had a backup enemy's backup them Devils Oh glory to God Amen let's continue he said okay so you people instead of staying - that would harness what do they do they start their only nomination theory which already filled and tried to manufacture something that looks like the truth that's why save me you know people testimonies it's not people talk no he's not doing that is our living reality but Abraham wasn't talking this thing you know he was manifesting this thing you know as I always say after he preached he say you know what I'm waiting on I'm returning the angel in Lord and he'll be talking after what'd he say he is here how many years here if he's bringing on his guns he's easier I know oh come around guns and POW shootin Devils never start to be on your own you know because a son of God have backup hallelujah hallelujah full ammunition and sometime Devils asking other divers for assistance because they know they either go so they see spirits all in other spirits but roms in all of that its various except for help because they don't want to leave so they want to be like a strong man banging that person he casted all them out you're banging a strong man and the any small man - or glory to God hallelujah praise God this bag will be something else at all this will really be a super jet you know

was the word then he submitted himself to the word and the Holy Spirit their God Hannes Moses to the will of God oh my and Paul sitting there seeing the word sitting that it was seen that it was Jesus he was harnessed to him the love of God harnessed him to the word I'm going to bear my name my him his name before the Gentiles Moses I am the color of your father's I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I remember my promise to them the time of promise is near I see the afflictions of my people I remember my promise and I'm come down to harness you you know what the word said I've had a few to

just like Paul booted him train to see me Moses dream to deliver the churn of Israel by a mighty hand we almost finished Paul trainer take them out by the hand of the Romans put them put em free but porter them went in the desert to come back different men both of them saw the pillar of fire what an em were prophets both of them they talked to the pillar of fire or glory that they were trained one way and God changed them to another and they had to become complete prisoners to not act in the way they wanted to act but act in the way God wanted him to act he's the same yesterday then forever I let me drop this bomb the Holy Ghost will not behave in one person and misbehaving on a policeman or give the Lord a shout on that one the Holy Cross have one behavior which is the word so the Holy Ones can behave in a brother I've missed me even another is that in the Holy Ghost once God the Holy Ghost so when I hear all these bread remedies for inspiration and revelation I am the Holy Spirit and see the behavior is not the Holy Spirit it's two difference cousins they then they things not the Holy Spirit is an enticing spirit a spirit impersonating in Christianity or glory to God hallelujah because the Holy Ghost have one day area the behavior of the word what Obama's a genuine Christian he lives something oh but he manifested Christ Oh glory to God and this is the final one we're gonna see the wrap up here with Joseph go glory to God Joseph born a prophet he could see visions he was a little boy he saw himself on the throne his brothers bowing to him what did God have to do to him put him in prison he loved his father loving father giving excel juice X a drink after porn it's a cake extra bake this if I Darrell of Joseph but what have a special please no juices to become a prisoner Alleluia please we notice I believe he went prison he could remember the vision he's gonna set him that shone his brothers coming to bow before him because he knew that his gift come from God he knew had to come to pass if we could only keep us in our mind according to the Word of God here we go in these last days he gonna have a church keeping other people and these thing I he promised he's going to do to them and he said he would so even if he in prison he's gonna do it Joseph knew that fish ain't gonna come to pass he knew his dick was of God you got to know it so that you wouldn't let the circumstances are wrong you block and blind the vision of what is to be [Music] and these things were missing you wanna do them he said he would and we are living in that time we are here he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners locked him with him you know the whole song shutting with God I want to be shutting with God no remember he was thinking he is also a total failure to himself all he knew all you understood he become a total failure it didn't work he was put in a situation there where nobody would listen to him no he liked to be in opposition revolution had nobody listening to you he was a prisoner he was he was put into that situation that unbelievers will not believe do you see what I mean his ministry was of none effect the people turning their head wouldn't be no attention what good would his ministry do he might stand in prison bars preach to them they walk on his street but he become a prison and God kept him a prisoner until doneall got rule up right and then he said here is my man where I'm say glory to Thalia finally God God came to him in prison like Paul like the rest of them he used the gift that he had to give him to get him out of there he brought him from his prison what do you do I only brought him his prison he was given power by the king and the King he set on the side of that he was under he was brought from prison house and given power in his prison he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose and when you and your prison just remember you were born for a purpose that you're gonna be healed and you won't be delivered and you wouldn't just die out and just leave this world just like that Oh glory to God a man in the prison he causally remembered he was born for a purpose he was gonna sit by the king all the rest of them was gonna bow a knee to him his vision told him so but before his vision could be completely fulfilled he had to become a prisoner and Christ makes us prisoners of love this sons and he give them the same power send John 14:12 he that believeth on me the ones that I do shall you do also even more than this Ollie do know the prison of the love of Christ becomes empowered by the king Oh hallelujah praise God verily if you say to respond to me move and don't doubt any heart but believe what you said it shall come to pass if he abided me so look over around just choppin all these promises out of here prisoners Joseph notice mission gone please before he come out before you had to be taken out and shaved a few things had to be shaved off before he could meet this king Oh God sometimes takes people like that and she is of you of the only ones off that they can't just do what they want to do you know what I mean they are not in liberty to do what they want to do because before they could comment the full power oh and be a love slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and then presented as a next message myself shaves off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them off then bring them out the anointed ones to fulfill the purpose that your Deen for them to see see what I mean brethren we are the endtime remember all other times what he's done he's always take a man and make him a prisoner to him the forsake praise God Oh hallelujah the first take everything that you know forget all of his trainings he can't follow anything that man has got to do I cannot go in back he has statements you hear comments and so on and different things said but you have to ask yourself is that in the world did God say that because it has to be the word especially now remember what you called Cottagers was what started at Pentecost and they just deteriorate so bad that is a thing so allow a tall hat sprinkle some holy water that was once Pentecost him because fell away to that condition you know tell the Bible is irrelevant they do another read scriptures is what he pops it when the Pope said this country black it later just because he pops it but God said I will restore so he made sure Alpha and Omega the first church and the last Church would be the same church so you have to expect the same thing that pizza they had same power Peter a ha and we have a greater revelation than what the other church is has had because this is the end of time the breaking of the Seventh Seal almost done you know okay noted okay alright if you are following God and I'm submitting yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that God - that would - that will no matter what anybody else says you become a prisoner to it
