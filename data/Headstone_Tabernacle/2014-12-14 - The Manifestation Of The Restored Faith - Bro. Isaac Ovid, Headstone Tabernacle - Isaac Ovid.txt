many men well i feel blessed this morning amen so are you ready for the word this morning just a little end of year message to encourage your face a little bit amen so can we stand to our feet thank you musicians and as we go to three portions of scripture we're going to read from the book of hebrews chapter 11. we're going to read from ephesians 4 and we're going to read from the book of jude there's just one chapter there so we're going to read jude 3. amen so we're going to read hebrews 11 and reading verse 1. now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh my lord by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him shall we go to ephesians 4 and reading from verse 4 ephesians 4 and verse 4. there is one body and one spirit even as he are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all and reading from the book of jude reading verse 3 jude reading verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that he should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of all ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we have read lord from your holy text this morning and i pray that the holy spirit will take me out of the way father lord god you gave me a message for your church this morning and i pray there god that you will walk out the pages of the bible and speak to them speak to every life lord they are backsliders in here today may you restore them they are unsaved here this morning may you save them they are those looking for the baptism of the holy ghost on fire may you fill them god almighty lord may you bless the word may you anoint the people may you anoint me we know the word is already anointed father and god for how many minutes we stand here this morning father may you get glory and honor to your precious name in the wonderful name of jesus christ and the church says and the church says amen well you may be seated this morning everybody feeling fine so for my title this morning the manifestation of the restored faith the manifestation of the restored faith and my subject one lord one faith one baptism and my inspiration earnestly contending for the faith restored by malachi 4. can the church say amen earnestly contending for the faith restored by malachi hallelujah and we read in the book of hebrews that faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen and we understand that through faith what we see were made of things that don't appear hallelujah that itself is a paradox there a lot of christians who don't even understand that but if you go back all the way in the beginning adam walked by faith adam lived by faith when adam spoke it had to come to pass because he was operating just like his father adam didn't know the word doubt he didn't know the word unbelief he didn't know the word fear all adam knew was faith when adam said mountain moved the mountain had to move hallelujah somebody say man adam didn't know what it was to doubt he didn't know what it was to fear he didn't have any unbelief adam had that original fate that what you say has got to come to pass hallelujah and before we leave this place there will be a manifestation of the restored faith once more the world will hear direct from god oh hallelujah give god glory this morning hallelujah hallelujah and hebrews 11 is such a powerful scripture i had a revival just reading hebrews 11 because it goes through all the heroes of faith and as i read it i was looking for my name oh somebody help me this morning because hebrews 11 says by faith abel by faith enoch by faith noah by faith abraham by faith jacob by faith and i was looking and say where's my name i see by faith isaac by faith joseph by faith moses oh hallelujah and if this writer could have kept writing he was going to say by faith for the jerome by faith with the stephen it is impossible to please god without faith hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated in hebrews 11 hebrews 11 verse 32 and here it is what shall i see or what shall i more see for the time would fail me in other words it's almost like this letter he was on a time limit to write this letter and he was running out of time he couldn't go into the details of what was going on he couldn't really get down into all the names because there were just too many names of people who live by faith who walk by feet who worship by faith who shout by fit who rejoiced by faith somebody help me this morning hallelujah if you don't have faith this morning you're going to leave here with faith you may be seated what shall i most say for the time would fail me and i feel this morning time would fail me to tell of gideon amen gideon and i'm barack and of samson and of jephthah of david and samuel and of the prophets who true faith subdued kingdoms they arrested kingdoms wrought righteousness of obtained promises or stopped the mouth of lions and quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword somebody give god a south he may be seated out of weakness were made strong wax valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection oh we're gonna live by faith this morning we're gonna rejoice by faith this morning hallelujah he may be seated i'm just encouraging your faith this morning what we see with our natural eyes is the enemy of fate whatever you can see is the enemy of fate because fate has the ability to see what's invisible so when i look at the audience this morning you might look in the mirror and say i don't know if i can make it but god is a god of faith hallelujah when he looks at you he doesn't see you in your weak condition he doesn't see you in your dead condition he doesn't see your sin last night because he's looking through the blood and by faith you could be in the house of god this morning you may be seated it troubled by the branham it disturbed the prophet when he would have these healing campaigns and people were sitting in church for all the years and they couldn't get healed and people would walk off the street and they would get a hold of fate and they would get this deposit on their account and they would have this card like a mastercard or a visa card only it's called an eternity card and there's a fake currency that your boss can give you your wife can't give you your neighbor can't give you how long you're in church doesn't top that account up that's a faith account i mean the problem said fate is a revelation of the will of god and if you get a revelation of the will of god about your life it gives you a reason to celebrate it gives you a reason to jump it gives you a reason to dance some of you haven't danced for a long time but this morning i feel like dancing this morning after he like shouted him this morning i feel like praising this morning i feel like lifting up the name of jesus you made me see them fate is the purchasing power it is invisible you can see it brother branham said we have to exchange our fate for healing you have to exchange your faith for the holy ghost that's a direct quote so there's some place there got to be someplace with the clearance there's a counter somewhere where on the other side of the counter it's the holy ghost it's the healing it's your children it's what you're looking for and there's somebody collecting faith saying give me the faith and look the holy ghost give me your faith and look your healing give me your faith and look your son give me your faith look at your daughter oh somebody help me this morning the faith level is going to rise and rise and rise until one day you're going to break into rapturing fate and when you're breaking the rapture and faith you're going to walk up to that count up and you're going to hand that face right there and you're going to get a spaceship we're going to leave this place glory to god somebody say man somebody give god praise hallelujah you may be seated what are you seeing preacher you may not have money this morning this christmas me you may not have any ham this morning i don't know but if you have faith this morning you could speak for him but isaac are you serious are you you know who you are you know who your father is you know who your god is you know the power that's locked up in you it takes faith to activate the power the power never left the power's been here all along we just didn't have enough faith but seven thunders seven thunders gives the bright faith to activate the power you maybe see that look at blind bottom ears he had a routine he had a schedule every morning he'd get up and strategically place himself where everybody would pass by you can't be looking to beg and go on a deserted street where nobody is passing amen even a blind man knows you got to be somewhere where the crowd is so he couldn't see how to get there but whether he listened to the footsteps or whatever he knew where to place himself to beg but wherever he went to pick the crowd he would usually expect i don't know what budget he was working with but the crowd he would expect to get the money was looking for they just weren't there so he had to question where is everybody and they said brother everybody is with jesus i don't know if you know him but he heals the sick he raises the dead he causes the blind to seek the lame to walk the dumb to talk blind by the mayor's put down his collection receipt book he said you tell me that somebody could heal my eyes he didn't know how to find emma because he couldn't see his way maybe you came this morning and you can't see your way but jesus is on the street this morning hallelujah hallelujah you maybe see that so blind by the mayors did the only thing he had power to do hallelujah he's not gonna lift his voice he couldn't walk anywhere he can see jesus he used all he had he said jesus son of david have mercy on me those around him said pardon mayor stop wasting time but he went into fate he went into fate he broke into peter and that fate connected with god's satellite and it relayed from god's satellite to where jesus was and jesus began to walk to him like he walked to you this morning and he's here to meet your need hallelujah he may be seated faith says the situation can change fate says before the doctor's hand could touch my wife the tumor is going to go down faith says it doesn't matter what the situation is the situation will change and this morning we are earnestly contending for the faith restored by malachi 4 because the fate has been restored how could you say this because that was brother branham's purpose to restore the fate so you can't tell me that he wasted his time when he came to this earth so the fact that he's not here means the fate has already been restored now it's up to us to contend everybody feeling fine this morning everybody happy in the house of god this morning hallelujah this is the real christmas message listen to brother branham you know some people has great big fate like that they can be healed in a moment some have faith that much they can be healed in a week some has mustard seed feed takes them a long time so there are different measures of fate for you to start your car you have to have it you believe when you turn the ignition something is going to happen that's fate when you tell your neighbor or your friend i'm going to see you at nine o'clock in the morning lord willing that's fate when you walk on your house to go to work you have faith to believe that you're going to reach to work and that's a low level of faith but branham talked about dingy fate he talked about the lepers who were outside the city and they say if we stay here we die if we go out we die we might as well go out that's the lowest fee that's reason and faith but this morning we're not talking about that low level of faith we're talking about your fear coming up to the restored fate the apostolic fate the original fate the faith they had in the day of pentecost with the same signs the same wonders the faith that jesus was resurrected you may be seated brother branham said we hardly have faith for divine healing are we going to have faith for the rapture so something has to happen to the faith banks in the church that the impossible can become possible the bible says when the son of man cometh shall he find more groups more churches more ministers more teaching more doctrine more ideas no shall he find fate and that son of man cometh is not seen luke 17 30 that's not brother branham that son of man coming as dynamics to rest upon fate to rest upon the faith in the church to connect with the faith in the church somebody's saying man so faith with all works is dead faith must cause action faith must be demonstrated faith must be displayed you can tell me you have faith and you're not doing something about your situation faith has here in its chest real feet can't sit down you could be in a wheelchair but your faith could be standing up can the church say a man everybody feeling fine this morning and jesus when he came he represented the fate was the fate and he came to deliver the fate to his disciples to the apostles so they would have the same signs the same ones the same miracles now listen carefully it took fate for the apostles to go to the upper room they needed faith to go to the upper room and they caught faith listen carefully when they saw jesus raised from the dead they have faith because they saw something they never saw before they saw something they couldn't really explain to anybody but they saw it and they caught faith and that measure of faith brought them to the upper room listen they did not yet have faith to preach the gospel they didn't have faith to say self and go have i none they did not fade yet to move the power they only had enough fate to make it to the upper room oh i hope you see where i'm going this morning they didn't have faith with the same signs for the same wonders for the same miracles they didn't have faith for the greater works they only had enough fate to just make it to the upper room in fact for the problem said they hold themselves up so all that they heard and saw gave them enough faith to just come to the upper room they didn't have faith to go after their children they didn't have faith to do any greater work just yet but they had faith to go to the upper room and you say to me preach up i don't have faith he had to go after my son to go after my daughter but we are preaching the faith to take you to the upper room this morning because when the holy ghost fell the fate was delivered to them and when the holy ghost failed that same peter who didn't have the faith to face the romans to face anybody he said this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel because the faith was delivered oh glory glory glory glory so don't be discouraged don't give up now don't backslide now you are already in the church this morning your fate already brought you the right place at the right time now let god take care of the rest of it god told him terry terry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from manheim they couldn't accelerate it they couldn't speed it up they just had to have faith to wait he may be seated you know when as the more the lord opens up to me i realize how many people really miss this message of malachi 4. pastors ministers people had a message for 50 years 40 years is really relevant length or tenure in a message really of no consequence it's about revelation that's right because when god gives you a revelation it makes you stand on a film foundation that nobody can move you can't tell me you have a revelation and then you just jump and teach this teach just teach that that's off the world a revelation will keep you on the word even if you fall even if you make a mistake the revelation will point you to your destination the revelation is like it's like it's like you're not part of a compass it keeps you aligned to the right place so even with all peter's mistakes his fault peter denied christ but peter had a revelation that was pointed to one destination the upper room the upper room the upper room the upper room the upper room that was the destination you may be seated i want you to catch this jesus in his resurrection ministry after he rose from the dead the bible says he opened the disciples understanding to the scriptures in other words for the three and a half years they walked with jesus and they saw the miracles and they heard jesus preach they did not understand what was going on and there are many people sitting in church this morning who have been in church for years and they don't understand what is going on so jesus after he rose from the dead he had his 40-day resurrection ministry and the same disciples who saw him heal the sick raised the dead saw him die and rose again now he opened the understanding to the scriptures listen the opening of the word drove them to the upper room to wait for the holy ghost to wait for dynamics the opening of the word didn't drive them to say well let me try to teach this try to explain this no the opening of the word drove them to the upper room to wait for the promise of the father to wait for thief hey you may be seated listen carefully when the word is opened to you it will drive you to the upper room it will drive you to wait for dynamics the fact that their understanding was open was not enough to meet the challenge of the hour they needed to have the faith they needed to have the power they needed to have dynamics but the opening of the word was to put them in desperation and expectation and preparation for the power and you don't hear me this morning you may be seated we're going to have a trained church a train in the church you must be sharp with the word shop with the word some of you speak to some people look at the world we know it's sharper than any two-edged sword you thought of some people and they hit in the wood like this and that saw their shopping for five years seven years clown clown you're not gonna hear no clown with my sword no contact like a laser who is that who who passed through there's no clan clan this sword is so sad star wars and style whatever laser technology we had it a long time ago sharper enemy two-headed sword rightly dividing the wood bringing fresh skilled meat every service spiritual food and due season tastes good tastes fresh no microwave food this food is just being cooked right now right now right now fresh out the oven fresh out the oven you are the first one to cut it let's cut it up this morning let's share it up this morning hallelujah this is pre-christmas dinner we got the turkey this morning we got the chicken this morning we got fresh pig this morning you may be seated so the word was open to them so they know what to expect what to look for what to wait for peter ran up and said now the word is open let me go and tell everybody this and that no tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be enduring power from behind amen so the word is open to us to wait for dynamics the promise is just as real to us now as it was to them when they were waiting for the holy ghost now listen carefully no wonder but the pranam said wait till those seven thunders utter their voices to that group that can take the word and hand it there now i wanna say something here you know it's amazing how people can read the same quotes i come up with different conclusions and i remember when i was in school they told us when you use language and expression and you're trying to make emphasis you could emphasize any kind of thing in a sentence so i could say the boy ran down the road and i could emphasize the boy ran down the road so not the girl the boy ran down the road i could say the boy ran down the road he didn't walk he ran down the road so the boy ran down the road he didn't run down the highway he ran down the road it's the same sentence but the interpretation of it could be different depending on what you emphasize so people sometimes read quotes and say and they run off with something but that page 304 quote says wait till the seven thunders utter their voices to that group and a lot of people got stuck under that group part and say this is my group is your group is that group is this group and the focus is not on the group the focus is who could take the word and hand it there that is gospel that is the word so when you want to read and go around talking about stuff make sure it is divinely revealed to you what the word is saying because there are many groups that can't take the word and there are many groups that can't hand it there oh somebody help me this morning to take the word means take all the word to hand it there means to know what to do with the word and that could only take place when the word is open to you so that's why wait until the seven thunders utter their voices to that group who could take the word knows what to do with the word in other words have the mind of christ the intelligence to know what to do with the word then they're gonna slice it's gonna cut it's gonna open the heavens you may be seated i might get it lord but i said what are you doing i'm contending for the fate i'm arguing for the faith you can't stop me i know who i am i know who my god is jude exhorted us he didn't exhort the ministers he exhorted everybody content for the faith fight for the fate that was once delivered to the saints because we need that state to get out of here you maybe see that i'm tired of playing games tired of the foolishness people supposed to know better we're going to make this church so hot that's why i love what brother orbit said last week there is no church template for us to follow on the earth there's only one temple there's a word template there is no church on the planet that i can look up to i have to look up to the word template and ephesians church because we are looking for another ephesians and every sovereign church has to contend for the faith to be manifested in that church and what's the faith the same signs the same wonders the same miracles the same life the same power the same anointing the same dynamics the same spirit how could you be that group if you're not taking the word and you don't know what to do with it i'm on page three or four you're not taking the word you don't know what to do with it but you're on the page you can only reach that page when you have all the word in you the full food value in uf mechanics and the mind of christ the the the the faculty that doesn't move that intelligence drops down to know how to rightly divide the word in the right season to have the right effect because whether branham said one day the right word would be spoken the right thing would be said and we were dashed into the presence and you want to tell me i'm supposed to play games with this gospel when i got family out there i got loved ones out there they are backsliders we're not here right now we have to have a power to go after i don't them what condition they're in this morning we're coming for them we are serving notice this morning we are coming we are coming there will be one more ride we're gonna ride this trail one more time and pick up our loved ones pick up our families he may be seated from the message spoken with his original seed notice what harmony jesus never did anything until seen of the father the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see so will the bride and he shows out his word of life he shows up and she receives it she never doubts it nothing could harm or not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again now i got a great big hallelujah that's a prophet speaking here's the secret the word is in the bride that's why we have to contend for it because the word must be in the pride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord somebody's saying man amen what are they going to keep still that's right so young people this is for you i'm tired of hearing young people tell me that they don't want to come to church because there are too many hypocrites in the church we have parents fathers mothers grandfathers grandchildren saying this kind of foolishness and the only reason you could say something like that is because you really lack the revelation of this mystery of what god is because if you look at matthew 16 and it's very interesting when you study the scriptures jesus asks his disciples who do men say i am and they began to with the knowledge that they had and their need to impress and a desire to sound sophisticated they said all the most spiritual names they could come up with elijah john the baptist jeremiah or one of the great prophets that's what they're saying and then jesus challenged the very men who were there all these years watching him and say who do you say that i am and there was silence in the church nobody was jumping up nobody was shouting nobody was singing because he caught them and then peter says that were the christ the son of the living god and jesus turns to him and say peter flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you but my father in heaven and upon this rock i built my church do you know how good peter felt you know how the disciples the other disciples felt why why couldn't have been me but i want you to look a little deeper down because it was after that jesus began to explain to the disciples what's about to unfold because he didn't want to tell them without them knowing who he was so you have to clarify that issue first so now you know who i am let me tell you what's about to happen and then tell them peter ups and says don't do it lord and don't die and and what did jesus say get thee behind me satan so i want you to imagine somebody watching at the church that day who missed the first part and just walk in and see jesus telling peter getty behind me satan he said look at the hypocrite now jesus have a devil in his church how could he look at unbelief look at and what people fail to realize is that peter had a destination this seemed peter who had a revelation because if anybody had a revelation was peter jesus confirmed he had a revelation but the revelation didn't take the snake out of his heart all the revelation was doing was telling him you have an upper room to come up a room to come up a room to come so peter walking around with a revelation and his behavior still had change it's changing but it's natural change there's no spiritual change because when the world comes to you begin to shape up you begin to clean your land but there's a spiritual something that peter needed to kill the snake you could be here yourself and avoid shady places and do all this stuff but when the holy ghost fire bombs a snake in your heart fire bombs that lust fire bombs that demon fire bomb that lion spirit you may be seated so don't be too quick to judge people because the upper room is to come let me see it another way until dynamic strike just keep praying for people and make sure your calling and election is short why why listen carefully because when dynamic strikes it's too late to add word food value because the rain comes to bring up the sea that planted so you have to make sure right now instead of looking at other people and criticizing you add the word in your life so when the rain comes you could say lord here i am i'm ready what are you doing with isaac i'm earnestly contending for the faith restored by malachi 4. i hope this sets some people free this morning you may be seated it's impossible to contend for the faith without bumping into someone who doesn't agree with you contending means there will be conflict there will be argument there will be contention and i'm going to go into some scriptures because i know some of you may not have read it but you're going to see in the scripture what i'm talking about and i want to say this if everybody in the message understood what the faith was there would be no confusion amen and that's the truth but the brandon taught us that the lack of revelation is what causes the division so you can help it when people want to argue with you or at times you will have to argue because the command is content for it because we are looking to see something the fate has been delivered it has been restored we have to contend to make a church that will make a revival that's our responsibility somebody's amen hallelujah so let me do a little teaching for a few minutes contending the corinthians had contentions over foolishness over the law over who did this and stuff like that but let's look at the book of acts can we do that everyone could follow with me acts 11. acts 11 verse 1. do a little bible teaching this morning because in speaking to the pastor i said you know 2014 is coming to an end and certain behaviors of 2014 will not cross over into 2015. so you need to read the word more you need to be sharper because listen the end is here you know it's not coming it's here so listen carefully acts 11 verse 1 and the apostles and the brethren that were in judea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god and when peter was come up to jerusalem they were they that were of the circumcision contended with him now understand that this is these are not unbelievers now these are the original jews who were with jesus who heard word that the word went to the gentiles and they had a problem with that and they contended these are holy ghostfield brothers men of the circumcision they contended with peter the same peter that god said you have a revelation the same peter that said this is that the same pizza i got to give you the keys whatever you pine on earth is bound in heaven they contended with peter seeing dog wentes into men uncircumcised and did eat with them but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them in other words step by step he explained here what this is what happened now you understand it's a real spirit when you say when somebody accuses you of something and don't even give you the opportunity to explain what happened so here it is this is the apostle peter and fellow ministers fellow apostles and when peter get back to jerusalem leave the gentiles he comes home and he said brother we have a problem with you peter why are you with the gentiles why are you eating their food why are you ministering to them and people say wait hold up let me explain to you what happened because i know you heard it truly grapevine but now i'm here to explain to you what really went on that's why i said we're gonna have a trench and we have too many grapevines i have to cut some of the vines and you read it in your own time peter goes and explains to them and then reached down to a point where in like verse 15 he says and as i begin to speak this is peter talking the holy ghost fell on them how could you deny that so peter is telling him what happened and tell him what happened and how how he reached the end whenever he said as i begin to speak the holy ghost fell upon them as on us at the beginning how could they deny that so he said so peter come and tell them not only did they receive the word but the holy ghost that we have fell upon them also in other words peter is contending for defeat arguing debating explaining and then here peter then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but he shall be baptized with the holy ghost and the bible said verse 18 when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god so you want to tell me that contention is not part of it people want to say well we we we're fighting too much that's scriptural let's go to acts 15. everybody feeling fine reading the bible now acts 15 let's go to verse 35. paul also and barnabas continued antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they're doing let's go let's go check up on them and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphlet and went not with them to the work you say i don't want mark to go and but i'm saying let's carry mark listen to the scripture these are holy ghost-filled brothers and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed a son of one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sail on the cypress and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the president unto the grace of god what is paul doing earnestly contending for the faith and paul was actually right because later he said no mark ready he could come with us so all those who want to sit down in church in the message saying well i'd already know what's going on and i don't know who they believe and i don't know what to do and too much fighting what is that army the opinion potato days are over 2014 is the last year of peeling potatoes we are using an automated kitchen to do the food everybody now in the army everybody has to fight and contend for defeat delivered to the saints restored by malachi 4. what are we doing but i say contending for the faith last example acts 19 here it is apollos has an intellectual fate of the message and here is paul coming down saying here's what paul with defeat comes down and say have you received the holy ghost since you believe and upon us with his intellectual fate saying well i didn't really know about this holy ghost you're talking about and i thought i am the holy ghost i taught all kinds of different things i thought when i believed that god said he said unto what were you baptized what is paul doing he's contending for the faith he said i know you believe but have you received the holy ghost since you believed what is paul doing contending for the faith i'm done with the teaching parts everybody feeling fine this morning give the lord a hand to praise we're doing good we're doing very good this morning so when you read the book of jude and i've already passed half of the message so we're gonna begin to head towards the finish line here now jude said that that that man of reprobate minds came in and and brought these problems and anointed once at the end time but the branham said reprobate janice and jamborees as they withstood moses we have these second timothy three spirits having a form of godliness but denying the power denying the power of salvation the power of deliverance the power of worship the power of the baptism of the holy ghost the power of dynamics and then anointing one of the end times with the balance and here come paul right behind him saying now in the last days there will come religious people having a form of godliness and lead silly woman led away with all kinds of worldly lusts now as janice and chambers but still moses so were these reprobate reprobate minds concerning the faith that's a prophet not a faith defeat one feet one lord one bap you can't have one faith without believing in one lord you can't have two baptisms not one for the father and son and the holy ghost one baptism this is the prophet now here is your promise in jehovah gyra as the church of god as the evening lights are beginning to shine and the tree is getting ripe god said he would restore that tree that same pentecostal tree same kind of fate same everything that they had that tree will be restored again without denomination without anything it will come in the simple power of the holy spirit teaching the bible just exactly the way it did we promise one in the last days you know to come and restore the faith i believe he's here tonight in the form of the holy spirit amen can the church say amen so when god is ready to do something you always have to raise up a prophet isn't that right when god was ready to deliver he raised up moses when god was ready to anoint a king he raised up samuel when god is breaking knowledge has come and he raised up isaiah when he was ready to weep you raised up jeremiah when god is right there establish the faith he raised up jesus and when god is ready to restore the faith you raised up william mary and branham and in each age god had a voice it was by faith that each man spoke but before god could get to brother branham because that early church fell and men crept in and they fall gradually to fall away from their faith until the church was powerless until it was formal until people just come on a sunday because they're supposed to be in church and the church that god built on the day of pentecost ceased to exist amen amen so god had to restore but before he could send that great mighty prophet malachi 4 he had to start somewhere so he start with luther and what is luther's message the just shall live by faith because we are going back to defeat so he's announcing it early here's where we're going we're going back to the faith that just shall live by faith in the resume of the ages brother branham said and now it says god is going to restore but ibraham said the lutheran age did not restore the church it started a reformation the wesleyan age did not restore the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word he said this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning now notice in verse 25 song about joel 2 25 it tells why we need restoration the locust the cankerworm the caterpillar and palmerwoom have eaten all but the roots and a little bit of the stem but now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false doctrine through the ages and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring his original planting back to original seed he is doing it as he stated in verse 23 by the teaching of former rain next we'll come to harvest rain or rapturing fate and that's what we're looking for rapturing fate i said to a brother yesterday i said at the end of the day it doesn't matter how many of the quotes we know none of that matters if you miss a rapture because we'll be bridging the tribulation so we need to have that rapture in faith because that's what it would take for us to leave here somebody say amen so god sent that prophet to restore the church i remember the branham king he contended for the fate that was delivered to the saints that's why he came and he blasted bullheads he blasted women preachers he blasted women who cut their hair and the makeup and the nomination and interpretation and he brought the promises the same signs the same wonders the same miracles what was he doing contending for the faith what are we doing this morning contending for the faith can the church say amen and when but the panel reached his new ministry for the first time since adam there were the words let there be why because of faith was restored when jesus walked the earth he took fish and multiply fish he take bread and multiply bread but that prophet stood there and said let there be a squirrel out of the invisible came something visible because the fate the original fate the fade way back down in genesis that was delivered to the saints on the day of pentecost was now restored in our day let there be a squirrel sun come out and shine four days before the doctor's hand touches my wife that's to restore faith in action and that restored faith will be manifested in this church it will be manifested among you hallelujah and the church say man everybody feeling fine you maybe see there speaking of malachi 4 but i'm saying in the evening messenger he says but remember this other one talking about malachi 4 was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original bible he said listen that's exactly what moses done that's exactly what jesus done that's what exactly every messenger done through the bible at the end of that dispensation they restored back the message the people true organization and things got all scrupled up and everything in them days um said they have done the same thing today can the church say amen so i am encouraging you church this morning as we close this year into the new year faith will make you begin to do what you didn't realize you could do and no matter what your trial no matter what your test whatever the situation faith will make you count the things that are not as though they were and i'm on a great expectation looking for a restored faith in a restored church in a message uncertain sound but the bible said behold i'll send you a light to the prophet before that great and terrible day shall destroy the world he restored the heart of the children back to the original fate back to the gospel back to the power of god back to the real holy spirit back to christ again before that great day comes we hear the trumpet sounding oh my what is it can the church say amen from a message god hasn't provided a way but the brandon said what am i saying god's provided away walk in god's provided away he has provided us a messenger of the holy ghost he has provided us a word and if any spirit speaks contrary to the word it can't be the holy ghost because the holy ghost wrote the word in the beginning in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word of god is sharper than a two-headed sword but evan said cuts all the worldly flesh off of you is there anybody want to see the worldly flesh cut off and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i will restore say the lord a high way a highway and a way and it shall be called a way of holiness and the unclean shall not walk in it you better clean up today listen to the prophet you can't walk with hollywood and with the church at the same time you can't walk with god and the world at the same time you can love god and mammon at the same time but the man said what we need today is not more organization more memberships but we need a church cleaning from the pulpit to the janitor and a good old-fashioned saint paul's revival and the bible holy ghost and the people back walking in god's provided way god has a provided way let's walk in it can the church say amen what are we doing this morning contending for that faith that has been restored by malachi 4. in the message the evil messenger bring back the church to the word now what is this messenger of malachi fought to do respawn back the original fate the resurrection fate that they see jesus after he raised from the dead seen him working among them so that's what we are looking for to see jesus working among us healing the sick saving the sinner pouring out the holy ghost confirming the word with signs oneness and miracles can the church say man so every trial every test every situation you have is here to build that experience so you could have faith and that faith has to keep growing david had faith based on the lion and the bear so when goliath came up he had the faith to deal with goliath because he knew god took him to the lion and the bear so you have to look at your trials and testings from a different perspective to see it as an opportunity for god to build your fate with your target being rapture and fate perfect fate so that you can leave this place can the church say amen i'm about to begin to wind down now hallelujah it takes fate to do the impossible it takes faith to push back the demons it takes faith and the bible said without failures is impossible to please god there are people sitting in church and they don't have faith they read the bible and they don't have faith some leave their hands and they still don't have faith but without faith it's impossible to please god in the book of mark chapter 2 here it is jesus has a contention with the pharisees and it became the past that and it came to pass in in mark chapter 2 verse 2 and it came to pass that he went through the corn field on the sabbath day and the disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day do that which is not lawful you see the fellows believed on the way there why on the sabbath day they're picking corn when they're not supposed to do that in somebody and i love jesus response jesus say oliver is so ignorant jesus says to them have you never read if you want to bring the law to me have you never read and and now more than ever as i see the word unfolding but have you never read what the prophet said before you go around saying things have you have you ever read so jesus was i left jesus class with it you know amen now listen the problem they had it wasn't a problem with him you know they probably was with the disciples they really should have gone to the disciples and said oh they shouldn't do this but he said to come to jesus christ they're looking for issue with jesus jesus how we can let your disciples pick corn when is his sabbath day and jesus say have you never read listen to jesus have you ever read what david did when he had need and was a hunger he and data were with him how he went into the house of god in the days of abithiya the high priest and they'd eat the shoe bread which is unlawful to eat but the priests and give all to them that were with him and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and none man for the sabbath therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath but that's a background for the situation i'm trying to get to that's that that's not the real issue you know after jesus deals with that he goes to mark chapter three and jesus the bible says entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there with a withered hand and listen and they the pharisees watch him whether he would heal him on the sabbath that they might accuse him so clearly what jesus said to them in mark chapter two the message did not hit home and i want to speak in this as i get ready i'm losing my voice i want to speak as i get ready to close out here because this here is this real story of fate as you read jesus's miracles jesus heals the sick he does a blinder he does different things he he tell them go their daughters well but this situation is is different here you have a man in the synagogue he's in the church he's not in the world he's in the church and he has a withered hand he can't lift his under worship he can't reach for anything he can clap he can't hold a microphone he has a withered hand his hand his feet are not withered so he can walk around but when he reaches what he needs to do he can do nothing about it amen because his hand is with it amen his eyes are not withered so he could see things but he can't touch it because his hand is withered his mind is not withered so he could hear things and he could understand things but he can't touch the concepts of what his mind prepares because his hand is with it he would look around the church in the synagogue and see people with their normal hands and he would know what to do but he can do it because his hand is with it and the pharisees knew that this man was in the church with his withered hand and they're watching jesus because they know jesus has a tendency to heal people somehow when jesus gets in a room with sick people his nature is to heal them so there is the wizard man the man with the withered hand and there is jesus and there's the pharisees looking on looking to see if jesus would heal him on the sabbath day so they could accuse him they have the accusation papers already written up just waiting for the stamp the signature to say you are guilty and when you read the bible and and i share this on wednesday when god speaks he can take back his own word because he speaks and the word cannot return void to when god pronounced judgment now this is powerful when god pronounced judgment he can't even take it back so he makes a way of escape so jesus in his wisdom understand the setup that's why the bible says we are ignorant of satan's devices and this is the power of fate here this is one of the only times in scripture where jesus doesn't say you are healed go that way jesus looks at the man and says stretch out your hand in other words there are some things a man with a weird hand is not supposed to be able to do but i want you to reach into some feet and stretch out your hand he didn't tell you are he he said just stretch and there's some people here this morning you just the word is anyone only need to do is hallelujah you may be seated i hope this helps somebody because there are people in here sitting down with withered hands withered finances children with it life withered joy withered peace of mind with it and they're sitting in the synagogue looking for jesus and the devil is there saying how could you do this on such a day because today is not the day to heal them but god is saying this morning stretch out your hand and there's something else about this situation that's powerful when your hand gets withered or crippled your bone density begins to decline so it means over time the bible doesn't tell us how long his hand was with it but he really would never had full bone function the substance of his hand was missing but fate is the substance and standing in front of this man was defeat these substance itself as this man was stretching out his hand see it as the substance of what we hope for the evidence of what we cannot see can the church say amen isn't there joy from reading the scriptures reading the prophet listen in a time when ministers preaching ideas and conclusions and dreams and visions and nightmares we have scriptures and quotes from the prophet to keep us well fed keeps us fat and sassy knowing that our god is a god mike i feel like david my cop running over holy goodness and mercy shall follow me all the taste of my life i'm not going to be much longer this is my closing message for this year so everything i had felt penned up for the holy ghost must pour out we must have dynamics we must have a super church a super race as we near the headstone and your family is going to be delivered your son is coming back your daughter is coming back your loved one is coming back the same god who wrote the word is able to bring it to pass because we are preaching the restored faith this morning so that man faith made him hold and i love it the pharisees couldn't accuse him verse sixes and the pharisees went forth and straight away took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy it because jesus yes you can trap jesus it's only when jesus said his time is ready to be trapped and that you could trap him and even tell him was a setup because if the devil only knew he was going to rise again he said send security to keep him alive so when they came home jesus said my always not come don't worry they can't touch me yet but he said when the time is coming second latest life down and i can pick it up again and when i pick it up i'm picking it up because i want to deliver the fate because the same works i do you're gonna do also i'm greater than i do because i go unto my father but i'm not gonna leave you comfortless i will come to you as a prophet malachi 4. i'll come to you as the holy spirit i'll come to you as faith virtue knowledge temperance patience holiness probably kindness charity you may be seated i'm beginning to close out musicians and get ready for my message condemnation my representation but the brandon said father this is a prayer so is it now at the near coming of jesus again just like the vine he said if the vine puts forth a branch and that branch was a pentecostal branch filled with the holy oats and signs and wonders of fruits follow that branch if that vine ever puts another branch it'll be the same kind of branch we know that father by nature itself and we do know that you can graft any fruit that's pertaining to that into that vine and it will live by the vine and we know that you can take an orange tree and grow citrus fruits of different kinds seven or eight we can put lemons in it it'll go right in because it's a citrus fruit it'll grow grapefruit and many other tangerines and many other citrus fruits but if that tree bring forth its own branch again it will be an orange lord it will be like the first one was and we believe that there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and latter rain it will be scattered throughout the world in this layout see an age it'll be a church that's called back to the original feat in god it'll be a church and have jesus christ walking in it manifesting himself the shout of the king will be in it can the church say amen i'm getting ready to close out hallelujah give the lord a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah and i truly believe this is our time now and we know seven thunders get fit and i believe this is we are in our 41st year 41st year because september 20th 1974 the revelation of the seven is broke and there's something about the number 41. so from some decept from september 20th 1974 to september 20 2014 we broke into the 41st year in the days of noah it rained for 40 days 40 nights but on the 41st day it was over the children of israel walked around the wilderness for 40 years but in the 41st year they went in jesus was in the wilderness for 40 days but on the 41st day he returned in the power of the spirit and for 40 years from september 1974 to this year we have now broken into the 41st year brother you have no idea what god is about to do the power of the church is about to rise is that why we could call for a seventh time the revival convention next year looking for the manifestation of those seven thundering voices to that group who could take the word and hand it here brother you should be rejoicing let us stand our feet this morning oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah in the message jehovah jaira and there's about three quotes and we close out but ibrahim said but we're still waiting for that something hallelujah we are still waiting but that's something that's going to take the fate that's something that's what i'm looking for but terry that's something that'll take the fate and restore the fate of the children back to the original pentecostal tree that the cankerworm eat up the roman kangaroom caterpillar all the denominations increased eaten down god said i will restore it again in the last days and it will be restored listen god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted wood that will restore hallelujah he didn't say i may send it he said god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted word and i believe we have received planted word the true word of god spiritual food and now we are waiting for the holy ghost itself to drop down hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how do you feel church you feel it coming on do you see the clouds getting ready to form because the rain is about to fall listen in the restoration of the bright tree but ibrahim said now that tree that joel spoke about here see it cannot die the worms eat it down but it couldn't die because in its root it had the predestinated truth and you cannot die you might be dried up this morning you might have no leaves this morning you might have no branches this morning you might have no park this morning it might look as if there's no life this morning but deep down in the roots the part that nobody could see sister maryland nobody could see it but down inside of there there's a predestination seed that kept you coming for this whole year it kept you alive and god is saying i am going to restore that original fate back to you i'm going to give you the same signs the same wonders the same power but ibrahim said all the bugs can never stop up no communism nothing will stop it i will restore say it to lord there will be an easter so nothing could stop you you could even miss this service if you wanted to something called you something pulled you something pulled you but now the holy ghost is here give the lord a sound of praise to give us faith for divine healing fit for the holy ghost fit for your family fit for the rapture i feel pentecostal this morning i'm looking for that sin killing sky blue holy ghost all pouring to pour the lip is anybody feels that way this morning that we need a sky blue sin killing holy ghost revival boil the trash out the church and bring the seeds to life for all these years we have waited but we are in the 41st year and god is gonna pour the holy ghost up make no mistake about it god is going to pour out the holy ghost upon planted word and you are going to bring forth seven thundering voices you're going to bring forth a living fate somebody give god a shout our praise so headstone tabernacle i salute you for standing with the message of monaca
