[27:19] appreciate you amen the time of worship
[27:22] now we want to switch over to the word
[27:24] now and um let's take our Bibles we want
[27:28] to read just one small portion of
[27:29] scripture in Genesis
[27:31] and um
[27:35] praise God we
[27:37] Genesis 22 okay
[27:40] um
[27:46] from Genesis 22 reading from verse 10
[27:52] this is Abraham open up Isaac right and
[27:54] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[27:56] took the knife to slay his son
[27:58] and the angel of the Lord called out uh
[28:02] called unto him out of heaven and said
[28:04] Abraham Abraham
[28:07] and he said here am I
[28:09] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[28:11] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[28:15] for now I know that thou fear is God
[28:19] seeing that thou has not withheld thy
[28:22] son thine only son from me
[28:25] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[28:27] looked and behold him
[28:30] a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns
[28:34] and Abraham went and took the RAM and
[28:37] offered him up for a burnt offering
[28:39] instead of his son
[28:41] and verse 14 for a text and Abraham
[28:44] called the name of that place Jehovah
[28:46] Jireh as it is said to this day in the
[28:50] Mount of the Lord it shall be seen may
[28:53] God have blessing to the reading of his
[28:55] wound let's just pray one more time as
[28:57] we get ready to have a seat Heavenly
[28:59] Father
[28:59] Lord we thank you for your word Lord
[29:02] that you have given us throughout all
[29:04] ages father and even to this day Lord
[29:07] your word Remains the Same we thank you
[29:10] for it Lord father it is life to our
[29:12] souls it it is bread for us Lord father
[29:14] Lord we pray now that you would anoint
[29:17] it and Inspire to our hearts Lord bless
[29:19] the people that gathered here Lord you
[29:21] know the different needs Lord you know
[29:23] the different things going on in our
[29:25] lives but I pray father that you give us
[29:27] a word in due season Lord I will truly
[29:29] minister to our hearts and give us
[29:31] strength for the journey Lord father
[29:32] Lord give us Grace to stand Lord give us
[29:35] power in all you know you know in our
[29:38] workload father or Lord let us help us
[29:40] to see something tonight Lord that would
[29:43] hope change us for the better grant us
[29:45] almighty God now as we enter into your
[29:47] word now and Lord we pray for a few
[29:49] minutes that you take a hold of us Lord
[29:50] in Jesus let me pray and ask it amen and
[29:53] amen you don't have your seats praise
[30:06] okay praise God well
[30:09] feels good
[30:11] to be here tonight
[30:13] we never we never take it for granted
[30:16] amen
[30:17] uh serving the lord
[30:19] amen and it means so much to us here how
[30:22] much more will it mean over there Amen
[30:25] on the other side when you take your
[30:27] stand with Jesus
[30:28] then he'll take his stand with you amen
[30:31] so we certainly thank God for the
[30:32] privilege to be called the sons of God
[30:36] amen so now I have a title tonight
[30:38] and my title is the god of testimony
[30:43] the god
[30:44] of testimony
[30:46] and um
[30:48] that's reading this scripture here was
[30:50] just to give us a context of it
[30:52] and we know that there's many other
[30:54] places in the Bible where God
[30:57] revealed himself
[30:59] where God showed himself
[31:02] to be strong
[31:03] to be a provider to be a protector
[31:07] and we know that before everything was
[31:10] created God sat Alone by himself
[31:12] and he always desired to want to do
[31:14] these things
[31:15] but there was no way for him to do it
[31:17] because there was nothing yet created
[31:19] for him to perform his work on
[31:22] and to show that he had the ability to
[31:24] do it isn't that right but when things
[31:27] unfolded on the earth we see now God can
[31:30] now step in the Gap as it will and
[31:33] become the things that we needed the
[31:35] most
[31:36] when we needed a Healer he was there
[31:38] when he needed a deliverer he was there
[31:40] when we needed a provider he was there
[31:44] so to me
[31:46] what I'm seeing is that God isn't just
[31:49] calling them himself these things
[31:52] because he feeling to call himself
[31:54] something
[31:55] it isn't just like a job that you print
[31:57] on a business card
[31:58] he calls himself these things because he
[32:01] has done it once
[32:03] and he will do it again
[32:05] he's the god of testimony he is the God
[32:09] of all lives isn't that right
[32:12] and God actually proves himself
[32:15] by his testimony in our lives in the
[32:19] lives of His prophets and the lives of
[32:22] his handmaidens in the lives of his
[32:25] servants in the lives of his people he
[32:28] actually proved himself to be the things
[32:30] that he called himself isn't that right
[32:32] so we're not it's not a frivolous
[32:34] activity it is not by chance we call him
[32:37] a Healer but we call him a Healer
[32:40] because he has performed healing
[32:42] before and if he has done it before he
[32:46] can do it again
[32:47] if he has healed in times past he can do
[32:50] it again tonight if he has delivered in
[32:53] times past he can do it again tonight if
[32:56] he has healed if he has restored if he
[32:59] has created in times past the same God
[33:02] that spoke and created a human body is
[33:06] the same God that can fix what's wrong
[33:09] with that same human body he is the
[33:12] Creator and we call him Creator because
[33:15] he has created oh and he will create
[33:18] again created me occur a clean heart he
[33:24] can do it tonight oh because he is a God
[33:28] of testimony oh Hallelujah glory to God
[33:33] is
[33:36] so we understand even the Ark of the
[33:38] Covenant that the Israelites carried
[33:40] isn't that right throughout their
[33:41] Journeys and and Jordan Jerusalem was
[33:44] also called The Ark of testimony
[33:46] and in that Arc we're artifacts
[33:50] isn't that right the tablets of Moses
[33:52] and the rod of iron isn't that right
[33:53] there were things in there and those
[33:56] things that were put in there wasn't
[33:58] just put for style or just because we
[34:01] were feeling to to to to throw some
[34:03] things in there to because it was empty
[34:05] but those things are in there because
[34:07] those are realities those things are
[34:10] there to remind us that God with his own
[34:13] hand wrote in those tablets of stones
[34:16] thou shall not kill thou shall not covet
[34:20] your neighbor's wife and so forth right
[34:22] thou shall not commit adulthood the hand
[34:24] of God come now and wrote unto Moses
[34:27] praise God and said give this to the
[34:29] children of Israel and those things are
[34:31] in there as a testimony that these are
[34:35] the Commandments of God oh hallelujah
[34:38] hallelujah and it ought to give the
[34:40] Israelite such a fate it was there to
[34:42] give the Hebrew a reminder that the
[34:44] court that was with them in the desert
[34:46] is the same God that is with them in the
[34:49] promised land the same quarter was with
[34:52] their fathers the same God I was with
[34:54] Moses when he transport is Rod and split
[34:58] open the Red Sea that God was real then
[35:01] and he's still real today that God could
[35:06] still deliver your family that God could
[35:09] still heal your children that God could
[35:12] still provide for you that God could
[35:15] still make a way out of nowhere when all
[35:19] hope was lost and when the children of
[35:22] Israel's back was against the war when
[35:24] there was between a rock and a hard
[35:26] place oh and it seemed like there was no
[35:28] way out when there was Mountain on both
[35:31] sides when there was a Red Sea in front
[35:33] of them when there was an angry Pharaoh
[35:36] behind them that same card come down in
[35:41] the form of a pillar of fire and that
[35:43] same God opened the Red Sea that is not
[35:48] a choke that is not a fairy tale that is
[35:51] a reality and tonight we are moving into
[35:54] a reality that same God is going to
[35:58] manifest himself one more time in a
[36:02] bride on the Earth in our people on the

[38:53] whatever we had need of
[38:55] Jehovah jvhu is not right praise God I

[39:00] and he filled in the blanks
[39:03] by each prophet's testimony
[39:05] by each servant's testimony by each
[39:08] Witness by the witness of Hannah isn't
[39:11] that right praise God he was Barren
[39:13] praise God but she believed in God oh
[39:16] she was parents she couldn't bring four
[39:18] children she was grown and she was
[39:21] crying oh Hallelujah she was under
[39:25] pressure oh Hallelujah pressure from her
[39:28] family praise God because the other wife
[39:30] was teasing her bitter teasing her sore
[39:33] because of her barrenness pray but I
[39:36] admire Hannah she didn't take it out on
[39:38] the other way she didn't become a mean
[39:40] and nasty and bitter person she went to
[39:44] God with her trouble she went to the
[39:47] temple with her sorrow she went to the
[39:50] temple she didn't go to Facebook come on
[39:52] now she didn't go to the website she
[39:55] didn't write a letter she didn't
[39:57] complain to the Ombudsman that she
[40:00] didn't get what she asked for she went
[40:02] to God with her troubles that's what we
[40:04] need to do we need to turn to God when
[40:08] things not working out oh Hallelujah
[40:10] when things not going our way oh
[40:13] Hallelujah I worry we can't seem to see
[40:15] our way we need to bring it to the Lord
[40:18] and Hannah brought it to the Lord oh
[40:21] with weeping with Cronin to the point of
[40:23] which she couldn't even express herself
[40:26] and then the priest comes in
[40:28] what's wrong and she poured out her
[40:30] complaint isn't that right and he gave
[40:32] our word in due season he said go please
[40:35] be no more trouble isn't that right and
[40:38] from that time on she changed her
[40:40] attitude from that time on she changed
[40:42] her approach nothing can happen yet but
[40:45] it was something happened in her mind
[40:46] something happened in our Spirits from
[40:49] that encounter something took place and
[40:52] the right mental attitude towards any
[40:54] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[40:57] pass and all of a sudden at an appointed
[41:00] time another point today she was visited
[41:03] isn't that right Praise on she brought
[41:05] forth a son isn't that right oh
[41:07] Hallelujah and then she gave up
[41:09] testimony isn't that right praise isn't
[41:13] that right oh the Lord high and lifted
[41:15] up he's the one in charge he bringing
[41:18] down Kings and he raises up Kings for
[41:21] his name's sake hallelujah's God can do
[41:25] whatever he want to she knew that God
[41:28] was in control because she experienced
[41:30] something she went through something and
[41:33] God uses the Pains of our experiences to
[41:37] bring out certain qualities in us that
[41:40] are down deep tongue inside you don't
[41:43] even know what is inside of you tonight
[41:45] but God is going to use the pain of your
[41:48] circumstance God is going to use the
[41:51] bitterness of others or let it
[41:54] persecuting you reviling you God's gonna
[41:57] pass you to Destroyer pass you to this
[42:00] test he'll let you stay here for a
[42:02] little while and suffer it for a little
[42:04] while so that you could learn the
[42:07] patience of God that you could learn the
[42:09] tenderness of God that you could learn
[42:11] how to have forgiveness how to have love
[42:14] in spite your situation and sometimes
[42:17] God will ever let you move on
[42:20] until you learn the lesson
[42:23] he don't ever let you move on
[42:26] until you learn
[42:27] to be obedient
[42:29] until Joseph's work came
[42:32] the word of the Lord Tried Him
[42:34] isn't that right
[42:38] I'm sure Joseph show up his hand many
[42:40] times and say Lord I understand no I get
[42:42] it
[42:42] and prison head
[42:44] I get it I learned my lesson
[42:47] I'm ready to come out now already
[42:48] already Lord I think I stay long enough
[42:52] I know this person inside out
[42:54] I know every wall every crack every
[42:56] crevice I know where every room is I can
[42:58] do it blindfold
[42:59] I think I learned my lesson
[43:02] and God's still saying wait some more
[43:04] time
[43:05] with some more time
[43:07] wait a little while longer
[43:09] because he's trying Joseph
[43:11] because you have a position for Joseph
[43:13] to fulfill
[43:15] in order for Joseph to go into that
[43:17] position Joseph himself have to be
[43:20] qualified for it because God not going
[43:23] to risk putting an unqualified man in a
[43:27] job praise God where he's unqualified
[43:29] for that job God had to qualify you for
[43:31] that you can't just walk in there just
[43:33] land under this take up whatever
[43:34] position no no no God's got to make sure
[43:37] you pass through all the tests and you
[43:40] have to do well to get to the next step
[43:42] and to The Next Step you're not there
[43:45] yet but at every trial he's shaping you
[43:48] with every trial you're learning new
[43:50] things with every trial you're getting
[43:52] more mature you're getting more ripened
[43:55] you're learning how to lean how to lean
[43:58] on Jesus how to lean on his word god
[44:01] take a material things away from you he
[44:04] take house away from you you take this
[44:06] away from you somebody remove family
[44:08] members for his name's sake because you
[44:12] are the elect of God oh because he loved
[44:15] you before the beginning oh Hallelujah
[44:17] the porn knowledge of God knew that you
[44:20] would pass through trials pass through
[44:23] tests pass through discouragement pass
[44:25] through persecution pass through hatred
[44:27] though he slay me yet I trust them
[44:30] something inside your soul oh keep
[44:33] standing a test I will keep holding on
[44:35] to the reins despite the storm that the
[44:39] enemy may try to send in your will oh
[44:41] Hallelujah by God used in circumstance
[44:45] to bring out something special
[44:48] locked up inside of you oh hallelujah's
[44:52] night
[44:52] my
[44:57] so what what when inspired is thought
[44:59] tonight was a
[45:00] you know I was listening to
[45:03] one of the things right I was listening
[45:04] to um
[45:05] some scientists
[45:07] interesting I listened to some scientist
[45:09] debate
[45:11] and quite recently I've discovered that
[45:14] there are two schools of thought
[45:16] in the world of science
[45:18] there's a group that believed the
[45:20] evolutionist Theory which is that man
[45:22] evolved from monkeys and the Big Bang
[45:24] Theory and that whole thing that you'll
[45:26] hear but then there's also another
[45:27] school of scientists who believe the
[45:31] Bible
[45:32] and they believe everything that it says
[45:34] and I believe that science proves what
[45:37] is written in the Bible every single
[45:39] time praise God unable to prove it and
[45:41] so forth and they go back and forth with
[45:43] different arguments and different
[45:44] discussions and they have really
[45:46] interesting discussions because here's
[45:49] one scientist bringing the word of God
[45:50] God created the world in in seven days
[45:53] and so forth like that and he's showing
[45:54] in the scripture and then another one is
[45:56] saying when I look at science look at
[45:58] the stars look at space look at that
[46:00] look at Anatomy look at astronomy praise
[46:03] God all these things are telling us
[46:04] different things and they can't seem to
[46:05] put it together
[46:06] and I thought to myself while listening
[46:09] I said my God isn't God amazing isn't
[46:12] God incredible
[46:14] he praise God because with every
[46:15] argument they kept presenting I was
[46:18] listening to it and saying look how
[46:20] amazing God is look how incredible God
[46:23] is how many planets there are in the
[46:25] universe and yet God chose this planet
[46:28] how many people there are on this planet
[46:30] and yet God chose you yet God throws me
[46:34] God Accord of the universe he still know
[46:37] the time every flight uh every uh uh fly
[46:41] but its eye he know that His Eye Is on
[46:44] the Sparrow he knows how many feathers
[46:47] on the wings of an eagle amen amen he
[46:50] knows where you are right now he knows
[46:52] what you're going through the great God
[46:54] that created everything knows what's
[46:57] going on with you tonight
[47:01] and one of them one of them made an
[47:03] argument about uh Noah and they was
[47:05] talking about the ship and they were
[47:07] saying that how they was asking the
[47:09] question how is it that a man with no
[47:13] formal ship building education
[47:15] a man who was supposedly a farmer a
[47:19] sheep Hooda some guy out in the desert
[47:22] somewhere how was he able to build a
[47:26] ship that big
[47:28] to let it float on the water 40 days and
[47:31] 40 nights how was it able to stay afloat
[47:35] they asked the question how was it able
[47:37] to stay intact as far as they know there
[47:40] was a ship just a little less bigger
[47:42] than the ark they say the best mines
[47:44] tried to build that ship and the waves
[47:46] still cracked the ship at the center
[47:48] they still trying to figure out how a
[47:51] sheep heard her how a farmer was able to
[47:54] do that he had no formal education he's
[47:57] not a scientist he's not an engineer
[47:59] what intelligence gave that man the
[48:02] ability to build a ship to house eight
[48:06] people and all of the animals on the
[48:09] planet I said that could only be God oh
[48:13] Hallelujah all is not your mind it's not
[48:16] your education it's not what you have
[48:18] done it's what he wants to do in you
[48:21] you've got to surrender yourself oh come
[48:24] on now oh it's not about your education
[48:28] it's not about your ability oh oh
[48:31] hallelujah oh hallelujah oh yes yes yes
[48:36] that's why he bypass the learned it
[48:38] that's why he bypassed the wise that's
[48:41] why he bypassed the prudence and he
[48:43] revealed himself to babes such as would
[48:46] learn that's why he bypassed the pig I
[48:49] know high and mighty in the world and he
[48:52] come to you tonight because you had the
[48:55] ability to hear from God that's the only
[48:59] reason you could hear from God tonight
[49:01] is because he predestinated you tonight
[49:05] science is still trying to figure it out
[49:07] they can't figure out how a ship floats
[49:10] and they can't figure out how you are
[49:12] here tonight they can't figure out how
[49:14] your behavior is changing they can't
[49:16] figure out how your nature is changing
[49:18] you once was a sinner but you step out
[49:21] of that something in your heart heard
[49:24] the gospel they can't explain that that
[49:27] comes from God anything that you cannot
[49:30] explain is Supernatural activity and
[49:33] that's what's going on upon you tonight
[49:35] there's no science there's no School of
[49:39] Theology there's nothing that could
[49:40] figure out what's going on in here
[49:43] tonight it is God that is doing the work
[49:46] it is the work of the spirit he can turn
[49:49] water into wine he can turn your old try
[49:54] hard he can take all that Stony Heart
[49:56] Like We heard on Sunday isn't that right
[49:58] we put our eyes like over it he can take
[50:00] out that Stony heart and give you a
[50:03] heart of Flesh I have to love him
[50:10] in the work
[50:14] oh science can't figure it out there's
[50:17] no math book there's no copy book
[50:19] there's no internet text there's no
[50:21] phone you can figure it out the fastest
[50:23] fastest fastest computer can't figure it
[50:26] out tonight
[50:27] that's God at work
[50:30] that's God on the move
[50:34] and one of them explained he said
[50:37] he said they're trying to figure out the
[50:38] god of the Bible
[50:39] saying where's this God and what does he
[50:41] look like what is he made of he said
[50:43] well you're talking about the wrong God
[50:46] the problem is you think this God is in
[50:48] your mind
[50:49] but this God is not in in this natural
[50:51] realm he's in the Supernatural praise
[50:54] God there's no man and he said there's
[50:56] no man inside the computer trying to to
[50:57] move it around to move all the numbers
[51:00] there's no man running around inside
[51:01] here trying to change everything the man
[51:04] that created his computer is outside of
[51:05] the computer and he just operates the
[51:07] computer every time he need to well then
[51:09] that is how God is he is outside of your
[51:12] world and he intervenes every time he
[51:14] needs to praise God hallelujah he can go
[51:17] within without he can see the backside
[51:18] the front side the upside the downside
[51:20] he can see your hand he can see your
[51:22] beginning he could scroll through the
[51:24] pages of your book and see where you are
[51:26] now see where you will be see where you
[51:28] was oh Allah is good we're talking about
[51:31] past present and future all the same to
[51:34] him tonight you only living in an
[51:36] instance you are living in a moment but
[51:39] he knows every moment he knows every
[51:41] instance he is caught Almighty tonight
[51:43] you're just coming through it but he
[51:46] knows you overcome the battle you're
[51:48] still coming through it but he knows you
[51:50] overcome the test he already sees you
[51:52] Victorious he already saw David with a
[51:55] sword in his hand before God ever stole
[51:58] the Goliath I'll jump his head off
[52:06] oh my he knows everything
[52:10] and just like we are able to read the
[52:11] stories of the Bible the stories of the
[52:14] lives of these men of God and scroll
[52:16] through and see how God brought their
[52:18] expected end it's the same way God is
[52:21] going through your story tonight
[52:23] and he's gonna bring you to your
[52:25] expected end it's going to be glorious
[52:27] it's a vision that he's unfolding to you
[52:30] tonight and regardless of where you are
[52:32] of how you see yourself let that Vision
[52:36] inspire you this this evening to set a
[52:39] path towards that Vision praise God and
[52:41] don't let nothing distract you tonight
[52:42] God wants to deliver you God wants to
[52:45] restore you God wants to free you as far
[52:48] as God is concerned in his mind he has
[52:51] already done it he's just waiting for
[52:53] you to come to the reality to come to
[52:56] yourself and when you come to yourself
[52:58] you recognize whose you are you
[53:01] recognize who you are and you recognize
[53:04] who God is and then after that nothing
[53:06] will stop you there's no obstacle that
[53:09] can stand in your way you'll fight
[53:11] through every devil you'll pressure
[53:12] every trial you'll get the service
[53:14] you'll get there on time you'll pray
[53:17] you'll do what you gotta do you'll
[53:19] worship oh Hallelujah because you've got
[53:22] a revelation
[53:28] tonight
[53:30] amen
[53:31] oh my
[53:33] so it got me thinking listen to all
[53:35] these scientists I realized that
[53:38] this is the world we live in
[53:41] highly intellectual age
[53:43] now more than ever we have access to
[53:45] information
[53:46] children have access to information that
[53:49] we never had at all age
[53:51] some of us are limited encyclopedias if
[53:54] we had encyclopedias you know homes or
[53:56] whatever isn't right are we able to go
[53:58] to the public library now it's on a cell
[54:01] phone
[54:01] a smartphone just pull it up so easy
[54:04] it's at their fingertips I know it's so
[54:07] easy to question things now children
[54:09] question things more than ever
[54:11] they want to know why
[54:13] they want to know how I could serve a
[54:15] God and I cannot see
[54:16] how is he that is he as real as he
[54:19] really is and all these questions isn't
[54:21] that right and they begin to make me
[54:23] think that God really needs us because
[54:27] by our testimony by our lives he proves
[54:31] himself to be real
[54:33] faith is not something I can explain
[54:35] praise God hell is not something I could
[54:37] show you on a piece of paper I have to
[54:40] live it my Works have to show the faith
[54:43] that I express because faith without
[54:45] works is dead so if I say I have faith
[54:48] and I can't live this thing brother then
[54:50] I really need real Faith because real
[54:52] faith will stand on this word regardless
[54:55] of the circumstance regardless of the
[54:57] situation regardless of my feelings I
[55:00] lift my hands and I worship God
[55:02] hallelujah because it comes from inside
[55:05] of me because something Supernatural put
[55:08] it inside of me there's nothing that I
[55:10] can explain that there's nothing that
[55:12] could theorize that
[55:15] takes God to do it and the same God that
[55:18] did it for me is the same God I'll do it
[55:21] for you it's the same God I'll do it for
[55:23] your children it's the same God will do
[55:25] it for the young people the same super
[55:28] anointing the same pillar fire that
[55:30] touch your life after touch their life
[55:33] to the fire after come down and burn the
[55:36] devil out and burn the demons out burn
[55:39] the loss out burn the lies out we need
[55:43] the same fire oh Hallelujah
[55:46] that same fire to come down in The Souls
[55:50] of men to bring about a real change oh
[55:54] Hallelujah
[55:56] Hallelujah
[56:05] prison
[56:06] cannot change you
[56:08] can't transform people
[56:10] they try to reform people back into
[56:11] society
[56:12] but those same Spirits are there
[56:15] and sometimes they get worse
[56:17] when they come to prison
[56:19] all right oh that's so sad you tried to
[56:22] do all of the systems try to do to
[56:24] change man to make him different and
[56:26] better and make them contributors to
[56:29] their community and to education and to
[56:31] Society at large it has failed it will
[56:34] take God to change the hearts of man
[56:37] I understand when the Holy Spirit fell
[56:39] in Azusa Street the judges were wearing
[56:42] white gloves and judges and lawyers and
[56:44] so forth were wearing white gloves and
[56:47] that was to signify that they had no
[56:49] cases to see about there was no crime in
[56:52] the district isn't that right was the
[56:54] street I wanted to Revival isn't that
[56:55] right there was no crime there you know
[56:57] why because the Holy Spirit was moving
[57:00] in such a way that it was repellent
[57:03] demons it was repelling things Spirits
[57:06] upon people people even couldn't commit
[57:08] crime because waves of Glory was coming
[57:12] out from the Revival and I tell you
[57:14] Church there's gonna be such a Revival
[57:17] that will have an effect upon natural
[57:20] things God is gonna wake awaken us with
[57:23] such a supernatural move that is going

[1:03:27] he is what he is because he proved
[1:03:29] himself to be that
[1:03:31] Pine experience he's a Healer because he
[1:03:34] heals isn't that right and in order for
[1:03:36] you to have
[1:03:37] a testimony
[1:03:39] you have to pass through a test
[1:03:42] it's not right
[1:03:43] he's a god of testimony
[1:03:45] in order for you to have a testimony
[1:03:47] you've got to have a test first
[1:03:49] that's how you get the testimony isn't
[1:03:51] that right how can I overcome the
[1:03:53] prophet said now we're expecting to be
[1:03:55] tested that's a good lesson for my
[1:03:57] brother back there he said oh he that
[1:03:59] coming to God
[1:04:00] must first be tested
[1:04:03] tested Prophet seven what tested it what
[1:04:06] with the word
[1:04:07] that's God's test
[1:04:09] what can we say Amen he said he said you
[1:04:11] believe it Congress says amen he said he
[1:04:13] said well either coming to God must be
[1:04:14] tested that only shows a true child then
[1:04:19] he said that see that could be tested so
[1:04:21] you are a true child when you are tested
[1:04:24] that's right he said when the test comes
[1:04:26] on you can't overcome unless there were
[1:04:29] tests give to you
[1:04:31] and when the test is given it is to see
[1:04:34] what's the purpose to see whether you
[1:04:36] can overcome or not
[1:04:38] that's all it is God hold a challenge at
[1:04:41] you to see what your attitude will be
[1:04:43] God hurl a challenge or two to see if
[1:04:47] you'll overcome Jesus told the woman of
[1:04:49] the well go call your husband and sat
[1:04:52] and waited to see what she was going to
[1:04:55] say oh and by faith that woman said I

[1:05:01] truth oh Hallelujah honesty reach up oh

[1:05:26] testimony he opened his mouth he told

[1:06:44] in your heart he knows it right away
[1:06:48] gotta be real
[1:06:50] it's not mine
[1:06:53] where was I yeah so
[1:06:55] a test see to see what you'll do with it
[1:06:57] and then Jesus said to him that overcome
[1:06:59] it the test the test is the greatest
[1:07:01] thing
[1:07:03] wow
[1:07:05] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[1:07:07] you is the test you believe that's a
[1:07:09] nine I believe it's written in the
[1:07:12] scripture Peter said that all trials
[1:07:14] a word more to us than precious gold
[1:07:19] that parachute isn't that right a part
[1:07:21] of the Bible said gold might perish but
[1:07:24] your testings your trials that is the
[1:07:27] story brother that is the testimony
[1:07:29] brother when you get over to the other
[1:07:31] side you can't show them gold you can't
[1:07:34] show them silver but you could show them
[1:07:36] your tests you can show them your trial
[1:07:38] you can tell them about the mountain
[1:07:40] that you had to climb you could tell
[1:07:42] them about the valley that was so low
[1:07:45] you can tell them about when you lost
[1:07:47] this and when you overcame that and when
[1:07:50] you had to give up this and when you had
[1:07:52] to give up that but God was shaping
[1:07:54] something in my soul I didn't know it I
[1:07:58] didn't know I was going through I was
[1:08:00] hurting I was pleading I felt caught I
[1:08:04] felt bruised but it's only when he
[1:08:06] finished what he did in my soul I look
[1:08:09] back and I see the work that he did in
[1:08:11] me and you dance like David danced when
[1:08:14] you see what God has done in your life
[1:08:17] brother there's no more shame you're
[1:08:20] gonna dance like David turns when he saw
[1:08:24] the eye coming up the road when you see
[1:08:27] all your sins in the sea of
[1:08:29] forgetfulness when you see God break the
[1:08:33] devil off for you when you see God do
[1:08:35] something real in your life maybe not
[1:08:39] the person next to you maybe not the
[1:08:41] person in front of you but you know in
[1:08:44] your heart he did something for you
[1:08:46] brother you can't take my praise you
[1:08:49] can't take my Hallelujah every
[1:08:51] Hallelujah belongs to Jesus then oh
[1:08:57] hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[1:09:02] Hallelujah when Miriam saw all the
[1:09:05] Egyptians all the dead Egyptians
[1:09:08] floating in the Red Sea she got all the
[1:09:10] tambourine and she began to dance she
[1:09:13] began to shout she began to praise God
[1:09:16] when you see God deliver you from your
[1:09:19] enemies you can't help but praise God
[1:09:22] you can't have a child from your fall
[1:09:27] shop
[1:09:31] oh I don't know how else to say it but
[1:09:34] brother
[1:09:35] my
[1:09:39] Oh Glory
[1:09:51] one time Prophet said to God that is
[1:09:53] rich in Mercy
[1:09:55] he might be rich in other things gold
[1:09:58] and cattle and a cattle on a thousand
[1:10:00] hills but Prophet said I'm so glad
[1:10:03] that he's rich in Mercy Mercy stood in
[1:10:08] my place Mercy said no I'm not gonna let
[1:10:12] you go I'm not gonna let you slip away
[1:10:15] when the devil said look I got him I got
[1:10:18] her she's a sinner she deserved to die
[1:10:22] he deserved to be killed Mercy step in
[1:10:26] your place and said just a minute devil
[1:10:29] just hold right quick devil I've got a
[1:10:32] word for you I've got blood for you here
[1:10:35] was Mercy on the cross
[1:10:37] oh Hallelujah took your place
[1:10:41] took the keys of death and Hell shook
[1:10:44] everything
[1:10:45] oh Hallelujah
[1:10:52] one time
[1:10:54] one time Jesus asked his disciples
[1:10:56] he said which one
[1:10:58] there's a man who was forgiven of a
[1:10:59] small debt a man who's a favorite of
[1:11:01] great debt I'm paraphrased right he said
[1:11:03] which one do you think would praise him
[1:11:06] more
[1:11:07] which one do you think you'll love him
[1:11:08] or serve him more and he said he
[1:11:10] wondered who's forgiven more
[1:11:12] isn't that right
[1:11:13] praise God now I don't know tonight
[1:11:15] whether I was forgiven more
[1:11:18] or whether it's forgiven less but I know
[1:11:20] tonight how much he forgave me
[1:11:22] I know how much tonight he's done for me
[1:11:25] and my life and I'm gonna praise Him
[1:11:28] according to the good works that he has
[1:11:30] performed in my life because I've seen
[1:11:33] him overcome the enemy I've seen him
[1:11:36] take over the situation I see him save
[1:11:39] my life seconds before it happened I see
[1:11:43] him save my life he saved my family how
[1:11:47] can I help but praise him how can I help
[1:11:49] but worship when I see the hand of God
[1:11:52] the hand of Mercy oh Hallelujah and
[1:11:56] according to my testimony yet will I
[1:11:59] praise God
[1:12:01] while I have my being
[1:12:03] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:06] oh my God so we gotta have a testimony
[1:12:10] so that's why it's scary
[1:12:11] if you're not seeing
[1:12:14] the devil trying to destroy you
[1:12:16] because that's what he's supposed to be
[1:12:18] doing
[1:12:19] so if he's not after you tell yourself
[1:12:21] something is wrong pray with your
[1:12:23] Christian experience praise God Amen
[1:12:25] isn't that right and he will come into
[1:12:27] God must be tested and tried isn't it
[1:12:29] please go on Hallelujah so thank God for
[1:12:32] the test because it proves that there's
[1:12:35] a God out there somewhere
[1:12:36] who can fulfill his word to me praise
[1:12:39] God and give us the overcoming power
[1:12:41] isn't that right Oh my he said so
[1:12:43] Genesis 20 22 14 Abraham call out today
[1:12:46] call that name the place name that place
[1:12:48] Jehovah
[1:12:49] as it is said to this day the Mount of
[1:12:51] the Lord shall be seen it's not right
[1:12:54] Exodus
[1:12:56] I'll just give a few scriptures here
[1:12:58] this is the god of testimony isn't that
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:01] all throughout scripture he proves
[1:13:03] himself
[1:13:04] to be the things that he said he is
[1:13:06] isn't that right Jehovah Rapha he is the
[1:13:10] god that healeth all die diseases isn't
[1:13:14] that right
[1:13:15] according to Exodus 15 22 it says who
[1:13:17] Moses brought the children of Israel
[1:13:18] from the Red Sea and they went out to
[1:13:20] the Wilderness of sure and they went
[1:13:23] three days in the wilderness the Bible
[1:13:25] said they found no water and when they
[1:13:28] came to Mahar they could not drink up
[1:13:30] the Waters of Mars for they were bitter
[1:13:32] therefore the name of it was called Mara
[1:13:35] and the people murmured against Moses
[1:13:38] saying what shall we drink
[1:13:41] the Bible said and he cried unto the
[1:13:43] Lord oh for the answer praise God
[1:13:47] there's no water anywhere what do you do
[1:13:49] you got to do like Moses tonight
[1:13:52] let him cry out to the Lord tonight and
[1:13:55] he cried unto the Lord and the Lord
[1:13:57] showed him a tree which when he cast
[1:14:00] into the waters the waters were made
[1:14:03] sweet and there he made them a statue
[1:14:06] right there when that happened Moses and
[1:14:09] then made them a statue and an ordinance
[1:14:11] and there he proved them
[1:14:15] and he said if thou diligently hearken
[1:14:18] to the voice of the Lord thy God and
[1:14:21] will do that which is right in his sight
[1:14:22] and will give heir to his Commandments
[1:14:25] and keep all his statues amen the Bible
[1:14:27] says I will put none of these diseases
[1:14:30] upon thee which I have brought thee out
[1:14:32] from the Egypt from upon the Egyptians
[1:14:33] for I am the Lord that healeth thee amen
[1:14:38] right there in scripture he proves
[1:14:40] himself to be Jehovah Rapha and from
[1:14:42] that time he's still Jehovah Rapha oh
[1:14:45] he's Jehovah Rapha tonight he can heal
[1:14:48] you too much of every diseases I am the
[1:14:51] Lord that healeth Thee I am Jehovah
[1:14:55] Rapha oh reach up and grab him tonight
[1:14:57] if you need healing healing for your
[1:15:00] party healing for your spirit healing
[1:15:04] for your soul for the prophet said I'd

[1:15:15] holy spirit to make you well in your
[1:15:17] soul oh Hallelujah that you can meet God
[1:15:20] Amen I am the Lord the Amen in the rain
[1:15:23] again God proves himself to be Jehovah
[1:15:25] Nissi isn't that right he's our
[1:15:27] protector praise God isn't that right
[1:15:29] the scripture says yes so did so Joshua
[1:15:31] did as Moses said to him and fought
[1:15:33] amalek and Moses and Aaron and her went
[1:15:35] up on the top of the hill and it came to
[1:15:37] pass when Moses held up his hand that
[1:15:40] Israel prevailed and when he let down
[1:15:42] his hand amalek prevailed but Moses
[1:15:45] hands were heavy and so the Bible said
[1:15:47] it took a stone and they put it under
[1:15:50] him and he sat there on with his hands
[1:15:52] up with the stones holding the hands up
[1:15:54] and Aaron and her stayed up his hands
[1:15:57] the one on one side and the other on the
[1:16:01] other side and his hands were steady
[1:16:04] until the going down of the sun they
[1:16:07] made sure of their testimony they made
[1:16:10] sure that that praise was going up
[1:16:12] brother I don't care how where you
[1:16:14] sketch keep those hands up I don't care
[1:16:17] how dark it gets keep Hills hands up I
[1:16:21] don't care if the Sun is going down

[1:16:26] keep your worship up keep your praise up
[1:16:30] tonight don't let nothing stop you don't
[1:16:32] let the devil deceive you out of your
[1:16:35] praise keep praising keep worshiping
[1:16:38] keep pressing the battle keep calling on
[1:16:41] God keep crying out to him oh be like
[1:16:45] blind patamas they told him Jesus can't
[1:16:48] hear you although he cried higher he
[1:16:51] screamed higher he said Jesus help me oh
[1:16:56] and his voice didn't do it but his
[1:16:58] speech reached up to God and pull Jesus
[1:17:02] on the scene and tonight do something
[1:17:04] different cry out a little higher reach
[1:17:08] out a little louder and let your feet
[1:17:10] reach out tonight and grab a hold of
[1:17:13] Jesus while he is passing by tonight
[1:17:17] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:19] Oh Glory
[1:17:21] kept his hands up
[1:17:24] and the Bible said Joshua discomforted
[1:17:26] amalek
[1:17:27] and his people with the edge of the
[1:17:29] sword

[1:17:54] that the Lord will have war with amalek
[1:17:57] from generation to generation he proved
[1:17:59] himself oh to be their protector to be
[1:18:02] their soul to be their Shield to be a

[1:18:22] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:18:25] the sea
[1:18:27] though the waters thereof raw and be
[1:18:29] troubled though the mountains shake with
[1:18:32] the swelling mirror of Salah but there

[1:18:53] tonight
[1:18:54] the Lord is with us our refuge amen
[1:18:57] here's this last script trying to close
[1:18:58] all to this amen you close out a few
[1:19:00] things here Joshua Tree says and behold
[1:19:02] so Joshua 3 verse 11 hear this testimony
[1:19:05] behold the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:19:06] Lord of all the Earth passeth over thee
[1:19:08] into uh
[1:19:10] over you into Jordan now therefore
[1:19:13] here's God's commandment to Joshua take
[1:19:15] you 12 men out to the tribe of Israel
[1:19:18] out of every tribe
[1:19:21] as soon as the souls at the feet of the
[1:19:23] priests that bear the Ark of the Lord of
[1:19:25] The Lord of all the Earth shall rest in
[1:19:27] the waters of Jordan
[1:19:29] that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut
[1:19:31] off from the waters that come down from
[1:19:34] the above and they shall stand upon an
[1:19:37] Heap God is going to do something no one
[1:19:39] has ever seen before he's gonna stack
[1:19:41] the water as a heap oh my mind he said
[1:19:44] it come to pass when the people removed
[1:19:46] from their tents to pass over so this is
[1:19:48] God's instructions to Cross Jordan is
[1:19:50] that right and the priest bearing the
[1:19:52] Ark of the Covenant before the people
[1:19:54] and as they bear the ark they come to
[1:19:57] Jordan and the feet of the priests of
[1:19:59] that very Ark were dipped in the brim of
[1:20:02] the water for Jordan overflow it all his
[1:20:05] Banks all at the time at that time of
[1:20:07] the Harvest so this was a time when the
[1:20:08] Jordan was at his highest Jordan was
[1:20:10] Bruce and his Banks going all around
[1:20:12] there's water everywhere but God spoke
[1:20:15] to Joshua and gave him instructions
[1:20:18] doesn't matter how Jordan looks I want
[1:20:20] you to take the ark and go down there
[1:20:23] and you watch what I will do isn't that
[1:20:25] right that the waters which came down
[1:20:27] from above stood and Rose up as a heap
[1:20:30] and far from the city Adam that is
[1:20:34] beside zaratan and those that came down
[1:20:36] towards the city of the plain even the
[1:20:38] salt sea the Bible said they were failed
[1:20:41] and were cut off and the Bible said and
[1:20:44] the people passed right over against
[1:20:46] Jericho they come right through God did
[1:20:49] exactly as he said he would isn't that
[1:20:52] right and they saw a miracle he's not in
[1:20:53] the priest that bear the Ark of the
[1:20:54] Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry
[1:20:57] ground in the midst of Jordan and all of
[1:21:01] the Israelites pass over on dry ground
[1:21:05] oh Hallelujah stood right there they
[1:21:08] stood in the midst of the water while
[1:21:10] the children are crossing over God is in
[1:21:12] the midst of your trial tonight while
[1:21:15] you are crossing over while you are
[1:21:17] crossing your Muddy Waters tonight God
[1:21:20] is standing in the midst he won't move
[1:21:22] until you cross over he went in first
[1:21:26] and made a way of Escape for you God
[1:21:30] don't give you attempt
[1:21:31] until he provides a way of Escape
[1:21:35] oh for his people he does it every time
[1:21:38] oh they believe it tonight
[1:21:44] until all the people who passed clean
[1:21:47] over Jordan
[1:21:48] my is not right here's Joshua 4 and it
[1:21:51] came to pass that when all the people
[1:21:52] were clean passed over Jordan is very
[1:21:54] descriptive now the hole is clean if you
[1:21:57] had an aerial view you could see that
[1:21:58] the only thing left here amen uh of the
[1:22:01] Arc of the Covenant isn't that right and
[1:22:02] the Lord spoke under Joshua saying take
[1:22:05] you 12 men so the waters are still piled
[1:22:07] up and God speaks to Joshua and say take
[1:22:09] you 12 men out of people unto the people
[1:22:11] out of every tribe a man and he said and
[1:22:14] command ye them saying take you hands
[1:22:16] out to the midst of Jordan out of the
[1:22:18] place where the priest feet stood firm
[1:22:19] 12 Stones that you shall carry them over

[1:22:37] out of every tribe and Joshua said to
[1:22:38] them pass over before the Ark of the
[1:22:40] Lord God into the midst of Jordan he
[1:22:43] said take you up every man out of you a
[1:22:45] stone upon his shoulder a big Stone his
[1:22:47] nine according to the number of the
[1:22:50] tribes of the children of Israel
[1:22:52] why did God tell him to do this he said
[1:22:55] that this may be a sign among you that
[1:22:58] when your children ask their fathers in
[1:23:02] time to come so God knows there's a Time
[1:23:04] coming where the children would not have
[1:23:06] experienced the swelling of the Jordan
[1:23:08] Hallelujah but he's saying time to come
[1:23:10] when the children are saying what mean
[1:23:13] ye by these Stones then he shall answer
[1:23:16] them that the Waters of Jordan were cut
[1:23:19] off before the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:23:21] the Lord and when it passed over Jordan
[1:23:24] the Waters of Jordan were cut off and
[1:23:27] these Stones shall be for Memorial unto

[1:25:19] God has raising us up
[1:25:21] as individuals
[1:25:23] each one of us in our lives
[1:25:25] God is using us
[1:25:27] think it not strange
[1:25:29] concerning a fiery trial

[1:25:34] Sometimes They Come unannounced
[1:25:36] sometimes they can't unaware sometimes
[1:25:39] you don't know but there is an
[1:25:41] intelligence
[1:25:42] behind all of that behind everything
[1:25:44] that happens in your life there's an
[1:25:47] intelligence behind it it is not just
[1:25:50] confusion the devil walking to and fro
[1:25:52] over the Earth causing confusion but
[1:25:54] when God permits things in your life he
[1:25:57] do it with a cause he does it with a
[1:25:59] purpose he uses these things he uses
[1:26:03] these hard things these hard sins these
[1:26:07] hard experiences to bring out something
[1:26:09] in you to give you a testimony oh
[1:26:13] hallelujah it's not right Enoch walk
[1:26:15] with God but before he left what did he
[1:26:18] have he had a testimony that he pleased
[1:26:22] God that he walked in such a way that
[1:26:25] God was so pleased with his walk that
[1:26:28] yesterday that he was here and by
[1:26:30] tomorrow he was gone he was missing they
[1:26:33] couldn't find him because a man could
[1:26:36] walk so close to God oh hallelujah
[1:26:39] hallelujah I'm telling you Church let's

[1:26:43] missing one of these days Adam died
[1:26:46] isn't that right this one died and Seth
[1:26:49] died isn't that right but when Enoch
[1:26:51] came along he was the only one that did
[1:26:54] not die because he had a testimony what
[1:26:56] a type of the pride many have died
[1:26:58] throughout the ages but there will be a
[1:27:01] pride on the earth who shall not see
[1:27:04] that oh hallelu but she's gonna be

[1:28:07] probably just I'll just read this one
[1:28:08] said and I hope I hope may God help us
[1:28:10] tonight I don't want you to I want you
[1:28:12] to see this so bad he said that you can
[1:28:14] slightly kind of slightly doubt any of
[1:28:16] it you've got to just take it as it is
[1:28:18] uh brother Stephen you can play some
[1:28:20] softly amen
[1:28:22] it needs no interpretation the Bible
[1:28:24] says that the word of God is of no
[1:28:26] private interpretation
[1:28:28] God doesn't need any of our schools to
[1:28:30] interpret his word
[1:28:32] when he vindicates it and makes it live
[1:28:34] that's the interpretation of it
[1:28:37] and when God said let there be light
[1:28:41] that don't need to be interpreted
[1:28:43] when he said a virgin shall conceive she
[1:28:46] conceived
[1:28:47] it doesn't need to be interpreted
[1:28:50] we don't need all this it's seminaries
[1:28:53] and things that gets men he said well we
[1:28:56] got the interpretation we got that
[1:28:57] interpretation that's what he's saying
[1:28:58] now he said but God himself interpret
[1:29:01] his own word
[1:29:03] he doesn't need anybody to interpret for
[1:29:05] him he said it'll happen
[1:29:08] and it happens he said in the last days
[1:29:10] he would pour the spirit
[1:29:13] the prophet said I don't care what the
[1:29:15] denomination said he did it anyway
[1:29:19] because he said he would do it so it
[1:29:22] doesn't need interpretation for God does
[1:29:25] his own interpretation
[1:29:27] these things that you see that seems to
[1:29:29] be mysterious to you now if you you
[1:29:31] remember your ministry your Pentecostals
[1:29:33] back there yonder he said it was just a
[1:29:35] mystery in the Church of the Pentecost
[1:29:36] and so forth to you this day but now we
[1:29:37] find that in the word I'm trying to show
[1:29:39] you like he's trying to show them that
[1:29:40] if God turns around and says it so in
[1:29:43] the word he then confirms it to be so
[1:29:45] and that's God's own interpretation we
[1:29:48] don't need any other interpretation
[1:29:50] isn't that right praise God he will
[1:29:52] interpret himself it's not right thus
[1:29:55] say the Lord praise God is not right
[1:29:56] he'll interpret his own with us let us
