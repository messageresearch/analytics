[36:12] preach for you this morning
[36:14] even he is multitasking I'm your hand
[36:17] with God is good even so we wonder Stan
[36:19] I want to read a scripture on this yes
[36:22] on the before he comes on from 1st Peter
[36:25] chapter 1 and we want to also read from
[36:28] Philippians chapter 3 I believe it is it
[36:34] was up to two rather so reason first
[36:37] Peter chapter 1 read in verse 1 the 11
[36:40] Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the
[36:42] strangers scattered wrote Pontus Galatia
[36:44] Cappadocia Asia be near elect according
[36:47] to the foreknowledge of God Father
[36:49] through sanctification of the Spirit
[36:51] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[36:53] blood of Jesus Christ risen to you and
[36:55] peace be multiplied blessed be the God
[36:58] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[36:59] which had according to his abundant
[37:01] mercy has begotten us again unto a
[37:03] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[37:05] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[37:07] incorruptible undefiled and feed not
[37:10] away reserved in heaven for you oh
[37:14] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[37:18] thank you Jesus
[37:20] let's go to Philippians chapter 2
[37:24] reading from verse 1 the eleven if there
[37:27] be any therefore consolation in Christ
[37:29] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[37:31] of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies
[37:35] fulfilling my joy that she be
[37:38] like-minded having the same love being
[37:40] of one Accord and of one mind that
[37:44] nothing be done through strife or
[37:45] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[37:48] each esteem other better than themselves
[37:51] praise God
[37:54] not every man on his own things but
[37:55] every man also lit things of others let
[37:58] this mind be in you which was also in
[38:00] Christ Jesus who been in the form of God
[38:03] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[38:04] God but made himself of no reputation
[38:06] took upon him the form of a servant and
[38:09] was made in the likeness of men and
[38:11] being found in a fashion as a man he
[38:13] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[38:17] death even the death of the cross and we
[38:19] forgot that I highly exalted him and
[38:21] give him a name which is above every
[38:23] name that at the name of Jesus every
[38:25] knee should bow on things and heaven
[38:27] things and in earth things under the
[38:29] earth that every tongue should confess
[38:30] to Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of
[38:33] God may God bless his word you may be
[38:34] seated
[38:35] oh praise His name let us say the name
[38:38] of the Lord
[38:38] ah hallelujah blessed be the name of
[38:42] Jesus the Bible talk about the cluded
[38:45] with humility be humble one to another
[38:48] isn't that right so this morning I just
[38:50] have something I'd like to share with
[38:51] you about humility but Brian was talking
[38:55] about our the privilege in my life of
[38:58] meet and greet men it's remarkable to
[39:00] notice how things can be I've met men
[39:03] that was greet men and when I met men
[39:05] that thought they were great men there's
[39:08] certainly a lot of difference in them a
[39:10] great man will always not be a stuffed
[39:13] shirt and he will try to make you think
[39:15] that you are the great man and he is
[39:18] nothing and the man that is nothing
[39:20] trying to be great it's just the other
[39:22] way and that's the reason I know that
[39:24] Jesus was the son of God he came to
[39:27] earth without even having a place to be
[39:29] born he had to borrow room he had to
[39:31] borrow a manger he had to come to a
[39:33] borrowed womb he went to aboard Greaves
[39:35] the Foxes are then the birds of the air
[39:38] has nests but the Son of man has nowhere
[39:40] to lay his head yet the king of glory
[39:43] the God of heaven made flesh birth among
[39:46] us and that is what made him big that is
[39:49] what meet him by we he was his humility
[39:51] humility the way daang is always the way
[39:55] up the way up is long and he will humble
[39:58] himself
[39:59] will exalt Jesus met with men of all
[40:03] walks of life he met in great circles
[40:07] one time he met with thousands five
[40:09] hundred at once twelve at once three at
[40:11] once even will come to one that makes
[40:14] him great because not even one person
[40:17] kind of a call on him but what he will
[40:19] be right there at their side that is
[40:21] what make him God because of his
[40:24] humility Elijah he stayed with God in
[40:28] such a way Kilgore was pleased the
[40:30] Sendong is that spirit is not right God
[40:33] loved that spirit I was upon that simple
[40:35] uneducated woodsman from back there in
[40:38] the woods somewhere
[40:39] it was so obedient to the word that he
[40:42] could say you I do this and I will do it
[40:44] and God hid himself India in such
[40:47] simplicity that old crank don't have
[40:50] nothing doing him but one day when he
[40:53] got all his head was born his whiskers
[40:57] hanging down grief you hear he had
[40:59] hanging over his shoulders his there
[41:01] those skinny arms and a meat flopping
[41:03] like that come walking on the route of
[41:05] Samaria and that eyes looking towards
[41:08] the skies with crooked stick in his hand
[41:09] he wasn't very much to look at but he
[41:12] had dust here the Lord for this be and
[41:15] the bride will have thus saith the Lord
[41:18] he didn't stammer he didn't stutter he
[41:21] didn't say no greedy hab he walked on
[41:23] and said not even Jew will fall from
[41:25] heaven till I call for his God had
[41:28] honored his simplicity now you see while
[41:31] in that simple way everybody against him
[41:34] anyway that is true all the Ministerial
[41:37] Association everything else without is
[41:38] true that's true trying to get rid of
[41:40] him everything else but in that
[41:42] simplicity even though he had no
[41:44] cooperation with his campaigns whatever
[41:46] more everybody thought he was a crank
[41:48] God was higher than himself but when it
[41:51] comes here you when it comes time for
[41:54] that seed to get right that has been
[41:57] planted God manifested himself by
[42:01] selling Scioto heaven and looking up the
[42:04] sacrifice God hiding himself in
[42:06] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[42:09] same
[42:10] all of her greetings God you say God he
[42:13] speaks of great big things he will come
[42:15] and you do this and do that I will catch
[42:16] what I'm saying
[42:17] it will pass right over the top you
[42:19] never seen it God lives in simplicity to
[42:22] manifest himself in greatness I love
[42:26] that God lives in simplicity to manifest
[42:30] themselves and simple in greatness that
[42:32] is what makes him great because he can
[42:35] simplify himself that's why the Bible
[42:39] talk about Habakkuk right the vision and
[42:41] make it plain that he that readeth may
[42:44] run not right the vision and make it
[42:46] more mysterious because that was what
[42:47] spurred and he was too mysterious and he
[42:50] wanted to reveal themselves that is why
[42:52] he released Jesus right and Christ is
[42:54] the mystery of God revealed Word made
[42:57] flesh Oh hallelujah have the word become
[43:01] flesh that invisible God will become
[43:03] visible and would be seen through your
[43:04] flesh that's why the word must become
[43:07] flesh Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:10] praise God blessed be the name of the
[43:13] Lord hallelujah fries Gordon or skip
[43:17] down something you know other story but
[43:19] environmental please and so this girl

[45:20] girl that I met me a while ago she
[45:22] nodded a little head as the interpreter
[45:25] spoke I said listen listen is that I
[45:29] want to get to your respect to Jesus
[45:34] Christ you're you approached in the
[45:37] right manner that's a lot of times the
[45:40] way we Americans don't get anything we
[45:42] don't come to God reverent enough we
[45:46] just know more or more about it God
[45:49] lives in humility and simplicity
[45:52] so I said God rewarded you honey he
[45:57] healed you oh dear and I want you to go
[46:01] over there and sit down and get some man
[46:04] to unbuckle these breezes and things
[46:07] from a wrong view and let your little
[46:09] hand set on your hip so her foot one
[46:11] foot was dangling and the brace was
[46:14] balanced in it and the next foot and so
[46:16] on so we had one foot shorter than one
[46:17] all in braces he said just go and sit
[46:19] down there I'm right you can let your
[46:22] little hand set on your hip and just as
[46:24] they bring the braces off let your
[46:26] little hand slide down your leg just as
[46:29] far as your leg is short and I said no
[46:31] you do that over there then show me and
[46:34] then I call the next one and Holy Spirit
[46:36] was showing the vision when the vision
[46:37] was going on I heard her scream and yes
[46:40] she come across the floor crutches in
[46:42] her hand
[46:42] braces overhead screaming at the top of
[46:45] her voice right up the steps she went
[46:47] right down and across up the other way
[46:50] appear feet barely running as hard as he
[46:53] could she was perfectly normal and well
[46:57] because I respect and
[47:00] love the Jesus Christ brought his
[47:03] blessings down upon her

[1:01:25] verse three Jude 1:3
[1:01:29] beloved when I gave all diligence to

[1:27:38] his meetings you know the Prophet said
[1:27:40] sometimes he loved to go by himself
[1:27:43] because even within the church people
[1:27:45] would be saying god bless you but he was
[1:27:48] he the fourth in their hearts um and
[1:27:50] realized that they were not with him
[1:27:52] they were seeing the words with the
[1:27:54] amounts but they were not sincere and
[1:27:56] because he saw that even if you don't
[1:27:59] want to see it all the time it was too
[1:28:01] much for him
[1:28:02] the hypocrisy was too real the hypocrisy
[1:28:05] was too troublesome for him to the
[1:28:07] probable pull himself away but it's
[1:28:09] coming a time when there will be
[1:28:11] coherent there will be a singularity
[1:28:13] what your mind and your heart says will
[1:28:16] be the same thing what your mouth is and
[1:28:18] what your heart says will be the same
[1:28:20] things because nothing will be hidden we
[1:28:23] are moving in a season and time because
[1:28:25] in the book of acts of the talk it was
[1:28:28] people that they were talking to so when
[1:28:30] people hear what Ananias had he didn't
[1:28:33] lie to me you like what are holding us
[1:28:36] up because the Holy Ghost already went
[1:28:38] on the inside and see what's going on so
[1:28:41] we are in another Ephesians we are going
[1:28:43] to have a super church we're gonna have
[1:28:45] a church without sin we're gonna have a
[1:28:47] children where you could have made a
[1:28:49] mistake a bit but before you even sit
[1:28:51] down you run to the Ella and say pray
[1:28:53] for me because the Holy Ghost will be so
[1:28:56] real it will call them send out the
[1:28:58] church we're gonna have a perfect Church
[1:29:01] we're gonna have a Ephesus church
[1:29:03] we'll have another Ephesians up we will
[1:29:05] have a search of that what a benefits
[1:29:08] about Erica is five people if it's ten
[1:29:11] people is it's 20 people the numbers and
[1:29:15] that important at all because wanna work
[1:29:18] with the thousands of life who
[1:29:20] represents thousands of life free will
[1:29:24] put a hundred thousand subs right
[1:29:25] brother I just need a few more people to
[1:29:28] save this island to save this country
[1:29:32] the state as well you may be seated
[1:29:41] hallelujah give me liberty or give me
[1:29:45] death
[1:29:46] I want Liberty I want reality I must be
[1:29:51] free to come to the house of God and
[1:29:52] worship it cannot be that I leave Church
[1:29:56] on Sunday and between Sundays by
[1:29:59] Thursday have lost the victory by Friday
[1:30:01] I'm not feeling myself there must be a
[1:30:04] time when it's a permanence of character
[1:30:06] and it's a permanence of heat there must
[1:30:09] come a time when you are so solid in
[1:30:12] Christ as the Bible said he that
[1:30:14] overcometh will i make a pillar in the
[1:30:16] tabernacle and he will go no more out
[1:30:19] that's coming a time when you overcome
[1:30:22] and you overcome and then you become
[1:30:24] like a rock but a wind blows you don't
[1:30:26] move the storms come you don't move
[1:30:29] the Bible says you are fella in the
[1:30:31] tabernacle hello in the house unmovable
[1:30:36] unshakable nothing could move you
[1:30:38] because I've been grounded and
[1:30:40] established by word and by experience by
[1:30:43] revelation and power by blood on fire
[1:30:47] what was this morning
[1:30:49] so make a church with make a revival
[1:30:52] that suicide
[1:30:54] amphitheater seven thunders of history
[1:30:56] and made me practice
[1:30:58] I'm counting down to the date when the
[1:31:00] cripples are walking here we won't even
[1:31:02] have to pray for them buddy anointing
[1:31:05] but they all over the filling the place
[1:31:07] milky white condensate band for eyes but
[1:31:11] afterward good spot people taxes make
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:22] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:31:25] you may be seated got to do anything
[1:31:29] Caleb I haven't seen you in a while but
[1:31:31] it just takes five minutes in the
[1:31:34] presence of God the tone over 40 years
[1:31:37] of Moses for 40 years Moses have lost
[1:31:40] his way but 40 years Moses was just
[1:31:43] there in utero but he will have no
[1:31:46] prayer he was not convinced he was not
[1:31:49] concerned enough he knew there was
[1:31:51] something about his life but he needed
[1:31:53] an encounter
[1:31:54] he needed an account of with something
[1:31:57] bigger than himself of it bigger than
[1:31:59] what his wife could speak to him
[1:32:00] speaking on what his name look at it
[1:32:02] bigger than what a path like a safe and
[1:32:05] when he saw the bun and push the burning
[1:32:08] bush the only purpose you may be seen it
[1:32:11] that a burning bush served up what the
[1:32:13] attract his attention and God does many
[1:32:16] things from it a trap book interrupt you
[1:32:19] to get your attention and he doesn't
[1:32:22] need your pencil for long he just needs
[1:32:24] five minutes he does needed 182 hours
[1:32:27] but convince you because it's power
[1:32:30] connected as seen in you because that
[1:32:33] we'd call it at a deeper there's a
[1:32:35] deeper responder so even in Moses back
[1:32:38] to decondition there was something you
[1:32:40] was a year and for the assumed he was
[1:32:43] looking for that's why we nice water
[1:32:45] fire that I returned asylum I will go up
[1:32:51] because I'm looking for something I
[1:32:53] don't know what I'm looking for but it's
[1:32:55] a birth in my soul get the meter
[1:33:02] you may be seated and the only reason
[1:33:05] you could be in the house of God this
[1:33:08] morning is because there's a thirst
[1:33:10] there is a need there is a desire
[1:33:13] there's something in you that's calling
[1:33:15] for something there's something and you
[1:33:17] have needing something and we try to
[1:33:19] fill it with all kinds of stuff and the
[1:33:23] devil is good he is very good a China
[1:33:26] philosopher with all kind of stuff you
[1:33:36] may be seen
[1:33:37] god help us smooth for the reason you
[1:33:42] are here this morning it was no matter
[1:33:45] what the stuff is you have tried and how
[1:33:49] you spend your time you will never go to
[1:33:52] bed at night satisfied because God put
[1:33:55] the fish in there and the music and
[1:33:58] books and positive self-talk and
[1:34:02] positive affirmations and saying I'm a
[1:34:05] believer even seeing a man a message
[1:34:08] till doesn't quench the sense because
[1:34:11] the message coming to church the routine
[1:34:15] and the ritual that's all up here people
[1:34:18] program themselves to wake up on a
[1:34:21] Sunday morning to come to church people
[1:34:23] program themselves etc I'm in the
[1:34:26] morning it's a program that your honor
[1:34:28] but quarters and about programs these
[1:34:31] are about routines I'm little bit rich
[1:34:33] you are then about customs about
[1:34:36] whatever you want to do is serenity he
[1:34:39] could meet you on the road to Damascus
[1:34:41] of rehna team falling on the road for
[1:34:45] the do damage I'm going to interrupt him
[1:34:47] on a horse I'm going to be more than
[1:34:49] with a fireable gotta meet Elijah in a
[1:34:52] rustle of the mulberry trees got to meet
[1:34:55] you anywhere you could be driving on the
[1:34:57] road you could be on your Java but
[1:35:00] you've got to be listening you've got to
[1:35:02] be looking for him
[1:35:03] you've got to be wanting him and you've
[1:35:05] got to recognize that he is the one that
[1:35:07] you are missing her eNOS help somebody
[1:35:20] this morning finally my brethren be
[1:35:26] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:35:30] his might his might put on the whole
[1:35:34] armour of God
[1:35:36] so it's no good to put on part of the
[1:35:40] armor and before you could even put on
[1:35:43] the armor you have to take off whatever
[1:35:45] you're wearing before you can put on his
[1:35:56] armor you have to take off what you are
[1:35:59] wearing there's a same naked in the
[1:36:05] world we come a naked believe and what
[1:36:08] you wear is your character what you wear
[1:36:12] is your bias your your feelings your way
[1:36:17] of doing things your way of resolving
[1:36:20] conflict your own perspectives your your
[1:36:24] history some of us who wear this I've
[1:36:28] done it this way for five years I don't
[1:36:31] talk to people at all and I like to talk
[1:36:34] to people I don't and that's what we're
[1:36:36] wearing
[1:36:37] you can tell going to like to talk to
[1:36:40] people because when God told Peter go
[1:36:42] and talk to this one he couldn't say I
[1:36:44] like to talk to
[1:36:49] so whatever you are wearing you have got
[1:36:53] to take it off to put on his armor put
[1:37:03] on the whole armor of quarters we may be
[1:37:05] able to stand against the wiles of the
[1:37:07] devil the tactics of the devil the
[1:37:12] recommendations of the devil the
[1:37:14] barrister we are ignorant of Satan's
[1:37:16] devices devices we're not ignorant of
[1:37:20] his attack Cena's planted strategy and
[1:37:23] use very good and the Bible goes on will
[1:37:24] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:37:26] blood but against principalities against
[1:37:30] powers against the rulers of the
[1:37:32] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:37:35] wickedness in high places and I share
[1:37:39] this in Nigeria I heard another preacher
[1:37:41] speak about this and he said no we're
[1:37:43] from Genesis to Revelation do you find
[1:37:45] demons arguing with one another in fact
[1:37:53] when Jesus was on the earth and he was
[1:37:55] healing the sick and doing miracles
[1:37:58] those ignorant Pharisees and the people
[1:38:01] said it's by the power of Beelzebub that
[1:38:03] Jesus is doing this I'm Jesus say listen
[1:38:07] a house divided with never stood in
[1:38:10] other words the devil is smarter then
[1:38:13] allowing division in his own kingdom so
[1:38:16] his soldiers marched together so when
[1:38:19] Jesus met the man with Legion he acted
[1:38:21] who you are as a legion they were
[1:38:22] working in how many multiple spirits but
[1:38:24] I'm an attorney when you cook for one
[1:38:26] demon
[1:38:27] he goes to get back up come up with
[1:38:29] seven more that if you don't clean up
[1:38:31] the house he's going to come back with
[1:38:32] more strength because he knew it took a
[1:38:35] power to clean amount what about the
[1:38:37] Church of the Living God
[1:38:39] we cannot be divided we cannot be
[1:38:43] separated
[1:38:44] it cannot be husband against wife and
[1:38:46] are against son and church against
[1:38:49] church and opted against Papa we have
[1:38:52] got to stand united as one army because
[1:38:55] the enemy is united as one on me but it
[1:38:59] was console of the soul of that's why
[1:39:01] we're the branham's head of iphone
[1:39:03] ministry we'll help each one packing one
[1:39:05] another because we need each other
[1:39:08] it's enemy's gonna come from every side
[1:39:11] but if we put solar persona and back to
[1:39:14] back the devil is finished and the
[1:39:17] church payment Oh hallelujah
[1:39:22] what are you doing preacher we're going
[1:39:25] to expose the devil at every one of his
[1:39:28] tricks you're going to expose them
[1:39:30] because listen the devil could only
[1:39:33] operate if he is hidden but if you
[1:39:39] expose him he has to find somewhere else
[1:39:42] to go
[1:39:42] [Applause]
[1:39:46] anybody with me this morning
[1:39:49] one key is hidden he could operate but
[1:39:52] the mother is a light and open the
[1:39:54] cupboard and and lip up the bed and
[1:39:56] final way is and expose him he cannot be
[1:39:58] exposed he has to one find somewhere
[1:40:04] else behind that's why when Jesus came
[1:40:07] to that man who they call Legion and he
[1:40:09] could expose his elephant send me
[1:40:11] somewhere sent me to the pigs because I
[1:40:14] can't stay there no more he has been
[1:40:16] exposed he has been identified and we
[1:40:19] are going to shine light in every room
[1:40:21] of your house because once the light
[1:40:24] goes on the delicate I have no more and
[1:40:26] he has got to get out and once the devil
[1:40:29] get out
[1:40:30] won't that snake us out there's no room
[1:40:33] but a Holy Ghost of Hell every house the
[1:40:35] bell every room because there and all
[1:40:38] kind of live in the same house of
[1:40:40] unbelief and it cannot live in the same
[1:40:43] house life and that just cannot live in
[1:40:45] the same house
[1:40:46] [Applause]
[1:40:48] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:40:57] everybody feelin fine I'm just waitin on
[1:41:01] him this morning I have different notes
[1:41:03] but he is seeing something this morning
[1:41:05] to help you today it's exactly two
[1:41:08] months away from our convention and we
[1:41:14] have a responsibility we have a
[1:41:17] responsibility to be prayed up we have a
[1:41:20] responsibility to be under expectation
[1:41:22] we have a responsibility to fast and
[1:41:25] call upon God because there is no
[1:41:27] shortcut there is no other way to do it
[1:41:31] there's only one way and that his way
[1:41:34] and no revival comes without sacrifice
[1:41:37] nothing worth having comes without
[1:41:41] sacrifice and when you can appreciate
[1:41:43] that and understand that it changes your
[1:41:46] perspective enough it changes your
[1:41:50] perspective completely you want success
[1:41:52] in the natural there is no success
[1:41:55] without sacrifice
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:00] you can live any life you want but if
[1:42:03] you want what people who work hard yet
[1:42:05] there's no shortcut to working out there
[1:42:11] people who work it you know what the day
[1:42:13] for five years and when you see them is
[1:42:15] like it successful until you are ready
[1:42:18] to do it you know it is you not ready
[1:42:20] yet and if people in the natural could
[1:42:25] do it you know what is for a purpose
[1:42:27] that they have in the app to achieve
[1:42:30] what about this virtual how much brain
[1:42:34] must we do to have good success most
[1:42:38] meditation once we do to have good
[1:42:40] success how much talking to God must we
[1:42:43] do to get him to operate on our behalf
[1:42:46] and to move things on our behalf because
[1:42:50] whenever you get into his business he's
[1:42:52] not to take care of your business my god
[1:43:01] so my message the total deliverance then
[1:43:06] just like you if you are a Christian God
[1:43:09] don't make any halfway Christians God
[1:43:13] makes complete Christians God don't make
[1:43:16] half we're preachers but the preacher
[1:43:19] can be halfway and God makes his
[1:43:21] children Christians but sometimes
[1:43:25] they're halfway Christians it's not good
[1:43:28] intentions them to be that way is their
[1:43:30] own ways got mixed up with a plan of God
[1:43:33] for their life and that's what makes
[1:43:35] them the way they are
[1:43:36] God don't want to be halfway Christian
[1:43:39] or halfway preachers compromising on
[1:43:41] either side so that compromising that
[1:43:44] giving back room for the devil to
[1:43:46] operate that's what we are going at this
[1:43:49] morning to drive them out completely
[1:44:01] Louie so brother Brandon proclaim the
[1:44:05] message let me just touch my text a
[1:44:07] little bit and see what God will do for
[1:44:10] the next few minutes proclaim the
[1:44:11] message of salt message to call the
[1:44:13] bride to war this Messer was the places
[1:44:17] in another Ephesians and I connect it to
[1:44:19] another occasion because but it's even
[1:44:21] rich a masterpiece
[1:44:23] I believe two Sundays ago about
[1:44:25] possessing your inheritance and burped
[1:44:27] over followed it with try the amount
[1:44:29] placing us in Joshua and we know from
[1:44:32] the word at Joshua and Ephesians are
[1:44:34] parallels of each other I wanted to pick
[1:44:37] it up from the Ephesian side so this
[1:44:39] message about a random brought what's
[1:44:41] the paces in another use Asians or said
[1:44:43] another way to place us into the land of
[1:44:46] the inheritance the land of promise the
[1:44:48] holy ghost land and divide the
[1:44:50] inheritance to us because each of us
[1:44:53] have our own inheritance each of us have
[1:44:55] our own place each of us have our own
[1:44:58] position and it's only in your piece or
[1:45:01] your position you could properly defend
[1:45:03] yourself when you are on your territory
[1:45:05] you have a right to defend yourself when
[1:45:08] you are on your property you have a
[1:45:10] right to protect your families when you
[1:45:12] are on your territory you have a right
[1:45:14] to do what you have to do because it's
[1:45:16] yours and this word team to let you know
[1:45:20] what is yours this word came to let you
[1:45:22] know that healing is yours this word in
[1:45:25] to let you know that the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:26] yours and once you know it's yours is
[1:45:29] put you in a position to fight for what
[1:45:32] is yours or you cannot be in the club
[1:45:34] and Piper something in the club speaker
[1:45:36] a cop is not yours you can be your open
[1:45:39] world music and fight for that because
[1:45:41] that's not yours but when you are in the
[1:45:43] will of God
[1:45:44] you can fight recklessly fighter because
[1:45:48] when you are in his will he is obligated
[1:45:49] to back you up
[1:45:51] in this world with a random talk on that
[1:45:54] Jesus is Authority was different his
[1:45:59] position when you are in your position
[1:46:01] the position brings with it a certain
[1:46:04] Authority you embassy determine the
[1:46:08] authority that comes with position has
[1:46:11] nothing to do with your standing the
[1:46:18] authority that comes with your position
[1:46:20] has not lose your standing I'll give you
[1:46:22] an example a police officer could be a
[1:46:26] corrupt police officer but when he wears
[1:46:28] the police officer uniform and tells you
[1:46:31] to stop the fact that his corrupt
[1:46:34] doesn't take away the authority he has
[1:46:37] to tell you to stop because his
[1:46:40] authority is based on his position
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:46] the Prime Minister of the country could
[1:46:48] be crazy but that doesn't change the
[1:46:51] fact because he holds the position here
[1:46:54] the authority to speak an acident bacon
[1:46:59] when you are in your position a
[1:47:01] competent authority know what the devil
[1:47:04] wants to do that that you're standing
[1:47:07] you want to tell the police officer you
[1:47:10] made a mistake yesterday so forget the
[1:47:13] uniform but get the backup because a
[1:47:15] police over like a pig miss radio and
[1:47:17] see a backup wanted but it devil says
[1:47:20] don't touch the radio forget your
[1:47:23] uniform because you made a mistake last
[1:47:26] week you made a mistake yesterday don't
[1:47:30] look in the mirror because if you look
[1:47:31] in the mirror you will see you have on
[1:47:33] the uniform don't look in the mirror
[1:47:35] because you will see you resemble the
[1:47:38] rest of people who make things happen
[1:47:41] that's what the devil does but if you
[1:47:44] look at the mirror of the world you can
[1:47:46] see that maybe you're not where you're
[1:47:48] supposed to be but your polish
[1:47:53] you have a gun on your head in the radio
[1:47:56] for backup
[1:47:58] you might be tired but don't let the
[1:48:01] devil do you make the mistake of console
[1:48:04] radio and sometimes Angelica pick up the
[1:48:07] radio
[1:48:08] that's the tougher gun because we're the
[1:48:10] gun you can take on one maybe two or
[1:48:12] three for the radio he does that I can
[1:48:15] call legions of support you know what
[1:48:22] armies I can call for them but you may
[1:48:28] be seated
[1:48:29] what do you say about Isaac there's some
[1:48:32] wounded Eagles in here this morning but
[1:48:34] being wounded has not taken off your
[1:48:37] uniform
[1:48:38] you may be wounded this morning what's
[1:48:41] that seeing wounded because battle has
[1:48:44] you scarred sometimes you get shot in
[1:48:46] this arm and this I don't know on oil
[1:48:48] sometimes that's what I write this by
[1:48:50] the way but that's the enemy's Java just
[1:48:53] kind of pull it your way what your
[1:48:56] uniform is get on maybe you lost the
[1:48:59] helmet give you but this morning but
[1:49:01] back on the whole armor of God so you
[1:49:04] can stand against every attack of the
[1:49:07] enemy
[1:49:07] [Applause]
[1:49:09] you may be seated and the Bible says
[1:49:13] having done all but a Clarence's and
[1:49:16] stand having at all after you've done
[1:49:21] all you can still send when you're tired
[1:49:25] you notice a when you are the end of the
[1:49:26] Rope you have in heaven we near the end
[1:49:28] of the rope
[1:49:29] tie a knot and hang on when at the end
[1:49:34] repair not and how long after you have
[1:49:37] done that system after you have exploded
[1:49:42] not in every door still the best haven't
[1:49:46] done all the time and you know why
[1:49:48] because backup is on its way you know
[1:49:52] how many walls people didn't think we're
[1:49:55] gonna be one and if they wore the line
[1:49:57] hold the line it's really three of us
[1:49:58] remaining the thousand hold the line
[1:50:01] backup is on the way somebody same
[1:50:09] I pray that it helps somebody this
[1:50:12] morning and every day you are in the
[1:50:17] word and the word becomes more real to
[1:50:19] you it brings clarity to your position
[1:50:22] it brings clarity to your purpose it
[1:50:26] brings clarity to what you wake up in
[1:50:28] the morning to do because when you have
[1:50:30] purpose and clarity it focuses your
[1:50:33] actions when you don't know what you are
[1:50:35] supposed to do you do 82 things that are
[1:50:37] not important an activity doesn't mean
[1:50:40] you're doing someone as relevant don't
[1:50:42] even is very goes in there people in
[1:50:44] jobs doing a lot of stuff that's not
[1:50:48] relevant
[1:50:50] just activity but the people I'm here to
[1:50:53] here the move from here to here but
[1:50:55] isn't here to here between here he's
[1:50:57] here if he is is he here how was work
[1:51:00] today work was good I did a lot of stuff
[1:51:04] activity not relevant how does it
[1:51:06] contribute to the profits I don't know
[1:51:08] does it add revenue I don't know what do
[1:51:12] you do over the cash but if I'm here is
[1:51:14] here but soon he is with me why because
[1:51:16] my boss to me put it from here to here
[1:51:18] and when I'm done putting me into here
[1:51:22] so it has to what activity we wonder
[1:51:26] when we walk with walking with direction
[1:51:28] and purpose that's when you pray in a
[1:51:33] Brainerd rambling be praying with
[1:51:36] purpose because you're praying with
[1:51:39] revelation of what to ask for
[1:51:42] so the way God taught us to pray say you
[1:51:45] princeless our Father who art in heaven
[1:51:47] first you stop and worship hallowed be
[1:51:51] thy name
[1:51:51] it's a structure God give you the
[1:51:54] formula for success
[1:51:56] our Father hallowed be thy name thy
[1:51:58] kingdom come thy will be done
[1:52:02] you haven't asked anything just yet you
[1:52:04] are giving them worship honor glory
[1:52:06] acknowledging your authority you're
[1:52:08] talking to
[1:52:09] thy kingdom come Thy will be done on
[1:52:12] earth as it is in heaven when you
[1:52:15] establish his authority on anything I'll
[1:52:17] give us this day our daily bread and you
[1:52:20] begin to get into your requests but when
[1:52:22] you are when you approach it in a better
[1:52:24] balanced workable approach to God it can
[1:52:27] be your way it must be his way when you
[1:52:30] approach it right then you can get into
[1:52:33] a spirit of the Lord be the spirit of
[1:52:36] this day and so what you need requests
[1:52:39] what you need and see God makes it
[1:52:41] happen because your approach is right a
[1:52:43] mature CMM and just helping anybody this
[1:52:45] morning I'm going is more concerned
[1:52:52] about your attitude than your action
[1:52:57] very estate again God is more concerned
[1:53:01] about your attitude then your action are
[1:53:06] you willing you're doing it but you're
[1:53:09] not doing it willingly somebody asked
[1:53:11] you to help them you had them but you
[1:53:13] hate her them grudgingly yeah anyone to
[1:53:16] help them I know but you have them
[1:53:17] because they know you're Christian and
[1:53:20] they ask Anya so whatever testimony area
[1:53:22] you want to give it man actually fur
[1:53:26] coat you give me a cloak - yeah I'm the
[1:53:28] one what one might even - maybe we were
[1:53:30] walking next to mine nobody can say it
[1:53:32] did walk actually but if you way you
[1:53:35] walk the extra mile you walk next to my
[1:53:38] effects so as far as you consider nobody
[1:53:42] could penalty he doesn't go the extra
[1:53:45] mana no but go on the scene is hid away
[1:53:47] his approach his attitude
[1:53:51] that's why the Bible speaks about
[1:53:53] David's men Diddley desires their
[1:53:57] command it was the way they approached
[1:54:00] they had so much respect for the man of
[1:54:02] God now when he's not as they were ready
[1:54:04] to move it means I wasn't command to
[1:54:07] them I said it as willingly so he wanted
[1:54:09] a drink of water they cut through the
[1:54:11] filling time because I know he wants a
[1:54:13] drink of water and when David saw how
[1:54:16] willing the or he said he could even
[1:54:17] drink the water he taught us sacrifice
[1:54:20] to the Lord because the attitude of his
[1:54:23] men
[1:54:25] so how about it you'd be to the kingdom
[1:54:28] and to the things of God it's a marvel
[1:54:32] to me because we're talking about
[1:54:33] warfare I'm talking about warfare me to
[1:54:36] talk about being in the army of the Lord
[1:54:38] and anybody was exposure with the Caliph
[1:54:41] or army or military there are lots of
[1:54:44] rules and standards and regulations and
[1:54:47] there's a lot of training because
[1:54:49] they're people you know the people who
[1:54:51] are in the army who never went to war
[1:54:56] and watched not they can imagine because
[1:55:06] salute take a do Organa but they never
[1:55:08] went to war but in the army their focus
[1:55:14] on the training because you never know
[1:55:16] when you call into action but the
[1:55:18] difference with us is we are in a war so
[1:55:22] there's no mass mass mass after when
[1:55:24] your trainer given a gun and your Center
[1:55:26] two one fight just go and fight fight
[1:55:29] kill something kill or be killed if you
[1:55:36] let that diabetes get you or you get it
[1:55:39] is your choice because here is my
[1:55:43] verities and my see either you clean it
[1:55:46] or you push it back this morning I'm
[1:55:49] sending it back
[1:55:51] every morning you get a diabetes your
[1:55:54] finish a brightness your village cancer
[1:55:58] your finish every day you have the tags
[1:56:03] on a rose you have keep it on on the
[1:56:06] robes you put it on the rope you're
[1:56:08] letting go as the day goes on this
[1:56:10] headache has got to go by sighs I am
[1:56:13] healed
[1:56:14] what is that work there that warfare you
[1:56:20] may be seated
[1:56:20] so you mean you mean to tell me they are
[1:56:22] sick people in here who don't put
[1:56:24] pressure on your sickness really that's
[1:56:30] what what is your cheering a pathogen
[1:56:33] and you don't clean them every day
[1:56:35] you're not serious you really wanted to
[1:56:37] come back but war fear me the devil must
[1:56:40] know you serious every day every single
[1:56:45] day Lord I clear my current against them
[1:56:49] take your hands off my children
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] every day but when you are complete and
[1:56:58] concerned it becomes easy to breathe
[1:57:01] because you know what you're praying for
[1:57:05] whenever I'm talking to take adopted son
[1:57:08] to travel to Philistine so how to do it
[1:57:10] it tastes heavily I'm a writer Jeph
[1:57:12] beside the kemacite and you're ready for
[1:57:16] Philistines if you're not any disruption
[1:57:18] father you have to adopt me whatever it
[1:57:22] takes and these are making guys mrs.
[1:57:24] Bates adoption today day every day like
[1:57:28] that so you want to get it full size to
[1:57:30] do the draggable - somebody's Haven you
[1:57:37] may be seated
[1:57:38] so that's how you declare war on the
[1:57:41] enemy you declare war in your house
[1:57:44] every day every day the Lord I claim my
[1:57:47] prayer lines or give me a burden for
[1:57:49] prayer locking me a pudding for praise
[1:57:51] you Anna Massey you're waiting on a taxi
[1:57:54] but you declare non you declaring war
[1:57:56] we're like the devil's with a room any
[1:57:57] of mine because you're always on the
[1:57:59] offensive they don't need to defend
[1:58:01] anymore because it has push them
[1:58:03] destroying Greene is you just ran palms
[1:58:06] you want me attack every time I tell us
[1:58:08] use it as it has to be an easier target
[1:58:10] yeah after so many easier because but it
[1:58:13] was always on the attack but is it
[1:58:15] always on yeah that's how we must be put
[1:58:18] on the whole armor of God and write them
[1:58:21] out
[1:58:28] I pray this helps some money in him
[1:58:33] because I know many people here apply
[1:58:36] the token and people don't know what to
[1:58:38] do
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:49] but you know what the Prophet said he
[1:58:51] said when you apply the token you take
[1:58:52] the word yourselves you believe every
[1:58:55] word you act upon every word
[1:58:57] you claim every word and when you do
[1:58:59] that is then the devil knows you mean
[1:59:01] business and God also knows that you
[1:59:04] mean business so as a church can be
[1:59:07] pledged to be on the offensive from
[1:59:10] there there's anybody here this morning
[1:59:12] from this day on you will be on your
[1:59:15] senses
[1:59:16] from this day on you'll be in prayer
[1:59:18] from this day on you'll be in worship
[1:59:21] and commitment and dedication because
[1:59:23] that's what it takes a see result in
[1:59:26] your home in your life in the church on
[1:59:28] your job you see doors open up to you
[1:59:31] you don't even expect to open up because
[1:59:34] you're noisy all over you all around you
[1:59:36] Jesus himself had to pray the keep in
[1:59:41] that atmosphere because prayer keeps you
[1:59:44] in an atmosphere it's impossible I said
[1:59:47] if some reason is impossible to get up
[1:59:49] and pray and I'm going to argue with
[1:59:50] your wife that is too big of a leap it's
[1:59:54] too big is it there's a way off
[1:59:59] it's impossible to go from prayer to
[2:00:02] want to argue a divorce but when you are
[2:00:05] not anointed then you see things
[2:00:06] differently here as the past is not
[2:00:09] against flesh and blood is that you any
[2:00:11] detail on the ocean and the wives and
[2:00:13] husbands but it's principalities and
[2:00:15] powers and it's a spiritual walking that
[2:00:18] you are in and you have a destination
[2:00:20] because all of this is temporary why
[2:00:24] fight and spend energy on the temporary
[2:00:26] stuff when there's an eternity to go to
[2:00:29] with a land as made of gold with a
[2:00:31] fountain they could drink anytime
[2:00:33] somebody that doesn't get sick that's
[2:00:35] what we also fight for that's what I
[2:00:37] want to fight for can the church hey man
[2:00:41] can you take some more I haven't gotten
[2:00:45] anywhere with this store this morning I
[2:00:49] have four sections and I'm on page 6 of
[2:00:51] the first section my mind so malachite
[2:00:59] welcome to restore the heart of the gem
[2:01:01] back to the faith of the Apostolic
[2:01:04] fathers and we are contending for one
[2:01:07] Lord one faith one baptism to meet the
[2:01:11] challenge of the hour because every hour
[2:01:14] has its own challenge Noah had his
[2:01:18] challenge and his Deen Moses had the
[2:01:20] challenge in his day Joseph had a
[2:01:22] challenge in his day our day not only
[2:01:25] has this power and his messenger on his
[2:01:27] message but there are challenges that we
[2:01:30] have in our day and you have to be able
[2:01:33] to meet the challenge not with your own
[2:01:35] strength but by the whole armor of God
[2:01:37] and by the random tortas a whole armor
[2:01:40] of God is what he said is a baptism of
[2:01:41] the Holy Ghost that's the whole armor of
[2:01:43] God so we are yet to apply because
[2:01:46] believe and I'm sort of full obedience
[2:01:47] to the entire Word of God
[2:01:50] entitles you to the token which is the
[2:01:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the
[2:01:55] full armor of God which is the power of
[2:01:57] God I'm not talking about a book
[2:01:59] knowledge on a Pentecostal experience
[2:02:00] but
[2:02:01] some of the fullness of God himself so
[2:02:04] when DC unity that's crisis that she's
[2:02:06] at the same God that push back the devil
[2:02:10] when he was here can the church team and
[2:02:13] so this message this morning is an
[2:02:16] encouragement to you that I in the
[2:02:18] battle but maybe you are tired maybe
[2:02:20] you're thinking about giving up maybe
[2:02:22] you get discouraged but you're in the
[2:02:23] bathroom you don't understand why this
[2:02:26] happened you don't understand why I said
[2:02:28] you don't understand why this went wrong
[2:02:30] you don't understand why there are these
[2:02:31] that they're up these and you're down
[2:02:33] there and you've seen so much something
[2:02:35] you don't even know why you're in the
[2:02:37] fight but we are fighting anyhow we are
[2:02:41] fighting for our inheritance we are
[2:02:43] fighting for our promise we are fighting
[2:02:45] for our purpose we are fighting the
[2:02:47] power side of the type of war and a time
[2:02:49] for peace we are not talking about these
[2:02:52] this morning return at all because many
[2:02:55] of us we have been a key to the devil
[2:02:57] for a long time we have a louder devil
[2:02:59] to do what he wants to do in our houses
[2:03:00] in our lives in our marriages and in the
[2:03:03] church but in this day the 7th of this
[2:03:06] month and seventh of me we declare war
[2:03:08] against the enemy
[2:03:10] we are let us never know now we are
[2:03:12] taking back our friend we are taking
[2:03:14] back our worship we are taking back a
[2:03:16] revival we are taking back our position
[2:03:19] we are claiming our inheritance we will
[2:03:22] have a church without spot without
[2:03:24] wrinkle we will have a manifestation of
[2:03:27] every promise laid how my Malachi 4 can
[2:03:30] the church amen
[2:03:33] a dance gets a few more minutes and I'll
[2:03:38] close out in a message putting on a
[2:03:41] whole hour alcohol with the balance and
[2:03:43] you know in this warfare between nations
[2:03:44] it's a great warfare going on and that's
[2:03:47] a warfare between gordon's heating and
[2:03:49] great warfare it was the first walk down
[2:03:51] it's still raging but oh I'm so glad
[2:03:53] it'll soon come to an end then the lord
[2:03:56] over season has his agent out everywhere
[2:03:59] watching spying out on God's people God
[2:04:02] moves the enemy is setting everywhere
[2:04:05] watching to see what he can do but go
[2:04:08] and go get some out too so we find that
[2:04:10] these secret agents of the enemy that
[2:04:12] sits around this is the prophets weaken
[2:04:14] each nation now you bring a parallel
[2:04:18] will equipped as many the latest
[2:04:20] equipment the very latest and they study
[2:04:22] and they do everything that's trying to
[2:04:24] counteract the other fellows weapons and
[2:04:26] get a little more modern weapon a little
[2:04:28] something with a little more punch to it
[2:04:29] and if you're watching the World News
[2:04:31] there's Babbitt Awards rumors of wars
[2:04:33] this one minute is North Korea see if
[2:04:35] America does this they will do this and
[2:04:37] and America terms of shipment many we
[2:04:39] have a small island far away doesn't
[2:04:41] affect us with you over the mu CD big
[2:04:43] ship coming waiting on you and North
[2:04:47] Korea say they have the group I think is
[2:04:48] Russia say they have the mother of all
[2:04:50] bomb the who say well who's that a leaf
[2:04:51] out of all bombs and it's a competition
[2:04:54] I said that humans can even understand
[2:04:55] because one of these bumble destroy
[2:04:57] millions of people that's what the
[2:04:58] profits for them are here I'm they're
[2:05:00] trying to contract the other fellas
[2:05:01] weapons they get a little more modern
[2:05:03] weapon I tell you with a little more
[2:05:04] punch that's a lot more punch from the
[2:05:08] bow and arrow to a muscular from a
[2:05:10] muscular modern rifle and from that to
[2:05:12] an atomic did it just keep building and
[2:05:14] it keeps them busy all the time
[2:05:16] busy all the time and it's a nation's
[2:05:22] business if they want to survive they
[2:05:24] want to equip their soldiers with the
[2:05:26] best equipment that there is but a
[2:05:29] balancing well girl you know he's
[2:05:30] infinite see he don't have to think
[2:05:33] anything better
[2:05:34] he just got the best they begin with so
[2:05:37] man went from guns are born are all
[2:05:40] swords gone
[2:05:41] Kanaan signature names he did what God
[2:05:43] gives the best at the beginning he
[2:05:47] actually give us nuclear weapons he just
[2:05:49] got the best to begin with so you can't
[2:05:51] improve on that nothing to be done about
[2:05:54] it he just give us the best and that's
[2:05:57] his word that's right his was the best
[2:05:59] that can't be given God gives his people
[2:06:02] the very best that's what he shows with
[2:06:04] his children the very best
[2:06:07] I'm so glad of that I'll be glad of that
[2:06:12] now let me in the resident now God
[2:06:15] cannot make a decision to be and
[2:06:17] tomorrow come back and make a better
[2:06:19] decision because this decision is
[2:06:22] perfect he never has to change it so
[2:06:25] therefore we can rest upon whatever God
[2:06:28] says so if God's incision but is even
[2:06:30] it's perfect to begin with it means that
[2:06:33] when God called you and equipped you
[2:06:35] with the best weapon he can even change
[2:06:37] his mind about his weapon and he can
[2:06:40] even change his mind about the soldier
[2:06:43] so when God chose you for a killer he
[2:06:47] didn't make a mistake he didn't make a
[2:06:49] mistake with you young people when he
[2:06:51] call yours in the world and he put you
[2:06:53] in the house he put you in to give you
[2:06:56] the opportunity to hear this word he
[2:06:58] made the best decision he could have
[2:07:01] ever made and because of that you are
[2:07:04] going to make it you are going to
[2:07:06] overcome oh my
[2:07:14] so this is not the time church foster
[2:07:17] died already you know I I believe it
[2:07:23] over to Allah go ahead and leave me here
[2:07:26] that's at that some of us zone

[2:07:30] older Caleb listen there's no oh lucky
[2:07:31] Lebanon that green here is going to
[2:07:33] reverse I'm not buying that another
[2:07:38] except again there's not giving up
[2:07:39] another law when you kill em together
[2:07:41] time for young people to take over you

[2:07:45] need to be refinished that speed and you
[2:07:48] make your young people some speaking to
[2:07:50] the young people and the Caleb's nor
[2:07:52] given that Tina's got to go Detroit that
[2:07:56] hip under scope in his death has got to
[2:07:58] come back I'm speaking it I'm claiming
[2:08:01] it if the super Antoinette this is
[2:08:05] imagine where is body tears are 21 your
[2:08:08] you can imagine the kind of competition
[2:08:11] we would have you imagine a bottle and
[2:08:14] then immediately the kind of competition
[2:08:16] they have dancing on the land rather up
[2:08:19] how it's gonna be we're gonna have a
[2:08:21] grand time you could have a wonderful
[2:08:23] time it's gonna be a jubilee time
[2:08:28] is there anybody in the house this
[2:08:31] morning
[2:08:39] listen I'm stressed and I'm stressing
[2:08:42] that people
[2:08:43] I never say God really knows how much to
[2:08:45] give everybody because I peepee with
[2:08:51] stress and I do with real stress every
[2:08:55] railroad stress and when you watch
[2:08:58] stress and see what makes somebody say
[2:09:00] laughter oh gosh you rue falling out and
[2:09:02] the Pipers me Bucknam and somebody holds
[2:09:08] frontally house for loans like that pipe
[2:09:09] we could patch that up dodo do like a
[2:09:13] all frustrated but I ran a prism I said
[2:09:16] why we so tossed about so easy to get
[2:09:19] frustrated you know I don't know corny
[2:09:23] but some time ago I heard some noise I
[2:09:26] was a lizard
[2:09:35] now the we need noise key embroidery I
[2:09:39] thought it was out serious crisis ism
[2:09:43] what is stress and stress no if I live
[2:09:50] there cause that brother weather
[2:09:51] assumption what happened welcome to the
[2:10:02] reality is the trials and the situation
[2:10:04] in your life and that's why gold
[2:10:06] couldn't send Goliath David upfront you
[2:10:10] have to go through the line and the beer
[2:10:12] so based on his experience now dealing
[2:10:15] with these two elements he now had a
[2:10:18] resume to prevent the king Sol then
[2:10:23] based on my job experience and my
[2:10:25] qualifications I am the only man to
[2:10:28] apply for this job and he was in fact
[2:10:32] the only applicant so when so receive
[2:10:36] his resume if you listen this job has
[2:10:40] benefits you get my water you get this
[2:10:45] and give it there with the
[2:10:48] qualifications in know feel encouraged
[2:10:50] because there is no doubt in his mind he
[2:10:53] walked here with a sling and with a
[2:10:55] stick hunting I'm sillas announced video
[2:10:58] I'll chop your head off his experience
[2:11:00] and confidence in the court that he
[2:11:02] delivered him was bigger than what he
[2:11:05] had in his hand his confidence and
[2:11:07] covers bigger and what his eyes could
[2:11:10] see or even the eyes of the East our
[2:11:12] practitioners who were reviewing his
[2:11:14] performance come to church payment but
[2:11:18] when he chopped the head off after
[2:11:20] Israel paused the people I was really
[2:11:23] dead Dennis added shoten and is
[2:11:26] rejoicing because I recognize that Gilad
[2:11:29] was finished
[2:11:30] so your trials and your testings and
[2:11:33] your lizard and your lions and your
[2:11:35] beers are all to prepare you for your
[2:11:38] own experience with Goliath because we
[2:11:41] all have our Goliath the deal with but
[2:11:45] as the pastor always says for every
[2:11:48] Goliath there is a stone with his name
[2:11:51] on it
[2:11:52] and our responsibility is to connect
[2:11:56] Goliath head with a stone that has his
[2:12:00] name on it
[2:12:01] that's what overcome irzu overcome a
[2:12:03] rhinestone the match against Goliath so
[2:12:07] they could be a Goliath in your life
[2:12:09] right now what we are trying to do this
[2:12:11] morning is to find all the stones for
[2:12:14] every Goliath because every girl is will
[2:12:17] be destroyed because baby's ministry is
[2:12:21] on the earth but a random message but
[2:12:24] the winners back the Divas ministry
[2:12:26] which is not the ministry of man but for
[2:12:29] the benefit that David is Christ on
[2:12:32] Christ and his bride in David's ministry
[2:12:35] can the church amen
[2:12:41] the musicians you get ready I'm almost
[2:12:43] done
[2:12:44] the past is being preached one so all
[2:12:50] these years we have been under military
[2:12:54] preparation what is military preparation
[2:12:57] is the Ministry of the word the minister
[2:13:00] was you cannot send a man out in the
[2:13:02] battle if he hasn't been trained and
[2:13:05] it's different kinds of training there's
[2:13:07] physical training there's mental
[2:13:09] training then psychological training if
[2:13:12] they make training when you go to these
[2:13:15] military schools they have you study
[2:13:17] what you disease are did what Napoleon
[2:13:19] did what alexander degraded what Hitler
[2:13:23] did all the strategies because when you
[2:13:25] go onto the battlefield you don't know
[2:13:27] what strategy you have to use and you
[2:13:31] can't have it in mind only in Buzzbee
[2:13:33] demonstration you have to to shoot if
[2:13:35] you know all the Therrien you can't
[2:13:37] shoot straight the enemy is there
[2:13:40] there's the enemy you telling them shoot
[2:13:42] on it and you should know me we want to
[2:13:47] be under beam you want to be on the
[2:13:49] target one of the identify the enemy
[2:13:52] wherever he is at and be able to please
[2:13:55] your target and you are directly on him
[2:13:58] because once you direct the one which is
[2:14:00] your weapon to him he has to go the sort
[2:14:03] of the sort of bridge which is the Word
[2:14:05] of God can address name in my mind you
[2:14:10] could begin to play something software a
[2:14:12] lot to finish this message some other
[2:14:13] time but every service what are we doing
[2:14:17] getting ready for a holy war a spiritual
[2:14:22] battle a final showdown and we are
[2:14:24] waiting for dynamics to take us to the
[2:14:28] final battle God has been waiting for
[2:14:30] the right keys on the right time the
[2:14:32] right people and I say this morning sir
[2:14:34] this is the time God has to pull you out
[2:14:36] from the world you have to be baptized
[2:14:39] filled with the Holy Ghost go to place
[2:14:41] of trying to reach adoption and in
[2:14:43] silence
[2:14:44] when your family could understand you
[2:14:46] when nobody could understand you God has
[2:14:49] been preparing you so I pay again this
[2:14:51] morning this is not the time for you to
[2:14:54] die this is not the time for us to run
[2:14:56] and hide a defender this morning we
[2:14:58] declare that the time has come to stand
[2:15:00] and having an oil to keep on standing
[2:15:04] don't give up after your try talking to
[2:15:08] your children don't give up stand after
[2:15:10] your replies a job after job don't give
[2:15:13] up stand after your pray for the Holy
[2:15:16] Ghost don't get up stand having it all
[2:15:19] and after your side and you cried and
[2:15:23] after your pride him and tried him and
[2:15:26] you press your way and it seemed as if
[2:15:28] nothing is working out still can having
[2:15:31] it all to stand let everything go wrong
[2:15:35] with the Barrow say let everybody else
[2:15:36] possible let the others prosper let the
[2:15:38] men who ever form of godliness denied a
[2:15:41] power but if you know I used can you
[2:15:46] stand regardless as the whole world
[2:15:49] tells you down you can just assume you
[2:15:52] won't be read from that word because the
[2:15:55] battle is the Lord's battle just keep on
[2:15:58] standing who wasn't a Lord
[2:16:00] Tidus morning and you lift your hand
[2:16:02] this morning and give God praise we have
[2:16:06] a commission from God to make a church
[2:16:08] that will make a revival another
[2:16:11] Ephesians another book of Acts to kill
[2:16:14] kill every Phyllis time every Amalekite
[2:16:17] you may be seated for a minute
[2:16:22] so I'm going a little bit too beyond to
[2:16:28] drive them out to citizen kill them all
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:36] so their driver because it's your land
[2:16:39] but our ministry it's not just a tribe
[2:16:41] amount it's a kill them all because in
[2:16:45] every age throughout history and the
[2:16:48] Bible supports it destroy them kill them
[2:16:51] all
[2:16:51] destroy them kill them all there's only
[2:16:53] kill em expel the sun's energy but it is
[2:16:58] these spirits for all ages that are
[2:17:00] still in the church today and that's why
[2:17:03] we're the random talk about if we could
[2:17:05] design withstand the two-spirit working
[2:17:08] within the framework of the church but
[2:17:11] this is the only age where the Egyptians
[2:17:14] you see today you will see them no more
[2:17:17] forever this is the only age we're
[2:17:20] sittin at the end we'll be bound by
[2:17:22] circumstance bound for thousand years
[2:17:25] but years they couldn't find him they
[2:17:27] would hold her a season you would come
[2:17:29] back home but after this is its thousand
[2:17:32] years bone it's about finished and we
[2:17:35] shall reign on the earth the devil has
[2:17:37] been squatting on this earth for a long
[2:17:39] time but the bread of brought up that is
[2:17:42] the Prince of the power of the air that
[2:17:45] is infected the land is injected and
[2:17:48] that's why it's been a battle since Adam
[2:17:50] cell until now that's why God has a new
[2:17:53] heaven and a new earth
[2:17:54] cover them fire to consume this place
[2:17:58] but this brine will be that elect ladies
[2:18:01] the gamma rays up into the holy city New
[2:18:04] Jerusalem will make the rapture that
