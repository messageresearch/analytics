You can turn the key for that. Amen. At this time, we like to change the order of the service. And it is our privilege to welcome to the platform our precious Reverend Timothy Redhead all the way from Grenada. You appreciate him tonight as he comes to minister the word of God to us. Let us stick in the spirit as we look to see what God will speak to us tonight in a mighty way. Amen. And as you welcome into the platform, come in the strength and the power. Oh come, oh come one more time. Holy Spirit, I need sweet spirit I pray. Oh God in thy strength and thy power. Oh, come in thine own special your way. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, eternal father in song. We have asked for you to come in our hearts. We need you to come, &gt;&gt; Lord. In our minds, we cannot do anything if you don't come. And so, Father, we are dependent on you. And to do that, we yield ourselves. We yield our body, your soul, and spirit to you. The word is yours. The people are yours. I am yours. And without you, nothing can be done. And so, we depend on you, Lord, in the little time that we have that you speak to hearts. Speak to me too, Lord, cuz I need help for myself. And so, we pray that you will take full charge. Thank you for the songs. Thank you for those who made it out. We pray for those who are listening on the internet. I pray that you will bless us all. Have your own way now as we surrender ourselves to thee. And if there's anything that we have done that would not have been right, we beg for mercy and we plead the token. We plead the blood and we know when I see the blood, I'll pass away. So have your own way tonight in Jesus precious name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. You turn around and greet somebody next to you. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. And I don't have a lot of time, so help me. And I need your help because I'm from a little place way back in Grenada. So I am not international. So I am praying for the God to help me and that you would help me also so that I'll be able to slip in a little thought within the time that we have. I when we were coming up we see a lot of traffic and a lot of um challenges but by the grace of God we are here. &gt;&gt; I actually came to Trinidad to rest but I realized when you come by brother oid he have to rest. So I I accepted the the invitation and I said, "Okay, brother." Because we are fraternal brothers and we go back a long way and in Trinidad um I always try to ensure that I listen to him when he's preaching because you have a real man of God here. So I greet you all from Headstone Tabernacle. And I had to write this down because like I said I'm just passing through and I if I miss anybody it is not intentional and I want to greet the church and I extend sincere and fraternal greetings to brother and pastor Reverend Oid and his distinguished clergy members that stand behind him in support. But I also must ask permission to extend special greetings to brother Isaac. Raise up brother Isaac. and um and and I see in him uh uh something a chip of the old block. There are other chips but they know old as that. So I I I greet him and encourage him to keep pressing and God knows exactly what he's doing and there's always somebody to step in and we are getting older. Brother Oven and I incidentally are same age. So we found that out recently and we were trying to figure out who look older. So I look older and he is right behind. So by the grace of God, I trust that we have a little time here.
