[13:10] And hear me [singing] when
[13:13] I call.
[13:17] [music and singing]
[13:18] And here me when
[13:22] I call.
[13:25] [music]
[13:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:28] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[13:34] That's the kind of father we have this
[13:35] [music] evening. Amen.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So, Amen. This evening
[13:39] we have a a message from Brother Bam
[13:43] entitled wisdom versus faith. Amen. So,
[13:46] you [music] enjoy the word this evening.
[13:48] Amen. Brother, you may have your seat.
[13:51] Praise God.
[13:55] No bless
[13:56] &gt;&gt; that word in that church, that group of
[13:58] believers has CREATED THAT ATMOSPHERE.
[14:00] NOW, HOW IS THE WORD IN ITS SIMPLICITY
[14:04] BUT yet in its completeness ever going
[14:06] to grow in a place where knowledge
[14:08] overshadows that and says it can't be
[14:10] so?
[14:12] &gt;&gt; See, it can't.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; SO, WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS PREACHED FROM A
[14:17] SEMINARY, the children die.
[14:20] Where faith IS PREACHED FROM THE WORD,
[14:23] the children live.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the difference. Just life
[14:26] and death. The same thing happened in
[14:28] the Garden of Eden. That's exactly what
[14:30] happened to them two atmospheres there.
[14:31] When Eve got off the right one, on the
[14:33] wrong one, she died.
[14:35] It'll do it every time. So, they cannot
[14:38] stay. If your church has got that kind
[14:40] of atmosphere, old child, if you want to
[14:42] live,
[14:43] &gt;&gt; you believe the word.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Now, here's going to be a little stinger
[14:49] now. And I don't mean it in no harsh
[14:51] way. I just This is teaching. You have
[14:53] to when you hit these places, you have
[14:55] to sting and burn a little. You see, I
[14:58] just like branding a calf. I used to
[15:00] hate to do that to brand a calf. Poor
[15:03] little fella when you run out there and
[15:05] I don't know whether you have a calf
[15:06] roped or not. And and and and time hog
[15:09] time. See across and a poor little guy.
[15:11] You run down there and take his hot
[15:12] Brandon arm socket on him. Oh brother,
[15:16] it looked horrible. When he got up, he
[15:18] really had a running spell. He just run
[15:19] and kick and holler and beller and go
[15:21] on. But I tell you, they know from then
[15:23] on who he belonged to.
[15:26] [laughter]
[15:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; They know what what pastor he belonged
[15:30] on.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; There's no joke about it then.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; So that's brand.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; That's brand.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And they said, you know, many
[15:42] of you read or sang the cowboys
[15:44] meditation, you see. And the stray
[15:46] yearling when they get him in on the
[15:48] last at the roundup, the stray yearling,
[15:50] they just make soup out of him because
[15:51] he ain't no brand on him at all. So the
[15:53] rest of them goes on to their own
[15:54] pastors. But the boss of the roundup,
[15:57] Moses cattle. So if you brand hurts. Now
[16:00] look, Satan could scientifically prove
[16:04] by his wisdom.
[16:07] Now, I'm going to play the part of a
[16:08] doctor here for a few minutes. Satan
[16:11] could scientifically prove by his wisdom
[16:14] that the soil that he was going to give
[16:17] for the human race to grow in had
[16:19] vitamins.
[16:21] Sure did. He could scientifically prove
[16:23] it. They can scientifically prove
[16:24] anything they want to almost. See? Sure.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; It had uh vitamin P,
[16:31] pleasure, popularity.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; That's in it. That's in his wisdom,
[16:35] sorrow. Sure.
[16:38] Sure. All the worldly pleasure, all the
[16:39] picture shows, all the dances, all I
[16:42] think. Go ahead, that's all right. It
[16:42] won't hurt nothing. Sure.
[16:45] Popularity. Well, biggest church is in
[16:47] the city.
[16:49] All right. It had vitamin C in it, which
[16:52] he referred to as common sense. Makes
[16:55] reason. See, it had vitamin R in it,
[16:58] which meant reasonings. Yeah, he could
[17:01] reason, but you see
[17:04] that won't work. It had vitamin B be in
[17:07] it which means beauty.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Satan is beautiful. Sin's beautiful. And
[17:12] as sin begins to get more and more more
[17:14] beautiful it becomes. How much better
[17:16] house we got today in the log house? How
[17:18] much more prettier is it? How much
[17:21] prettier is our women today than it used
[17:22] to be? See how much prettier is Florida
[17:26] it was now in the way God created.
[17:29] [clears throat] See it's got beauty. How
[17:31] many knows that Satan is a beauty and he
[17:33] desired beauty and tried to create a
[17:35] beauty, more beautiful kingdom and so
[17:37] forth? Sure, we know it. Satan is in
[17:39] beauty. Now notice
[17:44] he had vitamin R which is reasoning,
[17:46] vitamin B which is beauty, vitamin M
[17:49] which is modern.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to be modern?
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Just take his knowledge and find out if
[17:56] you don't believe that stuff.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; It'll grow right in you. that bottom
[17:59] will come right up where you're sitting
[18:01] some fellow stand up giving you some of
[18:02] his knowledge. Now look friends, what
[18:04] would it be if we took this great lovely
[18:07] cathedral here and had a lot of
[18:09] screaming and crying and speaking in
[18:11] tongues and run up and down the floor
[18:13] frothing at the mouth like mad dogs and
[18:15] and what do you think the mayor of the
[18:16] city would say deacon board if we
[18:17] permitted such a stuff as that to come
[18:19] in here? Oh sure it's modern.
[18:22] You think our people stand down there on
[18:24] the street with a tambourine their hand
[18:26] and
[18:27] &gt;&gt; what would it do if our sisters had come
[18:29] with big long hair hanging down and the
[18:31] rest of the church women going through
[18:32] town? Look at there. Look at there.
[18:34] While the pres this church ever wanted,
[18:36] you know, well, look, look at there. She
[18:37] looked like an old model, don't she? Her
[18:39] spare tire is going flat on the back.
[18:42] You know, something like that. WE WANT
[18:43] TO BE MODERN.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE DEVIL'S WISDOM.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT GROWS. THAT'S THE VITAMIN
[18:50] that's in the soil that comes out in the
[18:51] product that it produces.
[18:54] Go on, you modern Jezebel. All right.
[18:57] Modern. Like the women of today.
[19:00] Sure. Oh, modern. One of the most modern
[19:03] people in the town will come to the
[19:04] church. Sure. It's got Why? They grow in
[19:07] that modern vitamin. [laughter]
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Reasoning vitamin. Arth they grow in
[19:14] that. See, that's what it is. Reasoning.
[19:16] But as soon as you start growing in
[19:17] that, you're dead to the word.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; You have to deny the word before you can
[19:21] be that.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; See,
[19:25] &gt;&gt; the only way you can EVER BE A SINNER IS
[19:27] to deny God's word.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; What is sin? Unbelief. Unbelief in what?
[19:33] God's word.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; See, you have to deny the word first.
[19:38] Now, oh, I got about 10 more vitamins
[19:41] wrote down here. But here's one vitamin
[19:43] that he failed to tell him. He had
[19:44] vitamin D in there. That's the biggest
[19:47] vitamin in there. Results dead.
[19:51] It's the prettiest bunch of dress
[19:53] people. Most modern there is. Most
[19:55] beautiful church. Biggest organization.
[19:58] See, most modern there was, most
[20:01] beautiful there was, the most reasonable
[20:03] things CAN BE SAID. WHY wouldn't if God
[20:06] made us a creature of his? Why would he
[20:09] condemn these women from looking their
[20:11] best to have short hair? Why would he
[20:14] condemn a little makeup? Well, he had
[20:16] one in the Bible that did it and he fed
[20:17] her to the dogs. So, [laughter] think
[20:19] about that.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD WHY WOULD GOD MY MY HE DON'T
[20:26] EXPECT us to live after that Bible. He
[20:27] sure did. He told E she must live. He
[20:29] told Jesus said that man lives by the
[20:31] every word every word that proceedth out
[20:34] of the mouth of God.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Who said that? Jesus. Is that right? He
[20:38] said, "If any other man said anything
[20:40] different, let him be a liar. His word
[20:43] be true. Heavens and earth will pass
[20:44] away but my word shall not. There you
[20:46] are. So vitamin D lays in his formula
[20:51] &gt;&gt; modern. That's right. Now
[20:56] but the word seed of the Bible can't
[20:58] grow IN SUCH GROUND AS THAT. How could a
[21:02] person going to one of those modern
[21:03] churches now the spirit of God come up
[21:05] on them
[21:07] and they uh they WANT TO HOLLER GLORY TO
[21:09] GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[21:12] YOU KNOW WHAT? Why you make the preacher
[21:14] swallow sermon? Well, I'm telling you, I
[21:18] I could just seem say [clears throat]
[21:20] and all them cranes there stretch that
[21:22] neck around, you know, look around and
[21:24] see, well, what said that? [laughter]
[21:28] Then a few minutes a preacher say Jesus
[21:30] Christ,
[21:32] THE SON OF GOD. GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S
[21:34] RIGHT. [clears throat]
[21:36] &gt;&gt; DEACONS, you're you're at the door a few
[21:39] minutes. They'll throw you right out.
[21:41] See, the word can't grow there. Just
[21:43] can't do it. No. Just can't do it. See?
[21:46] Just simply can't.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; See, and then he come spread his poison
[21:50] on top of it to try to kill the germ
[21:52] life in you. Now, we a group of people
[21:55] in the land today that believes that God
[21:57] heals. Well, of course, we know
[22:00] reasonable sense shows that God gave us
[22:02] doctors to heal.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Now, you asked a good, sensible doctor
[22:06] if he's a healer.
[22:09] Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; He'll tell you, "No, sir.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; I can move a tooth, but I can't heal a
[22:15] socket it comes out of."
[22:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. I can set an arm, but I
[22:19] can't heal it.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY RIGHT. GOD IS A HEALER.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; NOW, how is something ever going to grow
[22:25] in such stuff as that?
[22:27] &gt;&gt; How can the seed word ever grow in such
[22:29] as that? This won't do. It can't grow in
[22:31] that kind of an atmosphere. It just
[22:33] certainly don't. But faith only grows in
[22:38] one vitamin.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; It only has one vitamin. Don't have to
[22:42] have any mixture at all.
[22:44] FAITH GROWS IN ONE VITAMIN. THAT'S THE
[22:47] WORD.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that faith CAN
[22:50] GROW IN IS THE WORD. And the only WAY
[22:52] THAT IT CAN GROW IS BECAUSE IT BELIEVES
[22:54] THE WORD. AND IT HAS TO TAKE ALL THE
[22:57] WORD AND BELIEVE IT'S TRUTH. And faith
[23:00] vitamin is spelled in a little
[23:03] four-letter word L I E LIFE. IT HAS
[23:06] VITAMIN L. Faith has
[23:10] &gt;&gt; faith has vitamin L. Wisdom has vitamin
[23:14] P, vitamin R, pleasure, vitamin reason,
[23:18] vitamin all these other vitamins. That
[23:21] fa uh re UH KNOWLEDGE HAS ALL THAT. SEE,
[23:24] wisdom has all that reasons AND NOW. BUT
[23:27] FAITH ONLY HAS ONE THING,
[23:29] &gt;&gt; LIFE.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; That's all IT'LL STAY. THY WORD IS LIFE.
[23:34] THY WORD IS TRUTH. HE IS THE WORD, THE
[23:36] WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Faith only hangs right there. That's
[23:41] all. IT WON'T TAKE IT. HOLY SPIRIT LIFE,
[23:46] ETERNAL LIFE. THAT'S WHERE FAITH GROWS
[23:48] IN WORD. ZOEY, GOD'S OWN LIFE. AMEN.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; That's the ONLY PLACE THAT FAITH CAN
[23:53] WORK IS WHEN THE FAITH
[23:56] HEARS THE WORD AND BELIEVES THAT IT'S
[23:59] GOD'S WORD.
[24:01] THEN IN THAT ZOEY, IT grows
[24:05] and it produces what the word said.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; God, how'd he make the world? Do you
[24:10] believe the world was in God's thoughts?
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; HAD TO BE. HOW DID HE MAKE IT? HE JUST
[24:16] SAID, "WHERE'S HE GOING TO GET THE
[24:18] THINGS? HOW COULD YOU EVER REASON WITH
[24:19] GOD?" SAY, "GOD, WHERE'D YOU GET THE
[24:21] MATERIAL to make the rocks out of?
[24:24] Where'd you They come from gases.
[24:25] WHERE'D YOU GET THE GAS, LORD?" SEE,
[24:28] how'd you ever make water? What is from
[24:30] H2O? WHERE'D YOU GET THE HYDROGEN oxygen
[24:32] at? See, that's it.
[24:35] See, it just doesn't make sense. What
[24:37] did God say? IT WAS IN HIS THOUGHTS.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; And his thoughts IS HIS WORD BEFORE IT'S
[24:41] EXPRESSED.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; THEN WHEN HIS THOUGHTS
[24:45] SAID, "LET THERE BE." AND THERE WAS.
[24:48] AMEN.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; There's where faith.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; By the Hebrews 11 said, "By faith, the
[24:53] world was created. The world was made by
[24:57] faith." God made the world out of things
[24:59] that does not appear. By faith, God
[25:02] spoke the world INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE
[25:04] IT WAS a it was a pre-meditated
[25:09] word.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; But as SOON AS HE SAID IT, IT BECOME
[25:12] LIFE. AMEN.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Now you can say, "I believe that,
[25:16] brother Brandham." In your heart, YOU
[25:18] CAN BELIEVE IT. THEN EXPRESS IT.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Don't never change it at
[25:24] all. Stay right with it. Watch what'll
[25:26] grow out of it. It'll produce the word
[25:29] &gt;&gt; because it's faith. See, wisdom takes
[25:32] you away. Faith brings you to it. SEE
[25:35] THAT? THAT CUTS out every man-made
[25:39] creed.
[25:41] cuts out every school of learning of
[25:43] man-made theology.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Just knocks them cold.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; There are their professor DD PhD lq and
[25:52] all these fellas has to go to school and
[25:54] learn psychology and all these other
[25:55] things. There's only one thing he leaves
[25:57] out.
[25:59] How to present himself with psychology
[26:01] and what kind of clothes to wear and how
[26:02] he must say a man just so and oh
[26:05] nonsense.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Let be led by the Holy Spirit.
[26:11] Sons of God are led by the spirit of
[26:12] God. Not the wisdom of the seminary, but
[26:15] the spirit of God leads the sons and
[26:17] daughters of God.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Certainly, it's true.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[26:22] let's out every creed, every school of
[26:25] learning, every man-made theology. No
[26:27] wonder they can't believe.
[26:30] There's nothing in there for it to grow
[26:31] on.
[26:33] They got vitamin R reasoning that we're
[26:36] supposed to cast away. Vitamin
[26:39] popularity, vitamin pleasure. You just
[26:41] got to have a little fun. What kind of
[26:43] fun? Oh, get out. Got a little drunk
[26:44] once in a while. You know, just have a
[26:45] little fun. It won't make any
[26:46] difference. You know, little things like
[26:49] that that all that all that vitamin C.
[26:51] And how is that kind of a vitamin ever
[26:53] going to grow a word that denies that
[26:55] vitamin?
[26:57] &gt;&gt; How you going to do it?
[26:58] &gt;&gt; See, the word denies that if you love
[27:01] the world or the things of the world,
[27:02] the love of God's not even in you, said
[27:04] the Bible. So, how's a how's God's how's
[27:07] God's word go to grow under vitamins
[27:09] like that? It takes a certain vitamin in
[27:11] the soil to produce the grain.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the right kind of
[27:14] soil. We'll get into it just a little
[27:16] bit. See, it's got to have the right
[27:17] kind of soil. It won't grow the grain.
[27:19] You take certain grounds, it won't grow
[27:20] this and we'll grow something else.
[27:22] Sandy grounds and different vitamins and
[27:24] certain grows certain things that don't
[27:26] why you ain't got it and it just won't
[27:28] grow it. That's all. Now, weeds will
[27:31] grow pretty anywhere. Yeah. [laughter]
[27:35] any kind of ground. Isn't that right?
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Whole denominational weeds grow
[27:41] anywhere. But I'm telling you, brother,
[27:42] if you want to produce the fruits of
[27:44] life, she has to come out of the word.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Sure. All right. I hope I ain't taking
[27:50] you all too long this morning. See, now
[27:52] don't see. All right. No wonder they
[27:55] can't believe they have nothing to live
[27:56] in. Jesus spoke of them in Matthew the
[28:00] 13th chapter and the first verse. Let's
[28:03] just turn over here and see what Jesus
[28:04] said about these things that we're
[28:06] talking of Matthew the 13th chapter and
[28:09] in the first verse.
[28:13] The same day Jesus went out of the house
[28:15] and sat by the seaside and great
[28:17] multitudes were gathered unto him so
[28:19] that he went into his ship and sat down
[28:21] and the whole multitude stood on the
[28:23] shore. And he spake unto them things in
[28:27] spake many things unto them in parable,
[28:30] saying, Behold, a ser went forth to sow
[28:33] seed. And when he sowed, some seed fell
[28:37] by the wayside, and the fowls came and
[28:39] devoured them up. Some fell on stony
[28:42] grounds. And when they had not much
[28:45] earth, and for with they sprang up
[28:48] because they had no depths of earth. And
[28:53] when the sun was up, they were scorched
[28:56] and came and because they had no root,
[28:59] they withered away. Some fell among
[29:01] thorns, and the thorns sprung up and
[29:04] choked them out. Others fell in good
[29:07] ground and brought forth some brought
[29:10] forth fruit, some 100fold, 60, and
[29:13] 30fold. Who has ears to hear, let him
[29:16] hear, not wisdom, ears. See? All right.
[29:21] Hearing it. All right. Notice
[29:26] he said, "Some went forth when the seed
[29:29] went forth, preached the word, some fell
[29:32] by the wayside, just like water on a
[29:35] duck's back runs right off."
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Some fell upon rocky ground, stony.
[29:42] And it had just a little dust that
[29:44] blowed up there and it sprung up but it
[29:47] didn't have no roots, no place to put
[29:49] its roots.
[29:51] Now I'm going to make illustrations here
[29:52] and I hope I don't hurt no feelings. See
[29:55] that was the Catholic church. They said
[29:58] it's built on a rock. I'll agree with
[30:00] them. I sure will agree with them.
[30:03] That's right. That's right. No earth on
[30:05] it at all. No earth on it to grow from.
[30:07] Why? They couldn't produce a They
[30:09] couldn't produce a B B B B B B B B B B B
[30:10] B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
[30:10] B B B B B B B B B Bible vitam because
[30:11] they don't even believe in it. They
[30:13] doctrine is dogmas.
[30:15] That's right. Roman dogma, no word in it
[30:18] at all. See, fell up on rocks. That was
[30:21] a super wisdom. Oh, brother. I'm telling
[30:23] you, they had it in a super way. They
[30:26] presented in a way of psychology of
[30:27] great big buildings and fine dress. Look
[30:30] like holy gods of priests and everything
[30:32] else. How many heard that testimony?
[30:34] That little nun that just got out. You
[30:35] got it. Yeah. I want that played some
[30:36] Wednesday night. your church and every
[30:38] person here should have the testimony.
[30:40] One of them followed me for a long time.
[30:41] How they I went down there in Mexico
[30:43] myself and seen them lying pits where
[30:45] them nuns babies when the priest had
[30:47] them babies where they burnt them lying
[30:49] pits and things like that. That's what
[30:50] made communism spring up in Mexico. They
[30:53] broke up that Tommy rot. That's what
[30:54] made communism spring up in our Don't
[30:56] you never fear communism? God's using
[30:58] communism.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in it. It's of the
[31:01] devil. But God takes a devil and comes
[31:02] right back around like he did King
[31:03] Nebuchadnezzar. Come over and got
[31:05] Israel. See, you watch the Bible don't
[31:07] prove it. One of these days, we'll go
[31:08] into it. God raised it right up to
[31:10] avenge the children of God on that old
[31:12] That's exactly what the Bible
[31:13] says.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Said it burn with fire and she'd come to
[31:17] the end of her doom. That's exactly
[31:18] what's going to happen to her, too.
[31:20] There she is. That's the one that fell
[31:21] up on rocks. Just so little of soil to
[31:25] the thing couldn't grow. It died. Then
[31:27] that was super wisdom. Then some fell on
[31:30] the Protestant's ground. But after a
[31:33] while, the great wisdom of the big
[31:35] denominations choked it out. Choked the
[31:38] spirit out. Days of miracles had passed.
[31:40] Dr. So and so said so and so. See, no
[31:42] such a thing. Just perfect.
[31:45] Choked all choked all the what out?
[31:48] Choked out the spirit for the wisdom.
[31:50] See, the Holy Spirit fell in the days of
[31:52] Martin Luther. The Holy Spirit fell in
[31:54] the days of John Wesley. The Holy Spirit
[31:57] fell in the days of the early
[31:58] Pentecostal church. But what's the
[31:59] denomination's done with their wisdom
[32:01] have choked it out.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Choked out what? The seed. What is the
[32:06] seed? The word.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that means this there.
[32:10] See, they get it. Many honestarted men
[32:12] of those ministers. I met him sit down
[32:13] and talk to them. Even on the subject of
[32:15] baptism and many things I've asked
[32:17] anybody to come to discuss it. They
[32:19] said, "Brother Brennham, IF WE DO THAT,
[32:21] OUR CHURCH WOULD PUT US OUT." I SAID,
[32:22] "WHO'S more to you? The word of God or
[32:24] your church?
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You'll never go no further." And that's
[32:28] dust of denomination. See?
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; All right. If it denies the word, it's
[32:34] wrong. See, it shows it's man-made
[32:36] wisdom. Now, the Protestants got choked
[32:40] out. It choked the spirit right out of
[32:42] them when they begin to take wisdom
[32:43] instead of faith in the word. The wisdom
[32:46] in the organization,
[32:48] the organizational wisdom instead of
[32:51] faith in the word.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; All understand that? Say amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. faith in what the what the group
[32:59] of men of the Methodist, Baptist,
[33:02] Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Evangelicals
[33:04] and all got together and soon they're to
[33:07] form up a confederation of church which
[33:10] will be the image to the beast
[33:12] &gt;&gt; and he will have the same power in this
[33:15] nation. Revelations 13:11 that they had
[33:17] over there and will cause a persecution
[33:19] upon the saints just like they did at
[33:21] the beginning of the Roman church. See,
[33:23] that's where it's heading right up now.
[33:25] That's why the word's being sold RIGHT
[33:26] NOW EVERYWHERE. STAY AWAY FROM IT.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; GET OUT of it. See, now
[33:33] wisdom choked it out. Their own wisdom
[33:37] strangled the Holy Spirit away from
[33:39] them. Let me prove it to you in the
[33:41] Bible, Revelations, the third chapter.
[33:42] When we just got through the church
[33:43] ages, JESUS HAD BEEN STRANGLED FROM HIS
[33:46] CHURCH AND WAS ON THE OUTSIDE TRYING TO
[33:47] KNOCK ON THE door and get back in.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it said. I stand at
[33:52] the door and knock. If any man will
[33:53] thirst, if you just let me in, I'll
[33:55] come. But nobody opened the door. See,
[33:57] they put him out. What was it? They had
[34:00] the the seed fell on them. See? See? But
[34:03] some fell in the valley of persecution.
[34:09] Some seed went over into the valley of
[34:12] persecution. Now, in the valley, it's
[34:14] where you find the water.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; The best soil.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you take somebody's been beat
[34:19] down, so he's got all the theology beat
[34:21] out of him, laughed out of him, made fun
[34:24] of him, where he's been through the
[34:25] mills and ground it all out of him till
[34:27] the metal's been ready to work. You'll
[34:29] find out there's some moisture around
[34:31] there.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Into the valley. That fell's been
[34:34] pitched over into the valley, kicked out
[34:36] of his organization, is down in the
[34:37] dumps, they call it.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Not the dumps, but the valley. We're
[34:41] down in the valley. You know, that's
[34:43] where the lily girls, too, you know.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. in the valley. All right.
[34:49] Some fell in the valley of persecutions.
[34:54] Hard trials. Some of them seed fell in
[34:56] there. Valley of persecutions. Hard
[35:00] trials.
[35:01] Be called everything like the lily was
[35:03] called be elub made fun of. But in this
[35:07] valley is the rivers of water.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Psalms one said, "Blessed is the name."
[35:15] Let me just read it. Let me show what's
[35:17] in this valley.
[35:19] What Psalms I thought I wouldn't have
[35:21] time but we just take time. Amen.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; See to read it. See to have this here.
[35:26] Lord
[35:26] &gt;&gt; we are going to read this and see what
[35:28] this man is down here. That's just where
[35:30] he's planted. If he's planted on the
[35:32] upon a dusty desert rock where there's
[35:36] no ground at all or is he planted in the
[35:38] valley? All right. Blessed is the man
[35:41] that walketh not in the counsel the
[35:43] wisdom.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Walkth not in the counsel of the
[35:56] ungodly. Standeth in the way of sinners.
[35:59] Siteth in the seat with the scornful.
[36:02] But his delight is in the law of the
[36:04] Lord, the word. And in the law word does
[36:08] he meditate day and night. And he shall
[36:11] be like a tree that's planted
[36:13] &gt;&gt; by the rivers of water.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Rivers. What is that? The nine spiritual
[36:19] gifts. Rivers of one water, one spirit.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; One water. They're coming from nine
[36:24] different resources.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Rivers of water. See, rivers of water
[36:31] that bringeth forth his fruit, fruit of
[36:34] the spirit in his season, his leaves
[36:37] also shall not wither. And whatsoever he
[36:40] does, it shall prosper.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; See, some fell down in that valley there
[36:46] where these rivers are.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Well, as you noticed, I want to get
[36:49] something else. What was it done? It
[36:52] fell down in the river. It wasn't set
[36:54] out, but you shall be like a tree that's
[36:56] set out.
[36:58] transposed from this to that.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; He was planted.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; What? PREDESTINATED.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHT OF GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[37:11] WORLD PLACED HIM THERE.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Not stuck out.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; NOT BY CHANCE.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; BUT WAS PLANTED, PREDESTINATED.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[37:24] &gt;&gt; To the rivers of water.
[37:28] Oh, his root shall not wither.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; THOUGH HE DIES, I'LL RAISE HIM UP AGAIN
[37:36] AT THE LAST DAY.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; He's predestinated
[37:41] to be there.
[37:44] Not just by chance. He was predestinated
[37:47] to catch that word when it was sold.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; And he'll be right there. And when it
[37:50] sticks, she's there. He's planted. Not
[37:53] just stuck down. He's actually planted.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. A lot different sticking a
[37:58] stick in the ground than planting
[37:59] something. It's different.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; The seed was planted. It found its own
[38:04] root holes.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; When the water begin to come in, break
[38:06] forth its life. The spirit it begin to
[38:09] say and say there are nine spiritual
[38:11] gifts. It said, "Amen."
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus sang yesterday and forever. Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; You still healed just like you always.
[38:24] Amen.
[38:25] Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; He He's planted by the rivers. Rivers
[38:34] &gt;&gt; coming from the other side. Rivers of
[38:36] water. No wonder he can't wither.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; No wonder.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; He's planting.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes seed fell over there. He can't
[38:45] die.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; It's right in the stream OF LIFE. IT
[38:48] KEEPS PRODUCING. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S
[38:49] DRAWING HIS LIFE OUT ON RIVERS.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; RIVERS. The New Testament. the Old
[38:54] Testament.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just being fed right on through.
[38:57] Oh, brother.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Are you going to love him?
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Are you going to praise him? Amen.
[39:08] Or are you going to worship him? Amen.
[39:11] Amen.
[39:13] Amen. Yes, sir.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. Don't you?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. brings forth his brings forth of
[39:23] his fruits in his season. Genesis 1:11.
[39:29] Bring forth his fruits. What fruits? The
[39:32] fruits of what? His fruits.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; What fruits? His own fruits.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; What fruit is it? The Bible.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; All of it's here. The fruit, love,
[39:44] you're in the Bible. Joy, you're in the
[39:45] Bible. Power, Holy Ghost, all these
[39:47] things here. Divine healing, promises of
[39:49] God. That's the fruits. Here it is. And
[39:52] if he's planted in this, this is planted
[39:54] in the the right kind of soil in faith.
[39:58] What does faith do? Faith begins to
[40:00] grow. It
[40:03] [laughter]
[40:04] &gt;&gt; begins to move her up. See, that's it.
[40:06] Moves it up. Sure. He shall be like a
[40:08] tree that's planted by the waters.
[40:10] Brings forth his fruit in the season.
[40:13] Now, what kind of a fruit will it bring
[40:15] forth? John 14:11.
[40:19] John 14:11
[40:22] he said Jesus said he at least 14:12
[40:26] Jesus said he that believeth on me the
[40:28] works that I do shall heal you also why
[40:32] the same words in he
[40:34] &gt;&gt; he was the word is that right
[40:36] &gt;&gt; and if you abide me in my words in you
[40:39] that's what you will
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Evans back
[40:44] there not long ago he come up here drive
[40:48] so far He lost his car. Said over there,
[40:51] Miller left the key in it. Somebody come
[40:54] along and stole it. He had everything he
[40:56] had in it. He come up, him and brother
[40:58] Fred and brother Tom. Some of them come
[40:59] up the house and said,
[41:01] "Well, he looked like a little kid had
[41:03] his candy taken away from him. He's just
[41:04] all whipped out, you know." He said, "I
[41:06] just don't know what I'm going to do." I
[41:07] said, "Well, what is it now?" They're
[41:09] coming. What's the first thing to the
[41:11] word?
[41:12] Ask the father. If you abide in me in my
[41:14] word, you ask what you will.
[41:18] But stay with the word. Just stay right
[41:19] with the word.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "Let's pray." We got out on the
[41:22] floor. God started praying. While we
[41:25] were praying, I said, "Father, I come to
[41:28] thee in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Here is a brother that spends works just
[41:33] a few days a week, his hands all beat
[41:35] up, fixing the old wreck cars and things
[41:38] like that to get enough money to drive
[41:40] 14-,500 miles every Sunday to come into
[41:43] the meetings.
[41:45] got a bunch of children to feed. It cost
[41:47] him about around $50 or $75 a week to
[41:50] make that trip just to come to church.
[41:52] See, right? He come up here trying to
[41:55] hear the word as we're trying to
[41:58] endeavor to contend for it. And I said,
[42:01] "Now some evil person has stole his
[42:04] car." And what was it? I said, "Now,
[42:07] Lord, I pray thee, give him back his car
[42:11] in the name of Jesus Christ." What did I
[42:14] do? I placed that word, that promise
[42:16] before God, sealed it with the name of
[42:19] Jesus and sent forth the word
[42:21] &gt;&gt; right down the road. It went way out
[42:23] there. Found the place where it started
[42:25] like a hound on a rabbit's trail. See
[42:27] here he come right down the road
[42:29] howling.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Got out there just about halfway to
[42:31] Balden Green, Kentucky. What broke
[42:33] forth? The word found him.
[42:35] [clears throat]
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Just then a vision flew back. I seen a
[42:39] man in yellow looking shirt on driving a
[42:41] young fellow once been a Christian. The
[42:43] word struck him. You're doing wrong. The
[42:46] word caught him. He sent forth his word.
[42:48] See, see, and it caught him. You're
[42:51] gonna get caught in this someday.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And the law is going to get you for
[42:55] doing this. Turn around. Take it back.
[42:57] The word got him. He had once been a
[42:59] Christian. I seen him ran up here
[43:01] standing on the side of the street. I
[43:02] said, "Brother, just take right out
[43:04] certain way here. You'll find your car.
[43:06] Wait here a while, Lord. He gets it
[43:07] back." Now, you had a full tank of
[43:08] gasoline. Yes, he said. I said there
[43:10] won't be anything bothered but there'd
[43:11] be half that gas and he calls it take
[43:13] half of it run he's about halfway to
[43:14] Bowling Green by about 100 miles of it
[43:16] run out when he found it that's the way
[43:17] it was sitting right exactly there what
[43:19] was it the word
[43:23] &gt;&gt; went and got him come back and said not
[43:25] long after that some man bought a car
[43:28] from him you slipped off and didn't pay
[43:30] it said brother Brandham I thought poor
[43:34] man ought $400 I said I prayed I sent
[43:37] the word the word went got on his back,
[43:39] found him. When he went out to find the
[43:41] man, he's never a Christian. See, he he
[43:44] did. He laughed. They asked him to go to
[43:46] church one time. He said, "Well, while a
[43:47] preacher's preaching, I look for pretty
[43:49] blondes." So, you see, you can't find
[43:51] that's that's the devil. That's See, so
[43:54] the word couldn't hold on to him. What
[43:55] the word do? It kept him in eye. See,
[43:57] just don't. Brother Welch just kept
[43:58] holding on. Said, "It'll be all right.
[43:59] It'll be all right." The word went after
[44:01] him. See, if you abide me in my word and
[44:04] you ask what you will. See, the word got
[44:07] after you. First thing you know, one of
[44:08] his boys was driving along down here on
[44:10] the road and there it was. He seen a man
[44:13] in a car, got his number, turned into
[44:16] brother Woods. They called to find out
[44:17] where it was. He was in bold and green.
[44:19] God in heaven knows and never heard one
[44:20] word about it. Know nothing about it.
[44:22] Last Sunday as we go afternoon when we
[44:24] got through preaching here, went up
[44:26] there and changed my clothes and got
[44:27] ready to go to Florida for the or down
[44:29] brother well for the meeting that
[44:31] following night when I got in the car, I
[44:34] seen that man.
[44:37] I said, "Brother Welsh," I couldn't tell
[44:38] him. Now, he's got to make a move
[44:39] himself. See, just like me, he had to
[44:40] make a decision there. See, I said,
[44:42] "We're going through Bowling Green."
[44:46] He said, "That's about 30 miles out of
[44:47] the way." Went on down the road. I
[44:49] thought, "Oh, he he he'll get it. See,
[44:51] he'll get it. He just got to get it."
[44:53] Went on down, Sister Evans. And I after
[44:56] a while, he said, "You know, Brother
[44:57] Brandon, he said, "Have I been so
[44:59] thickheaded?"
[45:04] Said, "You said Bowling Green a while
[45:05] ago." Yeah. He said, "Um, you know that
[45:08] man that got my money?" Run over with
[45:11] it. Yes. Said, "He's in Bowling Green.
[45:14] I've been thinking about this. I got a
[45:15] thing here. I'm going go turn it over
[45:16] and find him where he's at. Then I'm
[45:18] going to turn." I said, "So, what would
[45:19] you do? Would you go on down there and
[45:20] get your money?" Now, see, if I tell him
[45:22] that he's See, he's got something to do
[45:24] himself. See, he's got something to do.
[45:26] I couldn't tell him. But do it break the
[45:28] vision right there. See? So, I had to
[45:30] see just like why did Jesus stand there
[45:32] and said to MARY AND MARTHA, "TAKE YE
[45:33] AWAY THE STONE." WELL, he was God. He
[45:35] could said stone be no more and it
[45:37] wouldn't been there. But she had
[45:38] something to do. Why did he stand there
[45:40] look upon the harvest? You believe he
[45:42] was the Lord of the harvest?
[45:43] &gt;&gt; He said to his disciples, you pray the
[45:45] Lord of the harvest and he will send
[45:48] labors into his harvest. In other words,
[45:50] you ask me to do what I'm going to do.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; See, we're buddies. WE'RE IT'S A CHURCH.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO. HERE'S THE
[46:00] GOSPEL. I KNOW IT. BUT IF YOU JUST SIT
[46:02] HERE AND don't preach it, what good's IT
[46:03] GOING TO DO? YOU GOT SOMETHING TO DO.
[46:05] YOU GOT TO MAKE AN EFFORT. You got to
[46:08] You say, "Well, I believe God can heal,
[46:09] but I just don't know." STAND UP AND LET
[46:11] THAT WORD BECOME YOUR WORD.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Believe it. Don't raise it. Just believe
[46:15] it.
[46:17] I said, "Well,
[46:19] I know if he didn't go, he's going to
[46:20] lose it." I said, "If it was me,
[46:25] if it was me, I go get my money right
[46:28] now." And he did. [laughter]
[46:32] Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; When he got the man up out of the bed,
[46:34] he had some money. He called over to the
[46:36] neighbor, got dressed up and paid it
[46:37] off. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE WORD.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; SEE, if it can find a place, IT CAN
[46:42] TURN. NOW, SAME THING ON DIVINE HEALING.
[46:44] NOW, what brother Welch said, "Well,
[46:46] don't think I'll go down. Just think
[46:48] I'll go the other way." What that fell
[46:50] say, "Well, I ain't going out there with
[46:52] that car." See, it won't happen. But you
[47:02] Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Thank
[47:05] you, Jesus.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Just give him
[47:10] praise this evening.
[47:12] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father.
[47:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[47:17] be the name of the Lord. Thank you,
[47:20] Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you for
[47:21] your word this evening, Lord. Oh,
[47:24] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:27] Blessed be your name, Lord. Thank you,
[47:29] Father. Thank you, Jesus.
[47:32] Blessed be your name of the Lord. Amen.
[47:34] Many appreciate the message this
[47:36] evening.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:39] Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's
[47:43] just turn to our Bibles at this time. We
[47:46] want to switch over to the Lord's
[47:48] Supper.
[47:51] I'm going to turn to first Corinthians
[47:53] chapter 11 verses 23-32.
[48:08] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads.
[48:11] Heavenly Father, we pray that you bless
[48:14] the word as we read it now, Lord, and
[48:16] bless this portion of the service, Lord,
[48:19] where we partake of your bread and wine
[48:23] and wash one another's feet. We pray
[48:24] that you will anoint your people for
[48:26] service, anoint the word of your read
[48:29] Jesus name. Amen.
[48:32] 1 Corinthians 11.
[48:36] For I have received of the Lord that
[48:39] which also I delivered unto you, that
[48:42] the Lord Jesus, the same night in which
[48:45] he was betrayed, took bread.
[48:49] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[48:51] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[48:56] which is broken for you. This do in
[49:00] remembrance of me."
[49:02] After the same man also he took the cup
[49:05] when he had stopped saying, "This cup is
[49:08] the new testament in my blood. This do
[49:11] ye as often as you drink it in
[49:14] remembrance of me.
[49:16] For as often as you eat this bread and
[49:18] drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's
[49:21] death till he comes.
[49:24] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[49:27] and drink this cup of the Lord
[49:28] unworthily
[49:30] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[49:33] the Lord.
[49:34] But let a man examine himself. And so
[49:37] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[49:40] that cup. For he that eateth and
[49:42] drinkketh unworthily
[49:45] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[49:46] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[49:51] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[49:53] among you and many sleep. For if we
[49:57] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[50:00] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[50:03] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[50:05] be condemned with the world.
[50:09] Let us bow our heads, close our eyes.
[50:13] Our heavenly father, we are so grateful
[50:15] to be here this evening one more time in
[50:17] your presence. Lord, as we have come,
[50:20] Lord, to obey the ordinance of your
[50:22] word, Father, whereby, oh God, we
[50:25] partake of the bread and wine, Lord, of
[50:28] the bread symbolizing the body and the
[50:30] blood uh the wine, the blood of Jesus
[50:33] Christ, Father, Lord God, we pray that
[50:36] you would sanctify and bless the
[50:38] articles that have been prepared,
[50:41] Lord God. And we pray that as your
[50:43] believers would partake this evening
[50:45] that you would sanctify our hearts Lord
[50:48] and Lord lift us up in the realm of the
[50:50] spirit father Lord where we could
[50:52] experience sweet communion with you
[50:54] Father. May we have Lord love one for
[50:58] the other. And may our love for you grow
[51:01] stronger and stronger each day. Father
[51:03] Lord strengthen the weak Lord and build
[51:06] up Lord those that need building up
[51:08] Father. May your holy spirit pour out
[51:10] upon your people. Fill and refill,
[51:12] Father. And [snorts] Lord, bless the
[51:14] time of washing one another's feet where
[51:17] we would wash each other's feet with
[51:19] respect and love and appreciation for
[51:21] one another as you did, Lord, to your
[51:24] disciples. Lord, you said to do
[51:26] likewise. Father, bless your people,
[51:28] Lord. Bless each and every one of us at
[51:31] this time in Jesus name of thanksgiving.
[51:34] Amen. And amen. Amen. Keep your heads
[51:37] bowed and your eyes closed as we want to
[51:40] observe a moment of silence is where you
[51:42] would pray for the ministry and the
[51:44] ministry pray for you at this time.
[52:08] Praise the name of the Lord. You may be
[52:10] seated at this time and say I'm going to
[52:13] ask the deacons and the elders to come
[52:15] forward. Amen. As he get ready to sue.
