[14:50] finally brethren
[14:52] whatsoever things are true
[14:54] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[14:57] things are just
[14:58] whatsoever things are pure
[15:00] whatsoever things are lovely
[15:02] whatever things are of a good report
[15:05] if there be any virtue
[15:07] and if there be any praise think on
[15:10] these things
[15:11] those things which you have both learned
[15:16] and received
[15:18] and heard
[15:20] and seen in me
[15:22] do
[15:23] let me deadline again
[15:25] this is paul
[15:26] he said those things which you have both
[15:28] learned
[15:29] and received
[15:31] and heard
[15:32] and seen in me do
[15:35] and the god of peace shall be with you
[15:37] but i rejoice in the lord greatly
[15:41] that now at the last
[15:43] your care of me
[15:47] i flourish again wearing he also careful
[15:50] but you lack opportunity
[15:52] not that i speak in respect of want for
[15:54] i have learned
[15:56] listen
[15:57] i have
[15:58] learned
[15:59] in whatever state i am there to be
[16:02] content
[16:03] i know both how to be a beast
[16:07] and i know how to bond
[16:09] everywhere
[16:10] and in all things i am instructed both
[16:13] to be full
[16:15] and to be hungry
[16:16] go to a bone
[16:18] and to suffer need
[16:20] i can do all things through christ which
[16:22] strength let me may god bless his word i
[16:25] want to read this
[16:27] what we just read here
[16:28] part of it in the amplified
[16:31] and it says here rejoicing lord delight
[16:34] love your thoughts in hell
[16:35] again i say rejoice
[16:37] let all men know
[16:39] and perceive and recognize your
[16:41] unselfishness
[16:43] your considerateness
[16:45] your forbearing spirit the lord is near
[16:47] is coming soon
[16:49] do not fret or have anxiety
[16:52] about anything
[16:54] but in every circumstance
[16:56] and in everything by prayer and petition
[16:59] death the night requests with times
[17:02] given
[17:02] continue to make your wants known to god
[17:06] and god's peace shall be yours
[17:08] that tranquil state of a soul
[17:11] assured of its salvation to christ
[17:15] and so fearing nothing from god and
[17:17] being content with its early earthly lot
[17:20] of whatever sort that is that peace
[17:23] which transcends all understanding
[17:25] shall garrison and mount guard over your
[17:28] heart and mind
[17:30] in christ jesus
[17:32] for the rest brethren
[17:35] whatever is true
[17:37] whatever is worthy of reverence and is
[17:39] honorable and seemly whatever is just
[17:42] whatever is pure
[17:43] whatever is lovely and lovable whatever
[17:46] is kind and winsome and gracious if
[17:48] there is any virtue and excellence
[17:51] if there is anything worthy of praise
[17:53] think on
[17:55] and we and take a count of these things
[17:58] fix your minds on them
[18:00] practice what you have learned and
[18:02] receive and heard and seen in me and
[18:04] murder your way and living on it
[18:06] and the god of peace
[18:08] of untroubled and disturbed well-being
[18:10] will be with you
[18:12] i was made very happy in the lord that
[18:15] now you have revived your interest in my
[18:17] welfare after so long a time
[18:19] you were indeed thinking of me but you
[18:21] have no opportunity to show it
[18:24] not that i am implying that i was in any
[18:27] personal want
[18:28] for i have learned
[18:30] how to be content
[18:32] satisfied to the point where i am not
[18:34] disturbed
[18:35] or disquieted in whatever state i am in
[18:38] but this is important how he phrased
[18:41] this that i am
[18:43] satisfied to the point where
[18:45] i am not disturbed or disquieted
[18:49] in whatever state i am i am
[18:52] i know how to be a beast and live humbly
[18:55] in straightened circumstances i know how
[18:58] to enjoy plenty
[18:59] and live in abundance i have learned in
[19:02] all in any and all circumstance
[19:06] the secret of facing every situation
[19:09] whether well fed or going hungry have
[19:12] insufficiency
[19:14] and enough to spear or going without and
[19:18] being in want i have strength
[19:21] for all things in christ
[19:23] who empowers me
[19:26] i am ready for anything
[19:29] and equal
[19:30] to anything through him
[19:32] who infuses inner strength into me
[19:35] i am self
[19:36] sufficient in christ's
[19:38] sufficiency i want to re repeat that
[19:41] last line here in the amplified
[19:43] i am self
[19:45] sufficient
[19:46] in christ's
[19:48] sufficiency what a word
[19:51] what a word tonight and tonight
[19:54] i am hoping that
[19:56] uh
[19:58] we can be helped
[19:59] to get out of
[20:01] and there's a thing that struck me
[20:04] about
[20:06] passivity
[20:07] i hope i seen it right passivity and
[20:09] that that word passivity being passive
[20:11] passivity is acceptance of what happens
[20:15] without active response
[20:17] or resistance
[20:19] acceptance of what happens without
[20:22] active response
[20:24] or resistance and that come like if
[20:27] like russia was expecting to maybe reach
[20:30] the capital of ukraine teeth
[20:32] yes in um maybe three days a few days
[20:35] and it'll be over because they are big
[20:37] bad and everything else but the people
[20:39] didn't accept
[20:40] or was passive towards that they
[20:43] responded
[20:44] and
[20:46] the
[20:47] in chemistry it is called the state of
[20:49] inactivity
[20:51] and i hope that something we said
[20:53] tonight that will rose you
[20:55] out of that statistic in that state
[20:57] that you could be active
[21:00] to learn
[21:02] active to change i think sometimes i
[21:04] wonder sometimes if people
[21:06] resign themselves
[21:08] to the place where this is how i am
[21:12] you're hearing a word but
[21:13] this is how i am and
[21:16] you you have heard that we spoke some
[21:19] time about from talking about people
[21:20] hearing the same thing
[21:21] and different responses one of the
[21:23] toughest things for me
[21:25] in ministry to deal with
[21:27] where couples are concerned and you hear
[21:30] me say it and you hear like maybe over
[21:32] and over is when
[21:34] you find
[21:35] a husband and wife
[21:37] and none can't help the other
[21:40] it's one of them is one of the most
[21:42] stressful thing to encounter
[21:45] you can't
[21:47] tell
[21:48] either one
[21:49] much
[21:50] because none can't help
[21:52] the other
[21:54] you hear me say at times i do believe
[21:56] half and half should get married
[21:58] i believe somebody has this whole
[22:01] whole
[22:02] two whole people is who should come
[22:05] together not half not three quarter and
[22:07] a half or cortana a half
[22:10] you know like two valleys would make a
[22:12] mountain
[22:13] and
[22:14] a two people that don't have
[22:16] uh are not in the right minds faith and
[22:19] spirit
[22:20] it's it's rough and even though they
[22:22] love the lord and they go to church and
[22:24] they hear the word they'll be issues
[22:27] because of this inner self or in a man
[22:31] or
[22:32] or sometime we call it
[22:34] low self esteem low esteem
[22:37] and because of that
[22:38] the reaction is the different one of the
[22:41] thing of somebody with that high
[22:43] confidence or high self-esteem people
[22:45] use that word
[22:47] is the ability to admit wrong
[22:50] the ability to be honest the ability to
[22:52] be confident the ability
[22:55] to hear
[22:56] and um
[22:57] and feel comfortable in the custody of
[22:59] your skin
[23:00] you don't have to pretend you don't have
[23:02] to defend you don't have to make excuses
[23:05] you could be sincere because you are not
[23:08] insecure if i could use that word
[23:11] when somebody is insecure
[23:13] then their reaction is a bit different
[23:16] they
[23:17] may be controlling they may be
[23:20] um how should i say not temperamental
[23:23] but manipulative because of that
[23:26] insecurity uh they may be over
[23:28] you know trying to
[23:31] control people and controls lives
[23:33] because of that kind of insecurity and
[23:36] if you take that into ministry now
[23:38] somebody having that background or if
[23:40] you come beyond it pull but not you
[23:42] could see how they would run the church
[23:44] and run people's lives because they
[23:46] themselves have issues
[23:47] internal issues
[23:49] and these things must be dealt with
[23:52] and i read the scriptures tonight and
[23:54] you know what the overlying thought i
[23:56] had there was think think on these think
[23:58] on this think on this there's a thing on
[24:00] this
[24:01] because there are things
[24:03] that you know
[24:05] bibles talk about whatever is lovely
[24:06] whatever is a good report
[24:09] uh think on these things that things
[24:11] that we could share things that would
[24:12] help us things that would bless us and
[24:14] edify us
[24:16] that we could learn from it and paul
[24:19] paul was
[24:21] a learning person
[24:23] and in this age and time
[24:26] sometimes what you learn said 10 years
[24:28] ago is not on void now because knowledge
[24:30] is just flipping over things are
[24:32] changing and you have to be willing to
[24:34] adapt
[24:35] and it's sad when you see people that
[24:37] not willing to adapt will interchange
[24:39] willing to address
[24:40] and in this kind of life you have to be
[24:43] able to adjust you get your thinking
[24:45] adjust for your feeling and and and and
[24:49] the anchor point of that script to help
[24:51] that is the scripture where paul said i
[24:53] can do all things through christ
[24:55] strengthen me
[24:57] and that is our
[24:58] inside confidence
[25:00] that is not i go to church
[25:02] that is not dependent upon what others
[25:05] see
[25:06] that is something president in him that
[25:09] he could verbalize it
[25:11] and express it
[25:12] all things to confront the world
[25:16] i can do all things it doesn't matter i
[25:18] can cope
[25:20] i can deal with my issues
[25:22] like here's some time where i have a
[25:23] spiritualist you had to figure it out
[25:25] and you have to figure it out and
[25:28] sometimes if you don't have the
[25:29] knowledge
[25:30] if you don't have the understanding if
[25:31] you don't have the wisdom it is hard
[25:34] and that is why
[25:35] sometimes in this fellowship and this
[25:38] sharing you could benefit so much from
[25:40] it and learn so much from it if you are
[25:42] willing to learn you have to have a
[25:44] desire
[25:46] to learn and even though you might be 80
[25:48] 89 92 94 it doesn't matter what age you
[25:51] are there are always things
[25:54] to learn
[25:55] never adopt the attitude that there is
[25:57] nothing more that you know it that you
[25:59] have it because that's only
[26:02] you're hiding there listen to some
[26:04] things and i'm going to wrap up here
[26:05] because
[26:06] we have something else somebody are
[26:07] going to share something with you so
[26:09] let's go back
[26:13] he said some someone asked me some time
[26:15] ago shall i shall we seek gifts now for
[26:18] our ministries
[26:20] some messages brethren who had just
[26:21] received the holies i said no don't do
[26:23] that when you do that then god can't use
[26:25] you
[26:26] i said the only thing to do is just go
[26:28] ahead being a christian
[26:30] if god has called you he pleased you
[26:33] just exactly where you belong
[26:35] usually
[26:36] those who seek and try to get things
[26:39] if god would give them something
[26:41] they may more or less be a stuffed
[26:43] shield
[26:44] so right here
[26:46] you could see but i'm dealing with
[26:49] growth
[26:50] maturity
[26:51] dealing with the fact
[26:53] that asking for gifts asking for these
[26:56] things
[26:57] um
[26:58] and we not grow to that point of
[27:00] maturity
[27:01] we get puffed up
[27:03] we will get attitudes
[27:05] saving these brethren from that
[27:08] by sharing with him don't do that don't
[27:09] put it that way he said usually when
[27:13] that the man that god calls is the man
[27:15] that's trying to run from him if
[27:17] anything moses paul different ones
[27:19] trying to get away from the call we find
[27:21] here
[27:22] that god in spite of all failure that
[27:25] moses had done he still had his hand on
[27:27] him
[27:28] he called him to go do his service call
[27:31] him to his commission and what a
[27:33] consolation that must have been to
[27:34] joshua when he heard god said as i was
[27:36] with moses so i'll be with you
[27:40] although here we go
[27:42] if i am trying and i feel
[27:45] so
[27:46] some people don't like to try because
[27:48] they don't want to feel
[27:49] so instead of going and trying and
[27:51] flopping and falling
[27:53] now that's a that's that inside issue
[27:55] when they get out tonight
[27:57] i married on if i am trying and i feel
[28:00] god won't leave me
[28:03] i never have much confidence in anybody
[28:06] that's too afraid to do anything
[28:09] are you like that
[28:11] you're too afraid
[28:13] i would rather be from a failure
[28:16] than too lazy to try
[28:19] and this is where i want to motivate you
[28:21] tonight or inspire tonight to try
[28:25] don't
[28:27] be lazy
[28:29] and do nothing because
[28:30] you don't want to stumble you don't want
[28:32] to fall you don't know don't try
[28:34] one time it was said that the ballad and
[28:36] ballad flower company hired a man
[28:38] and he's going to sign his name and the
[28:40] man had no erase on the end of his
[28:42] pencil
[28:43] and mr barron said to him why haven't
[28:45] you got eraser he said i don't make
[28:46] mistakes
[28:48] he said then i can't use you because if
[28:49] you make mistakes you don't make
[28:51] mistakes you you won't do nothing that's
[28:53] true
[28:54] god
[28:56] don't
[28:57] hold you responsible for your mistakes
[28:59] he hold you responsible for your willful
[29:01] sin
[29:02] either since willfully after you've
[29:03] received the knowledge of the truth but
[29:05] a man here we go that's going to do
[29:07] something
[29:09] is
[29:10] going to blunder
[29:13] don't
[29:14] be afraid to blunder
[29:16] because you're gonna do something
[29:18] you see a man that is gonna do something
[29:22] is gonna blunder
[29:23] okay
[29:24] things may go
[29:26] salt as you see
[29:27] all right
[29:28] here we go
[29:30] he says now he's going to fall
[29:32] he's going to make mistakes
[29:34] but if he's really divinely cold
[29:38] and god is in his heart he'll rise again
[29:40] he used to be coming to the church here
[29:42] years ago and they may be here this
[29:44] morning a little man and his wife used
[29:45] to sing a song that truly you go
[29:47] something like this forgive me lord
[29:49] and try me one more time
[29:51] i'll be yours
[29:53] if you will be mine
[29:54] if i fall
[29:56] or if i fail
[29:58] let me rise and try again
[30:00] forgive me lord
[30:02] and try me
[30:03] one more time
[30:05] you say i like that
[30:06] for any good soldier is up to get
[30:08] wounded or hurt
[30:10] but if he is still a soldier
[30:12] and got a purpose and sometimes a fight
[30:13] for
[30:14] he will rise and try again and any good
[30:16] soul of the cross
[30:18] will do the same thing
[30:20] okay let's continue but i was preaching
[30:22] this message about perseverance and he
[30:24] said i got a thought i got a thinking of
[30:26] virus listen to this what he said
[30:29] yes
[30:30] many men is perseverant
[30:33] watch this now
[30:35] before
[30:36] you can be persevered
[30:39] before before you can be persevered you
[30:42] have to have faith in what you are
[30:45] trying to achieve
[30:47] now
[30:48] that
[30:49] fate he's talking about here this stuff
[30:52] is internal
[30:54] you have got to first have faith
[30:57] before you can be persevered
[31:00] so faith
[31:01] and perseverance
[31:03] works hand in hand together they are
[31:06] brothers
[31:07] you must believe
[31:09] or you'll have no confidence
[31:12] you won't know whether you are right or
[31:14] wrong
[31:15] but when you have reached that place
[31:18] that you are fit and what you are trying
[31:20] to do
[31:21] then
[31:22] you can be procedural
[31:24] so you know now um
[31:26] i assure you see that kind of talk that
[31:29] can't get you very far too you have to
[31:32] know what do you know
[31:34] what do you have confidence in
[31:37] okay the word
[31:39] the confidence that god has called you
[31:41] if god has called you he can keep you
[31:44] if god has called you he can lead you if
[31:47] god has called you he can speak to you
[31:50] he was talking about what i was thinking
[31:52] the beginning of the history of our
[31:53] nation
[31:57] it behaves information when a handful of
[31:59] soul is in the cold winter day and the
[32:01] odds all against them
[32:03] there was american soldiers when i read
[32:05] the history of our nation it makes me
[32:06] cry in my heart their leader was a
[32:08] christian the delaware was frozen over
[32:11] ice gorges in it i understand about half
[32:14] of the american soldiers did even have
[32:15] shoes on their feet
[32:16] with stuff wrapped around their feet
[32:18] them was american soldiers the obstacle
[32:21] was great the odds was against him and
[32:23] yet
[32:24] after all night prayer until he was wet
[32:27] up to his hips and snow where he was
[32:29] knelt in prayer the great leader became
[32:34] perseverant
[32:35] for he had assurance of god that he
[32:38] could cross that delaware anyhow
[32:40] he was perseverant although three bullet
[32:43] hole was placed to his clothes he had
[32:45] heard from god and no matter what the
[32:47] odds was he was he could be persevered
[32:50] because
[32:51] he heard from god and believed that the
[32:53] god that was leading him to victory for
[32:55] this great nation was with him
[32:57] so therefore
[32:59] the delaware froze over meant nothing to
[33:01] him
[33:02] no matter how much ice there was or what
[33:06] the obstacle was still he could be
[33:09] current because he felt he had god on
[33:12] his side how great that is when we can
[33:14] hear from god and be rest assured that
[33:18] we are right in this fellowship there is
[33:20] nothing to greed there is nothing great
[33:22] enough that can stop that person men
[33:25] that ever amounted to anything at any
[33:27] time
[33:28] through any age has been men who believe
[33:30] in god had faith in god and stood
[33:33] against the enemy on every side and was
[33:36] perseverant
[33:37] they believed in god
[33:39] i believe every christian therefore
[33:41] should be
[33:42] very perseverant
[33:44] oh my
[33:46] then we went on he said now watch
[33:49] i cannot have confidence in myself
[33:52] i cannot have confidence in yourself
[33:55] together
[33:56] we can have confidence
[33:58] in what has taken over ourselves
[34:01] the holy spirit has taken us over
[34:04] we must
[34:05] have confidence in that
[34:08] and as we place our confidence in that
[34:10] then the results come
[34:12] so you see what paul says
[34:14] paul said it
[34:15] and that's what we read
[34:17] praise the name of the lord
[34:19] blessed be the name of paul talk about
[34:21] the sufficiencies in god
[34:23] he is confident
[34:25] in the sufficiency of god isn't that
[34:26] right and then i think we read this here
[34:29] that in is the go and that but that is
[34:31] the god the creator living in you and
[34:33] given you all the powers then you are in
[34:35] possession of anything that he had so it
[34:37] is in you to abstain from evil
[34:41] to do good to shun evil to flee to
[34:44] righteousness to turn away from
[34:45] temptation all malice hatred strikes
[34:48] envy and so forth turn away from it for
[34:50] that will take him from your heart
[34:53] if you will receive him
[34:55] and embrace him and love him and hold
[34:58] him in your heart and love him i tell
[34:59] you the church together and that kind of
[35:02] power has the power to find the heaven
[35:04] heal the sick open the eyes of the blind
[35:06] the death speak the dumb speak the death
[35:09] here the cripples will see why it's
[35:11] recognizing the power of almighty god
[35:13] in your heart he is dear
[35:16] deity
[35:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord he
[35:19] said but that we know that there's going
[35:20] to be a bride almost done what i'm going
[35:22] to share
[35:23] and there's going to be a wedding supper
[35:25] served in the sky
[35:28] that's just as to be as god is because
[35:30] it's his word
[35:32] and we know
[35:33] that those that are going to make up
[35:35] that bride
[35:36] is going to be his church
[35:38] they are going to appear before him
[35:40] without spot or wrinkle
[35:42] and they have here we go are you ready
[35:45] they have the material
[35:48] on it now
[35:50] to make themselves ready let me read
[35:53] that again
[35:54] they have
[35:56] the material
[35:58] on it now to make themselves ready
[36:02] if you notice it says she
[36:05] has made herself ready
[36:07] look what he says next
[36:09] so many says
[36:11] if the lord will take this evil spirit
[36:14] from me
[36:15] from drinking
[36:17] or from gambling
[36:18] or from lying or stealing
[36:21] i'll serve him
[36:24] but that's up to you
[36:26] you have got something
[36:29] you have got to do something too
[36:31] dearly overcome shall inherit all things
[36:34] they will overcome you have power to do
[36:36] it
[36:37] but you must be willing to lay it down
[36:39] see
[36:40] she has made her suffering
[36:42] you are something to do what
[36:44] you are something
[36:46] to do
[36:47] and this is my point the point tonight
[36:49] is the word come for us to apply
[36:53] and this
[36:54] self-worth
[36:56] self-esteem
[36:57] how you deal with you
[36:59] how you see your inner self
[37:01] has more to do with you than you think
[37:04] and one writer put it as the confidence
[37:06] in our ability to think
[37:08] and to cope with the challenges of life
[37:11] the confidence of our right to be
[37:13] successful and to be happy
[37:15] i remember
[37:17] as we would know the older ones will
[37:19] know
[37:20] years ago like poverty is christianity
[37:23] like the poor you are you more spiritual
[37:24] you are because you come for the poor
[37:26] you preach the gospel to the poor and
[37:27] you know all kind of benefits of
[37:29] coco stuff
[37:31] but the truth is
[37:33] god gave us life and this to live in is
[37:35] not to be miserable not to exist not to
[37:37] be harassed and terrorized
[37:39] he said i come to my life
[37:42] and have it more abundantly
[37:44] so therefore god wants us to have
[37:46] confidence that he will like he said
[37:48] i'll never leave you enough for sick you
[37:49] want us to have confidence according
[37:50] that says
[37:52] i mean i was young not all i've never
[37:54] seen the righteous for sleeping and
[37:55] seeing big bread look at equilibrium 3
[37:57] 22 says wherefore i perceive
[38:00] that there is nothing better
[38:02] than a man should rejoice in his own
[38:04] works
[38:05] for that is his portion
[38:08] for who shall bring him to see what
[38:10] shall be after
[38:11] declarations 5 18 to 20 says behold that
[38:15] which i have seen
[38:16] it is good and comedy for one to eat and
[38:18] drink and to enjoy the good of all his
[38:21] labor that he taketh until his friend
[38:23] all the days of his life which god had
[38:24] given him for it is his portion
[38:28] every man also to whom god had given
[38:30] riches and words and had given him power
[38:33] to eat thereof and to take his portion
[38:36] and to rejoice in his labor this is the
[38:38] gift of god
[38:39] for he shall not much remember the days
[38:41] of his life because god answered him in
[38:44] the joy
[38:45] of his heart
[38:47] so
[38:50] to face life
[38:53] with
[38:54] low confidence low esteem christians are
[38:57] going to church
[38:58] and
[38:59] you know
[39:00] uh
[39:02] and we and i we got my very young age 21
[39:05] and
[39:06] you know as god show meetings of her and
[39:09] by oneself we worked on it
[39:11] and i was amazed to see the confidence
[39:14] that she growed into
[39:15] in life
[39:17] and to testify to people and testify to
[39:20] fools and so on like that
[39:22] and whether she go in the clothes show
[39:25] or buy a piece of clothes or wherever
[39:27] she goes she's always
[39:29] seeking that opportunity to share
[39:31] something about the lord jesus
[39:33] that somebody could know about christ
[39:35] and come to the gospel and so
[39:37] and it's really something that i admire
[39:39] of her over the years as a soul winner
[39:43] and i know
[39:44] that
[39:45] lacking that
[39:46] oh i should i say she wasn't always like
[39:49] that she grew into that
[39:51] and i know that there are things that we
[39:53] are not in right now but we could grow
[39:55] into it
[39:56] and all the doubt about you know
[40:00] you're feeling now how to to be blessed
[40:02] and to be and to be successful and and
[40:05] all this is what god
[40:07] wants of us i i i want you to be
[40:10] obviously prosperous your soul prospers
[40:12] he wants us to be healthy he wants us to
[40:14] be blessed he wants to be happy to be
[40:17] joyful the first part of the scripture
[40:19] he said rejoice always rejoice in the
[40:21] lord god bless you give your life
[40:24] you're not a crook you're not a bandit
[40:25] you're not robbing people you're you're
[40:27] you're you're supposed to be enjoying
[40:29] the lord this is what god wants of us
[40:32] and in on that blessing that we can live
[40:35] better and we could respond to
[40:37] challenges in an effective manner that
[40:39] the world and people outside of
[40:40] christianity could admire how we deal
[40:43] with this thing you know so i believe
[40:46] that one of the things that shows up the
[40:48] confidence the assurance of somebody's
[40:50] heart is your willingness
[40:52] to admit mistakes have encountered
[40:54] christians well they call
[40:56] self-christians who they care
[40:59] accuse them of anything not me not me
[41:01] always not them everybody else
[41:04] and that's why they don't change because
[41:05] they never they can't come to the point
[41:07] admit that they're wrong they're
[41:09] defensive they can't be sincere they
[41:11] slide on their hands in church but this
[41:14] is
[41:15] something on the inside
[41:17] so to me
[41:18] the higher
[41:20] that inner part of you
[41:22] half with god is the more open you can
[41:25] be the more sincere you can be the more
[41:28] you could communicate effectively and
[41:31] clearly and to me this is what god wants
[41:34] you at home with people to the poor you
[41:36] become important and rich you become
[41:37] rich you know you have to become all
[41:39] things to all men that by all means you
[41:40] can
[41:41] save some
[41:43] so
[41:44] uh
[41:47] we have to begin to live
[41:49] a life that
[41:51] is
[41:52] how should i say it
[41:54] are comfortable
[41:56] measurable like we could measure our
[41:58] lives
[42:00] and
[42:01] you know if oh okay so i'll say this
[42:03] sweden i'm gonna close
[42:05] and
[42:06] we're gonna have something else coming
[42:07] to you
[42:10] if
[42:11] you know
[42:13] you are not doing the right thing
[42:17] this is you knowing that
[42:19] nobody else this is you have
[42:21] personal issues
[42:25] regardless of how people love you
[42:27] value you
[42:29] respect you
[42:31] you have issues loving your own self
[42:34] respecting yourself
[42:36] because of what you're doing
[42:39] because of your internal issues
[42:42] now when paul said
[42:44] what you heard
[42:46] what you see in me do
[42:49] it means
[42:50] that paul was
[42:52] consciously
[42:55] aligning himself with the word and with
[42:57] god
[42:58] not just in
[43:00] talk
[43:01] but in life
[43:03] so he was talking
[43:06] from a position
[43:08] of
[43:09] internal confidence
[43:12] because he was lining up conscious
[43:15] subconscious word
[43:18] values
[43:20] so if
[43:21] let's say for instance
[43:23] we not we don't believe in smoking let's
[43:25] say you find yourself puffing something
[43:27] in the corner okay
[43:28] you know you're not supposed to be doing
[43:30] that
[43:31] so right away you don't have the
[43:33] confidence
[43:35] in yourself to have faith
[43:37] to deal with certain things because
[43:39] you know nobody else knows you're
[43:42] puffing something up this way
[43:44] until you deal with that and things line
[43:46] up
[43:48] there'll be a great struggle
[43:50] and i trust you lord this is just like a
[43:52] taste uh i'm looking to see if god could
[43:55] help us
[43:56] drill down
[43:58] into some of the internal stuff that we
[44:00] could get the help that we need
[44:02] because some people
[44:04] accept themselves dear
[44:06] and they live in that level of passivity
[44:09] in which it's almost like if well you
[44:10] know
[44:11] the enemy coming
[44:13] what could do is strong be powerful but
[44:16] paul said i can do what
[44:17] all things
[44:19] through christ
[44:21] constructed me
[44:23] i'm gonna close with that tonight
[44:25] tonight we're gonna have
[44:27] a special
[44:28] uh something to share with you tonight
[44:30] from brother gideon my son gideon
[44:33] and um he came by me
[44:36] my
[44:37] home home sometime it was last week
[44:40] and he's just talking casually
[44:43] and talking about a client that he met
[44:45] and we're gonna talk
[44:46] and they begin to share
[44:48] some of the things that he was
[44:49] testifying to him
[44:51] about the lord and the man said i tell
[44:52] him oh god he's trying to bring
[44:53] conviction to me and different things
[44:55] but i would just listen to him and i was
[44:56] amazed at
[44:58] how he took that time off to share and
[45:00] witness
[45:02] of the lord to this to this guy
[45:04] and after he left
[45:06] i got this thought why not you know to
[45:08] ask him to share something whatever
[45:11] and that is how this comes out tonight
[45:13] so at this time i want to invite the
[45:15] gideon
[45:16] and he is going to share a few thoughts
[45:18] with you tonight
[45:19] but again
[45:20] uh feel free to come on now
[45:23] write the breakthrough
[45:35] good evening good evening since
[45:38] i i'm not sure where to start what i
[45:42] want to say though i feel like i am
[45:44] about to run the second leg
[45:46] of a two or two man race
[45:48] i pray that as i share my little my
[45:52] little part that it will truly be a
[45:55] blessing to somebody and somebody will
[45:56] be it's a benefit
[45:58] and i believe that
[46:00] um
[46:01] what i'm about to share would be
[46:04] meaningful and insights inside subtitle
[46:06] and truly inspirational before i start
[46:09] however i just want us to bar heads and
[46:11] pray pray for me and pray for what is
[46:13] about to be said
[46:15] oh lord we thank you for this
[46:16] opportunity lord lord we thank you for
[46:18] this this time these moments that we've
[46:20] posed i pray that
[46:22] you would take my few broken up words
[46:24] lord laws it'd be thoughts
[46:26] that i would try to express and
[46:29] articulate as best as i know how i pray
[46:31] that you'll anoint my lips lord anoint
[46:34] my thoughts as i speak lord that you
[46:36] could really minister to the hearts of
[46:38] the people gathered here tonight and
[46:39] those who will be blessed and see it
[46:41] even afterwards lord i pray that we be
[46:43] careful to give you all the praise honor
[46:45] and glory in jesus name we pray amen
[46:49] so
[46:50] i just want to say thanks for the
[46:51] opportunity
[46:53] to be able to share in this way
[46:56] and
[46:58] with that said i know there was a
[47:00] background that's been laid
[47:03] and it was simply you know within the
[47:05] context of business at times they they
[47:08] have have told us or taught us
[47:11] and
[47:12] some of the things they would say is
[47:14] you don't talk about religion you don't
[47:17] talk about politics there are things to
[47:19] stay away from when doing business
[47:22] and
[47:23] i met a a i can't say a young man this
[47:26] was a mature guy
[47:28] and he said you know in his experience
[47:29] he's been up and down he has
[47:32] seen the best he's seen the worst and i
[47:34] happen to have met him
[47:37] at one of his his lower ends
[47:40] and with that said he said you know
[47:42] he was in church and
[47:45] he probably goes to church when he can
[47:47] off and on but he was struggling he
[47:50] expressed you know his life was in a
[47:51] mess his finances were in a mess
[47:53] in his words everything was falling
[47:56] apart
[47:58] and
[47:59] it was at that time
[48:01] i decided to go against the principles i
[48:04] was taught in business
[48:06] and i asked him the question i say
[48:09] where's god in all this
[48:11] and he looked at me
[48:13] he said wait
[48:16] you come to convict me this hour
[48:19] i know telling you how bad things are
[48:22] how terrible things are my family fall
[48:25] apart
[48:26] this guy when i say fall apart he is
[48:28] about to embark upon his third divorce
[48:32] all right
[48:34] his house is about to disappear
[48:37] right so it's real bad and here it is
[48:41] and i'm asking him where's god in all
[48:43] this you tell me i have a background in
[48:45] church and stuff
[48:46] and it was interesting
[48:50] my response i i couldn't have predicted
[48:52] it or planned it but my response to him
[48:54] was you know i'm not here to convict you
[48:57] i'm not here to condemn you i'm not here
[48:58] to chastise you
[49:00] as a matter of fact i say you know you
[49:02] remind me of of of some characters i
[49:04] would have read about jenny biker
[49:07] and look you see you're gonna preach to
[49:09] me tonight i say no i'm not a preacher
[49:12] i say we're just having a discussion we
[49:14] just have enough conversation and there
[49:16] it is i thought you know what i was
[49:18] about to present to him although it was
[49:20] unplanned
[49:21] it may have been for him at that time a
[49:24] mirror
[49:25] to reflect on for him to see where he
[49:27] was at for him to see himself and
[49:31] one of the first things i shared with
[49:32] him
[49:34] was
[49:35] the story of the rich young ruler as
[49:38] told in the bible
[49:40] but just before
[49:42] i and i'm watching my time i i don't i
[49:44] don't intend to be too long i just want
[49:47] to share a little context
[49:49] from the prophet's message
[49:52] and
[49:54] i want to just read something very very
[49:57] brief
[49:59] you know
[50:00] and in the message identification
[50:06] chapter
[50:07] 38 he said this little lad
[50:10] must have been raised in such a home
[50:13] and when he came down to visit his
[50:14] grandmother
[50:16] she had uh
[50:18] a door
[50:20] that let me just expand it a little bit
[50:24] yeah
[50:26] a door that's on the back side of it was
[50:28] a mirror
[50:30] and the little lad was kind of lonesome
[50:32] and he was looking all around the house
[50:34] and after a bit he happened to look
[50:35] through the door and it had been closed
[50:37] since they they come in
[50:39] and in the mirror on his side he saw a
[50:42] little boy
[50:46] and he started to the little boy to make
[50:48] friends with him and as he began to look
[50:50] into this glass he got up close and he
[50:52] turned around he said why mama
[50:55] that's me
[50:56] and that's what we want to look at
[50:58] tonight i want to look at me i want to
[51:00] look at yourself
[51:02] and as we look into god's great mirror
[51:04] of his word
[51:05] let's our be able to identify ourselves
[51:08] with some that we're going to speak
[51:09] about some of the characters of other
[51:11] times and i want to see myself in god's
[51:14] looking glass
[51:15] because if anything will show you where
[51:17] you're standing it's this book
[51:19] there's no book like it
[51:21] it's cause it's all the truth
[51:23] i don't say that other books are not
[51:26] true but i know this one is true it's
[51:29] all truth
[51:30] because it's the word of god
[51:32] now jesus gave us the example of what we
[51:35] ought to be looking at
[51:37] when he reflected his life to us through
[51:39] the word
[51:40] what we should see
[51:42] when we look into god's mirror we should
[51:45] see ourselves
[51:46] identified with him
[51:48] that's the perfect example
[51:52] you know and
[51:53] it had me even going to see
[51:56] what a mirror was
[51:57] what what exactly is a mirror i know we
[51:59] could probably all relate to a mirror
[52:01] but really by definition a mirror is a
[52:04] surface typically of glass coated with a
[52:07] metal amalgam
[52:09] which reflects a clear image and i want
[52:11] you to hold that thought that the image
[52:14] coming out of the mirror must be clear
[52:16] for us to really see ourselves
[52:18] right
[52:20] and
[52:22] as i shared with him he said you know i
[52:25] could understand and i said you know the
[52:27] rich young ruler came to christ
[52:29] not because he was a bad guy not because
[52:32] he was doing a lot of wrong things
[52:35] i say i don't even think you are a bad
[52:37] guy things may seem bad with you no
[52:39] but
[52:41] really
[52:42] i i do think you're set out to be a bad
[52:45] guy
[52:46] but let's just examine that story a
[52:49] little bit
[52:50] and see what we could learn i mean this
[52:52] is by no means a bible study or anything
[52:54] but i want to share this
[52:58] so we could perhaps all benefit
[53:04] in this way
[53:17] so
[53:18] as we see here in machine 19
[53:22] i hope we could all see it
[53:25] i'll try to expand it a little bit in
[53:28] matthew chapter 19 verse 16 to 22
[53:32] you know it says and behold one came and
[53:34] said unto him good master what good
[53:36] thing shall i do that i may have eternal
[53:38] life that's a question he posed to jesus
[53:41] and he answered unto him why call us
[53:44] down me good there is none good but one
[53:46] that is god
[53:49] but if thou wilt enter into life keep
[53:52] the commandments he said unto him which
[53:55] jesus said thou shalt do new murder thou
[53:58] shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not
[54:00] steal thou shalt not be a false witness
[54:02] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[54:05] shall love thy neighbor as i self
[54:07] the young man said unto him
[54:09] all these things i have kept from my
[54:12] youth up what luck i yet jesus said unto
[54:14] him if thou wilt be perfect
[54:18] go and sell that thou hast and give to
[54:20] the poor
[54:21] and thou shalt have treasures in heaven
[54:23] and come and follow me but when the
[54:26] young man heard that saying he went away
[54:28] sorrowful
[54:29] for he had great possessions
[54:32] and therein lies the challenge
[54:35] to this man i spoke to it seemed that
[54:38] everything was bleak and dismal and dumb
[54:40] and i presented this story to him and
[54:42] said you know what there was a man kinda
[54:44] like you
[54:47] he was okay
[54:48] he did all the right things and he
[54:50] couldn't really explain what he was
[54:52] missing
[54:54] and
[54:55] i mean i have the time to really explore
[54:56] the fullness of the story there because
[54:58] jesus just handed him a card and said
[55:01] listen why you call me good
[55:04] do you realize that the only good one is
[55:06] god
[55:08] and went on as if to ignore that and
[55:11] answer this question directly he said
[55:13] but i know what you really came here you
[55:15] came to understand what more i have to
[55:17] do and this is what i posed to the
[55:20] gentleman at the time
[55:22] that it may seem as if you're in a
[55:24] scenario
[55:26] and looking for answers
[55:28] but really the answer is not from me or
[55:31] you or friends or family and loved ones
[55:34] but if you look in the word if you use
[55:37] the mirror of the word sometimes the
[55:39] answers are very very clear
[55:41] so
[55:43] the young man
[55:44] in this context he said you know i obey
[55:47] the commandments
[55:49] i follow the law i'm pretty sure with
[55:51] the confidence he had to speak to jesus
[55:53] directly like that as a rich young ruler
[55:56] it meant his parents perhaps were
[55:58] business persons
[56:00] he probably had great mentors and went
[56:02] to the finest schools
[56:04] he had no issue communicating and being
[56:06] articulate and being able to express the
[56:08] things he wanted
[56:10] however
[56:11] he had a very sincere and genuine
[56:13] question which was
[56:15] as a matter of fact i see you with these
[56:17] disciples here but what's wrong with me
[56:19] how could i earn this eternal life that
[56:21] you preach about and speak about and
[56:23] people follow you are wrong to find out
[56:25] about
[56:26] and jesus almost brushed him off and say
[56:29] you know what
[56:30] do the basics
[56:33] and he said
[56:34] i have done this all my life
[56:37] i went to sunday school bible school
[56:39] every school i could do academic school
[56:41] business school and i'm a success and
[56:43] i'm here seeking
[56:46] the wisdom that you have to offer
[56:48] but what jesus told him afterwards so
[56:51] after he passed that test what jesus
[56:53] told him seemed a little too tough for
[56:55] him to manage
[56:57] so the bible said he went away with
[57:00] sorrow he was sad he was aggrieved
[57:02] because jesus said sell all you have and
[57:05] just a few moments ago we heard
[57:07] jesus objective
[57:09] wasn't to make him poor you know
[57:12] god's desire wasn't for him to be living
[57:15] in poverty
[57:16] wasn't for him to be a beggar or
[57:18] destitute or anything but god knew
[57:21] despite what he looked like on the
[57:23] outside there was something on the
[57:24] inside to be fixed that man couldn't
[57:27] help him with
[57:29] that it wasn't an academic exercise and
[57:32] and go and say to our father and to
[57:34] hillary mary in that sense there were
[57:36] things that he had to deal with that
[57:38] nobody else could see or nobody else
[57:40] knew
[57:41] and as a result if he would just grab a
[57:44] hold of faith and go forth
[57:47] it would have been read differently
[57:48] today
[57:51] i want to switch back to the
[57:52] conversation i had with my my client
[57:56] and i went on you know you say over boy
[58:00] you you're a guy you know
[58:02] you always want to to tell me something
[58:04] you always want to advise me you always
[58:06] want to guide me and i said listen hear
[58:08] what hear what you do have to take that
[58:10] one
[58:11] i could share that but i'm not saying
[58:13] you have to apply that one
[58:15] i say what i want to share with you is
[58:18] something a little different
[58:20] so with that in mind once again
[58:22] unprepared
[58:24] i said listen
[58:26] i'm sure you know it it's a familiar
[58:28] script scripture that of the prodigal
[58:31] son
[58:32] i say you know it two brothers one
[58:34] decide he felt enough he go and do his
[58:37] thing and i said it kind of reminds me
[58:39] of you that's why i'm talking to you
[58:41] about these things i say because you
[58:42] were on top of the mountain no this is a
[58:45] former businessman
[58:47] he knows what money looks like he was a
[58:50] multi-millionaire an ex doctor board now
[58:53] right
[58:54] and
[58:56] i could probably just just pull it
[58:58] quickly
[59:01] when
[59:02] when he is faced with reality
[59:06] of pretty present tense
[59:09] he was forced
[59:11] to realize
[59:16] that he looked just like this guy
[59:20] he said in luke chapter 15
[59:23] just part of it verse 11 to 12 24 it
[59:25] says
[59:26] and he said a certain man had two sons
[59:28] the familiar scripture would have to
[59:29] find financial tall and the younger of
[59:31] them said to his father father
[59:34] give me the portion of goods that follow
[59:36] to me
[59:37] in other in other words i want my
[59:40] inheritance whatever your plan to give
[59:42] me
[59:43] give me no
[59:44] he divided onto them his his living and
[59:48] not many days after the younger son
[59:50] gathered all together took his journey
[59:52] into a far country and there wasted his
[59:54] substance with rare trust living
[59:57] and when he had spent all their rules a
[59:59] mighty famine in that land and he began
[1:00:02] to be in want
[1:00:04] and he went and joined himself the
[1:00:05] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:00:08] onto his fields to feed swine
[1:00:10] and he would feign fill his belly with
[1:00:13] the husts
[1:00:14] that this fine did it and no man gave
[1:00:16] unto him and when he came to himself i
[1:00:18] want you to look look at this
[1:00:20] because this is the point at which he
[1:00:22] starts to reflect on the mirror he
[1:00:25] starts to look
[1:00:26] to see a picture that he's not a custom
[1:00:28] seeing because of the position in which
[1:00:30] he's in so he says
[1:00:33] when he came to himself he said
[1:00:35] how many hired servants of my fathers
[1:00:38] have bred enough and despair meaning how
[1:00:42] many servants my father back home have
[1:00:45] that are well paid and paid sufficient
[1:00:48] to have to give away because they have
[1:00:50] enough to spare and he said but look at
[1:00:52] me
[1:00:53] i perish with hunger
[1:00:56] and i will arise and go to my father and
[1:00:59] will say unto him
[1:01:00] father i have sinned against heaven and
[1:01:02] before him
[1:01:04] and i am no longer worthy
[1:01:07] to be called thy son make me as one of
[1:01:11] thy hired servants
[1:01:14] and he arose and he came to his father
[1:01:17] but when he was yet a great way off his
[1:01:21] father saw him and had compassion and
[1:01:23] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
[1:01:25] and the son said unto him father i have
[1:01:27] sinned against heaven and in my sight i
[1:01:30] am no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:01:32] but the father
[1:01:34] said unto his sevens bring forth the
[1:01:36] best robe put it on him put a ring on
[1:01:39] his hand shoes on his feet and bring
[1:01:40] hither the fatted calf and kill it let
[1:01:43] us eat and be merry for this is my this
[1:01:45] my son was dead and is alive again he
[1:01:47] was lost on his found and they began to
[1:01:50] be married now i read that scripture
[1:01:53] if just to show what might have been
[1:01:56] possible had the rich young ruler been
[1:01:59] obedient to what he was faced with in
[1:02:02] the face of the mirror of the word
[1:02:05] when jesus spoke unto him and said sell
[1:02:08] all you have give to the poor and the
[1:02:10] instruction was and come follow me
[1:02:14] i could only think for a second
[1:02:17] the the the lepers that came to christ
[1:02:20] seeking healing
[1:02:22] and jesus said you know what go show
[1:02:25] yourself to the priests
[1:02:27] in other words i give you an instruction
[1:02:29] i want you to be obedient and follow it
[1:02:32] follow it through he knew
[1:02:36] what the outcome was going to be he
[1:02:38] knows the end before the beginning he
[1:02:40] knows the end of the story before it
[1:02:42] start yet
[1:02:43] he wanted to see obedience to the word
[1:02:46] of god he was the mirror in in in the
[1:02:49] flesh he was the manifestation of the
[1:02:51] word on earth
[1:02:53] and
[1:02:54] it goes to show
[1:02:56] in looking at the prodigal son
[1:02:58] once
[1:02:59] you could reflect and see clearly where
[1:03:03] you are as brother over just shared
[1:03:06] and you see your mistakes and you repent
[1:03:08] and you turn around and you correct it
[1:03:10] and you fix it and you're willing to go
[1:03:12] back
[1:03:13] to that place that you left christ
[1:03:17] you could see the rewards that were
[1:03:19] waiting for him he killed the fatted
[1:03:21] calf he put a ring on his finger he
[1:03:24] decided to gather the flocks to get a
[1:03:26] guarded house together to be mary in
[1:03:28] other words let's have a celebratory
[1:03:31] party let's have a rejoicing time
[1:03:34] because this is somebody doing the right
[1:03:36] thing
[1:03:37] and i know it might be going through
[1:03:38] your mind
[1:03:40] you know on one hand we had somebody who
[1:03:42] was seemingly okay
[1:03:44] had all the ducks lined up
[1:03:47] and on this hand you had you might say
[1:03:49] this is a backslidden person
[1:03:51] this is somebody who knew the right
[1:03:53] thing and he moved away he walked away
[1:03:55] and yeah
[1:03:57] but you know there are other types too
[1:03:59] and i didn't want to leave it alone
[1:04:02] so as we spoke he say yes boy over your
[1:04:05] right you're right you're right you know
[1:04:06] you know this bible thing and i say
[1:04:09] listen it's not for me to know the bible
[1:04:11] thing
[1:04:12] these are just words i could share words
[1:04:15] with you
[1:04:16] but it really takes you
[1:04:19] to go into action
[1:04:20] it really takes a decision it really
[1:04:23] takes a choice
[1:04:24] so i could share and brother branham
[1:04:26] preached he said listen he could preach
[1:04:28] until his hair
[1:04:30] could fall off yeah here i could turn
[1:04:32] brilliant he had to tell whiter he had
[1:04:34] to turn great you could use all the
[1:04:35] scriptures all the quotes you could
[1:04:37] preach until you have no more words to
[1:04:39] say
[1:04:40] at the end of the day
[1:04:42] it's by the grace of god you're saved
[1:04:44] and it's by the grace of god you're
[1:04:46] allowed to get that opportunity to make
[1:04:48] that choice to make that turn to make
[1:04:49] that change to make the decision to do
[1:04:52] differently than you were doing before
[1:04:55] with that said you know
[1:04:56] i reflected again because the thoughts
[1:04:59] continue to come
[1:05:00] and i say i know he begged me don't
[1:05:03] preach to me tonight don't convict me
[1:05:05] tonight don't take me to church
[1:05:07] but there was something welling up
[1:05:09] inside me and i told myself listen if i
[1:05:12] lose this business here i'll lose it but
[1:05:14] i just have to tell you tonight i have
[1:05:17] to tell you this before i go
[1:05:19] and
[1:05:20] i thought for a second i say you know
[1:05:23] you're right you know
[1:05:25] it's not necessarily by your works it's
[1:05:27] not what you do or what you don't do
[1:05:29] it's not if you're right or if you're
[1:05:30] wrong i say i can't judge you i can't
[1:05:32] condemn you right i can cause you to to
[1:05:36] be convicted you may feel convicted but
[1:05:39] i can't do that to you i say you ever
[1:05:42] wondered
[1:05:43] why you're going through what you're
[1:05:44] going through now
[1:05:46] i say because the first question i ask
[1:05:48] is where is god in all this
[1:05:50] where is god
[1:05:52] and he say you know i never thought how
[1:05:54] i ended up here
[1:05:56] i said because i need to tell you
[1:05:58] another story
[1:05:59] i say there was a man i said i know you
[1:06:02] know him
[1:06:02] i said there was a man whose name was
[1:06:04] job
[1:06:05] and in his time i said you know he
[1:06:08] wasn't doing anything wrong
[1:06:10] he wasn't doing anything super right in
[1:06:11] that sense
[1:06:13] i say but
[1:06:14] hear what happened to him
[1:06:16] he was living
[1:06:17] such a righteous life
[1:06:19] such a life pleasing to god
[1:06:22] that god built listen to what god built
[1:06:25] god built a wall
[1:06:27] in our time we call that a pyramid
[1:06:29] offense right
[1:06:30] i think not necessarily every home but
[1:06:33] the average home has what we call a
[1:06:34] perimeter fence it helps you to feel
[1:06:37] secure so in your home your home may
[1:06:38] have walls
[1:06:40] and then you may have an outside fence
[1:06:42] whether the fans have a gate or not
[1:06:44] that's an outside fence but guess what
[1:06:46] god went one step further and i'll read
[1:06:49] it for you in a second
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:52] the devil actually said but satan said
[1:06:54] listen
[1:06:54] you have a hedge even around that fence
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] so you say this is not a fence that you
[1:07:02] could unlatch a gate and walk in no
[1:07:04] you have a hedge and and you know what
[1:07:07] i always believe
[1:07:09] the the the scripture says it way better
[1:07:12] than i can
[1:07:13] i stutter when i speak at times i may
[1:07:15] mix up things but his word
[1:07:18] never fails
[1:07:19] his word is always the truth
[1:07:22] so
[1:07:23] let me
[1:07:25] read it for you
[1:07:29] from job chapter 1
[1:07:31] very familiar scripture here and just
[1:07:34] reading verse 6 to 12
[1:07:38] it says
[1:07:40] now there was a day when the sons of god
[1:07:42] came to present themselves before the
[1:07:44] lord
[1:07:46] worship they present themselves
[1:07:48] and satan came also among them and
[1:07:51] there's something in particular i want
[1:07:52] you to look at and the lord said unto
[1:07:54] satan whence cometh thou
[1:07:58] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:08:00] from listen
[1:08:02] from going to and through in the earth
[1:08:05] and from walking up and down in it
[1:08:09] so you know
[1:08:10] you go into the grocery you going to
[1:08:13] work you go into school and you think is
[1:08:15] you alone going to school
[1:08:17] you alone walk in the road and you go
[1:08:19] into church but listen to what he says
[1:08:21] he said
[1:08:23] the lord said
[1:08:24] where you know come from
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:28] because his sons are god presenting
[1:08:30] themselves and you show up where you
[1:08:31] coming from and he says from going to
[1:08:34] anthro in the earth and from walking up
[1:08:36] and down he walking all around looking
[1:08:39] for mischief
[1:08:40] and the lord said until satan has now
[1:08:42] considered
[1:08:43] when you busy doing nothing going up and
[1:08:46] down looking for people to terrorize
[1:08:49] have you considered my silver job
[1:08:52] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:08:54] so all the places that you walk you
[1:08:56] haven't found anybody that could be
[1:08:58] compared unto him and this is the
[1:09:00] description he gave a perfect and an
[1:09:02] upright man now i say that and i told
[1:09:05] you i told the gentleman this i said
[1:09:07] because
[1:09:08] we can clearly say even brother branham
[1:09:11] said jesus loved the rich young ruler
[1:09:13] you know
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:16] he was he was a great guy
[1:09:19] he was a guy going places he was a
[1:09:22] businessman he was an exemplary person
[1:09:25] i'm sure it's a society but when given
[1:09:28] the challenge he failed
[1:09:30] the prodigal son we could say you know
[1:09:32] what he was a backslider
[1:09:34] he left god he left his father he left
[1:09:37] what he thought
[1:09:38] and
[1:09:40] eventually he came back
[1:09:42] but you know with job god described him
[1:09:44] as a perfect and upright man
[1:09:47] not doing much not doing wrong he said
[1:09:49] one that feared god in verse 8 and a
[1:09:52] stuart evil
[1:09:55] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:09:57] job fair god for naught in all in other
[1:10:01] words satan is asking
[1:10:03] you feel he fear you because he fear you
[1:10:06] for nothing just because and this is the
[1:10:08] description i was alluding to before
[1:10:10] has not dull mage and hedge about him so
[1:10:14] that sounds like a hedge right
[1:10:16] and then you know what he says and about
[1:10:18] his house
[1:10:21] so you form a hedge about him then you
[1:10:24] form a hedge about his house
[1:10:26] about all that he had on every side
[1:10:30] everything that he has that he is
[1:10:32] associated with you form a hedge around
[1:10:34] that
[1:10:36] thou has blessed the work of his hand so
[1:10:38] everything he touch everything he does
[1:10:39] you have already blessed that
[1:10:41] and his substance is increased in the
[1:10:44] land his cattle his his his i mean
[1:10:47] everything this man touched as we see
[1:10:50] turned to gold everything expanded every
[1:10:53] every boundary he has has been enlarged
[1:10:56] his plans prospering his animals
[1:10:59] prospering his family prospering once
[1:11:01] again
[1:11:02] god
[1:11:03] didn't want the rich young ruler
[1:11:06] to move from his status of being the
[1:11:08] rich young ruler
[1:11:10] god wanted to highlight to him that he
[1:11:13] had something to do that he was not
[1:11:15] prepared to do that he was not prepared
[1:11:18] to give up
[1:11:21] it goes on
[1:11:22] in verse 11 of job one he said but put
[1:11:26] forth thine hand now
[1:11:28] and touch all that he had
[1:11:32] and he will curse thee to thy face
[1:11:35] and the lord said unto satan behold
[1:11:38] all that he has is in thy power
[1:11:41] only upon himself put not fought thy
[1:11:44] hand so satan went forth from the
[1:11:47] presence of god and i paused there
[1:11:49] because it made me wonder
[1:11:52] you have a
[1:11:53] a minute what god is saying about you
[1:11:56] you ever wonder
[1:11:58] what satan is saying about you
[1:12:01] i say a prayer every time i leave my
[1:12:03] home once i step in my car this is the
[1:12:05] prayer i say and i could sing it because
[1:12:07] i say it all the time
[1:12:09] i say lord i want you to bless me i want
[1:12:11] you to cover me i want you to cover my
[1:12:13] car
[1:12:14] cover my family cover my house cover my
[1:12:17] assets
[1:12:18] i use those words
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:21] the orders might be mixed up but
[1:12:23] i say that you know why because when i
[1:12:26] leave home
[1:12:27] i don't know who could try to interfere
[1:12:31] i don't know like job
[1:12:33] adventure seats and at that time say you
[1:12:36] know what
[1:12:37] he just seemed too cool you know
[1:12:40] he just seemed like he have it in order
[1:12:43] he she going to the bank
[1:12:47] let me just mess this up but you know
[1:12:48] what i pray that god will do that to me
[1:12:52] every single day multiple times a day
[1:12:55] you know why
[1:12:56] because we just read
[1:12:59] through scripture in the bible that
[1:13:01] these are things that are taking place
[1:13:04] and if god is the mirror
[1:13:06] if the bible is the word of god and the
[1:13:09] word is the mirror
[1:13:11] i should be able to see myself in the
[1:13:13] world
[1:13:14] i should be able to see my flaws i
[1:13:16] should be able to see my challenges
[1:13:18] as a matter of fact when jesus was under
[1:13:21] they said you know they didn't want
[1:13:23] anything be uncommon they didn't want
[1:13:25] anything be strange they wanted him to
[1:13:27] really have a solid firm understanding
[1:13:30] of what we go through
[1:13:32] so he can relate to us
[1:13:34] which is why he didn't speak one way or
[1:13:37] give one parable that answers all
[1:13:40] he gave multiple
[1:13:41] the same way we learned differently he
[1:13:44] used different approaches so this is
[1:13:46] what i did with the man i was speaking
[1:13:48] to i didn't give him a scripture and say
[1:13:51] hola
[1:13:54] because i can't predict where he is i
[1:13:56] can't predict where you are
[1:13:58] god knows that i don't so all i could do
[1:14:01] is throw the different types of
[1:14:04] artillery i have
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:06] the goal is to kill you
[1:14:08] so a knife may not work by using a gun
[1:14:11] a gun manager you work at using a sword
[1:14:14] you know i i want to throw things out to
[1:14:16] ensure at the end of the day the message
[1:14:20] gets home
[1:14:22] my time is almost up but i want to share
[1:14:25] one more thing just one more right
[1:14:29] and
[1:14:30] you know
[1:14:31] it was such a joy to me and it was so
[1:14:34] natural to me
[1:14:35] that
[1:14:36] i wasn't trying to pretend to him
[1:14:38] i wasn't trying to teach him something
[1:14:41] spiritual
[1:14:42] we were just talking i wasn't reading
[1:14:44] scriptures or quotes or anything to him
[1:14:46] i tell him i said man listen yeah what's
[1:14:48] going on i can't tell you why you're in
[1:14:50] the position you're in but i could tell
[1:14:52] you in the bible it have some folks that
[1:14:54] summon just like you i'm not sure which
[1:14:56] one it is but i could give you the
[1:14:58] options
[1:15:00] you choose you do you allow god to work
[1:15:03] based on the options are shared
[1:15:05] hopefully something will resonate with
[1:15:07] you and that's my prayer tonight that
[1:15:09] something will resonate with you that
[1:15:11] you could see yourself
[1:15:13] and you could make the adjustments you
[1:15:15] need i can't say whether you're good to
[1:15:17] great i can't say whether you're down or
[1:15:20] you're up i can't say a rich or poor but
[1:15:22] you know what god knows
[1:15:24] and he
[1:15:26] ensures that all things that's what
[1:15:28] romans 8 said for we know that all
[1:15:31] things work together for good to them
[1:15:34] that loves him to them that are called
[1:15:37] according to his purpose and i believe
[1:15:39] the fact that you're here tonight you
[1:15:41] are called according to his purpose the
[1:15:44] fact that you you are here tonight is
[1:15:46] similar to the victory rich young ruler
[1:15:48] you've come to hear what more can i do
[1:15:52] what good should i do what more could
[1:15:55] could be added to my life my prayer life
[1:15:57] i i read the bible i read the scripture
[1:15:59] i listened to the
[1:16:01] messages the quotes i go to church
[1:16:03] perhaps with
[1:16:06] over the last two years i've been locked
[1:16:07] down right i have been feeding on
[1:16:10] convention tape but what more can i do
[1:16:13] we always say church is not for the well
[1:16:16] special services are not because you
[1:16:18] feel awesome and great
[1:16:20] you come to get recharged to to tweak a
[1:16:23] little bit to change a little bit to to
[1:16:25] structure and help adventure you could
[1:16:28] be improved per adventure you can be
[1:16:30] pushed further down the road to
[1:16:32] perfection
[1:16:34] at the end of the day god is coming for
[1:16:37] a church that jesus could walk through
[1:16:39] it
[1:16:40] that can happen if you caught up in your
[1:16:42] thoughts and ideas and and self and
[1:16:45] pride and jealousy and greed and anger
[1:16:48] and things that we can't see you need to
[1:16:50] deal with that
[1:16:51] you need to see yourself in the mirror
[1:16:54] and see the way you have to adjust as a
[1:16:56] matter of fact in a practical sense if
[1:16:58] you have an important interview or
[1:17:00] important person to go see if they did
[1:17:03] we just had national awards i believe in
[1:17:05] trinidad if you had to collect a
[1:17:07] national award today i'm pretty sure
[1:17:09] before you leave home you will look in
[1:17:11] the mirror
[1:17:14] whether you have the best clothes or
[1:17:16] clothes half clothes however it is you
[1:17:18] will look in the mirror as a reference
[1:17:20] to ensure
[1:17:21] that you are clothed
[1:17:23] appropriately for the occasion
[1:17:26] that your attire could be reflective of
[1:17:28] what is necessary for the occasion you
[1:17:31] want to perhaps ensure that that that
[1:17:33] your clothes match
[1:17:35] that that it making sense
[1:17:38] and with that said you know i wanted to
[1:17:40] to ask you a question just for you to
[1:17:42] think a second we often hear folks
[1:17:45] loosely say choose your struggle
[1:17:48] choose your challenge choose your battle
[1:17:49] choose your fight
[1:17:52] and all that i'm sharing here i shared
[1:17:54] with him i say you know
[1:17:55] you've told me things about your family
[1:17:57] life and your finances and stuff but
[1:18:00] oftentimes you ever thought
[1:18:02] if you had to choose what choice you
[1:18:04] will make
[1:18:06] i say if the choices that you were
[1:18:08] presented
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] look like
[1:18:13] sickness
[1:18:14] health related challenges
[1:18:17] broken relationships family drama
[1:18:20] financial struggles
[1:18:22] things that people may go through on a
[1:18:24] day-to-day basis
[1:18:26] i said if you had to choose a trial
[1:18:29] which one you will choose
[1:18:31] and i stay quiet
[1:18:33] awaiting you choose
[1:18:36] i couldn't exhaust all but i'm saying if
[1:18:39] you had a true a choice to be poor
[1:18:42] to be sick
[1:18:43] on the brink of that you know to to have
[1:18:47] your children disobeying disobedient
[1:18:50] your child locked up in jail which trial
[1:18:53] would you choose
[1:18:55] you call yourself a christian right
[1:18:56] which trial would you choose
[1:18:59] and reality is
[1:19:01] when faced with the options
[1:19:05] i know which one we'll choose you know
[1:19:07] i believe we'll all choose the same
[1:19:09] thing
[1:19:10] and the choice we will make is to choose
[1:19:12] none
[1:19:14] which is why god is the chooser
[1:19:17] god is the one that has assigned it to
[1:19:19] us and that's what i shared with him i
[1:19:20] say you know
[1:19:22] if you had a choice which one you will
[1:19:24] pick sickness
[1:19:27] which one you'll pick
[1:19:28] poverty
[1:19:30] which one you'll pick
[1:19:32] yeah and he realized he couldn't give me
[1:19:34] an answer so i answered for him in this
[1:19:36] case i said that's why god does the
[1:19:39] choosing you don't get to pick the trial
[1:19:41] you want and say you know what lord i
[1:19:42] signing up for sickness
[1:19:45] no you don't do that
[1:19:46] you don't say lord listen
[1:19:48] i signing up for poverty and no you
[1:19:51] don't
[1:19:52] so god knows
[1:19:54] based on his goodness based on his
[1:19:57] foreign knowledge based on his
[1:19:58] predestination what you need to make you
[1:20:01] stronger he knew after job went through
[1:20:04] his struggles that job will be there and
[1:20:07] say listen do these kin worms destroy my
[1:20:10] body yet in my flesh i will see god
[1:20:14] god knew exactly the characteristics he
[1:20:16] wanted to come out
[1:20:18] so he knew what to send him through is
[1:20:20] the same reason that moses was sent into
[1:20:22] the wilderness after killing one man for
[1:20:25] 40 years
[1:20:26] god knew the education the knowledge he
[1:20:29] thought the ideas he had that he wanted
[1:20:32] to burn out that he wanted the
[1:20:35] desert itself to really excavate from
[1:20:38] from within him so he could say lord um
[1:20:40] you know what i was a ruler in egypt i
[1:20:43] was somebody i was a member of the who's
[1:20:46] who i was only one percent but but lord
[1:20:48] i can't talk
[1:20:50] lord um i don't know what what what to
[1:20:52] say what to share you want me to lead
[1:20:54] two plus million people out of egypt and
[1:20:57] and i am i am in the desert yeah i'm a
[1:20:59] farmer now
[1:21:00] i'm a family man
[1:21:03] but that is what god wanted to send him
[1:21:06] through in order to let him come out the
[1:21:07] other side of the line ready to go into
[1:21:10] action i know time is running away
[1:21:12] quickly and i did say i want to share
[1:21:15] one more more thing i want to take the
[1:21:16] opportunity to do so for now
[1:21:19] is one more thing i i
[1:21:21] i really think
[1:21:24] is something i want to leave with you
[1:21:25] something i want you to think on and it
[1:21:28] is found in the book of genesis
[1:21:30] genesis 13 verse 5 to 12. i mean i don't
[1:21:34] mean for this to sound like a bible
[1:21:36] study at all
[1:21:37] but genesis 13 verse 5 to 12. it speaks
[1:21:41] of lot and it says unlocked also which
[1:21:43] went with abram had flocks and herds and
[1:21:46] tents
[1:21:47] just as a context when you read tense
[1:21:50] and we could read this statement again
[1:21:51] it says had flocks
[1:21:53] and herds and tents
[1:21:55] tense speak to stability ten speak to be
[1:21:59] implanted being grounded
[1:22:02] verse six and the land was not able to
[1:22:04] bear them
[1:22:05] that they might dwell together for their
[1:22:08] substance was great so
[1:22:11] abram was not a poor man
[1:22:13] lot was not a poor man their substance
[1:22:16] was great so that they could not dwell
[1:22:18] together it was so much and overflowing
[1:22:21] that they couldn't be together in the
[1:22:22] same space verse seven it says and there
[1:22:25] was a strife between the hood men of
[1:22:27] abraham's couple and the third man of
[1:22:29] lot's cattle i want you to watch that
[1:22:31] there was no drama between abram and lot
[1:22:34] they were related the drama was between
[1:22:36] their hoodsmen right
[1:22:39] and
[1:22:40] the canaanite and the parasite dwelled
[1:22:43] them in the land and abrams abraham said
[1:22:46] unto lot
[1:22:47] let there be no strife i pray between me
[1:22:49] and they and between my hood men and thy
[1:22:51] with men for we be brethren
[1:22:54] it's not the whole land before thee
[1:22:56] separate thyself i pray thee from me if
[1:22:58] thou will take the left hand i will go
[1:23:00] to the right if thou depart to the right
[1:23:02] hand i will go to the left and lot
[1:23:04] lifted up his eyes and beheld all the
[1:23:07] plane of jordan and it was well watered
[1:23:09] everywhere before the lord destroyed
[1:23:11] sodom and gomorrah so this was
[1:23:13] pre-destruction
[1:23:14] even as the garden of the lord like the
[1:23:16] land of egypt
[1:23:18] as thou promised unto zore
[1:23:21] then lot shows him on the plane of
[1:23:23] jordan and lord journeyed east and they
[1:23:25] separated themselves the one from the
[1:23:28] other abraham dwells in the land of
[1:23:30] canaan and lot dwell in the cities of
[1:23:31] the plain
[1:23:32] and this is the most important line as
[1:23:34] far as i see and pitch his tent towards
[1:23:37] sodom and i had a thought you know i
[1:23:39] read this and i read this and i read
[1:23:40] this over and over and over and that
[1:23:43] last line struck me and pitched his tent
[1:23:46] towards saddam and what i wanted to take
[1:23:49] away from there is not the fact that he
[1:23:51] was wealthy not the fact that their
[1:23:53] substance was so increased that they
[1:23:54] couldn't coexist but he pitched his tent
[1:23:56] in a particular direction and oftentimes
[1:23:59] we we have heard it said his intent or
[1:24:03] his intention was not to go to saddam
[1:24:06] but he pitched his tents towards south
[1:24:08] sudan and if we read the very words by
[1:24:10] nature
[1:24:12] his intent and his tent was in opposing
[1:24:15] directions
[1:24:16] his intent wasn't to go but his tent was
[1:24:18] going so we as individuals have to be
[1:24:21] careful where we plant our tent where
[1:24:23] where we push our tent where where where
[1:24:26] we want to settle the direction in which
[1:24:28] we want to plant it because i didn't say
[1:24:30] when we speak tent we see flock right we
[1:24:32] see herd we see tent tent mean you're
[1:24:35] settled so you have to look at your tent
[1:24:37] and work right you may love it and
[1:24:40] you're subtle and you're comfortable and
[1:24:42] everything is okay but but your intent
[1:24:45] may not be to be in a particular place
[1:24:47] but because you have placed your tent
[1:24:49] and planted you attend to what a
[1:24:51] particular place you find yourself there
[1:24:53] right it's it's similar to a christian
[1:24:56] saying listen i'm a christian i don't
[1:24:57] smoke i don't drink i don't do this or
[1:24:59] not in the other but i'm going to work
[1:25:01] in a bar because i can't get at work
[1:25:04] it's just a matter of time before
[1:25:06] because you've put your tent there
[1:25:08] your intent may never have been that but
[1:25:11] before you know it all of a sudden
[1:25:13] you start off with a chandi you know
[1:25:16] you start off with a little thing then
[1:25:18] you know what you're just mixing the
[1:25:19] drinks you're not drinking it you're
[1:25:20] just mixing it so so you're you're doing
[1:25:24] something for
[1:25:25] the clients before you know it you
[1:25:27] involved in it hook line and sinker so i
[1:25:30] read that so you will be careful of
[1:25:32] where your your
[1:25:34] directing your tent right the direction
[1:25:36] you're going where you want to settle
[1:25:39] and with that said i am i'm almost
[1:25:43] closed i'm almost done i'm almost out
[1:25:45] but there's something i must read i'm
[1:25:47] not putting it on the screen but i must
[1:25:50] read it's actually a simple prayer that
[1:25:52] brother branham prayed i know it's
[1:25:54] thoughts that were we'll chop together i
[1:25:57] pray that that god will really stitch it
[1:25:59] together and making meaningful to your
[1:26:02] heart that you could look and reflect
[1:26:04] on the mirror of the word and see where
[1:26:07] you are see where you're falling short
[1:26:08] see where you have to improve and
[1:26:11] with that i just want to read this last
[1:26:13] prayer
[1:26:14] a simple prayer he prayed
[1:26:16] and
[1:26:18] it is from modern events that are made
[1:26:20] clear by prophecy preached in 65 the 6th
[1:26:24] of december
[1:26:26] and
[1:26:27] it goes like like this
[1:26:29] and tonight
[1:26:30] so far as i know the church maybe
[1:26:33] the time of calling may be already
[1:26:35] passed i don't know i can't see
[1:26:38] remember the people went right on having
[1:26:40] the meetings just the same after the
[1:26:43] crucifixion of jesus
[1:26:45] and
[1:26:45] all the people
[1:26:47] they'll come they watch they they'll go
[1:26:51] right on preaching and saying they're
[1:26:52] getting saved and everything just as if
[1:26:55] the world continues on
[1:26:58] as it was they say but it'll be too late
[1:27:01] then
[1:27:02] while you got a chance my brother
[1:27:04] while you got a chance my sister come
[1:27:07] into the kingdom of god you don't have
[1:27:09] to come in under anything else but just
[1:27:12] plain faith to believe his word
[1:27:14] he is that word lord jesus
[1:27:19] i know i'm looking at myself now in the
[1:27:21] mirror of god's word oh how short i am
[1:27:24] but dear god here tonight
[1:27:26] on this he says monday nights i say
[1:27:28] friday night on this monday night
[1:27:31] here in san bernardino california and i
[1:27:34] say here
[1:27:35] on this zoom call that we have in
[1:27:37] trinidad
[1:27:39] right here
[1:27:40] this is all i have lord but i'll give it
[1:27:43] to you will you take me as i am lord
[1:27:45] will you let me flee to the cross right
[1:27:47] quick i even see the messengers i see
[1:27:49] the time i see the calling out of sodom
[1:27:52] i see the signs i see the abraham's
[1:27:56] group receiving the light
[1:27:58] i see the manifestation
[1:28:00] jesus being manifested again right among
[1:28:03] us like it was i see all the things that
[1:28:05] you promised i see the impersonators i
[1:28:08] see you said that
[1:28:10] as it was in the days of moses how
[1:28:13] jamborees and janice would come back to
[1:28:14] imprison it and still remain right in
[1:28:17] that same dump that they were in see
[1:28:19] they couldn't follow moses through that
[1:28:20] wood and take those children out of
[1:28:22] there into the wilderness because they
[1:28:24] were associated in egypt
[1:28:26] they couldn't do it though they done the
[1:28:28] same works he did but their folly was
[1:28:30] made manifest and the bible says
[1:28:32] that thus said the lord
[1:28:34] it will take place again in the last
[1:28:36] days and you
[1:28:37] see it with your own eyes if you're
[1:28:39] spiritual
[1:28:40] um i can't explain it
[1:28:42] it's not necessary for me to explain it
[1:28:44] my sheep hear my voice let's go to him
[1:28:46] now while we have a chance will you
[1:28:49] if you have need of the baptism of the
[1:28:50] holy ghost if you have need of a
[1:28:52] rededication a new life your pastor
[1:28:55] won't despise you he'll love you for it
[1:28:58] just give yourself completely to god

[1:29:07] i don't do that to be mean i do that to
[1:29:09] be honest i do that because i love you i
[1:29:11] love god and i do it to try to help you
[1:29:15] and truly friend i i i believe
[1:29:18] and with all my heart with all my faith

[1:29:26] the years now listen
