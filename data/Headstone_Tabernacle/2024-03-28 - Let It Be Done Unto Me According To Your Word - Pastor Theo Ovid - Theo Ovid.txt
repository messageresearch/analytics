me out of the way and may you speak to our heart in Jesus name I ask amen amen God bless you it's a privilege to be here tonight and um I consider honor to be here so if you have your Bibles there's one scripture Luke chapter 1 you want to read verse 26 I have a title this night let it be done unto me according to your word and Luke 1 verse 26 Luke in the sixth month of the in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God the city of Gile to a virgin exposed to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said heal thou highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women El and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast form favor with God and behold thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel who shall this be see I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold th cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is a six month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handman of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her may God bless his word you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord have a title tonight let it be done unto me according to your word I have a subject you must be the word manifested to be the bride I'll say it again you must be the word manifested to be the bride and I have an inspiration Messiah of the last day the well blessing for me to hear Messiah is the king of King okay let's go let's go so this word is waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again so this word has to become personalized to you in other words the word can't stay General David said the Lord will that which concerned me some point in time this word has to connect personally to you I'm not talking about goding a prophet that's General there's going to be a bride that's General there going to be a super Church that is General but when it comes to the F print you have got to see you or you have to see your name in the book oh Blessed Be of the Lord do you see it tonight so something happened with Mary Mary was going to service regularly she was here in Isaiah 96 Isaiah 7:4 a virgin shall conceive but that word was for everybody because nobody know who that virgin is everybody hearing a virgin shall can see but that word for everybody there was a specific name when Isaiah said a version shall conceive there was a specific name that God was speaking about if you notice in the scripture we read how detailed it was that there'll be no mistake about it oh blessed be the name of the Lord they in the six month Angel Gabriel sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth very detailed very specific to a virgin exposed to a man named Joseph and this Joseph he doesn't belong to any and any house he belongs to the House of David and the Virgin name is Mary when your name is on the book and when the ministry come to speak to the word your name is being expressed by the word to you and you have to get a revelation and you must see that you see your name and when you see your name your life is completely changed it is not everybody anymore it's about you it's about the calling God put in your life what God has blessed no man could curse what God has blessed no man can take that blessing off of you because God himself has sent out a call to get you this world is so evil the prophet said hell has been uncovered the lid of hell and streams of demon power so it take a third pull power to pull you out take a power to take you through not just reading a book not just listening to a table take our power we have our children they are facing hell on the earth it will take a power to keep them preserve them we have to have power the scientists they not using bow and arrow and little pistols they are discovering more and more power with nuclear weapon and technology and to effectively we cannot sit in ignorance something have to break out it's got to break out with somebody let it be you that you could hear the word and say like Mary be it done unto me if the sister next door don't want to shout that nothing to do with me I'm shouting because I see my name I am shouting because I know I will be delivered I am shouting because I know it's finished Oh Glory to God do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so brother Bram they were praying for a messiah they wanted the Messiah and God sent him in the way he wanted him but they refus him why they refuse him because he didn't come in the fashion and in the way they desire to come it always troubled me why Jesus didn't go and take Bible people and scroll reading people why did Jesus find fishermen prostitutes Tax Collectors all kind of people follow me follow me follow me because these men don't have any ideas in their head he brought a word and they believe Oh Glory to God they following a man without a revelation something inside of them responding to the call of God because Jesus said say some say you this some say you that Jesus turned the guns them who do you say I am and they got caught they didn't know who he was and Peter said don't the Christ and Jesus said the spirit the Lord before he said that he said Peter in other words he identify and he tacked Peter as an individual all the other disciples was there all the other church members were there but Jesus said Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church at the case of hell all the other disciples were there but Peter got a revelation so don't just sit and look at me say Lord I want that Revelation I want that Rock tonight that no devil can't move me nothing going to shake me Give the Lord Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Revelation to God when elzar ask Rebecca oh God time to go mother say stay back a few more days brother say hold back a few more days he said let the damel speak you go with this man she was an individual her mother can't talk for her her brother can't talk for her nobody can talk for you you have got to get it for yourself she said I will go to a man she had not seen she had not heard his voice but something inside of her and when she turned to go they say may you be the mother of millions hallelujah hallelu oh glory to God there's a bride in America there's a bride in Miami there's bride in this church has send you his word in vain the ministry is not preaching in vain seed is not shown in vain some fell on the way side not all some fall among rocks all among all but someing good ground I feel some good tonight every seed must bring forth after his kind glory to God Oh Glory to God the Jews want a messiah to fight Rome everybody looking for messiah stand up over R isn't that right not Messiah means anointed and the church want a messiah a genius that's what they're looking for I call it some message Pope or some Superman or some bright educated he said God's Messiah is the anointed word made manifest they want their Creed they want a genius B man of the man of the man of the hour it's foolishness stop looking for some man of the hour look for the Messiah look for the King of Kings look for the word becoming anointed Oh Glory to God the word itself coming anointed Jesus he read the scripture the spirit is upon me because he had anointed Glory anointed Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah butam says we have got the Messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God it is just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again oh glory to God you anointed William BR was to turn our hands to the faith of the fathers that we could take the faith and anoint the promises take the faith and pull the power of Fai tonight yes you not sitting Fai unconscious is unconscious you cannot manufacture fa something in you it's already there God put it in you before the foundation of the world you are sitting there watching me if you don't know what I'm talking about but it is what God put in you that you to respond to this entire message the reason that you believe this message because God put something in you when it was in the Catholic church it was in you when he was in the Baptist Church it wasn't you when you was in the world it wasn't you and the devil couldn't touch it the devil couldn't touch it when it was in when he was in the world the devil can't touch you now you have to but he can't touch oh blessed be this message this message of the hour is waiting for somebody somewhere maybe tonight maybe is you that could have faith to anointed you mean this is about me Lord the spirit going to anoint me the Lord will perfect that which considered me you see it's easy have Fai for everybody we will be blessed that's everybody but when it come to person do you have faith for your personal blessing could you do like Caleb and not waiting for the tries anybody asking for anybody saying anything so nobody saying anything I'm not saying anything also not Caleb Caleb step forward I am not talking for Judah I am not talking for Ephraim I am not talking for man now therefore give me give me my my Mountain could you say that is it so personal to you that you want your mountain mountain you know he have his Mountain not your neighbor Mountain not your friend Mountain not your mother Mountain you want your Mountain do you have a revelation of your Mountain because you could only fight what you know Glory do you get that you conf fight you know is your if you know this land is your you will not let any devil take that because you have a revelation that this thing belong to you God told Joshua every place you put your foot that is yours no amorites no hater noes just stop you from your land put your foot tonight say his mind tonight healing his mind Deliverance is mind the Holy Ghost is mind hisory give the Lord a sh every promise in the every promise in the book every promise in the book it's m tonight glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the Bible said while they were few very few he suffer no man to do them wrong he said touch not my anointing and do my prophets no how this bride of Jesus Christ she will be anointed and no devil to touch that woman tonight highly favored hallelujah hallelujah hallu I say tonightly bless among woman salute to the Bride of Jesus Christ bless among wom among churches remember the bride is other group The Bride is individuals that is baptized into the kingdom between a bed one a field one Tak one left which one are you going to be Tri you come be Bap into the body you to make you have the Fe to speak to call oh my word is for somebody with faith anointed when God God fed up of Soul God told Samuel crying for that man already the finish with him go to the House of David Jessie and anoint one of his son look what God does never told Samu he said go go to that house anoint one of his son when Samuel went the come per well dressed Sam himself said this is he when Sam that this is no don't look at height look at size look at complexion look at Tex you have to get the witness of the spirit so when Samuel get the understanding God looking for something for one know wit pass this one he pass all of them he said do you have anymore [Music] the Sheep be smelly so much she up David coming mud his foot clo take presence of his the presence of not privately dripping with [Music] o Hallelujah of his head bless and back that same day that same day that same time evil spirit and David was anointed evil spirited you know what they wanted because in those days devil were cast out testimony they would away Spirits by mus guess we could play music David so they send for David to play cool down David is walking in the palace that he'll be king walking the for him to walk playing the music because he's anointed he's not ready yet but he's anointed he is not placed yet but he's Anointed God could have still anoint you and you're not ready yet but you will be ready the Bible say his wife have made ready you will be ready get the anointing get this oil get this quicking power you have to have it every devil know it GL to God it's just written somebody with faith to anoint it make a he can live again the church is spiritually dead SL they hardly know what to do and here every promise that God made in the Bible is just as good oh said he said God will take his word that he promised for this day and anointed and it would happen there is no way to keep no matter what the church says or the rest of them he said be one as I am the father a one be that kind of a one then how will it be how will we become one here's the answer the word in US would be the anointed that is the Oneness of God now you know you have been taught what's the secret the word is in the brein that's what the prophet said the Holy Spirit take up a pen and write the secret the word is in the bride so as the man preached the word word is not going into you but now tonight that word in you has become anointed am that's a different thing that is a seed and the anointing is the to in you and once the water strikes the SE it is the spirit that quickened the flesh profited nothing this is Jesus speaking now the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the words that came out's was spirit in word form or in seed form now God know what he spoke to that Prophet The God that spoke through him know his words that came out of his mouth so when we say back the words it's not just saying back what the prophet say it is speaking Spirit giv words Spirit spoken word god couldn't just give you Spirit he give you his word I'm amazed how this omnipotent God could subject himself to his own laws in other words he loves you but you have to repent his love for you doesn't cancel your repentance because he says though your sins be as scet they shall be white as snow but you have to acknowledge your iniquity you have to acknowledge your sin and when you do that I could come and do something about it so you understand that so he in the beginning said let there be light that word a seed so he spoke his word and maybe a million years p and when the word become anointed there was Jesus come but God subject himself to the law of reproduction by creating a sperm and an egg put it in Mary and come to the regular way prophesy by Isaiah a virgin shall conceive this virgin don't have a clue it is her that Isaiah talking about now watch Mary name was in that scripture a virgin shall conceive so in the realm of the natural that scripture is specific one person Oh Glory to God she can't miss it if she try nobody can take a place nobody can claim that because in the of the spirit when Isaiah prophesied when Isaiah said voice of one Cry of wilderness only one person can fulfill that that is John the Baptist so when God was talking about the bride is only you could s the no nobody they are I don't care what job they I don't care what car they drive to take your place you are original you are authentic you are of God you belong to God hallelujah hallelujah Mary you have to say be it done unto me according to th word according to the scriptures I can't talk with nobody El the when joh when John saw the lamb Che the book loose the SE said all in heaven all under the Earth Praise Him John had a personal ration a personal testimony before he left had a testimony before you leave him before you leave God just look at [Applause] me Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you have a testimony God understand this we were born in sin iniquity there's no good in us there's no good things in we have no righteousness so for a man to walk in righteousness it has to be God it has to be God it has to be it's not normal Oh Glory to God do you realize the Bible said accept God cut the work short no flesh will be [Music] saved every year it's getting worse every year man is at risk RIS cut Hallelujah understand this God have a program and Satan have a program run in America run Russia Every Nation inspir them whing in their laws to set up things to cancel the devil doing that Daniel said I saw Stone cut out without the hands of that's Dynamics that's the coming of the head stone that's our Stone glory to God hallelu and that stone to strike that image and break down the image of tonight you are on The Winning Side glory to God you on The Winning Side Hallelujah so Jesus in Luke I know you're I'm going to summarize it this is where he get the parable of the so and the seed some fell by the wayside some fell upon a rock some fell among to and they were choked and others fell on good ground and be 100f then he told them unto you is given to know the mystery this par of the seed is the key to all things because this is what God does sends out his word and see who are do you get it now out his word and see who watch this now then explain the seed is the word by the wayside take it away out of their hearts those that are on Rock these are people that come to church they receive with joy and afterwards they fall away the toughest one is the one that fell among T they heard the word and I choked with cares and riches I don't know in I don't know when you have a corn plant and it have Vines around it I don't know what you call it in and peel it two sometime no grein was time it was choked so we could believe receive but end up choked simple of Life Rich things that tin you up that don't give it freedom and to give God your because you have this to do and then nothing for the kingdom nothing for God's [Music] honor nothing to magnify the when last have you testified when last have you invited people when last have you given your testimony a testimony is not for you a testimony is for others God bless you God give you something that's not for you that's for you to sh and that's glorify God you can testify and show others how God so what merciful such a blessing to me my testimony oh hallelujah hallelujah the goodness of God the mercies of God things was bad but it could have been worse so I come to praise God tonight A man was complaining he had no shoes he stopped complaining when he saw somebody with no Fe there is always somebody in our worst condition [Applause] to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah God is pleased when you praise Him am Miss hard circumstances you don't praise God because you got to raise a pay or a new job when when things go wrong the car break down don't get Hallelujah Glory the devil get confused because the devil expect you to be frustrated and express frustration when you expected to beated iess [Applause] huj God is a provider my God is a way maker glorify God stri oh what God want to hear God want to hear the testimony God is healing [Applause] me above [Music] ground the ground you above [Applause] tonight life to hallu glory to God devil take man man give him a rocking chair he [Music] s because God revealed to me I shall not see death until I see the CR Christ not com to my house me rock into no chair going CH because I know once Messiah come you have to dedicate him in church every service May falls asleep some know that God let God tell this old man that's my testimony everybody God told me I will not see that Grim Reaper holding his his stff he said got to wait your got to wait until I see the every service service wa one day Mary came with baby Jesus she pass when she pass an anointing over him Tove of woman them line up and passing each one pass this woman he pass this church he pass this woman he pass this he pass this when he come Rock him right there my God took the baby Mar's in the spirit human leave me baby alone who you she in the spirit the baby in peace for my eyes Hallelujah show it's not an accident I sh you individuals breaking in the realm of Revelation [Music] a woman you glory to God don't tell me God can't come and leave you God LED you tonight that's why you here leted you to be here and God brought you here he has a word for you you must get connected with a personal identification done unto me my portion tonight give me my mountain tonight I want my portion Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah friends you have got to possess listen to this your individual inheritance gr had a group testimony when Jesus from the dead the disciples had a group testimony group testimony was we have seen the Lord seen the Lord but in the upper room the pill of fire a lick of fire was on each of them was not General fire everybody got individual hallelujah hallelujah you want your lick of fire you want to leave that Li of Fire let's go God's son was his example seed and when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism about Jesus now the Holy Ghost came upon him and the Very life that he produced that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost the terminology he call it the watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost if the same seed son if that same seed is in you then the watering spirit that comes upon that seed will produce the same life no excuses oh blessed be the name of Hallelujah said now watch he said Oak will do no good it wasn't stroke up anything you see a real seed of God is absorbing to the spirit that's why sometime God have to do something to let there be a break in your life sometime you're too strong you are too strong in yourself you're too strong in your flesh God let you crack up sometimes and break up sometimes SI sometimes fall sometimes in order that the spirit can have and that's why he needed some to be broken that he could use you isn't that something else glory to God so when God's spirit Waters the seed of God it produces God oh Blessed Be of Lord so Jesus died that he might reconcile us back to his son and da of God that through the church might flow the same life the word being manifested so do you understand that adoption is not based upon the minister sermon adoption is not based upon messages preached adoption is specifically based on the character of the man nothing to do with the sermon because if it's the sermon a sister can't be adopted and we will have adopted Sons and Daughters do you get it now so what God looking for is his own life reflected in each one of us even the fold Ministry is temporary lot of ministers may not know that but until we all come when we all come in the unity of the faith in the knowledge of Son of God in your personal measure of the perfect man what more could they do we all into that image of God then that image brings us back to because that image is what God placed that image is what fell and that image is what God is restoring that image back into he tried with the Pentecostal but the Pentecost rejected the word and the word produced the image so they come short by the Dynamics that struck them so now he said a prophet to reveal the son of man and the son of man is the S the S he put the seat in you the Dynamics your seat oh praise God praise God that's how we wrap up here hallelujah praise the name of the Lord all right so in 1950 came to identify this Prophet isn't that right so he William Bram to anoint him Revelation luk 1 to read these scriptures believe that this is what he come to for think about it it's not easy to do that he growing up first P second P know you have a third P open of the word so he had to keep anointing what God Said concerning him now you as the bride of Christ you have to begin to anoint what God said about you for example Revelation 27 the spirit and the bride say come that's not everybody that is specific the bride is connected inside of that the same I do shall you do [Music] also Hallelujah if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will that you is not everybody are you hearing me tonight because I want you to say your heart be it done unto me according to the prophecy according to Hallelujah Hallelujah 1081 The Voice told joh to the angel and say give me the book take it eat it and prophesy prophesy what prophesy the words of the book If a man eat that book the words out of his mouth will be from that book prophesy what there's going to be a super Church there going to be a super Church there's going to be a super race going to be a bride of [Applause] CH let me see I can wrap up but listen to this let's look at Mary again Mary she's in church she's sharing the word she taking it like we just take it in God said it God said it God said it but she's not yet connected to it she know the scripture because they're preaching it a virgin shall conceive unto us a son is born that's the scriptures but when the angel hallelujah hallelujah appear to Mary highly favor God is with the watch this she had one question how shall these things be and the angel said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and when the angel finish with Mary she's no longer hearing it she always heard it's different now she said be it done unto me Hallelujah I sat in church i t with everybody but I know realize this thing is talking about be it done unto me according to Thy word oh I trust tonight that this will help you in your Christian walk you will get an inspiration ration get a personal connection with your scriptures say be it done unto me as the pastor come and put the word up
