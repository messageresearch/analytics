I preach four messages there. Making the prophetic vision of the end time plane, the open book of our redemptive rights, the finishing of the seventh seal, and another time of jubilee, then judgment. And for the very first service, the spirit broke through. It's quite something to see. Um they have the sisters on one side, brothers on one side and you know to see the spirit just broke through the from the very sur from the very service very first service was quite an experience and the people were expecting they got much more people than what they expected as far as from Nepal some people 3,000 miles away. It was a tremendous victory for the honor and glory of God and we thank God for that. [applause] I thank you for your prayer. I actually burnt out the translators. There was two of them. They had no voice when they finished. I had my voice, but those guys were burnt out. But um I wouldn't say I say this way. I felt strong like a ox when I was finished. [laughter] So I thank God. I know it's your prayers of the saints. You been prayer. I appreciate that. And um I have some other meetings ahead of me. uh flying out this uh uh Wednesday uh to to to France and then Germany and then Lagos and then to the Nigeria. So we have some some things ahead of us. So I trust then that the Lord you're being kept. I feel good to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; I feel good to be alive where I could give God praise and worship. And I'm looking to see the power of God break through &gt;&gt; because the brother Brandham prophesied and say what we see should make a church that would make a revival that people would say something broke out &gt;&gt; or we have been talking preaching sharing teaching for years but he's not talking about that he's talking about something breakout &gt;&gt; hallelujah God is not going to leave the bride's tail you know we're not going to leave here ordinary you know bye-bye we leaving the neighbor it's not going to work so you know this bride will be on display God will display himself. Even if you do want it, God will point you out. This this here is my son. This here is my daughter. &gt;&gt; You and and you will know you. Don't touch God's anointed. Do his prophets no harm. Don't touch God's people. Don't interfere with them. Not in this hour. You wait too long to to face Satan in this battle. This end time bride is God's woman. This end time bride is a bride. The bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. May not feel like that. It's not going by feelings. You're not going by emotions. And Lord, help me tonight. Praise God. This thing is certainly not your feelings and your emotions. This have to do with the word. There's the only way the bride will not be deceived because she is not going to be part of the word. She's going to be the word itself. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Do you get that this morning? The only way the bride will not be deceived, she will be the word itself. The church is part of the word. The church believe part of the word, but the bride receive and believe all of the word. Oh, give the Lord some praises. That's the difference between the elected and the rest. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And this great battle we talking about is about to begin. &gt;&gt; I told him in in in Miami, war is coming. And I come to tell you this morning, war is coming. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Prepare for it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for what the Lord will do among us this morning. And there's a great thing to come and a great expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you know after the meetings in in in um in in India the people have to head back to the trains, head back to the homes is quite a responsibility and you know it's different from what we might know convention wise. They have to feed the people. You have to come and they have to have the setup and everything else. It's not like you have to have everything just smooth and whatn not. They have to have set up. They have to plan for it and execute it well and to see how the Lord had worked so powerfully. I just just thankful to God for the experience of those brethren. This is the third time I'm going to the Punjab area that that particular place. So this morning I have one scripture to read for you as we stand. 1 Corinthians 14 we want to read from verse 1 to 8. 1 Corinthians 14 if you have Bibles verse 1 to8. Follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy. For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God. For no man understandeth him, how be it in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. But he that prophesieth speaketh unto all men to edification and exhaltation and comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edified himself, but he that prophesied edified the church. I would that ye all speak with tongues, but rather that he prophesied. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret that the church may receive edifying. Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you? Except I shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine. And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harped, except they give a distinction in the songs, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? But if the trumpet given and sitting sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? Let's have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. May you come among us and interpret it. Father, we living in dangerous time. We're living in a peculiar time. We live in a time Lord where your word is about to fulfill and manifest among your elect people. Grant Lord that the word made plain this morning to your people. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be seated. And as you sit down, give God some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, [cheering] when you come to church here, you come here to worship. &gt;&gt; You ain't come here sit down and just take notes or sit down. No, you're coming here to worship. Your number one job is to worship. That's how you fight this battle. That's part of the fighting of the battle. Praise God. You have to worship God. Praise your hand. Say amen. Say glory to God. Praise God. Just as people go to football and all. Yes. And the team and goal and whatn not. When you come here, you come here to praise God and worship. Your job is to worship. Your job is not to study your problems and your build and what going to happen tomorrow. No, you don't know if what you do now healing come to your house. If what you do now, deliverance come to your house. If what you do now, breakthrough come to your house. You do what you're supposed to do in the house of God. You do what you're supposed to do now. If your husband get in trouble, if your wife get in trouble, if your children give in trouble, whoever get in trouble, don't bother about that trouble this morning. You are here to worship God. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. God could make a way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. Praise God. That woman came to Jesus and and talking about my daughter is vex with the devil. The daughter was not there. She was standing there. Hallelujah. My daughter is vexed with the devil. He says not fit to take the children's bread and casting the door. She stood her grounds. She said I am moving. I ain't going nowhere. You have the answer to my problem. You could deliver. I know you have the power to deliver. You can give a breakthrough. I heard you open the Red Sea. I heard you because the blind eye to see. I heard YOU DID THIS, THAT, and the other. And if they could do it for them, they could do it for me. Well, give the Lord a praise this morning. That's the kind of attitude you want to have. If you do it for them, you could do it for me. If you do it for that brother, you could do it for me. If you do for that sister, you could do it for me. You could do it for my children. You could do it for my body. Oh, I heard YOU HEAL CANCER. YOU COULD HEAL CANCER THIS MORNING. I heard deliver from tumor and leukem from prison and from HEARTACHE AND FROM ALL KIND OF THINGS. I HEARD YOU'RE A DELIVERER. WELL, give the Lord a shout in the house. That's when you're claiming the promises. That's when you're believing what God have said. Glory. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated. You have to be willing to put your emotions off the line and put your belief and faith on the line and say, "God, you said so. You promised and you can't lie." If you said, "If I walk, you will bless. If I praise God," you understand what I'm saying? You're reminding God of what he promised. That is pleading the promise. God, you promise me victory. Fix you over the world. Fix you over the lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh and the pride of life. You promise me deliverance. You promise me a breakthrough. You promise I the Lord thy God THAT HEAL THEE. ARE YOU A HEALER? LORD, I'M SICK IN MY BODY AND I NEED A SUPERNATURAL TOUCH. LORD, I HAVE FIBROIDS. LORD, I HAVE THIS. I HAVE THAT. I have headache.

UH FINANCIAL TROUBLE, HE COULD DEAL WITH THAT TOO. That you could pay your taxes. He said go catch a fish. He could deal with that too. He could deal with whatever problem. BUT THERE'S LAWYER PROBLEM, DOCTOR PROBLEM, MONEY PROBLEM, FAMILY PROBLEM, WHATEVER PROBLEM, SCHOOL PROBLEM, [screaming] WHATEVER SITUATION IN YOUR LIFE, HE COULD DEAL WITH THAT THIS MORNING, NOT TOMORROW, THIS MORNING. BECAUSE NOW FAITH IS come to preach you out of your foolishness. We come to PREACH YOU OUT OF DARKNESS. WE COME TO PREACH YOU OUT THE UNBELIEF AND TO PREACH YOU INTO THE LIGHT. OH, THIS GOSPEL GOING TO BE PREACHED AND THEN THE END SHALL COME. OH, CAN THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN, brother Blackman. Now be seated. &gt;&gt; I didn't say it. Jesus said it. You shall hear wars and rules of wars, &gt;&gt; but not yet. &gt;&gt; The end IS NOT YET. NATION SHALL RISE UP AGAINST NATION. NOT YET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE SHALL BE PESTILENCES AND STORMS AND EARTHQUAKES. NOT YET. BUT THIS GOSPEL [screaming] SHALL BE PREACHED AND THEN THE END SHALL COME. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME SHOUTS IN THE HOUSE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; May be seated. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Do you see how a man emotions could move him? &gt;&gt; That president of America, anything that pass here, he see and what not he moving. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He acting he here, he see &gt;&gt; and they could show the wrong thing to him. &gt;&gt; God don't move by feelings and emotions. &gt;&gt; So day before yesterday when I hear about bombs going to fall just now and people all the gas station full up with cars and groceries. What foolish is this? We going inside. I want to get some gas for my vehicle. I could get see light and nothing that foolish you know. I going back home. Next morning I come there, it gets empty. &gt;&gt; People thinking all kind of think in the heading for &gt;&gt; hearts feeling for fear. &gt;&gt; If the missile will come across here, &gt;&gt; they don't know what kind of defense we have. What defense we have? &gt;&gt; They don't know about our army. What army we have? &gt;&gt; That's why we had to be underneath the blood. You know, &gt;&gt; God have to be our protector. &gt;&gt; David said 10,000 fall on the right side. &gt;&gt; I shall not be. David say, "Oh God, I go hide." David say, "I'm going to duck." He said, "Oh, 10,000 fall on my right side. I shall not be moved." This this message people faith hasn't been challenged as yet. You know, &gt;&gt; they have been sitting in benches and churches and thinking that it's bright thing for years includ lost his wife. &gt;&gt; He lost the anointing. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; He lost his baby. &gt;&gt; And he was a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the floodsaving people and his family was dying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he had to serve God still. &gt;&gt; And the devil coming to whisper in his ears, look at you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You're serving him all these years. &gt;&gt; Your wife going to die, you know. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He's praying for the sick and people are being healed. &gt;&gt; But his wife going to die, you know. &gt;&gt; Daughter going to die, too. The devil whispering you see and he say he love you and he said see he say he with you &gt;&gt; that devil not easy you know &gt;&gt; pumping in the prophet ears and as he almost given something something b out of him &gt;&gt; the Lord give and the Lord take it away blessed be the oh don't let the devil take your [music] praise DON'T LET DON'T LET THE DEVIL TAKE [screaming] YOUR PRAISE DO I HEAR A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE THIS MORNING? [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK GOD DOESN'T KNOW THE PRESSURE YOU UNDER? [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK GOD DOESN'T KNOW THE STRESS YOU UNDER, &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR feelings mustn't put ahead of God. &gt;&gt; Put faith ahead of your feelings and give God praises because he is worthy of praise. How about say write the vision and make it plain. There's a reason for that. &gt;&gt; There's a reason when we have clarity. &gt;&gt; That is the that is why I say make it plain. &gt;&gt; When things are made plain, you could act. You could act decisively. &gt;&gt; You could act with purpose. Is when we are not sure, we get this. You know, I wonder if I wonder if God don't want a wondering. &gt;&gt; He want your mind to be clear. Hallelujah. Praise God. When God spoke to Joshua, Joshua instructed the elders and the whole congregation. 3 days we are crossing over. &gt;&gt; Prepare yourselves. &gt;&gt; We are crossing Jordan. &gt;&gt; Nice elders, nice brothers. Come and tell Joshua if you wait a month um the water will go down. He said three days. &gt;&gt; Joshua know what going on? No. &gt;&gt; God told him three days &gt;&gt; and he speak what God spoke. &gt;&gt; Three days. The Levites with the ark on their shoulder. They know that to cross Jordan. They're not waiting for boat. They're not waiting for yacht or ship. They have to cross. &gt;&gt; They be hide. They have the ark in their hand and they walking towards Jordan. &gt;&gt; They don't know how it going to open, but they go in. &gt;&gt; Do you do you understand what faith does? &gt;&gt; If you're feeling fear, you would not go. THERE'S GUYS WALKING. AS SOON AS TOUCH JORDAN, &gt;&gt; Jordan open up. Some of you am moving. You're watching to see who raising their hands. DON'T WATCH NOBODY. YOU RAISE YOUR OWN HANDS. [cheering] Some of you looking to see who praising God. Don't watch nobody. Are you PRAISING GOD? YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH for yourself. DON'T BE NO DUMB DOG in Israel. You have to open your mouth AND SPEAK. YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND CLAIM. You have to open your mouth AND ASK, ASK FOR RAIN IN A TIME OF RAIN. OH, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS HAVE NO ROOM FOR the weak. You know &gt;&gt; the weak begging. The weak don't want to. No. The Bible SAID LIKE THE WEAK SAY &gt;&gt; I AM STRONG. GIVE THE LORD SOME SHOUTS IN THE HOUSE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't want to ask. I don't want to bother God. What kind of foolishness is that? You think God is a man? &gt;&gt; How many you don't want to bother God? &gt;&gt; Let God remind God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you asked yesterday and you're coming back today. And if he don't give it today, his tomorrow he [laughter] here again. Let burn his ears. Oh, give the Lord some praise. Look, people don't want to say amen, BROTHER GEORGE. BURN HIS EARS. SAY IT'S ME AGAIN. CALLING UPON YOU. GOD, GIVE ME STRENGTH. GOD, HELP ME. OH GOD, YOU PROMISE to help the weary. Oh God, EVEN YOUNG MEN SHALL FAINT AND UTTERLY FALL. BUT THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD SHALL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH. THEY SHALL MOUNT RINGS OF EAGLES. COME ON YOU EAGLES. Come on now. You want your strength to be renewed. YOU WANT A REVIVAL IN YOUR SOUL. YOU WANT WINGS, wind under your wings. Oh, give the Lord some praises. OH, HELP ME THIS MORNING. YOU WANT SOME WIND UNDER YOUR WINGS, THAT YOU COULD FLY, THAT YOU COULD SOAR, THAT YOU COULD BREAK BARRIERS AND BREAK BANDS THIS MORNING. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO DO. HALLELUJAH. HELP YOU BUST THAT LIMITATIONS AROUND YOUR LIFE, ALL THE HINDRANCES AROUND YOU TO BREAK it out. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; For if the trumpet given and sitting sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle? The question asked, who going to prepare the self? &gt;&gt; Church, remember the comfort that people some people don't like to change because they like themselves? They in love. Bible said that in the last days people shall be lovers of themselves. When they look in the mirror, I like me. &gt;&gt; I'm in love with me. &gt;&gt; Bible talk about that. Because see if you hate yourself &gt;&gt; you want to change &gt;&gt; when you look you don't like what you see &gt;&gt; but you see this is what you call the default position default status your normal status now we were born in sin in it &gt;&gt; and shapen iniquity in it &gt;&gt; no nonrighteous no not one &gt;&gt; so when God called us out he called us out to infect and affect our lives Amen. &gt;&gt; That change could begin. &gt;&gt; You're not changing overnight, &gt;&gt; but change could be to begin. &gt;&gt; A little light that could grow inside of you. &gt;&gt; As you allow it to grow. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; A LITTLE LIGHT TO COME INSIDE OF YOU. AND AS YOU ALLOW it to grow, it grows. &gt;&gt; The more you get rid of you, the more it expands. &gt;&gt; And you get more reflected of God through you and by you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. And we said and we said Friday that the battle didn't start on earth. It started in heaven. &gt;&gt; When Michael and Lucifer fought &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the battle dropped down upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And the battle of angels became the battle of men. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So when you see Russia fighting this one and that one is spirits, &gt;&gt; his demon powers, his principalities, his territorial spirits. I want your land. I want your property. And that's how the devil feel about you and about here on the earth. But earth wasn't made for the devil. Hell and fire was made for the devil and his angels. He got kicked out and he fell on the earth. But earth belong to the sons and daughters of God. And because Adam fell, an avenue opened up for demon powers to rage upon the earth. But God is raising up sons to take us back. We're going back to the original. We're going back to what God called us to do and raises up to do. We're going back because the book has been restored. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the battle of angels had become the battle of men and the human mind was given for the battle to rage. So that's why you have thoughts. That's why thinking and thoughts and fighting and battles inside. Is that that mind of yours? &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So the battle wrong is a human mind with five senses. Memory, affection, conscience, reason and imagination. &gt;&gt; A battle of fate, revelation versus reasoning from the mind. &gt;&gt; Lucifer uses human reasoning. That is why when Sarah tell Abraham to go with Hagar, that was reasoning &gt;&gt; because Sarah didn't believe for herself &gt;&gt; because Sarah didn't have a revelation. &gt;&gt; And that what we see now is the results of unbelief &gt;&gt; that we have a whole set of people &gt;&gt; that different &gt;&gt; and it's still family to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Faith versus doubt. &gt;&gt; Revelation versus reasoning. The greatest battle ever fought is going on right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Between life and death, between sickness and health, between faith and doubt, between liberty and bondage. And Paul exhorted us to put on the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let America do they do? They have to do they do. Who can make war with the beast? &gt;&gt; And God take a pope out of America, &gt;&gt; put him right in the Vatican. &gt;&gt; So they have an American man across the Vatican. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; He is the head of Rome. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Americano. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Now, &gt;&gt; Russia, I want to say this for the benefit of the veterans and so forth and you Bible students. What you fussing and hing about Russia? You don't hear me telling you to build bombshelter, do you? What are you fussing about Russia? Russia ain't nothing. &gt;&gt; They ain't going to win no wars. &gt;&gt; They ain't going to conquer no world. Communism isn't going to conquer no world. &gt;&gt; God's word can fail. Listen this on tape now to the world I speak. Wherever these tapes may go and to you people here, no matter what happens to me, you believe this. Russia, communism isn't going to conquer nothing. God's word can't fail. Romanism is going to conquer the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romanism, &gt;&gt; the spirit of Rome, &gt;&gt; most powerful empire that was ever on the earth. &gt;&gt; Built roads, armies, this thing called Rome. And Rome, physical Rome, switched to papa Rome. &gt;&gt; A lot of these big guys and billionaires, they are Roman Catholic. &gt;&gt; The spirit upon them. &gt;&gt; Notice who is controlling the media. &gt;&gt; Who's controlling WhatsApp, Tik Tok, &gt;&gt; who's controlling all Facebook and all these things. It's the billionaires. There's not no man in his shop around the corner. &gt;&gt; They controlling technology. &gt;&gt; My god. And I just discovered a next company called Palanteer. Do you understand what they were doing? But they collecting information on everybody. &gt;&gt; Not just in America, but around the whole world. &gt;&gt; This man, man called Peter Teal. H Satan. That's why they call it AI right now. Artificial intelligence. But the bride would not have artificial. &gt;&gt; The bride will have the intelligence of God. &gt;&gt; Because to outdo these guys, you would need the intelligence of God, which is the mind of Christ. Give the Lord a shout in the house. Ride with me this morning. The prophet was the seer or the eyes. He said there was no moving faculty past the eyes. He said the next indeed is the intelligence &gt;&gt; that God will reveal what to do with his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is the intelligence. &gt;&gt; The intelligence is what led Jesus to pick up the scripture and say the spirit is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good tidings and so forth. Held open the eyes of the blind. The intelligence tell him move now and read the scripture. And then he said this day the scripture is fulfilling your ear. You're going to live to see it young people. You're going to live to see this word manifested. God will not leave this earth without a witness. God had TAKEN OUT THIS BRIDE WITHOUT A WITNESS. THERE HAS TO BE A CLEAR witness of this bride. The battle is about to begin. Oh, glory to God. You see the rise of the false anointed yet. YOU SEE CHURCH MEMBERS FIGHTING THE BRIDE YET. Understand this. Before they crucify Jesus, the the the church members had to come against the Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus manifested &gt;&gt; forced the PHARISEES AND THE SCRIBE and the Sadducees to form the SAHIAN COUNCIL. &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT FORC IT? The Jesus &gt;&gt; or let's say it this way the word manifested. &gt;&gt; Forced them TO COME TOGETHER TO FIGHT the word before the government could come down on Jesus. Remember the the the religious people is what arrest what corner Jesus &gt;&gt; and then the government come AFTER THAT. THIS BRIDE will be THE REJECTED. THIS BRIDE will be Joseph. &gt;&gt; OH COME ON PREACH back to me somebody. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you understand what I'm saying? SO I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THE BATTLE IS NOT YET. WHEN DYNAMIC STRIKE THE BATTLE BEGINS. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. RIGHT NOW WE IN A BATTLE BUT A BIGGER BATTLE coming brother. Oh give the Lord some praises. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. The dynamic is nearer than when you first believe. This Holy Ghost power, this Holy Ghost anointing, IT IS NEARER than when you first believe. It is coming. Coming. Coming. Get ready for it. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. IT'S COMING. DON'T BACKSLIDE. DON'T give up. DON'T LET GO. DON'T STAY HOME. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. This thing is coming. Hallelujah. But Brandham, don't worry about Russia. Russia is a small pebble on the beach. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about communism. You watch Romanism when it's united with the churches. &gt;&gt; There is nothing written in the scripture about communism ruling the world. And I go by the word regardless of what anything else goes. It's the word. I believe it is Romanism that will take the world. And Romanism is the mother of organization. There never was an organization till Rome and every one of them come out of it. She was the mother of harlots. &gt;&gt; She was the mystery Babylon, prostitute Babylon. And she had daughters. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The mother of harlots. I could stay in it half a day. All right. Let's take Daniel vision. Thou Daniel, thou king Nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold. Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another kingdom will succeed which is silver which was me and Persia. &gt;&gt; Another one was Greece, Alexander the Great. Next coming Rome and there was nothing said about communism. Rome conquered the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was born in the Roman kingdom and persecuted. His first time come here was by Roman kingdom. On his second advent coming now, his message is persecuted by the Roman denominations which is the mother of all of them. And when he returns, he will come back to wipe out that Roman kingdom. &gt;&gt; And the Jews has always looked up for him to come and wipe out the Roman kingdom. The Catholic hierarchy with all the denominations in the world right now coming together as an organization, the confederation of churches organizing themselves together. It isn't Russia, &gt;&gt; it is Rome. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; That's why he said the devil coming down in his dynamics on in the under the opaces of United Nations will enforce the laws. &gt;&gt; That's how they going to close down the churches. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Under the opaces of the United Nations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet say when the press come down, &gt;&gt; watch your third pull then &gt;&gt; because they're going to press you out. &gt;&gt; So people think in having churches and in the message and whatn not that going to be it that they don't even know what's coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's somebody had a dream when press come people to burn this book with books. They no longer want to be identified with this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You understand? It's one thing to say you believe it. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Let me just talk a little bit. &gt;&gt; Peter believed to him. &gt;&gt; But when they see it start to be Jesus, they &gt;&gt; Peter start to believe a little differently. &gt;&gt; He believed, you know, but &gt;&gt; is licks passing, you know, &gt;&gt; is that the Messiah? Get any man in charge there you know &gt;&gt; and the guy licks &gt;&gt; and they hold him &gt;&gt; and somebody say hey you one of you boys see your grand service &gt;&gt; said no not me at all I was not there I was not there man &gt;&gt; Peter denied the first one &gt;&gt; but if he sure next say yes boy you looking like I see your hair cut &gt;&gt; you're looking like one them see no ears no see He said, "No, it's not me." But the third one who tells this and not he's not he people following Jesus will cuss. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter had to cry and weep. &gt;&gt; You see it's a difference when a pig fall in the mud ped &gt;&gt; and a sheep falling in mud. &gt;&gt; It's two different thing. &gt;&gt; When a pig hit the mud when you see he was in the house all the time. He never got out yet. He had the bow tie and thing inside the house. When he get when he master leave open my chance and he fall in the mud he I mean he he and the mud is one &gt;&gt; he's very comfort you know you know crying there &gt;&gt; he at home with the mud &gt;&gt; when the sheep fall in the mud is bad &gt;&gt; the sheep crying &gt;&gt; and when you fall in the mud if you are sheep &gt;&gt; you're going to cry because THEY WANT TO GET out &gt;&gt; they want to get out that cancer stuff they want to get out that horrible stuff oh give the Lord some praise says it's one thing to say you believe but when drama starts is how much you really believe. Peter wept and Jesus still went and find them. &gt;&gt; When Peter said I go fishing, he's a leader. You know &gt;&gt; people following the leader. &gt;&gt; They say we go fishing too. Three and a half years no fishing but Jesus not around. &gt;&gt; When when you see like the Holy Ghost not around or feel the Holy Ghost not around or feel this one not around. You do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; You go back to default. You go back into your normal positioning. &gt;&gt; Jesus found him. Try and have you any meat. &gt;&gt; They're fishing all night. Jesus. We fish all night and caught nothing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Watch these words &gt;&gt; day by experience. No, it's all night. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Cast your net to the right side. Words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if they go my feelings? Oh god, I tired. But something tell them obey that voice. &gt;&gt; And when they cast your net, they get help &gt;&gt; because a voice tell them cast your net. I don't care how long you're fishing. &gt;&gt; If Jesus say cast your net to the right side, &gt;&gt; you're going to get what you're supposed to get. We have too much of unbelief. Give the Lord some praises. You have to let go your feelings and let go your emotions and let go your tears and let go your fears AND LET GO ALL THIS THING AND LET YOUR FAITH THROW OUT. COME ON, PREACH BACK TO ME SOMEBODY. Let your faith throw out. God could give you house car land. God could give you God could bless you. Your cup could run over. Oh, give the Lord a shout. You don't even have to have what's inside your cup. YOUR CUP COULD GET go be pouring or you say David say my cup run it over. Surely goodness and mercy SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY BLIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY DOWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY LOW. LET IT BREAK OUT. BUST THROUGH. BREAK OUT. HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE LORD some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. I would never let this message world limit me. That's what people do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People try to out your dream or out your vision. That's why sometime they can't even tell people your stuff &gt;&gt; cuz the spirit upon them want to bind you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not saying go BOY, GO BOY, RIDE, RIDE, RIDE. NO, THEY KEEPING a stable &gt;&gt; as if the growing horse inside of there. &gt;&gt; The horse was made to run. &gt;&gt; Just ship was made to steal. Ship wasn't made to be by the sh. I didn't want to sink. I ain't flowing no way. They said get a car. &gt;&gt; You get that? &gt;&gt; A ship was made to sail the sea. &gt;&gt; A ship ain't going out. You see storm. You see you see the waves. So where you want to go? Ship was float on land. You want to put wheels on the ship. &gt;&gt; Ship was built to sail. &gt;&gt; Eagles was built to fly. &gt;&gt; Chicken was built to scratch. &gt;&gt; So you could scratch if you want &gt;&gt; or you could fly if you want. And on this flight there is no red light stopping you and turn to the right and turns up. You fly where you want to fly. You go where you want to go. You go down in prayer. You go up in praise. You go down in the word. Nobody can hinder you getting revelation, inspiration. Nobody can bust up your blessing. Praise God. You come here anointed. You come here inspired. YOU COME HERE WITH FIRE OVER YOU. OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE ANGEL WITH YOU. Give the LORD SOME PRAISES. GLORY TO GOD. ONE IS A MAJORITY IN GOD. YOU COULD SAY, "GOD, I'M A MAJORITY BECAUSE I AM CALLING UPON YOU. IF NOBODY IS CALLING, I'M CALLING. IF NOBODY IS ASKING, I AM ASKING. IF NOBODY'S BELIEVING, I AM BELIEVING." COME ON NOW. IF NOBODY IS KNOCKING, I AM KNOCKING THIS MORNING. IF YOU KNOCK, THE DOOR SHALL BE OPEN. IF YOU SEEK, YOU SHALL FIND. COME ON NOW. IF YOU ASK, IT SHALL BE GIVEN. GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES this morning. Glory to God. You can sit there in your stinking rotten unbelief as if God is dead. AS IF GOD CAN'T make a way. AS IF GOD CAN OPEN UP THE RED SEA FOR YOU. OH, glory to God. He is still a way maker. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I don't want you saying he's a way maker and you don't believe that because your action is reflecting. You don't really believe he's a way maker &gt;&gt; because you want to make your own way. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's dust says the Lord. Praise God. Now watch. Now they found out recently that your body is full of light. X-ray proves that the X-ray does not have any light of its own. It's your light that it uses. You are born with four rays. This is deep. After a little while, say 20, 25, one ray goes out. 35, another. 40, another one goes out. And finally, when you get past 65, you're living on your last ray. And every time you take an X-ray picture, you're tearing them rays down. And that's the reason you stick those feet uh kids feet in them machines and just tearing the rays right out of little bodies. That is cosmic light that is in you. You are made up of full of light cells. That is cosmic light. God is a different light &gt;&gt; and yet he is light. And I think of the picture here as a proof of what I'm fixing to say that God is light. And when we were walking in the light of God as sons of God, God is not cosmic light. But God's life operated through the cosmic light of our bodies and our cells. So as a human being, we have cosmic light. God light is different. And God light could work through the light that he put in us. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He said now and then the fall came. Okay. Not read but God's life operates through the cosmic light of our bodies, ourselves and we become we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God. &gt;&gt; Then the fall came and then here we go. When the fruit of the spirit today is love, joy, faith, longsuffering, meekness, gentleness, patience, all supernatural. &gt;&gt; So these things on the pyramid that people take very lightly at your feet, virtue, knowledge, they think there's a board, you know, that just things just written there, you know, but these qualities are supernatural. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; These virtues are actually supernatural. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, watch. It's got to a spot to where all the whole body like a seaweed, right? You get in the bottom of the sea. Lots of time divers, they get under the seaweed and before they know it, they're wrapped in such a way they can't get out of it. Well, that's the way sin has done to the human being. That's the way, here we go, coldness has done to the church. That's the way communist has done to the nation. It is so treacherous. Then in the human body, it wrapped us and is pushing out this light of God by denominations and denying faith and so forth. It is pushed out all the rays of God's great power of faith that's in us. That should be he pushed all those rays out in such a place till we got a lodge. And now below the lodge, the church cause it just push all the darkness. He said this doesn't happen. Denying it could happen. The miracles of God. Here we go. Listen. Yet the man somewhere down in him, somewhere in him, if I'll illustrate it like a button. Here we go. When a man is saved, that much of him is God, that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what is wrong. &gt;&gt; So when you give the life to Jesus Christ, you get baptized in Jesus name, you have an experience with God, a little light coming to you. &gt;&gt; That light is what make you stop going to baptis dance. That light is make you give up cigarette and smoke. That light something happened inside of you. &gt;&gt; It's a little light like a button. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; That little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong. Now, are you ready? Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out, that little buttonlike of the light and the power of God will keep growing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God give you a start, &gt;&gt; a light. I can give you a scripture. It's a familiar scripture. As many as receive him, to them give he &gt;&gt; power to become. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you an instant son, but you get the start. You have faith. God give you a start. He give you virtue which is power to add the rest of the life. Knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness. And then you can't get closer to God. When you say you want to get uh nearer to God, he starts you with faith. &gt;&gt; When you get virtue, you're getting nearer. Oh God, I want more of you. Give you knowledge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, I need you more. He give you temperance and patience. You're getting closer to him. And after a while, you can't get any closer. You become one with him. Then the spirit is upon you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a shout in the house. Then you're mature. You are ready to be positionally placed as a son that God could identify himself with you. So it's no longer you identify yourself with him. Is now he identify himself with you. Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THIS is our promise. Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT in the house. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PASTOR OR THE PREACHER or elder or a deacon. We're talking about you. &gt;&gt; God identifying himself with you. &gt;&gt; You remember Elijah and Elisha. &gt;&gt; When Elijah cross over and he get the mantle and he hit him and soo the mantle from only have a camera take a picture &gt;&gt; but that can't get him across you know &gt;&gt; taking pictures of getting him across. You know &gt;&gt; he have no boat to build to go. Elijah walked across &gt;&gt; Jordan &gt;&gt; on dry ground &gt;&gt; and now he left and gone. &gt;&gt; Here is a young man with the mantle on him. All of a sudden you get a revelation. It's not the mantle. &gt;&gt; It's the God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; It's not the mantle. It's not the books. It's not the tapes. It's the God of the books and tapes. OH, GIVE THE GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. AND WHEN THAT YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZED THAT, HE TOOK THE MAN AND SAID, "WHERE IS THE LORD GOD OF ELIJAH?" AND WHEN HE STRUCK THE JORDAN, JORDAN KNOW WHAT TO DO when a SON COMING THROUGH. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. JORDAN KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHEN A SON IS COMING THROUGH, &gt;&gt; Jordan open up. &gt;&gt; And when all them school of the prophets LOOKING A FAR OFF, WHEN THEY LOOKING AT IT SO AND HE COME THROUGH, THEY SAY THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH, GOD REST upon Elisha. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS THEY WILL SAY THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS UPON THE BRIDE OF Jesus Christ. Okay. THE LORD A SHOUT DOING THE SAME WORKS THAT THAT PROPHET DIDTH. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT'S THE SPIRIT OF Jesus coming upon the bride. &gt;&gt; I HAVE A SCRIPTURE. THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; SAY COME. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS THE BRIDE BECOMES THE WORD &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU NOW ARE BECOME THE VERY WORD ITSELF. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. NOT PART OF THE WORD, THE WORD ITSELF. OH, GIVE the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? &gt;&gt; The spirit &gt;&gt; comes to the word. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was the word. &gt;&gt; The word became flesh. &gt;&gt; And the spirit came to him &gt;&gt; and he said the spirit is upon me. &gt;&gt; I ain't know about nobody else. &gt;&gt; But I know what's upon me. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit &gt;&gt; that's upon me &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me. I didn't ANOINT MYSELF. HE OH, GET THE LORD SOME POWER. JESUS, A man of God, APPROVED BY GOD WITH SIGNS, WONDERS, AND MIRACLES among you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Therefore, you have to be under expectation for the spirit to come upon you. NOT LUTHER. COME ON NOW. NOT WESLEY. COME ON NOW. NOT THE PENTECOSTAL. NOT COME ON NOW. THE DYNAMIC ITSELF, &gt;&gt; the spirit itself. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; WHAT WE ARE PROMISED, the Pentecostal never had. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. &gt;&gt; What we are promised &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal never had. &gt;&gt; They had the birth that was to take into adoption. But they rejected the word &gt;&gt; which was the tutorship cuz any son that going to be adopted must be under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father. So they rejected the tutorship of the word. So what we were under for the past 50 plus years is the tutorship of the word. THAT TSHIP BRINGS DISCIPLINE. That discipline bring order. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE DON'T WANT DISCIPLINE. PEOPLE DON'T WANT ORDER. But God is a God of order. Oh give the Lord some praises in the house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God don't have no haphazard kingdom &gt;&gt; and neither does Satan. &gt;&gt; So when they was accusing Jesus of being the king of Belieab and Bub champion and whatnot and he cast no devil by the the prince of devils bleub he said that no kingdom &gt;&gt; any kingdom that's divided &gt;&gt; cannot stand. &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom cannot stand if it's divided. So he's showing that Satan Kim is not divided. He have principalities. &gt;&gt; He have powers. He have spiritual wickedness. He have a whole host of demons. All passing through Hollywood and sports. &gt;&gt; Didn't expect that one, did you? &gt;&gt; Was reading about a man who actually they want him to sell his soul to the devil to be in football. And he's one of them who turn it down &gt;&gt; man open say would you sell your soul &gt;&gt; to the devil do you take all them sports and whatn not all them uh heroes and whatnot it's not just heroes just so you know &gt;&gt; there is spirit power behind that because all these things break influences Satan is a see is not a comedian you know &gt;&gt; he not for entertainment you know he for destructional [cheering] Yeah. &gt;&gt; All in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; It's witchcraft. &gt;&gt; There's all kind of demonic activity. &gt;&gt; They in the realm of the spirit. &gt;&gt; How much time I heard about actors and whatnot. They will go in rooms and stay by yourself and whatnot to to channel the spirit of what they want to act. &gt;&gt; You're not acting like if it's a book um you know um go here and they talking talking. That's normal thing. But when they start, &gt;&gt; they actually in the spirit of the thing. &gt;&gt; That is why they get them Emmy and awards and so on. They manifest certain things. They channeling certain things. &gt;&gt; Spirits. &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil having a good time. &gt;&gt; With all these characters &gt;&gt; because because the spirit is harmless until it get a body to use. &gt;&gt; That's that's all them devils we talking about now. But the Holy Ghost is harmless &gt;&gt; until he gets somebody to use. &gt;&gt; So I was studying about the fall of Rome, &gt;&gt; how Rome fell, how R was entertaining the people with the gladiators and whatn not, keeping them entertained. &gt;&gt; And then giving them free grain &gt;&gt; so that they wouldn't question what is happening behind &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden ro money going down down down. First they had the gold and afterwards they they have half gold less gold and they have silver and half is not silver and the money lost value. Afterward was the car pays the soldiers so things went down economically spiritually and that was the collapse of Rome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Same thing happened with France. I didn't realize France was the biggest army in Europe. &gt;&gt; Same thing happened. &gt;&gt; Extend themselves. Money fell and everything collapsed. &gt;&gt; America is next. America in that right now. &gt;&gt; Super debt &gt;&gt; overextended by the army and whatn not. Money going to collapse. &gt;&gt; No longer the strength of the US dollar &gt;&gt; because they have to have a new system &gt;&gt; that you can't buy or sell &gt;&gt; unless you take the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; A new system have to be bured. So the old system have to die. &gt;&gt; So you are seeing a collapse of an empire that once was great and powerful. Not even China bing with them anymore. The rest of the world not even but they're losing ground every single day. The bride is different. &gt;&gt; So we know the devil cannot get stronger &gt;&gt; because the devil will all be the devil. &gt;&gt; But we can. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; You are in a position to get stronger. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO get stronger [cheering] &gt;&gt; because you in a position to receive revelation from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So watch &gt;&gt; if you can take that all the all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button light of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing and crowding out unbelief. And you don't do it by exaltation of body exercise. You do it by a sanctified You do it by a sanctified consecrated life that the Holy Spirit moves through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's how you do it by a sanctified consecrated life. The Holy Spirit will move through you and that's the thunder that going to shake the devil. Devil don't care about shout and dance and how holl and what not. What hurts the devil is to see a sanctified life. You can't touch that life. That's a channel of God that you becomes a channel of God through a channel. Praise God out here. Ma come evil and good. You can't cuss out and bless God bless you and then you cussing your neighbor here. How that's supposed to work? How do you say ma come these things? Because you become a channel of God. You are representing God. You're reflecting God. You become A GOD MAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU BECOME A GOD WOMAN. You're not ashamed OF THE GOSPEL. HALLELUJAH. JUST AS THE Muslim could cover from head to toe and only the only by the eyes you see in them. You're not ashamed of what you wear. You're not ashamed of how you look. You're not ashamed of who laugh at you. You're looking like a old woman. You're looking like some old this and old that. You're not ashamed of that. You're not competing with them. Praise God. Hallelujah. You're you're pleasing your father. You're pleasing your lord. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon was talking about um sick and praying and whatnot. If the devil says, "Hey, you know what? What you're feeling, don't even speak to him. Just keep going." The devil know the devil say but you know so and so when they got the Holy Ghost they almost lost their mind &gt;&gt; don't speak to him &gt;&gt; just keep on going &gt;&gt; if you and God that's right keep go he's anointed servants he said I got to hurry he said listen lady talking to lady now here we see the tactics of the devil so he's talking to a sick woman how do we do I've got a lot of scripture here in prophets and so on it's his tactic to try to get the people to disbelieve God's word. &gt;&gt; Listen you soldiers of the cross. When you disbelieve one word of God's written Bible, you are disarmed. &gt;&gt; In other words, to fight, you have to get the weapons. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible talk about put on the whole armor of God, press of righteousness, the sword of the spirit, the shield of faith and everything else. You have to have the armory to fight. But if the devil come and that sword you have there know that's a butter knife. See, let me show you. You see, you could take the butter here and put in the bread. &gt;&gt; And he make you think that your sword &gt;&gt; is like a butter knife. It's not effective. If you believe his words, &gt;&gt; you lost the power right there. &gt;&gt; See, Samson didn't catch it. He was covenanted with seven locks. &gt;&gt; Not 127 locks. Was a raster. &gt;&gt; Seven locks. &gt;&gt; And he was covenanted by that. That is what kept the power on him. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; When the tried to tell him this and he just tie me, I lose my power and he break. He laughing. He making fun. &gt;&gt; He's lying and laughing. &gt;&gt; My lord, &gt;&gt; you hear that? Amen. &gt;&gt; That servant, that son is lying and laughing &gt;&gt; and still have the power with him &gt;&gt; because he hasn't broke the covenant &gt;&gt; with God. He said, God says, "As long as you have them seven knocks, the power is with you." &gt;&gt; Do you know all kind of crazy stuff? You see, he's backsliding slowly. He's going backwards. &gt;&gt; He's not recognizing by discernment the devil upon that woman. &gt;&gt; You see, nice woman. &gt;&gt; She not from church. She not in church but she looking nice outside &gt;&gt; here recognize he is a future target &gt;&gt; to be killed &gt;&gt; to be destroyed to be wrecked &gt;&gt; he finds you looking good &gt;&gt; and the mother likes you too somebody give you know mother completely under the spirit &gt;&gt; family like her you know &gt;&gt; yeah the family deserve the devil behind that woman behind &gt;&gt; the devil behind that two feet walking there you know Are you nice and peaceful and no &gt;&gt; it is looking here now is later on is the danger &gt;&gt; that same woman have a force behind her &gt;&gt; that same woman have money behind her &gt;&gt; get his secret &gt;&gt; get his secret &gt;&gt; when she finished with him so &gt;&gt; and cut his locks because right now she break him &gt;&gt; the Bible says Samson shake himself like other times he custom shaking self the power hallelujah glory &gt;&gt; but then he recognized he's just another He didn't realize he was always another man. &gt;&gt; A normal man is the power of God was upon him. &gt;&gt; That made a difference. He thought he had it. &gt;&gt; He thought it was locked down. It was not. &gt;&gt; You have to stay with God. &gt;&gt; You have to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; You have to stay with the covenant &gt;&gt; and God will be with you. &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BUT ONCE A SON, always a son. And when they beat up Samson had enough licks to have enough sense in his head. Sometimes people to go through the stuff to get sense in their head &gt;&gt; because in front of them so and they acting stupid &gt;&gt; as we were saying acting moxy. &gt;&gt; It's in front of your face. &gt;&gt; You go through the pressure &gt;&gt; eyes out now. And anybody once more. &gt;&gt; The only reason he could say once more, he had it before. &gt;&gt; You can't say once more and you never had it. and he never tasted it. He tasted of the power of God. He tasted of the supernatural anointing. Therefore, he could say once more, "Release the power. RELEASE THE ANOINTING. RELEASE THE HOLY GHOST." OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. AND THE DYNAMICS OF THIS CHURCH WILL BE A REFILLING OF THE Holy Ghost. Going to fill you with power that you CAN SAY, "GIVE ME MORE, LORD. [screaming] MORE OIL IN MY LAMP TO KEEP ME BURNING." HALLELUJAH. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So brother Bam is talking to her sister. I understand the sister was on a wheelch on on a on a crutches and when he finished she came out of it. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how to pray for her. &gt;&gt; She overcome right on that crutches. &gt;&gt; On on on the um on what she was lying on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Little little lady, listen close." So he's speaking to her. the tactics of the devil. When you disbelieve one of God's word, written Bible, you're disarmed. Believe that, honey. You are disarmed. You surrender, you jellyfish. Put on the whole armor of God. We are in A BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AND TODAY, WE'RE IN A BATTLE. WE BATTEN for our young people. We are battling for our children. We are battling for the church. We are battling for revival. We are battling for retro. We are battling against dead spirits, morphia, sleepy spirits, unbelieving spirits, no praise demons. OH GIVE THE LORD A SH. WE FIGHTING ALL KIND OF SPIRITS. Oh give the Lord some praises. YOU LIKE YOU START TO WAKE UP NOW. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT. THE BOMBS GOING TO COME AND HIT YOU IF YOU DON'T FIGHT BACK. The Lord shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Defending, defending can't win no war. Your blocking, BLOCKING CAN'T WIN NO WAR. YOU HAVE TO GO ON THE ATTACK. &gt;&gt; Get the Lord. You see, you want to say amen BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFENDING TOO LONG. I WANT TO GET YOU out of YOUR DEFENSE POSITION AND GET INTO THE ATTACK POSITION. I AM COMING BACK FOR MY FAMILY. I AM COMING BACK FOR MY HUSBAND. I AM COMING BACK FOR MY WIFE. I AM COMING BACK FOR MY CHILDREN. I AM COMING BACK FOR MY HEALTH. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. I ACCEPT NO SICKNESS. OKAY. THE LORD I SHOUT I ACCEPTING I AM NOT ACCEPTING DEPRESSION. [cheering] Not accepting defeat [cheering] I'm not giving up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God have no retreat in him. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Be in a battle. &gt;&gt; What God said is true. Every man word is a lie. And as soon get you to listen to one thing like it's tactic or disarm. How many things? How many things did Eve have to listen to? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; Wasn't a whole Bible. The message is so difficult. What books I read? No, just one. &gt;&gt; She husband tell she we could eat everything but she's that tree. The day we eat we shall &gt;&gt; surely die. &gt;&gt; Satan don't know what God said. She asked Eve he's wise you know. You stupid devil. This devil have a degree. &gt;&gt; Come to Eve. What did God say? Because God not talking to me. He don't know what God say. She She excited. God said [laughter] &gt;&gt; she was talking too much. &gt;&gt; You have to know when to shut up. &gt;&gt; You have to know who you're talking to. &gt;&gt; Be yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping. She could have tell him wait till my husband come homeay. &gt;&gt; Oh no the devil's screwed. &gt;&gt; But she said God say we can have everything but that tree. Oh if we only eat that we shall surely die. He say he said that you shall not surely die. &gt;&gt; But you can't just say that alone. You have to give an offer. &gt;&gt; Devil don't tell him not just know &gt;&gt; if you shall not surely die. But God knows that if you eat, you shall have the knowledge of good and evil. He want to hide you from that. I'm here to reveal this mystery of the knowledge of good and evil. He's exciting evil. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; When he finished, but she was hooked, lying, hook and sinker &gt;&gt; for that lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Note everything man have is knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; Car very nice and whatnot. Bouncing people, killing people. Everything man make you could think about have some kind of flow in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever hear them advertisement for them pills have in America and whatn not &gt;&gt; for this disease and that disease and they talk fast know this will give you heartache sometime they have I think this makes my s blind you know they could check your doctor and think t and you know it's it's mindboggling they could get spinal problems and this problem and that problem and kidney problem what check and if when you take it you get the symptom consult your doctor after the They're making sure in other words don't say I didn't tell you every bill or everything man have it have some kind of corruption inside of it because there's the knowledge of good and evil. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house [applause] man. Wicked. You know them pharmaceutical companies wicked. You know tell my wife I want to take the pill but I have no faith in them. You know you see when I juicing the celery and the green apples and the green thing and thing and I have confidence in that. &gt;&gt; That's nature. I drink all of that and that charge me up. But them pill say pill. I have no faith in that. I just put you inside. I no believe in that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will give myself my own charge. &gt;&gt; So listen to brother Ramier now. &gt;&gt; How many things did Eve listen to? She was disarmed right then. What did the devil do? Swept right through her mind. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Into her spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And there she was perverted. &gt;&gt; See what the devil does. &gt;&gt; Mind spirit. What does God do? Mind spirit. When you come to church, what you're hearing? The word. &gt;&gt; The word trying to pierce through your mind into your spirit. And if you receive it willingly and inwardly, it have an effect upon you. &gt;&gt; Then you know you have to do something about it. God never sends his word and it's just like they eat like chewing gum. You chew it and you spit it out afterwards. No. When God send his word is for you to act on it. There's always something to act upon. &gt;&gt; Those lepers come to Jesus, Lord, help us and save us. And what he said, go shoot yourself to the priest. Yes. &gt;&gt; Act &gt;&gt; disobey. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew they was not going to reach the priest, but they was heading towards the priest. &gt;&gt; On their way, they were healed and one came back and worship. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TOLD THAT ONE, "Thy faith have made you whole." &gt;&gt; The others were healed by obedience. But this one had faith because faith is bringing into worship. &gt;&gt; Brother George, HOW THE CHURCHES IS DEAD AND THEY CLAIM TO HAVE REVELATION. THEY DON'T HAVE THE revelation that they claim they have. Because faith, which is revelation, brings you into worship. Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. COME ON, PREACH BACK TO ME, SOMEBODY. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE THAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR. FAITH IS A REVELATION OF WHAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR. IT'S REVEALED TO YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET, BUT YOU COULD PRAISE GOD IN ADVANCE FOR WHAT IS COMING. OH, GIVE THE Lord a shout in the house. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE REVELATION OF DAVID. THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. I SHALL NOT WANT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises. He is covering you this morning. Oh, the bed is over you this morning. HE'S A PROVIDER THIS MORNING. HE'S A PROTECTOR this morning. HE'S A WAY MAKER THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] GLORY TO GOD. IF THAT devil tell you can't GET A BREAKTHROUGH, THE DEVIL'S A LIAR. HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S A LIAR? EVERY TIME HE OPEN HIS MOUTH, HE CANNOT speak the truth because the TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM. OH, give the Lord SOME PRAISES. BUT GOD IS NOT A MAN THAT WOULD LIE. EVERY PROMISE HE SPEAKS, HE IS big enough TO KEEP IT. HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO FULFILL IT. HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO CONFIRM IT. HE SAID, "MY WORD SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO ME VOID. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; God's soldiers are commanded to put on the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon. He disarms you. Praise God. Sometime it switches to disbelieve your minister, not even reading what the word saying. Minister tell them all kind of things talking nice sounding good types. Minister playing prophet too revealing things because he seen it. So when he had a dream last night and whatn not I no prophet at all. God sent a prophet to take the burden for me to figure out nothing. I have nothing to figure out. God sent a prophet and the words are here from the book. &gt;&gt; They are spirit given words. &gt;&gt; His words spoke to the mouth of the prophet that a man shall live by bread alone but by every word that proceedth of the mouth of God and the mouth of God eyes are prophets. So if I say what the tape say or say what the prophets say, I am saying from the mouth of God. So you are hearing from God's mouth this morning. Oh give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. So when you disbelieve the word, you get disarmed. You have no weapon. SATAN HAVE YOUR FINISH. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH this morning and THEY ARE DISARMED. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. NO, THEY HAVE NO ammunition to fight the devil. But we have this morning. We are armed this morning. We are READY AND ARMED. WHO SHALL PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THE BATTLE. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY AND ARMED. OH, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's go. What does the spirit fight with? But let the mind that was in Christ, the Bible said, what kind of mind did he have? He stayed with the word. Stay with the word, the father's word, and defeat the enemy every time. &gt;&gt; Now, when the enemy attacks and try to say you got to do this and do that, what are you going to do? Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Now when you when watch watch when what you want to do then take the word. What is the word? The Bible said we read it for the spirit of the God is the word. Look here. Take on the helmet of salvation. The sword. The sword of the spirit. The sword of the spirit. What the spirit. Here we go. That comes through your mind and enters into you. And the sword of that spirit is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Question. What does the spirit fight with? I'm reading what he's asking. What does the spirit fight with? What does the Holy Spirit fight with? Sensations? &gt;&gt; Feelings? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; You say, "What does it fight with feeling?" No, the word. Let's say the word. &gt;&gt; And he make them say the word. &gt;&gt; The word of God, which is the spirit. &gt;&gt; So the spirit fights with the word. &gt;&gt; So if you're not in the word, how you going to fight &gt;&gt; with comic strip, with Hollywood, with some daily word? What? What what you going to fight with? You have to have the word to fight with. &gt;&gt; If Jesus didn't know it is written, the devil tell him and you know human being. &gt;&gt; There's a woman knowing Nambia. She was the first woman president of Nambia. She start off nice freeing all the the man who died before free all no she's a big dictator now. You see protest in the place. &gt;&gt; She start off real nice. First female of of Namibia or something. &gt;&gt; No want she out.

Let the spirit come into your heart. Open up your mind. Thy word is true. Now, you do this, sister. He's talking to the sister. Thy word is true. So, he's talking faith into her. &gt;&gt; She's lying down on the pallet and he is speaking faith into her. &gt;&gt; He's preaching and he's talking to her. He's preaching. He's talking to her. She's going to walk out of that cut that that that that cut. &gt;&gt; She said, "Brother, what does he do?" He said, "Now watch, Lord, I ain't going to pay any attention to how I feel. &gt;&gt; What anybody else says, &gt;&gt; I am stopping up. I am blowing out every one of my avenues. All the frustration and doubts &gt;&gt; are fed up. I can't take it no more." You in that spirit. You got to blow that out. I'm blowing out all of my avenues, all the frustration and doubts, unbelief I've ever had, every feeling I ever had, all the sickness I ever had, everything else I had. I'm blowing them all out.

I open up my heart and my mind say, "Come in, Lord Jesus." and grab the faith that sword of the spirit thus say the lord and he says scream hallelujah &gt;&gt; all this is a attitude he's talking about all this reframing your mind &gt;&gt; that you could have frustrated the depressed and this I don't have a boyfriend I don't have a girlfriend I don't have a this I don't have a car I don't have a land I don't have enough &gt;&gt; all you do have and you don't see what you have &gt;&gt; and what you have is more than what you don't have &gt;&gt; that's a big thing that's a big thing here now &gt;&gt; if you catch that what you have is bigger than what you don't have &gt;&gt; because what you have is faith And faith is the substance of what you're hoping for. Faith could make you speak another word. Oh, glory to God. Faith is powerful. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT? And God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. What? Grab the faith, the sword of the spirit. Thus sayith the Lord. Scream hallelujah. Then cut down every enemy in front of you. There it is. Cut every enemy. If a old spooky spirit make you feel feel or cut that away &gt;&gt; and our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength. &gt;&gt; Why you can't have joy? &gt;&gt; You want to have joy? &gt;&gt; There are some people [laughter] there's a brother know years ago anytime you see happy you always come to see somebody to take away that joy. &gt;&gt; It's like a spirit was upon him. Always come with some kind of story to out your joy. These are people to duck. You know, &gt;&gt; these people to avoid you. &gt;&gt; No, they have to duck. Seven people have to duck when they see them. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. People like vampires. You know, &gt;&gt; they suck your blood. &gt;&gt; They take your strength. Like somebody called me about somebody and some case and what I said, listen brother, I ain't putting on putting nobody monkey on my back. &gt;&gt; I have my own backpack. Some people come, you don't have your own backpack and they come to load you up. &gt;&gt; And some happy monkeys. &gt;&gt; Don't be a happy monkey. Taking on people probably problem you're not supposed to take on. &gt;&gt; Don't do that thinking that you're spiritually helping them, helping them. They're helping you. They helping, they having, they actually helping you to drag you down. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be in an environment where people pulling you down. &gt;&gt; You want to be in an environment when somebody helping you up.

The joy of the Lord is my strength. &gt;&gt; He said, "Get away from me." Whack. You cut him with the word. Whether it be a demon, whether it be an enemy, whether it be sickness, whether it be disease, whatever it is, take the word and pull it with a sword. If you whack it the first time, it don't seem to move. Whack it again. He said, "WHACK IT AGAIN. WHACK it again. Whack it until you chip a hole through like a chicken pipping itself out. An eagle pipel." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let me tell you something. It was 14 hours to fly from JFK to Delhi. 14 hours and 15 hours to fly back &gt;&gt; and you're in a plane. &gt;&gt; If you want to go, you go. &gt;&gt; But think about it. You think I can study the time and fly? I see 15 hours come to 30 minutes to land. At first it start off 15 hours from Delhi to JFK airport and you see 15 hours cut down cut down cut down until it's half an hour. Prepare yourself. The plane is about to land. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God.

We shall not all sleep. Hallelujah. There are some who are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet them in the air. There's a genuine rapture. There's a genuine millennium. There's a genuine wedding supper. And there's a genuine bride of Jesus Christ. Nothing will stop it. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I'm free this morning. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. 17 years I was when God called me and I add 50 years to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I I I ain't weary &gt;&gt; and I just as strong as where I first started out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. GOING DOWN TO THE WIRE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. Praise God. I'm going down to the wire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whack it. That's the soldier. Knock every enemy out. Boy, you are predestinated. What's What battle? There's only one certain song. That's the gospel. Prepare for the battle. What battle? The coming of the Lord. I'm about to finish. Prepare yourself for the battle now against evil. When evil bees be setting the people on every hand. Everything going wrong. Home life going wrong. United Nations failing and nations breaking. Atomic bombs are wrong. Home splitting up. Motherhood going low. Memor among the people. distrust among one another. What do you want to do? Prepare. Be certain. Prepare yourself for for THE BATTLE. WHAT BATTLE? The coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Matthew 24:24. They shall arise false Christ and false prophets. Shall shall show great signs and wonders in so much it shall if possible that shall deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; All this have to come here now. &gt;&gt; This part of the battle today. &gt;&gt; Amen. This also know 2 Timothy 3. Perilous time shall come. Men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient of parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truth breakers, false for accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure, lovers of God, having a form of godliness, church folks, &gt;&gt; but denying the power of thereof in the message mind you. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Pentecostal and baptism, Methodist, talking about message folks. Yes. &gt;&gt; Ever learning. Let me speak. For days these are the sort which creep in the houses and leave captive silly women &gt;&gt; laden with sins. Love them kind of characters. Let away with divers lost. Ever learning and never able come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Janice and Jambas with Moses so these resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate what? Concerning what? Concerning the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be made manifest unto all men as there also was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some time ago I read the scripture to you. Joel 3:10 said, "Beat your plowshares into swords." &gt;&gt; What you have in your gardening, you said bees into swords, &gt;&gt; your pruding hooks into spears, and let the weak say, &gt;&gt; "I am strong. &gt;&gt; I am strong." &gt;&gt; We about to close. &gt;&gt; Lucifer coming with two main attacks. one to try to get you, deceive you off the word &gt;&gt; because Eve was only a part of the word, part of Adam. But this pride will be the word itself. &gt;&gt; And number two, praise God, when the devil recognized he couldn't catch the pride, he will go after the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; like a roaring lion and judge them with three and a half tribulation period. &gt;&gt; That's the attack. &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil would lose the bride. The bride escaped the grip of the enemy and then the Bible said he declared war with the remnant of the woman's seed which is church members. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham watch Jesus said at this end time that the two spirit will be close together. He said this is the end time. Listen children, God have mercy upon us. He's I'm still reading. It's it would be even so real till it would deceive the very elected if possible. How are you going to how did we tell it in them days? He said now praise God. Now hear all this message when you listen to the tape even maybe I'm gone someday when the Lord is finished with me here on earth you'll refer back to this listen to my voice what I'm telling you. If he takes me before he's coming just remember I spoke to you in the name of the Lord. Notice it'll be so close it will deceive the very elected if it were possible to do the same signs and wonders. Praise God. So this battle praise God that the devil going to have going in with. Praise God. Matthew 24:24 that is their five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; False anointed ones. &gt;&gt; Their congregation will be 2 Timothy 3 &gt;&gt; 1-9. The five for ministry of the bride will be in Ephesians 4 &gt;&gt; and their congregation will be in second Peter 1 &gt;&gt; 4-7 &gt;&gt; faith and virtue and knowledge and so on. &gt;&gt; These two spirits will come to a clash &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to be very clear in this message &gt;&gt; a big CLASH IS COMING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD GOING TO SEPARATE RIGHT FROM WRONG, &gt;&gt; RIGHTEOUS from unrighteous. He called the foolish virgin the unrighteous. He going to separate the church from the bride. The bride that will be hewed out from the church &gt;&gt; and she'll be rejected. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. What happened to this? What is this bride about? She's a bride that is walking by revelation or by faith. &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and came. And Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it." So, it was revelation. He said, "What is faith?" Faith is something revealed to you that is not yet what you believe it will be. Faith is a revelation of the will of God. Isn't that right? So this bride will be walking by revelation. Not you hear what going on in this church. You hear what this pastor say and you're going back and forth and back tossed to and fro. That's not revelation. Revelation when God speaks to you. Not when you get something on WhatsApp. Not when you get something on Tik Tok. Praise God. I want to go back to something I was saying. Didn't finish. Now come back to my mind. In Rome they were giving people free grain and entertainment. And I write a man was saying that's what's happening right now. Tik Tok and all these things people scrolling. I see people selling things inside the road and instead of watching and saying come and buy the Tik Toking you have to stop and buy and say you want to buy something you know they're not interested in selling you know &gt;&gt; this entertaining them &gt;&gt; free food and entertainment free checks and entertainment that's what the devil have Facebook Tik Tok scrolling all kind of them small thing small in and YouTube what they call it real &gt;&gt; shorts &gt;&gt; shorts shorts because people mind they can't take long like not taking shorts social media, all kind of cuckoo thing. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me somebody say if you're in boy scouts will sign up to train an army. If you use a caps gun, all kind of thing just to make joke, fun, anything you think about entertainment. &gt;&gt; If you don't want basketball, you have football. You know football, you have cricket. If you don't cricket, you have net ball. If you name it, they have a full full of offense. &gt;&gt; You have enough sense in your head. This is not progressing. This not helping you. &gt;&gt; People who really progressive and think have no time for their foolishness. You know, they're not even on Facebook. They're not on these things. &gt;&gt; You know what friend requests I get? I have no friends. I have nothing against friends and friends and friends and family. I have none. Not one. No. Not one. [laughter] Ton people send me friendship friendship friendship I don't have time &gt;&gt; to think friend think I I don't have sorry &gt;&gt; maybe I just too busy praise God amen I close him I want you to know this for sure you that listen to this tape I have no more to do with this than nothing no more than just a voice I wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that I declared to do and determined to do. I wasn't the one that appeared down at the river. I was only standing there when it happened. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performed these things and fortell these things that happened as perfect as they are. I am only one that was near when he does it. &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It was I what I surrendered myself to &gt;&gt; that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seven angel. No, it's the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was a mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He is the one you are feeding on. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not feeding on a man. His words will fail, but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man." &gt;&gt; And then he begins to pray. He said, "Dear father, this is a hard thing. It's not easy for mortal to do it. Thou knowest all things. And I pray thee, dear God, that will not be misunderstood. Father God, I know I don't know who the elected is. Thou knowest. I know, I don't know when your coming is. I only know that you said when this takes place. These false anointed ones, not right when they started. Moses just let him alone for he could do no more about it. He could only say what you were saying. You told him call fleas and he called them. You told him, "Turn the water to blood." Then he did it. Moses only carried word by word. No father, you are God. Yet the same word said that this would happen in the last days. Many honest persons we said last morning putting their hands on that ark upon the new cart, not upon the shoulder of Levi, fell dead. Many ministers sitting in the study read that word and change the page quick to keep from having to blast out to know he would lose his social standing with the public with his church and with his denomination. God, help us never to do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he said these words, "Cleanse our heart, Lord, &gt;&gt; from all the filth of the world, Lord. I stand ready for cleansing. I stand ready with this church, with all that is listening in. And whoever will listen to this tape, I stand, Lord, and ask for cleansing. Lord, take me to the potter's house and break me and moan me, a servant that you want." For Lord Jesus, I'm a man of unclean lips. Isaiah cried, dwelling with the people of unclean lips, "so is me. I see revelation of God being made manifest. Let's all [music] stand. I see the end time, Lord. Woe is me and my family. Woe is me and my people. Oh, eternal God, have mercy upon us. I plead for myself and the people. Let us not perish with those who believe not, but may we live with the believers. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
