like you came to cause something to happen tonight amen amen amen amen my my my God bless you thanks for coming amen what a mighty God we serve I'm here with a simple message tonight I wouldn't be too long but I'm simply here to tell you that he loves you he cares for you he wants what's best for you he wants to ensure that you're all right he wants to fellowship with you he wants to commune with you he wants to speak with you he just want to inquire about you he want to seek your well-being he cares for you so much he want to come down tonight and speak to your heart he want to know what's going on with you he want to have a relationship with you he want to have a pure relationship one where he could communicate with you on a regular basis when he could speak to you and you to him and he could have that kind of love relationship with you amen that's what he want to do and that's what I came to tell you simple message he's in charge it's his will and he want to show you what he would like you to do how you could fit into that pattern that he has he wants to ensure that wherever you go he is in front of you that he is behind you he's protecting you even if you're in the shadow of death tonight he don't want you to faar he want to make sure he will carry you through paths that you didn't anticipate that you would go he want to ensure that you're his child and he's his father and you know it he want to check to see what the tutor is saying about you how close are you coming how close is your signature to his he want to see your progress and development he loves you so much and he cares about you so much he want to speak kind words to you he want to tell you how much he love you and how much he care about you how impressed he is by you and at the same time when you go wrong he want to admonish you he want to prune you so you bring forth more fruit he want to send love letters to you that's why the prophet came to send love letters because he loves you so much he wanted to communicate it in a way that you could understand that you could have that lovely relationship with him he don't want a a sometimish kind of relationship he don't want a toxic relationship but he want a pure true loving relationship where communication is key he could tell you when he's pleased he could tell you when he's displeased that's what he's looking for he's looking for sincerity he's looking for people who could respond to his called that's what he's looking for and that's what I come to share amen you love him let's just bow our heads as we pray and then we'll read the scripture oh heavenly father it's so good for Brethren to dwell together Lord in unity Lord Lord to sing your praises and to worship and to cry out and call Upon Your Name Lord Lord you say when we talk about you and we sing about you and we Fellowship around your word Lord you come closer Lord Lord we want you to dwell among us we want you to speak to hearts Lord Lord we want lives to be change and transform Lord Lord we we know our difficulties our struggles our trials our our tests that we may have come in here with Lord but we want to shake them off tonight because we know are greater than Solomon is here Lord we want to shake them off tonight because we know you never leave us nor forsake us Lord Lord we come to give you are everything and our All In Lord Lord anybody could read the scriptures Lord but we want you to come and really Inspire it Lord Lord and open up your word to your people Lord Lord I pray that you will reveal your word to us and you will bless us tonight Lord above and beyond what we could ask or think Lord Lord I pray that you take me out of the way Lord and you will speak lip to air to your people tonight that everyone will get what they came for lord lord I pray that Lord such a mighty re Revival will start out right now Lord Lord that we will sweep throughout the house sweep through Trinidad sweep to The Wider World Lord Lord I pray that no one will leave this place the same way they came like Brother Ray said they will either be better or they'll be worse Lord tonight we pray that we leave here better off Lord Lord we pray that we we be drawn Closer to You Lord that you will reveal yourself in such a great way to us tonight Lord Lord have your perfect will Lord I pray that you will anoint my lips Lord Lord that you'll anoint every word Lord and like a master a master tailor that you'll Stitch everything together just the way you want it we want to be careful to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen thank you Jesus if you have your Bibles and like you tune with me to uh The Book of John reading from chapter 10 just two short vers verses there verses 27 and 28 in the Book of John chap 10 verse 27 and it says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and verse 28 says and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand I just want to read it one more time my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats Hallelujah and I read the scripture and as I studied the scripture I was filled with such excitement because it says my sheep hear my voice not anybody else's sheep this is Jesus speaking and he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them he knows every one of his sheep every one of us he knows us as individuals and he says and they follow me so clearly if you're not following God you know what's going on we have a problem CU he says his sheep follow him and they hear his voice and he knows them and he also says he gives something unto them he give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand so that's his commitment and for a title I have just three simple words when God speaks when God speaks cuz he wants to speak to you amen he wants to speak to us he wants to speak to me tonight amen and for a subject are you in a position to hear his voice are you in the right place that you could hear what he's saying to you tonight or is it when he's trying to communicate with you preoccupied with Facebook and Instagram and social media and movies and videos and he's just trying to have this relationship with you are you in a position to hear his voice when he speaks amen so that's what we want to share about tonight because no matter what we do no matter how much you achieve no matter how much you try no matter how difficult it gets you can can cry you could you could feel disappointed and distracted if you're not in the position to hear his voice you wouldn't hear it and the scripture says my sheep hear my voice so it means we must be in alignment to hear his voice amen so with that in mind the prophet in a message straight As the gate 59 paragraph 54 it says they for instance and this is referring to Jesus could not believe that God was in that man that was the biggest obstacle that they had to climb over was how him being man yet made himself God they couldn't see how God could dwell in human flesh and in all ages in all times God has always dwelt in Men in man sorry man is God's agent in every generation God speaks to his people through human lips he always chooses someone or something that he can use amen so he wants to speak to you tonight and in every generation he uses somebody or something to speak to you so he has a special message that he once spoken to you so we as his sheep should be interested in what message he has for us amen so today I'm I'm just going to show you quickly through scripture that God wants and he desires to speak to you so much that he has many many many many many ways and mechanisms and and and and and and channels that he will use in an effort to get to you like the Garden of Eden where you come in the cool of the evening and say Adam how was things how was everything I just came to check up I just want to know that everything is okay I just want to know that you know I provided you with the right resources and you're having a good time and you you're accomplishing and and you know what seems like a trial is is just my my desire to build your character a little more and I want you to get a little stronger so I know it hurts a little bit but it's okay if you just stick with it it's going to be all right and perhaps you failed the test and he sent it again you know in his wisdom he said I want you to do this over I want you to do it better next time that's all he wants to do so we don't have to put up a resistance but you know many times when we look a realize that if I were to say that you you have to become you have to come in a position to hear his voice it sounds like we have to do these things and and and what God really wants for me and and it sounds like a rule and and it sounds like God want to put me in a particular place and yes he does but you know what what is so interesting about this God I serve it doesn't matter what you think it really doesn't he is not dependent on your opinion of how he should work I remember one of the first quotes I ever heard when they would have released the electronic form of voice of God Recordings was you know he he would take something a big animal like an elephant a little bitty animal like a mouse and who's there to tell God what to do and how to do it we can't instruct God God determines how he want us to operate and we fit into that mold amen so with that said a reference Abraham and Sarah and I said it doesn't matter what you think and you know where I'm going with this in a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday and for yesterday today and forever this is 61 brother brandham spoke about Abraham and Sarah and he spoke about them in this way say paragraph 65 he said but this one stayed behind with Abraham referring to the angels who came to visit now remember he was a stranger had dust on his clothes he came from a foreign country year way away far and he says Abraham where's your wife Sarah how did you know that he was married and how did you know he had a wife named Sarah Abraham where is your wife Sarah now the Bible strictly states that he said she's in the tent behind you behind the angel the angel was God in human flesh am watch said she's in the tent behind you watch this I will visit you according to the time of life and Sarah laughed not obviously but within herself not out loud on the inside of the tent and with his back turned to the tent he said why did Sarah laugh what kind of a telepathy is that and we heard about telepathy last Sunday so he said what kind of telepathy is that what was it it was a sign that she's just ready to burn now he said as it was was in the days of Sodom and the world is in a Sodom condition now just before the fire fell the angel of the Lord comes back and dwell in human flesh and does the same sign to give the Gentiles the same Messianic sign it did to the Jews and the Samaritans amen do you see it he's got to if he lets this church Coast through on just me theology he'd give them a favor and a sign that he didn't permit to us and if God is the same and he is the same he will do the same and act the same to each one of his children and to every generation including ours he has to be the same and that was his sign in that day to the Jews Samaritans at the closing of their day this is the closing of our day the gospel returns again to the Jew pretty soon he's waiting right now for it just waiting for the sign to appear to him and then he will return which Elijah and Moses will do Revelation 11 amen so I think that clearly showed it didn't matter what Sarah thought it didn't matter her opinion God spoke that day and said I'll return according to the time of life you don't have a choice in the matter right and that's just the way God did it in that time you know there are times you need to be taught so this is another approach of God he so want to speak with you he not just leaving it like that he not leaving it up to ch he says sometimes you need to be taught because sometimes you don't know like the example with Samuel and Eli in 1st Samuel 3 4-10 and it says that the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran unto Eli and said here am I here am I for thou called me and he says I called not lie down again and he went and laid down and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou this called me and he answered I called not my son liong again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eli and said here here am I for thou this called me and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child keep in mind this child didn't understand the communication of God at that time so Eli said unto Samuel go lie down and it shall be if he calls thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy servant heareth so Samuel went and laid down in his place and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak for thy servant her it all he wants to do is speak with you to fellow fellowship with you to find out how you're doing because in any relationship if you don't communicate how are you really doing you're hoping that God could just do favors for you that's a kind of strain relationship huh you don't talk to him at all you don't pray you don't Fellowship you don't read his word you don't know what he likes and dislikes but when you need something you run to him is that the way we want to live so sometimes we need to learn and understand his voice and the way he wants to speak with you but one thing we must do above all else is approach with reverence so this is another approach Moses and the burning bush this one and you will see the relationship to Sunday's message again in a message God manifesting his gifts 57 paragraph s he said then we find him one day hurting his father-in-law sheep and you know the story coming down an old familiar part and all of a sudden his attention was attracted to some great phenomena that was a bush that was burning with fire and was not consumed and Moses never questioned the bush as we would today if if was today we it viral on Instagram it on Facebook we're creating some reals or some kind of thing yeah he just drew aside and walked up to it and wanted to find out what was going on and when he approached it reverently God spoke to him and when we approach God in the same manner God will speak to us so you want God to speak to you approach him with reverence but never in a critical way can we approach God and expect God to speak back to us we've got to approach him in a reverent way and that's why I said picking up from last Sunday's message perhaps what if Moses would have said being that I'm raised up as a scientist and as as a master in Egypt because he was trained in the ways of the Egyptians so he could have used that carnal knowledge at that point he said I've mastered all their Arts I will wait and find out when that fire goes off the bush I'll take some leaves and take it to the LA laboratory and find out just why those leaves didn't burn what kind of chemicals were on those leaves that would not burn in the great heat if he would have approached it in that standpoint in a scientific research God would would have never spoke to him that's the reason today that people doesn't get along with God as they should is because they are trying to scientifically prove everything and God is never known by science if you can prove God then there's no more Act of Faith you cannot prove God by science you've got to accept him by faith and you know faith comes from hearing by hearing the word of God Amen therefore M Moses Drew up with a willing heart to understand and God SP spoke to Moses and said take off your shoes for the ground you stand on is Holy Ground Moses removed his shoes Moses removed his shoes and God talked to Moses Moses learned more in five minutes time in the presence of that fire than he learned in 40 years of education he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that light than he did in 40 years studying and schooling how his mother had taught him and he would have been emancipator of the of Egypt all these things that has been taught by his mother and by teachers and by schools and yet he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that light and that's the power of approaching god with reverence amen so God could speak to him you know in another example said some sometimes you'll be forced some sometimes he'll Force his way on you you know when he wants to speak to you he he don't care what what you're doing he not waiting for you to turn aside he not waiting for you to pause you're busy no problem if he wants to talk to you he talking to you still regardless of where you are what time it is who you around whe whether at a family function whe they think it's Valentine's it doesn't matter if you want to speak to you tonight nobody could stop that Saul on his way to Damascus thought he was on a mission sometimes I said God will force his his his his hand to speak to you he said in in Acts 93-6 he said and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined wrong about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecuted thou me it didn't matter who he was it didn't matter how powerful what rank he had God was ready to speak to him at that point and nothing could stop it in verse 5 and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do you see so it doesn't matter what attitude you have who you think you are he is no respector of persons when he's ready to speak to you he's going to do it as as a prophet if love can't do it conditions will he will flip you upside down because he want to have a conversation with you you could run but you can't hide when he's ready to have you settle down he will and there's nothing you could do about it you know often times we look at the loud we look at we look at The Bold and the brave but sometimes he he communicates in secret you know amen sometimes he talking to the sister next to you and you feel like nothing is going on because you're not hearing anything you're not seeing anything he's doing it in secret so I'll give you an example of that in the Book of Matthew chap 16: 13-18 it says when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of manam and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am that was his question to them now I'm sure sure he knew that he didn't tell them at the side or he didn't tell them in advance it was not test and he give them a practice test before but the next thing may have surprised some he said and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon Barona for Flesh and Blood had not reveal it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it nobody else knew no other disciple no friend no family no acquaintance knew that Peter got a revelation of who Jesus was but God spoke to Peter God spoke to Peter's heart so he knew something he got a revelation that nobody else had because he wanted to I'm saying we can't tell God how to operate he will do what he wants how he wants when he wants whether we like it or not whether we want it or not when he wants to talk to you he wants to talk to you when he has a message for you he has a message for you he don't care how busy you are he don't care what you're doing there are times he might ignore you but if he wants you you are the man for the job you know like like Jonah no matter where he went what he did he was the man for the job he couldn't run he couldn't hide he might have dug a tunnel and and and say you know what nobody could find me God was still going to find a way to use him because that was his man at the time that was his man for the job that guy was predestinated to do that Moses was the same Elijah was the same Isaiah was the same Daniel was the same there is no way Joseph was going to escape that Egypt root no matter what he tried no matter what he did God wanted him in a particular place and nothing no circumstance no boss no work colleague somebody talk bad about you and give you a bad appraisal it can't can't change the destiny that God has in store for you it cannot hinder it may seem to you that things not working out and they don't like me but it's because God don't want you there he has better for you he owns the the cattle on a thousand hills he don't even want you worrying about that and what the neighbor don't like you God don't want you in that neighborhood he wants you to move out that's why they troubling you amen so sometimes he works in secret you know at other times you need to wait until God don't rush you you know like like recently so so they said they were monitoring somebody for for a year and watching the social media activity and now the punks and they give them some charges it's not you do a crime now and they run and they bust down your door they monitor you for a while they gather the evidence and then they decide you know what are going to throw the whole book at you Butz they don't want you escape and most times it's not one charge just do multiple so even if one fail they catch you still sometimes that's how it works God will wait on you you let your run your run let you go as far as you want to go as as they a long time every long rope have a end you could run you could hide you could play yourself at the end of the day when you're ready for you he ready for you that's just the way he is so you know I use Daniel as the example thought it was a fine example in a message he his voice 58 here brother brandom talking about Daniel he said Daniel down in Babylon as we spoke of him last night he had purposed in his heart that he will not defile himself with the Babylonian Doctrine so he not going to allow at a time he not heing onto himself you know anybody teachers having itching and just listening to doctrines and things that they have that sound nice but one day down there Daniel got in need and he knowed he wanted to hear the voice of God so you mean you should have a desire to hear God speak you should have a desire to be in position so when God talk you could catch it one time you could hear it one time so that could activate the faith in your soul that he put there one time so he had a desire he wanted to hear the voice of God yet he had the scriptures but he needed to hear the voice of God not just wanted he needed that and he went down to the such River and he just didn't go down there and park his Chariot and needle down in the bull rushes and say Lord God I want to hear you where you at no that's not what he did you don't do it that way well he took his Chariot and the drivers and and he went down to the river and he sent them back so he allowed them to take him and he tell them well go ahead I good I save all right I spending some time by the river he sent them back he was going to stay till he heard you hear that till he heard Bram said that's the way he got desperate about it he had to get Plum away from all the soldiers all the astronomers all the wise men all the doctors of Theology and so for that was trying to tell him this you do this Daniel you do this Daniel but he got away from all of it that's the way you got to do amen and he got down on that River and he stayed there for 21 days wrestling with the angel of the Lord but we're told that he looked out upon the Water there he saw an angel standing with his foot on the land and the Sea and raised up his hands and swore by him that lives forever and ever when the things that Daniel saw come to pass time shall be no more he had been delayed 21 days because of the evil of the land and if he was delayed and this is the prophet speaking he said if he was delayed 21 days because of the evil of the land of that land in the days of Persia what would he be in this day how long could he be delayed but that undying faith that hunger that desire in the human heart that wouldn't say no to God but will hold on till God speaks from Heaven you can't play with this you can't play with this gospel it's not to be played with it must hit the tack 10 times out of 10 it's got to be perfect or it isn't right or it won't work it's got to be perfect Daniel Prayed and I put a note here he was willing to stay however long it took he was willing to do whatever it took until he heard from God so sometimes it's not instant but you have to wait you have to T you have to be willing to sacrifice and see God move and allow God to speak in his own time amenl amen I have a note here you know and all these are different ways that God is going to speak to people God wants to commune with you God wants to share his his love gifts you know he want to say listen here what I find you're doing real good but what I want you to do do this different so I realize you you really you follow all the Commandments and you you know you listen to all the the preaching and teaching and you attend all the prayer meeting but what lack you yet I want you to do X Y and Z because it might be different for everybody he knows what you have need of he knows the trials he want to send you but I know in your heart you're hiding so you're busy you have all kind of things occupying your time but all you want to do is to some sometimes tell your hey you you did real good you do real good you know there are times when and I saying this in relationships your wife say listen I want to talk talk to you and as a man you say you want to talk to me what you want to say what you want to tell and she tell you this in the morning but she has say nothing for the day and whole day you une easy and all she want to tell you is that I appreciate the way you Wasing she wears yesterday you know sometimes God want to tell you good things he want to share blessings and secrets and things that he have in store for you but instead you running and hiding and ducking Sometimes some people will only respond and will only hear and only put themselves in position when fire comes in the still small small voes to easy the burning bush too too exciting they don't want to respond to that so he had a send some fire the fire had to burn you that to touch you that's the next example I'll use now brother brandham in a message hear his voice 58 talking about Isaiah he said and he got down in the temple and he realized then he raised his hands and said oh God I'm a man of unclean lips you think you're good but wait till that time comes I dwell among peoples of unclean lips what did he he got desperate and when you get desperate about this thing something will take place so it's obvious you're not desperate enough you're not desperate enough to hear from God for God to speak to you because if you're desperate enough you'll realize I am nothing I am no good I can't achieve anything in in myself on my own God don't need me he said when you get desperate about that thing something will take place you're not desperate enough oh well I join church that settles it but you have to be desperate about it you have to really need God Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but as long as you're satisfied with the things of the world how can God ever really speak to you you say God never spoke to me why he wants to but you're too filled up with things of the world that's what's the matter with us we put all our time on things of the world and the pleasures of the world and give no time to God it's true now we find out that Isaiah got desperate and he screamed out and confessed his sins and confessed the sins of the people and when he got through confessing he heard a noise above him and when he looked up there was the cherubims flying back and forth through the Wings over their faces Wings over their feet flying with wings crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty something was taking place Isaiah got desperate God come on the job and Isaiah screamed I have unclean lips for a voice had just spoke it changed him who will go for us said the Voice who will go who is willing to stand in the breach among this bunch of theologians who will go in this day and claim that I'm still God amen amen who will go and condemn their uncleanness who will tear down their denominations and build the powers of the Living God again who will go Isaiah said Lord before I can go I've got to be alternate some of these little fears and fluster had to leave him so will it be with every individual God calls you think Moes when God called him he was just Brave and B and said I going down to Egypt you know because I spent 40 years no he said listen I can't even talk this is a man that was perhaps second in command of all of Egypt would say I not qualified for this thing I able I can't face pharaoh and the Army and and all the politicians they have there they say everyone God called they have a little thing to shake off they still have to fix that's why there's a five-fold Ministry you know because God wants a Perfect Bride he wants to see listen Mastery in motion he wants to see when you step out he could see a reflection of himself he could say there is my beloved Son there's my beloved daughter they have all the attributes they could sign as good as me they could express just the way I would he said so it be with every individual God calls you got to be born again changed and made new not imagination but from your heart something that really takes place and one of the Angels if you ask you shall receive one of the angels went over to the Brazen Altar and took the tongues and reach over and got a coal of living fire and ran over to isai and placed it in his mouth said now you're clean go speak the word Isaiah was changed after he heard that voice only when the fire came then you could see that's the change he needed it wasn't just talk at the end of the day clearly God is is is ready to do whatever he has to do to speak to you he will accomplish whatsoever he desires whatever he set forth to accomplish he will whatever he wants to achieve he will no matter what the scenario looks like or what he has to do where he have to put you or what he have to shift around he will do whatever it takes to get to you because he loves you because he cares for you because he wants what's best for you because he wants to have fellowship with you because he wants to communicate and have such a relationship with you he wants to speak to you like Adam you know he wants to come and say listen how how things started off this year is the second month things all right you're paying the bills you're getting time to pray you're reading the Bible he wants to know that you're doing okay he wants to have that relationship with you he wants to know your troubles and your struggles and what you think is too much so he can give you that reassurance that listen those are the things I allow you know those are the things I I I want you to go through cuz I know when you come through you'll be better off can you imagine Joseph and how he might have complained look I have all these dreams and I know I gifted here but look at me I in jail jail how how I end up here but that wasn't the attitude God has a journey to to pass him through to get him to where he was supposed to be God knew exactly how he would feel God God knew exactly the mechanisms and methods he would use to get him there so it's not for us to complain there's a reason why the children of God went through the Wilderness for that period you know to to go around for 40 years and that I believe was a two-day trip you know they roll around for 40 years know because God knew what was in them couldn't take them into the promised land you know he knew they couldn't go with without him that baggage was too great it would risk his reputation too much because he knew you had to conquer every city every opposition every he out there would have been defeated but not with his group so he spent them around for 40 years for the children to go over and that was his way I did say I wouldn't be long tonight musicians could get ready at the end of the day he want you to hear his voice in a message hear his voice Bram in paragraph 61 he said would there be some here he said this morning but I want to say tonight which I know there is that would say Lord be merciful unto me joined church I've I've made a confession but I don't know what it is to get quiet before you and to hear your voice leading me and teaching me and guiding me and showing me what you have in store for me where you really want me to go is there anybody like that tonight I wouldn't know what to do if you should speak in an audible voice you feel that way if God were to speak tonight at an audible voice what would you do how would you respond how would you react if God said i' love to know you you know that you could speak to me and and and you want God to direct your path to direct your life you to say in all th ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your path your life different when he Direct in your path your attitude is different when he directing your part you're not operating by Guess anymore you're operating with the assurance that this is where he want you to be at this point that's why the scripture say for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose because he purposed for you to be here tonight he purposed for you to be a particular place in in your life right now not to complain not to be frustrated but because he loves you he wants you here am you know you have heard it preach many many times sometimes God God bless you with a car and you everywhere except church he bless you with a house and and you you in the house more than you're working and all of a sudden these materialistic thing become Idols before you and we question why Lord why why you don't give me a little more why you don't bless me like you bless my brother why you don't do this like you bless my sister but God knows you he know listen he who is faithful in little faithful in much if he give you too much he might spoil you you may not be in a position to handle that yet so he had to pass you through a little longer he had to to to mold you a little more before you could really be in a position to manage that you need to die out a little bit a little bit more he knows deep in your heart the kind of Pride you have not right here you might say all the right things but you can't see that from the outside you know the kind of greed you have on the inside your brother don't know about it your sister don't know about it your neighbor don't know but it's on the inside amen like that Rich Young Ruler when when he say what lack I at and he say listen go go sell what you have Jesus knew exactly what the matter was you know he knew the issues he had right he didn't loow him up and go go on Facebook and Instagram and say look look who come and talk to mina no he didn't do that but he tried to address it in that particular way knowing the result he wanted and the Bible said Jesus loved him you know it wasn't a malicious thing he did you know he loved him his heart went out to him he really wanted better for him just like he wants for us he loves us to know imagine we were failures we were gone we were nothing but he still reach down throughout the 1 almost 5 million in Trinidad to come if you look at Trinidad on a map it's a DOT he came to that dot just to find you your mother and father not even in church and he came just for you he inspired your coworker 20 years ago just to testify to you because he wanted you to hear his word and to share with you the love gifts he had for you how grateful we ought to be to know that this was his plan all along and you want to be frustrated and upset and you vexed because they put you in a SE that you don't like no no no no no no how could I compare to the glory he have stored up for you how could we compare that the kind of love he has for us no matter how we we fail and we fall and we we we we do things that might bring displeasure to him but he still reach out and forgive and sustain and keep and provide for us regardless to think so many persons that were here 10 years ago are no longer here but you are here for such a time as this for this time he say would you raise your hand just now and say God be merciful the Lord bless you everywhere hands everywhere just continue putting them up that's right Lord be merciful unto me I need you so much would there be some more just before closing God sees your hands back there lady all you weigh in the back and standing in a rose and so forth God sees you even at home or on the Internet watching the stream God sees you he knows your heart he understands what's going on with you just like Samuel said Eli did you call me Eli said no I never called you that wasn't me that spoke to your heart friend that was God just speak back and say thy servant heareth and take me into your care today God ask him to speak to you just speak back and say thy servant hear it and you take me into your care today let me from this day be holy thine you could play to be like Jesus Eternal God lover of the Soul creator of all things while that still small voice of God that spoke to Samuel that spoke to Saul that spoke to Peter that spoke to Daniel and Isaiah the prophet and all down Through the Ages has spoken again tonight in the Tabernacle perhaps maybe 30 or 40 or 50 hands or Sinners church members whoever it may be people with frustrations raise their hands many of them were were here for a long time and they heard your voice some in an audible way and now tonight that same voice speaks deep down in their heart they've raised their hands and with their hands towards heaven saying they're wrong and they want to be right is that your desire tonight you have said in your word that no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that will come I give them eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day and you promise it father now we call upon thee as your
