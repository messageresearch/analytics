this evening exodus chapter 23 one verse from 20 to 33 and deuteronomy we want to read from chapter 7 runnery from 17 to 26. you appreciate brother joshua leading songs this evening god bless you praise the name of the lord so exodus chapter 23 reading from verse 20. behold i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto dying enemies and an adversary unto dying adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the hittites and the parasites and the canaanites the hivites the jebusites and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor save them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images you shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water i will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast the young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all my enemies turn their backs onto thee i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the king the night the hittite from before thee i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lease the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before they until thou be increased and inherit the land and i will set thy bonds from the red sea even unto the sea of the philistines and from the desert unto the rivers and for i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and those shall drive them out before thee thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land least they make thee sin against me for if you serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee let's go across to deuteronomy chapter 7. reading from verse 17. if those are seen in heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them thou shalt not be afraid of them but shall well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and onto all egypt the great temptations which then eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm wherewith the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed thou shalt not be afraid of them for the lord thy god is among you almighty god and terrible and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little though me has not consumed them at once leaves the beast of the field increased upon thee but the lord thy god shall deliver unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed and he shall deliver their kings into their hand thine hand and thou shall destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them the graven images of their gods shall be burned with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lease they'll be sneered therein for it is an abomination to the lord thy god neither shall thou bring an abomination into thine house least there will be cursed thing like it but those shall utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is acoustic let's pray father we thank you for your word lord breathe life into it give insight into it inspire to our hearts that when we leave here our hearts will be burning for righteousness burning with the fear knowledge of god bless the word to our hearts we pray in jesus

overcome you holly look what will give you more as all the darkness move out and the light begin to grow inside of you as you get rid of this and get rid of that as you get rid of this and you dump that as you separate from this as you separate from that you're gonna begin to that light gonna begin to get greater and greater inside your being more angels gonna be attracted to the light that you are emanating you get more protection you get more hey man hallelujah you get the angel of god and camping around you there you go the angel go he said i shall send my fear before you the fear gonna go before you they're going to fail hallelujah before you come to trembling demons shaking sickness quaking because your prayer is about to be uttered they are afraid of your prayer because your prayer is uttering unto god them demons don't even want to pray because they know they begin to pray they have to be cast out they have to pack up shop and leave power starting to come in your members power exactly they're coming to your body god wants you to possess this land but he cannot chop it up for you he already gave you the land he cannot fight it like that for you you have got a path to play oh come on almighty gentile warriors oh glory to god these men around david they were not hebrew men there wasn't israelite men they were gentile men they were fearless men that's the kind of men we want men that don't care men that fearless men that believe in what god said oh i'm not what the sickness tells you i don't give your body of cancer from your head to your toe and the doctor gave you 24 hours to live but you don't care what the doctors say you don't care what anybody say had the lord going to be with you oh glory to god have no covenant with their gods break down the altars break down the images break down everything that is false you want jehovah's son you're a jehovah daughter oh glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god gloria are you with me oh my you will be seated praise god hallelujah hallelujah brother branham this is a beautiful land it's a wonderful land and now they come back with evidence from the kingdom and joshua isn't that right and they brought evidence and god had had to get away from the church raise up other men like called joshua and went over to the promised land and they fought down every philistine now look god said i'm not gonna give you all at one time if i give you the whole land will be swept beer then the wild beast will multiply against you and overcome you i'm gonna give you little by little as you are able to possess the land i'm gonna drive them out so you come like a farmer turn in a piece of land you're cut here and you clean up here and you plant some corn then cutting the cream you plant some peas you cut your peanut pans and potatoes they cut champagne and plant some body or whatever it is isn't that right but if you're cut and you don't maintain and clean then the grass go back here you cut then the grass go back here you cut then the grass go back then after a year you're still nowhere because you wasn't able to take it possess it manage it overcome it hallelujah that is how you're going to overcome from here on out [Applause] little by little so tell the devil you are a liar i am going to overcome i'll let the devil know up front because they don't want to put all this in front of you look at you look at that look at that forget that start right here i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you i want to help you guys shout in the house [Applause] don't let the devil trick you to say look at that look at that look all that you haven't welcome say yet i overcome that yet but i'm coming to get you you devil you but little by little praise god i'm going to take this lamb we are starting today take note of this day on your calendar oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god there is a reason why god still little by little because we want you to be able to effectively manage you see that's the problem if somebody can't manage a hundred dollars why give them 10 000. they don't need more money they need counseling they need the technique how to manage little there's a rule in that because the scriptures are he that is faithful in little going to be faithful in much so god does test you with little before he give you much god will test you and your attitude to the little that is given to you and if you could effectively manage little god knew he could put much on your hands okay the lord i shout give our lord a praise all glory to god so when you have mean bad attitudes to what offered to you to what's given to you it just goes to show you ain't ready yet oh hallelujah you may be seated look at that little task that god give the david father give him to do carry these is for your brothers it's a little task difficult to say daddy you have nothing for me to do all that journey to carry some food for my brothers but you see in that little task it had some hidden things inside the deer in that little task god wanted to bring david from the back to the front and god had to use a little thing just to be a messenger just to be a carrier just to be put in something for not you for your brethren and and they they look like they like david they look like their problems with david but still david said them fellas give me trouble already daddy i'm not going no it was a little task but in that little task there was a mystery inside of there there was something hidden inside of there don't despise the day of small things okay the law some praises people don't you ever despise the day of small things don't say it's too small don't say it's too ordinary no it might be a little something but in the supernatural realm things are beginning to turn over and turn over there's a supernatural day today this is the first community we have in a long time and this morning service mighty gentile warriors and this evening you are hearing little by little you're going to possess the flame and the land so don't let the devil put strain on your head and you adopt unnecessary stress he gonna be stressed after this service because once you understand the principle that little leads you too much come on say man somebody once you understand when you deal with the hittites here they're not the killer knights are next and i have to be with the king like the jebusites are next we're going to take them one by one glory to god are you hearing me you're going to take them country by country tongue by tongue city by city nation by nation we're going to take back street by street do you understand what i'm saying lying upon line here a little dear little line up online precept upon precept word on top of word we're going to possess the land till we get back supernatural till we get back speaking in tongues till we get back signs wonders miracles the power of god flowing freely back into the church it's starting today [Applause] says you say i feel a little better well praise god we take some we got killed nice today we'll take america some more just as you are able you might break your neck if you get it all at once and we have seen that happen with people they get over blessed and they wasn't ready for the blessing and it so over blessed them they get boxed up with pride and pride break them then they backslide walking in their own strength you heard this morning the scriptures why god tell them tell gideon it's too much of people you hear the reason behind that with so much people they could think is their might and their numbers then get it he said filter them first line of filtering who fight and go back who are fair pack up shop and leave twenty something thousand people say ah i i got called to leave the voice tell me leave before you tell me go back twenty-something thousand is that ten thousand remain god said listen it's still too much because i'm tempting you come on boss and say you see we we do it [Music] god said let me filter them the first one was the big filter shout gaddafi cannot believers but the voice the voice dropped on the filters who want to laugh and let laugh like a dog hallelujah not kneel down like you're worshiping some idea and just dive like a visit you're gonna die from the beach and you put your face down inside the river like it's wally what is for you alone say who lap like a dog who could look like a dog and look drink and lick drink and look drink and look drink and look drink and be alert praise god hallelujah some people do that in the business they head inside the business the guy look around and then there'll be competitors cutting the throat all left and right and center you've got to be looking you've got to be aware you've got to be sensitive there's a war business out there is a war you've got to know what the competitors are doing you've got to know whether they're jamming out there you got to know where the hittites and the amorites and the jebusites you got to know what the next enemy is one time joshua don't listen their enemy the next hill and them guys put on all clothes come with all moldy bread and lie to joshua and tell joshua we come from of our country that's why we look looking so old that time they are the next city when god said make no covenant with them this is fierce now we come from our country look how home it closes with all my brothers and just what compromise with them and that was wrong because of course they don't proper nice with them cut them off shut them off you're going to find out you can't play with them philistines babies they're looking nice but kill them come on you can't play with big skin [Applause] will come some big men to fight you that will kill sin early kill it as babies hallelujah hallelujah it's not right oh hallelujah now israel has started on a field you see people think i want you to say god jesus church message believer it fix it it seems like you have a stamp like your passport stamp and that's it but read the bible two and a half million people coming out and they don't know there's two going in remember redemption is in two parts coming out of yes i'm going into thousands and thousands of people are in this message because they come out but they haven't gone into yet because they're going into you need the spirit to go into ephesians [Music] because the holy ghost is the promised land we are reached there yet church fighting church minister fighting minister that's foolishness god not in that amen amen that that is jebusized spirits common people and churches amorite spirits heights heights and more heights but the reality is we have more to fight than them little people we see we realize we have yesterday with yourself yet that's why some of you can't say enough is enough because you have not had enough you fellowshipping with the enemy when you come to self-realization if i could use that word when you come to the end of yourself like that woman with the blood issue she came to the end of self she said she said listen listen listen i have no promise to be out there but i will tell myself something i so fed up doctors take all my money i so fed up with this blood issue i'm so fed up being sick i'm so tired my husband grumpy grumpy grumpy i'm so tired of him [Applause] telling me stuff but my female

such word she came to jesus hallelujah jesus was standing there all alone waiting for her and the red carpet was in front and she walked up to jesus and touch him with his garment and she went home and said ah he touched me and i touched his head with the garment i made whole that is not in my bible that is not in my bible it sounds good it's not in my bible but that was ephesians for her that

came down to the press there was people all around jesus she has gone about to close off and she was hearing the ending of his words she didn't come much for his words you know she just come for touch

talked to people and i know they don't want to change i'm speaking spoken to believers and i know in their mind they like how they are they just want people to hear their mouth like if you're a psychiatrist all psychiatrists listen here and charge you after him they charge me for their ears you know amen you just talk and talk for three hours after three hours ticking their cash register press and they say two words after you talk and you talk about yourself and you feel better because you talk amen god help us praise god why would god fill you with power and you're not ready to work

don't take the silver don't even bring it in your house it'll be an accustomed to you don't touch it let's read what happened there from verse 18 jesus chapter seven and when joshua's had a fight and started to lose men they say what is this something is wrong because god said he will make our enemies stay in their backs no we turn our backs on me running so then they know something was wrong then they go to the camp tribe by tribe family by family household by household man by man when they come to this family akan got called out verse 18 of joshua chapter 7 and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of kami the son of zadie the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken and judged on the eakin my son gave i pray thee glory to god and make confession unto him tell me what that was done hide it not from me and he can answer them just once said indeed i have sinned against the lord thy god and thus and thus have i done when i saw aha that's what his eyes were saying he saw something isn't that right when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonician garment and 200 shackles of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weighed i coveted them and took them he's handling it now have it in his eyes how it in his heart you have it and touching that we have in his hands isn't that right and he hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and his silver under it so joshua sent messengers ran into the tent behold it was hidden in his tent the silver under it and they took them out in the midst of the tent brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and lay them all before the lord and joshua and all israel with him took aikan the son of zira and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters his oxen his asses his sheep his tent and all he had and they brought them to the valley of echo and joshua said why has thou troubled us the lord shall trouble you this day and all israel stone him with stones and burn them with fire after they had stone him with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stone unto this day so the lord turn away the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of echo and unto this day so aiken was showed it he looked at it he touched it he hid it simple act and that affected israel and that had to be judged that is ephesians amen that is the ephesians of acts 5 and nursing sapphira that just like that in the book of the old testament that's what we're talking about and god promised there'll be a prophetic church there will be another

god saw him as king amen that was his position amen no david enjoy shepherding sheep and all kinds like that but that was not what his calling was his calling was to be king amen to sit on a man that is jealous have an evil spirit upon him on that throne a man named saul was a terrorist all by himself especially when he even spread come upon him read your bible and so they were fought they would fight they won't even play mad at him spit on yourself all kind of thing they would do to survive one time you had to be among the philistines and all all kinds of things they would do to survive because you see the objectives the throne looking like you don't need to flush your gonna fill up fed up they thrown his mind and i can't get it you know what let me go over that one yes i'll be executive vagrant what could be some kind of some kind of other thing or something like that david was not on that fight and regardless battle regardless and you know what's great about it he had men around him who believed he was the upcoming king these guys had a revelation that that man coming into power and they with him and they with the written money is done the rhythm is out and we are with this message when it's looking low when it's looking down when it's looking dry because we know this message coming to power there is going to be a seventh under revival there's gonna be a prize reviler it's looking dumb it's looking low looking messed up look at all kind of preacher going left right four different ways i already want to go but that's not going to stop david from coming into power oh glory to god there's going to be rising some days that's going to come in power but they're slain to chase this intellectual giants in this lamb oh glory hallelujah my god let me get out of here little by little hallelujah i feel the power coming in i feel the authority coming in before power come authority must come oh glory to god authority coming for power that's what the police have you have authority that raises hannah stop the car got not power to stop the car but we get an authority and power to stop the car [Applause] what scripture acts on it you charity power oh hallelujah

manifested power to heal the sick you may be seated power to raise the dead power the cast or devils little by little you're going to possess that man oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god could i take a little more no matter how you're feeling if you go to your feeling if you get back to that here we go are you ready every time you have a negative testimony every time you look at the symptom you're falling right there there's not a christian in here no matter how solid you are in faith if right now that you something happened to get a hold of you and tell you that you're not a christian you start and you start out justifying well i'm not a christian no more you drop right then you are no more a christian anymore as soon as you testify you're not a christian then you drop from grace right there you are falling because your own speech tells you that you are faith acts every time so that's why you cannot say that you're not a christian oh hallelujah listen to this every promise in the book of the great shepherd to his sheep but brother he will never come down and drive it away from you you've got to fight for every inch but it is yours so many say if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing i'll save him but that's up to you you've got something to do they'll overcome shall inherit all things they're overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready i like that word oh hallelujah if god calls you are we ready he intends for you to have it [Applause] let me just say from words before that healing is yours salvation is yours the holy spirit is yours the real holy spirit is yours if god calls you he intends for you to have it but you have to fight every inch of the way to get it oh hallelujah glory to god amen do you believe that yet abraham had the right to the promise and the promise is yet a fight to possess it there you are the believer today watch we are here to all things yet we are heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing in the bible promises yeah you're a writer fight every infrared that's the way god got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own that's the rub that's the rub once you know is your own now i'm beginning to understand god wants me to be adopted for knowledge look back pray election look back to four knowledge but predestination look back to destiny and what is god predestinated us unto adoption where full authority and power is come back to the church but watch this the adopted son he must have dominion over himself so if i want to be adopted i have to begin to understand and operate dominion over me that theo could come out of the way that god could be glorified so i have to fight today do you understand what i'm saying not only fight to live but fight to die oh hallelujah watch i'm of a all things is given to me i'm an air i can claim everything that god promised me it's mine how do you do it watch you take the authoritative word with fate and said it's mine lay it down satan you laid down you took it from me you give it back because i'm serving notice on you i've got the notice written right here on the word heaven will pass away but this knowledge shall not i come with this notice to serve on you that jesus christ said whatsoever i ask the father in his name he will give it to me and if i say this mountain be move and don't doubt in my heart and believe what i say shall come to pass i will lay it down and that gets him started take the authoritative word of god i'm going to close but the branch are real christian musicians fight for his position i want you to say that after me every christian fights for his position say it again a real christian fight for his position amen he has to stand alone him and god and he fights every inch of ground so you don't have a baby and that's what the matter with the pentecostal church today we got pentecostal babies that's just been sprinkled and sprayed not really born again genuine feet born into people luke 16 10 to 12 says this he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful to that which isn't much here is unjust in the least is unjust also in march if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to you two witches if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's how shall you get what is your own that's powerful listen to this in the amplified he who is fearful in a very little thing is faithful in much and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little thing is this honest and adjusting much therefore if you are not being faithful in the case of unrighteous man which is deceitful riches money and possessions who will entrust you with two riches and if you have not proven faithful in that which belongs to another whether god or man who will give that which is for your own which is two riches these are the last words i have here when you are strong to manage the little that you have got god will give you more to manage amen oh let's stand and praise god oh blessed be the name of the lord that's why you say little by little because you want you to manage and keep what you have conquered what you don't want is when you conquer some grounds the devil come back and take it back so after a year when you check out what you have gained you have gained nothing you make a big flash with your sword you run some enemies but the truth is you come back and take
