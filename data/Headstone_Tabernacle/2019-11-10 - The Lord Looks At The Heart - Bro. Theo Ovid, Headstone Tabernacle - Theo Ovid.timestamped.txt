[52:56] scriptures you want to look at First
[52:58] Samuel chapter 16 one read from verse 1
[53:01] to 13 I wanna read one verse in Proverbs
[53:04] 23 wanna read verse 7 and Acts chapter
[53:08] 13 wanna read verse 21 to 22 the title
[53:21] of the message this morning is that the
[53:22] Lord looks at the heart
[53:24] there's a title this morning the Lord
[53:26] looks at the heart
[53:29] this is for Samuel 16 God speaking to
[53:34] his prophet Samuel and the Lord said
[53:36] unto Samuel how long will go mourned for
[53:38] soil Sina rejected him from reigning
[53:42] over Israel fiddling horn with oil and
[53:45] go I will send me to Jesse the better
[53:47] might fire provided me a king among his
[53:51] sons Samuel said can I go it's all here
[53:55] he will kill me and the Lord said take a
[53:58] heifer D&C I am come to sacrifice to the
[54:01] Lord and call Jesse to the sacrifice and
[54:04] I will surely what dole shall do and
[54:06] thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I
[54:09] shall name on dizzy and Samuel did that
[54:12] which the Lord speak and came to
[54:13] Bethlehem and the ends of the tongue
[54:15] tremble at his comin and said come is
[54:17] all peaceably and he said peaceably I am
[54:19] come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify
[54:22] yourselves and come with me to the
[54:24] sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse and
[54:26] his sons and called him that a sacrifice
[54:27] to give the pass when they were come he
[54:30] looked on Ilya and said surely the
[54:33] Lord's anointed is before him and the
[54:35] Lord said of this Samuel look not on his
[54:38] countenance no on the height of his
[54:41] stature
[54:41] because I refused him for the Lord see
[54:46] it not as man see it for man look at at
[54:49] the outward appearance but the Lord
[54:51] looketh on the heart and then Jesse
[54:54] called a banana and made him pass before
[54:58] Samuel and the loss and he said neither
[55:01] had the Lord chosen this then Jesse made
[55:04] shamah to pass by he said neither the
[55:06] Lord chosen this again Jesse made seven
[55:08] of his sons to pass before Samuel and
[55:11] Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had not
[55:13] chosen these Samuel 7 - Jesse idea I
[55:16] hear all alike he said there is room in
[55:19] it yet the youngest and be holy keep at
[55:22] the Sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse 7
[55:24] fetch him for we will not sit down Jerry
[55:27] Camilla and he sent and brought him and
[55:30] he was a ruddy and with a beautiful
[55:33] countenance and good little look at and
[55:35] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[55:39] is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[55:42] and anointed him in the midst of his
[55:45] brethren and the Spirit of the Lord came
[55:48] upon David from that day forward so
[55:50] Samuel rose up and went to Rama on a
[55:54] little proverbs chapter 23 verse 7 safe
[55:57] as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[56:00] eat and drink said he to thee but with
[56:03] his heart is not with thee last

[56:14] given to them so listen of cysts a man
[56:17] of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of
[56:20] 40 years and when he had removed him he
[56:24] raised up unto them Diglett to be their
[56:27] king
[56:27] to whom also he gave testimony and said

[1:01:10] otherwise so there's an excess of
[1:01:13] pressure built up today isn't that right
[1:01:15] and I believe he said is the enemy

[1:02:31] living it was reserves but God saw
[1:02:33] something inside that woman because and
[1:02:36] Jesus after her that Jesus could wait
[1:02:39] and her because God doesn't look as man
[1:02:42] look goddess look at the heart he does a
[1:02:45] completely different so don't come with
[1:02:47] your own think in this morning or give

[1:02:58] you I don't care what your husband say
[1:03:00] about you it is what God say about you
[1:03:09] Nick the devil would go aboard like a
[1:03:12] Roman lion and last days he would get
[1:03:14] you under pressure hurrying over
[1:03:16] something and you will make decisions
[1:03:18] that you wouldn't make if you're sat
[1:03:21] down and think it over
[1:03:26] how much marriages were a whole today if
[1:03:29] people think over the choice of their
[1:03:31] wife and pray about it
[1:03:34] how much relationships would have been
[1:03:36] so different if they had sought the Lord
[1:03:39] and get that I answer from God but
[1:03:44] depression school they have this peer
[1:03:51] pressure got this one our money like a
[1:03:53] time of school and tell me say I want to
[1:03:55] be a drug lord see that's the plenty
[1:03:59] money and Oscar is dead there is that
[1:04:00] build up nice and core from you know
[1:04:02] there is very young to it you watch me
[1:04:11] I missing someone again making decisions
[1:04:14] that you would make if you sit down and
[1:04:18] think it over
[1:04:20] but God has the answer and that is what
[1:04:23] we want to take the answer now in the
[1:04:26] Old Testament there was a time when a
[1:04:28] man could build pressure up there and
[1:04:29] there was a time when he done something
[1:04:31] wrong under pressure and if he shed
[1:04:36] innocent blood and he was on the run as
[1:04:38] soon as that man was killed him wrong he
[1:04:41] did the man he did wrong to some of the
[1:04:43] people would hunt him and if they found
[1:04:45] him they would kill him because in those
[1:04:48] days was good for tute either life or
[1:04:54] life and there was the place where the
[1:04:56] man couldn't stop here to run if he done
[1:05:00] something accidentally of course people
[1:05:01] wouldn't believe it
[1:05:02] I was deer I knew something in one
[1:05:06] felony knife and nobody believed
[1:05:09] something accidentally the relatives or
[1:05:12] this man or woman whoever it was was
[1:05:14] that continent I fight for - that's a
[1:05:16] bit II lived and he couldn't stop
[1:05:18] nowhere he was the fugitive he didn't
[1:05:20] know what to do he was on the run and
[1:05:22] the very type of the day I seen that's
[1:05:24] calling so much pressure we are on the
[1:05:26] run
[1:05:26] that's the matter with the world knowing
[1:05:29] the Commons alone is at hand
[1:05:31] the pressure is building up they're on
[1:05:32] the run rural house gambling luxury sin
[1:05:35] immoral decay they give vent listen to
[1:05:38] the television dirty jokes they invent
[1:05:41] the only run they I want the face of the
[1:05:44] world in a parameter and affliction and
[1:05:45] some comedian cracking jokes and you
[1:05:47] laughing laughing after one UK laugh you
[1:05:51] laughing as long as the comedian given
[1:05:53] talk you laugh and after that you still
[1:05:54] in trouble Alleluia they know something
[1:05:58] is fittin to take place the world speaks
[1:05:59] of it something is fixing to take place
[1:06:01] so in the Old Testament God seen in some
[1:06:05] of this trouble was accidentally done so
[1:06:08] if you're innocent and not guilty God
[1:06:09] makes a way for you if a man killed a
[1:06:12] man just deliberately and premeditated
[1:06:14] he was lost he could not come into this
[1:06:16] place but if he did accidentally he
[1:06:19] didn't mean to do it
[1:06:20] there was a City of Refuge
[1:06:22] God Himself set that up a City of Refuge
[1:06:26] that you could run and be safe
[1:06:28] could we get a lot of shout hallelujah
[1:06:32] and one of those place was Rama Gillian
[1:06:35] four places just replace the cities of
[1:06:38] refuge now the people could come into
[1:06:40] the city of refuge if they accidentally
[1:06:43] did something wrong he didn't mean to he
[1:06:45] would come to the city of refuge go to
[1:06:47] the gate the keyboard asking why you
[1:06:49] come in that was his idea of coming and
[1:06:51] then his case was pleaded and his case
[1:06:53] was pleaded at the kid and a man found
[1:06:55] to be innocent
[1:06:55] he did not willfully and the man was
[1:06:57] taken to the city as a place of refuge
[1:07:00] then the enemy could not get him and
[1:07:03] when God said have a place you could
[1:07:05] hide no enemy could get you I'm not
[1:07:09] talking about your thoughts I'm not
[1:07:11] talking about your ideas I'm talking
[1:07:13] about what God set up he has set up a
[1:07:15] way of escape he has set up a place of
[1:07:18] refuge where you could find shelter or
[1:07:22] glory dog or dam and we believe that if
[1:07:31] he done something wrong and was guilty
[1:07:33] his enemy have a right to come and they
[1:07:36] say if he was hold on to the horns of
[1:07:37] the altar is an email a privilege and I
[1:07:39] write that dragons on an altar and kill
[1:07:40] him because he was guilty
[1:07:43] premeditated course he said and then
[1:07:47] when once he cut in the city he could
[1:07:49] let off the pressure he was safe he was
[1:07:52] all right course there was a provided
[1:07:54] place for him God provided way for an
[1:07:56] innocent man not to be slain but to be
[1:07:58] exempted from this Lane because he
[1:08:00] accidentally did it he didn't mean to do
[1:08:03] it now if he meant to do it that's
[1:08:05] different now there are two classes in
[1:08:07] the world today there are men and women
[1:08:09] of the world today that really don't
[1:08:12] want to do the things they're doing and
[1:08:17] Jude identify some of that he say enough
[1:08:21] some have compassion making a difference
[1:08:26] now people who are in weakness weaken
[1:08:29] the flesh we can this be killed that and
[1:08:31] they struggling and the delegator my
[1:08:32] heart and they are different from people
[1:08:35] who are just babies I don't care so Jude
[1:08:40] said kind of some have compassion
[1:08:43] so let's continue now many women today
[1:08:46] who really don't don't want to do what
[1:08:48] they're doing they don't want to sin I
[1:08:51] feel sorry for them they don't want to
[1:08:53] do anything wrong but they do it they
[1:08:55] are drove to it no days are please for
[1:08:58] that person that wants to do right let
[1:09:02] me say that again there's a place for
[1:09:05] that person that wants to do right
[1:09:09] hallelujah there's a place the left of
[1:09:12] the pressure but there are some that
[1:09:14] doesn't even care
[1:09:15] that's different they don't care what
[1:09:17] they do did okay who see who know they
[1:09:19] don't care we're not talking about them
[1:09:21] we're talking about you who want to do
[1:09:25] right and Jude Ibaka Jude Jude and
[1:09:29] unbuttered you share this would mean
[1:09:31] that the four groups Iran is that they
[1:09:33] grew see talking about you talk about
[1:09:36] those that are sanctified and preserving
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ he said I believe it I give
[1:09:42] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:09:44] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:09:46] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:09:49] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:09:50] faith which was once delivered to the
[1:09:52] Saints in other words your loss if you
[1:09:54] don't have it fight for it the ones had
[1:09:56] it it was once I wrong that's why you
[1:09:58] could say how could somebody be adopted
[1:10:01] and there's no apostolate Church
[1:10:02] identified we have to go back to the
[1:10:04] Apostolic Church in all ways we have to
[1:10:06] go back to a church but the faith
[1:10:08] restored Febreeze a shout on that the
[1:10:13] Bible prophesied this faith gonna be
[1:10:14] here not talk say it not preach fit the
[1:10:17] real said what they had in ours there's
[1:10:20] gonna be an Apostolic Church but Jesus
[1:10:23] Christ walking in it the shout of the
[1:10:26] King will be in the camp
[1:10:29] or Chloe that God we believe that how
[1:10:32] many believe that glory to God so Jude
[1:10:35] was telling them fight for the faith

[1:49:37] little further
[1:49:38] alright let's continue he's talking
[1:49:42] about a sister in the church I want you
[1:49:45] listen carefully they go to
[1:49:48] this woman she went into the church
[1:49:50] she's done a very good job she was a
[1:49:52] piano player after a while she begins a
[1:49:56] noticed woman in our neighborhood begin
[1:49:57] to dressed immodestly how they get out
[1:49:59] and more they'll lay odds with a little
[1:50:01] clothes on
[1:50:01] I hope there's none of them here tonight
[1:50:04] it's a disgrace to you sister
[1:50:06] God be merciful to your sinful soul what
[1:50:10] else could do that but an evil spirit
[1:50:13] full of lust you don't want to think
[1:50:16] that but that's exactly the only person
[1:50:18] ever stripped their clothes off and Abed
[1:50:20] was a maniac put on clothes and act like
[1:50:23] a lady now the first thing you know she
[1:50:26] taught you a get by with that cause
[1:50:29] the rest of the woman and Chile's doing
[1:50:31] the same thing that's nice a donut just
[1:50:33] people in church by other people in the
[1:50:34] church judges serve by the world because
[1:50:37] that brother could be whatever condition
[1:50:39] you don't know what he doing it she
[1:50:41] doing it don't you do it listen she
[1:50:45] thought she would do it so she started
[1:50:47] to do with it that letter they begin to
[1:50:49] smoke cigarettes she tortured smoked
[1:50:51] cigarettes she continued playing there
[1:50:54] was nothing said too much about it
[1:50:55] around the church now remember keep
[1:50:58] telling you reason that a lot is Karen
[1:51:01] and message because they haven't seen
[1:51:02] judgment yet I've got the scripture for
[1:51:04] that and as decrease decreases eat
[1:51:07] listen to this because sentence against
[1:51:11] an evil book is not executed speedily
[1:51:15] therefore the heart of this son sermon
[1:51:18] is fully setting them to do evil you see
[1:51:26] God have a time to do things he said the
[1:51:29] cup of the amorous is not full the cup
[1:51:30] of iniquity
[1:51:31] when it's full then God sent judgment
[1:51:34] when it build up he just said run so
[1:51:37] people do the own thing when the
[1:51:40] children of Israel came out two million
[1:51:42] people enter rejoicing oh good we out of
[1:51:45] fear Oh God saw all them perishing
[1:51:50] accept Joshua and Caleb
[1:51:53] God knew they would feel but he pulled
[1:51:57] them all but in them had another
[1:52:00] generation as a seed in a German in them
[1:52:05] had another generation that was going to
[1:52:07] be born that was going to go into the
[1:52:09] Promised Land because God has to keep
[1:52:11] his word he has to pull him I bring them
[1:52:13] into the land and this land that we have
[1:52:15] is the land of Ephesians that the church
[1:52:17] must cross over into and the seven
[1:52:19] thunders is prophesied to bring us into
[1:52:21] that land where there is a perfect
[1:52:23] church where you are predestination
[1:52:25] there are interruption in that Ephesians
[1:52:28] husband loved their wives and Ephesians
[1:52:30] children obey their parents and
[1:52:31] Ephesians is a - ministry in Ephesians
[1:52:33] has one Lord one faith one baptism and
[1:52:35] it features we are no longer strangers
[1:52:37] but we are fellow citizens of the
[1:52:39] household of God or glory of god in
[1:52:42] Ephesians Christ the head of the church
[1:52:43] Oh glory to God the mystery will connect
[1:52:46] the body together heading about that all
[1:52:48] as in Ephesians that's the land we have
[1:52:50] to go in through not four inches not
[1:52:51] Galatians Ephesians that's the place
[1:52:54] that the faith is restored back to
[1:52:55] that's another Ephesus that's the Alpha
[1:52:58] bride or glory to God as we do mega have
[1:53:01] to go back to and pick up what they had
[1:53:03] or glory before going to the rapture we
[1:53:06] have to pick up what they had these are
[1:53:07] not prefer to mass back to the faith of
[1:53:09] the fathers but back to church back to
[1:53:11] the faith let me say it again not back

[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] Laurey
[1:54:12] they were joined church today we have
[1:54:15] any kind of life or anything but I tell
[1:54:16] you one thing you can't be born again
[1:54:19] and live any kind of a life you would
[1:54:22] live for Jesus Christ when you are born
[1:54:24] again you would act like a man you will
[1:54:27] conduct yourself as a real Christian if
[1:54:28] you're born again of the Spirit of God
[1:54:31] so this continued is a purpose I'm
[1:54:33] reading this I want you to stick with me
[1:54:34] right with me so this woman finally she
[1:54:37] fell in love with a man and liba run off
[1:54:41] marry this man
[1:54:43] continue playing peon in the church
[1:54:45] after while she left him and marry
[1:54:47] another one she taught her children all
[1:54:49] right finally she end up with a
[1:54:51] common-law wife what was it a soul to
[1:54:55] all her in the beginning don't do that
[1:54:57] but she reasoned now if the rest of the
[1:55:00] one can do this why can't I do it but
[1:55:02] don't you know soul was a spirits that
[1:55:05] don't do that keep away from that that's
[1:55:07] not right she fought against that cast
[1:55:12] that aside when two reasonin watch don't
[1:55:17] reason just believe God's will
[1:55:18] don't try to reason out just what God
[1:55:22] said is the truth and believe that to be
[1:55:25] the truth and don't go to your reasoning
[1:55:28] go to your experience to Christ in the
[1:55:30] heart and compared with God's Word so
[1:55:34] she went on and after a while she was
[1:55:35] called or the past over church was
[1:55:37] called to her bedside to prefer she was
[1:55:40] laying there smoking cigarettes
[1:55:42] everything living in the house a
[1:55:44] common-law wife he said sister is
[1:55:46] everything all right with your soul to
[1:55:48] die she said everything is at peace now
[1:55:52] she believed it she had went she had
[1:55:57] went so long with her intellect until
[1:56:00] she had grieve the Holy Spirit from her
[1:56:03] it was it no more spoke to her she
[1:56:07] didn't know what was right
[1:56:09] she had reasoned it out she had a mental
[1:56:13] conception that if she went to church
[1:56:15] and did what was right she would go to
[1:56:18] heaven then when on down to the very of
[1:56:21] debt oh this is the part when I get to
[1:56:25] when her reason power on the Prophet
[1:56:28] break-in you know when you die your
[1:56:31] brain breaks up of course when the
[1:56:35] spirit leaves you and then what's left
[1:56:38] he has your soul that you neglected back
[1:56:42] dear which comes to you then when you're
[1:56:46] dying and this mental reasoning breaks
[1:56:49] up you don't reason no more it's your
[1:56:53] soul that has been in your heart that
[1:56:57] you grieve the way and it caught up with
[1:57:00] her and when she did you scream my god I
[1:57:03] am lost let me say this way to you so
[1:57:08] you are trying being you have a body you
[1:57:11] have a spirit you have a soul that human
[1:57:15] spirit is given to you inside a deer is
[1:57:17] where you get reasoning memory
[1:57:19] conscience imagination so when somebody
[1:57:22] dies the human spirit breaks up in that
[1:57:28] human spirit is where you have your CXC
[1:57:30] UGC the degree a big house a big car
[1:57:32] your CEO your doctor your lawyer your
[1:57:36] pilot the engineer your aeronaut
[1:57:38] astronaut whatever it is all that
[1:57:40] position of power your president your
[1:57:42] Prime Minister all that is existent at
[1:57:44] the spirit level driving our Mosley's
[1:57:46] Benz driving a Rolls Royce whatever is
[1:57:48] all that isn't that space bill what
[1:57:51] people think they are how high they are
[1:57:53] how powerfully oh great they are oh
[1:57:55] mighty hope all for the families that's
[1:57:57] dear but in debt that spread bricks up
[1:57:59] and your soul comes up and the soul is
[1:58:02] who you really are
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:04] so this woman intellectually she
[1:58:07] believes she's right when it breaks up
[1:58:09] her soul comes up she's out my god I'm
[1:58:11] lost is to let them to let them the soul
[1:58:20] that has been grieved away don't let
[1:58:23] that be your state you mind God be born
[1:58:27] of the Spirit of God with reasoning
[1:58:30] things and believe what God said to be
[1:58:33] the truth be filled with God's Spirit
[1:58:35] and then God would lead you and the Holy
[1:58:38] Spirit would lead you in the path of
[1:58:40] righteousness or glory no thought so you
[1:58:43] already want to be led by your the
[1:58:44] spirit not just coming to church for a
[1:58:47] blessing because you'll find yourself
[1:58:51] lost people going to hell you know hell
[1:58:56] is the preaching this message but people
[1:58:57] go to hell for a bomb says yeah someone
[1:59:12] come to Elysee but about him do you
[1:59:13] think is wrong did was it anything I
[1:59:15] said why do you question about if
[1:59:18] there's a question in your mind leave it
[1:59:21] alone don't do it at all then you know
[1:59:26] you're right should I do this should I
[1:59:30] do that should I do this once a question
[1:59:32] and forget it kill it then don't do it
[1:59:34] on your right no I am positive sure this
[1:59:41] morning if men and women could only get
[1:59:45] into the position of where their soul
[1:59:49] their thinking their attitude will be
[1:59:54] perfect in the sight of God that would
[1:59:57] be one of the most powerful churches
[1:59:59] that ever existed
[2:00:02] that means this little group are you
[2:00:04] here tonight this could be one of the
[2:00:05] most powerful church that ever existed
[2:00:08] if we could catch the soul tinkin
[2:00:13] attitude perfect in the sight of God
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:25] he's a reason that a lie detector
[2:00:28] because man wasn't meat a life science
[2:00:35] developed this thing that he could put
[2:00:37] what kind of stuff on you and ask a
[2:00:39] questions and he could see it nice I did
[2:00:42] not steal the Apple and if I stole the
[2:00:45] Apple all the machinery so you know
[2:00:53] where Zack suffers truthful questions
[2:00:55] your name is so and so and so yes
[2:00:59] so it registers in correct you live at
[2:01:04] such as a house yes and then the athlete
[2:01:06] trick question oh did you booyah
[2:01:09] no and you shouldn't do so because it
[2:01:15] picking up something it detected
[2:01:18] something at the subconscious level the
[2:01:22] eyes wider people who could read what
[2:01:24] they call body language somebody talk
[2:01:27] enough of Oh a sudden the closer answer
[2:01:29] that mean to shut you down sometimes
[2:01:34] they have a little Quivers and these are
[2:01:36] uncontrolled reactions talking somebody
[2:01:39] in I won't make a flicks no day in the
[2:01:41] Murray I'm a big afflict unaware
[2:01:45] something exported and then they do like
[2:01:47] is not their mother it was regular smile
[2:01:49] you saw random you know that rise by
[2:01:51] saying is me that's why they could read
[2:01:55] those things because we are we are make
[2:01:57] up a certain way and we are reacting
[2:02:00] unconsciously
[2:02:03] and Fiat is the same thing when you have
[2:02:09] a genuine reaction of faith it is
[2:02:11] unconscious
[2:02:12] when they give the report about Jesus
[2:02:14] that the woman come my daughter is sick
[2:02:16] then somebody come and say mister your
[2:02:18] daughter dead he said oh by the way that
[2:02:20] I go wake her Jesus had no doubt
[2:02:23] whatsoever he was going on with her
[2:02:27] he had also get people out of the room
[2:02:29] but he was going to wake her unconscious
[2:02:39] waiting riding a bicycle for the first
[2:02:41] time
[2:02:41] good consciously adapting and hold on
[2:02:43] and fall and thinking after a while you
[2:02:46] don't even think twice to ride a bicycle
[2:02:48] you didn't think twice to drive a car
[2:02:50] you're tumbling on this drive you
[2:02:53] remember when your first was driving and
[2:02:54] he Lunas and your blinkin plenty of blue
[2:02:57] soup and he must say stop here and he
[2:03:00] pass me a stuff and money foods and you
[2:03:01] bounce the ball you can remember that no
[2:03:05] but you do all of that when I was
[2:03:07] learning but afterwards it become
[2:03:10] unconscious it becomes automatic but
[2:03:14] that's how the Christian life has to
[2:03:15] become it becomes automatic it comes
[2:03:20] from the subconscious level it's not you
[2:03:23] trying attendant to try and to be holier
[2:03:25] you trying to be right you're trying to
[2:03:29] be nice you're miserable inside but
[2:03:31] you're really trying your best your best
[2:03:35] sir okay try nothing but when you're
[2:03:41] born again of the Spirit it's something
[2:03:46] inside of you
[2:03:47] your wife will see it your husband will
[2:03:50] see it your children will see it
[2:03:52] somebody ought to see it this thing is
[2:03:54] is out this thing does LICO or glory no
[2:03:58] God hallelujah can't keep that to
[2:04:00] yourself the woman always said come see
[2:04:02] a man who told me all that I did is not
[2:04:06] this the Christ
[2:04:10] let's go
[2:04:11] so Lyon is a deceitful and a hard thing
[2:04:17] so oh it's an evil thing I rather have a
[2:04:22] drunkard would be a denier so you know
[2:04:27] liar lying at the bottom that was Bobby
[2:04:29] said no liars anything nah man say if
[2:04:32] you're lying stop the line get priyad
[2:04:35] forget is with a line over you alright
[2:04:41] but no matter how sinful you are you are
[2:04:45] still a fallen Son of God the most
[2:04:49] sinful person I see today
[2:04:51] God didn't intend you to be sinful he
[2:04:54] wanted you to be a son or daughter of
[2:04:56] his you made up you are made in his own
[2:05:00] makeup but sin has caused you to do that
[2:05:03] and no matter how much you try to
[2:05:05] impersonate try to make a lie see me
[2:05:07] right they got a scientific instrument
[2:05:09] that proves it still register negative
[2:05:11] because there's a subconscious dung in a
[2:05:15] human being and that's some conscious
[2:05:18] news what's the truth no matter what you
[2:05:22] were saying out here the subconscious no
[2:05:25] it's a lie and it registers of the
[2:05:28] subconscious therefore if a man or woman
[2:05:35] could ever get their thoughts and their
[2:05:38] testimony and their lives so line up
[2:05:41] with God on till the channel of the Holy
[2:05:46] Spirit would be so perfectly one with
[2:05:48] God what would take place if a man and
[2:05:51] woman could ever get lined up with the
[2:05:53] freedom from their heart with faith from
[2:05:56] the innermost faith from where the
[2:05:59] innermost Bible say I desire truth from
[2:06:03] the inward parts so the core don't wanna
[2:06:06] say God bless you and you don't mean it
[2:06:08] you're saying that because believers
[2:06:10] that say them words but you're ready
[2:06:12] hate the person you don't like the
[2:06:14] person but you're say that to get them a
[2:06:16] waterhole
[2:06:22] let's continue
[2:06:23] are you with me anybody sleeping get
[2:06:27] some toothpick and put all the eyes and
[2:06:28] roll it up like this many people come to
[2:06:32] the altar to be prayed for
[2:06:33] they have intellectual fee aha
[2:06:36] they confess your sins join a church by
[2:06:39] intellectual feet they believe it
[2:06:41] indiamain they believe it because it hid
[2:06:43] it they believe it because they know
[2:06:45] it's the best policy but not what God
[2:06:47] looks at he don't look after intellect
[2:06:50] your fate this one is a big one God
[2:06:55] looks at he looks on the heart where on
[2:07:04] the inside when it comes from the heart
[2:07:06] then all things are possible then oh so
[2:07:10] you mean really God want to really get
[2:07:12] what's inside of here yes it's better
[2:07:15] you say a cook and you're a liar and
[2:07:17] what not that God will respect that I
[2:07:19] love that got it coming from asada here
[2:07:21] then none alternate corruption inside of
[2:07:23] here and you're making hypocrisy but I
[2:07:26] do want to meet go to the hypocrite when
[2:07:30] the angel asked Jacob was the name I'm
[2:07:31] Jacob I'm a receiver I'm a con man I'm a
[2:07:34] trickster he could tell the angel the
[2:07:37] truth the rumor of the well she said I
[2:07:39] have none you see I spoke the truth
[2:07:40] because you had four and they wanted
[2:07:42] liver which is not yours that is what
[2:07:46] the Pharisees and strategies did not
[2:07:47] have they didn't have the right kind of
[2:07:50] a heart and God is looking at the heart
[2:07:52] outside they're looking very religious
[2:07:54] and looking pious but then they had
[2:07:57] crucify him crucify you see what come
[2:07:59] under the heart when jesus at the walker
[2:08:01] crucify him crucify him and their burial

[2:15:54] are we when the confession see is
[2:15:59] intellectual feet or let's go noona
[2:16:02] butter brown this is in the chip report
[2:16:05] I know first is a thought he spoke a
[2:16:08] word and when Jesus came out the hill he
[2:16:10] said no man either from this book a word
[2:16:11] he went on and then watch God's mind
[2:16:14] that mind that in the beginning was what
[2:16:17] was the thought before it was expressed
[2:16:19] on as a word but and every word in the
[2:16:22] Bible is God's thoughts leniency form
[2:16:24] and I said again every word in the Bible
[2:16:28] is God's thoughts lien in seed form
[2:16:34] every word that means God could
[2:16:37] interpret any scripture in your life let
[2:16:41] me say it again
[2:16:41] this is important listen you could go to
[2:16:44] give you a scripture and interpret that
[2:16:46] script in your life personally to you
[2:16:48] that have nothing doing anybody else
[2:16:50] [Applause]
[2:16:53] [Music]
[2:16:55] God forgive you i am the lord i got a
[2:16:57] seal at the ieu that is your word and
[2:17:01] you run with it and you heal all
[2:17:03] together just by your word from the Lord
[2:17:05] God give you that scripture and your
[2:17:06] he'll give you comfort this and give you
[2:17:16] a comfort in your heart and your spirit
[2:17:17] and your comforted by the Word of God
[2:17:20] let's continue every word in the Bible
[2:17:23] is God's thoughts linseed form and if
[2:17:26] received into the human being and spoke
[2:17:30] by the same thought that materialized
[2:17:33] the Bible it brings the things to pass
[2:17:35] you see what I mean how powerful could
[2:17:38] the church be the Bible said let this
[2:17:41] man that was in Christ being you allow
[2:17:45] it to be in you let it work through you
[2:17:48] claim it asks for it you once said you
[2:17:51] don't want your mind you want his mind
[2:17:54] and the Barbican of a be sure to have it
[2:17:56] by the Bible says let this mind I was in
[2:17:59] Christ
[2:18:00] Oh Chloe look god I expect more image
[2:18:02] than that it's in and let this mind ours
[2:18:05] and Christ be in you you're a writer
[2:18:08] have the mind of Christ nothing wrong
[2:18:12] for that nothing wrong in asking for
[2:18:14] that I want your mind in this matter I
[2:18:16] want your mind in the situation I want
[2:18:19] your mind as a mounting kit as a man
[2:18:33] thinketh in his heart so is he
[2:18:35] so your thoughts become expression your
[2:18:39] thinking
[2:18:40] so you're thinking literally have to do
[2:18:43] with the environment of your life and as
[2:18:48] a gardener tells a garden and kill your
[2:18:50] weeds and and war reason it's so you
[2:18:53] have to hold the weeds in your mind if
[2:18:55] you don't tend that garden the devil put
[2:18:58] seeds you'll get all kind of crop inside
[2:19:00] your mind and you'll read the harvest of
[2:19:02] what's in your mind and your spirit
[2:19:04] you're gonna speak it ain't gonna
[2:19:05] materialize you'll get a food of it but
[2:19:08] as a man taking his hearts always here
[2:19:10] or glory of God if you have evil
[2:19:13] thoughts evil thing in your mind and
[2:19:15] then take an old stuff you know I read a
[2:19:17] harvest of that because your mind like a
[2:19:21] garden not being clean not being cleanse
[2:19:24] not being challenged that's why the
[2:19:26] Bible said be transformed by the
[2:19:28] renewing of your mind
[2:19:30] Oh glory to God that you might prove
[2:19:32] what is that good and acceptable will of
[2:19:34] God your mind has to be renewed if you
[2:19:37] could get a changed mind you could get a
[2:19:38] change life if you could get a changed
[2:19:40] mind you could get a change walk they're
[2:19:42] gonna change Monica get a change talk
[2:19:44] but some people don't want to change
[2:19:46] their mind because they love all they
[2:19:48] think they love what they say they love
[2:19:50] what they do they can't be taught
[2:19:52] it can't be spoken to hallelujah praise
[2:19:57] hallelujah
[2:19:59] Jesus a half-eaten God for verily I say
[2:20:02] unto you if you shall say to this
[2:20:04] mountain be moved cast into the sea
[2:20:06] though doubt in your heart in your heart
[2:20:07] don't doubt that they don't don't don't
[2:20:10] wear nothing ahead in your heart
[2:20:12] you can have what you see is that right
[2:20:15] not me
[2:20:17] you shall have it what power has been
[2:20:20] given to the church
[2:20:22] no here we go I know this one is that'll
[2:20:25] teaching is a special service this
[2:20:26] morning
[2:20:26] I know it but I come to bring it now
[2:20:30] you can express this by mental
[2:20:32] conception by speaking the word and
[2:20:36] seeing it as anus but mental but if
[2:20:40] currently it becomes a real revelation
[2:20:44] of God you see it before it happens what
[2:20:53] about him describe Abram come into the
[2:20:54] fullness of believin so after 25 years
[2:20:59] of testifying I'm a son
[2:21:01] Elohim came known to tell Abram I will
[2:21:06] return unto thee according to the time
[2:21:09] of life it was your 25 years of testing
[2:21:13] is run out I come to give some
[2:21:15] encouragement I have come to give the
[2:21:17] man a reason right now I come to tell
[2:21:19] you every time is upon you it's a time
[2:21:21] of life so Abram was comforted just like
[2:21:25] when Jesus opened the understanding to
[2:21:27] his disciples open the words of
[2:21:29] disciples and comforted him with the
[2:21:32] word and said receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:21:33] and then tells Ellen sorry in the city
[2:21:36] of Jerusalem and till you bein to report
[2:21:39] from and high as just as Jesus released
[2:21:42] that to them they went up a joy the same
[2:21:45] Jesus was taken up but they were happy
[2:21:48] they were not sad no because their
[2:21:51] thoughts have been cleared up their
[2:21:53] revelation has been sealed in their
[2:21:54] heart they know what they was going to
[2:21:57] receive so they had no doubts in the
[2:22:00] upper room they were expecting the power
[2:22:02] from on high
[2:22:03] not a man shaking their hands power from
[2:22:05] on high they were under tremendous
[2:22:07] expectation or glory to God I went the
[2:22:11] day of Pentecost was fully come there in
[2:22:14] one man didn't want to caught you in one
[2:22:17] channel everybody on the same position
[2:22:19] or caught set so God said so the
[2:22:22] incursian one another but
[2:22:24] what the Lord said or give the Lord some
[2:22:27] praises fire came upon every one of them
[2:22:31] everyone received a portion I don't want
[2:22:34] every one of you today to receive your
[2:22:35] portion or glory of God hallelujah
[2:22:38] hallelujah
[2:22:41] so watch if it becomes a real revelation
[2:22:43] then you see it before it happened an
[2:22:46] express it in Word form that word takes
[2:22:49] a whole army in because material etat
[2:22:52] Express and when your heart listen and
[2:22:55] your mind is too filled with God's
[2:22:58] Spirit till your thoughts become his
[2:23:01] thoughts when your mind and your leaden
[2:23:03] and your guidance becomes a direct place
[2:23:06] or a direct inspiration of the Holy
[2:23:08] Spirit that is moving in your mortal
[2:23:11] peein what kind of people ought we to be
[2:23:13] it's not coming the church and bowling
[2:23:15] ball Jacob and Moses and Israel know

[2:23:46] only stress in life so when Jesus came

[2:38:56] reason that God that deliverance the
[2:38:59] only reasons I've got that ritual is
[2:39:01] because Abraham was in the season before
[2:39:05] God not because God come for a Latino
[2:39:08] because even ham because of who he was
[2:39:11] ah God said shall I hide from Abraham
[2:39:16] what I'm about to do because I kind of
[2:39:18] Aidan ah I cannot hide what I'm about to
[2:39:23] do from my elect that's why I should not
[2:39:26] forsake the assembling yourself together
[2:39:27] because revelations are gonna break from
[2:39:30] here that common reveal his will and his
[2:39:33] mind or glory to God hallelujah when
[2:39:38] Cole removes all he said I found a man
[2:39:40] after my own heart that will do my will
[2:39:45] so it's not a matter man after my heart
[2:39:53] and a heart to do his will
[2:39:59] do you have the kind of heart that
[2:40:02] you're willing to do God's will
[2:40:05] whatever God tell you to do you want to
[2:40:08] do it you're interested into it you want
[2:40:11] you out of the way assai that you like
[2:40:16] that God I never grew up before that's
[2:40:18] you that's the God what you want is his
[2:40:21] will as soon as Samuel anointed David
[2:40:29] the Bible said the Spirit of God came
[2:40:33] upon him he was anointed in the presence
[2:40:37] of his brethren all are my witnesses of
[2:40:41] the oil upon Stephen and David went back
[2:40:46] to a sheep anointed with God anointed
[2:40:52] with this all glory of God he wasn't in
[2:40:57] yet but he was anointed to be king and
[2:41:00] the Bible said God has made us kings and
[2:41:05] priests and we shall reign on earth and
[2:41:10] you wanna tell me I can't preach I got
[2:41:12] choked up just this morning when I know
[2:41:15] that he has made us dust it is his will
[2:41:20] it is his purpose it is his mine we be
[2:41:25] kings and priests all the potentials
[2:41:30] lock open sorry oh my god
[2:41:34] [Applause]
[2:41:41] prophecy a free to check where we G I
[2:41:55] believe it's on its Road when the church
[2:41:59] will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy
[2:42:03] Spirit mankind saw away from themselves
[2:42:07] that they don't see themselves but the
[2:42:10] see of God their thoughts move on they
[2:42:14] refuse the things of the world they just
[2:42:16] move in the spirit live in the spirit
[2:42:19] walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of
[2:42:23] Christ then the love of Christ in the
[2:42:25] human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[2:42:28] that great wonderful Church will go
[2:42:32] forward power and deity because deity
[2:42:35] will be revealed in human beings by by
[2:42:39] by the holy spirit bringing to pass the
[2:42:42] thought of their mind and the prophets
[2:42:46] that the ministry has reached its
[2:42:48] perfection when Christ is revealed again
[2:42:52] among human beings in the natural
[2:42:58] in other words the word has to become
[2:43:02] flesh again and when the word becomes
[2:43:07] fresh the invisible becomes visible god
[2:43:12] help me this morning let me say it again
[2:43:21] God was invisible until the wood becomes
[2:43:25] flesh and when the word become flesh the
[2:43:27] invasion will be considerable God
[2:43:30] becomes material so God want to get get
[2:43:33] man he want to get man out of the way
[2:43:35] Oh glory to God and quad remove all
[2:43:40] flesh resource out the kingdom you were
[2:43:42] to bomb them off knock them off he's
[2:43:46] gonna take them off and you're gonna
[2:43:48] raise up some David this is too much
[2:43:56] today when you come so dead to the
[2:44:06] things of the world that Christ is first
[2:44:10] Christ is all then your entire makeup is
[2:44:14] of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus he has
[2:44:17] full control that's when your torch will
[2:44:19] be clean your torch will be pure your
[2:44:23] heart some people say well religion
[2:44:25] comes from the heart he said there is no
[2:44:29] mental faculties called heart you can't
[2:44:32] think with your heart Bobby's a
[2:44:33] semantics in his heart and he said Jesus
[2:44:36] wasn't speaking of the physical being he
[2:44:39] was speaking of the supernatural being
[2:44:41] we are three for being soul but his
[2:44:44] spirit we know that this what his flesh
[2:44:46] is we realized is here we know what the
[2:44:48] spirit it is the spirit control the
[2:44:52] flesh but what is the soul he said the
[2:44:56] soul is the nature of the Spirit
[2:45:03] so born again means you'll need to
[2:45:05] change a new life
[2:45:09] Oh hallelujah if you notice here we go
[2:45:14] the subconscious is where you live
[2:45:20] not at the conscious level your real you
[2:45:24] is subconscious that's why you live
[2:45:27] that's the reason because it is hard for
[2:45:29] them to have faith
[2:45:30] yes I got faith but don't yet it seemed
[2:45:32] not for you well this fellow said I
[2:45:34] believe God heals and subconsciously but
[2:45:37] it's not for you you see are you sure
[2:45:40] you're not going anywhere you're
[2:45:41] undercut got a mind saying something but
[2:45:44] this spirit seen something else the nine
[2:45:46] saying I believe but the heart seen I'm
[2:45:49] effective on next week so there's a
[2:45:53] problem going on you notice is right but

[2:45:58] how did GC on his exe and adopt the
[2:46:00] degrees everything ideas Oh Daniel yeah

[2:46:06] here that is for God some people replace
[2:46:10] that too is for God but woman with money
[2:46:12] with popularity with basketball football
[2:46:14] cricket with love for this enough of
[2:46:17] that they love animals they put it to
[2:46:20] use for God that love to climb the climb
[2:46:21] in Mount Everest climb in here some some
[2:46:24] politics of God for parachuting the
[2:46:26] jumping from the sky all about together

[2:49:09] subconscious is your soul hallelujah
[2:49:13] must get there
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:20] the soul attracts what it secretly
[2:49:24] harbours that is why what a man says
[2:49:27] what you fear happen I want to believe

[2:50:18] what's around me what I have think
[2:50:23] differently we shouldn't go please I
[2:50:26] want to kind of so what your fate
[2:50:30] happens what you believe happens every
[2:50:35] thought soul that goes into the mind
[2:50:39] will have a route would have a fruit I
[2:50:42] will like can I do believe
[2:50:44] do you know believe you have to believe
[2:50:47] is not right glory to God
[2:50:50] so therefore truly circumstances doesn't
[2:50:53] make the man it shoes what the man is
[2:50:58] people have so much excuses about life
[2:51:00] this is why I saw my grandfather my
[2:51:03] grandmother the neighbor teachers in
[2:51:05] like middle school that way I didn't
[2:51:06] know that excuse you didn't want to
[2:51:10] learn I didn't have this I didn't have
[2:51:13] that there are people who pass exams
[2:51:14] under candlelight they study without
[2:51:18] electricity and tremendously successful
[2:51:20] because I had a passion to learn so
[2:51:23] somebody want to learn to pass their
[2:51:24] subjects on exam they have a passion a
[2:51:27] desire I believed that I could succeed I
[2:51:30] could make it even though the
[2:51:32] circumstance around me is very trying
[2:51:34] they never allow the things that stop
[2:51:36] them there was somebody at him born
[2:51:39] without hands and they qualified to be a
[2:51:40] lawyer write them with their feet
[2:51:42] because they are the intelligence to do
[2:51:44] it so the mountain right by the tools
[2:51:45] put the pen between the two and write
[2:51:47] and do the exams and so on and they
[2:51:48] wanted to go for exams
[2:51:49] yeah people over 80 has all finally got
[2:51:52] a degree because I always wanted to get
[2:51:53] a degree and they fulfilled that before
[2:51:55] they died they want to get a degree is
[2:51:56] what you want you could want to be a
[2:51:58] Christian more than everything else you
[2:52:01] can want to be on fire more than
[2:52:02] everything else you could want to be
[2:52:04] genuine more than everything else what
[2:52:06] is your passion this is a weak man with
[2:52:15] training could become strong with
[2:52:18] discipline could exercise and getting
[2:52:19] muscles and everything else just so a
[2:52:21] weak man cut between to become strong
[2:52:25] the birds may rest on your head and
[2:52:28] bring parts but don't lean and L&S fear
[2:52:30] don't be so weak for them to build up
[2:52:32] build nests in your head but I set the
[2:52:34] negative thoughts that you can't
[2:52:36] override angry that's why Hollywood is
[2:52:39] so dangerous even for the children
[2:52:40] they're to be careful with Hollywood
[2:52:42] because what can I say tonics and all
[2:52:44] kind of people write the movies but
[2:52:46] Hollywood is that channel to get tossed
[2:52:48] into my mind and so other songs and
[2:52:51] people have these things to company as
[2:52:52] there's new songs all day and they have
[2:52:55] messages in the songs as I've seen so
[2:52:57] into the songs the devil using any means
[2:53:00] necessary
[2:53:00] when you come to churches a little or
[2:53:02] two hours what time is that when you
[2:53:05] leave it at every problem your night and
[2:53:06] a 24/7
[2:53:09] getting this all the time you know
[2:53:10] that's why I have the resources on the
[2:53:12] internet to going to the channel and
[2:53:13] look back on YouTube are the messages
[2:53:14] they listen back to things are didn't
[2:53:16] hear talk wait back over that your mind
[2:53:19] be saturated with the world of God then
[2:53:22] when there's such every like that the
[2:53:23] development room to move because you are
[2:53:25] genuine believer Laurie no God so your
[2:53:32] mind can be cultivated Columbus
[2:53:37] unbelievable sailor will and he did it

[2:53:49] course when they tried to fly the first
[2:53:50] thing crashed it always does your first
[2:53:53] attempt that righteousness will crash
[2:53:54] but it always does but that don't stop
[2:53:56] you from pressing on they keep on
[2:53:58] pressing on when the Wright brothers try
[2:54:01] to fly people laugh for them but that's
[2:54:03] what we have a pins no because somebody

[2:54:17] and typhoid fever all the doctors that
[2:54:19] believed they could cut appear for that
[2:54:21] they did it because they believed it

[2:57:47] there the word but the word wasn't mixed
[2:57:50] with fate so everybody can be hearing it
[2:57:56] but it's those who are fatal mix that
[2:57:58] word to bring it on hallelujah the world
[2:58:04] has been transformed by visionaries I
[2:58:07] like that word visionary a visionary is
[2:58:10] somebody who caught a vision they may
[2:58:14] not have the money to fulfill it but
[2:58:15] they have it when Colonel Sanders got
[2:58:20] his recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken it

[2:59:24] close who already time now oh my my my
[2:59:34] that's subconscious that is gone quickly
[2:59:37] is where the fate lies
[2:59:39] that's subconsciously where your feet
[2:59:41] very nice what must I do for my family
[2:59:44] say Parabellum I want to receive the
[2:59:45] Holy Ghost I want to know what to do I
[2:59:47] am burdened for my family to be saved
[2:59:49] she's a sign a name are you burdened he
[2:59:51] said what must I do for my family use
[2:59:53] the same feet that you use it for
[2:59:55] yourself for your family commit them to
[2:59:57] the Lord and believe it with all your
[2:59:59] heart that you are going to be saved
[3:00:01] don't let it come down from your natural
[3:00:03] thinking here let it drop from inside
[3:00:05] that's subconscious then they are yours
[3:00:08] so when you fear for your family dropped
[3:00:12] from your subconscious then they're
[3:00:13] yours God give them to you when you cut
[3:00:16] it down here oh praise the name of the
[3:00:18] Lord do you believe that no watch my
[3:00:22] lord could you take a little more I want
[3:00:25] to ask permission to take a little more
[3:00:26] because I feel and the middle of
[3:00:27] something here and I can hardly drop off
[3:00:29] you know on my way
[3:00:30] watch watch the biggest part of our
[3:00:33] faith is mental feat by hearing the word
[3:00:35] it produced a mental recognition of God
[3:00:38] but if it ever strikes from by the Holy
[3:00:41] Spirit it becomes a spiritual faith
[3:00:44] hallelujah
[3:00:45] we believe that glory to God in the
[3:00:48] beginning was the world was really so
[3:00:49] watch when the Holy Spirit comes down
[3:00:51] then the word itself is pouring into a
[3:00:53] faith our mental feet become the spirit
[3:00:55] of Revelation and that become the rock
[3:00:57] see not coming to church because your
[3:00:59] father coming on your mother comment
[3:01:00] because you have a revelation oh that's
[3:01:02] why you come in your worship and because
[3:01:04] you have a revelation you know look and
[3:01:06] see who is in the hand who is in her or
[3:01:08] she raised her a charisma hand to know
[3:01:10] you raise your hand because you want to
[3:01:11] raise your hand you stand up because you
[3:01:13] want to stand up it has nothing to do
[3:01:15] with the person in front of you at the
[3:01:16] side of you
[3:01:17] you have your revelation or glory to God
[3:01:20] hallelujah
[3:01:21] we believe that so it's the Holy Spirit
[3:01:24] made at Ephesus church put the smyrna
[3:01:27] church the Holy Spirit gives the
[3:01:28] pokémons change all is the Holy Spirit
[3:01:30] it's been the Holy Spirit in his age and
[3:01:32] watch from your faith and then when the
[3:01:35] capstone comes the Holy Spirit ceases
[3:01:38] together so watch number one no more one
[3:01:41] coming from your mental fit tongue comes
[3:01:44] the Holy Spirit into your mental faith
[3:01:46] and mix it a spiritual fate
[3:01:48] hallelujah then the spiritual faith only
[3:01:51] recognizes the word hallelujah do
[3:01:55] believe that praise the name of the Lord
[3:01:57] the spiritual field only recognizes the
[3:02:00] world praise God and what something here
[3:02:03] to share with you Oh glory to God
[3:02:05] hallelujah praise God praise God Hebrews
[3:02:12] 10:26 says if we sin willfully after we
[3:02:16] have received the knowledge of truth
[3:02:18] there remains no more sacrifice for sin
[3:02:20] now the part I want to get here is the
[3:02:22] knowledge of the truth so the knowledge
[3:02:25] of the truth is not the truth yet until
[3:02:28] you get this spirit of the truth I want
[3:02:32] to get at in today you have to get the
[3:02:36] knowledge of the truth seven-season
[3:02:38] knowledge 700 knowledge mystery
[3:02:42] knowledge knowledge of the Bible it's
[3:02:44] none of the truth but when the spirit of
[3:02:47] truth comes that is the to knowledge
[3:02:51] because the knowledge could just opt to
[3:02:53] be all intellectual but when the spirit
[3:02:56] of truth um you have a revelation you
[3:02:58] have an experience not just truth but
[3:03:01] the Spirit of Truth and go7 he the
[3:03:04] Spirit is come he will lead you and
[3:03:06] guide you into all truth which is a
[3:03:09] continuation of the knowledge of truth
[3:03:10] or get the Lord us give the Lord a shout
[3:03:15] hallelujah because no you are empowered
[3:03:18] by the Spirit of Truth to get you into
[3:03:22] all truth no longer intellectual thing
[3:03:25] it's a personal revelation of God Oh
[3:03:28] hallelujah praise God thank you lord
[3:03:31] thank you lord
[3:03:32] Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things
[3:03:35] belong I did a lot of Oh God

[3:03:38] to us and to our children forever that
[3:03:41] we might do all the works of the Lord or
[3:03:43] glory to God literally that hallelujah
[3:03:46] so from your faith up to the Holy Spirit
[3:03:48] look at here fit up to the Holy Spirit
[3:03:51] that sees you in with Christ then you
[3:03:54] become one what then that's a sealed
[3:03:57] unit of the Lord God then they are

[3:04:32] almost done David was the poorest excuse
[3:04:35] there was he said stupid shoulder piece
[3:04:39] that sheepskin rock are wrong and he
[3:04:40] didn't not one of these big intellectual
[3:04:42] degrees well trained Saul was the best
[3:04:44] he could have had high hair a shoulders
[3:04:46] above dressy army for was a tall guy and
[3:04:48] today we know we need a revival we know
[3:04:51] we need us to LaMotta people it will not
[3:04:53] take a doctor with divinity it will take
[3:04:55] weaklings it will take it will take a
[3:04:57] weak person never take the Word of God
[3:04:59] in the power of Resurrection he said it
[3:05:01] will take we need a deeded untrained in
[3:05:04] theological schools we did a man who
[3:05:06] knows nothing about that some really pro
[3:05:08] boy somewhere somebody stooped rollers
[3:05:11] nothing much to look at but will come
[3:05:13] them with the power of God God is
[3:05:15] nothing big words God isn't on his hats
[3:05:18] say I am the higher and lofty one that
[3:05:20] were with him of our humble heart and of

[3:05:43] degrees by what education is not right
[3:05:45] by a dress by a unique ability and gifts
[3:05:49] but God has the ability to see inside
[3:05:52] the person's heart
[3:05:54] so when Elliot came in front of Samuel
[3:05:56] the Prophet and he said surely that is
[3:05:59] God's anointed God said no no no not so
[3:06:04] fast
[3:06:05] don't look at the outward appearance
[3:06:07] because I look in at the heart that
[3:06:11] gives Samuel a bit of discernment to see
[3:06:14] for the quick name power to give witness
[3:06:16] of the men that was passing me for him
[3:06:18] and brought her after brother pass until
[3:06:21] Samuel say isn't there anymore
[3:06:24] hallelujah God don't look at how tall he
[3:06:28] who MA he said I don't see us he doesn't
[3:06:31] see us human see or David was God's

[3:32:21] something in place for Christmas you
[3:32:26] know a luncheon slash dinner or so and
[3:32:29] so I'm bringing the official
[3:32:31] announcements on this this morning and
[3:32:36] stay in the spirit now so on Sunday
[3:32:42] December the 15th we want to have Church
[3:32:45] I call it an end of year and Christmas
[3:32:49] luncheon as well and the Selma d15 would
[3:32:54] also be 40 years of anniversary for
[3:32:58] burners the stove it as well so that
[3:33:02] that they will will truly be especially
[3:33:05] 40 years as a long time in 40 years of
[3:33:08] marriage place so what I have in front
[3:33:13] of me here is the Christmas menu for
[3:33:18] what is planned for that Christmas
[3:33:20] luncheon so you don't have to write it
[3:33:23] we will put it on the notice board
[3:33:26] downstairs but I did want to make clear
[3:33:31] what the plan is so that we could all
[3:33:33] endeavor to participate because we
[3:33:36] really want the entire church to be able
[3:33:38] to take part in this and I see here that
[3:33:45] a lot of thought and effort went into
[3:33:46] this so Xavier sliced leg of ham with
[3:33:50] whom a cha-cha big turkey breast slices
[3:33:53] with sorrel cranberry sauce big chicken
[3:33:57] with Italian tomato sauce big fish with
[3:34:00] a tomato sauce pastels beef chicken and
[3:34:04] vegetable stewed pigeon peas okay

[3:34:13] galloped potatoes tropical world of
[3:34:16] salad with a rice vinegar dressing
[3:34:18] frosted sponge cake or chocolate cakes
[3:34:21] whiz with

[3:34:28] of course sorrel and ginger and there'll
[3:34:32] be some additional drinks and stuff like
[3:34:34] that so how does this sound
[3:34:38] wonderful wonderful so we want to let
[3:34:42] the church know that we really want the
[3:34:46] entire church to be able to celebrate
[3:34:48] with this for this fantastic menu like I
[3:34:53] said it's not $300 it's 125 per person
[3:34:58] so we want to advise you on that for
[3:35:02] children who are under the age of 10 it
[3:35:05] will be $70 and for children under 5
[3:35:11] there will be no cost
[3:35:12] so it's please spread the word to those
[3:35:15] that are not here as well that on

[3:35:27] day and will also celebrate with brother
[3:35:30] oven and sister ovid on the 40 years
[3:35:33] anniversary as well and we look into
[3:35:37] have a wonderful time in the Lord as we
[3:35:39] close out 2019 and go into 2020
[3:35:44] I can even leave a say Matt Burch George
[3:35:45] I remember when I was in school this was
[3:35:49] before y2k where parents I used to be
[3:35:52] preaching in secondary school and
[3:35:53] telling my class means that the end is
[3:35:56] here the end is no we're not even going
[3:35:59] to get to write full levels because time
[3:36:04] is short and to see how God on fools
[3:36:08] time and yet still time is short but God
[3:36:12] allow us to get tested and tried and he
[3:36:14] gave us more time to see who were ready
[3:36:16] who learn and who will really give up
[3:36:18] because some of us years ago he came
[3:36:20] then we was there you know
[3:36:21] but as he give us time we get caught up
[3:36:23] in different things so God allows time
[3:36:25] to see 20/20 I remember writing an essay
[3:36:29] for he levels on what will happen with
[3:36:33] why Tookie only remember that anybody
[3:36:35] and I remember that but in the year 2000
[3:36:38] everything was switched off a rota SI
[3:36:41] for general paper that the zoo would get
[3:36:43] unlocked because they wouldn't be able
[3:36:45] to keep all the other ones inside and
[3:36:48] all the trains will crash and you know
[3:36:51] because you have no idea because you
[3:36:52] will come in that era to see how it's
[3:36:55] it's your spirit of age the Lord Allah
[3:36:58] is coming you know so people taking it
[3:37:00] all easy but as you look at 2020 I
[3:37:02] recognize that the rabbits are less
[3:37:04] squad cut they work short you know he
[3:37:07] wouldn't be able to preserve the elect
[3:37:09] so it's for the elect see that he would
[3:37:11] have to cut to work short but it makes
[3:37:13] you wonder as you approach 2020 and all
[3:37:16] these years after the prophets left that
[3:37:18] you have to cherish the moments you have
[3:37:20] because we wouldn't have these
[3:37:21] opportunities all the time but a random
[3:37:24] taught us one day it'll be the last
[3:37:25] service it'll be the last song it'll be
[3:37:28] the last service preached you know
[3:37:30] because he's seasoned with cheese and we
[3:37:32] wouldn't be able to gather this way
[3:37:33] anymore so we thank God for the
[3:37:34] opportunities when we can gather to come
[3:37:37] together in his presence and fellowship
[3:37:39] and be able to smile and an Amber dear
[3:37:41] madam as we're over the speaker man in
[3:37:43] his introduction he term with the
[3:37:44] pressure but ambition a message letting
[3:37:46] off the pressure you know I mean this is
[3:37:49] the place to let off the pressure you
[3:37:50] can tell me a coma - I mean stressed
[3:37:52] indigenous - just not a place to be
[3:37:54] stress you come to church to let off the
[3:37:56] pressure so that when you leave here but
[3:37:58] I ran a picture I said why are we so
[3:38:00] tossed about so when you come here you
[3:38:02] come to get anchored do you come to get
[3:38:03] relaxed you come to bask in your
[3:38:06] presence knowing that your brother next
[3:38:08] to you these sister next to you might be
[3:38:10] going through similar trials and I never
[3:38:11] go to more trials and you just keep in
[3:38:13] your face straight so you don't see how
[3:38:15] much tragedy going through but some two
[3:38:18] great travel all through the blood and

[3:38:22] testings because it's to really shape
[3:38:24] our character so we could we could leave
