[46:43] actualized for this promises to be
[46:46] fulfilled for this process to put on
[46:50] fresh and walk in Amira's for this
[46:55] promises to become material we need the
[47:00] Spirit of God as he has told us here
[47:03] because these promises are in a word
[47:05] phone
[47:06] in a letter phone but verse chapter 3
[47:10] verse 5 disease not that we are
[47:13] sufficiently or give us hope and such
[47:15] trusts have we through Christ to God one
[47:18] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[47:20] to think anything of ourselves but our
[47:23] sufficiency is of God who also has made
[47:28] us able ministers of the New Testament
[47:31] not of the letter but of the speed for
[47:35] the letter kills but the Spirit gives
[47:37] life so now we have all these promises
[47:41] in later phone any written form on that
[47:47] tips and spoken or body books
[47:49] manner promises statue of the perfect
[47:52] man alone he tellus is we see the
[47:55] promises he gave us there he said number
[47:58] one we sure we shall be who shall be an
[48:01] affliction of Jesus Christ before the
[48:04] rapture takes place number two in that
[48:06] message city of the perfect man he says
[48:08] we shall be not only the reflection of
[48:11] Jesus Christ but the number two he says
[48:12] we shall be a powerhouse and then he
[48:15] goes on to say and he says we shall be a
[48:18] living monument of the Living God and
[48:21] living movie Idol on earth
[48:24] a monument is always used to remind the
[48:31] people of some important person who is
[48:35] not visible that's why they put
[48:38] monuments in different cities of the
[48:40] world about great men like Churchill
[48:42] great men like King Nelson Mandela but
[48:45] men like samurai Michelle a few years
[48:48] about five years ago I was in Mozambique
[48:50] and I found in every biggest city they
[48:53] had they had monuments of Samara
[48:56] Michelle the man that lady named in the
[49:00] walk a chemist the Portuguese in order
[49:03] for Mozambique to attain its
[49:05] independence so in order to remain to
[49:07] remind him you know to remind the name
[49:10] of someone else Michelle who died in a
[49:13] plane crash they had to put monuments
[49:15] everywhere but now God also in the
[49:19] stretch of the perfect man he says the
[49:22] bride who will be a living monument of
[49:24] the Living God which unmeaning says we
[49:27] shall be a living
[49:29] item and living I know of God on earth
[49:32] and then he says we shall be a
[49:35] powerhouse who shall be any fraction of
[49:38] Jesus Christ comedies have great
[49:40] promises in the pond attempts and in the
[49:42] spoken white book they are in later
[49:44] phone and then he goes on to say we
[49:46] shall be a living temple of the Living
[49:49] God God and which God dwells through
[49:53] which God walks
[49:55] through which God speaks through which
[49:58] gold wax we shall be a living temple of
[50:02] the Living God through in which God
[50:04] dwells in which God speaks in the
[50:06] mythical works let's submit a name of
[50:09] the Lord and then he goes on and says we
[50:11] shall be a living we shall be a
[50:14] manifestation in one mess extent of the
[50:17] perfect man it brings all this function
[50:19] we shall be a manifestation of the
[50:21] Living Word of the Living God
[50:23] then when we go to the seven churches
[50:25] blessed be the name of the Lord in the
[50:27] center changes back to 50 he says we
[50:30] shall be in God we shall be in Gordie's
[50:32] he stayed on earth which shall be the
[50:35] one taking his place on earth then peg
[50:38] to 439 and 240 he says we are the elect
[50:42] and wish we shall be the ones that truly
[50:45] manifest the Lord on earth but these are
[50:49] own promises this is all in the letter
[50:52] firm on that tapes and spoken word
[50:56] ebooks in order for them to become
[50:59] material in order for these promises to
[51:01] be manifested in order for this process
[51:03] to be vindicated to be actualized to be
[51:06] materialized to come to come to pass we
[51:09] made it a spirit and the Spirit is the
[51:12] type of life they dynamics the
[51:15] quickening power to live them that word
[51:18] to quicken that word to give life to
[51:21] that Waja to those promises
[51:23] so negative 3/14 Sancho Genesis talks
[51:26] about the bride as the Enoch he talks
[51:28] about the bride of the city as the ones
[51:30] that will truly the one who as the ones
[51:34] that would truly manifest the Lord the
[51:38] private video who do not only be the
[51:40] elect of this day but don't be the ones
[51:42] that truly
[51:44] manifested the Lord can you believe that
[51:47] the bride will be the one that truly
[51:49] manifested a lot in these closing hours
[51:51] from now to the rapture in between there
[51:54] we have to manifest the launch to the
[51:57] world the world has to come to a
[51:59] realization that if there is God God is
[52:02] no way
[52:03] is he's with us and then he calls on to
[52:06] say Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[52:08] it goes on to say we shall be and goes
[52:11] up to say that we shall be his body
[52:14] we shall revisit boys and we shall
[52:17] perform his works we shall be his body
[52:20] we shall perform his OSB we shall be his
[52:23] body we shall be his divorce we shall
[52:25] perform his works and in the same some
[52:27] interchanges and the penguin chat egg he
[52:30] says we shall be a super church a super
[52:33] race PEGI 3 4 again he says that we
[52:37] shall be we are we are we are another
[52:39] people he speaks about us as another
[52:41] people in the land who under their
[52:43] messenger shall be the final voice to
[52:46] the final a therefore my brother my
[52:48] sister but it detects the sphere these
[52:51] promises this is the mechanics this
[52:53] promises and the seed the seed 1 the
[52:58] mechanics what will mean is the dynamics
[53:02] and the coming of the dynamics that is
[53:05] the time of life to quicken those
[53:07] promises to live in those promises to
[53:10] make those promises and life to give
[53:13] those promises life in order to manifest

[1:01:55] the end of the service we won't forget
[1:01:58] to give you all the honor the praise in
[1:02:01] the glory for we ask it in the name of
[1:02:03] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen
[1:02:07] so are we staying in I have three
[1:02:09] portions of scripture to read Genesis 18
[1:02:12] 12 to 14 first Thessalonians 5 1 to 5
[1:02:18] Hebrews 12 25 to 28 so I'll start with
[1:02:23] Genesis 18 and we read from verse 12 and
[1:02:32] we all know the story this was when
[1:02:35] Abram was sitting with his back to the
[1:02:37] tent and when he discerned therefore
[1:02:42] Sarah loved within yourself saying after
[1:02:46] him works all shall I have pleasure my
[1:02:50] lord being old also in the Lord said
[1:02:53] unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh
[1:02:56] say inshallah I of a surety pay a child
[1:03:01] which I'm old verse 14 is anything too
[1:03:06] hard for my lord at the time appointed I
[1:03:10] will return unto thee according to the
[1:03:13] time of life in Sarah shall have a son
[1:03:18] amen then we go to Thessalonians chapter
[1:03:22] 5 and we read from verse 5 Thessalonians
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:44] but of the times and of the seasons
[1:03:47] brethren you have no need that I write
[1:03:49] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:03:52] there the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:03:55] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:03:59] say peace and safety then sudden
[1:04:01] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:04:04] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:04:07] not escape but he brethren are not in
[1:04:10] darkness there this day should overtake
[1:04:12] you as a thief ye are all the children
[1:04:16] of light and the children of the day we
[1:04:20] are not over the night know of darkness
[1:04:25] many Bruce chapter 12 and we read from
[1:04:33] verse 25 see that it refused not him
[1:04:38] that speaketh if he they if they escaped
[1:04:43] not who refused him that spake on earth
[1:04:46] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[1:04:50] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[1:04:53] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[1:04:56] he hath promised saying yet once more I
[1:05:00] shake not the Earth only but also even
[1:05:03] in this word yet once signified the
[1:05:08] removing of those things that are shaken
[1:05:11] as of those things that are made that
[1:05:14] those things which cannot be shaken may
[1:05:18] remain this is my title
[1:05:23] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[1:05:26] cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:05:29] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:05:32] reverence and godly fear make order a
[1:05:36] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:05:38] may be seated
[1:05:40] amen so I'd like to take a title tonight
[1:05:48] so I just remove my jacket
[1:05:56] as I take it title tonight we receive a
[1:06:00] kingdom that cannot be moved and I got a
[1:06:03] subject tonight you got to know the hour
[1:06:08] that we are living in and then I have a
[1:06:11] subject is anything too hard for the
[1:06:15] Lord in the time of life and I trust
[1:06:20] that the message will be a blessing to
[1:06:22] you so I've got a POTUS to open up and
[1:06:25] I'm gonna read quite a few quotes so I
[1:06:28] trust it you will stay with me and then
[1:06:31] God that God will bless you he says yeah
[1:06:35] and unbelief does not in the God a very
[1:06:37] short quote he says in the last days
[1:06:40] what is it gonna take
[1:06:42] it's gonna take a stand to take a stand
[1:06:46] is a scriptural train Church right on
[1:06:51] the line so that's what it's gonna take
[1:06:53] for the church to be stayin in this last
[1:06:57] days is a scriptural trained church
[1:07:01] train so listen to that then it says
[1:07:03] here in modern events made clear by
[1:07:05] prophecy he says this word and is posi
[1:07:09] pray Mia
[1:07:09] he says and father as we open this word
[1:07:12] now speak to us directly out of this
[1:07:15] word that we might know the hour that we
[1:07:18] are living in he says if we know the are
[1:07:22] we loving in then we can prepare for
[1:07:25] that hour but if we go in blindly not
[1:07:29] knowing what away then we don't know how
[1:07:32] to prepare so father we pray that you'll
[1:07:36] let us see the ark there and the door
[1:07:39] open and the Machine colic and the
[1:07:41] message calling us in granted through
[1:07:44] Jesus Christ's name Amen that's what he
[1:07:47] says so he says here now Lord how can we
[1:07:50] prepare we need to know how show us God
[1:07:53] he says if we do it we're gonna do it
[1:07:56] blindly not known way to go but show us
[1:07:59] the hour and that is my point and just
[1:08:02] just to if
[1:08:04] read John 17 verse 1 Jesus was speaking
[1:08:09] and he was princes his father the hour
[1:08:11] has come now to me Jesus narrowed it
[1:08:15] down to the hour and what's so important
[1:08:18] friends if you see we know our
[1:08:20] dispensation we know our age we live in
[1:08:22] him but we got to know the hour in the
[1:08:25] agent in the dispensation how far are we
[1:08:29] up in the hour Jesus says my hours come
[1:08:32] he never spoke there before but when he
[1:08:34] knew the time was drawing eyes his
[1:08:36] father that always come and friends I
[1:08:39] want to say we have narrowed it down
[1:08:41] God is narrowed it down to the hour that
[1:08:45] has come he says here in modern events
[1:08:48] made clear by prophecy it says and you
[1:08:50] can be ever so sincere but until you
[1:08:53] know what you are doing you are fighting
[1:08:56] the air come back into the Word of God
[1:09:00] and get lined up then you know like a
[1:09:05] soldier he don't know what to do until
[1:09:07] he gets orders to do it we must be
[1:09:10] Christian soldiers and get orders from
[1:09:12] the Bible for the hour this is a prophet
[1:09:15] narrows it down to the hour now not the
[1:09:18] charge of yesterday the charge the day
[1:09:21] before but the charge for today he says
[1:09:24] we got to know the charge for today not
[1:09:28] the one of yesterday not one of before
[1:09:30] but the charge of the very hour find out
[1:09:33] that our a comes again that we live in
[1:09:36] in these modern events is helping by so
[1:09:40] swiftly and one day we're gonna find out
[1:09:43] that we are left behind without nothing
[1:09:46] and be caught sealed in the with the
[1:09:49] mark of the beast before we even know it
[1:09:52] so he says these modern events is
[1:09:55] slipping by so fast that he says one day
[1:09:59] we're gonna find out who I left behind
[1:10:01] because we didn't take note of the
[1:10:05] events that is happening so I say again
[1:10:07] let's zero in on the hour that we are
[1:10:10] living in he says here and with with
[1:10:13] patience we have to wait for this for
[1:10:16] the prophecies that spin
[1:10:18] almost every one of them must be
[1:10:20] fulfilled in its age hallelujah
[1:10:23] he says and you look at God's Bible and
[1:10:26] see what age we living in we're not
[1:10:28] living in the Methodist age all the
[1:10:30] Baptist age we're living in the pride
[1:10:33] age hallelujah brothers can we say that
[1:10:36] again we living in the pride age the
[1:10:40] calling the bringing back to God through
[1:10:43] the channel he promised to bring it back
[1:10:45] in he promised to do it so God is
[1:10:49] calling us out into the pride age we're
[1:10:52] not in the Methodist age we're not even
[1:10:54] in the latest in church age between the
[1:10:57] pride age and it says here again in
[1:11:01] mid-morning events made clear by proxy
[1:11:03] this Bible foretells the prophecy what
[1:11:06] day that we live in in and what time we
[1:11:09] live in in what kind of events watch
[1:11:11] what he says what kind of events ought
[1:11:14] to be taking place it foretells it
[1:11:16] exactly to the letter and it's not miss
[1:11:19] one age all the time not one time has it
[1:11:23] ever must it won't for we are
[1:11:27] predestinated to see it those that are
[1:11:30] predestinated to see it will see it so
[1:11:34] brother sister is come exactly right
[1:11:37] down to where the Bible says that every

[1:21:28] yet it comes again that plague was
[1:21:32] forbidden to strike anyone that had the
[1:21:35] seal of God that's what we are striving
[1:21:37] for now to get in and be positionally
[1:21:42] placed hallelujah into the kingdom of

[1:22:23] the Bible that there would be a time
[1:22:24] come for those who are not in this
[1:22:27] wonderful sunlight watch that the fowls
[1:22:30] of the air so now he's bringing a
[1:22:32] difference and we read the scripture in
[1:22:34] Ephesians we are not children of
[1:22:37] darkness we're children of light yeah a
[1:22:39] brother in says I am told in the Bible
[1:22:41] they would come a time for those who are
[1:22:44] not in this wonderful sunlight that the
[1:22:46] Falls of the air will eat of the flesh
[1:22:48] of them there the Jesus on the road that
[1:22:51] the doctors would never be able to stop
[1:22:53] it's the plagues of God and and right
[1:22:58] now scientists are looking doctors
[1:23:00] everyone is looking to find a remedy a
[1:23:03] cure for this covert 19 whatever they
[1:23:06] call it and and nothing is helping all
[1:23:10] across the world and brother Branham
[1:23:13] says here he says here that he says and
[1:23:15] that the doctors will never be able to
[1:23:18] stop it
[1:23:19] it's the place of God he says yeah then
[1:23:23] Jesus came diseases are happening and
[1:23:26] everything is taking place well we don't
[1:23:28] know what to expect the doctors don't
[1:23:31] know what to call the disease so they
[1:23:33] see saying they say it's a virus what is
[1:23:37] a virus also doctor
[1:23:39] it's something that he doesn't know
[1:23:41] nothing about he just says it's a virus
[1:23:44] that's all they is he says now what's
[1:23:48] this words there's little old bug demons
[1:23:51] that's flying now you look at the scar
[1:23:54] on the violence it's fine right in the

[1:23:59] mean this was what he did he bridges 57
[1:24:02] already he preaches he says these are
[1:24:04] little old bugs demons so this covert 19
[1:24:08] is nothing else but demons the
[1:24:11] scientists can't find the remedy they
[1:24:13] don't even know what it is they can't
[1:24:15] put it down
[1:24:15] and every time they don't think they
[1:24:17] have it it breaks into something else
[1:24:19] and promises is demons fine that man
[1:24:22] never heard of before no one heard of
[1:24:24] this before

[1:24:40] fulfilled hallelujah

[1:29:30] here that brother Branham says they put
[1:29:32] on masks the whole world is wearing
[1:29:34] masks the whole world is walking with
[1:29:36] sanitizers and the prophecies in 1964
[1:29:40] it's not gonna work these brother
[1:29:42] branham's see this day 2020 yeah we are
[1:29:46] living it we see any brother it's not
[1:29:48] working the doctors don't have an answer
[1:29:51] why he says God made a provided way
[1:29:55] hallelujah and it was what the blood of
[1:29:59] Jesus Christ oh there's the provided way
[1:30:01] today brother sister coming to Jesus
[1:30:04] accept him as your Savior he says the
[1:30:07] only place he says here
[1:30:08] God made a provided way and that was the
[1:30:11] blood God provided it as simple as it is
[1:30:14] seemed it takes the blood of a lamb to
[1:30:18] sprinkle on the door
[1:30:19] and yet God says he says yeah and in
[1:30:22] that way he honored it and all out from
[1:30:25] the blood died the firstborn and that's
[1:30:28] Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 when Israel
[1:30:31] slew lamb in there to apply the blood
[1:30:33] what was it that was God's provided way
[1:30:37] to protect them from the plague they had
[1:30:41] the token which was an assurance that
[1:30:43] they had nothing to worry about no
[1:30:45] matter how many plates talk whatever
[1:30:47] else says they were sealed away
[1:30:50] hallelujah and Israel coming out of
[1:30:53] Egypt as I said of humans goods a type
[1:30:55] of the bride coming out of the church
[1:30:57] when Moses begin his ministry Israel
[1:31:00] gathered together in one place in Goshen
[1:31:03] and begin to play because they note that
[1:31:06] the hour was at the end works he comes
[1:31:08] back to the hour comes right back to the
[1:31:12] hour and says because they knew the hour
[1:31:14] was at hand you see they were 400 years
[1:31:17] in captivity in Egypt but they knew
[1:31:20] there was coming a time they're gonna
[1:31:21] leave so it came down to the hour and
[1:31:23] write that our God required the token
[1:31:26] and that's when they were safe brother I

[1:49:55] first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom
[1:50:00] of God is not in word but in power
[1:50:02] hallelujah
[1:50:04] the kingdom of God is in word me the
[1:50:06] king of God is the word made power what
[1:50:09] is the kingdom of God it is within you
[1:50:12] the kingdom is you
[1:50:13] is in you and when the word comes in
[1:50:16] there what does the word begin it turns
[1:50:18] itself into power making it say exactly
[1:50:21] what it said so the kingdom comes in to
[1:50:25] you the word and what does it do it
[1:50:27] turns itself into power so brother you
[1:50:29] not just walk in there he says the
[1:50:31] kingdom of God is not in word only but
[1:50:33] it is in power so when the word comes in
[1:50:37] power comes in you and that word in you
[1:50:40] turns itself into power and you're gonna
[1:50:42] see later when we strike Abram when the
[1:50:44] word came with him it turned that word
[1:50:46] that was enemy into power the word in
[1:50:49] you then that's why the Bible says the
[1:50:52] raptures already in you adoption is
[1:50:55] already in you that's the word of God
[1:50:58] it's gonna turn itself into power and
[1:51:00] Wonder you be adopted one day you be
[1:51:03] raptured wonder you be changed you'll be
[1:51:05] healed the word in you turns itself into
[1:51:08] power hallelujah
[1:51:10] Oh beautiful easy brother oh yeah I
[1:51:13] believe she's ready to strike that final
[1:51:16] climate yonder to bring forth afraid a
[1:51:19] tour wraps of the church into glory and
[1:51:21] she's laying in the messages we're
[1:51:23] really at the end time now listen what
[1:51:26] he says we talked about it and
[1:51:28] everything but the thing is moved upon
[1:51:31] us now so in other words we spoke about
[1:51:34] these times coming preachers will
[1:51:36] remember they preached about it you can
[1:51:38] play back tapes that you preached way
[1:51:40] back so many years he says we talked
[1:51:42] about it and everything but the thing is
[1:51:44] moved upon us we can see now with us
[1:51:46] virus with us cover 19 we can see it's
[1:51:50] moved upon us now the thing we spoke
[1:51:52] about it now it's time for manifestation
[1:51:55] now God must come on the scene you know
[1:51:57] friends to have apostolic times we must
[1:52:00] have apostolic conditions we must have
[1:52:04] episodic times so I believe this God
[1:52:07] allowed it to happen
[1:52:08] to get the brides attention so that we
[1:52:11] can become more desperate more sincere
[1:52:13] more make our calling and election sure
[1:52:16] to make sure that we are in the faith
[1:52:18] and I believe he says here that this
[1:52:21] thing has moved upon us now here we are
[1:52:23] the end time the red lights down fresh
[1:52:25] coming of the Lord is at hand
[1:52:27] the endtime message should meet endtime
[1:52:31] conditions so no matter what state the
[1:52:37] world comes or gets into the endtime
[1:52:39] message must meet endtime conditions
[1:52:43] so he said agreement is so bad I don't
[1:52:44] know what to know the message will meet
[1:52:47] the endtime conditions no matter how
[1:52:49] frothy becomes it raises a standard all
[1:52:52] the time and you raise with the standard
[1:52:54] hallelujah he says yeah we need the
[1:52:57] voice of God today to meet the need of
[1:52:59] the hour to meet the time that we are
[1:53:02] living in and after years promises we
[1:53:04] can rest assured that he will keep his
[1:53:07] promise
[1:53:08] that's the conference that the believer
[1:53:10] has in his maker that he promised to
[1:53:13] meet the need so this message will meet
[1:53:16] the need of the hour and I believe we
[1:53:20] have the standard with us hallelujah now
[1:53:24] I'm gonna strike my final my inspiration
[1:53:30] God made an unconditional covenant with
[1:53:33] Abram and he told him you're gonna have
[1:53:35] that baby now watch friends I don't know
[1:53:38] go to all the scriptures and I'm sure
[1:53:40] that other ministers will be doing that
[1:53:42] so I'm just gonna eat it and he may it
[1:53:45] says after he made the promise to Abram
[1:53:47] he says every morning Abram he believed
[1:53:50] God so much that when he woke up in the
[1:53:53] morning he said when he shook his hair I
[1:53:56] said Sarah how do you feel this morning
[1:53:58] there was this ain't nothing honey
[1:54:00] he says April say praise God we're gonna
[1:54:03] have that baby brother Abram the Bible
[1:54:06] says staggered not through unbelief but
[1:54:08] was strong in faith giving praise to God
[1:54:12] there's a difference of having faith you
[1:54:14] can have faith but its weak faith when
[1:54:17] the Bible says Abram was strong in faith
[1:54:20] now I'm speaking of strong faith that
[1:54:22] even if it didn't happen you still ain't
[1:54:24] God praise God I'm we gonna have that
[1:54:27] baby you might be sick praise God I'm
[1:54:29] gonna be healed
[1:54:30] tomorrow morning you wake up which so
[1:54:32] there I am and praise God I'm gonna be
[1:54:34] here hallelujah I'm gonna be delivered
[1:54:37] I'm gonna be set free
[1:54:39] you know you have strong faith like
[1:54:41] Abram because you the royal seed of
[1:54:43] Abraham hallelujah every morning you
[1:54:45] wake up how do you feel honey please
[1:54:47] nothing
[1:54:48] praise God we're gonna have that baby
[1:54:51] that's the royal seed of Abraham we're
[1:54:53] gonna have that promise every promise in
[1:54:55] the Bible belongs to you and me my then
[1:54:59] he came to Abram this was now after 25
[1:55:02] years look at it and like I say if you
[1:55:04] read the whole story many people know it
[1:55:06] but Genesis 17:1 he came to Abram and
[1:55:09] the Bible says Abram was 99 years old
[1:55:13] and 9 in other words was 99 years old
[1:55:16] the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto
[1:55:19] him like this woods I am The Almighty
[1:55:22] God Oh hallelujah this is three things
[1:55:27] that impressed me first
[1:55:28] he's telling Avram Abram you 99 now it's
[1:55:31] 25 years is gone it's older it's more
[1:55:34] impossible for the promise to come to
[1:55:37] pass but now he tells a rimless and
[1:55:39] Abram
[1:55:39] I'm the Almighty God walk before me and
[1:55:43] be thou perfect hallelujah what the
[1:55:47] promise at 99 years old he comes to
[1:55:50] Abram and it seems impossible
[1:55:52] Abram waited so long the critics mocked
[1:55:55] him they they criticized him they made
[1:55:58] fun of him but yeah God appears him at
[1:56:00] the ripe old age when you think nothing
[1:56:02] is going on
[1:56:03] don't you worry Elohim will come your
[1:56:06] way friend and he says Abram I'm
[1:56:08] Almighty God and brother says if that
[1:56:10] meant El Shaddai he was the breasted one
[1:56:14] in other words Abram lay on my bosom and
[1:56:17] nurse yourself to a new body he says
[1:56:20] that's what it meant ever met to nurse
[1:56:22] himself just lay on my bosom be at rest
[1:56:25] I know you're old I know it seems
[1:56:27] impossible but you lay on my breast and
[1:56:30] nurses that's all we gotta do at this
[1:56:33] time don't panic
[1:56:34] don't worry what's gonna happen what's
[1:56:36] gonna take place next lay on the bosom
[1:56:38] of Elohim and nurse yourself to a new
[1:56:41] body hallelujah
[1:56:42] what was the next words walk before me a
[1:56:46] listen friend what a beautiful story
[1:56:49] don't walk before men people like to
[1:56:52] walk before men he says walk before me
[1:56:55] Abram don't you worry about your friends
[1:56:57] don't you worry about your church
[1:56:59] members don't you walk before the bishop
[1:57:01] you walk before me hallelujah
[1:57:04] friends we gotta walk before God don't
[1:57:06] worry about your friends don't worry
[1:57:09] about your church members don't worry
[1:57:11] about the bishop you walk before
[1:57:12] goddesses and the Almighty walk before
[1:57:15] me and be thou perfect hallelujah
[1:57:20] what how could a broom ever be perfect
[1:57:23] but you see God already in Genesis 15
[1:57:25] made a covenant with him and he says
[1:57:28] Abram you slay those animals it was a
[1:57:31] heifer it was a goat it was a sheep in
[1:57:34] two turtledoves and that night when
[1:57:37] Abram fell asleep
[1:57:38] a white light came right through it
[1:57:40] Bible says what was doing he was
[1:57:42] confirming the unconditional covenant
[1:57:45] that he made was Abram not what you do
[1:57:48] Abram not what what anyone can do of us
[1:57:51] but what I've already done he made an
[1:57:54] unconditional covenant friend that Abram
[1:57:56] will be saved
[1:57:57] Abram will be a father of many nations
[1:57:59] and he was confirmed in the Covenant why
[1:58:02] he says Abram be perfect how could it be
[1:58:05] perfect because he already made a
[1:58:07] covenant with him so our duty is to walk
[1:58:11] before Almighty God hallelujah
[1:58:14] I'm the Almighty walk before me and be
[1:58:17] thou perfect so friend just know your
[1:58:20] walk is poor before your friends many
[1:58:23] times in the churches we have groups we
[1:58:25] have cliques and we try to impress one
[1:58:27] another we're not supposed to do that
[1:58:29] our walk is vertical it is not
[1:58:32] horizontal that's the way we walk friend
[1:58:35] we walk with God every man in this world
[1:58:38] walks with God alone hallelujah and be
[1:58:43] thou perfect Christ gave us a perfect
[1:58:45] sacrifice so that's how perfection he
[1:58:49] says here and he made an unconditional
[1:58:51] covenant hallelujah is not what you
[1:58:54] gonna do Abram is what I have done I
[1:58:56] made your father of many nations and
[1:58:59] these
[1:59:00] action was in was already in Christ in
[1:59:04] God a perfect lamb unconditional company
[1:59:06] says yeah a perfect lamb has died nice
[1:59:09] place that's it that God made with the
[1:59:12] people it's not what I am Who I am is
[1:59:16] the perfection of Jesus Christ in God
[1:59:20] that died in my place to make me what I
[1:59:22] am
[1:59:23] it isn't whether I can stand I can't
[1:59:27] it's whether he stood in my place
[1:59:29] hallelujah so I want to say again we can
[1:59:32] give the Lord a hand of praise it's not
[1:59:34] me holding on but Christ holding on to
[1:59:37] me it's not whether I held on it's
[1:59:39] whether he held on it's not whether what
[1:59:42] I can do it's what he done friend so
[1:59:44] this covenant that God made with Abram
[1:59:47] comes right over to the Royal Seal of
[1:59:49] Abram which Christ died for and now we
[1:59:52] are perfected by his blood and we stand
[1:59:55] perfect in his sight hallelujah my said
[1:59:58] yeah oh god made what the people might
[2:00:02] say this God appear team right yeah he
[2:00:04] says it in the name of el-shaddai the
[2:00:07] bosom right in the seventeenth chapter
[2:00:09] of Genesis and the name of el-shaddai
[2:00:12] means the bosom in other words the
[2:00:15] priesthood one like the woman and he
[2:00:17] said Abram I am your bosom you may be
[2:00:19] old your strength is gone
[2:00:21] Sarah's whom is dead but I'm El Shaddai
[2:00:24] I'm the bosom I'm the president not one
[2:00:27] he says not one but two double-breasted
[2:00:31] listen what his next words he says one
[2:00:34] is for salvation hallelujah and the
[2:00:36] other one is for healing
[2:00:38] so double-breasted brother if you want
[2:00:40] salvation you nurse on one breast if you
[2:00:43] want healing Eunice on the other breast
[2:00:45] hallelujah that's how else would I know
[2:00:48] see yourself to healing last yourself to
[2:00:50] a new body
[2:00:51] hallelujah he says yeah I'm the Prince
[2:00:54] well now you just lean upon my promise
[2:00:56] nurse and I will satisfy you like a baby
[2:00:59] being satisfied and bring you back to
[2:01:02] your strength again he nursed himself to
[2:01:04] a new body hallelujah
[2:01:06] now he says yeah now like this is
[2:01:08] anything too hard for the Lord the
[2:01:10] message while the age old Saint
[2:01:13] sitting there with his head down praying
[2:01:16] no doubt it was then when he loved it up
[2:01:18] his eyes now this was 99 and brother BAM
[2:01:23] says right there he made a promise to
[2:01:25] Abram walk before bill our perfect next
[2:01:27] best thing he says he has the old Saint
[2:01:30] sitting he says he is praying no doubt
[2:01:33] it was then when he loves it up his eyes
[2:01:36] and he saw three men coming towards the
[2:01:39] tent or why he jumped up quickly it must
[2:01:43] have been the spotter they said go to
[2:01:45] them
[2:01:46] hallelujah listen he says in that same
[2:01:49] day Sarah must eat she was miserable she
[2:01:52] was complaining about Lot's wife
[2:01:53] dressing so smart having Egyptian
[2:01:56] hairstyles he said but Abram knew they
[2:01:58] was coming a visitation an angel
[2:02:01] visitation listen friends get ready for
[2:02:03] an angel visitation don't sit there all
[2:02:06] grumpy and droopy get ready for a
[2:02:09] visitation from the angel of God he says
[2:02:12] you know I like this there's something
[2:02:15] about sportful people he says they
[2:02:17] recognize the presence of God and I know
[2:02:20] he says I don't know why it is but it
[2:02:23] must be they got something in them that
[2:02:26] magnetizes them to the Spirit of God and
[2:02:29] he recognizes there was something coming
[2:02:32] hallelujah there's something in spirit
[2:02:34] for people that knows the presence of
[2:02:38] God and Abram knew no matter how Sarah
[2:02:40] was complaining how she was performing
[2:02:43] but he knew that they say he's gonna get
[2:02:46] the visitation and he was making ready
[2:02:48] for the brother/sister we got to prepare
[2:02:50] we can't sit back and just think it's
[2:02:53] gonna happen we got to prepare for what
[2:02:56] is coming there's a blessing coming
[2:02:57] there's a rapture coming this adoption
[2:03:00] coming this perfection coming these
[2:03:02] healings their signs in one but we must
[2:03:04] prepare for it as I read the quoted we
[2:03:07] must get in condition bring yourself in
[2:03:10] a condition where God can deal with you
[2:03:12] hallelujah
[2:03:13] and it says about the year later he says
[2:03:21] here
[2:03:24] later God comes on the scene again
[2:03:26] and he says and you remember how we
[2:03:29] listened Sara why did you laugh but
[2:03:33] before we see the promise over if I said
[2:03:37] Whitey's hid a laugh but what's his next
[2:03:39] words Genesis 18 verse 14 is anything
[2:03:43] too hard for the Lord in other words you
[2:03:45] laughing I made a promise and I said you
[2:03:49] have a baby and she loves because she
[2:03:52] couldn't believe God could perform the
[2:03:54] impossible and people in a message
[2:03:56] they are doubtful that God can perform
[2:03:59] right in the midst of this crisis this
[2:04:01] trying time does virus God can perform
[2:04:05] the impossible and he said to her is
[2:04:07] anything too hard for the Lord and I
[2:04:10] want to challenge every believer is
[2:04:12] anything too hard for God in the season
[2:04:14] then our God came to brother that he can
[2:04:17] bring to pass right in the face of this
[2:04:20] crisis right in the face of this demons
[2:04:22] flying in the air God can come right to
[2:04:25] you and visit you and tell you is
[2:04:27] anything too hard for my god
[2:04:29] that's what he said to her and then he
[2:04:32] made a promise at the time appointed I
[2:04:35] will return unto thee according to the
[2:04:37] time of life and Sarah shall have their
[2:04:40] baby hallelujah yes Abram and the next

[2:10:08] says he couldn't take them back to young
[2:10:10] woman and a young man again because they
[2:10:12] were unfertile there so he says it
[2:10:15] wouldn't have helped he had to give them
[2:10:17] a new body because when they were young
[2:10:19] they didn't have children so he created
[2:10:22] a new body new heart new friends new
[2:10:27] whom why because to prove that is the
[2:10:31] all powerful God says Abram I'm the
[2:10:34] Almighty God walk before me and be thou
[2:10:38] perfect God wanted to prove that he can
[2:10:41] change their bodies friends and he says
[2:10:44] that's what is gonna do to every royal
[2:10:46] seed of Abram did not only take them
[2:10:49] back to be young but gave them a new
[2:10:52] body and you're gonna see why we need a
[2:10:53] new body now the next thing is a change
[2:10:57] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you
[2:11:01] know what I say just after Abram he says
[2:11:03] and that's what is done to this church
[2:11:05] who brought it through the same thing

[2:11:09] moment there's a rapture in a twinkling
[2:11:12] of an eye and we will have we'll have to
[2:11:15] have a change body and we'll have to
[2:11:19] have a change but in our Sharon Abram in
[2:11:22] that kind of body could not receive the
[2:11:24] promise on there were 100 years old he
[2:11:27] had to change their body no turn them
[2:11:30] back so much is too young which he did
[2:11:33] but also change them because they they'd
[2:11:36] been like they was in the first place so
[2:11:39] they would still be barren he changed
[2:11:42] their body in such a way then they could
