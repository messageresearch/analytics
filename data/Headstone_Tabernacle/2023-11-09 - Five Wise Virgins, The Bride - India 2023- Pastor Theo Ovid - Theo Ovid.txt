anointing on the earth may be seated Glory Glory Hallelujah God took the prophet but he didn't take the angel Oh Glory to God he took the prophet but the angel is on earth now fixing things around praise God brother Bram he said God is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to Perfection oh blessed be the name of glory to God going to call a church Hallelujah to Perfection hallelujah hallelujah glory to God watch this when the angel came to Abraham after 25 years he giv testimony that his wife Sarah past childbearing that she's going to have a son and then the man said Elohim said Elohim veiled in flesh said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and then the prophet said this the latter rain is fixing to fall you have held that seed long enough Oh Glory to God so in other words if you are farmer here you have to put in the seed before the rain falls because the rain produces what the seed is the rain cannot change the seed if the pumpkin a pumpkin seed it cannot change to watermelon even though both go on Vine a pumpkin is a pumpkin watermelon is watermelon bride is foolish verion is foolish verion you cannot change the seed the seed is the word the seed is Christ the SE is seven tunders the SE is seven voices the SE is seven VES and when the Dynamics falls on the seed it will produce a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living temper a living patience a living a living and charity love going to cover you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah Glory [Music] [Applause] hallah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the prophet he's talking about there will be a denominational Gathering pretty soon which will be the confederation of the churches and this type of church will be put out of operation as far as they know and Jesus will appear and he will show which is bride and which is not now he know we know he prophesied that they're going to close down our churches we know that and we have a boycut but here it this he said Christian friends I am a man I can make mistakes but God cannot make a mistake listen to this now but before this boycott can come the marking of the Beast there has to be a seed swn for the church to take a church out of it so the prophet prophesy before they can close us down it have to have a seed in you to take you out now let me give you a guarantee not if the spirit Falls listen to this prophecy when the spirit Falls that there becomes a move among the people that they will swing together and the Church of God will be out put out Rome will rule the world for about one hour not communism romanism will rule the world with the coroporation of protestantism he said when the spirit Falls the life of the seed but come not if so you today you pray God let that seed come into me I want that seed I want the rain manifest what is in the seed Oh Glory to God the most important thing is the seed praise God Amen here is question a question but Bram are the five foolish vers of Matthew 25 counted as a gentile [Music] Remnant I understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but had to go through the Great Tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could there be the Sheep which is divided from the goats in Matthew 25 then B begin to speak you say a woman will take a piece of goods cloth piece of cloth and takes a [Music] pattern where she desires and cut it the part that is left over is called the remnant so when the woman makeing a dress she takes listen she takes the material and lay it down take the pattern of the dress put it on the material I begin to cut what she cuts out makes up the dress the rest of the material is the remnant and that's what he said here now if you notice there were five foolish and five Vice virgins all of them virgins made out of the same material but by election God chose His B by election before the foundation of the world and put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life Oh Glory to God the foolish virion who didn't have oil in their lamp but cast into outter Darkness weeping and willing ning of teeth and that's the Great Tribulation oh Blessed Be of the Lord so then he went on to say further before the box is sealed the inspector have to check the box you have trains here in India so he was talking about a box car so you put the boxes in the car has a long journey to make so you make sure it's packed right no loose place and when it is sealed but it's packed it seals it so said this here the Box Car may be fully loaded but if it got loose places in [Music] it you have to pack it over again and that's what's the matter a lot of us don't get the Holy Ghost when the inspector comes he finds loose places in you and he won't seal You Yet now if you have never been sealed with the Holy Ghost you never receive your faith in him yet you got some loose places but when you get all those loose places back right then you seals you until the day of your Redemption glory to God glory to God a seal signify ownership I know in Western Days with horses and so on have a branding iron and they put it in the fire and when they hold that horse and put that brand on him the horse had to run and kick up fire but when it is finished he is branded and when God finish the devil will know whose son you are whose daughter you are Oh Glory to God CH 9 God said put a mark upon those that s and cry this Mark of the Beast this Mark of God started in Genesis God put a mark on K since Genesis King had a mark mark of the beast today to reject the Holy Ghost is to take the mark of the beast don't reject the Holy Ghost say Lord fill me with that Holy Ghost glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah These Foolish Virg are in the message of Malachi 4 These Foolish person they have the books they have the tapes but they are nothing in the pride if they don't receive the Holy Ghost it's not how you receive a book receive a you got to get the book you got to listen to the but you got to get the Holy Ghost Jesus sto his disciples from preaching and Jesus told them T in the city of Jerusalem until you receive power from on high and all of them Apostle Prophet teacher Deacon aser sisters everybody was in the upper room Mary Magdalene Mary Mother of Jesus everybody for rain for power for for Theo all of a sudden when the day of Pentecost was fully come they heard a song and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they start like and Peter said these people are not drunk as you supp but this is that that the prophet Jo with power with the Holy Ghost fill with new Wing fil and Jesus said blessed and after righteousness you shall be India indiaia you shall be Oh Glory to God glory to God there is a bride in India the devil is a liar there is a bride in India no man could stop it no man could undo it of God listen listen to this prophet he said we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by experience [Applause] and if any Minister preach otherwise than this we know he's not telling the whole truth listen to these words we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not by a mythical intellectual conception of the scriptures but by an experience that you alone know and if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that and it will tell what kind of Spirit come upon you oh glory to God Glory so Jesus lived in a world a world of perfect Faith Jesus world was a different world alog together and if we live in a perfect fit of a Christian to what we are will be a Mystic to the world the people won't understand you you will walk in the spirit and what the spirit said you will do what it forbid you will not do hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah about Jesus now when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you are getting into bright [Music] material Oh you mean bright material is walking by faith not by [Music] sight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not walking by [Music] flesh but walking by faith now this is not for the ministers only let brother say it to you watch there you are now getting into bright material you are getting into rapture condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor or the deacons or the trustees that means for the ly every individual walks in a world with God alone you are baptized into his kingdom there is nobody in there but you and God he gives the ORD and you pack them out oh glory to God I knew I had to be in India by faith I knew I was coming India I couldn't miss this for nothing they have to give in the Visa they have to do everything for me to be here you have to walk by faith by sight I was sent here oh praise God [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hall hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah woo hallelujah hallelujah feel good all right here we [Applause] go the word have been shown denomination will reap denomination denomination but the word has also been shown this is a quote this is a joy when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people oh glory to God note he didn't say if it falls not if but when when the spirit of God begins to fall let's say it this [Music] way when the spirit of God begins to fall in India the word of God would live in the people in India so we are prophesying this morning the spirit is going to fall the spirit at is falling out Glory Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God he said at midnight there was a cry man behold the Bri coming go to meet him and those person arose and trim their lamps I don't know if if you have lamps now but the lamp have a thing to turn and after you light it for a long time it gets Smokey and shoty and you take a scissors and cut the black part off take some newspapers clean the lamp itself then you put it back then you're light it you have to have oil in the lamp and God some of us get [Music] Su your lamp Smokey you can't see clearly you have to stop take off the lamp cut the w l [Applause] l seear behold coming meet him hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now watch the foolish version came to the wise [Music] version precious brother hallelujah hallelujah give me of your oil the wise virgin says wrong season wrong season you're out of timing you're asking the wrong thing I can help you now go and pay the price go and buy go and pray go and cry out when you was having fun I was praying when he was watching movies I was seeking the Lord go and pray go and pay the price oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah wise verions so the foolish versions they went to buy they start to get sincere now but it was too late because the bridegroom he was on his way and the Bible said those that were ready went in Shake somebody [Applause] hand Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready hand Hallelujah shake your sister hand tell them Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready hallelujah hallelujah get ready then Shake Your Hands again and tell them Stay Ready Stay Ready Stay Ready glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God glory to God both of them virgins you may be seated both of them virgins both in the message both believe William Bram both have books both have tapes both have pastors but one have oil oil is the spirit in the Old Testament in the seals hurt not the oil and the wine oil and wine is always in worship and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation and Jesus said you don't take wine and put it in Old bottles and those bottles wasn't the kind of bottles you have today it was a lamb skin bottle out the skin and after a while when the skin get old and dry it wasn't flexible because wine have a power in it do ferment do Bubble Up will expand so the challenge is keep the oil in the skin and once you have oil in this lamb skin and God pour the wine on you you can expand you can lift your hand you can praise God you can jump a little bit you can walk hallelujah hallelujah why because you have skin oil in your skin I know the Holy Spirit could pour the wine your B new Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Glory you may be seated we having a good time but this is serious you may be see said this is serious when you think about it precious sainted people missing the Rapture because no oil the pastors didn't Pat the promises the pastors didn't preach the word to the people so instead of the church going in Matthew 56 that prob we read Because listen if you hungering this morning you already blessed you already blessed because Jesus said blessed the day blessed that day that hunger and tast after righteous they shall be filed that is positive that is Jesus own words you're going to be filled listen to The Prophet now watch these two churches it just burns my soul these churches are clean and [Music] holy they're all virgins just as clean the only difference was oil in the lamp the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it is there hear this it will produce the same kind of fire it did on Pentecost we don't want no mother Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah de churches dead groups as we say yesterday India P some Wicket out and good Wicket or some star batsman hit six they need four to win and need and hit six and you sit down there Bo good six I don't want to be your friend I don't want to be near you I want somebody that is excited to see that we cost six runs and we won the match and we shout we Rejoice because our country won but Jesus people on the he wants the Bible said let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife made ready you want to leave this place shouting you going to leave India shouting you will leave India praising your god oh glory to God hallelujah all right let's finish here now let's let's get I amam they have fine ceremonies but still that is wrong that's the kind that misses the [Music] rapture the same thing with the sleeping virsion and the wise versin he said you are a bunch of Holy Rollers Oh Glory to now a sleeping virgin and a wise virgin with oil in her lamp all of a sudden there came a sound behold the bridegroom come in go out to meet him and they waken and when they did this one could go in because they had oil in their lamps that was the difference this one could not go in where there was no oil in the lamp listen to these words now they went back to pray up to receive the Holy Ghost oh brother over you need to pray to receive the Holy Ghost Jesus said it this way he said which one of you would give a serpent to your son which one of you being evil how much more would God give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him if you don't ask you will not receive so if you want it you have to ask for Oh Glory to God hallelujah keep on asking until you receive so the prophet says watch this there was no oil in their lamps and they went back to prayer to receive the Holy Ghost and while they were gone they would say well maybe we were wrong maybe we better go back to seek for the Holy Ghost then the bridegroom come oh my oh my Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the wise version with oil in a lamb she was made ready and while the foolish went to get oil here comes the bridegroom oh my hallelujah praise God listen to The Prophet I'm going to wrap up but says now the reason that the revivals we are supposed to have we have had real [Music] stiring we have millions of of church members but not a Revival prophecy the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there is no Revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we are looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake up all of a sudden something struck to wake up the bride because the briag woman is coming and you have to be ready to meet him now watch this those foolish virgins once had oil you know but their oil ran out the wise virgin had extra oil so don't don't barely make it extra praise God praise listen what the prophet said if the churches would forget their creeds and forget their dogmas and take the Bible and plead the promise it would be effective to them when what does he mean when he said plead the promise you telling God lord you promised me the Holy Ghost you promise to heal me for my promise you promised to Quicken me you promised to break the world and everything has what God to do you ple the promise God andam said it's here we are finished he said what we seen happen here should put every soul in [Music] action it should make a church that will make a Revival in Phoenix and people will be flying from Europe to see what taking place they will say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley Valley a city called Phoenix Phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah let's go further we almost done five wives had all in their lamps they were all Sanctified but the five was wise enough to have the wisdom of Revelation to catch that door and be filled with the spirit don't let no man deceive you or fool you you must have the oil to go in you see these five versions here they look very happy they are happy because they are ready get ready and stay ready glory to God I'm almost done praise God just about two more quotes butam then if you are citizens of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom what does God do in his kingdom it his Holiness righteousness purity of [Music] thought purity of mind power and [Music] love going to the loss but Bram closing remarks these
