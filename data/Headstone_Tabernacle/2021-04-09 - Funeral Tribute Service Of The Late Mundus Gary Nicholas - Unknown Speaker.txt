had one brother and two sisters he attended marvel irish school and which one street boys but would eventually drop out in standard four to take care of his family a responsible little he never shook at such a tender age and took seriously throughout his life because his family meant everything to him as a young man he had an opportunity to go to the united states and have a better life but chose family over opportunity finally known as sex because he left home at six a.m every morning and return home at six pm every evening the soy garrison dust gara brother dos thunders and even the general were also some of his other nicknames in his young days carrie gary an excellent footballer was a ladies man a well-known hot stepper however he would meet my mother the love of his life and quickly chew away his bachelorees after that they were like two peas in a pod everywhere you saw gary you would always see diane she was only she was only 19 but they got married and they shared 43 beautiful years together humble beginnings they weathered the storms of life together and built a solid foundation of love and family together they had 10 children lazy and being his firstborn after which they

hook daddy always had something for him to do always fix a light check a plug move his car from point a to point b for no reason and thus always patiently do it channy was a child who gave dad a run for his money he was one miserable little child who would have thought he would have become a policeman that was proud of him marcus firstborn followed in his father's footsteps and learned his love

everyone who would listen including his close cousin and confident uncle edmund whose family also came to the lord everyone in marvel knew that his home was a christian household and that he would not tolerate certain behaviors or dress in his house where the dust would not allow any young lady to sneak in in their hot pants or young mind young men to walk around in the yard without a shoot he was the gatekeeper in that small community and set an example for all to see he would always testify to the neighbors and encourage them to save the lord and if anyone had a disagreement with him you

jesus wouldn't lift us up to let us down oh jesus wouldn't lift us up to let us die oh well and in the sweet [Applause] [Music] amen amen well praise the lord give a seat uh thanks thanks for coming and um you know i some funerals when you hear words spoken about the person in the box sometimes the ones if in the right funeral because how they live and what the person is saying about them is two different things but this is not so what you hear is what was there he lived his testimony he spoke a word and he lived that word so today i want to welcome i want to invite brother lantern uh baramundus he was his pastor for many many years i want to ask but a lantern pastor antony if he could come forward and say a few words i sure he would have something that he could share [Applause] god bless everyone it was a privilege for me to be here i specifically asked to be part of this small group because brother one does meant quite a lot to me and there are two things that are outstanding i won't be long there are two things that are outstanding about brother mundus one is on the spiritual side as the eulogy said and many people would testify he loved the lord and he loved the word and i remember in the early days when he just came into the message his great enthusiasm and his great desire was for everybody in the world especially the churches he came out from and so on he wanted them to just ignore this message and i remember that's very much about him but on the natural side his sense of humor was out of this world totally delightful and i remember an incident in which he was because he he was a painter and he was um he was working on our house doing some painting with some other brothers and he was on a ladder that led to the upstairs of our bedroom so he was just outside there and he needed i think a paintbrush i can't remember what it was but he needed something so we attempted to open the window to give him what it was and brother mundus you know normally somebody would say no no no don't open the window because it could affect him but amanda's in a most matter-of-fact voice said nah do from the window otherwise i gotta take it downstairs [Applause] [Applause] and that was so and i just want the family to know in closing that our prayers are genuinely with them a man especially his wife they were like two quads and um certainly we'd be praying for y'all god bless you richie [Music] [Applause] okay so i would like to jesus stand i'll read one scripture and i'll read some two more scriptures that's one verse one scripture from romans 6 chapter 23 it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord you may be seated and this other scripture from 1st thessalonians 4 it reads 5 would not have you to be ignorant brethren considering them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rules again even so them also will sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we see unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel are with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the ear and so shall we ever be with the lord therefore comfort one another with these words last scripture readiness from revelation 20 verse 12 to 15 i saw the dead listen carefully i saw the dead small and great stand before god all the dead and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea give up the dead which were in it and debt and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and debt and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second debt i know you don't hear much about that what you see in here is the first death there is something called a second dead that does not affect the christians but there is something called the second death this one is easy the other one is different and death and hell were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire let's pray heavenly father i thank you for your word and i thank you for your people guided here and i pray a release comfort this is among us the children the family may you who stick it closer than a brother comfort them by your spirit by your love by the presence by the anointing reach out to them and blanket them with the token of life granted lord and jesus in my ask it email i have a taught to share with you we just have a few more minutes and when time runs out when time runs out iklassi's tree says to everything there's a season a time to every purpose a time to be born a time to die a time to plant time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill heal break down build up weep laugh mourn a time to dance time to cast away stones time to gather stones together time to embrace time to refrain from embracing our time to get time to lose time to keep a time to cast away time to run the time to sow time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate time of war on a time of peace it is an illusion to operate and speak as if you're here permanently we are in time and time is at the beginning and time comes to an end version 10 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore and said there should be time no longer time itself runs out and all what we have to do in life is within time and if time run out the purpose that your reason for will not be accomplished you know become like school go to primary school form one to form five within those five years the student the child is supposed to learn i'm supposed to graduate sometimes times run out and they don't didn't learn what they're supposed to learn and they find yourself behind don't be caught there where time runs out on you this angel with this book this little book the devil they see all except whose names are written on this book but among us as i know him was a i called the bible talk about the last days men shall be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god i call him a lover of god genuinely lover of god many time after service he just watched me and smile he say i don't know what to say his whole and he doesn't smile with his lips you know his old face was smiling his whole face was smiling he just loved god he loved the word there are very few people like that i call him an authentic person he was no copy he was original and that's what carried the value and weight of what he was and that that word authentic means true true to one's personality spirit a character it means exactly and actually what is claimed authentic being fully trustworthy according to fact genuine not fake or counterfeit the opposite of that is counterfeit fake false falsifies unauthorized ungenuine unreal but he was an authentic individual god help us to be authentic you know everybody if they were not black everyone in black hat now anybody where now white jersey everyone white jersey where he won this every you know the same thing he was original he was authentic and that is why we're here to give that respect to a real christian a genuine son of god we are here because the wages of sin is still dead we are here because man fell we wasn't supposed to get old he wasn't supposed to get gray he was supposed to be young right now he is young he is in the region of the bliss he with the saints who going on before he is waiting right now for people to come to perfection to make a resurrection call he is waiting for the voice of the archangel to come by and through a bride and that's why we are here as a people to come to perfection because he is waiting on us and the bible said day without us are not made perfect we have something better to do something we have something better to achieve so a life here is for purpose but it's all have to do with in time some miss that time it's not when you're born is that when you're finished is what happened in between it's not the name you're born into nicholas is that the name you're given mundus it's the third name the name you make for yourself it's the most important name and you make that name by how you live by how you act by what you do the name you make for yourself oh blessed be the name of the lord so when man fell god had to keep his word god is not a trinidad and he's the word he said the day you eat thereof that day you die and he didn't back down adam died and he was driven off of the garden of eden not escorted out driven out angels with swords was guarding the tree of life god surely didn't want to allow man to be in that sinful condition and partaking of this eternal life so he run them out but in this hour them same angels that driving them out trying to get man back to the tree of life mundus found his way back oh hallelujah and i hope that you could find your way back because time is running out hallelujah glory to god time is running out so despite all the making of money houses land degrees doctorate professorship ceo in charge of chairman beside all of that the wages of sin is still dead time will run out on your beauty on your looks you're always you're standing from the mirror on your strength as a youth time around that and it's such a deception that people don't see 40 years from now they see where they are now and they look day to day but the other 40 years if gotarius come in or 60 where would you be time runs out so therefore all your achievement comes to nothing without christ let me say it again you get a piece of land because you're never talking about the land you have now nothing without christ hallelujah you can't make a way for yourself because you can't make your own sacrifice when man fell man can say you know what i feel i'll go take it this way and i'll go back soon i'll go back soon no no no there has to be a way back and only god himself could provide that way and god provided a way by letting the lamb died letting sacrifices died it was debt for death death for death so lambs and goats and bullocks was dying year and year old for as a cost as a price to know that it takes a price to pay to get back when jesus came he was god's perfect lamb and this easter on calvary when that lamb died he made a blood way that we could get back regardless of what you have done how far you have gone how deep you have sinned he has made our way back by his blood that's the only thing he could accept he can't accept you're too early mary entry or father he can't accept your burner can't land but turn up benefit upside down or whatever it is you can't accept what you think because there's a way to seem right unto a man and the end thereof is dead there's a way back you have to find that way back and god is the word and he has made a way for you to get back and i trust you children here today if you're not right with god that you will get right with god if you're not where is supposed to be you will get back to where you're supposed to be because time is running out if you have to meet him you have to go through the same way he went he went by the way of the word he went by the way of god we have our own way we have our own way thinking but whatever is doing we are thinking you see the child in israel they didn't know that god for 400 years there was in bandage oh god deliver me oh god deliver me oh god deliver me isn't that some people know oh god deliver me god deliver me god sent moses as his deliverer moses was smack enough to ask god who shall i say send me quack yeah say i bring myself i said myself i'm also gonna zone into petition god says tell them i am sent to you moses went down there and preached to two million people bring them out you know what they perished two million people called out perished and only two million and when they told jesus our father eat man in the wilderness jesus said and they're everyone dead he wasn't talking about first dating he was talking about people that cannot go back into the light of god hallelujah the second that is something to fear and to think about oh hallelujah the everyone dead you cannot make your own way back to god you have to come god's provided way and jesus is god's provided way not catholic not baptist not methodist not what you think and your mother and your father you have to find out what is the provided way that is what brother mundus discovered it lit up his soul let me say that it lit up his soul not his head his soul so he was committed not the church but the god and to god's people there is always something to do that was his mantra all around the church building i remember when he was plastering as we said before the plastic could even finish dry he was painting washington as you're plastering the paintbrush coming behind you there was always something to do a passion for god a passion for the house of god a passion for the people of god and i trust that something light you up today to want to be like that everybody doing their own thing you know but the christians have to do their own thing too for god i trust that you become god's billboard and shine you don't light a candle and hide it your light i cannot put it on top that it could give out light to the world this world is going to the darkness gross darkness cover the earth gross darkness cover the people but there's no people gonna have light and they've got people who have shine they're gonna shine his death must not be in vain you were here because of him god sent you here there are words that god gave that you must hear before time runs out hallelujah oh glory to god the time allotted on earth to do his will everything is written time time that is what people don't cater for so you see somebody strong and healthy and they're cussing on the arrogant and they don't care and after time you see them walking and they can't say nothing all the aragon's gone because time bring a whole different change around their life you can't change what is happening around you but you can change what's happening with you you can change your circumstances sometimes the winds blow contrary who expected this nobody looking for this when we get married and we stand at the altar till death do us part we will part but let that do it this is how it's supposed to be he has gone on hallelujah oh praise the lord the unfolding of time what time reveals and what time unfolds you don't own time i could do this next week i was here i would get this i'll deal with you and before you deal with that person god deal with you you don't own time the clock is ticking seconds turn to hours hours turns to days days turns to weeks weeks the months month into years the clock is ticking i have a scripted read from psalms 90 is a scripture that moves me for we are consumed by their anger and by thy wrath are we troubled our set of iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in iraq we spend our years as a tale that is told the days of our years are 3 score and ten and if by reason of strength there'll be four score years yes it's their strength labor and sorrow it is soon cut off we fly away who know at the power of nine anger even according to thy fear so is that iraq so teach us to number our days that we might apply our hearts onto wisdom when times runs out to repent time runs out to make things right if you had something to tell him time run out you can't tell him now the people around you that you should love and cherish cherish them love them if you wanted to tell them daddy i love you you can't do that now you should have done that when he was alive if your thing said make right with him you couldn't can't do it now you have to done that done when he's alive the people are wrong you that's why jesus said if you can't love people who you see oh you could love god you can't see that's why jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples not when you could talk would but when you could have love and express it and show it one to one another when time runs out to make decisions time runs out to give up stuff to change your attitude my god time runs out we spend our life our years is a tale that is told but a monday's book is now closed when this book first opened like a child is born and as the days go by the pages keep turning some of you in the beginning of your book some of you in the middle of the book some of you past middle but the pages are turning we spend all years the teal that is told some of us get anxious we want to get to the destination but pause a little bit and enjoy the journey there's time unfolds character and life every day whether it costs you smoke your drink the pages are turning every day you have a time to repent to say lord i want to serve you i want to change my life i want to change my ways because your purpose i know it is not to have cars and house and money and land and water your personally just with god because money and land god give you just even better not not to save him to save him better hallelujah whether you serve him or not your page is turning whether you love him or not your servant's speech is turning whether the treasure or not the page is still turning and one day comes the very end you don't know when that day could be because you said bong juice you cannot pass walk on the savannah lift up lift up them weights and build body and whatnot and and your days are coming your days are coming it's turning remember a young man i met in school he said i want to be a drug lord i said why you said i have plenty of money i said there's that guy young boxing he was only seeing the money he wasn't seeing the box he said didn't think about that sir it's what you want to look at devil give her a illusion when you get this you'll be happy when you get that you'll be happy when i get a wife then you want to get rid of the wife you got to get a husband then you want to see me but i wish i got a next man get that job he said oh god this job oh god i want to leave the job you get a house it's highly host to all you find a better house and never keep shifting the posts of happiness because happiness doesn't consist of what a man possess happiness have to be inside of you that's what mundus had something on the inside do you have that in the inside if you don't have it any inside wouldn't be satisfied as i'm talking time is running out time run out on me to give this sermon time is running on you to be here time is one day the last page is going to be close book is close work is done purpose is finished and accomplished when time runs out hallelujah god was very patient with israel he knew they they only know egypt they know the culture of egypt they don't know god he told moses bring them to this mountain that i could reveal to them my laws my words my truth they came out in the wilderness and the bible said there was a shorter way but god said unto the wildernesses to hope that egypt would fall off at him because he could take man out of the water but is there the water inside of him so in other words they came out but egypt was still in them that's the problem today people coming out but they haven't gone in it's too past not only must you come out but you have to go in we are not we're talking about our life being changed our life being transformed my hallelujah want to read this again and i saw the dead small and great so when you're dead he had done yet yet there's another level that's coming all them who escape the police all them people who kill and what that and nobody catches them and they're going down them coming up to him every man coming back evil men wicked men everybody gonna rise and be judged therefore you have an opportunity now to change your thinking to change your ways to change your very life friends i want to invite you for this change for this transformation this is the way of all flesh when man fell god kept his word he escaped he keeps his word of blessings and he keeps his words of kiss also the day you eat that day you die that is why we have this today the wages of sin is still there so this time i want to ask the family to stand all the family members to stand right where you are but isaac would you come up with me you want to pray for the family that the comfort of god and the grace of god would extend to their lives let's ball heads oh gracious heavenly father lord we lord uh so touched by the life of our brother mundus nicholas lord a true soldier of the cross lord who has led such a life that it has impacted so many of us in so many different ways and lord father lord i i remember speaking to the family and i said i'm not worried about him at all because i know what he believed i knew what he fought for i knew what was in his heart and he he lived such a transparent life and how he operated lord and lord we want to take note of this take note of this law this son who had the opportunity lord and i considered more blessing for us to have crossed paths with him lord that father we could see your touch on his life and even for us to be gathered here lord and limited in such a time of this pandemic and yet to see so many connected online and those that would even see it afterwards lord that lord we want to come and rally around the family in a special way lord and i remember saying that one of his deepest deepest desires was to see his family everyone come into a relationship with you lord as brethren said he had a desire that everybody in this world lord would come into contact with this message this gospel this truth that he encountered lord may as he lord has moved on to a better place lord lord he has left us with work to do lord work to do to look at our lives look at our interactions look at our conversations look at our testimonies work to make a church to make a revival work to come to perfection to bring on our resurrection and lord deeply lord and especially with a family work to make our calling and election sure lord may you comfort the family may you comfort his precious wife lord and give us strength lord strength that she doesn't even know she possesses because it comes from you lord may you fortify her with your comfort your promise to lord never leave us never forsake us may you be her comfort her strength lord may you be her luck shelter her anchor lord may you be the shoulder that she leans on may you be lord dear lord in the moments when she looks around lord may you be with her and touch her give her the wisdom as the matriarch of this house to give leadership and guidance may you touch every one of the children lord the young men the young woman the grandchildren lord and the great-grandchildren that lord may you be with each one may they come into a personal encounter with you father lord may the memory lord of mundus be so tangible lord that his worship and his praise and his attitude would resonate in his home he had a way he moved in the house here the way he approached your kingdom lord lord may he not be forgotten may it not be just another another another passing but lord we stand and identify with him lord and like the hebrews lord in hebrews 11 the heroes of faith lord who went on before lord that you justified by their lives lord he stands as a testimony that we will meet again we will see again so may you give each one that comfort may you bless each one that came here today and those under the sound of the voice of this meeting lord even here and virtually that they would take stock of their lives that time is running out lord and that we would take this opportunity to do all that we can do to love those that we could see and be around those that are low that we we we have not been in touch with and father may the bond between the family be unbroken lord may unite the family more than ever before may they forget anything that would divide them may they forget past issues may they forget grievances may they
