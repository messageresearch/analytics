amen I was truly blessed truly truly blessed thank you musicians thank you brother Anthony I'd like to go straight to the word this morning and I'd like to read from the book of St Mark this morning St Mark chapter 4 and St Mark 5 we'll spend all the reading there in St Mark 415 and reading St Mark chapter 4 and reading from verse 35 and the same day Mark 4:35 and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the H the part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him and going over into the next chapter Mark 5 and verse 1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gatherin and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no n with chains because that he had often he had been often bound with feathers and chains and the chains had been plucked aund by him and the feathers broken into pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones and when he saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adure Thee by God that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he said he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the Devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forth withth Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a te plac into the sea there were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea and they that fed the wine the the the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country that they went out to see what is what what it was that was done and they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also cons turning the swine and he began to pray him to depart out of their coast and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him how be it Jesus suffered him not but sayth unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and had hath compassion on thee may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen Give the Lord a hand of the praise this morning so we are certainly happy to be in the house of the Lord how many appreciate the message last Sunday come down to The Potter's House what a masterpiece of a masterpiece of a masterpiece of a message and there's so much in there it's it's word listening to again and it is so profound when you really study the scripture to see that there were just four elements in this whole story there's the Potter there is the wheel there is the clay and there is the Watcher here it is Jeremiah is watching there is the Potter standing there with the authority there is the clay being molded and shaped and there's the wheel that's spinning and I love how brought that that wheel is the wheel of life it's the wheel of circumstance it's the wheel of situations and we have no control over the wheel sometimes the wheel moves slow sometime the wheel moves faster sometime the wheel moves and it feels like it's out of control and you're just turning and your life and it's moving around but the one who's controlling that wheel is the Potter he knows when to speed it up he knows when to slow it down he knows when to stop for a breather he knows when to activate it he knows when to take a piece out of you because he is feeling and he knows if there's a defect he has got to stop to pull that defect out of there and the only way he could know there's a defect is to get his hands inside of the situation get his hands all up in your situation get his hands all up in your business and when his hands are in there he can feel it say wait a minute this is not supposed to be there because you may be see there for a minute that lump of clay in its raw form you pick up the clay you don't really know what's in there so when that Potter picks up the clay and puts it on the wheel and he starts to spin now he can have a relationship with the clay to say wait a minute this is starting to feel good I'm I'm starting to pull out the jealousy and pull out the envy and maybe I go little faster kind of see what stuff you made out all but at the end of the day cuz the Bible said it was mad it was mad in The Potter's hands it had nothing to do with you it had nothing to do with your family it was m in The Potter's hands it was it was his touching that caused it to even Mar because a piece of pebble may have moved and he realized wait a minute I didn't realize this was day I got to take it out and as he's working it's God working his way out because he is the Potter and we are the clay so I love how bov brought it if your life is spinning this morning that's all right because it's not you causing the spinning it's he causing the spinning so thank God that he is the Potter you are the clay and the wheel of your life could never be out of control it is always in control because he is the controller can the church say amen hallelujah I was so blessed so blessed so blessed and uh just to continue along that vein in a bit I have a title this morning and my title is what manner of man is this I have a subject is not this Joseph's son and an inspiration or total Deliverance amen can the church say amen amen just for a special announcement uh the homegoing service for sister Sandra would be tomorrow please God here at the Tabernacle at 11: a.m. here at the Tabernacle at 11: a.m. the homegoing service for sister Sandra uh we have a not of praise for s from Sister nairon giving God praise for allowing her to see another birthday today God bless you Happy Birthday and the Sunday School teachers would like to meet with all the parents of the children in the Sunday School immediately imately after the service so may the Lord bless you so in the message calling Jesus on the scene but the brandham was praying and in his prayer he said our heavenly father we are so happy tonight and I say so happy today to know that this great one who makes the winds and the sea to obey him is with us we are grateful that we have this great witness of his living yet today and knowing that he is eternal he can never die he is alive forever more and has showed forth his great Mercy to us the children of man in these days we are a needy people and that's how I feel this morning Lord so needy that no one else could meet our needs but you amen and we are looking for you today to come into our gathering here and to make yourself known to us by forgiving our sins increasing our faith Lord and healing our sickness and afflictions and when we go to our homes tonight may we be happy seeing like those from EMAs did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen and can the Church of the Living God say Amen so this morning I thank God for the trials I thank God for the tests and the situations that God in his wisdom has sent us through because at the end of the day as bovid said a few weeks ago God is looking for the right kind of a son yes and this question what manner of man is this is because Jesus was now breaking the thinking of those that were around him they had already seen him do Miracles they had seen him do stuff in fact early in his ministry they asked the question is this not Joseph's son why is he talking this way why is he preaching this way why is he reading the scripture this way they already knew that there was something different about him but from the passage we read there's a different kind of statement it's not about being even anyone's son but they ask what kind what manner of man is this and I'm looking for the day when the world would look at you and ask what manner of man is this under the pressure under the trials under the test under the situation you could still worship God in other words you are doing the unexpected when all hell is against you what manner of man is this you should have backed a long time ago but you're still standing what manner of man is this this week was a hard week for you but you're still in the house of God what manner of man is this and one day when you manifest a spoken word truly they will say what manner of man is this and even the wind and the Seas and the elements obey him God is looking to reproduce himself he doesn't want to be the only one who could do Miracles he doesn't want to be the only one who could heal the sick he doesn't want to be the only one who could raise the dead he said the same works I do you shall do also so that scripture what manner of man is this was not limited to that man called Jesus what manner of man is this was a prophecy of men to come that will fit that same description that will fit that same definition men who will break the rules of gravity men who will break the rules of the atmosphere men who will break the rules of Medicine men who will break the rules of physics men who will break the rules of nature men who will break the world of what's natural because they come from eternity they come from an eternal place no wonder he could walk on water no wonder he could take water and turn it into wine what manner of man is this can the church say Amen oh somebody help me preach this morning oh Hallelujah this we talking about Jesus many time in the message people miss the fact that it's all about Jesus brother brandham came to speak about Jesus uh just like John the Baptist uh his ministry was to forun the coming of Jesus uh the ministry of the Prophet was not for his own sake it was not for his own Ministry it was not to be placed there as a star just to say I'm a star in the right hand of God it was to point to Jesus walk in the earth once more it's to walk about 16 elements Jesus for all these years he's been waiting to find somebody and the son of man was veiled in a son of man in brother Bram no wonder he could say little fish I give you back your life what manner of man is this that can give a fish back his life son come on and Shout oh you don't hear me this morning s a hatti right I give you your two boys what manner of man is this that could give salvation you don't hear me this morning oh can I get a witness in the house are there any Bible believing Christians in the house this morning that know he's the same yesterday know he's the same today know he's the same forever you may be seated brother the Bram was just like you and I Peter was just like you and I James was just like you and I Moses was no different from you he's the same man God could take 16 elements and throw some fire oh you don't hear me this morning throw some fire throw some fire and that fire could burn could burn the sin out could burn your nature out can burn the lion out can burn the lust out so that one man could walk in and a different man could walk out but then you'll have a testimony what manner of man is this you may be seated for a minute Hallelujah you may be seated for a minute I want you to appreciate something this morning I want you to appreciate the fact that when Jesus was in the boat the Bible said he was tired brother the kangali the Bible said They Carried him into the boat he didn't willingly walk into the boat the great God of Eternity was so exhausted in his human condition that it took trained men it took understanding men to lift Jesus up and carry him in the boat but as the young people say don't get it twisted in his tired condition when he's sleeping on the boat all the power that was in God is locked up in this man tiredness can't stop the power sickness can't stop the power being weary can't stop the power being frustrated can't stop the power I feel like a Baptist this morning I feel like a Pentecostal this morning you don't even know what you meeting this morning but give me the old time religion give me the Old Time Gospel give me the old time preaching give me the old time singing H welcome to the Butter's house there's joy in The Potter's House there's peace in The Potter's House there is Deliverance in the PO house everything you need in the pot's house can the church say Amen but I want to I want to rewind the story a little bit you may be SE it for a moment I want to rewind the story amen amen hallelujah you know some you see a a show something I tell you 36 hours earlier this is what the situation was I want to rewind us story because brother Bram dramatized this story in the message calling Jesus on the scene and he said from the uh scripture reading we find out that it had been a great meeting Jesus had been going about doing great wonders always doing good and always doing what was pleasing to God is that your testimony can people say the same about you that you always doing good ah young people always do doing good I see some young people smiling always doing good always doing what was pleasing to God not doing what's pleasing to the community or the friends or the family but always doing what's pleasing to God he always pleased God the prophet said he didn't please himself and the Bible and the B goes and virtue had gone from him he had been teaching Parables all day and virtue had gone out of him and he was going across to see across over on the other side by being what he was he knew there was a great job ahead on the other side Jesus was tired he had just finished preaching brother Knights he was exhausted and his last words before he fell asleep was we need to go on the other side but the Bram said because a great work was laying on the side other side I want to draw your attention to the fact that these men Peter and these brothers they were men that were used to the Sea and the waters and it was not their custom to go to the other side they were used to staying on the right side on the correct side because on the other side was the land of gadara a land of unbelievers a land of sin a land of Jews didn't go over there Believers didn't go over there because Jews don't mess with with the swine they don't mess with the unclean thing but the gatherin were the with the swine herders so there was no business for Peter to go to the other side and I could I could imagine Jesus tells them and they fell asleep and they look at one another Jesus wants to go to the other side it takes great obedience to listen to the words of the master and just do what he says even if it defies what your custom I love it what your custom is what your used to doing it's a break of the routine and Jesus leaves them hanging as it were because he didn't give them explanation he didn't have to explain himself or Justify say we need to go to the other side Hallelujah because what the disciples did not know and it's what Jesus knew is that on the other side was there was there was somebody who needed to be [Applause] delivered there was somebody on the other side who needed a breakthrough there was somebody on the other side who the Bible said day and night he was crying out because he wanted Deliverance but the spirits that were upon him would not give him leave would not give him leave to leave where he was to come over to where Jesus was so Jesus in his condition the same way he left glory to come down to our level he left the safe Zone and went into the dark Zone because there was somebody on the other side who needed to be set free he couldn't help himself he couldn't free himself they tried to tie him and he broke out they tried to counsel him they couldn't help him they prayed for him it didn't work they tried to help him but thank God Jesus was around Jesus was on the earth and the power to set him free he may be seated somebody's going free this morning oh yes oh yes oh yes you may be seated for a minute the Bible doesn't give us his name so in other words he could be anybody Hallelujah his name was not Legion the Bible does not give him his name and I love stuff like that because it's deliberate it's like the woman with the issue of blood no name it could be anybody there are people here with issues whether it's an issue of blood issue of pain issue of whatever issue is you're just like that woman with the issue of blood Jesus left it Anonymous so you could step in and catch fate if that no name woman with the issue of blood could tell herself if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I could be made whole this is not Sarah or Esther or Hannah or Deborah or Rebecca or Rachel this is a woman with an issue is there anybody in the house with issue well I've got news for you Jesus is still in the building and You Could Touch the Hem of His Garment you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's hard to worship God when you have issues but if you could stop the issue of blood if you could stop that virtue leaving here all of a sudden your praise begins to get different your shout begins to get different your worship begin to get different and he's in the building this morning that same Jesus he is the same yesterday he's the same today he is the same forever you may be [Applause] seated can I just talk a little bit can I just encourage you a little bit so Jesus knew that there was somebody on the other side the Bible never reference his name and there are people in the house today you are struggling with an unclean Spirit it could be lying it could be lust it could be jealousy it could be envy and that's the one Spirit you're battling maybe some you dealing with two maybe you some you dealing with three problems you you struggling with lying you battling with envy your jealousy is eating you up but this man we're talking about it wasn't one problem it wasn't two was a it was a legion of unclean spirits and they were United as one because they spoke with one voice We Are Legion they were they had their own Union they were helping one another to keep this man in bondage they were helping one another to keep this man trapped but I don't care this morning what Demons What unclean spirits you have been hiding and harboring working together for a long time when Jesus crosses to the other side those demons they know who he is even if you don't know who he is those Devils that you have been fighting they know who he is you may be seated you may be [Applause] seated the story again we keep going ahead and have to keep pulling somebody's pulling this morning virtue had gone out of Jesus as he knows he needs to be on the other side he is tired and brother brandham said his disciples picked up their OES and hoisted the sails and I want you to see the drama of it just as seen would do many of them their occupation they were fishermen they under sea they know how to control these boats it was not their desire to go to the other side but but the BAM said while they're doing it they just were having a great time of rejoicing a jubilee time perhaps talking about the things that had happened that day and brother Bram said he's dramatizing so Jesus is sleeping and those Brothers brother Mikey instead of complaining they are talking they're fellowshipping around the world but the said you know there's something about it when you see our lord Jesus do things and you can know it's him that nothing else could do it but him we just simply we got to get together we everybody wants to testify everybody wants to see something and they want to talk about it you can have a Revival at your church and the pastor can speak a marvelous message or the Evangelist or whoever it might be and you see certain things take place or something in the neighborhood somebody was healed the neighbors get together and talk about it how marvelous were you there you should have seen it it was the most outstanding thing there's something about the works of God that trills man's heart more than anything else that could happen it's just an unforgettable experience when we come in contact with the Lord Jesus and see the things that he does so great and marvelous in his ways so Random said they must have took an opportunity while the sales were going along pretty well to talk about him about his acts about his claims about his messiahship I like what what the prophet said about his claims because they didn't fully understand who Jesus was he was just is this not Joseph's son he just stuff is happening around him but they still did not appreciate fully that he was different many of these disciples might have spoken of what they had seen done one or the other now that's the way they were talking maybe it was Simon as we talked about last and said when Andrew told me about him I was just a little bit skeptic but when he told me who I was and who my father was and took all the guests out of me I just believed him so these brothers are fellowshipping among when they first met this man who was sleeping there in the boat and it might have been Andrew said we talked about that lady at the well were you there Hallelujah Bren you know it was so strange we went to get some food some rituals and we come back and we were standing outside the bushes and we seen him talking to this ill Fame woman we talk in our hearts what if some of the priests would come up and see this our Master talking to a woman of this caliber that's the prophet talking what would they say about him and then we remember how we knew that we had confidence in him that it was for some purpose he was talking to her I want you to understand brothers sisters that it wasn't easy for the disciples they were normal men so the concerns you have the worries you have the questions you have these brothers had it too so they sharing and then he told her go get your husband and come and she said I have no husband how our hearts jumped because we thought there was one time that's a failure yes Jesus had told a woman she had to go get her husband when she had no husband you remember the look that we had on each other's faces as we marveled to think that all the confidence we had in him and he was dropped all of a sudden then we find immediately he spoke up and said you have told the truth for you've had five husband husbands and the one you have now is not yours then you recognize him as the Messiah the Messiah of God and said we know that Messiah is coming you must be a prophet and stuff amen the brothers testifying when last have you testified about Jesus when last time you told somebody about a service that you went to and it was so powerful for your soul you couldn't help yourself you couldn't you couldn't keep it to yourself you had to tell everybody were you there how could you miss it when the Lord came and spoke to us along the way can the church say Amen brother sat it might have been young John who said you know I'll tell you what made it real to me is there someone that made it real to you young people without an experience that makes it real to you you'll backslide without an experience that makes it real to you you'll be depending on your mother's testimony your father's testimony the pastor's testimony but you there must be something that made it real to you so brother said then it might have been young John that said you know I'll tell you what made it real to me that day when he broke the bread we was all hungry and had went out into the Wilderness and we couldn't find him and there we met him and all the multitudes came around and the first thing you know we find him saying send them away to the city to get food and he told us to feed them then and he got these five biscuits and two little fish and he broke that bread and I noticed his hand when he reached back for another piece of bread that biscuit was growed out again this is the prophet talking and then when he reached back put it out in a plate then reached back that fish was growed out again not only the regular fish but it was cooked fish see already growed back again what manner of man is this this is the prophet what kind of an atom did he turn loose brethren cooked fish cooked bread bypassed the growing we know he was the creator but here he was making creation of already cooked fish and cooked [Applause] bread There's Hope for those who can't [Music] cook I see some young people smiling some people saying I can't wait for this power you know cooked bread cooked fish God knows I can't cook [Music] Hallelujah but that's the Messiah we're talking about just confounding the people confounding the minds those around John might have said to me like this you know when I was a little boy we lived down in Jericho and but the brandom said they're going on and on just testifying and telling the stories of what it was yes but then all of a sudden a storm begins to come yes because the devil is always watching and the devil always recognizing when there's a change in the pattern of your behavior Jesus is going to the other side that's not normal so the devil knows something is happening it's all right when you stay on your tur but you see when you going to pray for your family when you begin to pray longer when you begin to open your Bible and read at odd hours on the devil know you're normally watching TV and then all of a sudden you pull your Bible instead oh my then the devil knows something is about to happen so Jesus is on the Move he's sleeping but he's on the move because somebody's going to get delivered I say let's break the routine this morning let's do something we don't normally do it's all right if Satan gets mad there's nothing he could do about it because we come from God and we're going back to God Hallelujah Jesus was a mission and he was not letting no devil compromise the mission and a storm came and so many times Storms Come into our lives we didn't request the storm we didn't prepare for the storm we didn't ask for the storm you just go into your normal living and your life begins to rock your life begins to shake and the Bible said Water started coming into the boat Jesus must have been so tired the rocking didn't wake him the water didn't wake him the screams didn't wake him and the disciples were like what are we going to do should we wake Jesus should we wake the Messiah and out of fear by the Clarance they shook Jesus and this man who was sleeping he didn't start to scream with the rest of them he didn't start to worry with the rest of them he didn't grab a bucket to bail out the water he didn't say grab the life jackets or get a raft or let's go back let's Retreat let's turn around uh he looked up he said what is this why are you afraid what are you crying about what are you screaming about peace be still peace in your home peace in your life peace on your job peace in your body peace in your mind wherever the storm is Raging we speak peace be still this morning whatever the storm is peace oh Hallelujah and you know what I love about God you may be seated Jesus he didn't stay to watch to see if his words were having an effect when he spoke to his words he turned back around and went back to sleep because he know whenever he speaks his his words have got to come to pass and that's why I say to you parents in here just speak to your children turn around and you walk away and watch going worry about it there power in you this morning you are attribute sons of God what manner of man is [Applause] this oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah but he was more than a man and I want to challenge you this morning you are more than man you are more than just 16 elements uh they are men walking around the earth uh but you are sons of the Living God you are more than man you are more than 16 elements you are more than the body that you are in you are attribute sons of God there's power locked up in you what manner of man is this it's because he is not man he is oh the expression of God and this morning I'm speaking to the expressions of God you better worship God you better Praise Him you better thank him you better give him glory this morning hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah what manner of man is this he is more than a man in the message question and answers brother B said I said lady he was a man when he was weeping that's right he was a man when he was weeping but when he straightened his little frail body up and said to a man that had been dead for days Lazarus come forth and the man that had been dead Dead four days and Rutten and the skin worms crawling through him corruption knew its master and the Soul knew its creator and a man that had been dead 4 days stood to his feet and lived again that was more than a man oh glory to God I'm speaking the individuals this morning that a m and a man the devil tried to inflict your body for you to think you are just ordinary but you are more than a man this morning you are more than a man this morning the devil is temp but you are from eternity you are more than a man this morning listen to the prophet he was a man when he come down off the mountain that night hungry looking around over the tree for something to eat he was a man when he was looking there for something to eat on that fig tree but when he took five biscuits and two pieces of fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God in man that one Creator who could take cooked fish and break it off and it was still cooked fish took break bread and broke it off what kind of atom did he lose Hallelujah he was God the creator of atoms and all things that was more than a man oh Hallelujah my my man the prophet said he was a man when he was out there in that boat that night that same night we were talking about after preaching all day and Healing The Sick so tired till 10,000 Devils thank God for Prophet to explain what was taking place he said so tired till 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they would drown him they actually tried to kill Jesus but his time was not yet he was on a mission no weapon could have formed against him it could have been 50,000 Devils they couldn't stop him they couldn't stop him that little old boat out there bumping around like a bottle stopper the Great Waves are flashing from place to place and him laying so tired till the waves didn't wake him up the devil was a roaring we'll get him now while he's asleep but when he woke up there he was a man he was so tired but when he put his foot on the Braille of the boat and he said to that sea be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him that was more than a man that was God the Creator who made the heavens no wonder the Apostle said what manner of man is this that even the wind and the waves obey that was more than a man that was God glory to God hallelujah somebody preach back to me so don't let the devil lie to you he may be sitting and tell you you are ordinary and that your life is waking up in the morning and going into a job and come back home and that's a cycle that's natural that's nature that's this world but there another world to come and it's only those who are more than men will appreciate that new city thank God that you are elected and predestinated thank God that he has elected you to put you on the Wheel to spin you into shape so you can make it over there you are more than man this morning you are more than a sinner you are more than an unbeliever you are more than a backslider you could be Liv in any condition this morning but there's still something about you that the devil is trying to kill he's trying to stop but you are more than a conqueror this morning and you are going to be changed you are going to be transformed you are going to be filled with the Holy Ghost you are going to be delivered you are going to be set free you're going to have a jubilee you are going to shout you're going to worship you will put your foot on the neck of the devil you will stump all over the Philistines the amalekites the amorites the Hees the jebusites cancer leukemia whatever it is it's finished it's finished what manner of man is this it's that same Jesus veiled in 16 elements oh hallelujah hallelujah more than a man more than a man more than a man it was more than a man when the prophet could have said before the doctor's hands touches my wife the tumor will go down that wasn't man speaking that was more than a man that's why the devil is so scared because when Jesus died and said it is finished the devil say oh gosh finally it finished Joseph died and went on and that problem was solved Moses died and went on that problem was solved Elijah died and went on that problem was solved so when Jesus was on the cross brother bam said he was a man he was weeping he was in pain but after a while something begin to happen the Skies begin to get black the trees begin to shake because since even they have been waiting for something more than man something come from God to come back to restore the balance of power that was lost when Adam lost the book of names lost the book of redemption lost the book of power but that same man the devil messed up the devil made the biggest mistake because he thought it was finished but when Jesus died he went down right to the devil's Kingdom and knocked on the door they say but everybody's accounted for we have the VIP list the V VIP list the VV VIP list everybody's inside and there was somebody knocking on the door the same way he crossed to the other sign there was some souls in Paradise that he was coming to get Ezekiel was there Isaiah was there Joseph was there Moses was there but he has stood more than a man he has stood the mighty conqueror what manner of this what manner of man is this you can't even kill kill him and he stays dead when you kill him he gets back up again what manner of man is this you should be backslid but you're still here what manner of man is this you should be sad but there's a smile on your face what manner of man is this you fell in sin but you repented and you're back in the house of God what manner of man is this oh you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning what manner of man is this that devil press you against a wall you don't know what to do but there's something on the inside that's fighting for your soul something on the inside a seed that was buried there before the foundation of the world that seed in you is the believer the word in you is the believer That's What Makes You Different that's what makes you a [Applause] Christian Hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the house give the Lord a shout in the house give the Lord a shout in the house you are not the believer the word in you that's the believer you are not even the seed but the word seed in your soul the devil can't touch itth he wants to get to itth but he can't touch itth you are underneath the blood and the devil can't reach underneath of Blood Brother Clarence underneath the blood the devil could do you no harm no harm no harm no harm oh we are under the blood there seven T of blood the blood of this message is all over [Applause] you Redemption by blood red rtion by power present tense [Applause] Redemption you may be [Applause] seated I'm not preaching church I'm not preaching message I'm preaching Jesus because at the name Jesus oh there's power in the name of Jesus there power in the name of Jesus every knee will bow every tongue will confess there's power in the blood of Jesus there's still wonderwork in power there's still healing in the name of Jesus there's Deliverance in the name of Jesus something about the name Jesus it is the sweetest name I know oh hallelujah hallelujah is that how you feel this morning come on Benjamin is said how you feel this morning there's power there's power here this morning I don't care what condition you came in this morning you could go free this morning House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Jesus has crossed to the other side this morning he's said to break the chains uh break the shackles uh break what's locked up in your mind uh you may be [Applause] seated Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come on young people come on young people this is the oldtime gospel this is the real gospel your no boy can give you this no girl could give you this uh drugs cannot give you this uh the parties cannot give you [Music] [Applause] this hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh something about the name [Applause] Jesus Hallelujah you know what the brandom said that life is the thunder that shakes the devil is that doesn't even take words that life is the thunder that shakes the devil Jesus steps out of the boat and rests his foot on the shores of the other side and instinctively this man who he who they had problems with who they had tried to help suddenly rushes to Jesus to worship Him Jesus did not announce his presence there was no Entourage there was no Forerunner there was nobody to say that he was there but that life touched the elements that life started to affect the [Applause] Devils that was in this man so when Jesus stepped out he didn't even say a word he didn't sa but that power that was in him that life was thundering the devil's in that man say listen why are you comfor tormentous why you come to disturb us we have been living in this house undisturbed unaffected they have tried to cast us out before but we have not been bothered but we recognize who you are why you come to disturb us why you come to affect us why you come to set this man free oh oh you may be seated [Applause] H [Applause] Hallelujah the Bible says and brother brandom taught us the devil believes and he trembles I want you to acknowledge something that in that man's condition and this is for people in the message who don't want to Worship in this man's condition the Bible said he came to worship because he had to acknowledge that the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last the condition this man was in he was still clear to see what the spiritual super spiritual message believer can see he could see that he was worthy of worship he could see that he was worthy of the praise he [Applause] could [Applause] you may be see it for a minute I want this to be made clear young people Church of the Living God but brandom taught us we are created to worship the very name God the word God by definition is object of worship and brother Bram taught us you will worship something so if you don't worship God you're worshiping something else not because in the message means you suddenly My Worship is discret discret worship why they have altars and sacrifices and the incent the smoke going up for the high [Music] priest but you Worship in public with how you dress and what you talk about because what you reverence and respect and worship you talk about it whether it's your job it's your car it's your house it's economy it's politics you can worship anything you can make anything of God they take a golden Cal with no life and make it a god they take fish and make it God take all kind of stuff and make it God but this man listen to the words I just want to read it back again and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying he wasn't crying out of Happiness even though he was in his condition he knew something was wrong he knew he needed help he knew he needed a touch so he was there crying and cutting himself with stones it's almost he wanted to get what was ever in him he wanted to get it out but Mark 5 and verse 6 but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran he didn't even walk you hear what the pastor said last week if you're late to church on walk in run Hallelujah when he saw Jesus power off he ran and worship Him amen and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus now listen Jesus introduced himself but listen the man recognized the spirit Jesus thou son of the most high God so that's why there any backsliders in here the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom I don't care what condition you are in if you give God respect you give respects to the house of God you give respects to the pulpit you give respects to the word of God God will do something for you you young people in here who believe you are here because your parents tell you to come to church and only because you're under my roof that's why you're here you better be careful because that itself is the grace of God to you to grow up in a house that fears honor and respects God enough to want the best for you shame on you young people who have taken that for granted that God entrust into the hands of your parents as caregivers and caree Keepers that they have the heart for the Lord to tell you come to [Music] church worship God come into the Ark of Safety because the rain is coming the rain is about to fall don't be outside of the Ark I always wonder about Noah and his family because God didn't speak to Noah's wife he didn't speak to Noah's children he didn't speak to Noah's brothers and uncles Noah had the most daunting difficult challenge to convince everybody including his family to come to the ark whatever means he used to get his children into the ark I always raise to the church I wonder how the children felt when the door was shut and the rains began to fall when they could see their friends on the outside screaming can we still get in is there still a chance Hall as the water begins to rise it would have been painful whatever the names were hallelujah hallelujah help me help me I've known you my whole life and then people want to say how could God do this when Noah preached for years get into the ark and young people grow up in church hearing [Music] it going through the motions as it were coming to church taking a seat singing the song playing the roles right just as people who go to school for 5 years and get nothing yes I'm seeing it because there comes a point that you have to accept responsibility that if the teacher gave instruction or the pastor ministered the word is no longer under the pastor it's no longer under the teacher it's not the education system and it's not the church it's on you to take action when nobody else is watching action be it to study action be it to master your craft action be it to pray action to fast action to read the word the pastor cannot do this nor can the teacher or the principal or your boss on your job there's some point in your life you have to accept responsibility for what you do with the same 24 hours a day that everybody else [Applause] has you may be seated Jesus didn't have 36 hours in a day Moses didn't have 29 hours in the day Daniel didn't have 28 hours it was the same 24 hours that we have all always had but yet Daniel found time to pray what manner of man is this that could make time every day to pray what manner of man is this like David every day you meditate on the word blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sit it in the seat of a scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree that's planted by rivers of living do we have any Bible reading Christians in the [Applause] house what's your excuse this morning I saw a news report of an 81y old woman in Japan who just released a mobile app in the store the Apple Store at 81 the first time she touched a computer was at age 60 and at age 81 she might be the oldest person to write a mobile app for the Apple IE store and I asked myself what what's my excuse what's your excuse because at the end of the day achievements be it in the natural and in the spiritual there's only one formula sacrifice effort and work that's why when God put Adam in the Garden of Eden his job was to do what that's only 2% his job was to what work work all right prayer is work work is work but at the end of the day you have to work has preaching before before Adam had his wife he had what before Adam had his wife had [Applause] what so no work no [Music] wife I'm speaking The Headstone Tabernacle for those outside of headone listen to your pastor no work no wife headstone Tabernacle because God has a order he put manate say Adam tell the soil Adam working working money go in bank account working working he's saving working working after that Adam God say look you have enough in your bank account you have enough in place now he ready for a wife but what but what is this about God is a god of responsibility God has no spoil children in know and that's why I say when things come to people easy it goes away easy years ago we had people come to church Lord if I get a car I'll be in church every service the struggling to travel to church when they get the car you never seen them they in Beach they in Tam they reaching parts of the country I never even see and then some of us we want to know why God don't bless us more because some God give you too much you will do too much so thank God for that wheel because the Potter controls what happens on the Wheel to make sure that you make it to your destination make sure you get the Holy Ghost that woman with the issue of blood it was not her first position to go to Jesus it was after her money ran out she was desperate to look for alternative medicine and and her alternative medicine was I've heard that Jesus is in town and she said to herself didn't matter who said anything else if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole it was her desperation that contributed to her behavior and that's why for many of us in the house of God God has to bring us to the spot where the wheel turn so fast that we get desperate to say Lord I need a Holy Ghost Lord I Need A Touch Lord I need a fresh experience Lord help me Lord have mercy can the church say Amen bring back the real Christians bring back the real Believers bring back the real truth Seekers amen not coming to church to hear somebody to just feel good about yourself but you want to hear the truth that's what I love about the wheel when it's going good it's fine but when God sees something to correct break because he wants Perfection he doesn't want church members God doesn't even want Christians he wants Sons huge difference because that term Christian has been put into so many shapes forms and fashions that people and don't talk about message Believers I want to be like Jesus I want to be like him that's the only measure that's the Only Rule that's the only measur and stick that I want to be like Jesus Jesus stood there and he was a man but when he rose again he was he was more than man Hallelujah and God is so willing to share his power that when the devil thought it was finished here comes Peter Here Comes James and John and Andrew and then Here Comes somebody who was not even in the circle a guy called Saul who became Paul and start to do things that Jesus did then the devil realized that he had a real problem on his hand and then we see ages go by and every story that's why this gospel is dripping with blood it wasn't easy for Luther it wasn't easy for Wesley it wasn't easy for Simo and those and it wasn't easy for the prophet amen when ROM lost his wife and lost his child that was the wheel spinning because almighty God was going to Tabernacle himself in this man amen that we can look back and say what manner of man is that that a 20th century Prophet from Kentucky could be a wave she for us Amen to say there are others coming Hallelujah there'll be other young men there'll be other young women there'll be other Christians who will come and they will speak and their words will be created just like that that's a prophecy this bride will be his mouthpiece once more the world will hear direct from God amen Brandon was excited not about himself he was excited about what was to come what manner of men are these that could walk these countries When sin is everywhere when demons are [Applause] everywhere and see your family delivered and see young people reject what the devil has to offer reject the devil's offer I don't care how good it is if it's from the devil reject it it does not belong to you you have your inheritance you have your promise you have your healing you have your Victory you have your eternal life to [Applause] come sometimes young people we need to be shaken back into reality I wonder back in Noah's day when the rain started to fall how many people were wondering about their bank account or their house or their car or their Chariot or their horse or their donkey or whatever they had then all of a sudden your perspective changes I said to them in Marv some time ago there was an earthquake that day I said for that brief moment of that earthquake if you thinking about bank account when earthquake going on you ready you are unique you are in a special class if you could find in your mind to think about wow my chandelier in the midst of an earthquake your instin is to cover yourself hide not listen H let's fix this holy sh please because you realize in that brief moment your mortality you realize in that brief moment that heaven and Earth really will pass away but only God's word will pass away it's a reality check and it makes you realize I said to my wife some time ago have the stuff that we stress about is not wor stressing about half the stuff we worry about you know worrying is sin you you never heard this one worrying is a sin if the birds have to worry where to get in food why you worrying yeah Jesus say hand it I said this to them in cania one time Jesus said cast all your cares upon me and some of us we do that part you know we cast our cares upon Him and we turn around and then you know what we go and take it back and that's what worrying is because if you hand something to God it's either he could fix it or he cannot so if he could fix it why are you taking it back and that is what prayer is Lord I need help with this this this when you put it on him but so stressed a thing and and God is saying well why you came to me in the first place because while I'm fixing it you're go and tell everybody you have this big problem hallu but is like that's not how the normal Services is go this is reality you know you know Jesus it is a reason Jesus Took Parables to preach to people to make it simple because we have become so super spiritual we have lost sight of God a long time ago but God wants practical living it's either Faith or no faith it's either your love or you there's no middle ground it's either you're hot or you're cold but it's lukewarm one minute on top of the mountain why is it by Tuesday you down in the valley hallall is a slide so may you just take a slide on top slide on by Tuesday Valley Nobody Knows the God help you if get the Thursday night service by Sunday it's crank crank is a whole wheel there a whole thing pulling you back up on top of the mountain but you know if you pray every day if you read every day that's why I tell people it's impossible for you to get an argument with your neighbor if you were just reading the Bible it's a real leap brother kangali to go from reading a scripture and praying to cussing out the neighbor it's a real it's a very it's a immense leap you cannot walk out of a prayer meeting and just walk in that fight the anointing takes some time to come over you that's why if you practice the presence of God listen to The Prophet one time the prophet went to minister and he the brothers took him to a hotel room and as he stepped in he stopped he said I need another room because adultery was communicated was committed in this room last night and the Spurs were still there one time at the bam is driving and he said he picked up somebody and he said they spoke a Blue Streak and affected the anointing yes and it teaches us a lesson about practicing the presence of God hallelujah there's some people you cannot spend time with and whenever you find yourself in trouble you have to get to the root cause of the problem it is something that You' have been doing that led to you getting in trouble you cannot just find yourself in fornication there's always a lead [Music] up anybody in the house this morning that's why the word says pray and meditate day and night Joshua be strong and very courageous yes Hallelujah but there was a condition meditate on the word day and night and that is to have him have good success how could you have success outside of God what type of Christian are you when you say you're a Christian and you leave your house in a morning without prayer without acknowledging God this might be simple but it's the truth bring back the old Time family prayer bring back the prayer there's no Revival that could ever come without prayer no way no mystery brings Revival no preaching brings Revival no word brings Revival it takes prayer it takes sacrifice it takes fasting it takes sighing it takes crying that's the only formula for revival can the Church Say [Applause] Amen I've done going way ahead of my time but I pray that in some way this word would help somebody Hallelujah somebody say Amen may we just skip ahead can we give him worship this morning so what manner of man is this so friends I'm looking for Real Men Real Women of God that could be in the spirit could walk in the spirit could talk in the spirit could live in the spirit could act in the spirit in the message no let me just skip that just give me quite a bit amen amen hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus Hallelujah bless so Jesus is standing there and he's ministering to this man who had been bound and when he cast that evil spirit out the neighborhoods The Village the community they were shocked because they had given up on him they couldn't believe that this man was in his right man in his right mind and he was clothed and I and I love that because when he was possessed brother Terence he took all his clothes off the moment he was delivered he put his clothes on amen amen so when you see people taking close off it's directly tight to the degree of possession but when you start to get back to God all of a sudden your clothes have to come back on so you young people who want to be copying the world without Revelation and because your friends doing that it's spirits that you're dealing with you're not dealing with people who are people you're dealing with spirits that are walk in the Earth but the B said we want complete deliverance we don't want to be a halfway church we want to be a real Church or no church at all we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all we want Total deliverance from our habits from our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence whatever we have done we want Total Deliverance so that when people come into this church to be prayed for there'll be just this little group maybe not over a 100 or 200 sitting here but they'll be completely in the hands of God and when we pray then God will hear from Heaven God wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say I got confidence in I can send this my sick servant to the brandom Tabernacle and I say this morning I can send this my sick servant to headstone Tabernacle and that group of people are in one Accord something will happen and brother brandham went on he said that's the way Moses and his group did they got over there and got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total Deliverance Moses himself he was unified with God but Israel wasn't there still was sin and they murmured against Moses and they said why you do this you bring more trouble upon us but Moses was different he was completely in the hand of God totally delivered from sheep hurting to hurt God's sheep he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there were still murmuring among them but one night when God ordained that a lamb should be killed a type of Christ and the blood was dipped in his up which his weeds comeon humble and put over the lintle of the door and on the post that's when Israel became completely delivered and not a ho left behind all that belonged to them was delivered their families their loved ones and everything was delivered when they completely come under the blood and listen to the prophet here's a prophet prophecy that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when your smoking comes under the blood when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought under the blood then there'll be a total Deliverance if you have wronged somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it something won't let you do it when yourself is completely totally brought under the blood there'll be a total Deliverance then you'll have a freedom woo like you've never known before when everything's brought under the blood brought in submissive to the kingdom of God then there'll be a real Deliverance all Jesus's work was complete when that man met Jesus he was completely delivered he wasn't part delivered he was totally delivered all Jesus Works was complete everything was complete totally delivered listen to the prophet he totally delivered the leper from leprosy he totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live under privileged people there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because he defeated the and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet oh and the prophet said and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have the devil dictator us Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from Habits delivered us from talk him delivered us from all kinds of smarty things he totally delivered us and put us into his holy hands a complete total [Applause] Deliverance oh my the musician could get ready I'm getting ready to wind now now just 10 more minutes listen to The Prophet Hallelujah listen to how he defined total Deliverance now he said the disciples brother kangi had total Deliverance absolutely Ely total Deliverance why because they were completely and totally filled with the Holy Ghost that's the definition of total Deliverance uh not just go and sin no more but totally filled with the Holy Ghost and that's what I'm looking for this morning that's what I'm looking for this season to see young people to see mothers fathers to see Elders deacons trusties ushers everybody filled so much with the Holy Ghost that there's no room for the devil listen Satan will be bound by circumstance you know why there'll be no vessels for him to use now listen to me church if the devil cannot find a place in brother mundas and he cannot find a place in brother Anne and he cannot find a place in brother Mikey and he cannot find a place in with the terance and he cannot find a place in the kangali and he cannot find a place in the Gerome and he goes through this camp and can't find somebody to use then the devil has to go somewhere else because there's nobody because the devil needs flesh he needs somebody to use and if God could find Mother Mundus and could step into brother MERS and if God could step in the brother Anne and could step in the brother Kangal and could step in the brother Gideon and he could take over this whole building and we could be in one mind and we could be at one Accord what a jubilee we will have it'll be what manner of man is this what manner of people is this uh what manner of church is this uh what manner of Revival is this uh it will not be man-made uh it will not be fabricated but it'll be the Holy Ghost itself uh there will be one more ride uh can the church say [Applause] Amen oh last quote from a message toal deliverance we all want to be United but say we all want to be unified together with the Holy Spirit every member should be unified one with the other the love of of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost it cleanseth us you may be being a place offer cleansed us from all unrighteousness we are delivered from the things of the world Jesus said by this will all men know that you are my disciples when you've got love one for another when one member loves the other member so much that it would die for it begin to play some softly friends when Jesus said we need to go to the other side that was love love is an action word you can't say your love and do nothing about it love is an action word and Jesus was prepared to go through whatever it took because that man needed to be delivered he was prepared to go against the criticism no doubt they would have faced how could you go over there Peter you know better than that you went to the land of gadara with those filthy Sinners but Jesus came to the Sinners he came to the sick Jesus said they that are well have no need of a doctor he said I've come to heal the brokenhearted I've come to comfort those that mourn so Jesus loves to cross to the other side he loves to come to meet you at the point of your need I don't know what your need is I don't know where your standing is this morning but he knows and this service God has stepped through his word to the other side he has stepped into your house he has stepped into your family situation he has stepped where you are at right now wherever that is to deliver you I want to encourage you God told cane if you do what your brother did he would get blessed

and you know if you have totally surrendered yourself to him amen this message this morning is to anybody who wants to be delivered from anything because that's why Jesus came I don't know what your situation is I don't know what your condition is with every head bowed every eye closed this morning Hallelujah Jesus is here right now Hallelujah I don't want to speak a message like this without giving the opportunity for somebody to come to the altar somebody to make things right you know you know your situation you know your need this morning he is here not only a storm did he go through
