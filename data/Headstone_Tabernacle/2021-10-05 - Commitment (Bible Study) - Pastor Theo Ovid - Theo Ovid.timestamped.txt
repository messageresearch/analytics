[13:38] i'll be taking a study tonight and
[13:40] i have something i'd like to share with
[13:41] you
[13:44] let's go
[13:46] you cannot defeat a full-time devil
[13:49] being a part-time christian
[13:52] there are so many
[13:54] just want to do the minimum to get by
[13:57] eat at school
[13:59] at home
[14:00] [Music]
[14:01] in a marriage
[14:03] or on the job
[14:05] taking enough of the word to make you
[14:07] feel comfortable
[14:09] but not convicted
[14:12] not convicted of anything
[14:16] the desire to be an excellent worker
[14:20] excellent student
[14:22] excellent silver
[14:25] in order to strive to the mark
[14:28] or move to a higher level
[14:31] it will take something
[14:33] and that is what i want to speak on
[14:34] tonight
[14:36] this has been
[14:38] the backbone of my life
[14:40] my ministry
[14:42] my marriage
[14:43] this part of my core
[14:46] is not something you're born with
[14:48] it is something that you can develop
[14:51] by the grace of god
[14:53] not your feelings
[14:56] not your emotions not your thoughts
[14:59] but your commitment
[15:01] and that is what i want to title this
[15:03] bible study tonight just one small word
[15:06] commitment
[15:08] and if you have your bible i'd like to
[15:10] turn to luke chapter 9
[15:12] and we want to read from verse 56
[15:15] to 62.
[15:16] it's a bible study you should have your
[15:18] bible nearby
[15:19] and try to follow with us with the
[15:21] scriptures because
[15:22] in it as life
[15:25] and this is jesus
[15:27] luke 9 verse 56 jesus speaking
[15:31] he said for the son of man is not come
[15:33] to destroy men's lines
[15:36] but to save them
[15:38] and they went to another village and it
[15:40] came to pass
[15:42] that as they went in the way
[15:44] a certain man said unto him lord i will
[15:47] follow thee with us over thou goeth
[15:50] and jesus said unto him foxes are holes
[15:53] and birds of the air
[15:55] have nests but the son of man had not
[15:57] where the layers here
[16:00] and he said unto another follow me
[16:03] this is jesus tell us follow me he said
[16:05] lord suffer me first the one bury my
[16:06] father
[16:08] and jesus
[16:10] said unto him
[16:12] let the dead bury their dead but go down
[16:15] and preach
[16:16] the kingdom of god
[16:19] and another also said lord i will follow
[16:21] thee but let me first go bid them
[16:24] farewell which are at whom
[16:26] at my house
[16:28] and look listen to jesus words here in
[16:31] verse 62
[16:33] and jesus said unto him
[16:36] no man
[16:37] having put his hands to the plow
[16:40] and looking back is fit
[16:43] for the kingdom of god you know
[16:46] by this scripture here you can see jesus
[16:48] was practical
[16:50] jesus was real
[16:52] he spoke truth
[16:54] he didn't fool them or tried to play a
[16:56] game with word games with them
[16:58] he said it plainly no man
[17:00] having put his hand
[17:02] to the plow
[17:03] and looking back is fit
[17:05] for the kingdom of god in other words if
[17:08] you see it run with it
[17:10] if you see it
[17:11] hold it
[17:13] being committed
[17:16] meaning pledged or born
[17:19] to a certain course or policy
[17:23] abraham was committed
[17:25] elijah was committed let's turn to the
[17:26] book of root
[17:28] and look at chapter one we want to look
[17:29] at the book of root
[17:31] it's a beautiful book i
[17:33] just some time
[17:35] um
[17:36] you know we could get down in that book
[17:38] but it's that and i want to appreciate
[17:39] but isaac
[17:40] at this time i want to
[17:42] know sometimes he's weary and tired but
[17:44] you want to appreciate him and right
[17:46] where you are could give him a little
[17:47] applause he can't hear you but we
[17:48] certainly want to appreciate
[17:50] and he
[17:51] has is the one that had this burden for
[17:54] his bible class a long time not
[17:57] way before we had the pandemic way
[17:59] before we had all resumed he had that
[18:01] burden and said then like if we could
[18:03] get something with the bible a bible
[18:05] study so we certainly appreciate that it
[18:07] has been his burden and god has
[18:09] tremendously blessed it root chapter one
[18:12] read verse one now it came to pass in
[18:15] the days when the judges ruled
[18:17] that there was a famine in the land the
[18:19] citizen man of bethlehem judah went to
[18:21] journal in the country of moab he and
[18:23] his wife
[18:24] and his two sons first thing is supposed
[18:27] to stay where god put you
[18:30] but they leave the land and they
[18:32] went to moa
[18:34] and the name of the man was amalek the
[18:36] name of his wife naomi
[18:38] the name of his two sons malone chilean
[18:41] ephratites of bethlehem judah and they
[18:42] came into the country of moab and
[18:44] continued there
[18:46] and mlx naomi husband died and she was
[18:49] left and her two sons and they took them
[18:51] wives
[18:52] the woman of moa the name of the one was
[18:54] offer
[18:55] the other name of the other was ruth and
[18:57] they dwelled there about 10 years
[19:00] marlon chilean died also both of them
[19:02] and woman was left of her two sons and a
[19:05] husband
[19:07] then she arose with her daughter-in-laws
[19:09] that she might return from the country
[19:10] of moab for she had heard here we go in
[19:13] the country of moab oh that the lord
[19:16] has visited his people and given them
[19:19] bread
[19:20] wherefore she went forth out of the
[19:22] place where she was
[19:23] and her two daughters in law with her
[19:25] and they went on the way
[19:27] to return to the land of judah
[19:30] and naomi said unto her
[19:32] two daughters-in-law go
[19:34] return each to her mother's house the
[19:36] lord be kindly with you as you have
[19:39] dealt with the dead and with me the lord
[19:42] grant you that you may find rest each of
[19:44] you in the house of her husband
[19:46] then she kissed them
[19:48] they lifted up their voice and went
[19:51] and they said until surely we will
[19:53] return with thee unto thy people
[19:56] and no naomi said turn again my
[19:58] daughters why will he go with me are
[20:00] there any more sons in my womb that they
[20:03] may be your husbands tell them again my
[20:04] daughters go away if i'm too old to have
[20:07] a husband and if i should have i have
[20:09] hope if i should have a husband also
[20:11] tonight should also be a sons would you
[20:14] tarry for them till they are grown would
[20:16] you stay for them having husbands me my
[20:20] daughters for it grievously much for
[20:22] your sakes that the hand of the lord has
[20:24] gone out
[20:25] against me
[20:26] and they lifted up
[20:27] the voice and ripped again
[20:29] an offer kissed her mother-in-law
[20:32] and root
[20:33] clave unto her
[20:35] she said behold my sister-in-law is
[20:37] going back unto her people
[20:39] unto her gods return thou after thy
[20:42] sister-in-law
[20:43] and root said
[20:45] entreat me not to leave thee or return
[20:48] from following
[20:50] after thee
[20:51] for whether thou goest
[20:53] i will go
[20:54] where thou lodges
[20:56] i will lodge
[20:57] thy people
[20:59] shall be my people
[21:00] and my and thy god
[21:03] my god
[21:04] where thou diest will i die
[21:06] where will i and dear will i be buried
[21:09] the lord do so to me and more also
[21:13] if ought but that part d and me
[21:15] and when she saw
[21:18] that she was
[21:19] steadfastly minded to go with her
[21:23] then she left speaking with her
[21:26] isn't that a beautiful scripture tonight
[21:28] two daughter-in-laws
[21:31] one went back
[21:33] and once stood there and says your god
[21:34] with my god where are you who i go
[21:37] are you losing a lodge
[21:39] my people shall be my people
[21:41] and thy god shall be my god
[21:44] she was steadfast
[21:46] she was she made up her mind
[21:48] she made a clear
[21:50] and clean decision and her commitment
[21:53] to go all the way to the point where she
[21:57] could see where thou diest will i die
[22:00] and where will i be there will i be
[22:02] buried the lord do so to me and most
[22:07] this word commitment
[22:10] and this is like a dictionary of meaning
[22:13] of it the state or quality of being
[22:15] dedicated to a cause
[22:17] activity
[22:20] the
[22:20] cinnamon synonym
[22:27] loyalty
[22:29] faithfulness
[22:31] responsibility obligation duty
[22:34] burden
[22:36] an agreement a pledge to do something in
[22:38] the future
[22:40] a commitment to improve
[22:43] the definition of a commitment
[22:45] is a promise or agreement to do
[22:48] something
[22:49] that is what a commitment not to talk
[22:52] to do an example of commitment is
[22:55] marriage
[22:57] or go into business with someone
[23:00] a state of being emotionally or
[23:02] intellectually devoted as to a belief
[23:05] a cause or action or another person
[23:10] we want to look at
[23:12] commitment to god
[23:15] and
[23:16] i want to read from deuteronomy chapter
[23:18] 27 of your bibles
[23:23] verse 7 deuteronomy chapter 27
[23:27] verse 7
[23:29] and this is
[23:31] being spoken to israel
[23:33] and thou shalt offer peace offerings and
[23:34] shall eat there
[23:36] and rejoice
[23:38] before the lord thy god this is verse 7
[23:39] of deuteronomy
[23:41] 27
[23:43] and thou shalt write upon the stones
[23:46] all the words of this law very plainly
[23:50] now let me pause a minute holy bible
[23:52] right there now remember
[23:55] these people were 400 plus years in
[23:58] egypt
[24:00] they were familiar with egyptian food
[24:01] stars gods and everything else
[24:04] ghosts and a prophet moses to bring them
[24:06] out to bring them to this mountain of
[24:08] god to give them lords
[24:11] to give them words
[24:12] to give them truths
[24:14] because they didn't know this god
[24:17] that's why moses asked god who shall i
[24:20] say send me
[24:21] because this kind of people not easy you
[24:23] can't just say god send me
[24:25] they're not going to just take that you
[24:27] have to have backup you have to have
[24:28] vindication
[24:30] so understand this this word is not a
[24:33] game
[24:34] this word is a revelation of course
[24:36] nature operation desires what he wants
[24:39] from us what he deserves what he expects
[24:42] that he himself has a commitment to his
[24:44] word
[24:45] actually he and his word is the same
[24:48] he has to keep his word in order to be
[24:50] god verse nine and moses and the priests
[24:52] the levites speak unto all israel saying
[24:56] take heed
[24:58] and
[24:58] or israel
[25:00] this day
[25:01] though i become
[25:04] the people of the lord
[25:06] thy god
[25:07] so he's introducing them this day
[25:09] the what become
[25:12] the people of the lord thy god thou
[25:14] shalt therefore obey the voice of the
[25:16] lord thy god
[25:18] and do his commandments
[25:21] and his statutes
[25:22] which i command thee this day
[25:26] amen let's look at joshua chapter 24
[25:30] and verse 14.
[25:36] and then we go back to deuteronomy 10
[25:37] let's go to joshua chapter 24 verse 14
[25:40] and now therefore fear the lord
[25:43] serve him in sincerity and in truth
[25:47] and put away the gods
[25:50] which your father served on the other
[25:52] side of the flood
[25:54] and in egypt
[25:56] and still be the lord
[25:58] and
[25:59] on a pausing minute
[26:01] some time ago
[26:03] i was thinking
[26:06] and i didn't i haven't really worked on
[26:08] it
[26:09] but it was coming to me about idolatry
[26:12] about god something brother isaac struck
[26:14] it on sunday
[26:16] you could make this a god a kya god and
[26:17] whatnot
[26:19] and if there was ever age of gods is
[26:21] this age
[26:22] facebook is like a god
[26:24] social media is like a god
[26:26] don't talk about the phone
[26:28] you know i
[26:30] it's almost like it's a worship with
[26:32] this thing called this cell phone this
[26:34] this phone you know long time it had no
[26:36] pictures it had no screen
[26:38] long time you stand up
[26:40] with a coin there was a dial up you had
[26:42] to wait in line to put your coin to make
[26:44] dials up to talk to somebody and then
[26:47] you had the phone where you had no
[26:49] pictures you're pressing and you just
[26:50] put your ears on your top but now it's
[26:53] it's like a tv neon
[26:55] it's everything that is right there
[26:57] in the palm of your hand like a god
[27:00] people use it for everything
[27:03] and it could become an idol
[27:05] you have to glance at it you have to
[27:06] look at it you have to look at what's up
[27:08] who sent me a message you have to look
[27:09] at this and look at that and
[27:11] it takes away it takes time to do all of
[27:14] that
[27:14] deuteronomy chapter 10 we want to
[27:17] go into it so sometimes i'm going to go
[27:18] into it because
[27:20] they have gods
[27:22] and um
[27:24] gods you have not a god before you
[27:27] so you can't quit social media you can't
[27:29] put
[27:30] cell phone you can't put anything before
[27:32] god it has to be stripped
[27:34] and i trust them that this come in a
[27:36] reality that this these scriptures we
[27:38] are reading tonight is not like old kind
[27:41] words or old time scripture this is the
[27:43] god of the bible
[27:45] joshua chapter 24 dr chapter running
[27:49] chapter 10 rather deuteronomy chapter 10
[27:51] reading from verse 12. we will do 11 13.
[27:54] not jump and jump in here but we will
[27:56] jump jump with me
[27:57] you can read chapter 10 verses 12 13.
[28:00] and now israel
[28:02] what does
[28:04] the lord thy god require of thee
[28:07] but to fear the lord thy god
[28:10] to walk in all his ways
[28:13] and to love him
[28:15] and to serve the lord i go with all thy
[28:17] heart and all thy soul
[28:20] to keep
[28:21] the commandments of the lord
[28:23] and his statutes which i command you
[28:26] this day for thy good
[28:28] for thy good so that is all god required
[28:31] to fear the lord
[28:33] walk in his ways
[28:34] to love him
[28:35] to serve him with all your heart not
[28:37] some all with all thy soul and keep the
[28:40] command
[28:42] joshua 22 5 says
[28:47] but take
[28:51] take diligent heed
[28:54] to do the commandments of the law
[28:56] which moses the servants of the lord
[28:58] charge you
[29:00] to love the lord your god
[29:02] and to walk in all his ways
[29:05] and to his keep his commandments and the
[29:08] cleave unto him
[29:09] and to serve him with all your heart
[29:13] and soul
[29:15] you'd have to find this one but i'll
[29:16] just read it through from judges chapter
[29:18] 6
[29:20] 9-10 judges chapter 6 9-10
[29:23] and this is god speaking
[29:25] and i
[29:26] delivered you
[29:28] out of the hand of the egyptians
[29:31] and
[29:32] you know
[29:33] i think brother isaac was preaching
[29:35] sometimes this is a bible study and
[29:36] talking about people's attitude after
[29:39] god blessed them and so on the attitude
[29:42] how it troubles god and
[29:44] when god started
[29:46] sending manna and so on they complain
[29:48] about the manner with the lord is like
[29:50] bread and it taste tastes like whatever
[29:53] it is and you know they have an attitude
[29:55] of things that didn't create of things
[29:58] that they didn't started
[29:59] and this is god saying here
[30:01] and
[30:02] and i delivered you
[30:04] out of the hand of the egyptians out of
[30:07] the hand of all that oppress you and
[30:09] drave them out from before you and give
[30:12] you dear land
[30:14] and i said unto you i am the lord your
[30:17] god fear not the gods of the amorites in
[30:21] whose land you dwell
[30:22] but you have not
[30:24] obeyed
[30:25] my voice
[30:26] now
[30:27] god had to remind this people
[30:30] one he delivered them
[30:32] he brought him out out oppression and
[30:34] you see when the attitude is
[30:37] why
[30:38] why are we here through this wilderness
[30:40] why are we going through what we are
[30:42] going through
[30:43] we as we are
[30:44] we may as well have stayed in egypt
[30:47] that is enough to make god furious
[30:49] because god went through all these years
[30:51] wait and tyrion to lose moses to get
[30:53] them out and when they get them out they
[30:55] get them come out they have attitudes
[30:57] you see so he said i said unto you i am
[31:00] the lord your god
[31:01] fear not the gods of the amorites and i
[31:04] could say this fear not the gods of
[31:06] anything out there if you are want to
[31:07] save the lord because he's going to
[31:09] protect you
[31:10] think about these things
[31:12] think about how much things you have
[31:13] been through and you're still alive
[31:14] you're still alive and kicking you're
[31:15] still you don't have a roof over your
[31:17] head you have some place to sleep you
[31:19] still have a me on your table we have a
[31:22] lot to praise god about amen
[31:24] now let's look the first samuel chapter
[31:27] seven one verse there verse three
[31:30] after the first samuel we want to hit
[31:32] first chronicles chapter 28. so you just
[31:34] run through subscriptions tonight
[31:36] i'm exhorting you for samuel 7 3
[31:40] and samuel
[31:42] speak unto all the hosts of israel
[31:44] saying
[31:46] if
[31:47] ye do return unto the lord
[31:50] with all your hearts now you notice that
[31:52] they're talking about all your heart all
[31:53] your soul
[31:55] in other words i don't think god is of
[31:57] prayer
[31:58] i don't think god is of shallow
[32:01] i don't think god is this halfway
[32:04] attitude in christianity
[32:07] i think
[32:08] it has to come
[32:09] to
[32:11] uh like elijah say if god be god save
[32:13] him if bl is god serbia
[32:16] but let the golden answer by fire let's
[32:18] make god
[32:19] notice so far
[32:21] in all what we're talking about thus far
[32:24] in commitment we're not talking about
[32:25] church
[32:27] they're talking about the lord
[32:29] we're not talking about your boss you're
[32:31] not talking about your neighbor your
[32:32] husband your wife we're talking about
[32:34] the lord
[32:35] what if every husband
[32:37] serves the lord with all their hearts
[32:40] do as for the kingdom of god in their
[32:43] home and house what every wife
[32:45] is concerned about oh god sees an
[32:47] attitude and a behavior and a word
[32:50] what if the children
[32:51] want to please the lord
[32:53] you see how different the home going to
[32:55] be
[32:56] but it starts with this commitment i'm
[32:59] going to serve him
[33:01] i'm going to walk in his word
[33:03] i'm going to keep his word
[33:05] i'm going to walk in the light of his
[33:07] righteousness i'm going to get out of
[33:08] that commitment to the word
[33:10] right now we're just going through to
[33:12] god and samuel speak this verse three
[33:14] first samuel seven three samuel is
[33:16] speaking to all the hogs of israel
[33:17] saying if
[33:19] you do return unto the lord with all
[33:21] your hearts then then
[33:23] then put away the strange gods
[33:26] and asteroth from among you
[33:29] and
[33:30] prepare your hearts unto the lord
[33:33] and serve him only
[33:35] and here we go and he will deliver you
[33:38] out of the hand of the philistines
[33:41] now we know the story when israel
[33:43] backside there's some philistine there's
[33:45] some king of babylon somebody taking
[33:46] them in captivity until they turn to the
[33:48] lord
[33:49] notice the process here if you return to
[33:51] the lord with all your hearts then you
[33:53] have something to do
[33:55] put away these strange gods that's what
[33:57] i'm saying people want to be comfortable
[33:59] enough to hear the word with the church
[34:02] here singing and specials and so on like
[34:04] that but they don't want to hear enough
[34:07] that would convict them to change
[34:11] and sometimes people stuck
[34:13] in the pain of their lives
[34:15] and the pain of what has happened to
[34:17] them or what they have done
[34:19] and it's not painful enough as to effect
[34:22] change
[34:24] because that is what god released all
[34:26] these trials and pressures to do
[34:28] not for you to be under pressure and
[34:31] under pain no
[34:33] for it to effect
[34:35] change
[34:36] i want you to think about that
[34:38] it's not god want to punish you
[34:41] god wanted to adjust your behavior
[34:44] first chronicles chapter 28
[34:46] we want to read from eight and nine
[34:49] this is david
[34:51] speaking to his
[34:53] son
[34:55] just before that he says verse eight now
[34:57] therefore in the sight of all israel
[35:00] the congregation of the lord
[35:02] and in the audience
[35:04] of our god
[35:06] keep
[35:08] and seek this is uh first chronicles
[35:11] chapter 28 verse 8 to 9.
[35:14] now therefore in the sight of all israel
[35:18] the congregation of the lord
[35:21] and in the audience of our god keep
[35:24] and seek for all the commandments of the
[35:27] lord your god
[35:29] that he may possess this good land
[35:32] and leave it for inheritance for your
[35:34] children after you forever
[35:37] endow
[35:38] solomon
[35:39] my son
[35:42] who now this is david he's about to
[35:45] leave he's talking to his son
[35:48] and thou
[35:49] solomon
[35:50] my son
[35:52] no
[35:53] doubt the god of thy father
[35:56] and serve him
[35:58] with a perfect heart
[36:00] and with a willing mind
[36:02] no no
[36:04] these words are
[36:05] and as but isaac will say
[36:07] when you're driving slow when you're
[36:09] slow down you see more things
[36:11] serve him with a perfect heart and a
[36:14] what
[36:15] a willing mind
[36:17] for the lord searched all hearts
[36:20] you could fool me but you careful him
[36:22] why for the lord sutured all hearts
[36:26] and understand it
[36:28] all
[36:29] imaginations of the thoughts
[36:33] if
[36:34] you seek him
[36:36] so he wasn't telling solomon
[36:38] you are entitled to be blessed the way i
[36:41] was blessed
[36:43] you're entitled to the throne you are my
[36:45] son and god you're highly favored and
[36:47] and i always say look you're too blessed
[36:49] to be stressed he's not telling david
[36:50] that netanyahu
[36:52] he said if
[36:54] thou seek him
[36:56] he will be fond of thee
[36:58] but if thou forsake him
[37:01] he will cast thee off forever
[37:04] so this is real
[37:07] this is the god of the bible
[37:09] this is not playing games
[37:12] this is
[37:13] david talking to solomon his son david
[37:16] is anointed david is called david was
[37:18] king this is his son it's all about
[37:20] commissioned the temple david leave the
[37:22] drawings everything is dear everything
[37:24] is set but yet this would have portioned
[37:27] if thou seek him he will be fond of thee
[37:30] but if they'll forsake him he will cast
[37:32] the old forever
[37:36] jump into the new testament romans 6 17
[37:39] i'll say it quickly but god be thanked
[37:42] all
[37:42] that he was servants of sin
[37:45] but you have obeyed from the heart
[37:47] that
[37:49] form of doctrine
[37:51] which
[37:52] was
[37:53] delivered to you
[37:54] let me read it again but god be typed
[37:57] that you were servants of sin but you
[37:59] have what
[38:00] obeyed
[38:02] from that that means
[38:04] you could hear
[38:06] what you don't have to be
[38:08] you could be instructed
[38:10] but you do have to follow instructions
[38:12] that's why proverbs because solomon
[38:15] we're talking about here my instructions
[38:17] your son listen to my instructions hide
[38:21] seek after wisdom get knowledge get
[38:24] understanding why that you may know how
[38:27] to do how to act
[38:29] right so that is why the words are so
[38:32] perfect the bible is a perfect book
[38:34] thank god be thanked that he was
[38:37] servants of sin but he have obeyed from
[38:40] the heart
[38:41] that
[38:42] form of doctrine
[38:44] which was delivered to you
[38:46] oh my
[38:47] and we want to look at jeremiah chapter
[38:50] 42
[38:51] say we this is scriptures tonight yeah
[38:53] it's a bible bible study
[38:56] jeremiah chapter 42
[38:58] i want to read verse 46
[39:02] hallelujah you love him tonight you've
[39:04] got some praises oh thank you lord thank
[39:06] you all for your word
[39:08] jeremiah 42
[39:09] verse 4
[39:11] then
[39:12] jeremiah the prophet said unto them
[39:16] i have heard you
[39:18] behold
[39:20] i will pray unto the lord your god
[39:23] according to your words
[39:26] and it shall come to pass that whatever
[39:29] thing the lord shall answer you
[39:32] i will declare it unto you
[39:35] i will keep
[39:36] nothing back from you
[39:39] then be said to jeremiah
[39:42] the lord be true and faithful witness
[39:45] between us
[39:47] if we do not even according to all
[39:49] things for which the lord thy god shall
[39:51] send me to us
[39:52] whether it be good
[39:54] whether it be evil we will
[39:57] obey
[39:59] the voice of the lord our god
[40:02] to whom we send thee
[40:05] and it will be well with us
[40:08] when we obey the voice of the lord of
[40:11] our god give the lord a humble praise
[40:13] for the scripture give the lord a
[40:14] hundred priests wherever you are
[40:16] this is the people saying jeremiah they
[40:18] must say i hold nothing back for me okay
[40:21] whatever god say i'm going to tell you
[40:23] i'm going to let you know what god said
[40:25] and they say whether it be good people
[40:27] whether it be evil we will
[40:30] obey
[40:31] the voice of the lord our god to whom we
[40:35] send thee
[40:36] that it will be well with us
[40:38] when we obey the voice of the lord oh
[40:41] god saints isn't that a beautiful thing
[40:44] isn't it an assurant thing
[40:46] to know in obeying god's voice the
[40:49] blessings is guaranteed
[40:53] isn't that a tremendous thing
[40:55] note
[40:56] we're not talking about church
[40:59] we're not talking about church we're
[41:01] talking about the lord thy god
[41:03] now
[41:04] remember what abram says they were the
[41:07] people of god and when they got called
[41:09] out they became the church of god and
[41:11] they were figurative and tight of us
[41:14] coming out you see to become god's
[41:17] church and remember holy church was
[41:19] built jesus said hold on he's upon this
[41:21] rock i will build my church
[41:23] so it's a church that jesus built and
[41:25] this church is built of course by
[41:27] revelation and revelations come by the
[41:29] word
[41:30] being revealed to you
[41:32] revelation come by the spirit
[41:34] of bringing the word strong to your
[41:37] heart
[41:38] so therefore god are to send preachers
[41:40] ministers pastors prophets whatever to
[41:43] deliver the word to you and by the
[41:45] medium of the word the spirit could pick
[41:47] it up and reveal
[41:49] to you his thoughts
[41:52] not time magazine
[41:54] not the trinidad guardian
[41:57] not some american or european magazine
[41:59] not thoughts from that
[42:01] you'll catch what i'm saying
[42:02] so
[42:03] so this revelation is not knowledge and
[42:06] information of humans
[42:09] or give the lord some praise
[42:11] this revelation
[42:13] is the mind of god
[42:16] i see people believing things on the
[42:18] internet as if it does say the lord all
[42:20] kind of liars crooks all kind of evil
[42:22] spirits they don't know what behind them
[42:23] people but they're sharing videos and
[42:25] sharing clips they're sharing what is in
[42:27] their heart is it negative they were
[42:29] running at the shade look at it
[42:31] they want the confusion they wanting to
[42:33] fall apart
[42:35] like people looking for the press to
[42:36] come down they want the person to come
[42:38] up with no power
[42:39] all kind of crazy crankpot crackpots it
[42:42] doesn't even make sense
[42:44] the bible said as much as is possible
[42:48] live peacefully with all men
[42:51] you are looking for fight
[42:53] you are looking to cause no confusion
[42:54] and erection and the government come
[42:56] down and tend to fight us and close us
[42:58] down we'll fight back and i'm quoting
[43:00] daniel's scripture we shall not bow down
[43:03] and go and
[43:05] it's not sorry for us these are fairies
[43:06] for this
[43:07] they're not even gonna lie
[43:09] doesn't look very
[43:11] you know fiery furnace
[43:13] big okay
[43:15] people trying to make the one fire yes
[43:16] we try to make their own furnace
[43:19] but i am saying to you if we
[43:22] as a people here tonight
[43:24] would appreciate and value
[43:27] the word of god
[43:29] the voice of god
[43:31] then we could cherish it we could say i
[43:33] am resting on it because man shall not
[43:36] live by bread alone but by every word
[43:38] that proceed on the mount of god
[43:41] that is why you hear me emphasize the
[43:43] spirit
[43:44] prophet
[43:45] and the bride
[43:46] will say the same thing i ain't know
[43:48] what facebook i know about social media
[43:51] i know about that
[43:52] and what they say will already be said
[43:56] in the word so my strength is not for
[43:58] information on facebook or social media
[44:01] or what the government doing in america
[44:02] or europe or wherever else my strength
[44:05] and confidence is
[44:06] industry it's in what come out the
[44:08] amount of god's profit
[44:10] so don't lust for knowledge
[44:14] don't lust for information
[44:16] desire
[44:18] revelation is not the same
[44:20] don't it's too much knowledge out there
[44:23] and sometimes it's it could it could
[44:25] cook your mind doesn't people go on
[44:26] cuckoo you know
[44:28] it's a lot of knowledge just hitting
[44:29] people back and forth
[44:31] a lot of knowledge and and because of
[44:34] social media and whatsapp and sharing
[44:35] and the person and what something like
[44:37] that information just flies overnight
[44:39] some people like to know uh
[44:41] the things i've viewed a million times
[44:43] two million times 10 million times and
[44:44] they've gone viral they've gone very
[44:46] well what gone viral
[44:47] a lag on that something negative going
[44:50] viral it's not god word going viral why
[44:52] god will come over here
[44:54] think about it now how come we are not
[44:56] here industrial on fire all over the
[44:57] world people speaking dust in the lord
[44:59] look a prophet said this the word said
[45:01] this the bible said no
[45:02] but all the things out there going viral
[45:05] friends forget viral
[45:07] study what god has said
[45:09] study that we are dealing with the god
[45:11] of this evil age is a god of destruction
[45:14] and commitment brings
[45:17] focus let me say it again
[45:20] commitment
[45:22] brings focus
[45:24] i
[45:25] believe in being committed
[45:27] commissioned in marriage committed to be
[45:29] finally committed to the lord committed
[45:32] to god's people all this is part of
[45:34] commitment now
[45:35] because you got committed on your
[45:37] mountain by yourself imagine to what
[45:39] by this shall all men know that you are
[45:42] my disciples you see that's the word now
[45:46] uh beloved
[45:47] let us love one another for love is of
[45:49] god and anyone who loves born of god and
[45:51] with god
[45:52] okay this is a new commandment i give
[45:54] unto you that you love one another but
[45:56] that's the word right
[45:58] now when you by yourself you should win
[46:00] and you wear body with no body and you
[46:02] hitting no body and whatnot
[46:04] that's not what the bible is saying
[46:07] this love carry loving yourself you're
[46:09] not self-loves
[46:10] this is love that has to go to the
[46:13] brethren
[46:14] so this is a commitment
[46:16] of the word to go to depression to love
[46:19] and to care
[46:20] and to be concerned and to be burdened
[46:22] and to treat them right
[46:24] because if you cannot treat your own
[46:25] brothers and sisters right how could you
[46:27] treat god right
[46:30] when the brothers and sisters who you
[46:31] see
[46:32] amen so i trust that this will help
[46:34] somebody tonight i
[46:36] i trust it will help you tonight
[46:37] jeremiah
[46:40] 42 verse 4.
[46:44] okay no sorry you want to look at
[46:46] chronicles
[46:47] uh second chronicles 16
[46:50] verse nine for the eyes of the lord
[46:52] running to and fro
[46:54] throughout the whole earth
[46:58] second chronicles 16 verse nine
[47:02] the eyes of the lord run two and four
[47:04] throw the whole earth
[47:06] to show himself strong
[47:08] in the behalf of them
[47:11] whose heart is perfect towards him
[47:15] hearing though has done foolishly
[47:18] therefore from henceforth though shall
[47:20] have war
[47:22] so god has looked over his people
[47:24] god doesn't look
[47:27] in the heart of his people
[47:29] that have a heart towards him with a
[47:31] heart wasn't protected covering them
[47:34] all right
[47:36] let us look at first kings chapter two
[47:38] wanna read verse one before first king
[47:39] chapter two
[47:41] verse one the four first king chapter
[47:43] two
[47:44] was wonderful
[47:46] now the days of david junior that he
[47:48] shall die
[47:51] and he charged
[47:53] solomon his son saying
[47:56] i go the way of all the earth
[48:00] be those strong therefore
[48:03] and shoot myself a man
[48:07] and keep
[48:08] the charge of the lord thy god
[48:12] to walk in his ways
[48:14] now you see why i'm reading this here
[48:16] you have to take this as if god telling
[48:18] you this like you are solomon
[48:22] and to keep the charge of the lord thy
[48:24] god to walk in his ways
[48:26] to keep his statutes
[48:28] and his commandments
[48:29] and his judgments
[48:31] and his testimonies as it is written in
[48:34] the law of moses
[48:36] what for
[48:38] what for that dharmius prosper in all
[48:42] that thou doest
[48:44] and witness whoever doubting us
[48:46] thyself that the lord may continue his
[48:50] word
[48:51] which he speak considering me
[48:53] saying
[48:54] if
[48:55] thy children not a guarantee it's not
[48:57] like it's better
[48:59] if thy children take heed to their way
[49:03] to walk before me in truth
[49:05] with all their heart with all their soul
[49:08] they shall not feel thee a man on the
[49:10] throne of israel
[49:12] or give the lord a hand of praise
[49:14] tonight oh blessed be the name of the
[49:16] lord
[49:17] hallelujah that is your commitment to
[49:20] god
[49:21] so let's kind of dig a bit
[49:24] uh
[49:25] about commitment to god's people
[49:27] and we want to go to acts chapter 2
[49:30] verse 42 familiar scripture
[49:33] then we go to romans 12.
[49:36] so acts chapter 2
[49:37] verse 42
[49:39] and look
[49:40] what god requires us and what has
[49:42] happened in the old testament in the
[49:44] alpha church
[49:45] and see how we compare with it
[49:48] now
[49:49] acts chapter 2 42 and they continued
[49:51] steadfastly
[49:53] in the apostles doctrine
[49:56] one
[49:57] and fellowship
[49:59] to
[50:00] and in breaking of bread
[50:03] tree
[50:04] and praise
[50:09] it is
[50:10] it is defined in the scripture
[50:12] it continued steadfastly
[50:15] in the apostles doctrine
[50:17] they had doctrine one they had
[50:20] fellowship two they had breaking of
[50:23] bread and they had praying
[50:27] this is what we have to see
[50:30] not people
[50:31] doctrine alone no fellowship
[50:33] you see they had doctrine they had
[50:36] fellowship they had breaking bread they
[50:38] had prayer romans 12 universe 4
[50:43] and this is called unto the church now
[50:46] for us we have many members in one body
[50:48] talk about our physical body
[50:51] and all members
[50:52] have not the same office
[50:55] so we
[50:56] being many
[50:58] are one body in christ
[51:00] so know
[51:02] this scripture
[51:05] take you away from seeing just
[51:06] individuals and i see and he and no no
[51:09] no
[51:10] he's nobody body of christ now four
[51:12] first five so we being many are one body
[51:14] in christ and everyone remembers one of
[51:18] another
[51:19] having them gifts
[51:21] different
[51:23] according to the grace that is given to
[51:25] us with a prophecy that is prophesying
[51:28] according to the proportion of faith or
[51:30] ministry let us wait on our ministering
[51:32] or either teach it on teaching either
[51:35] exhort it on exhortation either give it
[51:38] let them do it with simplicity either
[51:40] rule it with diligence he that show it
[51:44] mercy with cheerfulness
[51:46] let love be without dissimilation
[51:48] abhor that which is evil
[51:50] please that that which is good
[51:53] be kindly
[51:55] affection
[51:57] one to another with brotherly love
[52:00] in honor
[52:02] referring one another you know some
[52:04] people they
[52:07] they like to be complimented but they do
[52:09] with compliments
[52:11] they like to be appreciated but they
[52:13] don't show appreciation to others
[52:16] they are all about themselves what comes
[52:18] to them what they want what they want to
[52:20] have
[52:21] what they want to get but not what they
[52:24] want to give
[52:25] let's look at first corinthians this is
[52:27] new testament now verse 12.
[52:29] exciting about this scripture
[52:31] first corinthians chapter 12 i trust
[52:33] them that
[52:34] are you excited tonight about this word
[52:37] about being committed
[52:39] to god's people
[52:41] first corinthians 12
[52:43] verse 12 for as the body is one and have
[52:46] many members
[52:47] and all members of that one body being
[52:50] many are one body
[52:51] so also is christ
[52:53] for by one spirit
[52:55] are we all baptized into one body
[52:57] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[52:59] we bond or free and have been all made a
[53:01] drink of that one spirit
[53:03] for the body is not
[53:06] one member
[53:08] but many
[53:09] and if the foot shall save because i am
[53:12] not the hand i am not of the body is it
[53:16] therefore not of the body
[53:18] if the ear shall see because i'm not the
[53:20] eye i am not of the body is it therefore
[53:23] not of the body if the whole body will
[53:25] an eye
[53:26] where would the hearing if the whole
[53:28] body were hearing where would they smell
[53:31] it
[53:31] now god
[53:33] had
[53:34] but god had set the members
[53:37] every one of them
[53:39] in the body as it has pleased him
[53:42] and if they were all one member where
[53:44] would the body
[53:45] but now are they many members yet but
[53:49] one body and the eye
[53:51] cannot see under the hand i have no need
[53:53] of thee
[53:54] no again the head to the feet i have no
[53:57] need of thee
[53:58] nay
[53:59] more
[54:00] those members of the body which seem to
[54:02] be more feeble are necessary there's a
[54:05] big one
[54:06] those members of the body which seem
[54:10] seem as wordier to be more feeble are
[54:12] necessary
[54:13] and those members of the body which we
[54:15] think to be less honorable upon these we
[54:19] bestow more abundant honor and our
[54:21] uncommonly parts have more abundant
[54:24] commonness for our commonly parts have
[54:26] no need but god had tempered the body
[54:30] together having given more abundant
[54:32] honor to the part which lacked
[54:35] that there should be no schism in the
[54:37] body but that the members should have
[54:40] the same care glory hallelujah one for
[54:42] another could we give the lord a hand
[54:44] the praise for this scripture here that
[54:46] the members will have the same care it's
[54:50] not you came for your family and that
[54:52] church down there did you land on me no
[54:53] no no no no no no no you not even in
[54:56] christianity that is not christianity
[54:58] because anybody could care for the
[54:59] family anybody could see by their own
[55:00] house in their own world and their own
[55:02] life and their own family and what
[55:04] anybody
[55:10] that there should be no schism in the
[55:12] body but that the members should have
[55:15] same care right where you are say same
[55:17] care
[55:18] same care one
[55:20] for another and here we go
[55:24] and when one member suffer
[55:27] all
[55:28] the members
[55:29] suffer with it
[55:31] when one member be honored all
[55:34] the members rejoice with it
[55:38] and if you can't rejoice with a member
[55:40] being honored you have problems
[55:43] with jealousy problems
[55:45] envy problems hard problems you have
[55:48] problems because this what i shared here
[55:50] is the word
[55:52] so see you have to know when you see
[55:54] somebody blessed glory hallelujah i
[55:56] should have got my brother thank you for
[55:58] my sister
[55:59] not oh god you raise your hand about
[56:00] thank god lord when i get in that
[56:02] you forget me
[56:05] so long await
[56:09] you can't go dear
[56:12] you have to respect the eye
[56:14] you lose and that is where you value
[56:16] people oh gosh you know
[56:18] you ever get
[56:19] your nail ever split your fingernail if
[56:22] i split
[56:23] that a little split you're not that hard
[56:25] just you know the edge of your nail
[56:27] there have a little small part here and
[56:30] listen
[56:31] that button like if somebody holding you
[56:33] up in like a gun you know
[56:34] it's rocking you a little
[56:37] something something sticking your finger
[56:38] and it's miserable but you're not
[56:41] looking for a knife to cut off your
[56:42] finger
[56:43] you want your finger to be right there
[56:45] you want this to change you want it to
[56:47] cure you want it to be healed
[56:50] there are too many people
[56:52] on the ceiling
[56:54] and part of the underserving undergiven
[56:56] under sharing under caring they're not
[56:59] they're just barely doing the minimum
[57:02] they won't volunteer
[57:03] they went off of themselves you ask them
[57:05] to do something they will do it you know
[57:06] yeah they will do it
[57:08] but the bottom said god is rewarded for
[57:10] the extra what you're not even
[57:12] asked to do he said what is your duty is
[57:15] not a reward because your duty
[57:18] he said when you go beyond your duty
[57:19] that is where the blessings are
[57:20] developed by the interests
[57:22] that is where they get the ice cream on
[57:23] the kick when you go beyond the duty it
[57:26] might be your duty and you know not if
[57:28] um i will scratch you back for you to
[57:29] scratch mines not that
[57:32] when you go beyond all of that and then
[57:34] you know the blessings is assured
[57:37] my lord can we call further here now so
[57:40] watch and the last one so when one
[57:42] member suffer all the members suffer
[57:44] with it verse 26 and when one number be
[57:46] honored all the members rejoice with it
[57:49] now ye are
[57:51] body of christ
[57:53] and members in particular
[57:56] and that is why it brings it easier now
[57:58] when you see somebody off track
[58:00] and you see somebody
[58:03] out of sync you could say but
[58:05] why that behavior
[58:08] quite that attitude
[58:10] and you provoke them
[58:12] okay until love and good works
[58:15] yeah some of them need to be provoked
[58:17] because their behavior is the fall back
[58:19] position of the human element
[58:23] the former position of the flesh
[58:26] they fall back position of the khana
[58:28] life remember we were born and said
[58:31] shape iniquity and we still in this body
[58:34] so so in other words once you break out
[58:36] of the spirit realm your default
[58:38] position could be back to the flesh but
[58:40] the canality back to natural
[58:44] but the bible forces us
[58:46] to adjust our thinking and have the
[58:49] attitude of god towards you by the word
[58:51] of god
[58:52] that's why he said love one another when
[58:54] jesus i went to do defeat washing and je
[58:57] and peter said no don't watch me don't
[58:59] watch me just say you're not part with
[59:00] me and my life jesus and i like what
[59:02] jesus told he has been very
[59:04] straightforward he had beaten around the
[59:06] bush
[59:07] if he said no no no
[59:09] he said you have no part of me he said
[59:10] then then he wonder about now he wants
[59:12] you want full worship
[59:14] jesus tell them i do this and i'm your
[59:16] lord and master i do this as an example
[59:20] not to show
[59:21] just to show you but i want you to do
[59:24] this to one another
[59:26] i want you to show humility
[59:29] i want you to show being a seasoned
[59:32] i wanted to show how you could humble to
[59:34] each other by washing one another's feet
[59:38] this feet washing have more powerful
[59:40] things to it and it might appear
[59:44] now when you
[59:46] it's like
[59:48] oh the defeat is one of the worst part
[59:50] center that is where they
[59:52] they kicking us at that that's the sun
[59:53] reservation
[59:54] or to dust and you market place
[59:56] something and you're going on to wash
[59:57] you know that was the lowest job on our
[59:59] feet watching flanking so jesus said oh
[1:00:01] there will be funky foreign
[1:00:05] treat each other with grace with
[1:00:06] humility because we are all called by
[1:00:09] god's grace
[1:00:11] my lord delivered daniel amen
[1:00:15] all right
[1:00:16] john
[1:00:17] 13 34 and 35 is the scripture remember
[1:00:20] are familiar with
[1:00:23] john 13 a new commandment is jesus is in
[1:00:25] red and you command i give unto you that
[1:00:28] you love one another as i have loved you
[1:00:30] that you love one another
[1:00:32] now remember i said in the beginning
[1:00:33] before i started the scriptures that
[1:00:35] it's not something you're born with
[1:00:37] commitment you're not born with that
[1:00:39] something you learn
[1:00:40] something you can acquire
[1:00:43] being dedicated to being committed
[1:00:46] um
[1:00:47] we as in ministry
[1:00:49] we have to be a certain way in our
[1:00:51] hearts in order to
[1:00:53] get the job done
[1:00:54] whether we feel sick or we don't feel
[1:00:56] sick
[1:00:57] um
[1:00:58] we strive
[1:01:00] to get it delivered
[1:01:02] because
[1:01:03] we see ourselves as
[1:01:05] as
[1:01:05] servants for your sake
[1:01:08] so if i go by my feelings then a lot of
[1:01:11] things might be done or accomplished but
[1:01:14] because we feel that this is something
[1:01:15] that would edify
[1:01:17] benefit strengthen and help you your
[1:01:20] commitment to marriage your commitment
[1:01:21] on the job you know some people on the
[1:01:23] job
[1:01:24] they they ratchet all they want is the
[1:01:27] paid
[1:01:28] the minimum they could do for that pay
[1:01:30] they do it
[1:01:32] nothing extra they don't stand out
[1:01:35] they are not highlighted
[1:01:37] the boys care principle wow this was
[1:01:40] excellent that person needed a razor
[1:01:42] peak
[1:01:43] nothing like that
[1:01:44] they are content to be mediocre they are
[1:01:46] content to do because
[1:01:49] they finally bought this and finally
[1:01:51] bosses and they remind me the scripture
[1:01:53] of the talents and the man gave 150 and
[1:01:56] 100 and he went away from five countries
[1:01:57] and he gave one one good thing you have
[1:01:59] these real men to know who to give one
[1:02:02] the one with a hundred produce a hundred
[1:02:04] you 150 make fifty more and he won't
[1:02:06] come and save her one he he bury it he's
[1:02:08] because no you're a hard man
[1:02:10] you know what i mean i know i know it's
[1:02:12] pressure but i know you're not easy so i
[1:02:14] bury it what you give me look it back he
[1:02:16] said you gotta put me back you guys i'm
[1:02:19] wicked seven and then jesus made a
[1:02:21] powerful statement that type the little
[1:02:23] that they have will be taken from them
[1:02:26] so when you see people in certain
[1:02:28] conditions and wonder how they dear you
[1:02:30] gotta watch that channel
[1:02:32] because sometimes is a level of
[1:02:35] lack of a commitment
[1:02:38] lack of ambition
[1:02:40] lack of passion
[1:02:41] lack of
[1:02:43] let me say lack of laziness
[1:02:46] sometimes it is lazy to pray lazy too
[1:02:50] fast easy to worship lazy they really
[1:02:53] want a priest
[1:02:55] so some of these people in love with the
[1:02:56] priesthood
[1:02:58] because the priesthood saves them from
[1:03:00] doing what they're supposed to do
[1:03:02] as long as that is my father up there or
[1:03:05] my bishop
[1:03:06] or the man of the man of god out of the
[1:03:08] hour
[1:03:09] and they were worshiping and the
[1:03:10] fellowship of the man and the off
[1:03:12] they're safe they could do whatever they
[1:03:13] want to do they don't want any money
[1:03:14] because
[1:03:16] god doesn't see it so not in this age
[1:03:18] remember the nicolaitan the true out and
[1:03:21] take the anointing off the people of the
[1:03:23] lady put it on a man and we fell
[1:03:25] the whole thing collapsed
[1:03:27] this christian church that start via
[1:03:29] pentecost collapsed because number six
[1:03:31] got a troll and when you see man sit
[1:03:33] down and throw you know they don't want
[1:03:34] to leave it
[1:03:35] you see them all over the world they
[1:03:37] want to leave you know they want four
[1:03:38] more years five more years ten more
[1:03:39] years they want to live there forever
[1:03:41] as man without character on controls
[1:03:44] so god put it now that his power would
[1:03:48] only be released to those people that
[1:03:50] have character and character thank you
[1:03:52] jesus is not a gift so god so god can't
[1:03:55] feed anybody
[1:03:57] to the back door all right come on come
[1:03:58] on come okay come quick yeah you know i
[1:03:59] like you i love you no no it doesn't
[1:04:01] work every son that committed god must
[1:04:03] be tested tried so when you see somebody
[1:04:05] come true in character in life in spirit
[1:04:09] and purpose note this that they have
[1:04:11] come true they have been thoroughly
[1:04:13] tested and approved
[1:04:15] oh glory to god so when god dropped down
[1:04:17] and said this is my beloved son if i'm
[1:04:20] pleased you know that man went through
[1:04:22] stuff
[1:04:23] that bring him to the place where he got
[1:04:26] god's approval
[1:04:27] so ultimately friends
[1:04:30] your commitment on your job your
[1:04:32] commitment in your home your commitment
[1:04:34] in the church your commitment to the
[1:04:36] word your commitment to god the word to
[1:04:38] prayer to god's people has nothing to do
[1:04:41] with anybody else let me see it again
[1:04:45] your commitment to god to word his
[1:04:47] people to pray to christ has nothing to
[1:04:50] do with anybody else not your wife but
[1:04:52] your father but your mother but your
[1:04:54] husband it is your commitment
[1:04:57] i remember when i got my certificate to
[1:04:59] marry mary i said i'm hungry i marry you
[1:05:01] because i love you and i accept you as
[1:05:03] you are
[1:05:05] i didn't even know how powerful those
[1:05:07] words were
[1:05:08] accept
[1:05:10] the commitment
[1:05:11] the word spoken
[1:05:12] i didn't know her
[1:05:14] we didn't 10 years courting or anything
[1:05:16] like that was just a few months we got
[1:05:18] engaged we got married samia
[1:05:20] but i was saying to her
[1:05:22] i love you
[1:05:24] i am committed to you
[1:05:25] i don't know you
[1:05:27] but i accept you as you are all your
[1:05:30] faults weakness fears whatever it is i
[1:05:32] accept it i accept responsibility for it
[1:05:36] and i could see god
[1:05:38] having his commitment
[1:05:40] to his people
[1:05:41] that's why you see if my people that's
[1:05:43] called by my name shall i will heal
[1:05:45] their land i would lower the pestilence
[1:05:48] i will do this i will do that
[1:05:50] we we can't get in trouble unless god
[1:05:52] allows it
[1:05:54] oh give the lord some praises because
[1:05:55] roman 8 is a guarantee roman is like a
[1:05:58] contract and we know all things work
[1:05:59] together for good to them that love god
[1:06:01] they don't really call you
[1:06:04] you can't break god over that

[1:07:52] at the funeral of sister christine and
[1:07:55] it was amazing and this is the family
[1:07:56] knew it also
[1:07:58] says a christian came
[1:07:59] give a heart to the lord god baptized
[1:08:01] and she graduated from just a believer
[1:08:04] normal coming out to somebody that
[1:08:06] encourages others in other words she
[1:08:08] went past herself
[1:08:10] she went past her condition she went
[1:08:12] past her diabetes she went past all her
[1:08:14] to encourage others
[1:08:16] and what i'm seeing in life is living
[1:08:18] for others forgive the lord a hand of
[1:08:20] praise i love it tonight this is a word
[1:08:23] what what what
[1:08:24] what eternal life is
[1:08:26] living
[1:08:27] for others
[1:08:28] do you live for others
[1:08:30] have you experienced going beyond your
[1:08:32] family circle
[1:08:34] or not just your family circle the
[1:08:36] present circle that you are in because
[1:08:38] you are limited
[1:08:40] by the sick that you are in
[1:08:42] if all you are hearing is on that same
[1:08:43] circle all along that's all you're gonna
[1:08:45] get
[1:08:46] that's all you're gonna hear
[1:08:48] you're limited by that
[1:08:50] but if you prepare to go beyond that and
[1:08:52] be a son and daughter disconnected from
[1:08:54] the affairs of men and the fears of the
[1:08:56] world and number six and humanistic
[1:08:57] realm god could bless you tremendously
[1:09:00] and take care of places all right let me
[1:09:02] see if it gets from here
[1:09:04] all right romans 12 10 it says here be i
[1:09:07] think i read this before be kindly
[1:09:09] affection one to another with bloody
[1:09:12] love in honor
[1:09:14] referring one another but in the
[1:09:16] amplified it says here love one another
[1:09:19] with broadly affection
[1:09:21] as members of one family
[1:09:25] given precedence
[1:09:28] and showing honor to one another
[1:09:30] oh man you want to honor your brother
[1:09:33] you want to honor your sister galatians
[1:09:35] 5 this is what you should find galatians
[1:09:37] 5 13-16
[1:09:40] right this is a this is important one
[1:09:44] relations five
[1:09:49] galatians 5 15 to 16.
[1:09:52] i want you to find this one
[1:09:54] for brethren
[1:09:56] we want to take it slow
[1:09:58] you have been called unto liberty
[1:10:01] one
[1:10:02] two
[1:10:04] only use not liberty
[1:10:06] for an occasion to the flesh
[1:10:09] but to love
[1:10:11] serve
[1:10:12] one another
[1:10:14] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:10:18] even in this
[1:10:20] thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:10:23] verse 15
[1:10:25] if he bite
[1:10:27] and devour one another
[1:10:29] take heed
[1:10:30] that he be not consumed one of another
[1:10:34] this i say then
[1:10:36] walk in the spirit
[1:10:38] and he shall not fulfill
[1:10:40] the lust of the flesh
[1:10:42] now let's take that in the amplified
[1:10:44] galatians five same same scripture let's
[1:10:46] read the number five
[1:10:48] for you brethren were indeed called to
[1:10:51] freedom
[1:10:52] only
[1:10:53] do not let your freedom be an incentive
[1:10:56] to your flesh and an opportunity or
[1:11:00] excuse for selfishness i just love oh
[1:11:03] this is pleased
[1:11:04] because in a regular one it says you
[1:11:06] have been called to liberty
[1:11:07] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[1:11:11] the flesh but by loves of one another
[1:11:14] but the amplified says for you brethren
[1:11:16] are indeed called to freedom
[1:11:19] only do not let your freedom be an
[1:11:20] incentive to your flesh and an
[1:11:23] opportunity or excuse for selfishness
[1:11:26] but through love
[1:11:27] you should serve one another who's 14
[1:11:29] amplified for the whole law concerning
[1:11:32] human relationships is complied
[1:11:35] with in the one precept
[1:11:38] you shall love your neighbor as you do
[1:11:40] yourself
[1:11:42] but if you bite and evolve one another
[1:11:44] in partition strife be careful
[1:11:47] that you and your whole fellowship are
[1:11:49] not consumed by one another
[1:11:51] but i say walk and live habitually in
[1:11:53] the holy spirit responsive to
[1:11:56] and controlled
[1:11:58] and guided by the spirit
[1:12:00] then you will certainly not gratify the
[1:12:02] cravings and desires of the flesh
[1:12:06] of human nature without god
[1:12:08] okay amen
[1:12:10] second thessalonians one
[1:12:17] verse
[1:12:18] three and four second thessalonians
[1:12:21] verse three and four
[1:12:24] i see this army right here next to me
[1:12:26] here speaking the bible and getting
[1:12:28] these scriptures that is such and such
[1:12:30] an exciting thing hallelujah trust i
[1:12:32] will even find your scriptures blessed
[1:12:34] be the name of the lord so second
[1:12:36] thessalonians 1 verse 3 and 4 says we
[1:12:39] are bound to thank god always for you
[1:12:41] rhetoric
[1:12:42] as this is meat
[1:12:44] because
[1:12:46] that your faith grew at exceedingly
[1:12:49] and the charity of every one of you all
[1:12:52] to watch each other abundant abundant
[1:12:55] so that we ourselves glory in you
[1:12:58] in the churches of god for your patience
[1:13:01] and faith
[1:13:02] in all your prosecutions and
[1:13:04] tribulations
[1:13:05] that you endure at the second telus
[1:13:07] thessalonians one three and four and
[1:13:10] this is at the amplified we ought and
[1:13:12] indeed are obligated as those in debt to
[1:13:15] give thanks always to god for you
[1:13:17] brethren and this is fitting because
[1:13:19] your fate is growing exceedingly
[1:13:21] and the love of every one of you each
[1:13:24] towards the other is
[1:13:27] increasing and upon
[1:13:30] and this is a accords for mentioning you
[1:13:33] with pride among the churches of god for
[1:13:36] your steadfastness
[1:13:38] your confliction endurance
[1:13:41] and
[1:13:42] patience
[1:13:43] and
[1:13:44] your firm feet in the midst of all the
[1:13:47] persecution and crushing the stresses
[1:13:50] and afflictions under which you order
[1:13:53] my
[1:13:55] first john 4 7 beloved let us love one
[1:13:57] another
[1:13:58] for love is of god and everyone that
[1:14:00] love it is born of god
[1:14:02] unknown god
[1:14:04] and i'm going to share something with
[1:14:05] you from the prophet
[1:14:07] he's saying we have a sacred trust you
[1:14:09] know what our trust is we have an
[1:14:10] inheritance
[1:14:11] i believe in children it's the sacred
[1:14:13] trust and that sacred trust and our
[1:14:15] sacred heritage is the word of god
[1:14:18] so this is the commitment to the word
[1:14:20] and here we say now that's the reason
[1:14:23] i am so dogmatic as i would call it on
[1:14:26] standing on the word no matter what
[1:14:29] anything else say
[1:14:30] if it is not with the word then i don't
[1:14:32] believe it see you want to believe it
[1:14:34] all right but to me it takes the word
[1:14:37] because
[1:14:38] heaven will pass away but my word shall
[1:14:40] never fear therefore it takes the word
[1:14:44] i live by the word
[1:14:46] okay so he said the deepness of it it's
[1:14:49] all privilege it's the sacred trust that
[1:14:51] god has put to his church and god give
[1:14:54] the word to his church and that sacred
[1:14:57] heritage is ours it's a gift from god
[1:14:59] not to compromise on this or cut this
[1:15:02] out or two days out add this in or suit
[1:15:04] our taste but to preach the full word
[1:15:08] the whole gospel we are dutiful as
[1:15:10] christians that take it and believe it
[1:15:13] now
[1:15:14] this sacred trust that god has put to
[1:15:17] his church god gave his word to his
[1:15:19] church and that sacred heritage is ours
[1:15:21] it's a gift from god not to just
[1:15:24] compromise this or that he said now
[1:15:25] watch when we know we are bypassing
[1:15:28] something that some great heritage that
[1:15:30] belongs to us when we bypass it because
[1:15:33] our church said they don't believe it
[1:15:35] for this day
[1:15:36] it isn't for our day if we bypass that
[1:15:39] then we spoil our heritage so nobody
[1:15:41] branham is separated what it should say
[1:15:43] and what he would say if the word say
[1:15:45] and the church is saying forget what it
[1:15:47] should say you gotta take the word see
[1:15:50] now he said god help me god help you as
[1:15:53] christians never to compromise
[1:15:56] one word of god's word for this sacred
[1:16:00] trust was handed to the church and it's
[1:16:02] a glorious thing to have this gospel the
[1:16:04] full gospel to preach it without
[1:16:06] compromising any way preach it just as
[1:16:09] this is written live it just as it is
[1:16:12] written that's a sacred trust and if we
[1:16:14] ever expect this word to come to pass if
[1:16:16] we ever expect god to keep his word
[1:16:18] you've got to stay with it just the way
[1:16:21] god wrote it and that's the reason if
[1:16:23] you stay with it the way god wrote it
[1:16:26] there will be all kind of things
[1:16:27] happening among you every word will be
[1:16:30] fulfilled
[1:16:31] a woman is entrusted with certain
[1:16:32] characters she must not disagree fire a
[1:16:34] woman is trusted to that there's not a
[1:16:36] creature in it like a woman there's no
[1:16:38] female dog there's no female of any kind
[1:16:40] entrusted with the character that a
[1:16:42] woman has yes a woman wasn't even the
[1:16:45] beginning of creation because god knew
[1:16:46] that she got four all other females
[1:16:48] could not commit adultery she's the only
[1:16:50] one that can commit adultery if she had
[1:16:52] been made at the original that would
[1:16:55] have been this complementary to god's
[1:16:56] great wisdom she was made a byproduct of
[1:16:59] a man and because she was cast over in
[1:17:02] that side she has also been given a
[1:17:05] secret charge from god for redemption
[1:17:07] she has got character she must not
[1:17:09] define
[1:17:10] a body is given to her a sacred trust
[1:17:12] from god no female dog no bird no other
[1:17:14] animal not a creature like that she is
[1:17:17] the only one and the reason it is so
[1:17:19] sacred she is to bring forth life into
[1:17:21] the earth a body is a bedding rung of
[1:17:24] life therefore that's the reason she's
[1:17:27] given that sacred trust now we find that
[1:17:29] our body is the bedding ground all right
[1:17:32] and i'm speaking now bringing this
[1:17:34] illustration to show you where the
[1:17:35] church stands i'm not speaking of you
[1:17:37] woman whatever you are that's between
[1:17:39] you and god and you men i'm speaking of
[1:17:40] the church and christ now this she has
[1:17:43] been given to bring forth life and only
[1:17:45] god himself can give her husband might
[1:17:47] be the gym bearer but god has to produce
[1:17:50] the life that's right now she has a
[1:17:52] sacred trust of virtue that's been given
[1:17:54] to her trusted to her by the lord god
[1:17:57] gave her the virtue just as it was in
[1:17:59] the garden of eden she can say yes or no
[1:18:01] she has a sacred trust of womanhood
[1:18:03] committed to her that she must not be
[1:18:05] the womanhood i'm speaking out here is
[1:18:06] her conduct a character around men
[1:18:09] notice
[1:18:10] that's committed to her secret virtue
[1:18:12] secret womanhood sacred motherhood on
[1:18:15] her husband now we find out she has been
[1:18:18] given
[1:18:19] this sacred trust that she must not
[1:18:21] break of womanhood and act her character
[1:18:24] raise their children the honorable
[1:18:26] husband and here what
[1:18:28] what a sacred trust
[1:18:30] what a responsibility to a woman you see
[1:18:33] why she's a type of the church
[1:18:35] he says she has a sacred which has the
[1:18:38] same responsibility as a woman as a
[1:18:40] sacred responsibility a motherhood to
[1:18:42] her virtues and her husband the church
[1:18:45] has here we go a sacred responsibility
[1:18:47] to prayer
[1:18:49] and the word and to the word and the
[1:18:51] christ
[1:18:52] just as the same as the woman
[1:18:54] so saints church you have that
[1:18:57] responsibility to pray
[1:18:59] unto the word
[1:19:00] and the christ you have to make that
[1:19:02] come that commitment
[1:19:04] that commitment you have to want to
[1:19:06] improve as a father as a husband
[1:19:09] as a wife
[1:19:10] as a mother you have to want to improve
[1:19:13] as a worker this this is nobody could do
[1:19:15] it for you you have to want that and
[1:19:17] brahma talk about
[1:19:18] what there's shows that there's got to
[1:19:20] come a spirit that that's on john
[1:19:22] he introduced messiah
[1:19:24] what and how will the messiah the people
[1:19:27] that believe in him know it
[1:19:29] unless they are constantly in the word
[1:19:32] to know what he is daniel said the wise
[1:19:34] shall know but the foolish the unwise
[1:19:37] they wouldn't know they shall know their
[1:19:39] god but now he shall appear in the last
[1:19:42] days and to bring the people back to the
[1:19:44] word so that the bride will know her
[1:19:46] husband noah made the reveal word so
[1:19:50] your husband is not me your husband is
[1:19:52] the revealed word oh my
[1:19:55] blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:19:58] whatever i'm gonna
[1:19:59] wrap up here now let me out
[1:20:01] okay
[1:20:02] so but talk about offer
[1:20:05] offer she was a type of a lucom church
[1:20:07] that once started
[1:20:09] and she kissed a mother-in-law returned
[1:20:10] back and that's the type of lukewarm
[1:20:12] believer who will believe jesus to be
[1:20:15] christ and then turn around and go back
[1:20:17] to the thing to come out of
[1:20:19] my she returned back to our gods and
[1:20:21] many times we returned back to gods of
[1:20:23] our beginning because eyes of lust after
[1:20:26] the wrong thing we turn back to lusting
[1:20:28] again we got idols of drinking idols of
[1:20:30] smoking idols of lion hours of stealing
[1:20:32] idols and then professor and be baptized
[1:20:35] the lukewarm church and luke unbelievers
[1:20:37] each believer represents the church
[1:20:38] every watch power the lukewarm church
[1:20:41] here we go wow the lukewarm believer as
[1:20:44] each believer represents the church
[1:20:48] every american represents america
[1:20:51] every german represent germany and every
[1:20:54] christian represent christ
[1:20:55] and here she turned her back
[1:20:57] go back to the same thing and she come
[1:20:59] out of how that men even preachers
[1:21:01] sometimes will take the way of the lord
[1:21:03] and when you speak to them about the
[1:21:04] baptism the holy spirit is in nonsense
[1:21:06] that's offer
[1:21:07] tell them what the name of jesus christ
[1:21:09] and so on like that all right let's
[1:21:10] finish off here
[1:21:12] well how i like likely to root she had
[1:21:14] to make a decision
[1:21:16] i had to make a decision you have got to
[1:21:18] make a decision you will never walk on
[1:21:21] these doors this morning without some
[1:21:22] kind of decision you'll never leave this
[1:21:24] room today either being a you either
[1:21:26] leave this room today you're a better
[1:21:28] man or more or worse my woman to reject
[1:21:30] it you'll be worse it's harder the next
[1:21:32] time for you to get to it or you'll go
[1:21:35] all better
[1:21:36] it comes to our children in our lives
[1:21:38] it comes to a short on everybody's life
[1:21:41] and root had to make a decision
[1:21:43] so the bible said that a mother-in-law
[1:21:44] told her go back to your gods like your
[1:21:46] sister
[1:21:47] go back at the lukewarm why don't you go
[1:21:50] on
[1:21:51] the gospel preacher if you want to go go
[1:21:53] on a real truthful preacher that will
[1:21:55] put before the class of people you make
[1:21:56] your decision
[1:21:58] you stand on your feet lukewarm
[1:22:00] wishy-washy you don't know
[1:22:02] but a real servant of god be laid on
[1:22:04] your lap
[1:22:05] make your decision root said i will go
[1:22:07] where you go your people my people
[1:22:10] you're going to be my god where you live
[1:22:11] i live where you died will you very
[1:22:13] happy bury that is a real decision
[1:22:16] and i'm going to close with these
[1:22:18] scriptures from christ
[1:22:21] our commitment to him matthew 10 37
[1:22:24] he that love it father mother this is
[1:22:26] jesus speaking more than me is not
[1:22:28] worthy of me
[1:22:30] no this is the brass that he's not
[1:22:31] pastor t teaching he's not prophet or
[1:22:34] apostle this is jesus he that loved
[1:22:36] father mother more than me is not worthy
[1:22:38] of me
[1:22:39] he that loved his son or daughter more
[1:22:41] than me is that worthy of me i need to
[1:22:42] take it not his cross and follow it
[1:22:44] after me is not worthy of me
[1:22:47] so he is putting on you
[1:22:49] to follow after
[1:22:51] he's putting on us
[1:22:53] to be committed to him
[1:22:55] he's not saying i fallen after you and
[1:22:57] you have to follow me be worthy of me
[1:22:59] matthew 16 24 then said jesus unto his
[1:23:02] disciples if any man will come after me
[1:23:05] let him deny himself
[1:23:07] take up his cross
[1:23:09] and follow me
[1:23:10] luke 14 26 and 27
[1:23:13] if any man come to me and hate not his
[1:23:15] father mother wife and children and
[1:23:18] prison and sisters yea his own life
[1:23:20] force who
[1:23:21] cannot be my disciple and who is
[1:23:24] whosoever doubt not bears cross and come
[1:23:26] after me
[1:23:27] cannot be my disciples bear his cross
[1:23:30] and come after
[1:23:31] john 12.
[1:23:33] that loved his life
[1:23:35] he was 25 and 26 shall lose it that
[1:23:37] hated his life in this world shall keep
[1:23:39] it under life eternal
[1:23:41] if any man serve me let him follow me
[1:23:43] that way i am there shall also my
[1:23:45] servant be if any man serve me him will
[1:23:48] my father honor
[1:23:50] just what two more scriptures are really
[1:23:51] close what is the last scripture in john
[1:23:54] 66 63-68
[1:23:57] jesus speaking it is the spirit that
[1:23:59] quickness
[1:24:00] the flesh prophet said nothing
[1:24:02] the words
[1:24:04] that i speak unto you their spirit in
[1:24:06] their life
[1:24:07] jesus and discernment here but there are
[1:24:09] some of you that believe not
[1:24:12] jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:24:15] they were that believe not and who would
[1:24:17] betray him
[1:24:19] he said therefore i said unto you that
[1:24:21] no man can come unto me except it will
[1:24:23] give him unto him of my father
[1:24:26] from that time
[1:24:28] many of his disciples went back
[1:24:31] and walked no more with him
[1:24:33] then said jesus unto the twelve would
[1:24:35] you go also were we
[1:24:37] then simon peters answered him lord
[1:24:40] to whom shall we go thou alone
[1:24:42] as the words of eternal life
[1:24:45] final scriptures in john 8 31 says then
[1:24:48] said jesus to those jews who believe in
[1:24:50] him
[1:24:51] if you continue in my word then
[1:24:55] you are my disciples
[1:24:57] indeed
[1:24:58] so jesus said if you continue
[1:25:01] not start
[1:25:03] not stay stagnant
[1:25:05] but continue
[1:25:06] because the word is always unfolding
[1:25:10] remember the seed you have in your hand
[1:25:14] if your plant is in the ground start to
[1:25:16] grow
[1:25:16] when you start to grow you don't see a
[1:25:18] seed you see a stalk
[1:25:20] it grows through possesses until they
[1:25:22] come back to seed again
[1:25:24] but god planned the season the early
[1:25:26] church the alpha church
[1:25:28] that went through processes the
[1:25:29] processes is what we call the church
[1:25:31] ages
[1:25:33] and you and i are here tonight we
[1:25:35] represent back to seed
[1:25:37] back to the harvest
[1:25:39] back to the dream
[1:25:41] will you be committed tonight will you
[1:25:43] repent of your lack of commitment would
[1:25:45] you be pen tonight of the mediocrity
[1:25:48] would you repent the night of your
[1:25:50] half-heartedness or just barely be
[1:25:52] indeed because let's face it
[1:25:54] the foolish virgins
[1:25:56] they are the people that just get by
[1:26:01] they were lazy
[1:26:03] sanctified
[1:26:04] they believe
[1:26:06] they fall in christ in church
[1:26:08] but they're not burdened about the extra
[1:26:10] oil
[1:26:11] they were not committed
[1:26:14] to be stocked up for the journey with
[1:26:16] this oil
[1:26:17] with this word because it's worth in the
[1:26:19] spirit let us borrow his tonight
[1:26:22] thank you jesus
[1:26:24] heavenly father i thank you tonight
[1:26:26] and um
[1:26:28] for this one word commitment
[1:26:31] god uh
[1:26:32] you want us to be committed the first
[1:26:34] thing i said was
[1:26:36] we can't defeat a full-time devil being
[1:26:38] a part-time christian
[1:26:40] there's some way and you know there are
[1:26:42] people the testimony they work more than
[1:26:45] they deserve
[1:26:46] more than being paid for and eventually
[1:26:49] things turn around that they get paid
[1:26:50] for more than one
[1:26:52] it's amazing
[1:26:54] and those people skimping on the job
[1:26:56] they just remain at a certain level
[1:26:59] father help us lord because your word
[1:27:01] taught us
[1:27:02] that they who strive for the mastery
[1:27:04] will be temperature in all things
[1:27:06] and we strive
[1:27:08] after that price you don't run just to
[1:27:10] run we want to win
[1:27:12] we run after something father tonight
[1:27:15] you call us to be committed soldiers
[1:27:18] committed people
[1:27:19] lord when job had his stripping
[1:27:22] he said the lord give the lord take it
[1:27:24] away blessed be
[1:27:26] the name of the lord he was committed to
[1:27:27] worship he was committed to surrender
[1:27:30] by the time he finished with job he was

[1:27:57] of it we see
[1:27:58] the interest in it and i just love it
[1:28:00] father because what the prophet come to
[1:28:02] reveal was the scripture itself it's the
