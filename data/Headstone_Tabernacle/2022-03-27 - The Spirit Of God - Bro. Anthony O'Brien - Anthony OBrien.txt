please go on amen just good to see you and um amen special greetings to the pastor um amen and praise god and so it's a pastor brother isaac oven and just allow me the privilege to be up here this morning to minister the word of god to you amen amen praise god so without any further ado thank you so much musicians um we want to change this to all the service now and uh i have a couple of scriptures you would like to read um so let's turn over our bibles uh to saint john chapter and we'll read from 6 to 8 and then you could find later on romans 8 14. amen praise god praise god so saint john 3 this is a scripture with nicodemus christ witnessed the nicodemus nemas talking about being born again and so on is that right so just a couple of us is here to hone in on our text this morning say in john 3 we'll read from verse 6 and it says that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee he must be born again the wind bleweth where it listeth and thou hearst the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and wither it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen and amen now taking over to romans chapter 8. scripture but we want to just zero in on verse 14 to tie into this previous scripture here praising and then we'll see what the lord will do for us today romans 8 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god may god a blessing to reading of his word let's bow our hands now almighty god we thank you lord father for your presence that is here among your people lord father lord we know that it is you lord father lord it's your spirit it's your love it's your power drawing us closer to you father as we near the resurrection lord although we know that this evening time is fading out lord father we know that time is running out on the world on everything else but lord we come to redeem the time this morning in the house of god and we come to surrender our lives to you father and to see what you would speak to us take control of the service this morning father we yield ourselves lord father to your will lord looking to see how you would speak to us today lord hide us in in the cleft of the rock lord lord of may your word speak only this morning take complete control have your perfect way lord father and lord may we leave without burning in our hearts lord amen lord may we feel jesus truly in jesus name we pray and ask these things amen and amen praise god you may have your seats amen amen and amen praise the name of the lord so we're happy to be here this morning praise god and as we see the restrictions rolling back slowly amen we know that uh god is on the move amen praise god we're going to have a revival time amen glory to god it's good to see all of you one more time and i thank god for the grace of god upon our lives that we could see this day amen praise the name of the lord we we thank god for that amen life never been so precious to us in this but this moment amen please go on to see different ones around we you know we've lost our different scenes through the passage of time but uh god is good amen we'll see them again by the grace of god amen glory to god so we encourage our hearts this morning amen and comfort ourselves with these things amen so i have a title this morning uh and my title is the spirit of god amen and amen the spirit of god and i have a subject born of the spirit led by the spirit amen and amen now saint john 3 8 here we read talking about the wind blew it where it listeth i'll read it again just for context because i wanted to kind of i wanted to kind of walk around the text this morning and bring some things out here concerning it and i just felt like it would be a help to us today the wind blew with where it listeth and thou here is the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit and this to me was a very fascinating passage of text because here is where jesus is speaking to nicodemus concerning the spirit of god as we know and this comes jesus after jesus testifies to nicodemus that he must truly be born again amen and amen nicodemus with a natural understanding now he's trying to catch what jesus means or what he is saying by being born again and jesus replied saying that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit in other words i'm not talking about a flesh thing i'm talking about a spirit thing a spiritual transformation flesh is flesh amen that is what the world is of the world you have your money and you have your car and you have your house but i'm not talking about that i'm talking about a change amen last week we heard about changing amen isn't that right but isaac's message man how many appreciate that a changing world a change in people amen so this morning i want to kind of uh come behind there and talk about this change praise god just change from who you are to who god wants you to be amen god didn't come for you to just occupy a church pew pray and to stay as you are no no no no you can't come in the presence of god and stay exactly as you are something has to happen because it's god we're talking about when his presence dropped oh something have to happen something have to take place you cannot leave as you are hallelujah some change has got to take place and i pray this morning a change takes place inside of you this morning oh hallelujah and i'm confident that god can perform this change inside of you this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah i know he can do it i know he will do it oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh glory amen amen one time they came to jesus and they said jesus if you were wait what else here my brother would not have time isn't that right if you would have been here my brother would not have died that is a powerful saying because that means they understand that if jesus is here the dead cannot stay dead if jesus is here then the sick cannot stay sick if jesus is here then the blind cannot stay blind but he stayed away for about four days hallelujah hallelujah because he wanted oh he wanted to do the will of god and god wanted to prove that the dead cannot stay dead oh hallelujah no no no no no no oh hallelujah but i am the resurrection i am the life and when he said lazarus come forth the voice of god snatched lazarus soul from wherever it was and brought it back to the body oh hallelujah hallelujah and i don't care how you feel this morning i don't care how down you feel i don't care how low you feel the voice of god can reach down to the lowest valley oh he reaches to the highest mountain and he reaches to the lowest valley oh the blood that gives me strength from day to day it will never it will never somebody say never somebody say never never lose its power oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we're getting a lot of praise whoa amen hallelujah oh my so the wind bloweth word listen that means to say that you could if you interpret it back he's saying the spirit which is a win goes wherever it chooses to go amen listeth it means wherever he choose wherever he desire wherever you put it in and you can't you can't hold it back you can you can't control it you might in other words you can't put god in a box and say stay here you can't push god in some church and say stay here because no church could hold the holy ghost they could hold the honey but you can't hold the holy ghost the holy ghost is moving brother you got to move with the cloud if the holy ghost decides to move this morning pack up your tent pack up your stuff we go in get up get up and move praise god because the holy spirit is moving and i feel today that the wind is blowing again i feel today that the spirit is moving again i feel today that the ceiling time is on it's time to get sealed up with this holy spirit of promise with the holy ghost and fire burning in your soul burn out all the demons burn our lusts burn out the idols burn out the trash hallelujah glory to god and make a church ready for the rapture do you believe it this morning oh give him praise hallelujah [Applause] yeah man let me just drink some water here man i gotta keep up with you amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wonderful all right amen so the spirit of god is not something that can be controlled that's why i love this verse here of scripture brother brings it out so many times you see because people feel like they could lock down god kind of control god and tell god pour out between 11 05 and 11 10. then after 11 10 we have kicks and drinks downstairs so time is when we stop no no that's not how it works amen amen praise god the spirit of god moves you got to move with it you've got to ride the anointing praise god you got to ride it praise god hallelujah amen it comes from god right it didn't come from man so you can't tell the wind where to blow amen you could strike a match and get fire praise god you could pour water in a bottle praise god but you can't tell you win where to blow up to no science haven't figured out how to make the wind blow it just blows it blows where it wants to and that's how the spirit of god is it does what it wants to it moves where it wants to the rain falls on the just and the unjust you can't stop that that's just the grace of god but that's just his spirit that's just his anointing hallelujah [Applause] manifest in itself in whatever way it chooses to amen revelations in 1961 prophet said here now watch what i'm saying now closing i'll have to let the rest of it go but closing i want to say this i've kept you so long okay let me skip down here said watch now said watch and this wiccan and dalton's generation he said this generation will receive a sign he said now watch how it lines with the rest of the bible the sign of jonah jonah was in the belly of the whale three days three nights so must the son of man be in the belly of the earth three days and three nights and what will it be the sign of the resurrection see the sign of the resurrection will be done in a wicked and adulterous generation like this one now is that right and it was done in the book of acts now here's what he says here now jesus raised from the dead come into peter james and john and the apostles and they did this book of acts he said it wasn't the acts of the apostles but it was the acts of the holy ghost working in the apostles oh it's not you but it's christ living in you it's not your of your works lest any man should boast and have no boasters in here this morning no flesh shall glory in his presence oh there's come in a glorious time friends when the spirit of the living god is gonna take over take over the scene take over the star the layla of the land oh man has had his say for years and years and years but we're going to switch over to the ministry of the spirit and it's going to make that word real it's going to make that world alive it's going to take control it's going to begin his reign michael will drop her and begin to deliver every name that is on that book and once your name is on that book you are going to be delivered there's not enough devils in the universe that can stop you from being delivered that can stop you for hallelujah from receiving your holy ghost portion from out of the seventh seal [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen amen oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah because before it was word it was spirit elohim spirit that dwelt alone in himself that brought alone with his thoughts that was there for how long i don't know eons and eons but it couldn't stay like that because in order for god to have fellowship with his expression he had to express something he had to say something he had to speak something oh hallelujah thought became a word hallelujah isn't that right and that word spoke and said let there be and there you come forth oh hallelujah because he thought about you and when he thought about you he loved you when he thought about you he formed what you would look like what you would talk like he was up there in his thoughts but when he spoke it it materialized and once it's spoken it cannot go back to being a thought anymore because it's already done spoken oh hallelujah what are we saying this morning you are going to be the express thoughts that elohim had in the beginning and those express talks was a royal priesthood those expressed thoughts with the victorious people praise god of people without sin are people around idols are people who worship the living god day and night pray without ceasing oh hallelujah are perfect people on the edge hallelujah do you believe it this morning not perfect in yourself but perfect in christ amen in christ perfection his work of perfection amen wonderful so it's not a man today prophet said it's the holy ghost working through a man or man see that does the work amen it's not the man the man's just a vessel see just something you carry it in he carries it but the holy ghost is the oil that is in that vessel that's what the holy ghost is and that's what we come for this morning pray god will settle for nothing less hallelujah than the glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost and fire in your soul oh that puts you anew oh hallelujah gets rid of the old man oh behold i make all things new praise god many many man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen god is in control of it amen has nothing to do with man see man is out to the picture amen man can debate the word but he cannot debate the spirit of god he can't debate it one time brother brown told a man because you challenge the spirit of god you will fall at my feet praise god he wasn't challenging a man the man the maniac man who was standing there saying what he was saying was deceived because when he look he saw a man praise god what he didn't see was a god that was in that man hallelujah the spirit that was around that man he didn't see that oh hallelujah if he saw that he would talk different but he was deceived the spirit upon him was deceiving him oh hallelujah [Applause] he takes control wherever god is he takes control he told joshua take hallelujah be reverent take your shoes off your feet holla is that right told moses take your shoes off your feet be reverent you're on a holy ground you under my holy turf when you step on here you have reverence you have respect you have humility you make your practice godly fear but because what about to be spoken is to say the lord [Music] and that's what we have to come back to reverence godly fear the right approach oh i'll have your bells ringing holy holy holy anoint yourself for the oil you're going in the presence of god you're not going in the presence of a man you get killed go in the presence of god with a contrite heart and a broken spirit break yourself before you hallelu before you get into god's presence wreck your own human spirit hallelujah the bible says rend your cut and not your garment rend it tear it up praise god hallelujah let him come inside and speak to you oh hallelujah amen see the spirit of god exposes satan that's what it does it exposes satan and satan hates to be exposed isn't that right hallelujah spirit will call sin out is that the time we're coming back to friends where the spirit of god gonna drop down in this church i'm gonna call sin out villa caller what you did last night what you did last week i'd confess sin yes the spirit of god is waiting to drop down hallelujah and speak to his people oh he is a righteous judge oh and he will judge uprightly oh if you come in the right way oh how do you receive a blessing from the lord hello but if you come out of timing don't expect no blessing oh hallelujah better come the right way or don't come at all come the right way or don't come at all i'll say it again come the right way or don't come at all playing church is over playing games is over we didn't come to dress up we didn't come for our fellowship hello we cannot meet god we come for the glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost and fire hallelujah get desperate praise god time is running out russia is making his move you make your move for the altar [Music] isn't that right but i'll tell you one thing the decree went out hold back the four winds hold back the destruction watch until everyone be sealed into the kingdom of god until we seal the servants of god in their forehead and you are gonna be filled oh hallelujah before those terrible plagues strike god will seal the church in there [Applause] amen oh my all right let me move on time is going quickly so amen we're reading that scripture right the wind blowed where it listed the sound though here is the sound thereof does the part come true in other words it's a real element it's a real force you can hear the sound of the wind you can hear it there's a manifestation of it's coming the bible says they were shot in the upper room they were praying in his name and then all of a sudden they heard a sound of a rushing mighty wind it come in they heard the sound of it praise god and it began to blow and when it began to blow the cloven tongues of fire appeared upon them oh harley isn't that right and they were filled with the spirit that's what i want to happen to be i don't know about anybody else you got to speak for yourself you got to want to happen to you i've got to want it for me every blade of christ got to cry out for their reign in the field oh hallelujah praise god amen yes lord i didn't come all this way just to warm a bench no i come from my portion i come from my inheritance i come from my spirit i come from my outpouring that's what i come for this morning i'm tired of church i can't go in the rapture in this condition no no no god sent his only begotten son to redeem fallen man from out of his condition oh hallelujah oh man don't you know you're fallen you're lost without his presence lost without his spirit lost without his anointing you're coming to church but you're dry you need an experience your anointing hallelujah to break the yoke off of you to break the flutter to break the influence oh i have sinned off of your life that's what we come for this morning that's what god is about to do oh hallelujah praise god i pray you'll never be the same again never be the same again not after today not after today turning northward go up and possess what you know is your own hallelujah hallelujah spirit of god you pray you worship get in the spirit right now something is about to change something is about to break something about to happen to you [Applause] you really think we're gonna have church all the time you're gonna dress up brush your teeth come to church praise god and put on nice clothes you think this is it you think this is what jesus died for no brother he died for you to change he died for you to change not to stay as you are but change holly brother branham said you're not converted until the holy ghost coming to you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory that's a real confusion you was this and now you're that like i heard a preacher say one time is not how loud do you shout not how high you jump but how straight you could walk when you come back down yeah line up with that word when you're in church when you're in school when you're on the job you line up with that word when you're paying taxes when you're carrying garbage when you're buying milk you line up with that word doesn't matter where you are line up with that word amen your spirit soul in alignment with god agreement of god that's what god wants then your body come into our line now you're ready for the rapture moment change in the twinkling of an eye and you're out of here amen spirit body word amen all right okay let me move on wind blows see watch it shake the trees you can see the tree shaking i see wind blowing you know a man up up in there trying to shake the trees especially when they're all shaking at once that had to be army of men but i don't see no man in the fire that means something inside the fire here's a narrative when moses saw the flaming burning bush he said go to sea he wanted to go to sea because he no fire as burn bush but the bush is not consumed the bush is not being burned up then that means this is not a natural thing praise god what we see should put every soul into action what we see or to make a church that'll make a revival because we see in something that not natural it's not man doing this man doing that but it is called doing a work amongst the people getting you ready for a rapture [Music] it's not right okay spirit of god makes you worship see that's not the work of a man it's a work of the wind the holy spirit when you feel the spirit of god like we feel the spirit of god this morning moving upon us that's what makes you stand up on your feet that's what makes you agree with this or it's something inside your soul it's registering it's bearing witness with what you hear coming forth hallelujah because not the thought of man it's a word of god and your spirit agrees with that but more than that he wants to take out your stony heart give you a heart of flesh hallelujah i want to take out your spirit give you a new spirit and then you want to put his spirits in there that is the holy ghost that is zoe eternal life hallelujah in your body in your heart of flesh in your new heart in your new spirit in his spirit hallelujah hallelujah that only recognizes the word when it is presented his spirit praise god in you is what speaks back dawah the christ the son of the living god amen peter spoke it by revelation but he still had to go in the upper room because he had his struggles he had his challenges he cut our mind off he was hot tempered and he needed to get tempered down he needed to get his spirits oh hallelujah he denied christ hallelujah is not right he needed to get his spirit praise god in order to truly please god oh isn't that right amen that's what we're looking for this morning amen when the spirit of god begins to manifest itself in the true church of the living god that'll be the work of the holy spirit in the church amen let's move on to this verse here it says but you can't not tell from when to comment or whether it goes that's because god is mysterious amen he works in a mysterious way isn't that right ecclesiastes 11. says as don know west not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow this is ecclesiastes 11 5. i don't know it's not what does the way of the spirit or how the spirits do group how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all oh hallelujah whatever he wants to do he will too brother pray he is sovereign hallelujah who told philip to go down to the ethiopian eunuch that was called god translated philip and drop him off there and say talk to that one he read any bible but he don't understand the spirit of god knows what our ethiopian unique have need of because he drawing from the word but he need a supernatural element he needs to understand what's taking place and it take the spirit to interpret so god drop off one of his emissaries named philip to go and talk to that ethiopian eunuch to give him an understanding of what he is reading and begin to connect the dots and when he connected the touch they stop off the trip they stop off the journey to make a little baptism hallelujah ceremony and philip baptizing there the utopian eunuch and he received the spirit and the bible says quickly when the work was over god translated philip and he ended up somewhere else in antioch hallelujah praise god the spirit of god is on the move oh have this one baptize this one teach this one reproof this one correct this one instruct this one it is called on the move this morning oh hallelujah prophet said we'll be worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among us oh isn't that right so that means you're going to come into such a condition where you will please the spirit of god for him to move in any time move in freely and begin to anoint and minister and move things why because you're letting yourself subject to the moving of the spirit oh hallelujah and the prophet said on god called man he said that's the kind of man we need today god trained man man who trained not in the school of theology but trained to know the spirit trained to know his presence trained to know how it works train to wait on god train to wait for god until he comes the prophet said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on him i can't do it without him and he's coming for the ministry that knows how to wait on him they can't do nothing in themselves but god is going to trust himself in his commanding officers and become apostles or prophet teachers to the people oh ministering an entrance into the kingdom to you abundantly to the everlasting riches of his grace amen that's what god's doing that's what he wants to do anyway he did it once before in the apostolic age and he's gonna do it again in this omega bride in this last day amen praise god it's gonna happen because that's the kind of church jesus christ is coming for in the last days he's not coming for a dead church he's not coming for people who can't worship people who don't know how to lift their hands people don't know how to pray no no no no so you better begin to exercise yourself in the spirit this morning start now the best time to plant the tree was 20 years ago the next best time is now so start now raise your hands now lift your hands now graven worship now praise god now now faith is [Music] launch out in a faith launch out into the jeep and believe god this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you believe that all right okay so that is uh can't tell from when to come away and go and see mysterious but that's his spirit and we move with it because we trust his program we trust what he's about to do we lend ourselves fully over to the holy spirit isn't that right isn't that right and joshua joshua in the book of joshua over there represented the holy spirit isn't that right and the god told joshua this day will i magnify thy ministry and the sight of all israel do people know that as i was with moses so shall i be with you hallelujah isn't that right so that means joshua the holy spirit is gonna take you over into your promised land and divide an inheritance for you because when jesus died he left you an inheritance when he died he left you a will and testament he left something for you oh and i come this morning to find out what is my portion in his will what is my portion in his inheritance hallelujah there's a portion of the holy ghost for you there's a portion of healing for you there's a portion of deliverance for you there's a portion of restoration for you oh somebody's saying man [Applause] huh so we come to find out what is that god has for us and when we see it we could possess it because we know it's our own by revelation isn't that right so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen is not right you must be born again it's a birth from above amen amen so let's nail this down praise god prophet said in redemption and completeness enjoy 1954. he said well uh paragraph 128 said well on the day of pentecost when all manner began to fall the holy ghost came like a rushing mighty wind here was a bunch of little dignified people 120 in a upper room doors were shut windows shut down amen isn't that right sitting back there waiting for the promise yeah they had been with jesus sure they know his power and all that they've seen it didn't all right but they were waiting for the promise and that's what we want tonight prophet said and that's what we want today hallelujah amen to be said if this group of people this right here and they say we here today could get in one accord like there was on that night he said the same thing would repeat tonight oh right here in this building louisville kentucky and i say right here in this building sanger granty trinidad called to pour out his spirit here if we could get it one man and one accord just like they did in the upper room oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah same thing repeat that's right amen they were that repeated on their pentecost oh of course they'd have been the same kind of critics there in louisville they had their see they were all one place one accord he said and suddenly and then he said there came a minister come up and he had a letter and they signed their names and had a right-handed fellowship and entered into the church fellowship he said no that might be today he said but that wasn't then that's the way the pentecost does it hallelujah come and put your name in a book isn't that right come and join church come and be a part of our group but that's not how god works he said the catholic walks up to the altar takes for his communion licks his tongue takes the wafer and the priest drinks the wine and and then he becomes that but he said oh brother but on the day of pentecost they were in one accord in one place and then suddenly there came a sound from heaven oh he said man had nothing to do with it it was like a rushing mighty wind that filled all the house where they were sitting and the power of god somebody say the power of god somebody say louder the power of god allah shook upon them prophet said oh out in the street they went how they're acting like a bunch of maniac like they did down there and come through the red sea isn't that right he said they screamed they carried on this is it this is the description this is what happens when the spirit falls upon you you lose all that humi all that pride and and praise god and you can't say this and you can't praise god and you're having trouble with this and you're having a fight with this no no no not when that spirit comes praise god hallelujah hallelujah this scream he said they carried on he said they staggered he said they stumbled with their lips oh hallelujah he said look they were full of new wine that's right the wine that come from god out of heaven he said did you ever see a drunk man he said he's just in love with everybody hey man he said you see here he said he don't care that's the way a man is when he get drunk on this spirit oh how the bible said be not drunk with strong drink with excess but be drunk on the spirit the spirit makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies and everything else a little everybody's in love with you and you love everybody that's when the spirit of god is upon you i want to get so drunk in the spirit that i forget what my name is i forget how i came did i travel did i drive i don't know i don't care i'm

finished and when god finished with your life when god finished more than you when god finished shaping you when god finished stripping you and beating you and boiling the trash out of your life he
