========================================

prophet had silently slipped away. &gt;&gt; Many names such as Abraham, Moses, Noah, David, Daniel, Elijah, Elisha had long been established as necessary actors in God's great drama. But this time was different. This name was not to be written on buildings, universities, schools of theology. The ministry of this great prophet Elijah of Malachi 4:5 and 6 was different. As God unfolded the story of his life through three polls, there was a great purpose for this prophet. This prophet was to deliver a seven seal, seven thunder message to prepare and elect Omega word bride for the rapture, for the wedding supper, and for the millennium. God has always had an order and God will never break his order. &gt;&gt; From the beginning of time, the word of the Lord has always come to the prophets. And Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets. I am not a prophet." So I'm not trying to attempt to be a prophet. But we thank God that there was a prophet in our day, a prophet in our time who almighty God spoke to and spoke through and used to point clarity to the word. &gt;&gt; Kings were made subject TO THE PROPHETS. THE HIGH PRIESTS AND ALL the Levites were made subject TO THE PROPHET. THOSE WHO WENT TO WAR were subject to the prophet. &gt;&gt; The word of the prophet would stand until the next prophet would come along. Is this age to be any different? According to my Bible, there is no other major prophet to come. &gt;&gt; There's no other messenger to come. &gt;&gt; The last messenger has already come and the last messenger has already gone. And as we established, he could not have left unless his mission and his purpose was accomplished. There will be no other ministry like his ministry for what he was called to do. But the ministry of Jesus Christ that operated in him is promised to operate through an end time bride, an end time people. And it will be not their might or their power, but it will be by the spirit of the Lord. When brother Brandham spoke, it was not a man speaking. When brother Brandham spoke, it was the son of man veiled in a son of man. No wonder brother Brandham would say in the message the Leodysian church age. Yes, listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age. What he says from God, the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word. This brings us back to the Bible because what they say will have already been said in the word. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm laying a foundation. Why? I'm against organized religion. But the Brandham said the Holy Spirit today, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to THE WORD. NOT BACK TO CHURCH, not back to denomination, NOT BACK TO GATHERING, but back to the word. Because the Holy Spirit will only vindicate the word. If I come this morning to present my dream, my idea, my thought, there is no confirmation or no vindication OF THAT. BUT IF I present the word to you, THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS TO vindicate the word because the Holy Spirit and the word is one. Can the CHURCH SAY AMEN? BACK to the word means
