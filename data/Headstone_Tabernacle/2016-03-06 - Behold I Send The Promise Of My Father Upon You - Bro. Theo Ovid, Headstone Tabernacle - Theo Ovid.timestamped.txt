[10:42] of praise this
[10:45] morning, oh heavenly father, we love
[10:47] you, oh God, we worship you. We give you
[10:51] praise this morning. You are the reason
[10:54] we are here today, Lord. Father, we
[10:57] thank you for your mercy. We thank you
[10:59] for your love. We thank you for your
[11:01] grace. You didn't have to do it, but you
[11:04] did. You didn't have to find us, but you
[11:06] did. Lord God, there's something in you
[11:09] that reached out to us and pulled us
[11:12] from the miry claim and pulled us from
[11:14] the world and pulled us from depression
[11:17] and pulled us from our past and pulled
[11:20] us from our mistakes. You pulled us from
[11:23] our failures. And we are here in the
[11:25] house this morning only because of your
[11:28] grace. Uh we are here in the house of
[11:31] God this morning only because of your
[11:34] love. Uh we are here in the house this
[11:36] morning only because of your mercy. We
[11:39] couldn't do it on our own. Uh we don't
[11:42] have the strength on our own. Uh but you
[11:44] are more than able this morning. May you
[11:47] take complete control of the service. Uh
[11:49] may the Holy Ghost pour out. Uh Lord as
[11:52] the minister ministers. Uh may the house
[11:54] shake under the power of the Holy Ghost.
[11:57] Uh may you break the chains of sickness.
[12:00] Uh may you break the chains of sin.
[12:03] Father, Lord God, let the fire fall in
[12:07] the name of Jesus Christ. We say this
[12:10] morning, where is the Lord God of
[12:12] Elijah? We are under expectation for the
[12:16] supernatural to take place. because your
[12:18] word declares when omnipotence speaks
[12:22] the miraculous must take
[12:25] place. Father, we commit this service
[12:27] into your hands. We commit the people
[12:29] into your hands. Uh we commit the pastor
[12:32] into your hands. Uh we commit the
[12:34] ministers into your hands. Uh the elders
[12:36] and the deacons into your hands. Uh the
[12:38] musicians into your hands. Uh we push
[12:41] back the darkness. Uh we push back all
[12:43] the evil. We take every spirit under our
[12:46] control for the honor and glory of the
[12:49] living and resurrected Lord Jesus
[12:51] Christ. And we say house of hell, give
[12:54] way to the name of
[12:56] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. We commit this
[12:59] service into your hands. And the church
[13:01] says, And the church says,
[13:05] "Amen. Many, many amen." Feels good in
[13:08] here this morning. Can we give the Lord
[13:10] a hand of praise? It's good to be back
[13:13] home.
[13:14] There's no place like
[13:16] home. Amen. Just before a few greetings,
[13:20] we do have a note of praise from Brother
[13:23] Antoine. He's celebrating 80 years old
[13:25] today. Just as strong as when he first
[13:29] started out. God bless you, Brother
[13:31] Antoine. A true soldier in the army of
[13:34] the Lord. And he put some of the young
[13:36] men to shame. 80 years old and he's
[13:39] still jumping. 80 years old and he's
[13:42] still shouting. 80 years old and God is
[13:44] going to fill him with the baptism of
[13:46] the Holy Ghost and fire. And listen,
[13:50] he's 80 years old and he's closer to the
[13:52] resurrection. He's closer to getting
[13:55] back young. He's closer to 21 years old
[13:58] than 80 years old. Can we give the Lord
[14:00] a
[14:01] shout? Hallelujah.
[14:04] Glory.
[14:06] Amen. Please help me softly. We do have
[14:09] three prayer requests this morning.
[14:12] [Music]
[14:15] for Sister Popwell experiencing severe
[14:17] pains in her right arm and
[14:20] shoulder. for sister Christine for chest
[14:23] pains and short breath and from brother
[14:27] Knights for sister Grace Knight
[14:28] suffering from uh diabetic condition and
[14:32] hypertension and if there's any unspoken
[14:34] requests you want to put by raise of
[14:37] hands as we approach the throne of grace
[14:39] this
[14:40] morning our heavenly father Lord there
[14:43] is power in the church of the living God
[14:46] Lord above every disease every sickness
[14:49] every affliction Lord Lord, Father, we
[14:52] come in faith as the Church of the
[14:53] Living God, Lord, with needy children
[14:56] this morning. Lord, you said healing is
[14:58] a children's bread. And we pray that
[15:00] right now, Lord, that you would touch
[15:02] Sister Popwell from the crown of her
[15:03] head to the soles of her feet, Lord. May
[15:06] that pain disappear right now, Lord, for
[15:09] Sister Christine with her chest pains
[15:11] and short breath. May the heal an angel
[15:14] touch her even now, Lord, from the crown
[15:16] of her head to the soles of her feet.
[15:18] and sister grace nights. Lord, let God
[15:21] this high blood pressure and this
[15:22] diabetes come under control and be
[15:25] completely healed. You are the same
[15:27] yesterday. You are the same today. You
[15:30] are the same forever. May these requests
[15:32] become notes of praise. Lord, we thank
[15:35] you in advance, Lord, because you are a
[15:37] healer. Lord, you are a restorer and you
[15:40] are a deliverer, Lord. May you touch all
[15:42] those whose hands were raised and may
[15:44] Lord, you heal each one in the precious
[15:46] name of Jesus Christ. And the church
[15:48] says, "Amen." And amen and amen. You may
[15:52] be seated for a few minutes just to
[15:54] bring greetings to you before brother
[15:56] comes to minister to us this morning.
[15:59] Well, it's certainly good to be in the
[16:00] house of the Lord. David said, "I was
[16:03] glad when they said unto me, let us go
[16:06] into the house of the Lord." We'd like
[16:08] to welcome Deian Cunningham Daniel to
[16:10] the Headstone Tabernacle. Where you at?
[16:12] Can you stand, please? Welcome to
[16:13] Headstone Tabernacle. It's good to have
[16:16] you here with us.
[16:18] Amen. So I certainly want to salute
[16:20] brother Steven Olivi and the elders and
[16:22] ministers for taking responsibility in
[16:25] our absence. We had a tremendous time
[16:28] and God blessed. I want to bring
[16:30] greetings to the church from brother
[16:33] Jeano and brother Coen Brener in Europe
[16:36] and the believers in France and Germany
[16:38] who were there for the convention. I
[16:40] also want to bring greetings from Congo
[16:41] from brother Ben Balome the host pastor
[16:44] brother Olu from Nigeria, brother John
[16:46] Jaconia from Uganda, brother Christoff
[16:48] from Rwanda, brother Bofala and brother
[16:51] Joshua from Kinshasa and about 100
[16:53] ministers and pastors throughout Congo.
[16:55] They sent their greetings to the
[16:56] headstone tabernacle
[16:59] Trinidad. And um we had a mighty victory
[17:03] and it was quite quite a journey because
[17:06] we went to France and we got into France
[17:09] maybe around 3:00 p.m. on Friday and the
[17:11] first service was around 6:00 p.m. So it
[17:13] was straight from the airport straight
[17:16] to the service and the Lord blessed I I
[17:18] opened up with a message one taken one
[17:20] left and brought it to the individual
[17:22] because we have a lot of people hiding
[17:24] in the groups and hiding in the church
[17:25] and they believe the church is their
[17:27] identification or the message is their
[17:30] identification when with a random
[17:31] tortoise the token is your
[17:33] identification only the Holy Ghost the
[17:35] blood is your identification and that's
[17:37] to the individual. So you can blame the
[17:40] group. You can't blame anybody else but
[17:42] it's to the individual. And then brother
[17:44] oid spoke on a time of lingering. And
[17:47] then I came again and spoke on let my
[17:49] people go. And then brother spoke on you
[17:51] shall receive power. And then we took a
[17:53] couple planes and went down into Africa
[17:56] where there were over 2,000 people under
[17:59] great expectation for the Holy Ghost to
[18:02] pour out. And the anointing was so thick
[18:04] when you walked in. the place was
[18:06] already charged and it was something
[18:08] else to see. When God's people get
[18:10] desperate and they're under expectation
[18:12] and they're looking for something to
[18:14] happen, God is obligated to meet the
[18:16] needs of the people who are desperate.
[18:19] God has a responsibility when you get
[18:21] desperate to meet you. So, every service
[18:23] was mindblowing. The worship, the
[18:26] singing, and it was really a tremendous
[18:28] blessing to see God move in a mighty
[18:30] mighty way. So we should have the
[18:32] services available on our YouTube
[18:34] channel during the course of this week
[18:36] and on the website. So look out for that
[18:38] as well. A couple announcements before
[18:41] brother O comes. All midweek services
[18:43] are on this week. So I'll be in Maraval
[18:46] on Tuesday, Lord willing. Brother O will
[18:48] be here at the church and I'll be down
[18:49] in Canupia this week. So make your make
[18:52] it a great effort to be in the midweek
[18:54] services this week. We're looking for
[18:56] God to do great things. On Palm Sunday,
[18:59] which is March 20th, two Sundays from
[19:01] now, we'll have a special deliverance
[19:03] service and prayer line. So, we want you
[19:05] to get under expectation for God to move
[19:08] in a mighty way. Uh for Palm Sunday, we
[19:10] have a special deliverance service and
[19:12] prayer line for the sick, for those who
[19:14] need deliverance, for those who are
[19:15] looking for a breakthrough. And of
[19:17] course for Easter, we have our Easter
[19:19] services on Good Friday at 5:00 p.m. and
[19:22] Easter Sunday at 800 a.m. So, are you
[19:26] happy to be in the presence of the Lord
[19:28] this morning? So, let's just stand to
[19:30] our feet as Brother Anthony comes back
[19:31] and sing a song as Brother comes to
[19:34] minister to us. Can we give the Lord a
[19:37] hand of
[19:41] praise? Amen. You love the Lord this
[19:44] morning. Praise God. Turn around and
[19:45] greet your brothers just one more time
[19:47] as we get ready to change the order of
[19:48] the service. Amen and amen. You are our
[19:54] father
[19:56] [Laughter]
[20:00] and we
[20:03] worship
[20:06] you. You

[25:31] home among you
[25:36] all. Guys, I give a mini testimony and
[25:38] there's no way we could describe what we
[25:41] experienced and what we felt. It was
[25:44] such a blessing to be in France and to
[25:46] feel the Holy Spirit on the word in
[25:49] brother Janu's church and the blessing
[25:50] it is to be among the people there in
[25:52] Europe. And I know that God going to do
[25:54] tremendous thing amongst them. There's a
[25:57] bride around the world. Amen. Regardless
[26:00] of what condition, what culture, what
[26:03] situation, wherever it is, the Bible
[26:05] says that out of pe different people's
[26:07] nation and tongues, he's going to get a
[26:10] people. Yes, sir. I want to also thank
[26:13] brother Uldren for standing in the gap
[26:15] for
[26:15] us. Praise the
[26:17] Lord and for bringing that message, the
[26:21] hidden manner of the seven seals. And
[26:24] Christ is the manner. And he is also the
[26:27] seals. Isn't that right? He is who was
[26:30] hidden the seals. So when revelation 10
[26:32] came down, Christ came down again.
[26:35] Hallelujah. And and he throwed out the
[26:37] hidden manner of seven thunders.
[26:39] Hallelujah. And see was hidden. John was
[26:41] about to rise. Don't write it. Hide it.
[26:43] Seal it. Oh hallelujah. And that manner
[26:46] is only for the bride. Oh praise God.
[26:49] Amen.
[26:51] Hallelujah. So we thank God for this
[26:54] seventh seal, seventh under revelation
[26:57] that must produce Jesus Christ. When you
[27:00] add up the equal sign, you must see
[27:02] Jesus. Hallelujah. Add, multiply,
[27:05] divide, subtract. But when you put the
[27:06] equal sign, you must see Jesus. Turn it
[27:09] left, turn it right, turn it upside
[27:11] down. But when you turn it, you have to
[27:12] see Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Because
[27:15] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[27:18] Mystery this, mystery that, mystery
[27:20] other. When you put it all together, you
[27:22] must see Jesus Christ. Oh, hallelujah. I
[27:25] love the mysteries. Oh, glory to God.
[27:27] Christ is the mystery. Oh, blessed be
[27:30] the name of the Lord. So, I'm looking
[27:32] forward for a great time in the Lord.
[27:35] But I want to uh well, welcome each and
[27:38] one one of you here. And um I want to
[27:42] just address something before we go into
[27:43] the word. Uh I got invitation for Pen
[27:47] Harris 2016 and I want to uh make my
[27:51] comments on that. Um I want to read a
[27:55] quote here. Baram says, "Now when Luther
[27:57] came out seeing the spirit of God lead
[28:00] him
[28:01] out instead of letting the people stay
[28:04] free, he organized the
[28:07] church an image likened unto the beast."
[28:11] So image of the beast is not like some
[28:14] big concrete something. Once the church
[28:18] go into organizational mode, it forms an
[28:21] image because God is a God of the
[28:24] audience. And what happened in the
[28:27] beginning? They take God from among the
[28:29] people and put it on men. Then
[28:31] eventually a man and then God was
[28:34] popified.
[28:35] Or the pope end up being head of
[28:38] everything. God get kicked out and you
[28:40] have spirit of man reigning and ruling.
[28:44] Now watch an image like the beast, a
[28:46] political power like unto it. Instead of
[28:49] letting the people walk, here we go. As
[28:52] God gives light, they organize under a
[28:56] discipline. Yes. And they have to stay
[28:59] to that discipline. Yes. Yes, like we
[29:01] said before, if
[29:04] legalism was the way for to the promised
[29:08] land and dynamics, we should have they
[29:10] are ready. Because Trin in particular
[29:13] has been very legal for the past 40 plus
[29:15] years was legalism all over. So it
[29:17] didn't take that. If beating people into
[29:20] the gospel was going to get people into
[29:22] the promised land, we should have been
[29:23] there already. But it didn't work. So
[29:26] you can't beat people into it. You can't
[29:28] force people into it. It's got to be
[29:30] something revealed, unfolded, and
[29:32] experienced into your life. You can't
[29:36] make everybody Baptist. You can't make
[29:37] everybody Methodist. You can't make
[29:38] everybody Pentecostal. But you can make
[29:40] sons and daughters of God.
[29:44] Because he said he came unto his own,
[29:46] his own receive him not. But as many as
[29:48] receive him, to them give he power to
[29:51] become the sons of God. So at the end of
[29:55] the equal sign, what we supposed to see
[29:57] is sons of God.
[29:59] Daughters of God of God.
[30:04] Hallelujah. That's that's that's what
[30:06] it's all about. Your sunship, your
[30:09] godship, your inheritance. That is what
[30:12] it's about. Can somebody say amen with
[30:14] me? Your sunship, your godship, your
[30:17] inheritance. We were lost and we
[30:19] couldn't redeem ourselves. We were lost,
[30:21] we couldn't pull ourselves. We were in
[30:23] the mud pit and we couldn't pull
[30:25] ourselves up. Somebody had to come with
[30:27] a big rope, with a big ladder, with a
[30:29] big blood cord and pull us right out of
[30:32] that. And that's what Jesus did.
[30:38] You may be seated. So now that Jesus
[30:40] pull you out, he ask what for?
[30:46] He didn't pull you out just to pull you
[30:47] out. He pulled out for a purpose. Now
[30:49] you get pulled out to understand, wait a
[30:51] minute, you have inheritance for me. You
[30:52] have blessings for me. You have power
[30:54] for me. You have a rapture for me. You
[30:56] have a wedding supper for me. You have a
[30:57] coat for me. You have a wedding dress
[30:59] for me. You want to marry me. You mean
[31:02] you in love with me. For God so loved
[31:04] the world, he this is all about this. Is
[31:06] this real?
[31:09] Yes, it's real.
[31:14] Hallelujah.
[31:15] Glory.
[31:17] Praise God. So God moved right out of
[31:19] the Methodist church. No, Methodist
[31:22] church was God's church. Luther was God.
[31:24] The Holy Spirit moved upon Luther, but
[31:26] after he died, they messed up. Methodist
[31:29] church, God moved from justification,
[31:31] pick up the dirty glass. And you say,
[31:32] "You can't just be saved and live
[31:35] filthy. You have to get cleaned up." So
[31:36] then you get the Methodist, the oneway,
[31:38] uh, holiness, all these other holiness
[31:41] churches and so on. That was a clean up
[31:43] time. Then after you get the clean
[31:45] glass, you have to put something in it.
[31:47] That's where the Pentecostal come. Holy
[31:49] Spirit pour out, speaking in tongues.
[31:51] But God moving on. You have to put the
[31:53] word on top of that there. So it has to
[31:55] be the word. We are not Pentecostal. We
[31:57] have to be word pride. You have to be
[31:59] word born. You have to be born of the
[32:02] word and of the spirit. That's what
[32:03] Jesus you must be born again. Your first
[32:06] birth can't make it. Your church birth
[32:08] cannot make it. It's got to be the word
[32:11] as spoken by Malachi 4.
[32:14] Glory. Hallelujah.
[32:16] Somebody say amen. So Adam was always to
[32:19] bring forth after his kind. Hallelujah.
[32:21] What kind of kind was Adam? Son of God
[32:23] kind. So Adam must bring forth another
[32:25] spoken word son. But we fell before he
[32:28] could produce that. So Jesus had to come
[32:30] up with the spoken word and say you have
[32:32] to be born of the word and of the spirit
[32:35] that makes you born again. Word is seed
[32:38] inside of you. Spirit is a quickening
[32:41] power.
[32:44] Are you getting me this morning? Word is
[32:46] seed inside of you. spirit is quickening
[32:49] power to make that seed come
[32:54] alive. Don't say you don't need a
[32:56] spirit. You need a spirit. You need your
[32:58] cell phone activated. It may be the
[33:00] latest phone, but when it's activated,
[33:01] you can't make any calls. But when it's
[33:04] activated, you could call to heaven. You
[33:07] could call on the line. Are you with me?
[33:11] Oh, praise God. Hallelujah.
[33:16] So therefore he said do you realize
[33:18] friends? He said okay. So God moved the
[33:21] Methodist church. Oh wow. Let's do this
[33:25] message of revival that swept the world
[33:26] holy spirit with them teaching
[33:28] sanification. And the first thing you
[33:30] know when they did that they organized a
[33:32] church made an image under the beast
[33:33] political organized power purpose to
[33:37] bind the people of God to a creed
[33:40] instead of being free to worship and
[33:42] walk into the light as light was thrown
[33:44] in their path. Did you realize Christian
[33:46] friends that the antichrist which is the
[33:47] mark of the beast the antichrist anyone
[33:49] knows that the antichrist is a mark of
[33:51] his power? The beast is a power. There's
[33:53] a power of the Catholic church. There's
[33:55] a power of a Methodist church. There's a
[33:56] power of the Baptist church. That's
[33:58] beast power.
[34:01] So hear what he's saying here. The power
[34:03] of the church is beast power. If you say
[34:06] this is what we believe only and this is
[34:08] our church and that that that's a power.
[34:10] So therefore you have to obey the power
[34:12] of the church. That's a system. But when
[34:14] you come to Holy Ghost and individual
[34:17] you have no beast power there. That's
[34:19] the power of God upon your life. That's
[34:22] why Jesus said I will not leave you
[34:23] comfortless but I'm going to come to
[34:25] you.
[34:28] You going to have your own power not
[34:31] some beast system or power over you.
[34:34] Okay. Now watch. Now watch. So watch.
[34:37] Now of course being a Baptist. Now
[34:38] remember the reason I just kind of stuck
[34:40] with the Baptist was the sovereignity of
[34:42] the local church which I think is
[34:44] apostolic. You see I didn't even attend
[34:47] the fellowships but I but the Baptist
[34:49] church is not a denomination. It not
[34:51] it's not supposed to be. Now it was not
[34:53] supposed to be denomination. It's a
[34:55] brotherhood. It's the sovereignity of
[34:57] the local church. And if God is ever
[35:00] going to get a message to his man is
[35:01] elder according to the Bible, the
[35:04] highest office in the church is the
[35:06] elder coming through the elder or it has
[35:09] to go through the state prespit and back
[35:10] to bishop. We believe this period. So if
[35:13] we are under a bishop or as bishop or
[35:16] some message pope or whatever, then we
[35:18] have to consult them in order to preach
[35:20] and teach. And if you don't say this,
[35:22] you have to say it according to what the
[35:24] higher up say. So God don't want that.
[35:26] He want a direct line. He don't want no
[35:29] Mary. He don't want no man. He don't
[35:31] want no nobody between you and him.
[35:34] Now God don't have grandchildren. God
[35:36] don't have a CEO, a lesser CEO, a small
[35:38] CEO. God have sons and daughters. God
[35:41] have offices, prophets, pastors,
[35:42] priests, kings and whatnot. But
[35:44] basically God have sons and daughters.
[35:47] And a son of God is just like God.
[35:49] Daughter of God just like God is a
[35:51] offspring of the almighty.
[35:54] So you don't have to sit down and feel
[35:55] inferior than anybody inside of here.
[35:57] That's foolishness. You don't have to
[35:59] feel less than
[36:01] any inside of this building. Don't let
[36:04] anybody make you feel less than you
[36:06] supposed to feel. You supposed to feel
[36:08] like what the Bible said. Now we the
[36:10] sons of God. It doesn't appear what we
[36:13] shall be. We know when we see him we
[36:15] shall be like him.
[36:20] Oh glory. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[36:24] The faster you take up the role of your
[36:26] sunship, the less foolishness you will
[36:28] do. Praise God. You got to know who you
[36:30] are. Walk like who you are. Talk like
[36:32] who you are. Live like who you are. What
[36:34] God said you are. What God made you.
[36:39] We were born in sin, shape, iniquity. We
[36:41] born defeated. We know that. We lie,
[36:44] steal, crooked, whatever. That's how we
[36:46] live as sinners. But he came to redeem
[36:48] us and bring us out of that to bring us
[36:50] into a higher level into a higher
[36:53] atmosphere heavenly places in Christ
[36:55] Jesus. That's what the power of God come
[36:57] to do to raise you up.
[37:03] [Applause]
[37:07] Let a man go where God leads him to go.
[37:12] Wherever that man want to go, let a man
[37:15] go where God leads him to go. I like
[37:17] that man. If people in a conference say,
[37:20] "Well, here's a nice church. This
[37:22] brother built up a nice church, but we
[37:23] have a pet." They will send him over to
[37:25] this church. They don't realize they're
[37:27] killing themselves. First, if that man
[37:29] goes in there, he can't fill that man's
[37:30] place. They only weaken the church. So,
[37:33] how the church is organized, have a man
[37:34] establish a group. Afterward, they
[37:36] remove him, bring somebody else, shove
[37:37] them around because they in charge. They
[37:40] are controlling. They they they
[37:42] replacing God.
[37:44] That's why God hates it. That's right.
[37:46] That's right. Because that operation
[37:48] replaces God. That's right. And anything
[37:51] not built on the word will fall. Amen.
[37:55] But it has to be back to the word.
[37:56] That's right. God is no respector of
[37:59] persons. Amen. He's not respecting
[38:01] country. Because somebody in America or
[38:04] Europe or wherever it is, God not
[38:05] looking at country and how status, how
[38:07] rich you are and whatnot. God take take
[38:09] an ignorant man like Peter can't read or
[38:12] write to set his church in order.
[38:13] Hallelujah. Say this great omnipotent
[38:16] God choose men who can read and write to
[38:18] set his church in order because God
[38:20] don't need human intelligence and the
[38:22] intellect and IQ of men to set things in
[38:25] order. All God want is a heart he could
[38:27] jump in and eyes he could look through
[38:31] and mouth he could speak through and
[38:33] ears he could hear through. That's what
[38:35] God want to put on your shoes.
[38:39] God want to put on your dress. Oh, give
[38:42] the Lord a shout in the house.
[38:47] [Applause]
[38:49] I believe in the supreme authority of
[38:51] the local assembly. Let each church be
[38:54] its own. Choose its pastors, its
[38:57] deacons, whatever it is. And in that
[39:01] way, the man in there has no bishop over
[39:05] him. Amen. The Holy Spirit wants to
[39:07] speak something to that church. They
[39:09] don't have to ask anybody about whether
[39:12] they could do this or do that. They have
[39:15] no fivefold to ask permission. Please,
[39:18] Mr. Fivefold. It doesn't have that.
[39:22] It's the individual in contact with the
[39:25] Holy Spirit. Show me by the Bible.
[39:28] What's greater in the Bible than a local
[39:30] elder to a local church? Sovereignity of
[39:34] the local church. Each church in itself
[39:36] now brotherhood that's wonderful all
[39:38] churches ought to be in brotherhood like
[39:40] that but the sovereignity of the local
[39:42] church this church talking about brand
[39:46] is built upon the sovereignity of the
[39:50] local church you all are the church you
[39:54] people are the one who control you the
[39:57] church yourself and the church the holy
[39:59] church of God is the sovereigntity of
[40:02] the holy spirit in that church.
[40:05] So respecting the sovereignty of the
[40:08] local church is respecting the Holy
[40:10] Spirit that operates in that church that
[40:14] would minister to meet the needs of the
[40:16] people in that church.
[40:19] Because the believers in India have
[40:20] certain needs. The believer in in Africa
[40:22] will have needs. Believe in Europe or
[40:24] France or wherever, they're going to
[40:25] have their needs. And the spirit know
[40:26] what the people have need of. And they
[40:28] could the spirit could take that man and
[40:30] effectively minister to meet the needs
[40:32] of those people because they are God's
[40:34] people. And God have his men everywhere
[40:37] to serve his people. God needs a man
[40:39] from Trinidad to rule the world or
[40:41] anybody else to rule anywhere else. God
[40:43] have men everywhere. Come on. He is
[40:45] omnipotent. He's all powerful. He is
[40:47] God. You mean God hands so short. He
[40:49] made the only English speaking
[40:51] preachers. No. It have French. It have
[40:53] Spanish. in all different languages that
[40:55] God have anointed servants of God to
[40:57] minister the word of God everywhere
[40:59] around the world. Could we give the Lord
[41:01] a shout in the house? Glory to God.
[41:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can't stop
[41:07] God. He's omnipotent. He's all powerful.
[41:09] He can solve your problem right now.
[41:12] When you reach home, it's already fixed
[41:13] up because he is God. Oh, hallelujah. He
[41:17] can for whatever condition you in. He
[41:19] can touch you. He can heal you. He can
[41:21] deliver you because he is God.
[41:26] [Applause]
[41:28] No, you cannot make a holy church.
[41:31] There's no such thing as a holy church
[41:33] or a holy organization. So that kill all
[41:36] headquarters that kill all special
[41:38] groups. That kill all you have to come
[41:40] here that the angel is here and here
[41:43] have it or whatever it is. And no, we're
[41:44] not saying that that kill all of that
[41:46] kind of gospel where you have to go to a
[41:48] certain place to get something. That is
[41:50] not it at all. He said now watch the
[41:52] Holy Spirit. There is no such thing as
[41:55] the holy a holy church or holy
[41:57] organization. The Holy Spirit can be
[41:59] preached in it but in there you find
[42:01] good, bad, renegades, indifferent and
[42:04] everything else. So when you say greet
[42:06] one another in Jesus name, you don't
[42:08] know if you're greeting good, bad,
[42:10] renegade or indifferent. You just
[42:11] greeting your brother and sister. You
[42:13] have no authority to say this is good,
[42:14] this is bad, this is renegade. But it
[42:16] have that. Hallelujah. We can't stop
[42:19] that. We just treat everybody right.
[42:21] Treat everybody respectful. Isn't that
[42:24] right? But in there you find all types.
[42:27] That's why you can't take one person and
[42:28] judge the whole church. You judge people
[42:31] on their own. Come on, say amen,
[42:33] somebody. Come on, give the Lord a
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:38] shout. If somebody backs the church
[42:40] back, come on, please.
[42:43] Hallelujah. Here we
[42:45] go. So, an organization cannot hold it.
[42:48] You cannot say we got it. None of the
[42:51] rest of them have it. You can't say
[42:53] that.
[42:55] Let me say again. You can't say that.
[42:58] Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. I want to
[42:59] everybody say amen to that.
[43:02] You can't say you have it. Nobody else
[43:04] has it. You can't say that. You're
[43:06] saying the wrong thing. Don't even imply
[43:08] it.
[43:11] Some people don't say it, you know, but
[43:13] they're implying it.
[43:17] Glory.
[43:18] The Holy Spirit, here we go, is poured
[43:21] out on individuals.
[43:23] [Applause]
[43:26] That mean your mother can't stop you
[43:27] from getting the Holy Ghost. Your
[43:29] brother can't stop you. Your father
[43:30] can't stop you. Nobody, your wife, your
[43:33] husband, nobody could stop you. You got
[43:35] to have an angry person next to you.
[43:37] They can't stop you. Because poor on
[43:39] individuals. When they vex, you are
[43:41] smiling. When they're angry, you are
[43:43] worshiping. The Holy Ghost is pouring
[43:45] those individual.
[43:47] You can have your individual revival
[43:49] this morning.
[43:53] [Applause]
[43:54] [Music]
[43:55] [Applause]
[43:56] This tabernacle they say where she comes
[43:59] to church. This tabernacle is not a Holy
[44:00] Ghost tabernacle. There is no such a
[44:03] thing. Individuals that come into this
[44:06] church is Holy Ghost tabernacles. They
[44:10] are the tabernacles that contain the
[44:13] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[44:15] So I want to say that to you to this to
[44:17] you now. Yes sir. That the connection to
[44:19] New York initially was blessed under
[44:23] God's permissive will
[44:28] not perfect will because it initially
[44:32] came out to be a blessing to the people
[44:34] and a blessing it has been but it broke
[44:38] the sovereignity of the local churches.
[44:40] Amen. Yes.
[44:43] Not intentionally. Amen. But that was
[44:45] the fruit of it. Yes.
[44:49] And it brought in what I call a
[44:51] headquarter system. Yes. And we only
[44:54] have one headquarters. Hallelujah. And
[44:56] that is the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[45:00] But said the Holy Ghost is the
[45:02] headquarters.
[45:04] Pastors find themselves being a co-pilot
[45:06] in their own churches.
[45:09] believers no longer respecting the local
[45:11] elder but looking to headquarters.
[45:14] It was never taught as headquarters but
[45:16] the fruit speaks for itself. Yes sir.
[45:21] Testimony. My testimony after preaching
[45:23] in New York 2012 2012 had to speak with
[45:26] two
[45:27] ministers and one of them when I tell
[45:30] him I said our church is a suffering
[45:31] church and he banged the desk and said
[45:33] we should not go back to sovereignity to
[45:35] break the unity.
[45:37] Now you know what I just read, right?
[45:38] That was the word. So I knew that
[45:40] statement was off the word. I'm saying
[45:43] that
[45:45] because there is no unity without
[45:47] sovereignity.
[45:49] Margaret Tacha one time said talking
[45:51] about Russia, she said the weak does
[45:53] tempt the strong.
[45:58] That is where pope does come and bishops
[46:00] is coming. You see a small church, you
[46:02] see a weak church and they're trying to
[46:04] come to take over. The weak does tempt
[46:09] the strong.
[46:13] So this is my testimony.
[46:16] And I knew that what was being said,
[46:20] they knew that the sovereignity was
[46:22] broken. Yes. So he said we should not go
[46:25] back there. But I know the word that is
[46:28] the word. Hallelujah. Because anything
[46:30] going to fall apart if it gone off the
[46:32] word.
[46:33] Sovereignity is the word. Hallelujah. So
[46:37] it came to where you could connect and
[46:39] if you don't connect well you come out
[46:41] out of it. Not official
[46:44] implied. That's how it is. But anyhow we
[46:46] got an invitation for services in Pen
[46:49] Harris June 30th to July 3rd. Come
[46:52] rejoice with us one more time in Pen
[46:54] Harris on our way to the resurrection
[46:55] rapture and wedding supper this July in
[46:57] the hot July sun. and the bride will
[46:59] once again stop off at Denaris in the
[47:00] season of final
[47:02] rippling and um I got a real blessing uh
[47:06] welcome to invited to to come and
[47:08] worship. Of course we having our own
[47:10] convention here international convention
[47:12] 8 9th 10th of July which is the
[47:14] following weekend. I wrote this letter
[47:16] and this is my official response to
[47:19] Penaris 2016. Christian greetings to
[47:21] you. Thank you for your response and you
[47:23] welcomed me to Penaris 2016. I've been
[47:26] going to Pen Harris since 1981. From
[47:29] 1981 to 2011, that's 30 years. For 30
[47:32] years of my life, I have been there
[47:34] every year giving support to this
[47:36] revelation and inspiration. Never once
[47:39] in those 30 years have there ever been a
[47:41] doctrinal issue with the word that
[47:44] brother Coleman preached. I never had to
[47:46] ask him a question and what he taught as
[47:49] his testimony was that of an echo of
[47:52] what the prophet brought. Amen. Amen.
[47:55] And I thank God God for that. I am happy
[47:58] that there is a Ben Harris 2016 edition.
[48:01] It is a golden opportunity at this time
[48:03] to return to the place of the debacle of
[48:06] 2010 to 2011 and see a healing after so
[48:09] many lives have been affected around the
[48:11] world and even after 4 years no one in
[48:13] leadership took up the responsibility to
[48:16] bring clarity and answers that the
[48:18] people rightly deserved. It has been
[48:21] business as usual for the ministers but
[48:24] for the sheep it was horrendous. As I
[48:27] told and the two ministers I absolutely
[48:30] I saw absolutely no burden for the
[48:33] people only the protection and standing
[48:36] of ministers. What an opportunity for
[48:39] reconciliation this Pen Harris 2016
[48:42] edition brings. If I can borrow some
[48:44] words from the book of Daniel. the
[48:46] opportunity to finish the
[48:48] transgression to make an end of sins and
[48:51] to make reconciliation for iniquity. I
[48:54] will be praying for the meetings that
[48:56] the right words will be spoken and the
[48:58] right thing be done that the people
[49:01] might be blessed in Christ. God bless
[49:03] you and keep you Christian love pastor
[49:06] headstone tabernacle. The response I got
[49:09] was thank you very much for email.
[49:11] Unfortunately, I don't agree with your
[49:12] views as expressed in your email. But
[49:14] thanks for your expression that the
[49:16] right word be spoken and the right thing
[49:18] be done so that the people of God may be
[49:20] blessed in Ben Harris 2016. My sincere
[49:23] prayer, may God bless your convention.
[49:25] And that's that's it. So I just wanted
[49:26] to share that with you. I don't have the
[49:29] gift to talk behind anybody's back.
[49:36] I I I don't have that gift. I have the
[49:39] gift to tell you directly to your face
[49:42] and tell you just like it is. So this is
[49:45] what God give me and this is what I have
[49:47] to use. I have to only use the measure
[49:49] that God give me. I like to have things
[49:52] open and direct. I'm not hiding behind
[49:54] username and password to say anything. I
[49:57] will say what I mean. I will mean what I
[49:59] say and I will stand and sign what I
[50:02] say. Oh hallelujah. I'm not wild. I'm
[50:06] not on the anointing. Sometime preachers
[50:07] preaching and they want to say things on
[50:08] the anointing but
[50:10] waiting. No, we don't have to do that.
[50:14] Sober and song.
[50:17] Right is right, wrong is wrong. The word
[50:20] is the word and the word is God. You
[50:23] come here for the word. We never try to
[50:26] give you anything but the word. You know
[50:28] made a statement. He said we never try
[50:30] to introduce a gimmick that we have all
[50:31] the answers. There are some things just
[50:33] above my pay grade. I can't I I don't
[50:36] have the answer for it because you see
[50:38] God doesn't allow that because if we
[50:40] have all the answers become like God I
[50:43] can't give all the answers to your
[50:44] situation sometime God working things
[50:46] out in in his own program and that's why
[50:49] now we have to be concerned that the
[50:51] blessing you are under is not permissive
[50:54] will
[50:55] you want your blessing to be in God's
[50:57] perfect will because you could be
[50:59] blessed
[51:02] you could be going like Jonah going
[51:04] forward You're going forward, but you're
[51:06] going to Tashes.
[51:08] When God say go Nineveh,
[51:12] you could be doing this and doing that
[51:13] and never never pause and say, "God,
[51:15] what is your will?" Watch this. And I'm
[51:19] going to close with this. We going to
[51:21] have a time. You have two services.
[51:22] You're not going anywhere. We in
[51:23] Trinidad
[51:24] this Sunday. This is a Sabbath.
[51:28] Keep the Sabbath holy. This is our
[51:30] Sabbath. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh,
[51:34] hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[51:36] Give the Lord some praises, people.
[51:38] We're going to get on into the word.
[51:41] But I want you to be free. Hallelujah.
[51:44] Free to worship. Free to shout. Oh,
[51:47] praise the name of the Lord. Friends, we
[51:49] can only come back, we can only get back
[51:52] to the power if we get back to the
[51:54] original word. And I use the word
[51:56] original word. It has to be original
[51:59] word. And maybe in the spirit by vision
[52:04] the prophet saw people going off the
[52:06] word and said the only way the church
[52:08] will get back to power is come back to
[52:10] the original word. You see the original
[52:12] word have the original seed in it life
[52:15] in it. God put power in your seed and
[52:18] God put the seed inside of you. God put
[52:20] power in the mango seed to be a mango
[52:22] tree. The mango would not feel led to be
[52:24] a fig tree because the power is in the
[52:27] seed to produce whatever the seed is.
[52:29] So if there's a son of God seed that God
[52:32] put inside of you, I don't care what
[52:33] smoke, what drink, what life you live,
[52:36] you're going to come forth.
[52:38] That's why I know the devil is defeated
[52:40] this morning. You press your way to come
[52:42] here this morning. You struggle to come
[52:44] in this morning. But that devil is
[52:46] defeated. It wasn't you struggling. It
[52:49] was the seed in you
[52:52] struggling. Glory.
[52:54] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. You may
[52:57] be seated. All your trials, what you
[52:59] think the trial was about? To see if you
[53:01] will give up. To see if you will turn
[53:03] back. To see if you will backside and
[53:05] just let go. But you had husband trial,
[53:07] wife trial, family trial, money trial,
[53:10] home trial, children trial, whatever
[53:13] trial you have, but you're still
[53:14] standing. Praise God. After a while, the
[53:16] devil going to just give up on you. He
[53:18] going to say that I can't handle him no
[53:20] more. I try to throw him down. I blow
[53:22] off his roof. He's still worshiping.
[53:24] Praise God. a a hitter has turned with
[53:26] sickness, but he's still shouting.
[53:29] Praise God. He lost the insurance and he
[53:31] lost a house, but he's still giving
[53:33] God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:37] What the devil will do a man like that?
[53:39] He said, "Take your flocks, take your
[53:41] people, take them and go."
[53:45] Hallelujah.
[53:47] Oh, I'm going to close with this this
[53:49] part. Amen.
[53:52] [Applause]
[53:54] Hallelujah. But Isaac drop a bomb in
[53:56] Congo. Just blow me out, man. Said,
[53:59] "Man, you never see that before." I was
[54:02] I was really a
[54:03] bomb. What did Pharaoh see when 2
[54:06] million people was walking out of Egypt?
[54:08] He saw 2 million people walking
[54:11] out. What do you think the people were
[54:13] feeling walking out? victory,
[54:17] liberty, no more no more slave massacre,
[54:20] no more task masters.
[54:22] What do you think God was
[54:24] seeing? 2 million people coming out.
[54:28] Watch what God
[54:29] seeing. 2 million people was not going
[54:32] to go in. Lord,
[54:36] you know what God was seeing? Who they
[54:38] were carrying. Yes.
[54:45] Some of them was even born yet. Some of
[54:47] the mothers was even pregnant yet. But
[54:49] God was seeing who they were carrying.
[54:52] 2 million people. And and not one of
[54:55] them growing over except two, Caleb and
[54:57] Joshua. Everybody only carrying promised
[54:59] seed. Every mother walking with promised
[55:02] seed. The 40 years only carrying
[55:05] promised seed.
[55:10] My God, I feel like
[55:13] screaming. Do you understand? 40 plus
[55:17] years in this message, there was only
[55:19] carrying
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:23] us. Praise God. You are the
[55:27] bride. Oh, young people, I have
[55:29] confidence in you that you are going to
[55:32] make it. The devil is afraid of you.
[55:34] He's afraid.
[55:44] season. All the people you thought were
[55:46] bride and prime material, they need
[55:48] thunders, they need inspiration. They
[55:50] come through the front door and they
[55:51] walk through the back door. Praise God.
[55:53] Hallelujah. But God have a woman at the
[55:55] well. God have somebody don't get drunk,
[55:57] that he going to make sober. God have
[55:59] somebody passing that he going to
[56:01] restore. Somebody at the bar right now
[56:03] they're smoking. Praise God. and go and
[56:06] bring them out. Who are they? The 11th
[56:08] hour gentile workers. Come on, give
[56:11] another bunch of church members. The
[56:13] 11th hour gentile workers.
[56:17] Glory. Hallelujah.
[56:19] You may be seated. Praise God. And when
[56:21] these bunch of people come, they're not
[56:23] coming for explanation. They coming for
[56:26] manifestation. They're coming for books
[56:28] and tapes. They're coming like them
[56:30] three wise men. But where is he? Where
[56:33] is he? Where is this promised manifested
[56:36] word? Oh, let's stand and give the Lord
[56:39] a
[56:40] shout. Let's even give us a
[56:44] song. Come and sing
[56:50] something. Oh, give him praise this
[56:52] morning.
[56:53] Hallelujah. Oh, do you love him this
[56:56] morning? Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:02] When we walk in the light. Oh, such a
[57:10] beauty.
[57:13] Oh,
[57:15] where do
[57:18] you see the power?
[57:22] Oh, and
[57:25] shine
[57:27] around
[57:28] mighty
[57:29] [Applause]
[57:31] and oh
[57:34] Jesus with the light of the world. Oh,
[57:40] one more time. Oh, we
[57:45] want Oh, and such a
[57:54] we Jesus name.
[57:58] of
[58:11] mercy for
[58:13] [Music]
[58:16] Jesus. Just one more time. We want to
[58:19] high
[58:29] [Music]
[58:49] My God, oh
[58:53] Jesus, the light
[58:58] of Oh, praise the Lord. This morning we
[59:02] have two scriptures we like to read.
[59:04] Luke
[59:06] 24:49-53 and Acts 1 vers4 to8. We want
[59:09] to welcome you again. Those connected to
[59:12] us on the hookup, we say God bless you
[59:16] and welcome
[59:18] Luke 24 reading from
[59:21] 49. And behold, I send the promise of my
[59:24] father upon you. But tar in the city of
[59:27] Jerusalem until he be due with power
[59:29] from on high. He led them out as fast to
[59:32] Bethany. And he lifted up his hands and
[59:34] blessed them. And it came to pass while
[59:37] he blessed them he was parted from them
[59:39] and carried up into heaven. and they
[59:42] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[59:46] with great joymen and were continually
[59:48] in the temple praising and blessing
[59:52] God. Amen. We want to turn to Acts 1
[59:56] reading from verse
[1:00:00] 4. And being assembled together with
[1:00:03] them, commanded them that they should
[1:00:07] not depart from Jerusalem. Yes, sir. But
[1:00:09] wait for the promise of the Father,
[1:00:13] which said, "He you have heard of me."
[1:00:15] For John truly baptized with water, but
[1:00:18] ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:00:20] Ghost, not many days hence.
[1:00:23] When they therefore will come together,
[1:00:25] they asked of him, saying, Lord, will
[1:00:27] thou at this time restore again the
[1:00:30] kingdom to Israel? And he said unto
[1:00:32] them, "It is not for you to know the
[1:00:34] times or the seasons which the Father
[1:00:36] had put in his own power. But ye shall
[1:00:38] receive power after the Holy Ghost come
[1:00:41] upon you, and you shall be witnesses
[1:00:43] unto me both in Jerusalem, in all Judea,
[1:00:46] in Samaria, unto the uttermost part of
[1:00:48] the earth." Let's pray. Father, we thank
[1:00:50] you for your word. And Lord, we pray
[1:00:52] that you would come into it and speak
[1:00:54] through your word. Confirm your word
[1:00:56] with signs, wonders, and miracles, and
[1:00:59] outpour your spirit upon the lives of
[1:01:00] your people. In Jesus name I ask it.
[1:01:03] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:01:07] Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] Have a title. Behold I send the promise
[1:01:16] of my father upon you. Wonderful. And I
[1:01:21] have an
[1:01:24] inspiration. Holy Ghost power from on
[1:01:26] high. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:29] My Lord. Hallelujah. But Brandham,
[1:01:32] question answered on the Holy Ghost. I
[1:01:34] have got to know what I'm doing before I
[1:01:37] can have faith in what I'm doing. Why
[1:01:40] you marry your wife? You had faith in
[1:01:41] her. You tried her. You watch her. You
[1:01:43] seen she come from who she was. That's
[1:01:46] the way the scripture is with God.
[1:01:48] That's what makes these visions, the
[1:01:50] pillar of fire, all these things because
[1:01:52] God promised it. God said, "So I have
[1:01:55] tested him by his word and know that it
[1:01:57] is the truth and you follow his word.
[1:01:59] And if there's a little confusion
[1:02:00] somewhere, there's something wrong
[1:02:02] somewhere because God never did work
[1:02:06] contrary to his own laws.
[1:02:09] He will never work contrary to his own
[1:02:12] laws. The winter won't come in summer.
[1:02:16] The summer won't come in winter. The
[1:02:18] leaves won't fall in springtime and come
[1:02:20] against in the fall. You just can't make
[1:02:21] it. Come on now. Yes. So I've said last
[1:02:25] night about the artisian well watering
[1:02:27] your crop. If you're standing out in the
[1:02:29] middle of the field, it's black night.
[1:02:30] You say, "Oh, great electricity. I know
[1:02:32] you in the field. I'm lost. I know where
[1:02:35] I'm going. Give light. I can see how to
[1:02:36] walk." There's enough electricity to
[1:02:38] light up the field. That's true. But to
[1:02:40] light up the room, but you got to know
[1:02:42] how to govern it. You might scream till
[1:02:44] you could scream no more. It will never
[1:02:46] light up. You have to work according to
[1:02:48] the laws of electricity in order to get
[1:02:52] light. Are you with me now? Oh, and
[1:02:55] that's the same way it is with God. God
[1:02:57] is the creator of heaven and earth, but
[1:02:59] he will only work as you follow his laws
[1:03:01] and instructions.
[1:03:05] So it's not a Viky vik thing.
[1:03:06] Electricity will not flow through wood.
[1:03:09] It have a a certain material. It will
[1:03:11] flow through and the spirit of God will
[1:03:13] flow through a certain material also.
[1:03:15] And that's why he have you have you a
[1:03:17] tabernacle as a vessel that he want to
[1:03:19] tabernacle himself in. Do you believe
[1:03:22] that? Now watch now it's
[1:03:24] watch. He said, "Now the method is the
[1:03:27] watch." He said, "Now the promise is the
[1:03:30] baptism of the spirit." Amen. Which is
[1:03:32] promised in the Old Testament and the
[1:03:34] New Testament. Behold, I sent the
[1:03:36] promise of my father. All we talking
[1:03:39] about is promises. This land of Canaan
[1:03:41] was a land in type of the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:44] That was a physical land. They came out
[1:03:45] of physical Egypt to physical Canaan
[1:03:48] land. We coming out of a natural land
[1:03:49] into a spiritual baptism. The Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] is the promise. Canaan land was it in
[1:03:55] type. Are you with me? So watch watch
[1:03:58] now. That is the promise. Behold, I send
[1:04:00] the promise of my father upon you. That
[1:04:02] is the promise. The promised land. Here
[1:04:04] we go. Is to live in this land of the
[1:04:07] Holy Spirit. That is God's promise to
[1:04:09] the church. It's to live in the power of
[1:04:12] the spirit. It's another world. It's you
[1:04:16] have to come out the land you're in, the
[1:04:18] condition you are in to live in that
[1:04:20] promised land. Oh, glory to God. Notice,
[1:04:23] notice Joseph when he was about to go,
[1:04:26] he said, "Make a pledge to me. Don't
[1:04:28] leave my bones in Egypt." Oh,
[1:04:30] hallelujah. He said, "Put, make a
[1:04:32] pledge. Make a covenant when you're
[1:04:34] going." Because I know you're going
[1:04:35] because God said, "So God can't lie. I
[1:04:38] know you're going to come out of here
[1:04:39] one day." Hallelujah. I'm not living to
[1:04:41] see it, but I know you're going to come
[1:04:42] out. He said, "But when you're going,
[1:04:44] take my bones with you." You know why
[1:04:46] Joseph said that? He know Messiah coming
[1:04:48] in the promised land. He know dynamics
[1:04:50] coming in the promised land. Evil
[1:04:52] resurrection come in the promised land.
[1:04:54] You're going not going to get Messiah in
[1:04:55] Egypt. You got to leave Egypt and go
[1:04:58] into the promised land. Oh, glory to
[1:05:00] God. Are you with me? So Jesus told
[1:05:03] them, don't leave Jerusalem. Stay in
[1:05:04] Jerusalem until
[1:05:07] until until you get power from on high.
[1:05:11] Don't leave that word. Wait for the
[1:05:13] power on high. Don't go with an
[1:05:15] interpretation. Don't go with some man's
[1:05:17] idea. Go with some intellectual
[1:05:19] conception. Stay until the power of God
[1:05:22] come upon your life because that's a
[1:05:25] promise of the father. Notice what we
[1:05:27] said this morning. Behold, I send. It's

[1:05:32] sending. This is Jesus. It's written in
[1:05:34] red. Behold, I send. This is God
[1:05:37] talking. It's in red. Jesus said, "I am
[1:05:40] sending it." Are you going to wait for
[1:05:41] it or you going to run out before it
[1:05:43] comes? Oh, hallelujah. I've been waiting
[1:05:46] all these years and I'm still waiting

[1:05:51] dynamics. We had mechanics and dynamics
[1:05:53] and we are going to have mechanics and
[1:05:55] dynamics.
[1:05:57] Oh, glory to God. For 50 years, word,
[1:06:00] word, word, word, word. But the time has
[1:06:02] come for the word to turn into power.
[1:06:05] The time has come for the spirit to come
[1:06:08] upon the word. This is that hour. Glory

[1:09:08] season talk about being transformed by
[1:09:10] the renewing of your mind. If your mind
[1:09:14] don't change, your heart ain't going to
[1:09:15] change because the mind is the womb to
[1:09:17] the soul. Hallelujah. That's where
[1:09:19] you're hearing things. Hallelujah. You
[1:09:21] could you could hear it and and and you
[1:09:23] could back you up or you could hear it
[1:09:24] and press it. Sometimes you have to be a
[1:09:26] little disagreeable sometimes.
[1:09:28] Hallelujah. If it's contrary to the word
[1:09:30] of God, you have to be disagreeable. Oh,
[1:09:32] glory. That woman with a blood issue,
[1:09:34] she was disagree with her husband
[1:09:35] because her husband didn't want her to
[1:09:37] go to that small church to hear this
[1:09:39] little wayside preacher preaching called
[1:09:41] Jesus. But her money ran out. You see,
[1:09:43] she written, she didn't want, she wasn't
[1:09:45] going alone. She had money. She's paying
[1:09:46] the doctors who wasn't helping her. They
[1:09:48] were just taking her money. But her
[1:09:50] money ran out. God waiting for some
[1:09:52] people money to run out. Praise God.
[1:09:54] Because you're not moving in the right
[1:09:56] direction because you have your pride.
[1:09:58] Because you have some pay packet. But
[1:10:00] when God let that fall and fail, then
[1:10:02] you Oh, God. Yes. He was waiting to hear
[1:10:04] that all along. You could have said it
[1:10:06] all along. Oh, God. Hell yes. When you
[1:10:08] had the money, you're not going to know
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:10] God. When the money gone, you Oh, God.
[1:10:14] I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Come on now.
[1:10:16] That What else? What else? What else?
[1:10:17] I'm desperate. Come on now. What do you
[1:10:19] want? I want the Holy Ghost. Come on.
[1:10:21] Yeah. That's good. That's good. That's
[1:10:23] good. That's a promise. I'm sending it
[1:10:25] to you. It's on the way.
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:37] Oh my. Oh, glory to God. So this promise
[1:10:41] of the Holy Ghost is in the Old
[1:10:42] Testament. Is it a New Testament? Isn't
[1:10:44] that right? Now he said, let's notice
[1:10:46] Jesus in Luke 24:29 had commissioned the
[1:10:49] apostles after they had been saved and
[1:10:53] sanctified according to the word. St.
[1:10:55] John 7:17, sanctify them through thy
[1:10:57] truth. Thy word is truth. He gave them
[1:11:00] power to heal the sick, cast out devils,
[1:11:02] raise the dead. Matthew 10 power, which
[1:11:04] was temporary power.
[1:11:08] Don't let that power fool you.
[1:11:12] Amen. That the one has disappeared
[1:11:17] temporary power. Judas was there and
[1:11:20] they came back rejoicing. Lord, even the
[1:11:22] devils are subject to us. When the devil
[1:11:25] see us, they're
[1:11:26] running. Jesus said, "Don't rejoice for
[1:11:28] that." That's not what you're rejoicing
[1:11:30] for. He said, "Bring it back to the word
[1:11:32] now." Don't rejoice now. Rejoice because
[1:11:33] your name in heaven.
[1:11:36] Rejoice because your name is in the
[1:11:37] book. That's why everybody here should
[1:11:40] be rejoicing this morning.
[1:11:43] If you know your name is on the book,
[1:11:46] you are the happiest person in
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:49] Trinidad. The prime minister don't have
[1:11:52] access to that book. Being a bishop or
[1:11:54] the pope, nobody could take your name
[1:11:56] out. You should be shouting. That is
[1:12:01] encrypted. That is encrypted by God. The
[1:12:04] devil can't get the password to get into
[1:12:07] behind God's computer to to try to erase
[1:12:10] your name and destroy your life.
[1:12:15] Your name is sealed.
[1:12:20] Oh, hallelujah. Glory.
[1:12:25] Listen. Your name was in heaven. Your
[1:12:27] name was in the book. But what the
[1:12:28] revelation 10 says, I saw another mighty
[1:12:30] angel coming with the book open. What he
[1:12:33] coming with? He coming with your name
[1:12:34] and he covered with seven
[1:12:36] thunderses out. And the devil let him
[1:12:39] written the right he writing through.
[1:12:40] Devil spend listening to right there.
[1:12:42] Seal it. So he couldn't see it. And God
[1:12:44] take it and put it on the seventh seal
[1:12:46] when there was silence but only for half
[1:12:49] an hour. We have half an hour to get out
[1:12:51] of here. Half an hour to get
[1:12:53] transformed. A special half an hour. A
[1:12:56] half an hour that's in God. A half an
[1:12:58] hour the devil knows nothing about
[1:13:00] because only silence under there. But
[1:13:02] under there we add in faith, virtue,
[1:13:04] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:13:07] godliness, kindness. Under there we add
[1:13:09] in the life. We add in the stature. We
[1:13:11] add in the word. We going to make it.
[1:13:13] And you going to make it.
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:21] You're going to be a real Christian. You
[1:13:24] may be seated.
[1:13:26] Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] Hallelujah. Have thousands and thousands
[1:13:30] of church members, but you will be a
[1:13:31] real Christian. When you walk, the
[1:13:34] devil's going to shake. When you walk,
[1:13:37] the devil is going to scatter. Here come
[1:13:38] a real Christian. We can't stand. You
[1:13:41] know what the devil say? Paul, I know.
[1:13:42] Some people trying to
[1:13:44] imper I know. But who are you?
[1:13:47] Those devils know when they see sunship,
[1:13:49] when they see courtship, when they see a
[1:13:52] predestinated elected seed, a light from
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:03] God. Some of you trying to hide
[1:14:05] Christianity. Hide hide living in the
[1:14:07] shadows or whatnot. It's almost
[1:14:10] embarrassing. The place black. If if it
[1:14:12] showing spirit realm, it's a dark
[1:14:13] screen. And when you walk, use a big big
[1:14:15] light. Devil seen you big big big big
[1:14:17] big
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:21] all seen is darkness darkness and light
[1:14:23] passes. Look look look look look one of
[1:14:24] them and and you trying to do so.
[1:14:29] I hope he ain't see me
[1:14:33] and your light flashing. So like a a
[1:14:35] light flashing. So look one of them.
[1:14:36] Look one of them. You better wake up and
[1:14:38] shout and get more power to stand. get
[1:14:41] more power to press because this little
[1:14:44] light of
[1:14:46] mine. I'm going to let it shine. Shine
[1:14:49] the light till Jesus
[1:14:53] comes. You can't hide no more. We
[1:14:56] exposing you. Hallelujah. You're playing
[1:14:59] chicken, but you're eagle. We going to

[1:15:10] You may be seated.
[1:15:12] You come with some chicken coat and
[1:15:13] you're you're big. You're too Yes. You
[1:15:15] too big for that. You're not even
[1:15:17] fitting right in that chicken garment.
[1:15:18] Big eagle. I see your wings.
[1:15:22] You can't play chicken and escape. I see
[1:15:24] your wings. You born to soar. You born
[1:15:28] to fly. You born the Lord lift me up
[1:15:30] where I belong. Come on now. Where the

[1:15:49] breakthrough for you if you desire it.
[1:15:51] There's victory for you if you desire
[1:15:53] it. Just have a desire and the Holy
[1:15:55] Spirit will pick up your desire. Right
[1:15:57] there in this, the Holy Spirit going to
[1:15:58] pick up your Just get the desire and the
[1:16:00] Holy Spirit will pick up your desire and
[1:16:02] speak right back to you. Oh, glory to
[1:16:04] God. He will anoint me to speak direct
[1:16:06] to you.
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:15] He gave them power to heal the sick,
[1:16:17] raise the dead, they come back
[1:16:18] rejoicing, but their names on the land
[1:16:20] book of life. You remember, but they
[1:16:22] were not yet converted.
[1:16:28] Jesus told Peter the night of his
[1:16:30] crucifixion after
[1:16:33] you are converted.
[1:16:35] Amen.
[1:16:36] So Peter wasn't an instant stunt. I can
[1:16:39] have instant milk, instant coffee,
[1:16:41] instant chicken, instant everything
[1:16:42] instant. And they want that tablet now
[1:16:45] pop by the ministers
[1:16:48] open. When you take that instant, you're
[1:16:52] feeling like a
[1:16:53] son. Jesus told Peter, you will deny me
[1:16:56] three times.
[1:16:59] Don't die enough to get a man depressed
[1:17:03] because you were the disciple who was
[1:17:05] had this mouth to say well that you been
[1:17:08] me to come Peter always forward and
[1:17:11] Jesus say you deny me three times now
[1:17:15] but
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:22] you you want to fail but
[1:17:24] [Applause]
[1:17:30] But you'll be converted.
[1:17:34] Failure is not a problem to give up.
[1:17:36] Failure is part of the life.
[1:17:41] Some people don't like to fail. And when
[1:17:42] they fail, they No, no, no. That's part
[1:17:44] of life. How much businesses went
[1:17:47] bankrupt and bounced back?
[1:17:49] How much men who flop and fail and come
[1:17:52] back and did much more better than what
[1:17:54] they did before?
[1:17:56] It's only in Christianity people when
[1:17:57] people down, they want to beat them up.
[1:17:58] Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
[1:18:00] Down. Down. down.
[1:18:02] Like somebody's a joy to beat people up,
[1:18:05] to make people feel they tough because
[1:18:07] somebody is down. Don't fool yourself.
[1:18:09] Not because somebody is down. You are
[1:18:10] up. If you beat somebody down, you dunk.
[1:18:13] Just like them. If you are up, you're
[1:18:15] going to raise somebody where you are.
[1:18:18] Come on, say amen to somebody. You heard
[1:18:19] what I said? If you are up, you're going
[1:18:22] to raise somebody up to where you are.
[1:18:32] You be seated.
[1:18:34] The reason people beat people down
[1:18:36] because they in the spirit, they down
[1:18:37] there too. And wearing long dress,
[1:18:39] wearing jacket and tie, but they in the
[1:18:40] spirit, they down there too. Look at the
[1:18:42] prodigal son. The young brother went and
[1:18:44] spend all the money and carry on and
[1:18:46] whatnot. Come back home. Father happy to
[1:18:48] see your son always looking out to get
[1:18:50] back to son and look at the older
[1:18:51] brother. Who is that inside of there?
[1:18:54] Your brother come back. Why he come back
[1:18:59] for then to hear the fatted calf get
[1:19:01] killed? And here cuz I'm bringing grass
[1:19:04] to he feed that fatted calf. He thought
[1:19:06] he was going to have a feast so that the
[1:19:07] fatted calf he can keep the less less
[1:19:09] fat one but the fatted one the real one
[1:19:13] cut that one up. He's priming priming
[1:19:15] for that for that calf. Come here
[1:19:16] brother that done cook and curry
[1:19:19] already pepper already and that already
[1:19:23] brother come feasting that already he he
[1:19:25] just depressed because the father
[1:19:27] rejoiced my son was lost leave 90 and 9
[1:19:30] and go after the lost you stay there you
[1:19:33] stay there with yourself righteous self
[1:19:35] does go after the
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:40] lost hallelujah oh give the Lord some
[1:19:44] praises God I I hope you fall in love
[1:19:46] back with Jesus after this service. I
[1:19:49] hope there's a joy strike your soul for
[1:19:50] when he saved you. Remember when he
[1:19:53] called you? Remember when he saved you?
[1:19:55] It was you and him alone. The preacher
[1:19:58] wasn't even involved. It was God dealing
[1:20:00] with your own heart. Which man save you?
[1:20:04] What can the Lord say? No. No man can
[1:20:06] save you. No man could fill you. God is
[1:20:09] here to fill you with the Holy
[1:20:11] Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:20:15] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:20:18] You ever think you're going too far, you
[1:20:19] sin too much, this thing, this don't
[1:20:22] ever believe that once is an
[1:20:24] opportunity, God could do something
[1:20:25] special in your life. Hallelujah. You
[1:20:29] can't go far enough. Praise God. And you
[1:20:31] can't study your children, your family.
[1:20:32] I don't care what they smoking, what
[1:20:33] they drinking, what they doing. Oh God,
[1:20:35] your offspring going to be there with
[1:20:36] you, too. That's a promise. That's a
[1:20:38] promise of God. They going to be
[1:20:39] delivered somehow. I can explain it.
[1:20:42] Praise God. Who can explain that? Jesus
[1:20:45] needs pastor Samaria. Who can explain
[1:20:47] that? Because that woman name was in the
[1:20:49] book. She didn't know her name was in
[1:20:50] the book. She didn't know she was
[1:20:52] elected and predestinated. All she know
[1:20:54] she's struggling with her children and
[1:20:56] from this man to that man and to that
[1:20:57] man and to that man. But God have mercy.
[1:21:00] God saw what was in her heart and God
[1:21:02] meet her at her need. She was delivered.
[1:21:05] She was set free. And I believe in God
[1:21:07] people going to be set free inside of
[1:21:09] here that you could go and sin no more.
[1:21:11] that you could hold the son of man set
[1:21:13] free is free indeed. Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:15] We need freedom. We need a liberty. No
[1:21:18] more task masters. The task master beat
[1:21:20] you to do this, do that, do that. The
[1:21:22] devil beating you to do this and do
[1:21:24] this, but you get a break from your task
[1:21:26] masters. My God, let my people go. Oh,
[1:21:30] glory God. People going to go free. Oh,
[1:21:33] hallelujah. Praise God. Every demon bing
[1:21:36] in your life, we going to deliver you.
[1:21:38] You going to be delivered. House of hell
[1:21:40] going to give way to the name of the
[1:21:42] Lord. Oh, glory to
[1:21:44] God. My
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:50] God. You be seated. If in the spirit
[1:21:53] realm, God, open your eyes. Is the
[1:21:55] amount of demons camping outside your
[1:21:57] home and along the streets, you wouldn't
[1:21:59] leave your home without praying. If in
[1:22:01] the spirit realm, you recognize all the
[1:22:02] forces loosed against you. You wouldn't
[1:22:05] take things for granted. You would
[1:22:07] recognize the battle is not yours. It
[1:22:08] was the Lord's. It's only because the
[1:22:10] angel of the Lord encamp around those
[1:22:12] that fear him that you are protected.
[1:22:14] Come on now. My problem. You know what I
[1:22:17] said? It's only because the angel of the
[1:22:19] Lord encamp around those that fear him.
[1:22:22] A lot of things going on in the spirit
[1:22:24] realm you know nothing
[1:22:29] about. You be seated. What about him
[1:22:32] said when Daniel sought to seek the Lord
[1:22:34] and Daniel was praying asking God
[1:22:36] Gabriel was fighting to come to Daniel
[1:22:39] but David was battling battling and Bam
[1:22:41] said if Daniel stopped praying the angel
[1:22:43] stopped coming is Daniel prayer was
[1:22:45] bringing the angel so you know what
[1:22:47] praying going to do when you begin to
[1:22:49] pray if my people that's called by my
[1:22:52] name shall humble themselves and pray
[1:22:54] when you begin to pray the angels have
[1:22:56] to come deliverance coming breakthrough
[1:22:58] coming because you calling upon the name
[1:22:59] of the Lord Not by your might, not by
[1:23:02] your power, but by my
[1:23:06] spirit.
[1:23:11] Hallelujah. You may be seated. So with
[1:23:14] the Holy Spirit, before the Holy Spirit,
[1:23:16] receiving the Holy Spirit, you are
[1:23:18] believing unto eternal life. But when
[1:23:19] the Holy Spirit comes, it is eternal
[1:23:22] life. You are begotten of the spirit of
[1:23:24] sanctification, but never born of the
[1:23:27] spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in.
[1:23:29] He's talking about in the mother in the
[1:23:31] mother's womb there's a bunch of muscles
[1:23:33] be beaten and so on in the mother's womb
[1:23:35] but when the baby comes out as life
[1:23:37] comes into the baby
[1:23:41] isn't that right the same thing he said
[1:23:43] you are begotten at sanctification all
[1:23:45] the cells are being built up at
[1:23:46] sanctification but the Holy Ghost come
[1:23:48] and that is life isn't that right he
[1:23:51] said my dear Methodist brother Holiness
[1:23:53] Nazarene the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:57] is different from sanctification
[1:23:58] sanification ation is
[1:24:00] cleansing which is preparation of life.
[1:24:02] But when the Holy Ghost come, it is
[1:24:04] life. Preparation is cleaning the
[1:24:06] vessel. The Holy Ghost is filling the
[1:24:08] vessel. Sanctification is cleaned and
[1:24:10] set aside for service. The Holy Spirit
[1:24:12] puts it in service. The vessel that God
[1:24:16] cleaned up. So that's all God trying to
[1:24:18] do. Clean you up, turn you upside down,
[1:24:20] shake you out, do your God a good clean,
[1:24:22] and then fill you and then use you for
[1:24:24] his honor, his glory. One more ride, one
[1:24:26] more shake up. Oh, glory to God. You
[1:24:28] have one little space in this life to
[1:24:30] live. Don't waste it. Some people wait
[1:24:34] too long to recognize, wait a minute,
[1:24:35] what this life is about trying to get
[1:24:37] house, car, husband, wife, all wife,
[1:24:40] this life behind you. And ask yourself,
[1:24:42] what have I done for the kingdom of God?
[1:24:45] Okay. So, we find out the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:48] God himself in you. God was above and
[1:24:50] far with Moses. God was with you in
[1:24:53] Jesus Christ. Now, God is in you in the
[1:24:56] Holy Ghost. No three gods, one God
[1:24:58] working in three offices. So God came
[1:25:00] down and dwelt in a sanctified body,
[1:25:03] virgin born of a woman. That was God
[1:25:04] himself. You know what? He placed his
[1:25:06] tent among us. God dwelt in a tent
[1:25:09] called Jesus Christ.
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:14] So Jesus Christ was God tent. Yes sir.
[1:25:16] That God dwell in. I've been in Cairo
[1:25:19] and Egypt. The cap never did come
[1:25:21] because it was the cornerstone. The
[1:25:23] church in the church. It was the
[1:25:24] cornerstone in the full church. It was
[1:25:26] the headstone. It never come. It was
[1:25:29] rejected. He said, "And that's where the
[1:25:31] builders today." That's why the br the
[1:25:34] bride building here we go of Christ is
[1:25:38] not ready for the bridegroom.
[1:25:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Listen carefully. See,
[1:25:45] that's what we have to say. What the
[1:25:46] tape say, you know. Amen. Oh, we could
[1:25:47] preach a lot of stuff, but see this is
[1:25:49] accurate. This is God speaking. Amen.
[1:25:52] That's why the bride building of Christ
[1:25:56] is not ready for the bridegroom because
[1:25:59] the builders has rejected the chief
[1:26:01] cornerstone that was laid on the day of
[1:26:04] Pentecost which is the baptism of the
[1:26:06] Holy Spirit.
[1:26:11] So they got mystery mystery mystery
[1:26:12] mystery mystery mystery but life
[1:26:14] mysterious.
[1:26:16] You don't know what mystery connecting
[1:26:17] with the life. Hallelujah. So you see
[1:26:18] mystery is one thing but life this is
[1:26:20] the Holy Ghost has to come back to the
[1:26:22] Holy Ghost has to come back to
[1:26:24] Pentecost. Same life, same sensation,
[1:26:27] same works, same signs, same wonders.
[1:26:30] Amen. Isn't that right? Amen. Watch. See
[1:26:32] the people act funny but they don't come
[1:26:35] in order of our psychology, our
[1:26:37] educational, our learned. It don't fit
[1:26:40] in there. They ticked off. You see
[1:26:41] people say you have the word, the word,
[1:26:43] the word, the word. Yes, but the word
[1:26:44] need the spirit to come alive. That's
[1:26:47] why Jesus said, "Tarry in the city of
[1:26:49] Jerusalem until you endure with power
[1:26:52] from on high." What kind of power? Power
[1:26:54] to pray, power to live, power to
[1:26:56] overcome, power to say, "I'm sorry."
[1:26:58] Power to say, "Forgive me." Power to be
[1:27:00] humble. Praise God. Usually when people
[1:27:02] get blessed, they get puffed up. And I
[1:27:03] we know when people going about to fall,
[1:27:05] they get arrogant. They get puffed up.
[1:27:06] They get all up there hoy toy. And
[1:27:09] afterwards, God bring them down because
[1:27:11] the way up is down. So anytime somebody
[1:27:13] about to fall, they put theelves quite
[1:27:15] up. then they just fall right back down.
[1:27:17] But God wants us to stay in the dust. He
[1:27:19] want us to stay humble. God is looking
[1:27:21] for somebody. The more God bless you,
[1:27:23] the more humble you can become. That's a
[1:27:25] challenge. That's a difficulty. Because
[1:27:27] usually when people get blessed, they
[1:27:28] get puffed up. But God wants somebody.
[1:27:30] The more you bless. God want to open up
[1:27:32] the blessing and channel it through you.
[1:27:34] Come on. You could do better than that.
[1:27:36] Come on. Say amen, somebody. God want to
[1:27:38] bless you. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:41] Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] But I'm talking about the little rat in
[1:27:44] Egypt. Little mouse in Egypt saying
[1:27:45] eating sparingly.
[1:27:47] The whole band full of grain and like a
[1:27:50] mouse going on a diet. Eating sparingly.
[1:27:53] Sparingly. That's how we operate.
[1:27:55] Sometimes God gave you a blessing. You
[1:27:56] think all of it you feel you that
[1:28:00] that have more than that for you man.
[1:28:03] God want to fill your entire being till
[1:28:05] you become a manifestation of God. Think
[1:28:08] about it now. Jesus said the same works
[1:28:10] I do shall you do also. He was dropping
[1:28:12] promises on them because only promises
[1:28:15] will make the difference in your life.
[1:28:17] For you to be delivered, you have to
[1:28:18] have a promise. You get a breakthrough,
[1:28:20] you have to get a promise. Amen. Your
[1:28:22] deliverance, you have to get a promise.
[1:28:24] It's by these promises, you get faith
[1:28:26] and virtue and knowledge. You can't sit
[1:28:28] here without a promise. You have you
[1:28:29] promise what you're looking for. He gave
[1:28:31] Abraham a promise. Come on. All the
[1:28:33] brothers have promises. Job was looking
[1:28:35] for a promise of Messiah. The people of
[1:28:38] Israel are looking for a promise of
[1:28:39] deliverer in Moses. The people is
[1:28:41] looking for promise of Messiah. You have
[1:28:43] to be looking for a promise. What are
[1:28:45] you looking for? Behold, I send the
[1:28:47] promise of my father upon you. You've
[1:28:50] got to be looking for a promise. But
[1:28:52] your promise is the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[1:28:55] glory to God. He'll make a better wife,
[1:28:57] a better husband. Amen.
[1:29:01] Oh my.
[1:29:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:29:07] Notice Jesus said wait. Wait doesn't
[1:29:09] mean to pray. It means so wait. They
[1:29:11] were not fit subjects to preach yet
[1:29:14] because they only knew his resurrection
[1:29:15] by his person of seeing him outside. He
[1:29:18] commanded them not to preach anymore.
[1:29:20] People don't I guess the five now even
[1:29:22] want to hear about that. Jesus told his
[1:29:24] disciples don't even preach. Stop
[1:29:26] preaching because to go in the new
[1:29:29] season you need power. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] Amen. Listen after they started
[1:29:34] preaching Holy Ghost they get licks you
[1:29:35] know. That's right. Yes. Yes. And they
[1:29:38] didn't submit sick leave to stay from
[1:29:41] church because they get licks. Could you
[1:29:42] imagine they getting licks without the
[1:29:43] Holy Ghost?
[1:29:46] After 3 months, you don't know if
[1:29:48] anybody come back to church.
[1:29:50] But when they got the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:52] they got licks and they went back to
[1:29:54] church. They say, "Lord, strengthen us
[1:29:56] and send out some more power that we
[1:29:59] could go out and preach the word."
[1:30:03] Don't get lick without the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:05] We know what happened. Amen. That is
[1:30:07] licks with the Holy Ghost. So don't
[1:30:09] think Holy Ghost means no licks.
[1:30:11] Hallelujah. But you don't want to say
[1:30:13] amen. I caught that. Oh, you thought
[1:30:14] Holy Ghost mean no licks. They got They
[1:30:16] had Holy Ghost and they got lit. They
[1:30:18] had Holy Ghost, they got stoned. They
[1:30:20] had Holy Ghost and they got shipwrecked.
[1:30:22] Come on, say amen, somebody. And the
[1:30:24] Holy Ghost is God in them.
[1:30:27] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Glory to God.
[1:30:32] You see, everything don't have to work
[1:30:33] out smooth as you think, but it just
[1:30:36] have to be in God. Hallelujah. It
[1:30:40] doesn't matter if he put you in the Red
[1:30:41] Sea, lion's den, hurry for this. It
[1:30:43] doesn't matter.
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:48] Oh my God. Could show food proof to the
[1:30:50] devil. I could put one in the lion's
[1:30:52] den. You can't You can't throw them off.
[1:30:54] I could put them in the fiery furnace.
[1:30:55] You can't throw them off. I could put
[1:30:57] them in front of Red Sea. You can't
[1:30:58] throw them off. I could go anywhere,
[1:31:00] anytime, any place, under any condition.
[1:31:02] Come on now. You cannot
[1:31:06] throw off my people. It is my people
[1:31:08] you're dealing with.
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:13] Look what God has do. When the people
[1:31:15] backslide, let them king of Babylon take
[1:31:16] them. Amen. Some king take them. And
[1:31:19] then after they repent, he shall punish
[1:31:20] the king.
[1:31:24] You think God holding a long long grudge
[1:31:26] concerning his people? You misbehave, he
[1:31:28] deal with you. He straighten you out.
[1:31:30] But when you see a repent that spirit
[1:31:33] holding you, he punish you. Punish the
[1:31:35] king of Babylon. Don't mess with God's
[1:31:37] people. Don't fool with them. My God, my
[1:31:40] Don't fool with them. Touch not my
[1:31:43] anointed and do my prophets no
[1:31:48] harm. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:55] shout. Listen. going on a man that like
[1:31:58] you today and he like you tomorrow he
[1:32:00] love you today he not love you tomorrow
[1:32:04] he excited about today he not excited
[1:32:06] about you tomorrow go not like that
[1:32:08] that's why who we for you he called
[1:32:11] he's not now calling you that fix up
[1:32:13] already before who he knew he before he
[1:32:16] called who he call he justified
[1:32:19] and he had already glorified so as far
[1:32:21] as God concern it's finished we just
[1:32:23] going through the motion it come like
[1:32:25] you know you're winning to rock the win.
[1:32:26] You know you win the boxing match
[1:32:28] already.
[1:32:30] That man don't know he's already
[1:32:31] defeated. Amen.
[1:32:33] But you have to go into the the ring
[1:32:35] tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:32:37] You can't sit down and defeat him in
[1:32:39] your mind.
[1:32:40] You may be
[1:32:42] come like pass through Africa. One of
[1:32:44] the place we we has to land there.
[1:32:47] Africa is drama. Hallelujah. And
[1:32:52] um so they asked for yellow fever card
[1:32:55] and so on. We give them that and have 10
[1:32:57] years and whatnot. So the man called the
[1:32:59] brother who leading aside aside I know
[1:33:00] some kind of thing like some kind of
[1:33:01] with money or whatnot. When the cards
[1:33:04] come out now because we get inoculated
[1:33:06] for something we don't even know without
[1:33:08] a
[1:33:10] needle. They just put in the book
[1:33:12] because you need that. But that you know
[1:33:15] to pay for that and I tell that's some
[1:33:18] people they mark them. You have the Holy
[1:33:19] Ghost. You you have the Holy Ghost. But
[1:33:21] I just paper to effectively inoculate.
[1:33:24] You had to get a needle. You had to get
[1:33:25] injection. But in Africa they just put
[1:33:27] something inside the book and get a
[1:33:29] stamp and say well
[1:33:30] go. Don't take that not for Christianity
[1:33:32] here that you are good because somebody
[1:33:34] write that in a book. You this, you
[1:33:36] that. No, you have to experience it. You
[1:33:39] got to taste it for yourself.
[1:33:44] Hallelujah. So that was a joke for us.
[1:33:46] We have inoculation. We don't even know
[1:33:48] what kind it is. But we never felt it.
[1:33:50] We never tasted it. They just write on
[1:33:52] paper. That's a paper experience. And
[1:33:55] you know what? You could pass all these
[1:33:56] stations with that. You know, because
[1:33:58] that that way they see and they change
[1:33:59] to look at. But you see God, he ain't
[1:34:01] come with no paper. No, come with no
[1:34:04] paper testimony, paper this and paper
[1:34:05] that. You have to have the real thing.
[1:34:08] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. So Peter
[1:34:11] didn't say silver and gold have I none.
[1:34:13] Such as I have. Hold on. Come on with a
[1:34:14] book.
[1:34:16] Hold that. Read that. Peter didn't have
[1:34:19] that. He said gold I don't have. But
[1:34:21] such as I have I give it unto you. Rise
[1:34:24] up and walk. That is what we talking
[1:34:26] about. That's when talk is over. Come
[1:34:29] on, say amen, somebody. Action time now.
[1:34:31] Be coming for your family. Be coming for
[1:34:33] your loved ones. When you see a son, my
[1:34:36] God, in your spirit realm, you claiming
[1:34:38] him. You saying deliver him. You
[1:34:40] challenging demons and devils upon him.
[1:34:43] You have the authority to do so. By the
[1:34:46] authority vested in me, for as a son
[1:34:48] under the seventh seal, I said, devil,
[1:34:50] come out of the people in the name of
[1:34:52] Jesus. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] Glory, glory, glory. What your blessings
[1:34:59] blessed.
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:04] Is this real to you? You may be seated.
[1:35:08] God is real. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:35:12] So they were not fit to preach. They
[1:35:14] only knew his resurrection by his
[1:35:15] person. I've seen him outside. He
[1:35:17] commanded them not to preach anymore,
[1:35:18] not to do nothing until first they
[1:35:20] endured power from on high. I don't
[1:35:22] believe that any preacher is sent of God
[1:35:24] can be correctly ordained because God is
[1:35:26] infinite and once God does once he does
[1:35:29] all the time. If God will not let them
[1:35:31] preach until they went to Pentecost and
[1:35:33] receive here we go the Pentecostal
[1:35:36] experience not a message experience you
[1:35:39] believe message or believe the words or
[1:35:41] believe the Bible. No, a literal
[1:35:43] experience that you and you alone knows.
[1:35:47] Nobody can explain it away from you
[1:35:50] because you have to have your own
[1:35:51] experience. So you have to have a
[1:35:52] hungering in your heart for your own
[1:35:53] personal experience to meet God. I
[1:35:56] remember as a 17year-old walking down
[1:35:57] San Fernando asking God I don't know who
[1:36:00] you are but I want to meet you. I want
[1:36:02] to know you. There was a deep in my soul
[1:36:05] as a young 17year-old crying out 1975
[1:36:08] hungering and thirsting for God. Oh and
[1:36:10] he met me. Oh glory to God. Fire. Praise
[1:36:13] God. I encountered that on fire and he
[1:36:16] will meet you too. But there got to be a
[1:36:18] hungering and thirsting. And Jesus said,
[1:36:20] "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:36:22] after righteousness."
[1:36:24] They shall
[1:36:27] be filled. Come on, give the Lord a
[1:36:30] shout.
[1:36:32] Glory to God. So this word come to give
[1:36:35] an appetite in you. Come to give a
[1:36:37] desire inside of you. Come to bring an
[1:36:39] expectation inside of you to lift you
[1:36:41] above the movies, above the styles,
[1:36:43] above the fashions, above the internet,
[1:36:45] above everything around you, above the
[1:36:47] cell phone, above all the social media
[1:36:49] to raise you up and keep raising you up.
[1:36:52] Praise God. Because you are born of the
[1:36:54] heavenly power doesn't come from below.
[1:36:56] This power comes from above. It's power
[1:36:59] from on high. It's not power from the
[1:37:01] pastor. It's not power from the
[1:37:02] minister. It's power from on high. They
[1:37:05] heard a sound from heaven as a rushing
[1:37:07] mighty wind and they were filled with
[1:37:09] the Holy Ghost. Something happened to
[1:37:11] them. Oh, come on now. Don't just look
[1:37:13] at me intellectually. Say
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:19] amen.
[1:37:21] Glory.
[1:37:22] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:37:28] Listen, you may be seated. This is
[1:37:31] serious because in Ezekiel 9, the
[1:37:34] slaughtering angel was called forward to
[1:37:36] begin the slaughter. Hallelujah. And the
[1:37:37] inorn writer was among them. And God
[1:37:39] said, "Listen, before they start to
[1:37:41] slaughter, put a mark upon those that
[1:37:43] sigh and cry." Amen. Those that in
[1:37:45] travail, those that have a burden,
[1:37:49] that's why you can't be light. You have
[1:37:51] to have a burden for good for the word
[1:37:54] of God. And the Bible says utterly male.
[1:37:57] We have that here. Female, we have that
[1:37:59] here. Young, we have that here. Old, we
[1:38:02] have that here. Start in my house.
[1:38:06] But come not near any man with that
[1:38:09] mark. So we have no time to play. We
[1:38:12] have children to pray for. We have
[1:38:13] husband to pray for, wife to pray for.
[1:38:15] Seal, seal, seal, seal. Put a mark. Put
[1:38:19] them out. Put them out. Put them out.
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:26] The angel not asking who who your
[1:38:28] pastor. The angel is asking you what
[1:38:30] group you belong. But when the press

[1:38:50] the the angel with the swinging weapons

[1:38:54] pastor is, how long you going to church.
[1:38:56] You got to get it as an individual. As I

[1:39:01] group taken, one group left, one taken.
[1:39:02] We here to isolate you as an individual
[1:39:05] and say you is who God speaking to this
[1:39:07] morning.
[1:39:09] Not the entire group. You, the
[1:39:11] individual who God speaking to, not your
[1:39:13] husband, you. Not your wife. You.
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:22] Two in a bed, one taken, one left. Two
[1:39:25] in a field, one taken, one left.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah. The place we land on place
[1:39:30] called GMA have a have a volcano and
[1:39:32] it's not active right now. I think in
[1:39:34] 2003 destroyed the whole place. Visit
[1:39:36] the big rocks. This how far the volcano
[1:39:38] is, how far the hill is and so on where
[1:39:41] the city is. It wrecked the entire city.
[1:39:44] I said, Lord Jesus, what a thing. Amen.
[1:39:47] Big rocks, huge guys, black. They take
[1:39:50] it and grind it and make roads and
[1:39:52] whatnot. And bur talk about judgment of
[1:39:55] God a being a ton coming down a ice. I
[1:39:58] forgot what they call it again. Hail
[1:40:01] falling a ton. Judgment coming and
[1:40:04] striking the earth. And the people like
[1:40:06] atomic father are just material for the
[1:40:07] atomic bomb to strike. What where are we
[1:40:10] at? We're not in the beginning or the
[1:40:12] middle part. We're at the end of part.
[1:40:14] It's just because God put us here right
[1:40:16] now to prophesy until the time come.
[1:40:19] They have to wait until Amen. We can't
[1:40:21] manufacture anything to produce
[1:40:23] anything. We have to wait till my change
[1:40:26] come. When the change come there will be
[1:40:29] no I'm trying to say anything about it.
[1:40:31] It will speak for itself. Peter Peter
[1:40:34] Peter just lived it out. He manifested
[1:40:37] Christ. Oh hallelujah. So when your
[1:40:40] spirit come what will you manifest? Has
[1:40:42] to be Jesus Christ. Oh my. So therefore
[1:40:47] Ephesians church 8, thou cast them with
[1:40:49] evil. Thou has tried them with say the
[1:40:51] apostles and found them to be liars.
[1:40:53] These Ephesians believe that God people
[1:40:56] ought to be holy. They will not put up
[1:40:59] with sin in the church. Holiness wasn't
[1:41:01] a phrase with them or a figure of
[1:41:04] speech. It was a way of life.
[1:41:07] Hallelujah. Brotherly kindness is a
[1:41:09] figure of speech right now. A phrase,
[1:41:11] brotherly kindness, spirit of
[1:41:12] forgiveness. Honey,
[1:41:15] you don't have to live nothing. You
[1:41:16] don't have to forgive nobody. Just b
[1:41:18] honey.
[1:41:21] Thou has tried them that say they're
[1:41:23] apostles and are not found them as
[1:41:25] liars. My that's a blunt statement. Thou
[1:41:28] has tried them who call themselves
[1:41:30] apostles. Isn't that presumptuous? What
[1:41:32] right has a people to try those who call
[1:41:34] themselves apostles? How do they try
[1:41:37] them? Oh, I love this. It's in Galatians
[1:41:39] 1:8. Though we or an angel from heaven
[1:41:42] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:41:46] that which we have already preached unto
[1:41:48] you, let him be accursed. Are you ready?
[1:41:52] It was the apostles who brought the
[1:41:54] original word to the people. The
[1:41:56] original word could not change. Not even
[1:41:59] a duck or a dash of it. Paul knew it was
[1:42:03] God who had spoken to him. Hallelujah.
[1:42:05] So he said even if I come and try to
[1:42:09] give a second revelation try to make one
[1:42:12] little change in what I give originally
[1:42:14] let me be accursed.
[1:42:17] So Paul was saying I Paul cannot come
[1:42:20] back and change the first revelation
[1:42:23] because God can't change his mind about
[1:42:26] his word. Oh could we give the Lord some
[1:42:29] praises people?
[1:42:32] You see, Paul knew the first revelation
[1:42:34] was
[1:42:35] correct. God can't give a first
[1:42:39] revelation then a second revelation. If
[1:42:42] he did, he would be changing his mind.
[1:42:44] He can't give a revelation and add to it
[1:42:47] as he did in the garden of Eden when he
[1:42:49] promised a seed to the woman, then later
[1:42:51] designated that seed to come through
[1:42:52] Abraham. Then later it would come
[1:42:54] through the bloodline through David. But
[1:42:56] it was the same revelation. It only gave
[1:42:59] the people more information to help them
[1:43:02] to receive and understand it. But it was
[1:43:05] the same revelation. But God could add
[1:43:07] more to give more information of how
[1:43:09] it's going to be unfolded. God's word
[1:43:12] can't change. The seed came exactly as
[1:43:15] revealed. And see what those false
[1:43:17] apostles were doing. They came with
[1:43:19] their own word.
[1:43:21] Oh, hallelujah. Are you with me? They
[1:43:24] came with their own word. Those
[1:43:26] Ephesians knew that Paul word was was
[1:43:30] those Ephesians knew that word as Paul
[1:43:33] had taught it. They were full of the
[1:43:34] Holy Ghost by the laying of hands of
[1:43:37] Paul. Hallelujah. They look those four
[1:43:38] apostles in the eye and said, "You are
[1:43:40] not seeing what Paul said. Therefore,
[1:43:42] you are false." So, we have a prophet in
[1:43:44] this hour. His name is William Marian
[1:43:46] Brown. A prophet in the end time
[1:43:48] according to Malachi 4. Behold, I sent
[1:43:51] you Elijah the prophet before that great
[1:43:53] and terrible day of the Lord. So God
[1:43:55] sent a prophet with original word. And
[1:43:57] if we stay with an original word, we're
[1:43:58] going to see firefall. You're going to
[1:44:00] see God confirm it. We can't bring our
[1:44:03] own word. We have to bring word on top
[1:44:05] of word on top of word. It's not your
[1:44:07] feelings. I don't like you. It's not a
[1:44:10] liking contest. You don't have to like
[1:44:12] me. It's got to be the word. I'm not
[1:44:14] here for you to like. I'm here to
[1:44:16] deliver a love letter to you. Glory to
[1:44:18] God. Your husband, give me a message for
[1:44:21] you. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:44:23] house. You are his wife. You are his
[1:44:27] bride. He giving preachers to send his
[1:44:30] word to you.
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:35] Okay. Hallelujah. So, you are not saying
[1:44:37] what Paul said. Therefore, you're false.
[1:44:39] That sets my heart on fire. Amen. Get
[1:44:41] back to the word. It's not you that
[1:44:43] really tries the apostle and the prophet
[1:44:45] and teacher. It's the word that tries
[1:44:47] them. We have to try people. Try
[1:44:49] everything. Hallelujah. The Bible say
[1:44:50] try every spirit. Every spirit. Not some
[1:44:53] spirit. Every spirit. I look at where
[1:44:55] they from. What country they from?
[1:44:56] Every. Oh hallelujah. You see I have no
[1:45:00] problem with people getting fight. And
[1:45:01] if I offend men, I'll get a fight if I
[1:45:04] offend God. I have no people problem
[1:45:07] people displeased with me. I as long as
[1:45:10] God is not displeased with me. I have no
[1:45:12] problem people walking away from me.
[1:45:13] That's okay. But I don't want God walk
[1:45:16] away from me.
[1:45:18] I prefer to please God than to please
[1:45:20] men. I prefer to please God than to
[1:45:23] please friends. That's why I say friend
[1:45:24] or no friend. Hallelujah. Praise God. I
[1:45:29] pledged when I was 17 years old that I
[1:45:31] wouldn't let money, woman, or popularity
[1:45:33] come between me and my God. I wasn't
[1:45:35] married yet. I didn't have any children
[1:45:36] yet. I was young. But I saw what
[1:45:38] happened with money, woman, and
[1:45:39] popularity. And I pledged to God by the
[1:45:41] grace of God, I wouldn't let that come
[1:45:43] between me and him. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:45:45] Friend and no friend, family and no
[1:45:47] family. I want that word. I come too far
[1:45:50] to turn back now. Too many miles I've
[1:45:52] traveled. Too many roads I've been
[1:45:54] through. I have too much to gain to
[1:45:56] lose. Not going to back up. I'm not
[1:45:58] going to give up. I'm not going to let
[1:45:59] go. I'm not going to turn around. I'm
[1:46:01] going to stay the course. Oh, glory. I'm
[1:46:04] going to finish this race. Oh, glory to
[1:46:06] God. Paul passes to Martin. Martin the
[1:46:08] Luther, Lut the Wesley. They keep
[1:46:10] passing the battle. And we have the
[1:46:11] battle in our hands. We going to run
[1:46:13] with it. We are running onto the
[1:46:15] resurrection. We are running on
[1:46:16] perfection. We are running with it to
[1:46:18] see a perfect church where the Holy
[1:46:21] Ghost have the preeminences in that
[1:46:22] church. When number six is dethroned,
[1:46:25] man is kicked out and number seven comes
[1:46:27] on the Holy Ghost itself put on fire
[1:46:31] resting upon the sons and daughters of
[1:46:33] the living God.
[1:46:35] Oh hallelujah.
[1:46:39] Number six, defeated. Hallelujah. Number
[1:46:42] seven, raised up, anointed. God don't
[1:46:44] have to take your ideas. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:46:47] There's an idea of God. Like I said,
[1:46:49] imagine two million people coming out
[1:46:50] and they don't even know. They are
[1:46:51] carriers. What God sees them as
[1:46:54] carriers. Carriers of those who would
[1:46:56] inherit the promise. Cuz when they came
[1:46:59] to Ken B, God said, "Not one all you
[1:47:01] going over. Just Caleb and Joshua."
[1:47:03] Hallelujah. He said, "Your children go
[1:47:04] over, but not you." Praise God. And when
[1:47:06] Jesus came, they was boasting. Our
[1:47:08] fathers eat man in the wilderness. And
[1:47:10] Jesus said, "And they are everyone
[1:47:12] dead." And brother said that dead means
[1:47:15] eternally separated from God.
[1:47:17] Hallelujah. That's how bad it was. The
[1:47:19] same people that God called God judged.
[1:47:22] Praise God. So don't think don't don't
[1:47:26] be careful.
[1:47:28] Be careful. People serving the God, I
[1:47:31] call it, of the imagination of their own
[1:47:32] heart. They're making their own gods.
[1:47:34] That's not the God of the Bible. No sir.
[1:47:36] God the Bible straight out Moses. They
[1:47:38] got the Bible straighten out Noah. They
[1:47:40] got the Bible straighten out Joshua.
[1:47:41] They got the Bible straight out all them
[1:47:43] sons of God. And the God Bible ego
[1:47:45] straighten us out. You got to be kidding
[1:47:47] me. That that is crazy. God is the word.
[1:47:51] No man could tell me let's go on, let's
[1:47:53] move on. There's a way to correct
[1:47:55] things. There way to handle things.
[1:47:57] There are way to deal with this thing.
[1:47:59] There's a way that see right man. And
[1:48:00] the way is a way of death.
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:06] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:10] Man is still man. Some time ago we read
[1:48:12] for you. Moses in his time of lingering.
[1:48:14] Moses bring the people out. They saw
[1:48:15] miracles. They saw signs. They saw
[1:48:17] wonders. Rey open up. They dance. They
[1:48:19] eat. Everything else. Moses bring them
[1:48:21] up to the mountain of God. And he gone
[1:48:24] up there to see God. And the people find
[1:48:25] staying too long.
[1:48:30] They say we don't know what is Moses. My
[1:48:32] God.
[1:48:34] It almost like they bring theelves out.
[1:48:36] He said, "We don't know what happens
[1:48:37] most. Make us a god.
[1:48:39] Make us a god." And Aaron said, "Bring
[1:48:42] the earrings and then how they make a
[1:48:43] golden calf." I said, "This is the God
[1:48:45] that brought you to Egypt." My God.
[1:48:49] And Moses up there waiting fire burning
[1:48:51] out the ten commandments. God taking his
[1:48:53] hands and writing in stone, giving Moses
[1:48:55] instructions to give to the people
[1:48:58] because the reason God brought the
[1:48:59] people out was to give them instructions
[1:49:01] as to how he lives, how he operates,
[1:49:03] that they could be blessed. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:06] Because if you break the rules and the
[1:49:07] laws of God, you'll face the penalty of
[1:49:09] that. He wanted them to know his laws,
[1:49:11] know his will, know his rules. Amen.
[1:49:14] Amen. Praise God. That's right. When
[1:49:16] Moses come, they having carnival, they
[1:49:18] dancing, they whining, they carrying on,
[1:49:20] they drinking, they drunk. Amen. Glory.
[1:49:23] Hallelujah. Moses take and and the earth
[1:49:26] open up and swallow some of them.
[1:49:29] Judgment again. All through his
[1:49:30] judgment. This is the God we serve now.
[1:49:32] A God of judgment. Yes. God as is you.
[1:49:37] He is no respector of persons. He
[1:49:39] respects his word. It is serious.
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:47] Amen. Some might get message to
[1:49:49] preacher. Oh Lord, do I have to say
[1:49:51] that? Do I have to do what I do? Amen.
[1:49:54] But warn to me if I don't.
[1:49:59] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm not kid no crowd.
[1:50:02] Amen. I'm not kidding for nobody. I'm
[1:50:04] getting to to believe. That's why I love
[1:50:06] when the brothers get hear from God and
[1:50:08] speak what upon their heart. You hear
[1:50:10] directly from God. Somebody had pray and
[1:50:13] seek the Lord and get something from the
[1:50:14] Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Man is
[1:50:17] still man. Hallelujah. All look like in

[1:53:11] country. God could tell Jonah if you
[1:53:13] tell them repent, they they repent. God
[1:53:15] didn't tell Jonah that. Jonah say,
[1:53:17] "Okay, Lord, thank you Lord." But he g

[1:53:20] But all that God have a way of all

[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:36] You see, forgive me. I'm sorry,
[1:54:39] Lord. It's something when you repent, it
[1:54:42] touches God.
[1:54:46] Oh, it it does something to him. Oh,
[1:54:48] glory to God. So, watch. One of these
[1:54:51] days there's going to come for a prophet
[1:54:52] in La Church. You will know if he's a
[1:54:55] real one, God sent or not. Yes, you
[1:54:58] will. For if he's of God, he will be in
[1:55:01] that word exactly as God give it to
[1:55:03] Paul. He won't deviate from that word
[1:55:06] for a moment, not by one iota. In that
[1:55:09] last age when there will be many false
[1:55:11] prophets appearing, watch and see how
[1:55:16] they keep telling you that if you don't
[1:55:19] believe them and what they say, you will
[1:55:22] be lost. But when that last day prophet
[1:55:24] comes on the scene, if he truly that
[1:55:27] prophet, he'll be crying out, "Get back
[1:55:30] to the word or you'll be lost." He won't
[1:55:32] build on a private revelation or
[1:55:34] interpretation, but on the word. Amen.
[1:55:36] Isn't that right? Amen. So masterpiece,
[1:55:38] he say he started the day of Pentecost
[1:55:40] to build another man masterpiece. The
[1:55:42] original word started the first church.
[1:55:45] What was it? The seed word, the word
[1:55:49] manifested. Amen. The promise that was
[1:55:52] being given. Hallelujah. That's how it
[1:55:53] started. The church started with promise
[1:55:56] manifested. Amen.
[1:55:59] Do you get that? What happened?
[1:56:01] Pentecost was promise
[1:56:03] manifested. Behold, I send the promise
[1:56:06] of my father upon you. Wait for it. So
[1:56:10] if they walk up without it, the promise
[1:56:11] wasn't going to be manifested. But
[1:56:13] Pentecost was promised. Manifest. Say
[1:56:16] it. Say it. Manifested. Say it loud.
[1:56:20] The Pentecost was the promise
[1:56:22] manifested. So you have to receive
[1:56:24] promise manifested. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:56:27] shout. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:56:33] Hallelujah. So watch the word is a seed
[1:56:36] that I saw swed. The seed was the word.
[1:56:38] Any seed that abides alone does nothing.
[1:56:40] It's got to fall into the ground. So
[1:56:42] that perfect church fell into the ground
[1:56:44] and I see a Rome when she become an
[1:56:46] illumination. Now he proved to be right.
[1:56:49] He Christ was very light that they
[1:56:52] claimed they were worshiping. They
[1:56:53] claimed they were worshiping that light.
[1:56:55] They claim they are worshiping it. But
[1:56:57] their tradition, the glare in their
[1:56:59] face, do we? Okay. Okay. Notice his
[1:57:03] works was the living word itself. What
[1:57:05] he did was the living word itself.
[1:57:08] Showing that he was the light that has
[1:57:10] been promised since the beginning of the
[1:57:12] world. He was that light. His light on
[1:57:16] the promised word of the age make it
[1:57:18] live exactly what the promise said it
[1:57:20] would do. So when God promises in things
[1:57:23] light have to come on that word to make
[1:57:25] it live. Light has to come on that word
[1:57:28] to make it live or water the seed to
[1:57:32] make it live or shine in the darkness
[1:57:34] into the sea to make it live. Light has
[1:57:37] to come. Spirit has to come not by my
[1:57:40] not by power but by my spirit. Look for
[1:57:42] it. Expect it. Hallelujah. Live for it.
[1:57:46] Pray for it. The spirit is what is
[1:57:49] promised. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:57:52] When the day of Pentecost was come, when
[1:57:55] the Holy Ghost fell upon those people,
[1:57:56] they acted like drunk men and women
[1:57:58] staggering under the impact of the Holy
[1:58:00] Spirit and they walk away and wag their
[1:58:02] heads. These people is drunk with new
[1:58:04] wine and so forth. It absolutely was the
[1:58:07] light. The word that has been prophesied
[1:58:10] made manifest. Think about it. They were
[1:58:12] drunk walking like this and so on. Isn't
[1:58:14] that right? But that was the word made
[1:58:17] manifest. No signs yet, no wonders yet,
[1:58:20] just drunk looking people. Oh, glory to
[1:58:22] God. They have new wine. It was new
[1:58:24] wine. It was the wine of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:26] It was the wine of God. It brought
[1:58:28] stimulation of revelation. Oh, glory to
[1:58:31] God. But they was drunk on something
[1:58:32] else. It was the wine from Joy prophecy.
[1:58:35] It shall come to pass afterwards. I'll
[1:58:37] pour my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:58:41] Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.
[1:58:43] Your young men shall see visions. It was
[1:58:45] that word from Joel. Come down upon
[1:58:48] them. Joel word come alive. Joel
[1:58:51] prophecy come alive. Joel prophecy made
[1:58:54] manifest. That was the Holy Ghost. The
[1:58:57] Holy Ghost is the word coming on your
[1:59:00] life being made
[1:59:02] manifest. What's the kingdom of God? The
[1:59:05] word in you turn into power. Oh, give
[1:59:07] the Lord a shout. That's why when Jesus
[1:59:10] said when they said come here, go there,
[1:59:12] go. He said believe not, behold the
[1:59:14] kingdom is within you. Give the Lord a
[1:59:17] shout in the house. Oh, glory to God.
[1:59:20] That's what the devil want you to know.
[1:59:22] The kingdom comes inside of
[1:59:26] you. Give the Lord a scream. Do you get
[1:59:30] that you are walking with the
[1:59:35] kingdom? That word is inside of you. The
[1:59:37] kingdom is inside of you. Oh, glory to
[1:59:40] God. You're going to turn into power.
[1:59:43] You're going to turn into power. So
[1:59:45] that's the kingdom of God. The word turn
[1:59:46] into power. You're going to turn into
[1:59:47] power. That's the kingdom of God. The
[1:59:49] word turn into power. So in every age,
[1:59:54] the word made manifest come to life is
[1:59:56] the light of the age. So when God said
[1:59:58] in Joel 28, it shall come to pass, I put
[2:00:00] my spirit upon all flesh. That was the
[2:00:03] light upon that word. When the word has
[2:00:05] been manifest, then it becomes light. In
[2:00:07] all ages, God has sent forth so much of
[2:00:09] his word for each age. God always sends
[2:00:11] somebody that that word can get into and
[2:00:14] show light of it. Amen. So right now
[2:00:16] it's talk talk. Everybody talking,
[2:00:17] everybody a microphone, everybody can
[2:00:18] shout and say what they want. Say what
[2:00:20] they feel and whatnot. But there comes a
[2:00:22] when the season change, when there's
[2:00:24] character in the lives of sons around
[2:00:27] the world, where the light will come
[2:00:28] over that and bring it alive, then it
[2:00:31] will speak for itself. Amen. No more to
[2:00:33] boast. Don't have to claim anything and
[2:00:35] boast anything like that. Don't have to
[2:00:37] get paper testimonies to say how great
[2:00:38] the ministry is or anything like that.
[2:00:40] No, nothing like that at all to give
[2:00:42] boost for the church and whatnot. No, it
[2:00:44] wouldn't need another. It will speak for
[2:00:46] itself. For itself. But I'm saying it
[2:00:49] will speak for itself. For itself. He
[2:00:51] will let it be made known among men. Oh,
[2:00:54] give the Lord a shout. You see, you have
[2:00:56] to know the word. You have to believe
[2:00:58] the word. He would let it known. So you
[2:01:00] think all these years God just have us
[2:01:02] killing time having church? That's not
[2:01:04] the objective of God. We are sons not
[2:01:06] church members. We are sons and
[2:01:08] daughters of God. It have Adams out
[2:01:10] there to go after. It have people you
[2:01:12] have to go after. Only you could do it.
[2:01:14] So you can't say you're shy. You let go.
[2:01:16] You don't feel led. God going to use you
[2:01:19] to get that last one to get your fallen
[2:01:21] brother to get your fallen family. God
[2:01:23] going to use you. I'm telling you to
[2:01:25] your face. God going to use you. Yes,
[2:01:27] you're weak, but God going to use you.
[2:01:29] the law of God going to still use you.
[2:01:33] If not you then who
[2:01:39] notice God will call you when you're
[2:01:41] strong.
[2:01:44] Sting you a little bit. Amen. God will
[2:01:46] call you when you're strong. God will
[2:01:48] call you when you to feel your strength
[2:01:49] of feeling strong. God called me I'm a
[2:01:50] strong man. God call you a sinner. God
[2:01:53] called Gideon when Gideon was the
[2:01:54] weakest least of all. But God has called
[2:01:56] you wherever you are. However you are
[2:01:58] and make you strong because your
[2:02:00] strength go be in God. Yes. Good gives
[2:02:03] the Lord a shout of praise. So you don't
[2:02:05] have to be all right to be who you are.
[2:02:08] Moses was always Moses. When he was a
[2:02:09] baby, he was baby Moses. He can't
[2:02:11] deliver nobody as a baby, but he is
[2:02:12] still Moses. Amen. His name is Moses. He
[2:02:15] is the deliverer. He doesn't know it
[2:02:17] yet, but he is the deliverer. Baby
[2:02:19] deliverer. He doesn't even know that
[2:02:21] yet. Nice child and you're shaking and
[2:02:23] whatnot. That's Moses. He is coming on.
[2:02:26] He is 2 years. He can't deliver nobody.
[2:02:28] He is 6 years old. He can't deliver
[2:02:29] anybody. 12 years, he still can't live
[2:02:31] anybody. But he is the deliverer.
[2:02:35] Hallelujah. Come on, say amen, somebody.
[2:02:37] But you are who you are. You are sons
[2:02:39] and daughters of God. You can't even
[2:02:41] heal a headache, but you're a son of
[2:02:43] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can't
[2:02:46] even Amen. Pray for your little finger,
[2:02:48] but you are still a son of God.
[2:02:50] Hallelujah. Wife laugh at you, children
[2:02:52] laugh at you, but you're still a son of
[2:02:54] God. But you are coming on. Glory to
[2:02:56] God. You're going to grow up. You're
[2:02:58] going to become strong. Oh, the devil
[2:03:00] can't get stronger. He is just the
[2:03:02] devil. But you can. Come on, say amen,
[2:03:05] somebody. The devil is still the devil.
[2:03:07] He's always will be the devil. But you
[2:03:09] have been born in sin. Saving iniquity.
[2:03:13] Every service, you're getting stronger.
[2:03:15] Every book you read, you're getting
[2:03:16] stronger. Every prayer you pray, you're
[2:03:18] getting stronger. Every effort to
[2:03:20] praise, you're getting stronger. Every
[2:03:23] time you say you're going to
[2:03:25] worship, you're getting stronger.
[2:03:28] Give the Lord a shout in the
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:35] house. You may be seated. And God said,
[2:03:38] "I call you young men
[2:03:40] because you are strong." And if you're
[2:03:42] feeling weak, the Bible say, "Let the
[2:03:44] weak say I am strong." Bible say, "Let
[2:03:47] let the weak say I am strong." Because
[2:03:50] you have to say it before it materialize
[2:03:52] upon your life. You got to speak it. Let
[2:03:54] the weak say I am strong. You got to say
[2:03:56] you're going to make it because a man
[2:03:58] think in his heart so is he or so he is.
[2:04:01] Oh, glory to God. I'm going to be
[2:04:03] filled. I'm going to be sealed. I'm
[2:04:05] going to get a breakthrough. God going
[2:04:07] to bless me going in and coming out. He
[2:04:09] going to bless me all over. Oh, give the
[2:04:11] Lord a shout in the house. Do you
[2:04:13] believe that this
[2:04:15] [Applause]
[2:04:17] evening? The word is a seed. I'm going
[2:04:20] to wrap up. It cannot be afford until
[2:04:22] the sun strikes it. Hallelujah. The sun
[2:04:24] has got to be upon the sea to make it
[2:04:26] bear to make it bring forth. You take
[2:04:28] the word, take the word of God in your
[2:04:31] heart. Walk into the shikina glory. When
[2:04:34] you do, it will bring shoeb bread. It
[2:04:36] will bring mana. Oh, hallelujah. And
[2:04:39] brother struck it. They took mana that
[2:04:41] was fallen every day. They managed to
[2:04:42] get stale. Uh God was sending them from
[2:04:45] his bakery. Heavenly mana fallen every
[2:04:47] day fresh. Fresh from heaven. But they
[2:04:51] took some and put it in the shikina
[2:04:52] glory. That one never got stale. It
[2:04:55] wasn't the manner. It was where the
[2:04:58] manner was placed. It's not just the
[2:05:00] word is where the word is placed. You
[2:05:04] take that word and put it on a shikina
[2:05:05] glory. Oh, it's different all together.
[2:05:08] It becomes manner to you. It becomes
[2:05:10] shre to you because of where it is
[2:05:14] placed. And God put your heart to
[2:05:16] uncover the shikina glory. He want to
[2:05:19] put that glory in your heart. And when
[2:05:20] the minister come and brings a word,
[2:05:22] drop it inside your heart. And you had
[2:05:24] shoeb bread. You have shoe bread for the
[2:05:26] week. You have shoe bread until next
[2:05:28] Sunday. You have shoe bread every day
[2:05:30] because the shikina is upon your heart.
[2:05:32] And the word is being dropped inside
[2:05:34] your heart. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:05:35] shouts, some praises. You are sons and
[2:05:38] daughters of the living God. You are
[2:05:40] going to make it. Hallelujah.
[2:05:41] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:05:45] I'm talking about people coming to
[2:05:46] church, repent before the service start.
[2:05:48] And when they come to service and the
[2:05:49] usher sits you down, you could come up
[2:05:50] and kneel, offer some prayer before the
[2:05:53] Lord and then go back and sit down and
[2:05:55] start to pray. You have no time to walk
[2:05:57] downstairs, walk around and say this one
[2:05:59] and see. After service, you could do all
[2:06:00] of that. But before service, you're
[2:06:02] getting yourself in gear. We want to
[2:06:03] change the whole tone and approach of
[2:06:05] how we see service and what we're going
[2:06:07] to do when we come to church. You're
[2:06:08] making an extra effort because you're
[2:06:10] looking for the glory to come down. When
[2:06:12] Solomon had everything in order, Solomon
[2:06:15] brick was heard. Solomon had it from
[2:06:16] different countries, different parts
[2:06:18] coming together. And when Solomon
[2:06:19] finished, the Bible said the glory of
[2:06:21] the Lord filled the house that the
[2:06:24] minister could not minister. One of
[2:06:26] these days we have such a service. The
[2:06:28] minister will not be able to minister
[2:06:31] because you'll be walking with your
[2:06:32] glory. You'll be walking with the glory
[2:06:34] of God. The glory of God will be upon
[2:06:36] your life when you come here. You ain't
[2:06:37] come here to go back home. You come here
[2:06:39] to be in his presence, to bask in his
[2:06:41] presence. You ain't come here just to
[2:06:43] dip in and dip out. This not a party.
[2:06:46] This not a tea party where you just
[2:06:47] stick in and step out. No, this is yet
[2:06:49] to be reconnected. You come here to get
[2:06:52] reconnected to your original glory, to
[2:06:54] the original spirit, to original Eden.
[2:06:57] You come to get reconnected whole week
[2:07:00] in the world. You're in church, your old
[2:07:02] day in the work and whatnot. When you
[2:07:03] come to church, you come to get a
[2:07:04] connection. You come to get fully
[2:07:06] charged. Glory. Hallelujah. Sit down a
[2:07:09] minute. When you're charging your cell
[2:07:11] phone, somebody say 50%. 60%. According
[2:07:14] to where you go, how long you want to
[2:07:15] go, you want 100%. That's right. So why
[2:07:17] you want to come to service and get 10%.
[2:07:21] You get 10% charge ready to go already.
[2:07:23] Only 10% you want to take by 10 time
[2:07:25] make two spin by Tuesday that that run
[2:07:27] out. Next minute
[2:07:30] tray request Thursday. And if you miss
[2:07:33] that prayer request, you're half dying
[2:07:34] Friday. By Saturday, you're almost in
[2:07:37] the morg. And by Sunday, we had a pray
[2:07:40] resurrection prayer. So don't don't
[2:07:42] don't don't leave here with 10% charge.
[2:07:44] Leave here with a 100% charge. Let you
[2:07:47] get a good charger and you come here to
[2:07:48] get your battery charger up. You want to
[2:07:50] be fully charged when you leave here.
[2:07:52] When the devil when your devil see you
[2:07:53] coming say stay away. Stay away because
[2:07:55] she will zap
[2:07:57] you. Hallelujah.
[2:07:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's a zapping
[2:08:02] life. Praise God. Hallelujah. You're
[2:08:05] repellent proof. Your zika proof.
[2:08:07] Mosquito proof. Hallelujah. Demon proof.
[2:08:11] Oh, glory to God. You're covered by the
[2:08:13] Holy Ghost. Covered by the blood. Oh,
[2:08:16] glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:08:19] My God. Could you take a little more?
[2:08:22] Oh, glory. People sickness and diseases
[2:08:23] and and sick and all kind of things
[2:08:25] coming. They have more coming, you know.
[2:08:27] Different name. Same demons. They just
[2:08:30] renaming them. Just giving them new
[2:08:32] names. But it's the same devil. Sickness
[2:08:35] coming to challenge the sons of God.
[2:08:36] Prom will push back sickness. They would
[2:08:39] stop diseases. He said we will stop
[2:08:42] diseases. Come on now. Come on, preach
[2:08:44] back to me, somebody. He said it that we
[2:08:47] going to stop diseases. But disease have
[2:08:50] to be here for us to
[2:08:51] [Applause]
[2:08:56] stop. How we going to stop them and
[2:08:58] coming? They have to be coming. And when
[2:09:00] them coming, we coming too.
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:06] Glory to God. Hallelujah. My God. My
[2:09:10] God. You may be seated. I seen heaven
[2:09:12] looking over the banister of time. I see
[2:09:14] angels looking over and said they're
[2:09:15] going to make it. Yes. Yes. Yes. They're
[2:09:17] coming on. Them sons of God coming on. I
[2:09:19] told them in Africa, we are coming back.
[2:09:22] We are coming back to our inheritance.
[2:09:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:09:27] Amen.
[2:09:30] [Applause]
[2:09:31] Too late.
[2:09:35] Oh man. Feel good this morning. It's too
[2:09:38] late. Those three hub boys, they were
[2:09:40] praying three times a day. They say,
[2:09:42] "Man, you can't pray three times a day."
[2:09:43] He say still praying three times a day.
[2:09:44] God reserving. How about deliver making
[2:09:47] all kind of plans and this and that and
[2:09:48] make all kind of mouth champion and say
[2:09:50] what he want to say. They say, "Listen,
[2:09:52] we not even care to answer." The king be
[2:09:54] careful. Write a letter and put a
[2:09:56] letterhead and say care of this and care
[2:09:57] of that and what they say. Say we not
[2:09:58] even careful. Just tell the king we not
[2:10:00] bowing down.
[2:10:02] Just tell the king we're not bowing
[2:10:03] down.
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:07] No sensation, no feeling, no emotion.
[2:10:10] These are not fire experts. They don't
[2:10:12] have specialized in fire garments to
[2:10:14] say, "Well, they they a fire expert and
[2:10:15] a fire suit and they go face fire
[2:10:18] bravely.
[2:10:20] They are ordinary folks like you and I."
[2:10:23] And they speak a word. Our God is able
[2:10:26] to deliver.
[2:10:27] [Applause]
[2:10:30] And if he don't deliver, we still will
[2:10:32] not bow down.
[2:10:34] [Applause]
[2:10:36] You take them out and they walking
[2:10:37] towards the fire. This never happened
[2:10:39] before. You see, I want to tell you
[2:10:40] this. There are things that going to
[2:10:41] come in your life. Are you ready? That
[2:10:45] never happened before.
[2:10:48] So, stop living like if it's supposed to
[2:10:50] be as you are accustom with it. This
[2:10:54] never happened before. On their way to
[2:10:56] the fire, their bones are being loosed.
[2:10:58] On their way to the fire, they throw
[2:11:00] them in the fire and they refuse to
[2:11:02] burn. They call that fireproof. We don't
[2:11:04] want material that was around them, but
[2:11:06] they were fireproof. It was a Holy Ghost
[2:11:09] fire that was hotter than the fire that
[2:11:12] the king had. Oh, glory to God. God
[2:11:15] going to proof us with so much stuff.
[2:11:17] Look, listen. God going to God going to
[2:11:20] God going to surround us with so much
[2:11:21] power. Not even death. The grim reaper
[2:11:23] come with a big hook and we watching
[2:11:24] them show and say, "Where is that? Where
[2:11:25] is that? Where is that? Where is that?
[2:11:28] Reap somewhere else. We going to
[2:11:30] challenge death itself. The rapture is a
[2:11:32] challenge to death. We shall not see
[2:11:34] death. We shall be changed in a moment,
[2:11:37] in a twink of an eye, man. I don't feel
[2:11:39] like preaching. Oh, glory to God.
[2:11:41] Everybody afraid the grim reaper man
[2:11:43] with a skull and a big hook. Grim Reaper
[2:11:45] looking at you saying, "I'm coming for
[2:11:46] you." Coming for who? Not me. Your wrong
[2:11:50] age, wrong stage. Shall not die but live
[2:11:54] to declare the works of the Lord. Oh,
[2:11:57] hallelujah. The Lord had chasened me
[2:11:59] sore but he had not given me over unto
[2:12:01] death. Oh glory to God. Open up the gate
[2:12:04] gates of righteousness. Oh hallelujah.
[2:12:07] The stone that the pill refused has
[2:12:10] become the headstone of the corner. It's
[2:12:12] the Lord's doing. It's the Lord's doing.
[2:12:15] God did
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:21] it. Glory to God. Amen.
[2:12:25] God bless you to go through your stuff.
[2:12:28] You may be seated. Look at Joseph.
[2:12:30] Joseph had visions and everything else.
[2:12:32] But Joseph ordained to hit the prison.
[2:12:33] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. He ordained his
[2:12:36] brothers to sell him out. Amen. They
[2:12:37] figure they're doing themselves a
[2:12:38] service because they're going to fight
[2:12:39] with his spirituality, which is
[2:12:42] consciousness and awareness and
[2:12:43] confidence and faith and so on. His
[2:12:44] blessing, his rainbow coat, his
[2:12:46] anointing, his revelation. They haven't
[2:12:48] fight with him. So they say, "Let's cut
[2:12:50] him off." I call it VHS politics. Them
[2:12:53] big fat tapes. long time they cut
[2:12:54] somebody off from your convention, cut
[2:12:56] them off from your services or what and
[2:12:57] you figure they done they done done they
[2:12:58] done done but season change VHS gone
[2:13:01] through they don't have that no more so
[2:13:04] they cut off Joseph sell him away and
[2:13:07] they say good problem done
[2:13:10] when people dump you to tell you problem
[2:13:12] done they get rid of you and you don't
[2:13:15] even know you're feeling depressed
[2:13:16] you're feeling down you're feeling low
[2:13:17] and God say I'm feeling good how they
[2:13:20] dump you now I could I could pick you
[2:13:23] I didn't want you with them to begin
[2:13:25] with. I want you apart. I want you
[2:13:28] separated. I want to bless you. I want
[2:13:30] to show you who you are, who I
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:35] am. So after Joseph B, he cry and whatn
[2:13:38] not. They coming out to Egypt. How you
[2:13:40] think you feeling? I'm going out to
[2:13:42] Egypt. He's singing specials. Can't sing
[2:13:44] no specials. Can't write no songs.
[2:13:47] Joseph in tears. Joseph feeling the pain
[2:13:49] of separation from brethren and
[2:13:50] brotherhood. But there's only a time.
[2:13:53] Amen. Afterwards, Joseph get adjusted,
[2:13:55] start to behave like a Christian.
[2:14:01] Joseph behaving right. You get
[2:14:03] promotion, promotion, promotion. Some
[2:14:05] promotion is trouble.
[2:14:07] He get promotion to garden and
[2:14:09] everything else. Partifer wife end up
[2:14:11] interested in Joseph. Joseph run for his
[2:14:12] life. Run real hard, he end up in
[2:14:15] prison. It's not justified. But guess
[2:14:19] what? God want him there. Amen.
[2:14:21] Hallelujah.
[2:14:22] Now you see we could look back on Joseph
[2:14:24] life and say amen. Amen. But if that
[2:14:26] happened to you, you know, Amen. Amen.
[2:14:28] Amen.
[2:14:31] It easy to read the story. But is that
[2:14:34] your story? Do you accept Romans 8:28
[2:14:37] that we know all things work together
[2:14:40] for good? God wanted Joseph there to
[2:14:43] strip him because he had visions, he
[2:14:46] have dreams, he have revelation, he have
[2:14:48] inspiration. But God have to get that
[2:14:50] man in order.
[2:14:52] And to get that man in order is to loose
[2:14:54] him and send him in the wilderness to
[2:14:57] let him dry out and die out.
[2:15:02] Let him feel abandoned.
[2:15:04] Let him feel that God doesn't even care.
[2:15:07] His prayer not even being answered.
[2:15:09] Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Time
[2:15:11] running away and Joseph spending time in
[2:15:13] prison. seeming like seemingless life
[2:15:16] with bottle and baker and chatting and
[2:15:18] vision and whatn not all of a sudden God
[2:15:22] waiting for a certain time all of a
[2:15:24] sudden God give Pharaoh a dream
[2:15:28] hallelujah and Pharaoh tell his wise men
[2:15:29] interpret that dream for me tell me
[2:15:32] about that dream interpret that dream
[2:15:34] and they couldn't do it they said we
[2:15:36] know a man a man named Joseph he's in
[2:15:39] prison but you need to talk to that man
[2:15:42] that is the man that you need to speak
[2:15:44] True. He has a God that could reveal
[2:15:46] secrets and open up stuff that others
[2:15:49] can't open up. He can open that up.
[2:15:51] That's how they send for Joseph. That's
[2:15:53] how they're going to send for you
[2:15:54] because seven thunders utter your voices
[2:15:57] to that group who could hand the word
[2:15:59] dear. They're going to send for you. You
[2:16:01] are Joseph. You are the word rejected.
[2:16:04] That's Joseph. Hallelujah.
[2:16:10] Glory. You know what it is to come from
[2:16:12] prison to power. You know what it is.
[2:16:15] But Joseph made it. Amen. Come from
[2:16:18] prison to power. Oh, blessed be the name
[2:16:21] of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:23] Praise God. So Peter said according to
[2:16:26] the divine power given to us second
[2:16:28] Peter 1:3
[2:16:30] all things that pertain to life and
[2:16:31] godliness through the knowledge of him
[2:16:34] that has called us to glory and virtue
[2:16:36] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[2:16:38] great and precious promises that by
[2:16:41] these ye might be partakers of the
[2:16:43] divine nature having escaped the
[2:16:45] corruption that is in the world true
[2:16:47] lust and start of a man I'm going to
[2:16:49] wrap up in building this monument
[2:16:51] building this statue it starts up with
[2:16:53] faith and virtual knowledge what they
[2:16:55] what does it do they're waiting for the
[2:16:58] headstone which is love for God is love
[2:17:00] and he controls and he is the strength
[2:17:03] of every one of those things watch and
[2:17:06] what is that the Holy Ghost comes down
[2:17:08] through Christ see Holy Spirit is above
[2:17:11] all of this welding this together
[2:17:13] building a perfect church for the
[2:17:15] capstone to cap what's it been done
[2:17:18] again it's manifested through seven
[2:17:19] church agents seven messengers here you
[2:17:22] are seven church agents seven steps God
[2:17:24] building his church is like one person
[2:17:26] into an individual into himself. The
[2:17:28] power of God coming down through this
[2:17:30] welling it together. Therefore the
[2:17:32] Pentecostal people that let out of the
[2:17:34] Lutheran let out the wes and things you
[2:17:37] see they live in this part of the temple
[2:17:39] that's the way but God say I'm going to
[2:17:42] restore and the way God is expecting us
[2:17:44] as individual to grow the way he brought
[2:17:46] the church to grow. Amen. Just as the
[2:17:48] church ages grow we have got to grow.
[2:17:50] The prophet revealed that when you ask
[2:17:52] to get closer to God, what you're
[2:17:54] actually asking is that I want to grow
[2:17:56] in God. Because when you grow, you say,
[2:17:58] "I want to be closer to Lord." God give
[2:17:59] you faith. Amen. I want to be closer to
[2:18:01] you. God give you virtue. Hallelujah.
[2:18:03] God, what happened to you there? You're
[2:18:04] getting closer to knowledge and
[2:18:06] temperance and patience and godliness
[2:18:08] and brotherly kindness. And by the time
[2:18:09] you hit that spirit, you're one with
[2:18:11] him. At that day, you shall know I am in
[2:18:13] the father. He in me and I in you. You
[2:18:15] can't get closer than that. I and my
[2:18:16] father are one. When you see me, you see
[2:18:19] my father. Hallelujah. Because it's not
[2:18:21] me that doeth the works. It's the father
[2:18:22] in me that doeth the works. So it's God
[2:18:24] in you veiled pillar of fire.
[2:18:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All you're
[2:18:29] waiting for is to get back to Eden. Oh,
[2:18:31] the earth can't hold you back no more.
[2:18:33] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. They
[2:18:35] couldn't hold back Jesus. Jesus was a
[2:18:37] powerhouse. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[2:18:39] God. He cast out devils. He raised the
[2:18:40] sick. He healed the dead. He raised the
[2:18:42] dead. Healed the sick. Isn't that right?
[2:18:44] He was a powerhouse. And he gave the
[2:18:46] disciples the same promise. The same
[2:18:47] works I do, you are going to be doing
[2:18:49] also. You are going to be in a
[2:18:50] powerhouse also. Do you believe that?
[2:18:53] Oh, praise God. So when a man possesses
[2:18:56] these virtues, these kind of things,
[2:18:58] then the Holy Ghost comes upon him, no
[2:19:01] matter if you speak in tongues, you
[2:19:02] might impersonate any gift that God get
[2:19:06] music, please. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. All
[2:19:09] right. Come down to
[2:19:11] this. Notice here we go. If God acted
[2:19:16] one time on a certain circumstance and
[2:19:18] if that same circumstance arise again,
[2:19:20] he has got to act the second time like
[2:19:22] he did the first time or he's unjust.
[2:19:25] Now, no matter how bad you are in sin or
[2:19:28] how stupid you may become, he's got to
[2:19:31] act to you like he did that for woman or
[2:19:34] he acted wrong then. Amen. Here we go.
[2:19:36] God's behavior is his person. That's
[2:19:40] right. what he is in his behavior
[2:19:44] declares his person.
[2:19:47] And that's the way you are in your
[2:19:49] behavior. But Anthony, get ready. As we
[2:19:53] want through the lesson, when you spoke
[2:19:55] in tongues, you heard a story. Your life
[2:19:56] speaks so loud. I can't hear your words.
[2:19:59] So whatever you are, you are. The life
[2:20:02] that you live shows what kind of spirit
[2:20:05] is inside of you. Let's bow our heads.
[2:20:07] That's right. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:20:09] Hallelujah. Pray something. Thank you,
[2:20:11] Jesus.
[2:20:13] Oh, I want you to pray right now in your
[2:20:16] own way. Talk to your Lord. Tell him
