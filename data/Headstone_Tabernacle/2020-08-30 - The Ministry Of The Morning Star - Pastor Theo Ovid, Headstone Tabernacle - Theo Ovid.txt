praise from sister janice the son joelle one of the co-workers was tested negative i've tested and came and recovered and he had us to get swabbed and tested and after getting the results of the five days and so on but he is he's um tested negative so he's fine and the families rejoicing praise the name of the lord we thank god for that tonight also i want to appreciate the message uh before but hunting on wednesday night the citizen of god is one of the greatest messengers here preach god bless you my brother uh certainly was tremendously blessed i feel it was timely it was just right it just felt right i know it was the lord so this morning we have three portion scriptures you'd like to read from isaiah chapter 21 i want to read verse 11 to 12. ii peter chapter 1 verse 19 to 21 and there's uh revelation 2 chapter 26 to 29 praise god so reading from isaiah 21 11 the burden of duma he called me out of seer watchman word of the night watchman word of the night the watchman said the moon cometh and the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come in second peter 1 verse 19. we have also a more short of prophecy where until you do dwell that you take he doesn't like the challenge in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not of all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they will move by the holy ghost and our last scripture reading from revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 26 and he will overcome it and keep it my works unto the end to him will i give the power over the nations he shall rule them with a road of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as a receiver of my father and i will give him the morning star he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit see it on the churches let's boil here one more time this place of the evening [Music] heavenly father we thank you for this morning lord and for your love that has been shed to us lord that we could be receive as your sons lord you know the needs of your people lord may you take me out of the way this morning and speak to them steal their hearts by your spirit may you release your spirit today to hearts and lies may there be miracles signs and wonders in their own lives granted lord we wait on you lord have your own way we pray in jesus name we ask it amen [Music] how [Music] my god [Music] one more time you can see where you are [Music] [Music] take your priority [Music] my [Music] may the lord bless you he's so good to be in his presence thank you oh praise the lord so this morning i have a title titled the message this morning is the ministry of the morning star i have an inspiration watchman word of the night another subject overcoming title ministry of the morning star inspiration watchman word of the night and subject overcoming other context scripture i'd like to read from revelation chapter 22 reading from verse 8 and i john saw these things and heard them when i heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then said he to me unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy virgin the prophets and of them which keep the scenes of this book worship god and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let them be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still this verse 11 here this time is at hand this is what it had to known to verse 12 and behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be not talk not talk as his work shall be i am alpha omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city forward outer dogs and sorcerers and humongous and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a lie i jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches and the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come let him that hear it say come let him that that is come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely oh may god bless his word so we are living in such a insight in time and it's a dreadful time and it's still an exciting time because it's what we are long for what we're looking for what all the ages was looking for daniel was seeking to understand more about this day and go to daniel go that way the book is sealed till the time of the end and that book being sealed in the time of the end god meaning that that book will be on seal one and then the prophecy from that book must be unsealed and then the fulfillment of the prophecy that all of that has to come to take place not only the book on seal but is unsealing a prophecy and you cannot see is he still not the scenes of the prophecy of this book so gordon sent a prophet just to bring doctrines teachings and so on it comes to being a prophecy hallelujah i went john the baptist or under the anointing to introduce the messiah when jesus came into the water that very day it changed from the prophet to the prophecy and some point in time it has to change not behold i said you elijah the prophet but what is the prophet's prophecy then we could identify the prophecy for this hour and said this day this scripture is fulfilled when it changes from the prophet to the prophecy or give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god amen and uh we read the scripture of um to him overcome it he will give the morning star and every age had overcomers and every age had rewards hallelujah that remind me he that committed god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so don't take if your mother doesn't want to reward you your father don't reward you the boss the one rewarding you he god is a rewarder of them that diligently energetically passionately or fervently seek him not know halfway business now but those who are on fire to seek him those who are hungry and distant couldn't imagine people drying up no no no not that was the worst time to dry up oh glory to god this is the time to do double duty for the kingdom of god because the devil wants to hold every light oh glory to god but there's going to be some lights that are going to shine in this dark over here oh praise god so every age had overcome us and every age had rewards do you believe that ephesus age revelation 2 7 he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that he might overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is the midst of the paradise of god revelation 2 11 he that had an air let him hear what the spirits say in the churches he that overcome it shall not be heard by the second death all glory to god the second that is for the rest not the elect oh glory to god we believe that pokemon says revelation 2 17 he has on the air let him hear what the spirit see it under the churches to him and overcome it will i give the eat of the hidden manner and will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written which no man know it save and he that received it that's not for everybody that's the hymn that overcome it white stone new name only he that receive it oh glory to god hallelujah know it or give the lord a shout hallelujah praise be to jesus ty tyra age revelation 2 26 and he'll overcome it and keep it my works unto the end to him will i give power over nations and he shall rule him with a rod and i am as the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to shivers as even as i receive my father and i will give him the morning star hallelujah sadist is the fifth age revelation 3 5 he did overcome it the same shall be called in white raiment i will not bloodhole this name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before the angels what a promise what a reward halal number six philadelphia revelation 3 12 he will overcome it will i make a pillar in the temple of my god he shall no more go out i will write upon him the name of my god the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh from heaven upon my god i will write upon him my new name or give the lord some praises and number seven laodicea revelation 3 21 the hymnal overcometh will i grant the separate me in my troll even as i also overcome and i'm settling with my father in his strong all glory to god seven rewards for overcometh hallelujah for jokers for overcomers not for skyrockets overcomers not for slackers over commerce not for church members overcomers not for people who are retired no no overcomers oh and to overcome there must be a test given give the lord a shout wherever you are give the lord some praises now remember each church age the one that precedes it inherit all the other ones all the other rewards so in this age we inherited all seven rewards oh give the lord some praises watch there it is don't receive all these power these new names everything that's written saturday so each age receives so this last age receiving all oh praise god no not him that starts is he that finishes many start the race but there's only one finishing it there will be many churches start many groups of people but there will be one group that finish that's the overcomers are you belonging to that group do you want to be in that group oh god this happened to your family this happened insurance happened to your house it's happened to your car this happened to the job this happened whatever no matter what happen there's gonna be a bunch of overcomers because before god to overcome and talk he put a seed to overcome oh glory to god we believe that hallelujah now the bible talks about seven stars in his right hand seven churches seven messengers isn't that right and the reason that the stars is because it's nighttime he said these seven styles was to reflect the light of his present in the day in the night we are living in the stars reflect the sun to the earth to make it light so we can walk and get around night time now revelation is a book of symbols we understand that and we understand god say seven stars in his right hand and the only reason god used that description is because we are living in a night time in a dark time and isaiah 67 rise and shine for the light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee i like how god addressed the elect first and then he says behold the doctor shall cover the earth and cross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and the glory shall be seen upon me so he put the light has come the glory is risen upon thee then he said that discover the earth but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee so he put the impact first and then shall be processed hallelujah and you'll come back to that same vision that he put in representing in the beginning oh glory to god amen and i believe all this coronavirus darkness covering the earth affecting the entire world no country escaping no people escaping all glory that god is a prelude of what is to come we see clearly now how would be so very easy to shut down the churches like a blink it would happen so smooth hallelujah with no no hassle oh all this is a pre concerto what's coming it's almost like a a child run a dry run oh hallelujah instructions and you have to follow through and this is where it's coming to now oh glory to god who going to stand nobody watching them in the house nobody watching those so-called christian believers what they're doing where they're going what they're listening to what they're reading if they're praying everybody have to examine their own self and not be a christian in your heart in your own house but don't know church remember willing god bless you god bless you no not right now you can't shake your brain can get brother her kindness is a heart oh glory this how it is but the other side we have no virus on that side it's perfect love there oh my precious brother they hugging one another have no virus you can't hug you can't greet you can't shake hand no we have to abide by that because they said respect to no persons pastor prophet bishop don't care who it is this is respected no person if anybody want to challenge it let them feel free to do so but this is no reason this guy isn't respecting anybody but i'm telling you we have a promise that the sons of god going to come forth they're going to stop cancer stop diseases stop whatever the devil want to send do you believe that sons are coming hallelujah oh glory to god and the prophet he was talking about jordan he said let's cross the other side now because it all belongs to us let's quit playing we come along you see what jordan meant he said them visions that never fail they can fail because they come from god and i believe it with all my heart within me we are not the highland that will run back into the wilderness we will cross jordan the separation god break to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this place great place now for joshua divided to the people the inheritance so this dry run or this shadow or this reflection in the old testament was a reflection for us the dry run was from egypt to canaan land that was the journey that was in type that was natural that egypt represent the world and that promised land praise that canaan represent the promise the inheritance the holy ghostland itself isn't that right so it's three things moses brought the people out and joshua had three things to do cross them over jordan fight in the land and divide the land it's simple no complications just three things cross them over you can't fight in the land if they can cross over you have to get across jordan jordan represents debt so there is no debt you cannot get into the land you have to cross this thing called death and death go deeper than just saying death death to your torch your ideas yourself and things will come to kill you that you could cross over into the land when you cross over you feel oh i reach a reach i reach nowhere to reach a fight that's the part that people don't pre-paid for oh i love jesus so it is so sweet every day but jesus is sweeter than the day before you nila no when you're crossing the atlantic tights jebusites and all their nights so he said no watch he said the land was divided by inspiration and each one i'll just skip that a little bit now after you are in here we go that don't mean you are free from war everybody want peace in the valley like someday ain't nothing in line right now like someday there will be peace in the valley for me someday waiting to cross over that but you see here he said that don't mean you're free from war you'll still have to fight here we go for every inch of wrong you stand on that's why i said i don't entitle i'm not entitled to anything i'm entitled to fight and you are entitled to fight also isn't that right see kanan did not represent the great heaven because it had wars and troubles and titans and killings and so forth but it did represent this it must be a perfect walk oh glory to god then he said how can i overcome is i choose this because i think it's time we should never let the spirit of revival die never somebody shout out never in your house you'll never never let the spirit revival die well we don't see it so and we have it so no never let the spirit of revival whether you're talking soft or easy whether you jump for your shelter you sit down you have to have the spirit of revival oh glory to god you said no he said i choose this right never let the spirit rival die because we have got to keep in revival constantly revive every day paul said i die daily that christ should live and we must never let that revival die within us now we are speaking on overcoming and the world overcome of course you know what it means you have to have something to overcome and this church is that the holy spirit was speaking about here at the laureate church age as we have seen through it needs a rebuking allowed israel to be rebuked because of his indifference towards christ they put christ outside now notice his call here is not just to the church he didn't overcome it not the church that would be she the church body it's not he is he that overcome it the individual so you cast out no bunch no group no group at all is he that overcome it bunch a group a bunch of church members they like them or you are individual you have to fight for your portion oh glory to god enoch didn't take his rifle domino he walked with god you know and god took him you know he couldn't take your wife and cheering you know you have to walk with god wait and get translation fate isn't that right hallelujah praise god so it's not group that overcome it is he that overcome it the individual that will overcome some point in time this message was zoning on individuals and all this bunch of church walls and church group thing and all this group thing that ministers trapped the people inside going to bust that down and when the believers the elect begin to recognize it as individuals they're going to something going to change altogether it will be radical it will be completely different oh glory to god hallelujah praise the name of the lord now let's continue and the laodicea the age need a sharp rebuke when our killer she gets so soft and dirty like some grandfather is grandchildren god such a good god until they will try to make god a big dorky grandfather but he is not he's a father of righteousness of correction and love is always corrective love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it still corrects a mother will cross her child oh my they come to a place is real rotten and dirty and that's the way christians are becoming they have been dead in season and trespasses so long till they become dirty they can't hold no wait at all they don't know what overcoming means overcome keeps life in you you can't just have life overcoming that's why when you trip over something when you come alive you have this child this temptation this test is given to press it throw you on your knees it puts you in a desperation it actually keeps life in you what does overcoming does oh glory to god overcoming keeps life in you so if you're drying up and you're dying up you're not overcoming you have to overcome to keep life in you oh hallelujah praise god overcome and keep life in you and when life went out that is what brought the lord to that condition the lord rotten and duty because it had no life in it so afterwards all them bugs all them two mites hallelujah start a bite of them that log it once had life it once was standing tall but it fall to the side once was reading books and tapes sometimes they're dead and they're still reading books sometimes but they're dead because life left you have to get back life he said come that you might have life oh hallelujah praise god oh my and when you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian let the life of god go from him and the experience the joy of serving christ and living in a church where such is going on he rotten twice as quick leave it right under it so when they're dead and they come to church oh god so god have mercy globally your lord is gonna virus for people to come alive they come when they're sitting in church with the flow of the anointing of the dead fire yeah there's water hitting that deadness you know water hitting the they want to carry on they're fighting up with the husband they're fighting i want to tell you your wife is not the enemy your husband is not the enemy your chair is not the enemy your neighbor is not yet the devil is the enemy oh glory to god not your husband not your wife not your children not the pastor hallelujah not this church this year is not seated the devil is fearing me all right the joy of serving christ living in a church where such is going on you're writing twice as far hear this we are trying to follow the message of the hour oh this is probably now or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ because if you don't you layer wrong that and you know these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the bible said he that know what to do good and do it not to him it is sin then you become dirty written when you are separated from the life of god you see this age we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages the loud recent churches is the grandest of all the church ages here's why because it is ending of time and blending into eternity now i know that kind of hard for some people because we live in this modern age where we're looking for things and life and opportunity but friends this age is the greatest age because this is end in time and blending into eternity and here why now and it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than they've ever been and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than in any other age so you know what it is to break past the raised hands and praise god you realize how people perish not literally but the handguard liver they multi give god praise they can't shout they can't worship no joy they're surviving and the holy oh my because the devil is hard so you better thank god for the grace upon your life thank god for the spirit of god upon your life because he put that dear he put praises in your heart a shout in your soul and people can't understand how you're still on fire oh glory to god you're still serving god you're still standing hallelujah praise god hallelujah and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than in any other age back then an early age a christian could for his profession belonging to christ could be headed for it or be killed but and put out of his ministry and go to migo quickly this is the age of life personal life of christ we find here that god has always had overcomers he had overcomers in every always every time in every age there has been an earth god has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness though sometimes just one but somebody overcome nor is there eight people overcome genuine overcomers noah three sons their wives noah and his wife hallelujah and that act he said was not a denomination he says by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and in the domain of the kingdom of god by one spiritual baptism i know that is not emphasized because people join in church in this message but by one spirit we are genuinely baptized into the body and when god puts you into the body there is no pastor bishop deacon apostle prophet could pull you out they could talk they talk but the couple you're out because his spirit put you inside the deal oh glory to god place you inside the deer oh glory to god i met god placed no man could unplease no man could play saying he'll take god to put you inside of there in the body isn't that right no matter how good how bad whatever you are in the kingdom by the holy ghost baptism that's the only way you overcome is all that is under the shed blood is overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it is he that overcomes for you you are resting how will i know then brother branham that i'm in there watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it just lived out of you automatically or you have to strain and pull then you are doing it but don't try to do it did you ever try okay the thing you have to overcome is yourself your ideas your thing surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't in the days of daniel for overcome us we know them she can bend they go and danielle isn't that right now we are expected to be tested that's a good lesson he said he that committed god must first be tested tested that's god's test he said and then do you believe it the coronation said yes he said coming to god must be tested and he only shows a true child is when you are tested when the test comes on you so singing specials and singing someone clapping your hand and singing whatever it is and saying amen hallelujah and shaking you pass a hand that looks nice and so on but he's proof he's a child when he has come not been everybody in the choir and everybody's singing and everybody saying hallelujah and greeting one another and fellowshipping and whatnot when the tests come how you respond to that test isn't that right and that only shows that your child when you are tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you you can't overcome unless it's a test given to you let me say it again you cannot overcome unless it's a test given to you oh glory to god a test given to you not to us to you it's your test it's a personal test no no general test it's your test oh glory to god your test customized for you you can't pick your tests you can't take your paper and take a peek the test coming for you sorry to rejoice right now it's not a thank god for right now because you accounted worthy to receive tests oh hallelujah praise god you can overcome this is the test given to you and when the test is given is to see whether you can overcome or not it has no in between you can't be halfway there is that they overcome it or yeah overcome it i never said that before it's a new one no in between is that they overcome it or yeah overcome it if you haven't overcome it it's just coming again hallelujah praise god amen so jesus said to him not overcome it the test here we go it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you my lord praise god the test we are being tested i am being tested we have to be tested oh glory to god i'm preaching and there's no it's empty seas here and i'm preaching as if praise god is remind me what is it [Laughter] hallelujah preaching to three people oh glory to god hallelujah it wasn't twenty was about three four hallelujah but we preached all the same we preach the word just as if it's a hundred people it's just the word of god isn't that right so the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you i believe it is written in the scripture peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a test and time it's one good evidence to us that god is with us when we are tested not blessed i know that's not a word that will be blessed but when we endure in the test it's a sign that god is with you this happened this happened god just happened when you're taught you escape look something is happening here and you want to know what happened nothing happened wrong it's working out right god arranging for you to overcome god a reason negative victory and the more you overcome he takes it to the next level hallelujah you overcome that you take it to the next level and you overcome that you're taking it to the next level wait wait wait wait you're heading you're going to meet lucifer himself and by the time you get there it's licks like fire oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen because i live you shall live also i overcome hugo overcomes also isn't that right praise gosh is a testament time it's one good evidence to us that god is with us when we are tested for all all children of god are tested and tried oh praise god lot wife she started off as an overcomer but she never did overcome isn't that right we know a heart a heart turn in her isn't that right she let her heart influence her to look back she started off many start but remember who finishing oh glory to god don't just start finish this race i intend to finish by god's grace oh glory to god my what about the children of israel in egypt they started off they saw miracles but bahram says it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome the perish in the wilderness who overcame joshua and caleb they say we are more than able to do it they were overcomers bunch of ministers all in the association a bunch of men behind a pulpit and just just one kill example you're more than able to take this coronal virus on the coronavirus are you okay what press they have out there i don't want tests i don't care what room doing out there rumored to do the business but we ought to do we business too oh glory to god gross darkness cover the earth and gross darkness covering what the people but praise god god said that light could shine and rise upon you or could somebody say amen here this morning oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so they killed joshua and caleb they were the privileged ones hallelujah out of the entire generation they were the privileged ones they were the elected bride that was called over in the promised land joshua and kayla they were on the front line isn't that right and jesus gave us the example how to overcome what did he do humility he gird himself with a towel the very god of heaven humiliated himself we don't want to be humiliated so we stand in arrogance we stand in attitudes we stand in our way where we hold our ground we don't want to say we're sorry we don't want to cry we don't want to oh men don't cry you're crying because you have a heart cause something moving in your spirit in your soul and you could ask god hallelujah so jesus gave us that example jesus told us how to do with humility isn't that right we don't want to be humiliated and that's the reason women don't want their hair to grow out the reason they don't want to dress like they should dress men don't want to it's the same thing they get humiliated but jesus constantly he was greatness i want to say something greatness humiliates itself great humbles itself greatness is humility or praise people don't want to say i am wrong people want to say i'm sorry people don't want to say forgive me and faith is based on forgiveness you can't get very far because all things of god is of faith it's not a material it are people with money and they consider life messed up because money doesn't give character money doesn't change people sometimes it's not even further away because they feel they don't need need god they're too rich to call upon god they have nothing they have no needs because they could get and purchase and buy whatever they want to get but somehow the grim reporters come and look at them and they can't pay off the grim reaper they can't bribe the grim reaper when the grim reaper come they can't say hold that all a billion green people say no i i know my currency i can't buy nothing with that keep your billions for yourself i come for

tested when governments are being rocked and shaken when men had failing for fear they don't know what happened or what's going to take place they don't have the answer but there's a bride on the earth who have the answer because darkness is covering the earth darkness is present more glory to god hallelujah it is nighttime oh glory to god you heard what i said it is night time and god sends some stars to point us to show us the way that we could know to make them steps and he said to him that overcome it i will give the morning star or give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah and that morning star is a testimony that the sun is coming or glory to when that morning star only comes out when it is dark or give the lord a shout they can't get any more inside in the daytime when i get black when they get dark when men are feeling so fear when all kind of things has taken place that's the time you're going to see that morningstar coming out there is going to be a morningstar ministry announcing the sun is coming there's going to be the manifestation of the sons of god and nonsense christ is coming all glory to god no no books we have no books and playing no tapes there's got to be a manifestation of the ministry of the mourning star it's to him that will overcome it there's gonna be a bunch of overcomers overcome church members overcome hypocrites overcome backbiters

eyes lust of the first lesser the flesh the pride of life overcome all of that and stand in this hour somebody gonna overcome if daniel did it you could do it no come true you could come true i don't care what you're going through now but you are going to be overcome you have to be overcomer you have to believe it you have to believe your call to it yes you're in a dire situation yes hell is a wrong you but you are going to overcome oh hallelujah i'm talking about humility bahram says genuine humility not something put on greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be oh my real humility in the presence of the grave you overcome the grave by what by the word and humility hallelujah oh my there's a real man there's one to make your example he defeated everything and overcome it that is my example not some man jesus is the example he he called the example seed son he demonstrated how to live out an act when he washes his feet he says you see what i do you i'm your lord and master you say so no i did that for you do that tell one another no excuses eat humble pie oh hallelujah praise god he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by woman he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by money woman popularity he was tempted after ministry of freedom three thousand next minute is five thousand i know what he do he's getting any word accepted for sake brother follow me not worthy of me people people leave after that you know they take their bread and afterwards they come back again because you take the word and slam it inside of them because they're looking for some general the fight room yeah they're looking for messiah they're looking for opportunities of barabbas to lead them to protest and to march against the the the rome empire jesus said listen hold it hold it hold it my kingdom is not of this world buddha was such a disappointment to all him want to hype him up i know you're feeling excited we are somebody but getting a crowd you see my kingdom is not of this world hallelujah if my kingdom of this world my one will fight for me you come to bring a higher order a higher kingdom oh hallelujah i say you've heard at all times if i am toot for tooth but i say unto you love your enemies oh hallelujah man i break cut last and so to chop this one and chuck you love your enemies this gospel different boy of course it's different it's the life of the word and the life of the word taken into a path a certain walk jesus knew the walk so when he ready to squeeze him he said i was there come you can't touch me because my always not yet come you can say what you want you could do what you want why always not yet come on i want as time comes and i always come now when you're walking in the world hallelujah nobody can take you before time hallelujah hold the bride go go and get tie up and there is no power in the church that makes any sense that makes no sense at all and if there's only power in the church there's got the people on the expectation for that power for that dynamics for that anointing they've got to have a people not people tired holding on they believe a prophet and all who we love and be with him that kind of story not that it takes fear to prolong charity it takes faith to prolong the power when you stand praying for power forgive me so you think the holy spirit which is the dove doesn't see the spirit of forgiveness god tells johnny baptist the one upon whom she dove remaining that's the one that nice brothers come maybe dove just land and take off because you don't know what upon them they're looking like they're looking so saint like they let dove land and just take off but not staying a one-time anointing two-time anointing but when that dove had jesus esteem john said remaining he said i see one john they get no photograph for jesus he ain't gonna know texts and facts and what jesus looking like he said the one whom you see the dove that only looking for the dove remaining that dove remaining on him so i am saying when that brotherly kindness hallelujah when an anointing began to flow down that dove itself oh glory to god hallelujah the love itself coming to remain this is not a natural thing man like your man don't like your man put your mind put you in five women take your old man inviting convention man to your like not that same man doing that you know nice nice pop all again you know like message poops when god put you nobody one time disciples meet some brothers who are not with them cast no devils they're trying to stop him he said jesus should we stop them because they're not with us jesus leave them alone mom said they were jealous because they're not with them leave them [Music] alone leave them alone oh god leave them alone because of god they're going to stand not of god will fall hallelujah because we all like come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be every man had works hallelujah he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by woman he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him overcome means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks a lot of people say there's no devil this is a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are a real devil but you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil and then the same time you must recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you and then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is and that's the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him that is real overcoming when you recognize that oh hallelujah praise be to jesus is not something there hallelujah on the morning star reflect the light and the absence of christ by his power and demonstration the church sheds forth the light in this dark time soon daylight would come oh my hallelujah tank is always the darkest just before the breaking of the day because the light is pressing and dancing the darkness hallelujah so we find out praise god that god has always have watched men that's how they put us up higher above the wall high in a tower to see looking for danger looking for the enemy there are men who are trained in the acts and astrology and whatnot asking them what time is it what what what's been one of the night asking question hold things going up there what are you seeing hallelujah and the scripture you read is so strange watchman one of the night there's a question but the watchman said the morning comet and after that the night watch my name talk about the night you know nobody morning first hallelujah but the night coming you know but the morning comet oh hallelujah the bright getting the word first before that night come on he said the two are non-check will be anointed first then or nothing will get the portion but god gonna anoint the true anointed first then everybody ring will fall on everybody oh give the lord a shout hallelujah the morning comic and so is giants and jamberry's coming with the nighttime and the voodoo business and the witchcraft thing oh hallelujah but there's a morning coming for that bride where god gonna vindicate who is who and the word manifested is light we preached a certain time ago right the word manifested is light when you see it oh glory to god oh could say this way the word made flesh is light hallelujah and whenever the word has become flesh the invisible becomes visible you can't separate it hallelujah just word completion here see nothing no word become flesh then the invisible becomes visible because the word was invisible oh glory to god my god i feel like shouting them the word was invisible until it became flesh and the beginning was the word you couldn't see it and the word was it god you couldn't see it and the word was god you couldn't see it but then when the word become flesh you could see it because i was jesus oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah once that word become flesh you have to see it not talk and see it not explain it see it and the manifestation will be the interpretation because the word becomes flesh oh hallelujah so when this prophecy of the prophet becomes flesh come back and play a tape and tell me press play oh hallelujah read a book or say a quote oh pray i will be the quote hallelujah what the plan will be manifesting oh glory to god that's the problem with the pharisees and the scribes and the sadducees there was plainly tapes but when jesus come they couldn't identify present tense word made flesh oh glory that god they hated the man who was the word now they will hate the word working through the man because the word gonna start to work to the man the word gonna start to work to you because the secret is the word is in the bride and if the word inside are you no devil to take it out because the devil didn't put it in to begin with what he didn't put any cat take out oh give the lord i shout the word is in the bright the word is in me this morning oh hallelujah that word will become flesh oh glory to god hallelujah watchman had to be a trained man he said he had to be trained to know what he was doing for at any distance as soon as they arose the enemy he could detect it he could tell their match you could tell their color you could tell their rank and confirmed just as far as a human and he could see he could see it he was higher than the rest of them for he was trained to know the enemy and god required the whole city at his hand hallelujah the real watchman on the wall who's been in the presence of god if he isn't on the wall he's just supposed to be on the wall the wall may not be hard on the rest of the congregation but if he's a correct watchman god raises him plumb into the spheres that the rest of them never gets to but he watches the flock and god requires it of him the man of god who stands in the presence of god knows god is god and knows god keeps his word and watch god perform himself to do his duty and keep his word then no matter how many and nomination tries to take down he knows the rank and file of the enemy he knows what to tell the congregation a real watchman oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh man this is something that jesus student in my soul out of home with christ he was wounded for transgression he was bruised for all iniquities just assistant of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed what did god do that perfect man a perfect man hallelujah there's only one of them in the world and the one in the world

world if i've been lifted up from the earth i'll draw all men unto me watch those rainbow colors as they reflect john saw him back there the day of redeeming was over hallelujah praise god seven

men seven angels which are several messages our mind could be our message without what you see all messages could be seven angels that we see or you could be seven men that's what you see or it could be seven spirits that we say what are those seven spirits seven men seven messages oh glory to god oh glory to god this is exciting and the message is so simple maintain the complications you know but real simple enough is to get us back in order to go back to eating you know you can't go back to eating with all the spirit that was supposed to be long and eaten because even belong to manifested sons so adam was a son placed in the garden of eden that god prepared for him when adam fell god gave him the boots boot him straight out the garden put angels to god the tree of life now he send them same angels to guide that sons back to the tree of life he's excited about his return he already said in joel i will restore all the years the locus eaten and conquered women caterpillar all his interpretations and message people god god fed up with that now you're going to do a great work of mysterious work that people just wonder oh glory to god because the church had to be rebuilt by the power of the spirit oh glory to god the church has been built a certain way all these years but there's a prophecy hanging over us that the church will be revealed not by might not by power but by my spirit or when the spirit come the anointing of rebuilding those aruba bell for all those who are wellness mountains having made a plane all glory to god fire fire fire by the spirit of god gorgon redeem your soul he could redeem your spirit one more path your body with the fire baptism you're gonna be changed be on our way to the resurrection oh glory to god your soul sealed spirit sealed and now we're sealing for your body oh glory to god the grim reaper just had to test keep us his his sapphire inside has the bright pass through not even death go stop this bride oh glory the goddess brighter going on no ground this bike will be translated change in a moment in a twinkle of an eye when the devil recognized the bride lost that if he lost his bride he'd be so angry hallelujah so upset so angry he would make war with the foolish virgin the remnant of that clot that the sims 3 is cut out the all the pattern because the bride is the pattern and that person's shaped like a pyramid so when god put the pyramid pattern i'm being able to cut that right out whatever it means the remnant so you better take your cutting now oh glory to god the bride will be cutting now oh glory to god guy be honed he used a word called honed shaving long to find a little mini all the little itsy bitsy teeny shaved off hallelujah so don't pull back from your shaving take the curtain want the cotton oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah this whole man seven seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns seven church ages his seven messengers men his seven spirits of god the seven plan caesar redemption he said the seven horns mean seven ages daniel saw the horn mean kingdom and jesus said some fell asleep in the first watch another age another one next watch next age next one plum after the seven watch under the seven watch is when the bride gone come then all of them is awakened isn't that right and the seven ages were the seven horns and the seven churches of seven dispensations of the body of believers like that seven dispensations of the body of believers so when you talk about jesus bride you're not talking about this entire people here you know you talk about the bright from the very beginning we are just the last part of this bride oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me now this bright body this is brought at the bottom and narrows to the top is already made up it's just the final names to be called because this is the call for manifestation and to call the manifestation it has to be called to the full word so the fullness of the word had to come to bring back luke 17 30 suddenly to come to bring full seed back like in the beginning alpha bride that there will be a manifestation of the sons of god because peace and they were manifested sons but the time of the rapture was not yet so they couldn't be changed that the way to go down in the ground but we are here we are in the time to be changed the time is at hand in that filthy filthy still righteous still holy still and manifestations manifested still oh glory to god god changes mind god cannot change his mind people in that book under no circumstance could their name be taken out oh give the lord a shout oh under no circumstance could their name be taken out the book in the book oh glory to god in that book was a book book of redemption blood section seal your name inside of there oh god and to prove that you're going to manifest that overcoming life he said the seven watch so watch the seventh and last one of these seals when they are open is found in revelation the tenth chapter brother knew that the seventh seal when i pulled it back that way i see silence he said whenever it opened you had to go to version 10. could i have returned let me say again the seventh and last one of these seals when they are opened is phone in version 10th chapter so the satan in his balcony watching he sees open one two three following and following fallen god put four anointings to guard and blind them lion anointing ox anointing man anointed eagle anointing and hiding messengers under that anointing so you only see in white horse people right now when he summons we break his silence he can't understand what happening gun russian telling you coming already so when you're looking for things in heaven you're looking for things looking deep in silence but i saw another might come from heaven and all something that's wrong never can hold that you know what he's done this is he said it's impossible for him to know anything about it he clueless something doesn't roar out tonight for the bride exclusive promise guys it'll break together give the bright fate show how to prepare wait till them seven thunders are the voices to that group we're not over emphasizing these things you know these are the promises these are the prophecies he says seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book i am still on the prophecy and the prophecy didn't come by men as men moved by the holy ghost we have a sword hallelujah we have a sword of prophecy today oh glory to god hang in there until that day start a rise in your heart oh glory to god because that star is going to arise in your heart that taste of christ oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus oh my hallelujah who was despite that they are small things they shall rejoice and shall see the plummets in the hand of the rubber bell with those seven they are the eyes of the lord it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see that the eyes of the lord in this instance are men of course they will be anointed men full of the holy ghost for god's ministries and not in the power of men but of the holy ghost putting out scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of god referred to is the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit in the lives of seven men with whom god identifies themselves very closely so i don't take the words from malachi for prophet lightly and i examine any man what he say by what the prophet said and what the scriptures say because when the angel came to the prophet he examined what the angels said by the scriptures that's the only way you could know is the angel from god you can't leave the world that's why disney state had writings on the back side of the book it just says seals it was written in the book it had written in the book but the backside was just sealed with seven seals he said you cannot put things outside because that would be outside the word it was sealed on the back of the book and the seals on the back held the contents of what was inside you'll need to break the seals in the back to see what's on the inside all seven had a break to reveal the entire book and the entire book was the book of names that's why we hear this morning oh glory to god on one day will be set in the book of life and go go send a baptism of fire oh glory to god set in the book of life oh jesus i come as it is written of me in the volume of the book oh this is the book of god he can't break his own law he he operates within his own law oh hallelujah i come as is written of me in the volume of the book oh glory to god no wonder why the psalmist said thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the light unto my part oh glory to god thy word is a lamp under my feet oh but that lamp had to send light that you could know how to walk in this hour oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord press that be the name of the lord we find out those colors and show each one of those colors represents god's purity those colors they're seven natural colors isn't that right and they represent what the motives of god the attitude of god these seven colors represented seven churches seven stars seven angels these colors represent the motive of god so when a man have those colors in him you have the motive of god the objective of god the attitude of god oh hallelujah oh glory to god because that is what these colors represent you don't have the ocean you have a little piece of the ocean you have a little dip you have a little spoonful of the ocean but the contents of that spoon is what is inside the ocean oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah then he said it might be closer than you think it's got me scared i haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he notices that time is over what happens what happens could that be so much brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders devil can't go there he can't touch that listen he can't touch that pyramid he can't go near there the perimeter is capped by the seventh house he don't want the bride to see that the period is cap that means the seven thunders is the capstone itself in revelation and manifestation so for years we're preaching revelation but they have to come into our manifestation oh hallelujah praise god what was jesus the revelation of god and he was the manifestation of god actually he's the mystery of god revealed hallelujah god could reveal himself by the word or goku revealed himself by flesh god gave yourself in power that's how he reveals himself oh heart right now he's revealed by his word but he also reveals have the power even paul said the word that i speak is in power the kingdom is not in word only but in power so you get the word of the kingdom and the power of the kingdom oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god so then he promised in the last days they'll have former un-later in oh glory to god reigning the fallen hard wrong reign have to fall because that's seed in the ground oh give the lord a shout we are god's seed on the cross hidden in loud we share darkness oh glory to god there was darkness covered the earth and god said let there be light oh give the lord a shout go glory to god i'm getting excited hallelujah so we were on the ground we are on the ground right now in the darkness of this world the enemy looking like if there's another church i have another message amen rambling books and things and fighting one another hallelujah not me i don't understand at all hallelujah no i would say no church is my enemy nobody's my enemy they're on their own who want to fight up with me they're on their own i don't know why we're nobody i have some promises to wrestle with and some things to get he said every place you put your foot is yours hallelujah and i put in my face by foot today on the ministry of the morning star and that's only for overcomers oh hallelujah there's not a hand in ministry that's not going on brand and get a printout in a cardboard ministry at this ministry and that ministry no this is christ ministry administrative monster you shall be get that you shall be given that or to him that overcome it oh hallelujah remember the pyramid message it's the capstone what did it do the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when walking slow wrong this one when we added to our fate all seven things virtue knowledge temperance patience gottenness brotherly chemist and the seventh one was love so two faith at certain things which is god that is how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the holy spirit then if that be so with all these types and shadows if that be so what this man have he has got seven two changes that he has seven mysteries that have been sounded away and they fought for to bring back and now the heads don't come to cap that off does the thunders mean that my brethren hallelujah people are still fighting up if they don't necessarily mean that hallelujah so here how is important where we head into with this ministry of the morning star this is by the brown notice lutheran justification wesley signification he said no pentecost to the battle of the ghost the church goes right on to the end of it right out at the end of that here we go that church is going to have to be so perfectly like the ministry of jesus christ till when that stone come it will sit right smack in the groove here say an advanced pentecostal church that's not what he messages he said looter wesley pentecost it have to go further than to be like the ministry of jesus christ what for when the stone come he's gonna set in a groove he said now watch he said no there wasn't spirit filled but they were loyal and held to the creed of their leaders so the leaders were bringing the revelation and they're breaking the mysteries now his ministry this is jesus ministry now was showing up their doctrine he said i want you to be listen to this i want you to be sure to get this they had their cretes and they were great churches great people great men holy men good men gentlemen fine men honorable men men of honor educated smart is that right we all know that just as good as you could find anywhere but when jesus come on his ministry showed up their doctrine because god was proven by the ministry of jesus christ that he was with him oh glory to god isn't that beautiful oh my so when this ministry of jesus christ become to be manifested or let's say born into manifestation it will show up the doctrine of those who are on the letter of the word and teaching all kind of stuff he said we see the evening lights coming the holy spirit coming in so strong in upon his church here we go listen to these words now let's take it slow right here he said we see the even like coming the holy spirit coming in so strong in this church till the ministry of jesus christ is among all of his people they sat there with faith bringing him down powers and gifts working among them speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and signs and wonders and miracles what is it christ among his church getting ready to take up preach a message to those who love his appearance christ appearing among his people before he is coming oh hallelujah we know the bible speaking of appearing before coming there's a great difference between word appearance and then coming he's praying and father we realize that the church has come through the stage of justification come to the stage of sanctification come to the stage of receiving the holy spirit the stones are being honed on for the fitting of the ministry of jesus christ i know some ministers fight me on that but this is it right here the stones are being what honed on for the fitting of the ministry so this is a different level together they're not having church and pastor and you're preaching and you're preaching long trying to work with the people anything like that you know that you know this is our life being crushed and bruised and harnessed and shaped to fit into the ministry of jesus christ to blend right in to take the church we thank thee father we're so glad we can trust in you your word is true it can never fail because you are the word you said heaven others will pass away but my word will never pass away father tonight the opening of this revival i've been speaking lengthy nice group of people no god we are looking for revival we are looking for these there's a short few nights here you will send the fire off the altar these people father great many of them are believers receive the holy spirit the holy spirit would know the word and i pray heavenly father you will confirm it again tonight let it be known that thou art god the time is joined nigh we ask in jesus name oh my hallelujah such a public man he said he gave some apostles and some prophets remember don't try to take an ex-man office some evangelist some pastors some teachers for the perfection of the saints does it read like that the perfection of what who are the saints the sanctified ones the ones from down here perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry and then he says the ministry of jesus christ for the eddie found the body so that work of the ministry is that my ministry is a ministry of jesus christ oh my ezekiel 3 verse 17 says son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me when i say unto the wicked thou shall surely die and thou give us not warning nor speakers to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will require thy hand yet if the war on the wicked and he turned not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy soul again when a righteous man deterred from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumbling block before him and he shall die because thou has not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he had done shall not be remembered but his blood will require at the hand nevertheless if the war on the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he does not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou has delivered thy soul now is the day we are living in and the watchman what of the night oh he said there will be a time like it was in southern gomorrah oh my and he says no it takes the moon shines in the absence of the sun and that's what the church supposed to be reflect the presence of god while the sun is gone or when the sun comes up the moon is gone but just before day you ever notice the moon gets peeled it goes out i'll tell you the church is already to impale it's anemic it's got away from the blood it's got away from salvation and the holy ghost and the teaching of the word it's become anemic you see the sun is approaching and then the darkness of the night just before dawn the sun approaches it's present it's just coming what is it the morning star the church of the living god today who is the watchman on the torah warning the nations and the people it stands alone a man that stands for god stands alone what is he doing he's reflecting the same light that the sun the same ministry the sun went on with the same light he went long in that coming again in the resurrection power that morning star reflecting that light we cry watch man what of the night the morning comet and the night also win at that time the loud reason to change man lukewarm not able to stand the things of god they pull themselves off separating like in the days of noah oh my hallelujah the church light will be reflected in this church and more powerful than ever before the coming of the lord jesus so there is no promise of weakness there's no promise of cooling down and slowing down and it's just getting cold and formal and running from the room and running from the press and hiding and whatnot hello promise at that time is that promise of power and you dealing with the effects of the power of god oh glory to god amen you say i know thy faith you hold my faith now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for james 1 3 said the trine of your faith look at patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the child of our fate romans 3 5 3 tribulation look at patience no highly god regardless of working of our patients you've seen in james 1 4 let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing and then he brought the bomb here god's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development waiting for 50 years waiting for 25 years like abraham waiting for 14 days in the upper room waiting just waiting moses had to wait the israel had to wait you have to wait you're waiting for the time appointed at that set time i will visit you i will come to you oh glory to god equality possess of character development so when you want something and god just gives you like all parents let's give the children whatever they want to keep them quiet make them happy and so on like that god one character oh glory to god god want discipline go in one order and it takes a child of your fate or to produce that oh glory to god you hear what i said and take trials of your faith to make it overcome so it all is a wonderful package that you're seeing here now the hillary overcome it and not being tried what happened that person getting character because the child your faith is what produce any process that you get character development you're not born with character it has to be developed you have to be grown oh glory give the lord praises hallelujah every business have to honed itself especially adapt itself to the conditions are wrong because every day business is changing environment is changing something new coming on and making something null and void make it ineffective and everybody had to be alert as to what is happening here what is happening here what is happening here in order to adjust and to adapt oh glory to god and god put the watchman which is the holy spirit to give a word of warning to give a word to the people that they can adjust and adapt themselves to what is coming an uncommon storm hallelujah cross darkness covenant earth isn't that right hallelujah so god will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god waiting for god this is the process of character development hallelujah praise god how highly god commended these saints of the dark ages patience as lambs let it slaughter lovingly and faithfully to serve god this is all they wanted out of life just service to the lord how great was the reward as the darkness of the age increased here we go as the honor roll of martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they serve all the more and their fate increased that's why i say coronavirus no church come on we don't know what next we don't know what the government said after so much days whatever but i'm saying increase your service to god more double up hallelujah pray pray twice as much as pray press twice as much hallelujah it's dark double up not not like there'll be sappy energy and suck the string you can't take it no take it is that people in the world they're taking it they're not even in church they don't even go to church and they're taking it they're accepting and adjusting and adapting you are you accept and adjust that this would have to live in you whether you're in church or no church pastor or no pastor elder no elder this after living you and that must be your heart desire live in me oh glory to god as the doctors of the age increased as the honor roll of the matches grew lentil day by day they worked all the harder they serve all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age in the darkness of all ages they save them even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of his gracious service of love unto the lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to taught our service to the lord our reply is increased silvers oh give the lord a shout on that one let the enemy try to our service to the lord our reply to the enemy increase service oh glory to god you're sorry you tried to press us because we doubling up oh glory to god increase service when the faints are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory oh glory to god hallelujah i hope you're shouting outside hallelujah when the faints are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory oh glory to god hallelujah i've been saying along there are two churches two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were one here it is plainly stated that they are churches under the states that just as plainly as some of those churches most evidently do not know he is the one who searches the rains and the hearts he is going to prove to them that is so now when what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it will be the false vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins in the house of god and they being god-fearing judged themselves that they not be judged now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine you hear he that he let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches he's talking to two groups he's talking to the two vines that why we could play tapes every single day we'll always have two groups two fights i just leave the other vine leave them alone leave the other mine alone other words a false vine could never become a true vein that's the bottom line and the true vine can become false oh hallelujah why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false mind the truth of the matter is that they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 7 whole beat and vein do they worship me teaching the doctrines of commandments of men but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a muhammadan is a muhammadan that is a religion no matter how he lives because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin crucified rose again and he's a savior of mankind et cetera so in this age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus but he's not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believer is one who has been baptized the true believer into the body of christ and is a member it is god's order the tears grow up with the wheat and they are not be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group one on the other hand is praising the other one he's rebuking he has told what is right or with a true believer and now he warns the false vine what must do and what must be to stand justified before the lord so what god does god look at the heart this is beautiful that has never changed neither will it ever change all through the ages there are two groups brought proclaiming their revelation from god and their relationship to god nevertheless the foundation standeth sure the lord knowed them that are his the lord search at the reins and the word search means to track or follow up god tracks down our thoughts reigns he knows what's in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is out of the heart that precede righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes are all known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought into judgment when they are conquering for our lives is given there is no fear of god before the false vine and dearly shall they pee that all who name his name so live has become its saints oh praise god hallelujah glory to god the pressure of the dark ages was either either bend or be broken bow or die it was the inquisition the power of the empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay for it with your life each age has its pressures here we go each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living nervous tensions in the complex age we seem unfitted to living now the pressure at this age you had any prejudices riches soft living nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem to live in oh my hallelujah i want to skip this over he didn't overcome it but keep my works and i will give him the morning star according to revelation 22 16 jesus peter 1 19 jesus is the morning star i am root an offspring of david the bright and morning star and he tithed when peter until the day dawn and the days that arise in your hearts the spirit is therefore making a promise to the elect of the dark ages relative to himself and then in ages to come so because it's dark ages he's making a promise to them of the mourning star oh hallelujah have we already stated jesus identify himself with the messengers of each age they receive from him the revelation on the word for each period this word revelation brings the elect of god out of the world and into full union with jesus christ these messengers are called stars because they shine with a borrowed or reflected light of the sun even jesus they're also called stars because they're holders of light at night thus in the darkness of sin they bring light of god to his people this is the dark ages it's especially dark for the word of the lord is almost entirely hidden from the people knowledge of the most high or almost ceased debt has overcome vast numbers of believers until their ranks are decimated the things of god are at the lowest ed to date it seemed like satan would surely conquer god's people if ever a people need a promise embracing the land where it has no night it was the people of the dark ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star he is telling them the chief star even jesus who dwell it in light unto which no man can approach will in the future kingdom illuminate them with his personal presence in the morning star is what is visible when the night on the light of the sun commenced to shine i want to skip downhill praise the name of the lord hallelujah look at the darkness covering the earth oh praise now what what god promised dark earthquakes and that was rumors are worse isn't that right and a big darkness coming three and a half years of tribulation three years a tribulation period isn't that right that is coming also that is that is night coming oh glory to god but i miss all of that he promised a church on fire a church that will have mechanics and dynamics a church that will have the ministry of jesus christ hallelujah reflecting what the uncommon soul he said once more the world will hear direct from god because that bride will be the final voice to the final age final voice of warning oh glory to god hallelujah praise god we're on the home stretch hallelujah we see fearful sights earthquakes tidal waves falling gross darkness heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures but he promised that there would be later rain in the church the church spiritual in the last days he will pour both former and later in remember former rain comes first later in comes second both former and lattering in the same season what he's saying while peter speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word as the word going forth mechanics here come the holy spirit dynamics that's what we're talking about your family coming getting word and spirit oh glory to god people getting born again by word and spirit oh glory to god again that double a double one time hallelujah praise the name of the lord give the lord some praises hallelujah you labor in long time looking for the same penny same pay it's coming it's coming it's coming same penny same pay same sign same wonders say miracles hallelujah praise god notice they waited for the holy ghost but after that they didn't wait nowhere oh glory to god he went to the house of cornelius preaching the word and duncan the holy ghost hallelujah praise god what you think will happen when god send dynamics again oh glory to god and have some sons

in the morning first and he will get to the night after oh glory to god what's my word of the night and when he said what's wrong with the night he said we have a watchman and a watchman that climbed the ramparts of glory the holy spirit was sent back to tower and the men and women who believed god that's the watchman the holy spirit sent to us as a watchman to watch over us he's our guardian the holy spirit wasn't sent to lead man to be a watchman or he said the holy spirit was sent to lead man to be a watchman over our souls and man wasn't to watch over one another it was the holy spirit to watch over us he's our tutor our teacher the holy spirit is to teach then we crowd require to the holy spirit watch man what is the night and he just says the morning comet and the night also no he said to the natural men he said now he's saying to the church there'll be latter rain and the rain will fall in the last days we have had a latter rain what taking place first it begins to break day and before it breaks day then i get darkest so brother brahm came it shall be light in the evening time and he shines some light and then baram left and then forced anointed jump on the horse that arrived and then god bless seven thunders across the world what for to gather bright together to show our right how to be pure what it is for to get a brighter position oh glory to god is dark with

claim you know there's nobody challenging conor virus yes you know what he probably said all them false prophets have they say nothing they can't say prunes all them looking for money and do this and all kinds of things they can't say nothing about this hallelujah oh yes you see god holds the key god alone holy key to revelation that was he is suffering he could reveal to whomsoever you will he could deliver you tonight you listen right now god could deliver you right in your room right in your house what could deliver you and free you and heal you and set you free and give you miracles in your life right now i believe that because he be on walls oh glory to god he goes beyond walls and say peace be unto you pass through walls he could pass through your wall hallelujah no distance is too far for him no country is too far for him to reach and deliver souls and lies there's a bride and there's one spirit to release the candidate right together it's not just the revelation you know the revelation is the platform that that's god see dung the bride with the word in the bride and when to have the word inside of there he could lose a spirit like a current oh like a great magnetism inside the people that's what the word is you know activate the magnet inside of you and then only you could communicate to god satan have nothing he can interrupt that he can hack that that is hack proof or give the lord a shout glory to god that is hack proof the devil can hack that line of communication between you and your father oh glory to god i will return unto my father hallelujah i'm

night and it breaks day watch in the morning it starts breaking day then it'll get dark day first then dark then it breaks d but first is day and then night and then the breaking of the day remember what happened just before the coming of day when the dark time comes the mornings that comes out it is the brightest tiny heaven is the morningstar don't miss this now the mornings that comes out just between that light spell and the re-breaking of day as soon as it gets real back just before the break of day the morningstar shines its brightest what's this doing reflecting the light of the uncommon sun do you get it oh hallelujah science says the reason gets so dark is because the light is pressing the darkness it is congealing together that's what makes it dark isn't that right the uncommon light who is the light of the world jesus not some united nations or program of the world he said he's the morning star let's go over to revelation jesus said himself he'll overcome it will i

darkness here overcomes will i give the morning star what's the monastery set therefore to reflect the sun coming oh glory to god every single reflection the son of a long way coming but when we see the reflection which is the perfection did you hear that the reflection is the perfection then he said the ministry has come to his perfection when christ is reproduced in the natural i will never forget that quote but as long as i live it's engraved in my heart the ministry has reached its perfection when christ is reproduced in the natural that have nothing to do with a sermon that have nothing to do with some sermon and some message and some preaching that has to do with a life thundering and the devil's shaking because christ has been reproduced and the devil get blown as before and if you see jesus you know to take off again oh give the lord a shout of feeling good now hallelujah jesus slapped him up in the wilderness before already and he went and rest by season and if you
