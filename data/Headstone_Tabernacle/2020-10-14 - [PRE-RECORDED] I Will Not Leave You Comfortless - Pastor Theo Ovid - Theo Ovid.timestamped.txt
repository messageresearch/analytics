[16:28] those connected to us on the internet
[16:30] and we're so happy to be here to have
[16:32] this sunday fellowship
[16:34] around god's word so it's in john
[16:36] chapter 14 we want to read
[16:38] verse 14 to 21 also first john chapter 2
[16:42] from verse 15 to 17 and hebrews 10
[16:46] verse 1 to 10.
[16:50] praise the lord readings in john 14
[16:53] 14 to 21.
[16:59] if he shall ask anything in my name i
[17:01] will do it
[17:02] if you love me keep my commandments and
[17:05] i will pray the father that he will give
[17:07] shall give you another comforter
[17:09] that he may abide with you forever even
[17:11] the spirit of truth
[17:12] whom the world cannot receive because it
[17:15] seet him not
[17:16] neither annoyed him but you know him for
[17:19] he dwelleth
[17:20] with you and shall be in you
[17:24] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[17:27] come to you

[17:35] at that day he shall know that i am in
[17:38] my father
[17:39] ye and me and i knew he that had my

[17:50] myself
[17:52] to him first john 2
[17:56] reading verse 15.
[18:00] 17.
[18:05] love not the world neither the things
[18:07] that are in the world
[18:09] if any man love the world the love of
[18:11] the father
[18:12] is not in him for all that is in the
[18:14] world
[18:15] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[18:17] eyes and the pride of life
[18:19] is not of the father but is of the world
[18:24] and the world pass it away and the lust
[18:26] thereof
[18:27] but he that do it the will of god abide
[18:30] it
[18:31] forever in our last scriptures from
[18:33] hebrews chapter 10
[18:35] for the law having a shadow of good
[18:37] things to come and not the very image of
[18:39] the things
[18:40] can never with those sacrifices which
[18:42] they offered year by year
[18:44] continually make the comments their own
[18:46] to perfect
[18:48] for them would they not have ceased to
[18:50] be offered because the worshiper once
[18:52] purged
[18:53] should have had no more conscious of
[18:55] sins but in those sacrifices there is a
[18:58] remembrance again made of sins every
[19:00] year
[19:01] for it is not possible that the blood of
[19:03] birds and goats should take away sins
[19:05] wherefore when he commits into the world
[19:07] he says sacrifice and offering that what
[19:08] is not
[19:09] but a body has now prepared me in burned
[19:12] offerings and sacrifices for sin
[19:14] that was had no pleasure then i said i
[19:16] lo i
[19:17] come in the volume of the book it is
[19:20] written of me
[19:21] to do thy will oh god praise the name of
[19:25] the lord hold on
[19:26] praise god above when he said sacrifice
[19:29] an offering and burnt offering and
[19:30] offering for sin
[19:31] thou would has not neither had pleasure
[19:33] thereon
[19:34] which are offered by the law then he
[19:36] said lo i come to do
[19:38] thy will oh god he taketh away the first
[19:41] that he may establish a second
[19:43] by the which will will will we are
[19:45] sanctified to the offering of the body
[19:47] of jesus christ
[19:48] once and for all may god bless his word
[19:50] you may be seated
[19:52] oh praise god thank you lord jesus
[19:56] oh blessed be the name of the lord it's
[20:00] so good to be here this morning
[20:02] and to feel the presence of the lord
[20:05] this morning have a title i will not

[20:09] you comfortless and an inspiration i
[20:11] come to do thy will
[20:13] oh praise the name of the lord you have
[20:15] to have a desire
[20:16] for the will of god but imam was praying
[20:18] saying dear god we are grateful people
[20:19] this morning
[20:20] yet lord we are living in a dark world
[20:22] there isn't one of us here this morning
[20:24] father that what
[20:25] feels we want a closer walk with you we
[20:27] want that touch of you in our lives
[20:29] that can tender us and make us flexible
[20:32] so you can
[20:33] change us at any time if you're stiff
[20:37] and starchy he can't bend you and twist
[20:38] you because
[20:39] you're on your own hallelujah here's a
[20:42] big shot in your own self
[20:44] see but he asking that god could tend us
[20:46] that he could change us makes us
[20:48] flexible this is a beautiful thing watch
[20:51] watch so you can change us at any time
[20:53] mold us into sons and daughters of god
[20:56] you're not
[20:57] instant sons you are molded shaped
[21:00] conformed transformed something have to
[21:03] happen upon your life

[21:42] oh god because the word is god oh same
[21:45] as somebody
[21:46] we have truth for you this morning

[21:50] not fooling the wrong truth o glory to
[21:54] god hallelujah and jesus said you shall
[21:55] know the truth
[21:57] and the truth we're going to set you
[21:58] free how many want to be free this
[22:00] morning
[22:02] free from the limitations of your five
[22:04] senses
[22:05] to break out at your prison you're in
[22:07] prison you're in prison of five senses
[22:10] jesus was not in that prison and he came
[22:13] to bring sons out to prison
[22:15] he came to set the captive free oh glory
[22:18] to god
[22:19] so you are not limited to joy and
[22:20] happiness that's that's temporary stuff
[22:23] oh glory to god and that you're feeling
[22:25] good one day and i'm feeling so good
[22:27] forget that you are in christ you're in
[22:29] the word
[22:30] you are fine you're gonna come true
[22:34] some to the waters some through the
[22:37] flood
[22:38] sanctuary trials all through the blood
[22:43] oh glory that you have to believe that
[22:46] glory to god hallelujah if all you have
[22:49] to believe is based upon your eyes
[22:51] then we don't need faith because faith
[22:54] is the substance
[22:55] of what you're hoping for faith is the
[22:58] evidence
[22:59] of what you're not seeing oh glory to
[23:01] god you may be seated praise as we said
[23:04] and we keep saying till it's stick jesus
[23:07] sold five thousand
[23:09] and there was a little boy with five
[23:10] loaves and two fishes and that did not
[23:13] intimidate jesus
[23:14] jesus because he was out of that prison
[23:17] of five
[23:17] senses could see those five thousand
[23:20] people being fed
[23:21] because all things are possible
[23:24] to them to them
[23:29] to them do i hear a shout in the house
[23:37] [Applause]
[23:39] i don't know about you but i come here

[23:50] i come to do what has never been done
[23:52] before
[23:58] it may be seasoned occupying a church
[24:01] bench is normal
[24:03] sitting is normal this coming same name
[24:05] and that's normal
[24:06] but when you want to break out you're
[24:08] looking to go beyond normal
[24:10] but i'm going to say when revolution
[24:12] strikes you behave unnormally
[24:16] get a bf different revelation brings
[24:19] stimulation
[24:20] revelation brings excitement revelation
[24:23] brings joy

[29:42] [Applause]
[29:50] many of you are too casual about the
[29:53] things of god
[29:56] in the time of israel it got so casual
[29:58] that people started telling your
[29:59] neighbor this is where you go
[30:00] off alarm for me
[30:03] isn't going for the self when you go
[30:06] you identify with the lamb
[30:09] because the lamb was taken as a sin
[30:11] offering for you
[30:13] so you have to put your hand on the lamb
[30:15] or when the priest kill it
[30:17] and the life leave it you know is you
[30:19] were supposed to be killed but the lamb
[30:22] took your place
[30:24] so you feel identified it was a serious
[30:27] thing
[30:28] once a year the high priest had to go in
[30:30] and israel under attention biting their
[30:32] nails
[30:33] to want to know if god forgive them now
[30:35] remember it was no joke eating there was
[30:37] no text on scripture in that sense you
[30:38] know
[30:39] it was pillar fire by night when people
[30:42] look up they see a fire all day

[50:42] he chooses his person by his
[50:44] foreknowledge he said in romans
[50:46] that the election of god might stand
[50:48] unsure that eastern jacob both born of
[50:50] holy parents
[50:51] twins and his election might stand true
[50:53] and sure he's a hit he saw
[50:55] and i love jacob before either the boy
[50:58] was born
[51:03] so this kink in eternity called time
[51:08] right now that give god the opportunity
[51:11] to display some of his attributes he
[51:13] could not have displayed
[51:15] in this thing called time time of a
[51:18] beginning
[51:19] therefore time has an ending this thing
[51:21] called time
[51:23] [Applause]
[51:26] it's a deception i'll call it the time
[51:29] deception
[51:31] and i think you have time and you don't
[51:32] have it
[51:34] when time runs out so jesus god
[51:38] god himself couldn't stay in eternity he
[51:40] had to come down in a body called time
[51:41] that body called jesus sit down on the
[51:43] earth because it had a kingsman to
[51:45] redeem us
[51:46] one like us so he could because an angel
[51:49] injury sin those are their sin
[51:50] the others get kicked out them is
[51:52] trouble guys and them trouble guys
[51:54] falling upon the earth
[51:56] the battle of angel becoming a battle of
[51:57] men so we have issues here on the earth
[51:58] now because of them falling into the
[52:00] spirit
[52:01] but not all fell and those that did not
[52:04] fall represented
[52:05] us because we were nothing back there
[52:07] yet
[52:08] we were just in a gene taught inside of
[52:10] there and that gene thought is what
[52:12] inside of you as a seed
[52:14] so god put that in your soul so i don't
[52:16] care where you were here to find you
[52:18] you could be hindu muslim baptist
[52:20] methodist your witness it doesn't matter
[52:22] wants that seed inside of there god had
[52:24] to find you
[52:25] because all that the father had passed
[52:27] and has given me will come
[52:28] so god had to give you to him before
[52:31] when before he had a child
[52:32] before you had trouble before the
[52:34] foundation of the world you were chosen
[52:35] in him you're not hearing me this
[52:38] morning
[52:39] when were you chosen before when were
[52:42] you chosen before
[52:43] your chosen way in him to be in him
[52:47] therefore he was chosen before you have
[52:48] to go back into him
[52:50] oh glory to god you are going to go back
[52:52] into him
[52:53] [Applause]
[52:57] glory so because of the sin because of
[53:00] the fall
[53:01] we felt trapped the five senses lost the
[53:03] sixth sense
[53:05] sense of god hallelujah
[53:08] cell phone bright and shiny but not
[53:10] activated
[53:11] commit no calls play games on it
[53:15] calculate things on it connect with
[53:17] wi-fi on it
[53:18] but you can't make no call because it's
[53:20] not activated
[53:22] oh hallelujah when it's activated you
[53:24] could receive and you can make calls
[53:26] so god want to make you an activated son
[53:29] where you could receive and make calls
[53:31] you could call for help i look under the
[53:34] hill someone come in my help

[53:46] that samson never move gates before
[53:49] who tell them do that you can't close a
[53:51] gate on sons of god
[53:52] when the words say thy seed shall
[53:55] possess the gates of the enemy
[53:57] you don't do that you're looking for
[53:59] trouble you're looking for us to break a
[54:00] record you're looking for us to go for
[54:02] beyond goal

[54:19] call a goliath
[54:20] without a sword and say i'll cut your
[54:23] head off
[54:24] when the spirit comes all we have to
[54:26] press for the spirit
[54:27] press to be in the spirit press to be
[54:29] under the spirit
[54:31] [Music]

[54:55] you are defining it and saying i am
[54:57] strong
[54:59] and don't come the angels to give you
[55:01] the strength because you're confessing
[55:03] something supernatural
[55:04] you're confessing what god has said
[55:09] you're not lying the scripture says let
[55:12] the weak say
[55:14] you have to speak it
[55:20] [Applause]

[1:04:06] that anoints yourself to say son stand
[1:04:08] still this is that god
[1:04:12] [Applause]
[1:04:20] steven give a trip but let us even give
[1:04:21] a tremendous rotation and promising
[1:04:24] on tuesday night we heard a scripture of
[1:04:26] jesus going
[1:04:27] and a weird woman lost her only son her
[1:04:30] son was dead
[1:04:31] and jesus said her compassion compassion
[1:04:35] and he went and touched the power and
[1:04:37] present the son back to the woman
[1:04:40] amen amen
[1:04:44] just discover something about iq and eq
[1:04:47] iq is what intelligent question to the
[1:04:50] college
[1:04:51] eq is emotional quotient people are
[1:04:54] blending iq they have high their brains
[1:04:55] high they could calculate a set of stuff
[1:04:56] and whatnot
[1:04:57] but sometimes have people with high iq
[1:04:59] on low eq
[1:05:03] low and emotional response
[1:05:06] low in emotional compassion they are
[1:05:09] self-centered and selfish
[1:05:12] because having compassion means that you
[1:05:13] could actually step into somebody's
[1:05:15] shoes
[1:05:17] when brown was in india and they was
[1:05:18] worshipping his son and so on
[1:05:20] and in a man came up to him and he's
[1:05:22] blind and he had no shoes on the first
[1:05:24] thing but ram did was to measure his
[1:05:26] shoes to see if he could give the man
[1:05:27] his shoes
[1:05:30] so he had a high eq
[1:05:34] the feel for people
[1:05:39] you said that's why you have to enter in
[1:05:40] so i recognize people with law thank god
[1:05:42] they give them no healing
[1:05:42] for that oh my god you have no
[1:05:46] compassion for healing
[1:05:47] jesus amen next
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:58] have to have that compassion there's a
[1:06:00] woman we talked this story before
[1:06:02] she was sitting next to a woman and she
[1:06:04] had a child that was sick
[1:06:05] and the woman next to her just felt like
[1:06:07] to pray for the baby she said can i pray
[1:06:08] for your child
[1:06:09] you know and she prayed for the child
[1:06:12] she had a prayer card she came up to the
[1:06:14] platform to brother branham
[1:06:15] and byram says uh a woman next to you
[1:06:18] pray for your child the child is healed
[1:06:20] he said god so that one had more
[1:06:21] compassion than me
[1:06:25] god saw you had more compassion and put
[1:06:28] it upon that woman to pray you
[1:06:30] see what it is being able to put
[1:06:32] yourself in the person's place
[1:06:35] on the matter
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:44] jesus saw this with a woman she already
[1:06:47] lost her husband
[1:06:48] no she lost her only son he had
[1:06:50] compassion
[1:06:52] no talk did you drink last night woman
[1:06:59] all this kind of thing people trying to
[1:07:00] know and with purpose i i never see just
[1:07:02] interview people you all been healing
[1:07:04] them you know
[1:07:06] all you said my faith had made the look
[1:07:08] look the lepers
[1:07:09] god know what them fellows doing all the
[1:07:11] time
[1:07:17] good thing good thing there come and
[1:07:19] silly hands you don't touch lepers
[1:07:21] he says he said go and cheer yourself to
[1:07:23] the priest keep on walking brothers
[1:07:25] keep on walking while they were going
[1:07:28] they recognized they were healed simple
[1:07:31] they never reached the priest
[1:07:33] one came back out and now he said
[1:07:35] where'd he rest
[1:07:36] he said your feet made you
[1:07:40] that's why there are people with seeds
[1:07:41] in them amen and they are the one god
[1:07:43] gonna baptize
[1:07:44] but the holy ghost because they have
[1:07:46] something in them
[1:07:48] you see the rest then what they went and
[1:07:49] drink to celebrate that they get healed
[1:07:51] but this one come back to worship this
[1:07:53] one come back to give god praise
[1:07:55] this one had something inside of them
[1:07:57] and i'm telling you if you have
[1:07:58] something inside of you you're going to
[1:07:59] get the right response
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] the woman at the well she had something
[1:08:05] in her
[1:08:06] that she didn't even know her neighbors
[1:08:09] didn't even know
[1:08:10] she was doing a prostitution business
[1:08:11] and living all kind of life why
[1:08:13] because brahm said listen listen the
[1:08:15] prophet by vision i believe
[1:08:17] he said the woman had nobody else to
[1:08:18] help the feeder family
[1:08:20] so she was living a certain way to minor
[1:08:21] children so he went in the spirit realm
[1:08:24] he could see that but god saw something
[1:08:26] beyond that
[1:08:27] he saw a scene in that woman that needed
[1:08:29] to be unfolded
[1:08:31] that one woman was a genuine daughter of
[1:08:32] god we asked what the neighbors and the
[1:08:34] people say
[1:08:35] if you go by what the people say you
[1:08:36] wouldn't see you'll feel this way in
[1:08:37] that way but when
[1:08:38] jesus saw the woman hallelujah
[1:08:41] and he revealed himself that i that
[1:08:43] speak unto you am he
[1:08:45] she was so free she ran she didn't walk
[1:08:48] she ran
[1:08:50] come see her man you told me all that i
[1:08:53] did
[1:08:54] that seed come to life that something
[1:08:57] sparked inside of her
[1:08:58] and i trusted it something on a spark
[1:09:00] inside of you that you know that
[1:09:02] somebody
[1:09:02] and your father dragged inside of here
[1:09:04] and your mother pulled you and you don't
[1:09:06] want to be in service today
[1:09:07] but you're struggling because you have
[1:09:08] no choice
[1:09:12] you have a choice to serve god i don't
[1:09:15] serve god
[1:09:17] hallelujah i had a choice at age 17 i
[1:09:19] give my heart to the lord
[1:09:20] i made a choice and never looked back
[1:09:24] oh glory to god you are a choice today
[1:09:27] to break out

[1:09:48] god's will is his purpose for your life
[1:09:52] you may be seated and the god's will is
[1:09:54] customized
[1:09:56] it's not for every is is not the same
[1:09:58] will for you with somebody else
[1:09:59] got a bit customized for you because god
[1:10:02] knows your form
[1:10:03] and your shape and god know your
[1:10:05] condition so you know what you have to
[1:10:07] do
[1:10:08] oh glory to god amen praise
[1:10:11] god my lord my lord my lord
[1:10:15] father help me jesus oh my so the church
[1:10:18] had the keys but not really
[1:10:20] amen god holy keys but iran says that's
[1:10:22] why after
[1:10:23] judas fell that they get somebody to
[1:10:25] replace judas and the church
[1:10:27] by the turning their key they went and
[1:10:29] choose a man called matthias
[1:10:30] and that was the elected one i guess the
[1:10:32] body cast votes and say bara matas
[1:10:34] fine brother but god choose a little
[1:10:37] hook no sarcastic high temper jew
[1:10:39] named paul to be number 12. oh praise
[1:10:44] the name of the lord
[1:10:46] isn't that right and that man paul that
[1:10:49] was saul
[1:10:50] turned to paul he wasn't easy you know
[1:10:52] that tough guy
[1:10:54] persecuting christians right so from the
[1:10:56] five senses you saying not that man he
[1:10:57] can't get convicted he can't get changed
[1:10:59] he finished shock
[1:11:03] that people like to say shock it i just
[1:11:07] love
[1:11:07] i give them a shock experience like
[1:11:09] explosive who is shocking receipt
[1:11:11] but paul was a seed oh hallelujah
[1:11:15] disguise in whatever form he was in puts
[1:11:18] it in the church so you cannot know what
[1:11:20] god disguises he does
[1:11:22] so you have to treat people with respect
[1:11:23] and treat people with dignity and
[1:11:25] treat people with kindness you don't
[1:11:27] know what seed is behind me
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:29] two people like all of them are seeds of
[1:11:31] god because you don't know but saul
[1:11:33] became poor
[1:11:34] and a personal prophet isn't that right
[1:11:36] so he's talking about david
[1:11:38] and david now got excited to bring back
[1:11:40] the ark and he consult his men and
[1:11:42] consult the people and everything else
[1:11:44] but nathan was the prophet of that age
[1:11:46] and the revelation
[1:11:47] didn't come to david the revelation come
[1:11:49] to david but david never consulted natan
[1:11:51] isn't that right
[1:11:52] so then he wasn't ordained to do that
[1:11:55] david being inspired watch and the
[1:11:58] spirit can come and anoint the person
[1:12:00] and still it's out of the will of god so
[1:12:02] it's prove
[1:12:03] we have to we have to go through god's
[1:12:05] ways not our way
[1:12:06] it is god's way of doing it here is why
[1:12:10] watch now how close it gets that razor
[1:12:13] edge now between right and wrong
[1:12:14] remember it will fall on one or the
[1:12:17] other side
[1:12:18] till it come down to a honed razor
[1:12:21] between the difference
[1:12:22] between right and wrong it's got to be
[1:12:25] every word oh hallelujah praise god
[1:12:29] we are not living in a pentecostal age
[1:12:31] now we're living in a wood age
[1:12:34] where everything had to be examined by
[1:12:35] the word so when you hear me say we're
[1:12:37] checking out man and angel be serious
[1:12:39] about that
[1:12:40] men could claim whatever they want to
[1:12:42] claim but when we say bring it and come
[1:12:44] let me check it out they backing out see
[1:12:46] because this has to be the word
[1:12:48] so listen sin is rejecting the revealed
[1:12:53] will of god
[1:12:55] that's what sin is rejecting
[1:12:58] the revealed will of god as we say we
[1:13:00] are born in sin we are sinners so when
[1:13:02] we sin
[1:13:02] that was in us do sin or sin
[1:13:06] that is not the issue with god because
[1:13:08] we were born in sin shape and negative
[1:13:09] we're born contaminated
[1:13:11] that is what we will do that's normal
[1:13:13] the thing with god
[1:13:15] is failing to come out of your sin
[1:13:18] or failing to come out of that unbelief
[1:13:20] when a way is made for you
[1:13:22] that's the difference your behavior is
[1:13:24] understandable
[1:13:25] because of your how you were born but
[1:13:28] when the word comes to say listen this
[1:13:30] away forever you know
[1:13:31] it's clear you need to repent you need
[1:13:33] to get things in order
[1:13:34] and god going to truly bless you he will
[1:13:36] dispatch angel to escort you
[1:13:38] he would help you he would minister to
[1:13:40] you and you turn that down
[1:13:42] that is sin the true sense so sin is
[1:13:45] rejecting
[1:13:46] the reveal will of god sin in its
[1:13:47] initial form is to reject
[1:13:50] the revealed word of god god's will the
[1:13:52] will of god
[1:13:53] when god has revealed something on his
[1:13:55] will to reject that is to blaspheme
[1:13:58] or to reject god and a church
[1:14:01] would fail at and never will a church
[1:14:03] fail
[1:14:04] never will a program feel as long as
[1:14:06] those who are in charge
[1:14:08] stay in the center of god's will god's
[1:14:11] will is perfect
[1:14:12] and everything will fall right into its
[1:14:14] place if you stay in god's will
[1:14:17] but get out of there will it will throw
[1:14:19] the whole program off
[1:14:20] remember akan's wedge you have to move
[1:14:22] out of one place
[1:14:24] and praise the name of the lord let's
[1:14:26] continue from adoption the
[1:14:28] mystery of israel now remember now it is
[1:14:30] not just a little thing
[1:14:32] it's a mystery god's will
[1:14:35] is a mystery and each man here we go
[1:14:39] has to seek out the will of god for his
[1:14:41] or herself
[1:14:43] so when you seek that out then you get a
[1:14:45] sense of purpose then you don't want to
[1:14:46] commit suicide
[1:14:48] you don't want to give up you don't want
[1:14:49] to let go god i feel frustrated
[1:14:51] and i'm fed up i can't take it no more
[1:14:53] you will come out to that
[1:14:55] because you'll connect to romans 8 20
[1:14:56] all things work together for good
[1:15:00] you want to go to heaven to escape your
[1:15:02] trials down here oh god bring heaven
[1:15:03] quick
[1:15:04] heaven quick
[1:15:07] that'd be my mid-1977 you know in a
[1:15:10] minister's conference or
[1:15:11] brothers and things like that i brought
[1:15:13] her up and say you know he was taught me
[1:15:14] all long story in the millennium and i
[1:15:16] watching this little brothers
[1:15:18] and i was astonished at that time my
[1:15:20] mother be about maybe 18
[1:15:22] 19 years old and i asked myself what is
[1:15:25] he talking about
[1:15:26] because the books i read so far has so
[1:15:28] much promises that
[1:15:29] has not yet been fulfilled millennium i
[1:15:31] don't want a million yet i want these
[1:15:33] things to fulfill
[1:15:36] i remember in school teachers tears
[1:15:38] tears teachers used to tell me he said
[1:15:40] over he said um
[1:15:41] you you you're christians on them do you
[1:15:43] want to just go to heaven go to them i
[1:15:44] said no
[1:15:45] i don't want to go to heaven i want to
[1:15:46] stay here and be a testimony
[1:15:50] the field we want to escape escape this
[1:15:52] and escape that no we want to be here to
[1:15:54] live
[1:15:55] we want here to be a witness a genuine
[1:15:58] witness
[1:15:58] of god oh hallelujah so each man have to
[1:16:03] seek out the will of god for this life
[1:16:05] no you have to be persistent to achieve
[1:16:08] something and all man through the ages
[1:16:10] has been persistent and noah was
[1:16:12] persistent after he had found the will
[1:16:14] of god
[1:16:15] so when you find the will of god then
[1:16:17] you could jam things then you could say
[1:16:20] devil you can't stop you from going
[1:16:21] there
[1:16:22] because this is god's will there's a
[1:16:24] door you go bang on it
[1:16:25] there's a mountain you will climb it
[1:16:27] there's a sea you want to swim it
[1:16:29] walk through it but nothing in your stop
[1:16:32] because this is god's will
[1:16:33] for your life it's god's will that
[1:16:36] you'll be
[1:16:36] in good health
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:41] sickness is not the will of god for your
[1:16:42] life don't claim it
[1:16:44] reject it shake it off glory to god
[1:16:48] don't claim diabetes hypertension
[1:16:50] whatever your family have don't claim
[1:16:52] none of that
[1:16:53] praise god claim deliverance claim
[1:16:54] freedom
[1:16:56] go glory to god claim revival praise god
[1:16:59] hallelujah it's god's will for you to be
[1:17:02] revived
[1:17:03] it's god's will for you to be inspired
[1:17:05] it's god's will
[1:17:06] for you to leave different than you came
[1:17:08] oh give the lord a shout and that
[1:17:11] it's god's will for you to lose your
[1:17:12] temper this lord
[1:17:14] is god's will
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:27] the image just had to go down just like
[1:17:29] this
[1:17:34] you see that antenna back as you you can
[1:17:35] vex your answer back
[1:17:37] but goku bless you with that and send
[1:17:38] back yes your husband off
[1:17:41] god knows he know you off and you know
[1:17:44] but god is willing for you to be in your
[1:17:46] place
[1:17:49] by being respectful so when you break
[1:17:52] that note you call the whole thing no
[1:17:53] but god has to display the husband now
[1:17:55] because he has to make sure things in
[1:17:57] order that his prayer not be hindered
[1:18:01] anyone not going down there this morning
[1:18:03] i'm not i'm not going there this morning
[1:18:06] so so god what
[1:18:09] god wants what he what what
[1:18:13] so god sent the holy ghost to work among
[1:18:15] his people
[1:18:16] to bring his church together to bring
[1:18:18] our church to a place
[1:18:19] far beyond the lutheran far beyond the
[1:18:22] methodists
[1:18:23] far beyond the pentecostal into a place
[1:18:25] of adoption and rapturing grace
[1:18:28] oh my oh my oh my
[1:18:31] you see the pentecostals they will
[1:18:33] preach too blessed to be stressed
[1:18:35] or whatever they say all they catch
[1:18:36] faces and whatnot and different things
[1:18:37] too blessed to be stressed
[1:18:38] and the money gospel and blessings of
[1:18:40] god and god multiplying on what they're
[1:18:42] doing
[1:18:42] but the thing about the character is not
[1:18:44] formed by multiplication characters not
[1:18:46] formed by blessings and whatnot
[1:18:47] characters happen to be formed by the
[1:18:49] trial of your fate
[1:18:50] by suffering this is what character is
[1:18:52] all about so if we talk about character
[1:18:54] we're talking about training and so
[1:18:56] forth this is the real gospel now
[1:18:58] because what god wants is sons
[1:19:00] manifested and he want to trust his word
[1:19:02] in his sons
[1:19:03] but he pentecostal he was trusting men
[1:19:05] and men fail and they're still failing
[1:19:07] today
[1:19:07] they still fall in big churches big
[1:19:09] money and they still falling by the
[1:19:10] wayside but god wanted character
[1:19:12] and when he went to adopt sons he
[1:19:13] couldn't adopt no other person he
[1:19:15] adopted
[1:19:15] william branham because william branham
[1:19:17] had the character of jesus christ
[1:19:19] and he connected to faith virtue
[1:19:21] knowledge and he said these brothers
[1:19:22] peter had those things
[1:19:24] that is why they were at the world
[1:19:26] because they had the virtues of god in
[1:19:27] them
[1:19:28] so your devotee is going to be in you so
[1:19:30] you burn a prophet now
[1:19:32] to gather all this scattered word
[1:19:33] because the word was lost to the ages so
[1:19:36] before god could reproduce himself
[1:19:38] as a seed you have to gather all all the
[1:19:41] loose ends
[1:19:42] and bring it together that's what the
[1:19:44] seven sea was all about
[1:19:45] to reveal the whole mystery of god to
[1:19:47] produce a perfect seed oh glory to god
[1:19:50] and that seed is seven thunders
[1:19:53] boom a seed inside your soul
[1:19:57] [Applause]
[1:20:00] glory devil the one and thunders inside
[1:20:02] of you
[1:20:03] because that's the tongue that checks to
[1:20:04] the evil in every age it never gets
[1:20:06] shocked up
[1:20:07] luther was a thunder west he wasn't all
[1:20:09] there was shaking the devil's kingdom
[1:20:12] every one of them all glory to god
[1:20:14] hallelujah praise god
[1:20:16] god that god's god in the age he had the
[1:20:19] land anointing
[1:20:20] praise god under paul martin columbus
[1:20:23] isn't that right
[1:20:24] he had the man anointed on the luther
[1:20:26] wesley isn't that right
[1:20:27] he had the ox anointing on the columba
[1:20:29] rada and the eagle anointing under
[1:20:31] brother branham he was always god in the
[1:20:33] church
[1:20:34] well glory to god four gods god in the
[1:20:36] church
[1:20:37] oh glory to god i saw a white horse i
[1:20:40] saw a red horse
[1:20:41] i saw a black horse but the devil
[1:20:43] couldn't see the church
[1:20:45] elected hallelujah
[1:20:48] surviving the onslaught of the enemy and
[1:20:51] in this age with all the filth sex

[1:20:59] god put you and i prophesy
[1:21:02] that you're gonna overcome hell itself
[1:21:04] you will overcome the lust of the eyes
[1:21:06] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:21:08] life you
[1:21:09] will overcome
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:20] love not the world or anything in the
[1:21:22] world if they love the world and the
[1:21:24] king of the world
[1:21:25] love the father is not in you and the
[1:21:27] world is
[1:21:28] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and
[1:21:30] the pride of life
[1:21:32] and you're going to overcome all of that
[1:21:34] all the big shot life you're going to
[1:21:35] overcome that
[1:21:36] all you have to have this you're going
[1:21:37] to overcome that too oh man must have
[1:21:39] this and you're jealous about this you
[1:21:41] can overcome that too
[1:21:42] you will have nothing oh glory to god
[1:21:45] you'll have christ jesus living inside
[1:21:48] of you
[1:21:49] you may be seated god wants to break up
[1:21:50] your human spirit
[1:21:52] oh glory have to break up in any heart
[1:21:53] oh glory to god i feel the anointing
[1:21:55] here with a kangaroo field of spirit the
[1:21:57] other day
[1:21:58] your human spirit have to break up
[1:22:00] anyhow
[1:22:02] gonna be seasoned remember when somebody
[1:22:05] died
[1:22:05] their spirit breaks up the human spirit
[1:22:09] and i put in the human spirit that way i
[1:22:10] have the gcc that way i see you on your
[1:22:13] big shot and you have a big house and a
[1:22:14] big car you have money
[1:22:15] all that is right in the human spirit so
[1:22:18] i'm talking about a woman who was in
[1:22:20] church and everything else dying
[1:22:22] and afterwards when our human spirit
[1:22:24] begin to break up you say i'm lost i'm
[1:22:25] lost
[1:22:26] what happened there a human spirit
[1:22:28] breaks up and her soul is coming forward
[1:22:30] now
[1:22:30] and the soul is subconscious the soul is
[1:22:32] where you are the soul is who you really
[1:22:34] are
[1:22:35] you are what you are in your soul that's
[1:22:38] that's the main thing
[1:22:39] human spirit intellect and reputation
[1:22:41] what people think you are that's not
[1:22:43] what you are you are what you really are
[1:22:45] not what people think you are oh same as
[1:22:47] somebody
[1:22:48] so therefore that human spirit if god
[1:22:50] could slam that word inside of you and
[1:22:52] jam that spirit and break out that
[1:22:54] you'll be so different you'll be
[1:22:55] breaking out the humanistic realm

[1:36:46] zero seven church ages god count is
[1:36:48] different
[1:36:49] and then is come down to the great
[1:36:51] orbiting time to zero hour
[1:36:53] the kung dong seventh goes perfect mount
[1:36:55] number and now he's given us
[1:36:57] a correct condom his kung dong is not 10
[1:36:59] but seven
[1:37:00] and we have just come through seven
[1:37:01] church ages and we find it in revelation
[1:37:03] uh the seventh one is the kung lung
[1:37:05] there's visible the first one is ephesus
[1:37:07] second number is murder
[1:37:09] then pogamos taitara fifth is sardis
[1:37:11] sixth philadelphia
[1:37:12] seventh laodicea the last church age and
[1:37:14] then is zero time
[1:37:16] for the church to leave oh praise be to
[1:37:19] jesus
[1:37:20] thank you lord now they were god's small
[1:37:23] god
[1:37:24] and men if you become born in the family
[1:37:26] or your family you are
[1:37:27] son and part of your father and when sin
[1:37:30] came
[1:37:31] in we found out that man caused the
[1:37:33] chasm and the blood of bulls and goats
[1:37:34] covered but did not remit
[1:37:36] until the reach bleached on the until
[1:37:38] the real bleach came
[1:37:39] that could take the stain of sin and
[1:37:41] break it completely to pieces and when
[1:37:42] it got back to satan he wasted time
[1:37:44] of eternal annihilation i believe here
[1:37:48] we go
[1:37:49] that sin will be broke up and when it's
[1:37:52] confessed
[1:37:53] upon the basis of the blood of jesus
[1:37:55] it's like dropping a blood of black ink
[1:37:57] in a bunch of clorox bleach it just
[1:37:59] breaks it into the chemicals
[1:38:01] and sends it plum back the way it comes
[1:38:03] from and that's the way the blood of
[1:38:05] jesus does
[1:38:06] that sets a man across the chasm again
[1:38:09] as a son of god
[1:38:10] oh glory to god you get what you're
[1:38:12] saying here
[1:38:14] when your sin is broken up it sets you
[1:38:16] back
[1:38:17] as a son of god that's why brahma said
[1:38:19] you are the sinless
[1:38:21] virtuous bride of jesus christ because
[1:38:23] the blood of jesus
[1:38:25] breaks up that thing called sin
[1:38:31] and freeze you from the prison of the
[1:38:34] fall
[1:38:35] from the prison of said freezing from
[1:38:37] that and bring you back into glorious
[1:38:39] sonship
[1:38:40] that you have access to the father oh
[1:38:43] give the lord a shout
[1:38:45] all glory when adam fell
[1:38:49] angels was god in the access angel was
[1:38:52] god in the tree of life
[1:38:53] but now the prophet said angels are
[1:38:55] driving the suns
[1:38:57] back to have access oh glory to god
[1:39:01] let me finish this off here watch then a
[1:39:03] man sets a call to chasm again the son
[1:39:05] of god
[1:39:06] then he becomes what the creative power
[1:39:09] of god is in him
[1:39:10] and at least whenever god can command it
[1:39:13] to be done
[1:39:13] it will be done and we get back and when
[1:39:16] moses here we go
[1:39:17] under the blood of bulls when he met
[1:39:19] that light that pillar fire in the
[1:39:20] burning bush
[1:39:22] he stood there on a commission god had
[1:39:24] given him and he was a prophet
[1:39:26] and when the word of the lord came to
[1:39:27] him he spoke and even things were
[1:39:29] created by the word
[1:39:31] now if it will do that
[1:39:34] under the blood of bulls what about the
[1:39:36] blood of jesus
[1:39:38] not only covered but we knitted it all
[1:39:40] together
[1:39:41] you stand in the presence of god as a
[1:39:44] redeemed
[1:39:45] son all glory to god we see the churches
[1:39:48] far beyond
[1:39:49] the standard of living you can live
[1:39:52] higher than that
[1:39:53] you can live better than that you can
[1:39:54] live better than that
[1:39:56] you can do better than that
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:12] so don't think i'm trying to escape and
[1:40:15] go home
[1:40:17] i have stuff here we could spend two
[1:40:18] more years i always have stuff
[1:40:21] i'm loaded i'm always look at this
[1:40:25] all right so we try to make our
[1:40:26] weaknesses excuses we want to tell how
[1:40:28] big we are
[1:40:29] how great we are so that's why some
[1:40:31] people can laugh at their own self
[1:40:34] there is too embarrassed i like when
[1:40:35] people can laugh at themselves
[1:40:37] if you call after yourself you have a
[1:40:38] problem
[1:40:42] no i'm sorry i don't mean to offend
[1:40:43] anybody
[1:40:46] as laugh at me
[1:40:50] system laughing we are human
[1:40:54] oh my the grace of god we are what we
[1:40:56] are
[1:40:58] and we are grateful to god amen so watch
[1:41:02] we want to tell how big we are how great
[1:41:03] we are i think that's one of the things
[1:41:05] that i
[1:41:05] god gave me this text for was to get
[1:41:07] that out of our mind
[1:41:10] these little things that we do and that
[1:41:12] is what we come to church for
[1:41:14] it's the final way of fault is and the
[1:41:16] things that we might better ourselves
[1:41:18] by if we come to church for any other
[1:41:19] purpose i'm afraid we won't get too much
[1:41:21] i'm afraid you won't get too much coming
[1:41:23] to church we come to find our weaknesses
[1:41:26] find our bad places hold see how little
[1:41:28] we are
[1:41:29] and put our trust in somebody that's
[1:41:30] strong there's so many of us like to
[1:41:33] testify
[1:41:33] or like to think that we are
[1:41:35] insufficient and therefore we make this
[1:41:36] an excuse
[1:41:37] i have no education i have no ability
[1:41:39] i'm not able to do this
[1:41:40] if you key that up to do that way you
[1:41:43] keep going like that then you won't
[1:41:44] among anything
[1:41:45] but the very thing that we make excuses
[1:41:48] by our weaknesses
[1:41:49] god uses that very thing to tackle the
[1:41:52] job with
[1:41:54] he waits for us to get to that condition
[1:41:56] so he can use us
[1:41:58] so god have a way of sending us through
[1:42:01] stuff to strip
[1:42:01] us and in stripping us i call it a
[1:42:04] kink or a break in your human spirit to
[1:42:07] give a
[1:42:08] way for god to break inside of you
[1:42:10] because in your human spirit you are
[1:42:12] strong
[1:42:13] god made you that way you could achieve
[1:42:16] you could do so much stuff without god
[1:42:18] so forgot to come in something i have to
[1:42:20] kind of get messed up tripped up
[1:42:22] trapped up whatever it is and in that
[1:42:24] messed up
[1:42:25] thing where you get broken i am broken
[1:42:29] in that way god could actually come in
[1:42:33] and do something for you then you know
[1:42:35] oh my it's god
[1:42:37] this is not me no more praise god it's
[1:42:40] the lord oh hallelujah
[1:42:43] we find the excuses i can't do this i'm
[1:42:46] insufficient i can't do that
[1:42:47] that's the reason he chooses us because
[1:42:50] we are in that condition
[1:42:52] i know that song strange but we find out
[1:42:55] as we read in
[1:42:56] that weaknesses and rejections we find
[1:42:59] out that those people who are the
[1:43:00] weakest and rejected by the outside
[1:43:02] world is god heroes
[1:43:04] that's conquered that's why brother
[1:43:06] bryan says samson was this big muslim
[1:43:08] man that pumping up in the gym
[1:43:10] he was a little frigging fella spriggly
[1:43:12] guy
[1:43:13] so that is what make it more
[1:43:14] supernatural how come a small guy with
[1:43:16] all the big muscle imprisonment fellas
[1:43:18] when they pump up the other weather
[1:43:19] jersey
[1:43:19] so show the muscles out they do how they
[1:43:21] pump up and i'm not showing us out
[1:43:29] and the spirit is strong
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:32] so we're not talking about you now
[1:43:34] that's why it's not your
[1:43:36] you're weak and that that channel is you
[1:43:37] need the spirit
[1:43:39] i want to speak upon you hannah weak
[1:43:41] talk oh glory to god
[1:43:44] the cast daniel them lions then lion
[1:43:46] hungry lions
[1:43:47] is that lance just get fed and they
[1:43:49] ignoring a human lunch
[1:43:53] he's hungry lying and hungry lying they
[1:43:55] can't handle fire
[1:43:56] so fire was around daniel he said what
[1:43:59] was inside him came out
[1:44:00] so fire was he was fire protected lion
[1:44:03] is afraid of fire
[1:44:05] i think how hungry it is they're smarter
[1:44:07] than that
[1:44:08] keep your hunger out there brother oh
[1:44:10] glory this is fire here
[1:44:12] you can't bite not when fire is here
[1:44:15] oh glory to god these guys defy the five
[1:44:17] senses
[1:44:18] and if you have to get anywhere with god
[1:44:21] you have to defy
[1:44:22] your feelings your senses your emotions
[1:44:25] oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:30] praise god so there was a mentalist
[1:44:32] brother three of them come to this
[1:44:33] church
[1:44:34] they said to me no longer but abraham we
[1:44:36] just received the holy ghost now do we
[1:44:37] see gifts in the ministry i said don't
[1:44:38] do it let it alone
[1:44:40] he's telling me i read a certain brother
[1:44:41] told us that we after we see the holy
[1:44:43] ghost we shall see gifts
[1:44:44] he said and i said become a stuffed
[1:44:46] shirt if you notice
[1:44:48] is always those who trying to get away
[1:44:49] from it is who god uses
[1:44:51] as long as a man wants to do something
[1:44:53] and thinks he got enough ability he can
[1:44:55] do the job over god can't use that man
[1:44:57] don't seek nothing god's gutting me for
[1:44:59] you he'll give it to you
[1:45:00] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:45:03] hallelujah
[1:45:04] now we take the weakest and rejected
[1:45:06] party every hero of god in the front
[1:45:08] line
[1:45:09] have been that of a person a person
[1:45:10] rejected a prisoner thought he was
[1:45:12] insufficient a person who had no ability
[1:45:14] then that's the person just in good
[1:45:16] shape for god to start using them
[1:45:18] then they feel like they can't they have
[1:45:19] nothing to do all right so i'll just go
[1:45:21] so watch
[1:45:22] when we are insufficient ourselves then
[1:45:24] we subject to yield to god's spirit
[1:45:26] as long as we think we can do it then we
[1:45:28] can't do it but when
[1:45:30] we get to a place where we know we can't
[1:45:31] do it then we yield ourselves to god
[1:45:34] and he does it so that if it's us trying
[1:45:37] we will feel
[1:45:38] but if we yield ourselves to god then
[1:45:40] god cannot fail
[1:45:42] oh glory to god hallelujah this is the
[1:45:45] power i want to get to when i close
[1:45:47] the important thing one of the
[1:45:50] important things we must master
[1:45:53] and especially you young preachers
[1:45:55] remembers alike
[1:45:57] there's one thing we have got to master
[1:45:59] if we expect to fulfill god's design our
[1:46:01] life
[1:46:01] is to master the thought of human
[1:46:03] ability if we ever get to a spot we
[1:46:06] think
[1:46:06] we can do it with our own intelligence
[1:46:09] our own abilities
[1:46:10] we've got to master it in such a way
[1:46:12] that we can get rid of the thing
[1:46:13] laid aside so god can use us and make a
[1:46:16] complete surrender
[1:46:18] we cannot use one ability we cannot you
[1:46:20] make we got to make a complete surrender
[1:46:22] to come to god you've got to surrender
