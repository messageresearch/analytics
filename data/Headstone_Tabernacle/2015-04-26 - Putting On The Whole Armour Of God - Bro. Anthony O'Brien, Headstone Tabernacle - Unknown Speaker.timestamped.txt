[22:34] Anthony going to be ministering to you
[22:35] this morning bless brother Anthony we
[22:37] appreciate him
[22:40] amen Matthew 24 reads and Jesus went out
[22:43] and departed from the temple and the
[22:45] disciples came to him to show him the
[22:47] buildings of the temple and Jesus said
[22:48] unto them see ye not all these things
[22:52] verily i s to you there shall not be
[22:53] left one stone upon another that shall
[22:56] not be thrown down and as he sat in the
[22:59] Mount of Olives the disciples came unto
[23:01] him privately saying tell us what shall
[23:03] these things be and what shall be a sign
[23:06] of thy coming and of the end of the
[23:10] world end of the
[23:15] world people live here like bosses like
[23:18] rulers like dictators and presidents and
[23:21] popes and
[23:23] pontiffs they live here as if they're
[23:25] here
[23:26] forever they live here as if are in
[23:30] charge but there was a major earthquake
[23:32] in Nepal and so far over 2,000 people
[23:36] are dead was huge it was
[23:39] big and you wouldn't want to be in that
[23:42] scenario where they are at right now
[23:46] they're not singing right now they can't
[23:48] go to church right now it's a
[23:51] disaster let me read
[23:53] on and Jesus answered and said unto them
[23:56] take heed that no man deceive you
[23:59] for many shall come in my name saying I
[24:00] am Christ shall deceive many first thing
[24:04] Jesus addressed was
[24:06] deception and he shall hear of wars and
[24:09] rumors of wars so what he saying here
[24:11] don't look for some man to come and say
[24:13] I am this and I that forget that am Wars
[24:17] rumors of wars see that he be not
[24:20] troubled for all these things must come
[24:23] to pass but the end is not
[24:27] yet na shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[24:30] against Kingdom there shall be famines
[24:34] pestilences earthquakes in diverse
[24:37] places all these things are the
[24:41] beginning of
[24:43] Sorrows Daniel talk about a time that
[24:46] never was since the world began all
[24:48] these things are the beginning of
[24:52] Sorrows then shall they deliver you up
[24:54] to be afflicted kill you shall be hated
[24:56] of all nations from my name take and
[24:58] then many shall be offended and shall
[25:01] betray one another and shall hate one
[25:04] another so hate is a promise in this
[25:05] last day of behavior and attitude many
[25:09] false prophets shall arise shall deceive
[25:11] many and because iniquity shall abound
[25:14] the love of many shall wax cold but he
[25:18] that shall endure unto the end the same
[25:22] shall be saved and verse 14 verse 14 is
[25:26] where this thing is so potent and this
[25:29] Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
[25:33] in all the world and then the end shall
[25:36] come may God bless his word could we
[25:39] give the Lord a shout of
[25:41] [Applause]

[39:15] that is needed in this battle in this
[39:18] war that we are in this morning
[39:20] hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah
[39:23] praise God so for my title uh I just
[39:26] have a title this morning it's
[39:27] everything it's my inspiration it's my
[39:29] subject it's my motivation this morning
[39:32] and that is putting on the whole armor
[39:35] of
[39:36] God Amen GL praise the Lord hallelujah
[39:40] hallelujah and I just wanted to
[39:41] highlight also um uh series of messages
[39:45] brother been preaching uh uh coming down
[39:48] to this even unto this day and uh such
[39:50] an inspiration they appreciate for over
[39:52] this
[39:53] morning
[39:55] amen hallelujah and um last week I
[39:59] believe he was speaking
[40:01] about Mo uh Moses yeah with the
[40:03] sculpture I think that's right and um it
[40:06] was such an inspiration to me and I'm an
[40:09] artist so I just see things a certain
[40:11] way and when he started to bring out
[40:13] that thought um it was just mindblowing
[40:15] to me what I began to think on it and he
[40:18] was talking about the sculpture and how
[40:20] God was cutting you down to the word
[40:22] only is that right and it opened up to
[40:25] me that what God was doing was really
[40:28] really something is really fine-tuning
[40:31] because a sculpture if he's doing a
[40:34] artist if he's doing a sculpture there
[40:36] are two different types of sculpturing
[40:38] there's one which is like additive
[40:40] sculpturing or like there's something
[40:42] called constructive sculpturing which is
[40:44] like using clay so you could take clay
[40:46] and put it together in that process if
[40:50] you something breaks off you could
[40:53] easily take clay put it back mold it and
[40:56] continue working
[40:58] but what the prophet was talking about
[41:00] with the sculpture that Michelangelo is
[41:01] working on is something called
[41:03] deconstructive sculpturing which is even
[41:05] harder because if a piece comes off
[41:08] that's not supposed to come off the
[41:10] entire thing is messed
[41:13] up and another thing is that your vision
[41:16] cannot
[41:18] change say Amen somebody am you can't
[41:21] wake up one morning with one vision and
[41:23] then after a year you say I think you
[41:26] should change this you know it's too
[41:28] late for that it done already started
[41:30] working the vision has to remain
[41:35] constant is that right and God has a way
[41:39] of being
[41:40] constant he don't change like we change
[41:43] God changes not so when he speaks
[41:46] something is perfect every time and when
[41:49] he has a vision for your
[41:51] life say Amen somebody it is perfect
[41:54] every
[41:55] time oh
[41:57] Hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[42:01] Amen so I just loved when begin to think
[42:03] about it because the first stage of the
[42:05] sculpture is when um you'll see if
[42:08] you're looking at the artist and he's
[42:09] now started he's got the rock it's all
[42:11] big and ugly and weird looking it has
[42:13] trees and dirt and everything on it so
[42:15] he has to cut out everything so he
[42:16] starts cutting crazy there's stuff
[42:18] flying all over the place you don't even
[42:19] know what's happening and but he has a
[42:21] vision he knows what's supposed to
[42:23] happen next right so this first part is
[42:25] all crazy it's wild there's things
[42:27] flying all over dust dirt everything the
[42:29] whole place is covered in everything
[42:31] that is not Moses isn't that right but
[42:34] then the second part come down to the
[42:36] fine
[42:36] tuning that is the part when it comes
[42:39] down to the honing now that's the part
[42:41] when the artist begins to take his time
[42:44] to bring out the
[42:48] vision oh Hal I believe you're getting
[42:50] it this
[42:51] morning sometimes you look at it for an
[42:53] hour two hours you think he's crazy and
[42:57] then he'll take his chisel his hammer
[42:58] run up ching ching ching stop and come
[43:01] back then 2 hours pass again then he
[43:03] goes up to ching ching ching comes back
[43:05] again what's he doing honing it shaping
[43:08] it a certain way because he can't afford
[43:11] to
[43:11] miss oh hallelujah hallelujah so what
[43:15] are you saying brother Anthony you are
[43:16] so precious you are so unique you are
[43:20] such a peculiar treasure to God that he
[43:23] can't afford to miss so he's taking his
[43:27] time this morning oh with this
[43:31] masterpiece because it's got to come out
[43:33] right oh Hallelujah and when God finish
[43:37] with us we are going to come out right
[43:41] oh remember this one thing Perfection
[43:44] takes
[43:45] time amen amen if you're looking to do
[43:49] uh once over sure you know 5 minutes
[43:51] that's fine you know do a little thing
[43:54] you know they'll be happy with that but
[43:55] when you're going for perfection
[43:58] when you're going for the horning the
[43:59] shaping the real nitty-gritty that takes
[44:03] time and sometimes we want God to do
[44:05] things for us right away we want God to
[44:08] start it right away start the work and
[44:10] he God standing for an hour two hours
[44:13] and when in moment you at least think
[44:15] not he runs up chisel chisel chisel then
[44:18] runs
[44:19] back oh hallelujah hallelujah but he's
[44:22] shaping you oh Hallelujah be confident
[44:24] this morning it's going to come out
[44:26] right
[44:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[44:30] it's God that's doing the work and it's
[44:33] going to come out right amen so we just
[44:35] trusting in the Lord this morning so I
[44:37] just appreciated that thought I just
[44:38] thought i' preface the message with that
[44:41] this morning amen but praise God I have
[44:44] a thought in my heart putting on the
[44:46] whole armor of God is that right so
[44:51] let's begin this
[44:53] morning so we in a war this morning is
[44:56] not
[44:57] and in this church and our inspiration
[45:00] we are Waring against
[45:03] inertia we are Waring against the normal
[45:06] beat of things we are no Waring against
[45:09] the hum drum Dr we are Waring against
[45:12] coming to church and going back home and
[45:15] doing the same old same old and
[45:18] expecting a Revival because that can't
[45:20] work amen if you're looking for Revival
[45:23] you can't come the way you've been
[45:25] coming you have to change change the way
[45:27] you move you have to change the way you
[45:30] operate you have to change the way you
[45:32] do things isn't that right and we are in
[45:35] a war this morning Hallelujah believe it
[45:37] or not we are in a war amen we have
[45:40] already had casualties of this war but
[45:42] we are pressing on this morning because
[45:44] we are looking for Perfection and the
[45:47] devil is not going to give you an inch
[45:51] you have to fight for every inch that
[45:54] you say you stand on you have to fight
[45:57] for it this morning if you claim
[45:59] anything in here this morning the devil
[46:01] is waiting for you on Monday morning to
[46:04] see if you're going to stand or if
[46:06] you're going to fall but I know my Bible
[46:09] tells me that when the enemy raises up
[46:11] like a flood the spirit of God will
[46:14] raise up a standard against
[46:16] him oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[46:20] hallelujah oh the Lord is on our side
[46:23] this morning so don't you be ashamed
[46:26] don't you be dismayed because the same
[46:28] God that brought you out is the same God
[46:31] that's going to take you through oh
[46:34] Hallelujah we not putting our confidence
[46:37] in a man where there is no help but my
[46:40] Bible tells me we look to the hills from
[46:43] whence cometh our help our help come
[46:46] from the Lord the Lord which make heaven
[46:49] and earth oh hallelujah hallelujah he
[46:53] will not suffer thaty F to be moved oh

[47:11] you will fall or whether you will take
[47:13] your
[47:15] stand oh hallelujah hallelujah
[47:20] [Applause]
[47:25] hallelujah GL
[47:27] I remember one time I was looking at I
[47:29] don't know if it's was a documentary or
[47:30] film or something it was about a
[47:32] football
[47:33] team and the football team was
[47:37] accustomed to a certain coach a certain
[47:38] level of training a certain way of doing
[47:41] things they had their own beat right and
[47:43] this one coach was hired for the job
[47:47] apparently the other one was demoted and
[47:49] there was some conflict because during
[47:51] that time it was racial segregation in
[47:53] the US and America and this African
[47:56] American coach came to take over the
[47:58] team and stuff like that so the other co
[48:01] uh coach who obviously was a white man
[48:03] he was very much um vexed of what
[48:07] transpired and there was little
[48:08] conflicts and so on but this
[48:10] African-American coach he came out and
[48:12] he began to tell the team listen the way
[48:15] you accustom doing things we're going to
[48:16] change that the way you're accustom
[48:18] training we're going to change that the
[48:20] way you normally approach the game we're
[48:22] going to change that you're going to
[48:24] change the way you run change the way
[48:25] you block change change the way you
[48:27] tackle change the way you think change
[48:29] the way you train change the way you run
[48:31] change the way you talk to me change the
[48:33] way you talk to your friends we're going
[48:35] to change the way we do things around
[48:37] here and he started to shake up the team
[48:39] he started to shake up the way they were
[48:41] doing things because they were
[48:42] accustomed with the white supremacy and
[48:44] he started to bring along a Brotherhood
[48:45] between black and white and after a
[48:47] while they were they were vexed with it
[48:49] but after a while they they started to
[48:50] come come into the training they started
[48:52] to come into their own they started to
[48:54] come into what he was trying to bring to
[48:56] them he had a vision of what this team
[48:58] was supposed to be like and little by
[49:00] little they began to form camaraderie
[49:02] they began to form bonds between one
[49:04] another so much so that they became
[49:06] unbreakable so much so that they became
[49:09] Unstoppable in that football season they
[49:11] won every single match that they ever
[49:13] set their foot on the field on oh
[49:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and I'm
[49:19] saying this morning if we going to go

[55:32] if you see a bomb duck roll and cover
[55:36] they were in a war they had to let the
[55:38] people know that it wasn't business as
[55:41] usual even though they were going to to
[55:43] the work and going to businesses and
[55:45] doing what they had to do during the day
[55:46] there was war situation going on Germany

[55:51] fighting this one fighting that one it
[55:53] was war they had to be reminded every

[56:06] sloting and maming and murdering people
[56:09] that's a war situation well this morning
[56:11] we are in a war situation we are in a
[56:14] spiritual war situation right now in
[56:17] this atmosphere in this church because
[56:19] the devil is not out there this morning
[56:22] the devil doesn't want those people out
[56:24] there he already got them but the devil
[56:26] this morning has on a shirt he has on a
[56:29] tie Hallelujah he's all dressed up and
[56:31] he is in church this morning he wants to

[56:39] promises from God he wants to come into
[56:42] your mind and try to mess you up he has
[56:45] access to your mind but one thing the
[56:47] devil cannot interfere with the devil
[56:50] can not interfere with what is in your
[56:52] soul what is in your heart oh is is that
[56:56] right there's a seed of predestination
[56:59] in there there's a seed of adoption in
[57:02] there that the devil cannot interfere
[57:06] with so try as he may he can't touch
[57:09] your soul this morning try as he may he
[57:13] cannot destroy you this morning what is
[57:15] the secret the word is in the bride and
[57:18] the mind of Christ is getting ready to
[57:21] drop down the intelligence to show you
[57:24] what to do with the word
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:28] oh you're going to take the word and
[57:29] hand it there amen is that right do you
[57:34] need an example let's look at
[57:37] Job the Bible says that the sons of God
[57:41] came to offer sacrifice in the temple
[57:44] and who came along with them the devil
[57:47] as as I said he's in church so he came
[57:50] in church that morning and the holy God
[57:53] begin to have a conversation with the
[57:54] devil seeing as how he decided to come
[57:57] along and he asked the devil he said
[57:59] what are you doing here so Lucifer
[58:02] answered and said well I've been about
[58:04] tossing to and fro looking for mischief
[58:06] to cause looking for people to interfere
[58:09] with looking for families to distress
[58:11] looking for lives to
[58:13] destroy so God said well if that is the
[58:17] order of the day then have you
[58:19] considered this man so God open his
[58:23] pamphlet of of of names and begin to
[58:26] show Satan a certain somebody who

[58:42] about him but the reason why I couldn't
[58:45] touch him now don't get don't miss this
[58:46] now this is great the reason why I
[58:49] couldn't touch him is because you have a
[58:52] hedge around him amen the reason why I
[58:55] couldn't touch him
[58:56] is because you have a protection barrier
[58:58] around him the reason why I couldn't
[59:01] touch him at all is because you have a
[59:03] fence around him you see when you stand
[59:06] for God he'll stand for
[59:09] you when you are God's child a nothing
[59:13] can touch you the devil has to ask for
[59:21] permission oh
[59:23] Hallelujah I'll say it again because you

[1:09:11] that we are fighting for is the word of

[1:09:26] the word so if we preach anything else
[1:09:29] to you other than the word how can God
[1:09:31] anoint that he cannot anoint our
[1:09:33] thoughts he cannot anoint our ideas he
[1:09:35] cannot anoint what we think he can only
[1:09:37] anoint his word he says my thoughts are
[1:09:40] not your thoughts my ways are not my
[1:09:42] your ways my word is not your word man's

[1:20:30] lot of wars in the in the Bible isn't
[1:20:32] that right many battles were fought and
[1:20:36] always think back to the first war that
[1:20:38] was in Revelation 12: 7 says Michael and
[1:20:42] his angels fought and the dragon and his
[1:20:44] angels fought against the enemy
[1:20:47] Hallelujah they are fighting against
[1:20:48] each other isn't that right in heaven
[1:20:50] because the dragon thought that he could
[1:20:52] get some worship too he thought why
[1:20:54] could God have all the worship Lucifer
[1:20:56] was an esteemed person in heaven but he
[1:20:58] let it get to his head he let it get
[1:21:00] over him he let it get to Sweet in the
[1:21:03] mouth hallelujah hallelujah begin to
[1:21:05] talk about himself a little more he
[1:21:06] begin to brag about himself a little bit
[1:21:08] he begin to tell a lie and then he
[1:21:10] needed another lie to cover up that lie
[1:21:12] and the more lies he told is the more of
[1:21:14] a hole he began to sink himself deeper
[1:21:16] in and he said I'm not going by myself I
[1:21:19] have to go with some other people so he
[1:21:21] got some church members some ones who
[1:21:23] didn't know why they wasn't Church they
[1:21:24] just showed up and Devils come and
[1:21:27] Whisper to the air silly women leading
[1:21:29] with diverse lust begin to whisper in
[1:21:31] the air and they went along with him
[1:21:34] they were laid captive but there were
[1:21:35] some sons of God who W afraid to stand
[1:21:39] against the devil and his
[1:21:42] angels oh I believe we're speaking to
[1:21:45] that people this morning you are not
[1:21:47] afraid of the devil you are not afraid
[1:21:50] of the enemy hallelujah
[1:21:53] hallelujah

[1:21:58] devil is is thousands of years he doing
[1:22:00] this all the time Heaven all right one

[1:22:05] upside down all of a sudden there a
[1:22:07] Waring faction sword and stone and and
[1:22:09] shield and disc going back and forth
[1:22:11] dragon fighting Michael fighting sons of
[1:22:14] God fighting the sons of the devil
[1:22:15] fighting isn't that right conflict back
[1:22:18] and forth Hallelujah but the Bible says
[1:22:20] that the Michael and his angels Prevail
[1:22:23] over the devil and what do you think
[1:22:25] happened as soon as they Prevail
[1:22:27] Hallelujah the Bible said they lifted up
[1:22:29] their hands to heaven and began to
[1:22:30] praise the name of the Lord Our God and
[1:22:33] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:22:34] ever oh H they begin to praise God what
[1:22:38] do you think begin to happen they begin
[1:22:39] to have a Revival they begin to dance
[1:22:42] and Shout where were you and the sons of
[1:22:44] God kick Satan Out of Heaven oh

[1:23:49] anymore there's no place for his greed
[1:23:52] no place for his selfishness no place
[1:23:54] for his words oh we don't want to hear
[1:23:56] what the devil have to say this Bible
[1:23:58] has all that we need this Bible have all
[1:24:01] the answers we need every answer you
[1:24:03] need is written in this book young man
[1:24:06] young woman you don't have to ask no boy
[1:24:08] you don't have to ask no girl for the
[1:24:10] answer this has the
[1:24:13] answer this is what we're standing on
[1:24:16] this is what we're fighting for this is
[1:24:18] what we're contending for because when
[1:24:20] the World falls down when this falls
[1:24:22] down when all the systems come apse this
[1:24:25] world will stand
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:28] forever this is where we come from my
[1:24:31] name is in this book your name is in
[1:24:34] this book and when we preach this book
[1:24:37] we preach your name
[1:24:40] hallelujah
[1:24:42] hallelujah oh
[1:24:45] hallelujah
[1:24:48] amen glory hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:51] hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so this
[1:24:53] heavenly battle
[1:24:56] amen the devil come down like lightning
[1:24:58] upon the Earth is that
[1:25:01] right Hallelujah and that battle begin
[1:25:04] to continue on the earth isn't that
[1:25:05] right right Hallelujah now there's a
[1:25:07] difference between a war and a battle a
[1:25:10] war is a continuous thing it's made up
[1:25:12] of different battles H there's this
[1:25:15] battle and that battle and this battle
[1:25:17] so this first battle in heaven ended
[1:25:19] Hallelujah when Michael kicked Satan out
[1:25:22] of heavenly places and T him down on the
[1:25:24] earth that was only the first battle am
[1:25:27] there were many other battles to follow
[1:25:29] after that isn't that right where the
[1:25:32] devil is fighting against God's people
[1:25:35] God's people fighting against the forces
[1:25:37] of the devil Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:25:39] life been separated from darkness and
[1:25:42] since that day there was separation
[1:25:44] separation separation isn't that right
[1:25:47] going on down the line and the Battle of
[1:25:49] angels become the Battle of men isn't
[1:25:52] that right Bible said we were born in
[1:25:55] sin we were shaped in iniquity we come
[1:25:58] in the world speaking lies isn't that
[1:26:00] right we didn't know our place we didn't
[1:26:03] know who we were because of Adam and the
[1:26:05] fall so we had to find our way back to
[1:26:08] God and God had to find his way to get
[1:26:12] to us to reveal himself to us isn't that
[1:26:15] right so through what seemed like the
[1:26:17] foolishness of preacher through what
[1:26:19] seemed like just a preacher on the
[1:26:21] street somebody spoke a word to us
[1:26:23] somebody witness back to us this blessed
[1:26:26] holy word of God hallelujah and
[1:26:29] something in our hearts begin to connect
[1:26:31] back to our Eternal promise to an
[1:26:34] eternal property that was veiling your
[1:26:36] heart since before the foundation of the
[1:26:38] world the devil tried to keep you from
[1:26:40] it but God found his way to you this
[1:26:43] morning so Hallelujah God found his way
[1:26:47] to you this morning somehow he found his
[1:26:50] way look at you now you didn't think you
[1:26:52] would make it you didn't think you come
[1:26:54] this far but when you look back down the
[1:26:56] long road it was God that took us
[1:26:59] through it was God that took us through
[1:27:00] the trial it was God that took us
[1:27:02] through the test it was God that put the
[1:27:05] fight in us to overcome this trial to
[1:27:08] overcome this test to overcome this
[1:27:13] persecution
[1:27:14] hallelujah oh you couldn't save yourself
[1:27:17] it was God that save you so put your
[1:27:19] confidence in God and put on the whole
[1:27:22] armor of God that you make be able to
[1:27:24] stand in the evil day having done all to
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:32] standen amen amen

[1:29:04] isn't that right so we were born in

[1:29:12] and imperfection Hallelujah and He sent
[1:29:14] Jesus Christ the son of God to bridge a
[1:29:17] gap Hallelujah with the blood Hal

[1:29:50] coming forth in 2015 to fight the enemy

[1:39:00] conquerors through Christ that loved us
[1:39:03] Amen Let me hurry along here now so now
[1:39:06] before any battle can be put in a AR
[1:39:08] they have to first choose a meeting
[1:39:09] ground or a place where the battle is to
[1:39:12] be fought a selected place isn't that
[1:39:14] right in the first world war it was so
[1:39:16] placed as no man's land and places where
[1:39:18] they fought and they've got to be a
[1:39:20] place selected isn't that right there
[1:39:22] has to be a Place selected and they say
[1:39:25] as there's a mutual ground no man's land
[1:39:27] okay they fight near this place he said
[1:39:29] they don't just fight here they don't
[1:39:31] just fight over there fight down there
[1:39:32] he said there's a Battlefront where they
[1:39:34] meet and test their powers where each
[1:39:37] Army tests its strength against the
[1:39:39] other Army a mutual meeting place he
[1:39:41] said now don't miss this here the said
[1:39:43] the prophet he said when this gratt
[1:39:45] started on Earth there had to be a
[1:39:47] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:39:49] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:39:53] and for battle to rage and that
[1:39:55] Battleground begins in the human
[1:39:57] mind isn't that right he said there's
[1:40:01] where the battle starts the human mind
[1:40:03] was chosen for the place of the battle
[1:40:06] where it begin and it's because that
[1:40:07] decisions are made from the mind the
[1:40:10] head and now they say they they they
[1:40:13] they never started it from some
[1:40:15] organization they never started it from
[1:40:17] some mechanical Affair the grounds never
[1:40:19] started there therefore that
[1:40:21] organization could never do the work of
[1:40:23] God because the Battlegrounds is where
[1:40:25] you've got to meet your enemy is in the
[1:40:28] mind you've got to make your
[1:40:30] choice it meets you isn't that right you
[1:40:34] said decisions are made in the mind and
[1:40:36] in the head that's where Satan meets you
[1:40:40] and the decisions are because that God
[1:40:42] made a man that way isn't that right
[1:40:45] that's why God told the prophet because
[1:40:46] thou has chosen the narrow way the
[1:40:49] harder way there be a huge portion of
[1:40:51] Heaven awaiting you isn't that right you
[1:40:54] have to make a choice young man young
[1:40:56] woman oh whoever you are you've got to
[1:40:58] make a choice whether you serve God or
[1:41:01] serve the devil there's no in between
[1:41:04] you can't mess with in between you can't
[1:41:06] be sitting on the fence you're either
[1:41:08] for God or for the Devil the fence is a
[1:41:11] very dangerous place to be at because as
[1:41:14] I told you we in a war and the devil is
[1:41:17] looking for any opportunity and if you
[1:41:19] are sitting on the fence it is easy for
[1:41:22] the devil to reach up on the fence and
[1:41:24] grab you and pull you down on the other
[1:41:27] side don't sit on the fence get over to
[1:41:30] God where the promises are come on now
[1:41:34] get over in the word get over where you
[1:41:36] should be stay down the middle of the
[1:41:38] road not over on the left not over on
[1:41:40] the right but stay down the middle of
[1:41:42] that road that road is headed to Glory
[1:41:45] that road is headed to your promise that
[1:41:47] road is headed to your portion oh
[1:41:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:41:54] oh isn't that right isn't that right
[1:41:57] Hallelujah so this battle we about to
[1:41:59] face Hallelujah the uh Prophet call it
[1:42:02] the greatest battle that's ever been
[1:42:04] fought oh think about it many sages and
[1:42:08] Prophets wish they could have been here
[1:42:10] to see what was going to go on and what
[1:42:12] was going to take place they knew it
[1:42:14] would be a final showdown they knew it
[1:42:16] would be the final climax of all the
[1:42:18] powers that was in God that he had
[1:42:20] poured into Christ oh they that all the
[1:42:23] powers that was in Christ was about to
[1:42:25] be poured into the church in this last
[1:42:28] day because God knew that we would need
[1:42:30] all the power of God to fight all the
[1:42:34] power of Satan oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:38] hallelujah hallelujah amen amen not some
[1:42:41] of the power all of the Power that's why
[1:42:45] you need to put on the whole armor of
[1:42:46] God not some of the armor oh not just
[1:42:49] your feet not just your belt good to
[1:42:52] Lord no no no not just your breastplate
[1:42:54] of righteousness not just the helmet not
[1:42:56] just the shield but you need the sword
[1:42:58] of the
[1:42:59] spirit listen you can have the armor but
[1:43:04] if you don't have the sword you are not
[1:43:06] in attack mode even up to the shield you
[1:43:10] might just be able to defend yourself
[1:43:12] but if you really want to do some damage
[1:43:15] if you really want to hurt the enemy if
[1:43:17] you really want to slice and cut if you
[1:43:20] really want to shut the heavens and open
[1:43:21] it up you need the word of of God to be
[1:43:24] able to hand it
[1:43:27] there because the most you could do with
[1:43:29] the shield is just hide behind the
[1:43:30] shield hide behind your Revelation hide
[1:43:33] behind your Vindication isn't that right
[1:43:35] hide behind the fiery dots of the enemy
[1:43:38] the enemy ha you so much he's shooting
[1:43:40] fiery darts hallelujah hallelujah it
[1:43:43] means that if he even if he don't hit
[1:43:44] you the fire is supposed to land
[1:43:46] somewhere and wreak havoc H you have to
[1:43:48] be jumping here and jumping there and
[1:43:50] hiding from the enemy but when the sword
[1:43:52] of the word goes into your hand you can
[1:43:55] raise up flip your sword run into the
[1:44:00] enemy Hallelujah hand it there hand it
[1:44:03] there the word of God sharper and a
[1:44:06] two-edged sword cutting beyond the bone
[1:44:09] cutting beyond the
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:12] marrow oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:18] hallelujah oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:44:20] right oh we getting ready to do battle
[1:44:22] this morning morning we're getting ready
[1:44:24] to fight the enemy this morning I don't
[1:44:26] want to just damage the enemy I want to
[1:44:28] do him away forever after what he's done
[1:44:31] to all the saints in the ages after what
[1:44:33] he's done hallelujah praise God he don't
[1:44:36] deserve to live oh but we got the word
[1:44:38] of the sword of word of the Lord this
[1:44:40] morning to slice the enemy
[1:44:44] as
[1:44:46] listen in Roman military tactics the
[1:44:50] sword that they were using is not a long
[1:44:52] SW sword amen it's not a Broad Sword
[1:44:55] hallelujah it's just a small sword amen
[1:44:58] and I love how Paul I described the Army
[1:45:01] he didn't talk about a Speare a spare is
[1:45:04] a different kind of weapon Hallelujah
[1:45:05] with a spare you can shoot from afar and
[1:45:08] hope to hit the target you're shooting
[1:45:10] from far and you're hoping to hit the
[1:45:11] enemy but the word of God is not
[1:45:14] something that Miss and hit it's not a
[1:45:16] perhaps is not a maybe so the sword was
[1:45:19] designed short keep it close to you and
[1:45:22] when on shees you go up to the enemy
[1:45:26] face to face because that's where the
[1:45:27] battle is we not shooting from far and
[1:45:31] hope you're going to make it and think
[1:45:33] you're going to make it no it's a short
[1:45:35] sword cor up to the enemy run up to the
[1:45:39] enemy stab him praise God turn it inside
