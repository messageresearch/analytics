[10:36] your presence. We thank you for your
[10:37] spirit. May you have the preeminences
[10:39] tonight. Give us that key word tonight.
[10:41] Lord, unlock this door of blessings and
[10:43] deliverance and breakthrough in prayer.
[10:46] In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen.
[10:48] God bless you and welcome tonight. And
[10:51] we are grateful to be here tonight by
[10:53] God's grace. I'm looking forward to see
[10:55] what the Lord will do tonight. Amen.
[10:57] Praise the Lord. Just one second.
[11:03] So tonight I want to go in a scripture
[11:05] of Psalms 2. There's three words I want
[11:08] to pull out from there of Psalms 2. We
[11:11] want to get a context and this scripture
[11:14] is speaking about Jesus but it's
[11:16] something I want to pull out from there.
[11:18] Psalms 2 if you have your Bibles to
[11:20] Psalms 2. Why do the heathen rage and
[11:24] the people imagine a vain thing? The
[11:26] kings of the earth set themselves and
[11:28] the rulers take council together against
[11:31] the Lord and against his anointed,
[11:33] saying, "Let us break their advance
[11:35] asunder and cast away their cause from
[11:37] us. He that sitth in the heaven shall
[11:39] laugh. The Lord shall have them in
[11:42] derision. Then shall he speak into them
[11:45] in his wrath, and vex them in his sword
[11:47] displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon
[11:50] my holy hill on Zion. I will declare the
[11:53] decree the Lord had said unto me, thou
[11:56] art my son, speaking about Jesus, this
[11:59] day have I begotten thee. Ask of me,
[12:04] speaking to his son, asks of me and I
[12:06] will give thee the heen for thine
[12:09] inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
[12:12] the earth for thy possession.
[12:14] Thou shalt break them with a rod of an
[12:16] iron. Thou shalt dash them in pieces
[12:20] with a potter's vessel. So the three
[12:23] words I want to pull out there from
[12:24] verse 8, ask of me. And that's the title
[12:28] of the exaltation tonight. Ask of me.
[12:31] We'll see what the Lord will do. Praise
[12:34] God. Now
[12:37] God has placed prayer
[12:40] as a channel
[12:42] to receive
[12:44] what he has already given as yours.
[12:48] And even though it is given to you, it
[12:52] must be requested or you must ask.
[12:57] Even though the inheritance is promised,
[13:01] you have to ask for it.
[13:03] This is Paul's blessings and
[13:05] commendation to the church in Acts
[13:08] 20:32.
[13:10] And now, brethren, this is Paul, I
[13:13] commend you to God to the word of his
[13:16] grace, which is able to build you up and
[13:19] to give you an inheritance
[13:23] among all them that are sanctified.
[13:27] So, inheritance
[13:29] is something that is God-given.
[13:32] You don't earn it. You don't make it up.
[13:35] It's an unconditional covenant that God
[13:39] has made with his people.
[13:41] And this came from Genesis 12 when God
[13:45] tell Abraham to come out of his country
[13:47] and I will bless them that bless thee.
[13:48] I'll make thee great. I'll just skip
[13:50] quickly. So Abraham departed as the Lord
[13:52] had spoken
[13:54] and unto him and Lot went with him and
[13:57] Abraham was 75 years old. And then this
[14:01] is the part verse 7. And the Lord
[14:03] appeared unto Abraham,
[14:05] and said, unto thy seed will I give this
[14:09] land, and dear buildeth he an altar unto
[14:14] the Lord who appeared unto him. So we
[14:17] know, and Baram will explain it with
[14:20] Adam, if you will, if you do, I will do
[14:24] and so on like that. But this covenant
[14:26] was an unconditional covenant that we
[14:29] could have an effective applied faith
[14:32] and trust in God that he can't lie and
[14:35] he can't make a promise that he can't
[14:36] keep and every promise that he make made
[14:39] has to be fulfilled. Isn't that right?
[14:41] So God must come and honor his promises.
[14:45] Bam said this here. Now there are two
[14:48] covenants. One of them is the Adam
[14:50] covenant. God made a covenant with the
[14:52] man. If you will, I will. and he broke
[14:54] it. Then God made a covenant with Noah
[14:56] and it was the Noah covenant and it was
[14:58] broke. Now he's making the Abrahamic
[15:01] covenant. And the Abrahamic covenant
[15:03] according to the Genesis 12th chapter is
[15:05] given me unconditionally.
[15:07] It's eternal. It's unconditional. Not if
[15:11] you will, I will. He said I have. I
[15:14] already done it. Not I will do it. I
[15:16] have done it. That bases fate. God is
[15:20] determined to save man. He made a
[15:22] covenant. If you will, I will. He break
[15:24] it. Another one. You will, I will. He
[15:26] broke it. Man can't keep his covenant.
[15:29] So God saves man by his grace under a
[15:31] covenant that is unconditional, never
[15:35] ending. That's all there is to it.
[15:38] Three, perfect. Noah, um, Adam, Noah,
[15:42] Abraham. And that's the reason, Here we
[15:45] go. We are Abraham's children. That
[15:48] covenant cannot end never end because
[15:51] it's unconditional. Not because you
[15:53] choose God is God choose you. Not
[15:56] because you do something is because of
[15:59] God did something. So therefore God here
[16:02] we go. I'm saying this God is showing
[16:05] himself as the source of the blessings
[16:10] and inheritance.
[16:12] We cannot conquer in our own strength.
[16:16] So therefore in asking him and ask of
[16:22] him like you say ask of me we are
[16:25] showing our dependence on him and listen
[16:29] he wants that
[16:32] asking is also a reflection of the
[16:37] relationship we have with him. I want
[16:40] you to think about you can't just go up
[16:43] to a stranger and just ask them stuff
[16:45] and you know there has to be a
[16:47] connection a relations and then you feel
[16:49] comfortable to ask that person something
[16:51] like that James 4
[16:54] 2 and 3 said you lust and have not he
[16:58] and desire to have and cannot obtain you
[17:00] fight and war yet he have not because he
[17:03] acts not so you don't have because
[17:07] you're not asking maybe you think God
[17:09] tired
[17:10] Maybe you think that you know you ask so
[17:12] much already. But James is saying you
[17:16] have not because you ask not. And you
[17:18] ask and receive not because you ask
[17:23] amidst that he may consume it upon your
[17:27] lust.
[17:29] Leviticus 20:24 says, "But I've said
[17:32] unto you," God speaks it, "Ye shall
[17:36] inherit their land, their land, and I
[17:39] will give it unto you to possess it, a
[17:43] land that flowth with milk and honey. I
[17:47] am the Lord your God, which have
[17:49] separate you from other people."
[17:54] So prayer is a mean or a key or a tool
[17:59] by which we could ask for our
[18:02] inheritance.
[18:05] God gives what he wants us to ask. I
[18:09] hope this resonate with you tonight. So
[18:12] you cannot sit there like dumb dumb and
[18:15] don't ask. God gives but he want us to
[18:19] ask. He put into place that certain
[18:22] things can only be accessed through
[18:25] prayer. That is how he set it up. Ask of
[18:30] me means that the inheritance is not
[18:34] automatic. It's a promise. Yes. That
[18:37] must be how to say it
[18:41] that you put on the switch. In fact, you
[18:45] flick a switch in your acts in prayer.
[18:49] Ask of me and I will give thee the heen
[18:52] for thy inheritance and the uttermost
[18:55] part of the earth. All right.
[19:02] Now
[19:04] see
[19:06] I want to talk about Caleb.
[19:10] Joshua 14 is a familiar scripture. Then
[19:13] the children of Judah came to Joshua and
[19:15] ga Caleb the son of Jeffa Kzanite said
[19:18] unto him thou knowest the thing that the
[19:20] Lord said unto Moses the man of God
[19:22] concerning me in Keshbania. So Caleb is
[19:25] going back 40 plus years to remind
[19:28] Joshua of what was spoken to him what
[19:31] was belonging to him what was what was
[19:33] given to him. 40 years old when I was
[19:36] with Moses servant of the Lord sent me
[19:37] from Kenishes Bani to estar the land. I
[19:39] brought him word as was in my heart.
[19:42] Nevertheless, my brethren that went up
[19:45] with me made the heart of the people
[19:46] melt like holy for the Lord. And he went
[19:48] on to say, and Moses swear on that day,
[19:50] saying, Surely the land thereof there on
[19:54] thy feet have trodden shall be the
[19:55] inheritance, and thy children forever
[19:57] because thou was holy followed the Lord
[20:00] thou God. Now therefore, behold, the
[20:02] Lord have kept me alive as he had said.
[20:04] Verse 11, as I'm just as strong as I
[20:07] was. Verse 12. Now therefore, there's a
[20:10] part give me this mountain. Note that uh
[20:16] Caleb stepped out as an individual and
[20:19] asks for his. Therefore, the Lord spake
[20:20] in that day, for thou heardest um that
[20:24] the Anakim were there. And so, if the
[20:25] Lord be with me, I shall be able to
[20:27] drive them out as the Lord had said. And
[20:29] Joshua blessed him and give unto Caleb
[20:33] the son of Jeffina Hebron for an
[20:35] inheritance. So it was his inheritance.
[20:37] It was given to him. But he can't just
[20:40] mime it and and think it in the head or
[20:42] think it in the head. He had to ask it.
[20:44] God Caleb remembered what was promised
[20:48] to him all those years before. Caleb did
[20:51] not say quiet. He didn't say silent. And
[20:54] church I believe and I'll get a message
[20:56] on it that each one of us have to come
[21:00] into that position to say give me my
[21:02] mountain. You cannot say that if your
[21:05] life messed up. You cannot say that if
[21:07] you don't have faith. You cannot say
[21:09] that if you don't have a right standing
[21:10] with God. God want you to be in a
[21:12] certain standing that you could be
[21:14] strong enough to step forward. They say
[21:16] what I want. What is mine? What Jesus
[21:18] died for. I want that. So I want to take
[21:22] the next one. I share this with my wife
[21:24] and this one just love this one. This is
[21:26] the daughter of Zillopath.
[21:29] Don't I don't know if I get that
[21:30] pronunciation right. This is from
[21:32] numbers chapter 27 verse 1-8. I love
[21:35] these sisters here. They then came the
[21:37] daughters of Zilofad.
[21:41] Numbers 27:E1
[21:43] the son of Hea the son of Gilead the son
[21:46] of Mashe the son of and and all and and
[21:50] these are the names of his daughters
[21:52] Mala Noah Hogla Mila and Tisha.
[21:58] And they stood before Moses and before
[22:01] Eleazar the priest and before the
[22:03] princes of all the congregation by the
[22:05] drove the tabernacle of the congregation
[22:06] saying our father died in the wilderness
[22:09] and he was not in the company of them
[22:11] that gathered them to get themselves
[22:13] together against the Lord in the company
[22:15] of Kora.
[22:17] But he died in his own sin and had no
[22:20] sons. Why should the name of our father
[22:24] be done away from among his family
[22:26] because he had no son? Give us therefore
[22:30] a possession among the brethren of our
[22:33] father. So these sisters were making a
[22:36] claim and they were presenting it to
[22:38] Moses and asking for inheritance from
[22:41] their father who died who didn't uh line
[22:44] up with Kora and data and all
[22:46] characters. And Moses, here we go. Verse
[22:48] 5, brought their cause before the Lord.
[22:53] And the Lord said unto Moses, Oh, this
[22:55] is beautiful. The daughters of Zilofad,
[22:59] speak right. Thou shalt surely give them
[23:02] a possession of an inheritance among
[23:04] their father's brethren. Thou shalt
[23:06] cause the inheritance of their father to
[23:09] be passed onto them. And thou shalt
[23:11] speak unto the children of Israel,
[23:13] saying, If a man die and have no son,
[23:16] then he shall cause his inheritance to
[23:19] pass unto his daughter. What if those
[23:22] daughters just said, "Well, my father
[23:24] dead, you know, and take it like that."
[23:27] No, they said inheritance. That is how I
[23:30] want you to speak. That is what I want
[23:32] you to see. Sometime in the messages to
[23:35] come, we'll get on into it. Another one
[23:37] we have is Elisha. 2 Kings 2:510. Want
[23:41] to finish quickly. We know the story. I
[23:44] want to get just the end part. And the
[23:47] sons of the prophets were at Jericho
[23:48] came to Elisha and said, "No, you not.
[23:50] Your your master will be taken from your
[23:52] head today." He said, "Yeah, I know it.
[23:53] Hold your peace." So Elisha
[23:57] is coming down to that fine line of
[24:01] where he has to know what he wants. And
[24:04] Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray
[24:06] here, for the Lord has sent me to
[24:07] Jordan. He said, "As the Lord liveth, as
[24:10] I saw liveth, I will not leave thee."
[24:12] And they too went on. 50 men of the son
[24:15] of the prophets went stood a view to a
[24:17] far off, and they two stood by Jordan.
[24:20] And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[24:22] it together, smoked the waters, and they
[24:24] were divided hidden and thither, and
[24:26] they two went on over dry ground. And it
[24:29] came to pass when they were gone over.
[24:33] Note that Elijah never asked this
[24:37] question before. He passed through
[24:39] Bethl, Jericho, Jordan. Now he asked
[24:41] this. And Elijah said to him to Elisha,
[24:43] "Ask what I shall do for you." You're
[24:46] following me. What you want me to do for
[24:48] you before I be taken away from thee?
[24:51] Elijah said, I pray thee, let a double
[24:54] portion of thy spirit be upon me. note
[24:57] he had was to define and ask what he
[25:01] wanted and he said thou has had a had a
[25:05] had to have a a heart thing nevertheless
[25:08] if thou see me when I'm taken it shall
[25:10] be so unto thee but if not it shall not
[25:12] be so so we see the program of God is
[25:16] even though you are destined for the
[25:18] mantle even though you are destined for
[25:21] whatever it is you still have to ask and
[25:24] the final I want to bring to you is from
[25:27] Mark 10 verse 46-52
[25:31] and this is blind Athemus and I love
[25:33] this one 46 says and they came to
[25:36] Jericho and he went out of Jericho his
[25:38] disciples and a great number of people
[25:40] blind Batimus the son of Tamius sat by
[25:44] the highway side begging and when he
[25:46] heard it was Jesus of Nazareth he begin
[25:49] to cry out and say Jesus now oh son of
[25:51] David have mercy on me and many charged
[25:54] him that is and hold his peace. But he
[25:56] cried more a great deal, thou son of
[25:59] David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood
[26:01] still, and commanded him to be called.
[26:05] And they called the blind man, saying
[26:08] unto him, Be of good comfort. Rise, he
[26:12] calleth thee. And he casting away his
[26:16] garment, rose, and came to Jesus. And
[26:19] Jesus answered and said unto him, "This
[26:22] is the bomb." What Jesus ask
[26:25] everybody know he's blind. He could see
[26:27] he is blind. Jesus know the man is
[26:29] blind. So blindness is not the issue.
[26:33] What is the issue then? Hear what Jesus
[26:36] said. What will thou that I should do
[26:40] for thee? In other words, even though
[26:45] the Lord knew his condition,
[26:48] the Lord still wanted him to be clear.
[26:54] Define what is your need and what you
[26:58] want and ask for it. And the Bible
[27:01] continues, the blind man said unto him,
[27:03] Lord, that I may receive my sight.
[27:08] And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way.
[27:11] Thy feet had made thee whole." And
[27:14] immediately he received his sight and
[27:17] follow Jesus in the way. I'll close. So
[27:21] Jesus knew his need
[27:24] yet required him to ask.
[27:27] His asking brought the restoration of
[27:31] his sight. What if the man stood there
[27:33] and say, "I don't know what to say now.
[27:34] I don't know what to say."
[27:37] Well, Jesus couldn't do anything for him
[27:39] because he's asking the question. And if
[27:42] Jesus is to come in here tonight and ask
[27:45] you that question, what is it that you
[27:50] want me to do for you tonight? What
[27:52] would you ask? So John 16
[27:56] 23 says, "And that day, at that day, in
[27:58] that day, you shall ask me nothing.
[28:00] Verily I say unto you, I say unto you,
[28:02] whatsoever you shall ask the Father in
[28:04] my name, he will give it to you.
[28:07] Hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[28:09] name. Ask and you shall receive that
[28:13] your joy may be full. Ephesians 3:20 and
[28:17] we close. Now unto him that is able to
[28:22] do exceedingly abundantly
[28:25] above all that we can ask or think
[28:29] according to the power that workketh in
[28:32] us. Just think about it. God is able to
[28:36] do above and beyond what you could even
[28:39] ask.
[28:41] And we are not asking as we should.
[28:45] The prophet said ask for big things.
[28:48] to great things. The devil job is not
[28:51] only to depress you and frustrate you,
[28:54] but to put a weight on your top lip that
[28:57] your top lip meet your bottom lip and
[28:59] you ask nothing.
[29:01] You grind through. You grumble through.
[29:04] You complain through. You open your lips
[29:07] and instead of praise is a complain.
[29:10] Instead of a worship, it's a negative
[29:13] something coming up. God doesn't want
[29:16] who do you imagine tonight in your house
[29:20] God coming to you and said what is it
[29:23] you want me to do for you? I brought a
[29:26] word for you tonight. Ask of me. You're
[29:30] not asking your uncle. You're not asking
[29:32] your wife, your husband, your children.
[29:35] Ask of me. He is the source of your
[29:39] strength. He is the one that brought you
[29:41] through all the years. You had
[29:42] successes. You had failures, but the
[29:46] source of your life has been him. He's
[29:50] the one that make you stagger out of
[29:52] this and stagger into that. You didn't
[29:54] bring yourself out. He brought you out.
[29:57] You didn't give yourself ability, he
[29:59] gave you ability. You didn't give
[30:01] yourself gifts. He gave you gifts. What
[30:04] are you doing with it? He said, "Ask of
[30:07] me." You have not because you're asking.
[30:12] Won't you ask tonight? Ask hard things.
[30:15] Don't pray the regular prayer. Do as if
[30:18] Jesus himself is asking that question to
[30:21] you personally tonight.
[30:24] What is it that you want me to do for
[30:25] you? Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[30:28] Father, I thank you tonight for these
[30:30] three words. Ask of me. We're not asking
[30:33] of a man. We asking of you. We asking of
[30:35] you for revival. We asking of you for
[30:37] deliverance. We asking of you for
[30:39] healing. We asking you for financial
[30:41] breakthrough, for spiritual
[30:42] breakthrough, for family breakthrough,
[30:44] for marital breakthrough. We are asking
[30:46] of you for revival to strike the church.
[30:48] Lord, we asking of you to stir up the
[30:50] people's spirit and to bring them out of
[30:52] lethargy and sluggness and slackness. Oh
[30:54] God, help us tonight. Lord, you said we
[30:56] don't ask enough. We don't ask for hard
[30:59] things. Oh God, won't you send down the
[31:01] capstone, the headstone? Would you send
[31:02] down that anointing that's that that you
[31:05] said the the the dynamics of this church
[31:07] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost?
[31:09] You promise to pull dynamics in the
[31:10] mechanics. You promise a super church, a
[31:12] super race. Oh God, strengthen your
[31:14] people tonight. Heal the sick in our
[31:16] midst. Touch the heart cases. Father, we
[31:18] ask for your miracle working power to
[31:20] begin to work tonight. May we get
[31:22] testimony after testimony of testimony
[31:24] of deliverance, of breakthrough, of
[31:26] healing, of restoration, of forgiveness,
[31:28] of cleansing, of revival. Oh, Father,
[31:31] stir your people up tonight. May set
[31:33] their souls on fire that they'll have to
[31:35] share it with somebody. They'll have to
[31:36] testify to somebody. They'll have to let
[31:38] the steam out. Oh God, grant it tonight
[31:41] as they get on in prayer. May your
[31:43] presence be with them in a special way.
[31:45] Look over the homes, Lord of the family.
[31:47] Look over the elders, Father. All the
[31:49] senior ones, the grain ones with gray
[31:51] hair, Father, long in the vineyard. Give
[31:53] them a touch. Touch these Calebs,
[31:55] Father, tonight. Touch the young people
[31:56] tonight. Touch the believers tonight.
[31:58] Touch your church from the Oh, God, from
[32:00] the purple to the backbench. May your
[32:02] revival spirit begin to work tonight as
[32:04] they ask of you. May they not be lazy in
[32:07] asking. One thing they should not be
[32:09] lazy in asking. And they could knock on
[32:11] your door, Lord, and say, "Lord, I'm
[32:13] here again. I'm here again." You don't
[32:16] not even give us just inheritance, but
[32:18] you give us our families as an
[32:19] inheritance. Oh, God. Adam lost his
[32:21] life. He lost his inheritance in life.
[32:23] And here we are, Lord, looking for a
[32:25] full restoration. What they had in the
[32:27] beginning. You said alpha and omega.
[32:29] What the church had in the beginning is
[32:31] what they're going to have in the
[32:32] ending. You and your house shall be
[32:34] saved. That is what they had in the
[32:35] beginning. That is what they had in the
[32:37] book of Acts. Not you and not your
[32:39] house. You and your house. Regardless of
[32:41] what condition they in, we are believing
[32:43] you to make a work upon their hearts and
[32:45] lives to change and transform them.
[32:47] Father God, may as they get on in
[32:49] prayer, the angel of God pass by and
[32:51] give them a special touch tonight. In
[32:53] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. So
[32:56] saints, I trust the Lord that this
[32:58] little session here will be a blessing
[33:00] to you, will help you and encourage you
[33:02] to know that God is still on the throne
[33:05] and he wants to bless you tonight. So
[33:07] God bless you as we get on in prayer.
[33:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.

[1:27:31] confirm your presence among us in Jesus
[1:27:33] name I ask it amen and amen saints as we
[1:27:36] leave I want to leave you with the
[1:27:38] scripture
[1:27:40] And it's from Isaiah 40. It says, "Hast
[1:27:42] thou not known?" Verse 28. "Hast thou
[1:27:44] not heard that the everlasting God, the
[1:27:47] Lord, the creator of the ends of the
[1:27:49] earth, faintth not? Neither is weary.
[1:27:52] There is no searching of his
[1:27:54] understanding. He giveth power to the
[1:27:56] faint, and to them that have no might.
[1:27:59] He increaseth strength. Even the youth
[1:28:02] shall be faint, and shall be faint and
[1:28:04] be weary, but the young man shall
[1:28:05] utterly fail. But they that wait upon
[1:28:08] the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:28:10] They shall mount on the wings as eagles.
[1:28:12] They shall run not be weary. They shall
[1:28:15] walk and not faint. So I want to remind
[1:28:18] you that door God don't get weary. He
[1:28:22] actually give power to the faint. You're
[1:28:25] feeling distress. You're feeling
[1:28:26] faintish power is promised to you. He
[1:28:30] come to give strength to the weak. May
[1:28:32] God bless you. looking forward to see
[1:28:35] you on Sunday that you would, you know,
[1:28:38] be alive and to go on and to think that
[1:28:41] God called you to a high order in this
[1:28:43] hour to start revival right in your
[1:28:46] home, right in your heart, right in your
[1:28:48] life. And for three words, ask of me.
[1:28:52] Nobody could stop you asking of him. No
[1:28:55] man, no preacher, no bishop, no church.
[1:28:58] Ask of him and he will give you. Ask and
[1:29:01] you shall receive. May God bless you.
[1:29:03] Have a great weekend. God be with you.
