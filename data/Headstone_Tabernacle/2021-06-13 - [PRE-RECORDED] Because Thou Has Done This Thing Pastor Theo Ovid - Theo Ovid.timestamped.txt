[29:53] have been
[29:54] getting away from their homes but we
[29:55] pray that your hand of protection be
[29:57] upon their lives
[29:58] for we are living in trouble as times
[30:01] where the bible prophesy
[30:02] that we're going to see the beginning of

[30:25] you will be seated
[30:27] don't just give god some praises
[30:34] amen
[30:41] [Applause]
[30:48] hallelujah all glory
[30:51] surely surely surely the presence of god
[30:54] is in this place
[30:56] bring greetings amen from africa from
[30:59] uganda
[31:00] and what a tremendous time we had
[31:02] meetings day in uganda
[31:04] and some of you may know some of you may
[31:06] not know but but uh john cecconi
[31:08] pastor who who's pastor he lost his wife
[31:11] maybe about a month and a half ago
[31:13] and you know he was testifying and
[31:15] saying that many people thought he would
[31:16] have canceled meetings
[31:18] but man he had real faith and god
[31:21] blessed him
[31:22] and god bless the meetings in a powerful
[31:24] powerful way
[31:25] [Music]
[31:27] and uh sometimes you have no
[31:30] idea what some of these believers and
[31:32] people go through
[31:33] saving the lord in their countries and
[31:35] so on and
[31:36] because of the opportunity to travel
[31:38] that we see it you know and um
[31:40] we see how god bless fate and sacrifice
[31:42] amen god just god bless laziness and
[31:44] sloppiness and you know the best
[31:46] he blessed faith and sacrifice and um
[31:50] it had over 1 500 believers and over 100
[31:53] pastors was there
[31:55] we have ministers from both uganda and
[31:57] kenya other parts of africa
[31:59] that came to this meeting it was
[32:00] glorious mighty old point of the spirit
[32:04] there's one time where john county was
[32:05] preaching and that was preaching
[32:07] actually he was talking a little bit
[32:08] before service
[32:09] all of a sudden he just got silent just
[32:11] silent i've never seen anything like
[32:12] that he said
[32:12] he always said he never saw anything
[32:14] like that silent like you could hear a
[32:16] pinfall he said but it is silent
[32:18] and all of a sudden the holy spirit
[32:19] begin to pour out it's not it's not the
[32:21] work of man
[32:22] it's god's work all of a sudden and
[32:25] that's before scripture before scripture
[32:26] was read
[32:27] so it's really powerful to see how the
[32:30] unity
[32:30] and the seatings coming together come
[32:32] into place
[32:34] and uh you have to have a heart for this
[32:36] it has to be in your heart
[32:39] whatever has to come to true to you it
[32:41] has to be in your heart
[32:42] you can't be hoping you have to have a
[32:44] divine revelation and i trust
[32:46] this morning that this word that we're
[32:48] going to be speaking to you
[32:49] would touch your heart and stick to your
[32:51] heart we appreciate brother stephen
[32:53] last sunday
[32:54] [Music]
[32:58] deliver i appreciate that service amen
[33:01] praise the lord amen his words
[33:04] but as i come behind him about how to
[33:05] die about denying yourself
[33:08] and that's what people find it so hard
[33:10] to do
[33:11] they want god to meet them at their
[33:13] level they don't want to come to god's
[33:15] level
[33:16] they want to be as they are live as they
[33:18] are natural and
[33:19] everything must work out just as you
[33:20] want it just as you desire i remember
[33:22] because you
[33:23] and fine no fight no problem no
[33:25] challenges
[33:26] and and that must be your life and god
[33:28] said big fat no amen
[33:30] he said every son that committed god
[33:32] must be
[33:33] tested must be tried he said that you
[33:37] have those spoiled children
[33:38] we spoil our children but god don't have
[33:40] any spoiled children
[33:42] amen so this morning we want to stand up
[33:44] we want to change the order of service
[33:45] and go into the word
[33:46] we want to turn our bibles to hebrews
[33:48] chapter 11.
[33:50] i want to read from verse one to six
[33:51] genesis chapter 22
[33:53] verse 15 to 18 and matthew chapter 7
[33:58] verse 24 to 29
[34:00] i want to greet all those who connected
[34:01] to us on the internet
[34:03] would far and wide god bless you we're
[34:06] happy to hear
[34:07] we're here to serve amen read in genesis
[34:11] hebrews chapter 11.
[34:16] now faith is a substance of things hope
[34:18] for the evidence of things not seen
[34:20] for by the elders obtain a good report
[34:22] through faith we understand
[34:24] that the worlds were framed by the word
[34:26] of god so that things which are seen
[34:29] were not made of things which do appear
[34:31] by faith evil offered unto god a more
[34:34] excellent sacrifice than cain
[34:35] by which he obtained witness that he was
[34:37] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[34:40] and by it he being dead yet speak it by
[34:42] faith enoch
[34:44] was translated that he should not see
[34:45] death i was not found
[34:47] because god had translated him for
[34:50] before his translation he had this
[34:52] testimony that he pleased god
[34:54] but without faith is impossible to
[34:56] please him
[34:58] for he that cometh to god must believe
[34:59] that he is that he's a rewarder of them
[35:02] that diligently
[35:03] seek him genesis chapter 22 verse 15
[35:07] to 18.
[35:16] and the angel of the lord called unto
[35:18] abram out of heaven the second time
[35:20] and said by myself have i
[35:24] sworn said the lord for because thou has
[35:27] done this
[35:28] thing and has not withheld thy son
[35:32] and only son that in blessing i will
[35:34] bless thee
[35:35] and multiply and i will multiply thy
[35:37] seed as the stars of the heaven
[35:39] as the sun which is upon the seashore
[35:42] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[35:44] his enemies and thy seed
[35:46] shall all the nations of the earth be
[35:47] blessed because thou has obeyed
[35:50] my voice the last scripture matthew
[35:52] chapter 7
[35:55] reading from verse 24
[36:04] therefore whosoever inherit these sins
[36:08] of mine
[36:10] and do with them i would liken him
[36:13] unto a wise man who built his house upon
[36:17] a rock
[36:18] and the rain descended and the floods
[36:21] came
[36:21] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[36:24] house and it fell naught for it was
[36:26] founded upon a rock
[36:28] and everyone that here at these scenes
[36:30] of mine
[36:31] and do it them not shall be like
[36:34] likened unto a foolish man which built
[36:37] his house upon the sand
[36:39] and the rain descended the floods came
[36:42] the winds blew
[36:43] and beat upon the house and it fell and
[36:46] great
[36:47] was the fall of it and it came to pass
[36:48] when jesus had ended these scenes
[36:51] the people were astonished at his
[36:53] doctrine
[36:55] for he taught them as one having
[36:57] authority
[36:58] and not as described so this boy has

[37:09] we pray you're coming now reveal an
[37:11] anointing and spirit and reveal your
[37:13] word to your people that the leader with
[37:14] a rock and their souls are rocking their
[37:16] heart
[37:17] a rock of revelation father come and
[37:19] confirm a word with signs
[37:20] wonders and miracles we ask in jesus
[37:22] name or pour your spirit upon your
[37:24] people this morning amen and amen you
[37:26] may be seated
[37:36] this morning i have a title
[37:40] because thou has done this thing
[37:44] as a title because god has done
[37:48] this thing and have an inspiration
[37:52] the angel is here to drive you back
[37:56] to the tree of life
[37:59] angel is here to drive you back to the
[38:01] tree of life
[38:02] other context scripture i'd like to read
[38:04] now which is from
[38:06] revelation chapter four and it reads
[38:08] after this i looked and behold a door
[38:10] was open heaven
[38:11] and the first voice which i heard was as
[38:13] well trumpet talking with me
[38:15] which said come up hither i will show
[38:17] the things which must be hereafter
[38:19] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[38:21] behold a throne
[38:22] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[38:25] throne and he that sat was to look upon
[38:27] like
[38:27] jasper and saddam stone and there was a
[38:29] rainbow wrong about a throne in a sight
[38:31] like on an emerald
[38:33] and wrong about the throne were 420
[38:35] seats and upon the seats i saw 420
[38:38] elders sitting
[38:39] closing in white arrangement and they
[38:40] had on their heads crowned of gold and
[38:42] out of the throne proceed lightnings
[38:44] thunders thunderings and voices and
[38:47] there were seven lamps of fire
[38:48] burning before the troll which are the
[38:51] seven spirits of god
[38:53] and before the throne there was a sea of
[38:55] glass like unto a crystal and a midst of
[38:57] the throne
[38:58] wrong about the throne were four beasts
[39:01] full of eyes
[39:02] before and behind first beast was like a
[39:05] lion
[39:05] second beast like a calf the third beast
[39:08] had a face as a man
[39:10] the fourth beast was like a flying eagle
[39:12] and the four piece
[39:13] had each of them six swings about him
[39:16] they were full of eyes within
[39:18] and the rest not day and night saying
[39:19] holy holy lord god almighty
[39:22] which was which is and is to come
[39:26] and we find out that this book of
[39:27] revelation we know
[39:29] is a book of symbols all the beasts and
[39:32] all the things that you're hearing is
[39:34] represent something
[39:35] it means something is not just idly
[39:38] placed here
[39:39] there's a purpose behind every scripture
[39:41] every word that god speaks
[39:43] in that bible okay here we go
[39:46] but from this is from melchizedek the
[39:49] great prince and king
[39:50] there are three elements that a man
[39:52] follows
[39:55] first is humanistic second
[39:58] is divine revelation and third
[40:01] is vision that is thus saith the lord
[40:07] so the majority of humans walk in the
[40:09] earth follow the humanistic realm
[40:12] that's the realm of your five senses as
[40:14] a realm of your emotions and your
[40:16] feelings
[40:17] and this one hurts you and you're
[40:19] troubled and everything else that's just
[40:20] humanistic above that level
[40:24] is the realm of divine revelation
[40:28] so from a humanistic standpoint sarah
[40:30] couldn't have a child
[40:32] from a natural standpoint ibrahim is too
[40:34] old
[40:35] but from a revelation standpoint isaac
[40:37] is coming
[40:38] [Applause]
[40:42] if he lives at the humanistic realm he
[40:44] will doubt god
[40:45] he can't come to the spot to believe he
[40:48] will have that child
[40:50] but the bible said abram believed god
[40:53] to do that he had to jump over his
[40:55] humanistic
[40:56] [Applause]
[41:00] to believe in the divine revelation of
[41:02] what god said to him
[41:04] that he amidst his trying times could
[41:07] say god said so
[41:09] whatever proof you have god said so
[41:11] sorry i can't show you this but
[41:13] god said so and god is not a man that
[41:16] would lie
[41:17] if god said it it's gonna come to pass
[41:20] if god said it it would materialize
[41:23] if god said it he don't need no help
[41:26] to bring it to pass
[41:30] which realm are you following this
[41:32] morning
[41:35] hallelujah is the only tree
[41:38] [Music]
[41:40] let your mother say or your father say
[41:41] or your uncle or your brother
[41:43] or your grandmother say that's them
[41:45] saying what did god say
[41:46] amen well my feelings tell me and i feel
[41:49] so
[41:50] and i dream this last night i have
[41:51] nothing to do with that i want to know
[41:53] what god said
[41:55] i don't want to hear about your dream i
[41:56] don't want to hear about your feelings i
[41:58] don't want to hear about human spirit
[41:59] i don't want to hear about your emotions
[42:01] i want to hear what god said
[42:03] [Music]
[42:03] [Applause]
[42:07] [Music]
[42:08] hallelujah red sea in front
[42:13] mountains on both sides coming behind
[42:17] and the people demanding what is going
[42:20] on moses
[42:21] and moses began to whimper and cry and
[42:24] god
[42:24] said why cry unto me
[42:28] speak and move forward moses backslid
[42:32] and fell from faith into the humanistic
[42:35] realm
[42:36] behind the anna rock the crowd to god
[42:38] god rebuked him
[42:40] push him forward don't talk like that
[42:43] don't think like that
[42:45] don't walk like that don't express that
[42:48] it walk fit speak for it
[42:51] act it lift it the josh shall live thy
[42:54] faith
[42:55] okay the lord i shout in the house
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:09] oh the human instagram can't help you
[43:12] much
[43:13] in expected to live here i think they
[43:15] say nice that's your taste
[43:18] a feeling is that you're feeling
[43:19] emotions your affection and so
[43:21] that that's nice but to take beyond that
[43:25] they take a higher order you take a
[43:27] higher pull
[43:29] and that's the pull of divine revelation
[43:31] he says again the third element is
[43:33] vision
[43:34] or i'll pray again the three elements
[43:36] that people dwell in the first one is
[43:37] humanistic
[43:39] you like the stars the fashion the world
[43:41] and things that i'm taking on this one
[43:42] have that and this one's going
[43:43] and i'm a friend doing this and i want
[43:46] to do that too
[43:49] this one pulling here that one pulling
[43:50] only humanistic
[43:54] right and then the next one is
[43:56] revelation
[43:57] that's isn't that's when something done
[43:59] on your heart anchors it
[44:01] and says it's going to happen then
[44:03] something could happen
[44:04] i remember doing the government exams
[44:07] the
[44:07] pastor get employment and um
[44:12] you know yeah they gave up the same time
[44:14] to do the exams and so on
[44:16] and i know this girl know what she's
[44:17] studying and studying i i think
[44:19] you know they did it for some fail but i
[44:21] i i didn't do it
[44:23] this time that she did it and something
[44:25] tell me i'm going to pass this time
[44:27] and what i studied is what come what she
[44:29] studied did not come but i had faith in
[44:30] my heart
[44:31] that i was going to succeed and i did
[44:34] that was something else it was almost
[44:36] like if it's like a revelation
[44:38] that i'm going to get through so i'm not
[44:40] coward at what i study i have to believe
[44:42] that what i am studying right now
[44:44] discovering the people so it's not that
[44:46] i will say i'm not going to study i'm
[44:47] going to study
[44:48] a little thing before the exam and what
[44:50] that little thing that come
[44:52] don't go and do that you know make sure
[44:53] i study it don't take that as
[45:00] and that third element is vision which
[45:03] is the word of the lord
[45:04] made manifest when you see it and it's
[45:07] thus
[45:08] saith the lord that's like what a
[45:09] brother but a brahmana mad when he was
[45:11] in india
[45:12] i think it was india and um
[45:15] some blind man or something like that
[45:17] and he brought him forth and and the
[45:18] lord showing that he'll be healed and he
[45:20] said if this man
[45:21] how much will give this heart life to
[45:23] jesus christ if this god opened his eyes
[45:25] at this blind man worshipping the son
[45:26] and go open the eyes with blind man that
[45:28] was thus said the lord he had a vision
[45:30] it couldn't feel and so on
[45:31] so that's the three elements isn't that
[45:32] right the third is vision
[45:34] that is dusty at the lord that is
[45:37] perfect that is positive
[45:39] when you break into vision isn't that
[45:41] right
[45:42] now back in genesis everything started
[45:46] in the beginning
[45:47] there were two boys king
[45:50] and evil not ten just two boys
[45:53] amen and god invite them
[45:57] to worship all right let's see they'll
[46:00] get this quickly
[46:04] the other fine i'll read it and in the
[46:06] process of time
[46:08] this is genesis chapter four it came to
[46:10] pass that cain brought forth the fruit
[46:14] of the ground as an offering unto the
[46:16] lord
[46:17] and abel also brought forth the first
[46:19] name of his flock and of the father of
[46:20] and the lord had respect unto evil and
[46:22] his offering
[46:23] under the king and his offering he had
[46:25] not respects and king was very wrought
[46:27] his consonants fell and the lord said
[46:30] unto the king why are thou
[46:31] wrought why are thy countenance fallen
[46:33] if thou doest well
[46:34] shall thou be accepted and if thou doest
[46:38] not wealth in light at the door
[46:40] and unto thee shall be his desire though
[46:42] shall rule over him
[46:43] and we know the story can come and kill
[46:45] evil but god
[46:46] actually challenged them to come to the
[46:48] altar to make the offering one bring
[46:50] fruits
[46:51] of his interpretation the other one just
[46:53] take a lamb and kill it
[46:54] and that blood come out and god said
[46:56] send fire
[46:58] upon that offering and vindicated abel's
[47:00] offering and that's why i read the
[47:01] scripture by faith abel offered a
[47:03] sacrifice
[47:04] which god confirmed that he was
[47:05] righteous because he break into a realm
[47:08] where it wasn't his ability or works
[47:10] or laboring it'll feel and planting and
[47:12] reaping it was a lamb he took
[47:14] a blood something that struck him isn't
[47:16] that right it was revealed to him
[47:18] so brother branham says uh those boys
[47:21] after seeing that have been made mortal
[47:23] and was going to die here we go they
[47:26] tried to find favor with god
[47:29] they both come making a sacrifice and if
[47:32] god only require religion
[47:34] then cain was justified king was just as
[47:37] believing as evil
[47:38] believed cain came with a sacrifice just
[47:39] as abel came with a sacrifice
[47:41] but cain's sacrifice was by works he
[47:43] raised his garden
[47:44] he brought his fruit the best he could
[47:46] find but abel
[47:48] was justified by fate because he come
[47:50] with a lamb
[47:52] oh could we give god praises for that
[47:54] hallelujah
[47:56] praise the name of the lord watch now
[47:59] when cain came and knelt down and built
[48:01] an altar
[48:02] i imagine they come to the east side of
[48:04] the gate and there is where the angels
[48:05] stood with this flaming sword
[48:07] you remember what happened when they got
[48:08] run out of gardener eden angels will
[48:10] stay with flaming sword
[48:12] to guard the tree of life that man in
[48:15] that goodness wouldn't partake of the
[48:17] tree of life
[48:18] and have eternal life in that terrible
[48:19] condition so the angel was sent to guard
[48:22] it
[48:22] to block man from participating about it
[48:25] isn't that right
[48:27] so watch the angel stood with his
[48:29] flaming sword god in the tree of life by
[48:31] the way
[48:32] he was guarding the people away
[48:36] from the tree of life but now
[48:39] he is trying to drive the people
[48:42] back to the tree of life and you know
[48:45] what history of life is right that's
[48:48] jesus christ
[48:49] isn't that right now jesus was our tree
[48:51] of life
[48:52] the woman was the tree of death
[48:55] we are the fruit of our mother she was
[48:58] the fruit tree
[48:59] by woman come dead and by woman come
[49:02] life which is true
[49:03] mary virgin born is not right but that
[49:06] person had to die
[49:07] but the man born of the spirit of god
[49:09] never dies
[49:10] going to church making a sacrifice
[49:13] worshipping god
[49:14] if that's all that god requires he will
[49:17] be cruel to condemn a man that met that
[49:20] requirement
[49:20] amen but you see there's a way to seem
[49:22] right unto a man
[49:24] but at the end there is death there's a
[49:26] way that god comes
[49:28] and that's the only way you are ever
[49:30] going to get there
[49:32] are you listening to me praise god
[49:35] that's the only way
[49:37] you're going to get there no there's a
[49:39] way that oh god i know you
[49:41] and it's the way that god provides for
[49:42] you and the whole bible
[49:44] is built upon revelation
[49:47] the entire bible so when you come to
[49:49] church you already come to get in the
[49:51] spirit
[49:52] and not just get information you could
[49:54] see a woman read information
[49:56] but when you come to church you get an
[49:58] opportunity for the spirit
[49:59] to come upon you and take this
[50:02] information and transform it
[50:03] into revelation then it's not
[50:06] information to you
[50:07] it's revealed to you then you could
[50:10] worship
[50:11] then they could shout then they could
[50:13] bring your offer into the altar
[50:15] then fire to fall upon you listen it's
[50:18] already the substance
[50:19] of what you're hoping for it's not yet
[50:22] but you believe it will be
[50:24] that's revelation it's not yet but you
[50:27] believe it will be
[50:28] you believe god bless you it's not yet
[50:31] but you believe it will be
[50:33] you believe god will heal you it's not
[50:35] yet but you believe it will be
[50:48] these men natural men we call following
[50:51] them and say what do men say i am
[50:53] you see some men say you're this i
[50:54] mentioned that he's who do you say i am
[50:56] and they got caught they didn't know who
[50:58] he was all of a sudden peter broke
[51:00] them but they were the christ the son of
[51:02] the living god
[51:03] and jesus said flesh and blood didn't
[51:05] reveal that
[51:06] unto you but my father it has not
[51:09] revealed it unto you
[51:10] and upon this rock i will build my
[51:12] church
[51:13] not some church building my church and
[51:15] the case of i will never prevail against
[51:17] it
[51:18] it means once that rock strikes your
[51:21] soul lord devil anger
[51:23] take that prophet you can fight with it
[51:25] but he can't take it

[51:31] there is something inside of you that's
[51:33] why you say amen to the world
[51:35] that's why you fall down get back up get
[51:38] something inside of you
[51:39] that the devil can't take off he didn't
[51:41] put it he can't take it out

[51:46] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[51:50] that's why god gonna find his seed
[51:52] everywhere back fighting can't keep them
[51:54] seized back
[51:55] that lion's den cassicles fiery furnace
[51:59] sickness no wonder paul said what shall

[53:17] there is just a small piece
[53:19] a break in timing a brick of eternity a
[53:22] kink
[53:23] an eternity called time and god put you
[53:25] here
[53:26] to live for him and to honor him and to
[53:28] bring forth seas of righteousness
[53:30] to bring forth more evils praise god and
[53:33] this time king can't kill it
[53:36] this time we're going in the rapture
[53:38] this time we go for translation power
[53:41] we're going for rapture and faith isn't
[53:42] that right oh glory to god
[53:45] hallelujah so therefore
[53:48] you can't build the church upon
[53:50] sensation you can't build it
[53:52] on nothing else but christ which is the
[53:54] revelation of jesus christ
[53:57] question do you have
[54:00] a revelation of jesus christ amen

[1:17:30] way twisted down trees
[1:17:32] and everyone was warned to get to safety
[1:17:34] he thought of his neighbor who had a
[1:17:36] chicken farm
[1:17:37] had some light buildings with their
[1:17:38] chickens in them
[1:17:40] brew the houses so for pens and they had
[1:17:43] in
[1:17:44] his life was tied up with them chickens
[1:17:46] for the living
[1:17:47] he rushed quickly frantically up to the
[1:17:49] gate and stopped his car
[1:17:50] jump out said to the fellow take all the
[1:17:52] chickens
[1:17:53] put them in your storm shelter you rush
[1:17:55] over to mine because there's coming a
[1:17:57] typhoon a storm
[1:17:58] that's going to twist everything down
[1:18:00] that's what he's sharing with his
[1:18:01] neighbor
[1:18:02] all right the man stood looking in the
[1:18:04] face and laughed at him he said nonsense
[1:18:06] i have heard them predict such a thing
[1:18:08] before and it never happened
[1:18:10] and the christian neighbor was so
[1:18:11] excited he said but what if it does
[1:18:13] happen
[1:18:14] we we we hear remarks like along the
[1:18:16] line i've heard of this going to happen
[1:18:18] and what's going to happen and it's
[1:18:20] going to happen one of these days but it
[1:18:21] behooves us
[1:18:23] to listen to every warning but this man
[1:18:25] said i have no time for this foolishness
[1:18:27] i raise chickens i have no time for such
[1:18:30] he cried out the neighbor said in the
[1:18:31] name of god
[1:18:32] leave those chickens alone john come
[1:18:34] quickly you and your family
[1:18:36] if you don't want to believe it let your
[1:18:37] family come he said i will not have my
[1:18:38] children to be excited over a few radio
[1:18:41] warnings my children and i
[1:18:42] have decided we will live as i live my
[1:18:44] wife will listen to me because i am the
[1:18:46] breadwinner of this hole
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:51] and she must listen to me i am the boss
[1:18:52] here
[1:18:54] and i will not have my children all
[1:18:56] excited to talk about some nonsense
[1:19:00] and the neighbor turned he went to his
[1:19:02] home into the shelter
[1:19:04] all of a sudden the cloud was upon him
[1:19:06] before he knew it
[1:19:08] that's the way judgment strikes
[1:19:12] it comes so sudden you wonder how it can
[1:19:15] get there so quick
[1:19:17] how i have seen cruel men who once chris
[1:19:19] god fall and scream and say how could
[1:19:21] you treat me this way
[1:19:22] the whole foundation swept out from
[1:19:24] under him in a moment
[1:19:26] it pays to take warning you might laugh
[1:19:28] at the messenger
[1:19:30] you might be able even able to kill him
[1:19:32] but you cannot kill the message
[1:19:38] it will go on just the same
[1:19:41] while the storm swept the country it
[1:19:43] caught the chicken house
[1:19:45] the farmer they never found his body
[1:19:48] his wife frantically fighting
[1:19:51] they live close to the great okeechobee
[1:19:53] lake and the waters begin to rise as a
[1:19:55] typhoon lifted waters all the way from
[1:19:56] the bottom of the lake
[1:19:58] and that's what make it so dangerous the
[1:20:00] boats rock how the waves come up and
[1:20:02] turn the boats beneath them
[1:20:04] the storm come up swirls picks them up
[1:20:06] for miles the water is sweeping
[1:20:07] until the mother knows there was no hope
[1:20:09] you were to get a chair into the top of
[1:20:10] the building
[1:20:12] she got to the top of the building with
[1:20:13] the children hold on to the chimney of
[1:20:15] the house
[1:20:17] and the wildlife the cottonmouth
[1:20:18] moccasin i believe a more deadly snake
[1:20:20] than your diamond
[1:20:21] back rattler they were calling for
[1:20:23] safety
[1:20:25] and they come up on the roof also with
[1:20:26] her and by
[1:20:28] listening to her husband listen
[1:20:30] carefully
[1:20:32] by listening to a husband not taking
[1:20:35] heat to the warning
[1:20:37] so this is not a family warning
[1:20:39] hallelujah
[1:20:40] this is an individual warning
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:57] and by listening to our husband not a
[1:20:59] key to the warning
[1:21:00] she stomped she beat she had to stand
[1:21:02] and watch was vicious snake bite her
[1:21:04] children
[1:21:05] until they die on the roof and the
[1:21:07] mother herself was bitten so much until
[1:21:10] she died
[1:21:11] and that's the only way we got the story
[1:21:12] after the storm acquired and search
[1:21:14] parties hunting for buddies
[1:21:15] they found a lane on the top of the roof
[1:21:17] with a children laying by a side
[1:21:19] it appears to take warning the first
[1:21:23] thing to do before there can be a
[1:21:24] warning
[1:21:25] there had to be a preparation made for
[1:21:26] safety
[1:21:28] so what do you tell them in florida
[1:21:30] there is a safety place
[1:21:32] leave your house and get the deer it
[1:21:34] have food there you have dead deer you
[1:21:36] know whatever it is
[1:21:37] the structure can withstand the storm go
[1:21:38] there so before god could give a warning
[1:21:41] they have to be a safe place
[1:21:47] isn't that right and the warning is only
[1:21:51] a voice
[1:21:52] of one having you to prepare for the
[1:21:54] danger there has to be a preparation
[1:21:56] made first
[1:21:58] and if the preparation is made then the
[1:22:00] warning can go forward
[1:22:02] to cause you to make a decision
[1:22:06] because god has done this
[1:22:09] thing the warning challenges you
[1:22:13] to make a decision life is about
[1:22:16] decisions
[1:22:17] about actions about what people do
[1:22:21] isn't that right quota is the same
[1:22:23] method
[1:22:24] whether you listen to it or not if you
[1:22:26] don't want to listen to it
[1:22:27] that's up to you if you listen to it
[1:22:30] there is safety
[1:22:31] jesus if you don't listen and do it what
[1:22:33] he says you're full
[1:22:34] you're foolish man if you're listening
[1:22:36] to what he said you're a wise person
[1:22:38] that's the problem today about young
[1:22:39] people don't want to listen you want to
[1:22:41] do their own thing
[1:22:42] because they feel their heat on this
[1:22:43] side of energy on this side they have
[1:22:44] time on the side you don't have that
[1:22:46] amen amen you have to have god on your
[1:22:48] side
[1:22:50] so god has the same method we work on
[1:22:53] god's method in that way
[1:22:55] in the early days when the people got so
[1:22:57] wicked god could not look
[1:22:59] upon it he has laws when those laws are
[1:23:01] broken
[1:23:02] has no penalty there isn't a law the
[1:23:05] reason that there is a law
[1:23:07] it has to have a penalty for it to be a
[1:23:08] law if there is no penalty there is no
[1:23:11] law
[1:23:12] just do what you're doing you break the
[1:23:13] red light there's no charge there's no
[1:23:14] ticket you go over speed there's no
[1:23:16] ticket there's no there's no law then
[1:23:17] everybody do their own thing
[1:23:19] but the reason they have a penalty it's
[1:23:20] just a law however the law goes a
[1:23:22] penalty
[1:23:23] there's a price isn't that right watch
[1:23:26] so any law that's broken has no penalty
[1:23:28] isn't the law you cannot break the laws
[1:23:30] of god but without having to pay
[1:23:32] for it somewhere you must do it be sure
[1:23:35] your sins don't find you out
[1:23:38] there only to watch so therefore many
[1:23:40] people think smoking cigarette is a sin
[1:23:42] it isn't many people think that lion is
[1:23:44] a sin it isn't committed adultery isn't
[1:23:45] a sin these are attributes of unbelief
[1:23:48] the only two things either you believe
[1:23:50] or you're unbeliever
[1:23:52] if you believe you don't do this thing
[1:23:55] amen so when you are born you are born
[1:23:58] from above
[1:23:59] and you have the holy spirit coming from
[1:24:01] god listen
[1:24:02] that changes your nature no matter your
[1:24:06] sister your mother your best friend
[1:24:07] could be dressed that way
[1:24:09] but the christian that's born of the
[1:24:10] spirit of god is born from above
[1:24:12] their spirit is of another kingdom
[1:24:15] you are ruled or governed from above
[1:24:18] your influences even your hair style is
[1:24:21] from above
[1:24:22] it influences not what hollywood have
[1:24:24] your clothing is not influenced by
[1:24:26] hollywood
[1:24:27] it's influence from above
[1:24:32] isn't that right
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:35] i'm so glad the simpleness of the holy
[1:24:37] spirit to follow it
[1:24:39] watch it how it behaves
[1:24:42] and makes you believe now here we go
[1:24:45] the holy spirit will not
[1:24:49] misbehave itself in one person and
[1:24:51] behave itself in another person
[1:24:54] amen so that's why
[1:24:57] it's so flimsy when people say i don't
[1:24:59] believe it like how you see it
[1:25:00] i i see it so i see it so or when you
[1:25:03] look at their life and their behavior
[1:25:05] no behavior so their their behavior come
[1:25:09] to adoption or teaching
[1:25:10] but that's not right that's why brother
[1:25:13] branham said i prefer somebody
[1:25:14] right in spirit and wrong in doctrine
[1:25:18] that to be wrong in spirit and right and
[1:25:21] doctrine
[1:25:22] if you're right in spirit you could be
[1:25:24] helped
[1:25:27] you could be spoken to you could be
[1:25:29] corrected
[1:25:30] you could be rebuked you could be
[1:25:32] instructed
[1:25:34] you could be guided god told everyone
[1:25:36] because you have heard
[1:25:38] obeyed my voice
[1:25:45] because you have obeyed my voice
[1:25:48] you see god told abram to offer isaac
[1:25:50] his only son
[1:25:52] this was his testimony hold on for 25
[1:25:54] years he was asking
[1:25:56] abraham to give up the only thing he had
[1:26:00] what he stood for for 25 years
[1:26:03] and abraham told them men i am the lad
[1:26:06] we go up
[1:26:08] and we're coming down and he knew
[1:26:11] that he was offended by that isaac
[1:26:14] didn't know
[1:26:15] but abraham knew that so when they were
[1:26:18] growing up
[1:26:19] the boy's not foolish the boy said dad
[1:26:22] i see the wood i see fire
[1:26:26] but where is he sacrificed
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:30] how are we doing this thing and god and
[1:26:32] abraham said god
[1:26:34] will provide for himself
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:42] abraham is climbing up hallelujah going
[1:26:45] up the mountain
[1:26:46] all right because god himself telling
[1:26:47] the monkey in advance
[1:26:49] he said keep on traveling until i show
[1:26:51] you the mountain
[1:26:53] to make sure everybody pass the mountain

[1:27:18] abraham scripture had to be corrected
[1:27:21] different scripture you got nixon

[1:33:36] it makes you
[1:33:37] subjugate its nature and the holy spirit
[1:33:39] makes you live and love to do it
[1:33:41] how you love to give up the things of
[1:33:42] the world when the holy spirit
[1:33:44] comes in how it cleanses you and washes
[1:33:47] you and puts
[1:33:48] a desire in you to follow him on a
[1:33:51] thirst
[1:33:52] and a hunger just baiting yourself he
[1:33:55] brings realities
[1:33:56] don't watch your organization watch the
[1:33:58] way the spirit is leading
[1:34:01] and if the spirit is leading it will
[1:34:03] never lead you contrary to the word
[1:34:05] it will never misbehave itself it will
[1:34:08] stay
[1:34:09] with the world oh glory to god

[1:41:36] one word against it will not be forgiven
[1:41:38] in this world or the world to come
[1:41:41] when the holy ghost begins to work that
[1:41:43] is what we're waiting on
[1:41:45] that's what we're on the expectation for
[1:41:47] for the spirit of god to begin to flow

[1:41:52] find a people

[1:41:56] spirit of god
[1:41:58] dear is my spirit flowing
[1:42:01] freely hallelujah
[1:42:04] all glory to god it will change one day
[1:42:07] from the teachings
[1:42:09] to the manifestation of god hallelujah
[1:42:13] when jesus begins his ministry there was
[1:42:15] there was challenging
[1:42:16] they they wondered about his authority
[1:42:19] because his doctrine was so different he
[1:42:21] was preaching with the authority of god
[1:42:24] so buddha says and after watch so abram
[1:42:27] has been promised
[1:42:28] that tourists see the whole world be
[1:42:29] blessed and we find out when he was 75
[1:42:31] years old and serious white was 65 years
[1:42:33] old
[1:42:33] and that abram's stuck under the promise
[1:42:35] of god from belief it was strong
[1:42:36] giving praise to god and god time after
[1:42:39] time
[1:42:40] tested him and he come to that here we
[1:42:43] go are you ready
[1:42:44] are we going to bring a notebook and a
[1:42:47] pen
[1:42:48] i want to be able to write down stuff
[1:42:50] time after time was testing him
[1:42:52] are you ready and there come a time
[1:42:54] final test
[1:42:56] before the blessing was going to happen
[1:43:00] you've been as a final test you can't
[1:43:02] feel that one you know
[1:43:03] amen amen that is final test
[1:43:08] before you get your blessing
[1:43:13] hallelujah and that's the way it is with
[1:43:15] all the seed of abraham
[1:43:17] god gives us that final test
[1:43:21] just before he gives the promise
[1:43:26] are you ready for some more and if it's
[1:43:29] possible i'd like to say something here
[1:43:30] personally
[1:43:31] i will hold that that final test is to
[1:43:34] see
[1:43:34] how you will react upon it
[1:43:38] notice when god called people out from
[1:43:40] egypt he called them out to give him a
[1:43:42] good land right
[1:43:43] and we find out he blessed them in the
[1:43:44] wilderness the journey and everything
[1:43:45] else
[1:43:46] when he reached camisbania which was the
[1:43:48] final junction to cross over
[1:43:50] he sent 12 spies one from each tribe to
[1:43:53] bring back testimony of evidence of the
[1:43:54] land he's a good god
[1:43:56] and the promise and so on all ten

[1:51:50] and everything else what's the objective
[1:51:51] of oats
[1:51:52] grudges and all these different things
[1:51:54] to cut you off
[1:51:56] listen carefully from being and speak in
[1:51:59] terms with god
[1:52:02] you see the devil know he can't take
[1:52:04] away your sonship
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:06] but he can mess you up that you can't
[1:52:08] talk to god
[1:52:09] [Music]

[1:52:12] you're still a son but you can't
[1:52:14] communicate with your father
[1:52:17] your father have a couple of thousand
[1:52:19] hills and you can't go wrong
[1:52:21] you scrunching and your father is a big
[1:52:23] boss

[1:52:26] condition you can't ask what you will
[1:52:28] because you're not abiding you're not in
[1:52:30] the spirit

[1:52:39] tell you another son you know your son
[1:52:41] all right but what he could do he can
[1:52:42] make a whole lot and whether or not you
[1:52:45] can't go to the altar
[1:52:46] all right come on now you're gonna bury
[1:52:48] the idiot
[1:52:49] leave your gift at the altar and go to
[1:52:52] your brother
[1:52:53] go to your sister and make it right
[1:52:57] then come back
[1:53:00] so as long as you have an oath or a
[1:53:03] grudge

[1:53:05] you
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:07] they will buy you by making you bang
[1:53:10] yourself

[1:53:38] father
[1:53:40] [Applause]

[1:53:46] is to bring you back and to speak in
[1:53:48] terms with god
[1:53:51] i'll give the lord a shout
[1:53:55] out

[1:54:07] how could you do that amen you and god's
[1:54:10] presence
[1:54:11] that's why hatred malice
[1:54:14] anger and whatnot can't pray for your
[1:54:18] husband because you're doing this and
[1:54:19] the other and you hold a grudge and hold
[1:54:21] up earth and they come in
[1:54:22] you can't drop it because he hit you
[1:54:26] and that is the humanistic realm yeah
[1:54:29] you feel any hurt
[1:54:30] because it's in your spirit amen that's
[1:54:33] not revelation
[1:54:48] and you're really mad and you're really

[2:16:51] blessings of it
[2:16:52] mostly are poor people that's why the
[2:16:54] rich gospel is is false

[2:19:06] that's the filling

[2:19:09] today
[2:19:11] oh hallelujah you talk about the queen
[2:19:13] of sheba
[2:19:14] she wants under the wisdom of salaman
[2:19:15] she come with leading cameras with gold
[2:19:17] and more than frankincense
[2:19:18] costly apparel it's right if god is real
[2:19:21] then i am true with this thing i've been
[2:19:23] serving i'm going to support it with
[2:19:24] everything i got
[2:19:25] that's the attitude listen god is not
[2:19:27] concerned about how much money
[2:19:28] but he wants you to support him with all
[2:19:31] you are
[2:19:32] you don't want 10 of your money so much
[2:19:34] as he wants your time
[2:19:35] your talent your testimony all that you
[2:19:39] are
[2:19:39] is to be given into his hands so he
[2:19:42] could control you
[2:19:43] he wants to be your lord not only your
[2:19:47] savior
[2:19:48] he wants your talent he wants your time
[2:19:51] you are trying to do everything but
[2:19:53] permitted
[2:19:53] time to do everything but to come to
[2:19:55] church time to do everything else how
[2:19:56] much time you in church
[2:20:00] when you come to church you're not
[2:20:01] putting all into it
[2:20:10] usia was called to be king yes and you
[2:20:14] know he perished and so on i think his
[2:20:15] and he was a
[2:20:16] watch oh he's talking he was a king at
[2:20:18] the age of 16 years old
[2:20:20] after his father death his father was a
[2:20:21] great believer and he saw he had a godly
[2:20:23] father and a godly mother
[2:20:24] and i think that's a very fine example
[2:20:26] for we parents today set an example
[2:20:28] before children
[2:20:29] your best your worst at home and i think
[2:20:31] our lives though our children might not
[2:20:33] just exactly act but they are noticing
[2:20:35] it
[2:20:35] they are noticing it don't you never
[2:20:37] think they're not because they are
[2:20:38] watching
[2:20:39] not only children watching but their
[2:20:40] neighbors are watching not only
[2:20:42] neighbors watching
[2:20:42] but who you associate with watch you the
[2:20:45] people at your church watch you
[2:20:47] so you are being watched
[2:20:48] [Applause]
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:50] [Applause]
[2:20:54] but i can't take my testimony or you
[2:20:56] would still see so he went in this
[2:20:58] bar to get a coke or something so like
[2:20:59] that and in the corner had somebody
[2:21:01] sitting there
[2:21:02] who recognized him also he didn't know
[2:21:04] the person was he's a pastor
[2:21:05] what we're doing here
[2:21:10] so he said what if he didn't have a coke
[2:21:12] in his hands
[2:21:14] what he didn't have what he was doing
[2:21:16] some other things you see how
[2:21:18] somebody's watching
[2:21:24] so but abandoned praise god i skip here
[2:21:28] oh my praise god so jesus said you must
[2:21:32] be born again
[2:21:34] if you're not born again you cannot see
[2:21:35] the kingdom and you cannot enter into
[2:21:38] the kingdom
[2:21:39] he said you have to accept it by faith
[2:21:41] and then he comes into you
[2:21:43] then you understand it to see is to
[2:21:44] understand you've got to have faith
[2:21:47] and you've got to know how to use that
[2:21:48] faith to make yourself well
[2:21:51] to get happiness out of life i want to
[2:21:54] say that again
[2:21:55] you have got to have faith one
[2:21:58] two you have got to know how to use that
[2:22:02] faith
[2:22:03] to make yourself well and get happiness
[2:22:07] out of life that's what you come here
[2:22:09] for
[2:22:10] they get a release to get a breakthrough
[2:22:12] to get a revelation
[2:22:14] of your calling of your position in god
[2:22:16] paul was seeking the lord for a certain
[2:22:18] preacher and god said my grace is
[2:22:20] sufficient
[2:22:20] physique and when paul heard that he
[2:22:23] adjusted his attitude and behavior
[2:22:25] and said in our glory in my infirmities
[2:22:28] if the devil figure you're buying me
[2:22:29] with that
[2:22:30] he's wrong in other words he punched the
[2:22:32] devil right back he said i've got
[2:22:33] rejoice now
[2:22:34] because this is what god gave me grace
[2:22:36] to go through this stuff
[2:22:38] and many times sometimes god doesn't
[2:22:39] take you out he gives you grace to go
[2:22:41] through okay give the lord some
[2:22:42] preaching
[2:22:42] come on help me bring back somebody
[2:22:44] somebody didn't help here this morning
[2:22:47] so sometimes let me say it again
[2:22:48] sometimes god don't take you out
[2:22:50] he gave your grace to go through
[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:54] how many receive that
[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:23:02] so all those unimaginable churches have
[2:23:04] got as children
[2:23:06] they belong to this mystic kingdom
[2:23:10] what are they waiting for they are
[2:23:11] waiting to see
[2:23:14] something take place that will draw
[2:23:16] their hearts into it amen
[2:23:18] so that baptist is only a shell over
[2:23:20] them it's not the real thing methodist
[2:23:23] this group interpretation only shell
[2:23:25] they look at normal
[2:23:26] and they believe and they're here in
[2:23:28] this group and in that church and
[2:23:29] whatnot but they are seeds of god
[2:23:31] waiting for something to draw their
[2:23:33] hearts
[2:23:35] right they're only hunting in the head
[2:23:37] and they have the choice and they think
[2:23:38] so and they feel so humanistic
[2:23:40] but one of these days when that holy
[2:23:43] spirit began to move
[2:23:45] my god understand this that come like a
[2:23:47] magnet
[2:23:49] magnet don't pick up cloth and paper it
[2:23:52] make up pick up thing that i'm
[2:23:53] magnetizing it
[2:23:54] it picks up metal and everything else so
[2:23:56] when the magnet of the holy ghost
[2:23:58] begins to move over the world it will
[2:24:00] pick up those that have the magnetism
[2:24:02] of the spirit you pick them up pick them
[2:24:04] up one here one there
[2:24:06] there'll be two in a bed one taken that
[2:24:09] one are the magnets in them
[2:24:10] oh give the lord some shouts there'll be
[2:24:12] two in the field one taken
[2:24:14] that one have the magnetism inside of
[2:24:16] them you come here to get magnetized
[2:24:18] oh glory of god you come here and
[2:24:20] sometimes when the metal don't have no
[2:24:22] magnet on it you take a magnet and rub
[2:24:24] it
[2:24:25] and they keep rubbing it and transfer it
[2:24:27] get the atoms going
[2:24:28] and when you take the word and begin to
[2:24:29] take that wood in your heart yeah start
[2:24:31] to rub it
[2:24:32] praise god something transfer oh glory
[2:24:35] to god the secret is
[2:24:37] the word is in the prayer so the
[2:24:39] magnetism inside of you
[2:24:40] devil can't put it the devil didn't put
[2:24:42] it inside of here
[2:24:43] he cannot take it out
[2:24:45] [Applause]
[2:24:46] [Music]
[2:24:48] so you come to church to get the word
[2:24:50] inside of you
[2:24:51] the word coming inside of you and then
[2:24:54] the holy spirit
[2:24:55] could take that up do you see it now
[2:24:59] glory to god it's in the last days
[2:25:02] they're gonna come a famine
[2:25:03] not for bread and water but for hearing
[2:25:05] the true word of god
[2:25:06] and they're gonna say come join come
[2:25:08] join but we're enjoying nothing
[2:25:10] oh glory to god question this church who
[2:25:13] set it up

[2:27:32] you shall receive power
[2:27:34] after the holy ghost comes upon you
[2:27:37] you shall receive power after you made a
[2:27:39] bishop amen after you made a preacher
[2:27:42] after you made a pope after you made a
[2:27:43] priest no after the holy ghost
[2:27:46] comes upon you who is the head of the
[2:27:48] church jesus christ
[2:27:50] what kingdom is it the messiah kingdom
[2:27:53] the church is not an organization it's a
[2:27:55] mystical body
[2:27:57] to which christ is the head christ is
[2:27:59] here this morning
[2:28:00] to connect with you you are members of
[2:28:03] his body
[2:28:04] you are members of his machine oh glory
[2:28:06] to god
[2:28:08] what is the church it is the mystical
[2:28:10] body of jesus christ who set it up
[2:28:12] the lord jesus himself and you will
[2:28:15] never be able to understand the kingdom
[2:28:17] of god
[2:28:18] until you are born again it's an
[2:28:20] unraveled mystery
[2:28:21] but when you are when you are born again
[2:28:24] the plans of the kingdom
[2:28:26] and the kingdom itself becomes real to
[2:28:29] you
[2:28:29] you have got to understand the blueprint
[2:28:33] or you won't know the blueprint until
[2:28:35] you're born again
[2:28:37] i just said somebody go in and build one
[2:28:39] build this and build this there's a
[2:28:40] blueprint
[2:28:41] you have to understand how to build it
[2:28:43] then they could go and build a building
[2:28:45] isn't that right so therefore the four
[2:28:47] beasts praise
[2:28:48] god we said take care of the seven
[2:28:50] spirits lion paul irenaeus martin
[2:28:53] ox columba portage the man luton wesley
[2:28:56] and the eagle is william branham
[2:28:58] hallelujah it's not but
[2:29:00] this creature or living creature was not
[2:29:02] beast this living creature
[2:29:03] is a word called zun and beast
[2:29:06] wild beast is tyrion but this zone is
[2:29:09] living creatures
[2:29:11] tyrion is the word peace as identified
[2:29:14] as rome
[2:29:14] as united and united states they are
[2:29:16] beasts tyrion
[2:29:18] but these four beasts is not that these
[2:29:21] four beasts soon
[2:29:22] they are living creatures isn't that
[2:29:25] right
[2:29:26] revelation 4 is living creatures not
[2:29:28] beasts
[2:29:29] okay and in ezekiel ezekiel saw it
[2:29:32] ezekiel 1 and he read the scripture
[2:29:35] praise god
[2:29:36] hallelujah and watch living creatures
[2:29:39] they are not angels
[2:29:40] he said the voice of many ages are wrong
[2:29:42] about the throne there are three
[2:29:44] different categories there here along
[2:29:46] the throne
[2:29:47] is four living creatures outside of that
[2:29:50] 24 elders
[2:29:51] outside of that a host of angels so
[2:29:53] there are three categories
[2:29:55] wrong the throne four beasts living
[2:29:57] creatures
[2:29:58] isn't that right oh hallelujah
[2:30:02] they are not angels they are not
[2:30:03] redeemed men what are they
[2:30:05] would you like to know here is my
[2:30:07] interpretation they are god
[2:30:09] gods of his throne these are his
[2:30:12] gods they are god's angels to guard the
[2:30:15] troll
[2:30:16] so this throne of god is guarded
[2:30:20] that means any and anybody can't access
[2:30:23] the glory the power the presence the
[2:30:26] anointing
[2:30:27] from on that troll could we give the
[2:30:29] lord a shout
[2:30:31] hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise
[2:30:35] god
[2:30:36] the first peace lion okay i skipped that
[2:30:38] oh glory to god
[2:30:39] and in ezekiel chapter one there was on
[2:30:42] wheels and bahram explained
[2:30:43] that the four beasts and they couldn't
[2:30:45] turn backward
[2:30:47] because if they go this way is a man if
[2:30:49] they go that way is the ox if they go
[2:30:50] that way it's a is a lion if they go
[2:30:52] that way is that eagle
[2:30:53] so they all could only go forward and
[2:30:55] they have eyes within
[2:30:56] and behind and in front to see what was
[2:30:59] what is
[2:31:00] and what is to come are you with me the
[2:31:03] eyes on the inside
[2:31:04] the eyes behind and the eyes in front
[2:31:06] have a purpose behind it
[2:31:08] to represent what was what is and what
[2:31:10] is to come
[2:31:11] what glory that god and it could never

[2:38:43] byproduct
[2:38:44] adam was original he choose to go with
[2:38:47] his wife
[2:38:48] that was his choice he chose to go with
[2:38:50] his wife

[2:39:47] out the man that he placed at the
[2:39:58] there's only four ways you could go east
[2:40:00] west north and south
[2:40:01] all right so all you need is four
[2:40:05] there's the only four place you could go
[2:40:07] east west north and south
[2:40:09] isn't that right these cherubim are
[2:40:11] flaming sword
[2:40:12] at the gate in the garden of eden
[2:40:14] because if man ever got a hold of the
[2:40:15] tree of life
[2:40:16] he could live forever oh my
[2:40:20] so these cherubims first mentioned
[2:40:23] was at the east gate of the garden going
[2:40:25] four ways
[2:40:26] there's a garden of eden and this is the
[2:40:29] gate
[2:40:29] that oakman swings out and at the gate
[2:40:32] was the cherubims
[2:40:33] it doesn't say cherubim it's a cherubims
[2:40:36] was placed there to god what
[2:40:38] the tree of life that is what there was
[2:40:41] the god
[2:40:42] the way of the tree of life the way who
[2:40:45] is the way
[2:40:46] jesus where is it reflected from the
[2:40:49] holy place
[2:40:50] where there was the terribles the holies
[2:40:53] of holies
[2:40:54] they are guarding and reflecting the
[2:40:56] fire of god
[2:40:58] the way of the tree of life it can't
[2:41:00] come from presbyterian seminary
[2:41:02] or pentecostal seminary is a reflected
[2:41:05] light
[2:41:06] that light comes from the throne of god
[2:41:08] these cherubims that john saw
[2:41:10] must have been interested in keeping the
[2:41:13] tree of life
[2:41:14] therefore they're interested in human
[2:41:16] beings now i want to just show
[2:41:19] watch they kept the tree of life
[2:41:20] gathered if man eats this bread he will
[2:41:22] live forever
[2:41:23] now there's a way back to the tree of
[2:41:25] life i want to show you now
[2:41:27] hear the meat okay so you get the salad
[2:41:30] you got the thing but this is does it
[2:41:31] mean pasta there's the course you can't
[2:41:33] miss this you know
[2:41:34] get your knife and fork ready this is
[2:41:36] what you're going to get down inside and
[2:41:38] dig inside here now i want to show you
[2:41:40] and make this
[2:41:41] sure it's an altar
[2:41:45] [Applause]
[2:41:47] this must have been an altar at the
[2:41:50] garden of eden
[2:41:52] you know why do you remember cain and
[2:41:54] abel compared to worship
[2:41:56] so that shows that god's altar
[2:41:59] was moved and set here at the garden of
[2:42:02] eden
[2:42:03] and the only way back to eden
[2:42:07] is by the altar here you are again
[2:42:12] back to eden through the altar
[2:42:15] they were to keep that way to guard it
[2:42:17] and they couldn't get back there
[2:42:19] until this altar was covered with blood
[2:42:22] amen
[2:42:22] nothing but the blood there has to be an
[2:42:25] atonement
[2:42:26] a mercy seat and this altar of judgment
[2:42:30] becomes a mercy seat by the blood
[2:42:33] and when the blood is lifted it comes
[2:42:35] back to judgment again
[2:42:37] isn't that right and the only way to
[2:42:40] enter into the gate of eden
[2:42:41] is through the blood of jesus so cain
[2:42:44] went out from the presence of the lord
[2:42:46] from the gate of the garden therefore
[2:42:49] the presence of the lord
[2:42:50] must have been at the altar so the
[2:42:53] guardian angel
[2:42:54] was god in the presence of the lord that
[2:42:57] was at the altar
[2:42:58] that order reflected the throne of god
[2:43:01] oh hallelujah
[2:43:09] then the prophet went a little deeper he
[2:43:11] said moses was told to
[2:43:12] make things i thought in heaven and the
[2:43:14] act of the covenant had cherubims
[2:43:16] carved out isn't that right praise peter
[2:43:20] just wings touching each other to
[2:43:22] represent the gods
[2:43:24] hallelujah the after the covenant he put
[2:43:26] two cherubims the goddess
[2:43:27] what was it tron gods they got the mercy
[2:43:30] seat
[2:43:31] when god here we go in his shekinah
[2:43:34] glory
[2:43:35] where was she kind of glory at the mercy
[2:43:37] seat the guard that she kind of glory
[2:43:39] he said who listen friends then it goes
[2:43:42] to show
[2:43:42] that not no scallywag
[2:43:46] every scary one can't come there
[2:43:49] and take off that that is why when the
[2:43:52] sanza skiva
[2:43:53] was trying to cast the devil out come
[2:43:55] out of him in the name of paul who paul
[2:43:57] preaches
[2:43:58] come on in the devil and then devil
[2:43:59] talked after them and said
[2:44:01] paul i know
[2:44:11] so they know those devils know when the
[2:44:15] kind of glory comes off the throne of
[2:44:17] god those devils know
[2:44:19] and they recognize the authority of god
[2:44:22] that comes back in the church
[2:44:24] those devils know who's you are whose
[2:44:27] son you are
[2:44:28] whose daughter you are do you believe
[2:44:30] that
[2:44:31] hallelujah he said you can't no scary
[2:44:34] what could come in and take that
[2:44:36] you have got to be prepared before you
[2:44:39] enter into the presence
[2:44:40] look at aaron and type how to wear
[2:44:42] certain clothes certain type of clothes
[2:44:44] you had to be perfumed certain type of
[2:44:46] perfume he had to be
[2:44:48] he could remain that way yep and he had
[2:44:50] to anoint his church
[2:44:51] to approach his holiness jesus his life
[2:44:53] was squeezed out
[2:44:54] and the same holy ghost upon him is put
[2:44:56] upon the church
[2:44:58] perfume that person approaching the
[2:45:00] holiest of holies has to be anointed
[2:45:02] with the same holy spirit and he walks
[2:45:04] holy holy
[2:45:05] unto the lord here we go and the mercy
[2:45:08] seat
[2:45:09] now the mercy seat is in the heart the
[2:45:11] seat we're shining forth of his glory
[2:45:14] here is the human heart is that the
[2:45:16] mercy seat
[2:45:17] how do you come into it that through
[2:45:20] these different systems
[2:45:22] how do you get into this thing true
[2:45:24] self-will
[2:45:26] amen

[2:45:40] in and bring that platter for you
[2:45:41] no no no you have to choose it that way

[2:46:04] thank you jesus she kind of glory what
[2:46:06] is this kind of glory it's god's
[2:46:08] presence
[2:46:08] when a man walking a woman he is
[2:46:10] reflecting the shine of glory
[2:46:12] praise the name of the lord i'm almost
[2:46:14] done
[2:46:16] from the resume of the ages he says the
[2:46:19] age started
[2:46:20] at the 20th century as it was to the age
[2:46:23] in which true church would retain
[2:46:25] to be the bride she was at pentecost we
[2:46:27] know that there must have necessity be
[2:46:29] a return of dynamic power the believers
[2:46:31] sense this in their spirits
[2:46:32] i begin crying to god for a new
[2:46:34] opportunity in the first century
[2:46:37] what seemed to be the answer came
[2:46:40] as many began to speak in tongues and
[2:46:42] manifest gifts in the spirit
[2:46:44] it was then believed that this was
[2:46:46] indeed the long awaited restoration it
[2:46:48] was not
[2:46:49] for the latter rain here we go can only
[2:46:52] come
[2:46:53] after the former rain which is teaching
[2:46:55] rain
[2:46:56] the latter rain is harvest rain how
[2:46:59] could this be the real thing talking
[2:47:00] about the pentecostal revival
[2:47:01] how could this be the real thing when
[2:47:03] the teaching rain has not come
[2:47:05] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[2:47:07] teach the people
[2:47:08] and turn the heart of return back to the
[2:47:10] pentecostal fighters had not yet come
[2:47:11] hallelujah thus what was thought to be
[2:47:14] the restoration
[2:47:15] and final quickness of the rapture had
[2:47:17] not come amen
[2:47:18] in it was a mixture here we go of the
[2:47:21] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[2:47:24] blessing
[2:47:27] that is what determined the unrighteous
[2:47:30] partaking of spiritual blessings
[2:47:33] and manifesting in the holy ghost as we
[2:47:36] have kept pointing out to you
[2:47:38] it was also was devil power
[2:47:41] as men was under the control of devils
[2:47:45] yet no one seemed to realize it and to
[2:47:48] prove
[2:47:49] it was not real these people even before
[2:47:52] the second generation that appeared
[2:47:54] organize and wrote it on scripture
[2:47:56] doctrines and build their own fences
[2:47:58] as every other group of eight of them
[2:48:00] did
[2:48:01] musicians come on please hallelujah oh
[2:48:04] hallelujah
[2:48:04] jesus
[2:48:11] first samuel 18 14.
[2:48:14] god speaking to samuel picking the sword
[2:48:16] but now thy kingdom
[2:48:18] shall not continue the lord had sought
[2:48:21] him a man
[2:48:22] after his heart and the lord commanded
[2:48:25] him
[2:48:25] to be captain over his people because
[2:48:28] thou has not
[2:48:29] kept what the lord had commanded thee
[2:48:32] there is always a word given to you for
[2:48:34] you to listen to
[2:48:36] for you to obey was there six one my
[2:48:39] people are destroyed
[2:48:40] for lack of knowledge because that was
[2:48:42] rejected knowledge i will also
[2:48:44] reject thee oh praise the name of the
[2:48:47] lord
[2:48:48] you love him final quote you could pay
[2:48:51] something
[2:48:52] because that was chosen the narrow path
[2:48:54] this is god's speaking of the
[2:48:56] prophet because that was chosen a narrow
[2:48:58] path
[2:49:00] the hard way there was walked in your
[2:49:03] own chosen
[2:49:04] that was picked a correct and precise
[2:49:06] decision it is my way
[2:49:08] because of this momentous decision a
[2:49:11] huge portion of heaven will await thee
