[31:24] that would move us closer to you father
[31:26] Lord yourself any man come after you let
[31:29] him deny himself take up the cross and

[31:34] obedience to your word and to your will
[31:36] then Jesus might ask it amen God bless
[31:38] you and thanks so much for coming if
[31:40] every Bible I'd like you to turn to Luke
[31:42] chapter 23 we want to read verse 18.
[31:45] I'm going to say we're going to go down
[31:46] all the way down to 47 just one
[31:48] scripture
[31:53] and they cried out all at once or we
[31:55] will this man speaking about Jesus
[31:56] release on this Barabbas
[31:59] and Barabbas have a reputation already
[32:02] who for certain citizens made in the
[32:04] city for murder was cast into prison
[32:07] pilot therefore willing to release Jesus
[32:09] speak again to them
[32:11] but they cried said crucify him crucify
[32:14] him
[32:15] he said unto them the third time why
[32:19] what evil had he done or these are
[32:21] cinnamon in power talking to him
[32:24] religious people
[32:26] people
[32:29] foreign
[32:35] of death in him
[32:38] I will therefore chastise him and let
[32:40] him go and they were instant with Lord
[32:43] voices required that he might be
[32:45] crucified
[32:47] and the voices of them and of Chief
[32:49] priests prevailed
[32:51] loudmouth win
[32:54] and pilate gives sentence that it should
[32:56] be as they required and he released
[32:57] something to him him then him that for
[33:00] sedition and murder was cast into prison
[33:03] whom they had desired but he delivered
[33:06] Jesus to their will
[33:08] and as they let him away delayed Hoon
[33:11] upon one Simon a cyrenian coming out of
[33:14] the country and on him they lay the
[33:16] cross that he might bear it after Jesus
[33:20] and they followed him a great company of
[33:22] people of women which also be wailed and
[33:24] lamented him but Jesus turned into them
[33:28] said Daughters of Jerusalem
[33:30] weep not for me but weep for yourselves
[33:32] and for your children
[33:34] for behold the days are coming in which
[33:37] they shall see blessed are the Bahrain
[33:39] and the wombs that never bear and the
[33:41] pups which never gives suck they shall
[33:44] then shall they begin to see to the
[33:46] mountains fall on us
[33:48] onto the hills cover us for if they do
[33:51] these things in a green tree what shall
[33:52] be done in a dry
[33:54] and there were two also also two other
[33:57] money factors led with him to be put to
[33:59] death and when they will come to the
[34:02] police
[34:03] which is called Calvary
[34:06] the police
[34:08] dear de crucified him
[34:10] animal factors one on the right hand at
[34:13] the other on the left
[34:15] then said Jesus father
[34:18] forgive them
[34:20] for they know not what they do
[34:22] no this is asking for forgiveness for
[34:25] the people who just shouted crucify him
[34:29] and departed his riemens and cast lots
[34:31] and the people therefore beholden rulers
[34:34] also with them divided them saying he
[34:37] saved others let them save himself if
[34:38] he'd be the Christ the chosen of God
[34:41] soldiers also mocked him coming to him
[34:43] often in vinegar and saying if Dolby the
[34:46] king of the Jews save thyself
[34:48] a superscription was written over him in
[34:50] letters of Greek Latin Hebrew this is
[34:52] the king of the Jews and one of the many
[34:54] factors which were hanged hanged real on
[34:57] him saying Adobe Christ saved thyself on
[34:59] us
[35:01] and the other answer rebuked him
[35:03] seeing thus thou not fear God
[35:06] seen the god in the same condemnation
[35:09] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[35:12] due reward of our Deeds but this man
[35:16] have done nothing amiss and he said unto
[35:19] Jesus Lord remember me when all comments
[35:22] into thy kingdom
[35:23] and Jesus said unto him very nice unto
[35:26] thee today shall thou be with me in
[35:28] Paradise
[35:29] was about the sixth hour there was
[35:31] Darkness over the Earth until the ninth
[35:33] hour and the sun was darkening the veil
[35:35] of the temple was rent in the midst
[35:37] and when Jesus had cried a lord voice he
[35:40] said father in the dining hands I
[35:42] commend my spirit and having set us you
[35:45] give up The Ghost and when the Centurion
[35:47] saw what was done he glorified God
[35:49] saying certainly this was a righteous
[35:51] man that God bless his word you may be
[35:53] seated
[35:53] or praise God so this is the scripture
[35:56] for today
[35:57] and I trust them that this word will
[35:58] edify you and help you
[36:01] strengthen you and get you see a fresh
[36:03] view of Calvary and across from this
[36:06] partner in Greece
[36:07] that has come to that will come to your
[36:09] life
[36:10] who prays the name of the Lord
[36:13] Hallelujah
[36:14] I wonder why we make up people get so
[36:17] hard-hearted
[36:18] as to see such a righteous man
[36:22] bread fed multitude raise the dead yield
[36:25] is sick and to crucify him
[36:28] you know they talk about Joseph hated
[36:30] without
[36:31] a Cause
[36:33] there was no cause to hit him but he
[36:35] hated him all the same
[36:36] and if his Spirit come into you don't
[36:38] you think that you wouldn't be hated
[36:40] you would be rejected like he was
[36:42] because he was rejected of men
[36:46] Express what excuse do you have
[36:49] of your behavior of your attitude of
[36:51] your actions
[36:53] the price of sin was dead
[36:55] God is uncompromising with his word with
[36:59] his cousins and his Blessing if God said
[37:02] he's going to bless you nothing can
[37:03] cancel that his Blessing is determined
[37:06] his Christians is also determined he
[37:09] told his own children the day you eat
[37:10] thereof that day you die
[37:12] like why not even message or not you
[37:14] will die if you eat that word doesn't
[37:16] matter if you're books if you have your
[37:18] Bible you will die
[37:19] some people go to hell you know we don't
[37:21] believe that sometimes but people will
[37:23] go to hell people want hell every day
[37:25] people go to heaven every day
[37:27] Hallelujah because God have to keep his
[37:29] word
[37:30] and God wants to come in obedience to
[37:32] his word we can't be hearers over only
[37:34] we have to be doers now they are hearers
[37:36] and they are heroes and doers because
[37:39] that's why they are they separated it
[37:40] don't be heroes on me but doers of the
[37:43] word
[37:43] it's not something there
[37:45] praise the name of the Lord no the Bible
[37:48] speaks about all things happen for all
[37:50] examples to whom the ends of the world
[37:52] have come people called out and judged
[37:55] how people call out and they miss the
[37:57] mark people will call out being called
[37:59] is not good enough
[38:01] coming out is not good enough believing
[38:03] is not good enough it has to go beyond
[38:05] that you have to want to go beyond where
[38:07] you are it has to be a choice it has to
[38:10] be a decision you have to make the
[38:13] decision it is never a group thing I may
[38:16] say good it's not never a family thing
[38:18] this ever does cause shall you leave
[38:20] your mother and father isn't that right
[38:21] praise God or rather he said he that not
[38:24] or forsake mother father and brother and
[38:26] doesn't follow me it's not worthy of me
[38:29] they come to bring a sword in the family
[38:31] so you can't take a family stand you're
[38:33] foolish to take a family's done you have
[38:35] to take a word stand I don't care what
[38:37] the rest of the family believe you have
[38:39] to stay with the word I don't care about
[38:41] your mama leave your father believe is
[38:42] what does the word say mama father

[39:14] second chance this might be your only
[39:16] chance that thief on the cross had a
[39:19] chance of Glory to God although there is
[39:22] so much dimensions in this script that
[39:23] we just read There were so much things
[39:25] happening present and behind the scene
[39:27] Oh Glory to God
[39:29] that script is so powerful because when
[39:32] Jesus died the veil of the temple was
[39:34] rent people wasn't seeing that you know
[39:36] but a lot of things and different
[39:38] dimensions happen Oh Glory the content

[40:52] that makes a difference the calculator

[44:19] yeah
[44:21] if those crimes and Pharisees that said
[44:24] crucify him understood what that meant
[44:27] they never sacrucify him because when he
[44:30] died it means the book was coming back
[44:32] when he died it means the power was
[44:34] coming back when he died it means the
[44:37] sons of God was coming back he was going
[44:39] to triumph over death hell on the grave
[44:41] nobody knew the mystery of what was
[44:43] beyond that debt but when Jesus rose we
[44:46] know there is life there is triumph and

[45:20] don't get old okay the Lord I praise
[45:23] Hallelujah we shall be in a land where
[45:25] we will never grow old praise God that
[45:28] songwriter said never grow old never
[45:31] call to a land where we will never growl

[45:55] land we retire we're still on our way to
[45:57] the land the devil's a liar we have
[45:59] eight
[46:02] if a man dies shall he live again Jesus
[46:05] answered that question
[46:07] you answer that question
[46:09] the devil
[46:11] only your power until death
[46:15] Beyond Death he had no power
[46:18] he could only beat you up beat you up
[46:19] tap you up and let it die after that no
[46:22] power
[46:23] the power finish
[46:25] that is why when you die out
[46:27] he has got power over you
[46:29] praise God if you die out if you could
[46:33] die to yourself the devil have no power
[46:35] over you whatsoever or give the Lord
[46:38] some praises
[46:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:43] praise God let's go
[46:48] the people in the Old Testament were
[46:50] overthrown
[46:51] reason
[46:53] after God did so much for them
[46:56] they begin to do things by rituals
[47:04] I was in a service in Congo
[47:06] and the people at the altar
[47:09] and
[47:10] the pastor called me inside and say you
[47:12] know
[47:13] show me one two brothers you see
[47:15] they coming to church and they are the
[47:17] alternate but they still go to the beach
[47:19] doctor
[47:20] and he don't understand it
[47:23] and I began to understand that some
[47:25] people this Jesus is another God
[47:31] he is an addition to what you already
[47:33] have
[47:36] whatever they have
[47:38] Jesus come to Canada
[47:41] and there's some people Jesus is
[47:44] another God
[47:46] the money is the god the family is the
[47:49] god the guy is the god and
[47:51] it comes with you know
[47:53] and they go wherever she has to give
[47:55] them the ticket
[47:56] I am mine if you bless me
[47:59] but that is not what this Bible is about
[48:03] he is God
[48:05] and God Alone
[48:07] he said I look around and there is none
[48:09] else beside me
[48:12] not only left not only right
[48:14] he is God alone
[48:16] or some desert and if he is who he is he
[48:20] deserves our all
[48:22] not some all
[48:24] that wearing job lost his family he said
[48:27] the Lord give it
[48:28] another word why this happened to me no
[48:31] no no he didn't say that he said the
[48:33] Lord give it
[48:34] the Lord take it away
[48:36] blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:39] that is how you have to talk
[48:40] and everything
[48:42] your day blessing bless God it's your
[48:45] loser blessing bless God this happened
[48:47] bless God that happened bless God what
[48:50] you expected didn't happen all of us
[48:52] have things in our mind and God not
[48:53] working according to your thoughts he
[48:55] said you're passing out my thoughts not
[48:57] what you think not what you feel is what
[48:59] he said and we could trust him he
[49:01] captures your father your mother your
[49:03] brother you can't trust this one and
[49:04] that one but anything he said you could
[49:06] trust you could brush your soul on it
[49:08] you can't lie Oh Glory to God the Biden
[49:12] Isaiah said he was wounded for our
[49:14] transgression and Jesus wasn't even born
[49:16] yet he was wounded for a transgression
[49:18] he was bruised all iniquities this is
[49:21] typement of Peace was upon him and by
[49:23] his choice we are healed it was a
[49:25] prophecy that Christ was going to be
[49:27] crucified they had to do it and certain
[49:29] things people have to do or give the
[49:32] Lord a shout to get the best all the
[49:34] words out to you or give the Lord some
[49:37] praises
[49:38] [Applause]
[49:39] [Music]
[49:39] [Applause]
[49:44] when things happen to you
[49:46] it brings either the best
[49:48] or something under with
[49:50] so all these things happened
[49:52] so examples
[49:53] he said no watch this you know
[49:56] because they could do all the rituals
[49:57] and all the orders and everything else
[49:59] that would require and their heart
[50:00] wasn't right with God
[50:03] so that's why they come obedience
[50:06] is better than sacrifice
[50:08] now we can do many things we can take
[50:10] communion
[50:11] we can be baptized we can come to church
[50:13] have our names in the book and just as
[50:16] respect and reverence as we can be and
[50:18] still be lost
[50:22] respectful nice people and lost
[50:27] we could just rejoice when the spirit
[50:30] will fall in a meeting where the world
[50:32] has been preached our souls will just
[50:33] rejoiced with the word and still be lost
[50:36] the rain falls under Justin the unjust
[50:38] the same Marine that makes the wheat
[50:40] grow makes the weed grow
[50:41] it's the nature of the product it's the
[50:44] nature of what it tells what we are
[50:46] therefore it's the nature that is in us
[50:50] that tells what we are
[50:52] so it's not not we might be so religious
[50:55] till we could turn our hands on Sunday
[50:57] to not wouldn't do a thing on Sunday
[50:59] because today is Sunday
[51:00] we might not even take a stitch on our
[51:02] clothes on Sunday we might not even feel
[51:04] Justified to buy food on Sunday
[51:08] they're not spiritually
[51:14] that's right
[51:15] you switch it just started this Sunday
[51:16] so they'll be even a certainly on Sunday
[51:19] all right watch
[51:20] we might be so religious and so Pious
[51:22] but yet we are not literally born again
[51:25] of the spirit of God we are worshiping
[51:27] in vain now it's pretty stiff
[51:30] but we want to really find it and know
[51:33] the truth
[51:35] because remember we are not going to get
[51:37] a second chance at this
[51:39] it's just this one time so you better be
[51:41] sure
[51:45] you want to be sure everything is fine
[51:48] and we come back to the two teams on the
[51:51] cross two Mali factors the two Crooks
[51:53] the two criminals one says why does save
[51:56] yourself and save us to so he's still
[51:58] looking for a Escape he's still looking
[52:01] for a way out of the justification of
[52:04] his judgment the other one rebuked him
[52:06] on the cross
[52:07] man busting rebuking across he said but
[52:10] you you're a whole Thief like he always
[52:12] camp like you but you you're getting we
[52:15] getting what we deserve what does man do
[52:18] this is just
[52:20] they hanging on the cross there you know
[52:21] one chance
[52:23] to say the right thing
[52:27] one chance
[52:30] you know
[52:33] two words remember me
[52:40] my money
[52:41] when you're coming to your kingdom
[52:44] Oh Glory to God
[52:46] what a chance oh my my whole poetry is
[52:49] in the thinking about it
[52:50] chance
[52:52] to see the writing a chance
[52:54] to let Angels come your way a chance
[52:58] to let the pillar of fire come inside
[52:59] your home a chance
[53:01] I'm taking a chance to say the right
[53:04] thing to act the right way that God
[53:05] could come and step into your situation
[53:07] oh Gloria God to step into your midst to
[53:11] step into your problems the step into
[53:13] your praise God taking a chance
[53:15] Gloria our King may not obtain to tell
[53:18] you like it is we will not bow down and
[53:20] if our God don't deliver us we're still
[53:22] not gonna bow down we still not gonna go
[53:24] back in the world we're gonna stay with
[53:27] the word Oh Glory to God he did
[53:29] sometimes hotter we still not bow and
[53:31] down because he does sentiment hotter it
[53:33] doesn't matter and when they step there
[53:35] the king
[53:36] stepping with them the Fourth Man In The
[53:39] Fire praise God let's go now
[53:43] so therefore it's not religious behavior
[53:45] and I think that the message will has
[53:46] come to that
[53:47] where people go to church traditionally
[53:49] you know they know they know the routine
[53:51] you have a song servicing have a special
[53:53] and music and everything else and and
[53:56] praise God by us here we might jump up a
[53:58] little bit so other places they might
[53:59] just sit down right true
[54:02] but it's traditional
[54:04] nothing different we do every Sunday
[54:07] but I dare you to do something different
[54:09] I dare you to step out of your your your
[54:12] comfort zone step out of what your
[54:15] customers step out praise God you have
[54:17] to do that for something to happen
[54:19] praise God when when they start a cry
[54:22] for Jesus they're crying at him he said
[54:24] woman no weep for me we pray children
[54:26] weep for yourself weep for your children
[54:28] praise God you already overcome when did
[54:31] you overcome in the gardener Gethsemane
[54:33] when he had a prayer meeting when the
[54:35] decider was snoring and sleeping they
[54:37] couldn't watch one hour but he was
[54:39] pushing and persevering if it is
[54:41] possible not go let this cup pass Let Us
[54:43] Go pass but if not possible let thy will
[54:45] be done he was he was in a battle a
[54:48] battle between his will and God's will

[56:14] when the spirit was in the blood the
[56:17] life was in the blood and when the
[56:19] piercing and that blessed was broken the
[56:21] spirit was released and that anointing

[1:21:12] this could be red I have so much
[1:21:14] different inventions in it when Christ
[1:21:16] died the veil of the temple was rent
[1:21:19] no the people at Calvary there not
[1:21:21] seeing that you know that happened to
[1:21:23] the side the scriptures brain record of
[1:21:25] all these things taking place the pie
[1:21:26] priests alone only had access to the
[1:21:28] inner Veil but when Christ died God
[1:21:31] busted the veil to show any man woman
[1:21:33] child boy girl sinner could access this
[1:21:37] present success this Glory can access
[1:21:40] that's what carries about well Glory has
[1:21:43] already broke down that tradition of the
[1:21:45] elders he busted the traditional of the
[1:21:48] high priest and all of them what was
[1:21:49] hidden was no longer hidden he passed
[1:21:51] the fail from the top to the bottom they
[1:21:53] give you the believer direct access or
[1:21:56] Clarity of God and I'm saying today you
[1:21:59] have direct access the presence direct

[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:17] I need pastors here to come to he's a
[1:22:19] liar false prophet
[1:22:24] and a man that presented himself between
[1:22:27] you and that Calvary their faults
[1:22:31] presenting his beef
[1:22:38] to the Branham
[1:22:41] he said
[1:22:42] that was the deed of the price was paid
[1:22:44] same question was started forever it
[1:22:46] opened up the way into this thing
[1:22:49] that we're hungry and twisting for it
[1:22:51] brought a place of satisfaction there's
[1:22:54] no man that ever visited Calvary and
[1:22:56] seen it the way it was
[1:22:58] that can be the same
[1:23:00] everything that he desired along for is
[1:23:02] met when he reaches that place
[1:23:06] an important day
[1:23:07] an important thing it shook the world it
[1:23:10] shook the world like it never shot
[1:23:12] before when Jesus died at Calvary and
[1:23:15] question on the same question oh Satan
[1:23:16] was not taught at Calvary
[1:23:19] prove it was the greatest price was ever
[1:23:20] paid the only one that could pay it come
[1:23:22] and doesn't recovery and there that
[1:23:24] great price was paid is not right he
[1:23:27] said no watch
[1:23:28] when the doctor gave a man an Aesthetics
[1:23:30] it knocks him out before he can do it
[1:23:32] when he could operation and when God
[1:23:33] give the operation for the church it got
[1:23:35] a world of Aesthetics nature had a
[1:23:37] convulsion no wonder God and human flesh
[1:23:39] was dying it was the all the world had
[1:23:41] looked for yet many of them did not know
[1:23:43] like it is today many look for these
[1:23:45] things yet they don't recognize them
[1:23:46] they don't realize the way out they're
[1:23:48] still trying to seek pleasures and
[1:23:50] things of the world trying to find their
[1:23:52] way out when Jesus died
[1:23:54] country
[1:23:55] one of a good wrap up here
[1:23:57] he broke the powers of Satan
[1:24:00] he opened the prison doors of hell
[1:24:03] to every man that was shot upon this
[1:24:05] Earth in prisons fearing that when he
[1:24:07] died the death would be to him on
[1:24:10] Calvary opened those cell doors let
[1:24:12] every captive Go free you don't have to
[1:24:14] no longer be torn down by sin you don't
[1:24:17] have to be no longer yield your members
[1:24:19] to sin drinking smoking gambling telling

[1:32:08] red like Crimson white like wool you are
[1:32:11] perfectly sinless no matter what you
[1:32:12] have done what you do what you are still
[1:32:15] sinless as long as you accepted Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ as your savior your sins are
[1:32:19] forgiven anything that's forgive me is
[1:32:21] remitted and forgot about

[1:32:32] here we go I'm gonna wrap up
[1:32:34] now the first thing I want to say is
[1:32:37] Jesus never lived for himself
[1:32:40] his life was spent for others
[1:32:44] and there's a lesson right here you know
[1:32:46] you see when you live for yourself you
[1:32:48] only care about you and some people in
[1:32:51] that selfish mode only care about their
[1:32:52] family their eyes only see their own
[1:32:55] interests their own desires what they
[1:32:58] want what they're lusting after what
[1:33:00] they desire and what they think they're
[1:33:01] supposed to have they have no burden and
[1:33:03] can say but nobody else as long as their
[1:33:06] desires is fulfilled everything is fine
[1:33:10] but not Jesus
[1:33:12] and he said that is perfectly eternal
[1:33:14] life when you say you go to church you
[1:33:16] do good things that's fine when you live
[1:33:18] your life to yourself you haven't eaten
[1:33:20] a life
[1:33:22] eternal life is living for others and I
[1:33:25] know it's not striking yet but one day
[1:33:27] it will
[1:33:28] one day truly will because some of our
[1:33:31] behavior is based upon selfishness
[1:33:33] plain nasty filthy selfishness
[1:33:36] is because you into you
[1:33:38] some people's actions is because of self
[1:33:41] pure self
[1:33:42] and I recognize selfish evidence you
[1:33:44] have not died
[1:33:46] because self is what you defend and
[1:33:48] anytime you defend yourself you are
[1:33:50] still alive and kicking
[1:33:52] you have a coffee in front of here if
[1:33:54] you're on service all of a sudden he had
[1:33:55] come up here
[1:33:58] you see you dead
[1:34:00] when you push down your head your foot
[1:34:01] come up
[1:34:02] it's this message
[1:34:07] if you see somebody call from and you
[1:34:09] touch them so and they talk
[1:34:13] that person's not dead
[1:34:16] they're alive
[1:34:17] and when we die somebody could spit on
[1:34:20] your coffee it doesn't matter there's a
[1:34:22] lion here
[1:34:23] you have no response to that
[1:34:26] because you are dead
[1:34:27] that's why everybody said he opened up
[1:34:29] his mouth
[1:34:30] they beat him they do whatever they want
[1:34:32] for Jesus he didn't respond to that
[1:34:34] oh give the Lord a shout
[1:34:36] so your self-defense or as well preach
[1:34:39] your excuses exposes how Alive You Are I
[1:34:43] did this because
[1:34:46] that is when I said brother Papa behind
[1:34:47] his head
[1:34:49] you're not supposed
[1:34:52] if he didn't do that I was gonna do this
[1:34:54] if she didn't say that I wasn't going to
[1:34:55] say this you saying it because you want
[1:34:57] to
[1:34:57] you saying it because you choose to you
[1:35:00] don't have to but you choose to and I
[1:35:02] speak my mind
[1:35:03] I'm not lit for my mouth I see how they
[1:35:05] get a lead you know foreign
[1:35:21] watch when you say you go to church and
[1:35:24] you do good things that's fine but when
[1:35:26] you live
[1:35:27] life to yourself you haven't eaten alive
[1:35:31] eternal life is living for others
[1:35:34] someone said how can you stand and let
[1:35:38] anybody call you such bad names question
[1:35:42] you don't live for yourself
[1:35:44] you live for others that you might
[1:35:46] redeem
[1:35:48] that man
[1:35:49] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[1:35:51] the church has forgotten they were Sons
[1:35:54] you are taking Christ's place you are
[1:35:56] Sons so don't lift yourself live for
[1:35:59] others well brother Branham I can live
[1:36:02] for this brother because he saw is a
[1:36:04] nice man
[1:36:05] that's not it
[1:36:07] live
[1:36:08] for that man who hates you
[1:36:16] saw lady amen
[1:36:20] you know you want to you want to live
[1:36:22] for the man who can use with bread
[1:36:25] and who feel let it bring ice cream for
[1:36:27] you
[1:36:28] I'm nice and this one nice to treat a
[1:36:30] nice you know they bring some food you
[1:36:32] didn't ask them
[1:36:34] you want to live for that
[1:36:35] what about this
[1:36:40] after they say crucify him
[1:36:43] look what barely kindness is
[1:36:45] look what love is on top of early
[1:36:46] kindness
[1:36:47] Jesus had to say it you know
[1:36:50] yeah
[1:36:52] yeah
[1:36:53] call them bunch of Rascals have to die
[1:36:56] for them them Sinners down there oh God
[1:36:58] they're killing me
[1:37:00] no he didn't say that God you say father
[1:37:04] forgive them
[1:37:06] they don't know what they're doing
[1:37:08] they know not what they do
[1:37:10] he had to express it manifested
[1:37:14] clear it before he could give up the
[1:37:16] ghost
[1:37:17] well give the Lord a shout
[1:37:19] broadly kindness have to be expressed
[1:37:23] spoken manifested
[1:37:26] Oh Glory to God be caught before we go
[1:37:28] to the next level because the next level
[1:37:30] was going to bring forth of Resurrection
[1:37:31] oh give the Lord a shout at the next
[1:37:34] level before the voice of the archangel
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:41] watch
[1:37:42] live for that person who will kill you
[1:37:45] if they could
[1:37:50] like my wife had a dream of somebody pet
[1:37:52] memories
[1:37:54] is that just part of the dream and I
[1:37:56] said the only reason they permanent
[1:37:57] toilet paper because I didn't have
[1:37:58] nothing else
[1:38:02] that's the only reason
[1:38:03] that was the only reason they're gonna
[1:38:04] put their hand on
[1:38:07] if they're only I'd find a big Stone a
[1:38:09] cut class or anything else they might
[1:38:11] tell that too but that's all they had
[1:38:13] to leave them alone
[1:38:25] all right so here we go now
[1:38:28] he said no I can live for this brother
[1:38:30] because he sure is a nice man
[1:38:32] that's not it live for that man who
[1:38:34] hates you live for that person who will
[1:38:37] kill you if they could that is what
[1:38:39] they'd done to him they killed him and
[1:38:42] he died that he might save them
[1:38:45] that is eternal life when you get it you
[1:38:47] and his bosom you are facing heaven then
[1:38:50] but you sacrifice your own things give
[1:38:52] them away like the sheep gives it wool
[1:38:54] you look towards Calvary Matthew 16 4 24
[1:38:57] says then Jesus said unto his disciples
[1:39:01] this is disciples
[1:39:02] If any man will come after me
[1:39:06] let him deny himself
[1:39:09] and take up his cross
[1:39:10] and follow me
[1:39:12] that is Matthew
[1:39:13] you know Luke say that same thing
[1:39:16] I will find print in it and he said unto
[1:39:18] them all if any man will come after me
[1:39:21] let them deny himself
[1:39:23] and take up his cross daily
[1:39:28] so if you read that first scripture I
[1:39:30] just say well I become a cross
[1:39:33] dress it down
[1:39:36] it's like scripture correct that
[1:39:39] they're not Ascend the cross
[1:39:41] a Wednesday cross this is the daily
[1:39:43] cross hey you want a long dress boy
[1:39:46] yeah
[1:39:47] on a Monday or Tuesday Wednesday Tuesday
[1:39:51] night the long distance on Sunday
[1:39:55] cross that you playing yourself
[1:39:57] like what you want to do and God will
[1:39:59] allow that yeah
[1:40:00] because they're forcing the way to dress
[1:40:01] right you know
[1:40:03] as I say if you want to lose weight go
[1:40:04] ahead and come down and shave your fat
[1:40:05] and shave yourself and lose weight
[1:40:07] enough gonna say oh gosh I can't pull it
[1:40:10] out without you know no it's your choice
[1:40:13] if you look at your dad and exercise and
[1:40:15] whatnot it will go down
[1:40:16] come in the sweep your house
[1:40:18] go there coming to work on the job you
[1:40:20] come do some computer
[1:40:24] to work
[1:40:26] Adam you're getting trouble with his
[1:40:29] speed
[1:40:31] there was no mandatory so he put man in
[1:40:33] dust to fill his soul and God as Adam
[1:40:35] Adam Adam Adam lazy lazy God I pray not
[1:40:38] God coming and pick up them so yes
[1:40:40] he put man to work
[1:40:42] he put us to labor to work
[1:40:48] they say they don't get moving and think
[1:40:49] it burns will get stiff
[1:40:52] I won't think about that
[1:40:54] you ever see them old people feeling
[1:40:56] yeah remember a friend of mine next
[1:40:59] neighbor Johnny Phillip his father was
[1:41:01] all in the 80s and he always doing
[1:41:03] something like in fact
[1:41:10] you guys see all people in a rocking
[1:41:11] Jesus rocket
[1:41:13] Road
[1:41:16] we're eating that we see that in church
[1:41:19] but them old folks know better than that
[1:41:22] I keep doing
[1:41:23] that I keep doing something I keep the
[1:41:26] bones they keep the brains keep
[1:41:27] everything alive
[1:41:28] so you can expect to be in church doing
[1:41:30] nothing when you're praying you're
[1:41:32] praying and you're closing of the prayer
[1:41:34] Lord you're talking long field try to
[1:41:36] pray more than your talk on Facebook try
[1:41:37] to pray to pray more now all them stupid
[1:41:40] videos people telling you and you press
[1:41:42] and play five minutes ten minutes 15
[1:41:45] minutes 20 minutes are all video
[1:41:47] watching unlimental nonsense on Facebook
[1:41:49] on YouTube or or on WhatsApp
[1:41:53] put your deposit in prayer and bring
[1:41:55] fire inside of here bring fire Sunday
[1:41:57] morning
[1:41:58] bring it this Resurrection morning and
[1:42:00] see where God wouldn't explode with
[1:42:02] power inside of here
[1:42:04] let me all people know
[1:42:07] Jesus it's in John 12 24.
[1:42:11] very less empty I'm going to close very
[1:42:13] nice and to you except the corner we
[1:42:14] phoned you wrong and died about alone if
[1:42:15] you're diving for much food unless a
[1:42:18] grain of corn falls in the ground and
[1:42:20] rot unless a man rocks to his own
[1:42:22] theology unless you rotten to the
[1:42:24] Methodist theology right in the Baptist
[1:42:26] theology written to Pentecost
[1:42:27] intelligence until you grow up to those
[1:42:29] things and give yourself into the hands
[1:42:30] of God then the old man will die new man
[1:42:33] will be born there is no way around it
[1:42:36] can't avoid it this is it okay so here
[1:42:39] what he said you know take that wheat
[1:42:41] how could one grain of wheat here's what
[1:42:43] happens one grain Falls in it brings for
[1:42:45] 100 greens under a good Falls in bring
[1:42:47] for a thousand greens thousand greens
[1:42:48] fall in before the Midland green I mean
[1:42:50] I'm gonna fall in a batch load that's
[1:42:52] what he meant if I live my life alone
[1:42:54] and die this way I live my life alone
[1:42:57] there'll be no food after me but if I
[1:42:59] fall into the ground under the will of
[1:43:00] God I will bring forth a new birth and
[1:43:03] in that new boat will bring forth
[1:43:04] another new bird
[1:43:05] so the law of God is a nature you put a
[1:43:07] seed it goes only wrong and die it's
[1:43:09] been for the corn stalk and everything
[1:43:10] else get more fruit That's the Law of
[1:43:12] nature if we die to ourselves what's
[1:43:14] going to happen Christ will become the
[1:43:15] ooze out of your life this husband will
[1:43:18] see it your children will see it your
[1:43:19] family will see it you don't tell them
[1:43:21] come to church they will see something
[1:43:22] inside of you it has to be inside of you
[1:43:24] let me wrap up here now
[1:43:28] you cannot find Christ until you die to
[1:43:31] yourself and accept him the word and
[1:43:34] then you'll find life
[1:43:35] and when you die to yourself with Christ
[1:43:38] like economy then the word lives in you
[1:43:40] brings forth the same results it doesn't
[1:43:43] matter which church you go to and which
[1:43:44] you to join
[1:43:45] people leave this church go to that
[1:43:47] church that is just it and they don't
[1:43:48] want to die
[1:43:49] that's the problem there you know it's
[1:43:51] debt
[1:43:54] because some people won't have their own
[1:43:55] way and because they can't have their
[1:43:57] own way that's a problem
[1:43:58] they don't rebuke they don't want
[1:44:00] correction they really want almost like
[1:44:02] a like a Talus man like you have a lucky
[1:44:05] charm they won't go to a lucky charm
[1:44:07] some people with that channel pocket
[1:44:08] something in the pocket and because they
[1:44:09] have that in the pocket they believe
[1:44:10] that they'll be blessed that how they
[1:44:12] use gospel that's not what God teaches
[1:44:14] here he wants you your ears your eyes
[1:44:17] your heart your life he wants you isn't
[1:44:20] that right I'm gonna close
[1:44:22] they are fine people good people
[1:44:25] not all that said Lord Lord but the one
[1:44:27] that doeth the will of my father not he
[1:44:29] that stats is he that finishes
[1:44:32] there are no shortcuts say it after me
[1:44:36] they are no shortcuts
[1:44:39] say it again there are no shortcuts
[1:44:42] one more time there are no shortcuts
[1:44:45] hear what he says now you must come just
[1:44:47] the way the scripture said
[1:44:50] not he that starts
[1:44:52] is he that finishes there are no
[1:44:54] shortcuts you are disqualified at the
[1:44:57] end of the race
[1:44:58] you must come just the way the scripture
[1:45:00] says you come that way except you die to
[1:45:05] yourself and be born of the spirit of
[1:45:08] God you are lost
[1:45:10] that is all
[1:45:11] there are no shortcuts
[1:45:13] oh my
[1:45:16] God
[1:45:17] there's coming an hour you're gonna play
[1:45:19] something I'm finished
[1:45:21] when God shall make the world
[1:45:24] bow at the feet of men and women
[1:45:28] who have plunged through
[1:45:30] and cross Jordan and separate them
[1:45:33] things
[1:45:34] themselves some of the things of the
[1:45:36] world
[1:45:37] God Will Make the World bow
[1:45:41] I think there was one of the Brothers in
[1:45:44] the Jewish ages
[1:45:46] he was preaching or speaking or
[1:45:48] something like that
[1:45:49] and somebody didn't want to send have
[1:45:51] respects
[1:45:53] and God setting fire under a seat
[1:45:57] you jump up
[1:46:01] goats and fire in his pants
[1:46:08] the world will power the feet of women
[1:46:11] not just pastors and no men and women
[1:46:13] who Cross Jordan
[1:46:18] Lord I want
[1:46:20] to be
[1:46:22] a Christian in my heart
[1:46:25] listen friends
[1:46:27] I am seeing the power of decisions
[1:46:31] God can't force you to be saved
[1:46:34] God can't force you to get baptized
[1:46:37] God can't force you to save him the same
[1:46:40] way he give Adam and Eve that freedom of
[1:46:43] choice
[1:46:44] he given you that freedom of choice
[1:46:48] you have to choose to follow after him
[1:46:51] he said he that cometh after me
[1:46:53] Jesus walking and you falling after him
[1:46:55] God I want to follow you and he turns it
[1:46:57] wrong and say okay thank you for
[1:46:58] following me he said take up your cross
[1:47:00] daily
[1:47:01] and follow after me let's pray father
