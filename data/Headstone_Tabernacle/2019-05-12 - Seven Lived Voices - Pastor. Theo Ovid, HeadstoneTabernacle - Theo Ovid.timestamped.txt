[1:11:01] some in my heart that's that Amen so
[1:11:04] let's understand you want to go into the
[1:11:06] world
[1:11:06] Thank You musicians we certainly
[1:11:08] appreciate the singing under worship the
[1:11:11] atmosphere we have three portion of
[1:11:14] scriptures we like to Reese and John
[1:11:15] chapter five wanna be from verse 36 to
[1:11:18] 41 I read from 2nd Peter 1 we want to
[1:11:22] read from verse 3 to 12 also revelation
[1:11:26] 10 1 to 7
[1:11:41] this is Jesus speaking it's in John
[1:11:44] chapter 5 from 536 but I have agreed a
[1:11:49] witness than that of John for the works
[1:11:52] which the father had given me to finish
[1:11:55] the same works that I do be a witness of
[1:12:00] me that the father had sent me and the
[1:12:04] father himself which had sent me had
[1:12:08] borne witness of me this is important
[1:12:13] now listen what he's telling them you
[1:12:14] have neither heard his voice at any time
[1:12:16] nor seen his sheep and he have not his
[1:12:23] word abiding in you for whom he had sent
[1:12:28] he believed not then he says these words
[1:12:33] search the scripture so this word he's
[1:12:37] talking about is not Scripture he's
[1:12:39] talking about the word in them and
[1:12:41] search the scripture for in them you
[1:12:45] think you have eternal life but they are
[1:12:49] they which testify of me verse 40 and
[1:12:54] you will not come to me that you might
[1:12:58] have life Wow
[1:13:01] second Peter one whose tree according as
[1:13:05] his divine power given to us all things
[1:13:08] that pertain to life and godliness
[1:13:09] through the knowledge of him that had
[1:13:12] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:13:15] are given unto us exceeding precious
[1:13:17] great and precious promises now by D's
[1:13:19] he might be partakers of the divine
[1:13:22] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:13:23] that is in the world who lust and
[1:13:27] besides this given all diligence add to
[1:13:29] your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:13:31] knowledge and the knowledge temperance
[1:13:33] and to temperance patience the patience
[1:13:36] godliness to godliness brotherly
[1:13:37] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[1:13:39] charity and if these things be in you
[1:13:42] and abound they make you that you shall
[1:13:44] neither be barren on fruitful in the
[1:13:46] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:13:49] he did look at these things is blind
[1:13:51] cannot see afar off forgotten that he
[1:13:54] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[1:13:56] the rather brethren give divisions to
[1:13:58] make a call in election sure or if you
[1:14:01] do these things you shall never fall for
[1:14:04] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[1:14:05] you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:14:07] kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:10] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:14:14] you always in immense of remembrance of
[1:14:17] these things though you know them and be
[1:14:20] established in the present truth and
[1:14:23] from religions up to ten familiar
[1:14:25] Scripture I saw another mighty angel
[1:14:27] come down from heaven to with a cloud a
[1:14:29] rainbow I was upon his head his face was
[1:14:33] the Sun his feet as pillars of fire he
[1:14:36] had in his hand a little book open his
[1:14:38] set his right foot upon the sea his left
[1:14:40] foot on the earth car with a loud voice
[1:14:42] on a lion roar it a wing had cried seven
[1:14:45] thunders uttered the voices when the
[1:14:47] seven thunders uttered their voices I
[1:14:48] was about to write I get a voice from
[1:14:50] heaven saying unto me seek up those
[1:14:52] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:14:54] and write them not and the angel which I
[1:14:56] saw stand upon the sea upon the earth
[1:14:59] lift up his hand to heaven and swear by
[1:15:02] him that liveth for ever and ever who
[1:15:04] created heaven and things that therein
[1:15:05] are on the earth and the things that are
[1:15:07] Darren are and the sea and the things
[1:15:09] which are therein that there should be
[1:15:11] time no longer so time runs out but in
[1:15:15] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:15:17] angel when he shall begin to song the
[1:15:20] mystery of God shall be finished as he
[1:15:22] hath declared to his servants the
[1:15:24] prophets let's borrow his father we
[1:15:25] thank you for your word God you know
[1:15:27] what's in my heart I was spoken to my
[1:15:30] heart Lord I know I come Lord and unless
[1:15:33] pray or helped me tonight I'm take me
[1:15:35] onto the way and speak your word to your
[1:15:37] people I don't know why we got this this
[1:15:39] morning but Lord this is what we have
[1:15:40] are we gonna share it or may drink food
[1:15:43] and bread on the table
[1:15:44] granted father and Jesus and I ask it
[1:15:46] amen and amen
[1:15:47] you may be seated oh praise the Lord
[1:15:58] this morning I have a title and the
[1:16:01] title is seven lived voices that's a
[1:16:06] title seven live voices amen
[1:16:11] other thing a context scripture like to
[1:16:14] read from this is from second
[1:16:18] constructor treat of the finite due week
[1:16:19] again begin to commend ourselves or need
[1:16:23] we as others epistles of commendation to
[1:16:25] you or letters of combination for a from
[1:16:28] you ye are our epistle written in our
[1:16:32] hearts known and read of all men
[1:16:35] you are our writen so this is not a
[1:16:39] reading of text you become that live in
[1:16:42] text or living word so now today you're
[1:16:47] gonna hear about these voices but not
[1:16:50] just normal voices is that talk is
[1:16:52] living word spirit word spirit voice
[1:16:58] good voice you said for as much as ye
[1:17:02] are manifestly declared to be the
[1:17:04] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:17:06] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:17:09] of the Living God not in tables of spoon
[1:17:13] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[1:17:16] so this writin is a little different
[1:17:19] it's not on paper it's in your heart
[1:17:22] God writing and making you become a
[1:17:25] written epistle where when people read
[1:17:27] the scripture they could see you when
[1:17:30] you read a scripture you could see you
[1:17:32] because you become a written epistle
[1:17:34] what your red-meat manifests what's in
[1:17:38] the word become manifest hallelujah
[1:17:41] you're not born God didn't make you
[1:17:43] human just see if he could make humans
[1:17:44] you have a purpose behind you being here
[1:17:47] on earth Oh glory that God there make
[1:17:50] are the prophets that just to see if you
[1:17:52] could make car they make cars our
[1:17:53] purpose God make you for a purpose you
[1:17:55] in services model for a purpose you may
[1:17:58] have your agenda but God of a purpose
[1:17:59] behind you be in here and that purpose
[1:18:02] must be fulfilled and if you understand
[1:18:05] that there is no trial there is nothing
[1:18:06] present
[1:18:07] come with a stop that purpose of God
[1:18:10] from pre fulfill in your life and God
[1:18:15] Himself have a purpose but not canceled
[1:18:17] his purpose for anybody he's not change
[1:18:19] this man he say your thoughts are not my
[1:18:22] thoughts your ways are not my ways
[1:18:24] he said praise God my words shall not
[1:18:26] return unto me void so when God releases
[1:18:30] word he releases world with an objective
[1:18:32] behind it he releases word with a hook
[1:18:34] behind it he really is a word knowing
[1:18:37] something else to come back with it God
[1:18:39] not wasted words we speak idle words we
[1:18:46] speak free words we say what we want to
[1:18:48] say an altar Taner
[1:18:49] but the God he is perfect there is
[1:18:53] nothing to be added front to him he
[1:18:55] can't get more eyes because he is wisdom
[1:18:58] he can't know nothing new because he
[1:19:01] know the end from the beginning
[1:19:02] we believe that this morning so he knows
[1:19:06] all about your life you know all about
[1:19:08] your failures you know all about your
[1:19:10] shortcomings you know all we're gonna
[1:19:12] happen next week and still we put your
[1:19:14] name on the book that's why usually
[1:19:16] praising God continually no child should
[1:19:24] be so hard as you can't praise God no
[1:19:27] testing so deep that you can't praise
[1:19:28] God when job got his jamming job said
[1:19:32] the Lord gives the Lord taketh away
[1:19:33] blessed be the name of the Lord and the
[1:19:35] devil had to take that to the stripe and
[1:19:37] snake it because a son of God was
[1:19:40] confessing who he was and who is follow
[1:19:43] us or get the Lord I showed up raised
[1:19:46] brother
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:49] hallelujah the only reason got to call
[1:19:52] the devil attention to job is because I
[1:19:54] want to prove something but what you see
[1:19:57] is in that man it's not what around him
[1:20:02] that make him what he is is what's in
[1:20:06] him but make him what he is is what are
[1:20:10] you going to make you what you are
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:16] that's why the promise of the secret is
[1:20:19] the word is in the brain
[1:20:21] that's the secret the word is in the
[1:20:25] brain but would have to come inside of
[1:20:27] you Oh glory to God you hear what I'm
[1:20:30] saying glory to God a man hallelujah
[1:20:34] praise God seven live voices not as a
[1:20:39] description but an action live by you
[1:20:42] and through you
[1:20:45] oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:20:48] hallelujah but a Branham from future
[1:20:52] homies I always find my messages is know
[1:20:54] the way I always find my message is by
[1:20:57] prayer I'll be sitting in prayer and
[1:21:01] something reveals to me and I wait a few
[1:21:03] minutes and see if it's right and then
[1:21:05] sometime I keep waiting till it breaks
[1:21:07] into our vision and then I go to the
[1:21:10] scripture that is ought to be the
[1:21:13] confirmation of every spiritual thing
[1:21:15] that's done because the Bible is the
[1:21:17] complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:22] so God's strategy is on position my per
[1:21:25] witness is to take empty human vessels
[1:21:28] and shake the world with them dice watch
[1:21:32] strategy empty human vessels and shake
[1:21:36] the world with them like a Pentecost a
[1:21:39] Pentecost what did he do he take them 10
[1:21:41] days to get or emptied up and when they
[1:21:44] all standing there with their vessels
[1:21:45] turned up God poked himself and fill
[1:21:48] them up that is all and they shook the
[1:21:52] world ignorant men men that carried all
[1:21:56] right nor degree nor CXC nor GCE nor PhD
[1:22:03] but they shook the world or give the
[1:22:07] Lord some praises people that's the need
[1:22:10] of today that's what we need today is
[1:22:12] empty vessels so God can fill them up
[1:22:15] and you cannot listen God cannot use
[1:22:18] them as long as they already filled up
[1:22:21] if we follow your thoughts and your
[1:22:24] ideas and what your pink and your
[1:22:25] temperature you feel of something
[1:22:27] already
[1:22:27] so go on our room no space like what he
[1:22:36] said
[1:22:36] clip put some tone from Jamaica talking
[1:22:39] about she went to some funeral I mean
[1:22:41] mine who died was a motif and he passed
[1:22:44] I seen all kind of nice will body man on
[1:22:49] the moon so funny and she said really
[1:22:51] she said she has tried to hold she pees
[1:22:52] all his I'm very good everybody really
[1:22:53] funny that a tea for what that passes in
[1:22:55] nice words she said she couldn't hold
[1:22:57] back when he passes the less prefer so
[1:22:59] they go to heaven she said that is when
[1:23:03] she woke him out and tell him room for
[1:23:08] me who has done it the hell she said
[1:23:12] said nobody belong that was something my
[1:23:20] hallelujah
[1:23:21] so you have to be filled up so God can
[1:23:24] fill up heaven with ascetic rocks and
[1:23:26] whatnot where you go for company that'll
[1:23:31] at least six dimensions for their sins
[1:23:33] who going on before God have a place
[1:23:36] reserved for them that never cooks and
[1:23:38] bandits and teeth trying to come to
[1:23:39] purgatory and come to the Catholic
[1:23:41] Church or come to 205 I'm chillin Mary
[1:23:43] no and there's a message causing a
[1:23:45] message and there's a way to get to
[1:23:47] where we supposed to go there is no
[1:23:50] other way there is only one way you have
[1:23:53] to want to know that one way you are
[1:23:57] plenty is is one way you after the word
[1:24:00] your name come out the book the tape
[1:24:02] from the wagon and come out the book
[1:24:04] this is serious
[1:24:07] remember when that which is perfect is
[1:24:10] come God s acceptance after that in the
[1:24:13] time of ignorance God winked because you
[1:24:15] don't know but when you come to full
[1:24:17] knowledge Jesus said no you have those
[1:24:19] your sins dear with you because I come
[1:24:21] to bring light on the word or give the
[1:24:24] Lord some praises so God cannot use them
[1:24:26] as long as they got filled up you got
[1:24:29] full of theological training court can
[1:24:31] use you is cut
[1:24:32] empty vessels to fill them and they had
[1:24:35] empty vessels in Pentecost got to fill
[1:24:37] them brother this daily man's that this
[1:24:40] day you got to have that we will have
[1:24:42] that or perish and that's how I want you
[1:24:44] to get to that I have to have this Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost
[1:24:46] I've got to get these dynamics I've got
[1:24:48] to get this power chord in me I'm coming
[1:24:50] to church for years but that's not good
[1:24:51] enough
[1:24:52] give me something more than that you let
[1:24:54] your pastor you love what you preach and
[1:24:55] that's good but that's not good enough
[1:24:56] you need something more than pastor
[1:24:58] preach and you need God Almighty
[1:25:00] that's why Jesus search the Scriptures
[1:25:02] for in them you think eternal life and
[1:25:04] these guys was going to church they was
[1:25:07] going to Pharisees and Sadducees he said
[1:25:09] but you wouldn't come to me that you
[1:25:10] might have life you see the person have
[1:25:12] life or give the Lord a shout in the
[1:25:15] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:25:17] with God and the Word was God
[1:25:20] ha ha that's not written word you know
[1:25:23] that is the Lord a shout in him was life
[1:25:27] and the life was the light of men or
[1:25:30] glory in this living would shout living
[1:25:33] with something or I can say living word
[1:25:36] that living would have to come inside of
[1:25:38] you
[1:25:39] oh Jesus let's continue brother the lid
[1:25:43] of Hell has come off the linens come off
[1:25:47] of Hell and dreams of demon power is
[1:25:50] pointing from everywhere you can't see
[1:25:53] that you walk in normal normal normal
[1:25:55] but you have seen the little of Hell
[1:25:57] come on come out and streams of demon
[1:25:59] powers streaming into homes streaming
[1:26:02] upon families cheery little churches
[1:26:04] stream of demon powers listen to this
[1:26:07] what porn from everywhere is
[1:26:09] concatenations it conquered politics
[1:26:12] till it's rotten to the core
[1:26:13] it conquered the churches until they

[1:26:43] spirit but the spirit have you do I
[1:26:47] asked out is this the word is this the

[1:27:03] prisoner I'm Jesus Christ or get the
[1:27:07] Lord a shout God looking for prisoners
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:15] Paul said I cannot move on table feet I
[1:27:18] can't heal the sick I cannot answer the
[1:27:20] Bible I can go to seminary with all this
[1:27:22] stuff everything else I'm nothing yet

[1:27:34] name of Christianity teaching for
[1:27:38] doctrines the commandments of men
[1:27:41] Theological Seminary doctrines leave in
[1:27:44] the Bible alone who was able who is
[1:27:47] strong enough who is wise enough who is
[1:27:51] powerful enough to tame this Legion
[1:27:54] chipping the clothes of a woman in the
[1:27:57] name of preachers Methodist Baptist
[1:27:59] Pentecostal paint in your face and jazz
[1:28:01] no Baba near wearing pants like men our
[1:28:05] preachers not enough about them to tell
[1:28:07] them about his devil possessed who is
[1:28:10] this roaring devil a penetration of
[1:28:13] power publishers powerless and lukewarm
[1:28:16] who is this roaring devil who is strong
[1:28:20] enough what kind of the nomination is
[1:28:23] able to come to him walking up and don't
[1:28:25] you pass we don't need a Holy Ghost who
[1:28:29] can tame that devil God we we can't do
[1:28:33] it by denomination we can't do it by
[1:28:36] ecological forces but there was a voice
[1:28:38] one time that did it
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:42] there was a voice one time that did it
[1:28:46] that came them devils and put them in
[1:28:49] the right man and put clothes on them
[1:28:51] that same voice came as i promised to

[1:29:17] don't need any organization or Gaia some
[1:29:23] praises in the house this morning and

[1:39:16] money and the beasts break the Covenant
[1:39:19] and then he cheers out the rest of the
[1:39:21] woman's seed like that and split water
[1:39:23] out of his mouth mix war there will be
[1:39:25] weeping and will not listen when the
[1:39:27] bride is raptured that peace will be
[1:39:29] angry enough he'll be looking for the
[1:39:31] foolish virgins
[1:39:32] all right and the bride is getting
[1:39:34] married and glory at the same time he
[1:39:38] said don't miss it friends god help me I
[1:39:40] want to be there I don't care what it
[1:39:43] cost I want to be there do you want to
[1:39:47] be there or you want to fellowship with
[1:39:49] tribulation Saints because a lot of them
[1:39:52] you know notice the same time this is
[1:39:56] going on just before this takes place
[1:39:59] God has promised he would send us a true
[1:40:02] prophet of the true word with a message
[1:40:06] this need to return to the original Word
[1:40:10] of God and faith of the father's to
[1:40:14] bring down the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:17] amongst the people with a power that
[1:40:21] will raise her up above these things and
[1:40:23] take her in at the same time
[1:40:27] so let's go over that again a profit
[1:40:32] with a message the message is to return
[1:40:36] to the original world and the fate
[1:40:41] what's the purpose to bring the power of
[1:40:45] the Holy Ghost among the people that's
[1:40:48] the purpose do you see the professor
[1:40:50] the message is to come back to the
[1:40:52] original and the fate that they had the
[1:41:00] purpose of that is the pull down I just
[1:41:03] read for you the professor Tuffy the
[1:41:04] Holy Ghost is here and I feel you I fear
[1:41:09] to move it
[1:41:10] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:41:14] you know this put together here I
[1:41:16] believe you see the connection it's all
[1:41:18] supernatural this is the quarter just
[1:41:20] read I said just from the Nugget I
[1:41:21] thought there was an independent nugget
[1:41:23] but that not that connected to what we
[1:41:25] say no next you have failed to move the
[1:41:28] Holy Ghost from United time and science
[1:41:37] is time for the 19 of men and women of
[1:41:40] every race every color every Creed under
[1:41:42] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:45] and back to the world therefore it was
[1:41:48] not possible until no God promised in
[1:41:51] the last days the faith of the fathers
[1:41:55] would be restored back to the bride
[1:41:56] again and it could be this way it
[1:41:59] couldn't be nor the time but this time
[1:42:00] and this was only made possible when God
[1:42:04] sent the seven seals and give us a sign
[1:42:07] by it and send seven a dozen from heaven
[1:42:09] and come to bring back the scattered
[1:42:11] wood and Emmy nominations and tie it
[1:42:13] back into the word again to bring down
[1:42:16] his holy spirit or glory to God to this
[1:42:19] anointing this power was only impossible
[1:42:21] when the seven see will release think
[1:42:24] about the seven seas of gathering
[1:42:25] gathering all the scattered word because
[1:42:28] word is spirit so if the one that get
[1:42:31] back the fullness of the Spirit you have
[1:42:33] to gather the fullness of the world
[1:42:36] so the seven feasts were sent to gather
[1:42:39] the fullness of the word to bring it
[1:42:41] back into the church and that fullness
[1:42:43] Godhead was Toby son a man Jesus the
[1:42:47] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:42:49] what's the reveal the last days so put a
[1:42:52] Branham at the host that he had to
[1:42:54] cattle it up you have to have that
[1:42:57] Solomon to reveal Solomon which is the
[1:43:01] full word because the full Holy Ghost
[1:43:03] after release upon this church because
[1:43:06] that full devil is going to be released
[1:43:09] the posture with this bride or give the
[1:43:12] Lord a shock to know God full dinner
[1:43:16] meeting full god full quad could be in
[1:43:19] the bride this brag will be anointed you

[1:49:43] back in the scriptures then when the
[1:49:47] lamb took the book and brought that
[1:49:50] first seal
[1:49:50] God spoke from his eternal throne to see
[1:49:53] what that scene was to be revealed and
[1:49:55] then it was placed before John it was in
[1:49:58] symbol form when John saw it it was
[1:50:00] still a mystery red horse white horse
[1:50:02] black horse symbols isn't that right it
[1:50:05] wasn't even reveal right then it cannot
[1:50:08] be revealed until what he said here at
[1:50:09] the end time but a common symbol now
[1:50:13] remember a loud clapping noise of a
[1:50:15] panda is the voice of God
[1:50:18] that's what the Bible said a cup of
[1:50:21] thunder they thought he was a thunder
[1:50:23] but it was God he understood it for it
[1:50:26] was revealed to him it was a thunder or

[2:06:34] to be understood seven thunders of
[2:06:37] Revelation may he show the ride how to
[2:06:40] prepare for create translation see all
[2:06:43] glowing is what it doesn't matter when
[2:06:45] the Lord come if you are ready you are
[2:06:46] fine you can come no because come
[2:06:49] whenever you want to come but if you're

[2:06:56] the Lord or glory to God hallelujah get
[2:07:00] the Lord a show
[2:07:03] [Applause]
[2:07:06] ox ox 17:11 says these were more noble
[2:07:13] than those in Thessalonica for they
[2:07:16] received the word with all readiness of
[2:07:19] mind and searched the Scriptures daily
[2:07:22] to see whether these things are true
[2:07:25] they received the word that was being
[2:07:28] spoken to them plus the sister
[2:07:30] scriptures it was a living word it was
[2:07:34] the Word of Life coming from these
[2:07:36] apostles and these prophets and these
[2:07:38] teachers and these pastors and these
[2:07:40] ministers it was the word of a life that
[2:07:43] would speaking was God that must live in
[2:07:48] word that was the early church and we
[2:07:51] are going to go back to that where the
[2:07:53] word spoke I'm going to be living word
[2:07:57] living voice word living spirit voice
[2:08:01] word Matthew 21 42 says Jesus said unto
[2:08:07] them did he not did you never read the
[2:08:09] scriptures the stone which the builders
[2:08:13] rejected the same has become the head of
[2:08:16] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[2:08:18] it is marvelous in our eyes
[2:08:21] now the word scripture thing is a Greek
[2:08:24] is a word called GRA P is e they never
[2:08:27] numbering 1 1 2 4 it means a writing
[2:08:31] acting written the scripture used to
[2:08:36] denote the book itself or its contents
[2:08:39] or certain portion of section of the
[2:08:42] Holy Scripture
[2:08:43] so therefore this scripture this word
[2:08:46] grouchy or non pronounce it the
[2:08:48] scripture used to denote the book itself
[2:08:50] or its contents a certain portion or
[2:08:52] section a statement in scripture so when
[2:08:55] he said the scripture he means says the
[2:08:57] written word
[2:09:01] but John 1:1 set in the beginning was
[2:09:04] the word and the Word was with God and
[2:09:08] the Word was God
[2:09:10] and that word really is Lobos which is a
[2:09:14] different thing altogether it means a
[2:09:16] word uttered by a living voice scripture
[2:09:22] is written but Lobos word is living a
[2:09:26] word uttered by a living voice no you
[2:09:29] will see when we go in and Leroy says a
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:37] speech a word uttered by a living voice
[2:09:41] and body is a conceptional idea what
[2:09:45] someone said the sayings of God a decree
[2:09:49] amanda's are order the more precepts
[2:09:52] given by God Old Testament prophecy
[2:09:55] given by the prophets what is declared a
[2:09:57] thought a declaration a witticism
[2:10:00] a dictum a maxim or glory to God
[2:10:03] so this word logos I think it's 3:05 6
[2:10:06] calling logos a word uttered by a living
[2:10:09] voice and what is a conception of an
[2:10:13] idea hallelujah Hebrews 4:12 for the
[2:10:18] word of God is quick and powerful
[2:10:22] sharper than any two-edged sword
[2:10:24] piercing even the dividing asunder of
[2:10:27] soul and spirit of the choice and the
[2:10:29] marrow and is a discerner of the
[2:10:31] thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:10:32] that's hebrews 4:12 and the amplified
[2:10:35] and says for the word of god speaks is
[2:10:37] alive full of power making it active
[2:10:42] operative and the Jason an effective it
[2:10:45] is sharper than any two-edged sword
[2:10:47] penetrating to the dividing line of the
[2:10:50] breath of life soul and the immortal
[2:10:52] spirit of the joints and the marrow of
[2:10:54] the deepest parts of our nature exposing
[2:10:57] and sifting and analyzing and judging
[2:11:00] the very thoughts and purposes of the
[2:11:02] heart so that word that is the reasoner
[2:11:05] is not letter
[2:11:07] Senhora understand while Paul said they
[2:11:10] left a kill it but the spirit give it
[2:11:14] life no you could understand well Paul
[2:11:17] said I come with you - you never
[2:11:19] enticing words of man's wisdom but I
[2:11:22] come to you in the power and
[2:11:23] demonstration of the spirit that your
[2:11:25] faith may not rest in the wisdom of men
[2:11:28] but in the power of God or get the Lord
[2:11:31] a shout are you ride with me this
[2:11:33] morning John 6:63
[2:11:41] Jesus speakin it is the spirit that
[2:11:43] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[2:11:46] the words that I speak unto you they are
[2:11:49] spirit and they are life so he seems
[2:11:53] spirit different words it was living
[2:11:55] words Oh glory to God remember when
[2:11:58] Peter never walked the earth there was
[2:11:59] no Bible called the New Testament you
[2:12:02] have to receive them as from God they
[2:12:07] were bringing Louis word will give the
[2:12:10] Lord a shout understand that when Jesus
[2:12:13] came on the scene the book was only of
[2:12:15] the Malachi the New Testament not
[2:12:22] written yet but they were living
[2:12:24] epistles written epistles they will
[2:12:28] wrote me like the finger of God Oh
[2:12:30] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[2:12:35] no wonder P they can say obviously
[2:12:37] virtue and to virtue knowledge and the
[2:12:40] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[2:12:41] brotherly kindness he knew what he was
[2:12:43] talking about dies not attached like
[2:12:46] there's something on our board and we
[2:12:48] paint with colors that's not painted
[2:12:52] words I just live in Lucas words
[2:12:57] Oh hallelujah
[2:13:04] Laurita God thank you Jesus for me fees
[2:13:09] in church age 5th of December 1960
[2:13:14] Justin Saville what about saying all the
[2:13:17] byberry he's in here he's Almighty God
[2:13:20] fresh among us
[2:13:21] no father son Holy Ghost is not no tree
[2:13:23] God got chopped in three pieces is one
[2:13:25] God working in three offices the
[2:13:28] fatherhood the sonship and the Holy
[2:13:30] Ghost God
[2:13:31] condescending from the gardener Eden
[2:13:32] trying to make his way back into the
[2:13:34] human hands to live and be sons and
[2:13:38] daughters again with him that's God
[2:13:40] above us God with us
[2:13:42] no God in us now those things the
[2:13:46] battery reveals was thoroughly said in
[2:13:48] the first chapter of Revelation which is
[2:13:50] the only book Jesus put a seal on
[2:13:52] blessing that he that readeth on them
[2:13:53] here in might hear it so it's a curse
[2:13:56] for anyone to take anything away this is
[2:13:59] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:14:02] so if we have to make three entry you
[2:14:05] know what happened
[2:14:05] your name's goes out you search the
[2:14:09] scripture you say well that's bound to
[2:14:11] be I've never seen like that oh here it
[2:14:12] is it has to run from Genesis to
[2:14:16] Revelation whatever revelation whatever
[2:14:19] mystery has to run it can be one care
[2:14:21] he said he elephant the elephant line
[2:14:23] upon line precept upon precept not one
[2:14:25] court not one scripture line upon line
[2:14:27] it has to come from Genesis to
[2:14:30] Revelation are you with me this is
[2:14:32] another prophet I believe God can do
[2:14:34] things that are not written in this
[2:14:34] Bible I believe he can because he's God
[2:14:37] but just as long as he does what he
[2:14:39] promised yet is good enough for me
[2:14:43] I don't believe that anything should be
[2:14:46] others in this book or taking from it I
[2:14:48] believe this is the complete revelation
[2:14:50] of Jesus Christ I believe that that is
[2:14:52] what it is all doctrine anyhow must come
[2:14:56] from this Bible so anytime anybody can
[2:15:01] put the doctrine back in the Bible you
[2:15:03] have to leave it alone all doctrine is
[2:15:05] scripture so mankind brilliance that
[2:15:10] presents an worth I'm no scripture for
[2:15:13] thee because the revealed Word the fact
[2:15:17] we have a revealed word the world is
[2:15:19] Scripture is whatever I'm came to reveal
[2:15:21] the scriptures is not right he said no
[2:15:24] and if you catch me seeing things and
[2:15:26] doing things that's not scriptural and
[2:15:28] promise scripture for this hour the
[2:15:30] thing to do you owe it to me to see the
[2:15:33] manager to see that I am straighten up
[2:15:36] for it because I'm a human being and I
[2:15:38] want to go to heaven
[2:15:39] the same as the rest of you done Oh

[2:17:22] these things and for tell these things
[2:17:24] that happen as perfect as they are I'm
[2:17:26] only the one that near when he does it I
[2:17:28] was only a voice that he used to see it
[2:17:31] it wasn't what I knew it was what I
[2:17:34] surrendered myself to that he spoke true

[2:17:46] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man

[2:21:15] this morning Wow mama mia all glory
[2:21:22] hallelujah
[2:21:23] [Applause]
[2:21:25] could you take some more question
[2:21:32] Lancers 22 August 1964 just as well some
[2:21:38] say brother Branham is the son of man I
[2:21:41] taught the pillar of fire was the son of
[2:21:44] man am i mystique
[2:21:46] that's a good question very good but I
[2:21:49] am NOT the son of man but II Senora
[2:21:53] there's quite a difference
[2:21:55] Jesus Christ was the son of man the Son
[2:21:58] of God is sort of dated now the reason
[2:22:00] that question probably have been asked
[2:22:03] is because people regard me as a seer
[2:22:04] but I am NOT the anointed son of man he
[2:22:10] said now he's a prophet a preacher on
[2:22:11] the English dictionary is the Prophet is
[2:22:14] a seer one who foresees things and
[2:22:16] foretell things but under the English
[2:22:18] interpretation our prophet is a seer so
[2:22:19] I don't want to call myself anything but
[2:22:21] your brother I'm your brother and you
[2:22:23] just regard me as brother Bill but the
[2:22:24] Branham what do you want to that's fine
[2:22:27] no what was the other question I guess
[2:22:30] the one with this was either Solomon
[2:22:32] here the son of man was Attila fire
[2:22:33] Salomon no the pillar of fire is the
[2:22:37] anointing the pillar of fire now this
[2:22:40] may go a little deep now the pillar of
[2:22:43] fire is the logos
[2:22:47] that went out of God to Louis which is
[2:22:53] actually the attribute of the fullness
[2:22:56] of God when God become into a form to
[2:23:01] where it could be seen
[2:23:03] it was the anointing of the Great Spirit
[2:23:08] that went forth it condescending command
[2:23:11] on God the Father the logos that was
[2:23:13] over Israel the logos dwelt in a human
[2:23:17] body I was made a sacrifice and when man
[2:23:21] was in male in the image of God God
[2:23:24] common in the image of man to redeem man
[2:23:25] and brought heaven and did hug and kiss
[2:23:28] each other
[2:23:29] Gordon man embrace each other as father
[2:23:31] and son ship when the logos became his
[2:23:34] flesh and dwell among us I come from God
[2:23:38] and I go to God after his death the
[2:23:41] resurrection when the body was taken up
[2:23:44] and set on the writing of God he says
[2:23:46] now this logos that was in him Papa
[2:23:49] Jesus which was the Spirit of God the
[2:23:52] anointing through the sanctifying grace
[2:23:55] of the blood brought many sons of God to
[2:23:59] God which is anointed with the same
[2:24:02] logos so he so he's bringing the
[2:24:09] anointing the laws and we saying the
[2:24:12] logos is that living would logos would
[2:24:18] the anointed
[2:24:20] no wonder they are Pentecost it came
[2:24:22] down that till a fire broke apart like
[2:24:25] that tongues of fire set upon each one
[2:24:26] of them not their tongues but tongues of
[2:24:28] fire said upon each of them an elected
[2:24:30] selected group identified by this pillar
[2:24:33] of fire showing that God had separated
[2:24:36] himself into man do you get it now God
[2:24:38] the logos separated himself into men God
[2:24:42] not in one person he's in his church
[2:24:45] universal that's the reason Jesus said
[2:24:48] greater works than you do is more right
[2:24:50] now why God is speaking here to our
[2:24:53] hearts he's in Africa he's in Asia he's
[2:24:55] in Europe he
[2:24:56] in England we ever believe is like added
[2:24:57] together da is in the myths of them so
[2:25:02] no one could cut bottle of God and have
[2:25:05] the Angels are private by the angel of a
[2:25:08] private room actually to attorney
[2:25:11] general Vindhya so after the death bear
[2:25:16] another an ascension the common of the
[2:25:19] Holy Ghost
[2:25:19] Paul Saul was on the way to Damascus he
[2:25:23] was shot down by the pillar fire the
[2:25:25] logos now you see we can say we come
[2:25:28] from Bobby went back to God we and Wayne
[2:25:30] Matten pallava Allah Jesus could talk
[2:25:32] that talk come from God go back to God
[2:25:34] in that way what he was struck down by
[2:25:36] the pillar fire and the Jew could never
[2:25:39] call that telephone orde unless he knew
[2:25:42] it was the same logos that his people
[2:25:44] follow to the wilderness that was not
[2:25:47] the Son of man that was the logos no
[2:25:49] vices had reverence and love and
[2:25:50] respects Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:25:53] 10 for ever he said no no in this last
[2:25:56] day the logos that was upon Jesus has
[2:25:59] come back to the pillar of fire again
[2:26:02] and descending on the earth and this
[2:26:05] pillar of fire have been identified by
[2:26:08] the cameras and that's in like that you
[2:26:10] see how about the banner then watch the
[2:26:13] works of it it's come back the headship
[2:26:16] again he is coming to claim the body the
[2:26:19] head is coming to the body you get it
[2:26:20] it will be the Son of God the Son of Man
[2:26:23] the Son of David the I am Rosa Sharon
[2:26:26] the Lydia Valley the morning stops I am
[2:26:28] NOT II I am a servant the pillar fire is
[2:26:33] not II it is in spirit form which was
[2:26:37] upon the Son of man has come no to
[2:26:39] anoint sons of men to bring back a
[2:26:41] ministry just exactly he said he would
[2:26:45] have in order to connect the head and
[2:26:47] body together
[2:26:48] so this Lois this anointing this living
[2:26:52] would have to come back to bring back a
[2:26:54] ministry which is the ministry of Jesus
[2:26:57] Christ that has been prophesied to be
[2:27:00] here amongst the bride give the Lord a
[2:27:02] shout
[2:27:03] or Gloria Gloria Horning in on her glory
[2:27:07] that God you mean not your ministry no
[2:27:09] not my ministry the Ministry of Jesus
[2:27:11] Christ has to come back into the church
[2:27:15] like no talking ministry he said my
[2:27:18] father bear witness of me by my works or
[2:27:22] give the Lord a shout in her house or
[2:27:25] glory hallelujah hallelujah discovery
[2:27:29] rarities I have a critter which is that
[2:27:31] of John for the works which the father
[2:27:33] had given me to finish the same works
[2:27:35] that I do bear witness of me that the
[2:27:38] father have sent me
[2:27:40] I'm the father himself which sent me I
[2:27:42] bore witness of me you have neither
[2:27:44] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[2:27:45] sheep all you have his scriptures he was
[2:27:51] busting them all you have his scriptures
[2:27:53] all you have his written word
[2:27:55] you know nothing about logos would then
[2:27:58] never hear his voice they never saw a
[2:28:01] shape you never enter into that realm on
[2:28:03] a dimension of the supernatural or you
[2:28:06] have his letter but he went further he
[2:28:13] said you have not his word abiding in
[2:28:15] you
[2:28:15] for whom he sent you believe not in
[2:28:18] other words he said if you had the world
[2:28:20] in you you only received me the reason
[2:28:23] you carried me there was no word inside
[2:28:25] of you then he says description since
[2:28:32] what written is what you have for your
[2:28:35] tenure think of eternal life but they
[2:28:37] testify of me and you will not come to
[2:28:39] me that you might have life
[2:28:40] so he was showing them life is nothing
[2:28:42] what you read in there I am the life and
[2:28:45] you have to come to me to get the life I
[2:28:46] am the key to the life that you have to
[2:28:48] get Oh glory to go get the Lord a shout
[2:28:51] give them or some praises Here I am the
[2:28:54] way I am the truth I am the life all
[2:28:57] blowing up this life it was in the
[2:28:58] Baptist Church in Stockton a Methodist
[2:29:00] Church it's in the word
[2:29:10] so this pyramid constant caps he said it
[2:29:14] will only fit on the top foundation then
[2:29:16] the entire building us to become fitted
[2:29:19] to this stone which is the capstone and
[2:29:20] here we go are you ready Jesus cannot
[2:29:23] come until the church a body of
[2:29:28] believers and the ministry that he wants
[2:29:31] I will have to be the same as it was
[2:29:34] damned without asana be perfect
[2:29:36] what do you see all these message
[2:29:38] teaches people preach in brother Branham
[2:29:40] this isn't the message vindicated at all
[2:29:42] if you put that donkey here that have a
[2:29:44] recorder in it and he could speak the
[2:29:46] word that a donkey speaking it stealthy
[2:29:48] message because the message was
[2:29:50] vindicated but what you have to
[2:29:52] understand there's a prophecy that the
[2:29:54] same miss you have to come back in order
[2:29:57] to unite the head and body together
[2:29:58] watch they must have this ministry to
[2:30:02] raise up the Lutheran Wesley all three
[2:30:04] ages must have the ministry let's
[2:30:07] continue he has the plan of it are you
[2:30:09] ready yes the plan of it this will
[2:30:11] receive the first thing happen when and
[2:30:14] I'm not going to heaven is made first
[2:30:16] what happened I still is open non-fan in
[2:30:20] heaven seal open what happened I've seen
[2:30:23] the loop on what is that a mysteries
[2:30:24] unfolded and when the mission force our
[2:30:27] trumpet songs it declares war a break
[2:30:30] Falls a church is open that's the plan
[2:30:35] that's the plan I see no blood mystery
[2:30:38] unfold isn't that right a trumpet song
[2:30:42] declares war our plates for church is
[2:30:46] open
[2:30:46] what is the war part the Angel of the
[2:30:49] church catches the mystery of God not
[2:30:51] fully revealed then he calls he catches
[2:30:54] the mystery and when he goes for to the
[2:30:55] people the mission has given him in
[2:30:57] coffers to the people what does he do
[2:30:59] again he begins to proclaim a message
[2:31:01] what does that do is SATA war a
[2:31:04] spiritual war so the angels can see the
[2:31:07] mystery God
[2:31:08] selling out mysteries BAM still open
[2:31:10] mystery fallen angel catch the mystery
[2:31:12] the mission of a message in it
[2:31:14] messages are common such a pretty
[2:31:16] message these are a catchy message
[2:31:19] and I was that Oh hallelujah so the
[2:31:22] Catholic Church was how much opposing
[2:31:23] something years isn't that right to kill
[2:31:26] all the Christians 68 million Christians
[2:31:28] God couldn't find nobody else he went to
[2:31:31] beat up the church and see Martin Luther
[2:31:33] because Luther was a seed and he was in
[2:31:35] the Catholic Church God find a Catholic
[2:31:37] the bus the Catholics was fighting a
[2:31:40] Catholic you see I wasn't really a
[2:31:41] Catholic he was a son of God that was in
[2:31:44] the Catholic Church so what at the fight
[2:31:46] muta chop the mystery the channel advice
[2:31:49] it it unfolded the luta an e-blast the
[2:31:52] Catholic Church war started
[2:31:54] then bleach on Protestant but testing

[2:35:00] so no Minister have the authority to
[2:35:03] claim a revelation outside of what the
[2:35:05] Prophet wrote that is just plain nuts
[2:35:09] doesn't make any sense God makes no
[2:35:12] mistakes God casts any lighter to read

[2:35:42] book of life what it is is a revelation
[2:35:44] of what has been missed

[2:35:51] here it says here is to reveal what's
[2:35:54] already been written you seek what are
[2:35:56] things hidden in the written but we give
[2:36:00] the Lord a shout I will say the thing
[2:36:04] God has things hidden in the written but
[2:36:11] to reveal what is hidden takes a living
[2:36:13] voice so brother Branham came as the
[2:36:18] living voice to reveal what was hidden
[2:36:21] in the written he revealed what was
[2:36:24] written and what was hidden in the
[2:36:26] written

[2:41:10] unlistenable rhomboids the 7 or last one
[2:41:15] of these seals when they are opened is
[2:41:19] found in Revelation the tenth chapter
[2:41:23] since 1961
[2:41:25] but when I'm connected revelation 8 one
[2:41:29] with relish until you see silence but he
[2:41:35] always saw the connection he said is
[2:41:38] found in Revelation 10 chapter we are
[2:41:40] mighty in there with us Christ come down
[2:41:42] I put one foot up on the land and see
[2:41:44] and say that there is finished time
[2:41:45] around it's over time shall be no more
[2:41:47] who glory to God there were Thrones
[2:41:50] there was lightnings there were seven
[2:41:53] lamps or seven stars called seven
[2:41:55] spirits meaning seven manifestation of
[2:41:58] the Holy Spirit so now we change it now
[2:42:01] going on inside of it now not seven
[2:42:03] spirits seven manifestation of the same
[2:42:08] Holy Spirit of the seven churches at the
[2:42:11] seven seats of Mercy for the people so

[2:43:01] seven seats seven churches seven stars
[2:43:05] several manifestation seven spirits
[2:43:08] seven lamps or how bodies were perfect
[2:43:10] so that's after the first question we
[2:43:12] are what are those sevens merge them
[2:43:15] several messengers and there are seven
[2:43:18] men seven messages and we added no seven
[2:43:22] manifestation of the Holy Spirit at

[2:43:50] enough to know he was wounded for our
[2:43:52] transgressions he was bruised for our
[2:43:54] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:43:56] was upon him with a strike we were
[2:43:58] healed God cut him and bruised him and
[2:44:02] mashed him and cut him that he might
[2:44:06] reflect shoe is diamonds for dinners of
[2:44:10] sins joy peace longsuffering
[2:44:14] goodness meekness gentleness the seven
[2:44:17] spirits of God as seven fruits of the
[2:44:21] spirit that would reflect back to his
[2:44:23] people seven spirits seven men seven
[2:44:30] angels seven messages seven seats of
[2:44:33] mercy are no seven fruits of the spirit
[2:44:36] or chlorine of God are you with me
[2:44:39] oh yes you can't stop now we can't stop
[2:44:42] now hallelujah

[2:44:49] am I was talking about this he said I
[2:44:50] want you to take it and study it and
[2:44:51] compare it and act upon it don't just
[2:44:53] study it and compare but act upon it
[2:44:55] take it sincerely to yourself don't just
[2:44:58] listen to it and receive it and receive
[2:45:00] it as two different things there is
[2:45:02] seven qualifications to make the stature
[2:45:05] of God there are seventy changes that
[2:45:08] God has brought the church to
[2:45:09] disqualification do you hear it
[2:45:14] are you getting it here are seven
[2:45:16] qualifications to make the stature of
[2:45:19] God there were 70 changes that God has
[2:45:22] brought the church to this qualification
[2:45:23] and he had seven messengers to do it or
[2:45:28] give the Lord a shout every messenger
[2:45:31] how to bring a qualification let's act
[2:45:41] off it these things and we might
[2:45:43] commented a full statue of Christ being
[2:45:45] joined together but godly love fear of
[2:45:48] God reverence in our hearts to one
[2:45:50] another deep respect for one another
[2:45:52] brotherly and sisterly kindness never
[2:45:55] vulgarity nothing but purity of the Holy
[2:45:58] Ghost live in Live Together be a
[2:46:00] Christian walk would fit let the foot
[2:46:02] you of God flow to you let the knowledge
[2:46:05] of God when it comes to right and wrong
[2:46:06] when the devil presents something is the
[2:46:08] scripture walk away from it
[2:46:10] Oh glory to God hallelujah are we in the
[2:46:13] world are we in the spirit this morning
[2:46:15] I imagine them apostles never acted like
[2:46:18] us they won't probably men a few words
[2:46:21] they got in the pulpit they walked in
[2:46:24] they done what they were supposed to do
[2:46:26] and walked out they had power they had
[2:46:29] virtue they had no arguments with men
[2:46:31] they know where they stood that's all I
[2:46:34] said the other night one little nod
[2:46:36] that's all God had to do nothing gonna
[2:46:39] stop them they didn't question and study
[2:46:42] and Hama saw a worry like we do whether
[2:46:44] they should do this or that they went
[2:46:46] and had a do it anyhow one little nut
[2:46:48] from God they do it why why how could
[2:46:52] they know whether or not from God did
[2:46:55] all these virtues in there
[2:46:58] all those brethren the early church had
[2:47:03] them for choosing them
[2:47:04] so when God given and not just a little
[2:47:07] nut they could go and do it
[2:47:09] just one little nut one or not but
[2:47:13] unfortunately inside one not and you're
[2:47:15] going to do it
[2:47:16] Oh glory to God the first little nut of
[2:47:20] God compared with the rest of this with
[2:47:23] his word did no it was the Word of God
[2:47:24] and away they went didn't have to worry
[2:47:26] about nothing else
[2:47:27] when God spoke they went there you are
[2:47:30] seven to eight ages seven steps God
[2:47:35] building this church is like one person
[2:47:37] into an individual into himself so the
[2:47:40] seven churches was reflected of the
[2:47:42] individual all the virtues are hundred
[2:47:44] to seven ages quadrant at under in the
[2:47:47] individual chord
[2:47:49] villainess church court building

[2:48:56] even time a shabby light that's when
[2:48:58] Christ he Holy Spirit Jesus comes down
[2:49:03] sets himself at the head of the church
[2:49:06] then and he will resurrect this church
[2:49:09] being his own body or chlorine oh holy
[2:49:13] could miss it
[2:49:14] he can't leave you behind you are part
[2:49:17] of his body once he comes to connect
[2:49:19] with the body you have to go with him
[2:49:22] [Applause]
[2:49:24] [Music]
[2:49:29] there we go under way God is expecting
[2:49:33] us to grow as the weak God is expecting
[2:49:35] us as individual to grow is the way he
[2:49:37] brought his huge integral
[2:49:39] he brought his church up the same way he
[2:49:42] is bringing his people up so Peter say
[2:49:44] here first seven things faithful to see
[2:49:47] come up knowledge temperance patience
[2:49:49] godliness brotherly love
[2:49:50] I've brotherly kindness and then the
[2:49:52] holy the love of God the Holy Ghost and
[2:49:54] Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost
[2:49:58] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[2:50:04] the Holy Ghost and you've got all these
[2:50:07] vertices but you sealed in you then God
[2:50:11] lives in a tabernacle called the
[2:50:14] building the living tabernacle of the
[2:50:17] living God's plan in place and when a
[2:50:20] man possess these kind of things
[2:50:23] then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no
[2:50:27] matter you might speak with tongues
[2:50:28] you might impersonate any gift that God
[2:50:30] has cut you might do that
[2:50:32] but until these virtues they are going
[2:50:34] to you you are still off the real true
[2:50:37] foundation of faith but when these
[2:50:39] virtues grow in all glory not just going
[2:50:42] but growing is that the Uzo to you stop
[2:50:47] to reflect to you and the reflection is
[2:50:50] the perfection or give the Lord a
[2:50:53] shocking
