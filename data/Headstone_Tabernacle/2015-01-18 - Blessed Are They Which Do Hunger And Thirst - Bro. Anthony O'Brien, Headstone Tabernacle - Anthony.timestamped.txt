[46:09] owned and so forth but he was well off
[46:11] he had all his needs met but still
[46:13] something in his soul was not satisfied
[46:16] he wasn't satisfied with just coming to
[46:18] church he wasn't satisfied with having
[46:20] all that he had there was still
[46:22] something in his soul that he wanted
[46:24] that he wanted more than anything he was
[46:26] twisting for it he was hungering for it
[46:29] and nobody had the answer hallelujah and
[46:32] when he had received when god
[46:33] jesus finished talking to him isn't that

[46:43] and when he asked that question here
[46:45] come the love of god here come the holy
[46:47] spirit rushing down to meet his need
[46:50] hallelujah and now holy spirit went past
[46:52] his body spirit went past his flesh went
[46:55] past his mind hallelujah and saw that
[46:57] ache inside there hallelujah and saw
[46:59] that money spirit inside there it saw
[47:02] the thing that he was worshiping all the
[47:03] time he said go and sell all that you
[47:05] have hallelujah pick up your cross and
[47:07] follow me hallelujah but he couldn't do
[47:10] it he couldn't do it he couldn't come to

[48:02] so it's a blessed thing to be hungry and
[48:03] i'm thirsty
[48:05] isn't that right
[48:06] so many people walk in the earth
[48:08] amen look deep down on the inside
[48:11] there's a hunger there's a cyst to know
[48:13] the supernatural to know the world
[48:15] beyond this world
[48:16] what do you think happened they use
[48:17] science and sometimes the devil
[48:19] perverted isn't that right
[48:21] amen that natural things that god put
[48:23] inside of you amen and fill it with
[48:25] other things
[48:27] isn't that right
[48:29] isn't that right
[48:30] hallelujah so god predestinated on four
[48:33] ordained people isn't that right
[48:35] to hunger and thirst after righteousness
[48:37] in this day
[48:39] isn't that right in this evil age where
[48:41] there are so many shadows of evil where
[48:43] there are so many shadows of hatred and
[48:45] malice and jealousy and envy and strife
[48:48] in the midst of all that chaos isn't
[48:50] that right god have you walking in here
[48:52] hallelujah with a hunger and a thirst in
[48:54] your soul he knows where his seeds are
[48:57] this morning hallelujah he put that
[48:59] thirst in there in you before the
[49:01] foundation of the world that's why you
[49:03] press your way this morning that's why
[49:05] you pressed your way to come here this
[49:07] morning there was no flat tire was going
[49:08] to keep you back from service no fallen
[49:11] road brother amen brother williams
[49:13] praise god i was going to keep them from
[49:15] service they come and praise god why
[49:17] because there's a thirst inside your
[49:18] soul for more of god hallelujah
[49:21] isn't that right
[49:23] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:26] isn't that right
[49:27] hallelujah and the prophet identified he
[49:29] said that the word first
[49:31] is a painful desire
[49:34] isn't that right
[49:36] let me read it here he said then i was
[49:37] looking
[49:38] i was thinking about that word this
[49:40] said so i looked it up in a dictionary
[49:42] to see what it means and here's what it
[49:44] what webster says
[49:46] says it's a painful desire
[49:49] a painful
[49:50] he said it's when you want something so
[49:53] bad
[49:54] until it becomes painful to
[49:56] you oh hallelujah it's actually a
[49:59] mechanism
[50:00] that your body has in it
[50:02] to let you know that you need something
[50:05] to let you know that you want something
[50:08] is that right if you didn't have that
[50:10] mechanism in you you would die
[50:13] think about it
[50:14] if you didn't hunger if you didn't know
[50:16] what first was
[50:18] you would perish
[50:20] your body would wilt away
[50:22] slowly wilt away into bones hallelujah
[50:24] because you're not needing of anything
[50:26] you're not recognizing your need and so
[50:28] many people walking around not
[50:30] recognizing what they need
[50:33] not listening to that voice of hunger
[50:35] not listening to that painful cry of
[50:38] thirst
[50:39] that is burning in their soul
[50:44] isn't that right
[50:45] but it's satisfied with all kind of
[50:47] other things
[50:48] hallelujah and sometimes it just don't
[50:49] satisfy enough
[50:51] sometimes it'll only do only so much and
[50:53] no more hallelujah because god put that
[50:56] in there isn't that right
[50:58] isn't that right to hunger and thirst
[51:00] after a after him isn't that right
[51:03] hallelujah hallelujah so he talks about
[51:05] natural tests isn't that right he says
[51:07] um
[51:08] he says now it's not an unnatural thing
[51:10] to tease
[51:11] he said this is a natural thing
[51:14] it's just simply something
[51:16] that god has given us
[51:18] that we could have a desire for
[51:20] something
[51:21] sometimes god also has given you he said
[51:23] a control tower
[51:25] something that sets inside of you
[51:27] that controls these different desires
[51:30] and this this control tower
[51:32] is what sits in man's heart
[51:35] is something that god give him
[51:37] to warn him of the desires that's
[51:39] needful for him
[51:41] isn't that right
[51:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[51:45] and if your control tower this morning
[51:47] it's controlled by a human spur by
[51:49] emotions oh daniel want this you want
[51:51] that grabbing for things hallelujah
[51:54] listen after the world your thirst tells
[51:56] what's inside of you controlling you
[51:59] isn't that right
[52:00] and if you have the holy ghost inside of
[52:02] you as a control tower you would want
[52:05] these things here
[52:06] you would want virtue you would want
[52:09] knowledge you would want temperance
[52:11] hallelujah hallelujah why because the
[52:13] holy spirit could only recognize the
[52:15] word
[52:17] isn't that right
[52:18] same man somebody that's the thing that
[52:20] is pulsating in you
[52:22] hallelujah then you'll draw positive
[52:24] things into you isn't that right
[52:26] hallelujah that love will come out of
[52:27] you peace will come out of you joy will
[52:29] come out of you why hallelujah because
[52:31] there's something inside of you this
[52:32] thing for more of god
[52:34] and producing those things isn't that
[52:35] right
[52:36] amen wonderful praise god
[52:39] so we're building up here this morning
[52:40] amen amen we're building up here this
[52:42] morning amen isn't that right
[52:44] my so he said now there's two different
[52:46] kinds of this he said there's a this
[52:49] physically
[52:50] and there is a thirst also spiritually
[52:53] isn't that right
[52:54] physical tools that's that mechanism we
[52:56] were talking about amen
[52:58] that's what that's what it's in the
[52:59] human body naturally hallelujah and you
[53:01] need that in order to survive otherwise
[53:04] you wouldn't know what you want
[53:05] hallelujah you wouldn't know what your
[53:07] body is needing or desiring at that time
[53:09] hardly a pain pain is a mechanism
[53:13] pain is needful if you don't feel pain
[53:15] you wouldn't know that something is
[53:16] wrong with you
[53:17] it's a mechanism that god put in you to
[53:20] feel pain
[53:22] isn't that right to let you know that
[53:24] something is wrong it's an alert system
[53:26] isn't that right signals going up and
[53:28] down your body letting you know that
[53:30] something is wrong hallelujah and your
[53:32] soul is sending out signals this morning
[53:35] it needs something
[53:36] it wants something it wants to go back
[53:40] before there was a moon before there was
[53:42] a star it wants to go back there there's
[53:45] something in your soul that is bursting
[53:48] forth bursting forth crying out crying

[1:01:32] fire in his soul what he was looking for
[1:01:35] what he was longing for god satisfied
[1:01:38] that indeed
[1:01:39] and peter stood up and said men in
[1:01:42] prison hallelujah these people are not

[1:07:24] like he did the first man in the
[1:07:25] beginning
[1:07:26] isn't that right hallelujah isn't that
[1:07:29] right
[1:07:30] adam in the beginning
[1:07:31] had need of nothing
[1:07:33] he had everything that he wanted
[1:07:35] he had a full garden full of fruits and
[1:07:38] vegetables and
[1:07:39] things and animals and everyone looked
[1:07:41] up to him
[1:07:42] my he was the king of his domain
[1:07:45] isn't that right
[1:07:46] everything that he had need of there was
[1:07:47] no sickness there there was no disease
[1:07:49] there just think about it a world with
[1:07:51] everything perfectly running smoothly
[1:07:54] amen god's son was in charge and he was
[1:07:57] a father of it all and god went to a
[1:07:59] rest isn't that right on the seventh day
[1:08:01] he rested isn't that right because
[1:08:03] everything was according to his control
[1:08:05] how everything was according to to how
[1:08:08] he wanted it amen isn't that right
[1:08:10] everything running smoothly and satan
[1:08:12] didn't like that picture at all
[1:08:14] hallelujah he got mad hallelujah
[1:08:16] hallelujah only decided to corrupt the
[1:08:19] thing he decided to deform hallelujah is
[1:08:22] that right god's perfect picture he
[1:08:24] decided to pervert it he decided to
[1:08:26] corrupt it so he slipped in a little
[1:08:28] interpretation isn't that right
[1:08:30] we all know the story
[1:08:32] here's adam going out to till the soil
[1:08:34] regular day ordinary day and eve is out
[1:08:36] in the garden doing things and so on and
[1:08:38] here come the sip and talking to eve and
[1:08:40] say what did the lord speak to you and
[1:08:42] so on
[1:08:43] hallelujah because god's not talking to
[1:08:44] me so i guess he told you something
[1:08:47] so let me hear what god said so i can
[1:08:49] twist it
[1:08:50] isn't that right that's what he did see
[1:08:53] she told him she said uh you shall eat
[1:08:55] have any other tree but not the tree of
[1:08:56] god
[1:08:57] uh tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:08:59] he's and we should we should surely die
[1:09:01] he said no you shall not surely that
[1:09:03] holy right there he slipped in an
[1:09:05] interpretation maybe god wasn't right
[1:09:08] right here somewhere
[1:09:09] maybe it wasn't supposed to be this way
[1:09:11] what if god what if this what if that
[1:09:14] started asking little questions
[1:09:16] hallelujah hallelujah i started teasing
[1:09:18] out her intellect isn't that right honey
[1:09:21] on a human mind got to race in
[1:09:23] hallelujah until she forgot god's word
[1:09:25] entirely holy i was led down the wrong
[1:09:28] path
[1:09:29] oh hallelujah isn't that right an
[1:09:31] enticing spirit and in this season is
[1:09:33] how we have enticing spirits trying to
[1:09:36] tease at the bride trying to pick at you
[1:09:38] eve hallelujah trying to pick at your
[1:09:40] intellect maybe god wasn't right here
[1:09:42] somewhere maybe this didn't happen and
[1:09:44] maybe god does this and maybe this was
[1:09:46] that hallelujah trying to twist the word
[1:09:48] and spin ball it here try to spin it
[1:09:50] here or try to make some kind of praise
[1:09:52] god interpretation of god's word isn't
[1:09:54] that right hallelujah but you stay with
[1:09:56] the word holy and you shall not fall
[1:10:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:02] prophet said if a man stays with that
[1:10:04] word it's impossible to him to fall but
[1:10:06] what happened she didn't stay with the
[1:10:07] world she went with the devil's
[1:10:08] interpretation and lost the entire human
[1:10:11] race right there adam and the whole rest
[1:10:13] of it isn't that right
[1:10:15] an old man
[1:10:16] being in a comfort state of comfort
[1:10:19] state of luxury all that he wanted all
[1:10:21] that he needed they were so such in a
[1:10:23] blissful state they didn't even know
[1:10:25] that they were naked
[1:10:26] isn't that right such a presence such a
[1:10:28] love such a joy such a peace was
[1:10:31] surrounding them every day every hour
[1:10:33] every minute when they sleep live when
[1:10:35] they fell asleep it was there when they
[1:10:36] woke up in the morning it was there

[1:11:24] day out one day it was all gone
[1:11:28] one day it was just disappeared from him
[1:11:31] the soft bear that god had created for
[1:11:33] him called eden was pulled out from

[1:11:38] stones wilderness deserts scorpions man

[1:11:46] was no longer satisfied hallelujah is
[1:11:48] driven already god is not right
[1:11:50] hallelujah but god swore by himself that
[1:11:53] he would restore hallelujah man back to

[1:11:58] because he would not have man to be
[1:11:59] dwelling like that all the time

[1:15:51] powerful and the more he do is a is the

[1:15:57] satisfied
[1:15:58] hallelujah there's a first in his soul
[1:16:00] and he don't know what it is and satan
[1:16:02] saw his opportunity at the fall of man
[1:16:05] to perfect the things that wasn't man
[1:16:08] with all kind of grieving images isn't
[1:16:09] that right with idols hallelujah having

[1:16:34] gotten worse over the decades it's just
[1:16:36] gotten worse over the eons and centuries
[1:16:38] hallelujah but man always has a desire
[1:16:41] in his soul
[1:16:42] man is born of that desire he can't help
[1:16:45] it hallelujah he knows that there is
[1:16:47] something out there somewhere
[1:16:49] he knows that it's or something some of
[1:16:51] them can't put their finger on it but

[1:18:15] the days of israel and so many of them
[1:18:18] were not buried in the kings of the two
[1:18:20] in the tomb of the kings because they
[1:18:22] had fallen from the amen from from grace

[1:38:27] hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah look
[1:38:31] at the prodigal son
[1:38:36] look at the particle son
[1:38:39] he was
[1:38:41] living a good life
[1:38:42] in his father's house and everything was
[1:38:44] going good
[1:38:45] all of a sudden he craved power
[1:38:48] he wanted money he wanted to do what he
[1:38:49] wanted to do
[1:38:50] he said daddy give me what give me give
[1:38:52] me what i want give me what's coming to
[1:38:54] me i want my inheritance i don't want it
[1:38:55] now
[1:38:56] the father knew that he wasn't ready for
[1:38:58] it
[1:39:00] but he gave it to him anyway
[1:39:02] he got power without character
[1:39:05] give me give him a little short run
[1:39:08] say you go ahead
[1:39:09] i'll meet you in the
[1:39:10] morning hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:14] give him his inheritance and the son
[1:39:16] went out running
[1:39:17] and he started off real good
[1:39:19] he started off real well hallelujah he
[1:39:21] was investing his money and doing good
[1:39:23] things but all of a sudden he got into
[1:39:26] the good life he got into the fast lane
[1:39:29] began to see the bright lights
[1:39:31] oh hallelujah i began to get distracted
[1:39:34] oh isn't that right
[1:39:35] and slowly and slowly little by little
[1:39:38] it didn't happen right away
[1:39:39] but it started to break him down break
[1:39:41] him down he started to compromise here
[1:39:43] he started to break down a little bit
[1:39:45] there played something softly he started
[1:39:47] to wane away a bit his feet began to
[1:39:49] wander away
[1:39:51] he was accustomed to eating nice food
[1:39:53] and all of a sudden he went down to a
[1:39:54] kind of
[1:39:55] mediocre life
[1:39:57] and it slowly began to dwindle until he
[1:39:59] ended up in positive poverty he ended up
[1:40:01] in destitution
[1:40:03] he ended up in affliction he ended up in
[1:40:06] a place where he was not supposed to be
[1:40:08] at
[1:40:09] because that's not what he was
[1:40:10] accustomed to
[1:40:12] but slowly the run took a toll on him
[1:40:15] oh honey until he ended up eating pig
[1:40:18] food
[1:40:19] isn't that right got a job in one of
[1:40:21] those farmer places decided to start
[1:40:23] eating pig food because that was all he
[1:40:25] could get to eat
[1:40:27] and then all of a sudden
[1:40:29] i could imagine that prodigal son was
[1:40:31] sitting in that condition
[1:40:33] poverty stricken
[1:40:34] broken messed up
[1:40:37] tattered and torn
[1:40:38] all dirty and muddied up
[1:40:40] he started to look like a pig
[1:40:42] he started to smell like the pigs he
[1:40:45] began to eat what the pigs was eating
[1:40:47] or what a condition
[1:40:53] and he sat there
[1:40:55] and i could believe that he began to
[1:40:57] think about
[1:40:59] the life he used to have
[1:41:01] and the blessings that he used to have
[1:41:03] in
[1:41:05] in his father's house
[1:41:07] and i could imagine man
[1:41:09] oh hallelujah when we think about what
[1:41:12] adam had
[1:41:13] when you think about what glory is that
[1:41:15] lies beyond this riven veil
[1:41:19] oh what god wants to do hallelujah what
[1:41:20] god wants to restore us to friends
[1:41:23] oh hallelujah
[1:41:25] i believe that that son we're gonna sit
[1:41:26] there
[1:41:28] and we're gonna think about it he said
[1:41:29] wait a minute he said this don't make
[1:41:31] sense
[1:41:32] somehow the pig food doesn't satisfy me
[1:41:36] somehow what i'm eating what i'm
[1:41:37] partaking of right now it does not
[1:41:39] satisfy me
[1:41:42] i'm not accustomed to this this isn't
[1:41:43] the life
[1:41:44] that god wants for me
[1:41:47] that son got an epiphany he got a sudden
[1:41:49] moment of realization he rose up
[1:41:52] he said i will go to my father's house
[1:41:55] i'm gonna go back to the place
[1:41:57] where i was at the beginning
[1:41:59] i feel like starting all over again
[1:42:01] i don't mind being a servant i don't
[1:42:04] mind being a doormat but i'd rather be a
[1:42:06] doormat in the house of my god
[1:42:08] than a king in a tent of the wicked
[1:42:10] and that sun rose up one day you could
[1:42:13] begin to stand up right now
[1:42:15] on your feet that son rose up
[1:42:17] and that son went to walking
[1:42:19] that son walked past oh many hills many
[1:42:22] valleys
[1:42:24] but you know the great thing about this
[1:42:25] story
[1:42:26] is that the father never stopped looking
[1:42:29] the day that that son left
[1:42:32] he built a special chair
[1:42:34] and he sat out on the front porch i'm
[1:42:35] pretty sure every hour
[1:42:37] every day looking out for his son
[1:42:40] and all of a sudden
[1:42:42] all of a sudden what seemed like years
[1:42:45] only in a moment
[1:42:46] the sun broke the corner started walking
[1:42:48] up home he was all tattered he was torn
[1:42:51] he was broken he was in need but guess
[1:42:53] what he was still a son
[1:42:56] he was still the father son even though
[1:42:59] he had run out in here even though he
[1:43:01] had failed even though he had fallen
[1:43:03] short
[1:43:04] but there was a thirst in his soul he
[1:43:06] knew what he wanted
[1:43:07] he knew that the world can satisfy no
[1:43:09] more
[1:43:10] he wanted to go back to the place
[1:43:13] oh friend
[1:43:14] do you want to go back to the place this

[2:05:24] illusion we think we are in a reality

[2:05:52] that that alarm bell to tell us that
[2:05:54] something is wrong and something is not
[2:05:56] right on the inside father
