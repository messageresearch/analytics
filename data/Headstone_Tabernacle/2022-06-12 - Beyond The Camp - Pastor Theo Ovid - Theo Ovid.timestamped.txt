[34:19] chapter 13.
[34:21] we just have
[34:22] verse 10 to 14 just one scripture this
[34:24] morning hebrews 13
[34:26] reading from verse 10 to 14
[34:30] and reads
[34:31] we have an altar
[34:33] whereof they have no right to eat which
[34:36] serve the tabernacle
[34:38] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[34:40] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[34:42] the high priest for sin
[34:44] are burned
[34:46] without the camp
[34:48] wherefore
[34:49] jesus also
[34:51] that he might sanctify the people
[34:53] with his own blood
[34:55] suffered
[34:56] without the gate
[34:59] let us go forth therefore unto him
[35:03] without the camp
[35:05] bearing his repulse
[35:07] may god bless his word you may be seated
[35:11] and this last verse in verse 13 tell us
[35:14] where jesus is at
[35:16] let us go forth therefore unto him
[35:20] without the camp
[35:21] in other words beyond where the people
[35:23] are be when the others are he is outside
[35:26] be on the camp right now he is outside
[35:28] knocking trying to get in he's outside
[35:30] the camps
[35:32] religious camps
[35:33] and i'm a national camps
[35:35] amen
[35:36] our title this morning
[35:38] beyond the camp that's the title i have
[35:41] be on the camp
[35:42] i'd have an inspiration to go
[35:45] go in and go on
[35:47] leave my song strange
[35:49] but the goal is an intent
[35:51] if you intend to go beyond the camp
[35:54] either you go in
[35:55] you intend to go
[35:57] or you have gone
[35:59] but we are called to go
[36:02] beyond the camp
[36:03] all blessed be the name of the lord
[36:07] but abraham
[36:08] is heaven is perfect
[36:10] or how are you going to be when you're
[36:12] continually sinning when you are
[36:13] continually doing what's wrong
[36:16] now this will kind of put a kink in the
[36:18] legalistic
[36:19] but notice
[36:21] it isn't what you do
[36:23] it is what god has done amen it is not
[36:26] what you do
[36:27] it's what he has done
[36:29] you can't be perfect
[36:31] you can't be
[36:33] in yourself
[36:35] but in christ
[36:36] you are perfected
[36:38] you are not trusting in your own good
[36:40] works or your own church you belong to
[36:44] but you are trusting in the shed blood
[36:46] of the lord jesus
[36:48] there you are that is what makes you
[36:49] perfect
[36:50] that is what anchors your feet oh
[36:53] blessed be the name of the lord that is
[36:55] what makes you perfect
[36:57] that is what anchors your faith but
[36:58] around praying here he said okay
[37:00] heavenly father as we view back this
[37:03] morning with our minds back down there
[37:05] some hundreds of years ago
[37:07] where there's still jehoshaphat standing
[37:08] there by the side of kingihab
[37:11] a little spirit dung in his heart still
[37:13] left of god though he had made a mistake
[37:16] told him this is wrong this is wrong
[37:18] it's not clean it's not holy the prophet
[37:21] has said these things couldn't go on
[37:22] like this
[37:23] and a little fire woke him up
[37:26] and when then you had somebody to answer
[37:29] that little fire was mikaya
[37:32] a true prophet
[37:33] and though he might have come dressed in
[37:35] rags
[37:36] though he might have come up there
[37:38] despised all of them looking upon him as
[37:41] if a bunch of wolves looking at the lamb
[37:44] but he told the truth
[37:47] though he had been smitten in the face
[37:49] though he had to be thrown into prison
[37:52] and fed water and bread of sorrow yet
[37:55] the words that he said come to pass
[37:57] for you was with him
[37:59] god grant today as we look down in the
[38:02] bible we look at church books decalogues
[38:05] and so forth churches rituals and we
[38:07] shall see follow peace and holiness
[38:10] without which no man shall see the lord
[38:12] he that loves the world or changes the
[38:13] world the love of god is not in him in
[38:16] the last days perilous times shall come
[38:18] men shall be lovers of their own self
[38:20] proud boosters and great and those
[38:22] things happening heady high-minded
[38:24] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[38:26] god teaching people precepts of men
[38:29] instead of the commandments of god
[38:31] having a form of godliness and denying
[38:33] the power of the holy ghost to make a
[38:35] man filled with the spirit to make him
[38:37] rejoice make a man filled with the
[38:40] spirit to make a man rejoice oh glory to
[38:43] god hallelujah this bible said the joy
[38:45] of the lord is my strength and your
[38:47] question is are you happy you know you
[38:49] see christians today and you wonder is
[38:50] people happy
[38:52] they go to church but are you happy
[38:54] could you rejoice in the lord the bible
[38:56] said rejoice ever maury rejoice in the
[38:58] lord isn't that right rejoice i may make
[39:01] a man filled with the spirit to make
[39:03] tears flew down from his eyes to make
[39:05] him go back and pray for the sick to
[39:07] make him speak with tongues and
[39:08] interpret to make him prophesy the
[39:11] spirit of god the living god they just
[39:13] took it off of some lunch or something
[39:15] like that having a form of godliness but
[39:17] denying the power of oh god made this
[39:20] little audience on this day wake up
[39:22] quickly right now before the end time
[39:25] come and catch us in this condition may
[39:27] we renew ourselves as the bible said

[39:33] old way which is the good way and when
[39:36] you find it walk in it god grant that we
[39:39] can find the old rugged way where we
[39:42] could stand together again and join hand

[39:49] i'm going through god help us to live

[1:13:28] shriven pharisees twiddling the beards
[1:13:30] being respected by all

[1:13:34] that's what the people seeing
[1:13:35] and all of a sudden
[1:13:37] jesus
[1:13:38] trying to bring a picture to the people
[1:13:40] to expose another kingdom than this
[1:13:42] world

[1:13:44] there's a demonic kingdom
[1:13:47] behind the veil of sicknesses it have
[1:13:48] devils behind there and for the first
[1:13:51] time the world is seeing devils cast out
[1:13:53] sick being healed blind eye open
[1:13:55] before that david was playing harp
[1:13:58] to suit and get that spirit off a shawl

[1:14:19] demons
[1:14:20] so we have to transit
[1:14:22] we have to connect from this world to
[1:14:24] the next world
[1:14:25] we have to know that we just not flesh
[1:14:27] and blood
[1:14:28] or give the lord a shout win a spiritual
[1:14:31] war

[1:14:53] good people in a prison and he said that
[1:14:56] the dead god told him like the house of
[1:14:58] hell
[1:14:59] oh glory to god some churches have
[1:15:01] become hopes of hell
[1:15:03] imprisoning good people

[1:15:12] freed them good people
[1:15:14] oh give the lord i shout and he say hold
[1:15:17] the hell
[1:15:18] give way
[1:15:20] to the name of jesus christ and the past
[1:15:22] began to pop and the thing began to
[1:15:25] break and i am telling you there's
[1:15:27] coming of power i'm going to speak to
[1:15:29] the house of hell
[1:15:31] and the bar is going to pop

[1:21:48] he said when a man is born
[1:21:50] in the world
[1:21:51] he become a believer he become a
[1:21:53] nazarite when he separates himself from
[1:21:56] anything that's contrary to the word
[1:21:58] a total separation jesus said i come to
[1:22:00] separate a man from his wife
[1:22:02] tear up a family he that won't take up
[1:22:04] his cross and follow me he's not worthy
[1:22:06] of me
[1:22:06] a separation from everything
[1:22:09] anything from between a community from a
[1:22:12] belief from family anything would stand
[1:22:14] between you listen

[1:22:24] soul
[1:22:25] will not puncture every promise for this
[1:22:27] hour without amen there is something

[1:25:10] to tell them shhh
[1:25:14] but joseph gets so excited he's sharing
[1:25:16] his dreams
[1:25:18] and when they're interpreting their own
[1:25:19] mind they say we have to belong to you
[1:25:20] and this and that's not that they get
[1:25:21] fight you know what let me get rid of
[1:25:22] them
[1:25:23] that's a young brother

[1:25:41] sold by your brothers to slave hooters
[1:25:45] and your brother will help and the
[1:25:46] brother is taking you and cometh
[1:25:48] could you record a blessing in some
[1:25:50] animal intimating like that father can't
[1:25:52] stop griefing
[1:25:54] do they bowling
[1:25:55] he shoved pushed
[1:25:58] away from his family out to the family
[1:26:01] camp
[1:26:03] into a place strange place
[1:26:06] new language new culture
[1:26:08] but the vision still holds
[1:26:12] because the vision is from god
[1:26:16] john joseph blessing was not lowered
[1:26:19] everywhere he went he was blessed
[1:26:22] hallelujah as a ghana he was blessed he
[1:26:24] got blessed so much he got promoted but
[1:26:27] if our wife and trusted him jesus said
[1:26:28] no he end up in prison he's still
[1:26:29] blessed
[1:26:30] until the time god arranged for him
[1:26:33] for the descent for joseph
[1:26:35] i don't care what prison the devil put
[1:26:37] you in
[1:26:38] a prisoner's sickness a prisoner
[1:26:40] circumstance a prisoner condition
[1:26:42] whatever it is
[1:26:44] god could ascend for you
[1:26:46] at the appointed time
[1:26:48] to give you a reward to give you a
[1:26:50] blessing based upon the faith and the
[1:26:52] predestination mystery of his will in
[1:26:53] your life
[1:26:56] hallelujah brother brown
[1:26:58] he said more and more
[1:27:00] i am made to believe that people are not
[1:27:02] getting to christ
[1:27:05] he said
[1:27:05] as i look across the nation and watch
[1:27:07] people
[1:27:08] i am fully persuaded
[1:27:10] that the people are not getting to
[1:27:12] christ
[1:27:13] and i believe that it's the enemy that
[1:27:16] throw this hindus and the reason i
[1:27:18] believe this
[1:27:20] he christ is not the object that they
[1:27:22] have been pointed to
[1:27:25] they have been born into a dogma
[1:27:27] which is like a doctrine
[1:27:29] they have been pointed to a doctrine or
[1:27:32] a party
[1:27:33] or an experience or something like that
[1:27:36] it's having points of christ the word
[1:27:38] and that is why i think that people are
[1:27:41] resting their eternal destination upon
[1:27:43] some dogma some sensation dancing in the
[1:27:45] spirit i spoke in tongues do you know
[1:27:47] you could do all these things
[1:27:48] and being personalized by the devil
[1:27:50] there's just one thing he cannot
[1:27:51] impersonate that's the word
[1:27:53] that's why in jesus he said it's the
[1:27:55] word it's written
[1:27:57] i believe today that the reason that
[1:27:58] people are not coming to christ is
[1:28:00] because they are pointed to a
[1:28:01] denomination
[1:28:02] you come and join our church you read
[1:28:05] our catechism you believe our doctrine
[1:28:07] or some system they are pointed in the
[1:28:09] wrong way
[1:28:11] and their action and the life that they
[1:28:12] live without christ proves in their own
[1:28:14] life is vindicated that's every same
[1:28:16] thing
[1:28:17] he said i know there is some reason that
[1:28:19] people are not getting to the christ it
[1:28:20] would it would they wouldn't act like
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:23] jesus here we go scripture he read
[1:28:25] suffered without the gates
[1:28:27] that he might sanctify his people with
[1:28:29] his own blood
[1:28:31] that's why he suffered
[1:28:33] that's why he went to calvary
[1:28:35] he suffered around the calvary that his
[1:28:37] blood might be released
[1:28:39] to sanctify the church because he cannot
[1:28:42] come in our filthy church
[1:28:44] you shouldn't have to be sanctified by
[1:28:45] blood
[1:28:46] because under the blood is where we have
[1:28:47] fellowship if we say we have no sin we
[1:28:49] receive ourselves and the truth is not
[1:28:51] in us but we confess our sins he is
[1:28:53] faithful and just to forgive us all sins
[1:28:55] and to cleanse us
[1:28:57] from all unrighteousness and we can have
[1:28:59] fellowship one with another
[1:29:00] with the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:29:02] us
[1:29:03] so under the blood is where we get the
[1:29:05] cleansing
[1:29:06] not believing the same doctrine
[1:29:08] not believing the same teaching under
[1:29:10] the blood when you recognize your same
[1:29:12] blood for you for me you will behave
[1:29:13] yourself towards me
[1:29:17] your behaviors have towards your sister
[1:29:19] or your brother because the same blood
[1:29:20] for you is for them
[1:29:24] not blood for you and no blood for them
[1:29:25] it's blood for you and blood for them
[1:29:29] is one blood
[1:29:31] he has perfected forever them that are
[1:29:33] sanctified by one blood
[1:29:35] by one offering
[1:29:36] he paid the price that we could be
[1:29:38] delivered
[1:29:39] he paid the price that we could be set
[1:29:41] free it's the price he paid not us
[1:29:43] coming to church
[1:29:46] come on now
[1:29:47] it's not the pastor
[1:29:49] it's not the church it's not the
[1:29:50] cheating is the blood
[1:29:52] christ painted with blood
[1:29:55] his blood was plus seven times
[1:29:57] through the seven ages it produced seven
[1:30:00] messengers
[1:30:01] seven messengers
[1:30:03] oh glory to god seven messages seven
[1:30:06] colors hallelujah
[1:30:08] glory they've got seven spirits
[1:30:10] seven men
[1:30:12] calling the lack of every age
[1:30:14] oh give the lord some praises
[1:30:17] that's what the messenger was sent to do
[1:30:19] to call you out
[1:30:21] to go beyond the camp
[1:30:23] give the lord a shout
[1:30:26] you brian church you have been called
[1:30:28] out
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:34] but regens is in two parts
[1:30:37] coming out of

[1:30:40] it's not enough to come out

[1:31:33] in three days

[1:33:11] so jesus suffered without the gates
[1:33:13] and he may s people
[1:33:15] with his own blood
[1:33:17] sanification comes from a greek word
[1:33:18] compound which means clean cleaned and
[1:33:21] set aside for service
[1:33:22] and when god cleans his people with the
[1:33:24] blood of jesus
[1:33:25] he cleans them from the filth of the
[1:33:27] world
[1:33:28] and set them aside
[1:33:29] for service
[1:33:31] oh my
[1:33:33] oh glory to god
[1:33:35] hallelujah
[1:33:36] thank you jesus
[1:33:38] thank you jesus thank you jesus
[1:33:41] on that holy month
[1:33:42] when peter saw moses elijah and jesus
[1:33:45] and peter got so excited
[1:33:47] under that inspiration and vision he got
[1:33:50] enthused
[1:33:51] he said let us build three tabernacles
[1:33:53] one for dee one for moses elijah
[1:33:55] voice
[1:33:56] shut him up
[1:33:58] and say he him
[1:34:00] this is my beloved son he him in other
[1:34:02] words he saw jesus only
[1:34:05] why i want the one built tamina some man
[1:34:07] isn't that right but i'm talking about
[1:34:08] this
[1:34:09] he said watch
[1:34:11] he said when we go beyond the camp okay
[1:34:12] i skipped it hallelujah he said in the
[1:34:15] little camp they had their peace of
[1:34:16] james and john moses and last in their
[1:34:18] camp they could see heavenly hosts
[1:34:20] pillar of light hanging
[1:34:21] and watch and as they were ready to make
[1:34:23] a denomination one for the lord one for
[1:34:25] the prophets and so forth the voice said
[1:34:27] this is my beloved son
[1:34:30] then of what they were commissioned
[1:34:32] stay with the word
[1:34:34] that is god's camp for his people
[1:34:38] god camp is what the word
[1:34:40] stay with the word
[1:34:42] that is god camp
[1:34:44] oh my
[1:34:45] he said this i'll just keep that there
[1:34:46] now when we go beyond our own song
[1:34:49] barrier
[1:34:50] into the word of god
[1:34:52] it's unlimited
[1:34:54] what god can do with a man
[1:34:57] that is ready to go
[1:34:59] beyond the camp
[1:35:01] the camp of man that is
[1:35:03] hallelujah that applies to me
[1:35:05] that apply to all of us
[1:35:07] we have to go
[1:35:09] we have to be going
[1:35:10] and we have to have the testimony we
[1:35:12] have gone beyond the camp
[1:35:15] not just intention
[1:35:17] because somebody people know cars really
[1:35:18] that you wrote to calvary and they're
[1:35:19] watching this i pass in the street
[1:35:22] because this road is dead
[1:35:24] all the times you say you can't touch me
[1:35:26] now you can't take me now
[1:35:28] might always not yet come
[1:35:30] then just switch and say my always come
[1:35:33] he settled now this is the journey now
[1:35:35] all this he'll know he's sick and cast
[1:35:37] not devils wants to bring him to this
[1:35:39] spot
[1:35:40] because all of that all these messiah
[1:35:42] signs and so on was his his purpose was
[1:35:44] to die
[1:35:46] god
[1:35:48] in service to die
[1:35:50] so all the jesus ministry he spreads
[1:35:52] upon me to anoint me to preach and
[1:35:54] multiply bread and fish all of that is
[1:35:56] to bring him to the place to die
[1:35:59] because the price had repeated to get
[1:36:01] the book with the names in it
[1:36:03] and your name was in that book
[1:36:06] somebody had to get the book
[1:36:08] so the book was in the hands of the
[1:36:09] original owner
[1:36:11] and no man could be found worthy to take
[1:36:13] that book so when the lamb himself come
[1:36:15] and die and pay the price he had access
[1:36:17] rights to the book
[1:36:19] and when he got the book he gave it to
[1:36:20] the prophet
[1:36:21] and the prophet spoke all the words and
[1:36:23] that's what caught us
[1:36:26] do you see it now
[1:36:28] this book of names that was supposed to
[1:36:31] be in adam
[1:36:32] and adam fell
[1:36:33] before he could even speak a name of the
[1:36:35] book
[1:36:36] so it fell into sex she has come and
[1:36:38] said it must be born again from the book
[1:36:40] of the word and the spirit
[1:36:42] hallelujah not go back in your mother's
[1:36:43] womb but born of the word and spirit
[1:36:46] to bring it back to your own name
[1:36:48] so you have an original name in god
[1:36:50] so you are a gene taught in god in the
[1:36:52] book
[1:36:53] so why you were baptist methodist
[1:36:55] catholic you didn't hear your name yet
[1:36:57] but when this message is preached
[1:36:58] you know
[1:37:00] something connects you with that
[1:37:02] is that your mother connect you your
[1:37:03] father connect you is the gene inside of
[1:37:06] you
[1:37:07] glory did that connect you to this thing
[1:37:10] we could just have your name in it
[1:37:12] when that mighty angel version 10 came
[1:37:15] with the book open your name was there
[1:37:18] seven thunders throw their voices out
[1:37:22] that is for the bride
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:28] that's why only the bride could connect
[1:37:29] with them thunders
[1:37:31] just remember god docket they want to
[1:37:33] talk about it they want to preach it
[1:37:34] they want to say it bible you know
[1:37:36] they think this is a new york thing
[1:37:38] you said no new york thing this is the
[1:37:39] word
[1:37:40] seventh under the voices how about the
[1:37:43] right you see it put in the taste of the
[1:37:45] voice
[1:37:46] and then what john typed the bride right
[1:37:48] i heard a voice again said quote to the
[1:37:50] angel who he's talking to
[1:37:53] one man who he's talking to go to the
[1:37:54] angel and said give me the book so the
[1:37:57] same book that man couldn't look on the
[1:37:59] same book that john wept that same book
[1:38:01] when they came on the earth you imagine
[1:38:02] the brighter access to that book now
[1:38:04] that the book is open he said go to the
[1:38:06] inside give me the book
[1:38:08] give me that book give me that word he
[1:38:10] said take it and eat it take it don't
[1:38:13] look at it take it just read it eat it
[1:38:15] digest it let it soak in you let it go
[1:38:18] tongue in you let it be part of you come
[1:38:20] on give the lord a shout in the house
[1:38:22] don't leave it on the books and tapes
[1:38:24] take it and eat it digest it it'll be
[1:38:26] sweet in your mouth
[1:38:30] in the belly
[1:38:32] because you're going to die
[1:38:34] this world will kill you
[1:38:36] if you're taken and eaten it will kill
[1:38:37] you
[1:38:38] oh glory to god
[1:38:40] hallelujah
[1:38:42] praise god you talk about satan taking
[1:38:44] the people beyond the camp of reason
[1:38:46] beyond the camp of common sense satan
[1:38:49] taking his people the other way
[1:38:51] and god is taking people the other way
[1:38:52] satan taking people away from common
[1:38:54] decency
[1:38:55] people are persuaded to their dogmas
[1:38:57] increase without the camp
[1:38:58] in the camp of dogman creed they have
[1:39:00] they have a camp
[1:39:01] put them in the camp it is a camp of
[1:39:03] education theology works doctor's degree
[1:39:06] educational personality and god is again
[1:39:09] and that camp is against god's word camp
[1:39:11] god is a camp for his people
[1:39:14] oh my
[1:39:15] in the case of abraham you know
[1:39:17] in his camp it was almost like everyday
[1:39:20] occasion that abraham met god
[1:39:22] he said three thousand years ago a man
[1:39:24] could make god anywhere it was a common
[1:39:26] thing
[1:39:27] for a man to meet god why don't they
[1:39:29] meet him today they don't it's not
[1:39:31] common for man to meet god
[1:39:33] he's considered a crazy person but ibrah
[1:39:35] meet god almost every day
[1:39:37] not only that when he went on to jira
[1:39:39] decision we find out that god was in the
[1:39:41] camp of abimelech a philistine it was a
[1:39:43] common thing
[1:39:44] i hear this here they live in the camp
[1:39:47] of his presence
[1:39:50] camp of
[1:39:51] his presence today they live in their
[1:39:53] own camp they have nothing to do with
[1:39:55] god's camp they want nothing to do with
[1:39:56] it because it's fanatically to the world
[1:39:59] people will say we are fanatics
[1:40:02] somebody calls the exercising church we
[1:40:03] need to sit up and get up because
[1:40:06] they watch just sit down and seize on
[1:40:08] the church
[1:40:12] we preach in the kingdom of god not do
[1:40:13] you witness kingdom hall
[1:40:15] you say we getting these exercises get
[1:40:17] back up and sit back down and raise your
[1:40:18] hands and praise god and worship god do
[1:40:20] we hear they do because that expresses
[1:40:22] your faith in god
[1:40:24] it's not right and more importantly it
[1:40:26] creates the atmosphere
[1:40:28] that the spirit can reveal
[1:40:31] you know what i'm saying there's a
[1:40:32] resentful spirit among the people the
[1:40:34] the spirit car reveal
[1:40:37] i'm not talking about the word coming
[1:40:39] forth now i talk about the spirit taking
[1:40:41] the word and revealing it to you
[1:40:43] because even though the word is spoken
[1:40:44] by a minister you still need the spirit
[1:40:47] to reveal it
[1:40:49] moses had to get out of the camp he had
[1:40:50] been in living in
[1:40:52] one day god invited moses into his camp
[1:40:55] he said who are you he said i am that i
[1:40:56] am
[1:40:57] that i was or will be i am present tense
[1:41:00] what was it now god thought people
[1:41:02] thought he was crazy what had he done he
[1:41:04] got out of his own camp
[1:41:06] he educated him pharaoh educated him for
[1:41:08] 40 years in a school camp and he failed
[1:41:10] it taken god another 40 years to get out
[1:41:12] of him
[1:41:13] all of his education
[1:41:15] all of his theology
[1:41:16] that he had been taught take 40 years to
[1:41:18] get out of him
[1:41:20] then god could use him
[1:41:21] god has an awful time preparing his man
[1:41:24] a natural way of doing it into a
[1:41:26] supernatural way of doing it when he got
[1:41:28] into that camp god could use him
[1:41:31] oh my if you ever leave the camp of your
[1:41:33] own reason that's the place
[1:41:35] you would find god
[1:41:39] the camp
[1:41:41] of your own reason
[1:41:43] we reasonable a lot of things
[1:41:45] we try to figure out a lot of things we
[1:41:48] try to understand a lot of things why
[1:41:49] not trust god
[1:41:52] when you don't understand
[1:41:53] when you can't explain
[1:41:55] like the man who i think he um
[1:41:58] lost his wife or he was engaged
[1:42:00] and i believe that he want to sing
[1:42:02] precious lord
[1:42:03] take my hand they say don't say lord say
[1:42:06] precious lord take my hand lead me to i
[1:42:08] am tired i'm weak his wife died and he
[1:42:10] was in the fields singing songs and
[1:42:12] specials and right there he wrote that
[1:42:14] song precious lord take my hand
[1:42:16] it's under that pain in that anguish
[1:42:18] you get these songs that are breathing
[1:42:20] in their spirits in their hearts
[1:42:22] and they're still valid today
[1:42:24] they're still anointed and inspired
[1:42:26] today because these are god inspired
[1:42:28] things
[1:42:29] and you go through stuff that nobody
[1:42:31] could explain when you cry in nighttime
[1:42:34] when you can't explain to anybody god
[1:42:36] knows
[1:42:37] you're gonna wipe away your tears you're
[1:42:39] gonna handle you isn't that right they
[1:42:42] had to change campgrounds to see the
[1:42:44] supernatural oh blessed be the name of
[1:42:47] the lord
[1:42:48] remember
[1:42:49] have you hit the home stretch when they
[1:42:51] were called to egypt god provided my
[1:42:53] prophet sacrificial lamb they had they
[1:42:56] all they had need of a word a sign a
[1:42:58] miracle a prophet to lead them they
[1:43:00] wasn't satisfied
[1:43:02] they wanted something they could do
[1:43:04] grace provided that now they wanted
[1:43:06] something to do themselves so they could
[1:43:08] make an organization and fuss and fight
[1:43:11] and stew who was going to be the high
[1:43:13] priest who would do this who would do
[1:43:15] that one day god said moses separated
[1:43:17] from them
[1:43:19] and he just swallowed them up and
[1:43:20] against inaccurate notice all these
[1:43:22] signs and wonders vindicate his presence
[1:43:24] think about it now all these people are
[1:43:26] always supernatural and they still want
[1:43:28] something that they can do
[1:43:29] and there's some people just like that
[1:43:30] they want their hand in things
[1:43:32] hang into a business
[1:43:34] hand in this hand in that hand in that
[1:43:36] mind your own business stay out of
[1:43:38] people's business
[1:43:40] m.y.o.b
[1:43:44] you don't know what miob means it means
[1:43:46] mind your own
[1:43:48] business
[1:43:50] listen to this bomb
[1:43:55] man males have a camp
[1:43:57] a camp of creed and tradition
[1:44:00] nor not god's camp of his word
[1:44:02] a camp of their own
[1:44:05] he had to leave them
[1:44:07] for he is the word
[1:44:09] he cannot stay where people are taught
[1:44:12] out of this word
[1:44:16] god cannot stay in the camp he can't he
[1:44:19] never did he must stay exactly where his
[1:44:22] word is
[1:44:23] i told some minister breton and trinidad
[1:44:25] i said i didn't come in this message
[1:44:28] for any man to preach his own message
[1:44:31] and leave out the prophet
[1:44:33] and he said i come to hear earlier
[1:44:36] i come to hear what all you think and
[1:44:38] feel about the word
[1:44:40] i comment a message that goes in a
[1:44:41] prophet we need to hear all the thoughts
[1:44:43] and ideas i said no way

[1:44:46] wouldn't have it for the people that i
[1:44:47] preached to
[1:44:49] i wouldn't allow any man to come here
[1:44:51] and just preach their own thoughts last
[1:44:52] night you know while i was thinking
[1:44:54] about it i was thinking about putin so
[1:44:56] the message this morning in putin russia

[1:45:11] people's listenings and the airs and the
[1:45:13] air's doing so
[1:45:15] they're itching them to hear more
[1:45:17] because that's something fresh

[1:45:21] because i promise is that is it there is
[1:45:23] a preacher 120 years it will rain

[1:45:46] see we heard last week yeah write all
[1:45:48] three weeks
[1:45:49] hallelujah and daniel reigns had a fault
[1:45:50] thank you lord i need akka safety noah
[1:45:53] was correct
[1:45:55] hallelujah
[1:45:56] yes you're tired don't be tired don't be
[1:45:58] weary because i'm not tired and weary
[1:46:00] around since 1975 are still pumping
[1:46:03] oh glory to god because god promised
[1:46:05] certain things and i'm still looking for
[1:46:06] it after all these years i can't claim
[1:46:09] what i do have
[1:46:10] i can't lie to you i can't tell you
[1:46:13] something that's not true
[1:46:14] i have to wait till my change come
[1:46:16] oh help me jesus i will wait till my
[1:46:20] change come
[1:46:21] you must see when it come
[1:46:23] you're gonna feel it you're go sense it
[1:46:26] you're gonna experience it while
[1:46:28] pediatrics speak these words these words
[1:46:31] these words these words the holy ghost
[1:46:34] fell upon them that heard the word
[1:46:36] oh glory to god give the lord a shout
[1:46:39] hallelujah praise god
[1:46:41] what
[1:46:43] now we find out he dwell among them so
[1:46:44] watch they kick god out so then ghost
[1:46:47] had to just deal with the prophets right
[1:46:49] we find out he dwell among them his
[1:46:50] prophets he then become a stranger to
[1:46:52] them to the people so anytime they see
[1:46:55] prophet come and they trembling
[1:46:58] because they want to hear god
[1:46:59] them running their own show
[1:47:01] so that is why when is this samuel
[1:47:02] coming this is he are you calling
[1:47:04] peaceably
[1:47:07] what were they coming right now because
[1:47:08] when the prophets come they ain't coming
[1:47:10] for the knights thing you know because
[1:47:11] then people believe in terror so then
[1:47:13] prophet come here with us saying the
[1:47:14] lord so and so and they come in the
[1:47:16] kingdom you know so they set up the
[1:47:18] kings and had the parliamentary
[1:47:19] businesses and the prophet going
[1:47:20] straight to the course and what does say
[1:47:22] the law transformer
[1:47:23] rebuke them
[1:47:27] let's continue
[1:47:29] the bible said he watches over his word
[1:47:30] to confirm it he's trying to find
[1:47:31] someone
[1:47:32] it is bomb
[1:47:34] if he can just get a half-hearted man
[1:47:36] like samson
[1:47:38] yeah we call samson
[1:47:40] half-hearted
[1:47:42] it's a tough thing to even find that
[1:47:46] half-hearted sampling surrender the
[1:47:47] strength of god but give his heart to
[1:47:49] the likelihood
[1:47:52] that's the way that many of us do
[1:47:54] give something to god but not all
[1:47:56] god wants all of us
[1:48:00] isn't that right
[1:48:02] god had sent him
[1:48:04] they didn't people want to hear the
[1:48:05] message
[1:48:06] no they wouldn't hear him he prophesied
[1:48:08] he said the very god you claimed to say
[1:48:10] will destroy you and i say
[1:48:13] in the name of jesus christ the very god
[1:48:16] that this nation claims to be a
[1:48:18] religious nation the very god that they
[1:48:20] claim to save will destroy them in the
[1:48:21] iniquity he will destroy every
[1:48:23] denomination of the feast of the earth
[1:48:25] that they claim to serve notice he
[1:48:27] rebuked them and they put him out of the
[1:48:29] camp
[1:48:30] jesus suffered without the camp they put
[1:48:32] him out of the camp
[1:48:34] outside way beyond the camp put out the
[1:48:36] camp where the sacrifices are burned
[1:48:38] that is where he belong he was the
[1:48:41] sacrifice
[1:48:42] now
[1:48:43] brother sister do you know mission comma
[1:48:46] please
[1:48:47] do you know that each one of you
[1:48:50] all
[1:48:51] must sacrifice
[1:48:53] this part here people don't get
[1:48:56] the free sacrifice is only for the
[1:48:57] minister
[1:49:00] want a free pass
[1:49:01] they really want a priesthood where
[1:49:03] demands sprinkle some holy water in them
[1:49:05] tell them go
[1:49:07] go take care of them
[1:49:09] but you become the priest yourself
[1:49:12] you become part of this whole program
[1:49:14] he said now watch you must be god's
[1:49:16] sacrifice
[1:49:18] sacrifice the things of the world

[1:49:23] world
