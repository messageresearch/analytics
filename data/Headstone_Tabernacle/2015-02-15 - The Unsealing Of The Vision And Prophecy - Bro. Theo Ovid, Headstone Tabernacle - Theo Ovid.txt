something that I want to share with you this morning so we understand we want to go into the word uh habakkuk chapter 2 reading from verse one to three Revelation chapter 10 reading from verse 8 to 11 and Revelation chapter 22 reading from verse 7 to 12. want to welcome each and every one of you here this morning in the Blessed name of Jesus I want to also welcome all those who are connected live with us over the Internet want to say welcome Amen to this beautiful sunshiny day amen Sunshine here our place is cool but we have that shine and real shine is gold shining in your heart so let's read habakkuk chapter 2. I will stand up on my watch and set me upon the tower I will watch to see see what he will see unto me and and answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered and said right to vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie do it tarry wait for it because it will not it will surely come it will not Tarry reading from Revelation chapter 10. when I read from verse 8. and the voice which I heard from Heaven speaking to me again said go and take the little book which is open the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and eat it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me don't must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings Revelation chapter 22 reading from verse 7. behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sins of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them or when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophet son of them which keep the Saints of this book worship God he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he doesn't just let him be unjust still he was just filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let them be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according and his work shall be as bar heads almighty God we thank you for your word and I pray dear God as you take me out of the way speak to our hearts may your life be transformed by this word this morning may be upon us like a vision Lord an inspiration granted father in Jesus and we ask it amen and amen you may be seated thank you this morning I have a title the unsealing of division and prophecy the unsealing of the vision and prophecy I have a taught inspiration making division plain something we shared last Sunday I want to connect back to it God's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person and that's what you are in your behavior tells you what you are not what you say so much but not what you intend to be but what you are isn't that right so if God acted one time in a certain circumstance and that circumstance arise he has to act the same way because he's the same yesterday today and forever if God healed in a certain condition in time past he has to heal today because he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that oh blessed be the name of the Lord Praise this wonderful name Hallelujah so therefore from a prophet like Moses he said now first uh Apostles and Prophets teachers evangelists and pastors five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order Apostles prophets teachers pastors then the local Congregation of nine spiritual gifts but these offices and places is the offices you hear from the Apostle his ministry you hear from the prophet his ministry from the Evangelist from the teacher from the pastor each has a separate Ministry and their Ministries is of God and God has set them in the church for a purpose so the Ministries that God sets in the church is for a purpose now notice what I'm saying what God says not what man put himself in but what God says and what God says he says and he will vindicate what he says isn't that right now what was the Holy Ghost given for hear what is to give unction to the preacher it's to give Holiness to the group it's to set the church in order so in other words it's not man to set the church in order it's the Holy Spirit that's why the Holy Spirit was given to set the church in order give unction to the preacher give Holiness to the group it is to unite us together with power it is to unite us together with broadly love what's the Holy Ghost given Fork to unite us man can't unite us the Holy Ghost was given to unite us isn't that right and watch it's United together with broadly love I don't care if your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic in all in a rain outer rain no rain it doesn't matter you are united by broadly Love by the spirit of forgiveness I love you praise God you love me I forgive you you forgive me we forgive one another and the honey sticks glory to God we will always do something in the flesh to offend somebody upset somebody trap somebody whatever it is but because I could repent and say forgive me my brother you could repentance and forgive me my sister and whatever it is we can forgive one another and we can be free it's not right that is what the Holy Ghost was given for because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God there is none righteous no not one so you can't have anything to boast about you always have something that you could confess and repent about could we give the Lord some Praises this morning oh we in church this morning Hallelujah Glory so whatever you are we have all been by one Holy Spirit baptized into one body and become members of the body of Jesus Christ this glorious thing to become a member of the body of Jesus Christ once in that body nobody can pull you out you're in his body you are part of him oh glory to God he can't move without you oh Glory wherever he moved you're moving also you are in him you are part of him isn't that right could you get tangled off of that this morning oh are you ready for the word this morning now notice when Judas fell the apostles hand-picked by Jesus chose Matthias to replace Judas but the pillar of Fire choose Paul who was not even amongst their group one was man's chosen the other was God's chosen by Pillar of Fire and God has promised to take the church or return the church to her Homeland which is back to Pentecost the Holy Spirit was sent to take the people back to the word and the angel is on the earth to do just that to take the people back to the world because God could only vindicate the word the Angels manifestation which is the holy spirit coming into the church to the voice of the Archangel to make the prophetic Vision plain so parabhanam said it this way and warm against organized this organized religion he said the church rejected Christ the only church age we have Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in and this Angel's message messenger from God was echo in his message on the earth to come out of Babylon the Holy Spirit today here we go the manifestation of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit come in all kind of manifestation but he's speaking about a specific move the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word not back to church back to the word Millions going to church this Sunday morning but that's not what we are talking about we are talking about where you want to line up with the word oh Hallelujah cause the reason why the holy spirit will only vindicate the word it can't vindicate dogmas there is no life in them this is what we're standing for and that is what we believe but what did the word say Hallelujah because God going to confirm his word so if you have your his word in you he will confirm you because we give the Lord and Shout so he said the church the real believer he's back up a little bit he said no some great dealership might come to the city that maybe had a lot of Education could speak their words real good and plain and perhaps every Church in the city would fully cooperate it would be a kind of honor to God in here and a man which might be a marvelous speaker but that's not what the church is looking for the church is not looking for marvelous speakers he said the church the real believer here we go it's looking for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit something moving in their heart Oh Glory to God not your head your heart isn't that right back to the word back to the principles that was laid down in the alpha Church notice the purpose of God sending Malachi for our Elijah I turn this and he Prophet is to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers it's not just a modern thing will be in modern times no they had something that we had to go and connect back with he didn't say God send you Elijah to move you forward you can't move forward until you go backward and pick up what they had because they had the faith and you need the faith to connect with the power and then the power leads to the promise to manifest the promise or could we give the Lord some present people oh you know they see that no fear come by what here in the word therefore the word are they be preached and the word preached correctly rightly divided will bring Faith to the people and the faith and the people will pull down what the power of the Living God that's why he could drop the promise you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you Glory so God sent the purpose of Elijah or send Eternal Hearts back to the face of the fathers the Fate the resurrection fate the original faith it will take faith based on forgiveness to receive the power that is Promised faith is to lead us to power power is to take us to the promise to manifest the promise first Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord himself descends of heaven with a shout but the voice of the Archangel are with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we wish alive remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air Jesus does all three the shout The Voice the Trump Jesus did the shout in true and by the prophet of Malachi 4 bringing the bread the word the message Hallelujah Jesus already did that Hallelujah Elias is already come and a message went out throughout the whole Earth to kept the seeds predestinated seeds a Dragnet was thrown out a big fish in that was thrown out and income the elect along with crabs snakes worms Turtles and whatever else but a Miss Holiness there is an elect and the elect will not be deceived oh get the lost some presence people over here so this this shout message was sent out to get three kind of Believers True Believers amen make Believers on unbelievers all got caught up in the net isn't that right now here we go Jesus did they shout in the prophet are you ready Jesus is now doing the voice in the brain first to identify a five-fold Ministry divinely appointed to rightly divide the word this can only be done by the voice of the archangel this voice not the angel but the voice of the angel that voice will speak the word and remember the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing Oh Glory from Hebrews he said leaving let's go into Perfection oh my I wish I had the voice of an archangel now to bring this to a place where you could see it say in other words the voice of the Archangel is to bring Clarity of the vision the Kim even the prophetic vision and that's why habakkuk says right Division and make it plain so the voice of the Archangel is to bring it to a place where you could see what you have promised and no demon could rob you or cheat you out of what you are going after I'll bring it on further if a earthquake trips hit Trinidad and this church falls flat you supposed to have a vision in your soul as to what you going after if this place is divide up into 50 pieces and we cannot have church like we know Church on your little piece of Island you supposed to have a vision if you don't have that you may as well prepare your tribulation backpack how to survive this tribulation for three and a half years yeah they get a book on a manual called that yeah they get a backpack because this is what we're talking about this is real gospel this is going back to the days of the Apostles yeah they were hiding in the upper room there was no open just waving their hands no they were hiding for fear after what was going on around they were hiding from the authorities waiting on their promise yes they were in Tribulation time they were under pressure but they was on the promise under pressure and on the promise under pressure and on the promise under stress on disappear but on the promise all the same it is wonderful to be under a promise of God how many in here know that they are under a promise of God I am not talking about your failures and your shortcomings and your wickedness and your attitude I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a promise of God you didn't ask for the promise he gave the promise the last days it shall come to pass I will pour out my spirit and down that's right the vision is from an appointed time otherwise don't get worried don't get fed up don't get frustrated don't act yeah yeah don't act miserable don't like that God is not in charge and God is under control he gave a promise be satisfied but the promise of God and worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and if you take the book my God prays if you take the book and you eat the book you're gonna prophesy from the book Glory the book the book will Empower you to prophesy some of you are eating a book I know because there's no bitterness in the belly the eating of the book have a result the Eastern of the book has an effect you don't eat the book and say it's a nice it's honey in the mouth it's honey to talk about it it's only to speak it it's only to share it it's only the fellowship about it but when it go down in the belly when it go down to the path it cutsy part when you have to stand and said no gossiping when you have to silence he cut off the phone with that foolishness when you have to stand and face those ministers to their face come on now your friends when you have to take a stand with your family with your loved ones with your husband with your wife with your children with your neighbor with a pastor with the Elder with a deacon with so-called Bishop with boobs and potentials and would be Apostles when you have to take a stand with all of them it's Peter in the belly but if John who typed the bride he took the book he eat the pork and it was sweet in the mount it was beat in the belly and the voice said don't must prophesy I can understood the prophecy is the testimony of Jesus so when you prophesy under the spirit of Prophecy it's the voice of the Archangel anoint him to produce the testimony of Jesus let them laugh but the testimony of Jesus is prophesying that the world will be fulfilled in your life oh can the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory praise God Hallelujah blessed be the Lord Jesus told the disciples he didn't receive it you receives me and he that receives me receive him that sent me and the prophet said in spoken word you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants that send on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you sin always God going to have to raise up men that will have to correctly divide the word not by intellectual study and so forth but by Divine what's that word divine Divine means there is not uh facts about it there is no emails about it there is no discussion about it Divine is just that Divine divinely revealed inspired from heaven how many know they are Sons and Daughters of God how many know you have a father and if you want to talk to you he can talk to you he wants to talk to you to her to a pastor Bishop praise for him to tell the priest something to tell you he reveals the whomsoever he will that that is enough to make a Baptist Shout divinely reveal so the promise of the voice of the Archangel is here in the form of the spirit of Prophecy to prophesy from the open book things happen before Dynamics is poured out two main things Luke 24 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself in other words Jesus unlocked the word or opened the word or brought a purple anointing to reveal the word to his elect this was a private opening it wasn't on the mountain it wasn't with the five thousand with eating bread eaten five thousand it wasn't with the seven thousand bread looking people it was Private Resurrection Faith Resurrection Ministry the opening of the word put these elected people that was about to be half a promise because the vision had to be made plain to them as to what really unfolded from Genesis come on out so the Bible said begin with Moses begin to break the scriptures to them on Luke 24 45 then open he they understanding that they might understand the scriptures World open understanding open Watch the sense God trying to show you something and you're blind first he opened your eyes then he could say see oh Hallelujah before the fish could swim after I've seen to swim in so before God could bring to reveal to you you have to have the ability to receive our divine revelation and the bride the elect has the ability here we go to hear from God oh I want a bigger shout on that one I wanna make a shout on that one I wanna make a shout on that one you don't have to wait for your husband you'll have to wait for your wife or the minister the elect has the ability to hear from God and once more the world will hear direct from God because the voice gonna be in a bride oh blessed be the Lord Hallelujah Genesis 18 17. you may be seated and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the things which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a mighty and great nation and all the nation of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him and he will command his children and his household after him that they keep the weight of the Lord and to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abram that which was spoken to him what is this about Abraham of the Earth Abraham father of faith Abraham Son of God heir of the Earth father of faith Son of God every Earth father of faith a Son of God and God can hold back from his son he was about to unveil the six seal of judgment over Sodom Sodom was finished and didn't know it Saturn was judged about to be sentenced and God began to break the seals into Abraham and Abraham's in judgment but Abraham's family there so he wanted to see the seven seal gonna drop down with names in it to call his family and he's been to beg God if there is 50. he begins to beg God if there is 25 will you destroy this wicked place if there is 50 all righteous he said no not for 50. then what about 40. then what about 30 then what about 25 they couldn't find it judgment hanging over the Earth judgment oh my hanging over the world and here you sit call from under the seventh seal and someone you want to be stingy with your praise and some of you want to be easy with your voice and and when John saw his name John said all under the heaven all all above the earth when you when you understand mom right now state by state America is legislating Sodom and Gomorrah judges say it is okay they will have to summon God and ask God to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah if he's not going to judge them but if the God we serve is the same yesterday today and forever there's a missile heading for America Oh Glory the godfire Judgment brother saw it he called it the vision before the coming of the Lord when he saw America bummed up all over you sit in church and you think we are only talking words but we are prophesying again because it will surely come to pass foreign walking down Los Angeles Billy where are you standing outside of me was plenty of missio any store whatever JCPenney and he said Billy you won't be an old man until you see sharks swimming where you are standing he wanted him to know right where you are standing you would live to see sharks swim in that place it always the Judgment already set for Los Angeles an adoption is set deliverances set your breakthrough is set your healing is set your Revival is set don't sit and watch at me that's why get you desperate rich rich you're supposed to see the love of God because you are one in a million right now the fighting Isis they're fighting this on that problem and that problem and everybody tense and Russia and Ukraine and whatnot and by the way I was to get it the plague has returned 44 people died I think it's Madagascar or Philippines somewhere back there the plague that killed millions in the 14th century has come back Terry the Black Plague yeah it has retailed fleas coming off a rats and infecting people and they said the fleas are not resistant to spray so these are mutant fleas and what did the prophet said we are striving to enter the kingdom of God before these horrible plates strike now Ebola is still around SARS is still a rule HIV is still a wrong cancer is still a wrong and the police coming one by one because I saw an angel full of the last plagues but the fire said come here I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife the angel having the plagues it is judgment about the strike the Earth him that is filthy gonna be filthy still or him that is righteous gonna be righteous Tale the Judgment going to strike the Earth we didn't come here to be entertained you come here to hear the word of the Lord you come into here don't say the Lord that is what you come here for foreign Hallelujah glory to God Glory I feel the Holy Spirit here right now the holy spirit is upon the word you sisters have to find your spirit in the word woman they have none and Bulls come in all forms Long Horn short horn obvious bull quiet bull symbol all kinds but the spirit is not right because God I'm a spirit for a woman and a spiritual man that's why he's separated in the beginning that's why all this homosexual foolishness is so against scripture and word and God God said man this way woman this way for a purpose Jesus will not marry no Bullhead bride foreign the Lord Jesus Sweet Lord Jesus our lord Jesus handsome Lord Jesus none like him Lord Jesus he is not going to marry he will not say I do he say I don't and I won't Oh Glory to God's name and somebody do you take no I am not gonna take that I wait too long for this his wife happy his advice herself ready in all words you may be seated divine revelation being made plain to you would give you the ability to make yourself ready the church member you had to work him up scream up wake him up and courage him up hold them up shake his hand up but the bride know who she is she knows she is loved she knows he has chosen come on over I'm feeling religious now she know she is elected and the elected will be the perfected come on now come on now the elected will be the perfected something inside of you you know it go bring me a excuse you know I was going to be bright but then you know I feel the cough and fight back on I become non-brite no no no that that's what we're talking about we're talking about your desire to be like Jesus in in every situation sometimes we're talking to a wife and she want to talk about your husband talking to husband he wants her body wife because he wants somebody to blame is because of she I am behaving so it's because I he but no you have to begin to deal with you what about me when you look in the mirror are you lining up with what God requires of you you see it appears is the gray matter it makes you feel at peace when you meet you want to drink and you see other people drinking too when you drink your Luffy convicted because you have the boys with you seeing it All of Me that's why misery looks for company don't like to be alone no I misery look for assistance help support Fellowship control talk misery talking come come commit me I just Fellowship my misery talking to you know be careful about the invitations don't go and fellowship by misery because misery drop the misery on you and then you come on miserable and your husband don't know what happened your wife don't know what happened your Cheroke or you're all in a miserable atmosphere it's not the atmosphere of the word it's best to go and pray quietly somewhere it's better than praise tell them before you accept that I want to pray a little bit I want to ask the Lord if I should go this way or go that way praise God because you want your footsteps to be ordered of the Lord this is too late to just go anywhere you got to know how you're being led because as many as are led by the spirit and if there ever was an hour to be led by your spirit is this hour because the devil is a liar he's a deceiver he's deceitful he wants to rob you of your joy rub you of your blessing rub you of your inheritance he's abandoned thank you and the police looking for him Devil is a bandit wanted Hallelujah looking for him oh Hallelujah but if I'm saying you'll see the Philistines go to backing up when some adopted Sons listen the devil no listen the devil know what he can't he faced before you know he face Christ oh Hallelujah without knowing fully who Christ is because Christ then said you know who I am I'm Jesus I am that look my card Jesus give the devil I call God Jesus didn't do that he never tell him who he was he just it is written it is written it is written because the word is unveiled to me it's revealed to him so he knows every one of the devil's tricks that is the only way they could really overcome to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks his main trick in this age is to get you off the word Hallelujah foreign but it's to keep you in church and take you off the word tell you you could hate somebody and say well Hallelujah Glory hello you of the word you're messing up your own house and you're playing nice and church Hallelujah you're off the word you have to die you have to humble yourself you know what Homer has to defer you have to give in you have to subject yourself you have to be submissive to Christ I can't say I wish I was a teacher you know my fine teacher have an easy boy you can just teach your word and he you don't have to have a burden for for nothing just teach the Mysteries and teach dogs earlier I was telling somebody that's the secret that's why I don't have no cell people lined up in front of my office trying to see me another answers are answered by the word another help by doing the preaching and so on you're getting Minister too so there's no need to line up on my office but over there I want to see you see you for what they really had to want to see me yeah because I'm trying to deal with this stuff your stuff your spirit pick up your stuff whatever your stuff they're going through there are people getting invited to our service here and then they get back afterwards they say they supposed to invite them telepaths about them I personally know who they are but the spirit pick up their stuff and when the Holy Spirit deal with their stuff they get messed up they don't like it too much but I can't help that there's something moving here that angel angels drop down because you see it's not about me it's about you that's where a lot of these ministers get tied up they think is about them and their Ministry like it's a power building but bodybuilding contest or something so and they try to display their Ministry and stuff God are not interested in that foolishness couldn't pay that flesh business one God one is some dead men because listen the faithful Ministry is for your perfection not for The Minister's glorification I am the bishop is that right of what you may be seated so the fight for Ministry the preachers they are your they are supposed to be servants to bring the weights out to bring the train ah and serve you one you're supposed to take up the clock Oh my Jesus sent me that glass and and somebody will get a plate on you got the food seven course menu this morning freshly baked Hallelujah the pie is still the salad is there the race is there the meat is there and you have a choice of turkey or chicken come on I put the one better than that oh give the Lord some Praises people and when that menu is presented you have food for your soul somebody eat them eating sweet eating fast something you're looking for another plate God loved the whole thing my people shall eat and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord dead God my people shall never be ashamed Glory Glory Hallelujah my God and if you know where you are I don't have fallen if you know where you are you have green if you know where you are and have food all food and Juice season you have a reason to shout you are not reason to dance you have a reason to scream from Paradox but a mom says we are promise Accord duration 10. Malachi 4. that we have to come to Ephesians to this where these Sevenfold Mission the word of God must be unfolded must be unfolded let's talk about seven Thunders the back of the book Central mission of the word of God has to be unfolded and I believe just as Joshua before the Ephesians raise up John the Baptist razor before the next Ephesians we are promised are not refuses again he said no in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it say it again I'm going to say it again we are given an understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because they will come an efficient age to it in other words the word will make clear and plain conditions watch after Jesus open the understanding openly with what happened after that they went in the upper room and they were praising them blessing God continually nobody got to love hey you can't go there again you know they can't hear that their minds are sealed they're wound is sealed by the word that was revealed to them no other interpretation could come to them they were locked into a Channel of the promise of Dynamics he said behold I send the promise of my father my father my father send a promise to you tarry in the city of Jerusalem until until until stay in the word until stay still in your forehead until sealed by the word until all right listen listen they were frightened that didn't change the promise they were scared Mary was nervous they were trembling they couldn't get the normal drink they were normal get and eat the doors were locked they were not going out like that but they were waiting because God said so I will return unto thee according to the time of life at the set time at the appointed time they knew the Act was to wait and the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully calm I like that word fully come not just come fully come they were in one mind they were in one Accord and all of a sudden first there was a song oh there's a noise when God come and they have to happen no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah some kind of noise can't have this quiet sit down and he says yeah no it's half of a noise noise noise I shout a rambling a roar a panda voices a song from a heavy Muffler of a car outside no no no no no no no no no yeah but that was nice talking about this song Come From Heaven Hallelujah there's no man ain't making that noise a Heavenly noise and pillow fire pillow fight is at the cut up itself cut up itself just divide itself everybody get the portion man you ain't watching how much portion you get how much portion you get I get infected your portion no no everybody you only have time with your portion you your liquor fire your liquor that's what you come to church for you come for your who am I preaching to this morning you see you see you sit there wondering if I'm gonna get it I'm not worthy I I I'm not even sure I belong here and you're struggling the backside you did this that God not talking about he's talking about his promise he's talking about what he gonna give you oh Hallelujah he's talking about his love to you if God had to talk about that talk he don't talk long time but then Noah from Grace somebody must find Grace in the eyes of the lord your holler is his blood that's why we're here this morning you know why I'm preaching this way is this Blood I don't know special something it's just blood blood dripping all over me when God look at me don't see my sins and failures and shortcomings blood I am all bloodied up this morning what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again oh precious is the flow that makes me fight the snow no other Fountain no nothing but the blood of Jesus and once there is blood there is presence Glory Glory Glory that's what Abel brought Abraham brought a lamb everybody bought blood came but the flowers of his own understanding and interpretation but everyone bought a blood offering a blood sacrifice confirming that something must die for us to live and we have to be grateful to God oh hallelujah praise God Amen Let me see that remember for mauritian Book of symbols as Daniel through the seven Thunders and utter their voices remember Daniel grabbed the pen started the right and John heard the same thing watch but on the backs of the Bible the Revelation was shown to Daniel they said that there are seven voices to be uttered that no man can open no man know what it was but the Bible said and told Daniel told John in these last days these seven voices will be made known by the real true church you get it you can see where the false and counterfeit is trying to keep great men from places like that so therefore to you the elect what's about to comfort you are going to understand it it will not fly over the heads of God elect the thing of it is this God was so mysterious that the people couldn't understand him or comprehend he was just too mysterious by the Jerome and he wanted to reveal himself so it pushed God to the point where he became one of us to be touched to be handled and John beautifully said it this way in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us so God made it so plain not even fool should hurt therein no you cannot separate in the church the nature from the spiritual because they were ordained to be together there's nothing right in the church bad good Renegade rebellious but the elected is the foreknown of God chosen from the foundation of the world and here we go are you ready and Vindicated by the process that he God in his wisdom takes them through I want to hear a beginning on that one be elected is the foreknown of God and they are Vindicated by the process that God in his wisdom takes them through by their place of trying Wilderness testing trials whatever else to prove to these sons and daughters that they are not like Eve as a baby somebody take a camera clicks pillow looks good but that pillow fight over that baby is a sign that that is elected predestinated for ordained gift to the Earth now let's talk process you see people like the lights they like the picture they like poles and with Angel and knights and Rain monsters always fine but let's talk about process you see this is the point a young man want to drive a car you see people driving I want to drive two but there's a process you have to get a license you have to be tested on the road if you don't get that you are illegally driving your father's car people want to get big jobs but they don't want to get the big results and the papers of the exams but to go and get this big job you have to get some big qualifications to get the big qualification you gotta get some big studies and you have to pass these big exams then you can get this big job it is called the process there's also something called the process of character development because of course of course please don't let you talk about that God want to bless you God I'm gonna bless you oh yeah I too blessed to be stressed oh yeah what kind of catchphrases and stuff I'm gonna have to do with that you know like them inventing in their own mind God say Abraham you are blessed Abraham said oh I bless I have no children go see a plain rude come outside let me show you these Stars start the count I run out of numbers he said so shall your seat be now go back and worship God you know holy promise and you don't tell them how long they will live for and Abraham didn't know his 25 years and you've ever said hear this beauty he's staggered not the promise of God unbelieved but what's wrong come on now Sean said Give In Praise let me hear you give a shout yeah brother oven are you seeing that the stronger I get in faith is the more I will get in Praise of course of course because the day God gave you a promise every day is closer to it the problem the problem is when you don't have a promise that is pressure Hallelujah that is pressure when you don't have a promise when he promised delivering in favor of time Moses coming 400 years of people in bondage and their money passing generalization from deliver coming deliver coming somebody's in a tired yet you have to hit again it's prophecy liver is coming Spirit of Prophecy Moses is coming somebody coming you're saying that since they're small you're a long beard you all know you're still coming well a hundred years past you just gotta wait 300 more yeah and after 150 250 150 more but what about when it's 375. 280. 295 five more years 291 299 nine months Baby Moses born nine months and delivered not mature yet not ready to speak no flies yet be able deliver in baby form deliver in seed form God loved the seating you know when he went to whip up the enemy he just threw a seed devil walking the devil can't see the devil can't touch that's why when he broke the seven sea silence silence but only for half an hour because God won't be silent for too long the silence have to be broken and when the seed is exceeded silent it's all locked up waiting for rain but if I could only get brain to see this dry but he promised lots of rain it shall come to pass I'll pour out pour out pour out pour out all right I'm the devil's job is to make sure he put the umbrella over your seat don't let that rain touch don't let that water touch that you know because anytime that water hit your seed you're gonna have a breakup you're gonna have to cry you're gonna start the ball you're gonna start to groan all this around we will break out we can't be the same when the water of his Mercy water of his Blessing though water of his spirit blame you but let me press it a little bit when you praise and worship you are actually watering the seed so the devil's job is to kill your praise why you think sin is so important to the devil not just for it to sin you know you may be seated let me just say this here the devil know you are sons and daughters God deny that right but he could make you lose your joy of salvation and he could cut you off from your access right because if you get your messed up it come like you lose your channel to approach your God so his job is to trick you trap you mess you up when you come you're heavy why am I people heavy heavy leading burdenedong say praise God your hand how to do so like if y'all exercise come on now you can make it you can you can make it up you can make it happen yeah sure how long it could still because you could make it that's not what God wants that's what kind of Stingy praise when Jesus come on that donkey you know when kings come in that fail out and whatnot Kings Kings Kings with the crown and all the village and the whole city come out when Jesus come on a donkey that was their King the Bible said the king come lonely he had no clung on him but that was the king and and they begin to chewable branches that you roll the carpet you will always have to roll they did not Catholic they had branches and they dropped the branches in Jesus king moving slowly on that donkey the king coming lonely according to scriptures Hallelujah what what a sight to behold when King Herod come in a king big trumpet song in Bing all kind of confettis falling and all kinds of showing up but this King different King different King now he's the king of kings the Lord of lords not a white stallion all pumped up and so on a donkey on Sat no no person inside Jesus told me this is a special one no man sat on that one before this is King thing this is Kingdom King and where are we going well you're on a church went before where this pride is going oh Hallelujah we shall reign on the air I see the sense of empowerment when truth comes to you you could feel truth you could connect with truth you can't even explain anything and they follow Jesus and I mean they couldn't understand everything he's saying but he he doesn't know alone has the words of eternal life your words touch me your word redeem me your word reach me your word does something to me they knew it was God the word is God and that was God made flesh and prayer Among Us the word itself oh Hallelujah so God vindicates you by the process he takes the truth God did not say because William Branham you are my son pilafia hang over your baby your crib therefore you're going to raise up a prophet all Beware with you I will bless you multiply you the world will be smooth before you you'll have to say the Lord son nobody will stand before you all the days of your life in Jesus name amen well that sounds good but let's check the process and let's check the reality he lost his wife he lost his daughter that's part of the process he lost the anointing he didn't listen to God and obey God and God discipline him twenty percent saying Amen on that they had it with discipline but you know that is what the word disciple come from I thought you want to be a disciple a disciple is a disciplined one one that is following in order you want to be a disciple huh you have to become disciplined and God luckily God thankfully have no spoiled children we spoil our children we spoil our wives we spoil this one and that one but God will have you have none of it he should not know her he said not Moses he said no Joshua come on now he's straight down David and he will straighten you out demon I can tell you Ice Cream Pan it said sauce boy yeah amen man Jacob was doing fine ripping off this one ripping off that one he was feeling good with more flocks than ever more busy than ever I just say that remember brother he said man when he is good something to go to China and have services and so on you see so many Chinese come and get baptized and they get baptized and they baptize looking for business if they have business in the U.S so they get baptized today and says a while and if they recognize that they're working out they're gone the future is an opportunity to get more business looking for business people come with different objectives and motives God help me and my family in Jesus name amen no that's fine you could pray that and God have mercy upon you because God not in that kind of Private Business God in his Divine will Divine Purpose and you have to be interested in his kingdom in his plans that you can be part of it and feel part of it so when God went to find you he could find you God can't say oh God there's no way they can find out this what is trouble and he he's plenty trouble so I'm not calling him at all this one here I could call he would listen so the spirit could drop on that one look I better man I'm going to take a plane and the Holy Spirit tell him walk and he's walking he's walking he don't know when he's walking Keep On Walking turn left turn right you're

the microphone and stuff you know it's a gift behind it there's some who they're better in poetry but they make a good effort but they tried their very best but there are people like inspired and sowing in whatever there's an inspiration that connects to your life and that anointing there's a fate that nobody could change and replace and that's why Jesus ah his faith was based upon who he was and not the anointing upon him and that's perfect faith when you come one with the inside when one with God one with the word when there's no conflict within you and your words are true and genuine you're not in hypocrisy you're not saying one thing with the lips and thinking one another God bless you and your mind saying I hate you if I could have let you have it and let you have it but God

Jesus help me Praise Jesus help me glorify Jesus oh he is plenty of all our praise oh my oh my oh my God so we have to answer that question why would God choose a bride in his evil age this is a really evil age so instead a woman plead guilty for killing six children six babies it's an evil age the kind of condition it's horrible why would I want to be in the tribulation period getting a tribulation backpack could you imagine miss any rapture I'm trying to figure out how you're going to survive three and a half years you can't buy or sell except you take the mark of the Beast and you know if you take the mark of the beach that's it oh Hallelujah all dwell on the earth worshiping oh Hallelujah everything is set you know the bombs already said listen when they invented slingshot they use it bow and arrow they use it one bullet gun stuff it boom they use it one bullet at a time cannon fire boom they use it every weapon man made he has used it man you should see the kind of weapons that Russia have and missile and bomb could destroy so much and they only building more and improving now they have one that ever gliff off it's selling six dummies and one is in real one so you try to shoot it down you don't know which one you're shooting them that is okay and children Rich very smart very intelligent we can't fight up with King Gerald you can study how to make an underground bunker to protect you from these guys out there it makes no sense I'm not looking for underground I'm looking to go in the rapture and I know it will take Rapture and faith I know it will take the life of Jesus so till you have to die I'm not hearing you we have to die no excuse this has to live and if God put your wife like Moses on to be hot tempered that you could get tempers I hope that the other confirmation but but I'm talking about it as I'm talking about whatever God put in order to hone your life for for to get his character and his nature because is he correct another gift that's why giving the children money doesn't help them it will just spend giving them to help them help them it's not helping them they have to go through that's why I had to get on the human because you're feeling sorry for them that is not God's Syrian that's not God's compassion God's compassion is doing the will of God sometimes they have to pain sometimes they have to strain you crack the egg of the chicken you will kill it you could smother your children with the wrong kind of a love hug them so tight they lose their breath and they die right in your arms because they love them so much that is not love that's foolishness actually because our example is not our appearance our example is God the Bible says love your wife as Christ love the church not as your father of your mother okay father know like trouble so not using that as the example use any word as the example as Christ loved the church show odd men to love their wives so what you have no excuse well I come to this and I come to that look at the Bible look at the word that's how we coming back to the word as Christ loved the church and give himself for it so miss that you have to step up take responsibility oh my Lord Hallelujah where because we came from toward the flesh and Bypass or theophany we are here to reconnect to our theophany by way of the word do you believe that the Sedum the thought that we are in God could not be expressed because a word is not expressed and therefore by the word the forming of the word image this word back to the word the unveiling of God the word the revealing of the Solomon was revealing the word the land of promises these promises are the world the word is coming to you by way of the third pull which is the opening of the world the word truly have to open to you that you as an individual bride member could see your promises and your inheritance you've got to see it you have to go beyond salvation it's not good just to be saved you must want your inheritance because that is what Jesus died for Adam lost the book Jesus died to pay the price to get back to book Revelation 10 the book came on the earth version 10 8 the voice said take the book and eat it before there is a further manifestation there got to be the spirit of Prophecy and the prophecy must be upon you How Could You prophesy over your own life and act negative or could you probably say over your wife and don't have the expectation for the Fulfillment in her life Jesus when the report came man said Lord my daughter is sick somebody come and say forget about it do ask him again she's dead he said I go with her Hallelujah she wasn't awoke right away but Jesus said I go to wake up yeah he comes walking the coward is around him he said get him out get him out get him out just just bring a few elected believing people around me he's a little girl rise up and walk give her something to eat and Jesus walked out that was normal to him he has a dull little girl and also a drama he did no need for that he was the word rise up and walk that's how you're going to become so stop pretending stop acting you're angry you're angry be angry and sin nut let me take it I'm going to fight there's a different business you're angry you could let God cool The Temper down hunger down hastiness whatever it is that is where you get things to pray about that's why God is still not to hit some time of Trials because we're not broken enough yeah yeah we're content satisfied you see and you think things working kind of cool you're not all way away I want to be but it's so cool that you yourself get cool you're walking in a cocoon of coolness and God said the People Too Cool Hallelujah then God try to come and you're in your big balloon and welcome a nice pin and all the air come out your balloon and they said oh from that time from that day from this happen man this happened that happened you start to hit the deck from that but God wants you to be like a man then he bursts the Cocoon him I said the Lord give it all take it away blessed be in the Lord then God can leave everything do you hear that you hear my son talking now my son talking just like me he even know all things work together for good hallelujah hallelujah why I think Joseph had such power to forgive his brothers he was delivered he was free he was a right hand man isn't that right he was the man handling all fear of business in Egypt so he had no fights but his Brethren he said Brothers come close to me it is me your brother whom your soul Hallelujah but everything is all right Brothers everything is fine we grew up now we mature now you understand division now division was for appointed time you have to understand the vision is what put me where I am you didn't have that Vision but God gave me that Vision it was for a purpose to accomplish his will Oh Glory to God no Brethren come and eat come and take in plenty come and camp and feed and chose his band when others by the empty only chosen foreign people

can you take a little more Daniel 8 15 and it came to pass that I even Daniel and sought for the meaning and behold there stood before me the appearance of a man and I heard a man's voice between the banks of ulai which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he came near Where I Stood or when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand osunaman for at the time of the end shall be division Daniel 9 20 and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel I'm presented my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I've seen in the vision at the beginning being caused the flight swiftly touched me about the time of the even oblation and he informed me and talk with me and said oh Daniel I am now come fought to give these skill and understanding at the beginning of his application the Commandment came forth and I come to show thee for our greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression to make of end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness and this is the part I want to get up here and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy no but Abraham and the sixthful purpose of Gabriel he was highlighting that path to seal up the vision and prophecy because the vision and prophecy was sealed but we are promised that that Vision will be unsealed isn't that right because God told us the book is sealed till the time of the end Daniel 12 Michael shall stand up the great Prince notice watch and many of them that sleep in the dust of people shall awake some everlasting life some the Everlasting shame and contempt and those that turn away turn to many to righteousness of the Stars forever but Daniel showed the words seal the book even to the time of the end what is it do you see it class here we go this revelation of Jesus Christ and of his power here we go all his coming of the end time was sealed up until this time that is what he come to do it's hit from the scholars seal it up until the time of the end close up the words what did he do to seal up the vision and prophecy Daniel had prophesied these things he saw it in a vision and the angel came down to seal the vision and to seal the prophecy that they can read it but cannot understand it until the end time or could we hear again what is the end time the end of the sentient week when the prince the Antichrist will be revealed making himself God oh Hallelujah so in other words this on ceiling the time is now but when the seventh seed broke something was hidden under there you know what was under there you won the deer you were sealed under there you were hidden under there so therefore unsealing the vision and prophecy also mean unsealing you Oh Glory the God to bring you out into a manifestation oh Hallelujah as many as received him to them give you power to become the sons of God so we're not coming back our sons saved Sons salvation no our sonship is Romans 8 the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God this is how Adam was before the fall that means the book has to come back on the Earth and the book came back God gave it to the prophet Mighty Angel seven Thunders after their voices oh Hallelujah Oh My Oh Glory the God Amen if this is the tooth pull then there's a great ministry lying ahead first little birds then bigger Birds than Angels oh blessed be the name of the Lord remember Satan will try to impersonate he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do we notice

announcements uh our first announcement has to deal with uh tomorrow please God tomorrow is as we know it's kind of a Monday and the vision of the youth ministry was to do something to really get the young people engaged and about two weeks ago we spoke with them and we said our mandate our responsibility the goal and purpose of tomorrow was to achieve two things one to bring the young people closer to Christ and closer to each other and we have endeavored to put a program together a multi-faceted program to really try to facilitate this so we are soliciting your support and we like to encourage all of the young people to be there tomorrow we have certain activities planned um some of it would be team based but we are not setting permanent teams so don't worry about being in a permanent team or wearing a specific color the objective is not to have competition is to have Fellowship so for different activities we just split up in groups and be very flexible with it because at the end of the day we want everyone to be drawn closer to Christ and closer to each other we also would like to request for those of you who can afford a contribution of twenty dollars towards the food I will be preparing um there's a bit of a cookout but like I said it's not a competition um but there would be two different menus being prepared mostly by the young people with some support from the calebs um for the young people to be able to have a wonderful lunch um beyond that we want to make it very clear that the invitation is open to everyone in church as well our Target was really to get the young people engaged but everyone is also invited if you would like to come up to the Tabernacle tomorrow and have Fellowship one with another you can feel free to work with some snacks um there should be some extra fooders as well but you could work with some snacks and just have a grand time in the Lord tomorrow please God so the focus is really on the young people but the entire church you're welcome to come we we want to be here from 9 00 a.m tomorrow morning and to try to take advantage of the day and have people back heading to home at a reasonable hour as well so I trust that that came across pretty clear I don't think I forgot anything with respect to that but focus on the young people um 20 contribution from the young people for those of you who can make that towards the groceries I've bought to for the cookout and the whole church is invited um very important as well right after this service brother Uber would like to meet with all of the deacons ushers the technical team the parking attendance and the musicians right after the service so the deacons ushers the technical team the musicians and the parking attendants mordova would like to meet with you after this service and um next week's service is going to be very important remove it has some stuff he wants to share with respect to our upcoming convention July 3rd 4th and 5th and if it's the first time you're hearing it we are under great expectation for a seven Thunder Revival that's the reason we are here but the random said the bride has not had a Revival yet it will take the seven Thunders to wake her up so we are prophesying we are declaring we are speaking for a seven Thunder Revival and we have no excuse but to have a Revival here brother Branham said what we see should put our souls into action to make a church that will make a Revival so brother open ones the church to know that after service next week he wants to address the church with respect to the convention and certain things that we want to put in place so we'd like everyone to make every effort to be here over the course of this week I receive emails already we already have people in France who already have their plane tickets to arrive here we have already about 12 people coming in from France about nine from Ghana some Believers from Nigeria and we haven't even sent out the official invitations as yet so we are under greater excitement and anticipation for what God is going to do in our mids going to church say Amen so we expect everyone to be willing to put their shoulder to the wheel because it cannot be a one-man effort or a small group effort but everyone has their part to play in the kingdom of God you know a lot of people say they love the Lord and when you ask them what are you willing to do for the kingdom that's that's a different thing so we want to give everyone the opportunity to be a part of this great initiative so just to recap the announcements tomorrow we are under great expectation to see all the young people and all of the key Labs who can be here for around 9 A.M we'll be here for the entire day try to make it out after service but open wants me to know the deacons ushers technical team musicians and the parking attendance next week after service but I'll be the one to speak to the church about the convention and service continues on Thursday all right may the Lord richly bless you and uh Lord I want to be your Christians oh Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart for love lost in my eyes I always in my eyes oh Lord I really want to be a Christian in my eyes oh in my heart I want to be a Christian amen foreign
