tape to play for you from Ivory Coast my first message in Ivory Coast he'll have no while but let me get this you in as usual street 1906 when that colored man Simo half blind I guess he wasn't good looking man I don't know half blind so rather chew off for some people one time half nine man talking about God promises and the gifts and you know what they did they got in the spirit of the gifts coming they said what promise it it belongs to us they had not pulled better know step up they always fret down and then inside to pray and believe and expect and all of a sudden the holy was breaking on them sigh in the camp and then it's such a spread like wildfire and people couldn't understand it little run the mother tongue and God's Will was in the run as they run them mafia catch here fire here fire here they say we don't want you here and they don't understand it God was alone and the fire to spread by running them Holy Ghost anointed people one time them sisters was so anointed some

about Holy Ghost and power Levi but holy was on fire man who never know the play piano sit down in front piano the piano normal holy ghost hands moving Holy Ghost pound spoken Holy Ghost hands leaned upon the shake and that was a Pentecostal revival 1906 what about these dynamics what about the power the person of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost itself upon the people upon a pray what about that you may be seasoned yeah what want you tired of you us Philip enough yeah you're tired enough for yourself when you get fed up here do something the other bridge last week your faith is expressed by your works when you get tired enough and you start to have faith in God then you're gonna see words towards that God NER before eternity I wanna read a scripture for Matthew 17 you'd have to find it I just read it from 14 to 21 oh when they were come to the multitude they came to him at a sitting man kneeling down to him saying lord have mercy on my son for he's a lunatic so vexed for off times he falls into the fire and often to the water and I brought him to the disciples and they could not kill him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him is it to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from Nigeria then came the disciples the Jesus the father said why could we not cast him out I like that they say how this thing I working on what we're going on here Jesus earned them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have feet as a grain of mustard seed you shall see under this mountain remove hence the Younger place it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out but by fasting and praying so jesus used to fast and pray what are you doing he had works with his feet because he had demons to challenge but a man said sometimes angry Mazda Castle use a common terrorism afterwards Oh hallelujah it's spiritual warfare fear friends amen praise God umberto Burnham spoke on a message hybrid religion he's talking about hybrid feet but corn hybrid a mule is hybrid and chicken is hybrid and whatnot but Genesis said let every seed bring forth after its kind so God wanted things to remain original and when God created his church he created a Pentecostal church that was your original church our Pentecostal church filled with the Holy Ghost and men and woman were led by the Spirit of God man couldn't leave it alone he wanted a hybrid Church said I bring theology and doctrine and might just return your church and we got buildings and scholarships and it went further from God but that wasn't God's plan in the beginning he never sent one of them to seminary he sent an upper room to wait there until the Holy Ghost came upon them to be ordained ministers of the Lord but I Britian bring bringing in overseers and bishops and when the Holy Spirit is called original leader of the church so the Holy Ghost is most who supposed to have the preeminence is isn't that right thank you Lord Jesus so the life so the hybrid cord cannot reproduce itself the life isn't right in high Britain and God wants it the way he's made in the beginning so the church has been hybrid now we come to a place where the church is more like a lodge done a Pentecostal blessing my my my my praise be to Jesus it can't cross itself back but when a green was first planted the second please you hybrid it the first thing you know it never come back an ox a nice collar any church that leave it's from original foundation has never been able to come back again when Lootera revival scriptable he organized the hybrid gone Wesley same thing I breathe in you know Eve was the mother of I Breeden so that is why the blood is important that is why Jesus died he died to introduce his blood to correct the high Breeden did you get that we end up being hybrid born in sin though stand a chance but Jesus blood come to correct that to bring us from unbelief into fate [Applause] [Music] so the highway so therefore when somebody take what the Bible says and what man say it makes a hybrid feet I went to do that it makes a beautiful church but no life in it uh-huh so you never got much in life then yes it has to come back to the life so God said no good stay away from it it is evil it brings don'ts maybe I'll go and get heal maybe the Lord will heal me that's hybrid feet it's no good that's church feet we want God's feet God feet is God says something that stay with it my strike I'm here stay with it Jesus said if you are faint like a mustard seed why did he say that because you cannot mix anything and mustard seed you can't I breathe it it's original or glory to God God you promised me a breakthrough I'm expecting it this morning I can't wait for tomorrow this morning is my morning of ritual that's that's that that's your personal faith God said sure Oh chlorine ago but this happened last night than the last that was last night today's today yesterday was yesterday but today is the day that they give me a fresh opportunity to give me a fresh that Oh glory to God so God said the church as a whole you make me sick up my stomach I want to give it a Holy Ghost your interbred about the world I let the things of the world creep in I'll spew the whole generation out of my mouth but funeral flock the one that keeps in the commandment of God is your father's good will to give you the kingdom you see where I get him no wonder God can send the Reviver is that cut nothing to build on because people build an induction on the ideas and it warts but he won't update something on the world listen to his mom damn he will take individuals and bill it on demin invidual and declare them before the

only to the chemistry of the blood Jesus Christ can breed back a person that's one theory from what God said Eve showed weakness the church should what she did she said well maybe you're right maybe God would wholly responsible who knows what difference does it make as long as I'm baptized what if it doesn't make it snow that shows you need another Breeden that shows that something's got to come
