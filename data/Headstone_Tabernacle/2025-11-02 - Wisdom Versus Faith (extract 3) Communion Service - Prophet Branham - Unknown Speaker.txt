That's the kind of father we have this [music] evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So, Amen. This evening we have a a message from Brother Bam entitled wisdom versus faith. Amen. So, you [music] enjoy the word this evening. Amen. Brother, you may have your seat. Praise God. No bless &gt;&gt; that word in that church, that group of believers has CREATED THAT ATMOSPHERE. NOW, HOW IS THE WORD IN ITS SIMPLICITY BUT yet in its completeness ever going to grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that and says it can't be so? &gt;&gt; See, it can't. &gt;&gt; SO, WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS PREACHED FROM A SEMINARY, the children die. Where faith IS PREACHED FROM THE WORD, the children live. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the difference. Just life and death. The same thing happened in the Garden of Eden. That's exactly what happened to them two atmospheres there. When Eve got off the right one, on the wrong one, she died. It'll do it every time. So, they cannot stay. If your church has got that kind of atmosphere, old child, if you want to live, &gt;&gt; you believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, here's going to be a little stinger now. And I don't mean it in no harsh way. I just This is teaching. You have to when you hit these places, you have to sting and burn a little. You see, I just like branding a calf. I used to hate to do that to brand a calf. Poor little fella when you run out there and I don't know whether you have a calf roped or not. And and and and time hog time. See across and a poor little guy. You run down there and take his hot Brandon arm socket on him. Oh brother, it looked horrible. When he got up, he really had a running spell. He just run and kick and holler and beller and go on. But I tell you, they know from then on who he belonged to. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They know what what pastor he belonged on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no joke about it then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's brand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's brand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And they said, you know, many of you read or sang the cowboys meditation, you see. And the stray yearling when they get him in on the last at the roundup, the stray yearling, they just make soup out of him because he ain't no brand on him at all. So the rest of them goes on to their own pastors. But the boss of the roundup, Moses cattle. So if you brand hurts. Now look, Satan could scientifically prove by his wisdom. Now, I'm going to play the part of a doctor here for a few minutes. Satan could scientifically prove by his wisdom that the soil that he was going to give for the human race to grow in had vitamins. Sure did. He could scientifically prove it. They can scientifically prove anything they want to almost. See? Sure. &gt;&gt; It had uh vitamin P, pleasure, popularity. &gt;&gt; That's in it. That's in his wisdom, sorrow. Sure. Sure. All the worldly pleasure, all the picture shows, all the dances, all I think. Go ahead, that's all right. It won't hurt nothing. Sure. Popularity. Well, biggest church is in the city. All right. It had vitamin C in it, which he referred to as common sense. Makes reason. See, it had vitamin R in it, which meant reasonings. Yeah, he could reason, but you see that won't work. It had vitamin B be in it which means beauty. &gt;&gt; Satan is beautiful. Sin's beautiful. And as sin begins to get more and more more beautiful it becomes. How much better house we got today in the log house? How much more prettier is it? How much prettier is our women today than it used to be? See how much prettier is Florida it was now in the way God created. [clears throat] See it's got beauty. How many knows that Satan is a beauty and he desired beauty and tried to create a beauty, more beautiful kingdom and so forth? Sure, we know it. Satan is in beauty. Now notice he had vitamin R which is reasoning, vitamin B which is beauty, vitamin M which is modern. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to be modern? &gt;&gt; Just take his knowledge and find out if you don't believe that stuff. &gt;&gt; It'll grow right in you. that bottom will come right up where you're sitting some fellow stand up giving you some of his knowledge. Now look friends, what would it be if we took this great lovely cathedral here and had a lot of screaming and crying and speaking in tongues and run up and down the floor frothing at the mouth like mad dogs and and what do you think the mayor of the city would say deacon board if we permitted such a stuff as that to come in here? Oh sure it's modern. You think our people stand down there on the street with a tambourine their hand and &gt;&gt; what would it do if our sisters had come with big long hair hanging down and the rest of the church women going through town? Look at there. Look at there. While the pres this church ever wanted, you know, well, look, look at there. She looked like an old model, don't she? Her spare tire is going flat on the back. You know, something like that. WE WANT TO BE MODERN. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE DEVIL'S WISDOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT GROWS. THAT'S THE VITAMIN that's in the soil that comes out in the product that it produces. Go on, you modern Jezebel. All right. Modern. Like the women of today. Sure. Oh, modern. One of the most modern people in the town will come to the church. Sure. It's got Why? They grow in that modern vitamin. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Reasoning vitamin. Arth they grow in that. See, that's what it is. Reasoning. But as soon as you start growing in that, you're dead to the word. &gt;&gt; You have to deny the word before you can be that. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; the only way you can EVER BE A SINNER IS to deny God's word. &gt;&gt; What is sin? Unbelief. Unbelief in what? God's word. &gt;&gt; See, you have to deny the word first. Now, oh, I got about 10 more vitamins wrote down here. But here's one vitamin that he failed to tell him. He had vitamin D in there. That's the biggest vitamin in there. Results dead. It's the prettiest bunch of dress people. Most modern there is. Most beautiful church. Biggest organization. See, most modern there was, most beautiful there was, the most reasonable things CAN BE SAID. WHY wouldn't if God made us a creature of his? Why would he condemn these women from looking their best to have short hair? Why would he condemn a little makeup? Well, he had one in the Bible that did it and he fed her to the dogs. So, [laughter] think about that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD WHY WOULD GOD MY MY HE DON'T EXPECT us to live after that Bible. He sure did. He told E she must live. He told Jesus said that man lives by the every word every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Who said that? Jesus. Is that right? He said, "If any other man said anything different, let him be a liar. His word be true. Heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not. There you are. So vitamin D lays in his formula &gt;&gt; modern. That's right. Now but the word seed of the Bible can't grow IN SUCH GROUND AS THAT. How could a person going to one of those modern churches now the spirit of God come up on them and they uh they WANT TO HOLLER GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? Why you make the preacher swallow sermon? Well, I'm telling you, I I could just seem say [clears throat] and all them cranes there stretch that neck around, you know, look around and see, well, what said that? [laughter] Then a few minutes a preacher say Jesus Christ, THE SON OF GOD. GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S RIGHT. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; DEACONS, you're you're at the door a few minutes. They'll throw you right out. See, the word can't grow there. Just can't do it. No. Just can't do it. See? Just simply can't. &gt;&gt; See, and then he come spread his poison on top of it to try to kill the germ life in you. Now, we a group of people in the land today that believes that God heals. Well, of course, we know reasonable sense shows that God gave us doctors to heal. &gt;&gt; Now, you asked a good, sensible doctor if he's a healer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll tell you, "No, sir. &gt;&gt; I can move a tooth, but I can't heal a socket it comes out of." &gt;&gt; That's right. I can set an arm, but I can't heal it. &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY RIGHT. GOD IS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; NOW, how is something ever going to grow in such stuff as that? &gt;&gt; How can the seed word ever grow in such as that? This won't do. It can't grow in that kind of an atmosphere. It just certainly don't. But faith only grows in one vitamin. &gt;&gt; It only has one vitamin. Don't have to have any mixture at all. FAITH GROWS IN ONE VITAMIN. THAT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that faith CAN GROW IN IS THE WORD. And the only WAY THAT IT CAN GROW IS BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THE WORD. AND IT HAS TO TAKE ALL THE WORD AND BELIEVE IT'S TRUTH. And faith vitamin is spelled in a little four-letter word L I E LIFE. IT HAS VITAMIN L. Faith has &gt;&gt; faith has vitamin L. Wisdom has vitamin P, vitamin R, pleasure, vitamin reason, vitamin all these other vitamins. That fa uh re UH KNOWLEDGE HAS ALL THAT. SEE, wisdom has all that reasons AND NOW. BUT FAITH ONLY HAS ONE THING, &gt;&gt; LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's all IT'LL STAY. THY WORD IS LIFE. THY WORD IS TRUTH. HE IS THE WORD, THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Faith only hangs right there. That's all. IT WON'T TAKE IT. HOLY SPIRIT LIFE, ETERNAL LIFE. THAT'S WHERE FAITH GROWS IN WORD. ZOEY, GOD'S OWN LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the ONLY PLACE THAT FAITH CAN WORK IS WHEN THE FAITH HEARS THE WORD AND BELIEVES THAT IT'S GOD'S WORD. THEN IN THAT ZOEY, IT grows and it produces what the word said. &gt;&gt; God, how'd he make the world? Do you believe the world was in God's thoughts? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HAD TO BE. HOW DID HE MAKE IT? HE JUST SAID, "WHERE'S HE GOING TO GET THE THINGS? HOW COULD YOU EVER REASON WITH GOD?" SAY, "GOD, WHERE'D YOU GET THE MATERIAL to make the rocks out of? Where'd you They come from gases. WHERE'D YOU GET THE GAS, LORD?" SEE, how'd you ever make water? What is from H2O? WHERE'D YOU GET THE HYDROGEN oxygen at? See, that's it. See, it just doesn't make sense. What did God say? IT WAS IN HIS THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; And his thoughts IS HIS WORD BEFORE IT'S EXPRESSED. &gt;&gt; THEN WHEN HIS THOUGHTS SAID, "LET THERE BE." AND THERE WAS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's where faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the Hebrews 11 said, "By faith, the world was created. The world was made by faith." God made the world out of things that does not appear. By faith, God spoke the world INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE IT WAS a it was a pre-meditated word. &gt;&gt; But as SOON AS HE SAID IT, IT BECOME LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now you can say, "I believe that, brother Brandham." In your heart, YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. THEN EXPRESS IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Don't never change it at all. Stay right with it. Watch what'll grow out of it. It'll produce the word &gt;&gt; because it's faith. See, wisdom takes you away. Faith brings you to it. SEE THAT? THAT CUTS out every man-made creed. cuts out every school of learning of man-made theology. &gt;&gt; Just knocks them cold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are their professor DD PhD lq and all these fellas has to go to school and learn psychology and all these other things. There's only one thing he leaves out. How to present himself with psychology and what kind of clothes to wear and how he must say a man just so and oh nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let be led by the Holy Spirit. Sons of God are led by the spirit of God. Not the wisdom of the seminary, but the spirit of God leads the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Certainly, it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's out every creed, every school of learning, every man-made theology. No wonder they can't believe. There's nothing in there for it to grow on. They got vitamin R reasoning that we're supposed to cast away. Vitamin popularity, vitamin pleasure. You just got to have a little fun. What kind of fun? Oh, get out. Got a little drunk once in a while. You know, just have a little fun. It won't make any difference. You know, little things like that that all that all that vitamin C. And how is that kind of a vitamin ever going to grow a word that denies that vitamin? &gt;&gt; How you going to do it? &gt;&gt; See, the word denies that if you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God's not even in you, said the Bible. So, how's a how's God's how's God's word go to grow under vitamins like that? It takes a certain vitamin in the soil to produce the grain. &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the right kind of soil. We'll get into it just a little bit. See, it's got to have the right kind of soil. It won't grow the grain. You take certain grounds, it won't grow this and we'll grow something else. Sandy grounds and different vitamins and certain grows certain things that don't why you ain't got it and it just won't grow it. That's all. Now, weeds will grow pretty anywhere. Yeah. [laughter] any kind of ground. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Whole denominational weeds grow anywhere. But I'm telling you, brother, if you want to produce the fruits of life, she has to come out of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Sure. All right. I hope I ain't taking you all too long this morning. See, now don't see. All right. No wonder they can't believe they have nothing to live in. Jesus spoke of them in Matthew the 13th chapter and the first verse. Let's just turn over here and see what Jesus said about these things that we're talking of Matthew the 13th chapter and in the first verse. The same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered unto him so that he went into his ship and sat down and the whole multitude stood on the shore. And he spake unto them things in spake many things unto them in parable, saying, Behold, a ser went forth to sow seed. And when he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell on stony grounds. And when they had not much earth, and for with they sprang up because they had no depths of earth. And when the sun was up, they were scorched and came and because they had no root, they withered away. Some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them out. Others fell in good ground and brought forth some brought forth fruit, some 100fold, 60, and 30fold. Who has ears to hear, let him hear, not wisdom, ears. See? All right. Hearing it. All right. Notice he said, "Some went forth when the seed went forth, preached the word, some fell by the wayside, just like water on a duck's back runs right off." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some fell upon rocky ground, stony. And it had just a little dust that blowed up there and it sprung up but it didn't have no roots, no place to put its roots. Now I'm going to make illustrations here and I hope I don't hurt no feelings. See that was the Catholic church. They said it's built on a rock. I'll agree with them. I sure will agree with them. That's right. That's right. No earth on it at all. No earth on it to grow from. Why? They couldn't produce a They couldn't produce a B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B Bible vitam because they don't even believe in it. They doctrine is dogmas. That's right. Roman dogma, no word in it at all. See, fell up on rocks. That was a super wisdom. Oh, brother. I'm telling you, they had it in a super way. They presented in a way of psychology of great big buildings and fine dress. Look like holy gods of priests and everything else. How many heard that testimony? That little nun that just got out. You got it. Yeah. I want that played some Wednesday night. your church and every person here should have the testimony. One of them followed me for a long time. How they I went down there in Mexico myself and seen them lying pits where them nuns babies when the priest had them babies where they burnt them lying pits and things like that. That's what made communism spring up in Mexico. They broke up that Tommy rot. That's what made communism spring up in our Don't you never fear communism? God's using communism. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in it. It's of the devil. But God takes a devil and comes right back around like he did King Nebuchadnezzar. Come over and got Israel. See, you watch the Bible don't prove it. One of these days, we'll go into it. God raised it right up to avenge the children of God on that old That's exactly what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Said it burn with fire and she'd come to the end of her doom. That's exactly what's going to happen to her, too. There she is. That's the one that fell up on rocks. Just so little of soil to the thing couldn't grow. It died. Then that was super wisdom. Then some fell on the Protestant's ground. But after a while, the great wisdom of the big denominations choked it out. Choked the spirit out. Days of miracles had passed. Dr. So and so said so and so. See, no such a thing. Just perfect. Choked all choked all the what out? Choked out the spirit for the wisdom. See, the Holy Spirit fell in the days of Martin Luther. The Holy Spirit fell in the days of John Wesley. The Holy Spirit fell in the days of the early Pentecostal church. But what's the denomination's done with their wisdom have choked it out. &gt;&gt; Choked out what? The seed. What is the seed? The word. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that means this there. See, they get it. Many honestarted men of those ministers. I met him sit down and talk to them. Even on the subject of baptism and many things I've asked anybody to come to discuss it. They said, "Brother Brennham, IF WE DO THAT, OUR CHURCH WOULD PUT US OUT." I SAID, "WHO'S more to you? The word of God or your church? &gt;&gt; You'll never go no further." And that's dust of denomination. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. If it denies the word, it's wrong. See, it shows it's man-made wisdom. Now, the Protestants got choked out. It choked the spirit right out of them when they begin to take wisdom instead of faith in the word. The wisdom in the organization, the organizational wisdom instead of faith in the word. &gt;&gt; All understand that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. faith in what the what the group of men of the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Evangelicals and all got together and soon they're to form up a confederation of church which will be the image to the beast &gt;&gt; and he will have the same power in this nation. Revelations 13:11 that they had over there and will cause a persecution upon the saints just like they did at the beginning of the Roman church. See, that's where it's heading right up now. That's why the word's being sold RIGHT NOW EVERYWHERE. STAY AWAY FROM IT. &gt;&gt; GET OUT of it. See, now wisdom choked it out. Their own wisdom strangled the Holy Spirit away from them. Let me prove it to you in the Bible, Revelations, the third chapter. When we just got through the church ages, JESUS HAD BEEN STRANGLED FROM HIS CHURCH AND WAS ON THE OUTSIDE TRYING TO KNOCK ON THE door and get back in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it said. I stand at the door and knock. If any man will thirst, if you just let me in, I'll come. But nobody opened the door. See, they put him out. What was it? They had the the seed fell on them. See? See? But some fell in the valley of persecution. Some seed went over into the valley of persecution. Now, in the valley, it's where you find the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The best soil. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you take somebody's been beat down, so he's got all the theology beat out of him, laughed out of him, made fun of him, where he's been through the mills and ground it all out of him till the metal's been ready to work. You'll find out there's some moisture around there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Into the valley. That fell's been pitched over into the valley, kicked out of his organization, is down in the dumps, they call it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the dumps, but the valley. We're down in the valley. You know, that's where the lily girls, too, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. in the valley. All right. Some fell in the valley of persecutions. Hard trials. Some of them seed fell in there. Valley of persecutions. Hard trials. Be called everything like the lily was called be elub made fun of. But in this valley is the rivers of water. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Psalms one said, "Blessed is the name." Let me just read it. Let me show what's in this valley. What Psalms I thought I wouldn't have time but we just take time. Amen. &gt;&gt; See to read it. See to have this here. Lord &gt;&gt; we are going to read this and see what this man is down here. That's just where he's planted. If he's planted on the upon a dusty desert rock where there's no ground at all or is he planted in the valley? All right. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel the wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walkth not in the counsel of the ungodly. Standeth in the way of sinners. Siteth in the seat with the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, the word. And in the law word does he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree that's planted &gt;&gt; by the rivers of water. &gt;&gt; Rivers. What is that? The nine spiritual gifts. Rivers of one water, one spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One water. They're coming from nine different resources. &gt;&gt; Rivers of water. See, rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit, fruit of the spirit in his season, his leaves also shall not wither. And whatsoever he does, it shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, some fell down in that valley there where these rivers are. &gt;&gt; Well, as you noticed, I want to get something else. What was it done? It fell down in the river. It wasn't set out, but you shall be like a tree that's set out. transposed from this to that. &gt;&gt; He was planted. &gt;&gt; What? PREDESTINATED. &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHT OF GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION WORLD PLACED HIM THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Not stuck out. &gt;&gt; NOT BY CHANCE. &gt;&gt; BUT WAS PLANTED, PREDESTINATED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; To the rivers of water. Oh, his root shall not wither. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THOUGH HE DIES, I'LL RAISE HIM UP AGAIN AT THE LAST DAY. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's predestinated to be there. Not just by chance. He was predestinated to catch that word when it was sold. &gt;&gt; And he'll be right there. And when it sticks, she's there. He's planted. Not just stuck down. He's actually planted. &gt;&gt; That's right. A lot different sticking a stick in the ground than planting something. It's different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed was planted. It found its own root holes. &gt;&gt; When the water begin to come in, break forth its life. The spirit it begin to say and say there are nine spiritual gifts.

What fruits? The fruits of what? His fruits. &gt;&gt; What fruits? His own fruits. &gt;&gt; What fruit is it? The Bible. &gt;&gt; All of it's here. The fruit, love, you're in the Bible. Joy, you're in the Bible. Power, Holy Ghost, all these things here. Divine healing, promises of God. That's the fruits. Here it is.

Moves it up. Sure. He shall be like a tree that's planted by the waters. Brings forth his fruit in the season. Now, what kind of a fruit will it bring forth? John 14:11. John 14:11 he said Jesus said he at least 14:12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall heal you also why the same words in he &gt;&gt; he was the word is that right &gt;&gt; and if you abide me in my words in you that's what you will &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Evans back there not long ago he come up here drive so far He lost his car. Said over there, Miller left the key in it. Somebody come along and stole it. He had everything he had in it. He come up, him and brother Fred and brother Tom. Some of them come up the house and said, "Well, he looked like a little kid had his candy taken away from him. He's just all whipped out, you know." He said, "I just don't know what I'm going to do." I said, "Well, what is it now?" They're coming. What's the first thing to the word? Ask the father. If you abide in me in my word, you ask what you will. But stay with the word. Just stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; I said, "Let's pray." We got out on the floor. God started praying. While we were praying, I said, "Father, I come to thee in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Here is a brother that spends works just a few days a week, his hands all beat up, fixing the old wreck cars and things like that to get enough money to drive 14-,500 miles every Sunday to come into the meetings. got a bunch of children to feed. It cost him about around $50 or $75 a week to make that trip just to come to church. See, right? He come up here trying to hear the word as we're trying to endeavor to contend for it. And I said, "Now some evil person has stole his car." And what was it? I said, "Now, Lord, I pray thee, give him back his car in the name of Jesus Christ." What did I do? I placed that word, that promise before God, sealed it with the name of Jesus and sent forth the word &gt;&gt; right down the road. It went way out there. Found the place where it started like a hound on a rabbit's trail. See here he come right down the road howling. &gt;&gt; Got out there just about halfway to Balden Green, Kentucky. What broke forth? The word found him. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Just then a vision flew back. I seen a man in yellow looking shirt on driving a young fellow once been a Christian. The word struck him. You're doing wrong. The word caught him. He sent forth his word. See, see, and it caught him. You're gonna get caught in this someday. &gt;&gt; And the law is going to get you for doing this. Turn around. Take it back. The word got him. He had once been a Christian. I seen him ran up here standing on the side of the street. I said, "Brother, just take right out certain way here. You'll find your car. Wait here a while, Lord. He gets it back." Now, you had a full tank of gasoline. Yes, he said. I said there won't be anything bothered but there'd be half that gas and he calls it take half of it run he's about halfway to Bowling Green by about 100 miles of it run out when he found it that's the way it was sitting right exactly there what was it the word &gt;&gt; went and got him come back and said not long after that some man bought a car from him you slipped off and didn't pay it said brother Brandham I thought poor man ought $400 I said I prayed I sent the word the word went got on his back, found him. When he went out to find the man, he's never a Christian. See, he he did. He laughed. They asked him to go to church one time. He said, "Well, while a preacher's preaching, I look for pretty blondes." So, you see, you can't find that's that's the devil. That's See, so the word couldn't hold on to him. What the word do? It kept him in eye. See, just don't. Brother Welch just kept holding on. Said, "It'll be all right. It'll be all right." The word went after him. See, if you abide me in my word and you ask what you will. See, the word got after you. First thing you know, one of his boys was driving along down here on the road and there it was. He seen a man in a car, got his number, turned into brother Woods. They called to find out where it was. He was in bold and green. God in heaven knows and never heard one word about it. Know nothing about it. Last Sunday as we go afternoon when we got through preaching here, went up there and changed my clothes and got ready to go to Florida for the or down brother well for the meeting that following night when I got in the car, I seen that man. I said, "Brother Welsh," I couldn't tell him. Now, he's got to make a move himself. See, just like me, he had to make a decision there. See, I said, "We're going through Bowling Green." He said, "That's about 30 miles out of the way." Went on down the road. I thought, "Oh, he he he'll get it. See, he'll get it. He just got to get it." Went on down, Sister Evans. And I after a while, he said, "You know, Brother Brandon, he said, "Have I been so thickheaded?" Said, "You said Bowling Green a while ago." Yeah. He said, "Um, you know that man that got my money?" Run over with it. Yes. Said, "He's in Bowling Green. I've been thinking about this. I got a thing here. I'm going go turn it over and find him where he's at. Then I'm going to turn." I said, "So, what would you do? Would you go on down there and get your money?" Now, see, if I tell him that he's See, he's got something to do himself. See, he's got something to do. I couldn't tell him. But do it break the vision right there. See? So, I had to see just like why did Jesus stand there and said to MARY AND MARTHA, "TAKE YE AWAY THE STONE." WELL, he was God. He could said stone be no more and it wouldn't been there. But she had something to do. Why did he stand there look upon the harvest? You believe he was the Lord of the harvest? &gt;&gt; He said to his disciples, you pray the Lord of the harvest and he will send labors into his harvest. In other words, you ask me to do what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; See, we're buddies. WE'RE IT'S A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO. HERE'S THE GOSPEL. I KNOW IT. BUT IF YOU JUST SIT HERE AND don't preach it, what good's IT GOING TO DO? YOU GOT SOMETHING TO DO. YOU GOT TO MAKE AN EFFORT. You got to You say, "Well, I believe God can heal, but I just don't know." STAND UP AND LET THAT WORD BECOME YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; Believe it. Don't raise it. Just believe it. I said, "Well, I know if he didn't go, he's going to lose it." I said, "If it was me, if it was me, I go get my money right now." And he did. [laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; When he got the man up out of the bed, he had some money. He called over to the neighbor, got dressed up and paid it off. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SEE, if it can find a place, IT CAN TURN. NOW, SAME THING ON DIVINE HEALING. NOW, what brother Welch said, "Well, don't think I'll go down. Just think I'll go the other way." What that fell say, "Well, I ain't going out there with that car." See, it won't happen. But you Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Just give him praise this evening. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Thank you for your word this evening, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be your name, Lord. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your name of the Lord. Amen. Many appreciate the message this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's just turn to our Bibles at this time. We want to switch over to the Lord's Supper. I'm going to turn to first Corinthians chapter 11 verses 23-32. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we pray that you bless the word as we read it now, Lord, and bless this portion of the service, Lord, where we partake of your bread and wine and wash one another's feet. We pray that you will anoint your people for service, anoint the word of your read Jesus name. Amen. 1 Corinthians 11. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same man also he took the cup when he had stopped saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Let us bow our heads, close our eyes. Our heavenly father, we are so grateful to be here this evening one more time in your presence. Lord, as we have come, Lord, to obey the ordinance of your word, Father, whereby, oh God, we partake of the bread and wine, Lord, of the bread symbolizing the body and the blood uh the wine, the blood of Jesus Christ, Father, Lord God, we pray that you would sanctify and bless the articles that have been prepared, Lord God. And we pray that as your believers would partake this evening that you would sanctify our hearts Lord and Lord lift us up in the realm of the spirit father Lord where we could experience sweet communion with you Father. May we have Lord love one for the other. And may our love for you grow stronger and stronger each day. Father Lord strengthen the weak Lord and build up Lord those that need building up Father. May your holy spirit pour out upon your people. Fill and refill, Father. And [snorts] Lord, bless the time of washing one another's feet where we would wash each other's feet with respect and love and appreciation for one another as you did, Lord, to your disciples. Lord, you said to do likewise. Father, bless your people, Lord. Bless each and every one of us at this time in Jesus name of thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. Amen. Keep your heads bowed and your eyes closed as we want to observe a moment of silence is where you would pray for the ministry and the ministry pray for you at this time. Praise the name of the Lord. You may be seated at this time and say I'm going to ask the deacons and the elders to come forward. Amen. As he get ready to sue.
