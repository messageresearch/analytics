Bibles the first Corinthians chapter 11 you wanna read in verse 23 as we approach the communion table you'll see a few words are you going to come in if I receive of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after they same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as offered he drink it remembrance of me as often as they eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you I mean he sleep for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for now let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word and for your presence among us Lord we pray come into your word and speak to our hearts and anointest for this little time here before communion in Jesus and we ask at amen now be seated there are two articles that have been given to us which is feet washing and communion that the believers and I want to put it as bright believers should be partaking of I think I will begin to include that bright believer should be are taking off this morning I heard about four groups you have to belong to one a group who identify with a group about a banner pitch a message using the same scripture and the scripture was designing the Lord the body of the Lord there was a message that he preached discerning the body of the Lord and he was saying our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we hear it's determined on what dazeem and we have of what we see and what we hear it's not the same as it again our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see what we hear but it didn't my what design meant we have what we seem to be here and it's like every backer coming to you or every situation along your life it's not the situation you know is what you'd is in if you look on flesh-and-blood you get back up with flesh and blood if you look beyond flesh and blood you get a rest another back is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness sometimes you can't explain people behavior and you are thinking you want an explanation or you would like an explanation but it was no explanation is that demon behind it it's a spirit behind here that is the explanation and some of the things is only prayer and God could serve such a situation is that or Kanade your man Tandy beat Travis your point that's pure water reason nothing that's pretty one to keep that person in bondage so your irrational against flesh and blood understand the warfare it's not what you I see is what it is earn by what you I see is not what your ears hear if you're negative about me the first thing somebody telling ago about me easy to hear it because your spirit is already negative but if they're not negative you're rejected outright because the other coming toward you with this before they bring the old talk so you shut them down right away you don't wanna hear that why you wanna hear about some sister or hirabai burn brother you have no discernment you have to come back to discernment Oh hallelujah you have to have discernment shout out discernment it's a word that you have to have manifested in your life discernment Christian resentment discerning the body of the Lord that's why I say when you think you're coming into presence the whole concept for coming to church changes you're not coming to this tabernacle you're coming into presence you can go to every church and there's no presence there's a building deacons people sitting down but there's no anointing there is no atmosphere you went to church but when you come you come into presence in presence you can get up richer impresses they get a touch impresses they get the revival they're coming into presence Oh glory to God and impresses you when to come in obedience Paul was not disputing with them for taking the communion the act was right by the decimal is wrong for taking the Lord's Supper is the commandment of the Lord but they take it on wordly not discerning the Lord's body is where the wrongly these Christians was taken the communion and not living the life Christianity is an experience and a life not coming to church more than a memory Jamaat going so I'm nothing moving in your heart no Christianity is applied word apply the gospel it's like when the doctor give the medication and just have to take it you are paying what you're taking how much time the doctor give it in your ticket you're taking the irregular with it because yeah yeah any convinced of it but when you know it's good for you when your notice will help you when you know your body going down and a troublesome road and then you have to apply what is being given to you but this is the gospel it got spills hallelujah this Christian would take in the communal living the life Christian sees experience in my life and these Christians will live in any kind of a life making a poor example of the profession this is direc there's a meter in the wood for you and I kind of rooting for you ain't we not one nobody a train would want to take it for example I remember my job first and I tell people when I hit a job a new job our news department is I'm a Christian you know you know as you see that not maybe Brusilov back for you but to be held a comfortable I want to s see nothing and then you have to compromise because he has seen let them know up front this soul come in here is a Christian so ever going off key but it look like Christian but if you're Christian boy dies I want to hear Christian do do that and you see a Christian how you doing man then the people are wrong you whole you are comfortable because with your testimony you bring presence I see people about the custom when I come at the Christian coming so your presence and your prison because conviction because your testimony is ahead of you and you live in because you easy high priests of your confession and as you confess the Christianity he is making intercessions to bring you the pass to make their life speak out to making life Tunde if you don't say nothing you have nothing to intercede on your behalf you have to speak it I'm a Christian I'm a believer by stripes I'm healed I will be delivered I will get a breakthrough my hallelujah you have to speak it you can't be sick and he permit a sick sick sick and even though you're sick I believe I know you're sick but God I know you're here yet and this word said I said I'm healed he want to hear your confession of healing yeah yeah bones within here but here what here a confession of Elin he can only enter seed upon watch a confess if you convert confess is sick wait wait wait you want a cup confirmation music miss you when comments is it devil come as let me confirm that to you you are sick I mean finally I know you can you breathe he said see a sexy sick ohgod if you know if even look at my head but this when where I'm also sick like he died doctor tell me tight not instead of eat soup because creamy healing and he said I am Here I am Hugh want affirmative holy stomach so I'm healing you somebody was lying he said he was confessing the promise of God he wasn't lying okay the Lord a shout when you confessing to you that I'm not I thought they were you're not lying okay the Lord has choked raise what I come in a preacher season let me say it again when you're confessing a team that enough I stole their world you're not lying you're confessing the word and say thank you handle that because you see a trembling by sound he'll Oh Gloria I'm here I'm here I'm here but after like a chamber less time he I am I hurried up God so it is your right to confess the word that you feel that you're delivered that's why the Bible says let the weak say let the weak say one more time let the weak say he will confirm strength to you because he's in the Serie B hands from your confession give the Lord a show come on man come on woman with the testimony on front verse let the world know you're a Christian let your name I know you're Christian let the street know your Christian walk like one talk like one act like one live like one and comment a communion like one or get the Lord a shout in the house let me see so what we and we who call ourselves Christians we have no right to take the communit unless we are living above a reproach of the world we have no right the comunicados or living ranked as an example of Christianity the worst thing that is in the world is a person who try to impersonate something there's too much of that in the world today not only do we in this deal are guilty of the same crime that Paul was rebuking the continued for but I'm trying to do something that the Lord had commanded without designing the body of the Lord yeah God said do it but what is hidden behind it you see this always as in man behind somebody who legalistic was talking about brother Branham over one playing a piano and she dressed was short he say but but but look at me spread that you have so somebody might find forth that's addressed not up the standard but a heart and spirit was up to standard maybe they all she had maybe that eunuch Roshi maybe the one she had that was supposed to be long fell in some mud or something I'm gonna get to put on and she said not to stay home she'll come and put them to piano she said doing something she still doing better than some people's that I here doing nothing she still doing something she praying for the Lord I'm somebody fighting forged by that but there's a reason behind that it's not what you see it's what you deserve okay the Lord I show you see a short dress but you deserve a spirit [Applause] [Music] it is you look and see the one of the well and all who won't she man she written what's she doing and how she living but you're not seeing the resume it of a spirit that she was honest and butter man said she was feeling hot and Rutland buddy and he Pharisees was cleaning buddy and rattling hard and God except when I reject the other or give the Lord some praises oh praise God I hear my name call tonight ray I'm identified with the woman at a well I don't know about you or Gloria but if you look at Nigeria business it gets caught in she likes a business that is media they can fight machine that is your business but when the master come and calling him every choice and show not only was she joking - no everyone shouting - because she found where name was written and she found which coop she was in or gave it all I shocked he said rejoice that because it has no Devils rejoice because your name is on that book and that is all your rejoice the name is on that book hallelujah all right so today he said okay what today we are doing things that is in in any of the Word of God we should have a dissonant on everything that we do I may take that slow this message has so much depth in it so much stuff in it just that one man I launched a shake up everybody's not here we should have a discernment of every thing that we do it ought to be measured by the Word of God that means you have a resentment of who sees your friends you call friends is not friends Samson like in Delilah wasn't the problem Emma he had a choice he kinda like somebody among Israel but he twisted like a liar the problem wasn't Delilah and the problem that the liner was a channel that it never could use that is the path Samson didn't deserve like she like she but what he did not see is that she was a pool in the hand of the enemy when the Mac bus as we were saying local Palin's she buses truth by selling the secret out to the enemy and then the cut is here he lost the power he lost he anointed he lost the joy he lost his glory because sentence so they totally like I like you know she might have good intention but behind she has somebody else so this friend might have good intention but behind that face that cold friend is somebody else have dissonant but I a shout in the house don't let it ever point will over I have discernment but as business friend natural friend normal friend family friend it doesn't matter have a discernment as what is working behind the act that mover let's continue which are these demand everything we do in order to be measured by the Word of God all of Christians do once a should be measured by the will of God today people change quite a bit they say sometimes but more reliability on what did she did see that what he would see that's why I tell you though watch what people do in here what's what you would see dr. mrs. the sponsor doing it you could do it to know what you would say when I say somebody back sitting right in here and she favorite that is and she'd have a clue what she hearing how much discerning no discernment just come into church so you're not following this and so and so and brother so and so you don't know where he I am God falling the word you're on the word hallelujah David couldn't give my testimony or follow any brothers or he brother Vinnie ami and no brother to fight Goliath when David come here his own personal revelation let's not test the money he wasn't following nobody yet he cement he killed a lion he killed a bear and the same God that delivered a beer into his hands deliver the lion in his hands could never pull out and his hand that must be your testimony even your testimony your brother's really biggest thing is I killed must be doing something sir so now you can notice tonight because we're the first of all it is a big big thing we always like that talking to people never being back people never went off here talking to be giving an explanation and they never went in the bathroom they'll never get wounded they don't nobody wore looking like the only reason about war real about war there you can serve at this court about war and war talk and want this never on the battlefield talk to a man talk to a man who are being about the field twice real soldier [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Laurie look good talking about war I'm going to war it's two different things all together we know war tonight we all just leave them a war never left your wife never love to your husband they lasted son your daughter your children your marriage your home your family you the devil after you if we could cut you off before time you will cut your before time if you get your sickness disease cancer leukemia diabetes high blood pressure whatever you wanna take you out when our job is to cast him out get him out resist him out Loreena call us our job no busier is I all my stuff on a fixed scale any grave already never worry about nothing skin you know why wanting to fix them because you don't you have a testimony because your words your testimony could influence somebody into this kingdom what if it's the last one whatever is the last name what is the last soul and what is written on you to give a testimony because before enoch left he had a testimony brother George that he pleased God hallelujah that's a crow to know to move if I'm breathing yourself and fighting to prove a point for yourself and pleasing your family and you go past that and present this one and that one you go past that until I come to a spot you know care who lost who ball who vets who lose you don't care about that all you care about is pleasing God you become fearless you become anointed you come fearless you don't care what anybody say your purpose is to please God your purpose is to walk in the will of God your purpose is to fulfill the commission that God gave you jesus said my will is to do the will of him that sent me and to

take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me so this is also to remember the Lord what he's done for you how he's been with you and after the same man he took the cup and he stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me father often as he eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord let a man examine himself so lovingly eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many
