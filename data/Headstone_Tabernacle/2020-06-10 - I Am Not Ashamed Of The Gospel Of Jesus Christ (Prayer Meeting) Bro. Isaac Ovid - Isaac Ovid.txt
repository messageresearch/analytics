gathered in his presence God in his will and his purpose because we have to believe it's his purpose for us to be here tonight so that we can continue to grow and to be drawn closer to him and we're certainly grateful for another opportunity for another space of Greece and it is a sacrifice a sacrifice of fries a sacrifice of worship a sacrifice to come together to pray and to be dedicated I'm consecrated to God and so but over Laxmi obviously we spoken of as you know a little bit wasn't feeling too well so I by the grace of God have to step up to the plate so tonight if you have your Bibles I want to touch three portions of Scripture tonight just a word of encouragement as we approach a prime meeting tonight and this season that we're living in and looking at what's transpiring around the world so I want to read from the book of Jael tonight the book of Saint Mark and finally the book of Romans tonight three portions of scripture just to bring a sort of encouragement to us and to strengthen us along the journey so Joelle - a very familiar portion of Scripture and just before I really just bow our heads for word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord that we could have this virtual service as it were this Lord this time of coming together on you would again around your scriptures around this prophetic message of this our law that gives us confidence and bonus and safety and security when others have no hope father we stand with hope when others have no assurance we stand with assurance tonight Lord may you take me out of the way Lord may you touch my body as well and anyone else that needs are touched and I remember our past in a special way and all the different situations in the church Lord and the different believers Lord the diverse conditions Lord physical or whatever the situation may be father we bring it under your blood tonight Lord I we thank you for your grace that is sufficient for us Lord we could Lord stand boldly Lord in your presence Lord and lay our lives at your feet Lord looking for a touch from You Lord may you inspire a reading of the word and the opening of our understanding to your scriptures tonight may you encourage us along the way may you bless those that already here tonight those that would join us Lord me you bless those that couldn't make it for some reason and may you be with us tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen so I want to read from Joelle - and from verse 23 be glad then each turn of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former in moderately and he will cause to come down for you Doreen the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheats and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker womb and the caterpillar and the Palmer will my great army which I sent among you and he shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt one justly with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and not else I'm my people shall never be ashamed I want us to notice there that both verses 26 and 27 and will be a very same wood structure of my people shall never be ashamed and I want to go now to see in mark it and reading from verse 34 st. mark it and reading from verse 34 and when he had called the people unto Him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever come after me and this is a real challenge to us as Christians you know many times we want to come our we we want to do things do we we want to do things but here it is Jesus is challenging both the people who were they as well as his disciples so it was not a message that was directed to just a people but along with his disciples he's saying when he had called the people unto Him with his disciples also he said unto them collectively whosoever shall come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me so firstly we see here there has to be a denial of self to be able to follow there has to be a denial of self and a taking up of a cross there has to be a sacrifice and it is not just denying yourself it is taking up the cross so there's a new burden so there's a sacrifice there's also a burden and now there's a command to follow so that we three things there if you want to come after me and many times I would have said this in a previous meeting that many times we we glaze over these scriptures I mean reading scriptures and we don't really stop to process the words so I want to take it slowly whosoever shall come after me and I believe tonight everyone in this room wants to come after him we are not here coming after man and and if you have been around for some time you know how much we preach against following man so we talked about coming after Jesus and Jesus basically say if you want to come after me there are three things that that you must do you must deny yourself you must take up his cross and you must follow me three different things three different behaviors three different expectations three different challenges and we have to contend with on a daily basis how much have you denied yourself today have you taken up the cross today and did you follow him today but let's go on for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and many of us we're trying to save our lives you can save our alive with our efforts we're trying to do things that we think will advance us we're trying to do things that we think will help us make progress we're trying to do things that we think will actually help us and go to seeing here in Scripture whosoever will save his life so our efforts to save ourselves we will lose it but whoever shall lose his life for my sake understand again sticking it slowly it's not just lose your life but for his sake because many people lose their way and it's not for his sake but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it and then a great compelling question for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul these are deep rooted questions that Jesus is asking because in our doing and in our going and in our coming and in our living it is easy for people to have a desire to gain the whole world or the part of the world that we think is valuable to us and Jesus is challenging us what shall it profit if you give all of your ambitions you go all the targets and don't tell me you don't have goals and ambitions and targets you wake up in the morning with the desire to do something in doing that something that gaining of that activity don't lose your soul and then he puts it another way in other words he's saying in other words or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and coming to these meetings is us giving something finding out something doing something because we value our soul I truly believe that you would not be in this room tonight if he didn't value your sole value the condition of you soon and then he goes to whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me enough my words in this adulterous and sinful generation and Jesus is speaking here and and and it's somewhat difficult because when you compare when he was here and when he was speaking and who he was addressing it makes you wonder if he was really addressing the people who were around him because it would seem that this scripture is so appropriate for now whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels and I will a scripture reading tonight from Romans 1 and just reading one verse verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek we Lord and a blessing so the reading of his word tonight and there's so much here in scripture that we cannot explore it all but I just want to touch some highlight points and if it were to give a thought or text or something to remember this by it will be I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ and just to connect the dots we see in Joelle with the restoration he said my people shall never be ashamed and he repeats it again as if the in passing we saw them glaze over this and I would have preached on a similar theme sometime ago about my people who shall never be ashamed but if there's something there that God wants us to catch and then he speaks about who was so ever shall be ashamed of me and of my words so it's true level of embarrassment or Sheen it's ashamed of him and of his words in this sinful and adulterous generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed and then there's great declaration poor mix to the Romans I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth you know and I was looking at what is happening in the world today and it is requesting that you address matters with wisdom but at the same time you cannot abandon certain core truths and core principles because behind every movement behind every message there's a spirit behind everything that's operating as a spirit and there's a spirit of the age so in Noah's day there was a spirit of the age that defined the behaviors that people were living out in the days of lot and Sodom there was a stir of the age that was there when with a Branham came there was a spirit of the age and brother Branham preaching in the u.s. spoke I think in 1956 he said America has rejected this and in rejecting it whether Branham said I don't even want to pray for America no more that America is finished and it was as a result of the spirit of the age and we don't politicize in this ministry we don't get into these things but I want to go a little under the surface here because in seeing different undercurrents of what's happening around the world you were starting to hear me narrative also of things being silently and subtly put into places you know and and and and it is common knowledge it's all over the news they are protests in the u.s. they are protests in Europe they are protests in Africa near protests even in Trinidad you want to class here for different things and different agendas and and and and people have their right you can change anyone's perspective on what they believe in but on a deeper level I suddenly hear certain things and see certain messages beyond the issue of the black lives matter movement and these things to begin to see the narrative begin to expand to black lives matter and I saw a post that spoke about transvestite lives matter and we begin to go into a play area that I say wait a minute is it a paving of a way of different agendas being subtly put in there because there was a time in history most of us younger generation would not remember when women were not allowed to vote so Betty Branham said that changed things and when women began to vote then certain movements were started and and throughout history all these things as a result of the spirit of the age to push what a real agenda is so while people are comfortable with a general theme it is not a general theme that really is the issue it is what is underlying the general theme and it comes back to this adulterous and sinful generation and in this adulterous and sinful generation and I would have mentioned it in maybe this meeting or like I tell you I get blurred now with which meeting I mentioned what but to see how in Russia for example they are comfortable to silence books a brother branham because they find that in that message it's stuff that hits against what they want to become normal or what they want to become acceptable people protest for what they believe in people fight for what they believe in and there's nothing wrong with fighting for what you believe in and it is when the agenda shifts to people not becoming ashamed of what they should be ashamed of and it is when people become the same of what it should not be ashamed of I hope I'm not losing you tonight so I want us to be very careful in our life and in our operation that we don't become a shame of him our God and of his words because when pressure is going to come pressure has to come pressure must come right now black lives matter is the message but that would not always be the message because this will also pass and when this is addressed there will be another matter there will be another issue there will be another agenda that will come up until it reaches a head or a confrontation so where this scripture will have to come into play with are you ashamed of me or of my words ashamed of me is a direct attack against what God represents their people sadly who grew up in this message who don't even believe in God no more there are people who grew up in Bible believing Christians who questioned what should not be questioned but even more subtle because you could say to me but I think I am a believer I believe this message I believe the Prophet I believe the Lord what can you say that you are also not ashamed of his words because his words has never changed his words have never changed his words are the same he said I'm the same yesterday I'm the same today I'm the same forever so the challenge to us tonight is how we give him ground in our daily lives and the way we live and I'm and I'm watching people the enthusiasm and the passion for what you believe and I'm looking to see God's people have a passion to what they believe also I've said it before I've seen many people this year is an election year and I can guarantee you they are people in this room who are excited to go on a political party they excited to fight for the cause of what they believe in because they believe and at the end of the day that is something that is temporary that will lead to failure that can never solve anything because at the end of the day everything on this earth is orchestrated by what God allows years ago when people thought that Hillary would win the election and it they never taught Trump would win but here we have a guy called Trump in the White House and that is what God allowed to happen to allow everything to unfold for us to be a district occur point if somebody else was in the White House this might this whole situation we face no good what I've been refused differently but God who is allowing the chess pieces to move is allowing things to fall into place to bring a confrontation God loves conflict the conflict healing started the conflict started in heaven the Bible said and there was war in heaven so he's looking to start the conflict but the conflict was started and we are still dealing with the conflict and that is why we come to these friend meetings and these services because we didn't start the conflict but we were born into our conflict we were born into a war we didn't ask to be in the war but we were put into the war but being pleased in the war I see was pleased in us of overcoming in this war if we would stand and not be ashamed of the son of man and of his words this same Paul who said I wasn't I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ but it is the power of God unto salvation that was not always his testimony this is a change man who is speaking this is a transform the man who is speaking a few years before he would write this he was after these same people but he went through a transformation in his life can the church say man that changed the way he spoke and I prayed it to God that in these meetings that in these times in our closet we could go to a chance of mission hallelujah that change how we talk to change how we walk to change how we live until you can make the statement in the opinion to the wall I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believed to the Jew first and also to the Greek can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine but a Clarence I haven't checked my time and I don't know if I will check it when I started get inspired you know so you know I think we will have to speak it Sunday because I don't know how oh that one our wedding weekend god help us the random said whosoever is ashamed of me and my wood and he said he and it's wood are one so being a shame of his wood in this simple present generation I'll be ashamed of him do you know how it is if good ashamed of you are you living a lie that God could be proud of you in other words he the opposite of this is this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased oh come on now on the one hand it's this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased that's that's the opposite of this and on this side we talking about I'm ashamed of your walk I'm ashamed of you talk I'm ashamed because because you are ashamed of him and his words the Bible says God has to be ashamed oh come on now anybody with me so is your prayer life enough that God could say I'm pleased with your prayer life and please switch your testimony I'm pleased with the way you're living and pleased with how to deal went and you had a testimony that you are not ashamed friends it's easy to live in spiritual mediocrity mediocrity is easy you know his status school is easy doing what everybody else does is easy I had a conversation with some resident and I said the problem I have is people like the thing too small and I thought someone was wrong with me until I connected it with brother branham saying we need to ask for big things we asked him for small things we serve a big goal and we asking God for chunky chunky things you have big challenges big problems acts court to solve that and more come on now when we come to these sessions you want to act off any small thing that that you could try to fix yourself bring the big things to God that is what he wants can the church say Amen but Abraham said we have some time tonight right the midis those prophets those daring messengers of God come with out church without denomination without organization without anything they defied king kingdoms churches everything when the priests they was brought before the priests it wasn't ashamed because they had does see the Lord that's how I feel tonight oh come on now we ought to be revolutionaries for the gospel for the kingdom of God listen we are in a minority you know we are in a minority and by the Branham taught us one is a majority in God he doesn't need 5,000 people he does need one two three people who could break past the limits who could break past whatever whatever is holding you back tonight can the church see him in and I think of the province of all when they come with that message and it back it embarrass the kings and it made that people feel uncomfortable the priests even when they feel uncomfortable because they were supposed to be leaders religious men and the word comfort in that manner it exposed them and they felt embarrassed or seen hallelujah and many times we see that not too many today that many say I'm a Christian have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you see they're embarrassed about it friends I want to challenge us to not be ashamed to pre their not be ashamed to worship do not be ashamed to have a testimony and your job have a testimony in your business to have a testimony in your marriage to have a testimony in your family you are not ashamed of this message you are not ashamed of the Son of Man or of his words can the church say man let me try the front a place to wrap up here a little bit I'm ready Branham would have gone through many cases he talked about Noah Noah was not ashamed we talked about the Hebrew boys the Hebrew boys was not ashamed Daniel was not ashamed they were not ashamed for all the ages can the church same and Moses was not ashamed or blessed be the name of the Lord so I would have taught on this before and I just want to run it through a little bit again the very first time that the word shame has found his phone in the book of Genesis and we read it I believe it's the end of Genesis some when there Genesis 1 ye inform God was pleased hallelujah I said that Adam and Eve were naked and they were not achieved can the church say Amen that's the end of Genesis 2 and they were both naked and a man is white and they were not ashamed there was nothing hidden we had nothing to hide they had no secrets there was no barrier between them and God there was nothing to him the perfect communion and this is where we started to bring it into into a prayer and the conversation now so by the end of Genesis 2 after all of God's creation God is now addressing and we know it Moses was the one who's writing but God said it is good it is good it is good it is good and the Bible says it ends Genesis 2 let me Genesis to the very last verse there and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed nothing hidden before good and this is not just physical this is he could see through their lives I wanted to just sink a little bit we have nothing to hide they had no secrets there was no barrier between them and God and because of that they were not ashamed there was nothing to him the perfect communion now when you study scripture the Bible makes a point about something is because God wants to draw attention to it so God was pleased the fact that he Lord that there he could have just said they were naked but he made a point about it then they were not ashamed I'm very careful with Scripture they have nothing to be ashamed about and he will find out that the only time she was introduced in Scripture is when man fell the fall of man or the introduction of sin brought with him before sin there was no shame there was nothing like embarrassment it was nothing like disappointment because everything was perfect so when sin came and I hope this helped somebody tonight when sin came it brought a barrier and that shame that came with sin let her hiding it led to guilt it left her denial it left to covering up in letter I can't tell anybody and are preaching this before and it's easy because no over the last three months in particular where we have not had the opportunity to come together it would allow some of us to hide hide hide hide what we're doing hide how we're living the same letter let me just keep on acting it was harder to do it when we had regular service but now it's been a little more easy because it's easy to hide I'm not accusing you of hiding but it's easier to hide the shame would lead us to I hope they don't see me shim hiding sin shame hiding sincheon covering up sin shim because this is what led adam to go hiding that cos go out to see Adam where are you and we have taught is not the physical location but it was sin that brought shame shame brings hiding are you hiding what are you hiding what are you trying to cover up sin brought shame shame brought hiding hiding brought to covering up and you find Adam cutting fig leaves trying to cover up sin shame shame hiding hiding covering them some of us we cover up with just a smile it's a cover-up some of us we cover up with enthusiastic expressions sin bring shame shame brings hiding hiding brings covering up we cover up by overcompensating in different ways it's still covering up because under the cover up is the shame under the shame is a sin anybody with me tonight maybe I'm coming I'm inside a housing coming kind of clothes coming kind of kind of dealing with the ETD in a man a little bit because you could only get free if we can expose the shame and get to these sin and I just the sin issue can the church say Amen because we wanted to put a sin issue to rest not as a cover-up can the church say Amen because Buddha venom taught us when they kill the world and the goat on the sheep it was covering sin but when Jesus died and his blood was shed it was not to cover it was to oh come on now he said it was like bleach oh come on out when you drop it inside of their glory of God it destroys the sinking Whitney and when sin is destroyed she means destroyed and when shame is destroyed there's no cover-up Oh hallelujah I hope you catch this tonight come on young brother come on young sister sin hiding hiding shame covering up while you struggle with how to dress what music to listen to trying to hide what you really believe because you don't want anybody to know that you're really a Christian and you have a testimony so you play this game I'm trying to work on the edge saying things that you shouldn't say doing things you shouldn't do going places you shouldn't go it's a cover-up because you can't be who you really are in God can the church seem and anybody with me and many of us we are facing that semen and I want you to remember now Paula scene I am not ashamed and the Bible and my people shall never be ashamed I remember I was very young and we had a family gathering very um under ten years old better be under ten years old and we had a family gathering and I can't remember in Soto ever and my dad was B was blessing a house or whatever it was and he's singing a song and the whole family's here so I'm watching my cousins and I'm seeing everybody there and my dad is looking at me remember like the sing with me and I'm watching my cousins and many times we struggle with this trying to fit in and and you know is it the cool thing to do or you know you're you're you don't want to stand out too much and but it has to come a point when I'm not telling you run along the highway with with the prophet books on your head and and I think you're running on your street and paint your car in your rainbow colors that I'm talking about and I know that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about have any confidence to know where you're standing and having an assurance that this gospel is so rooted in your heart that nobody could take it out can the church say Amen but just to help somebody and I do know who I'm speaking to tonight I'm hoping to not be too much longer my people shall never be ashamed ashamed of this gospel ashamed to have a testimony ashamed to testify why don't you testify to people why don't you testify about this gospel why haven't you done more because if you really believe something if you really believe something and believe in something it should become natural for you to tell people about it it isn't it right so what is ruling you back from telling people that you have access to a joy and a peace and a comfort are you ashamed to tell your family then you need to understand why that is why are you ashamed to tell your family I said it in in in a service indigo Martin maybe of a year or two ago I said your life in front of your neighbors your physical neighbors must be in such a minute if you tell them come to serve is the one that come to our service it cannot be that if you invite your neighbor to a service they say to go to church with you to go to your church you you your your your church so it means that you have to live such a life and it's so transparent in terms of what you believe that when people see you and the way you live they are attracted by your life and your being persuaded you ever meet some of you already convinced what's something they will tell you listen you have no other option but to do what I tell you to do you know you meet somebody who is passionate about something about some other product or something you meet a good serious one who really passionate about what is selling listen when they talk to you you will think that is the only thing a traveler because they're passionate about it how passionate about this gospel are you and what is holding you back what are you ashamed of what are you afraid of because shame and fear is also connected we don't have time to go into the oil tonight but she might fear because that she unfairly hiding that's Adam was ashamed and he was afraid he thought that's what he said I was afraid and I hid myself come to church seaman let me go a little deeper Webster's dictionary defines the word Shem as a feeling of disgrace or guilt a feeling of inferiority or unworthiness shame is that negative feeling or emotion we get on the inside of ourselves when we know we're not acting the way we're supposed to act when we know we have done something we have no business doing in the Bible shame is described as that awareness in the innermost part of our being that lets us know when we transgress against God's law we have violated one of his commands shame is that guilty feeling we get on the inside when we know we've offended the very presence of God in our hearts now I know this is not the kind of message people like to get into because it makes us confront who we are and confront who we are in the world because we want to grow friends and I'm challenging us to grow you have to decide you want to grow because if you're not growing you're dying if you're not adding you are dying and as a people as an individual it must really be real to you because you want to be able to stand in front of God I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed of this anima and live on the scripture that my people will never be ashamed you have nothing that you seem about because his blood has washed you clean and you know have a testimony of living clean of staying clean by speaking clean by walking clean and he could walk boldly to the throne of God and when you ask it ask it wondering how will my requests be processed but because he in good standing I want to use that term good standing you know when it goes in the bank to get a loan it wouldn't have your credit in good standing because if you accustomed to to not team your loans on time then you're in bad standing so they want to know if your account in good standing if your accountant with God in good standing not your attendance in this meeting come on now that is from mantasy yes God blesses that but I'm talking about what we cannot see that is the issue that's the real issue what we don't see is your account with God in good standing tonight let me try to really so close tonight shame was the reason the woman and the well went to the well when nobody else was there she did not want to hear the comments of how many men she had been with she was know tired of the whispers she was tired of the silent looks and the shrugs are soulless here she is it was shame it was seem that led David to become a murderer after he had abused his power and slept with another man's wife and in his shame he sent a man to be killed you anybody with me tonight the woman will issue a blood I've preached this before but I just taken a little slower to make sure it resonates in your soul you woman with the issue of blood a situation meant that she could not go to the temple you under Judaic law if you're bleeding you cannot approach a man you can't even touch his sons as a mother so this woman could not even talk to Jesus hallelujah how could she even tell Jesus why she came but Hashim pushed her to decided if I could just touch the hem of His garment I could be mean hall she went beyond Hashim friends don't let the shame of your past of your mistakes and of your failures you let that shame leave me to hide in the wrong place tonight I want to challenge you to great pass the limit don't hide in your home don't hide in solitude don't hide behind your world there people who hide behind their work you know they hide behind housework the I behind here I'd look behind behind computers you hide behind food behind behind in newspaper they hide behind meetings they hide behind headphones and people have led listen to music but I don't want to confront the real issues of life and it might soar as if I need to relax but what are you really hiding I'm not accusing anybody of anything is you have to look at yourself in the wood and you have to answer to God in your time of threat tonight because I'm challenging you tonight to be able to have the testimony that says I am NOT I've sinned can the church semen you friends I want to bring it close to this stop hiding behind fashion education your career Facebook stop hiding in church sub hiding in business or procrastination stop hiding behind lies or diversions stop hiding between being serious or behind the jokes stop hiding behind being brave or being timid stop hiding by being an extrovert or an introvert in closing we do need a place to hide but me to hide in the right place Alleluia and there's only one place that we could hide it offers the protection that we seek where our shame is covered because Jesus didn't come for perfect people he said neither oh well have no need of a physician when I came to heal the brokenhearted I came to take the pieces of your life and all the shame you have carried and the Mystics and the failures and put it together again you know I was I was thinking this woman with the issue of blood she would have felt broken this is this is powerful she would have felt her life was broken but you know when Jesus looked at her he didn't see her broken he saw all of her oh my god I don't care what challenge you going through tonight and who you feel her life could be in different ways and different places and this was going wrong when Gordon looks at you to the blood tonight he sees all of you and his love is what reached from eternity broke truth time knew who you were wrote your name in blood before you were even here and predestined meet you by foreknowledge and he wrote it in the past tense who he foreknew past tense he called past tense who he called he had already justif oh come on now anybody in the house
