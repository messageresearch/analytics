[27:50] that
[27:52] and goliath told david a lie he said i'm
[27:55] going to feed you to the birds

[29:04] the power of position the hallelujah
[29:07] goliath was was was embarrassed
[29:10] to see who was challenging him he felt
[29:13] he was so powerful
[29:14] because of his position but one's truth
[29:18] speaks to power or position
[29:21] truth will prevail
[29:26] oh hallelujah glory to god
[29:30] that is what we need you shall know the
[29:33] truth
[29:35] and the truth shall set you free
[29:38] [Applause]
[29:46] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[29:50] you may be seated i remember reading
[29:53] something but abandoned said
[29:55] he was telling somebody the truth about
[29:57] their life and so on
[29:59] and when it came out they got free they
[30:02] got healed
[30:03] he said because the truth is what sets
[30:05] you free
[30:06] i'm not talking about the freedom that
[30:08] the devil come and take you back
[30:10] i'm talking about the freedom that jesus
[30:12] said who the son of man
[30:14] set free is free indeed
[30:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[30:26] you might be seated praise god the devil
[30:30] didn't believe israel was free when
[30:32] moses took them out you may be seated
[30:35] the devil thought pharaoh thought the
[30:38] people still belong to him
[30:41] pharaoh taught that and many times the
[30:43] devil think that he you still belong to
[30:45] him
[30:46] so he see you as a runaway slave to
[30:49] bring you back in
[30:50] so when pharaoh saw those people going
[30:52] out he couldn't take it anymore
[30:55] he said let's go after them but god
[30:57] wanted that battle
[30:59] god wanted that devil to come after
[31:02] because god wanted to prove
[31:05] he's the same yesterday of the ever and
[31:08] i
[31:08] feel tonight that god wants to prove
[31:11] hallelujah that he is with this bride
[31:18] go away hallelujah you may be seated
[31:22] not because he is silent he doesn't hear
[31:25] not because god is silent he's not
[31:28] watching and looking
[31:29] don't misinterpret god's silence
[31:32] brother branham said when god is silent
[31:36] that's the hour to be certain of god
[31:39] when you pray and god doesn't answer
[31:43] that's the very hour to be certain of
[31:46] god and in this hour we are certain

[42:24] so the body must follow him back to eden
[42:28] where the head of the family the man the
[42:30] bridegroom the bride
[42:32] being the body of the bridegroom must
[42:35] follow the bridegroom
[42:36] because that's the head and when the
[42:39] head is revealed
[42:40] and come back with eternal life the body
[42:43] must follow that
[42:44] because it's husband and wife again as

[43:58] i'm reading we call it dead dong
[44:04] that is filled no holy father
[44:09] no holy denomination no only man
[44:13] no only pope if an angel comes from
[44:16] heaven
[44:17] we're going to smoke him out if he don't

[45:12] adam fell and he booked
[45:16] left his hands
[45:20] the book was sealed
[45:24] all creation is groaning
[45:27] because when adam fell
[45:30] the earth fell creation fell
[45:34] oh hallelujah so we fell down
[45:38] but when the lamb took the book
[45:41] it means that we are going to be
[45:43] restored when the lamb
[45:46] took the book it means that son's
[45:48] getting back
[45:49] the bible said when the lamb took the
[45:51] book they sang a new song
[45:55] not the same old song a new song and the
[46:00] song was

[46:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:51] god said let us make man
[46:55] in our image and let that man
[46:58] have dominion so the image is connected
[47:01] to the book
[47:02] that's why the book was sealed the image

[48:27] you may be seated so god's
[48:30] original intent was for man to have
[48:34] dominion
[48:35] over the fish over the beast and brother
[48:39] branham came and demonstrate
[48:41] what god was talking about therefore he
[48:43] had to confront the bull
[48:45] to show there is power over peace

[48:51] power over the beast there is power in
[48:54] the blood

[49:52] and place it in the promised land so
[49:55] they could enter
[49:56] and all the enemies can be drove out
[50:02] god is not interested

[50:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:39] we are more than conquerors god has put
[50:42] all things
[50:44] under our feet hallelujah
[50:47] the glory to god amen you might be
[50:49] seated praise god
[50:51] you may be seated brother ibrahim
[50:54] manasseh can't take islam
[50:58] how are you going to act manaser won't
[51:01] keep us ground
[51:02] ephraim won't keep his ground god won't
[51:04] keep his ground
[51:06] when god blessed him somebody call him
[51:07] on the one and say you know what
[51:08] happened
[51:09] you should preach so and so and so and
[51:10] he said i want to know if i should
[51:11] preach that
[51:12] and what because he connected horizontal
[51:17] somebody sent him an email somebody sent
[51:19] him a text god he sent a text
[51:27] horizontal is man volatile is god
[51:31] when the elohim drop upon peter jesus
[51:33] said flesh and blood
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:49] so watch watch benjamin won't keep his
[51:53] ground
[51:54] they all run out here but the
[51:55] philistines all mixed up
[51:57] how are we going to be pleased
[52:01] we but we have been born by the holy
[52:03] ghost
[52:04] all of us is that right what are we born
[52:07] to
[52:08] watch we are predestinated here we go
[52:12] then after being born we are
[52:15] predestinated into the adoption
[52:18] watch to be pleased in the body of
[52:21] christ
[52:23] after you are born you may be seated all
[52:26] right
[52:27] so before jesus
[52:30] came forth as a manifested son
[52:34] after he was filled with the holy ghost
[52:38] he was led by the spirit
[52:42] into the wilderness to overcome
[52:47] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[52:50] flesh
[52:51] and the pride of the earth the pride of
[52:54] life
[52:55] so jesus had to reign
[52:59] over his earth over his tongue
[53:03] over his flesh over his eyes
[53:07] over his desires over himself
[53:11] he conquered he conquered himself
[53:15] and was then ready to move on
[53:18] in the adoption ministry now the
[53:21] easier one is to rule a man like pope
[53:25] or mr francis or or like some president
[53:30] or so that's the easy part and we have
[53:32] these
[53:33] message popes who want to reign over
[53:36] people
[53:37] reign over others and they have no power
[53:39] over themselves
[53:41] but before jesus was sent out
[53:44] into the adoption ministry he had us to
[53:47] prove
[53:48] he had power over himself isn't that
[53:51] right
[53:52] because first john 2 said all that is in
[53:55] the world
[53:56] the lusts of the flesh the loss of the
[53:58] eyes
[53:59] and the pride of the life is not of the
[54:01] father
[54:02] but of the world so all that is in the
[54:05] world
[54:06] is either under the lust of the flesh or
[54:08] the lust of the eyes
[54:09] or the pride of life that is why the
[54:12] devil told
[54:12] eve hallelujah that tree is good when
[54:15] she saw the good
[54:16] she will see the tree she look at her
[54:18] eyes then the devil says good for food
[54:21] then he said gonna make your wise so
[54:23] since in the garden of eden
[54:24] it was introduced the lust of the eyes
[54:27] the lust of the flesh
[54:28] and the pride of life and once we could
[54:30] handle that
[54:32] and to put that under our feet we have
[54:35] overcome
[54:36] okay the lord i shout oh
[54:40] hallelujah are you with me this morning
[54:43] this evening
[54:45] may be seated adoption by the man what
[54:47] is everything waiting for
[54:49] what is the whole creation waiting for
[54:51] the manifestation of the sons of god
[54:53] it is waiting for the church to come in
[54:56] position
[54:58] oh hallelujah so now he's talking
[55:00] something different now
[55:01] it's not waiting for church we have
[55:03] thousands
[55:05] it waiting for the church to come in
[55:09] position that's different that that's
[55:11] different you may be caesar
[55:13] that's that's different that's it from
[55:15] jesus
[55:16] from he's 12 to 18
[55:19] or 18 to 30 18 years it took jesus to
[55:23] write
[55:24] that seed and when he was right he
[55:27] went in the scriptures to find out his
[55:30] position
[55:31] in his isa 61 and went in the temple to
[55:35] read
[55:35] the spirit is upon me he was taking it
[55:38] present tense
[55:39] and bringing the word alive to himself
[55:42] he was anointing the promise to himself

[1:00:16] cancer is a two take to what's coming
[1:00:18] but remember the horrible thing was
[1:00:20] forbidden in that day
[1:00:21] to touch those who are the seal of god
[1:00:25] and that's what we are striving for now
[1:00:27] to get in
[1:00:28] one and be positionally
[1:00:32] placed now remember redemption is in two
[1:00:35] parts
[1:00:36] coming out of and going into if you only
[1:00:40] come out that's one part it's two parts
[1:00:43] you need the two parts for it to be
[1:00:45] completed
[1:00:46] but i have a word for you the bible said
[1:00:49] it said when the lamb took the book
[1:00:51] it says hando has redeemed us
[1:00:54] by thy blood so that means we're gonna
[1:00:57] get you the two parts
[1:00:58] we're gonna come out and you're gonna go
[1:01:00] into do you believe that
[1:01:03] that you ordained to go into into what
[1:01:05] the land of promise
[1:01:07] the holy ghost land oh hallelujah
[1:01:10] so we are striving to get in and be
[1:01:13] positionally placed
[1:01:15] into the kingdom of god before these
[1:01:17] plagues strike
[1:01:19] inheritance you said jesus left your
[1:01:21] inheritance
[1:01:22] he said beg your pardon jesus never left
[1:01:24] the inheritance
[1:01:25] jesus never left you inheritance he only
[1:01:27] came down
[1:01:28] and paid for inheritance brought you to
[1:01:31] your inheritance
[1:01:32] your name was put in the lamb's book of
[1:01:34] life and god give you an inheritance
[1:01:37] your inheritance was first your
[1:01:39] inheritance was
[1:01:40] what your inheritance was first
[1:01:43] what inheritance did i have i didn't
[1:01:46] have any
[1:01:47] but god left me an inheritance and put
[1:01:49] my name on the lamb's book of life
[1:01:52] and god sent jesus to make that
[1:01:55] inheritance
[1:01:56] real to me because there was nothing i
[1:01:59] could do to inherit it
[1:02:00] it was blank but in the fullness of time
[1:02:03] god sent his own good time jesus the
[1:02:06] lamb
[1:02:07] slain from the foundational world the
[1:02:10] blood was shed
[1:02:11] that i might go to my inheritance
[1:02:15] so the blood was shed not for you to say
[1:02:18] i am saved
[1:02:19] thank you lord i'm saved no a little
[1:02:21] more than that
[1:02:22] the blood was shed for you to go to
[1:02:25] inheritance
[1:02:26] what inheritance to sonship
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:30] to be a son of god
[1:02:34] you may be seated oh hallelujah
[1:02:37] you mean my inheritance is sonship yes
[1:02:40] what kind of stunt chip the kind that
[1:02:42] adam had
[1:02:43] before the fall oh i'm not hearing you
[1:02:46] tonight that is what we are talking
[1:02:48] about
[1:02:49] going back to dominion going back not
[1:02:53] for this to conquer you and that conquer
[1:02:54] you know
[1:02:55] you put all things under your feet oh
[1:02:58] glory to god
[1:02:59] your sons are gonna have power god
[1:03:02] promised you power
[1:03:04] brother oh my we are waiting for the
[1:03:06] manifestation
[1:03:07] of the sons of god who will come back
[1:03:09] and take it over
[1:03:11] waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:03:13] the pyramid gets to the top
[1:03:15] when the full sons of god will be
[1:03:16] manifested when the power of god will
[1:03:18] walk out hallelujah will take
[1:03:20] every power that satan got away from him
[1:03:22] it belongs to god
[1:03:24] isn't that right oh glory to god so this
[1:03:27] book
[1:03:28] is connected to all inheritance and that
[1:03:30] is why when the lamb took the book
[1:03:32] it said we shall reign on the earth now
[1:03:35] terrain is to rule
[1:03:37] to conquer to dominate to have dominion
[1:03:40] over

[1:03:43] authority
[1:03:44] it is dominance it is domination
[1:03:47] hallelujah it is preeminence hallelujah

[1:10:40] glory praise god
[1:10:43] let me say this to you elijah
[1:10:47] when he came down to the river he took
[1:10:49] his mantra
[1:10:50] and he struck the jordan river he didn't
[1:10:53] even talk
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:10:59] he didn't have to talk when he strike
[1:11:02] the river
[1:11:02] do you even know what to do
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:10] notice we could strike the water
[1:11:14] and open it up but when jesus come he
[1:11:17] decides he don't
[1:11:18] want to open it up he's going to walk on

[1:11:50] hallelujah now remember the
[1:11:54] destination is not heaven that's just
[1:11:56] past of the itinerary
[1:11:58] but god created it and placed man on
[1:12:01] this earth
[1:12:02] right now putin and obama and all them
[1:12:05] only temporary
[1:12:06] holding the position but we shall reign
[1:12:09] on the earth
[1:12:10] and the meek shall inherit the earth
[1:12:12] they can't stop us
[1:12:14] right now this is the satan's eden but
[1:12:16] we are coming back to take over
[1:12:18] but before we leave before we leave
[1:12:21] there'll be one blast
[1:12:23] there'll be one demonstration of what
[1:12:26] the power was supposed to be
[1:12:28] in the garden of eden there'll be one
[1:12:31] more ride
[1:12:32] oh glory glory
[1:12:36] glory glory to god
[1:12:39] when brother branham was alive
[1:12:42] they couldn't bring that foolishness
[1:12:44] they couldn't bring all the half the
[1:12:46] nonsense they have today
[1:12:47] because the prophet know the secret of
[1:12:49] the heart he could see through them from
[1:12:51] afar
[1:12:52] he knew all the tricks in the books god
[1:12:54] gave him visions and everything else
[1:12:56] but guess what the spirit of elijah is
[1:12:59] coming right back
[1:13:00] to rest upon elisha guess what there'll
[1:13:03] be another
[1:13:04] acts four guess what there'd be another
[1:13:06] acts 2.
[1:13:07] guess what they've been another acts 5
[1:13:10] guess what
[1:13:11] the pillar of fire going to dwell in the
[1:13:14] sons of god in the last days
[1:13:21] who's going to stop it nobody could stop
[1:13:24] it
[1:13:25] hallelujah do you understand that the
[1:13:28] conqueror woman that caterpillar
[1:13:30] and the palm will eat down that tree and
[1:13:33] it's not man trying to restore
[1:13:35] god said i
[1:13:38] ah somebody's here god said i
[1:13:42] will restore unto you
[1:13:47] oh give the lord a praise give the lord
[1:13:50] a
[1:13:51] shout god set
[1:13:54] i oh glory hallelujah
[1:13:59] will restore unto you all the years
[1:14:03] you missed out all the years did they
[1:14:06] ever mess with your mind
[1:14:07] one of these days go go take the key up
[1:14:11] and think brought back your
[1:14:12] understanding god gonna bring back your
[1:14:14] right
[1:14:15] mind right now you have amnesia but god
[1:14:18] is bringing it right back
[1:14:19] because when the lamb took the book it
[1:14:21] wasn't for the lamb
[1:14:23] no the lamb took the pork it was for his
[1:14:26] wife
[1:14:27] that's why the mighty angel came along
[1:14:29] with the book open
[1:14:30] not closed but open
[1:14:33] and by the random evidence of the open
[1:14:36] book
[1:14:37] when he said little fishy i give you
[1:14:39] back
[1:14:40] your life that was an adamic son
[1:14:43] that was a son back in the garden of
[1:14:46] eden again
[1:14:47] vindicating the power that gonna be in
[1:14:49] the last day church
[1:14:51] little fishy i'll give you back your
[1:14:54] life
[1:14:55] and when the storm was coming that
[1:14:57] prophet said son come out and shine four
[1:14:58] days
[1:14:59] that was power over the elements that
[1:15:02] was joshua
[1:15:03] saying son stand still that's what the
[1:15:05] sun supposed to do
[1:15:07] speak and the word is created just like
[1:15:09] that

[1:19:01] word
[1:19:02] so there have to be no condemnation
[1:19:09] hallelujah oh glory so then from a group
[1:19:13] of the true seed of the word god
[1:19:15] represent christ a beloved bride
[1:19:17] watch a virgin a version to his word
[1:19:21] that means no man's interpretation so no
[1:19:24] man can come and see his fivefold
[1:19:25] which fall is that it has fall and fall
[1:19:28] which pole is that
[1:19:29] it take dynamics to produce a five-fold
[1:19:32] save the dynamics and strike yet there's
[1:19:35] a fight for ministry yet
[1:19:37] you can't take out yet
[1:19:40] no man have the authority to take out
[1:19:42] yet
[1:19:43] that's a false authority dynamics have
[1:19:46] to strike the bride
[1:19:47] i want the dynamics strike the bride
[1:19:49] then sons position only place
[1:19:52] then they have to be tested or
[1:19:55] i thought i read no you know start
[1:20:02] these virtues have to be living and
[1:20:05] tested
[1:20:06] you can't tell me the living is only the
[1:20:08] test well proof of it living on it
[1:20:11] and i have news for you but i'm saying
[1:20:13] that devil make it prove it
[1:20:15] not brother of it you could pass by
[1:20:19] it's you and the devil oh hell you don't
[1:20:21] want to see him into that one
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:24] i didn't say that that's the word you
[1:20:26] know the devil will make you prove it
[1:20:29] that's why i'm fighting for every inch
[1:20:31] yes yes yes
[1:20:33] i'm not gonna sit back if i have to die
[1:20:35] i have a crook stick up here i'm gonna
[1:20:36] hold a cook stick here
[1:20:38] if i lose my teeth i'll use my gums but
[1:20:40] i'm gonna fight
[1:20:41] every way hallelujah
[1:20:45] are you with me because there is going
[1:20:47] to be revival in this land
[1:20:49] oh hallelujah praise god through them
[1:20:54] and by them will be fulfilled
[1:20:57] all that was promised to them
[1:21:01] by them what a church i could feel it
[1:21:06] i could sense it how i could sense it
[1:21:09] what a people a royal priesthood
[1:21:12] a holy nation a peculiar people
[1:21:15] oh glory to god be one of them
[1:21:19] oh hallelujah i love this part
[1:21:22] notice the harmony jesus never did
[1:21:25] anything until the father shamed first
[1:21:27] he can do nothing and the bride will do
[1:21:29] nothing until you have thus said the
[1:21:31] lord
[1:21:32] oh hallelujah if they leave the church
[1:21:35] they went out from us
[1:21:36] because they were not of us so therefore
[1:21:39] there is no thunders without dying
[1:21:41] but i've not thunders without death i
[1:21:43] hear people preaching all kind of gospel
[1:21:45] there's no death in it
[1:21:46] there's no killing i just listen for
[1:21:47] that you know because i know i see it
[1:21:49] after going on the ground
[1:21:51] somebody mistakes something you see it
[1:21:53] said he taught
[1:21:54] i was a stone or a rock he didn't was a
[1:21:56] seed and he buried me
[1:21:58] that's the wrong thing to do i see him
[1:22:00] because once you bury it it will come
[1:22:02] forward
[1:22:03] so therefore this gospel has to come
[1:22:05] with that okay let me close
[1:22:08] god made man but obama said to
[1:22:10] predominate over the earth
[1:22:12] he had dominion he said in genesis when
[1:22:14] he make man he said i am yahweh
[1:22:16] javier jehovah what did it mean
[1:22:20] it mean i am the all-existent one who
[1:22:23] has created something or for myself
[1:22:25] to be a son of mine a temporary or an
[1:22:28] amateur
[1:22:29] little one of me so god was the reign
[1:22:32] over heaven
[1:22:33] and the sons reign on earth that was
[1:22:36] god's original
[1:22:37] intent but because of the fall with the
[1:22:40] introduction of the lust of the eyes the
[1:22:41] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:22:43] and eve take up that tree we went
[1:22:45] through a process
[1:22:46] and god made the whole cycle must be
[1:22:48] born again get to the book the book
[1:22:50] reveal your name
[1:22:51] you go to the process bring it to
[1:22:53] positionally placed tested virtual image
[1:22:55] come right back
[1:22:56] to the image of god you're back to eden
[1:22:59] on the earth and the devil is confused
[1:23:05] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:23:08] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to the
[1:23:12] lord
[1:23:12] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:23:15] praise god praise god praise god
[1:23:18] finally what about him said this great
[1:23:21] outpouring of god's spirit in the last
[1:23:22] days
[1:23:23] that's the thing to bring faith into the
[1:23:26] people
[1:23:26] that will take a rapture and fate that
[1:23:28] will take the church into glory
[1:23:31] and he said the church have to be
[1:23:32] rebuilt in the power of the spirit
[1:23:35] and the final quote i'm going to read
[1:23:37] he's talking about feasts of the
[1:23:38] trumpets
[1:23:39] he said this group here they've got two
[1:23:41] thousand bang on the river euphrates
[1:23:42] has been born for two thousand years the
[1:23:45] church has burned the holy ghost
[1:23:47] for nearly two thousand years under
[1:23:49] martyrdom
[1:23:50] but the whole the holy spirit can't work
[1:23:53] in the church
[1:23:54] because of man-made systems but she is
[1:23:56] going to be liberated
[1:23:57] she is coming back the evening type
[1:24:00] message
[1:24:00] liberates the holy ghost god couldn't
[1:24:03] release the holy ghost as spirit
[1:24:04] because he wasn't ready for it yet so he
[1:24:06] released the holy ghost
[1:24:07] in the form of promises that by these
[1:24:10] promises
[1:24:11] you can become partakers of his divine
[1:24:13] nature
[1:24:14] to come back in god's image to come back
[1:24:16] to dominion
[1:24:17] may the lord bless you
[1:24:32] [Applause]
