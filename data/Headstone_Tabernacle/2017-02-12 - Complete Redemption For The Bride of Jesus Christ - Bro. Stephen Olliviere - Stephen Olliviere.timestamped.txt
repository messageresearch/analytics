[13:43] [Music]
[13:52] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[13:56] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[14:00] Let us bow heads with a prayer. Heavenly
[14:02] Father, we thank you for the love that
[14:03] we feel and for your presence this
[14:05] morning. And we invite you to have the
[14:08] preeminences.
[14:10] We surrender our hearts, our minds, our
[14:13] spirits, our souls, our body to you for
[14:17] your glory. Father, Father, may you
[14:21] place upon us your motive, your
[14:23] objective, your desires that we could
[14:26] fulfill your desire even as Jesus taught
[14:28] the disciples to pray.
[14:30] Lord, thy kingdom come, thy will be
[14:34] done. Father, may we have an interest in
[14:36] your will being done. May we walk in the
[14:40] path of righteousness and so fulfill
[14:42] righteousness. Even as the scripture
[14:44] says, it behooves us to fulfill all
[14:46] righteousness. You took our place, Lord.
[14:49] Help us this morning that we could take
[14:51] yours and walk on this highway of
[14:54] holiness, this highway to heaven,
[14:56] Father, where the redeemed going to be
[14:58] at. Lord, help us that by your word that
[15:01] we can realize that this earth is
[15:04] temporary. Our lives here is temporary
[15:07] and whatever we do for the kingdom of
[15:09] God, that is what counts. So Lord, as we
[15:12] gather together in this this precious
[15:15] time, Lord, may we truly wait on you and
[15:18] may you speak to our hearts. Just one
[15:20] word from you would make such a
[15:22] difference. We invite you to anoint
[15:25] every every part of this service Lord
[15:27] and the speaker that will come. May you
[15:29] so inspire him to speak spirit spoken
[15:32] words. We love you and we adore you and
[15:35] we appreciate you and we give you on the
[15:38] glory in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. You
[15:41] may be seated. Well, welcome to our
[15:43] Sunday morning service. Welcome
[15:46] to the presence of God.
[15:47] Amen.
[15:48] I truly believe that we're in God's
[15:49] presence and I believe anything can
[15:51] happen.
[15:51] Amen. I believe we're in a supernatural
[15:53] time and a supernatural season, you're
[15:55] going to see the mighty hand of God move
[15:58] in a mighty, mighty, mighty way.
[16:00] Are you on expectation for that?
[16:03] Praise the name of the Lord. We want to
[16:04] welcome uh
[16:07] Steven Thompson, could you stand? He
[16:09] asked to make his home church. God bless
[16:11] you. Welcome. God bless you. He's his
[16:13] wife here, his family going to be
[16:14] fellowship with us. God bless you and
[16:17] welcome. So, brother Steven Oliver going
[16:19] to bless us this morning and share the
[16:21] word with us this morning.
[16:23] We happy to have him and he's special.
[16:27] But I like it before he comes one of our
[16:29] scripture like you to stand and read for
[16:30] us this morning. Isaiah chapter 43.
[16:34] I want to read from verse one
[16:40] and we're going to read 1 to8.
[16:44] Strange. I stumbled into the scripture
[16:46] this morning. this grateful to God.
[16:50] Isaiah 43. See,
[16:53] but now thus sayeth the Lord that
[16:55] created thee, oh Jacob, and he that
[16:58] formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I
[17:00] have redeemed thee. I have called thee
[17:03] by thy name, thou art mine. When thou
[17:06] passest through the waters, I be with
[17:09] thee. And through the rivers, they shall
[17:11] not overflow thee. When thou walst
[17:13] through the fire, thou shalt not be
[17:15] burned, neither shall the flame kindle
[17:18] upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God,
[17:22] the holy one of Israel, thy savior. I
[17:24] give Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopian sa
[17:28] for thee. Since thou was precious in my
[17:31] sight, thou has been honorable, and I
[17:34] have loved thee. Therefore will I give
[17:37] men for thee, and people for thy life.
[17:39] Fear not, for I am with thee. I will
[17:42] bring thy seed from the east and gather
[17:44] thee from the west. I will say to the
[17:47] north, give up. And to the south, keep
[17:49] not back. Bring my sons from far and my
[17:52] daughters from the ends of the earth.
[17:54] Even everyone that is called by my name,
[17:57] for I have created him for my glory. I
[18:00] have formed him. Yay, I have made him.
[18:02] Bring forth the blind people that have
[18:04] eyes and the deaf that have ears. May
[18:06] God bless his word. Give the Lord some
[18:09] praises. That scripture is so anointed.
[18:11] You may be seated. Praise God.
[18:14] Hallelujah.
[18:15] Man, I feel like saying hallelujah.
[18:18] Bring forth my sons and daughters from
[18:21] the east, from the west, from the north,
[18:24] from the south. Bring them out. They
[18:26] have to come out.
[18:27] Hallelujah. They have to give them up.
[18:31] Satan can't hold you back any longer.
[18:32] You have to give up. Bring out my sons.
[18:35] Bring on my daughters. I have redeemed
[18:37] thee.
[18:39] Oh, hallelujah. The redeemer is here.
[18:43] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[18:48] Thank you, Jesus.
[18:50] Oh, glory.
[18:52] And something was burning upon me this
[18:53] morning
[18:56] about the glory of God.
[19:00] And listen to what God said here in
[19:02] verse 7. even everyone that is called by
[19:06] my name, for I have created him for my
[19:09] glory.
[19:12] God is not here to give you things.
[19:16] He's not a tool to be used.
[19:19] There's not a motive of objective for
[19:22] your life.
[19:24] You're not here to come and use God. Oh,
[19:27] they come here to understand his
[19:28] purpose.
[19:30] That you were created for his glory.
[19:33] Not you for his pledge, you for his
[19:35] glory.
[19:37] So whatever with glory to his name, that
[19:39] is what you are there for.
[19:41] You want to surrender to God. God is not
[19:44] Santa Claus. He's not coming with a big
[19:47] bag of toys,
[19:49] some through the waters,
[19:51] some through the flood,
[19:53] some through great trials,
[19:55] but all for his glory.
[19:59] Hallelujah.
[20:01] Hallelujah.
[20:03] And if this morning you catch that
[20:05] revelation, your whole purpose of life
[20:07] will change.
[20:08] God's purpose to give you a new dress, a
[20:11] new car, a new house, a husband, a a
[20:15] child. Go after the God purpose. Child
[20:18] or no child, husband or no husband, car
[20:20] or no car, whether I maintain my family
[20:23] or not, let me maintain Christ.
[20:31] Hallelujah.
[20:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[20:36] Hallelujah.
[20:37] God is not obligated to give you no
[20:39] natural thing. He is obligated to bring
[20:42] you forth for his honor, for his glory.
[20:46] He brought Noah in his season. An
[20:49] ordinary man. But Noah was there for the
[20:51] glory of God. And Noah was God's witness
[20:54] on the earth. So was Daniel. So was
[20:57] Jeffi. So was Samson. So was David. Who
[21:01] are you living for? What are you living
[21:03] for? Are you living for yourself? Are
[21:05] you living for God's honor and God's
[21:08] glory? I challenge you this morning.
[21:12] [Applause]
[21:15] I'm almost done. Hallelujah.
[21:19] [Applause]
[21:21] So what you do,
[21:24] how you talk,
[21:26] how you walk, how you act,
[21:29] question does it bring glory to God
[21:33] or honor to God
[21:35] or you are just honoring your own
[21:37] stinking rotten selfish self.
[21:42] Everybody lives going to be changed if
[21:44] they take this to heart.
[21:51] I serve him because I love him.
[21:53] When he send me to hell, I still love
[21:55] him.
[21:56] I'm not trying to escape hell. Though he
[21:58] slay me, that's a son talking. Can I
[22:01] trust him? That's a son talking. The
[22:03] Lord gave. That's a son talking. The
[22:05] Lord give it away. That's another son.
[22:07] That's a son talking. Blessed be the
[22:09] name of the Lord.
[22:11] [Applause]
[22:17] I got to make it.
[22:20] Got to make it.
[22:21] When I have to go up the down the valley
[22:23] or down the valley, up the mountain, I
[22:25] just got to make it.
[22:26] Whether the trials go hot, I got to make
[22:28] it. I have got to go over there. I've
[22:31] got to get there
[22:33] somehow. I got to get there. If I have
[22:36] to keep my hair bone dry, I got to get
[22:38] there. You have to burn me knees. I got
[22:41] to get there. If God destroyed me
[22:43] completely, I've got to get there.
[22:46] I'm not hearing you this morning. We are
[22:49] in church. We are in church. Whether you
[22:52] lose your house and it burned down, I've
[22:53] got to get there.
[22:56] [Applause]
[23:03] Glory.
[23:06] No excuses.
[23:08] It's sickening when you hear people
[23:10] blame this one. Blame that one. and
[23:12] always blaming somebody for your rotten
[23:14] attitude and condition and behavior.
[23:16] Stop it. Cut it out.
[23:28] Die for your husband. Die for your wife.
[23:30] Die for your children. Die for your
[23:31] family. You die.
[23:33] You grown.
[23:35] Don't care what they do. Cry out for
[23:36] them
[23:37] because you can't help them.
[23:39] You can't change a heart. You can't
[23:41] drink some kind of cereal and that go
[23:43] change the heart. Go and put cereal to
[23:46] change heart and drink some coke and you
[23:48] drink change the heart. And give
[23:50] somebody some some some chocolate and it
[23:51] change the heart. Some Valentine thing
[23:53] change your heart. If the hearts are
[23:54] good, the heart are good.
[23:56] If the spirit are good, the spirit of
[23:58] God that's why man said appeal somebody
[24:01] right in their spirit and wrong in their
[24:04] doctrine than somebody right in their
[24:06] doctrine and wrong in their spirit.
[24:10] Because a right spirit, you could
[24:11] correct the doctrine. But a wrong
[24:13] spirit, heaven help them.
[24:17] And a right spirit could take
[24:19] correction, instruction, rebuke,
[24:21] respect. That's a right spirit.
[24:25] [Applause]
[24:27] A religious spirit is judgmental.
[24:30] This one wrong, that one, wrong, that
[24:31] fault, that fault. All seem fault
[24:32] because they're right. That's a
[24:34] religious spirit. You have to repent of
[24:35] a religious spirit. Get off for you. A
[24:38] religious spirit, a person will fight
[24:39] the husband because they they feel
[24:41] they're right.
[24:43] A person will fight their wife because
[24:44] they feel they're right.
[24:45] They will destroy the family because
[24:47] they serve God
[24:51] cuz you feel right. You call that
[24:53] selfrighteous.
[24:55] You're righteous in your own eyes.
[24:58] But in the eyes of God, you're filthy
[25:00] and wretched. And you know what part?
[25:01] Don't even know it.
[25:05] Amen.
[25:09] Amen.
[25:13] But Brandham said
[25:16] the individual Christian hear this bum
[25:19] represent the kingdom of God.
[25:25] That's how you supposed to be.
[25:27] That's how we supposed to live
[25:28] as represent representative of the
[25:32] kingdom. Amen.
[25:34] So if you are a representative of the
[25:38] kingdom, what kind of life you living?
[25:41] Somebody who want to come to your
[25:42] kingdom.
[25:44] That's why we supposed to be so salty.
[25:47] Yes, sir.
[25:47] We supposed to be salty that it makes
[25:49] the world thirsty.
[25:52] We have one life to live.
[25:55] Press away.
[25:59] [Applause]
[26:02] This is such a beautiful scripture
[26:04] and I just got it. That's what was
[26:07] amazing to me. I just got this
[26:10] scripture. Everybody, Stephen, I just
[26:11] get this thing. All I wanted to get
[26:14] something about the glory of God. I've
[26:16] created him for my glory.
[26:19] Because too many people feel God is like
[26:20] a a talisman, a kind of a good luck
[26:23] charm. So you you get God or you get a
[26:27] piece of God that like to keep put in
[26:30] your pocket to give you good luck.
[26:33] You say a prayer for good luck. You wear
[26:36] a chain with a pendant, a special
[26:37] pendant for good luck. So God come like
[26:40] a good luck charm. You put him in when
[26:42] you want him. When you want to use him,
[26:44] you stick him in.
[26:46] But he's not there for that.
[26:48] If you get a conversation with him, he
[26:50] tell you I am not there for that. You
[26:52] are
[26:53] for my glory.
[26:55] That's why the two boys could go in the
[26:57] fiery furnace. That's why Joseph could
[26:59] be sold into Egypt and God horrors with
[27:02] that. That's why God could wait on Moses
[27:04] for 40 years
[27:05] in the wilderness and still send him an
[27:07] old man back there. That's why Joshua
[27:09] could survive 40 years of unbelief, dead
[27:12] men dropping down and Joshua could make
[27:14] it the way he made it.
[27:19] So I want to encourage you this morning.
[27:21] I want you to see your life a little
[27:22] different.
[27:23] That your life is to live for God's
[27:26] honor and God's glory.
[27:28] God put in a job for his honor and his
[27:31] glory.
[27:32] God move your neighbor for his honor and
[27:33] his glory. He slammed the door open that
[27:36] you could be blessed.
[27:38] But usually when people get blessed,
[27:39] they give up on God. They walk away
[27:40] because they feel self-sufficient.
[27:43] They feel so empowered. They no longer
[27:46] need him.
[27:47] But David, boy, David has blew me out.
[27:50] David said, "My God has the heart pan
[27:52] after the water brook." This is King
[27:54] David. This is a man with money. This is
[27:56] a man with wealth. This is a man with
[27:58] all kind of things. And David still
[27:59] hungering and thirsting for God. God
[28:02] grant the day that that is not taken out
[28:04] of your heart. Praise God. So we want a
[28:06] song a trumpet. We want to blow a
[28:08] trumpet in Zion. We want to song a lamb
[28:10] in his holy mountain. We want to call a
[28:12] day on prayer and fasting on Wednesday.
[28:14] Praise God. I challenge you to take
[28:16] Wednesday off. Praise God. not off your
[28:18] job, but to turn on the pot and make a
[28:20] sacrifice and call upon the name of the
[28:22] Lord this coming Wednesday to seek the
[28:24] Lord and say, "God, while you're on your
[28:26] job or not, you're talking to the God
[28:27] and you're asking for extra mercy, extra
[28:29] grace." Listen, we have to turn up the
[28:31] heat under the devil and you have to
[28:32] turn on the heat under your life. You
[28:34] You are too comfortable. You understand?
[28:37] You're fighting a loud Easter spirit.
[28:39] You're fighting a lethargic spirit.
[28:41] You're fighting a lazy spirit. You have
[28:43] to You almost had to push people. But
[28:45] but but but but John said the word said
[28:48] amen say h the kingdom of God is
[28:50] preached and every man pressed away. I'm
[28:52] sorry. I can't help you. You have to
[28:54] press
[28:57] your way.
[29:00] Not some men.
[29:02] Every man. So So help me push this
[29:05] morning. Just just turn to somebody next
[29:07] to you and say press your way. Just just
[29:09] tell somebody press your way. You got to
[29:11] press. Nobody pushing from behind. You
[29:14] got to press. Press for your children.

[29:19] wife. The devil is after her. Press for
[29:21] your husband. The devil is after him.
[29:24] Press for your family. The devil is
[29:26] after them. Press for your own soul.
[29:35] Okay. So, we see we're going to come on
[29:36] now. Just two more minutes. I want to
[29:38] bring your attention to something here
[29:39] in this very scripture. God said, "But
[29:42] now thus say the Lord that created thee,
[29:44] oh Jacob, and he that formed thee, oh
[29:46] Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed
[29:49] thee."
[29:50] He said, "Finish already."
[29:52] Devil is a liar.
[29:54] Finish already.
[29:55] Whatever you're going to go through, he
[29:57] has already redeemed.
[29:59] Finish work.
[30:01] Finish.
[30:03] Finish.
[30:05] Finish.
[30:06] I have redeemed thee.
[30:09] May the Lord bless you. As brother

[32:34] wonderful name of the Lord and Savior
[32:36] Jesus Christ.

[33:09] officers, all the helps and the
[33:11] governments. Amen. We salute you this
[33:14] morning in the name of Jesus.
[33:16] Praise God.
[33:18] Thank you from the bottom of my heart
[33:21] for all that you do for the church and
[33:23] more importantly for the kingdom of God.
[33:27] Amen. God will reward your labors of
[33:29] love this morning. Praise God. Amen.
[33:33] Amen. I also want to personally thank
[33:36] God for the last two messages.
[33:39] Amen. From the right kind of son.
[33:43] What a blessing. Amen. Can you say amen?
[33:47] Amen. And for Isaac, travail in Zion.
[33:51] That's what a bride going to be doing.
[33:53] Amen. Travailing. What a word in due
[33:56] season. Oh, how excellent it is.
[33:59] Amen. Thank you, brothers. Amen. So,
[34:02] let's all stand as we go to our Bibles
[34:05] this morning.
[34:07] Thank you, musicians.
[34:09] Three portions of scripture.
[34:13] Romans chapter 8 verse 23.
[34:17] Ephesians chapter 1
[34:20] and Ephesians chapter 4.
[34:26] Amen. Heavenly Father, we pray that you
[34:28] bless the word as we read it now and may
[34:30] it inspire our hearts as we feast upon
[34:33] it this time at this time in Jesus name.
[34:35] Amen.
[34:37] Romans chapter 8 23.
[34:43] And not only they but ourselves also
[34:47] which have the first fruits of the
[34:48] spirit.
[34:49] All right.
[34:50] Even we ourselves grow within ourselves
[34:53] waiting for the adoption to with the
[34:56] redemption of our body.
[34:58] Yes sir.
[34:59] In other words physical adoption is the
[35:02] redemption of our bodies.
[35:04] Amen.
[35:05] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 7.
[35:13] In whom we have redemption through his
[35:15] blood, the forgiveness of sins according
[35:19] to the riches of his grace.
[35:22] In whom he also trusted.
[35:25] After that he heard the word of truth,
[35:28] the gospel of your salvation. In whom
[35:31] also after that you believed, you were
[35:34] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,
[35:38] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[35:41] until
[35:43] the redemption of the purchased
[35:45] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[35:50] Amen.
[35:51] So he paid for you.
[35:54] You belong to him.
[35:56] You are his purchased possession this
[35:58] morning. Amen.
[36:00] Amen. Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30.
[36:09] Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[36:12] whereby you are sealed until
[36:16] the day of redemption.
[36:18] Amen.
[36:19] So there is a day
[36:21] of redemption.
[36:23] Full and complete redemption.
[36:26] Amen. Amen.
[36:27] Heavenly Father, bless the words of
[36:30] bread this evening this morning, Lord,
[36:31] and take me completely out of the way.
[36:33] And may you speak to your people in
[36:35] Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. You
[36:38] may be seated.
[36:40] Praise God.
[36:43] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise
[36:44] this morning.
[36:50] Praise God. So this morning, my title is
[36:53] complete redemption for the bride of
[36:55] Jesus Christ.
[36:57] And my inspiration this morning is
[36:59] Elohim wants fellowship.
[37:01] Hallelujah.
[37:03] Amen.
[37:04] Amen.
[37:05] You believe you were created for his
[37:07] glory.
[37:09] Hallelujah.
[37:11] Amen.
[37:13] So for background saints, before the
[37:15] beginning
[37:17] there was Elohim. Amen.
[37:20] I want you to see Elohim, the great
[37:22] selfexistent one,
[37:24] the fountain of infinity,
[37:27] the eternal one,
[37:29] all powerful,
[37:31] ever knowing spirit,
[37:33] no one greater than he was,
[37:36] no one to compare with him.
[37:39] Omnipotent,
[37:41] omnipresent,
[37:42] omnisient. Amen.
[37:45] There was Elohim covering all space and
[37:48] times
[37:50] moving upon the face of the waters.
[37:53] Amen. The earth void and without form.
[37:57] Amen. Just darkness upon the face of the
[37:59] deep.
[38:01] There is Elohim selfexisting.
[38:05] Yes, sir.
[38:05] Maybe for millions and billions of
[38:07] years.
[38:08] All by himself.
[38:11] Just hear his thoughts
[38:13] alone.
[38:15] Amen.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:16] Always was
[38:18] no beginning,
[38:19] no ending.
[38:21] He was eternal.
[38:23] Can we say amen?
[38:25] Amen.
[38:26] Amen.
[38:27] There was no sin,
[38:29] no devil,
[38:31] nothing negative,
[38:33] just eternity and perfection and perfect
[38:37] love
[38:38] all locked up inside of Elohim. Amen.
[38:41] My amen.
[38:42] He was not even God.
[38:44] Because there was no one to worship him.
[38:47] For God is an object of worship. Amen.
[38:51] Amen.
[38:52] But after a while, Elohim became
[38:55] lonesome.
[38:58] All this love locked up in him and no
[39:00] one to express it to.
[39:04] You see, love is something that must be
[39:06] shared.
[39:08] You can't have love all by yourself.
[39:10] You have to express it.
[39:13] You have to share it to others
[39:15] or else you will explode.
[39:17] Because love is too powerful a force
[39:20] to keep inside.
[39:22] Can you say amen?
[39:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:27] So Elohim with all this love,
[39:31] all this power,
[39:32] he want you to express it. Amen.
[39:35] He was tired of being all invisible and
[39:37] lonesome and mysterious.
[39:39] Amen.
[39:40] Glory to God.
[39:42] Can you say amen?
[39:43] Can you say amen?
[39:46] So Elohim existed alone. Just he had his
[39:49] thoughts.
[39:50] And these thoughts brought him great
[39:52] pleasure.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:55] These thoughts in Elohim's mind were
[39:57] eternal.
[39:59] I wonder what Elohim was thinking about.
[40:01] Amen.
[40:03] Let me say it this way. I wonder who
[40:05] Elohim was thinking about.
[40:07] Glory to God. Amen.
[40:10] Glory to God. Amen.
[40:12] Whatever it was.
[40:14] Or whoever it was on Elohim's mind.
[40:17] Those were eternal thoughts
[40:20] because Elohim is the eternal one
[40:22] and all of his thoughts are eternal.
[40:26] Give him praise this morning.
[40:28] Hallelujah.
[40:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:32] Amen.
[40:34] But we find out in Romans 8
[40:38] for whom he did forno,
[40:42] he also did predestinate.
[40:45] Can you say amen?
[40:46] Amen.
[40:48] That means that there are some people
[40:49] that Elohim knew before
[40:52] before the beginning.
[40:55] When all he had was his thoughts.
[40:58] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[41:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:02] So these people in Elohim's mind, let's
[41:06] call them the predestinated ones.
[41:09] His mind was full of them.
[41:12] He wanted to express his love to them so
[41:14] bad.
[41:16] He wanted to fellowship with them so
[41:18] bad.
[41:19] All this mysteriousness
[41:21] that he began to unveil himself
[41:24] to unfold himself. Amen.
[41:27] Hallelujah. He spoke his thoughts and
[41:30] there was the logos.
[41:33] A word body that went out of Elohim.
[41:36] Say amen.
[41:38] Brother said the logos was the son of
[41:40] God
[41:41] that went out of God that brooded over
[41:44] the earth.
[41:46] Amen.
[41:49] So when he spoke the logos, his thoughts
[41:52] or his attributes became words. Yeah.
[41:56] So now the predestinated ones
[41:59] who are in his thoughts
[42:01] now become attributes sons of his spirit
[42:04] born by the spoken word of Elohim.
[42:07] Oh glory to God in the logos.
[42:10] Hallelujah.
[42:12] Hallelujah.
[42:13] My
[42:15] So now Elohim can express his love
[42:19] and share his love to his sons.
[42:22] Now Elohim can fellowship with his sons.
[42:24] No longer just thoughts
[42:26] but now expressed in the logos
[42:29] yet to be manifested individually on the
[42:32] earth.
[42:33] Amen. Each son was to come forth on the
[42:36] earth.
[42:36] Amen.
[42:38] Hallelujah.
[42:40] So in the logos and all the names of
[42:42] these attribute sons of Elohim.
[42:45] Every single attribute son from Genesis
[42:47] to Revelation his name was in the logos.
[42:52] Hallelujah. And the logos was Christ.
[42:55] Amen.
[42:57] From a message curtain of time in the
[42:59] beginning. Out of God when the logos
[43:03] which was part of God,
[43:06] God saw what the end would be from the
[43:09] beginning. And the logos came to earth
[43:13] which was Christ the word
[43:16] spoken word of God
[43:18] part of God and was made flesh and dwelt
[43:21] among us.
[43:22] Amen.
[43:23] Later on he said there's the spirit
[43:26] coming out of God manifested as the
[43:29] logos
[43:30] come down and made flesh and dwelt among
[43:33] us.
[43:34] Say amen.
[43:35] Amen.
[43:36] So Elohim saw the end from the
[43:39] beginning. Amen.
[43:40] He saw you way back in his mind before
[43:43] the foundation of the world.
[43:45] He saw you in 2017 at the end of time
[43:48] being filled with the Holy Ghost.
[43:51] Amen. He saw you coming to perfection.
[43:54] He saw you overcoming every devil.
[43:58] Hallelujah.
[43:59] I know it's hard. You feel like giving
[44:01] up sometimes, but he saw you as an
[44:04] overcomer.
[44:05] Give him praise. Give him praise this
[44:08] morning. Do you believe that?
[44:10] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[44:14] Amen. So now,
[44:17] who is your father?
[44:18] [Music]
[44:20] Who spoke you into being?
[44:22] Elohim.
[44:24] Amen.
[44:25] So we know who our father is this
[44:28] morning.
[44:29] We know who we are. Hallelujah.
[44:32] No wonder brother said we come from God
[44:35] and we are going right back to God.
[44:38] Satan get the hints. I know who I am.
[44:42] I'm a son of hell. Haha. Elohim. Glory
[44:45] to God. Amen.
[44:47] Hallelujah. I am an eternal being. I
[44:51] came from eternity just trapped in a
[44:54] human body called time for a purpose.
[44:57] But one of these days, I'm going to bust
[45:00] out of this time atmosphere, this time
[45:03] zone concept, this human thing, and I'm
[45:06] going to go right back to eternity where
[45:09] I belong. Give him praise this morning.
[45:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Glory to
[45:16] God. Amen. How many feel that way this
[45:19] morning? Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Yes,
[45:22] Lord. Amen.
[45:25] Amen. Like I'm an eagle born in an old
[45:27] chicken banyard. Chip, chip, chip,
[45:30] scratch, scratch. Amen. Eating
[45:32] cockroaches and all stale food on the
[45:34] ground.
[45:36] I don't belong here.
[45:38] I feel stifled.
[45:40] What am I doing here?
[45:42] Get me out of here.
[45:44] Is there something higher?
[45:46] Is there something greater?
[45:48] Is there something better?
[45:50] Do I hear mama eagle say, "Son, just
[45:52] flap your wings and fly.
[45:55] Hallelujah. You belong to the
[45:57] heavenlies.
[45:58] Get out of that old bard this morning.
[46:01] Hallelujah.
[46:02] Goodbye world. I stay no longer with
[46:05] you. Goodbye pleasures of sin. I have an
[46:09] eternal purpose in God. Hallelujah. Take
[46:14] your lust. Take your filth, your styles
[46:17] and fashion, your sex and money and
[46:20] politics and religion and go.
[46:24] Hallelujah. I don't want it. Glory to
[46:26] God. Amen.
[46:29] Hallelujah. Is that how you feel this
[46:31] morning? Hallelujah. Do I hear a shout
[46:34] in the house? Give him praise. Give him
[46:37] praise.
[46:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[46:41] Hallelujah.
[46:43] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[46:46] Hallelujah.
[46:51] Amen. You may be seated. Praise God.
[46:54] But my whole inspiration this morning,
[46:57] the thing that is pushing me and driving
[46:59] me and stirring me, Satan, the brother
[47:01] spoke about this morning is that all
[47:05] Elohim ever wanted was fellowship.
[47:10] It's the Saber saying, "You were created
[47:12] for the glory of God."
[47:14] Hallelujah.
[47:16] Hallelujah.
[47:18] Elohim wants fellowship. Amen.
[47:21] Elohim wants to fellowship with his
[47:23] sons.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:26] But he must create a home.
[47:28] An environment where he could meet them.
[47:31] A place prepared for God
[47:34] to meet ma man. Amen.
[47:37] Hallelujah. To fellowship.
[47:40] Glory to God.
[47:42] So God begins to create a comfortable
[47:44] home for his sons.
[47:47] Amen.
[47:48] from a message. Show us the father.
[47:51] Braham says, I can see the log ghost
[47:55] over the earth and brood over it. Bring
[47:58] the earth back around the sun.
[48:01] And begin to break the ice around it.
[48:05] Great big icebergs began to come down.
[48:08] Then he made the dish ditches and the
[48:10] plains.
[48:12] Then it all got melted and made water.
[48:15] Wow.
[48:15] And in Genesis 1, the earth was without
[48:18] all form and void, and the spirit of
[48:20] God, the locust, moved upon the face of
[48:23] the waters. Is that right?
[48:25] Amen. He separated the water, the
[48:28] vegetation. He separated night from day.
[48:32] And when he was finished with his home,
[48:34] when he was finished preparing this home
[48:36] for his sons, he said it was good.
[48:41] Hallelujah.
[48:42] Amen. He had made a good home for his
[48:44] sons. Amen.
[48:47] Now that his home was prepared, the
[48:49] earth, the garden of Eden, and he was
[48:51] satisfied with it, he is ready now to
[48:54] make man.
[48:56] He is excited.
[48:58] He is happy.
[49:00] He can't wait to fellowship with his
[49:02] sons.
[49:03] Hallelujah.
[49:05] Let us make man in our image.
[49:07] Elohim, the father, the invisible one.
[49:11] Logos the son, the word expressed image
[49:14] of Elohim.
[49:16] See, so God created man in his own image
[49:20] and likeness.
[49:21] Adam, a perfect son, a word son. Listen.
[49:26] But why in his image and likeness?
[49:29] All right. Because Elohim wanted real
[49:33] intimate fellowship. Amen.
[49:35] Having God's image and likeness meant
[49:38] that man could understand God's nature
[49:41] and character. Amen.
[49:43] Man would love God and they could relate
[49:46] to him. Amen.
[49:48] They could serve him and worship him and
[49:50] appreciate him for who he is.
[49:53] Say amen this morning.
[49:55] Hallelujah. God was making sure as
[49:58] brother Oid says that he was man was the
[50:01] right kind of son. Amen. Hallelujah.
[50:05] Not by trials and overcoming like we do,
[50:09] but by a gift. Adam was given the
[50:12] character and nature of God
[50:15] to love God with all his heart
[50:18] and with all his soul. Say amen.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:25] Many times the prophet will dramatize
[50:27] how God would come down in the garden to
[50:29] fellowship with his family.
[50:32] Jehovah God coming down to fellowship
[50:34] with his family.
[50:36] How papa God would come down in the cool
[50:38] of the evening to have family worship
[50:41] with them.
[50:43] He would ask Adam about the garden and
[50:45] the names of the various animals and he
[50:48] would be so pleased to hear the report.
[50:51] He would talk to sister Eve about the
[50:53] flowers and what fruits he had picked
[50:55] for the family and how he loved them so
[50:57] much.
[50:58] Amen. Oh, what sweet fellowship they
[51:01] had.
[51:02] Hallelujah. It was the best time of the
[51:04] day.
[51:06] Oh, how papa God would broo over his
[51:08] children. How he admired his own
[51:11] attributes being demonstrated in his son
[51:14] Adam.
[51:15] Amen.
[51:16] Every day, day after day, sweet
[51:19] fellowship.
[51:21] That is what Elohim was longing for.
[51:24] Hallelujah. Now he is no longer lonely.
[51:28] He could express his love to his
[51:30] children.
[51:31] Say amen.
[51:33] Hallelujah.
[51:35] Praise God.
[51:37] From a message fellowship.
[51:40] Now in the beginning when God made man,
[51:43] he didn't make ma make him to be sick.
[51:47] He didn't make him to have cancer.
[51:51] He never made him to die.
[51:53] Amen.
[51:54] He made him for fellowship.
[51:57] Say amen this morning.
[52:01] How in the evening when it was all
[52:02] quiet, God came down and had fellowship
[52:05] with Adam and Eve.
[52:07] They loved God and God loved them. He
[52:10] didn't want them to be sick, get old,
[52:12] and die.
[52:14] He wanted them to be young and lovely
[52:16] forever.
[52:17] Say amen.
[52:20] So, you were made for an eternal
[52:22] purpose. Amen.
[52:24] Because you were in the manifestation
[52:27] of an attribute that wasn't God
[52:31] and God thought of you and expressed
[52:33] you. Amen.
[52:34] Can we say amen?
[52:36] Give him a hand of praise. Amen.
[52:39] Hallelujah.
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:43] Fellowship means worship and praise and
[52:47] adoration and thanking him and bowing
[52:50] your heart and soul to him and praying
[52:53] and fasting and spending time with him.
[52:57] He's always on your mind. You can't wait
[53:00] for the church door to open. You can't
[53:02] wait to read your Bible and tell some
[53:04] more about Jesus. Amen. He's the lover
[53:08] of your soul. Are you in love with Jesus
[53:11] this morning?
[53:12] Hallelujah. Oh, praise God. Are you in
[53:15] fellowship with him? Do you listen to
[53:17] those tapes? Do you read those books?
[53:20] Amen. Hallelujah. All Elohim ever wanted
[53:25] was to be in fellowship with you.
[53:28] That's all. Amen.
[53:30] One of the songwriters said, "I love him
[53:33] because he first loved me."
[53:35] You believe that this morning?
[53:38] Amen. and he made the earth. He made the
[53:40] heavens. But that's not what's on
[53:43] Elohim's mind so much.
[53:45] All he was thinking about was you
[53:49] and you and you point to the neighbor
[53:50] next to you and tell him you amen.
[53:53] Amen. He was thinking about you. Amen.
[53:56] You. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[53:59] Glory to God. Glory to God. If you could
[54:02] only see his love reaching out to you
[54:04] this morning. Hallelujah. Close your
[54:06] eyes and raise your hands and give him
[54:08] praise. Tell him how much you love him.
[54:11] Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
[54:14] God. Praise the name of the Lord. Thank
[54:17] you, Jesus.
[54:19] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[54:23] Hallelujah.
[54:25] He wants your fellowship.
[54:28] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[54:31] Hallelujah.
[54:33] Amen. And so going back to God the
[54:35] garden. Amen.
[54:38] That old sa serpent Satan,
[54:42] he watched that fellowship.
[54:45] He watched it for years.
[54:48] And he plotted and planned long and
[54:50] hard.
[54:51] How he could destroy this fellowship
[54:53] between God and man.
[54:56] Amen. He checked out Adam, but there's
[55:00] no way he could get to him.
[55:02] If he could break the fellowship, then
[55:04] he could get to God.
[55:07] Amen. Yeah. Is a war between God and
[55:09] Satan. He knows that God loves
[55:11] fellowship with his children.
[55:13] And that's all God really longs for.
[55:16] He knows that God delights in the
[55:18] praises of his people.
[55:20] And he shares his glory with no one. So
[55:23] if he could only stop that fellowship
[55:25] this morning, if he could only stop the
[55:27] worship, stop the praises, he could get
[55:30] the upper hand in the battle.
[55:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:36] Hallelujah. Praise God. My God. Why do
[55:41] you think he tries to make sure you are
[55:43] tired?
[55:44] You get so busy with natural cares of
[55:46] life that you can't pray.
[55:49] You can't come to the prayer meeting.
[55:51] Listen,
[55:53] Satan is only concerned about stopping
[55:55] the fellowship between God and man.
[55:57] My
[55:59] praise God. Amen.
[56:00] He strengthened his army.
[56:03] Satan loose 200,000,000
[56:06] devils from the river Euphrates
[56:08] to stop you from receiving the Holy
[56:10] Ghost to stop the fellowship to cut you
[56:14] off from God.
[56:16] My Amen. He wants your connection broken
[56:20] so that there will be no more fellowship
[56:22] and no more worship. But today he's
[56:25] exposed.
[56:27] Hallelujah.
[56:28] We are going to pray. We are going to
[56:31] praise God and worship God. Hallelujah.
[56:35] Yes Lord. Send the fire upon your people
[56:38] today. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory
[56:43] to God. Glory to God. Oh, bring back the
[56:47] praying, Lord. Bring back the groaning
[56:50] and the calling upon God and the travail
[56:53] in Zion. Bring it back. Praise God.
[56:56] Bring back the fellowship by redemption.
[56:59] Hallelujah.
[57:01] Glory to God. Give him praise. Give him
[57:04] praise. Hallelujah.
[57:06] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[57:10] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[57:14] Jesus.
[57:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are more
[57:18] than a conqueror. You are not You are an
[57:20] overcomer this morning.
[57:23] Jesus. Glory to God. Amen.
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:29] Hallelujah.
[57:32] Amen. So, Satan plotted
[57:34] until he found an opening that he could
[57:37] use.
[57:38] He deceived Sister Eve. Amen.
[57:41] And brother Brown said, "When sin was
[57:43] first introduced in the garden, man was
[57:46] in a perfect state
[57:48] until he fell.
[57:50] And this marred his perfection.
[57:53] It marred his inheritance with God.
[57:56] Man lost his fellowship with God
[57:59] and was cut away from God. Amen.
[58:03] My
[58:06] from a message fellowship by redemption.
[58:10] In the beginning, man had perfect
[58:13] fellowship with God.
[58:15] There was nothing wrong.
[58:17] God came down in the evening and talked
[58:19] to Adam and Eve.
[58:21] No harm could happen to them.
[58:23] No sickness, no hurt, nothing.
[58:26] His great voice whispered to them.
[58:28] They had fellowship.
[58:30] Man was conscious at all times that his
[58:33] presence was with them.
[58:36] And that's what we want everywhere we go
[58:37] this morning.
[58:39] His presence with us. Amen.
[58:42] Abraham said, "The greatest fellowship
[58:44] man could ever have is with Christ."
[58:47] Amen. Amen. Amen. At one time, man had
[58:51] perfect fellowship with God.
[58:54] And that was God's purpose for us.
[58:57] Amen. And so you stop the fellowship,
[59:00] you stop your eternal purpose.
[59:03] Amen.
[59:04] Amen. But again today, stay in his
[59:07] presence.
[59:08] Stay in the blessed presence of almighty
[59:10] God.
[59:11] Don't break the fellowship.
[59:13] Don't break it. Amen.
[59:15] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Give the
[59:17] Lord a hand of praise.
[59:24] [Applause]
[59:26] When man fell in the garden, the
[59:29] fellowship cord of communication was
[59:31] broken.
[59:33] Man was no longer an eternal being, he
[59:35] became fallen man.
[59:37] And death steps in.
[59:40] Not only does he lose his life,
[59:43] Amen. but his inheritance in life
[59:47] because he had he had complete supreme
[59:50] control of the earth.
[59:53] He was the god of the earth.
[59:55] He had dominion power over the earth.
[59:59] He lost his right to the tree of life
[1:00:03] and he forfeited it, every bit of it
[1:00:06] into the hands of Satan. Abraham said he
[1:00:09] passed it on from his hand to Satan.
[1:00:13] You mean Satan stole my rights?
[1:00:17] My godship rights, my sunship rights, my
[1:00:21] dominion rights. He stole my inheritance
[1:00:25] that my father left for me.
[1:00:28] Brother, I'm beginning to fold my fist.
[1:00:31] I'm getting into fighting mood.
[1:00:33] Hallelujah. Anybody want to fight this
[1:00:36] morning?
[1:00:37] Hallelujah. The devil stole my rights.
[1:00:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] Praise God.
[1:00:46] Amen.
[1:00:48] From the first seal, Lord.
[1:00:50] You remember how it was lost.
[1:00:52] All right.
[1:00:53] Brother Bam says by Adam, he forfeited
[1:00:57] the book of life or the tree of life for
[1:01:00] the knowledge of Satan
[1:01:03] or he gave it up in exchange for the
[1:01:06] knowledge of Satan.
[1:01:08] That's the penalty he had to pay.
[1:01:11] My Satan, that old deceiver,
[1:01:16] destroyer of the sons of God. All he's
[1:01:19] doing is stealing and robbing and
[1:01:22] destroying. He did it then and he wants
[1:01:24] to do it now. Amen.
[1:01:27] And sin brings a chasm,
[1:01:30] a gap between God and man,
[1:01:33] no more fellowship.
[1:01:36] How that must have saddened the heart of
[1:01:38] God.
[1:01:40] He gets sad sometimes. Ephesians says,
[1:01:42] "Grieve not the Holy Spirit."
[1:01:45] So God can be grieved.
[1:01:47] The Holy Spirit can be grieved.
[1:01:50] Amen.
[1:01:50] That's right.
[1:01:51] Amen.
[1:01:53] That's the word.
[1:01:54] Satan's aim is to make sure that God is
[1:01:58] not worship.
[1:01:59] All right.
[1:02:00] Or he does not get your fellowship.
[1:02:02] Amen.
[1:02:04] You may say, "I'm not a devil
[1:02:05] worshipper. I'm not commit committing
[1:02:08] adultery.
[1:02:10] I live a nice clean life,
[1:02:12] but I'm so busy. I can't pray. I can't
[1:02:15] read my Bible. I can't come to prayer
[1:02:18] meetings.
[1:02:19] Brother, that's the devil right there.
[1:02:25] Once he cuts off your fellowship with
[1:02:28] God,
[1:02:29] your devotion and your worship to God,
[1:02:33] then God is grieved and Satan gets your
[1:02:36] worship. Say amen.
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:40] Say amen.
[1:02:43] And that's all he wants.
[1:02:46] Anything that will prevent you
[1:02:48] from having your fellowship with God,
[1:02:51] that's the devil right there. Amen.
[1:02:54] Amen.
[1:02:56] Hallelujah. Satan is exposed. Amen.
[1:02:59] So today,
[1:03:01] you have to begin to allocate some time
[1:03:04] in your busy schedule
[1:03:06] for God.
[1:03:08] Say, amen.
[1:03:10] Hallelujah. Say, I'm going to allocate
[1:03:13] some time
[1:03:15] for God.
[1:03:16] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:03:19] You can never be too busy for God.
[1:03:22] Amen.
[1:03:25] Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:29] Don't fall prey to the devil's tricks.
[1:03:32] We are overcomers.
[1:03:35] Amen. And the devil is exposed today.
[1:03:38] Satan is exposed. Amen. You don't want
[1:03:41] to grieve the Holy Spirit in this late
[1:03:44] hour.
[1:03:46] I was too late. Amen.
[1:03:47] You ought to make him happy. Amen.
[1:03:49] Amen. Yes.
[1:03:53] Because all Elohim,
[1:03:56] the allsufficient one,
[1:03:58] the great and mighty one,
[1:04:01] all he ever wanted
[1:04:03] was some fellowship from you.
[1:04:06] Say amen this morning.
[1:04:09] Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah. You You must be really
[1:04:16] important to God.
[1:04:17] Hallelujah.
[1:04:18] Isn't it? Amen.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] Hallelujah.
[1:04:23] From divine healing. Brother,
[1:04:26] you ought to be the happiest person in
[1:04:29] the world this morning.
[1:04:30] Amen.
[1:04:31] That you are sitting here as a believer.
[1:04:34] Yes, sir.
[1:04:35] To know that when Almighty God knocks on
[1:04:38] your heart,
[1:04:40] why?
[1:04:41] There's nothing like it. Nowhere. Yeah,
[1:04:44] you could search and comb the heavens
[1:04:46] and you couldn't find anything equal to
[1:04:49] that.
[1:04:51] Say amen.
[1:04:52] That's how a holy infinite God, Elohim,
[1:04:56] would come down and knock at the heart
[1:04:59] of a sinner's door and want to live
[1:05:02] bodies with him.
[1:05:04] Say amen.
[1:05:06] He wants to be your buddy. Amen.
[1:05:08] Hallelujah.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah.
[1:05:11] Brother Bam says that ought to make
[1:05:13] everybody break loose in here this
[1:05:14] morning. Come on, stand up to your feet.
[1:05:17] Break loose this morning. God wants to
[1:05:19] be your buddy. Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] My God. Amen. Amen. Oh, praise God. Give
[1:05:25] him praise. Give him praise. Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] Oh, the allsufficient one wants to be
[1:05:33] buddies with you. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:40] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:43] Amen. You may be seated. Praise God.
[1:05:48] Hallelujah.
[1:05:50] Forgive me. I'm stuck on it. But Elohim
[1:05:52] wants your fellowship.
[1:05:54] Why won't you worship God?
[1:05:57] Young brother,
[1:05:59] why won't you worship God? Young sister,
[1:06:03] Caleb, officer, minister, whoever you
[1:06:06] are, why won't you worship God?
[1:06:10] All Elohim ever wanted was your
[1:06:12] fellowship.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:17] Not just our fellowship, but your
[1:06:19] fellowship as an individual.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:24] Praise God. I had hundreds of pages of
[1:06:26] notes, but I just can move from Elohim
[1:06:29] wanting your fellowship. Amen.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:06:40] Praise God. Amen. But let's press on.
[1:06:43] So God had given man the rights the tree
[1:06:45] of life, the book of life. Man had
[1:06:49] eternal life.
[1:06:51] He had dominion over the earth.
[1:06:54] Every creeping thing, every foul of the
[1:06:57] air, he was god of the earth. He was
[1:07:00] master of the earth under papa god.
[1:07:02] He was a government over all the
[1:07:04] creation.
[1:07:06] Amen. And part of his of his inheritance
[1:07:08] in life.
[1:07:09] Amen. As I said before, is that he was
[1:07:12] not to be sick.
[1:07:14] Amen.
[1:07:15] And God didn't make him to have cancer.
[1:07:18] He did. He never made man to die. Amen.
[1:07:21] He made man for fellowship.
[1:07:25] Praise God.
[1:07:27] So the devil came and stole it. Amen.
[1:07:30] Brother,
[1:07:32] God was not going to sit down and let
[1:07:35] some devil ruin his fellowship with his
[1:07:37] sons.
[1:07:39] No, no, no.
[1:07:40] Hallelujah. He devised a plan to restore
[1:07:45] his sons or to redeem his sons and to
[1:07:49] reconnect that life cord of
[1:07:50] communication and fellowship. Say amen.
[1:07:56] God does not want new sons. He wants
[1:07:59] you.
[1:08:01] He is not going to replace you because
[1:08:04] you did this or you did that. God wants
[1:08:08] you. God wants me. Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] So what are you scared about?
[1:08:14] Hallelujah. Everything that happened, it
[1:08:17] had to be this way to bring you to this
[1:08:20] spot now.
[1:08:22] Say amen.
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. Glory to God. So God is
[1:08:27] bringing back that which has already
[1:08:29] been.
[1:08:30] Say amen.
[1:08:32] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:08:36] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] So he devised a plan of redemption to
[1:08:40] redeem his sons and the earth.
[1:08:44] Remember
[1:08:46] man was lost.
[1:08:48] God's word was if you eat of that tree
[1:08:51] of knowledge of good and evil, you will
[1:08:53] surely die.
[1:08:55] So in all of creation, death emerged,
[1:09:00] sickness, snowstorms.
[1:09:03] The animals began to fight among
[1:09:05] themselves. Adam could no longer talk to
[1:09:08] the lion as its master. He had to run
[1:09:12] for his life.
[1:09:14] The earth had lost its original master.
[1:09:18] The earth is in chaos.
[1:09:20] Satan a squatter not the legal order
[1:09:25] posing as master of the earth cosmos
[1:09:29] world. Amen. He is now in charge of
[1:09:31] politics and all the system and the
[1:09:34] governments. He creates diseases, germs,
[1:09:37] demons, style, fashion, secular music,
[1:09:41] you name it. Satan created creates it.
[1:09:44] Amen.
[1:09:45] No wonder the whole world, the whole
[1:09:48] earth is groaning. waiting on the
[1:09:50] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:09:54] Waiting on his rightful master to come
[1:09:56] back in position again. Hallelujah.
[1:09:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:01] Who do you think send the tsunamis and
[1:10:04] the thunderstorms?
[1:10:06] Satan is the prince of the power of the
[1:10:08] air. But my God, he's not the king.
[1:10:11] Hallelujah. He can only do what God
[1:10:13] allows him to do.
[1:10:17] Amen. Amen. He thinks he has power,
[1:10:21] right? But God is the king. Amen.
[1:10:24] Hallelujah.
[1:10:25] Oh, glory to God.
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:29] So, I want you to see that man or the
[1:10:33] human race was lost completely.
[1:10:38] Natural death, that's one thing,
[1:10:41] but also spiritual death, which was
[1:10:44] worse.
[1:10:45] Yes. because it meant being eternally
[1:10:47] separated from God.
[1:10:50] In other words, no more fellowship
[1:10:52] forever.
[1:10:54] You see what the devil's plan was
[1:10:58] to cut off the fellowship forever.
[1:11:02] And he knew God loves fellowship.
[1:11:08] He did it by God's own words.
[1:11:11] The day you eat, you will die.
[1:11:15] The devil paralyzed man from having
[1:11:17] fellowship with his Lord and Maker
[1:11:20] because God cannot break his own word.
[1:11:24] My the day you eat it will surely die.
[1:11:28] They ate. They must die because God
[1:11:31] cannot break his word.
[1:11:36] Brother, the picture was dim because
[1:11:39] Satan had lost the battle with Michael
[1:11:42] and was kicked out of heaven.
[1:11:44] So he studied this thing good. He
[1:11:47] plotted for long and hard. How can I
[1:11:50] hurt God?
[1:11:52] How can I get back at God?
[1:11:55] Well, he loves fellowship. He's longing
[1:11:57] for fellowship from his children. I will
[1:12:00] make him have to remove his sons from
[1:12:04] the garden and stop fellowshipping with
[1:12:07] them and every other future son that was
[1:12:11] to come forth.
[1:12:14] So powerful was Satan's statics. Amen.
[1:12:19] My
[1:12:21] do you see the picture this morning
[1:12:23] from a message the dity of Jesus
[1:12:27] when our first mother and father fell in
[1:12:29] the garden of Eden? His relationship,
[1:12:33] his communion with God was cut off
[1:12:36] because of sin.
[1:12:38] God had to drive them away from the
[1:12:41] Garden of Eden. And that's just what the
[1:12:43] devil wanted.
[1:12:44] Yes.
[1:12:46] Brother Brandham says
[1:12:49] from that hour,
[1:12:51] God began to scream up and down the
[1:12:55] garden,
[1:12:57] hurting for his lost children.
[1:12:59] My God.
[1:13:02] My That's the love he has for us. Amen.
[1:13:06] The only way then that God could ever
[1:13:10] redeem him,
[1:13:12] he would have to come down and redeem
[1:13:15] himself.
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:18] My
[1:13:19] He could not send somebody else.
[1:13:22] He could not send an angel. No, that
[1:13:25] wouldn't be right. He had to come down
[1:13:28] himself to redeem her.
[1:13:33] You know why? Because if God was the one
[1:13:36] that had passed the judgment,
[1:13:38] then only God could take man's place in
[1:13:42] the judgment. Give him praise.
[1:13:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] God said the only way I could be just is
[1:13:54] for me to take his place.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:04] Hallelujah.
[1:14:05] Hallelujah.
[1:14:07] So in the Old Testament from Adam all
[1:14:10] the way up to Malachi,
[1:14:12] God provided a covering for man,
[1:14:15] a temporary arrangement.
[1:14:18] He told them to kill a lamb. The priests
[1:14:21] would cut the lamb's throat and the
[1:14:24] sinner would put his head on the lamb
[1:14:25] and confess his sins.
[1:14:28] The man would feel the jerking,
[1:14:30] quivering flesh of the little dying
[1:14:32] lamb.
[1:14:33] The lamb was dying instead of the man.
[1:14:37] This was how he was redeemed at that
[1:14:40] time temporarily.
[1:14:42] The priest would collect the blood and
[1:14:45] put it upon the fire to burn.
[1:14:48] That was his temporary redemption. Amen.
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:53] But that man went straight back out with
[1:14:58] the same desire in his heart to do the
[1:15:00] same thing he came in for.
[1:15:04] My
[1:15:05] it was only temporary.
[1:15:08] So Hebrews 10, for it was not possible
[1:15:11] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[1:15:14] take away sins.
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:18] It was just a shadow. It was just a
[1:15:20] temporary arrangement until the real
[1:15:23] thing came.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] Hallelujah.
[1:15:27] The sin was still there.
[1:15:30] We needed something that would take the
[1:15:32] sin itself and disintegrate it
[1:15:36] until it is no more.
[1:15:38] You cannot find the sin nor the sinner.
[1:15:41] What sin? Tell me. What sin? It was gone
[1:15:44] the moment you confess. Buried in the
[1:15:47] sea of forgetfulness. Give him praise
[1:15:49] this morning.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah.
[1:15:54] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:15:57] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:16:00] One time a brother, I think it was
[1:16:01] brother Perry Green, was with a prophet
[1:16:05] and another brother had sinned
[1:16:08] and the prophet discerned the brother
[1:16:11] and he spoke to him privately.
[1:16:13] I hope I'm getting the story right.
[1:16:16] And the brother confessed and made it
[1:16:18] right.
[1:16:20] Later on in the day when the perry asked
[1:16:23] brother Brandham what was it that the
[1:16:25] brother had done that was wrong.
[1:16:29] The prophet said when God forgives a man
[1:16:32] of his sin he doesn't even show it to
[1:16:35] his prophet. The prophet could not go
[1:16:37] back and find that sin. He said not even
[1:16:40] God himself could find it. He has a sea
[1:16:43] of forgetfulness never to be remembered
[1:16:46] anymore. Give him praise. Give him
[1:16:50] praise. Hallelujah.
[1:16:53] My God. My God. Disintegrated.
[1:16:57] No more. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:17:02] Amen.
[1:17:04] That's the kind of redeemer we have this
[1:17:06] morning.
[1:17:08] So now we realize it took the blood in
[1:17:11] the Old Testament,
[1:17:13] but God has no blood. He's a spirit.
[1:17:17] Elohim logos.
[1:17:20] So he almighty Jehovah
[1:17:23] overshadowed Mary
[1:17:25] and created a blood cell
[1:17:27] in the womb of Mary
[1:17:30] and that brought forth the very creative
[1:17:32] blood of God to redeem us.
[1:17:36] Say amen.
[1:17:38] You mean to say God made blood just to
[1:17:40] redeem you? Stand up and give him
[1:17:43] praise. Give him praise. Hallelujah.
[1:17:48] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. The blood
[1:17:52] of Jesus. Hallelujah. There's power in
[1:17:54] the blood. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:17:59] Amen.
[1:18:01] Oh, glory to God. So on the cross,
[1:18:06] the blood was drawn out of Emanuel's
[1:18:08] veins
[1:18:09] which produced the redeeming power.
[1:18:14] Amen.
[1:18:15] And we are redeemed by the blood of God.
[1:18:19] We were bought and redeemed by God's own
[1:18:22] blood.
[1:18:24] God created blood to redeem us.
[1:18:27] He logos came and lived in the same body
[1:18:30] that he created
[1:18:32] so he could be a kinsman.
[1:18:34] Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] Amen.
[1:18:38] Amen.
[1:18:39] God had to suffer temptation.
[1:18:42] Riches, power,
[1:18:45] tempted in all manner like we are.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:50] Headaches, tiredness, hunger, passion,
[1:18:52] you name it.
[1:18:54] He endured it.
[1:18:55] Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:18:57] He couldn't do it. Elohim couldn't do it
[1:19:00] as God in spirit.
[1:19:03] He had to do it as God in flesh.
[1:19:06] Even Jesus Christ,
[1:19:08] our kinsman, redeemer,
[1:19:10] God condescending in the flesh.
[1:19:13] Amen. You believe that?
[1:19:16] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] Glory to God.
[1:19:19] Hallelujah.
[1:19:20] Let's go over to Revelation.
[1:19:23] over in Revelation. Now, John is
[1:19:26] weeping.
[1:19:29] No one was worthy to redeem man.
[1:19:33] No angel.
[1:19:34] No.
[1:19:35] Not even an archangel.
[1:19:38] They were holy and sinless,
[1:19:41] but they couldn't do it.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:43] Who is worthy?
[1:19:45] The angels couldn't do it. They were
[1:19:47] holy, but they couldn't do it
[1:19:49] because God's law required a kinsman.
[1:19:57] So the angels were holy, but they were
[1:19:59] not kinfolk.
[1:20:02] Silence,
[1:20:05] no response, nobody. John is weeping.
[1:20:09] All of a sudden, the lamb came out
[1:20:12] boldly.
[1:20:14] I am their kinsman. I am their redeemer.
[1:20:19] I now have made intercession for them.
[1:20:22] I now have come to claim their rights
[1:20:24] for them.
[1:20:25] You talk about an attorney.
[1:20:28] Hallelujah. representing us.
[1:20:31] He said they have a right now to
[1:20:34] everything that was lost in the fall.
[1:20:37] And I've paid a price. Give him praise.
[1:20:41] Give him praise. He said, "I have died
[1:20:44] for them. I am the kinsman redeemer. I
[1:20:48] am the mediator. My blood was shed. I
[1:20:52] became man in order to redeem the church
[1:20:55] back again.
[1:20:56] Hallelujah. He takes the book.
[1:21:00] Glory to God. All my life always said
[1:21:05] Jesus died to take the book.
[1:21:07] Now I know he took the book. Praise God.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now the title
[1:21:14] deed of redemption of all creation is in
[1:21:18] his hand.
[1:21:19] He comes to claim it back for the human
[1:21:21] race.
[1:21:23] Not for the angels,
[1:21:24] but back to humans for which it was
[1:21:27] given to make sons and daughters of God
[1:21:30] again
[1:21:31] and to bring them back to Eden.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] Hallelujah.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] Everything they lost,
[1:21:45] the whole creation, the trees, animal
[1:21:47] life, he claims his redemptive right for
[1:21:51] us. Give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:21:54] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:04] Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:10] Raise your hand. Just thank him wherever
[1:22:11] you are. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:22:14] Lord.
[1:22:16] Thank you, Father.
[1:22:20] Hallelujah.
[1:22:23] Oh, to know that we were one time aliens
[1:22:26] without God,
[1:22:28] without mercy,
[1:22:30] and then Jesus died to redeem us.
[1:22:33] Amen.
[1:22:40] What did he redeem
[1:22:42] from a message? Redeemer redemption.
[1:22:46] He redeemed your soul from hell.
[1:22:50] Amen.
[1:22:50] My
[1:22:52] you are on your way to hell
[1:22:54] and the blood snatch your soul from the
[1:22:57] devil and claim your soul. Oh, glory to
[1:23:00] God.
[1:23:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] Amen. Yes. Bam says he redeemed and
[1:23:08] brought back everything that Adam lost.
[1:23:12] Where the devil put you in a pawn shop,
[1:23:15] Jesus, our redeemer,
[1:23:17] redeemed you from the curse of the
[1:23:19] devil.
[1:23:22] He redeems your soul.
[1:23:24] He redeems your weary, dreary spirit.
[1:23:28] He redeems your sick body.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah. Total complete redemption.
[1:23:35] Praise God.
[1:23:36] Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] By the blood.
[1:23:39] Glory to God.
[1:23:41] Hallelujah.
[1:23:43] He brought you happiness. He brings you
[1:23:46] joy.
[1:23:47] He brings you peace, longsuffering,
[1:23:50] goodness, gentleness, meekness, power.
[1:23:54] He brings you the Holy Spirit. He brings
[1:23:57] you divine healing this morning. Say
[1:24:00] amen. Say amen.
[1:24:03] What are these? Your inheritance in
[1:24:06] life.
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:08] Amen.
[1:24:09] So when man fall, they lost their life
[1:24:12] and their inheritance in life.
[1:24:18] Your inheritance to life. Your father
[1:24:20] left these for you.
[1:24:21] Yes, sir.
[1:24:22] And the filthy devil took your rights to
[1:24:24] these things.
[1:24:28] My
[1:24:30] how dare he make me sick now?
[1:24:32] That's not part of the package.
[1:24:34] Anybody feel like fighting?
[1:24:37] Come on, you soldiers.
[1:24:40] The book has been restored.
[1:24:42] Jesus died to take the book and your
[1:24:45] name is on that book.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] It's a book of redemption.
[1:24:52] Hallelujah. A book of redemption. You
[1:24:55] are redeemed. Give him praise.

[1:25:01] rights.

[1:25:17] on your way to hell.
[1:25:19] not knowing who you were,
[1:25:21] not sure who your father is
[1:25:24] or what belongs to you,
[1:25:27] and an attorney called you into his
[1:25:30] office
[1:25:31] and showed you a legal document.
[1:25:35] Glory to God.
[1:25:37] Hallelujah. And you see an abstract
[1:25:39] title deed
[1:25:40] that your father left.

[1:26:05] praise.

[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:15] Jesus.

[1:26:18] but your name on the book.
[1:26:20] And your father left that for you. Amen.
[1:26:23] So it belongs to me.

[1:27:01] Amen.
[1:27:02] He's your attorney, but he's also your
[1:27:04] judge, but today he's your attorney.
[1:27:07] He's going to fight for you. He redeemed
[1:27:09] you. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] Praise God. Amen.
[1:27:17] Let me see if I could strike the text.
[1:27:21] Complete redemption for the bride of
[1:27:23] Jesus Christ.
[1:27:26] Amen.
[1:27:28] When death struck Adam, it was natural
[1:27:31] death, the body and spiritual death.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:37] Jesus came to redeem both body and soul.
[1:27:41] And the spirit is included. Notice
[1:27:45] your soul. Barab says he came to bring
[1:27:50] complete redemption.
[1:27:53] So your soul is completely redeemed.
[1:27:57] So your soul was redeemed first. Amen.
[1:27:59] That's right.
[1:28:00] Man can begin to fellowship now
[1:28:04] once again with God.
[1:28:06] That's good.
[1:28:07] Amen.
[1:28:08] Hallelujah. The blood redeems all three.
[1:28:11] But the soul right now is completely
[1:28:14] redeemed.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] The soul was in sin. So God came down by
[1:28:21] a process of redemption, justification,
[1:28:24] sanctification, and baptism of the Holy
[1:28:26] Ghost and redeemed your soul.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:32] So you can have fellowship with God now
[1:28:34] from your soul.
[1:28:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:39] But a body is not redeemed fully as yet.
[1:28:42] It is to be redeemed.
[1:28:44] Yes, sir.
[1:28:46] But your human spirit
[1:28:49] is all influenced by reasoning and
[1:28:51] imagination,
[1:28:53] affection, and conscience and so forth.
[1:28:56] That is not the spirit of God.
[1:29:01] He said, "I will sprinkle clean water
[1:29:03] upon you."
[1:29:04] And Ezekiel 36, "And you shall be clean
[1:29:08] from all your filthiness.
[1:29:10] From your idols will I cleanse you."
[1:29:13] Verse 26, "A new heart also will I give
[1:29:16] you, and a new spirit will I put within
[1:29:20] you."
[1:29:21] Say, "Amen."
[1:29:22] Amen.
[1:29:23] And I will take away the stony heart out
[1:29:25] of your flesh,
[1:29:27] and I will give you a heart of flesh.
[1:29:29] Then I will put my spirit within you,
[1:29:33] the Holy Spirit. Say amen.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah.
[1:29:38] Oh, praise God.
[1:29:40] So, our spirits have to be sanctified.
[1:29:43] All kinds of unclean spirits driving

[1:30:38] It is the Holy Spirit of God.
[1:30:42] That's the token that God requires of
[1:30:44] the church today. Say amen.
[1:30:48] Say amen.

[1:34:45] church and won't worship God
[1:34:48] or he would worship if he feels to or
[1:34:50] when he feels to but brother when the 24
[1:34:54] elders saw the lamb stepping forward to
[1:34:57] redeem us, they threw off their crowns
[1:35:00] and they fell on the ground and they

[1:35:17] and burn all the sin out,
[1:35:20] the germs, all the devils, all the
[1:35:23] temptation, all evil is gone. Then he
[1:35:27] can come and dwell with you
[1:35:29] and you can sit in heavenly places
[1:35:32] in Christ Jesus
[1:35:34] because you're already in him.

[1:35:39] your filthy human spirit.
[1:35:41] That's right.

[1:38:07] As soon as Pharaoh realized that he lost
[1:38:10] them, he came after them with all his
[1:38:12] chariots and horsemen.
[1:38:14] The enemy was after them. There was no
[1:38:17] way out, no escape.
[1:38:20] Did God bring them out there to die in

[1:38:27] other side, the Red Sea in front of
[1:38:29] them, and Pharaoh's mighty army coming
[1:38:32] behind them. Oh Lord,
[1:38:36] millions of soldiers coming, marching to

[1:39:58] Exodus 14. And all night long,
[1:40:03] you can hear me.
[1:40:06] All night long,
[1:40:07] a strong east wind blew. And the Lord
[1:40:12] caused the Red Sea to go back
[1:40:14] and make the sea dry land
[1:40:17] and divided the waters.
[1:40:20] God's power is now on display.

[1:40:58] crossed over and they looked back and
[1:41:02] saw Pharaoh and all the enemies had
[1:41:05] drowned in the sea, brother, they began
[1:41:08] to dance and sing.

[1:42:24] And after they came out of the on the
[1:42:25] other side, they saw their old task
[1:42:28] masters who had beaten them and killed
[1:42:32] some of them. Maybe your taskmaster is
[1:42:35] cancer or cigarettes, tobacco, whiskey,
[1:42:38] whatever it is. Amen. They looked back
[1:42:41] and saw all those things that they were
[1:42:43] struggling with, helpless and dying in
[1:42:46] the sea.
[1:42:47] Brother, you talk about a meeting they
[1:42:49] had. Amen. Praise God. And when Moses
[1:42:53] knew that all those things were gone
[1:42:56] forever, the things that whipped them
[1:42:58] and drove them around was finished, he
[1:43:01] raised his hands and sang in the spirit.

[1:43:08] God. Amen.
[1:43:10] Hallelujah.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. But this morning, when you
[1:43:14] look behind you and you see all those
[1:43:16] filthy Egyptian spirits dead,
[1:43:20] you will begin to shout and praise your
[1:43:23] God.
[1:43:24] The Egyptians you see today, you will
[1:43:27] see them no more forever.
[1:43:30] You are free. Free to praise God. Free
[1:43:33] to worship God. Amen. Give him praise.
[1:43:36] Give him praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] Oh, blessed be an egg.

[1:43:47] It's a worship. Amen.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah.
[1:43:52] Praise God. Brother, you can't go into
[1:43:55] resurrection halfway in the world and
[1:43:58] halfway in church.
[1:44:00] You have to be fully redeemed.
[1:44:04] No more world holding you back.
[1:44:06] Amen.
[1:44:08] And when you are fully redeemed, you
[1:44:11] become a new person.
[1:44:13] Not just old and patched up
[1:44:17] by joining church or trying to turn a
[1:44:20] new page,
[1:44:21] but you are a complete brand new unit.
[1:44:25] God takes the old man and burns him
[1:44:28] completely out with a fire of the Holy
[1:44:30] Ghost.
[1:44:32] Then God comes himself into your heart.
[1:44:36] Amen.
[1:44:37] He sends down your representation.
[1:44:40] Amen. Representation by predestination.
[1:44:43] Amen.
[1:44:44] Satan can tempt but he cannot get a
[1:44:47] bornagain Christian because God from the
[1:44:51] foundation of the world foraw him
[1:44:54] and send Jesus to redeem him.
[1:44:56] And now the blood speaks for him.
[1:45:00] Say amen.
[1:45:03] How can he sin when it can't be seen
[1:45:06] even by God?
[1:45:07] Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] The only thing he hears is your voice.
[1:45:12] But he sees your representation.
[1:45:15] Give him praise.
[1:45:17] Give him praise. Hallelujah.
[1:45:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You have
[1:45:24] representation this morning.
[1:45:27] Amen.
[1:45:28] Yes, sir.
[1:45:30] One of these days you will be completely
[1:45:33] light like Enoch.
[1:45:36] All the heaviness of the world is gone.
[1:45:39] Paul said,
[1:45:41] "Oh wretched man that I am, who shall
[1:45:45] deliver me from this body of death?"
[1:45:49] Paul's body was not redeemed as it
[1:45:54] Paul delighted in the law of God after
[1:45:56] the inward man.
[1:45:58] That's right.
[1:45:59] Paul saw another law in his members
[1:46:02] waring against the law of his mind.
[1:46:06] In other words, Paul's soul was
[1:46:09] redeemed,
[1:46:10] but his body, his flesh was not fully
[1:46:12] redeemed.
[1:46:14] The good that I want to do, I do not.
[1:46:18] The evil which I would not, that I do.
[1:46:22] Oh God, deliver me from this body of
[1:46:26] death.
[1:46:27] How many feel that way sometimes?
[1:46:31] My God.
[1:46:34] Brother, our bodies are going to be
[1:46:37] redeemed.
[1:46:39] Say amen.
[1:46:41] That's a weak amen. Say amen.
[1:46:45] Our bodies are going to be redeemed.
[1:46:47] Yeah,
[1:46:48] listen. We already have divine healing
[1:46:52] which is the earnest of our redeemed
[1:46:55] bodies.
[1:46:57] Hallelujah.
[1:46:59] What about himself said? If there is no
[1:47:01] divine healing of this body, there will
[1:47:04] be no redemption and resurrection of
[1:47:07] this body. Amen.
[1:47:10] If there is no divine healing, then
[1:47:12] those that go down in the grave will
[1:47:14] remain there forever and there will be
[1:47:16] no more of them.
[1:47:19] My
[1:47:20] and brother Bam is referring to cancer
[1:47:22] patients who the doctor had given a few
[1:47:25] days to live. Praise God. Like Miss
[1:47:28] Florence Night and Gail and so on yet
[1:47:30] prayed for.
[1:47:32] She couldn't even raise her hands,
[1:47:34] couldn't even speak. just a bundle of
[1:47:37] bones.
[1:47:38] Brother said when you see the old
[1:47:40] crippled twisted children hands
[1:47:43] straighten out and walk off this
[1:47:45] platform heal.
[1:47:48] He said if God could reach down to those
[1:47:50] sick people and heal them and that's
[1:47:53] just the earnest or the down payment of
[1:47:57] our resurrected bodies.
[1:48:01] What will it be when the bride draws the
[1:48:04] full value of redemption, the full value
[1:48:07] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ?
[1:48:10] Hallelujah. Praise God. He said divine
[1:48:15] healing is the evidence that your mortal
[1:48:18] body will change to immortality.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah. Praise God. Give him praise.
[1:48:25] That's what we are living for. Come on,
[1:48:27] give him praise. Glory to God. Glory to
[1:48:30] God.
[1:48:31] Thank you Jesus.
[1:48:32] Praise God.
[1:48:34] My
[1:48:36] from a message
[1:48:39] faith is a substance.
[1:48:42] While we groaning like Paul veiled in
[1:48:46] this tabernacle of humiliation, the
[1:48:48] body,
[1:48:50] we have an earnest
[1:48:52] of our perfect complete redemption.
[1:48:55] back like we were in the beginning
[1:48:57] when God created Adam in the Garden of
[1:48:59] Eden.
[1:49:01] He said we have a foretaste of glory
[1:49:03] divine
[1:49:04] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:06] Amen.
[1:49:07] The refreshing coming from the presence
[1:49:10] of God
[1:49:11] to water the church
[1:49:13] to make it grow in grace.
[1:49:15] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:49:18] He says when we are sick, we have
[1:49:21] redemption.
[1:49:23] The blessing, the attributes of the
[1:49:25] death of Jesus Christ,
[1:49:27] divine healing is assigned to us.
[1:49:30] That someday,
[1:49:32] this mortal will take on immortality.
[1:49:36] He says, "Marvelous."
[1:49:38] He said, "He's here to do it."
[1:49:40] Amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand of
[1:49:42] praise.
[1:49:43] Musicians, I'm almost ready to close.
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:49] Hallelujah.

[2:14:51] We want to pray for our pastor today.
[2:14:55] He's having an incredible pain in his
[2:14:58] shoulder, having trouble to lift his his
[2:15:02] hands. I want to lay hands on him and
[2:15:05] pray for him this morning.
[2:15:09] We know who we are this morning and the
[2:15:10] word has already gone forth. The devil
[2:15:13] is already stripped of his power. He has
[2:15:16] no power. And as the church of the
[2:15:18] living God, we stand united in faith and
[2:15:21] in confidence knowing that we shall lay
[2:15:23] hands on the sick and they shall
[2:15:25] recover. And this pain that the devil
[2:15:28] has tried to inflict. We come this
[2:15:29] morning to curse it. Send it back to the
[2:15:32] pit of hell for where it came, the devil
[2:15:35] will try. It's his job to try. And it's
[2:15:38] our job to send it back. It's our job to
[2:15:41] reject it. It's our job to cast out
[2:15:44] devils, to rebuke spirits.
[2:15:48] Can we bow our heads for a word of
[2:15:49] prayer? Heavenly Father, Lord, we stand
[2:15:52] united this morning as a church of the
[2:15:54] living God. Lord, the word has already
[2:15:56] gone forth. Present tense redemption,
[2:15:59] redemption by blood, redemption by
[2:16:01] power. Father God, how you love the
[2:16:04] fellowship and we have come this morning
[2:16:06] to have fellowship, sweet communion with
[2:16:08] you, Father, Lord. But it's not just for
[2:16:11] the Lord for us to just gather, Lord.
[2:16:13] But you give us power to turn back the
[2:16:16] clock, to turn back time because we are
[2:16:18] creatures of eternity. And the devil
[2:16:21] came down in Eden and disrupted God's
[2:16:23] plan. But we have been dispatched in
[2:16:26] such a time as this as creatures of
[2:16:29] eternity. draft in time to prove to the
[2:16:32] devil that they'll be born sons of fil
[2:16:35] sons of placed sons of adopted sons and
[2:16:39] father as the elders of the church we
[2:16:41] lay our hands upon our pastor as a
[2:16:43] church of the living God we unite in

[2:17:01] affliction, every ailment. House of hell
[2:17:04] give way to the name of Jesus. We
[2:17:07] declare healing. We declare all is well
[2:17:10] in the name of Jesus Christ. And father
[2:17:13] God, may you reveal him with the baptism
[2:17:16] of the Holy Ghost and fire. May the
[2:17:18] power of fire, even God himself drop
[2:17:21] down, Lord. May you consume him. May you
[2:17:25] tabernacle yourself in the depths of his
[2:17:28] soul so he could stand to minister like
[2:17:31] he has never done before. Father take
[2:17:33] his ministry to another level. Let it
[2:17:36] not be man but let it be the angel of
[2:17:39] the Lord.

[2:18:26] to leave bound. The word has already
[2:18:28] been declared. This is the time of the
[2:18:31] finishing of all things. Uh it's the
[2:18:33] time of redemption. You are already
[2:18:36] redeemed. Who we for we call who we call
[2:18:39] he justified. Who we justified. He had
[2:18:42] already glorified. What shall we say to
[2:18:46] these things? Uh if God before ush who
[2:18:49] could be against us what spirit, what
