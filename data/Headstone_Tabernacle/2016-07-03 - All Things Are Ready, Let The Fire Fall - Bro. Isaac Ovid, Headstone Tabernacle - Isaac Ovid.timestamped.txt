[43:04] my so are you ready for the word this
[43:08] morning amen so let's take our Bibles
[43:10] we're going to go to one portion of
[43:12] scripture this morning taken from 1
[43:25] Samuel
[43:27] 1st Samuel
[43:33] 7 I'm reading from verse
[43:43] one 1st Samuel 7 and reading from verse
[43:52] 1 and the men of Kad jerro Rim came and
[43:58] fetched up the Ark of the Lord and
[44:02] brought it into the house of abinadab in
[44:05] the hill and Sanctified eleasa his son
[44:08] to keep the Ark of the Lord and it came
[44:12] to pass while the Ark abod in Karim that
[44:16] the time was
[44:18] long for it was 20 years and all the
[44:22] house of Israel lamented after the Lord
[44:27] and Samuel spake unto all the house of
[44:29] Israel saying if ye do return unto the
[44:33] Lord with all your hearts then put away
[44:37] the strange gods and asteroth from among
[44:41] you and prepare your hearts unto the
[44:43] Lord and serve him only and he will
[44:46] deliver you out of the land of the
[44:49] Philistines then the children of Israel
[44:51] did put away balam and ASAT and served
[44:55] the Lord Lord
[44:57] only and Samuel said gather all Israel
[45:01] to
[45:02] mesp and I will pray for you unto the
[45:05] Lord now mesp is a city of Benjamin it's
[45:08] a watchtower it's a lookout where the
[45:12] children of Israel will meet in great
[45:14] National emergencies so it's a
[45:17] conference place it's a meeting place
[45:18] it's a high mountain where they meet and
[45:20] they gathered together to mesp and Drew
[45:23] water and poured it out before the Lord
[45:25] and fasted on that day and said there we
[45:28] have sinned against the Lord and Samuel
[45:30] judge the children of Israel in mese and
[45:33] listen carefully and when the
[45:35] Philistines heard that the children of
[45:37] Israel were gathered together to mesp
[45:40] the Lords of the Philistines went up
[45:42] against Israel and when the children of
[45:45] Israel heard it they were afraid of the
[45:48] Philistines and the children of Israel
[45:50] said to Samuel cease not to cry unto the
[45:53] Lord Our God for us that he will save us
[45:55] us out of the hand of the Philistines
[45:58] and Samuel took a sucking lamb and
[46:01] offered it for a burnt offering holy
[46:03] unto the Lord and Samuel Cried unto the
[46:05] Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him
[46:09] and as Samuel was offering up the burnt
[46:11] offering the Philistines Drew near to
[46:14] battle against Israel but the Lord
[46:16] thundered with a great Thunder on that
[46:19] day upon the Philistines and
[46:21] discomforted them and they were smitten
[46:23] before Israel amen and the men of Israel
[46:26] went out of mispah and pursued the
[46:29] Philistines and smoted them until they
[46:31] came unto Peta then Samuel took a stone
[46:35] and set it between mespa and Shen and
[46:38] called the name ezzar saying hitherto
[46:41] had the Lord helped us so the
[46:43] Philistines were subdued and they came
[46:45] no more into the coast of Israel and the
[46:48] Hand of the Lord was against the
[46:50] Philistines all the days of Samuel and
[46:54] the cities listen carefully
[46:56] which the Philistines had taken from
[46:58] Israel were restored to Israel from
[47:01] ekron even unto Gat and the course
[47:04] thereof did Israel deliver out of the
[47:06] hands of the Philistines and there was
[47:08] peace between Israel and the amorites
[47:11] and Samuel judged Israel all the days of
[47:13] his life and he went from year to year
[47:16] in Circuit of bethl and gilgal and mesp
[47:19] and judge Israel in all those places and
[47:22] his return was to Rama for there was his
[47:24] house and there he judge Israel and
[47:26] there he built an altar unto the Lord
[47:28] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[47:29] reading of the word let us bow our heads
[47:31] once more Heavenly Father Lord any man
[47:33] could read the scriptures but Lord it
[47:35] takes the Holy Ghost to breathe life
[47:37] upon it may you speak to our hearts
[47:38] today and open our understanding to the
[47:41] word as we prepare for this convention
[47:43] Lord this last service before the
[47:45] meeting father may we be under
[47:47] expectation may we get our houses in
[47:49] order Lord may we be ready this morning
[47:51] for a great outpouring we commit the
[47:53] service into your hands in the precious
[47:55] name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen and amen
[47:57] you may be seated this
[48:01] morning Hallelujah my my my my my my my
[48:05] my my Something in My Heart hallelujah
[48:10] hallelujah my so for my title this
[48:12] morning all things are
[48:14] ready Let the Fire
[48:17] Fall Hallelujah all things are ready Let
[48:21] the Fire Fall s is this the time for the
[48:24] fire to fall s is this the time for the
[48:26] Holy Ghost to pour out s is this the
[48:29] time for our Revival we have talked
[48:31] about it we have preached about it but I
[48:34] believe this is revival time this is
[48:36] bride time this is seed time this is
[48:39] manifestation time somebody say amen and
[48:42] what does Revival mean it means
[48:45] freedom freedom from the oppression
[48:48] Freedom From The Bondage freedom from
[48:50] your sickness freedom from being up one
[48:53] day and down one day freedom from
[48:55] looking back to your past freedom from
[48:57] wondering what's going to happen the
[48:59] Revival means
[49:01] restoration it means taking back
[49:03] everything the devil took from you
[49:05] doesn't matter how long how much time
[49:07] pass when the Revival breaks out that's
[49:10] your time to get it back it's your time
[49:13] to get back your joy to get back your
[49:15] family to get back your peace to get
[49:18] back what belongs to you you don't hear
[49:20] me this morning the Revival means
[49:23] Redemption it means going back to your
[49:25] original condition back to your original
[49:28] state back to your original Glory
[49:31] because when God saw you he didn't see
[49:33] you in this form he saw you where was
[49:35] down when I laid the foundation of the
[49:38] earth you had a body that didn't get
[49:40] sick you had a body that didn't get
[49:43] tired you had a body that didn't get sad
[49:46] because you were made in His
[49:49] image can the church say Amen the
[49:52] Revival means a super church I'm not
[49:55] talking about headstone Tabernacle I'm
[49:57] talking about Christ's Church I'm
[49:59] talking about his church I'm talking
[50:01] about his bride no wonder but the
[50:03] brandom said a super Church a super race
[50:06] as we near The Headstone he's not
[50:09] talking to your flesh he's not talking
[50:11] to your mistakes he's talking to your
[50:13] genes the genetic structure that comes
[50:16] from God and the Revival is to bring
[50:19] those seeds to life to remind you that
[50:22] you are not from here but you come from
[50:25] somewhere else to remind you that we are
[50:27] one day closer to the Rapture one day
[50:30] closer to the
[50:33] resurrection don't worry Andrew I'm just
[50:35] warming up I'm just testing the
[50:37] temperature a little bit because we are
[50:39] getting ready for something we are
[50:41] getting ready for another Ephesians uh
[50:43] we already in Ephesians but there's
[50:46] another dimension of Ephesians there's
[50:48] another wave that's coming I will ride
[50:50] this Trail once more it's all right to
[50:53] jump uh it's all right to shout uh but
[50:55] there's promis of power to come into the
[50:58] church there's coming a power a
[51:01] supernatural element that still remains
[51:04] uh despite the Revelation that we have
[51:07] held all these years there's a
[51:09] supernatural element that remains uh
[51:12] that could break the chains of the world
[51:14] off for you that you could come into the
[51:16] house of God and in one Service uh you
[51:19] could worship in one service you could
[51:22] shout because who the son of man set
[51:24] free is free
[51:26] indeed hallelujah
[51:29] hallelujah hallelujah a Revival means
[51:32] the Holy Ghost has got to pour out
[51:35] because God has to pour it out because
[51:37] that's how God expresses himself uh
[51:39] because God is a spirit so for him to
[51:41] multiply himself uh he is obligated to
[51:44] pour out the Holy Ghost he said I'm
[51:46] never going to leave you I'm not going
[51:48] to forsake you but I'm going to send
[51:50] another comforter even the spirit of
[51:52] Truth he will come oh
[51:56] Hallelujah my my my my my my my my my
[52:00] are you ready for Revival a Revival
[52:03] means Victory a Revival means no more a
[52:06] Revival means alanas a Revival means
[52:09] dancing like David dance a Revival means
[52:13] singing when it don't have a voice a
[52:15] Revival means speaking in tongues when
[52:18] he you don't hear me the Bible said the
[52:20] dumb will sing they went beyond speaking
[52:23] the Bible said the dumb will sing just
[52:25] talk they're going to sing they're going
[52:27] to shout they're going to
[52:32] worship my my my my what are you doing
[52:36] brother Isaac I'm placing the seeds for
[52:38] what you go about to happen I'm placing
[52:40] the seeds for what you going to expect
[52:43] why because the Revival could only
[52:45] revive the seeds that have been planted
[52:48] so if the seeds are not there there's
[52:50] nothing to revive and if you getting
[52:52] ready for seven Revival there's got to
[52:55] be some seeds inside your soul it could
[52:58] be buried under some dirt this morning I
[53:01] don't care the condition I just got to
[53:03] make sure that the seeds are there
[53:06] because the rain is about to pour out
[53:08] the Holy Ghost is about to pour out it
[53:10] doesn't matter
[53:12] what it doesn't matter what your
[53:15] condition is once the seed is there
[53:18] every seed must bring forth after its
[53:21] kind so if we speak seeds of healing
[53:24] that seed has to bring forth after its
[53:28] time if we speak of seed of Revival that
[53:32] seed
[53:35] must that seed must bring forth you may
[53:39] be seated oh so what are we doing this
[53:43] morning we are making sure that all the
[53:46] seeds are planted we are making sure
[53:49] that all the seeds are in you making
[53:51] sure that you know what to expect so
[53:53] when you come this weekend and the rain
[53:56] begins to fall my my my my my overnight
[54:00] like Aaron's rod in the holies of holies
[54:04] that Rod was just there for one night
[54:06] one night one night in one night by the
[54:10] next morning that Rod was blossoming
[54:14] that Rod had fruit all you need with God
[54:16] is one night one night in the presence
[54:19] of God one night with the angel I'm not
[54:23] going to let you go until you blessed me
[54:26] I'm not going to let you go until my
[54:28] change comes I've come too far I've
[54:32] fought too long I've went too many
[54:34] services I've believed a message for a
[54:37] long time but all I want is one night
[54:40] with
[54:42] Jesus
[54:44] Hallelujah my my my
[54:54] my
[54:56] Hallelujah oldfashioned sin killing sky
[54:59] blue Holy Ghost Revival that's what
[55:01] we're talking about this morning a
[55:04] Revival means that all that Adam lost
[55:06] comes back to the manifested sons of God
[55:09] the whole world is groaning the nation
[55:12] is groaning the trees are groaning the
[55:16] economy is groaning the United Nations
[55:19] is groaning the politicians are groaning
[55:22] Los Angeles is groaning but Los Angeles
[55:25] got to wait on something to happen the
[55:27] trees have to wait on something to
[55:29] happen the politicians have to wait on
[55:32] something to happen they don't know what
[55:34] it is but we know what we worship we
[55:37] know what they are waiting on they are
[55:40] waiting for us some manifested Sons to
[55:43] come back into
[55:52] position Hallelujah you may be seated
[55:56] you see what people fail to understand
[55:58] is that nothing could happen before it
[56:04] time nothing could happen before it time
[56:09] because God is a god of order God is a
[56:12] god of structure one time with the
[56:14] brandom I saw a vision of going to pray
[56:16] for somebody and he went to the house
[56:17] and he prayed and I believe the baby got
[56:19] sick or something like that and he
[56:21] realized that he went ahead of the
[56:23] vision that there was a old lady who had
[56:25] to be there in the vision and he had to
[56:27] wait until she came and her glasses had
[56:29] to be in a certain spot and she had to
[56:31] be seated in a certain spot because that
[56:34] was in the vision despite the fact that
[56:37] he was the prophet he could not go ahead
[56:40] of the vision because the vision is for
[56:42] an appointed time do it t wait for it
[56:46] you can rush it you could pray all you
[56:49] want to you could hold on all you want
[56:51] to but the vision is for an appointed
[56:54] time and the prophetic Vision as laid
[56:57] down by Malachi 4 is for an appointed
[57:00] time it cannot happen before it cannot
[57:04] happen after but when the appointed time
[57:07] has come it has to happen and I believe
[57:10] we have come down to the appointed time
[57:14] for the bright 7th under
[57:18] Revival oh
[57:20] Hallelujah I feel like seei on this
[57:22] morning I'm under expectation
[57:25] because I have a promise I'm not going
[57:27] to see death until I see the Lost Christ
[57:30] and although Simeon was old he held on
[57:33] to his promise he had been a Believer
[57:35] for a long time but he held on to that
[57:38] promise because God spoke to him and I
[57:40] believe if you're here this morning it's
[57:42] because God spoke to you because you
[57:44] couldn't come this morning unless God
[57:46] draw you first so I believe this morning
[57:49] that we are here because we have a
[57:51] revelation that there's a power coming
[57:53] to the church and that now it's coming
[57:55] in h spoken word power Redemption power
[57:59] healing power it's coming into the
[58:01] church it's been here all along in word
[58:04] form but now the ministry of the spirit
[58:07] the Dynamics is all over you this
[58:09] morning can the church say
[58:13] amen
[58:16] hallelujah
[58:17] hallelujah
[58:19] hallelujah my my my my my so Simeon he
[58:23] knew that Christ was coming so he
[58:26] couldn't see Christ in his house he
[58:28] couldn't see Christ in the shop he
[58:30] couldn't see Christ in the grocery he
[58:32] couldn't see Christ in his bedroom he
[58:34] knew that Christ had to come to the
[58:35] temple so he made it his business every
[58:38] service he was there at the temple and
[58:40] he was getting a great joy every service
[58:43] because he knew that Christ had to come
[58:45] to the temple there was no other way
[58:47] about it so every service that passed he
[58:51] felt better about himself because he
[58:53] knew the god that spoke to him does not
[58:55] lie he knew the God who spoke to him is
[58:58] a god of his word he knew the god that
[59:01] spoke to him doesn't make any mistakes
[59:03] he had a promise and every service he
[59:06] will come is this the day is this the
[59:09] day and he will be waiting is this the
[59:11] day is this the day is this the day is
[59:15] this my day is this my day that was
[59:19] Simeon he was under expectation he was
[59:22] never late because he didn't want to
[59:24] miss messah he never left early because
[59:26] he didn't want to miss Messiah he wanted
[59:29] to be there for every minute because he
[59:31] knew Messiah had to come to the temple
[59:34] and I believe this morning there's
[59:36] somebody in the building who knows that
[59:38] Messiah is in the temple this
[59:44] morning Hallelujah I'm just laying a
[59:47] foundation this
[59:48] morning hallelu Hallelujah
[59:53] gory so what do you looking for this
[59:55] morning this is not about being in
[59:57] church it's not about a group and the
[1:00:00] more that I look at the word is the more
[1:00:03] I see that people have missed the fact
[1:00:07] that it's an individual
[1:00:11] Affair you have to come to the
[1:00:13] convention and it must be about
[1:00:17] you let me say that again I'm not saying
[1:00:20] don't pray for your brother don't pray
[1:00:21] for your sister but it must be about you
[1:00:24] because you got to make sure you get
[1:00:26] your portion don't you leave without
[1:00:29] your portion every service you come it
[1:00:31] must be about your portion you have to
[1:00:34] be selfish about your portion you have
[1:00:37] to be aggressive about your portion
[1:00:43] because the Bible said the law and the
[1:00:46] prophets were until John but since that
[1:00:48] time the kingdom is preached and every
[1:00:51] church every group know the Bible says
[1:00:55] Every Man Press into it friend or no
[1:00:59] friend group or no group church or no
[1:01:02] church but every man makes it his
[1:01:05] business to press past doubt to press
[1:01:09] past fear to press past what people say
[1:01:12] about you why because you want to see
[1:01:14] the prophecy fulfilled can the church
[1:01:17] say
[1:01:19] Amen you may be
[1:01:21] seated amen amen my my my my my so
[1:01:26] Simeon had a revelation yes that he will
[1:01:30] not see death until he see the Lord's
[1:01:33] Christ and we have a revelation that we
[1:01:36] going to get the Holy Ghost we have a
[1:01:38] revelation of a perfect church we have a
[1:01:41] revelation of a super church we have a
[1:01:44] revelation of individuals that are being
[1:01:46] called out to form POS of The Headstone
[1:01:49] to connect with the Corporal body we
[1:01:51] have a revelation of a time of honing of
[1:01:53] a time of of shaping we want it because
[1:01:56] we have a revelation can the church say
[1:01:59] amen and Revelation puts you in a mode
[1:02:02] for Preparation because you are under
[1:02:06] expectation you cannot tell me you are
[1:02:08] expecting something and not making
[1:02:11] preparation for it you are lying to me
[1:02:13] but if you are expecting something then
[1:02:16] you will start to make preparations for
[1:02:19] it can the church say
[1:02:21] amen and brother Bram said in influence
[1:02:24] we know the quote but I want to make
[1:02:25] sure we have it what we have seen happen
[1:02:27] over all these years should put every
[1:02:29] soul into action it should make a church
[1:02:32] that would make a Revival here in
[1:02:34] Trinidad we got to say it right that
[1:02:37] people would fly in from Europe to see
[1:02:39] what taking place they'd say there's a
[1:02:41] place in Trinidad a city called sangri
[1:02:44] Grandy we got to claim it we got to
[1:02:46] speak it every church has every right to
[1:02:48] claim it I'm claiming it for this church
[1:02:50] that's my responsibility can the church
[1:02:52] say Amen there's something broke out
[1:02:55] there until the seven thunders of
[1:02:57] Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in
[1:03:00] the Bible is being manifested can the
[1:03:02] church say
[1:03:06] Amen from the message it is the rising
[1:03:09] of the sun brother brandom said there's
[1:03:11] been churches churches Brides brides
[1:03:13] churches Brides brides but there has got
[1:03:15] to come one Hallelujah there's got to
[1:03:18] come a real bride there must come one
[1:03:21] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:03:24] Dynamic so in other words the
[1:03:26] identification of a true church is not
[1:03:28] the pastor it's not what you believe the
[1:03:32] identification of that real bride is got
[1:03:36] the mechanics and the
[1:03:40] Dynamics let me say that again so the
[1:03:43] true church is not identified by your
[1:03:45] Doctrine it's not identified by your
[1:03:47] teaching it's identified by mechanics
[1:03:50] and Dynamics because the Dynamics could
[1:03:53] only come to confirm the mechanics amen
[1:03:57] the Dynamics cannot come upon anything
[1:03:59] else other than the mechanics can the
[1:04:02] church say Amen makes the church live
[1:04:04] move in the power of his
[1:04:07] resurrection
[1:04:09] my from the fourth seed God's word sharp
[1:04:12] two-edged sword slays him puts him right
[1:04:14] down wait till them seven tunders utter
[1:04:17] their voices to that group who can
[1:04:20] really take the word of God and hand it
[1:04:22] there it'll slice and cut they can close
[1:04:25] the heavens they can shut this or do
[1:04:27] that whatever they want to Glory why are
[1:04:29] you saying this but is it because there
[1:04:31] are people who still don't believe this
[1:04:34] and they in the message and the people
[1:04:35] sitting in church who happy to be in
[1:04:37] church but they don't own a word so that
[1:04:39] Revival that we're talking about must be
[1:04:41] clearly identified because you cannot be
[1:04:44] part of a 700 Revival if you don't know
[1:04:46] what it
[1:04:48] is if you don't know what's the promise
[1:04:50] if you don't know what we are doing can
[1:04:52] the church say amen amen so a Revival is
[1:04:56] to revive the seed that planted in you
[1:04:59] so the seeds had to be planted the devil
[1:05:01] knows this so his only move was to plant
[1:05:05] seeds of
[1:05:06] error but the bride cannot be deceived I
[1:05:09] thank God we have a revelation of say
[1:05:12] what the tapes say so God had to wait
[1:05:15] for all these years until all things are
[1:05:17] ready because only when all things are
[1:05:20] ready the fire could fall can the Church
[1:05:22] Say Amen
[1:05:25] from the message condemnation by
[1:05:26] representation brother bam said no
[1:05:28] wonder God can't send a Revival he's got
[1:05:31] nothing to build it on then he'll take
[1:05:35] individuals and build it on them
[1:05:37] individuals let me say that again he
[1:05:40] will take individuals and build it on
[1:05:43] them individuals and declare them before
[1:05:46] the world who stay with that word amen
[1:05:50] so it's only individuals I'm talking to
[1:05:52] this morning amen and and situations
[1:05:55] have come and will come to see if there
[1:05:58] would be individuals who would stay with
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:05] word and I've said this before Paul was
[1:06:08] very clear Hallelujah because but over
[1:06:11] and I were having a conversation this
[1:06:13] morning and in speaking we he used the
[1:06:15] word you must be more sincere and I said
[1:06:17] you know that's that's one side of it
[1:06:20] because there are people who are
[1:06:21] sincerely wrong that's right yes yes yes
[1:06:24] yes yes amen amen so you see people they
[1:06:28] go to church and they worship and they
[1:06:29] shout and they jump and they are sincere
[1:06:32] believing that what they are worshiping
[1:06:35] and shouting and is the
[1:06:38] truth they are sincerely
[1:06:40] wrong so being sincere is not enough you
[1:06:45] have to be sincere about what's right
[1:06:48] and it's not about what's right for you
[1:06:51] it's about what's right for God there's
[1:06:54] a
[1:06:56] difference because God wants his word
[1:06:59] interpreted his
[1:07:02] way brother Brandon preacher God is his
[1:07:05] own interpreter you ever heard that
[1:07:07] before now whenever you have somebody
[1:07:09] interpreting a language if you takeing
[1:07:12] English to Spanish or to French or to
[1:07:14] another language there are different
[1:07:16] kinds of interpretation there are
[1:07:19] different words that you could use to
[1:07:20] express it and still don't get the
[1:07:24] original meaning so it's always a
[1:07:26] blessing to see somebody preach who is
[1:07:28] bilingual because sometime the
[1:07:30] translator says something and he says no
[1:07:32] no no no no no no and he corrects the
[1:07:35] translator because he wants to make sure
[1:07:37] what he is communicating is getting to
[1:07:39] the people so God is
[1:07:43] multilingual and he is his own
[1:07:45] interpreter so when he is speaking he is
[1:07:48] confirming his own
[1:07:51] word are you with me this morning
[1:07:54] because God listen man always have good
[1:07:57] ideas you know come on I told young
[1:07:59] people sometime ago I have great ideas
[1:08:02] but whether my ideas are in God's plans
[1:08:04] is a different story but God is his own
[1:08:07] interpreter and only God can vindicate
[1:08:10] his word we cannot vindicate his word he
[1:08:13] has to vindicate his
[1:08:15] word he is the one doing the work you
[1:08:18] know we are not the ones he is the one
[1:08:20] to confirm the work but the B said if
[1:08:23] God is to do anything anything it's by
[1:08:24] the grace of
[1:08:25] God because he is Sovereign it's his
[1:08:28] grace no wonder the headstone will come
[1:08:31] with shoutings crying Grace Grace Grace
[1:08:34] Grace because if it was how much time
[1:08:36] and how you do this and that half of you
[1:08:38] not going to make it but it's the grace
[1:08:40] of God that you could be called to a
[1:08:42] seventh under seven SE revival can the
[1:08:45] church say
[1:08:49] Amen so I want to touch on something
[1:08:52] here
[1:08:52] because
[1:08:55] in what hearest thou
[1:08:57] Elijah but the B say we can
[1:09:00] testify and jump up and down and sing
[1:09:04] and everything like
[1:09:05] that but until God makes us in such a
[1:09:11] condition till we can recognize one
[1:09:14] another as brothers until all malice
[1:09:18] Envy strife and everything's gone out of
[1:09:22] us our jump in shouting praising God
[1:09:28] organizing speaking in tongues Healing
[1:09:31] The Sick even going to signs and wonders
[1:09:34] and Performing Miracles and everything
[1:09:37] else will never amount to
[1:09:41] nothing let me read that one more time
[1:09:44] but BR said we can testify and jump up
[1:09:48] and down and sing and everything like
[1:09:51] that but until God
[1:09:54] makes us in such a condition till we can
[1:09:58] recognize one another as brothers until
[1:10:01] all malice Envy strife and everything's
[1:10:06] gone out of us our jumping shouting
[1:10:11] praising God organizing having
[1:10:14] conventions speaking in tongues and
[1:10:17] healing the
[1:10:18] sick but Bram lays it out flat he said
[1:10:21] the sick could be healed
[1:10:24] Miracles could be performed it will
[1:10:26] never amount to nothing until there's
[1:10:30] love because charity will never
[1:10:38] fail you may be
[1:10:42] seated so I've heard people talk about
[1:10:44] how much jumping and how much shouting
[1:10:46] and how much testimonies and you can't
[1:10:48] forgive your brother nothing I don't
[1:10:50] want to hear it oh you don't hear me
[1:10:52] this morning I don't care how much
[1:10:54] jumping jump on one foot jump on the
[1:10:57] other foot jump on both feet jump on
[1:10:59] tiptoe and you can't love and you got
[1:11:01] jealousy take that testimony and go and
[1:11:04] Pray Again take that testimony go back
[1:11:07] to the
[1:11:08] altar give me charity because jumping
[1:11:11] will fail knowledge will
[1:11:14] fail that's what Paul taught us and Paul
[1:11:17] said If any man any Angel preach
[1:11:19] anything else let him be a curse I'm
[1:11:22] preaching what Paul preached and William
[1:11:24] Brandon preach what Paul
[1:11:29] preached Hallelujah you may be seated so
[1:11:33] God's thermometer is not measuring your
[1:11:36] shouting and your testimony and how long
[1:11:39] you're in the message his thermometer is
[1:11:41] a love thermometer because God is love
[1:11:44] that's what he identifies with and love
[1:11:47] forgives and love hugs your brother lugs
[1:11:50] have no oughts love has no grudges love
[1:11:53] loves the fellowship love loves the
[1:11:55] Brethren oh you don't hear me this
[1:11:57] morning that's the seven T
[1:12:09] Revival
[1:12:11] hallelujah
[1:12:12] hallelujah we have to keep the main
[1:12:14] thing the main
[1:12:16] thing
[1:12:18] amen because it will amount to nothing
[1:12:21] if the right foundation is not set
[1:12:23] people have all kind of testimonies you
[1:12:25] know how many people wrote tremendous
[1:12:27] testimonies over the years and they're
[1:12:28] not in
[1:12:31] church you can't see them you can't hear
[1:12:34] from them you when you say God bless you
[1:12:36] they say how you
[1:12:39] doing because it was not a real
[1:12:41] experience there was no testimony and
[1:12:44] they never met God because God is
[1:12:50] love brother K said paper testimonies
[1:12:53] but what we want is a lived voice you
[1:12:56] don't even need to write it brother
[1:12:57] Raymond you don't need to even tell
[1:12:59] somebody but the it speaks for
[1:13:03] it you don't need to publicize it you
[1:13:05] don't need to put an announcement about
[1:13:07] it you just walk and devil have to fly
[1:13:09] off the corner fly off the walls because
[1:13:12] that's what Jesus is he's love so when
[1:13:14] he's walking all the demons have to
[1:13:16] scatter because l o v is walking down
[1:13:20] and that's what we need that's what we
[1:13:22] need in Jeffersonville that's what we
[1:13:24] need in Trinidad that's what we need
[1:13:26] around the world lived
[1:13:29] voices that's the Thunder that shakes
[1:13:32] the
[1:13:35] devil can the church say Amen what are
[1:13:38] we preaching this morning we are in
[1:13:39] another Ephesians that's what Ephesians
[1:13:41] say you will understand you will know
[1:13:44] where you come from you will know where
[1:13:45] you're going you will know what your
[1:13:47] promise is
[1:13:50] amen hallelujah hallah let me drop this
[1:13:54] in here I didn't plan to do this today
[1:13:56] but I was meditating and I shared it
[1:13:58] with my wife I shared it with brother
[1:13:59] over as well I said we read Ephesians
[1:14:01] six put on the whole armor of God and
[1:14:03] people shout and they jump and it's
[1:14:09] wonderful Hallelujah but that scripture
[1:14:12] sort of makes people assume that they
[1:14:14] have no armor
[1:14:16] on because to put on the armor you can't
[1:14:20] put the armor of God on top of your own
[1:14:24] armor
[1:14:28] am so to put on the armor of God you got
[1:14:30] to take
[1:14:32] off your
[1:14:35] armor because an armor is meant to
[1:14:38] defend you it's meant to protect you and
[1:14:40] people come to church with their armor
[1:14:42] to protect
[1:14:43] them they don't want to talk to nobody
[1:14:46] they don't want to greet nobody they
[1:14:48] don't want no problems with nobody they
[1:14:50] don't want nobody tell them anything
[1:14:51] because this is how I am that's your
[1:14:53] armor you are protected there's no room
[1:14:56] for the armor of the Lord because you
[1:14:58] have your own protection I've been this
[1:15:00] way for 10 years that's your armor this
[1:15:02] is how I worship that's your armor this
[1:15:05] is how I used to do it I've been in the
[1:15:07] message for 20 years you have your own
[1:15:12] armor but for you to put on the armor of
[1:15:14] God you got to
[1:15:17] strip
[1:15:18] everything your feelings your Revelation
[1:15:22] people have re that they give
[1:15:24] themselves strip your God didn't give it
[1:15:27] to you because his revelation will only
[1:15:30] confirm the
[1:15:33] word you holding on to Revelation that
[1:15:35] is off the word and telling me God give
[1:15:37] it no God doesn't lie and God is not the
[1:15:40] author of
[1:15:42] confusion he is God and he loves things
[1:15:44] to be clear he's a god of clarity so he
[1:15:47] wants you to leave here with a clear
[1:15:49] purpose a Clear Vision a clear plan of
[1:15:53] what what you are supposed to receive
[1:15:54] that fire is going to come down in your
[1:15:56] soul and burn the snake out of there
[1:15:59] that he could Tabernacle himself behind
[1:16:01] 16 elements somebody say
[1:16:08] amen I want to read this quote one more
[1:16:11] time because I think a lot of people
[1:16:13] missed it
[1:16:15] Hallelujah we can testify and jump up
[1:16:18] and down and sing and everything like
[1:16:21] that but until
[1:16:23] God makes us in such a condition Lord
[1:16:26] make me into that condition till we
[1:16:29] could recognize one another as brothers
[1:16:31] not your church my church your ad
[1:16:33] Doctrine my church your pastor your
[1:16:35] until all malice Envy strife and
[1:16:39] everything's gone out of you our jumping
[1:16:42] shouting praising God organizing
[1:16:45] speaking in tongues and healing the sick
[1:16:47] and Performing Miracles and everything
[1:16:49] else will never amount to nothing amen
[1:16:52] amen Lord help us to be sincere about
[1:16:55] the right thing brother the brandom said
[1:16:58] if there's a ought in your heart against
[1:16:59] anyone sinner or saint sinner or Saint
[1:17:03] you are in danger of
[1:17:08] Hellfire he didn't ask how much books
[1:17:10] you read how much Revelation how much
[1:17:12] Visions or dreams he said there one out
[1:17:15] against a sinner or Saint you are in
[1:17:17] danger of
[1:17:18] Hellfire but I thank God for a
[1:17:20] revelation of the blood I thank God and
[1:17:24] when he looks at us he sees through the
[1:17:26] blood and if because of the blood he
[1:17:28] could forgive us then we have no reason
[1:17:30] to hold anything we could
[1:17:32] forgive because forgiveness is the key
[1:17:35] to Faith is the key to the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] pouring out if you get every ought every
[1:17:40] Grudge every malice Envy out of here you
[1:17:42] know what's going to happen in 5
[1:17:45] minutes there' be not one sick person
[1:17:47] inside the building in five minutes
[1:17:50] there' be not one person Desiring the
[1:17:53] baptism of the Holy
[1:17:56] Ghost Oh My My
[1:18:00] My from a message of blushing Prophet
[1:18:02] what we need today is not social
[1:18:05] regeneration it's not intellectual talks
[1:18:07] what we need today is a
[1:18:10] oldfashioned God sent blood transfusion
[1:18:13] from Heaven the corn plasters won't do
[1:18:16] no good we are anemia we need a blood
[1:18:18] transfusion we need to come back to the
[1:18:21] oldfashioned gospel that calls out for
[1:18:24] repentance before God and not a drye
[1:18:27] hand shook profession but a God sent
[1:18:30] Holy Ghost Revival with the possession
[1:18:33] of the cleansing of the blood of the
[1:18:34] Lord Jesus Christ into every human heart
[1:18:38] we need a Revival to start in the church
[1:18:41] and sweep the nation across we'll die
[1:18:43] we'll perish we are gone without that
[1:18:45] type of Revival amen why are you saying
[1:18:49] this brother
[1:18:51] Isaac because if we don't clean up
[1:18:55] before the convention you will not get
[1:18:57] out of the convention what you want to
[1:18:59] get out of the
[1:19:08] convention there's some stuff that you
[1:19:11] have to
[1:19:12] do because God is not coming down to our
[1:19:15] level brother brandom said we have to
[1:19:17] come to his
[1:19:20] level you will be in a service and see
[1:19:22] other people blessed because you didn't
[1:19:24] do your part am can the church say amen
[1:19:27] amen so let me jump to the text this
[1:19:29] morning in first Samuel 7 we see that
[1:19:32] Israel is at a place where they need
[1:19:35] Revival amen by 1 Samuel seven they had
[1:19:39] been attacked they had been overcome and
[1:19:42] they had been defeated by the enemies
[1:19:45] the Philistines amen and in reading
[1:19:47] through the scripture we talked about
[1:19:49] the amalekites they pray on weakness
[1:19:50] they are the Hittites the hites they
[1:19:52] different ones the Philistines are a
[1:19:54] unique breed because but the brandom
[1:19:56] typed the Philistines as the personal
[1:20:00] demons so we're not talking about what
[1:20:03] other people do in you we're not talking
[1:20:05] about you falling out with a brother
[1:20:07] we're talking about the personal
[1:20:09] demons the ones that you carry with you
[1:20:12] wherever you go your personal struggles
[1:20:15] your personal battles and he says it'll
[1:20:18] take the adopted Sons take the pillar of
[1:20:21] fire to drive the Philistines isn't that
[1:20:23] the word
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] amen so the children of Israel found
[1:20:29] themselves in bondage of the
[1:20:33] Philistines after they had wor through
[1:20:36] Egypt and come out of Egypt and come
[1:20:38] through the Red Sea and going through
[1:20:41] Jericho and had Victory after Victory
[1:20:43] and their ups and downs here it was like
[1:20:46] a cycle the children of Israel are now
[1:20:48] in bondage of the
[1:20:51] Philistines and and as a result of this
[1:20:54] the Philistines had taken possession of
[1:20:57] the Ark of the
[1:21:00] Covenant the sacred Ark of the Covenant
[1:21:03] which held among other things the
[1:21:05] tablets upon which The Ten Commandments
[1:21:08] were written on when Moses went to the
[1:21:10] Mount and met with God it was this Ark
[1:21:13] of the Covenant that would go before
[1:21:15] them in battle yes that's right to cross
[1:21:19] to Jericho Joshua's instruction will let
[1:21:21] the Levites walk in the
[1:21:24] ark the ark had to go forth first give
[1:21:28] it room because it is sacred it's
[1:21:33] holy
[1:21:35] Hallelujah the Ark of the Covenant was
[1:21:38] known throughout Israel and
[1:21:41] Beyond but during this time in Samuel
[1:21:45] that we read Eli was the high priest and
[1:21:48] if you read scripture Eli was a corrupt
[1:21:50] high priest his son run a mock through
[1:21:53] the church doing all kind of fil and
[1:21:56] foolishness and God was so
[1:22:00] displeased and God had to raise up
[1:22:06] Samuel Eli was so out of the spirit that
[1:22:09] when God was talking to Samuel and
[1:22:11] Samuel ran to Eli Eli was no I wasn't
[1:22:13] calling you and they went back and forth
[1:22:15] but God had a purpose with
[1:22:17] Samuel because Eli's time was
[1:22:21] over
[1:22:24] at abzar the Philistines had defeated
[1:22:27] Israel in 1st Samuel 4 and the
[1:22:30] Philistines put themselves in Array
[1:22:32] against Israel and when they joined
[1:22:34] battle Israel was smitten before the
[1:22:36] Philistines and they slew of the Army in
[1:22:39] the field about 4,
[1:22:41] thousands so when Israel were defeated
[1:22:44] the Israelites fetched the ark out of
[1:22:46] Shiloh and carried it into the camp they
[1:22:49] were not living right but they tried to
[1:22:51] bring the ark yes the word and try to
[1:22:54] bring it as a as a PCH to their problems
[1:22:57] and once again the Philistines attacked
[1:23:00] Israel and smold them with a very great
[1:23:03] Slaughter and
[1:23:05] 30,000 of the children of Israel died
[1:23:09] and in 1 Samuel 4 the Ark of the
[1:23:11] Covenant was taken
[1:23:12] away when Eli heard
[1:23:16] this that his sons had been killed in
[1:23:20] battle Eli fell backward and broke his
[1:23:24] neck shortly thereafter Eli's daughter
[1:23:27] went into labor and died after giving
[1:23:29] birth and in 1st Samuel 4:21 before she
[1:23:33] died she gave the child the name ikabod
[1:23:36] which means where is the
[1:23:39] glory and she said for Israel's glory is
[1:23:42] gone Hallelujah and she named him thus
[1:23:44] because the Ark of God had been carried
[1:23:47] and because her father-in-law and her
[1:23:49] husband were dead so the children of
[1:23:51] Israel were trying to understand how
[1:23:54] things could go wrong when they had the
[1:23:56] ark back into the
[1:24:00] battlefield and at this point the
[1:24:02] enemies of God possess the Ark of the
[1:24:05] Covenant they possess the sacred Scrolls
[1:24:07] they possess the most valuable treasure
[1:24:10] that the Israelites
[1:24:12] possess but they will find that trying
[1:24:14] to handle the word when you're not
[1:24:16] supposed to be handling the word will
[1:24:18] bring you more harm than
[1:24:20] good from 1 Samuel five Affliction came
[1:24:24] to the
[1:24:26] Philistines they placed the Ark of the
[1:24:28] Covenant next to the idol of deeon in
[1:24:32] deon's Temple and a couple days later by
[1:24:35] the pop World deeon fell face down
[1:24:38] before the
[1:24:39] ark the heads and hands of the idol was
[1:24:42] broken and lying in the
[1:24:46] doorway the people of ashdod when the
[1:24:49] ark was around them the in the nearby
[1:24:51] Villages they were a inflicted with
[1:24:53] humors because you can't take something
[1:24:56] sacred and leave it among people that
[1:24:58] are
[1:24:59] Unholy the children of Israel were
[1:25:02] backslid but it was still God's Ark of
[1:25:04] the Covenant you can't mishandle the
[1:25:07] word and try to do what you want with
[1:25:09] the
[1:25:15] word so the moment these things had to
[1:25:17] happened those of the Philistine but the
[1:25:19] Terry who had the ark say take the ark
[1:25:21] away from him
[1:25:23] send it to another Philistine City
[1:25:25] because this Ark brother the Thompson is
[1:25:27] causing problems they moved the ark to
[1:25:30] the to to gath and at GTH the Lord
[1:25:33] struck them with a plague of
[1:25:36] tumors so they start to move the ark
[1:25:40] from God to the town of
[1:25:42] ekran and the Bible says on the way to
[1:25:45] ekron the children of is of eon saw it
[1:25:48] coming I said don't bring it
[1:25:51] here don't bring the ark
[1:25:54] here send it back to Israel because we
[1:25:57] can't handle it too much fire too much
[1:26:02] anointing too much word too much
[1:26:05] promises we can't identify with that
[1:26:09] send the ark back we should have never
[1:26:11] take it and that's how the devil is
[1:26:14] going to be concerning your
[1:26:16] promises give them back the joy give
[1:26:19] them back the peace give them back their
[1:26:21] promise
[1:26:22] it doesn't belong to us it belongs to
[1:26:29] them you may be
[1:26:32] seated who did that God is his own
[1:26:35] enforcer so you think the devil took
[1:26:37] your joy and peace and God not doing
[1:26:40] something about
[1:26:41] it God will force the issue you're going
[1:26:44] to see your joy just coming back you
[1:26:46] don't know why you're so happy but the
[1:26:48] devil can't hold your joy it's too
[1:26:51] holy the joy of the Lord is your
[1:26:53] strength he don't know what to do with
[1:26:55] it it's your strength it's got to come
[1:26:58] back to
[1:27:02] you you may be
[1:27:05] seated so when the villagers of
[1:27:08] Arron came outside the city brother
[1:27:11] punch with their placards and they
[1:27:14] started to protest we don't want the ark
[1:27:17] we don't want the
[1:27:20] ark the time were forced to drop the ark
[1:27:25] right outside the Israelites and just
[1:27:27] run away because they didn't want
[1:27:28] nothing to do with
[1:27:33] it and the Ark was taken we read in the
[1:27:36] scripture to car jerim which is about 7
[1:27:39] and 1 half miles Northwest of
[1:27:42] Jerusalem and there the ark remained in
[1:27:44] the house of abinadab and was guarded by
[1:27:47] his son
[1:27:48] Eleazar and now we arrived to chapter 7
[1:27:51] and that's where I want to really come
[1:27:52] to this morning because now we have an
[1:27:55] interesting turn of events Israel had
[1:27:57] backslid they lost the ark because of
[1:28:00] their backslid condition and now God
[1:28:03] restores the ark now the ark is a type
[1:28:06] of the word the type of the Lord the
[1:28:08] type of The Commandments but now the ark
[1:28:10] is restored and when we read Samuel 7
[1:28:14] they have been holding the ark for seven
[1:28:17] for 20
[1:28:19] years for 20 years it's been restored
[1:28:22] for 20 years the ark has been in their
[1:28:24] holding brother the kangali but there's
[1:28:27] no
[1:28:28] joy in the
[1:28:30] camp there's no
[1:28:32] Revival in the camp for 20 years they
[1:28:35] have the books and the tapes and Arc is
[1:28:38] in place under lock and key the billers
[1:28:40] and the caretakers let me read it I
[1:28:43] don't want you to think I'm making this
[1:28:45] stuff
[1:28:46] up Hallelujah and the men of karum came
[1:28:51] and fetch up that's 1st Samuel 7:1 the
[1:28:53] Ark of the Lord and brought it into the
[1:28:55] house of abinadab in the hill this is a
[1:28:58] place of safety and Sanctified Eleazar
[1:29:01] his son laid hands on the brother to
[1:29:04] keep the Ark of the
[1:29:08] Lord and it came to pass while the ark
[1:29:11] in Karim that the time was
[1:29:14] long for it was 20 years and all the
[1:29:17] house of Israel lamented after the Lord
[1:29:21] so when the T the word has been restored
[1:29:24] the ark has been restored the builders
[1:29:27] and the cakers have it on the lock and
[1:29:29] key but there's no Revival there's no
[1:29:31] outpouring there's no manifestation and
[1:29:33] the people are crying and the people are
[1:29:35] sighing because they know something else
[1:29:37] is missing despite the word despite the
[1:29:40] Revelation a supernatural element still
[1:29:43] remain they have the ark they are in
[1:29:46] their land but there's no joy there's no
[1:29:49] peace there's no Victory they don't have
[1:29:52] all that is there the Philistines
[1:29:54] oppressing them they up one day and they
[1:29:56] down one day and they crying Lord for 20
[1:29:59] years now it's been restored but where
[1:30:02] is the god who delivered the children of
[1:30:05] Israel out of Egypt but where is the god
[1:30:08] who delivered Jericho into our hands can
[1:30:11] the church say
[1:30:16] amen hallelujah
[1:30:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:23] and Samuel spake unto all the house of
[1:30:26] Israel saying if you do return to the
[1:30:28] Lord with all your hearts then put away
[1:30:31] the strange gods and asot from among you
[1:30:34] and prepare your hearts unto the Lord
[1:30:36] and serve him only he will deliver you
[1:30:39] out of the hands of the Philistines then
[1:30:42] the children of Israel did put away Bim
[1:30:45] and ASAT to see it here now the word was
[1:30:47] restored but they were still
[1:30:49] fellowshipping with b and still
[1:30:51] fellowshipping with with ASAT and still
[1:30:53] playing around with the world and still
[1:30:55] doing worldly things but then the Bible
[1:30:57] said the children of Israel put away bam
[1:31:00] and ASAT have you put away the unclean
[1:31:03] things in your house have you put away
[1:31:05] the unclean things in your life and they
[1:31:07] serve the Lord
[1:31:12] only but that wasn't
[1:31:15] all after they put it
[1:31:17] away Samuel said gather all Israel to
[1:31:21] mespa amen and I will pray for you unto
[1:31:24] the Lord and that's why I said this
[1:31:26] morning this morning is our mper because
[1:31:29] before the convention we want to pray
[1:31:31] unto the Lord that he restore that he
[1:31:35] deliver that he cleans up so that when
[1:31:38] you walk into the convention you are
[1:31:40] walking in Heavenly places and before
[1:31:42] the convention is over your son is
[1:31:45] walking in your daughter is walking in
[1:31:47] what is that it's your land being
[1:31:49] restored because we are into battle
[1:31:55] listen skipping now a few verses and
[1:31:57] when the Philistines heard that the
[1:31:59] children of Israel were gathered
[1:32:01] together to misper the Lords of the
[1:32:03] Philistines went up against Israel
[1:32:05] because the devil knows whenever you
[1:32:06] come to church there always a
[1:32:08] possibility that that day is your
[1:32:09] breakthrough day that a word will be
[1:32:11] spoken to set you free completely and
[1:32:14] that you could do what you have never
[1:32:15] done before but I love this the children
[1:32:18] of Israel said to Samuel seek not to cry
[1:32:20] to the Lord for God Our God for us that
[1:32:23] he will save us out of the hands of the
[1:32:25] Philistines and as Samuel was offering
[1:32:28] up the burnt offering the Philistines
[1:32:30] Drew near to battle against Israel but
[1:32:33] the Lord thundered with a great Thunder
[1:32:35] on that day upon the Philistines and
[1:32:38] discomforted them and they were smitten
[1:32:40] before Israel and I believe right now
[1:32:42] that's happening right now through his
[1:32:44] word God is thundering thundering to the
[1:32:47] Philistines thundering to your personal
[1:32:49] demons thundering to doubt and to fear
[1:32:52] and to unbelief and to push them back
[1:32:55] and the Bible say the Philistine were
[1:32:56] subdued and they came no more to the
[1:33:00] course of
[1:33:01] Israel in other words after this Victory
[1:33:04] the T the Philistines have no more room
[1:33:06] because it's all restored to you your
[1:33:08] joy is restored your family is restored
[1:33:11] your inheritance is restored your land
[1:33:13] is
[1:33:15] restored no room for the devil
[1:33:17] restoration time Holy Ghost time revival
[1:33:21] time can the church say
[1:33:27] amen and they push back the
[1:33:31] enemy so friends that's a condition it
[1:33:34] takes for a real Revival amen these were
[1:33:38] God's chosen people and God didn't
[1:33:40] create a shortcut for them that's right
[1:33:43] they had to cry they had to seek they
[1:33:47] had to pray they had to clean up they
[1:33:50] had to put away the ungodly
[1:33:58] things but the B said and any man that
[1:34:00] believes God and takes him at his word
[1:34:04] no matter what the situation is God will
[1:34:08] perform another Paradox to keep his
[1:34:12] word so when Samuel was speaking to the
[1:34:14] house of Israel Samuel was God's man
[1:34:18] Samuel had been chosen for a specific
[1:34:21] task
[1:34:23] and we have received a prophet who was
[1:34:25] chosen for a specific task and we have
[1:34:28] the word we have the promise now what
[1:34:31] are we doing about it there must be a
[1:34:33] realization this morning that we have to
[1:34:36] return unto God not just in word but in
[1:34:39] sighing and in crying and repenting
[1:34:41] there must be a removal of all the
[1:34:44] strange gods in our
[1:34:48] lives how much time we spend on the job
[1:34:51] how much time with of our family it's a
[1:34:52] real thing friends it might sound simple
[1:34:55] but what good is it to come and jump and
[1:34:57] shout and then go back and do the same
[1:34:59] thing you did before because a change
[1:35:02] has to come that's right how long will
[1:35:04] you come to church and go back home
[1:35:06] without a real change when you have the
[1:35:09] opportunity today to go and sin no more
[1:35:11] because the angel of the Lord is here to
[1:35:14] meet you at the point of your
[1:35:16] need I'm not talking about a Revival as
[1:35:19] a church now I'm talking about you as a
[1:35:21] an individual in your personal Revival
[1:35:25] your personal prayer closet your
[1:35:27] personal time with God knowing that
[1:35:30] every day that you spend crying and
[1:35:32] sighing you are pushing back to works of
[1:35:34] the
[1:35:35] enemy I'm not talking about worrying and
[1:35:37] fing I'm talking about a real
[1:35:39] oldfashioned Lord God I need you this
[1:35:42] morning that's the condition that God is
[1:35:45] looking for to say all things are ready
[1:35:49] God couldn't come to deliver the
[1:35:50] children of Israel and until all things
[1:35:52] were ready so when he said I've heard
[1:35:53] the cries of my people and I've come
[1:35:56] down because all things are ready and
[1:35:58] I've come down to
[1:36:00] deliver and there are people here this
[1:36:02] morning that God wants to deliver you
[1:36:05] God wants to restore you you've been
[1:36:07] living any kind of way for the last few
[1:36:09] months for the last few weeks or
[1:36:10] whatever but somewhere along the line
[1:36:12] you lost your joy you lost your peace
[1:36:14] you've been distracted but before this
[1:36:16] great convention God has called us to
[1:36:19] mper for another time to cry and sigh
[1:36:22] and say Lord Lord you said If my people
[1:36:25] will humble themselves and pray and seek
[1:36:28] my face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[1:36:31] we're going to hear from heaven we want
[1:36:34] to hear from Heaven it can't be just
[1:36:36] another service it has to be here from
[1:36:39] God is there anybody in the house this
[1:36:41] morning who wants to hear from God is
[1:36:44] there anybody in the house this morning
[1:36:46] you're tired of being sick you're tired
[1:36:48] of being up and down that disease that
[1:36:51] you have we have to serve it notice and
[1:36:54] we got to do something about
[1:36:59] it
[1:37:00] hallelujah
[1:37:02] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:37:06] I'm not talking about the work up I'm
[1:37:08] not talking about just you doing
[1:37:09] something because other people doing it
[1:37:11] but I'm talking about you catching a
[1:37:13] burden for your house you catching a
[1:37:15] burden for your life uh you catching a
[1:37:17] burden for a spiritual experience you
[1:37:20] getting desperate because God is
[1:37:22] speaking to you it takes God to fill you
[1:37:25] but are you desperate to be filled with

[1:39:31] struggling with their personal
[1:39:33] Philistines but this morning we come to
[1:39:35] expose them so that you could go free
[1:39:38] you could go free and you could walk
[1:39:39] into here without condemnation and you
[1:39:42] could walk into here knowing that
[1:39:43] there's a provided way for you to be
[1:39:46] healed to be delivered to be set free
[1:39:48] can the church say amen amen amen amen
[1:39:51] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:55] hallelujah we're getting ready for this
[1:39:57] war friends it's a military operation
[1:40:00] and we must have military preparation
[1:40:02] all these years we have been under

[1:40:07] the word every service is pointing us to
[1:40:09] get ready get ready for this spiritual
[1:40:12] battle and we are waiting for the
[1:40:14] Dynamics we are waiting for the Thunder

[1:40:19] are waiting we are cleaning while we are
[1:40:22] waiting we are preparing while we are
[1:40:24] waiting we are sanctifying ourselves
[1:40:27] Joshua told the people sanctify
[1:40:29] ourselves because in a few days we are
[1:40:32] going over we have not been this way
[1:40:34] before
[1:40:36] listen in this season when the Holy
[1:40:39] Ghost drops down what is Promised is a
[1:40:41] church that sin cannot stay in it it's a
[1:40:44] church that the sick cannot stay sick
[1:40:47] it's a church you can't just walk into
[1:40:49] and go back home no no no no no no no no
[1:40:51] no no it's a church that's going to be a
[1:40:53] holy church because a holy God will move
[1:40:55] through the church through individuals
[1:40:57] in the church can the church say Amen so
[1:41:00] this is not the time to run this is not
[1:41:02] the time to hide this is the time to
[1:41:04] hold on to the halls of the Altar and
[1:41:06] say Lord I don't want to miss it that's
[1:41:09] what they were doing in the upper room
[1:41:10] they were holding on say Lord you
[1:41:11] promise the Holy Ghost they were saying
[1:41:14] Lord you made a promise I'm not going to
[1:41:16] let you go until you bless me I'm not
[1:41:18] going to let you go until my change
[1:41:20] comes and while they were worshiping
[1:41:22] while they are praying while they are
[1:41:24] praising then come a song from Heaven as
[1:41:27] of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled
[1:41:29] the whole house uh where they were
[1:41:31] setting that's the way I feel this
[1:41:33] morning to see the Holy Ghost pour out
[1:41:36] inside of this church to part in this
[1:41:39] convention can the church say
[1:41:45] amen amen the musician good get ready
[1:41:48] thank you hallelujah hallelujah

[1:42:19] valley full of ditches how many vision
