TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church that nice landlord in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there's gifts will bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with lung that brings fellowship and fellowship brains gifts
