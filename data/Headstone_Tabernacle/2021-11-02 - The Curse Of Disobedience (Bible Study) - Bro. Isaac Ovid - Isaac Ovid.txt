for a word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight for your love for your mercy for your grace to us that we could gather one more time in this room in your presence your word teaches us that where there are two or three gathered in your name lord there you are in the midst of them so we thank you tonight lord for your word that we stand upon tonight we are resting on this word lord this great message of the hour lord that paul would have preached that all the heroes of faith and the apostles and the prophets of all lord even to this day that we stand on the message of a 20th century prophet we pray dear god that your holy spirit lord would come upon this room tonight you know every person that's here you know what brought them here we have all been called here tonight by your love by your mercy lord someone may have invited us but lord it's your call father because no man could come unless the father draws so thank you father tonight for drawing us lord to you father there are so many places we could have been tonight there are so many things we could have been doing there are so many things we could occupy ourselves with them and such a blessing to be able to break the routine as it were lord and and and the hustle and the bustle of life that it's so easy to get caught up in lord to put you first we live in a world lord where it's becoming more and more difficult to find peace it's becoming more and more difficult to find safety it's becoming more and more difficult to find comfort lord but lord you promised to be our comforter you promised to be our safety you promised to be lord our peace in the midst of the storm so father may you speak to us tonight lord those are already in the room those that could join us as we proceed tonight may you take me out of the way lord and may you take us all out of the way so we can be sensitive to hear from you lord we are here tonight lord to hear from you lord not to hear my thoughts are here our ideas but lord to go into your sacred scripture law that has been given to us for correction for admonition for encouragement so we can become more like you so we dedicate this service tonight to you and lord if there's anyone sick in our midst tonight lord may you heal your people father you know every need every situation every condition lord i want to lord lift up the south family brother kelly would have spoken got in our testimony service last friday and how the enemy has waged an attack against his house so father we pray dear god that the angel of the lord would pass his way tonight lord and would minister to that situation father lord and bring great peace in the midst of their storm father lord and for everyone here tonight whatever it is sickness depression frustration doubt fear uncertainty unbelief we take every spirit tonight under our control by the authority of the lord jesus christ father may tonight be a turning point for somebody tonight be a night of permanent transformation for somebody because you teach us that we are to be transformed by the renewing of our minds may you speak to us and and bless us in a special way in the precious team of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it's certainly a great privilege to be here one more time for our bible study our conversation it's not a preaching service it's a conversation around the word of god where we could sit and have a a fireside chat or a conversation around scripture and around how we want to get stronger as believers in god so we certainly welcome you tonight and for our visitors in our gates and those who have been specially invited we are so happy that you take up your time to join us tonight and we salute you although we can't see most of you you are welcome and we are so happy to have you here with us uh tonight and by the grace of god to spend some time in fellowship with the word of the lord you know and uh i want to encourage you that if you're here tonight it's not by accident i don't believe that anything is accidental i don't believe anything is by chance i believe that god has a plan and a purpose for our lives and whether we know it or we don't know it or we understand it or don't understand it doesn't change the fact that god has a plan for our lives tonight so i want to just have a conversation tonight about a interesting topic i call it interesting topic it's something that we are familiar with we understand it we know it but i just want to revisit it because i think it is as we get closer to the ending of this world you know within recent times there's been so much said about the ending of will and the ending of time and the time of the end and these things but as we get closer to the ending of time and ending of the world it forces us to reflect on what's really important you know there's a lot of things that we could do a lot of things we could say and at the end of the day it may not be important you know i say it in the corporate world people do a lot of activity that may not be true productivity you know and as we challenge ourselves to be great christians and to be yielded and to be surrendered it is so important for us to come back to what's important and uh so i want to start off by saying you know as a young child growing up you know i remember being in school and in particular in primary school and you always have you know some teachers who would say boy them children had had a boy you know anybody ever ever hear a teacher say something like that i'm sure and ahead hard boy oh gosh yeah listening and i tell him to do this thing and just teach you any easy and it's not just teachers say it you have you have parents who say oh gosh i'm cheering they don't want to listen i tell him to do this i tell him dude i tell him don't go down the road by tommy don't spend time and at the end of the day what what really it is is there's this struggle to not just listen but i would call it to follow instructions initially but beyond that is really an issue of obedience and when you look at it from a deeper perspective as a child and i'm blessed with a two-year-old and and once children begin to learn the word no without even being trained on certain things it's almost like do this no and and it's a process i i don't know any child who didn't go through a period where they start to use you would know even if they don't under understand the full implications of it it is something that's built in to almost begin to resist and it's not just resistance out of a desire to resist it is the birth of will it is the birth of their own desire to express themselves so you tell them it's time to go to bed and it's no because they actually want to do something else and it may be very well that you're telling someone that this is the most important thing for you to be doing but because will is being formed and ideas and opinions and the way things should be even in that small mind there's a challenge of obedience and in building on this when we really trace back to the first sin on earth the very first sin that was committed on earth when you really analyze it and and to even get to the first sin on earth you need to to go even before it to the first sin that ever was was the sin of pride because lucifer was lifted up by pride you know in scripture and he looked at what was taking place in heaven and he will see i will be like and he had this desire to be like god and we know there was war in heaven that fell on the earth so the first sin that we could ever record is a sin of pride followed by the next sin which was not a sin committed by man but the devil again performed what would be the first sin on earth which was a lie being told that you will not die so students of scripture would know that when the devil came to speak to eve and say what did god say up until this point when eve was having a conversation man had not sinned the devil was continuing in the spirit of sin and he would lie and say you will not die and that lie itself was sin but the first sin that man really committed was disobedience because the instruction given to man was and if you read it in the book of genesis 2 this is just layna background for my thought tonight and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die so it was really a simple thing man had a access opportunity to do every single thing but one thing and life or death hinged on one simple thing just ob if you just stuck to this one rule if adam and eve had just stuck to this one rule and leave this tree alone we would not be where we at tonight but the lie that satan told that says it's okay to disobey god it's okay for a different outcome than what god said led to disobedience obedience and disobedience affect us on a daily basis they are natural consequences of disobedience i'm just building into my thought a little bit some people say well i don't listen to nobody i don't wanna tell me anything in a very simplest of sense in a natural law perspective a traffic light turns red you could choose to obey or you could choose that this would be it's very simple you choose to obey the red light then you in a structure of of of of order as it were and if you choose a disobedient red light then you run the risk of it's obvious an accident whether you get hurt or not it could be somebody else affected but the point is there's a choice to obey or not to obey there are people who disrespect their neighbors disrespect the boss disrespect whatever they want but you know what they will never break a red light because they value their lives so we find a situation that people are selectively obedient and selectively disobedient all right so it is really natural as it is in your spiritual our boss tells us to do something we don't do it for some of us depending on where we work we get right up we get suspended there are consequences of the action and for some reason we are selectively disobedient or obedient depending on situations that confront us even now here in our beautiful country we have a curfew you could choose you have a choice you could choose the obedience of you or you could choose a disobedience you if you feeling adventurous you could choose to drive out if you'd love your past and drive on your road at 11 pm see what happened you have a choice you could obey and disobey but not everything is just clear cut not everything is as simple as one way or the other this or that our doctors tell us stop eating fried foods and even in that we are selective sometimes you will be sometime if we fry food look very good we disobey depending on the sauce you put on it depending on his barbecue honey barbecue honey mustard not just somehow the control or the discipline we would have had breaks down depending on the situation don't drink sugar don't drink soft drink eat more vegetables somebody said i thought this is bible study so i'm like a hell class the point is is a principle of how because of our will we choose how we want to respond to situations and if we choose to listen or not eat more vegetables you have a choice will be this will be get more rest you have a choice will be this will be the opportunity to obey or disobey can come as a result of a command so somebody commands us to do something go on what you wish some people child not not to do it disobey choose to do it obey go what you as you wash some things i remember years ago wash the words and you wash all the little plates something and you leave your pot the souk anybody know what a document this perpetual put that always soaking so you obey no i wash it but uh as far as you know you wash all the ways by the pot sensor again it's not a complete job but you could at least say i wash it but holy parts soak in convenient so it could come as a result of a command so somebody commands a student something and we choose to obey or not obey a suggestion or it could even be a desire somebody has and we choose to respond to that tonight for a few minutes i want to speak about the curse of disobedience and this is taken from a biblical perspective and to lay a foundation i want to start if you have your bibles in the book of deuteronomy chapter 11 and we're going to lay this as a foundation and then we're going to cut a few scriptures not going to be too long with you tonight deuteronomy 11 verse 1 and see here how god is speaking through this scripture here deuteronomy 11 verse 1 therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgment and his commandments always that's pretty clear cut right thou shalt love the lord thy god so the way this is written shout love is actually a commander it's not a suggestion it's not a recommendation so already in that first scripture you're reading here we are being instructed that thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgment and his commandments in other words if this is now a requirement then we need to understand what his charges his statutes his judgment and his commandments always annoy this day for i speak not with your children which have not known in other words what this is saying and as moses is speaking here i speak with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatest mighty hand and his stretched out arm in other words all you know you you have experienced enough and if you're in this room tonight it doesn't matter if you've been in church 20 years ago 40 years ago there are some things you know there's some things you understand so moses is building up background here and he's saying in history and his miracles in other words his miracles and his acts are real which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land we know these things verse 4 and what he did unto the army of egypt we know these things onto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you so he's building into something and as god often does he reminds them first before he lays what he wants to to place upon them so he's taking them down memory lane he's taking them down through what you've been through and if you're here tonight there's something god has taken you through you can look back and say it was the lord so moses is sharing with them and he's reminding them the same god who took you through wants to say something to you tonight and what he did to the army of egypt onto their horses and their chariots how he made a water of the ready to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord had destroyed them unto this day and what he did unto you in the wilderness until he came onto this place so god is reminding them now of how you got here in other words you're not here by chance you didn't even make it to this room tonight by chance you didn't make it to this month by chance it is day by chance to where you at in your life because there's so many things that have happened along the journey but it's not by chance it was the lord who was coming along the journey with you to bring you to this spot verse six and what he did unto daythan and abiram the sons of elia the son of ruben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up so he's reminding them also not just of how he delivered them but of his judgment because this verse is judgment based on disobedience and based on bad attitudes and based on failure to adhere to the laws of god and their household and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel verse seven but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did therefore so moses is not saying reinforcing now after having said all this know that you know all this therefore influence it shall ye keep all and if you have a physical bible on the line all if you have a digital vision highlight all the commandments which i command you this day that he may be strong and go in and possess the land whether you go to possess it and that he may prolong your days in the land so we see a connection between keeping commandments and prolong in your life which the lord swear unto your fathers to give unto you and to their seed a land that flowed with milk and honey for the land whether thou goes in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence he came out where they saw this their seed and waters it with thy foot as a garden of herbs in other words it's a different kind of land we're going into but a land whether you go to possess the land you're going into it is a land of hills and valleys and drinking water of the rain of the heaven a land which the lord thy god clear it for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it so god is interested in this thing it's not it's not that bike inviting is that a haphazard thing it's not it's not a feeling to do something and god doesn't operate like that because he discovered that the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it do you realize that the eyes of the lord are always upon you is that a sometimes thing when you wake up in the morning even when you do even pray he's still interested in how your day goes when you don't even acknowledge him because you are part of him as a father he still is interested in you the eyes of the lord that god are always upon it from the beginning of the year listen even until the end of the year so moses saying it does stop when the year started watching it when the year end he watching it he is always watching it there's no vocation with god it's it's not in the morning thing it's not when you're in church on a sunday on a wednesday it's a it's a 24 7 a permanent understanding that god has an interest and a desire about this thing and if this is land physical land we're talking about here how much more tonight do you think god has a permanent interest and desire in the beginning of the year till the end of the year to have his eyes always upon you his eyes always upon me his eyes always upon us anybody with me tonight verse 13 and it shall come to pass listen to the conditionality of it and this is what i really want to kind of get there are some conditions to this thing and it shall come to pass if ye shall harken diligently unto my commandments so it is not just hearken unto my commandments now but it's harken diligently what does diligently mean there's a level of enthusiasm a level of effort there's a passion there's a drive there's a tenacity there's something within you that makes this a priority anybody with me and it shall come to pass if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day listen to love the lord your god that's the foundational commandment there to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul this is not a command to say draw up a mountain jump off a cliff and i'm talking that tonight the command is to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul if this as a foundational command you hearken diligently onto this command because you see love love makes you do strange things i always preach this love makes you do strange things so if you really love the lord your god you want to please him you want to serve him and then obeying everything else becomes natural because it's now a love relationship anybody with me let's build so they can the conditionality goes on if you do this verse 14 that i will give you the reign of your land in his due season in other words when it's supposed to come it will come when your blessing is supposed to come it will come that's what rain is raining is a blessing rain is to bring harvest anybody with me that it will i will give you the reign of your land in his due season the first ring and the lattering that thomas gather in thy corn and thy wine and then oil and i so it's no longer about you so the moment you become an obedient son an obedient daughter to god anybody with me the moment there's a shift in your life so a wholehearted commitment not a half-hearted commitment not a sometimes commitment the moment this becomes a reality to each of us verse 15 and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle so god is now saying i will provide for every aspect of what your sustenance needs that thomas eat and be full anybody with me take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and he turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no real and the land you'll not have fruit so he's saying take heed this is a warning tonight that your heart don't get deceived and this is the age living in in an age of deception many people who stood faithful to the cause of christ hearts have been deceived they have lost their joy they lost the peace they lost the burden they lost the cry for lost souls anybody with me so he's saying this is the consequence of your heart being deceived and when you turn aside and serve other gods what other gods this is not a god of just a idol of a for or any random thing you know anything is your god for some of us here our work is is god our car is good our savings is good our attitude towards we we have all kind of other things that that take our worship because worship is about your time worship is about your effort worship is where you spend your energy you spend your resources you spend your thinking all that forms part of your worship verse 17 and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not of fruit unless he perished quickly from off the good land which the lord gave it to you you see the consequence there verse 18 therefore i'm still laying a foundation therefore shall we lay up these my words in your heart in other words gather these words in your heart tonight from this day forward and in your soul and bind them for a sign up on your hand that they may be that they may be as frontlets between your eyes don't lose focus don't get distracted and listen parents in this room tonight mentors in this room tonight guardians in this room tonight look how god true moses is placing responsibility and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when their citizens nine house what conversations do you spend time with as parents with your children in your house anybody with me tonight whose responsibility is it to teach your children in your house what are you teaching your children in your house and we continue and when the walk is by the way when the lie is down and when they'll rise it up verse 20 and thou shalt write them upon the doorpost of their house and upon their gates what does this mean this means your your whole environment god teaching them control your environment as best as you can you can't control your neighbor house but what are you doing in your house you can't control what music playing your neighbor car what other people do but what are you doing in the area of your influence because you have an influence whether it's your room in your house whether it's your mattress and you on the top bunk whatever is your sphere what is your cubicle on your job because this is a practical gospel this is not a on a sunday a feeling for this or no no no no he's saying and he said write it up on your door post what quotes do you live by what scriptures do you put in on on sticky notes what's the what's the word paper on your phone because these are now the versions thank you to hanno dopos you have your phone and and what you choose to put as the image on your phone what your sticky note is speaks volumes about what is important to you anybody with me this is a different kind of thing because it's about life it's about godliness it's about the practical application of what we could control we appreciate tonight we can't control a lot of different things but god gave me these strengths that the things i have influence over i do my very best to live for him is that your desire tonight is that your prayer tonight that the things you could control you do your absolute best with it verse 20 and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy gates that listen listen to the to the result of doing these things that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children so you see there's a connection between your life and your children based on your obedience anybody with me your obedience through this scripture is correlated there's a relationship there's a correlation there there's a connection between your response to god's word and your own life and the life of your children anybody would be tonight in the land which the lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth moses is reinforcing it you can see the urgency the importance the gravity the not taking it lightly verse 22 for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him can i say that one more time love the lord your god walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him cleave means to pursue to attach are you attaching yourself to the things of god what what are you attached to what are you attracted to what are you connected to what what are you being influenced by somebody say well well i i go to church on a saturday you know i just play my gospel music kind of listen to books as read the prophet books that's really bible and stuff but but there there are there are days i call it between sundays and when you put down the bible what are you doing then because this is saying to love the lord your god walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him which means cleave me to pursue to follow to attach verse 23 we're still in this one scripture this is supposed to be the background but it seems to be hell a modern background then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves so god is saying just by obedience anybody with me just by obedience situations that you meet that are greater than you you will get grace and strength to deal with them isn't that an encouragement to us possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves now every place this is similar to what you will read in in in in joshua every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be there shall no man be able to stand before thee for the lord your god shall lay listen the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he had said unto you in other words god will will so enlarge your territory anybody with me building tonight this is what i want to build into now verse 26 behold tonight on this second of november to reinforce this i set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day and a curse if he will not obey the commandment of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which you have not known so for a few minutes not going to be too long i want to speak on the curse of disobedience as an encouragement as a warning as food for thought from a biblical perspective sin john 14 15 the bible says if you love me keep my commandments how many people say that they love god and if you really do and god say if you really love me the love is not a word as in saying i love god but it is evidenced by how you keep his commandments but to keep his commandments you need to know him and know his commandments because that that means you're ready love so it now begs a deeper issue of your relationship with god your study of his word to know what god's desires his commands his wishes what he wants you to do how he wants you to live so that it becomes your command and you keep it and it's going to go through a few scriptures and i trust it encourages you a little bit let's bring it home to the family to the young people in this room ephesians 6 1. so this thing about obedience because now god is placing obedience to him but there are also other levels of this thing listen to this now ephesians 6 1 children obey your appearance in the lord for this is right appalling for a minute on it because it's a real struggle as a young person to say that you're trying to serve goal and you're struggling to obey your parents and especially for those of you in here who are in homes where your parents trying their very best to do the very best to lead you along the right path and you struggling to listen to good advice good recommendations i'm not saying they know everything but at the end of the day there's a law and it's a scripture obey your appearance in the lord and in the amplified it means as god's representative because god placed parents as your stewards and your guardians to to show you things that you haven't seen just yet anybody with me paul didn't just say this to the ephesians we read it there most often but in colossians 3 20 he said children obey appearance in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord so if something is pleasing to the lord so paul is saying if you don't want to do it for for your parents sake this is actually pleasing to the lord you know so exactly a double benefit children obey prince oh for this is well pleasing unto the lord and brother ovid would have preached on this in our study or spoken into the bible two studies ago i believe it was titus 3 1 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work this is christian conduct this is christian behavior this is christian order hebrews 5 8 and this scripture is one that really inspired this particular teaching tonight because to this day it still blows my mind hebrews 5 8 though he were a son speaking about jesus yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered that itself is a mind blowing boost and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him anybody with me i want to read that one more time though he was son and if you read this in the amplifier this is the son who never disobeyed his father that's the amplified so it is not that jesus was disobedient to them jesus can't disobey god and it's it's a deep teaching here though he were a son who never disobeyed his father yet learned he obedience which means there's there's deeper levels of obedience and this learning obedience really have to now connect with will because when you think about it and i was sharing this with brother over this world jesus didn't have a problem with sin think about it jesus didn't have a problem with sin sin was not something that he struggled with jesus had if i could say it like this carefully say like this only one struggle and that was his struggle of will and that's how powerful will is as a struggle for us because will is not connected to our choice and our desires our desires to do certain things so we see for example that that jesus in the garden of gethsemane is praying say lord if it is possible let this cup pass jesus knew what his mission was he knew what he was there to do but at that point in time the struggle that jesus had was his will because he would say nevertheless not my will meaning he actually had a will he actually had a choice like all of us tonight have a will and all of us tonight have a choice but jesus subjected his will which was his struggle to obedience which meant to god's will so he says it like this nevertheless not my will but i will be done die purpose in other words i'm going to be i'm going to subject myself it's a hard thing i have to go through because the cross was difficult calvary was difficult it was not walk in the park and his understanding of that was the struggle the fact that there were a decision actions consequences that were about to unfold in his life that were unfavorable and his will rose up because it who wants to go and get licks and beaten and spit upon and mocked and get nails in their hands nobody volunteering and it shows the authenticity of this because jesus didn't just walk to the cross how different would this story be this teaching be this reality be if we didn't understand that it was actually a point where jesus hesitated questioned struggled cried say lord if it's possible is there a chance that i do have to go to calvary is there a chance that i don't have to take this burden is there a chance i don't have to die that's the reality of it you know but you know what my will my desire it may not be an evil will or evil desire you know but am i truly surrendered to god's will for my life that's a deeper question tonight let's go colossians 3 22 servants obey in all things your masters are quality of the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in sickness of heart fearing god i always challenge people i don't care how rough your job is not everybody has the best job or the happiest job or whatever it is but in wherever god is blessing you because you need to see it as a blessing you serve god in your job and paul is saying to the colossians servants workers obeying all things your masters according to the flesh not with i service as men pleasers some people do their job because they want the boss to see them and and once the balls are proven and they're not doing it from the heart but paul is saying but in sickness of heart fear and god so what you do you're doing it not unto man but unto the lord just a few more exodus 23 20 behold i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice it is really clear provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak again we keep hearing about obedience and doing all the problem today friend is we have too much part-time christians too many part-time christians who believe that this gospel is a buffet style arrangement well i take in this and this i'm not taking this i already like that because that there really is against my will i like that much control i'm an independent i'm a i'm an independent kind of person but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries jeremiah 7 23 but this thing commanded i them saying obey my voice and i will be your god and you shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well unto you you say anybody tonight wants it to be well with them situations in your life and they say oh boy if if i could get a change if something could be well something is not well somebody's not right something here is a law and a principle obey my voice i'll be your god and it shall be my people and walking in all the ways again we see this constant repetition of all the ways that i've commanded you i hope this is challenging you tonight you know this is not i know it's not for everybody i know there are people who in all areas of their lives they like mediocrity they like barely doing it doing it halfway doing just enough to get by aren't you tired of doing just enough to get by aren't you tired of just of just barely existing can we challenge you tonight to do something a hundred percent you're so committed to this thing that nothing distracts you from this thing or be my voice walk in all the ways that i've commanded you even tonight hebrews 13 17. and this is a spiritual application of this and tonight we have we have a number of guests here if you're in the ministry this is for you for those who are in this ministry hebrews 13 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for their watch for your souls as they must give account didn't we speak on this last sunday but giving an account i could come tonight and tell you it's okay you're all right just stay happy but will that get you where you're supposed to be in god when do we see the requirement clearly says in all the is so hebrews 13 17 obey them that have rule over you and submit yourselves for their watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you i've seen so many people make bad decisions and as much as you tell people hey don't do that that way don't do it that way you know the bible says alter the multitude of counsel there's safety that's scripture life will always have decisions that's within your expertise and outside your expertise i am not an architect so you cannot come to me and ask me how to build your house i am not an architect if you want to build a house you need to go to an architect anybody with me you want to start a farm you need to go to somebody who understand farming that is not me and in all things you have to understand what is important and not limit yourself just to your knowledge but make the right connection so you can grow what is the spiritual side of this thing now as believers god has blessed us with different gifts so that we could grow together take in scripture to rightly divide it so we could grow and we could see perhaps what we never saw before or never saw the value of it before so we could get good advice and the advice and the encouragement tonight is you need to be more surrendered if you're backslidden tonight you need to come back home not i talk in church i talk about coming back to the kingdom coming back to our relationship with god and recently i was having a conversation with somebody and they say things not really going well in my life i say retrace these steps because your trouble i know started when you started to separate yourself from kingdom you break fellowship you got distracted you spent time doing things you shouldn't be doing conversations you shouldn't be having places you shouldn't be going how much people have made bad decisions because decisions have consequences you know good and bad people go to five years of secondary school and don't study and what you expect to get a good result and somebody else go five years and they study hard and have a result some time ago there was a international story of somebody in brazil or wherever it was a young boy had no electricity at home used to go out to the street light to study how many stories we have of people because of a great desire to achieve they push back past whatever limitation that they had because they wanted to achieve and that is for natural things because a natural degree a natural certification a natural job all that is important you know god don't have a problem with that at all the problem is when this becomes your god and you lose sight that there's an eternity and there's a land beyond this land and it is easy that's why we said last sunday lay aside every sin and wait for some of us it may not be out there doing synonymy things but we have all kind of weights and the weight prevents us from being totally sold out to the commandments of god so we can't pray as we should because prayers is a commandment anybody with me tonight prayer is a command pray without ceasing that's a command for this is the will of god the will anybody with me so very quickly as we try to drive along the last street of this journey obedience it is a paradox how much god values obedience and how much he has taught us very simple if you know it ten lepers came to jesus jesus had multiple ways he healed people in all kinds of different ways these lepers he just tell them go and show yourself to the priest now for the students of scripture in the old testament if you had leprosy or had any kind of skin disease you could not be admitted to be with the people until the priests say you're cleared to come back into the population as it will so jesus said go and show yourself to the priests so first of all these men had to decide but wait a minute if i go to the priest in my condition there's no way you're going to give me any clearance i know my i know my condition so at that point in time it took great faith to begin to walk but these men actually had one choice they obeyed and in obeying the bible says on the way they were all healed what did they do they just obeyed why didn't god just put his hand upon them why didn't he say be healed he just said go show yourself to the priest some of us trinidadians if we were there we ain't make it out we wouldn't we would not be healing them because we were to tell jesus how he should do it anybody with me jericho the battle of jericho another paradox on the first day walk around once on the second day walk around once third day walking around runs all the way we do it if it was a trinidadian there again jericho was standing up straight i cannot understand how walking around jericho is going to lead to the war coming down but all joshua and they had to do was do one thing obey do we trust god enough to just obey without questioning how we're gonna happen anybody with me god wants to heal you bless you deliver you restore you give you the desires of your heart open up the winners of heaven for you and all he's asking for is to obey and he's telling us tonight that if you don't obey it have negative consequences very simple and if you obey it's positive consequences this is not a deep gospel you know it's a very simple thing but it affects our daily lives because it don't challenges us to really look at even our prayer lives let's bring it home because if you see prayer as a command how does god view when we don't pray on a daily basis can we look at it like that when we could go a day and i said it some time ago you don't go out there without plugging in your cell phone yo somehow you don't forget that you don't forget that at all you know you have to connect your cell phone you know right forget myself for three days now i forget to plug in my cell phone the whole month i forget to program my cell phone my cell phone air on for three months audio cell phone on a friday at a certain time because that's how some of us live with our lives with with god you're only plugging on the phone the phone only on for a few hours at select times in a week because that is anybody with me noah look at this scripture and and this is what i want my testimony to be and this is what i want your testimony to be genesic genesis 6 22 thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he i'll read it one more time thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he i want to challenge you to begin to think about a life that when the record when they record an angel speaks about you you can say thus dead brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so according to all that god commanded so did he so did her because you consider it important but let's re-look again briefly at noah's day what was the requirement in noah's day it was really simple you know go in the act option one stay audi act option two going into the act was obedience staying out of the aqua disobedience very simple and we can look back in hindsight as it is or as it were and say but wait a minute why didn't more people go into the ark and we can look back and we know all of us in this room tonight know that the right decision was to go into the earth and the wrong one to us to stay out of the act that is obvious but do we know tonight that is still a situation like that going on right now that you have to be in christ or out of christ in safety or outside of safety in the holy ghost or outside you holy ghost in the body or outside of the body and the same decision that faced them in that day faces us in this day a decision of obedience bring it into context full obedience to the entire world entitles usually token full obedience in the word of god entitles you to all that god has for you your inheritance your promise your perfection your adoption your growth your spiritual maturity in the days of moses the last plague the death angel it was a simple thing if you put the blood on your doorpost as the scripture said that angel would spare that firstborn if you didn't do it death was going to strike you home it was a simple matter of obedience and disobedience it was not even an issue of understanding i want to i want it to resonate but i don't understand why moses say do it like that why i can't do something else why i can't do it this other way because moses was very clear with what they were supposed to do and if you obey there's a consequence there's a result there's a blessing and if you disobey there's a consequence anybody with me tonight we have studied jonah and jonah disobeyed god and we know the story listen to pharaoh when moses came to his choice of words in exodus 5 and verse 2 and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go and that's so many people today who is this lord who is this jesus what is this gospel that i should obey this voice i know not the lord neither will i let israel go i want to challenge you tonight do you know the lord yeah you're in the message i know you need a message but do you know the lord anybody with me tonight do you have an experience with the lord is this a reality to you or is this just an expression my last substantive reading to close off tonight is a familiar story and i want to just strike it here some verses out of first samuel 15 if you have it first samuel 15 our last reading tonight it's first timer 15 and verse 1. samuel the anointed prophet of god also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt and for those of you who remember moses led the throne of israel out of egypt they were not an army they were not trained they had no weapons they were coming out of broken people out of years of bondage and samuel is referring to the fact that when they left egypt the amalekites attacked them in their weakest moment when they were vulnerable and god hated that because god was bringing out his people and the amalekites pounced on vulnerability pounds on weakness we all go through moments when we are weak when we are vulnerable we know how we feel when we are vulnerable and god knows how you feel when when you're vulnerable god knows god knows your people tonight feeling weak you're tired they're wary they're they're just tired and not on water hang on their doors on a mountain stop and victorious we are mixed audience tonight but god remembers and this is years later but god is telling saul through his prophet samuel i remember that which i'm elected to israel i'll never gonna let it slide how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt now go and smite amalek god is sovereign he can do what he wants he said go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slave both man and woman infant and suckling oxen sheep camel and ass saw garden people together and numbered them in tellium 200 000 foot men and 10 000 men of judah and saul came to a city of amalek and laid weight in the valley and saul said unto the canaanites go the part get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for you showed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the canaanites departed from among the amalekites you see god is a just god in them he said the amalekites in the moment of weakness they attacked when my people were vulnerable they cannites they showed kindness so let them go and saw smoothie amalekites from havilah until they commenced assure that it's over against egypt and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but saul and the people speared again no again the instruction was to wipe everybody out saul was anointed and an anointed king is being disobedient look how god begins to deal with this as it unfolds but saul and the people spared aegon we in verse nine and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings he didn't spare the bad sheep he didn't spare foolishness he spared the best and the lambs and all that was good i want us to pause here for a minute so because for it to be described as all that was good there's a lot that we do that could be described as good in them in principle there was nothing wrong with the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the factlings and the lambs and all that was good but in the context of god's command that just required obedience this became an issue so you could spend hours and hours studying and that's good i'm not saying no study but where is god in your study because when you have to give an answer on that day i said it in church you can't present yourself to god what you need to present to god is your obedience to his word his precepts his command all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they destroyed utterly so saul and them destroyed everything that was in their minds worthless and they kept everything that they thought had value and that's how we are in life you know we don't keep things that really have no value and reject the thing that we think good it's in our nature to keep what is valuable and reject what has no value verse 10 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying listen to god's word it repented me so god is repenting him a lot of people miss this the language of scripture god is repenting you see it repented me in other words i have regrets i wish i could hit the undo button on this thing it repented me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me now saul in this situation it was in fornication it was adultery it wasn't smoking drinking it wasn't this wasn't the issue you know it was just disobedience he wasn't living a obvious ons sinful life and do it crazy you know i say but oh god he leave your church he backs light no he just disobeyed look how god's response is it repented me that i have set up saul to be king so he's turned back from following me and had not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night you see what spiritual grief that scores set a mark upon those that sigh and cry it bothers you sin bothers you a break from a relationship with god bothers you samuel knew what this meant and he cried all night 12 and when samuel rose early he cried all night and gets up early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to camel and behold he set up a place and has gone about and passed on and go on down to gilgal so samuel didn't sleep get up early and they telling samuel listen saul born and he'd go on to carmel and go on to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord so saul is saying to samuel blessed be thou of the lord mighty man of god i perform the commandment and samuel said what mean it then this bleating of the sheep in mine is and there was a year in animals and lowing of the oxen that i hear which i hear and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people speared and i want us to get this because this is the rare lesson here in this thing the people spare the best of the sheep and of the oxen listen listen to the purpose listen to the objective to sacrifice unto the lord thy god friends it was not a motive that is to cause harm to cause danger in their mind you know in their heart they thought they doing the right thing they did it with an intention to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we utterly destroyed you know how many people do things and saints with the lord anybody with me in their mind in their heart they're making a sacrifice unto the lord and in doing so they are disobeying god's command because god given your commands on how to live and how to act but you trying to serve god because this teaching here is saul was trying to serve god the way he wanted to god didn't ask for this at this time in this way it was a clear instruction destroy all that he had and he decided to have a service and this would be a god having a ceremony a spiritual ceremony and in heaven that is also disobedient god verse 15 the ending and the rest we utterly destroyed then samuel will still understand and i will tell you what the lord had said to me this night and so i'll say well say on and samuel said when thou was little in thy own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed the king over israel and the lord send thee on a journey in other words god has this way of always reminding you where you come from you saw it there when we read it in deuteronomy we saw it here again god is into him when there was little in thine own sight was down at may the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed the king of israel in other words i don't want to forget where you come from because i'm watching your behavior now and it is as if you forget where you come from and verse 80 says and the lord sent me on a journey in other words the fact that even here right now is not by your own choosing it was a command it was an instruction that god gave to you and said go and utterly destroy these sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed verse 19 wherefore then did is thou not obey the voice of the lord but there is fly upon the spoil and ditch evil in the sight of the lord so in other words somebody could sing a song to the lord and if it is out of order is actually evil enough or you don't hear me tonight it was a sacrifice in them that under a different circumstance or situation is perfect but against the command of the lord it became a sin that's how much god values obedience anybody with me verse 20 and saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and i've gone the way which the lord sent me and i've brought a god the king of amalek and i've utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took up the spoil sheep and oxen and the chief of the things which should have been ought to be destroyed listen again saul still defending himself he's missing the point of the lesson to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and gilgal so as far as saul is concerned he can't really understand at this point what's wrong you know i want to success he not appreciate as far as he concerned this thing really shouldn't be an issue we bring it to sacrifice unto the lord and samuel now have to reinforce it he say heart the lord as great delight you know in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the lord so it's a question and listen to the question said differently is the lord more interested in your burnt offering and his sacrifice and your effort and what you think you do it for the lord or is he more interested in you obeying his voice because under different circumstances you burn offering and sacrifices fine enough but when you compare burn offering against obeying a voice sacrifice against obeying his voice preaching against obeying his voice singing a song against obeying his voice whatever you think you should be doing against obeying his voice everything else is secondary to obeying his voice everybody with me your idea is secondary to obeying his voice your emotions secondary to obeying his voice how you think it should be secondary to obeying his voice behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams so sam you are settling the matter say obedience is better than sacrifice verse 23 for rebellion because this is what disobedience really is so he's saying without you being conscious of it for rebellion which is disobedience is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry so you say to me preacher for i don't worship idols i'm not into iniquity and not into witchcraft but whenever you disobey god it is considered rebellion which is as a sin of witchcraft and stubbornness which means you're just resisting what god wants in your life is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he had also rejected v from being king i'm getting ready to close out and saul senator samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words listen listen because i feared the people and obeyed their voice so the question tonight is who are you obeying because after all of this saul now admits i wasn't obeying god's voice i was obeying the voice of the people i was obeying another voice who are you obeying tonight when you make decisions choices do things verse 25 getting ready to close now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord had rejected thee from being king over israel friends in closing the greatest enemy to obedience is our will i said it before the battle that jesus had was not sin it was a battle of wills and we all have our will but like jesus we need to subject ourselves to god's will which is true perfect obedience not my will but dying be done i want to encourage you with these commands that we should live by from first thessalonians 5. it's a command rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil when jesus was a nut he was challenged and questioned many times and one time in matthew 22 verse 34 the bible says but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the greatest commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind we don't have time to go into it tonight but the fact that it is being clearly defined as you can love the lord with your heart you can love the lord with your soul and you can love him with your mind not just heart soul and mind but all your heart all of your soul and all of thy mind and verse 38 says this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets in closing we cannot change the past it's over there's nothing we can do about it i want to ask a question how different would our lives be if we obeyed the word of the lord if you didn't tell that lie if you had prayed because not lying is a command and praying is a command a line is being drawn tonight a line of separation between your past and your future a line is being drawn tonight a line of separation between disobedience and obedience when we were young the consequence of disobedience was licks no sweetie no ice cream this is different the consequence of disobedient disobedience is death hell wailing and gnashing of teeth and the blessing of obedience is a land of milk and honey a glory of eternity and a blessing first peter 4 17 fully seasoned among us for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and i'll end with this one quote from the token full obedience to the whole word of god will entitle you to the token full obedience not a part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience of the word which is christ brings you into christ now what if he was just all in but your feet hanging out what if he was all in with hands hanging out most all of us in but the heart is hanging out see the heart in the world but we don't do that full complete obedience puts you and the word as one you believe it every bit and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you you don't go above with a bunch of carrying on see you're a christian no matter what anybody says they'll never touch you you're in christ you're safe as you can be when death knocks at the door it has no hold see not at all why it's just stepping out of here into there age means nothing you don't pass from asia in eternity because you're in him he is eternal can we bow our heads for a word of prayer all gracious heavenly father this simple teaching tonight so remind your people of the importance of obedience the blessing that comes from obeying your word and the consequence or the curse of disobedience lord we take some of these things so lightly so casually and lord i think back to saul who thought he was doing something positive in his heart he thought he was doing it unto the lord and he missed the bigger picture that you are more interested in us obeying you than even doing things for you it's a deep understanding lord because many times we we try to compensate for what we should be doing in other ways when deep down in our hearts lord there are areas there that are in trouble lord i don't know who is in trouble tonight lord you know and i pray that you're with minister to each one lord and for those of us who have not been obedient to your word to your promise to your requirement of this hour lord may you stir our hearts within us to want to be more like you and to give up everything else that is not of you to be totally surrendered to have a passion for your commandments lord we read the scripture of parents spending time with their children lord of of of putting this word on our the doors of our homes and our gates and our hearts and our environments and our cubicles and our offices and our cars lord that not to impress anybody but lord to please you because we want to love you with all our heart with all our soul and all our minds lord lord may you strengthen the believers in our gates tonight to reach a higher level of faith a higher level of commitment a higher zeal and a passion to serve you as they have never done before if there's somebody here tonight who doesn't know you may they come to know you by revelation and by experience the night to know that there's life beyond this existence and to know that if we obey your word with everything that's within us we have a place in your economy a place in your kingdom so father may you be with each one may you break every chain and shackle that maybe binding anyone tonight in the mighty name of jesus christ anyone trouble anyone defeated stressed out overwhelmed we live in a world now that is overwhelming every day a different news report a different situation a different challenge the pandemic the economy situations difficult to deal with on our own but you promise to never leave us you promise to never forsake us your promise to be our peace our comfort our blessing and you promise to provide for us to heal us when the doctors don't have an answer lord to put food on our tables when jobs are questionable because we are your children help us tonight as your children to build a relationship with you lord that that you know us and we know you father one day you could speak like you did with jesus there's my spirit flowing freely this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased father we long for that day for the great reward father may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the prayer meeting is coming friday and the service is coming sunday we subject ourselves to your will and your purpose and we are committed we pledge tonight to be obedient may you be with each one in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord wretch you bless you tonight thank you for being a wonderful audience and may you be challenged and encouraged to be totally committed may the lord richie bless you tonight
