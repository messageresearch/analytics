[27:56] i mean compared to those giants the
[27:59] veteran of the on the
[28:01] faith they're preaching this convention
[28:04] i am from a catholic family
[28:07] my
[28:08] father is still catholic when i was
[28:10] young
[28:10] god please says you've trusted me to
[28:12] know him i was friends with pentecostal
[28:15] friend and i knew that they had
[28:17] something more than a head i don't have
[28:19] and one day as he was sitting in the
[28:22] church in the catholic church i was with
[28:24] my friend
[28:25] and he also will leave after
[28:28] and we know we should have to leave this
[28:30] church because it will now our place we
[28:32] say that we'll do something
[28:34] and we'll take the bible and open it and
[28:36] find the uh verse
[28:38] where
[28:38] we find the people we pick the va the
[28:41] verse will be the will of god it was a
[28:43] child sadly
[28:45] but that what we did he heard the bible
[28:47] and said
[28:48] are you ready i said yes i am open
[28:51] and
[28:52] oh we picked revelation 8
[28:55] 4. come on over my people they don't
[28:58] take part of their sin amen
[29:01] now we know not a message yet
[29:03] we know not many things
[29:04] but we know that god wanted us to come
[29:06] out
[29:07] and after we came out
[29:10] and now i joined the assembly of god
[29:12] enough afterwards i joined the
[29:14] pentecostal church i was a man of jesus
[29:17] and i still aim it
[29:19] i remember that
[29:20] when there were a prayer tonight
[29:24] fasting days because for my
[29:27] my parents to give him permission and go
[29:29] i was evangelist evangelizing everywhere
[29:32] preaching the word of god everywhere
[29:34] and even at the college i preach
[29:37] the word all
[29:39] almost to all my classmates that were
[29:41] uh
[29:43] a meeting that i was uh
[29:44] directing
[29:46] when i believe also the message i want
[29:49] souls
[29:50] among these so the one who is a minister
[29:53] in some church
[29:56] every
[29:58] was
[30:00] calling me pastor just to laugh at me
[30:04] and one day
[30:06] a man who was believing the message
[30:08] already i met him and i believe that men
[30:10] said in 1916 and i was baptized in 1917
[30:15] but i don't just don't want to carry on
[30:17] this thing
[30:18] we have received the basic of the
[30:20] message
[30:22] we're reading the message of the lord
[30:24] and until now our nuts had experience of
[30:28] the holy spirit baptism
[30:30] and with my adolescent crisis
[30:34] i had my my up and then and then when i
[30:36] got in contact and i believe this
[30:38] glorious message of the seven thunder i
[30:40] have no time to get into detail as
[30:42] brother command said it is an invitation
[30:45] to be partaker of the life of jesus
[30:46] christ and from there many things will
[30:49] happen and when i got to this church
[30:51] gordon a tabernacle
[30:53] i begin to live experience after
[30:56] experience after experience
[30:59] you know when you find the man and you
[31:01] find the place
[31:03] the right place many things change
[31:06] december
[31:07] 2008 pastor advised me to be
[31:11] in convention
[31:12] i went with my wife and
[31:14] the 27th december and 28th after the
[31:18] preaching i was lost in worship
[31:21] and something supernatural happened to
[31:23] me
[31:24] and all my life began to unfold before
[31:27] me
[31:28] and for 20 minutes uh crying like a baby
[31:31] and something happened in my life
[31:33] december 4 20
[31:35] 11 is uh one of the dates notable date
[31:39] and memorial date our pastor preached
[31:41] the sitting angel
[31:43] and that day i was in the back
[31:45] i was desperate
[31:46] and i was praying
[31:48] i was wrestling with the engine the holy
[31:50] ghost came to me
[31:52] so powerfully and
[31:54] as a wind in this high speed 20 200
[31:59] kilometer hour
[32:00] and the supernatural lights i saw
[32:03] many brethren testify that this
[32:05] experience
[32:07] they
[32:07] they testified they felt the power of
[32:10] god that day the pastor himself when it
[32:12] came the 11th december he testified that
[32:14] the power of god was so it was too much
[32:18] then he has to pay unto the puppet of a
[32:21] while far when you don't receive the
[32:22] holy ghost when you believe you receive
[32:24] the holy ghost after you have believed
[32:26] it may take many years
[32:28] just to keep moving on just keep
[32:32] clipping on to the god who is able
[32:35] to fulfill his promise will remember you
[32:38] amen the prophet said
[32:42] simple intellectual conception of the
[32:44] message would not be enough but when
[32:46] he's talking about intellectual he
[32:47] talking about not talking about those
[32:49] who are not
[32:50] going to school knows who are
[32:53] graduates
[32:54] if it is case there will be many to be
[32:56] disqualified he said in the main stage
[33:02] the young ruler
[33:03] was
[33:05] intelligent the light touched him he
[33:07] refused paul was intelligent man the
[33:09] light touched him and he accepted it
[33:12] my counsel or my advice you young people
[33:15] be serious in the study when you have a
[33:18] job
[33:18] just keep training yourself god will
[33:21] take you and prove that you can have a
[33:23] better life without compromising we can
[33:25] get our better life
[33:28] without getting to the
[33:30] demonic uh the morning court this is a
[33:33] promise i am a witness of that promise
[33:35] amen
[33:42] with my master degree but today today i
[33:45] am an executive in my company and then i
[33:47] have a five times six times my salary
[33:50] and this is the grace of god
[33:53] young people don't go in the world

[34:42] lord a battle

[34:47] i will close with this testimony a
[34:49] sister called me on first january say
[34:52] brother stephen my daughter is sick and
[34:54] she's really sick and then she got
[34:56] something on her nose and it is really

[35:19] who was sick
[35:22] and he had some liquid in his lungs he
[35:24] called me and i would pray together
[35:27] and the next week when he went to the
[35:29] hospital

[35:38] hospital and that lady was
[35:41] lying on the bed i went with another

[37:25] to have another opportunity to be joined
[37:28] with you via stream
[37:30] may god
[37:31] also let this conference serve to build
[37:34] up the bride of christ
[37:36] to grow and come into her perfect
[37:39] position
[37:40] thank you also to brother theo for
[37:43] extending the invitation
[37:46] well i will only speak some few words
[37:50] for a word of greetings
[37:54] today
[37:55] i want
[37:56] to share with you a little thought
[37:59] that was delighted me a few weeks ago
[38:02] i saw an article in our daily newspaper
[38:06] about trees
[38:08] this is the article
[38:14] in the article
[38:16] questions were asked the question how
[38:19] tall is the tallest tree
[38:22] how old is the oldest tree
[38:24] which is the largest lift tree
[38:28] which is the
[38:30] studies tree what is the largest food
[38:34] which is the thickest skinned tree
[38:38] at the end of the article
[38:41] something was written about the most
[38:45] famous tree
[38:50] this is
[38:51] the part of the article
[39:01] we can read it
[39:07] the most famous
[39:10] in this world that tree can neither be
[39:13] touched nor visited
[39:15] for it exists only in faith
[39:18] according to biblical tradition
[39:20] the tree of knowledge stands in the
[39:22] middle of the garden of eden
[39:25] because adam and eve violate god's
[39:27] prohibition and taste of its fruit
[39:31] they were expelled from paradise
[39:34] the fact that it is an apple is not
[39:37] specified
[39:39] the reason for the later formed
[39:42] tradition is probably
[39:44] the latin term
[39:46] melon
[39:47] with short a
[39:49] it means
[39:50] mischief with the long vowel
[39:54] apple
[39:57] and if we
[39:59] read in the bible
[40:06] there it is written
[40:07] in genesis chapter 3 verse 5
[40:11] for god doesn't know that in the day ye
[40:15] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[40:18] opened and he shall be as gods knowing
[40:22] good
[40:23] and evil
[40:25] and
[40:27] if we
[40:28] look carefully
[40:31] we can see
[40:33] we remember
[40:37] that not long ago
[40:39] the bible was translated into
[40:43] latin
[40:45] the will gator bible was for centuries
[40:50] the authority of bible from which to
[40:53] read and teach
[40:56] and if we
[40:58] look a little bit more closely
[41:01] to the words
[41:03] we can see the following
[41:14] we know
[41:15] it wasn't eating an apple
[41:18] but how do you think people got that
[41:22] idea
[41:25] according to genesis
[41:27] 3
[41:28] 5
[41:29] it is written knowing good and evil
[41:33] the latin term is bono
[41:36] at malum
[41:39] bottom has a meaning of the
[41:42] moral good
[41:44] morality
[41:45] honesty
[41:46] virtue good principles
[41:49] good conduct
[41:51] and the
[41:52] the word malum
[41:55] means with a short a
[41:58] malon
[42:00] it means evil mischief
[42:03] and if you pronounce it with a
[42:05] long a
[42:07] malum
[42:09] it means
[42:10] apple
[42:15] so i can imagine
[42:17] whenever the word
[42:20] the latin word
[42:21] malum was pronounced
[42:24] people heard
[42:26] in the back of their heads the word
[42:28] apple
[42:29] and so the image of an apple was joined
[42:33] with the word evil
[42:38] from this little thought
[42:40] we can also see very nicely
[42:43] why brother branham told people to say
[42:46] only what was on the tapes
[42:49] god has given us a divine
[42:52] perfect interpretation of his own word
[42:55] and we know that any human
[42:58] interpretation will ultimately leads to
[43:02] spiritual death
[43:04] how many people were deceived by only
[43:08] one mispronounced letter
[43:11] so that they still believe that the fall
[43:14] had something to do with an apple
[43:18] praise god for i self
[43:21] that
[43:21] he has given us so that we cannot only
[43:25] see what is visible before our eyes but
[43:29] look into
[43:30] the mystery of christ revealed
[43:35] god bless you mightily
[43:37] and may he bless his church
[43:40] especially his bride
[43:43] and israel
[43:45] the lord is near

[49:36] so we just thank uh you know we really
[49:39] appreciate i would say headstone
[49:40] tabernacle and uh brother theo's
[49:44] putting up this convention
[49:46] and we know that they blessing
[49:49] throughout the world and especially to
[49:51] us as at etmb
[49:53] and the ministry at stone brother theo
[49:56] brother isaac the different ministers
[49:58] there we pray that the lord may bless
[49:59] them
[50:01] as they
[50:02] labor in the field and i also want to
[50:04] you know greet the ministers that will
[50:06] be preaching
[50:07] and also greeting may the lord bless
[50:09] them
[50:10] as we all put our shoulder to the wheel
[50:12] special greeting as well to
[50:14] the uh the audience
[50:17] that will be on the livestream may the
[50:18] lord bless you
[50:20] and may you receive your portion
[50:23] let's just go to the word of god i want
[50:25] to invite you to three portions of
[50:27] scripture
[50:34] the first one is in the book of matthew
[50:36] chapter 4 and we'll read from verse 4.
[50:40] and then the second one is in second
[50:41] corinthians 10 we will read from verse 3
[50:46] and then the final one
[50:48] ephesians 6
[50:49] from verses 10 to 17.
[50:55] so brother theo's
[50:58] inspiration for the meetings
[51:02] i just want to read that so that we know
[51:05] exactly the theme
[51:09] it's a call to the battle
[51:14] and brother theo has got you know some
[51:15] of the the scripture readings and again
[51:17] obviously one of them being
[51:19] ephesians 6 to put on the whole armor of
[51:23] god
[51:25] and so the theme is a call to the battle
[51:30] so i'd like to start with the first
[51:31] scripture reading in matthew 4.
[51:35] if you found it
[51:41] in fact i'll read from verses three
[51:47] it reads as follows and when the tempter
[51:49] came to him he said if thou be the son
[51:53] of god
[51:54] command these stones
[51:56] be made bread
[51:58] but
[51:59] he answered and said it is
[52:02] written man shall not live by bread
[52:05] alone but by every word
[52:08] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[52:11] [Music]
[52:12] let's go to second corinthians 10.
[52:19] and we'll read from verses 3
[52:28] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[52:32] not war
[52:33] after the flesh
[52:35] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[52:37] carnal
[52:39] but mighty through god to the pulling
[52:41] down of strongholds
[52:43] casting down imaginations and every high
[52:47] thing
[52:48] that exalted itself against the
[52:50] knowledge of god
[52:52] and bringing into captivity
[52:55] every thought
[52:56] to the obedience of
[52:58] christ the final one
[53:02] ephesians 6 this is a well-known
[53:04] scripture
[53:06] especially when we are called to the
[53:07] battle
[53:12] we'll read from verse 10
[53:14] finally my brethren be strong in the
[53:16] lord and in the power of his might
[53:19] put on the whole armor of god that he
[53:22] may be able to stand
[53:24] against the wiles of the devil
[53:27] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[53:29] blood
[53:30] but against principalities against
[53:32] powers
[53:33] against the rulers of the darkness of
[53:35] this world
[53:37] against spiritual wickedness in high
[53:39] places
[53:41] wherefore
[53:42] take unto you the whole armor of god
[53:46] that he may be able to withstand in the
[53:49] evil day
[53:50] and having done all
[53:53] to stand
[53:54] stand therefore
[53:56] having your loins gird about with truth
[54:00] and having on the breastplate of
[54:01] righteousness
[54:03] and your feet shod
[54:04] with the preparation of the gospel of
[54:06] peace
[54:07] above all
[54:09] taking the shield of faith wherewith he
[54:11] shall be made
[54:13] wherewith he shall be able to quench all
[54:16] the fiery darts of the wicked
[54:18] now my message today is more focused
[54:20] around verses
[54:22] 17. and take the element of salvation
[54:26] and the sword
[54:28] of the spirit
[54:29] which is
[54:31] the word of god
[54:32] may the lord add a blessing to the
[54:34] reading of his word you may be seated
[54:35] amen
[54:46] amen
[54:49] so just to take a title this morning
[54:53] it is written
[54:56] and that's the title
[54:59] and an inspiration that i've got is the
[55:01] word made manifest in
[55:04] you now
[55:06] i mean we know where the theme of the
[55:09] the convention is we know what the
[55:10] scriptures has already said
[55:12] the stage
[55:13] for what we're about to go into
[55:16] and if we are in a spiritual battle
[55:20] because the scripture says that we're
[55:22] not
[55:23] battling against flesh and blood
[55:25] but against principalities and powers
[55:29] now
[55:30] if we in a battle we know and we know
[55:32] the prophet preaches it we know where
[55:35] this battle started
[55:37] we know that it was a battle of of of
[55:39] angels
[55:41] and that battle has now become your and
[55:43] i bet your yours and mine
[55:46] on this earth
[55:48] and so the prophet preaches a message we
[55:50] say he calls it the conflict
[55:53] between god and satan
[55:57] and so
[55:59] you know where you stand
[56:03] why because the message of the hour came
[56:05] to identify you
[56:07] came to show you exactly where this
[56:09] battle started why we are still fighting
[56:13] and how it's going to end up
[56:17] so
[56:19] you clearly know who you are
[56:22] by the message of the hour you know who
[56:24] your adversary is
[56:26] you know who god is
[56:28] and that is what the message done for
[56:30] you so in other words it enabled you as
[56:32] a soldier
[56:34] of the cross
[56:35] in this day and age
[56:37] because all of the ages it has gone
[56:39] through was elect ones
[56:42] and they were the elect ones for their
[56:44] age but you are now the elect one for
[56:46] your day
[56:47] and now you are the one that has to take
[56:49] up the battle
[56:50] you are the one that has to put on the
[56:52] armor you are the one that will be doing
[56:54] the fighting
[56:56] why because the prophet says in the
[56:57] scripture says
[56:58] that they without us
[57:00] cannot be made perfect
[57:03] so you are you are drafted
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:06] into this war
[57:08] into this battle
[57:10] so let's go into it conflict between god
[57:12] and satan
[57:14] the prophet says there is going to be a
[57:16] conflict
[57:18] he says there was going to be a battle
[57:21] he says but god equipped his children
[57:23] with the right kind of ammunition
[57:26] he turns around in that message he says
[57:28] what ammunition or what did he give them
[57:30] he says he gave his children an atomic
[57:32] bomb
[57:34] or an atomic weapon
[57:36] what is that atomic weapon he says it
[57:38] gave them that to enable them to fight
[57:41] the fight
[57:42] in other words you will be able to take
[57:44] any kind of an attack he says
[57:46] so he enabled you the very same way if
[57:48] you are in a natural
[57:50] fight in a war
[57:52] you are enabled to be able to fight that
[57:55] war
[57:56] right so listen as we go on the prophet
[57:58] says he gave them this ammunition so
[58:00] that it would sweep them all the way
[58:02] from eden to the rapture
[58:05] and so we see that the the heavenly
[58:08] conflict
[58:11] it started and it had come down into
[58:13] eden that was the first time that they
[58:15] came head-to-head
[58:19] and as we go along you'll see it now the
[58:20] prophet says why did he give them that
[58:23] weapon now if you look at the armor
[58:27] most of what what what is described is
[58:29] almost like defensive
[58:31] but there's one
[58:32] item in there that is mentioned that's
[58:34] an offensive weapon
[58:37] so in other words the sword of the
[58:39] spirit
[58:40] and the scripture says which is the word
[58:42] of god
[58:43] and that is what you fight with
[58:48] because he says in in that same message
[58:50] he says when jesus himself came into
[58:52] end-to-end combat
[58:54] with satan what did he fight him with
[58:57] he fought him with the word
[59:03] and even though he had all of the power
[59:05] within him
[59:07] he says what did he do he used the same
[59:09] weapon that god gave in eden
[59:11] to fight him with
[59:13] and what did he fight him with it is
[59:15] written whenever he came with an attack
[59:17] it is written when he came with another
[59:19] attack it is written
[59:23] now in conflict between god and satan he
[59:25] says he punched him right out of the
[59:27] ring with it is written
[59:31] and that is what you are empowered with
[59:33] to fight the fight today
[59:38] now in that same message for every one
[59:41] of us
[59:42] you
[59:43] you you have the right he says every
[59:46] believer has the right to take this word
[59:51] he says and you can fight the enemy
[59:54] anywhere you meet him
[59:57] why because our chief captain
[59:59] that showed us how to fight him
[1:00:02] with it is written and he says if you're
[1:00:04] a believer you have the right
[1:00:07] to meet the enemy
[1:00:08] anywhere you see you you encounter him
[1:00:12] with it is written
[1:00:15] now
[1:00:16] conflict between god and satan he
[1:00:18] continues he says now when all when the
[1:00:20] all-out warfare comes
[1:00:22] and the battle is set in a ray there's
[1:00:24] only one thing a real soldier can use
[1:00:28] he says a real christian soldier
[1:00:30] can use his thus saith the lord
[1:00:35] thousands may fall on my right hand 10
[1:00:37] 000 on my left
[1:00:39] but they will not come
[1:00:40] nigh or they will not come near me
[1:00:44] it is written
[1:00:46] that they will not come near you
[1:00:48] and that's how you fight the battle
[1:00:52] in a message the greatest battle ever
[1:00:53] fought the prophet says soldiers
[1:00:56] pick up the word
[1:00:58] and then he says angels of mercy stay
[1:01:01] with the word
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:04] so he identified you so he's showing you
[1:01:06] exactly where this battle started
[1:01:08] but pick up the word
[1:01:10] soldiers
[1:01:11] now the prophet turns around in that
[1:01:13] message he says i will perish one day
[1:01:16] but the word can't perish
[1:01:20] he says you young people
[1:01:22] if i if it doesn't happen in my
[1:01:24] generation
[1:01:26] you will see this
[1:01:28] and what he's done was he's enabled us
[1:01:31] to be able to take the battle on because
[1:01:32] he's not going to be it's over 50 some
[1:01:35] odd years he's off the scene
[1:01:37] but
[1:01:38] he showed you how to fight the battle
[1:01:41] because the message came with the
[1:01:42] restoration of the word
[1:01:45] and when the restoration of the word
[1:01:46] came the restoration of the
[1:01:48] power
[1:01:49] amen give the lord and the praise let's
[1:01:51] move on
[1:01:58] now the prophet says that the coming of
[1:01:59] the lord is a battle
[1:02:02] in a message the uncertain sound he says
[1:02:05] if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound
[1:02:07] who will know to prepare for battle
[1:02:10] but the message of the hour
[1:02:13] came and it was a sound of distinction
[1:02:16] in other words that shout message was
[1:02:19] the trumpet going forth and saying
[1:02:22] prepare for battle
[1:02:25] that was the message the shout message
[1:02:28] was a sound of distinction so in other
[1:02:30] words it wasn't an uncertain sound
[1:02:33] it was a certain sound to prepare for
[1:02:35] battle
[1:02:38] what what did it say
[1:02:40] behold i will send you elijah
[1:02:43] the prophet before the great and
[1:02:44] dreadful day of the lord
[1:02:46] and what will he do he will turn the
[1:02:48] hearts of the children
[1:02:50] back to the pentecostal fathers so that
[1:02:53] message was to forerun
[1:02:55] the second coming of the lord and so if
[1:02:57] the the coming of the lord is a battle
[1:02:59] we have to be unable to fight to push it
[1:03:02] on to the coming of the lord
[1:03:05] now let's continue in conflict between
[1:03:07] god and satan
[1:03:08] we know how the prophet preaches as the
[1:03:11] word of the lord is a fortress
[1:03:15] then he says let's diagnose it down
[1:03:18] why did he give the word
[1:03:21] are you ready the congregation says amen
[1:03:24] [Applause]
[1:03:25] he turns he says the word is eternal
[1:03:29] and if god made a promise that is
[1:03:31] eternal
[1:03:32] then there's no nothing nowhere can stop
[1:03:35] it
[1:03:36] why am i am i let's give the lord and
[1:03:38] the praise
[1:03:39] he says they couldn't why because his
[1:03:41] word once it is given it cannot return
[1:03:44] unto him void
[1:03:45] but it must it shall accomplish the
[1:03:48] purpose that it was sent for
[1:03:50] now he says in that quote turn every
[1:03:52] atom upside down and turn it backwards
[1:03:55] you could never pierce the word of god
[1:03:57] not one little word
[1:04:00] jesus said both heavens and earth will
[1:04:02] pass away but
[1:04:04] my word
[1:04:05] shall never fail
[1:04:08] my my mind
[1:04:09] then he says that's the best weapon
[1:04:12] there is
[1:04:14] it's the word of the eternal god
[1:04:18] now if that is the fortress how do we
[1:04:20] get into this fortress
[1:04:23] first corinthians 12
[1:04:25] by one spirit
[1:04:27] are we all baptized into one body
[1:04:32] and that body is the body of christ
[1:04:36] the prophet in conflict between god and
[1:04:37] satan he says then if you baptize into
[1:04:40] god that means then you are fortified
[1:04:43] with god
[1:04:44] and his word is your fortress
[1:04:47] scripture says he's a mighty tower
[1:04:50] where the righteous run into
[1:04:53] and they are safe
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:56] give me more volume dave
[1:05:00] i'm going to read the quote he says the
[1:05:02] name of the lord is a mighty tower the
[1:05:04] righteous run into it and are safe
[1:05:07] he's my fortress
[1:05:08] he's my buckle
[1:05:10] he's my shield
[1:05:12] my shoes
[1:05:13] my head
[1:05:14] my coat
[1:05:15] my heart
[1:05:17] my all in all
[1:05:18] god all in all he says wrap up in him
[1:05:22] i'm dead to the world i rose with him in
[1:05:25] the resurrection
[1:05:27] and that's the reason why we can say
[1:05:29] it's no more i that live
[1:05:31] but it's him that lives
[1:05:33] in you and i
[1:05:34] let's give the lord a praise amen
[1:05:38] we going well
[1:05:43] now let's go back and assist that first
[1:05:45] battle that happened on earth
[1:05:50] we go back to genesis chapter one
[1:05:55] and in a message wisdom versus faith
[1:05:59] the prophet says that faith was
[1:06:01] introduced
[1:06:03] and wisdom was introduced
[1:06:06] now we know that god is the author of
[1:06:08] faith
[1:06:10] because he gave that to his believing
[1:06:11] children
[1:06:12] in other words he gave that to them so
[1:06:14] that they could trust in his word
[1:06:17] satan came and satan gave them wisdom
[1:06:21] by reasoning
[1:06:23] and why did he do that to be able to get
[1:06:25] them away from the word of god
[1:06:28] and that is what he introduced
[1:06:31] but we come back in wisdom versus faith
[1:06:33] now remember the scripture
[1:06:35] our warfare is not carnal
[1:06:38] but it's mighty and it's supposed to be
[1:06:40] casting down all
[1:06:42] reasoning
[1:06:44] and that is what satan introduced
[1:06:47] to attack the word
[1:06:49] so we are to pull down the strongholds
[1:06:51] of satan so what does that mean and if
[1:06:53] god had introduced that to his children
[1:06:55] in the beginning
[1:06:56] we are to continue in faith
[1:06:59] we are to continue
[1:07:01] with faith
[1:07:02] because the book of hebrews says without
[1:07:04] faith
[1:07:05] it's absolutely impossible
[1:07:08] to please god
[1:07:10] and that's what he gave his children
[1:07:13] in his word
[1:07:16] for that reason abel by faith
[1:07:19] which is a revelation
[1:07:21] offered unto god a more excellent
[1:07:23] sacrifice
[1:07:24] all of the patriarchs enoch by faith
[1:07:28] walked with god
[1:07:29] until he hit the eternal highway
[1:07:33] abraham by faith
[1:07:35] walked with uh believed in god's word
[1:07:40] that he will receive a son
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:44] you can go on and on and on
[1:07:47] moses by faith
[1:07:49] jacob by faith
[1:07:50] all of the patriarchs by faith the
[1:07:52] church ages by faith you and i by faith
[1:07:59] because that was what was given in the
[1:08:01] beginning
[1:08:05] so we know that satan attacked the word
[1:08:08] by reasoning
[1:08:10] in conflict
[1:08:12] but god can't give nothing else but his
[1:08:14] word because that's what he chose first
[1:08:17] and when god makes the decision has to
[1:08:20] ever remain that way so satan took
[1:08:22] reasoning took reasonings and attacked
[1:08:24] the word and it shook eve off her path
[1:08:28] he says that's right because he
[1:08:30] introduced human reasonings
[1:08:33] so we know what happened with that
[1:08:34] battle that's right we knew know that
[1:08:36] eve lost that bet
[1:08:39] why because she relied
[1:08:42] on the wisdom that was given to her
[1:08:44] by reasoning or trying to reason god's
[1:08:47] word
[1:08:49] and we know that she broke the front
[1:08:50] line
[1:08:52] and that's when the enemy came rushing
[1:08:54] in
[1:08:55] and what did he introduce it struck the
[1:08:57] world with death
[1:09:00] and so since that time the battle has
[1:09:02] been raped
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:05] but god has prepared these people
[1:09:09] my mama let's be lord and please
[1:09:12] most of this is in conflict between god
[1:09:14] and satan
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:19] let's continue
[1:09:22] in any warfare
[1:09:24] you never underestimate your enemy
[1:09:28] he says
[1:09:30] we know that satan is way more than a
[1:09:32] match
[1:09:35] for any human being
[1:09:38] why he's got over 6 000 years of
[1:09:39] experience
[1:09:41] he says that's the reason why jesus and
[1:09:43] jesus jesus knew that
[1:09:46] he says that's the reason why he sent
[1:09:48] the church
[1:09:49] a place to be fortified by
[1:09:53] he sent them the holy ghost
[1:09:56] in other words jesus sent himself
[1:09:59] to confirm his word
[1:10:02] a little while
[1:10:03] the world will see me no more
[1:10:06] but
[1:10:07] you will see me
[1:10:08] why because i
[1:10:10] the prophet says personal pronoun
[1:10:13] will be with you
[1:10:14] even in you
[1:10:16] until the end of time
[1:10:19] so he gave himself
[1:10:21] as the weapon
[1:10:24] so what is the word of god
[1:10:28] again i'm still in conflict between god
[1:10:30] and satan
[1:10:32] he says the word of god is god himself
[1:10:36] saint john 1 1
[1:10:39] god gave the believer himself
[1:10:43] and if we are born into the wood that
[1:10:45] means that he's standing right in the
[1:10:47] forefront of his children
[1:10:52] so so so
[1:10:54] go back to the scripture then
[1:10:56] great is he
[1:10:59] that's in you
[1:11:01] then he that's in the world
[1:11:04] so who's really fighting this battle
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] the battle is not yours
[1:11:10] the battle is the lord's
[1:11:13] he's the one that's fighting the battle
[1:11:16] for you
[1:11:21] my my my man
[1:11:25] greatest battle ever fought
[1:11:27] we all know this quote the great hour of
[1:11:30] charge is at end
[1:11:33] hallelujah soldiers with armors gleaming
[1:11:37] colors streaming faith and doubt is set
[1:11:39] before is setting yourself in a ray in
[1:11:43] this tabernacle
[1:11:44] this morning he says doubt is on the one
[1:11:47] side faith is on the other
[1:11:49] soldiers
[1:11:51] stand at your post of duty
[1:11:54] hallelujah
[1:11:55] our captain the morning star leads on
[1:11:59] he never goes back
[1:12:02] no
[1:12:02] he don't know the word retreat
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:06] to be led by this chief captain
[1:12:09] he says he don't have to retreat
[1:12:12] the greatest battle ever fought she is
[1:12:15] going on right in here now
[1:12:18] it's between life and death it's between
[1:12:21] sickness and health
[1:12:22] between faith and doubt
[1:12:24] oh my brethren liberty and bondage the
[1:12:28] battle is on shine your spear soldiers
[1:12:32] put on the armor
[1:12:34] god is getting his soldiers ready
[1:12:36] and listen to this last comment he says
[1:12:38] god
[1:12:39] anoints his army
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:47] he anoints his army with his own spirit
[1:12:52] now the armies are dressed
[1:12:54] with protective gear
[1:12:55] this chief captain anoints his army
[1:12:59] now anoint is to be covered in a
[1:13:01] consecrated oil which is spiritual and
[1:13:04] not
[1:13:05] of the flesh
[1:13:07] and so this is the word of god we read
[1:13:09] through the previous quotes he says he
[1:13:12] himself
[1:13:13] comes into them to confirm his own word
[1:13:17] so it's not even you
[1:13:21] it's he himself
[1:13:24] that anoints his army
[1:13:27] my mama let's give the lord and praise
[1:13:36] the greatest battle ever thought
[1:13:39] we have to receive the word through our
[1:13:41] mind
[1:13:43] because we are free moral agent exactly
[1:13:46] our agency like adam and eve was
[1:13:50] we are made of body spirit soul
[1:13:54] and the prophet and greatest battle ever
[1:13:56] fought shows you exactly and we know how
[1:13:58] that we have the five senses
[1:14:01] for the outer part
[1:14:03] five senses and the spirit
[1:14:05] and on the inside is your soul
[1:14:08] now in the soul they can only be one of
[1:14:10] two things
[1:14:12] it can't be both
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:16] in other words faith and doubt can't
[1:14:18] co-exist
[1:14:20] so in the soul you have to have faith
[1:14:23] or you have doubt
[1:14:25] but
[1:14:27] the scripture says that
[1:14:32] we receive faith by
[1:14:34] hearing
[1:14:36] the word of god
[1:14:38] then he says
[1:14:41] now if we have our five senses of taste
[1:14:43] field smell here
[1:14:46] and if they disagree
[1:14:49] with the word of god
[1:14:51] he says don't listen to it
[1:14:53] why because the devil can use this
[1:14:55] against you
[1:14:59] then he says the five senses of the
[1:15:01] spirit
[1:15:03] which is imaginations conscious memories
[1:15:07] reasoning affection
[1:15:09] if they disagree with the word of god
[1:15:12] don't listen to it
[1:15:14] why because the devil can use that
[1:15:16] against you
[1:15:19] so we receive it
[1:15:21] through our minds he says into your
[1:15:23] spirit
[1:15:24] and the main thing is to let it drop on
[1:15:26] the inside
[1:15:28] so that he can thunder from there and he
[1:15:30] says it clears out the channels outbound
[1:15:33] so then it clears out the channels of
[1:15:35] the spirit clears out the channels of
[1:15:37] the five senses
[1:15:39] and then it's god speaking then it is
[1:15:41] god's faith
[1:15:42] in you believing his word and making it
[1:15:46] come to pass making it manifest
[1:15:50] now greatest battle ever 40 says you and
[1:15:53] i he says in that quote we're living in
[1:15:55] the time now we're culture
[1:15:57] education
[1:15:59] and a lot of things are smothered over
[1:16:01] the word of god
[1:16:03] he prays greatest battle in 62.
[1:16:07] now think about it the prophet is off
[1:16:08] the scene for over 50 some odd years
[1:16:12] he says the battle is now
[1:16:16] then he says look what a great
[1:16:18] opposition is out yonder
[1:16:21] now think about it if it is so much many
[1:16:24] more years since then till now
[1:16:26] how much
[1:16:28] of this has been going on creeping on
[1:16:31] because it's about culture it's about
[1:16:34] education
[1:16:35] it's about man's wisdom it's about
[1:16:38] acceptance
[1:16:40] because now you have to
[1:16:42] i don't even want to say same many of
[1:16:44] those things but
[1:16:46] then the prophet in that court says god
[1:16:48] wants men and women this morning who can
[1:16:50] raise up
[1:16:51] and that will say
[1:16:53] i'll take the word of god
[1:16:57] he says god's army is moving forward
[1:17:01] what are they they are men of fellow
[1:17:04] they are men of faith they are men of
[1:17:06] power
[1:17:09] he says you don't even have to be smart
[1:17:12] you don't even have to be educated
[1:17:15] he says all you have to be is be a
[1:17:17] channel
[1:17:20] for this battle
[1:17:23] that makes it so much easier it clears
[1:17:25] it up
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:27] all you have to be
[1:17:30] in this battle as a soldier
[1:17:32] as a warrior in the front line is be a
[1:17:35] channel
[1:17:38] he says god takes those channels oh god
[1:17:41] takes those little channels and he
[1:17:44] thunders out
[1:17:46] from there
[1:17:49] he just sits it sets it in order
[1:17:52] now i want to continue on this thought
[1:17:54] because we have to get the mind of god
[1:17:57] now he says your mind accepts it
[1:18:00] that's what grasps it what is your mind
[1:18:02] controlled by your spirit
[1:18:04] and your spirit catches the word of god
[1:18:06] and that's the thing that's got life in
[1:18:08] it
[1:18:09] my mind
[1:18:11] scripture says he says his word my word
[1:18:13] is spirit
[1:18:15] it brings life into you
[1:18:18] oh brother when that takes place
[1:18:20] he says when life comes down that
[1:18:22] channel into you
[1:18:23] the word of god is manifested
[1:18:26] in you
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:28] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[1:18:30] you then ask
[1:18:32] what you will and it will be done
[1:18:36] bye
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:39] now it's your mind that opens up the
[1:18:41] door or closes the door
[1:18:44] it's your mind that will listen to your
[1:18:45] conscience
[1:18:47] it will listen to your memory it listens
[1:18:49] to your affections
[1:18:51] but
[1:18:52] when your mind closes itself to these
[1:18:54] things and let god
[1:18:56] the spirit of his word come in he says
[1:18:59] it blows the rest of the stuff out
[1:19:03] every doubt is gone
[1:19:06] every fear is gone
[1:19:08] every sensation of doubt is gone
[1:19:11] every feeling is gone he says there's
[1:19:14] nothing standing in there but the word
[1:19:17] of god
[1:19:18] now listen to this
[1:19:20] and satan cannot battle against that
[1:19:24] my mind let's give the lord another
[1:19:26] place
[1:19:31] he cannot battle against it
[1:19:35] no sir
[1:19:36] he cannot battle against it now we know
[1:19:39] that that's true
[1:19:41] let's continue
[1:19:44] so what does he want in greatest battle
[1:19:45] ever thought he says god wants his
[1:19:48] children
[1:19:49] to separate themselves
[1:19:51] what do you need to separate yourself
[1:19:53] from them
[1:19:54] he says from sea
[1:19:56] taste
[1:19:57] smell
[1:19:58] conscious
[1:20:00] memories
[1:20:01] reasonings
[1:20:03] affections
[1:20:05] separate yourself from those
[1:20:07] he says and open up your mind
[1:20:10] and let the word of god come in
[1:20:13] and then he says then you march with the
[1:20:14] word
[1:20:16] he says that is a real soldier
[1:20:19] a real soldier that can separate himself
[1:20:23] from those senses
[1:20:25] and take the word
[1:20:27] and march
[1:20:28] with the word
[1:20:29] the word
[1:20:31] will make it come to pass
[1:20:33] why because it's the word made manifest
[1:20:35] in you
[1:20:38] so you almost have to do nothing but
[1:20:40] belief
[1:20:44] greatest battle ever fought
[1:20:46] as a soldier
[1:20:49] in this army
[1:20:51] you are duty-bound
[1:20:54] to carry out the captain's
[1:20:59] let's give the orders enterprise
[1:21:05] if you are drafted into this army
[1:21:09] you are duty-bound
[1:21:12] to carry out the chief captain's orders
[1:21:17] the greatest battle ever fought he said
[1:21:19] what is the captain's orders
[1:21:21] it is written
[1:21:23] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:21:26] recover
[1:21:27] that's the captain's orders
[1:21:30] it is written
[1:21:31] in my name shall they cast out devils
[1:21:35] that's the captain's orders
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:41] it is written whosoever heareth my words
[1:21:45] believes on me that's that on him that
[1:21:47] sent me has everlasting life
[1:21:51] that is the captain's orders
[1:21:54] and as a soldier you carry out the
[1:21:57] captain's orders
[1:22:00] he says that
[1:22:01] is the soldier
[1:22:04] james 4 7 says resist the devil
[1:22:08] and you won't just walk from you
[1:22:10] he won't just jog away from you but he
[1:22:13] will flee
[1:22:16] and flee is run
[1:22:18] you'll be running away like he's running
[1:22:20] away from a wild fire
[1:22:23] why because you are only
[1:22:25] carrying out the captain's
[1:22:27] orders
[1:22:29] give a lot and praise amen
[1:22:41] now
[1:22:43] let's look at the battle
[1:22:46] of matthew 4
[1:22:48] we know what happened with the battle in
[1:22:49] genesis 1.
[1:22:51] genesis chapter 1
[1:22:53] matthew 4 satan comes and he tempts
[1:22:56] jesus
[1:22:58] now the prophet says he came with the
[1:22:59] very same attack
[1:23:02] he doesn't change his
[1:23:04] tactics
[1:23:05] he came with the same attack that he
[1:23:07] started with eve
[1:23:09] lust of the flesh loss of the eye pride
[1:23:10] of life
[1:23:13] now think about how jesus had
[1:23:15] dealt with it
[1:23:18] he had all power
[1:23:22] in other words if he dramatized it in
[1:23:25] this way he had at his command
[1:23:29] the angelic angels
[1:23:33] they were that day standing ready
[1:23:37] swords drawn
[1:23:38] looking from the eternal dimension into
[1:23:41] time
[1:23:43] and just waiting for an order
[1:23:46] and they could change the whole sea
[1:23:48] in the blinking of an eye
[1:23:50] [Applause]
[1:23:51] now the prophet turns around he says but
[1:23:53] how did he fight that fight
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:56] he said satan comes with him in the
[1:23:58] first attack and he says well
[1:24:00] you are human being
[1:24:02] you are hungry
[1:24:07] and if you don't eat you're going to die
[1:24:11] if you are the son of god
[1:24:13] why don't you take these stones
[1:24:16] and turn them into bread
[1:24:20] jesus turns around and says to him it is
[1:24:24] written
[1:24:25] that man shall not live by bread alone
[1:24:28] but by every word
[1:24:31] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:40] he comes at him and again now the
[1:24:42] prophet in that message says remember if
[1:24:44] he can't get you away from the word
[1:24:47] he's gonna come at you with a
[1:24:49] supernatural attack
[1:24:53] he takes him up to the pinnacle of the
[1:24:55] of the of the the
[1:24:58] the temple
[1:25:00] and says to him
[1:25:02] why don't you throw yourself down
[1:25:03] because the scriptures
[1:25:06] these angels will keep will carry or
[1:25:09] will take charge of you
[1:25:12] but he says then to him it is written
[1:25:15] you will not tempt the lord your god
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:19] now what was he doing there
[1:25:24] what was he doing there in other words
[1:25:26] he was telling him okay you want to stay
[1:25:28] with the word
[1:25:30] but the word says
[1:25:32] if you press your foot against the stone
[1:25:36] you will give his angels charge
[1:25:38] now the prophet says what was he doing
[1:25:40] he was
[1:25:41] misplacing the word
[1:25:43] he was dislocating the word
[1:25:45] and for that very reason he wasn't
[1:25:47] quoting
[1:25:49] the word to jesus
[1:25:51] he was quoting it
[1:25:54] and that's what he done with eve
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:25:59] he says he was just putting a bit of
[1:26:01] icing over it he was trying to white
[1:26:04] wash it
[1:26:05] but jesus knew
[1:26:08] and satan did not know
[1:26:10] that this was the very word made flesh
[1:26:14] and that's why he said he said he wasn't
[1:26:16] dashing his stone against his foot
[1:26:18] against the stone
[1:26:20] don't tempt the lord your god
[1:26:24] so don't misplace it don't dislocate it
[1:26:28] and then he turns around in harvest time
[1:26:29] he says this is the very same stage
[1:26:33] that eve
[1:26:34] fell
[1:26:36] in other words for a supernatural
[1:26:38] understanding
[1:26:40] satan offered a supernatural
[1:26:42] understanding
[1:26:43] in other words uh you won't surely die
[1:26:46] because you is you his children why
[1:26:48] would god kill you
[1:26:51] but
[1:26:52] if you eat of this fruit you will have
[1:26:56] knowledge
[1:26:58] in other words you will be like god
[1:27:01] you will know the difference between
[1:27:02] good and evil now he says in harvard's
[1:27:05] time she surely received the education
[1:27:10] but because of that
[1:27:12] death was introduced into the world he
[1:27:14] says but god showed
[1:27:17] how to fight the battle
[1:27:21] don't tempt the lord your god
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:24] his final attack
[1:27:26] takes him up to the top of the mountain
[1:27:27] shows him all the kingdoms of the earth
[1:27:30] this is all mine
[1:27:33] if you only bow down and worship
[1:27:38] he says now jesus being the word
[1:27:42] knew that this would all you would fall
[1:27:43] into all of this
[1:27:45] at the end
[1:27:47] and said to him finally get behind me
[1:27:50] satan
[1:27:52] for it is written
[1:27:54] you shall worship the lord your god
[1:27:57] and him only
[1:27:59] shall you serve
[1:28:01] no other god no other worship
[1:28:04] my worship only belongs to him
[1:28:07] the chief captain
[1:28:09] let's give the lord and a praise amen
[1:28:18] now you must believe that the very same
[1:28:20] way he says
[1:28:22] when you take god's word
[1:28:26] know for certain that your faith is
[1:28:28] going to be put to a test
[1:28:32] just like noah's faith was put to a test
[1:28:36] in a message the comforter he says that
[1:28:37] noah for 120 years
[1:28:40] was tested
[1:28:42] his faith in the word of god was tested
[1:28:48] in that message he says but noah found
[1:28:50] comfort
[1:28:52] in the word of god
[1:28:54] now how do you know it's going to rain
[1:28:56] brother noah
[1:28:58] god said so
[1:29:01] that's all noah had
[1:29:04] what did they have they could prove to
[1:29:05] him well noah how certain are you
[1:29:08] that there's water up there
[1:29:11] because we in our scientific
[1:29:13] civilization
[1:29:15] which is what they had
[1:29:17] could prove to him that there's no
[1:29:18] moisture up there
[1:29:20] but what did noah have god said so
[1:29:24] he says he found comfort
[1:29:27] in the word of god
[1:29:29] now remember the scripture says without
[1:29:31] faith
[1:29:32] it's impossible to please god
[1:29:34] now like noah remember
[1:29:36] we are never he says don't stop to
[1:29:39] reason it out
[1:29:41] he says as soon as you try to reason it
[1:29:43] that is when the devil comes
[1:29:46] now remember you cannot reason god
[1:29:50] he says you can't even understand god
[1:29:53] all you have to do is believe
[1:29:55] god
[1:30:00] abraham's faith was tested
[1:30:03] and and in greatest battle ever what he
[1:30:05] said he denied everything
[1:30:08] that was contrary to what god's word
[1:30:10] said
[1:30:11] but they could prove to him
[1:30:14] your wife is past the age of
[1:30:18] childbearing in the face of that he
[1:30:21] denied it
[1:30:24] they could say to him but abram that's
[1:30:26] your wife who is now past child bearing
[1:30:28] age
[1:30:29] in a youth could not even conceive
[1:30:32] she was barren so how is this even going
[1:30:34] to happen
[1:30:35] you an old man
[1:30:37] your seed is dried up in your house it's
[1:30:39] going to happen
[1:30:41] abraham held on to god's word
[1:30:45] now the scripture says that he staggered
[1:30:47] not at the promise of god through
[1:30:49] unbelief but
[1:30:51] grew strong
[1:30:53] in
[1:30:53] faith
[1:30:55] giving glory to god
[1:30:59] so then we come to
[1:31:02] you have to have a strong hand of faith
[1:31:07] to handle the sword
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:13] faith is our
[1:31:14] victory tyrus comes to the master
[1:31:21] jesus the word made flesh
[1:31:24] says to jairus
[1:31:26] if you only believe
[1:31:28] you can see the glory of god
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:32] tyrus's servant runs up to him and says
[1:31:34] to him jairus
[1:31:37] don't bother the master anymore
[1:31:40] your daughter
[1:31:42] has died
[1:31:45] so what we should be doing is we need to
[1:31:46] go home and go make funeral arrangements
[1:31:52] but
[1:31:54] cyrus was more determined
[1:31:57] to know what the word in flesh
[1:32:00] had to say
[1:32:01] so in faith is our victory he says then
[1:32:04] what does that mean it means that faith
[1:32:06] overcomes this
[1:32:07] why because for jairus faith is the
[1:32:10] victory over death
[1:32:12] why because even though death had set in
[1:32:15] it was almost it was final
[1:32:17] but he remembered what the word in flesh
[1:32:19] said to him
[1:32:20] he said to him if you only believe
[1:32:23] you will see the glory of god
[1:32:26] and
[1:32:27] he received his daughter
[1:32:30] from the dead
[1:32:32] now faith
[1:32:34] is a victory over sin
[1:32:37] woman weighs your accusers
[1:32:40] this was the word
[1:32:42] made flesh
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:44] go and sin no more
[1:32:47] he says faith is the victory over
[1:32:49] sickness
[1:32:51] the roman centurion coming to the word
[1:32:53] made flesh
[1:32:55] and said to him master i'm not even
[1:32:57] worthy that you come into my house
[1:33:00] only speak the word
[1:33:03] and my servant will be made whole
[1:33:07] faith was the victory over sickness
[1:33:10] for him
[1:33:12] and he received his servant from
[1:33:15] the sickbed
[1:33:17] faith is our victory
[1:33:20] faith is a conqueror
[1:33:23] it isn't a peacemaker
[1:33:26] it overcomes
[1:33:28] faith is a victory that overcomes the
[1:33:30] world
[1:33:31] he says what does it do what is faith
[1:33:34] it's a conqueror conquer and victory is
[1:33:36] the same
[1:33:37] to conquer means to beat down
[1:33:40] it means to override
[1:33:43] it means to handcuff
[1:33:45] and to throw into prison
[1:33:47] it means that the son that once ruled
[1:33:49] you you rule it now
[1:33:51] it means that you have overcome it
[1:33:56] you you've whipped it
[1:33:58] in other words
[1:34:02] you are greater than it is
[1:34:05] the prophet in that quote says oh i feel
[1:34:07] religious right now let's give the lord
[1:34:09] a praise
[1:34:18] what was jesus the word made flesh
[1:34:21] and he showed to us when he came into
[1:34:23] contact with death
[1:34:25] death could not stand in his presence
[1:34:27] when he came into contact with sickness
[1:34:30] sickness could not stand in his presence
[1:34:33] and the prophet in perfect faith he says
[1:34:35] from him was flowing
[1:34:38] rivers of virtue
[1:34:40] he says it was going out constantly
[1:34:43] and for that real purpose it almost it
[1:34:45] anointed his garment
[1:34:47] that the woman who with a strong hand of
[1:34:49] faith
[1:34:51] in the word
[1:34:53] could touch the hem of his garment
[1:34:56] and her blood issue was made whole
[1:35:00] she operated the world
[1:35:03] with a strong hand of faith
[1:35:05] and virtue
[1:35:08] that was flowing from me
[1:35:10] like rivers
[1:35:13] had gone down to his garment and she was
[1:35:15] able to operate the world
[1:35:17] with a faith
[1:35:19] and made a blood issue stop
[1:35:23] now
[1:35:24] if that was jesus
[1:35:26] why was he so successful
[1:35:30] the prophet says he knew who he was
[1:35:35] he knew his position
[1:35:38] now the very same way he knew who he was
[1:35:41] you and i as soldiers of this end time
[1:35:44] have to know who you are
[1:35:48] if the bride
[1:35:49] will only know who she is
[1:35:52] and the prophet says she will one day
[1:35:55] and the rapture will go
[1:35:57] so who he knew he was
[1:36:00] he identified himself in the scriptures
[1:36:03] the prophet says in a message
[1:36:06] wisdom versus faith he know that he was
[1:36:08] that son of god that was to come into
[1:36:10] the world he knowed his standing he know
[1:36:13] he was born in the world for a purpose
[1:36:15] that's the reason the word of god could
[1:36:17] work through him
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:21] and he knew what he was
[1:36:24] he says he was a predestinated creature
[1:36:26] of time
[1:36:28] the very same way you and i are a
[1:36:30] predestinated creature of time
[1:36:33] we come from the very same source that
[1:36:35] he had come from
[1:36:36] so in other words you have to know who
[1:36:38] you are
[1:36:40] jesus and talking about that body
[1:36:43] knew that he was the predestinated word
[1:36:45] of god the person of god and that knew
[1:36:49] that he was to stand in that day
[1:36:51] and he was to be the sacrifice for sin
[1:36:53] in that day he knew his adversary he
[1:36:56] knew who he was
[1:36:59] he knew that he was the anointed one for
[1:37:01] the day
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:03] and that's the reason why he could fight
[1:37:05] him
[1:37:08] wisdom versus faith it continues now
[1:37:10] remember if you plant the seed
[1:37:12] you're expecting the life of that seed
[1:37:14] to produce itself
[1:37:16] so in other words if i plant a potato a
[1:37:18] potato will produce itself
[1:37:21] and if you and i are soaked with the
[1:37:23] seed of the of god in our hearts it's
[1:37:26] got to produce god
[1:37:29] because that's the seed that was sown
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:34] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:37:37] do
[1:37:38] shall you do also
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:42] now that's the reason in spoken word is
[1:37:44] the original seed the prophet said i've
[1:37:46] been zealous
[1:37:47] of the kind of seed
[1:37:49] that i have sowed
[1:37:51] for the body
[1:37:53] why because the real rain is coming
[1:37:57] and the reason why it's so dead son of
[1:37:59] man see
[1:38:00] is because he says when the rain comes
[1:38:04] it has to have seed to fall on
[1:38:08] and if that happens it will be the
[1:38:09] living word
[1:38:11] in other words that see that
[1:38:13] becomes the living word in you and i in
[1:38:17] the body of christ the very same way
[1:38:20] it became the living word
[1:38:22] in the flesh of jesus
[1:38:24] then
[1:38:26] the word will be made flesh
[1:38:29] once again
[1:38:31] the word may manifest
[1:38:33] in his bright body
[1:38:36] that's the reason why the prophet was
[1:38:38] zealous
[1:38:40] of the kind of seed
[1:38:42] that you are suing for the body
[1:38:46] because the rain
[1:38:48] the dynamics
[1:38:49] there to have seed
[1:38:51] to fall on
[1:38:53] and that seed has the life
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:57] to produce
[1:39:00] sons and daughters of god
[1:39:03] not denominationalism
[1:39:05] not pentecostalism
[1:39:07] he says but he produces sons and
[1:39:09] daughters of the almighty god
[1:39:12] the living word
[1:39:15] let's give the lord a praise amen
[1:39:26] perfect faith
[1:39:28] he says have faith in what the word says
[1:39:30] that you are
[1:39:31] jesus had faith in the word of god that
[1:39:33] said what he was
[1:39:36] it is written of me
[1:39:40] i am the bread of life that came from
[1:39:42] god out of heaven
[1:39:44] jesus was certain of who he was
[1:39:47] and he says you need to be you you need
[1:39:49] to come to that
[1:39:51] he says i am the tree of life from the
[1:39:53] garden of eden
[1:39:55] i am all these things
[1:39:57] he said i am i am
[1:40:00] and he was the anointed messiah
[1:40:02] that the spirit of god was upon him
[1:40:06] he said i in myself do nothing but
[1:40:09] it's my
[1:40:10] my faith in god and god was in him the
[1:40:13] word made manifest
[1:40:16] and when the word of god comes in you
[1:40:19] it's made manifest for you are the
[1:40:21] believer
[1:40:24] so in other words you are that word
[1:40:26] pride
[1:40:27] now if he said that he is the bread of
[1:40:29] life
[1:40:31] let's look at what the bread of life
[1:40:34] is says i am he said to them i am the
[1:40:38] bread of life
[1:40:39] and he said this to them at the feast of
[1:40:41] the passover
[1:40:43] the prophet says in harvest time he says
[1:40:45] he said this to them when they were
[1:40:47] eating their kosher bread
[1:40:49] commemorating the manner
[1:40:51] that fell in the wilderness
[1:40:55] but he said to them but i am the bread
[1:40:56] of life
[1:40:58] your fathers ate that man in the
[1:41:00] wilderness but they are all dead
[1:41:04] he says but i am the bread that had come
[1:41:06] down from heaven
[1:41:08] from god out of heaven and if a man eats
[1:41:12] of this bread
[1:41:15] he will not die
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:22] he said to them i am the rock that was
[1:41:24] in the wilderness
[1:41:26] that your fathers drank from
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:29] before abraham was i am
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] he was the i am that was in the polar
[1:41:36] fire that had spoken to moses
[1:41:39] in other words i am the present tense
[1:41:43] all the time
[1:41:45] that was him
[1:41:47] so if he's the bread of life
[1:41:50] that's the bread of life that we are to
[1:41:51] feed on
[1:41:53] in order to live
[1:41:55] harvest time now remember you will judge
[1:41:58] the church by their attitude
[1:42:02] towards christ
[1:42:04] who is the word
[1:42:06] [Applause]
[1:42:07] man shall not live
[1:42:09] by bread alone
[1:42:11] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:42:13] the mouth of god
[1:42:15] he says not out of the mouth of man
[1:42:18] not out of a seminary
[1:42:21] not out of a church
[1:42:23] he says but out of the mouth of god
[1:42:26] in harvest time he says man must live by
[1:42:30] that
[1:42:31] and that alone
[1:42:34] he says no man's interpretation by god's
[1:42:37] own
[1:42:38] word
[1:42:39] which is him
[1:42:42] my my my let's get lord and praise
[1:42:46] i'm almost there
[1:42:52] now saint john 1 1 in the beginning was
[1:42:54] the word
[1:42:57] in harvest time the prophet says he was
[1:42:59] the word
[1:43:00] and he also said that he wants the bread
[1:43:03] in our time he says then the word and
[1:43:05] the bread has to be the same
[1:43:08] he says because jesus is the word and he
[1:43:10] said that he's the bread
[1:43:12] now we know that the wheat bread
[1:43:14] in other words
[1:43:16] for you and i to live he says man shall
[1:43:18] not we live in the natural
[1:43:20] by a wheat bread
[1:43:23] and that weed is a substance or living
[1:43:26] substance that dies so that you can live
[1:43:29] in other words to sustain this body
[1:43:32] we live by dead substance
[1:43:35] so in other words if you're eating the
[1:43:36] fruit or if you're eating vegetables
[1:43:38] that's a it's a living substance that
[1:43:40] dies in order to sustain you
[1:43:42] in order to keep this body alive
[1:43:46] now in harvest time he says
[1:43:48] there's two kinds of life
[1:43:50] that we have to sustain
[1:43:52] by eating
[1:43:57] he says the one is natural
[1:43:59] the one is spiritual
[1:44:02] if something had to die so that we could
[1:44:04] live physically how much more did
[1:44:06] something have to die so that we could
[1:44:08] live eternally
[1:44:10] we know that the wheat dies
[1:44:13] and jesus said
[1:44:14] that he is the word bread
[1:44:18] and he is the one that had to die so
[1:44:19] that you could live eternally
[1:44:22] he
[1:44:23] is or he was the word bread
[1:44:25] right
[1:44:26] now
[1:44:28] he is the word that we are to live by
[1:44:31] harvest time he continues now
[1:44:33] he says
[1:44:35] it's not our good living
[1:44:38] and here he's addressing he says it's
[1:44:39] not you as a moral
[1:44:41] person or a good christian
[1:44:44] it's not even that he says many people
[1:44:46] can can live a moral life
[1:44:49] by choosing it
[1:44:51] and he says it's not even how loyal you
[1:44:53] are
[1:44:54] to your church organization
[1:44:57] he says but the main thing is staying
[1:44:59] with the word
[1:45:04] now think of this
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:07] the rich young ruler comes to christ
[1:45:10] he says to him
[1:45:14] i'm a good person you could prove it
[1:45:17] he says lord i've kept all of these
[1:45:19] commandments from my youth
[1:45:22] i go to church regularly
[1:45:25] i pay my tithes
[1:45:28] but
[1:45:29] he says it's how you can stay with the
[1:45:32] word
[1:45:33] but when the word in flesh
[1:45:35] told him
[1:45:37] take what you have
[1:45:39] go and sell it
[1:45:40] and give it to the poor and come and
[1:45:42] follow me
[1:45:43] he turned away from the word
[1:45:46] sorrowful
[1:45:50] he could prove
[1:45:51] that he was a good christian
[1:45:54] but it's how you stay
[1:45:56] with the word you could not stay with
[1:45:59] that word
[1:46:01] and turned away sorrowful
[1:46:03] now if he is that wheat grain
[1:46:06] in other words in harvest time the
[1:46:08] prophet says jesus was that corn of
[1:46:10] wheat
[1:46:11] that had fallen to the ground
[1:46:14] he says it was a good grain
[1:46:16] he says it was free from faults
[1:46:19] it was free from failure
[1:46:21] it was a thoroughbred grain
[1:46:24] this is the prophet
[1:46:26] he says jesus was that corn of wheat
[1:46:28] that fell to the ground
[1:46:30] he's the one that was made perfect that
[1:46:32] grain had life in it
[1:46:35] he says moses had died and could not
[1:46:37] rise again and all generations from adam
[1:46:41] was laid to the to the into the dust of
[1:46:43] the earth and did not rise
[1:46:46] that green
[1:46:47] they had life in it
[1:46:50] he's the one that said put him into put
[1:46:52] this laid his body down
[1:46:55] put it into a grave and i will raise it
[1:46:57] up again
[1:46:58] in three days
[1:47:00] and he was that first
[1:47:05] of the resurrection a new creation
[1:47:09] and so if that's the new creation if
[1:47:10] that's the cone of wheat we are to live
[1:47:12] by that bread
[1:47:14] if you want to live eternally
[1:47:17] now remember there's life inside the
[1:47:19] seed
[1:47:20] and scripture says that
[1:47:23] that this life which is spirit
[1:47:26] if the water flows over that seed
[1:47:29] it will bring the life of the seed
[1:47:32] the spirit of god comes forth and it
[1:47:34] waters that seed and it's the seed or
[1:47:37] the watering of the seed that will
[1:47:39] produce the life of the seed
[1:47:43] and so we see in harvest time he says
[1:47:45] how jesus is the word bread
[1:47:47] he says it means to be fed on
[1:47:50] if he is the word bread you are to feed
[1:47:53] on it
[1:47:54] because man shall not live by the
[1:47:55] physical bread
[1:47:58] he is the brethren that come down from
[1:47:59] god out of heaven
[1:48:02] he says keep this in mind
[1:48:04] that this is the same bread that the
[1:48:06] church
[1:48:07] through every age has fed on
[1:48:12] harvester
[1:48:14] the prophet says it has been the hidden
[1:48:16] manner just for the overcomer
[1:48:19] only
[1:48:20] in other words for each and every age
[1:48:23] he had given
[1:48:24] the wheat bread
[1:48:25] the word bread
[1:48:27] that
[1:48:28] they had fed on
[1:48:30] now in you and i and my age
[1:48:34] he is the one that we feeding on
[1:48:38] we are not feeding on a man
[1:48:41] but we are feeding on the unfailing
[1:48:44] body word
[1:48:47] of the son of man
[1:48:49] that's the hidden manner
[1:48:52] that we are to feed on
[1:48:55] my my my let's give the lord and the
[1:48:56] praise i'm almost there
[1:49:11] he says and he uses the scripture in
[1:49:13] that means in that message where he says
[1:49:15] now you know of having the form of
[1:49:17] godliness
[1:49:19] but denying the power thereof
[1:49:22] then he says now he he almost explains
[1:49:24] it and he says now what is that power he
[1:49:26] says the power is the word made manifest
[1:49:30] in other words just like paul it said
[1:49:32] the gospel did not come unto you and i
[1:49:35] in word only
[1:49:37] but it came through power and
[1:49:38] demonstration
[1:49:40] of the spirit in that message the
[1:49:42] prophet says i'm speaking of the army of
[1:49:44] god now fortified
[1:49:46] so in other words if the army of god is
[1:49:49] fortified
[1:49:50] then it's the power and then the power
[1:49:53] that they have
[1:49:54] is the word made manifest
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:57] in them
[1:49:58] you're catching a church
[1:50:01] now let's look at what happened in the
[1:50:04] on the day of pentecost
[1:50:07] in to take on the arm of god he says
[1:50:08] peter put on the whole arm of god
[1:50:12] on the day of pentecost
[1:50:15] he says what was it
[1:50:16] it was that same word
[1:50:18] that peter had walked with
[1:50:21] it was the very same word that peter had
[1:50:23] talked with
[1:50:25] it was the very same word that peter had
[1:50:27] fished with
[1:50:28] it's the very same word that peter had
[1:50:31] was on the campaign trail with
[1:50:33] in other words he was walking with the
[1:50:35] word
[1:50:36] and when he put on the armor
[1:50:39] it was the same word now in him
[1:50:42] the prophet says it was burning him up
[1:50:44] with fire
[1:50:46] in his flesh
[1:50:47] and in his soul
[1:50:49] then he turns around he says he had the
[1:50:51] whole armor of god on
[1:50:54] so what did that mean it's meant that
[1:50:56] god was making himself ever-present
[1:50:59] in his own army
[1:51:01] and on the day of pentecost he sent down
[1:51:03] the full armor of god for his army
[1:51:07] so what was it peter was anointed
[1:51:10] with the armor of god
[1:51:12] and he says what is that army it's god
[1:51:15] ever present
[1:51:16] in his army
[1:51:19] and that's the word being made manifest
[1:51:21] in you and i yeah
[1:51:23] let's give the lord a praise
[1:51:29] and if he's ever present in his army
[1:51:31] then it's he's the one that will go with
[1:51:33] you
[1:51:36] and then it's the same not it's not you
[1:51:38] that speak but it's the father that
[1:51:39] dwelleth in me because when the word was
[1:51:41] made manifest in him it was the father
[1:51:43] that dwelleth in me
[1:51:46] and all that the father was he poured
[1:51:48] into the sun
[1:51:50] all that was in the sun is now put into
[1:51:52] his church
[1:51:54] which is his bright body
[1:51:56] and now it means that you are anointed
[1:51:59] with the armor
[1:52:03] and so then it's exactly what we we know
[1:52:06] these quotes
[1:52:07] then you speak the mind of god
[1:52:10] and what you speak
[1:52:12] manifest itself
[1:52:15] why because it's the ever-present
[1:52:17] god
[1:52:19] in his army making himself known making
[1:52:22] himself manifest
[1:52:24] let's give the lord and the praise
[1:52:28] the scripture says i will not leave you
[1:52:31] comfortless but i
[1:52:33] personal pronoun will come to you
[1:52:36] and i
[1:52:37] personal pronoun will be with you
[1:52:41] even in you
[1:52:43] and so then the same way that mary when
[1:52:45] she accepted the word
[1:52:47] it brought forth a manifestation of the
[1:52:49] word
[1:52:50] in flesh
[1:52:52] and then to you and i
[1:52:54] these signs
[1:52:55] will
[1:52:57] these signs shall
[1:52:59] follow them that believe
[1:53:01] let's give the lord and the praise amen
[1:53:03] i'm almost there
[1:53:12] harvest time
[1:53:15] god looking down at jesus when the word
[1:53:17] was made flesh
[1:53:19] he says he put the dove on him
[1:53:22] in other words he claimed that part of
[1:53:23] the earth
[1:53:25] because just like you and i he was a
[1:53:27] hundred percent human
[1:53:30] the prophet says
[1:53:31] he says but when god had sent down the
[1:53:33] dove
[1:53:35] he was claiming that part of the earth
[1:53:38] jesus ate
[1:53:40] the same kind of food that you would eat
[1:53:43] in hours time he says he ate the natural
[1:53:45] bread
[1:53:46] because he had to also sustain that body
[1:53:49] he says but when god had claimed that
[1:53:51] flesh
[1:53:52] in other words where god had claimed
[1:53:54] that part of the earth
[1:53:57] he says and he will claim
[1:53:59] this part
[1:54:00] your earth the very same way he claimed
[1:54:02] that earth
[1:54:04] nothing was going to hold it he says not
[1:54:06] even death could hold it
[1:54:08] that's why he said destroy this temple
[1:54:10] and i'll raise it up again
[1:54:13] now he says then in harvest time when
[1:54:14] the man and the woman goes into god he
[1:54:16] says
[1:54:17] really when the word and him becomes one
[1:54:21] in other words when the flesh becomes
[1:54:23] the word
[1:54:24] and the word becomes flesh
[1:54:27] then he claims this part of the earth
[1:54:29] for his own glory
[1:54:32] the way he claimed that part of the
[1:54:34] earth
[1:54:37] and then that earth is cleansed
[1:54:39] how did he cleanse
[1:54:40] by his own blood he sanctified his body
[1:54:44] and he'll use that earth the same way
[1:54:48] he redeems it in other words he will use
[1:54:51] this earth
[1:54:52] the very same way he used that
[1:54:55] over 2000 years ago
[1:54:57] for his own glory
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:01] so we come to the realization
[1:55:04] that we will live
[1:55:07] by the word of god
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:10] as soldiers in the army
[1:55:13] we will live by the word of god
[1:55:15] the very same way that peter said to
[1:55:17] jesus
[1:55:20] lord we toiled all night
[1:55:24] we know that we put the net down on the
[1:55:26] left
[1:55:26] net down on the right
[1:55:28] but nevertheless
[1:55:30] at thy word
[1:55:36] at thy word lord
[1:55:38] and then every divine promise of god
[1:55:42] to you and i will produce
[1:55:44] exactly what it was sent forth
[1:55:47] why because you will have the right
[1:55:48] mental attitude
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:52] to every promise of god
[1:55:55] and the right mental attitude will bring
[1:55:57] it to pass
[1:55:59] so at thy will
[1:56:02] let's give let's just restart and stop
[1:56:04] it
[1:56:05] i'm done the musicians can come
[1:56:10] by my mind let's give the lord an
[1:56:11] appraisement amen
[1:56:14] this powerful word
[1:56:21] nevertheless lord at thy word
[1:56:25] will we do
[1:56:26] this to take on the armor of god he says
[1:56:30] again he said i will pray the father
[1:56:33] that he will send you another comforter
[1:56:36] which is the holy ghost
[1:56:38] he will abide with you forever
[1:56:41] the prophet says what is that he says
[1:56:42] it's the words it's god's artillery
[1:56:46] in the human being
[1:56:48] it's manifesting the resurrection
[1:56:52] now the prophet says think about
[1:56:54] this it's god's artillery in the human
[1:56:58] being
[1:57:00] and what is that it is manifesting the
[1:57:02] resurrection
[1:57:04] now if that is god and if remember
[1:57:06] the great he is the mighty conqueror the
[1:57:10] prophet says
[1:57:11] he's the one who conquered sickness
[1:57:15] he's the one who conquered superstition
[1:57:18] he's the one who conquered every giant
[1:57:21] he's the one who conquered everything
[1:57:23] that there was on the earth
[1:57:25] to be conquered
[1:57:29] he says he's the one who conquered hell
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:33] he's the one who conquered death
[1:57:37] he's the one who conquered the grave
[1:57:42] and
[1:57:43] he's the one who had conquered the
[1:57:45] prophet says the atmosphere
[1:57:49] ascended up on high
[1:57:52] and it come back in the form of his holy
[1:57:54] spirit
[1:57:56] and what is it now now we
[1:57:59] are more
[1:58:00] than conquerors
[1:58:02] through him who loved us
[1:58:05] why because he sent himself
[1:58:09] who is this king of glory
[1:58:12] the lord
[1:58:13] mighty in battle
[1:58:16] the prophet says he is the mighty
[1:58:18] conqueror
[1:58:19] he's the one who conquered death
[1:58:22] he's the one who conquered hell
[1:58:24] he conquered the grief
[1:58:26] and if he's the one that's in you
[1:58:28] then you are more
[1:58:30] than a conqueror
[1:58:32] let's give the lord and praise amen
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:46] the prophet says oh what an army
[1:58:50] he says like a mighty army marches the
[1:58:52] christian soldier
[1:58:54] he said great triumph he is in us
[1:58:58] not me
[1:58:59] he has already conquered it i don't have
[1:59:03] then he says to do a thing but just
[1:59:06] believe
[1:59:07] and walk on
[1:59:09] for he is risen
[1:59:11] his spirit is in us
[1:59:13] the great victory
[1:59:15] the resurrection presence
[1:59:17] is in us
[1:59:19] this is in to take on the whole armor of
[1:59:22] god
[1:59:24] now the prophet says in return and
[1:59:26] jubilee the word is the voice of god
[1:59:28] then the church will hear the word of
[1:59:30] god
[1:59:31] they'll turn every creed down they'll
[1:59:33] turn every organization
[1:59:35] every denomination that's contrary
[1:59:38] they'll serve god
[1:59:40] by the power of the holy ghost
[1:59:42] they certainly know the trumpet sound
[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:47] why because my sheep
[1:59:49] hear my voice
[1:59:51] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:59:54] he says what are you talking about he
[1:59:56] says the word you say that's god's voice
[2:00:00] yes it is
[2:00:01] in the beginning was the word in the
[2:00:03] word was with god and the word was god
[2:00:05] and the word was made flesh
[2:00:07] dwelt among us
[2:00:09] my sheep hear that they know it a
[2:00:11] stranger they will not follow
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:14] and so you and i are now this body
[2:00:18] that he had prepared
[2:00:20] a body is now prepared for me
[2:00:24] for sacrifices and offerings thou who
[2:00:26] does not
[2:00:28] but a body as thou prepared me
[2:00:31] he turns around and he says a body of
[2:00:33] believers
[2:00:38] and that is the reason why
[2:00:40] the body has been prepared
[2:00:42] because it's god dwelling in her
[2:00:45] in other words the battle is on
[2:00:48] it's the coming of the lord
[2:00:50] the coming of the lord is shout voice
[2:00:53] trump
[2:00:54] the shout went forth it was a certain
[2:00:56] sound
[2:00:58] it prepared us for battle
[2:01:02] and now he is the one that will step
[2:01:03] into it
[2:01:06] and continue it and push it on to the
[2:01:09] coming of the lord
[2:01:11] in putting on all armor of god now
[2:01:14] he says you take the sword of god with
[2:01:16] faith
[2:01:17] and cut your way through
[2:01:19] he says to any promise that god made for
[2:01:21] you
[2:01:23] if sickness stands in your way
[2:01:25] cut it out of the way
[2:01:28] that's god's promise
[2:01:30] if sun is standing in your way
[2:01:32] cut it out of the
[2:01:34] way he says you've got on the whole
[2:01:37] armor
[2:01:39] if the devil shoots his darts at you
[2:01:41] knock it out
[2:01:43] he says keep on cutting
[2:01:48] on with christian soldiers
[2:01:50] marching as to war

[2:02:09] question

[2:02:12] the brain
[2:02:14] and the mind of christ
