[49:57] reading from isaiah chapter 61 we want
[49:59] to read verse 1 to 3.
[50:02] daniel 12 1 verse verse 1
[50:05] and we want to read from romans chapter
[50:07] 13 verse 11 to 14.
[50:11] so we go to isaiah chapter 61.
[50:14] reading verse 1 to 3.
[50:17] the spirit
[50:19] and remember jesus will be using these
[50:20] same words in in in luke chapter 4.
[50:24] but this is the spirit of god upon
[50:27] isaiah
[50:28] this is christ spirit speaking through
[50:30] him
[50:31] he said the spirit of the lord god is
[50:33] upon me
[50:34] this is not for isaiah now this is him
[50:37] in the spirit speaking
[50:39] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[50:41] because the lord had anointed me
[50:44] to preach good tidings
[50:46] unto the meek amen
[50:48] he had sent me
[50:50] papers
[50:52] to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[50:55] liberty to the captives
[50:57] and the opening of the prison to them
[50:59] that are bound
[51:00] to proclaim
[51:02] the acceptable year of the lord
[51:04] and the day of vengeance of our god
[51:07] to comfort all that mourn to appoint
[51:09] unto them that mourn in zion
[51:11] to give them beautiful ashes
[51:14] the oil of joy for mourning
[51:16] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[51:19] heaviness amen that they might be called
[51:22] trees of righteousness
[51:24] the planting of the lord that he might
[51:27] be glorified
[51:28] and reading from daniel chapter 12
[51:31] reading verse one
[51:35] and at that time shall michael stand up
[51:38] the great prince
[51:40] which standeth for the children of thy
[51:41] people
[51:43] and there shall be a time of trouble
[51:44] such as never was since there was a
[51:46] nation even unto the same time
[51:48] and at that time
[51:50] thy people
[51:52] shall be delivered
[51:54] every one
[51:56] that shall be found written in the book
[51:59] that is not a perhaps that is that maybe
[52:02] every one written in that book
[52:05] shall we
[52:07] not perhaps that maybe shall be
[52:09] delivered
[52:10] a reading from romans chapter 13
[52:13] reading from verse 11
[52:15] and that knowing the time
[52:18] that now it is high time
[52:21] to a week out of sleep
[52:23] for now
[52:24] is our salvation error
[52:26] than when we believed
[52:28] the night is far spent
[52:30] the day is at hand
[52:32] let us therefore cast off the works of
[52:34] darkness
[52:35] and let us put on the armor of light
[52:38] let us walk honestly as in the day
[52:40] not in writing and drunkenness and
[52:42] chambering unwantedness not in strife
[52:45] and envying but put you on the lord
[52:47] jesus christ and make not provisions for
[52:50] the flesh
[52:51] to fulfill the lust thereof let's pray
[52:53] one more time father we thank you for
[52:54] your word come and inhabit your word
[52:56] lord and speak all through your word by
[52:59] your spirit i bless your people lord and
[53:01] take me out of the way and oh god a
[53:03] whole service today father may you be
[53:05] glorified and magnified and jesus said
[53:07] we ask it amen and amen you may be
[53:09] seated as you sit down give god some
[53:11] praises
[53:13] [Music]
[53:19] i have a title this morning another year
[53:21] of jubilee
[53:23] then judgment
[53:26] another year of jubilee then judgment
[53:28] and then i have a scripture of
[53:29] inspiration revelation 2 17 the spirit
[53:32] and the bride
[53:34] say come
[53:35] god will have a space
[53:37] for the spirit to anoint the bride to
[53:40] give that bride a voice o praise the
[53:43] name of the lord do you believe that
[53:46] so caleb and joshua they were men of
[53:48] faith
[53:49] they were men of integrity who know god
[53:51] said done in egypt i give you the land
[53:53] and that's good enough
[53:54] there wasn't there when abram was alive
[53:57] but god told abraham that you could seed
[53:59] with sigil in a strange land god will
[54:01] bring them out and they will get the
[54:02] land that they're going to possess
[54:04] so they took the word from what god said
[54:07] and they believe the word o praise god i
[54:11] give you the land that's good enough
[54:12] they run to the people the people
[54:14] mourning crying and so on but caleb said
[54:16] we are well able to possess that land
[54:18] he's not right
[54:19] but they had to fight for every
[54:21] introvert
[54:22] so it's your land yes but are you going
[54:24] to fight for it
[54:26] do you get what i'm saying
[54:27] it is your land but you have to fight
[54:29] for it
[54:30] and people have got relaxed and
[54:32] comfortable in the message
[54:34] just waiting for things to come their
[54:35] way
[54:36] but jesus overcame by the word
[54:39] oh glory you're waiting for the spirit
[54:40] but you have to overcome by the word
[54:43] oh glory to god it is written it is
[54:45] written it is written by the word
[54:47] oh hallelujah do you believe that
[54:50] thank you lord jesus now what are you
[54:53] overcoming the overcome by the word let
[54:55] me say this again god made a promise
[54:57] god made a promise you've got to have a
[54:59] battle
[55:01] if everything comes lazy what are you
[55:03] overcoming
[55:05] if everything god hand you whatever you
[55:06] want like a spoiled child you want this
[55:09] you cry for it god give it to you god
[55:10] give it to you god give it to you
[55:12] everything is just fine you're blessed
[55:14] without stress and you know people have
[55:15] their small quotations and so on but
[55:17] that's not what we are promised here now
[55:20] god tell joshua every place you put your
[55:21] foot is yours
[55:23] the land is yours but you're going to
[55:24] fight for it healing is yours
[55:27] deliverance is yours victory is yours
[55:30] joy is yours breaks you that's yours too
[55:33] oh hallelujah holy ghost overcoming
[55:35] power that's yours too
[55:37] everything got promised in there that's
[55:38] yours but you're gonna fight for it are
[55:41] you gonna fight for this morning
[55:43] i wanna salute you this morning i didn't
[55:45] even know that they said it would be
[55:46] terrible weather today
[55:48] and you did you didn't bother with that
[55:50] and it looked like god canceled the
[55:51] terrible weather
[55:53] because you had faith to come here
[55:56] bad weather praise god but you had faith
[55:58] to come this morning
[55:59] you didn't bother with the weather
[56:01] because you more burden about your
[56:02] deliverance than what the weather have
[56:03] to say
[56:04] and go go roll back storm weather rain
[56:07] go go push all that back because you
[56:09] want to get a breakthrough that's why
[56:11] you were here this morning and if you
[56:13] come for breaks you'll go we'll give you
[56:14] a breakthrough oh god is that a man that
[56:17] would lie you wouldn't lie praise god
[56:19] and bring your word for lord
[56:21] oh glory to god he bring you for
[56:22] deliverance he bring your breakthrough
[56:24] do you believe that
[56:26] so they overcame by the word of god and
[56:29] that by their testimony and by the blood
[56:31] of christ you've got to overcome
[56:33] something so you've got to have some
[56:35] obstacles
[56:37] can i hear a shout on that one
[56:39] you've got to have some obstacles
[56:42] some sickness here some pain here so as
[56:44] an obstacle god don't want to be like
[56:46] that oh you're gonna serve god well and
[56:48] you're sick in your body go want you to
[56:49] be healed i want you to prosper and be
[56:52] good health listen god desire is that
[56:54] you have good health
[56:56] god doesn't desire sick and are sick and
[56:58] sick and sick forget that you have to be
[57:00] healed
[57:01] that's what jesus came for
[57:04] for glory to god to open up the prison
[57:06] bars they said that liberty them that
[57:08] are born
[57:09] to heal the brokenhearted
[57:12] oh gloria god set you liberty listen
[57:14] bring you captive from physical and
[57:17] spiritual conditions
[57:19] let me say that again
[57:21] to bring a deliverance from spiritual
[57:24] and physical condition because they have
[57:26] demons in the physical and demons in the
[57:28] spiritual
[57:30] the physical is sickness
[57:32] all glory to god the spiritual is
[57:34] demonic activity in the lives of
[57:36] individuals but he promised to free you
[57:38] from all of that physical and spiritual
[57:42] oh and who you the son of man set free
[57:45] it's free indeed could we give the lord
[57:47] some praises this morning
[57:49] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[57:52] glory to god hallelujah
[57:55] so before jesus
[57:57] return in power
[57:59] to read the scripture
[58:01] you have to overcome
[58:03] by the word
[58:04] the lust of the acts the lust of the
[58:07] flesh and the pride of life i'm talking
[58:09] about dry wood
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:14] oh glory to god because jesus was led by
[58:16] the spirit into the wilderness
[58:19] to be tested
[58:20] and he told that devil it is written
[58:23] it is written
[58:24] it is also written
[58:26] he never demonstrated power
[58:28] to lucifer he never demonstrated power
[58:31] to the enemy he overcome by the word
[58:34] there's an overcoming by the word where
[58:36] you take the word and let the devil know
[58:38] where to get off
[58:40] where you take the word and said i'm not
[58:41] going to back down and move down from
[58:43] what god said
[58:45] because the word itself is god and the
[58:48] word of power in it devil don't believe
[58:50] that by the way that power in it
[58:52] that's why jesus said destroy this body
[58:55] and the treaties are gonna raise it up
[58:57] myself
[58:58] because he knew what david said
[59:00] he knew david spoke the word i will not
[59:03] suffer my holy one to seek corruption
[59:05] oh glory to god
[59:07] do you believe that
[59:09] so jesus
[59:10] after overcoming these three attacks
[59:13] lust of the eyes
[59:14] lust of the flesh and pride of life he
[59:17] was ready to go into the temple
[59:19] and he found the place where it was
[59:20] written
[59:21] and he read the scripture from isaiah 61
[59:24] but in the middle of that sentence he
[59:25] stopped he only stopped up to the
[59:27] acceptable year of the lord
[59:29] and he left off the day of vengeance
[59:32] of our god
[59:34] he left off the judgment part
[59:36] because that judgment part is for now
[59:39] that judgment part is for the bride
[59:42] to pick up
[59:43] and god will not hide from the brine
[59:46] what he's about to do
[59:48] praise god and if you haven't heard
[59:50] wednesday night service you need to go
[59:51] on youtube and go in the channel and
[59:53] listen to that service
[59:54] lot and his wife and i trust the lord
[59:57] brother isaac i could bring back some of
[59:58] that this morning
[59:59] but lot was god was about leaving
[1:00:02] and and he said shall i hide from
[1:00:04] abraham
[1:00:05] what i'm about to do
[1:00:07] sodom is already judged yes hallelujah
[1:00:10] your judgment is coming on and lot had
[1:00:12] this burden for abraham had this burden
[1:00:14] for his family who was done in sodom and
[1:00:16] he began to plea with god
[1:00:19] if there's 50 righteous would you
[1:00:20] destroy
[1:00:21] god said no
[1:00:23] and he plea and plea until god
[1:00:25] dispatched angels
[1:00:27] get the family out
[1:00:30] some mocked some make fun of it
[1:00:32] but there were a few that came out
[1:00:35] oh glory to god there's somebody to come
[1:00:37] out
[1:00:38] before the judgment strike
[1:00:40] there has to be a voice
[1:00:43] to say come
[1:00:44] leave what you're doing and come
[1:00:47] and just don't look back
[1:00:49] what an opportunity
[1:00:51] there was two t's on the cross oh glory
[1:00:53] to god two wretched thieves on the cross
[1:00:56] two big time bandits on the cross
[1:00:59] one say why you'll save yourself and see
[1:01:01] us also another one say lord remember me
[1:01:04] he said the right thing
[1:01:06] and jesus said today you will be with me
[1:01:09] he did not get baptized in jesus name he
[1:01:12] didn't have to come to church he didn't
[1:01:14] have to stay long and fellowship with
[1:01:15] the saints
[1:01:17] jesus said today
[1:01:19] you will be with me
[1:01:20] in paradise
[1:01:22] god made a provision for that man
[1:01:24] a final our reprieve
[1:01:27] final voice of mercy
[1:01:29] oh god
[1:01:31] mercy there was great
[1:01:32] and grace was free
[1:01:34] pardon there was multiplied for me dear
[1:01:38] my burden soul
[1:01:39] found liberty
[1:01:41] at calvary
[1:01:42] oh give the lord a shout
[1:01:45] you talk about the grace of god
[1:01:47] you talk about the mercies of god you
[1:01:50] are going to be delivered this morning
[1:01:52] by the grace and the mercies of god
[1:01:55] oh hallelujah
[1:01:57] glory to god
[1:01:59] hallelujah praise god
[1:02:01] he is making a bride
[1:02:04] hallelujah
[1:02:06] he is cutting you out now
[1:02:09] cutting you down to his word only
[1:02:12] cutting all the creeds and dogmas and
[1:02:14] everything away from you
[1:02:16] trying to get back a bride for the sun
[1:02:18] another masterpiece
[1:02:20] part of the word
[1:02:22] jesus couldn't take the place you
[1:02:24] remember
[1:02:25] when they read that in the day in the
[1:02:26] book he read just part of the prophecy
[1:02:29] he left the rest of it for the last day
[1:02:31] we are supposed to take that part
[1:02:34] you see he was cut and god wants to cut
[1:02:37] the church out
[1:02:38] like he cut the sun out
[1:02:40] like he did the bride and the groom to
[1:02:42] be his bride you must be part of him
[1:02:46] not part of the church church and
[1:02:48] brightness two different things and have
[1:02:50] church it's a bride to be part of the
[1:02:53] bride you have to be part of him

[1:04:42] you are sleeping right now under
[1:04:43] prophecy
[1:04:45] this word this morning is putting you
[1:04:47] under a direct prophecy
[1:04:49] that was spoken by a 20th century
[1:04:51] prophet

[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:05:00] let me see if i could bring it to you
[1:05:01] this week
[1:05:02] when isaiah said the virgin shall
[1:05:04] conceive
[1:05:05] mary wasn't coming for 400 years after
[1:05:07] until later but 400 years
[1:05:09] so that was text until mary come on
[1:05:13] when mary came on the scene that is not
[1:05:15] just texts that the reason for long you
[1:05:17] know that the prophecy is at hand
[1:05:20] so when the angel wanted to connect mary
[1:05:22] with that scripture the angela peter
[1:05:25] marries a hail mary they were highly
[1:05:27] favored the lord is with thee blessed
[1:05:29] are that angel join from the scripture
[1:05:32] because the time has come to anoint this
[1:05:33] woman
[1:05:34] to produce messiah
[1:05:36] nothing could stop that and have a
[1:05:38] specific person to fulfill that her name
[1:05:40] is mary
[1:05:41] no other name is we're going to be
[1:05:43] fulfilling that but mary so when the
[1:05:45] time came the angel had to find mary

[1:16:32] them things there
[1:16:33] he slew more than philistines that is
[1:16:35] dead than in his life he killed him out
[1:16:38] why because a son placed positionally a
[1:16:41] position of power that he could fulfill
[1:16:43] the purpose of god destroy the enemy you

[1:16:52] wrong your life drinking smoking

[1:17:02] guns
[1:17:02] weapons
[1:17:04] knives sword shield not for you just

[1:17:17] hallelujah which person look at the dead
[1:17:19] i think you're all there nobody looking
[1:17:21] at it yet i woke up looking forward to
[1:17:22] dead nobody talks like that nobody talk
[1:17:25] anybody want to live
[1:17:26] and you have a right to want to live
[1:17:28] jesus said i come that you might have
[1:17:30] life not exist live
[1:17:33] not survive live
[1:17:34] god over here survive and live
[1:17:37] live the abundant life live
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:53] so when man fell
[1:17:55] blood of bulls and goats was accepted as
[1:17:57] a substitute
[1:17:58] but then god was waiting for the lamb to
[1:18:00] come
[1:18:01] because only one blood was untruely
[1:18:02] accepted
[1:18:03] which is the blood of jesus christ which
[1:18:05] is the blood of god
[1:18:07] it wasn't the blood of a man it was not
[1:18:09] jewish blood
[1:18:10] i israelite blood was the blood of god
[1:18:12] that's why your voice not to conceive so
[1:18:15] what god put egg and sperm to produce
[1:18:17] the body called jesus so when he died
[1:18:19] was the blood of god and the blood
[1:18:21] released the spirit life
[1:18:23] but that blood was to answer the same
[1:18:25] question because the devil could hold us
[1:18:27] captive as long as we covered with sin
[1:18:30] but the blood was to answer the same
[1:18:31] question
[1:18:32] because sin had to be dealt with said
[1:18:34] not to be judged and the penalty of sin
[1:18:36] was death
[1:18:38] so that was required
[1:18:39] anybody to come to kingsman redeemer had
[1:18:42] to pay the price of debt and to be a
[1:18:44] kinsmen redeemer you have to be willing
[1:18:47] you have to be rich you have to be
[1:18:48] connected with man
[1:18:50] so jesus met the qualification to be the
[1:18:53] kinsman redeemer he was willing
[1:18:55] he was rich he was connected to us
[1:18:59] as a man
[1:19:00] because no angel could redeem us a man
[1:19:02] had to redeem us a worthy man a worthy
[1:19:06] kinsman so when he stepped forward to
[1:19:09] take the book when he stepped forward to
[1:19:11] die on the cross was to answer the same
[1:19:14] question
[1:19:15] once and for all
[1:19:17] oh give the lord a shout
[1:19:20] [Applause]
[1:19:22] you may be seated
[1:19:24] this same question was answered 24 7.
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:29] this was not temporary and say you know
[1:19:32] this was the answer to sin
[1:19:34] 24 7.
[1:19:38] i die for them
[1:19:39] satan say they did this he did this she
[1:19:42] did this but i die
[1:19:44] look my blood
[1:19:45] is almost like if you pay in advance
[1:19:47] so have a course look at here blood
[1:19:51] blood
[1:19:51] blood blood
[1:19:53] seven ages
[1:19:55] seven drops of blood
[1:19:57] seven mercy seats what glory every age
[1:20:00] the blood speaking
[1:20:01] on behalf
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:04] [Music]

[1:23:50] eat the book that book belongs to us
[1:23:53] it's the book of god it's the book of

[1:24:34] satan here all the time do you think
[1:24:35] he'll just give you objection

[1:24:44] whatever nations will think about me
[1:24:47] this god that i don't know delivered
[1:24:48] these people out of my hands
[1:24:51] he can't tell the nation about the
[1:24:52] plagues and the frogs on the flights
[1:24:53] that you get them
[1:24:54] all the nation's seen people giving out
[1:24:56] oh
[1:24:56] god like he lost his power like he's a
[1:24:59] cool
[1:25:01] he looked like the big fear of egypt
[1:25:03] which was the supreme power that time he
[1:25:04] got overthrown
[1:25:06] fear can handle that he said no no
[1:25:08] i can't handle that boy
[1:25:10] let me go back after them so anytime you
[1:25:12] see freedom coming
[1:25:14] that devil had to take over you know
[1:25:15] because after you get licks like that
[1:25:17] you have to let you go
[1:25:19] but when he didn't get over how he could
[1:25:21] look
[1:25:22] i hadn't kept it for so long
[1:25:25] then he coming back after you have to
[1:25:27] prove and show you're delivered
[1:25:30] and you will stay delivered
[1:25:32] you're going to accept the deliverance
[1:25:34] and tell that devil not anymore
[1:25:36] you heard me before but not now
[1:25:38] not anymore i am free i am free i am
[1:25:42] free
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:46] oh glory to god
[1:25:48] brother branham he said only satan is a
[1:25:50] squatter he don't legally own this
[1:25:53] he had two thousand years to fuss
[1:25:55] whether he wants it or not but somebody
[1:25:57] else owned it christ came as the kingman
[1:25:59] redeemer and redeem it back to us
[1:26:02] but satan satan possessed it and you
[1:26:04] know after a while this great fight is
[1:26:06] over he'll be cast into a lake of fire
[1:26:09] and he'll be done away with on those who
[1:26:11] worship with him
[1:26:12] a man lost his inheritance a squatter
[1:26:15] come on his land he could not hold it
[1:26:17] longer than 50 years
[1:26:19] and after 50 years there comes a jubilee
[1:26:23] so when you see you're going in poverty
[1:26:25] and you lost this and you lost that
[1:26:26] somebody could only hold your land in
[1:26:28] bible days under the law only for 50
[1:26:31] years and after 50 years they have to
[1:26:32] walk out they have to give up so after
[1:26:34] 50 years god pronounced a jubilee
[1:26:37] that you could go back to your
[1:26:38] inheritance
[1:26:39] you could go back as if nothing happened

[1:29:31] day was what did he have pentecost
[1:29:33] and the legal owner came down and showed
[1:29:35] it was no organization it was the

[1:29:38] that was god's earnest to this church
[1:29:40] that it would not be controlled by
[1:29:42] organization it had to be controlled by
[1:29:44] the power and the love of god
[1:29:46] so the holy ghost under pentecost proof
[1:29:48] is not a church thing

[1:36:48] and god righteousness is not what you

[1:44:08] and strain and pull like this
[1:44:10] but we already secured
[1:44:12] in christ
[1:44:14] satan can't hold you
[1:44:17] amen this is our gentile
[1:44:19] workers
[1:44:20] because god is releasing his spirit
[1:44:22] by his grace
[1:44:24] gideon wants some religion come here
[1:44:26] because we want to switch
[1:44:27] but as i want to share something with
[1:44:28] you
[1:44:29] but listen there's barramundi talk about
[1:44:30] total deliverance
[1:44:32] he said i heard brother neville along
[1:44:33] this morning back there
[1:44:35] kind of come to my mind the people are
[1:44:36] seriously getting away from deliverance
[1:44:38] it seems to be something that the people
[1:44:40] seem so they push it to the other side
[1:44:41] well god can do it but that's not the
[1:44:44] attitude
[1:44:45] moses when he was called by god he was
[1:44:48] total complete prophet
[1:44:50] and when god sends a man to do anything
[1:44:52] he completely equip him and puts what he
[1:44:54] has needed of if god comes man to be a
[1:44:56] preacher
[1:45:04] he put him something to preach and
[1:45:05] that's what he's done he sent moses to
[1:45:07] egypt and equipped him just like you if
[1:45:09] you're a christian god will make half a
[1:45:11] christians god make complete christians
[1:45:13] god will make halfway preachers but
[1:45:15] preachers can be half free and god makes
[1:45:17] his children christian but sometimes
[1:45:19] they're half the christians it's not
[1:45:20] god's intention for them to be that way
[1:45:23] it's their own ways they got mixed up
[1:45:24] with the plan of god for their life and
[1:45:26] that's what makes them that way god will
[1:45:28] make halfway preachers or halfway
[1:45:30] christians but he said moses was
[1:45:32] completely surrendered into the hands of
[1:45:34] god and that's the reason god could
[1:45:36] completely trust him i wonder this
[1:45:38] morning as christians if we have healed
[1:45:39] our own will yield ourselves so
[1:45:42] completely to god that god can trust us
[1:45:44] to a place that he put us i won this
[1:45:46] morning myself if i could be so hero to
[1:45:48] god till god could trust me could trust
[1:45:51] but i never could trust the trustee
[1:45:52] board leaking board the minister's got a
[1:45:54] place to duty to preach the gospel and a
[1:45:58] member of the church if he's going to be
[1:45:59] a member of this certain group he should
[1:46:01] not compromise if the church believes
[1:46:02] that we should not gamble that member
[1:46:04] should never touch a deck of cards if we
[1:46:06] believe in drinking he should turn his
[1:46:07] head completely from drinking if we
[1:46:09] believe not do not believe in gambling
[1:46:11] or smoking and he's not supposed to be
[1:46:12] in that at all and if we completely
[1:46:14] deliver ourselves into his hand then god
[1:46:16] can live in us christ the hope of glory
[1:46:19] he can reflect himself from us and we
[1:46:21] get ourselves out of the way then our
[1:46:23] thoughts are his thoughts could imagine
[1:46:24] christ smoking a cigar could you imagine
[1:46:26] christ praying at cards if then if your
[1:46:28] spirit is part of his spirit he wants
[1:46:30] you to be upon your confession and you
[1:46:32] permit the devil come in and take over
[1:46:34] if our hearts condemn us we we want
[1:46:36] complete deliverance we don't want a
[1:46:38] halfway church we want to be a real
[1:46:40] church or no church at all we want to be
[1:46:43] real christians or no christians at all
[1:46:44] we want total deliverance from our
[1:46:46] habits from our sins from our evil
[1:46:49] thinking from our evil doing from our
[1:46:51] negligence whatever we have done we want
[1:46:53] a total deliverance so that when people
[1:46:55] come into this church to be prayed for
[1:46:57] they'll be literal this little group
[1:46:58] maybe not over a hundred or two sitting
[1:47:00] here they'll be completely in the hands
[1:47:02] of god and when we are unified praise
[1:47:04] god in our hearts together with
[1:47:06] brotherly love obey the officer of the
[1:47:07] church and the pastor the pastor obey
[1:47:09] god then god works through the pastor to
[1:47:11] the board talking to the church and
[1:47:13] we're all together one unit for the
[1:47:15] kingdom of god
[1:47:16] and pharaoh pharaoh moses you can go but
[1:47:18] leave your children behind that's the
[1:47:20] way the devil wants a christian to come
[1:47:22] it'll be all right for you to join the
[1:47:23] church but don't ever forgive jones
[1:47:25] they'll be all right you don't have to
[1:47:27] give up you're smoking or drinking or
[1:47:28] lying or stealing you'll fall fine and
[1:47:30] back fighting you gotta give that up
[1:47:31] just join the church but moses wasn't
[1:47:33] compromised he wanted a complete
[1:47:35] deliverance he said we will not leave
[1:47:37] one hoof behind we will take everything
[1:47:40] that belongs to us then we go to worship
[1:47:42] god we will take righteousness we will
[1:47:44] take holiness we will take purity we
[1:47:46] will take all what god require that's
[1:47:48] when one night when god ordained that
[1:47:50] lamb should be killed type of christ and
[1:47:52] the blood was dipped and he said when i
[1:47:54] see the blood you had to put a doorpost
[1:47:55] on the doorpost you had to put the blood
[1:47:57] on a place where it must be displayed
[1:47:58] you cannot be a private believer you
[1:48:00] cannot be a private christian christians
[1:48:02] is a public thing you have to have the
[1:48:04] blood displayed upon your chest upon
[1:48:06] your heart upon your life and when the
[1:48:08] church shall be completely delivered
[1:48:10] when everything
[1:48:11] is brought under the blood when your
[1:48:14] sins come under the blood when you're
[1:48:15] smoking you're gambling you're cheating
[1:48:17] when you're stealing your line when
[1:48:19] everything is brought under the blood
[1:48:20] there'll be a total deliverance if you
[1:48:22] have wrong somebody make it right you
[1:48:24] can't bring that under the blood it
[1:48:26] won't steal you can't bring it something
[1:48:28] won't let you do it when yourself is
[1:48:30] completely totally brought under the
[1:48:31] blood there'll be a total deliverance
[1:48:33] and you'll have a freedom here we go
[1:48:34] you'll have a freedom like you have
[1:48:36] never known before
[1:48:38] when everything is brought under the
[1:48:40] blood brought and submissive to the
[1:48:42] kingdom of god there'll be a real
[1:48:44] deliverance
[1:48:46] and then he was saying praying dear god
[1:48:48] you don't think you don't take things
[1:48:50] unless it's totally delivered
[1:48:52] you cannot receive a sacrifice with
[1:48:54] blemish on it you would never receive a
[1:48:56] prayer with sin back in the life of that
[1:48:57] person you could not do it lord you
[1:48:59] didn't do it in the ages gone by you

[2:31:52] as brother thompson would have spoken to
[2:31:53] the church uh last sunday
[2:31:56] we uh embarked once again with some
[2:31:59] various fundraising activities in
[2:32:01] preparation for a number of things that
[2:32:03] we have to do both with respect to the
[2:32:06] building and certain requirements as
[2:32:08] well as our plans coming soon for
[2:32:12] as things are opening up get you ready
[2:32:13] for conventions in whatever way that
[2:32:15] would unfold so we want to encourage
[2:32:17] your support in whatever way you can
[2:32:20] uh we are living in a in a different
[2:32:22] kind of time we see so many things
[2:32:23] happening in different realms in the
[2:32:25] political realm in the economic realm
[2:32:27] just coming up right ahead of us gas
[2:32:29] prices going to go up and all these kind
[2:32:31] of things happening but the reality is
[2:32:33] we can be tied down to this natural
[2:32:35] because we are leaving this place
[2:32:37] we are we have to leave this place we
[2:32:38] have to do whatever we can do to leave
[2:32:40] this place so i encourage you and uh in
[2:32:42] that effort as well
[2:32:44] as uh thompson mentioned um
[2:32:47] the
[2:32:48] uh the hospitality team
[2:32:50] um is once again they have some items
[2:32:53] after service so you can be refreshed
[2:32:55] um that will be part of this process of
[2:32:58] helping raise funds so we encourage your
[2:33:00] support of that in a special way you'll
[2:33:03] find them right outside the tabernacle
[2:33:06] on the western side of the tabernacle
[2:33:09] in addition after service the sunday
[2:33:11] school
[2:33:12] members of the sun school are required
[2:33:13] to meet with a sunday school team after
[2:33:15] service
[2:33:17] just after service
[2:33:18] so as you know this week is our
[2:33:20] convention week it's easter week is a
[2:33:22] special time and as a result of the
[2:33:25] convention this coming weekend um there
[2:33:27] will be no bible study this tuesday
[2:33:29] there will be no service on wednesday
[2:33:31] but we have seven services that will be
[2:33:34] the easter convention
[2:33:35] starting on thursday at 1 pm so there
[2:33:38] will be one service on thursday at 1 pm
[2:33:42] and then on friday saturday and sunday
[2:33:44] there will be two services
[2:33:46] each of those days

[2:34:14] sunday and as a believer that's an
[2:34:16] important
[2:34:18] marking uh line for us as believers so
[2:34:20] we want the church to come out on sunday
[2:34:23] for both services eight am
[2:34:25] and one pm
[2:34:27] uh that's that declaration he is risen
[2:34:29] every sunday every time the sun raises
[2:34:31] it arises it's a testament that he has
[2:34:34] risen but as a believer isa sunday is is
[2:34:37] critical so we really want to encourage
[2:34:39] the church to make it out for both
[2:34:41] services this coming sunday 8 a.m
[2:34:44] and uh 1 p.m
