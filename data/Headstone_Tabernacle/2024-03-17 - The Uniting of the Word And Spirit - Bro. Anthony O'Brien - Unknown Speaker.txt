service this morning you appreciate song service Steven amen well we appreciate the Lord we feel is's here now amen so as we get ready to change over now to the word p of the service let's just take our bibles if we can amen praise God and um we like to read three portions of scripture amen firstly from St John 4 amen and uh Psalms 89 afterwards we'll read we just kind of jump to there just one verse in the half for8 uh Psalms 89 and then we'll jump over to 1 Corinthians 14 amen okay amen and then I also have Revelation 10 lastly amen amen sorry in the back I didn't put Revelation 89 um sorry Psalms 89 for you but uh praise God I hope you'll be able to catch up in some way Psalms 89 Psalms 89 15 okay so if if you're able to get it that's fine if not then praise God Amen but St John 419 uh we want to start from here and uh talks about the woman that the well right here's Jesus speaking oh the woman rather speaking in verse 19 says the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet Jesus answered says our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation as of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth that's you here this morning amen true worshippers for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen now let's jump over to the psalm 89 just want to read one verse there verse 15 and it says blessed is the people that know the joyful sound for they shall walk oh Lord in the light of thy countenance now jumping over to 1 Corinthians 14 Back in the New Testament and um just pick up 1 Corinthians and Revelation 10 okay praise God 1 Corinthians 14 I'm reading from verse 7 to 8 Paul says and even things without Life Giving sound whether where there is life there's sound amen praise God that's you he this morning if you have life then you have a sound that comes out you praise God to testify of the life that's in you amen he says and even things without lifegiving sound whether pipe or har uh except they they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or what is har see they must know the difference and he said for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle amen and then lastly want to read from uh Revelation 10 and uh first seven verses amen Revelation 101 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven tunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen let's stop there now and just pray one more time almighty God we thank you for your word Lord father Lord most of all we thank you for the revelation of your word father revealing to our hearts what are written in in the in the book lord father for the time is at hand Lord for you to fulfill these things and Lord You've raised up a people in the land this morning Lord who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age this morning Lord What a Mighty call you've placed upon our lives and hearts father we pray Lord that you give us unction this morning to answer that call Lord take us out of the way father Lord your Prophet said the gift is Lord father is is about getting out of the way so that a gift could come Lord and do what it's got to do Lord we surrender ourselves to your will now father and just for a few moments we just want to be captivated by you this morning Father as we hear your word Lord and as we listen and as we key in father to what you the spirit is saying unto the churches this morning granted almighty God now we pray you bless us now for a few moments as we dive into the word Lord may you bless your people and pour out your spirit here today L May you give strength to the weak Lord Lord May raise up the weary the downtrodden father give us a word in due season strengthen our ankle bones oh god father strengthen the feeble knees oh God pour faith into our hearts Lord make us to be zealous for you father Lord we be careful to give you all the praise honor and Glory minister to us now we wait to hear you now father in Jes Jesus name amen and amen glory to God you may have your seats this morning amen oh hallelujah praise God so we know that God is here this morning that's no dispute amen but what is he here to do amen well his word will tell us this morning amen Oh Glory so here we are so I have a title this morning my title is the uniting of the word and spirit and my subject is a certain sound of the true worshippers amen that's my uh title and subject this morning so I'll say that again the uniting of the word and spirit amen that's my title this morning and the subject is a certain sound of the true worshippers amen amen praise God so I was thinking about this and uh I so uh so grateful I just want to say drop off here to brother our brother gagan noid who ministered on Wednesday night praise God at a glorious message called the real you amen and if you haven't heard it you should go back and listen to it amen but we were here in the in the atmosphere while he was preaching and the anointing was just rolling off praise God Amen while he was speaking rolling off the word praise God Amen Hallelujah so we felt the atmosphere we felt the anointing and I felt praise God really truly fired up praise God after that service on Wednesday night amen God can meet you anywhere God could meet you anytime God could do anything and he could use anybody to do it you just have to surrender yourself to the will of God we thank God we have many here who were willing to surrender themselves to the will of the father amen and to be used by God so God bless you brother Gideon over amen thank you for your yielding amen and that really truly fired me up praise God and he was talking about the woman at the well too and that's uh thought was so anointed praise God I knew that there was something about that while he was talking and this week I was just meditating on the on the on the on the on the word and this word keep coming back to me word and spirit word and spirit word and spirit and that just keep riding me riding me all week and I didn't know what it was so when I come in here Wednesday night I felt like God opened up a door even more in the word amen and so as it contined to roll on into the week word and spirit word and spirit I said God it has to be something about this I began to pray about it I said Lord show it to me I don't know what it is the Bible said If any man lack wisdom let him ask God so I asked him praise God but I didn't hear anything kept on waiting and believing on the Lord amen and then all of a sudden this is my testimony I was getting ready to take a bath at 10:18 p.m. and the Holy Spirit spoke something to my heart he's praise God Amen this is Friday 15 March 2024 and the following inspiration came to me it said the true worshippers shall come forth from under the Seven Seals and when they do there will be a uniting of the word and the spirit together oh hallelujah oh the true worshippers that's you here this morning who under the seven seal under your messenger are going to step out of the seven seal and when you do there will be a uniting of the word and the spirit together oh hallelujah oh Luther at w at mechanic and Dynamics Wesley had mechanics and Dynamics but the bride today she's waiting on her Dynamics to take her up into Glory oh Hallelujah the spirit oh is getting ready to come upon that word and bring it to life oh Hallelujah you are going to be just like Jesus oh now we seek you a glass Darkly but at that day you're going to see him face to face at that day you shall know I am in my father ye in me and I in you and you in me oh hallelujah oh A Spoken Word In Due season how good it is oh Hallelujah I'm not confident in myself but I'm confident in this word we have this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh do you believe this morning amen amen so I thought well this is it this is the formula to to get to this revival that we're trying to get to to bring forth a true bride in the last day it has to come back to a formula it can't be Spirit alone the spirit fell in 1906 but the word wasn't revealed the word wasn't brought you a prophet yet so all they had was a baptism of the Holy Ghost all they had was the gifts all they had was speaking in tongues and falling on the floor praise God and receiving the Holy Ghost that's all right but the prophet said the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in Perfection and pick you up this morning and perfect You by his holy spirit oh by the word coming into you forming the word image and then the spirit is going to come and write that word in you and bring it to life it's not you that's a Believer it's a word in you that's a Believer this morning that's the reason why you shout that's the reason why you put on your shoes this morning you got up and you took a bath and you praised God for the day and you came in here it's a word in you doing that that's not you that's not your flesh there's millions of people have other things to do on a Sunday but you made it your business to come into the house of God because God has a call in your life and the devil is a liar this morning God is here the True Light is here to blast the Devils out of you and to give you the Holy Ghost and to pour his love pour his fire pour His presence somebody say Amen somebody lift your hands somebody praise God this morning let the redeem say so w hallelujah praise God the holy spirit is here and he's here to bless you this morning oh Hallelujah Oh my Jesus is speaking Jesus speaks to the woman of the well amen so let's write the word this morning amen let's get into it Jesus speaks to the woman of the well he keeps telling her about worship he keep telling her about true worship is coming forth in this scripture that we just read Jesus actually begin to connect truth and worship together do you understand that it's not just worship but truth and spirit have to come together in order for you to be a true worshipper it has to be the word and the spirit together mechanics and Dynamics together oh we had the word for over 50 years in this message since a prophet died in 1965 and went on he revealed all of the word we have all of the word this morning but where is the spirit where is a supernatural where is the anointing to accompany that word right now you suffer the reproach of barness you are saying it is coming it is coming it's not here yet but I believe that it's going to happen but that takes the spirit of God the same God that move upon the face of the waters the same God that moved upon Sarah's Barren womb the same God that came to Mary and said Thou Art blessed and highly favor the same God he said I am the Lord I created a human bodyy and I can bring you back from whatever disease is afflicting your body I can raise you up for such a time as this the same God that God is here this morning that God is no respect to our persons the only thing that God wants to see this morning is when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth do you have faith this morning then somebody say amen hallelujah it's a new season it's a new time our faith is declaring it the baptism of the Holy Ghost the skies are dark with the Pentecostal rain that's about to pour out upon you this morning we declare it this day oh hallelujah it's a new day this morning is a new morning this service is a new service something is about to break get on fire for God this morning and lift your hands and give God worship and give God praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah we're blowing a certain sound this morning it is not an uncertain sound it is not an accident it is not a floops it is not a VAP it is a certain sound and when you hear it you will know your name is on the book and you was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire Give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah I'm on fire this morning Oh Glory I see the opening of the word I see the Mysteries [Applause] revealed do you see it this morning oh if you see it then you can worship oh my so stay on fire this morning amen God is a spirit he said he's a Spirit he's not your flesh he's not your friend in the corner he's not the Cornerstone manager no no no no no he's a spirit he's unseen by the naked eye your senses can't pick him up you can't see him with your eyes you can't smell him with your nose you can't touch him with your hand that's because he's a spirit so the only way to contact that spirit this morning there's one sense that God give to the believer to contact the spirit out there it's faith faith is the only thing is the only currency that God will accept this morning and if you have faith as small as a mustard seed if you have a few change of faith in your pocket this morning just a few change of Faith you could move mountains you could Hallelujah you could pull God on the scene just have a prayer in your heart say Lord I need you Lord I Want You Lord I'm desperate I feel so dry I feel feel so thirsty oh I never felt so thirsty oh I'm like a thirsty land a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and to see thy Glory as I have seen in the sanctuary I know that you are ped up before but this morning I want more I want more I want more I want more it's down in my soul it's a feeling I need the Holy Ghost in order to make it I'm desperate this morning oh God send on the Holy [Applause] Ghost Hallelujah is there a cry to get in the spirit is there a passion to know the word is there a fervent desire to please him this morning [Applause] oh my so God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you got to be in the spirit this morning you got to get caught up in the things that God is doing say Lord whatever you are doing this morning don't leave me out of your program don't leave me out of where you're moving I want to move with you I want to go where you go I want to walk where you walk one time the prophet came and did Miracles and somebody missed it she said no no no don't worry about it just show me where he walk and I'll walk where that Prophet walk and she was healed oh it's just a blessing to be able to walk where he walked oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh I don't need a bride will be able to walk in Christ bloody Footprints oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh Hallelujah so we want to walk this morning we want to walk in the spirit cuz that walk in the spirit of God are the sons of God not in your flesh not in your past mistakes oh when we come to church here we come to shed off human desire we come to tear off everything oh legitimate things sometimes we have to put it aside on a Sunday morning to meet with our God because that is what chokes the life of the seed sometimes it's legitimate things oh cares of this life form a Vine around your precious little seed plant and begin to choke the life out of it this morning but I pray God give you spiritual vitamins oh H spiritual vitamins this morning to allow that seed to take on life without hindrance after to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temper Temperance come on now to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godliness brotherly kindness God's going to pour in you all the vitamins so that you can grow and become this pyramid life amen that's got to come off the board and it's got to come into you amen do you believe that this morning oh my so we know that the spirit of God Must Fall can we say Amen amen the spirit of God Must Fall we know that the spirit of God will fall that is for certain isn't that right amen but before that can happen the truth of God's word had to be sown throughout all the Earth isn't that right all these years so that when the Spirit Fall it'll be a uniting of the word that was sown by Malachi for uniting with the spirit together to produce true worshippers which is you here this morning oh and you have received the word just like Mary did when the angel come down and said y Mary Lord bless and highly favored Mary said be it done unto me according to Thy word and that was it right there she received the word from the Angel and the moment she did that something begin to happen in Mary something going to form in Mary you come out a Catholic Church you come out a Baptist you come out a Methodist you come out of the world out of Hinduism and Muslim and everything else and something in your heart something in your life responded to the word that was being preached and from the moment you received it something begin to happen in your life some of you might have backslid some of you might have walked away some of you might have felt discouraged but that didn't discourage your seed the seed was still there torment waiting to be activated wait to begin to pip out to begin to cry to begin to [Applause] groan cuz the seed has one destination it's got to make it to Perfection you see that's one destination not two and three and five and six no one destination it's got to go back to its maker again it's got to go back to its creator and the Creator knows his creation that's why he know there's only a time limit on your feeling down there's only a time limit on your being bound there's only a time limit the devil praise God is parading his beef on your life but he has a time limit this morning because everything that had a beginning has an ending your trial has a beginning and it will have an ending your persecution had a beginning and it will have an ending your Darkness had a beginning and it will have an ending because the Eternal Word of God that God put inside your soul cannot fall to the ground it shall accomplish the purpose that he sent it for you are going to be a royal seed Son of God daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost sealing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father oh somebody help me Praise Him [Applause] [Music] so we know be are uniting of the word and the spirit together and the difference that it'll make when the spirit Falls will be the seat that

that Holy Spirit is not me we are not the Holy Spirit you are not the Holy Spirit I am not the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is Spirit of Jesus the Same Spirit that dwelt in Christ and when he lay on the cross the Bible said he gave up The Ghost and the spirit that dwelt in him was tore out of him that spirit is what comes back upon the worshipper when you are align yourself with the word of God when you please God when you walk in a way that he loves that attracts God and that is what attracts the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit follows after the word in you it's hungering it's pressing to

was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made Bible said in him was life and this life was the light of man it is in that life and in that light that we walk this morning oh he is the light of men not the light of wisdom not the light of intelligence of this world that's not the light of men that's the light other men walk in but the truth is they don't walk in light they walk in darkness intelligence always promises them a new light to come forth a new frontier a new design a new thing to happen but all it is is Satan's devices upon the Earth devising a scheme to take away time from you no wonder they call this a smartphone device it is a device from the enemy it is a device from Lucifer devising against you devising to

move upon us move upon the church he did it once he did it once the Garden of Eden when man had finished his work for the day the spirit of God come down upon the cool of the evening and said Adam Adam Where Art Thou oh hallelujah what have you been doing what have you been up to oh Adam say Here I Am Lord oh today was a good day today looks good I love how the garden is coming along praise God what did you do today Adam and God would have fellowship with man oh since back there the spirit has been communicating with man but when man fell from that communication God Spirit yearn to restore the communication that he once had with man in the Garden of Eden that's what all these prophets up from men for that's what Moses was about that's what the Tabernacle was about that was God coming back down to man showing man the approach how to get back to him Bridging the Gap he did it through the blood of bulls and goats but he always knew that it had to be on a higher level than that oh how that he promised to send a lamb to send a perfect one a sinless one a matchless one who would pay for the sins oh of all the world Jesus said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son

Prophet said we are predestinated to it the church by the for knowledge of God has been predestinated Hallelujah he said to what to his honor by his grace to the glory and worship of Glory of God he said papa papa God sitting back there in the beginning self-existent nothing around him but Prophet said he wanted something to worship so he foreordained and put their names your names in the Lambs Book of Life and when he was slain before the foundation of the world that they might appear to his glory and to his Praises at the end time what are you here for to give him glory and Praises at the end time somebody's going to worship him some true worshippers this morning are going to step out of the pages of the Bible and they're going to profess the day of the avengeance of their God oh the

moved from that uh God by his election and Grace said called you God by his election and Grace Sanctified you isn't that right God by his election and Grace he called you called you out of your mother's womb separated you that wasn't a choice that he you made that was a choice that he made before the foundation of the world you didn't choose yourself but God by his election cra slipped a wedding band of Grace upon your finger when you didn't even know yourself he committed himself to saving you in this time and this season oh hallelujah hallelujah he say all that the father had given me they are going to come my sheep know my voice A stranger's voice they will not follow we have not followed the voice of a stranger we have not followed the voice of a man we have not follow the voice of the enemy but we follow the voice of the shepherd the true Shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ and it is a certain sound this morning oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah my where am I at oh God okay God by his election Grace and power baptize you put you into this land of rest which you have entered into this rest has ceased from their going astray they cease from their works like God did from his and they have joy unspeakable the prophet said you have joy unspeakable he said and full of Glory the tree of life is blooming in them they have longsuffering gentle goodness patience patience made fate faith and meekness he said gentleness and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their Hope Is Anchored In Christ Jesus Oh the real reason why the tree of life is blooming in me is because my roots are anchored in the love of Jesus Christ oh the secret to the top of the tree is what's going down below my tree look nice and wonderful oh Hallelujah but if you look halfway down you're going to see how deep these Roots really grow oh Hallelujah and though this this tree be swayed this way and that though the canker worm and though the caterpillar and though the Palmer worm come to eat off that tree because the roots are there God said I will restore sayth the Lord all the years that you have lost all the years that the canker and the caterpillar and the Locust and the Palmer will God could speak like that why because the roots are deep the life is coming down from in [Applause] there if your roots was buried in hatred and animosity and grudges and oughts and all kind of things then what kind of fruit you think you will bear it'll be rotten fruit it'll be terrible fruit Jesus said are your fruits you shall know them that's why the bride will have lovely fruits Galatians 5 love joy peace longsuffering all those fruits will be bearing why because when you look down inside there'll be roots oh Hallelujah buried in the love of God buried in Christ Jesus all the trials all the testings all the persecutions all the things that you went through was only to push your roots deeper deeper deeper deeper in the love of God it hurt you it cut you God was pruning you that was God working his way out he let you go through this trial he let you go through this test he let people walk on you he let people devalue you he let people throw you in a corner tell you you wasn't good enough tell you was a nobody but nothing they could say about you could ever change a seat of God that he put inside your soul the devil is a liar he didn't put it there and he cannot take it out you are predestinated to be filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire hallelujah hallelujah oh and you shall know I the father in me I you [Applause] [Music] oh no wonder this Pride will be an invincible Army no wonder she will be undefeated her her defenses will be impregnable because Satan cannot penetrate a Believer who is anchored in the love of God anchored in Christ Jesus if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is dwelling in your mortal body there are not enough devils in Hell a billion Devils couldn't stop you because greater is he that is inside of you he is your [Applause] Victory he is the glory he's a lift of my hand tremendous Victory oh my God gives victory in every trial in every test in every persecution oh he gives Beauty for Ashes he gives strength for fear oh Hallelujah he clothe oh the righteousness and meekness and humility oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's going to clothe you he's going to put his rainbow CU coat over you he's going to put his quat of multicolors on you his coat of many colors it's quote of faith quote of virtue quote of knowledge quot of Temperance what is that that had nothing to do with Joseph that was his father's love upon Joseph and because God has love upon you he set his love upon you he's going to Crown you with love and kindness in the morning and with tend the mercies which are new every morning he'll give you faithfulness in the night faithfulness to his promise faithfulness to keep his word oh Hallelujah [Applause] just as the qut that Joseph wore distinguished Joseph from his Brethren all of his other Brethren look one way but Joseph was looking the different because he was clothed with a coat of many colors there was a revelation behind that that we only now begin to see as a prophet and unfold of the word we begin to see God's favor upon Joseph nothing against Joseph but it was God working his way out of Joseph God knew where he wanted Joseph he had to drive him out from among his Brethren Joseph had to be rejected he had to be despised he had to go through hard stuff oh but though he slay me yet will I trust him some of you didn't even know the road that you would have to walk down but God has been with you he said I never leave you I'll never forsake thank you David said I never see the righteous forsaken or his seed peeg bread oh he hasn't forsaken you he hasn't forgotten you he shall not forsake the work of his own hands how could I forget Israel are engrave in the palm of my hands every time God look at his hands he cannot forget Israel how much more can he not forget about you this morning oh but when the cries of his people go up to him God remembers his promise this morning you've got something to do you've got to cry you've got to pray you've got to seek God you've got to get on your knees you've got to get on fire you've got to do your one thir you've got to worship you've got to come with the right mental attitude towards every Divine promise of God because that is what will bring the promise to pass [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh just praise him this morning don't look at me I'm just lost right now in the word I'm just speaking you just ride the word and see what will happen it's not me it's not Anthony o'ban who am I I'm nothing I'm a 35 year old if I die in the morning it doesn't matter but this word is what has come to you this morning this word cannot fail this word is promised to our visitation for you and for your families oh your wayward son your Wayward Daughter that going to return home the spirit of God oh he's going to break the bands of wickedness break the bands of Filth break the bands of disease break the bands of FS of change that have been binding the people and

on the mountain and he said you worship your God he give them time to do their do and after they cut themselves and they cry and they cry and they did all that they could do oh and then Elijah said all right now it's all time now now it's all time to show who our God is and he built an altar oh and he dug the trenches and he dug for water and they pour water and pour water oh Hallelujah Hal because he knew that the god that would answer my fire would consume everything oh Hallelujah water can't stop God oh God from pouring out but we've got to do all we got to do and then God will do what he can do he can pour out the spirit he can pour out the anointing he can heal the sick he can raise the dead oh we are here to water the seed that was planted all these years we build an altar oh and say where is the Lord God of Elijah let that part be God this morning let the god that answer by fire let that God come down and consume the sacrifice of the true worshippers in the house of our God [Applause] oh my oh my [Applause] [Music] H all right you've been a fine audience amen God bless you Jesus let's run along now amen so in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth isn't that right and the Earth is without form and void now notice the first thing that happened was that the spirit of God begin to move upon the waters and the waters what does it represent multitudes of people multitudes of people denomination there was chaos it was void and there was Darkness there was confusion all over right now there's confusion all over there's Darkness there's chaos isn't that right cross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the people that's the day that we living in right now in a lan age oh many are blind and miserable poor naked and don't know it but the spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters this morning and the first thing that God did oh hallelujah hallelujah is to speak oh and the voice of God today is promised to speak oh in a bride that is on the earth she will have th say the Lord or she will keep still oh it's not what the Prophet said oh and that voice will be veiling a bride and that voice in the beginning spoke and said let there be light oh and today God is getting ready to speak one more time isn't that right but that voice will be veiled in a bride on the earth Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come oh that voice is getting ready to strike the bride when the church finds his brother love when the church Finds Its holy decency and when the church Finds Its place in Christ then she will say to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us we have found a coin that is lost Revelation 22:17 do you see it now amen so faith is a revelation isn't that right we struck it earlier you cannot have faith unless you have something that is revealed to you isn't that right it was revealed to Abraham that he was going to have a son and he had faith for 25 years God promised 25 years brother Pell I'm going to have a son doesn't matter what my flesh says doesn't matter what my body says doesn't matter what my wife says doesn't matter what the schools say what the job say what my education says I'm not walking by my education I'm not walking by the feelings in my body but I'm walking by the faith that is in my soul based on what God has revealed to me oh God has to reveal something to you in order for you to have faith faith is a revelation of God's word isn't that right and it was revealed to Noah that rain would fall and he had Fai for 120 years that rain would fall he preached it in season out of season Lord there's going to come rain comeing I and I come into the ark Come Thou and thy family into the ark he preached it and what do you know it did rain but that was a faith that was in Noah that was being tested all those years and he stood upon the word that was revealed to him can we say Amen so today it is revealed to the bride that the prophet Malachi for truly did come to restore all things even the seven Thunders which are the seven voices of the seven Church ages even the mystery that was hid from ages and ages and generations and generation which

be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and that body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ 4 hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies oh you're

under this seven seal they are going to step out they are the predestinated ones that is you here in this building doesn't matter if you don't feel like it that doesn't change a prophecy that is hanging over your soul didn't matter how Mary felt didn't matter how Sarah felt that promise is unto you that promise is unto your children and as many as a far off God's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire there's a prophecy upon the seed this morning thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy there's possession power laying in your seed this morning rise up and trim your lamps rise up and pull out your swords this morning we are born and able to possess the land somebody say Amen somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah Glory 1 Corinthians 14:8 if the trong be given a certain sound who shall prepare himself for the battle how will we know what to do if the sound is uncertain and call it an unscriptural sound so an uncertain sound is an unscriptural sound no wonder our souls can connect with all the interpretations that's going on in the message they're saying this they're saying that they're talking about tents and horses they saying the Holy Ghost has already come when we got it to get oh when we got a holy ghost to get some of them say they already adopted some of them City already positional Place how can you say that when signs wonders of Miracles are supposed to accompany that bride when she's manifest in the word of God these sign shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils oh wait until the s00 utter their voices operative word is to wait you're supposed to wait until that Spirit comes upon you then he will do the same works that he did when he was in what it was in Jesus oh if that same spirit that dwelt in Christ raised Christ from the dead what shall it do to us here this morning it will Quicken it will Quicken it will Quicken your [Applause] body oh and the spirit comes down upon you when you become the word then he the spirit of truth comes down upon you and guide you into all truth oh and shows you where it is written oh for your season and hour and time amen oh my do you believe it it's an unscriptural song and if the bride body hears today an unscriptural sound how will we know how to prepare impossible because it's uncertain we don't know what to do with that when they in the Army there's an alarm there's a trumpet for every alert that goes off isn't that right there's a certain trumpet to get ready for battle there's a trumpet to wake up in the morning there's a uh whatever they call it amen a Special trumpet a special song they have special songs the US military has special songs when somebody dies and they sing that and they have the procession isn't that all right and they bring the casket and the military men marching step and they carry the flag on the casket and they know exactly where to stop exactly where to rest it down exactly when to turn around exactly when to walk away praise God there's a sound for everything and if the trumpet give an un certain sound how are we going to know what to do if you are not in the Army if you wasn't trained when you hear the trumpet you just run around with a chicken like a chicken out his head chopped off you just be running around no don't know what to do but the soldiers they they know what to do when they he w w walk they know when to get ready they have the knife right by the pillow they have the gun right next to them they lying on sleeping but they know when they hear a certain sound they know where the boots is they know where the socks is they know where the pants is they know where the uniform is they know where the helmet is they know where the bag is they know where the torch light is they know what to grab to get out of there because bombs getting ready to fall I wouldn't know what to do when I hear War War I start to run up and scream like a mad man because I'm not trained but they are trained they train to Get Up 3 in the morning and pull the trigger and shoot the enemy off in a Flash because they trained to do that and God has a bride on the earth this morning she is trained for that final for that final great kill oh God's got a bride on Earth God's got a crop growing somewhere for that last great Killen oh is there a group this morning oh is there a group this morning that knows the spirit of God is out there somewhere that's trained to hear that certain sound the prophet said I'm identified with a group that can feel the spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's real that knows he's the same yesterday a group that knows how to worship a group that knows how to praise God a group that knows how to kick off the no praise demons a group that knows how to not sleep in church how to get on fire for God a group that knows how to get on fire and worship and praise and Shout I'm identified with that group this morning how about [Applause] you and a bride today if she has an unscriptural sound how will we know what to prepare but the the Bible said Psalms 89 and we read it blessed are the people that know the joyful song Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared un his service the prophets there's that sound again isn't that right and the bride has to hear a certain sound in order to prepare for the coming of the Lord is isn't that all right Hallelujah and on the first seal 1963 Prophet said no more more we could understand these things until the time come for it for us to be for it to be understood he said oh my let me say that again no more we could understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood and that is this time now praise God isn't that right cuz in order to go in the upper room you understand and have to be open to the scriptures to know what to look for because you be in the upper room on your phone or you be in the upper room trying to fix your belt or out of the spirit entirely because you don't know what you're there for but the Bible said they were praising God continually they were seeking the Lord they were taring waiting in the upper room because their understanding was F was open to them to know what they were there to receive oh H right and that's what all these years was about the word was preached to us revealed to us recycled back to us to show us how to prepare a certain sound has been sounding out all these years getting a bride ready for great translation fate getting a bride ready seven ters shouting their voices out to gather up bride together to get her ready to hear from her Lord so that Spirit out there somewhere is getting ready to Quicken the word to the bride oh Hallelujah and we know without the shadow of a doubt that the ministry of the spirit is here to Quicken the word to that bride this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah and that's what we're here for today amen every service what do we come for the ministry of the spirit oh the change of season the time that we long to see when the spirit will take a hold of the word and bring it to life oh is that what you're here this morning for that's what I come this morning for that's what I come under expectation for for that last great kill oh for the seven tunders to finally utter their voices to that group who could take the word of God and hand it there so that it could slice and cut and shut the heavens they could do whatever they want to when those seven tunders really order their voices oh isn't that right oh my and said the prophet said oh my seven tunders of Revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation FEI isn't that right the seven T Revelation 10 is the only sound it's a certain sound to prepare you for the coming of the Lord oh might to prepare you for the Rapture prepare you for the battle isn't that right oh Hallelujah seven manifestation one Holy Spirit sounding of the seven Thunder Jubilee trumpet Revelation chapter 4 amen Prophet said there's no uncertain sound about it he said there was nothing uncertain to John when he heard that voice say come up and he come up amen and when Lazarus was in the dead and in the grave and his sold a 4 days journey somewhere the prophet said I don't know where it was at I don't think any of us does know where it was at but he said wherever it was it didn't make a bit of difference he just made one summons to a man that the skin worms had been eating his body up stinking in the grave but that clear sounding trumpet said Lazarus come forth and there a dead man rotten shook himself and come out of the Grave walking he said there's nothing uncertain about that who said is there Brethren no uncertainty there and he said it's the same thing tonight when a clear sounding voice says sinner I'll give you eternal life repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the prophet said that is the summons nothing uncertain about that it's a clear sound this morning oh the Holy Ghost the word is being preached to you with great plainness of speech arise thy light has come arise let us pray uh let us call upon the Lord let us do all that we can do get the sin out get the trash out get the distractions out God is getting ready to pour out the Holy Ghost upon planted word in this message in this church oh there are True Believers in here that's going to be anointed and commissioned and arise to the challenge of the hour that is you here this morning give the Lord a shout of Praise Give the Lord a shout of Praise Lazarus was dead but when that voice shouted out Lazarus come forth he shook off the skin worms he shook off the Dead Oh all the process of dying rolled away oh God could do it in a moment and this morning I don't care how far gone you feel I don't care how rotten you feel I don't care how messed up you feel oh all you need to hear this morning is the voice of God thundering into your soul and all that the enemy has done will be wiped away in a moment when the voice of God thunders in your soul hallah oh may he Thunder to you this [Applause] morning oh my hallelujah oh my Hallelujah the prophet said I'm a witness that it's true he said there's other Witnesses millions of them throughout the world today that's a witness that it's the truth that when the Bible comes the words of God every word of God he says is a trumpet every sound of the word is a trumpet the gospel trumpet amen and when it sounds he said it's the truth oh we know know the sound of it oh we hear the sound of the abundance of rain and we know that rain is going to fall something in our souls tell us that is true something in our souls wake us up this morning wasn't your alarm clock it was a life that God put in your soul that's what made your eyelids pop

Hallelujah millions of them throughout the world today is a witness is true hallelujah oh right and when it sounds the truth he said when it said Christ the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said there's nothing uncertain about that he is the the same yes sir repent he says and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said there's nothing uncertain about that he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die you can't die if you are living in Jesus Christ this morning he said believe it thou this nothing uncertain about that he shall live Prophet said he that eat my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life he said and I'll raise him up again in the last days he said there's nothing uncertain about that oh nothing he said it is a certain sound he said oh I know it I heard it myself the prophet said my poor Irish heart one day he said I was a little old sinner he said how could it ever do for me he said but I believed that it was a certain sound and he said I accepted it and he said and I am a witness that it is true and many of you here this morning are witnesses that it is true that when the voice of God speaks to the individual you can never be the same again you can never come to church the same way again you can never be backslid the same way again because something shook you out of your largy out of your laziness out of your weedness I Heard a Voice it called my NE I Heard a Voice oh Michael is on the earth this morning and he's here for deliverance he's here to draw his sword to deliver every name that is on the book of The L Book of Life he's here of P AP ize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire oh he's here to deliver you from out of the hand of the enemy and take you to a land our Holy Ghost Land of promises where there's joy

the world or we'll go out out of the world for there's no uncertain about that trumpet yes sir yes sir no uncertain sound anytime Prophet said he sounds today when he calls us and it's just the same as when he tells us anything amen amen third seal Prophet said now that's the reason today that the revivals we supposed to have he said we have the nomination revivals we've had a but we haven't had a real stiring no no no no no sir don't think we have Revival no we haven't we've seen the blessings of God but we haven't seen the power of God yet what we are believing for this morning is for the power of God to strike the church oh the prophet was so anointed till days after he had to pinch himself he didn't know whether he was in a dream or whether he was in a vision he said you know the blessings of God but you don't know the power of God when the power of this church Rises that is going to bring the Brethren the women won't be able to cook they'll turn over the pots oh they'll start praying for their meals and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost will sweep into the house and refill them with the Holy Ghost and Fire the little children on the ground screaming receiving the Holy Ghost Devil's being torn out of them Revival after Revival may it start in your home may it start in your life the Revival begins with you the Revival begins with us here this morning what we see ought to make every soul into action to make a church that will make a Revival oh do you believe it today hallelujah oh my we have a no no no they've got millions and millions and millions and millions of church members millions and millions today isn't that right big congregations big denominations but no Revival nowhere God shut the heavens isn't that right the same seven T of Prophecy that shut the heavens praise God it's got to open our Heavens isn't that right Hallelujah and that seven T has got to be spoken it will unlock the heavens when you speak it by Revelation oh hallah the truth has be revealed and then you could connect with the prophecy oh and prophesy from the book that that seven tunder Revival will break forth oh you got to connect with it spirit and Truth after un night together and then we'll see the full power of the Holy Spirit upon the church isn't that right oh my the bride has not a Revival yet you see no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet just like he moved upon the face of the waters isn't I that we talked about earlier no manifestation to S the bride yet see we're looking for it now it he'll take those seven unknown tunders back there to wake her up again see he said he'll send it he promised it do you believe it this morning do you believe he'll send it do you believe he promised it then let's get ready for it let's stay on fire for it this morning amen Revelation chapter 4 all right he said it was voices how we need in Jeffersonville today thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and humility praise God walking around the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians oh that's what we need today real Christians he said that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil What Hurts The Enemy this morning is to see that Sanctified and holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move right on you're living this word and the spirit of is upon you oh to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils just as sweet as ever manifesting the word in your day and season oh they believe it this morning just as sweet as it can be oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil praise God is now right so we know that people in the message today they don't know who worshiping isn't that right Jesus said in Matthew 15 this people draw it nigh unto me with their mouth and honor it me with their lips but their heart is far from me oh Hallelujah don't let your heart be far from him this morning because wherever your treasure is there's where your heart will be also so build your hopes this morning on things Eternal don't build your hopes on your car don't build your hopes on your house don't build your hopes on your education those things will perish but we have received the kingdom this morning that cannot be shaken that cannot be moved God is going to build his Rock his church upon the rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ oh build your house on a foundation that will stand this morning oh my hallelujah oh but in vain do they worship me praise God teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men isn't that right but the B son of Christ miss you

other thing is accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he borns in there he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Jesus Christ is projecting itself through you oh that's what I come for this morning I didn't come to church just to occupy space or to sit there on a Pew but I want his life to be injected into my soul I want his life to be injected into me my life is killed my life died my Will dies on his brass Altar and the life of Christ comes into my soul oh I feel like Samson this morning let me die with my Philistines I want to be killed I want to be slain on God's PR Altar and let the Holy Spirit inject his own life into my soul yet not I but Christ that liveth within me oh is that your desire this morning one thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever oh Hallelujah is that right this morning

praising God right now that's the reason we're worshiping him oh we know that he's going to pour out he's fixing to pour out upon us oh to the skin will destroy his body yet in my flesh I shall seek

Daniel heard the seven tunders and forbidden to write it John heard it voice voices and the Book of seal and the back of the book of seal with Seven Seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God would be finished in other words the prophet said God would be known to his church oh God will be known to you this morning you are going to know him you are going to understand there's coming forth another Ephesians to this and in that Ephesians you are going to understand it because a Ministry shall be ministered to you into the Everlasting Kingdom and entrance into the abundance of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory oh you're going to know who you are you're going to know who God is you're going to know what he is his nature his being all about God you're just going to not only about his Works you're not going to know how he does it but you're don't going to know why he does it oh because you were predestinated before the foundation of the world because God had a bride in the beginning and he's going to have a bride in the end to confirm the word that he gave to his Prophet Malachi 4 and when that bride raises up with signs wonders and miracles she will say this is that that was spoken by the prophet Malachi 4 5 and 6 the sick is being healed the blind is is seeing the is walking the gospel is being preached in his power here it is receiveing the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God amen amen manifesting time oh we're almost there praise God the prophet longed to see this day but he couldn't see it how privileged we are this morning God raised us up for such a time as this to see what the prophet couldn't get to the experience what the prophet longed to see the word coming into view coming into reality he knew it would come to reality he just didn't live to see it but he knew it was coming and so do we today we know something is coming forth from the Lord the prophet said I know it for a fact just as sure as I'm standing in this Pulpit God's going to visit a bride with a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost the sh kind of Glory the light of his countenance the glory of God is going to come down and fill the Tabernacle not only this building but it'll fill your Earthly vessel your Earth and Tabernacle will be filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire oh every fiber of your being will be vibrating

wonderful thank you so much oh I know I've been long with you oh but we getting ready to close out oh Hallelujah he said the God be finish in other words God will be known to his church not in three people but as one person he said that the mystery of God would be revealed and when it was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries would open to the church because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out him moving In and Out Among Us showing his signs of him being alive among us living among us and then we'll be worshiping the living Christ that is Among Us oh do you believe it this morning so what are we looking for Supernatural element oh Hallelujah is this the time of the end the prophet said the mystery is here here's the mystery he said a mystery is a scripture oh that is previously hidden truth but now divinely revealed but watch which is a supernatural element that still remains despite the Revelation oh what does that mean despite the Revelation despite the word that was revealed to us all these years there Still Remains a supernatural element that our heart is crying out for this morning that Supernatural element we want it we need it we got to have it musician can get ready we want to see that glorious that wonderful outpouring of the Holy Ghost pour out upon us pour out upon this church pour out upon the little children pour out upon the young people break the back of the enemy crack the back of Satan break the fets break the Yoke break the unbelief that same spirit that triumphant

again uniting to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bringing back that this could only be done in this day only in this day when all the loose hands has been gathered together the only time it could be done is right now it never was attacked anywhere else they went off on denominational spree but now it don't belong to no denominational spree because it is time for the uniting of men and women every race every color every Creed everything under Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the word hallelujah oh you can begin to stand you can place on this sof I'm almost finished uniting time for the church oh my uniting under every word that's been scattered all abroad by these organizations ever since n in Rome isn't that right they were organized together

fails to be perfectly on the knot he said you see with uniting time we see Nations united we see the world uniting we see communism uniting we see the churches uniting and we see God uniting himself with his bride until he and the church is the same thing Hallelujah he says like the pyramid right there oh right uniting themselves together God uniting why because never before since the early church was a pillar of fire ever among the people never before since he the church did they ever see the things that they're seeing today and this was only made possible when God sent the Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it and sent seven angels down from God out of heaven and God bring back that scattered word oh Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah he brought back that scattered word in [Applause]
