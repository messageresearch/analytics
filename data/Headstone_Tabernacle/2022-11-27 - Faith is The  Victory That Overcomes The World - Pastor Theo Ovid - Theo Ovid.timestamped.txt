[38:56] Lord in Jesus
[38:58] amen God bless you welcome it's good to
[39:01] be here let's go into the word amen we
[39:05] have three portions of scripture this
[39:07] morning one from first John chapter 5.
[39:10] you want to read from verse 4 to 8.
[39:13] oh we also want to look at first John
[39:16] chapter 2 15 to 17. and also Hebrews 11
[39:22] was five and six
[39:26] reading first John chapter
[39:29] 5 verse 4.
[39:35] for whosoever is born of God
[39:38] overcome it the world
[39:40] and this is a victory that overcometh
[39:42] the world
[39:43] even our faith
[39:45] who is he that overcoming the world but
[39:47] he that believeth that Jesus is the son
[39:49] of God
[39:50] this is he that came
[39:52] by water and blood even Jesus Christ not
[39:55] by water only
[39:57] but by water
[39:58] and blood
[40:00] and it is the spirit that buried Witness
[40:03] because the spirit is truth
[40:08] for they are treated bear record in
[40:10] heaven
[40:11] the Father the word and the Holy Ghost
[40:14] and these three are one
[40:16] and they are treated by a witness in
[40:18] Earth
[40:19] the spirit the water and the blood
[40:22] and D Street agree in one I want to go
[40:27] to First John chapter two
[40:28] wanna read from verse 15.
[40:31] it reads love not the world
[40:35] neither things that are in the world
[40:37] If any man loved the world the love of
[40:40] the father is not in him
[40:42] for all that is in the world the lust of
[40:44] this flesh the lust of the eyes
[40:47] and the pride of life is not of the
[40:49] father but is of the world
[40:51] and the world passeth away and the lust
[40:54] thereof but he's a do it the will of God
[40:57] provided forever allow scriptures of
[41:00] Hebrews 11
[41:02] and it's from verse 5. and it reads by
[41:05] faith Enoch was translated
[41:08] that he should not see that
[41:10] and was not found because God had
[41:12] translated him
[41:14] for before his translation he had this
[41:16] testimony
[41:18] that he pleased God and without faith is
[41:21] impossible to please him for he that
[41:23] coming to God must believe that he is
[41:25] that he's a rewarder of them that
[41:28] brilliantly seek him let's pray one more
[41:30] time father we thank you for your word
[41:31] and Lord you know all the chopped up
[41:33] words and things here and you just you
[41:36] could put it together father take me out
[41:38] of the way and lay your spirit flew upon
[41:39] your world and quickly to your people in
[41:41] Jason may ask it email name and you may
[41:44] be seated
[41:45] praise God thanks for coming this
[41:47] morning
[41:53] you wouldn't want to come to church and
[41:55] preach the empty benches
[41:57] so you make the effort to come and I
[41:58] pray that God richly reward you and
[42:00] bless you
[42:01] for coming out this morning
[42:05] uh
[42:08] I want to read that first John 2 15 to
[42:11] 17 and the Amplified before we continue
[42:13] it says here do not love or cherish the
[42:17] world or the things that are in the
[42:19] world
[42:19] if anyone loves the world love for the
[42:22] father is not in him
[42:24] for all that is in the world the lust of
[42:27] the flesh craving for sensual
[42:29] gratification
[42:30] the lust of the eyes greedy longings of
[42:34] the Mind
[42:35] and the pride of life
[42:37] Assurance in one owns resources or in
[42:41] the stability of Earthly things
[42:44] these do not come from the father but of
[42:47] the world itself
[42:50] and the world passes away and disappears
[42:53] and with it the Forbidden Cravings the
[42:57] passionate desires the lust of it and he
[43:00] who does the will of God and carries out
[43:03] his purpose in life abides and remains
[43:06] forever
[43:07] it isn't that something
[43:09] title this morning faith is the victory
[43:12] that overcomes the world
[43:15] as the title this morning faith is the
[43:17] victory that overcomes the world I have
[43:19] a subject of Being Born Again by The
[43:22] Incorruptible seed of the word of God
[43:26] I have a little team it's the truth
[43:28] because God said so
[43:31] once God said it it's the truth and this
[43:34] scripture this are being born again of
[43:36] the incorporable receipt of the will of
[43:38] God that came from First Peter chapter
[43:40] one verse 22 State senior prefab your
[43:42] souls in obeying the truth
[43:45] see truth is not just to hear
[43:48] but truth has to be obeyed
[43:50] obeyed obeying the truth through the
[43:53] spirit under unfake love of the Brethren
[43:56] see that you love one another with a
[43:58] pure heart vividly being born again not
[44:02] of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[44:05] by the word of God which liveth and
[44:09] abide it forever
[44:10] and then Peter give this reference for
[44:12] all fleshes as grass
[44:14] and all the glory of man as the flower
[44:17] of the grass
[44:18] what happens after a while the grass
[44:21] wither it the flower falleth away
[44:24] but the word of the Lord endured forever
[44:27] and this is the word which by the gospel
[44:30] is preached unto you so just as grass
[44:33] just fade away on the floor fall off so
[44:36] the glory of man and all the lust there
[44:37] are gonna feel they're gonna fall off
[44:39] one day
[44:40] isn't that right
[44:42] all right
[44:51] was there
[44:53] and they're telling the Believers that
[44:55] your prayer even stands Beyond debt
[44:59] if somebody die doesn't stop their
[45:01] prayer
[45:02] that's a powerful taught him
[45:04] Hallelujah just think about it now so I
[45:07] was saying you don't know some
[45:08] grandmother might have prayed for you
[45:10] another grandmother or grandfather might
[45:12] even be around right now
[45:14] but their prayer was held before God
[45:16] they die and gone on but that person
[45:18] before God waiting for you to God for
[45:21] answer that prayer on your behalf before
[45:23] you can't stop praying for your children
[45:25] your family your loved one you can't
[45:26] stop that because your prayers are
[45:28] living before God your prayer is being
[45:31] born in a Bible God could see your
[45:34] prayer he could hear your prayer your
[45:37] prayer going to be answered don't stop
[45:38] praying because when I feel this and
[45:41] you're not seeing me no Beauty
[45:43] it is dry whether it's scratchy whether
[45:46] you don't see you you're like no keep on
[45:48] praying glory to God I will say remember
[45:52] that when Isaac put the blessing upon
[45:55] Jacob
[45:56] and Jacob thought was Esau and the
[46:00] blessing went upon uh
[46:02] um
[46:03] Jacob and when Esau came
[46:07] he said Esau
[46:11] the father said but I put the blessing
[46:13] on that other son already
[46:15] watch this he couldn't take it back
[46:18] he couldn't cancel it he couldn't undo
[46:22] it oh Hallelujah he had to take what we
[46:24] mean because it already called his mouth
[46:28] that's how powerful it is
[46:31] hallelujah and one more one more when
[46:34] Abraham told abimelech that Sarah was a
[46:38] sister which was a lie and which was
[46:40] kind of thrown away but but it wasn't
[46:41] the truth
[46:42] God frees every woman in that house
[46:45] foreign
[47:16] foreign
[47:53] it is
[47:58] let's get over into the world this
[48:00] morning
[48:02] question and answers
[48:04] question you said a person could live so
[48:07] close to God that he could not sin while
[48:10] he on Earth
[48:11] then explain
[48:14] first John 1 8 to 10.
[48:17] so but I'm going to read first John 1 8
[48:18] to 10 and the Bible says if we see we
[48:21] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[48:23] truth is not in us if we confess our
[48:25] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[48:27] us our sins and say cleanses from all
[48:29] unrighteousness if we say we have not
[48:31] sins we make him a liar and the wisdom
[48:33] in us well now with my with my dear
[48:36] brother just turn right over to the two
[48:38] chapter the ninth verse you write on the
[48:41] same page in my Bible eight verse to
[48:43] begin with
[48:44] and then but I'm gonna read he that
[48:47] committed sins of the devil for the
[48:49] devil's Sin from the beginning
[48:51] for the purpose the Son of God was made
[48:54] manifest that he might destroy the works
[48:57] of the devil just what I've been talking
[48:58] about God predestinated knowing you
[49:01] whosoever are these other scripture
[49:03] whosoever is born of God
[49:06] does not commit sin for his seed will
[49:10] ruin it in him and he cannot sin because
[49:14] he is being born of God that's just
[49:17] that's just what the word says now if
[49:20] you watch here if we say we have not
[49:22] seen we make him a liar and the word is
[49:24] not in us now some people say well no
[49:26] here's just a good little girl or a good
[49:28] little boy you never seem to begin with
[49:30] you are born in sin you are shared
[49:34] iniquity you come into the real speaking
[49:36] light so when you are born in this world
[49:39] you are a liar you are a thief you're
[49:42] everything there is just all this sin
[49:44] not a thief because you have been stolen
[49:47] that's right you are not a liar because
[49:49] right but the spirit is in you when you
[49:53] are born because you are in the world
[49:54] and that's the reason you can't have
[49:57] Reformation you've got to die and be
[50:01] born you can't you have birth without
[50:03] crucifixion underlying that you cannot
[50:06] have but without crucifixion you can't
[50:10] have a resurrection you must be
[50:11] crucified to the things of the world in
[50:14] order to be resurrected in Christ
[50:16] so if you're going to depend upon your
[50:18] intellectual conception you'll never be
[50:20] born of the spirit of God you got to
[50:23] forget that all you ever knowed I know
[50:26] nothing except Christ Jesus and be born
[50:29] on you see it's a bit that makes you a
[50:33] new creation the very Greek word here it
[50:37] says it means creation you are a new
[50:41] creation there's a warrior creature is
[50:43] the word creation you are New Creation
[50:45] not of the world but in Christ Jesus he
[50:49] was in the world you know fancy things
[50:51] fine clothes
[50:52] Pretty Brown Eyes to a girl will be here
[50:55] for the ball you know and something
[50:56] another to attract attention or lustful
[50:59] or drinking the Bible said if you love
[51:01] The World and Achieve the world the love
[51:03] of God's not even you so in order to get
[51:05] that out of you
[51:07] you have to die
[51:09] you have to be crucified
[51:11] buried and resurrected a new creation in
[51:15] Christ Jesus now this is the truth
[51:18] because God said so this is the word say
[51:21] Amen somebody Hallelujah so therefore
[51:25] you will receive the Holy Ghost
[51:27] before you receive the Holy Ghost you
[51:31] are believing unto eternal life but you
[51:34] do not have eternal life until you
[51:37] receive the Holy Ghost because it is
[51:39] eternal life the Holy Ghost is God it is
[51:43] God's life in you then you got eternal
[51:46] life do you understand it now you are
[51:49] believing unto it there's a good thing
[51:51] you woman excuse me for this if it
[51:53] sounds too flat
[51:55] but still a baby isn't born if you treat
[51:58] that baby right and follow the rules of
[52:00] nature that baby will be born normal but
[52:02] if you don't apply everything to the
[52:03] Rules of Nature and get a hard bruise or
[52:06] hit is going to ruin you it's killed the
[52:07] day before it's born well that's the
[52:09] matter the bruises come from Satan and
[52:12] Satan takes the poison that's of hell
[52:14] and try to boost the church that's
[52:17] intervened with a baby
[52:19] before it's ever born
[52:22] they kill it but if you just take the
[52:25] Bible and nurture it give the baby food
[52:28] the mother taking vitamins and this is
[52:31] the best vitamins I know of it builds
[52:33] you up now the church ought to be taking
[52:35] spiritual vitamins and the vitamins is
[52:37] right here A whole book full of them
[52:39] praise God and that little father oh
[52:41] he's got life
[52:43] and the little cells are moving
[52:47] King and moving but he isn't born here
[52:50] that means the baby is in the womb but
[52:53] the baby hasn't been born as yet is that
[52:56] life
[52:57] it's kicking but it's not born here
[52:59] let's continue but as soon as he's
[53:01] brought into the world the doctor holds
[53:03] him up give him a spanking and wow there
[53:06] he goes he starts breathing and just as
[53:08] soon as he breathes the bread of life
[53:10] then he becomes a living soul
[53:12] and that's the thing sometimes you
[53:15] receive you are ready to receive the
[53:18] Holy Ghost you are in travail you are
[53:20] wanting to be delivered how many in here
[53:22] in that shape right now wanting the
[53:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost really want to
[53:27] know what it is and you want to get into
[53:29] it who wants the bathroom Holy Ghost
[53:31] raise your hands he said you are in
[53:33] travailable you are wanting to be
[53:35] delivered could imagine
[53:38] wanting to be delivered because you are
[53:41] pregnant with a child
[53:43] you are pregnant with God
[53:45] Hallelujah
[53:46] glory to God
[53:48] amen and what you need is a little
[53:51] gospel spark sometime when you scream or
[53:54] Glory I know you think I'm crazy but we
[53:56] have the mind of Christ
[53:58] which is craziness to the world
[54:01] Hallelujah let's continue brother
[54:03] Branham if possible for a person to be
[54:06] lost
[54:07] and end up in hell
[54:10] if he rejects the light of the word even
[54:13] though he has a genuine experience of
[54:15] justification and fanfiction yes sir
[54:18] that's exactly right when you use the
[54:21] expression that if we do not believe the
[54:23] word we will be eternally separated from
[54:26] Christ do you mean the foolish version
[54:28] of living eternally but they will be
[54:30] separated from New Jerusalem where
[54:32] Christ will dwell with the bride here
[54:34] are those who do not have the Holy
[54:36] Spirit born again as the scripture
[54:38] speaks of being born again if the
[54:40] natural birth requires water blood and
[54:42] spirit does not the spiritual birth
[54:44] requires all three stages of grace
[54:47] before a person is truly Born Again
[54:49] absolutely
[54:56] he said absolutely the three stages are
[55:00] required now we get into something just
[55:02] bear with me and I explained this
[55:04] morning on the same thing you've got to
[55:06] have all stages
[55:08] you are begotten of the spirit
[55:11] just like a baby is begotten in the womb
[55:15] of a mother but not born until they
[55:19] receive the Holy Ghost that's right you
[55:22] are born then
[55:23] you are not converted you are in the
[55:26] possession of being converted until that
[55:28] time
[55:29] and then he went under some deep stuff
[55:31] that's the reason
[55:34] all these great Mysteries
[55:37] could not be given to Luther
[55:39] could not be given to Wesley could not
[55:42] be given to the AHS passed us by
[55:44] depending on eight why it wasn't time
[55:47] they will be gotten
[55:50] oh hallelujah praise God so that meant
[55:54] the Pentecostal was still in the womb so
[55:56] God didn't bring Mysteries to them
[55:58] because they were still inside the womb
[56:00] but brother Branham came to introduce
[56:02] the person of Jesus Christ which is the
[56:04] fullness of the word
[56:05] and you're gonna be born by that word
[56:07] the incorrupt Of The World God take his
[56:11] way and pack it up and wrap it up as a
[56:13] seed to be preached
[56:15] and that is what being preached to you
[56:17] and then the secret comes now the word
[56:19] is in the bride hallelujah oh God
[56:23] mystery wrapped up in a seed and he
[56:24] slipped that seed inside of you and the
[56:27] devil can't do anything about it
[56:29] Oh Glory to God because the secret is
[56:31] out your room is already closed you can
[56:34] get pregnant for somebody else
[56:37] call your room is sealed up Let the word
[56:40] of God oh Hallelujah
[56:45] praise the name of the Lord he said it
[56:48] couldn't come before now
[56:50] hallelujah praise God so this person of
[56:54] the Holy Ghost is what balram came to
[56:56] introduce us to
[56:58] Hallelujah the person of God which is
[57:00] the word of God isn't that right bless
[57:02] the beaten of the Lord
[57:04] let's continue
[57:06] now watch it will come to a head in the
[57:09] last days
[57:10] that it will be this the seed of God and
[57:13] the mark of the beast two spiritual
[57:14] Powers working together and anyone knows
[57:17] that the Sea of God is the boot right
[57:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:22] Ephesians 4 30. see see it's the United
[57:25] States in a statement you know you have
[57:26] a scripture to back up what he is saying
[57:29] so you know it's a scriptural voice that

[57:34] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[57:36] are sealed till the day of your
[57:38] Redemption when they were born again
[57:41] they were filled with the Holy Ghost the
[57:43] holy spirit is the new birth we know
[57:45] that you are begotten of the spirit I'll
[57:47] admit that but until you are born there
[57:50] is a baby is begotten in the mother's
[57:52] womb that's got a kind of a life it's a
[57:55] life little cells in the body twisting
[57:57] and kicking and jumping but when it is
[57:59] born it has a squeal and it become a

[1:15:41] is in the womb we are groaning now
[1:15:42] groaning laboring getting old and
[1:15:45] sickness everything will be sitting it
[1:15:47] and the spirit on the inside of it looks

[1:15:53] growing twisting jumping because there's
[1:15:57] a life in Deer that lives forever it's
[1:16:00] in my body has got to die and just as a

[1:16:05] a spiritual body so outside the baby's
[1:16:07] room outside the mother's womb as a
[1:16:09] spirit waiting to catch the baby and
[1:16:11] when the baby is born the spirit slips

[1:17:28] natural baby the spiritual body got it
[1:17:30] the Earth will drop and the body of the
[1:17:32] natural will drop and the physical body
[1:17:34] or the celestial body will grab it
[1:17:36] Yonder if this early time might be
[1:17:38] dissolve we have one waiting that's the
[1:17:40] reason you forget the things of the
[1:17:42] world they are dead to you oh glory to
[1:17:45] God hallelujah
[1:17:47] he said the Holy Ghost is the new birth
[1:17:48] we know that oh praise the name of the
[1:17:51] Lord It's been born again of the spirit
[1:17:52] of God you're fighting to live in an
[1:17:54] eleven to die
[1:17:58] fighting to live
[1:18:00] get a piece of paper
[1:18:01] to get this and get that and afterwards
[1:18:04] again
[1:18:07] and you know what you can't pay for
[1:18:09] health
[1:18:10] you can't pay for peace you gotta pay
[1:18:12] for Joy you can't pay for relationship
[1:18:15] people Crush others get into the power
[1:18:17] of riches they step on their friend they
[1:18:20] step on the family they step on the head
[1:18:22] at this one and that one they cut off
[1:18:23] this one and do what kind of thing at
[1:18:25] the end of the day they're all alone
[1:18:27] on top of money
[1:18:29] that can't get them life that Target
[1:18:31] them Joy they don't hear my peace
[1:18:34] Hallelujah they're going down and
[1:18:36] they're worried because they ain't know
[1:18:38] where they're going they're just going
[1:18:38] down Hallelujah they are the best
[1:18:41] doctors they paying for but their body's
[1:18:43] still going down because the prophet
[1:18:44] tell us there's only four years of light
[1:18:46] and one going out in their twenties
[1:18:48] another one in your 30s another one in
[1:18:49] your 40s and one more remaining and
[1:18:52] regards to what food they eat is that
[1:18:53] one more light remaining
[1:18:54] Oh Glory to God hallelujah but I am
[1:18:58] saying that this is not the only world
[1:19:00] there's another world
[1:19:01] and we have a bunch of Heroes and saints
[1:19:04] that gone on before and they are
[1:19:06] dependent upon us because they without
[1:19:08] us
[1:19:10] not made perfect so this church has got
[1:19:13] to come to perfection
[1:19:15] oh glory Lord God Hallelujah in other
[1:19:18] words this church has got to come to
[1:19:19] charity because charity is that
[1:19:21] Perfection so to get the charity and
[1:19:23] they started with faith and faith is the
[1:19:25] victory that overcomes the world so you
[1:19:28] have to come to Victory God don't want
[1:19:31] to bring you to victory you must come to
[1:19:33] Victory somehow
[1:19:36] somehow you've got to come to Victory if
[1:19:39] you're not Victorious now you will be
[1:19:40] but there is no Escape in it no problem
[1:19:48] with the life of Faith Abraham lived by
[1:19:51] it just I live by it Samson live by it
[1:19:53] Moses in my head you are gonna live by
[1:19:56] it the church shall live by faith
[1:19:58] thank you
[1:20:01] it's not a one-time Act is alive
[1:20:07] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:20:12] God
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:18] remember when somebody falling
[1:20:22] don't make him anyways
[1:20:28] and people in Pride and probably because
[1:20:30] he falled understanding like if they
[1:20:33] controlling their standing
[1:20:36] he said don't make it worse help him
[1:20:38] help him up
[1:20:42] try to get him back
[1:20:44] to Brotherhood again
[1:20:47] the Brotherhood of God that my Christian
[1:20:49] friends has been my vision of what the
[1:20:52] world needs today
[1:20:55] is back to God and I'm doing my very
[1:20:58] best and I intend to keep on doing all
[1:21:00] that I know how to bring a man back to
[1:21:02] God and to bring a Brotherhood and a
[1:21:06] feeling of Christ among the people
[1:21:10] that is why a minister shouldn't tell
[1:21:12] the people everything but Abraham said
[1:21:13] that
[1:21:16] when you tell the people all kind of
[1:21:18] thing now the people fight
[1:21:23] that's why I never give it to you
[1:21:27] about UEFA fight preacher no church
[1:21:30] nothing that foolishness I never been
[1:21:32] unified oh God they're doing me and the
[1:21:33] same me I will deal with them for myself

[1:23:21] let me continue
[1:23:23] thank you
[1:23:25] you know
[1:23:27] you would like to know what I think is
[1:23:29] the greatest need of the church today
[1:23:31] where I think is lacking is no soul
[1:23:33] travail
[1:23:35] the people are not broke up enough
[1:23:37] there's no burden seemingly
[1:23:40] you give me somebody to talk about lost
[1:23:42] souls they cry they want to revive us so
[1:23:46] bad they can hardly eat if you read the
[1:23:49] history of the world a religious history
[1:23:51] you'll find out it always taking that
[1:23:55] kind of a spirit
[1:23:56] to bring a Revival
[1:23:59] so what is the prophecy on the fourth
[1:24:01] seal he said the bride
[1:24:03] hasn't had
[1:24:05] our Revival yet
[1:24:07] there have been no
[1:24:09] manifestation of God
[1:24:11] to stir the bride
[1:24:13] he will send it
[1:24:15] it will take those seven Thunders to
[1:24:17] wake up the bride again
[1:24:19] he said if the churches will forget
[1:24:20] their Creeds and plead the promises it
[1:24:24] will become effective to them so they
[1:24:27] are promises we have to plea holy say
[1:24:29] Lord you promise it he had to harass God
[1:24:31] for it God wants to see who's the best
[1:24:34] knockers not just not ones who knock it
[1:24:37] so when you're knocking on God says he
[1:24:38] again yes it's here again there's me
[1:24:39] again tomorrow you hear me in the
[1:24:42] morning I'm knocking in the evening I
[1:24:45] want the door open I reckon I didn't
[1:24:47] even open it yet but you will have me on
[1:24:49] your hand because I am one of them
[1:24:51] knockers in the last days until the door
[1:24:53] open I am knocking because I want to
[1:24:56] testify I knocked I want the door to
[1:24:58] open I don't want to give my testimony I
[1:25:01] just knock you know no I want it open so
[1:25:04] you're gonna hear from me they're going
[1:25:06] to hear me again and boy your ass is not
[1:25:08] death and when you have to stay here I
[1:25:11] know you're not worried that's why
[1:25:13] you're playing I'm wearing because I
[1:25:15] have more
[1:25:18] oh praise God
[1:25:20] hallelujah how many homeguins are there
[1:25:23] how many thirsty inside of here
[1:25:26] that's why he's sad when I passed to a
[1:25:28] minister make himself some kind of
[1:25:31] message Pope to the people where they
[1:25:32] look in the things
[1:25:36] and the people relax video because they
[1:25:38] depend upon the manual
[1:25:40] and they see the priests come and get
[1:25:42] them to live with her and they satisfied
[1:25:44] with that they're the best Church in the
[1:25:46] country because they have this priest
[1:25:48] let the priest dead and say what
[1:25:51] ah you better not have no priest you
[1:25:53] know they better have God
[1:25:56] because when the priest dead All Fall

[1:26:18] so
[1:26:20] they are treated their record in heaven
[1:26:22] the Father the word and the Holy Ghost
[1:26:24] and these three are one he said I am now
[1:26:27] with you but I'm going to be in you
[1:26:29] Hallelujah I have to go and when he gone
[1:26:32] when he died and they were sad and he
[1:26:34] had to rebuke them all fools and slow of
[1:26:36] heart he busted big on them because he

[1:26:40] shall expect this and they was dead in a
[1:26:42] slumped under depression he rebuked them
[1:26:45] and when he brings open the word to them

[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:21] is the atmosphere of anything
[1:32:24] you get along with his arguments you get
[1:32:26] into that type of admission if there's
[1:32:28] someone in a church someone is someone
[1:32:30] who is disobedient very ugly act in the
[1:32:32] church and causing trouble you will
[1:32:34] never be able to have a Revival as long
[1:32:37] as that kind of atmosphere is a wrong
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:41] to the troublemakers either get out of
[1:32:44] trouble
[1:32:45] or they get out
[1:32:46] [Music]

[1:33:18] maybe in case I don't like foreign
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:46] but they have seed inside of them
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:55] that kind of message this generation in
[1:33:57] the Book of Jesus Christ that will give
[1:33:58] legalistic real trouble
[1:34:03] they want to know Lord I have never I
[1:34:06] have never missed a service I always on
[1:34:07] time I do decide to do that I do that am
[1:34:09] I better than that man out there you see
[1:34:12] him Lord you know coming late
[1:34:17] I'm a man outside said remember me I'm
[1:34:19] not even worried about

[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:38] but God said David a man after my own
[1:34:40] heart

[1:35:01] asked for our King and God wasn't ready
[1:35:03] yet to release a king he said that one
[1:35:04] can give them King and that's how sure
[1:35:06] I'll get time off on them
[1:35:08] Oh Glory to God and men who got it
[1:35:11] ordain or raise them will get power from

[1:44:33] prayer
[1:44:34] that is still at the altar and with dear
[1:44:36] day and night and everything else and
[1:44:38] the house was constantly in prayer and
[1:44:41] humble trying to get people to come to
[1:44:42] God I'm making calls for the hospital
[1:44:44] you see this part about getting rid of
[1:44:45] the Lord
[1:44:46] it does something for your own testimony
[1:44:50] when you tell people with Christ and
[1:44:51] encourage them to come to service and
[1:44:52] call him to the Lord it does something
[1:44:54] to you it all envisions sick people and
[1:44:56] praying for them it opens the ball of
[1:44:58] compassion it puts you in a channel you
[1:45:00] see when you're all you're done doing it
[1:45:01] you're talking about you you're on your
[1:45:02] own you you are new

[1:49:29] confident of the God that he served he
[1:49:32] gave testimony of the god that living on
[1:49:33] the beer and the lion is able to
[1:49:35] Defenders Goliath because God had
[1:49:37] qualified him by the bay and the lion
[1:49:38] that deal with Goliath who is not my
[1:49:41] book so understanding is inspiration and
[1:49:44] experience on the backside of that God
[1:49:46] have to give him some backside is that
[1:49:47] experiences so all them cell phone signs

[1:50:16] anywhere anytime any place under any
[1:50:19] condition
[1:50:29] s
[1:50:32] that Jesus the reason he told the devil
[1:50:35] is written because you know that in this
[1:50:38] people have not we will have no gifts

[1:51:49] when a righteous man a good man gets
[1:51:52] into revealed travel God must hear an
[1:51:54] answer
[1:51:55] that's why the Bible didn't talk about

[1:53:01] are we are you enjoying the world
[1:53:03] all right let's drop a bomb on you now
[1:53:05] we know that this is the day of
[1:53:06] salvation where God is calling men from
[1:53:09] a world of sin into a life of service
[1:53:14] Center service
[1:53:20] not self-righteous men from sin to
[1:53:22] sinners
[1:53:24] from adulterior to service from foreign
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:38] that's the object of taking you to bring
[1:53:42] you into service his service
[1:53:45] [Applause]
[1:53:48] and in the prayer that God has part of
[1:53:50] the spirit of my eye great signs and
[1:53:53] wonders out to accompany the ministry
[1:53:55] for this day
[1:53:57] former and later women are falling
[1:53:59] together we know they're supposed to be
[1:54:01] good silence and wonders
[1:54:07] but the Bible said we can overcome the
[1:54:08] world
[1:54:10] let me say it again because I get 10
[1:54:12] cleaning on that
[1:54:14] are you fighting for them emails not for
[1:54:16] me
[1:54:16] because I know when you anchor them
[1:54:18] emails and says so be it they start to
[1:54:19] do something for you
[1:54:20] so this is the truth because God said so
[1:54:32] that overcomes the world
[1:54:34] Hallelujah and when Daniel was taken to
[1:54:37] Babylon though he was going away from
[1:54:38] his home he was going to have to be a
[1:54:40] slave to another nation of people but
[1:54:42] Daniel papers in his heart no matter
[1:54:44] what it is to him he wasn't going to
[1:54:45] defile himself with the Babylonian sin
[1:54:47] oh if we had more Gallant men like that
[1:54:50] that would purpose in your heart if I'm
[1:54:52] a Christian I'm going to find out every
[1:54:54] divine blessing that belongs to me I'm
[1:54:56] killing it
[1:54:59] I want to read that again if I'm a
[1:55:03] Christian I will find out
[1:55:05] every divine blessing that belongs to me
[1:55:09] and claim it
[1:55:12] so now you're talking about it as mines
[1:55:16] not them and that church no it is mines
[1:55:19] I claim it so you come here to make
[1:55:22] claims you come here to get the promises
[1:55:24] preached so people said by these
[1:55:26] promises because only when you've heard
[1:55:27] a promise you can make a claim you don't
[1:55:29] know what God promised you it's God take
[1:55:31] a prophet to reveal the sins to bring
[1:55:33] all the promises for you
[1:55:34] [Applause]
[1:55:42] [Applause]

[2:07:07] like a conqueror you know your conqueror
[2:07:09] faith is the victory that could not
[2:07:11] conquer this world

[2:08:28] is a revelation of the way of God oh
[2:08:31] Hallelujah so it's not ready it's not
[2:08:34] right to you an experience but in the
[2:08:37] spirit you have a revelation
[2:08:38] so Abraham didn't experience Isaiah the
[2:08:41] revelation of Isaac is that didn't come
[2:08:43] yet it took 25 years to see the fruit of
[2:08:46] that faith it took 25 years for Isaac to
[2:08:49] materialize but he had a fate he had a
[2:08:52] revelation
[2:08:53] he has something in his soul you don't
[2:08:56] have the experience of Isaac yet but
[2:08:57] inside the spirit is finished because
[2:09:01] God said so and that's the truth and
[2:09:04] then God said it is the truth to always
[2:09:06] can't lie it's got to come to pass Oh

[2:15:47] some as well
[2:15:49] enjoy myself and pour it out
[2:15:54] in Eden God is the Perfection of
[2:15:57] perfection
[2:15:58] he knew all things before there ever was
[2:16:01] and therefore the infinite God could
[2:16:02] have looked forward and see the end from
[2:16:05] the beginning and he knew that he would
[2:16:07] have children on this Earth
[2:16:10] because you are a father a parent watch
[2:16:13] and tonight and the children does
[2:16:15] helpless through fellows who can't take
[2:16:17] care of themselves don't you struggle
[2:16:18] and work and do everything else to
[2:16:20] provide for your children
[2:16:21] because you are father or parent I will
[2:16:23] say the trueness and the thought of the
[2:16:25] empty parent and Parenthood originated
[2:16:28] in God because he was the first parent
[2:16:31] don't you think the god seen that Satan
[2:16:34] would be and what Satan would do he give
[2:16:36] to his children and provide it for them
[2:16:38] the best thing that could be validated
[2:16:40] for them knowing the enemy attack would
[2:16:42] be God fortified his children
[2:16:45] all right so you know whatever was
[2:16:47] coming and God in the beginning and gave
[2:16:49] his children the atomic weapon because
[2:16:51] he infinite God
[2:16:52] seeing there was going to be a conflict
[2:16:54] and it was going to be a battlefield God
[2:16:56] equipped his children with the right
[2:16:58] kind of ammunition the right kind of
[2:17:00] attack the right kind of everything they
[2:17:01] need of would treat him all the way from
[2:17:03] Eden to the Rapture what was it the word
[2:17:09] but people don't believe that
[2:17:12] and the first job the devil came and
[2:17:14] said that word you know that time will
[2:17:16] be working
[2:17:17] and Jesus on Earth just to prove this
[2:17:20] was the best equipment
[2:17:22] when Satan come in a hand-to-hand come
[2:17:24] back to Jesus
[2:17:25] he never reached over and his power and
[2:17:28] tied his hands he just took the same
[2:17:30] weapon that God given the Garden in his
[2:17:33] word and said it's written it is written
[2:17:35] and he punched him right out of the ring
[2:17:39] he points Satan out of the ring because
[2:17:42] it was God's past it is written it is
[2:17:46] written so when when the devil told evil
[2:17:49] you shall not surely die he should have
[2:17:51] said You shall surely die
[2:17:53] because God said so and that's the truth
[2:17:56] and all also the story changed different
[2:17:58] or no
[2:18:00] Satan had to go and take a walk and say
[2:18:03] oh God that man that woman talking just
[2:18:04] like your husband
[2:18:06] she's very born to be born and pleasure
[2:18:09] because

[2:18:38] different
[2:18:39] he said it is the street because God
[2:18:41] said so will come in your interpretation
[2:18:44] no come with your idea you'll see me

[2:29:27] param says that um
[2:29:29] someone asked a question who is this
[2:29:31] great Jehovah where did he begin he had
[2:29:33] no beginning he'll favor God
[2:29:35] and Eternity is one complete sickler has
[2:29:37] no end
[2:29:38] no there's a real true Spirit of love
[2:29:42] there's a real true Spirit of loyalty
[2:29:44] there's a very true Spirit of honesty
[2:29:46] and and and but that is God
[2:29:49] the very Fountain he said let us close
[2:29:52] our eyes to all imaginations for a few
[2:29:54] moments and go back before there was
[2:29:56] anything the great function of all
[2:29:58] eternity was that Spirit of love joy
[2:30:01] Spirit of honesty spirit of trueness in
[2:30:04] disperfection then out of the existence
[2:30:06] of the father when the logos which was
[2:30:09] the son which was a theophany which was
[2:30:12] the body of the great Jehovah God when
[2:30:15] fought in a Celestial body that's the
[2:30:17] logos the word spoke out of them great
[2:30:20] Fountains of life and there the
[2:30:23] theophany which was God made into word
[2:30:26] then that he offer me was made flesh in
[2:30:29] the person of Christ Jesus then all the
[2:30:31] fullness of the trinity dwelt in Him
[2:30:33] Father Son holy spirit all that and
[2:30:36] that's the very way we go Plumb back to
[2:30:38] the original beginning of God
[2:30:40] dear we are born again not of Flesh born
[2:30:44] again not of blood but Born Again by the
[2:30:47] spirit and in that eternal spirit of
[2:30:50] love and honesty comes down to make its
[2:30:53] place in us then when we die from this
[2:30:56] life we go into the body which is every
[2:30:59] time that we deserve we have a team
[2:31:00] orphany into one a Celestial body
[2:31:03] then at the coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:31:04] this body is picked up from the Earth
[2:31:06] again and made into a glorified state to
[2:31:09] live in his presence forever then all
[2:31:11] provision all the things that was in
[2:31:13] provision goes out of existence flesh
[2:31:16] goes into punishment hell open up a
[2:31:18] mountain swallows it all the evil and
[2:31:19] provision and God and his beloved Church
[2:31:22] his bride takes their stand for the
[2:31:25] eternities to roll on
[2:31:27] there is the great hope of the Christian
[2:31:29] Church David said oh thy loving kindness
[2:31:31] is better than life no life everybody
[2:31:34] wants to think of life life the way life
[2:31:36] has appropriated expected it because
[2:31:39] that even life itself have a privated
[2:31:41] aspect many times people refer to life
[2:31:43] as having a big time drinking and going
[2:31:45] out this is life
[2:31:47] and the other day just this weekend four
[2:31:48] people died
[2:31:50] a crash and then the thing fell on them
[2:31:52] and put up the car
[2:31:53] and I was wondering first thing when I
[2:31:55] heard the news I say I wonder what time
[2:31:57] it was and where they're coming from
[2:31:59] when I looked they were coming with some
[2:32:00] fat or some kind of party whatever it is
[2:32:02] young people what a way to go
[2:32:05] no time to repent
[2:32:06] I wonder if they got time to repent
[2:32:08] oh and they've got time to make things
[2:32:10] right
[2:32:11] they shall be in church
[2:32:13] there shall be not serious
[2:32:15] see
[2:32:17] oh my so look at him
[2:32:19] this man that came to Abraham and
[2:32:22] vanished in his sight great patriarch
[2:32:24] Abraham thought face to face with God
[2:32:27] the same God get it not three people
[2:32:30] in the beginning was the same he was the
[2:32:32] great spirit I want to wrap up fountain
[2:32:34] with all trueness everything that was
[2:32:37] pure was in this Fountain and it became
[2:32:39] to form into a body
[2:32:42] the kind of body that we go to not a
[2:32:45] glorified body but an Angelic body that
[2:32:48] has shape and form
[2:32:50] and every time I see a tree the tree is
[2:32:52] the negative there's a positive
[2:32:53] somewhere
[2:32:55] or if I see a man listen
[2:32:57] I see a lovely Little Couple man and his
[2:32:59] wife music please walking down the
[2:33:02] street sweethearts together what does it
[2:33:04] reflect
[2:33:05] there is one in heaven that will never
[2:33:07] perish
[2:33:11] foreign Hallelujah
[2:33:14] let's continue
[2:33:16] this way of light that went forth was a
[2:33:18] way of love that's the main one
[2:33:20] the next color was blue and blue is
[2:33:21] trueness next was other colors to the
[2:33:24] seven perfect colors which is seven
[2:33:26] spirits of God that went from that great
[2:33:28] fountain that great Fountain and Diamond
[2:33:30] Jesus spoke about
[2:33:33] had become into a theophany
[2:33:35] Hallelujah
[2:33:37] so the fake function of Love projectile
[2:33:40] rainbow the rainbow becomes that he
[2:33:41] offered me and made it the image of a
[2:33:43] man he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh
[2:33:46] he was a theophany
[2:33:47] and Moses said I would like to see you
[2:33:49] and God hid him in the Rock and when he
[2:33:53] passed by Moses said it looked like the
[2:33:54] back part of a man
[2:33:56] that will come to pass and one day when
[2:33:59] Abraham was sitting in his tent
[2:34:01] God came to him in a body of Flesh
[2:34:03] will you find him here meet an Abraham
[2:34:05] before that in the order of Melchizedek
[2:34:08] a body of Flesh which was God
[2:34:11] he was God In the Flesh then brother
[2:34:13] Branham why would he have to come back
[2:34:15] and be born
[2:34:16] he wasn't born then he was just created
[2:34:20] a body that he dwelled in Melchizedek
[2:34:23] the king of Salem which is the king of
[2:34:25] Jerusalem which is the king of peace
[2:34:28] or end of life Jesus had good father and
[2:34:31] mother begin with days and end of life
[2:34:33] but he was made after the order of
[2:34:34] Manchester
[2:34:36] himself
[2:34:38] was Jehovah God the same one that met
[2:34:41] Abraham years later let's see why the
[2:34:42] Civil love walked up with Abraham
[2:34:45] and he says Abraham I'll tell you what
[2:34:48] I'm on my way to do we'll pick it up
[2:34:49] tonight don't you and Sarah and all what
[2:34:52] he's gonna do
[2:34:53] and as soon as he blessed Abraham he
[2:34:55] went back into space again
[2:34:57] a man that stood there had dust on his
[2:34:59] clothes a man not only that but he eat
[2:35:01] the Flesh of a calf that Abraham killed
[2:35:03] drink the milk from the cow eat some
[2:35:05] cakes and butt on it and turn talking to
[2:35:09] theophany again
[2:35:10] what was it why do we take a damn he had
[2:35:13] never been born like you and I but he
[2:35:16] had to be born in the flesh so he could
[2:35:18] throw that
[2:35:21] you're casting anything
[2:35:24] so the word became flesh
[2:35:27] to deal with Mr dead
[2:35:30] so when Jesus take that he free us from
[2:35:34] that
[2:35:36] so Paul could come after said that where
[2:35:37] is this thing because Jesus Took the
[2:35:40] sting out the debt
[2:35:42] whom we have believed
[2:35:48] he had me born a freshly could hold a
[2:35:49] stinger that was a created body that was
[2:35:52] a body just pulled the cash calcium and
[2:35:53] potassium to the Earth and that's the
[2:35:55] same thing melchester was he stepped
[2:35:57] into him in her body and walked from
