[4:37] training
[4:39] and the Battlefront is now set getting
[4:43] ready

[7:16] started in heaven and it's cast to the
[7:19] earth and the Battle of angels had
[7:20] become the Battle of men and to think
[7:22] that across the world there are people

[7:28] to help Empower and strengthen and
[7:31] Inspire this bride of Jesus Christ

[7:43] for granted as if everything couldn't
[7:45] just work out and yet go tell Joshua
[7:47] every place you put your foot is yours

[7:52] to have great courage and that's why God
[7:53] say be strong and be very courageous
[7:56] there's need for people to step out now
[7:58] if there ever was a time or hour for
[8:01] sons of God to step forward is now step
[8:03] out with feet not Step Up based upon the
[8:06] past but step of peace upon the future

[42:52] sure he was a man that was influenced by
[42:55] the Holy Spirit he was a man that had
[42:58] surrendered his life to his word and his
[43:02] life spoke louder than words it was a
[43:05] life lift for the true Gospel of Jesus
[43:08] Christ and it became a light for many
[43:11] people a light here a little light here
[43:13] a little light here but it became a
[43:16] light because it was a life that was
[43:18] lived according to the word and this
[43:21] life that was lived according to the
[43:23] word became a light and we could see a
[43:25] light in our church church and we were

[43:47] truly appreciate it amen praise the Lord
[43:50] so today we are standing with my brother
[43:52] Johnny and the brethren in the church
[43:54] amen and we are focusing on the promise
[43:57] of God like Elisha did to the promise
[44:00] that Elijah has given him for a double
[44:03] portion for a double victory for this
[44:06] battle that we're gonna go out
[44:08] Victorious and we are focused and stay
[44:11] in line with that promise
[44:14] amen amen praise the Lord so the
[44:18] inspiration of the convention
[44:20] amen is preparing for the battle and
[44:23] there's many battle going on praise the
[44:25] Lord but there's one battle it's a
[44:27] battle between the darkness and the
[44:28] light that's that great battle that is
[44:31] going on now before the beginning we
[44:34] read in first John 1 5 this then is the
[44:37] message which we have heard of him and
[44:39] declare unto you that God is light and
[44:41] in him is no Darkness at all so in God
[44:45] there's no battle in God there is peace
[44:48] in God there's all victory in God there
[44:51] is no fear in God there is no enemy in
[44:55] God it's all over in God full
[44:58] satisfaction in God Perfection
[45:00] hallelujah praise the Lord and we are
[45:02] returning back to God we are coming from
[45:05] God and we are returning back to God
[45:07] hallelujah praise the Lord praise the
[45:10] Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[45:13] amen and we go to the beginning and in
[45:16] Genesis 1 3 God said let there be light
[45:19] and there was life tired now a creation
[45:21] of light is coming forth and God saw
[45:24] that the light was good and God divided
[45:27] the light from the darkness so what
[45:29] happened at the beginning God made a law
[45:32] and to know this law is so important the
[45:35] law says Darkness cannot stay together
[45:37] with light there has to be a separation
[45:40] amen they cannot stay together it's a
[45:43] law of God so this law of God is still
[45:47] working and it's still in progress
[45:49] praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah and
[45:54] brother praying I mean a message
[45:55] question an answer on Hebrews chapter 3
[45:57] says Darkness and Light cannot dwell
[45:59] together which is the most powerful
[46:02] brother brand name is asking the
[46:03] question what is more powerful the power
[46:06] of light or the power of darkness and he
[46:09] said it's the power it's the light and
[46:11] when the light shines forth the darkness
[46:14] has to flee Hallelujah in your life when
[46:19] the light shines forth in your life then
[46:23] the darkness it has to flee it's a law
[46:26] of Separation it's a law and Satan
[46:30] cannot interrupt that law it's a law of
[46:33] the king and when we yield ourselves to
[46:35] that light and say Shine On Me Lord
[46:38] Jesus Shine On Me father that light is
[46:41] gonna go in progress and darkness has to
[46:44] flee hallelujah praise the Lord I know
[46:48] the spirit of God is here I know he's
[46:49] movie where the spirit of God there is
[46:52] Liberty
[46:53] hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise
[46:57] the Lord my God has decided he has made
[47:00] a decision and he chose you and Peter
[47:04] picks it up and he said he has called
[47:06] you out of Darkness
[47:08] into His Marvelous Light
[47:10] and when he has called you into this
[47:12] Marvelous Light they know Darkness can
[47:15] be there no Darkness can stay where
[47:17] light is
[47:19] hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen and
[47:24] Paul writes to the Romans the night is
[47:27] far spend and the day is at hand let us
[47:31] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[47:33] and let us put on the armor of light so
[47:37] God has given you a armor of light he
[47:41] has given you something to fight the
[47:43] darkness and he said Put it on put the
[47:46] armor of light on put an armor of Life
[47:48] on what is the armor of life it's a
[47:52] portion of that same great life it's a
[47:55] portion of that same great light
[47:58] hallelujah hallelujah and David picks it
[48:01] up in Psalm and he says for thou Wilt
[48:04] light my candle Lord Jesus you have
[48:08] given me the ability you have made me a
[48:10] candle baby it's not lit long maybe it's
[48:13] not lit strong but Lord let it stronger
[48:16] make it stronger put more fire on my
[48:19] candle let me light let my life Shine
[48:22] the gospel of this day Let It Shine Lord
[48:26] Jesus and you watch the darkness fleeing
[48:29] the darkness has to flee because God has
[48:32] set a law that Darkness cannot stay with
[48:35] slide
[48:36] amen amen amen hallelujah praise the
[48:40] Lord
[48:41] praise the Lord where's the great Light
[48:44] breaking force and brother Branham he
[48:47] picks it up in the denominatory Physical
[48:49] Realm he says the great light is
[48:52] breaking forth from the kingdom of God
[48:56] where's the kingdom of God brother and
[48:59] sister where's the kingdom of God the
[49:02] kingdom of God is within you Hallelujah
[49:05] and that's the place that the great
[49:08] light is breaking forth in your life
[49:11] around you in your family the great
[49:14] light is breaking for us
[49:17] how will it break for us we want the
[49:19] victory we want overcoming we want to
[49:23] see a resurrection we want to see a
[49:26] Rapture that's all talking about
[49:28] victories we want to see adoption that's
[49:31] a victory we want to see a life we want
[49:33] to see a Perfection that's a victory and
[49:36] we're gonna see the victory praise the
[49:39] Lord how it's gonna break it for us how
[49:42] is it going to break it for us and
[49:44] brother Branham says in there is a man
[49:45] that can turn on the light he said God
[49:48] separated Darkness from light all light
[49:50] from darkness and he separates death
[49:52] from life and he does it by his word
[49:56] hallelujah so simple if you have a
[50:00] question if there's Shady places in your
[50:02] life is there some Darkness around and
[50:05] you cannot get over it praise the Lord
[50:07] you go to the word because in the word
[50:09] it separates the light from the darkness
[50:14] Hallelujah that's the key it's his word
[50:18] amen and brother praying himself life
[50:20] comes only by the word of God made
[50:23] manifest so he says the life he said it
[50:27] comes when that word he said that word
[50:29] is dead it's written letters but it's
[50:32] it's dead but there's spirit and there's
[50:34] life in this word amen and when we take
[50:37] the word and we get it in the right
[50:40] channel then this word starts to become
[50:43] alive it starts to become a
[50:44] manifestation and then this word is
[50:47] becoming a light in your life
[50:49] hallelujah praise the Lord so we believe
[50:53] every word
[50:55] and as we believe
[50:57] it gets a Harmony
[50:59] the rain is coming down the rain is
[51:02] falling the rain is falling on the word
[51:05] it always follows the word and you start
[51:08] to believing and says thank you Lord
[51:10] Jesus thank you for the word you start
[51:13] to understand this word speaks about you
[51:15] this word speaks about the decision God
[51:18] has made for your life and a face is
[51:20] created and it starts to get in progress
[51:23] and it becomes alive and that life is
[51:28] the light and that light will cause the
[51:31] darkness to separate and to flee
[51:33] Hallelujah the darkness has to flee
[51:36] praise the Lord
[51:38] praise the Lord I'm coming to let me
[51:40] come to an end amen what does the word
[51:43] say about you today what does it say get
[51:47] your face connected with it
[51:49] first Thessalonians 5 5 Paul says you
[51:54] are the children of light
[51:58] you came in this world speaking lies
[52:03] shaped in econiquity speaking lies
[52:06] making sin brother but it looked all
[52:11] dark it looked all dark and Satan saw it
[52:14] all dark but one day the light of the
[52:17] Gospel it struck your seed and that
[52:20] little candle started to get light that
[52:23] candle started to burn and at that
[52:26] moment the battle was going on it was a
[52:29] battle because of a candle that was lit
[52:32] and Satan who wants to keep the darkness
[52:34] but praise be to God that light that is
[52:37] burning and this light is gonna build
[52:40] more and more and it's getting stronger
[52:42] and stronger and stronger because why
[52:45] the Bible says the word says ye are the
[52:48] children of light if you are the
[52:50] children of Light No Doubt Darkness has
[52:53] to go because you are the children of
[52:56] the light hallelujah praise the Lord and
[52:59] the Bible makes it not more clear we are
[53:01] not of denied and we are not of the
[53:04] darkness this puts all fear away this
[53:06] puts all doubt away this puts our Focus

[53:14] you have called me to be a child of the
[53:16] lion amen praise the Lord the greatest
[53:19] battle between Darkness and Light a
[53:24] separation has been done at the
[53:26] beginning
[53:27] and Satan tried to mingle it up
[53:31] brother Branham says he says Satan tries
[53:34] to pervert
[53:35] he's tried to deform the word he's tried
[53:38] to deform the life to death he's tried
[53:41] to deform Health to sickness he's tried
[53:44] to deform it all but we are coming back

[1:02:47] moment

[1:03:01] Junior amen may God bless our
[1:03:03] translators very much today
[1:03:05] and we want to start with these
[1:03:08] scriptures
[1:03:10] keep thy heart says Proverbs 24 23 sorry
[1:03:15] 2 4 23
[1:03:18] keep thy heart with all diligence watch
[1:03:22] out what goes on here
[1:03:25] for out of it are the issues of life
[1:03:35] amen so be careful with this heart
[1:03:41] be careful what you let in
[1:03:44] and be careful what you don't let in
[1:03:48] because it's like a womb
[1:03:51] and you've got to be careful and watch
[1:03:54] that heart with all diligence
[1:03:58] Matthew 16 18.
[1:04:01] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[1:04:05] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:04:09] church and the gates of hell
[1:04:12] shall not Prevail against it
[1:04:15] Hallelujah
[1:04:24] amen Romans 10 10.
[1:04:28] for with the heart man believeth
[1:04:32] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:04:36] confession is made unto salvation
[1:04:45] a Man 2 Corinthians 10 3.
[1:04:51] for though we walk in the flesh
[1:04:54] we do not war after the flesh
[1:05:03] Ephesians 6 12 finally
[1:05:08] for we rest so not against flesh and
[1:05:12] blood but against
[1:05:14] principalities against powers
[1:05:19] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:05:23] this world and against spiritual
[1:05:26] wickedness in high places
[1:05:42] in a word of prayer
[1:05:44] dear God we want to thank you for this
[1:05:47] hour
[1:05:49] we are living in a strange time
[1:05:53] Lord we look to the left
[1:05:56] and we are horrified
[1:05:58] we look to the right
[1:06:00] and Lord we are amazed Lord we realize
[1:06:05] it's time to go home
[1:06:07] new things are being revealed
[1:06:11] help us Lord to realize
[1:06:14] that you sent a prophet
[1:06:16] that we could hear these new things
[1:06:19] he said the Bible will become like a new
[1:06:22] book
[1:06:23] how we thank you for these things Lord
[1:06:26] Lord may you people be blessed

[1:07:35] feels it

[1:09:39] of uh martial arts
[1:09:42] when they strike somebody
[1:09:45] they don't do it quietly
[1:09:47] they scream with everything
[1:09:51] and there's a reason for that
[1:09:53] it's called a Kia
[1:09:55] and it has there's many reasons they do
[1:09:57] that
[1:09:58] but the main one
[1:10:00] to confuse the enemy
[1:10:02] to discourage the enemy
[1:10:05] he not only gets a fist
[1:10:07] on his nose but he said what's going on
[1:10:12] because you're screaming

[1:13:55] something
[1:13:56] amen you know Israel
[1:13:59] started out
[1:14:00] they charged out of Egypt
[1:14:04] bye-bye pharaoh
[1:14:06] they charged over the Red Sea
[1:14:10] and I played uh what a tambourine
[1:14:15] Miriam prayed the tambourine
[1:14:18] but now Israel started
[1:14:22] and I could say the same thing
[1:14:25] 2 million
[1:14:26] charged out of Egypt
[1:14:29] but it ended up with two men
[1:14:34] okay let's talk about it
[1:14:36] it was not in their heart
[1:14:39] it was just an emotion
[1:14:42] enthusiasm which is fine but it must be
[1:14:46] in your heart
[1:14:48] so when you charge it must be real
[1:14:50] there's no impersonation to the third
[1:14:53] floor
[1:14:55] two million
[1:14:56] and the two men
[1:14:58] two men
[1:15:00] they they saw the works
[1:15:03] they saw the manifestation
[1:15:05] of the spirit
[1:15:07] Mighty miracles
[1:15:09] done in Egypt
[1:15:10] but it wasn't in their hearts
[1:15:13] you bet you better guard your heart
[1:15:17] because out of it are the issues of life
[1:15:21] be real
[1:15:22] be truthful be transparent if you have
[1:15:26] to say stories say sorry
[1:15:28] if you have to say hallelujah say
[1:15:30] hallelujah
[1:15:31] hey man if you have to say I forgive you
[1:15:34] mean it I forgive you
[1:15:37] come from here
[1:15:38] he said but two men
[1:15:41] it wasn't in their heart
[1:15:43] they didn't overcome
[1:15:46] their battle
[1:15:47] they just came out
[1:15:50] but Redemption is in two parts
[1:15:53] out of in two
[1:15:55] but they just come out
[1:15:58] and Jesus said they perished in the
[1:16:02] wilderness and are eternally dead
[1:16:06] when you charge out of Egypt make sure
[1:16:10] you charge into the Promised Land
[1:16:12] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:15] you can start out make sure it's here
[1:16:18] make sure it's real
[1:16:20] you've got something to make right make
[1:16:21] it right
[1:16:23] and you can't be going by hope
[1:16:26] well we we're hoping
[1:16:29] to make the Promised Land
[1:16:32] God hope for the promised
[1:16:34] amen now Faith is Bully
[1:16:38] strong
[1:16:40] aggressive powerful
[1:16:43] how I like to think
[1:16:45] faith hope faith charity these three
[1:16:50] things
[1:16:51] what a beautiful thing hope is
[1:16:55] a little timid hope
[1:16:58] lovely and sweet
[1:17:01] but for this battle
[1:17:03] she's the greatest enemy
[1:17:06] whoa she's the greatest enemy
[1:17:09] that faith has
[1:17:11] that's right the greatest enemy
[1:17:14] that faith has got is Hope
[1:17:18] the hour of charge is here
[1:17:20] hey man brother when you believe
[1:17:24] charge
[1:17:26] you might be standing in your In Your
[1:17:28] House like Father Gerard said
[1:17:30] charge
[1:17:32] Satan get out of our house
[1:17:34] leave my shooting alone charge
[1:17:38] praise be to God something happens
[1:17:42] it's a it's radical
[1:17:45] charge you're not thinking
[1:17:47] you're running
[1:17:49] you're running at the enemy David
[1:17:51] charged that Goliath
[1:17:55] right through the Bible
[1:17:57] hey man the woman charged for Elijah
[1:18:01] it's all well all is well
[1:18:06] all is well
[1:18:09] all is well she was charging
[1:18:13] you God Amen you can't pretend to charge
[1:18:17] something takes over and you're charged
[1:18:20] it might happen to you when you get home
[1:18:23] it might happen tomorrow morning when
[1:18:25] you feel the charge charge
[1:18:28] but don't go in Hope
[1:18:30] well we hope to make it look Hope has
[1:18:33] its place
[1:18:34] but faith does not eat that need that
[1:18:37] enemy
[1:18:38] faith claims it now
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] faith says
[1:18:45] God said so and it's mine
[1:18:50] that settles it
[1:18:52] that's it
[1:18:53] that's it
[1:18:55] hey man that settled it I don't care if
[1:18:59] I'm still crippled
[1:19:01] I don't care if I'm still blind
[1:19:04] or if I'm still sick
[1:19:06] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:19:10] I believe it anyhow
[1:19:13] charge
[1:19:15] it's mine right now
[1:19:17] God said so
[1:19:19] that settles it
[1:19:21] that is faith
[1:19:23] can you see why hope is the enemy
[1:19:26] Faith doesn't hope it knows
[1:19:30] faith is the substance
[1:19:32] of things hopeful the evidence of Things
[1:19:35] Not Seen glory and with the heart man
[1:19:39] believes
[1:19:40] with the mouth confession is made
[1:19:43] that is faith praise be to God now when
[1:19:46] it comes to reality
[1:19:48] reality check
[1:19:50] your mind
[1:19:52] opens it up
[1:19:55] watch what goes on here
[1:19:57] because your mind is a womb
[1:20:00] don't just say well it doesn't matter it
[1:20:03] does matter
[1:20:04] some things you have to say no
[1:20:08] guard your heart some things you have to
[1:20:11] say yes
[1:20:13] yes or yes be yes
[1:20:15] and you'll know be no

[1:20:42] in other words that is the battle
[1:20:46] that is your what you let in
[1:20:49] because what you let in
[1:20:51] will become
[1:20:53] you know when when the serpent faced Eve
[1:20:56] he didn't attack Eve
[1:20:58] the first thing he attacked
[1:21:00] it was the word
[1:21:02] that's God
[1:21:04] that's his first attack
[1:21:07] it's got to discredit that

[1:21:40] and try Satan is trying to make you
[1:21:42] accept
[1:21:44] the wrong thing
[1:21:45] as Eve did more on that just now God
[1:21:49] let none of them miss it
[1:21:53] see it's your mind
[1:21:56] that opens up the door

[1:22:16] my God you better destroy your enemy
[1:22:20] praise be to God it either accept or not
[1:22:23] because in the Garden of Eden let's take
[1:22:27] it a bit deeper
[1:22:28] when you
[1:22:30] you knowing better
[1:22:32] by the word of God
[1:22:34] watch a very big words here
[1:22:37] by the Intercourse of the Mind
[1:22:43] very big words
[1:22:45] you take in
[1:22:47] a lie
[1:22:49] of the devil
[1:22:51] against the word of God
[1:22:54] that
[1:22:55] exactly what evening
[1:22:58] and with a spiritual
[1:23:01] intercourse
[1:23:03] our first that came by believing
[1:23:09] Satan's lie
[1:23:12] into the womb
[1:23:14] of her mind
[1:23:16] nothing physical
[1:23:17] not physical it was a spiritual her her
[1:23:23] spiritual virginity
[1:23:26] what's broken
[1:23:28] or her spiritual virtues
[1:23:31] was broken
[1:23:33] and the womb of her mind
[1:23:37] received a lie
[1:23:39] from The Serpent and he was very polite
[1:23:43] very courteous
[1:23:45] nice guy
[1:23:47] we better understand how Satan operates
[1:23:50] hey man it's not like like the cartoons
[1:23:54] okay he's a reality
[1:23:57] okay with a with a spiritual intercourse
[1:24:01] that come by believing Satan life
[1:24:05] into the womb of her mind
[1:24:08] okay that polluted her soul
[1:24:12] because this is the gateway to the soul
[1:24:17] watch it
[1:24:18] okay the gateway to the soul
[1:24:22] it set death
[1:24:25] in the soul
[1:24:27] so the the spiritual uh adultery
[1:24:32] took place
[1:24:34] spiritual virtue
[1:24:36] was broken
[1:24:38] and a spiritual mind
[1:24:40] received the seed
[1:24:42] then the natural Act
[1:24:46] s took place
[1:24:49] and the natural world
[1:24:52] and the natural virginity that all
[1:24:54] followed
[1:24:55] amen but the battle started here
[1:24:59] that is the chosen place
[1:25:01] be careful what you think

[1:25:06] give us the word Say Amen
[1:25:09] if it's reasoning say no
[1:25:11] I reject that
[1:25:13] amen then the natural Act
[1:25:17] but watch what happened it was a
[1:25:20] spiritual what uh yeah spiritual
[1:25:22] intercourse first
[1:25:24] now this great contest
[1:25:28] has been going on for many years
[1:25:31] I need it is a poor
[1:25:33] Satan is trying young people to pull you
[1:25:37] into his prior
[1:25:40] and it's been going on for many years
[1:25:42] in fact it started in heaven
[1:25:48] Satan was kicked out
[1:25:51] but up there he had a contest
[1:25:54] and he pulled a certain percentage
[1:25:57] of the Angels
[1:25:58] with his uh tail
[1:26:01] with his life
[1:26:03] he was kicked out
[1:26:05] get out
[1:26:07] then he became an enemy
[1:26:10] to God's people
[1:26:12] down here
[1:26:13] says and since then
[1:26:15] he's used all his strengths
[1:26:18] and his strategy
[1:26:20] to pull God's people
[1:26:22] across the fires
[1:26:24] or into his fire
[1:26:26] using his tail
[1:26:29] his story
[1:26:31] to get you pulled
[1:26:34] but thank God

[1:26:39] Hallelujah he is our strength the Lord
[1:26:42] is my strength
[1:26:44] and you may get me but you won't get God
[1:26:46] in Me amen
[1:26:48] praise be to God young people be careful
[1:26:52] the prophet gave a story
[1:26:54] of a certain snake

[1:27:04] [Music]
[1:27:05] amen the snake had a power
[1:27:08] over that bird
[1:27:10] and the only way the bird was mesmerized
[1:27:17] it was hypnotized
[1:27:19] by the eyes
[1:27:22] of the snake the only way to escape
[1:27:25] was to break
[1:27:27] the contact and to look away look away

[1:45:28] has reasoning
[1:45:31] faith
[1:45:33] has no reason
[1:45:40] my that's probably
[1:45:42] powerful

[1:46:07] faith has no reasoning
[1:46:09] you've got to watch for a reason
[1:46:12] is so easy
[1:46:16] you've got to say no
[1:46:18] and to say yes to Faith I believe that
