morning we thank you for your presence lord we thank you for the anointing lord we thank you for the power that we feel in our midst lord come have the preeminences lord have the oversight in jesus name before we pray i just want to give a little praise here uh i got a uh recording on the phone church phone for my sister who i prayed we prayed for a couple of months back from new york i don't i i maybe i don't really personally and i know her maybe i if i see her picture i would recognize her sister wendy she had heart failure about two years ago and she was could hardly walk and move around and something like that but she she called to say she have no words she she connects to the services she saw the convention and she gave testimony by the power of god coming into her house into her room but to kind of give her something of it she says that her heart is back up to 98 she says she could run she could jump she could walk she don't have enough words to give god praises and thanks for what god has done for her so we rejoice with her and pray god blessing upon her so i just wanted to share it with you as we bow heads and if you have a request and you want to make it known before the lord god could hear on your behalf and bring a great mighty deliverance heavenly father we thank you for your divine love and presence we thank you for this testimony for our sister of the new york who have been receiving the word and and the presence of god could come upon her lord and give her such a touch that over time she see a miracle of god and the doctor told her whatever she's doing continue doing it but we know it's a virtue of christ ministering to her father and we thank you lord and we pray every hand here that was raised everyone needs a special touch from you that you will touch them this morning even those connected life father may you minister to them sweep into their homes i may heal and be released deliverance be released a mighty touch of your spirit be released in the name of jesus we ask it and father as we approach your word this morning may be with us lord and bless us i pray in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you thanks for coming or all other things considering services and so on you know the changes that are going to be have will be addressed by the assistant pastor after service but this time we want to go into the word matthew chapter 16 we want to read from verse 13 to 19. luke chapter 17 we want to read from verse 26 to 37 revelation 10 we want to read from verse 8 to 11 for scripture reading i'm so excited to be here this morning it's a blessing to be here blessed to be in god's presence thanks again for coming out we know that go into another cycle again and we just have to live with that okay matthew chapter 16 reading from verse 13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that what john the baptist some elias others jeremiah's one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that i am simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are those i remember jonah for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is heaven and i say unto thee the dow had peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind an earth shall be born in heaven whatsoever shall loosen earth shall be loosed in heaven luke chapter 17 reading from verse 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat the drunk they married wives they were given marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought the soul they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of salam it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he that shall be on the whole step he's tough in the house let him not come down to take it away he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed one shall be taken the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other left and the answer and said to him well lord you said unto them wheresoever the body is theatre will the eagles be gathered together the last scripture from revelation chapter 10 reading from verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standed upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth sweet sweetest honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me dog must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings let's pray again father we thank you for this holy writ your word and any man could turn the bible and read scriptures but it take the holy spirit the revealer of the divine revelation revelation of god to the people to reveal it so may you come and reveal your word reveal the scriptures and pour out your spirit send a witness to the people's heart change their lives change your work and talk actions and attitudes granted lord and jesus we ask it amen you may be seated god bless you thanks again for coming out hallelujah your sacrifice coming out this morning will not be in vain it's good to be here it's always good to be in the presence of god in the house of god among god's people and on wednesday night uh we had a special time on wednesday night uh the true believers they're gonna follow the life that's what the true believer is going to follow now remember still let the main thing be the main thing the rest of the things are just filler material it's okay to work around with fellow material you know but don't stay there too long because the main thing is the main thing so this morning i have a title feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that's my title of a subject the son of man and i have an inspiration unless from mauritian 108 11 take it and eat it up which is that book amen praise the name of the lord you love him blessed be the name of the lord so i hope that god activate that twist in you the tooth for life a lot of people go to church but they're not twisting for life see twisting for life is something different you're hungering for something beyond you more than you above you is what god promised yes i come that you might have life you want to live you want to live for the lord you want his life inside of you you don't want to try a thing and have a religious spirit upon you because you know some religious stuff and you come to pay your respects and you know you come to church because you don't want people feel the backslide and so on you don't want to be in that mood you really come to toast for life and life means a change in a transformation because you born you have your own life your own desires your own thoughts your own ways your own ambition your own feelings and so on like that but this life is a different life this life is god's own life and the first gospel that jesus preaches that you must be born again so you could take your whole life and wrap it up with christianity wrap it up with a bible wrap it up with religious thought but that's not what he's talking about good behavior nice behavior and so on that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a real change a real change that god could really speak to you a real change that god could get to you god could rebuke you god could could instruct you and direct you many people don't want instructions guidance leading they don't want that they want what they want you see um so this book is not a chewing gum you chew it to it and then spit it out if you just chew it you get sweet you know you get the thing to taste it's sweet in the mouth but you have to eat it and when you take it and eat it once you eat it it gets bitter that's just how it is it's sweet in the mouth but when it digests when it goes on in the inner part when it sinks when the strike is subconscious it's not sweet so much down there because you have to stand for something now this is the inner man now this is in your heart now that's what you have to stand for okay so let's start now there was nothing in heaven that could have done it john looked the book the bible said he saw there was no one upon it was worthy to take the book the book of redemption there was nobody in heaven worthy nobody beneath the earth nowhere was able to worry to take the book and to loose the seals or even look on it and he wept because in this book was the book of redemption so there was a book in the book in this book was the book of redemption and this book of redemption had names that had to be called you couldn't miss it if you try god is not no compiling the book and compiling names those names are written before the foundation of the world so it's not as if god looking at your behavior and said because you behave nice he's going to put your name on the book he put your name on the book and then come for you whether you're in the bar whether you're smoking whether you're drinking whether you're sinning it doesn't matter what you were doing if your name is on the book he coming for you because all that the father had passed has given me shall come so this is not god ruling a dice and gambling this is a specific action a specific action to bring back what was fallen not by their fault but because of adam oh glory to god we were always supposed to be sons and daughters of god we were supposed to be born of god by spoken word through adam who had the names of the book but we fell from that and god promised to restore us back to that so you say he said you have to be born again of the word and of the spirit and if you have to be born again of the word and the spirit the word is therefore sealed in the book because that is where your true gene take a whole from the book itself now when you understand by revelation that your name is in the book there is enough devils in hell there is no devils on the earth there is not there is any atmosphere there is there is not enough devils and torment to stop you from pursuing the purpose that god raised you up for you can't help it this thing is built-in [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know when a baby time come to walk after crawling crawling crawling you know what is going on your mother could hold and grab the baby wriggling to come down because something inside that child is saying time to put me down i know i know where mine are crawling i i born to walk oh glory the god eyes are crawling is a stage and you crawling groveling is a stage god call you to walk to walk on your land to walk on your promises to walk on your inheritance you want to walk in it you are not a church member you send a prophet to get you out of church to rescue you from spirit of man you ain't a shout in the house this message is not to bring a new man to you is to deliver you from the spirit of man it's the spirit of man that crushed the church in the beginning on the nikolaiton spirit controlling laity the holy ghost itself was to run the church the holy ghost itself was to be upon the sons of god that was preaching the word of god but the holy ghost left because they went off the word and man take over when god was supposed to be having the preeminences man push yourself forward but this hour here call going and push out number six and number seven go step on the scene oh give the lord a shout in the house the lord himself yes and now the angel the lord himself descend from heaven with a shout and that shout is the seventh thunders off of revelation 8 1 oh glory to god revelation 10 3 and 4 he sent us out together bride together no devil no church man we're going to stop you from hearing the voice of god god has said no intimacy god has said no mary between you and him he going to speak direct once more the world will hear direct from god could we give the lord a shout oh hallelujah you may be seated but over you mean we are to hear direct from god yes shout out yes what did jesus access church who do men say i the son of man i am now he is not expecting you to say son of man who don't i men say i the son of man am some say you are this some say you are jeremiah some say isaac he said who do you say i am and then the disciples get caught daddy books and tapes of three and a half years there's still new years they read about him they study about him but they still don't know who he is because the father hair dropped down yet the only following this man with a beard the only following this man who's a messiah there's a ton of people in the message no following some man following somebody never heard from heaven all of a sudden peter all let me get caught you know who may say i am they watch one another like if she is not talking to them peter said there were the christ the son of the living god he don't have the holy ghost but you have revelation because the father the lord is that spirit the spirit dropped upon peter and it pelt out his mouth and jesus made an astonishing he said upon this rock which is revelation i want to i want to qualify that divine revelation they're not facts i'm not texts i'm not talk then a pastor teaches something that is divine revelation that is the spirit taking what is spoken out from the early pulpit and revealing to you so that you take that and put that in your pocket you're going with that there's nothing in your head that's in your heart your husband can't take it over to you your wife can't take it out of you childs can milk it out to you oh god have mercy a roof blow off that cat take it upon because upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell itself can prevail against it this church stands triumphant this church that jesus transcends triumphant and the devil himself is afraid of it oh glory to god hallelujah upon this rock i will build my church one day you're gonna know what the church is built on who is the church who is prophet at church and what that church stand for and what that church can do [Applause] oh glory to god you believe that so in that book was the book of redemption he's praying a prayer here you say there god made those are not that standing they want to accept you they realize lord this has not been done until this time and now you confirm it and prove that it is so father father that in their hearts that strangely move at this time how do we not know that this is the last person to come in this may be the end of los angeles this may be the last soul that will be born into the kingdom note his word he didn't say the last word that come into the message or the last soul that believed god and a prophet he's not talking about that he said maybe this is the last soul that come into the kingdom born into the kingdom we don't know when that time comes and when it does the door will be closed the body will be complete it will not be a freak body or a freak brain it will just have so many members whose names were put on the lands book of life before the foundation of the world to which jesus came to take like adam walked right out to save his wife i pray god that you receive them into the kingdom they in your hands deal with them lord i pray in jesus name so this is no gimmick this is not iffy thing this is not that this is the names in the book he come for them and he would lose none you heard that that should put all the fear out of your spirit all the fear out of your heart he shall lose none so therefore the unsealing of the seals the breaking of the seals was to release a prophetic vision without which the people will perish the vision is what makes you see the main thing outside the main thing you will see doctrine teachings topics but not the vision write the vision and make it plain every family home and marriage or business that have a vision is different from everybody else you could see somebody with a vision and somebody without somebody with vision of focus somebody with vision have a long-range story a long-range binoculars that is somebody with visions somebody without vision the only scene today for today they can't see a fire off and that way people say if these things be in you and a bomb they give you the ability to see a fire off oh glory to god hallelujah those who have don't have that is blind and tendency afar off the vision gives you the ability to stay fire off and you could work with patience towards accomplishing what the vision has revealed and nobody could show you all because you see in it oh give the lord a shout you can't expect others to see it when it's revealed to you or give the lord a shout you cannot give another human being a revelation you can't do that let's continue oh i'm going to skip it out this is from the time as john was sent to wind up the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the messiah just before his coming in jerusalem shout it out messiah a message to introduce the messiah in other words we have to step from one step to another step hallelujah because john came to introduce messiah john didn't come to have a bunch of disciples following john even though he had some disciples but he came to introduce the messiah do you get that church oh glory to god and that's the messiah introduced before his coming now watch go into the prophet's chamber watch them seven steps where did the where did they guard me the challenge to bring the comment to the presence of the king at the top of the steps what's the seventh step there shows here we go there's got to come again that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we have got to come to our place again to something that going to introduce the messiah and he going to appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word the bible know what her husband her mate which is the reveal word so we have the bible it was a closed seal book people don't know that but when the seas were broke it become the reveal word and it revealed christ revealed in his own word and revealed to himself to his bride not just chatting with his bride but given about revelation and revelation is prevailing power oh glory to god is not right and overcoming keeps life in you so if you have to keep life inside of you you have to overcome to keep life in you say it after me overcoming keeps life in me that's right so told us to overcome one of the release tests so anytime you get a test you should shout and praise god because every test that comes your way is to ensure you keep life oh glory to god you are alive you're not like some rubber ducky and you just stick just like that or some oh glory to god overcoming we overcoming this morning glory to god the government says shut down the church for the next 28 days and you still come on this morning we're going to shout before we get shut down we got praise god because we get shut down shutting down cast up the shock inside of you did you can't squeeze what god put inside of you nothing no weapon could stop no child nothing present nothing to come oh glory to god if the whole world is frustrated you can't be frustrated with them if the whole world set up you can't be fed up with them let them get fed up shine that light [Music] glory to god glory between the sixth seal and the seventh seal is the call out of 144 000 between six and seven five something six or seven see you something always interruption it doesn't just jump over there's an interruption this year 2020 is an interruption because something coming next there is where the trumpets come right here persecution horses loosed and between that there's a seventh angels message that have been preaching and condemning the pentecostals and jesus has been put out no cooperation nobody but it was rejected the bible said so now this is thus saith the lord i'm not making other friends now as soon as the church the bride i like how we say that he's not talking about church on his bride as soon as the church he said the bride is drawn together and you know we're joining by together right she is taken up in the mystery of the seventh seal [Music] [Applause] that is why your anointing is not from the six seals your anointing is not from loose ends your anointing is not from interpretations and suggestions and mine ideas on what they think and what they study in some book your anointing is not from there when god pulled the sea for your anointing there was silence for a space of half an hour so the devil don't know nothing on the deal no demon could interpret that servancy to you he can't tell you what not there he can't tell you what is there oh get the lord i shout i love it i love it i love it i love it the devil can't talk oh when that seven seal is concerned he can't talk at all oh glory to god hallelujah soon as the church is drawn together she is taken up there's the main thing in the mystery of the seventh seal or the seven see the mystery of going so the bride is going by the mystery of the seventh seal and the jews are going by the mystery of the seventh trumpet or give the lord a shout the trump is for the jews the thunders for the bride oh glory to god do you hear his voice this morning there's gonna be a real going home there's gonna be leaving here oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you lord and the reason i do believe here we go when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a song from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride it will take her off the earth in the rapture in grace so here's another promise putting over you that you will be called out elected for such a time as this because many are called to be church members to be believers but few are chosen to be elected to be kept hallelujah with his capstone of divine love many are called but if you have chosen the bride is the chosen the bride is the predestinated the bride is elected or give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah when when elijah thought he alone was the only one what did god show god said listen there are seven thousand that you don't know about under that seal there's seven

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so when them thunders he said he said watch them seven straight thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven perfect seven heavens couldn't write that heavens can't know nothing about it nothing else because there is nothing to go on it he said it's relaxing time it was so great it was kept secret from the angels why if satan get a hold of it he might do great damage there is one thing he don't know you see the other six seals he can rip that up but this is one thing he don't know he can interpret anything he wants to he can impersonate any kind of gift but he can't know this it's a total secret it's not even written in the words the total secret the angels everything shut up all the time there's noise in heaven hallelujah glory yes what blessing honor might but when the sermon's he broke angels who always singing bitched up he said they were awed by it they were stunned by it this mystery of under the seven seals stunned the angels oh glory to god the angels maybe they hide their face and god make sure what was under there didn't reveal itself in heaven and heaven was only silent but when it break the atmosphere and come unto the earth thunders throw their voices out the thunder's never offered in heaven the thunder's utter in the earth [Applause] glory to god so when the devil standing from his balcony of his access to see what's going on because you know you have a meet up there i wish i could see it but he keep my business accuse any veteran day at night so you have to have a gallery a portal where the debate like a prosecutor look what you do look look what you do look look we did last month look we last yeah look this look this that's his job you have a special portal waste and they argue with god i know what jesus said is blood blood blood once his name on the book he said look my blood i pay i pay for that it's not that he can't do it you know but he paid the price for that look the currency here so to the devil's answer jesus says i'll press repeat blood i'll put a record of blood i know you never have blood here to go back yeah no kiss but if the blood not over you have a case you say yeah yeah well i have no blood for that because i mean they accept my blood you have to deal with that oh once there's blood there a case is there calvary is there for you devil have no case your case has been diminished dismissed and you are justified as if you that didn't hit the right yet you know that hit you yet you know you are justified as if you never did it some people come and say do this and do this who do that which one of them that do that you talk about me you don't want me me who put god put my name in the book if god before us who could be against us is that no god put my name on the book you want to accuse me satan the accused of the break no wonder the bible says he's cast out he is cast down just are we losing that pose that accuser pulse that platforming only losing that just though he can't even go there oh glory to god when the bride goes up the devil comes down lost that position no more accusation the bride is free glory to god oh my there's going to be a pride i'm going to prove it to you there's going to be translation i'm going to prove it to you there's going to be change of the body i'll prove it to you oh hallelujah oh glory to god i ain't looking to get all and die and drop down at all i'm looking for this old carcass to be changed this gray hair turned back black and these old quicky bones gone back very young oh glory to god hallelujah praise god there be no crippling the rapture there be no blind people in the rapture there be no dumb deaf people in the rapture oh god have mercy he is coming for a perfect brain glory to god there's no sinners going to the rapture there's going to be mrs jesus christ she has to be part of jesus christ flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life isn't that right remember satan will try to impersonate he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do we notice through the antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this here's why here's the key to that because he don't know it one two there is no way here for him to know it tree it's the third pull he knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it so he is born by his ignorance he cannot understand it he cannot know it there is no way for him to know it so you and i become a mystery on the earth to lucifer that is why there's extra heat on your trial because two hundred thousand thousand devils have been loosed against the bride and them devils have been loosed to try to get you off the world but as long as you stay with the word god will show you a continuation of the word as long as you stay with the world he's going to confirm his word because he can only prove his word by believers oh glory to god do you see it this evening do you see it this morning hallelujah thank god so jesus said who do men say the son of man pieces of christ one said you never learned this i see it not to be big but to drive down a point you never learn this in some seminary some man never taught you this but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you that i am not father and holy ghost but i am jesus christ and upon this rock what rock the same one evil went on the same rock upon this rock this spiritual spiritual revealed truth of god i'll build my church he said the gaze of hell will never prevail against it so god alone holds this key this key to revelation god alone holds the key isn't that right and he said no he said what the christ the son of the living god he said blessed are those simon son of jonah flesh and blood never reveal it to you reveal it to you but my father was in heaven and upon this revelation alone i'd be my church therefore here we go there is no school no theologian no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it is impossible for them to know anything about it god has hit the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers he did that hit the senses of knowing it no they could talk it like intellectual talk but knowing that by revelation they don't have it you talk about the elected teachers let's go down it's a personal individual of fear with the person that christ is revealed to them oh you think back now when you came to the lord who was there somebody testified to your book a bible whatever it is and the lord break your heart and you're coming you want to get baptized that whole operation wasn't a man think back about that there was no denomination there was nothing all of that was god you can't convict yourself it's a spirit that convicts you you can't just say i want to get baptized with water no something pulling you to the word that you want to obey the word order that was god god preserve you and keep you and then you come to the church and then start to learn of god and learn of the world because you don't know him and to know him you have to get his word guys like god tell moses bring them two million people out to this mountain because they don't know me they know the galaxy and leaves from egypt they know their life in egypt but they don't know my word bring them to this mountain that i could reveal my law to them when moses going up there dancing and prancing partying because they get liberty now they're not no longer on the pharaoh lockdown so now they're not on the pharaoh lockdown they start a on the bottom of god mountain moses hearing from god seeing theophany asking a little backpack to see god's face god say i can't share my face look at the back part you see a man you see a teopany a word buddy moses getting ten commandments written by the hand of god fireballs and a stone and the people dancing and partying making a golden calf oh glory to god god told moses put a banner wrong they have a co-pass a gold pass kill it there's holy grounds don't let nothing cross there hallelujah why fire belching on top of the mountain people partying and dancing and carrying on fornicating adultery and carrying on and a man hearing direct from god on the mountain of god oh glory to god fire fire in the mountain when moses come down he said my god who is on the lord's side hallelujah come here unto me or give the lord a shout god kill them the same people that came on god kill them and the same people in this message that come out god will kill them if they don't want to continue with the word this is no game as it wasn't visa noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they eat they drank they bought control but something supernatural was happening oh give the lord a praise offering this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to god this is not a pentecostal church this is not a regular church god has come down in this hour to reveal himself to this age to call a bride out have to see it you have to want it you have to be part of it you have to see your elected to it [Applause] alone no theologian can tell you it is not known it is hid from them they know nothing about it god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ and the most illiterate person upon this rock i'll build my truth that is why you don't need education to hear from god because the most illiterate person could get revelation from god that no man could take it out of their heart you don't have to be able to read or write but when god write that in the heart that might say a new heart i will give you a new spirit i'll put within you and i'll write bits in your heart my laws the same god that wrote in them rocks ten commandments he could write on your heart you could leave here with a new mind with a you heart with a a new way of thinking a new approach god could drop and cleanse your spirit my god fire could break up on your soul even right now while the world is going forward a silly knife cut out what is not of him and cut it out glory to god doctor jesus come on the scene and deliver you right there for you right there oh god i feel inspired this morning hallelujah let us let us say lord have mercy upon me stinking leopards filthy lepers wrapping in lepers dying man have mercy upon me and jesus said oh god when jesus is talking to do something jesus said go and show himself to the priest he said come and hear me and get baptized in jesus name and come to church and i'm the pastor and listen to you talk the talk no religious talk go and show yourself to the priest and while they were walking just while they were walking walking in obedience to simple instructions you can't disobey you can't obey what if they don't get instructions instructions are giving you to apply god give you instruction for your children have you applied it god give you instructions for your own life have you applied it god give you instruction concerning your husband have you applied it not god will give you god i've given you instruction to consider your wife have you applied it you answered that bible talk about people in here in the wood here in the wood man like a man in him looking in miranda forget what mana manny is not to do all the words just hearing god said my people the people they only like to approach me with a mouth but the heart is far from me they sit on so long they're rotten in the message the religious sending message the weary in the message the killing time in the message killing time on the premises wake up church still your spirit up oh glory to god is a rumbling in the camp a rumbling of god oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god he said no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school nor than nothing he is born in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you here we go the life of who of christ not your anger not your temper not your cussing not your bad behavior not your rude mouth not your attitude not that that is you the life of christ is projecting itself to you because something happened inside of you and it's working as well there's a father like projection up to you with the preeminences to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders die so me too the life had to project out of me i say directly to you and the people have to see the signs the wonders and the miracles not more talk be talking for 10 to 40 years short on that that's what i want i want you to want that if you don't want that you just hear more talking you have to want this too you have to want god's servants to come into action i'm not hearing you [Music] [Applause] if you want god's servant to come and action you pray change immediately hold them baby prayer praying where you stop that baby praying you'll be rocking them to bond that man lord fire and fire cleanse them purge them oh god hallelujah we want to hear from you this morning oh god i want to be healed i want to see the pillar of fire ricochet out the building inside the building nobody leaving the same way they came your pair rocking when you come here the man of god under the anointing because god answered your prayer and you bring the revival from your house you have come here looking for a charge you should get your charge inside your house what charge you talking about bring your charge here you're coming for that charge one day battery yeah plug it in for the record if you read your bible every day and pray you must have a church must have a little thing clinton come here there's a door near your car praise and worship i ain't taking that channel other churches may accept that but not this man behind this desk i ain't taking that from nobody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i ain't taking that god has sent me to preach through a bunch of catholics you are witness or methodist oh glory to god like i tell her brother if long dress is making it then then them them then we call it again none other than the um people um the amish people them get you up there already them not only went along just the red bullet and the body tying under the chin here close right up here neck up here and the husband wearing tall hats and they're not even driving car got that too modern they're still driving donkey cat in the states if that is the message when then they make it they're ready but god i respect that that's not what we got come for the whole ho ho ho ho ho ho but hold up over here who want to emphasize that piece of filler they could emphasize that no it doesn't give you a right to write that just something or anything like that that's not what we're talking about experience when we talk about the middle of the road so it's not that and you have to have it in your heart to want the right thing you have to have it in your heart to dress the right way because if you address right way it just show you have a sex spirit or filthy spirit upon you so you want to parade your beef but if you catch yourself and recognize this is the word and you want to be bright for christ then you'll act right you talk right you're just right you'll live right you do right and you will come out right [Applause] you know how we're going to finish yesterday [Music] watch god's revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation not by more revelation by lack of it is why we have so much different divisions so divisions is not come by people are revelations is luck lack of revelation the right one because revelation is sovereign that's the word people don't like to hear none at all they don't like the word sovereign because anytime you stop sovereign you have to tell them get off my back don't try to kind of run me there's no secret asian thing where you're trying to run the past you try to do anything behind here don't try that we will cut your head off sovereign means no external forces influence influencing the church the pastor is led by the holy spirit to preach whatever he feels led to preach [Applause] [Music] thy suffering a change from and when some man calling on the phone and said you know where the inspiration is for 350 football today see what we have uh-huh everybody preaching that now oh i had a picture too i think you get your own phone number you know the guy that preached what to preaching to i just preached what the lord revealed to me [Applause] sovereign means just that if this church had 12 people it's still sovereign i bust a man when we had five in cairo i said you're trying to say there's a convention i said yes should we fight people and say yeah he didn't believe it but i believe it someone tell me here recognize us as a church i say that you die what do you think do you know how god see you sovereign means just that well revelation that is sovereign means god could reveal to whosoever he will somebody could be back said in 50 years coming here this morning and god revealed himself to them and you can't get better at god because he is suffering you could get a breakthrough in five minutes because he is suffering you could be healed in three minutes because he is oh god could do anything this morning oh give the lord a shout god's sovereignty to your life is not dependent upon me or the preaching or the teaching that should make you want to shout my god i'm feeling [Music] they're here in my back raising just thinking about this kind of thing that means the pillar fire could come here this morning that means the service got over in five minutes because the glory of god to fill the tabernacle in five minutes that the minister can't even stand to minister because god is suffering that we have a revival this morning revival is suffering in court he could send a revival he want to send a revival i see no reason why you can't be healed this morning i see no reason why you can't be delivered this morning the fire is already here to free you and to deliver you oh glory give him some praises right now right now raise your hand and give god some praises [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me be seated by lack of this revelation is why we are so much divisions among us so much mockery so much divisions among us because the people like that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers the teachers the teachers lack that revelation see all right can we continue we want to talk about a man in the scriptures here genesis 14 verse 18 says and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him this is abraham after abram fought brought back a lot from me and delivered lot after ibram fought this man named melchizedek he brought him wine and bread brahman said he could give god give after victory after battle communion communion and no star this thing is wheat back then wine and bread oh give the lord some praises and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessed of him alert and blessed be the most high god which are delivered thy enemies into thy hand and he gave him tights of all oh my hebrews chapter 5 speaking about the same man for every high priest taken among men is ordained of men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins so christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he said unto him thou what my son today i have begotten thee and he said in another place the what a priest forever after the order of merchandise as he said in another place though at a priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death was heard in that he feared though he was a son yet learnt he obedient by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek oh glory to god and wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his will of his counsel and confirmed by oat that in two immutable things in which it's impossible for god to lie we have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay whole upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul the soul can get an anchor not tossed and driven by the anchor when you drop down the no dublicate movie oh glory to god the anchor for the soul both show and steadfast which enter it into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus he went before us made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek is from chapter six chapter seven for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the mosh high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a ten part of all first by being interpretation king of righteousness after that king of silence which is king of peace without father this man called meditate without mother this man called me chester no father no mother without descent having neither beginning of days no end of life but made like unto the son of god abided the priests continually and consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave a tent of the spoils and verily day that of the sons of levi who was received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham for he whose descent is not counted from them received heights of abraham and bless them him that made the promises let me skip a little bit and i may say also levi also who received tights paid tithes in abraham levi pay tyson abram for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him therefore if therefore perfection were of the levitical priesthood for under it was the people received the law what further need was there to have another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek hallelujah and not being called after the order of iran for the priesthood being changed there must have necessity a change also of the law so it wasn't the aaronic priesthood was the priesthood after the order of manchester united for whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe of which no man give attendance at the altar for it is evident that our lord spangled the judah of the tribe moses spake nothing considering priesthood it is far more evident that after the similitude of mercedes they arise at another priest who was made not after the law of cannon commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testified that what a priest forever after the order of melchizedek for there is verily a disanon of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing of a better hope did by which we draw nigh unto god for in as much as not without an oath he was made priests but those priests were made without an oat but this with an oat by him that said the lord swear and will not repent the what a priest forever after the order of mercedes by so much that jesus was made a shorty of a better testament and they're truly of many priests because they will not suffer to continue by reason of death but this man because he continued forever had made an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he's able to save them to the utmost that come unto god oh glory to god because he could intercede continually our unchangeable priesthood a priesthood according to the order of melchizedek oh glory to god pleaded on your behalf hallelujah that one we we worry to read again but this man because he continued forever had an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing him forever to make intercession for them for such a high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners made higher than the heavens who kneeled not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice not daily first for his own sins and then for the people but this he did once when he offered himself oh glory to god the priests in the old testament had to offer sins to himself and for the people but this priest he offered himself only once he had perfected forever then that are sanctified oh god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah who needed that daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then of the people for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law make it men high priest which have been filmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forevermore oh glory to god i thank god i get you that one i tell myself i don't know how to reach all these scriptures but i read it true oh glory to god ever i met a man i'm a serious man no father no mother no descent had no beginning of life no ending of days that man is still alive tonight oh glory to god that is god oh glory to god he's eternal oh glory to god hallelujah and jesus was made after the order of the priest of melchizedek hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah there is no way god could get to you outside of revelation that is the only way god is getting man not by your feelings not by your emotions but by revelation when god speaks you and reveal himself that is how he gets the man oh glory to god the whole bible is the revelation of god and this from a mission who's in merchandise the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there is no other way to know god only by revelation isn't that right to whom the son will reveal him everything is revelation oh glory to god revelation is everything if abraham was looking at his own senses he never confess he'll have a child it's revelation that he had in isaac that was so much inside him he couldn't give sarah that sarah had no revelation god gave the manly revelation and leave the woman out of it so same man was grumping complaining fussing and abraham to believe god for himself and sarah also and an old man watching the old woman and believe god that go translate and transform both of them oh glory if abraham had that faith in the beginning and we are royal seeds of abraham let me say that again if abraham had faith in the beginning and we are royal seed of abraham god would expect us to have faith to be changed in a moment [Applause] here's why it already lived out so wait a minute you think oh glory my god my my my my my god those don't take are going crazy just a little bit just a little bit not total crazy oh hallelujah my god oh god help us tonight so you think abraham just had a son just have a son and believe god and whatnot is

coming oh give the lord some praises hallelujah i'll listen to the prophet revealing this you know now we find out that this person had no father no mother no beginning of days no end of life it was god and murphy and the world the word greek word means change it means to change like on a stage act one person is changing this mask to make another character recently i went to a play our shakespeare and one young man had to change his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts the same person he come at one time as the villain then he come out next time another character and the greek word and morphe means to change his mask and that is what god did in the same god all is the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the power of fire the same god has made flesh and breath among us and murphy brought us out so he could be seen and now that same god is the holy ghost father son holy ghost three offices three acts of one god notice like a sculpture he hides a mask over it that's what god has done to this age it's been hid all these things has been hit and it's supposed to be revealed in this age and the bible says that they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his peace of the world covered up until the time he take the mask off and there it is and that is what the bible has been it has been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and is a sevenfold mystery and god promised and this day at the age of this laureation church he would take the mask of the whole thing and we would see it what a glorious thing god and morphy mask in the pillar of fire hallelujah hallelujah god and morphe in a man called jesus god and morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us condescending all glory to god and when god came along and change his tent and come down and live with us he become one of us first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh handled with hands god eat meat god drank water god slept god cried he was one of us beautifully tight in the bible not seeing god coming back coming back coming back coming back oh glory to god will be guarding you do you believe that here's the part i want to get to god came down and became flesh and die the debt in christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it [Applause] seven drops of blood seven church ages hallelujah to do what clean the church [Music] [Applause] you yourself wouldn't drink in the dirty glass you have to wash the glass we're going to wash you up you have to clean the church oh glory to god to come into it for fellowship god loves fellowship so anything breaking up fellowship is satan notice anytime somebody get under the spirit you know what happening no fellowship any church any past any group they cut itself off they cut the people off what they say from why do them from such student away from such yet only research if that is the type of search can you imagine peter seen from searching away until paul is your person pokemon jumped it and straight peter he said switch took picture to the face hope he's still away from that there's gordon paul and there's god and peter and peter messing up do you know the first time he changed off key when jews felt they chose a man named matthias you have no book of matthias gospel matthias the church holy ghost filled man choose a wrong man but i had to put a man inside the idea but god choose paul to be one of the twelve not matters paul was the man but the church choose and elected a man named matthias brothers was unrealized brother but he wasn't a man of god but the church put him there when god chose he would take no jews called saul with all his consent and make him paul there's a good one without his consent go there ask him you want to be poor you feeling polish didn't know god do it you know because his name was in the book his name was in the book in the book when fire striked him so what oh lord he said yes sir now waiting for the call all the time you don't know what to dial you know what the dial know your who are the lord say i am jesus and i come to get you you will become paul oh glory to god god actually consenting this over here this battle that begin in heaven go and finish

oh glory to god i don't need nothing else to convince there is god and he's alive when he is true and he's real and he's just and he's faithful and he is pure and he's worthy and he's a shield a buckler stare a strong and mighty tower he's my righteousness oh glory to god he's my chief he's my song hallelujah he's my rock i can lean on him oh glory to god he never failed me yet i failed him but he never failed me yet he is my lord and my god oh glory and the devil can't do nothing about this connection between my father and i okay the lord i shout in the house i am also conceived i am no devil child oh give the lord a show i'm a child of the king oh and that can't change [Applause] how many believe that how maybe you're a child of the king you a child of the king that can't change oh glory to god that cat james you're smoking contains it oh glory to god you're playing around couldn't change it godzilla fine here oh glory to god the prophet prophesied said this word will fall in the hands of the predestinated your family was predestinated wherever the world catch you you was ordained to be i don't know if they will follow you you was in hell you had to find it oh give the lord a shout out [Applause] what are the pulling of your baptist church your methodist church and your message church too [Applause] call them devils come back in the message you know yeah we didn't want to go there this morning no no it's too much on time for them hallelujah hallelujah but once a wednesday he go he could have been preaching without that you have a picture that wednesday i'll invite you to right so watch so watch god came down become flesh died enough death in christ so that he could clean christian order to get into it for fellowship god loves fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was fellowship because he did well alone and he had enough of this alone thing he had enough of this alone thing that was history foreign was all alone he wanted fellowship angels worship him but that is not his kind that angels created was in the back part of his mind had sons sons and daughters not yet expressed oh glory to god just think about it now think about your little baby child isaac gideon andrew my three sons when you were babies i can finish your brother i guess there's no fellowship there babies when they walk in the cath fellowship until they say the talk and understand where they're talking then you can fellowship so god wait on this or until the fullness could be revealed that when you begin to pray and talk to your god you could talk with some sense he incumbents our viewers like if they don't know what you're talking about they're not loot age or wesley busy age where that which is perfect is come where it's supposed to be of clarity of vision of purpose division should be made plain oh glory to god plain so plain that nobody could throw you off of what you're supposed to be focused on as your inheritance as your promise as what you're pressing after as paul said forgetting in the past i pressed towards the mark what is that mark of the high calling in christ jesus that market at a church that markets in the group that mark is not a man that's not making a pastor or some message pope they hate me for calling them out message popes one who are talking about they know who i'm talking about who the catholic where is it i get message book message pope people want to be in charge of hallelujah why are you in charge of the bride like jesus christ mystical buddy you guys know who anybody and you want to be in chat you can chat to church members you can run them left right put boots on them left right and turn them upside down but that bride you can't do that braham says she no man can make her do otherwise she have dusty at the lord or she keeps still she are predicting and no no no if you eat the book as we read dear eat the book you could only prophesy from the book [Applause] you can eat the book and probably say something else what book eating is the book you know the book of words the nintendo when you digest that book and eat that book out of your belly the only come the word that you're eating if something else coming out your mouth what book you eat you add to the book or what you take some pages inside the book you make your own book hallelujah you're printing books now oh glory to god but if you eat this book that's why he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word anytime i hear messages i always go back and find it where it's written i have to find it inside of here that's just how i built oh glory to god forgive me look that's certain of me hallelujah oh glory to god could you take a little more when moses saw him exodus 20 33 2 he was a teopany moses wanted to see god he had heard his voice he heard him talk to him and seen him in a bush and god said no man shall see my voice i'll put my hand over your eyes i'll pass and you will see my backpack not my face and when he did he saw the back part of a man hallelujah the word came to moses in the form of the pillar of fire in a burning bush the i am hang in there hang in there don't sleep on me right now don't get worried just a little more again we're going to push there's a last service in this kind of form where you will be here oh glory to god so just right with me right now this is very important my god i was so excited when this broke upon me i couldn't wait to get here to minister this this morning hallelujah hallelujah as the word of theology from the theophany rather excuse me he came to abraham as a man under the oak tree he switched to abraham now now look here there is a man came to him why did he come why did he come abraham being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son and also he was a god prophet that was trusting god's word isn't that right the word comes to the prophet you said the word in a theophany you said was that god abraham said it was he said his name he called him elohim now genesis 1 you find out in the beginning elohim created the heavens and the earth and abram said it was elohim he was in t orphan he formed so the prophet in this same message you should listen to it who's in my chest he talked about the thought a word is that not expressed and god moved from supernatural spirit into a word body called a tiophony that was the logos then he come step forward luther to let us make man isn't that right so what it is elohim in theory form we find out he was in t orphany form he called him lord god elohim notice but no matter how many abraham saw it it was one lord everyone said my lord this was merchandise so the man that came to abraham with two other men he said this was the melchizedek notice after the battle was over melchizedek served his victorious child communion think of it part of himself he said jacob russell all night wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right and after battle is over then god gives you of himself that is true communion you see this little bread and water just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you wrestle it out and become part of god but melchizedek after his child abraham won the victory melchizedek met him and gave him bread and wine showing that after this early battle is over we will meet with him in the heavens and take communion again it will be the wedding supper i will not drink no more of the vine until i eat and drink it with you in my father's kingdom wine in the beginning and bread why not the ending oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god he said we made jesus in the air oh i'm going to skip that therefore the theophany if you died and enter into that tiophony what happens that he often come back to the earth to pick up the redeemed body if you're in the air you take the body to meet the geophony there you are caught up go to meet the lord in the ear that's the mystery raptor right there if you're alive and remain you caught a meaty tiophone if you're down going on it you often come to meet your glorified buddy when they put the box on the ground you're coming to pick that up and glorify that take it up oh god so yeah you're not missing anywhere oh glory to god we are dead at all oh glory to god that's why we wouldn't hinder them that they're asleep oh glory to god we will let him the door that i sleep the lord himself descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and we who are alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air wherefore comfort one another with these words look at that these are last service in this way could you imagine we have a last service i'm not talking about no carnivorous thing you know one day last service last service after that is rapture time you know oh glory to god people call in and find out when his next service and he pass the photo ring and ring and ring and ring and ring you hear a voice message it's like yet a billboary here and said pastor not there you say if he said this given funny pass the house and blow your horn and nobody coming out hallelujah say the pastor god things that they call other believers just to make sure the person going away somewhere and recognize people people missing and everybody they get to answer the phone they dear with you too with you where it's tribulation dive you know i don't want to be in that you dear who else are wrong this is the time to apply the blood this is a time for extra oil this is the time to stop playing church games who is this manchester deck but god we see here plainly oh god skip that notice it is three stages for perfection just like he redeems the world the same reading this church now this book whose is my chance that was uh i see the 21st of february 1965. this was one of the mysteries that was revealed under the seventh seal the one in mississippi who is this merchandise and insider this year there was such a bomb such an explosion because we take things for granted but right inside of here he talked about there are three stages to perfection just like he redeems the world same reading the church he redeems the people in three stages first justification like literally preach second signification like where they preach third baptist then comes the rapture no here we go nobody knew this what we about to read here now nobody knew it before listen to this no the world how did he read in the world the first what he did his sin he washed it off with water baptism then he dropped the blood on it from the cross and sanctified to call his own then what he do he tore the world out of you and renovated the whole thing by a fiery baptism of the holy ghost he will also renovate the world he is typing what god do in the earth now watch people by doctrine and teach and see noah and the flood came but the real higher order of the revelation of that is that god is redeeming the earth and lucifer didn't know that all lucifer do have people sinning and carrying on and god know from grace in god's sight god call out no once i got drunk here and in that natural level here you see in flood man ark noah preaching around 20 years flood come and destroy them all but at the higher level that's the first stage of god redeeming the earth itself the earth that lucifer is squatter thinking he is in charge of god already done pay i started to redeem it blood hit it when jesus died in calvary his blood hit the earth isn't that right there's only one thing remaining behold i sent you elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord what come in fire coming to burn fire fire fire going against the earth what is he typing you are justified you are sanctified and then you get a baptism of fire they are preaching it but it's still there fire to come into your soul fire to come into your heart oh glory to god you are not feasting on a man you are not feeling a man you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man i want to give you a comfort tonight as you leave here for today that you're not listening to fairy tales and connory vines fables hallelujah hallelujah i ain't come to bring in a dream hallelujah i'm bringing my thoughts and ideas what you're hearing is dossier the lord oh glory to god you hear what i said what you are hearing this morning all the other services you're hearing is thus here the lord you can rest your soul on it because we saying what the tapes say by inspiration and revelation oh give the lord a shout hallelujah let me say this to you right now this church here was built by vision revelation and prophecy let me say that again god this church was is here by vision revelation and prophecy oh hallelujah deal with it oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah who don't like it who want to question it and challenge it deal with it nothing will change that hallelujah i am not the vision i am not the revelation i am not the prophecy oh glory the vision is the vision the revelation is the revelation and the prophecy is the prophecy and if the prophecies of god it can fail the sec gonna be healed that's prophecy gonna be fulfilled the blind is gonna see that's under prophecy also there's gonna be a revival that's also prophecy the power of this church going to write that also on the prophecy oh glory i can't change it oh glory to god it's already prophecy hallelujah hallelujah no man can change it if god said it it must come to pass nothing going to change that hallelujah god going to move on changing upside down to bring in the past he will do it but it will surely come to pass there will be a church but jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp oh glory to god could we give the lord a praise offered hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god [Music] oh give him some praise and worship that's okay that's fine [Applause] so let me read and see it again water blood spirit fire right he said no watch he said no watch he also will renovate the world and it will be burned over fire and cleanse every germ including coronavirus for millions of miles high everything will be cleaned off and there will be a new heaven and a new earth that can lie that's in the bible john's i saw a new heaven hallelujah before it happened is i saw it that's part of the vision a new heaven and a new earth a renovated hood renovated heaven renovated new heaven new earth every demon all day all them sputnik all them satellites building up inside there all that getting burned up god firebomb and all them all them probes they're proving why did they come to church and find out what what behind there before there was a moon and star all them scientists spending all the years studying all them things going to pluto and mars and venus they should come to us to find out what's going on with all them things we're going to take them beyond that foreigners beyond them stars and moon oh glory to god what we have to take us beyond all of that before the very beginning itself then want to know what big bang and the beginning we going before the beginning and everything if i go before the beginning you'll find us right there that's why we are here this morning shouting and praising god because our name is on that book before big bang we were dear oh small bang big bang whatever bang you think it is we were there back here oh glory where was though when i lay the foundation of the earth and the morningstar sun together and the sons of god shouted for joy before you had cancer before you had humor your eye wasn't working right oh glory to god give the lord a shout you are going to be healed oh hallelujah [Applause] you can't let your faith get paralyzed by fear you do the right thing and believe god hallelujah paralyze you know hallelujah take care of your trembling inside your nose you know let the devil try outside your house because you fit inside your house oh when fear knock on your door open the door let me say it again when fear knock on your door oh jump that door open and let fate step outside of here hallelujah i've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed-backed bread though ten thousand fall on my right side shall not be moved the lord is my strong and mighty tower oh glory to god in whom will i trust [Music] [Applause] glory glory i've given you something to write about now showing much the natural birth is tree what happened when a woman having a baby first break water next is blood then it's life water blood spirit god vindicates that it has always been right god finish finnick to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that is considering the redemption did you get it he said let me say it again the predestinated is the only one that is considered in redemption people might be making like the thing they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the word redeem is to bring back is that right to redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place so if it's only predestinated we'll be brought back so who we phone you he called who he called justified who he justified he had already glorified oh glory to god let me say it again don't look at your sins and your feelings and shortcomings look the fact that you were for known no you'll get delivered who informed you he called hallelujah being eternal with him at the beginning eternal life that you had he's told that he was he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the pulpit to say he wanted you to sit in that seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose is that right and it's brought back to your glorified state it is matured and is brought back hallelujah so jesus who he was alive in the old testament manifested so that is why jesus tell them abraham so mighty and rejoiced jesus said abraham saw my day and rejoice and they blessed jesus until for your father greater neighbor he said before abraham was i am. [Music] [Applause] because jesus met abraham not as jesus oh glory to god so he said jesus says abraham saw my day and rejoiced let's continue here he said no what he was alive when the old testament manifested i just want you to see a little something here if you can stand it when jesus was manifested in the old testament as we believe it now you preachers out there you can argue with it do whatever you want but i'm talking what i think when jesus was manifested in the old testament in a theophany in the personal melchizedek not a priesthood but a person the man this man was not yet born but he wasn't antiophany so he had no father no mother he was god himself he was manifested in the form of a man king of salem which means king of peace king of righteousness he was melchizedek he neither had father no mother big enough there's no end of life it was jesus in the theophany in a form of man oh give the lord some praises if you didn't know now you know before your man was hallelujah let's continue then he was actually made human flesh and dwell among us in the person of jesus himself born of virgin mary he come in that form so he could die and went back to heaven now in this last days he promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit luke 17 30 even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so this malachi for prophet was to introduce this luke 17 30 this son of man and a son of man so what you're hearing what has been preached to you is not the words of a man oh glory to god it's the words of the son of man okay the lord i shout oh this is something to shout about this is something to rejoice about hallelujah let's read this here in the last days he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit for as it wasn't there is a sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look at the soda how it's set taking place and jesus being manifested in bodily form of his church today doing the same thing same work same thing he did at that time upon the earth today he has manifested himself in human bodies our human bodies that he has called i've done exactly the same thing he done in sundry times times of his flesh upon the earth doing the same thing today because god in sundry time spoke to the fathers through the prophets in the last day to his son jesus christ see the sun being revealed in the last days god manifested in human flesh setting before the sudden description the end of the gentile world he's talked about sudden destruction the end of the gentile world god manifested in flesh so we now just come into church we are receiving a message because god again was manifested in the flesh in this generation in this 20th century [Music] [Applause] [Music] now the next thing is when it's all gathered up into that one person jesus christ bride and body at the physical return of the lord jesus he when he brought an earth kill crucified rays manifest himself in the form of body which is a bride not the angel is the son of man but he is revealing the son of man and the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1 to 7 read it when you get home the seventh angel's message open up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that is where it seems to be so hard for you not the son of man himself but the seven angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it left the shock he can't organize it it's in the grain oh let me hit the home stretch here hallelujah praise god so that man that tells sarah and see why this syria life is backwards to the tent and but abandon many times will turn us back to the congregation and tell them the condition and so on behind it to prove it's just seen god hallelujah that took up some flesh and step into it that same god stepping behind brother branham to show the same god oh this you mean the same god same god you mean you have a message sent from god yes you mean you're not hearing from a man no oh glory to god listen to this that man turns back to the tent why did syria laugh how can these things be what was it this element prophetic see now he said here we go that will return again and the son of man which was son of man right here he was called elohim lord god elohim everybody knows that elohim is the lord god in the beginning 11 18 the all-sufficient one the son of man made flesh there he was standing in the flesh at that time like a teopany standing there designing what sarah was saying in the tent behind him he promised watch the royal seed of abraham is promised to see the same thing did you see it did you see it in the prophet that sign of the son of man hallelujah now if you belong to a church that don't believe that he is the same yesterday today or forever the same in every way get away from it he promised these things to happen in the last days that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember it wasn't jesus talking to abraham dear that could is in the torch in syria's mind that was not jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that abram called elohim the great almighty and jesus said as it was and there is a sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man has been revealed not no more as church but as the bride is called in that day the son of man will reveal what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the bride [Music] so when we leave here married we go to the wedding supper you go to the banquet the bridegroom call will come right through this when the solomon will come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not the clergy man hallelujah and when the word here unites with the person and they become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the truth become one whatever the son of man does he was the word the church does the same thing oh glory to god who is that son of man all the word gathered up hallelujah open six seals gathered up into the seventh seal and that is the son of man there isn't that right in the day that someone reveal reveal himself not son of god son of man will reveal himself and that will make malachi 4 and so on like that oh my oh my hallelujah oh my honestly i could wrap up here time run number here but i want to get through this today oh glory to god he talked about that chief and who preached about it talk about that quick thing power and the that was waved and whenever they first would come to maturity what they do with the purple they come in front and they wave it before the lord oh glory to god think about that now the first one come to maturity to take it and wave it before the lord and that wave it is a testimony that others come in oh glory to god oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god so when the first son of man came he came and made promises to the disciples oh glory to god you cherish me power after the holdings come upon you you open the old testament to them oh glory to god all the seas of himself and the old testament he began to wave promises upon them he preached upon them receiving the holy ghost isn't that right because he rose from the dead with quickening power and can wave the quickening power over them that they will be quitting by that same quickness oh glory to god when he rose from the dead they were all in a kind of backside condition who went fishing who went here who went dear all of them gone in their own way but he gathered together by seven thunders oh glory to god he gathered a church together oh god in a private ministry oh in a little room and begin to openly understand the scripture he no more in public hallelujah privately he breaking the bread to them privately open their word to them privately openly understanding privately reveal the seals to them oh glory to god they still lock up they're still in unlocked dung oh glory to god he's entirely necessity to jerusalem until you'll be undrew it far from on high and those disciples went into the upper room and they were waiting they were waiting they were waiting knowing god promised fire god promised power god promised supernatural oh and when the day of pentecost was fully come oh glory to god don't come the holy ghost don't come the river of life don't come the fire of god don't come to transforming power and they will become manifested sons there's not a stretch they start to give power all through them quit them power on their tongue speak in other tongues quickening power on their hands quick than powers on their feet it was all over them it was dynamics to the mechanics glory to god listen to the prophet let's be close mission comer please he was wave over the promised seed that had the promise of life oh glory to god and christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth right and they have to be a chief wave again in the last days hallelujah hallelujah you heard that there has to be a sheath wave again in the last days once the sheath is waved it means your others coming oh give the lord a shout no wonder but ivan says i wish i could live to see it [Music] to see what the manifestation of the sons of god when sons speak and the word is created just like that hallelujah christ was the first one who raised and there's got to have a sheaf to be weave again last days waving of the sheaf what was the sheath the word the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath he said it was wave over the people and the first time they will comfort for the bright age a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full hear the message here the main thing as the main thing the full maturity of the word has turned back again in his full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders he dig back there he was waved to them the word which he was was wave back there to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest no i say it's the bereave again in the last days oh hallelujah we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics we need the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline oh glory to god and we see egypt we see joseph taken away in order that the buddhism can rise they have to rise our fear that you know jesus take

couldn't sleep and then uh she spoke to her friend enoch as enoch pierre who immediately invited me to church and when i came to church that sunday a few weeks ago i enjoyed this service and i was prayed for by the elders after the service and when i explained what was happening to me they told me that i need to have faith in the lord and i've never stopped having that faith and today i don't fear my neighbor i'm sleeping well at night and my appetite is whacked and my relationship with my family has improved tremendously i know that god is real and if we don't have him in our lives we are

seated just for a few announcements amen we have a visitor in our gates i don't know if she's still here esther cabe invited my sister kate she's still here okay god bless you welcome so happy to have you with us amen so church as undoubtedly we should all be aware uh the prime minister announced yesterday that the country uh would be i guess the world would be restricting uh certain things it is not a complete lockdown but certainly certain things are restricted in an effort to i guess flatten the curve or physical distancing in these things and within that churches or houses of worship places of worship have fallen under that category and effective tomorrow morning at 6 00 a.m we will not be able to meet in the first instance for 28 days and so we of course would be abiding by that so as we would have done before we opened up again um we would take our battle formations as we did before and at church say amen we have our established group leaders and we thank god that that has something that is operational and in place and we'll look over that to ensure that we are in contact with everybody and you certainly have somebody to reach out to our services will go uninterrupted uh we will of course use technology as we have done before so this tuesday we have bible study via zoom on wednesday night we will have service it will be streamed as normal and within the constructs of the law i think we're allowed i think up to maybe a few people uh in the building i think a maximum of ten so um at times we will come a very very small group and actually do the service here so we can actually preach as we would have done before we will preach without an audience here and you'll have to be shouting in your homes and i'll be looking hoping that i can hear you brother entwine from maraval so when we're preaching here we can still hear you can the church say amen so our services go uninterrupted so this tuesday see this continues at uh 8 pm for bible study via zoom wednesday we have service at 8pm just stay tuned um but it should be available via youtube and our regular channels of course on friday night we'll be pre-meeting via zoom and sunday morning uh will be a live streaming service and um brother and i will identify a very small team that will come to manage the technology so we can actually preach to you live and have a wonderful time in the lord yeah i love the lord this morning amen so stay on the firing line stay in prayer uh stay safe use wisdom we're not operating with fear but we're operating with wisdom as we are on we are in unchartered waters as a globe as a planet but as a people uh who are called by his name we understand the season and a time that we are living in and we want to be compliant both within the context of the law the ministry of health and complying by his word as well you know and beloved used a tremendous type and he was preaching and he typed that mask to putting on the blood on the doorposts was the same thing as putting on the mask so while you're wearing your physical mask to live make sure that that blood is applied on your life and you have that mascot that protection of the token upon you and your host as well maintenance group five please meet with brother mike blackman after the service and church stay on fire don't let the devil take your joy and we'll be shouting on the hills of glory i will tell you this before we leave this place we're going to have our foot so on the devil that the devil will be running to and fro trying to figure out what's happening to him so keep keep building up the vials of your prayers keep adding the full word value in your life and one of these days the dynamics will connect to the mechanics that's been preaching you all of these years we are in a hauling period waiting for that season so may the lord richly bless you with anthony [Applause] amen praise god hallelujah you love him today hey man amen hallelujah amen so let's get ready
