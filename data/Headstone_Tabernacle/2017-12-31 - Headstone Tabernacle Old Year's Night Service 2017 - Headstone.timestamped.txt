[1:55:57] million people come on Egypt out of this
[1:56:00] powerful ministry that Moses had and
[1:56:06] after all I was done and so time would
[1:56:09] come for God to switch over and here was
[1:56:13] that Moses had brought them out but he
[1:56:16] couldn't bring them in
[1:56:18] and God knew that two and a half million
[1:56:20] people coming out he wasn't gonna go in
[1:56:24] because of their unbelief
[1:56:27] yeah come so far up to the promised land
[1:56:31] that was promised to their fathers I was
[1:56:35] promised a lot of possession a land
[1:56:37] flowing with milk and honey a land
[1:56:40] flowing with good things
[1:56:41] I'll and flew in with wonderful promises
[1:56:43] a land flowing with the baptism of the
[1:56:46] Holy Ghost a land flowing with signs
[1:56:48] wonders and miracles a land flowing with
[1:56:50] all the promises of God in reality in a
[1:56:55] manifestation something you could see
[1:56:57] and taste just like grapes
[1:57:00] Oh hallelujah hallelujah but because our
[1:57:04] the unbelief it couldn't go on
[1:57:07] it's not right I'm just pop raising this
[1:57:09] story here unless we come down to the
[1:57:11] end we see Moses is passed away and God
[1:57:15] didn't take a coffee break God didn't
[1:57:19] take a vacation go all those longing to
[1:57:22] see his children come into the place
[1:57:24] where there won't be wet always belong
[1:57:27] into their position into their authority
[1:57:31] into the police he always had it in his
[1:57:33] mind for them God said Moses my 7 is 10
[1:57:37] now therefore take the people over no
[1:57:41] time to wait no time come on let the
[1:57:44] dead bury the dead but this caravan is
[1:57:46] moving on we've got a revival to see
[1:57:49] about Oh hallelujah oh we've caught a
[1:57:52] hallelujah we've got a sec the hill
[1:57:53] we've gotta tell to me race we gotta
[1:57:56] plan to see hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:04] onami hurry on quick
[1:58:07] so mooses ministry switched over to
[1:58:08] Joshua after the death of Moses God told
[1:58:12] Joshua said moves myself isn't there now
[1:58:15] therefore arise and go over this Jordan
[1:58:19] down all these people onto the land
[1:58:20] I do give them even to the children of
[1:58:23] Israel and every place that the sole of
[1:58:27] your foot shall tread upon God have I
[1:58:29] given unto you as I said unto Moses so
[1:58:33] footprints means possession
[1:58:35] you are not possessing anything until
[1:58:39] you put your foot on it you are not
[1:58:41] really possessing anything until you've
[1:58:44] been there until you've tasted the
[1:58:46] grapes until it's a reality you can
[1:58:49] claim anything or you can't clean any
[1:58:52] ministry unless called him unless you
[1:58:54] are possessive hallelujah in the real
[1:58:56] and truest sense there's got to be some
[1:58:59] evidence of called moving in and out
[1:59:01] among the people there's got to be some
[1:59:04] evidence
[1:59:05] somebody's got to happen something's
[1:59:06] gonna take place it's got to be proven
[1:59:09] scripturally before you could clean
[1:59:11] anything
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:16] so Joshua meditate day and night
[1:59:19] so now Joshua on a strike this heal
[1:59:21] quick is the Old Testament and the Old
[1:59:22] Testament he's in am either a man that
[1:59:25] we're talking about is now right this
[1:59:26] man called Joshua but in Ephesians
[1:59:29] perilous Joshua is now and Joshua is
[1:59:32] actually the Holy Spirit is now in the
[1:59:35] book of Joshua is now right the Holy
[1:59:37] Spirit is actually being depicted as a
[1:59:40] great warrior Joshua as a great warrior
[1:59:43] spirit
[1:59:44] whoa overcoming spirit he is the one
[1:59:47] that's leading the charge and checking
[1:59:49] his instructions from the unseen captain
[1:59:52] himself he's a great warrior how the
[1:59:56] Holy Spirit is a great warrior a great
[1:59:58] warrior just like Joshua was that's what
[2:00:01] His Holy Spirit is today so when God was
[2:00:04] finished with Moses he didn't none trust
[2:00:06] the church really to a man but that
[2:00:08] church has now has been entrusted in the
[2:00:10] hands of the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[2:00:12] Spirit is the endtime leader that was
[2:00:16] sent to take the people over and the
[2:00:18] place the people positionally in the
[2:00:20] promised land and the Old Testament it
[2:00:23] was a man but in Hell right in this Asia
[2:00:25] now right in his Ephesians time right in
[2:00:29] this pride age the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:00:32] Ghost the same place the people
[2:00:38] positionally yeah it from here
[2:00:42] back up in here the Holy Spirit no
[2:00:47] longer mine
[2:00:50] I hear me tonight God use a man as a
[2:00:53] shadow or type in the Old Testament but
[2:00:56] in the New Testament we cross over and
[2:00:58] we see the power brother Branham points
[2:01:00] our eyes to the Holy Ghost so now that
[2:01:02] endtime leader is not a man it's not
[2:01:05] some ministry it's not on five for
[2:01:07] ministry it's not some dis or some that
[2:01:09] but it's the Holy Ghost in the Apostle
[2:01:11] or Holy Ghost in the pasta and the
[2:01:13] teacher it's what we be doing the work
[2:01:21] and tonight we need a Holy Ghost back in
[2:01:25] the church the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] and the young people it'll make you walk
[2:01:29] straight it'll make you a crutch
[2:01:31] it'll make you say the right things
[2:01:33] it'll make you do the right thing it'll
[2:01:35] make you jump
[2:01:36] it'll make you shout it'll make you pray
[2:01:39] it'll make you go on your knees and I'll
[2:01:42] make you scream and I'll make you cry
[2:01:45] the Holy Ghost will change the way you
[2:01:48] want it'll change your nature it'll
[2:01:51] change how you worship it'll change how
[2:01:53] you approach a service no more dead
[2:01:56] services and now you're alive unto God
[2:01:58] now you're on fire for Jesus because not
[2:02:01] only does the holy olio
[2:02:07] in your life somebody praise them
[2:02:14] [Applause]
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:20] all right I'm running away two minutes
[2:02:24] and I'll strike it this great warrior
[2:02:27] Joshua he knows no retreat
[2:02:29] he knows no surrender there are no
[2:02:33] prisoners with this great warrior Joshua
[2:02:35] when the devil
[2:02:36] I took wall is running for all these
[2:02:38] years when the Holy Spirit is ready to
[2:02:41] ride his trail one more time the devil
[2:02:43] better get out the way tonight because
[2:02:45] God is getting ready shall ride his
[2:02:48] trail one more time two hundred thousand
[2:02:50] Thousand Devils God's gonna cut a path

[2:03:03] preached in its power
[2:03:06] [Applause]
[2:03:09] hallelujah listen listen
[2:03:12] Joshua speaking to the priests city
[2:03:15] Kaliyuga covenant I'm passing for the
[2:03:17] people watch and it took up the Ark of
[2:03:19] the Covenant I went before the people I
[2:03:21] love the scripture here let me read a
[2:03:22] crate he said on the Lord said unto
[2:03:24] joshua this day when I begin to magnify
[2:03:28] he and all the sight of Israel that they
[2:03:32] may know that as I was with Moses so
[2:03:35] would I be with t this is a beautiful
[2:03:38] scripture tonight because when we when
[2:03:40] we look a remark I for said then we see
[2:03:43] that Joshua represent a holy spirit
[2:03:45] there's gonna come a time when the
[2:03:47] Ministry of the word is gonna switch
[2:03:50] over to the Ministry of the Spirit and
[2:03:52] the Holy Spirit it's gonna be so
[2:03:54] magnified before the people that all
[2:03:57] fate will be inspired and all confidence
[2:04:01] will be fully in the leading of the Holy
[2:04:03] Spirit and his ability to lead us
[2:04:06] through the wilderness his ability to
[2:04:09] lead us through the trial to the testing
[2:04:12] to the persecution don't he slay me yet
[2:04:16] I trust him the Holy Spirit glory be to
[2:04:22] God
[2:04:24] the leading of the Holy Spirit not
[2:04:27] looking for any man more after the
[2:04:31] Prophet but just like the Prophet said
[2:04:32] Joseph in a Hebrew means Savior and he
[2:04:35] represents a promised endtime leader to
[2:04:37] take the church over and Caleb
[2:04:40] represents that true believer who stayed
[2:04:43] with Joshua oh and that's who you are
[2:04:45] tonight you are a true believer oh you
[2:04:49] wouldn't take no for an answer
[2:04:50] you didn't take the devil's lie in the
[2:04:51] beginning and we're gonna kick him out
[2:04:53] donkey as well whoa I ain't meant every
[2:04:56] word a meant every word I'm almost
[2:04:59] finished
[2:05:00] so our confidence is supposed to grow
[2:05:02] and the Holy Ghost ability to lead the
[2:05:06] church just as he did with the prophets
[2:05:08] the prophets that he waited on his
[2:05:10] office and he said you know what I'm
[2:05:12] waiting or I'm waiting on the angel of
[2:05:14] the Lord amen he didn't do nothing
[2:05:16] without a danger and the Holy Spirit
[2:05:18] will go everywhere with us when that
[2:05:20] dynamics time comes the leader Church
[2:05:22] hallelujah a man going everywhere
[2:05:25] confirming the word with signs wonders
[2:05:27] and miracles isn't that right that bride
[2:05:31] waiting for life to come to her god of a
[2:05:32] civil age but in obedience this is a
[2:05:35] feat woman that lives by faith the bride
[2:05:38] person here here he said Oh somewhere
[2:05:40] else he said some other church some
[2:05:42] other domination it's not somewhat up he
[2:05:44] said but believes the Word of God
[2:05:45] obediently waiting in love for the
[2:05:49] promise of the age should be confirmed
[2:05:51] she is waiting for it she is part of
[2:05:54] that word and she is waiting for her
[2:05:57] life to manifest that were pressuring
[2:05:59] can you see it he said I hope that
[2:06:01] didn't go over you he said the party is
[2:06:04] waiting which is a word waiting for a
[2:06:05] life which is a spirit to confirm or
[2:06:08] make it alive that's what she's waiting
[2:06:09] for no other life will work in her she
[2:06:12] can't come to life any other way yet she
[2:06:14] feels it out there and she knows that
[2:06:16] it's going to happen and then there
[2:06:20] happens the prophet section wakes up he
[2:06:23] said God let there be he said she'd
[2:06:25] comfort just like the first one come
[2:06:26] forward
[2:06:27] josè Joshua but attacks here quick he
[2:06:31] was waiting on instructions just for the
[2:06:32] Holy Spirit how Donna lo use commanded
[2:06:35] to do
[2:06:35] and they say we turn on instructions and
[2:06:37] the Prophet said he said no let us stand
[2:06:40] like Joshua and Caleb as we see the
[2:06:42] Promised Land coming in sight
[2:06:44] he said it's narrowing the time to be
[2:06:46] given Joshua no Hebrew means Savior and
[2:06:48] so on he said Caleb represents a true
[2:06:49] believer God started Israel as a virgin
[2:06:52] with his word but he wanted something
[2:06:53] different so did the last day church he
[2:06:56] said but notice how God and move on with
[2:06:57] Israel until his own appointed time he
[2:07:01] said now listen it's gonna be something
[2:07:02] Joshua waited for that time no matter
[2:07:05] how much the people said God give us a
[2:07:07] land God promised now let's go and take
[2:07:10] it they might have said that
[2:07:11] Joshua lost your commission you're
[2:07:12] washed up what are you doing but he said
[2:07:15] you used to know they'll see the Lord
[2:07:17] and so on he said but this wise God sent
[2:07:19] prophets near the promise of God but
[2:07:21] also knew how to wait for that promise
[2:07:24] clear-cut decision from God for his time
[2:07:27] see these powers now watch he said I
[2:07:29] went a time come God give it to Joshua
[2:07:32] who stayed with him by the word and he
[2:07:35] could trust all others he couldn't trust
[2:07:37] others but he could trust him and so
[2:07:39] will it repeat amen hallelujah so God's
[2:07:42] gonna have a last day Brian that has the
[2:07:44] ability to wait I say wait on the Lord
[2:07:46] wait until hallelujah at a time
[2:07:49] appointed through it Terry wait for it
[2:07:51] it shall surely come to pass and Joshua
[2:07:54] waited and he waited on his office until
[2:07:56] all of a sudden you come an angel and an
[2:07:59] angel say take off your shoes and Joshua
[2:08:01] pull out his sword and see other force
[2:08:03] against us and I didn't just say no and
[2:08:06] I'm the captain of the Lord's hosts oh

[2:14:04] between nations there's a great warfare
[2:14:06] going on beyond that and that's a
[2:14:08] warfare between God and Satan a great
[2:14:11] warfare that was the first warfare and
[2:14:13] it's still raging but oh I'm so glad
[2:14:16] it'll soon come to an end and that's
[2:14:19] what I want to speak about tonight the
[2:14:21] end of the war this war that started way
[2:14:24] back way back in heaven when Lucy four
[2:14:28] raised up because he wanted worship but
[2:14:31] Michael the Minister of Defense in
[2:14:33] heaven said he was not having it and
[2:14:35] there were some angels that were
[2:14:36] representing us that stood with Michael
[2:14:39] and the war that was a war of angels
[2:14:41] became a war of Menem and that war
[2:14:44] existed in Genesis it existed in
[2:14:47] Leviticus it existed in numbers and went
[2:14:50] to Deuteronomy it was the Anna book of
[2:14:52] Joshua it was there in the books of
[2:14:54] Kings it was the in the books of Samuel
[2:14:56] and now that war is still raging but it
[2:15:00] is gonna come to an end that war has
[2:15:02] been running for a long time
[2:15:04] rahama fell victim to that war just one
[2:15:07] fell victim to that war that war brought
[2:15:10] death that war brought pain that war

[2:16:23] land and I see if you leave people on
[2:16:26] land for too long they can make a claim
[2:16:29] on the land and the devil has a squatter
[2:16:32] he has been there for a very long time
[2:16:33] but it comes a point where there's a
[2:16:36] little bit of time when he's been there
[2:16:38] for so long but it's even if you don't
[2:16:40] take action you can make permanent claim
[2:16:42] on the land so I be tonight we have come
[2:16:45] to take action and a few minutes are

[2:18:32] could do in his power to stop you but
[2:18:34] the Branum said you didn't even find a
[2:18:36] message God had to bring the message to
[2:18:38] you against all odds you grew up in the
[2:18:42] Baptist Church you grew up in the
[2:18:43] Methodist Church you didn't grow up in
[2:18:45] church and it was not by your put into
[2:18:50] our family but something in your soul
[2:18:53] was connected to something bigger than
[2:18:56] yourself there are people tonight who I
[2:18:59] hear because it's a ritual to them in
[2:19:02] their mind it's a ritual
[2:19:04] but you couldn't come here tonight
[2:19:05] unless there was a seed in your soul or
[2:19:09] you don't hear me tonight you don't hear
[2:19:12] me tonight because you are not in
[2:19:14] control you are not in control of your
[2:19:16] future he is the one who was controlling
[2:19:18] everything he said I am alpha and I'm
[2:19:21] the Omega
[2:19:22] I'm the beginning and the end turn every
[2:19:25] page I'm there in the middle of your
[2:19:27] trial I'm there David short is here too
[2:19:30] I make my bed in hell he is there it
[2:19:33] doesn't matter - ten thousand four oh
[2:19:36] you know hear me
[2:19:39] you may be seated I said it last week he
[2:19:42] attributes but the Jonathan that's
[2:19:45] locked up in God it's not for himself he
[2:19:49] doesn't need to be healed because he
[2:19:51] cannot get sick he doesn't need to be
[2:19:53] raised up because he doesn't get
[2:19:55] depressed
[2:19:56] oh you don't hear me tonight huh so the
[2:19:59] attributes that locked up and called to
[2:20:01] him to pour out to somebody God cannot
[2:20:08] get crippled so his ability to heal the
[2:20:11] is not for himself I don't care
[2:20:14] you can in mine crippled and
[2:20:17] body crippled and spirits and mate that
[2:20:20] same Jesus is the same yesterday he is
[2:20:24] the same today he is the same forever Oh
[2:20:28] hallelujah
[2:20:31] oh I'm getting ready to close out I'm -
[2:20:34] Liam I'm gonna be long hallelujah but
[2:20:39] it's against all odds in the Bible in
[2:20:44] the Book of Jeremiah 29 it says what
[2:20:47] thus saith the Lord in verse 10 that
[2:20:49] after seventy years we accomplished at
[2:20:51] Babylon I will visit you in other words
[2:20:54] after a period of time existed in your
[2:20:57] life of uncertainty after a period of
[2:21:00] time that existed in your life of
[2:21:02] whatever trouble you went through in
[2:21:04] this year or whatever period of time
[2:21:07] we're talking about he said I will visit
[2:21:10] you and perform my good would - what you
[2:21:14] he's not performing something to you
[2:21:16] that you didn't hear before he's
[2:21:17] performing his word to you in causing
[2:21:20] you to return to this place so I know
[2:21:23] the thoughts that I think toward you
[2:21:24] saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[2:21:28] of evil so when you are in his mind he
[2:21:31] is not thinking of punishing you he's
[2:21:33] not thinking of evil towards you but is
[2:21:35] to give you an expected end in other
[2:21:38] words at the end of your story
[2:21:40] he knows how it's gonna end and no devil
[2:21:43] no demon no sickness no boss no neighbor
[2:21:47] no lack of money no whatever it is will
[2:21:50] stop you from your expected end
[2:21:52] [Applause]
[2:21:55] and this is where changes in your life
[2:21:58] then shall ye call upon me and he shall
[2:22:02] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[2:22:04] unto you and ye shall seek me and find
[2:22:07] me when ye shall search for me with all
[2:22:10] your heart and I will be found of you
[2:22:14] saith the Lord and I will turn away your
[2:22:16] captivity and I will gather you from all
[2:22:19] the nations and from all the places with
[2:22:23] the I am driven you saith the Lord and I
[2:22:25] will bring you again into the place
[2:22:27] whence I caused you to be carried away
[2:22:30] captive turn to your neighbor and said
[2:22:33] timeout devil the war is ending the war
[2:22:39] is ending tell your other neighbor the
[2:22:41] war is ending the war in my house is

[2:23:06] problems war is ending because he is
[2:23:08] your hova Tyrel he is a home Arafah he
[2:23:11] is your over Niecy
[2:23:18] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:25] I'm not going to be too much longer so
[2:23:28] everything in your life has been the
[2:23:30] odds are stacked against you because his
[2:23:34] strength listen carefully is made
[2:23:36] perfect in our weakness so God is a
[2:23:40] jealous God he doesn't want to share
[2:23:43] glory with anybody so when you are
[2:23:45] strong and you are Baal and you go out
[2:23:47] there and do it your way he gets no
[2:23:49] glory but you see when you are weak then
[2:23:52] his strength can be made perfect he
[2:23:55] loves it when your back is against the
[2:23:57] wall and he gives you grace to move on
[2:23:59] that's what allows you to worship when
[2:24:02] you're all else is wrong you can worship
[2:24:05] anyhow because it's his strength you
[2:24:09] know when you lift your hands it's not
[2:24:10] your strength but it's his strength
[2:24:12] because he kept you alive to see this
[2:24:15] thing he kept you alive to see 2018 he
[2:24:19] provided and he will provide because you
[2:24:22] belong to him Oh hallelujah
[2:24:26] oh my hallelujah hallelujah God had a
[2:24:34] plan for Joseph and Joseph had his dream
[2:24:37] and everything but then he was sold into
[2:24:39] captivity and it seemed as if all was
[2:24:42] against him how does a man who is
[2:24:45] connected to God find himself locked up
[2:24:47] in prison find himself thrown there with
[2:24:49] people who we didn't expect to be with
[2:24:51] but when all else was against him God is
[2:24:53] working his way out God puts them in
[2:24:56] Potiphar's house and he again all hell
[2:24:58] comes against him he's minding his own
[2:25:00] business he didn't go after Potiphar's
[2:25:03] wife she came after him he ran for his
[2:25:05] life situation after situation came
[2:25:08] through but what was it God is working
[2:25:10] as well because what God was to push him
[2:25:13] into position and for him to get into
[2:25:15] position he has to go to trials and
[2:25:18] situations and false accusations and
[2:25:21] lies and declarations all of that was
[2:25:24] necessary because he could only be
[2:25:26] effective in his position he could
[2:25:28] helpless people when he was doing water
[2:25:31] streaming by himself but when he was put
[2:25:33] at the right hand of Pharaoh no he's in
[2:25:35] position to do what God wanted him to do
[2:25:38] so every trial every test every
[2:25:41] situation every lie every accusation
[2:25:44] every problem you have had was to push
[2:25:47] you into position that our God could use
[2:25:49] you oh my mother close out Samson Samson
[2:25:59] losses here
[2:26:00] Samson lost his joy Samson losses
[2:26:04] victory Samson could look back to when
[2:26:06] he was on fire for God he could look
[2:26:09] back over the years to when God was with
[2:26:12] him
[2:26:12] but in that moment just before the war
[2:26:16] ended
[2:26:17] Samson found himself reminiscent
[2:26:19] thinking back to when the lion attacked
[2:26:22] him and he don't know where his strength
[2:26:24] came from but his strength came from
[2:26:26] somewhere else because it was not in him
[2:26:28] it was not in us it was not mine over
[2:26:31] matter but something came over him have
[2:26:33] you ever had that something comes over
[2:26:35] you your back is against the wall and
[2:26:38] and you can remember that ins
[2:26:42] and something is remembering one time
[2:26:45] they cage him and all hell was against
[2:26:48] him he also against him but he took to
[2:26:51] get and not just move Decatur he put it
[2:26:53] on a hill so they need a crane and they
[2:26:55] need a team to bring it back it's easy
[2:27:03] to talk about the past but the random
[2:27:05] said is he easy to talk about the future
[2:27:07] but he said the treatment of God talk
[2:27:10] about the gore of now the core of the
[2:27:12] present tense and something there stood
[2:27:15] be in his cell and as he's thinking back
[2:27:18] to when the power of God rose over him
[2:27:20] just then he hears the gates open and a
[2:27:24] young boy says Samson it's time to go
[2:27:26] the people are waiting for you and in
[2:27:31] that moment something in his heart
[2:27:33] brother Branham said he saw a
[2:27:34] possibility he saw a possibility that
[2:27:38] God could work for him one more time he
[2:27:42] saw a possibility that he could access
[2:27:44] the same power that he felt once before
[2:27:47] you could not be here tonight unless you
[2:27:50] felt a power once before and Samson in
[2:27:53] his heart as he was ladies it take me to
[2:27:56] the pillars take me in other words I
[2:27:57] want to be in position my blessing
[2:28:00] cannot come unless I'm in position they
[2:28:02] have to be in the upper room they have
[2:28:04] to be in position
[2:28:09] and when Samson stood he said Lord let
[2:28:12] me die with the Philistines and if I
[2:28:16] have a prayer for you tonight it's that
[2:28:18] we die with 2017 we die to the feelings
[2:28:27] and emotions and desires on the
[2:28:29] complaints it's your choice what you
[2:28:31] carry into 2018 you cannot blame the
[2:28:35] devil for what happens in 2018 because
[2:28:38] you could cut him off you could cut him
[2:28:42] off tonight you could cut off the devil
[2:28:44] oh I know something you don't even get
[2:28:46] that but the Bible said resist the devil
[2:28:49] and he will flee that's the problem in
[2:28:53] the church we have been entered here in
[2:28:55] the devil but the Bible says resist him
[2:28:57] and when you push back he's got to go he
[2:29:00] has no power when you push him back o
[2:29:03] Europe
[2:29:05] [Applause]
[2:29:07] I'm about to close
[2:29:09] stop giving the devil coffee stop trying
[2:29:12] to be a gentleman with the devil it's a
[2:29:15] war kick him out
[2:29:18] kick him out tonight I said it before
[2:29:21] it's not my outrageous and you're all
[2:29:24] you know my batters what is not yours
[2:29:26] send it back to the devil see Satan
[2:29:30] keep it in 2017 not 2018 this year is my
[2:29:36] year the year of my regime has come I'm
[2:29:39] leaving as righteous in 2017 um and you
[2:29:43] gonna speak it he clear it and walking
[2:29:45] it and say once more Lord restore my joy
[2:29:48] restore my peace restore my victory I'm
[2:29:55] closing out so the odds were against
[2:29:57] David the odds were against the Hebrew
[2:29:59] boys the odds were against Moses and God
[2:30:02] stepped into each situation to work his
[2:30:06] way out by the same Holy Ghost that was
[2:30:09] there and in our day the odds were
[2:30:11] against Jesus to even be born where he
[2:30:14] was supposed to be born so God allowed a
[2:30:16] lot to be changed and made it hard but
[2:30:19] everything was the line of her purpose
[2:30:21] to get him into position the odds work
[2:30:24] ends the prophet he didn't have the
[2:30:26] education he didn't have the resources
[2:30:27] but the odds were against him but yet
[2:30:30] still God allowed a message to make it
[2:30:33] to a people and the odds have been
[2:30:35] against you for your whole life because
[2:30:37] the devil doesn't know who you are the
[2:30:40] same way listen if the devil didn't know
[2:30:42] who Jesus was you think he knows who you
[2:30:44] are he acts Jesus if thou be and he was
[2:30:49] hoping that Jesus give him an answer but
[2:30:53] there are some things that we ought to
[2:30:54] keep secret so Jesus didn't pull out a
[2:30:56] business card and say yes I am I am the
[2:30:59] one no that was not Jesus when the devil
[2:31:04] asked him a question in God's heart he
[2:31:07] said that answer is not for him
[2:31:15] and when they never try to get the
[2:31:17] response from Jesus Jesus it is written
[2:31:19] his response was it is written when he
[2:31:22] keeping anything it is written he say it
[2:31:24] is also written and brother Branham said
[2:31:27] it was like an electric volt hit the
[2:31:30] devil and the devil went away for a
[2:31:32] season the devil for the first time we
[2:31:35] took a serious vacation since even
[2:31:37] because the word is powerful by itself
[2:31:41] and this is a secret brother branham
[2:31:43] said the word is in the bride and the
[2:31:45] word is the conductor of the Spirit so
[2:31:48] when the pure word is in your soul and
[2:31:51] you claim it as yours all it takes is
[2:31:54] the Holy Ghost to drop down and use you
[2:31:57] as an instrument and then the devil is
[2:32:00] finished because it's word and spirit
[2:32:02] together that's what what the Anthony's
[2:32:04] talk about we have been under the
[2:32:06] ministry of the world
[2:32:07] for all these years but now the Ministry
[2:32:10] of the Spirit in 2018 I'm under
[2:32:14] expectation to see God move like he's
[2:32:17] never moved before we will not always be
[2:32:20] having services like these friends we're
[2:32:23] gonna have services where people are
[2:32:25] walking and they'll be healed yes very
[2:32:27] anointing where we will not lay hands on
[2:32:30] the sick
[2:32:30] there'll be no dead believers in that
[2:32:33] church if you are dead the Holy Ghost
[2:32:35] will resurrect you because that's the
[2:32:37] season we are moving into so I'm not
[2:32:40] worried I'm not confused
[2:32:42] I'm not afraid I'm not sad or depressed
[2:32:45] what depression you're talking about the
[2:32:46] devil is depressed tonight because you
[2:32:49] made it you made it the 2018 you made it
[2:32:52] to your destination you made it to the
[2:32:55] end of the war
[2:32:56] [Music]
[2:33:01] hallelujah if not you then who
[2:33:04] if not now then when
[2:33:08] you have to make up your mind to tell
[2:33:11] the devil enough is enough you have run
[2:33:16] your race for a long time
[2:33:18] Sanka wasn't there after Jesus came and
[2:33:21] poured out the Holy Ghost on their
[2:33:22] Pentecost he was there any Old Testament
[2:33:24] and he told himself every year every
[2:33:28] year when I plant and I reap the
[2:33:31] philistine come and take my blessing I
[2:33:33] am tired of seeing my children not have
[2:33:36] food off of my labor
[2:33:38] I prayed outside I've cried it's time to
[2:33:42] do something different but the Branham
[2:33:44] said Sangha was a farmer he said he
[2:33:47] might have been enough cover all you
[2:33:48] don't want em jumpers you don't see
[2:33:49] people where that's anymore but the
[2:33:50] random describes Shimon I was having a
[2:33:52] jumper and he says I'm gonna look around
[2:33:54] for the only teeka define it was a UPS
[2:33:57] cord but the pranam said doctor isn't a
[2:34:00] weapon it's used to push a to keep
[2:34:02] moving
[2:34:03] but when shunga look at the Ox code and
[2:34:06] look at the Philistines could you
[2:34:08] imagine if their eyes made for those
[2:34:10] fellows I see that man has got to be
[2:34:12] crazy the odds were against him but he
[2:34:16] didn't look at the situation he didn't
[2:34:18] look at the problem in look at the enemy
[2:34:20] and brother branham said he attacked
[2:34:22] them didn't a get chance to attack him
[2:34:25] he attacked them and brother branham
[2:34:27] said he beat them all
[2:34:30] now listen you know what makes this
[2:34:32] beautiful shunga was not a soul here he
[2:34:35] was a left right left push up push up no
[2:34:38] he was a farmer he understands Ivan
[2:34:40] celery and pumpkin but when it comes
[2:34:43] time for war and I say it's time for war
[2:34:47] oh you don't hear me tonight you don't
[2:34:50] hear me tonight so I'm calling the
[2:34:52] farmers I'm calling them mamas
[2:34:55] I'm calling the fathers I'm calling the
[2:34:57] children because God will make warriors
[2:35:00] out of you he will make soldiers out of
[2:35:04] you
[2:35:11] I'm trying to close out but this thing
[2:35:14] is too good the odds against you it's
[2:35:17] something else you see and that's what
[2:35:19] the problems are some of us you know we
[2:35:21] have had it too easy so but the brown
[2:35:24] said lightly sizzle if love doesn't get
[2:35:26] you desperate then conditions will when
[2:35:29] you analyze some guy's testimony for
[2:35:32] years he was tolerating it you know it
[2:35:36] had to come to a point where he said you
[2:35:38] know what I fed up it was not an
[2:35:44] overnight decision he made it was built
[2:35:47] up over time like a pressure cooker he
[2:35:49] taken pressure he take him strain until
[2:35:52] it came to a point that's why the
[2:35:54] purpose of the whole creation it's
[2:35:56] grueling it's true feeling
[2:35:59] not one years two years it's treason
[2:36:01] it's years since since Adam lost the
[2:36:04] book the whole creation know something
[2:36:06] not right and we're getting ready for a
[2:36:08] big explosion but whenever there's an
[2:36:12] explosion I'm trying to close out
[2:36:13] something's got a spark the explosion
[2:36:18] there's gotta be something that ignite
[2:36:20] it has to be what is calling in science
[2:36:22] but a Steven correct miracle a catalyst
[2:36:24] is this a right word
[2:36:25] a catalyst is so many triggers brother
[2:36:28] George and when the catalyst is
[2:36:31] activated then it becomes a chain
[2:36:34] reaction so you can put gunpowder there
[2:36:37] and the Kanpur is sitting on the air
[2:36:38] brother Anthony normal but you like a
[2:36:42] matches and put it next to the Gunpowder
[2:36:44] but a George you know what happens all
[2:36:47] the people in the church who does be
[2:36:49] dead when the Gunpowder come and contact
[2:36:53] with the fire there is no devil no fire
[2:36:58] extinguisher there's no force that could
[2:37:01] stop the explosion
[2:37:02] you could try to contain it
[2:37:05] listen when fire and gunpowder come
[2:37:08] together you have two options you either
[2:37:11] explore with it or your run for cover
[2:37:16] and I believe one of these things is 16
[2:37:18] elements its prophesy to be not
[2:37:21] necessary anymore the change from motel
[2:37:24] to immortality so when this world is
[2:37:27] destined for fire these elements can
[2:37:30] handle any pressure because we're going
[2:37:32] to be changed before that time come I
[2:37:34] don't plan to be running for cover
[2:37:36] I plan to be part of the catalyst we
[2:37:41] will cause the explosion to happen
[2:37:46] I'm closing out I'm done I'm closed I'm
[2:37:49] finished but the random said if you
[2:37:53] can't have fit for a toothache for
[2:37:56] divine healing how can we have faith for
[2:37:59] the rapture
[2:38:00] so by deductive reasoning if a plus B
[2:38:04] equals C it means we can
[2:38:06] reverse-engineer a and B so it means
[2:38:08] that if we have to have fit for the
[2:38:11] rapture and fit for divine healing is a
[2:38:13] less of it it means that along the
[2:38:16] journey we have to see miracles along
[2:38:18] the journey we have to see the dead in
[2:38:21] the church raised up we have to see the
[2:38:23] blind eyes pop open and be encouraged
[2:38:28] Jesus I'm closing you could play
[2:38:30] something softly Jesus is their
[2:38:33] ministering and he meets a blind man the
[2:38:39] Bible says he meets the blind man and he
[2:38:41] deals with them and grandma gets heeled
[2:38:43] and the disciples Aksum who sinned that
[2:38:48] this man could be in this condition is
[2:38:51] it his mother his father his grandfather
[2:38:53] who he said this is not even about that
[2:38:56] he is in this condition that the works
[2:38:59] of God could be glorified and sometimes
[2:39:05] we think Lord it's only me in this
[2:39:08] position and why me and God assume you
[2:39:11] are blessed that I've chosen you to
[2:39:14] manifest my glory because God cannot
[2:39:17] open the blind eyes unless somebody is
[2:39:20] who was blind God cannot heal a
[2:39:23] unless there's somebody who is crippled
[2:39:26] so no matter what situation you are in
[2:39:29] tonight take courage and take fit that
[2:39:32] he who predestinated you is more than
[2:39:35] able to bring you to your expected end
[2:39:40] and the purpose of God will never be
[2:39:45] discouraged the purpose of God will
[2:39:49] never be stopped
[2:39:50] so Church of the Living God happy new
[2:39:53] year may God bless you in 2018 beyond
[2:39:58] your measure as David said may your cup
[2:40:02] run over may your cup run over tell your
[2:40:06] neighbors get blessed tell your family
[2:40:08] get blessed may this year God fill you
[2:40:11] with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:40:13] fire even till charity the bond of
[2:40:17] perfectness may you add the food using
[2:40:20] me seal seal you into the kingdom of God
[2:40:23] may his life be expressed in you and may
[2:40:27] this be the greatest time you have ever
[2:40:28] had as a Christian now listen there'll
[2:40:31] be rough moments there'll be tough
[2:40:33] moments even Jesus had his own rough
[2:40:35] moments he cried at the grave of Lazarus
[2:40:38] but when he said Lazarus come forth he
[2:40:41] showed he was more than man and I'm
[2:40:43] looking in this room tonight and I'm
[2:40:45] seeing modern man I'm seeing what manner
[2:40:47] of man is this because God has called
[2:40:50] you for such a time as this Church of
