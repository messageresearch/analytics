[33:46] stevenh oliv for the music tonight and
[33:50] we want to turn to our Bibles to one
[33:53] portion of
[33:54] scripture from which we will draw all of
[33:56] our context tonight amen and um that is
[34:00] uh St John chapter 15 I'm reading from
[34:03] verse 16
[34:05] there amen just the one verse so book of
[34:10] St John chapter
[34:13] 15 and verse
[34:16] 16 which says ye have not chosen me but
[34:21] I have chosen youen and ordained you
[34:25] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[34:28] and that your fruit should remain amen
[34:32] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[34:35] father in my name he may give it to you
[34:39] may God add blessing to the reading of
[34:41] his word let us bow our heads almighty
[34:45] God we thankful for your grace and mercy
[34:48] towards us Lord we are thankful for your
[34:50] word towards us father throughout
[34:53] generations and Lord and and times the
[34:57] world has remained constant dear God
[35:00] lord we know Lord father that we could
[35:02] rest or our soul upon it Lord for we
[35:05] know that in your hour of choosing you
[35:06] will manifest your word as you have
[35:08] promised so father we come gather around
[35:10] your word tonight Lord we pray oh God
[35:13] that your presence would come in a
[35:15] special way and anoint the word Lord and
[35:17] make it alive in the hearts of your
[35:19] people Lord pour out Faith Lord

[35:33] own we have no strength of our own
[35:35] father we Look to You Lord For You are
[35:37] the author and finisher of our faith
[35:40] Lord and without you we can do nothing
[35:42] tonight Lord without you I just a m
[35:44] mortal tonight Lord but if you would
[35:46] come Lord and and and uh move Upon Us
[35:50] father in your own sweet way Lord we
[35:52] could uh Lord be fully immersed in the
[35:55] spirit Lord then we know anything is
[35:57] possible ible then because it happens by
[36:00] your spirit dear God father so may you

[36:09] Lord as you have inspired it and may you
[36:11] bless us Lord as we wait to hear from
[36:13] you tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[36:15] pray and ask it amen and amen you may
[36:19] have your
[36:20] seats praise
[36:23] godall amen
[36:32] amen praise God so for a title
[36:34] tonight uh from our scripture Our title
[36:38] is your fruit shall remain am that's the
[36:42] title tonight your fruit shall
[36:46] remain God yeah Jesus spoke in this
[36:49] verse here very assuredly he says to us
[36:52] that he has chosen us we have not chosen
[36:56] him but he has chosen us and more than
[36:59] that he has chosen us to bring forth
[37:01] fruit but even more than that he's going
[37:04] to make our fruit remain amen he's going
[37:07] to make it stay hallah uh he's going to
[37:10] bring you into a constant and fixed
[37:13] position in fruit bearing amen isn't
[37:16] that right so the objective I have here
[37:19] tonight uh and why we want to get into
[37:21] this text uh is because that how God
[37:25] sees fruitfulness this is what kind of
[37:27] came to
[37:28] me and this is how God sees fruitfulness
[37:31] and its connection to the reward of
[37:35] Labor to the reward of of doing the work
[37:40] uh your fruitfulness should be the
[37:42] evidence of the work that has been put
[37:44] in God is not going to spend time
[37:47] working on you if there's no fruit to
[37:50] get from the work that he's put
[37:52] in isn't that right when he spoke the
[37:55] world into existence after every day
[37:58] when he had created and done something
[38:01] uh the Bible said it was good and and
[38:04] God and the evening and the morning were
[38:06] the next day and and then he made this
[38:08] and he made that and it was good and and
[38:11] the morning and the evening were the
[38:13] next day and and so on it went on and I
[38:16] believe there's a reason for that
[38:17] because God is not going to just make
[38:18] anything haphazardly or do anything
[38:22] randomly and if he's going to do it it's
[38:24] a good job because he's a good God
[38:28] and whatever he makes is good whatever
[38:30] he does is good whatever he says is good
[38:33] all of nature is a reflection of the
[38:35] goodness of God so after he had made it
[38:38] with all of his Perfection and all that
[38:41] he had poured into it the Bible said he
[38:43] saw that it was good and then and only
[38:46] then it was finished isn't that right
[38:50] and so but there's something to say
[38:51] about fruitfulness you see and and I
[38:54] feel that there's this connection
[38:57] between me fruitfulness and the reward
[39:00] of Labor the reward of doing the work
[39:04] the reward of of getting it done isn't
[39:06] that right putting in the effort putting
[39:09] in the
[39:10] sacrifice putting together all of the
[39:13] skills the raw material that's involved
[39:15] in order to draw something from it it
[39:18] don't make no sense it's a most painful
[39:21] thing to to work uh to labor and to
[39:26] spend time uh and to spend money or
[39:29] resources or whatever it is and not be
[39:32] able to draw fruit from whatever it is
[39:34] that you're
[39:35] doing is the most I think it's the most
[39:38] sad
[39:39] condition a most painful thing to watch
[39:42] somebody work so hard and not get any
[39:46] fruit from after all their work and not
[39:49] be pleased or satisfied with their
[39:52] work men are wired like this we we we
[39:55] need to feel a sense of accomplish ment
[39:58] every day even if it means making up
[40:00] your bed in the morning you need to be
[40:02] able to feel like you did something
[40:03] today in order to lay ahead at night
[40:07] because it would bother you if you did
[40:09] nothing at all today uh and there's
[40:12] nothing to show for a 24-hour span of
[40:15] Life uh you have nothing to show for it
[40:18] and and nothing to account for it and I
[40:20] feel like God feels the same way about
[40:23] the time that is spent because time is
[40:25] not forever and and he uses time to
[40:28] fulfill his purpose he uses time to
[40:31] fulfill his word and even God knows time
[40:34] is not forever is just for a time and so
[40:38] he has to use that time in order to
[40:39] fulfill his word and his purpose and
[40:41] what he's trying to achieve and all of
[40:44] us are underg governed under time and we
[40:47] have to use the time we have that that's
[40:49] given to us in the wisest way so that we
[40:53] could actually bring forth fruit and
[40:56] this fruitfulness tonight is connected
[41:00] to
[41:01] reproduction is connected to
[41:05] reproducing if you understand what I'm
[41:06] saying in other words in the
[41:09] fruitfulness there is the secret of
[41:11] reproduction happening and taking forth
[41:13] in other words God has a desire to
[41:16] reproduce
[41:18] himself and he can't reproduce himself
[41:20] in an in a an environment that is
[41:23] stagnant or an environment that is not
[41:25] moving or static or where there's no
[41:28] process taking place for that
[41:29] reproduction God wants to make more of
[41:32] himself he wants to see more of himself
[41:35] unfolding in nature condescending in
[41:38] true nature and through the reflections
[41:41] of himself through man and through
[41:44] everything else that he has created and
[41:46] so therefore he created a process a a
[41:49] cyclical process of birth and death and
[41:52] reproduction so that things can go on
[41:54] and to produce itself because he wants
[41:57] to see more of himself unfold as time
[42:00] goes on and so he loves fruitfulness
[42:04] because it gives him the opportunity to
[42:06] reproduce himself isn't that right isn't
[42:10] that right and I wanted to preface this
[42:12] thought tonight that I
[42:13] have amen isn't that right and uh so
[42:16] when we get to the top of the tree there
[42:17] has to be a process to get to that
[42:19] harvest in order to obtain that reward
[42:23] there's a process that gets to that
[42:25] point where we can actually claim the
[42:26] fruit that is up there that's right uh
[42:29] it doesn't just beam out of the sky it
[42:32] didn't just happen you know it went
[42:35] through a process we live in a world
[42:37] today where we we we I don't think we
[42:39] really appreciate the process that it
[42:42] takes to get things you know um like I
[42:45] was speaking to a brother um you know
[42:48] and and and he had grown up long time
[42:51] ago and uh he was talking about how that
[42:54] uh you know clothes was so hard to come
[42:58] by you had something called your Sunday
[43:00] Best which you would wear um and then he
[43:03] said he grewed up in a a family with
[43:06] other brothers and they had one shirt
[43:09] and one pants a good shirt it was the
[43:12] best pants and that shirt and pants were
[43:15] shared among many brothers along with
[43:19] himself so that what he would do is when
[43:21] he didn't have the shirt and pants on he
[43:23] would have to put on something called a
[43:24] kazak I know nothing about this
[43:28] but apparently it's a flower bag that is
[43:30] tacked together in a most crude way um
[43:33] that that serves as a temporary form of
[43:35] dress uh until you could acquire this
[43:38] good shirt and pants that you could use
[43:40] to go out the road with uh uh and so he
[43:43] would have to wait for his brother to
[43:44] come back uh with the good shirt and
[43:48] with the good pants so that he could Now
[43:50] put on the same shirt and the same pants
[43:53] and go out and that's how it was I mean
[43:56] now you could go to the store and and
[43:58] get a shirt for $100 or buy a a trouser
[44:01] for one something get it cheap at the
[44:04] Chinese shop but to get that product
[44:07] took
[44:08] time somebody or something sold that
[44:12] thing together somebody spent time
[44:14] stitching it together they tested the
[44:16] product to make sure it was ready for
[44:19] you to wear but the problem is things
[44:21] are so mass-produced nowadays that you
[44:24] don't get to really appreciate that
[44:25] there's a process behind things the cell
[44:29] phone in your pocket was tested somebody
[44:32] turn it on they put all the parts
[44:33] together wherever they got it from China
[44:35] and Taiwan and different places they put
[44:37] it all together assembled all the parts
[44:40] tested the hard drive to make sure it
[44:42] worked run the battery once run this
[44:45] once run that once before you could even
[44:46] purchase it at the store but you are not
[44:49] aware of all of these processes and so
[44:52] when you take out your money to pay for
[44:54] an item now it goes over your head how
[44:56] much processes it took to get to this
[44:59] product to get on the Shelf whether it's
[45:01] a can of beans or a pack of tomato
[45:03] ketchup or whatever it is things are so
[45:05] easily mass-produced and so being thrown
[45:08] around you know and just like easy to
[45:10] acquire it seems whereas a long time ago
[45:12] people would have to uh plant a tree and
[45:15] and and wait for the fruit to come where
[45:17] they would have to take care of cows and
[45:19] and and get the milk from the cow in
[45:21] order to have something to drink where
[45:23] people have to take care of chickens in
[45:24] order to have the eggs so that they
[45:26] could have breakfast that morning people
[45:28] just go down to the Chinese store and
[45:30] just buy whatever they want for a dollar
[45:32] and come back and they don't appreciate
[45:34] that there's a process that it takes to
[45:36] get it on the
[45:38] Shelf but God's process of things have
[45:41] never changed throughout the years
[45:43] regardless of how technology and how
[45:45] things have advanced and moved ahead of
[45:48] its time in science and education and
[45:51] Technology God has certain processes God
[45:54] has certain processes in place in order
[45:57] to bring Sons into character in order to
[46:00] bring men and women in shape for a
[46:02] Revival he has a process for that it
[46:05] takes prayer it takes supplication it
[46:08] takes sanctification it takes getting
[46:10] close to God it takes a relationship it
[46:13] takes a everyday beating the road it
[46:15] takes a a planting it takes a sewing
[46:19] they that sewing chairs shall reap in
[46:21] Joy those rules have not changed no
[46:24] matter how much Society has changed no
[46:27] matter how much the world has changed
[46:29] and the way to acquire things have
[46:31] changed God hasn't changed
[46:34] tonight and his word is still the same
[46:37] and what he's asking of us is for a
[46:39] sacrifice
[46:41] Hallelujah to go through a process
[46:43] Hallelujah so that you could come out on
[46:45] the
[46:46] Mountaintop so that your worship will be
[46:49] different so that when you sing them
[46:51] songs you will sing it with a depth of
[46:54] reality and understanding that for every
[46:56] Every Mountain he brought you over
[46:59] there's something to give God praise for
[47:01] for every Valley he brought you through
[47:04] tears of revelation will stream down
[47:07] your eyes because you will know that he
[47:10] brought you through it oh hallelujah
[47:13] hallelujah you've got a testimony you're
[47:16] not just singing a song you're not just
[47:18] reading the Bible but it's alive to you
[47:20] because you see him in your walk you see
[47:23] him in your talk he's in the midst of
[47:25] your process oh oh Hallelujah he passed
[47:28] you through the valley of Baker
[47:30] hallelujah hallelujah Hal he passed you
[47:32] through certain things to get you closer
[47:35] to the master to make you understand
[47:38] that to get you to where you need to
[47:41] be you need to go through a
[47:44] process to appreciate the Harvest in the
[47:48] end Hallelujah to appreciate the fruit
[47:50] in the end and
[47:53] moreover like we we saying tonight your
[47:56] fruit shall remain M amen God doesn't
[47:58] just want you to bring forth fruit and
[48:00] then that's it no you continue to bring
[48:02] forth fruit continue to burd continue to
[48:05] Blossom no season come season go your
[48:08] fruit is going to remain that is the
[48:11] condition we're going to actually come
[48:13] into at the end of this process tonight
[48:16] amen so I want us to appreciate that now
[48:19] uh and and understand that God has a way
[48:22] of doing things amen uh you know and
[48:24] it's it's uh brother overo f is God's a
[48:27] school of character
[48:29] development uh it's not a school that uh
[48:32] you can uh pay money to get into um
[48:35] there's no physical building God just
[48:36] takes you by the hand and says walk with
[48:39] me and be therefore perfect he he takes
[48:42] you every single day uh uh uh through
[48:46] every Mountain through every experience
[48:48] and you just have to trust and know that
[48:50] he's at the end of all of this you're
[48:53] going to come out right you just have to
[48:55] trust and know because because because
[48:57] he's going to take you to places you
[48:58] don't want to go he's going to take you
[49:01] to places that don't seem Pleasant at
[49:03] all but you just have to trust that
[49:05] whoever is leading you is going to take
[49:07] you through
[49:08] it and we know that God is a good god
[49:12] tonight whatever he takes us through is
[49:15] for all
[49:16] good isn't that right so I wanted to
[49:19] preface this thought tonight with this
[49:20] with this quote from the prophet from a
[49:22] guide Hallelujah and he said that the
[49:24] holy spirit always speaks of the word he
[49:26] said I've got many things to tell you
[49:29] you cannot understand it now am but when
[49:32] he comes he'll guide you to it that's
[49:36] the reason for the coming of the seals
[49:39] at the finishing of the seven seal the
[49:42] Myster of God should be finished amen
[49:45] for what for to know who God is what he
[49:49] is how he lives his nature and his being
[49:55] let's say that one more time the purpose
[49:57] at the end of the mystery of God should
[49:58] be finished at the finishing of the
[50:00] seventh seal he we should know who God
[50:02] is what he is how he lives his nature
[50:08] and his
[50:09] being Prophet said you're supposed to be
[50:12] all the way up there at that by that
[50:14] time see bringing us into the full
[50:18] stature of Sons and Daughters of God a
[50:22] church that is washed in the blood of
[50:24] Christ that's bought without money
[50:27] and is paid for by the blood of Jesus
[50:30] Christ isn't that
[50:32] right
[50:35] so during this process at the end of it
[50:39] we are supposed to know who God is what
[50:42] he is isn't that right and God sent us a
[50:45] prophet to reveal every mystery so that
[50:48] we could know who God is and what he is
[50:51] isn't that right to know that he God is
[50:53] a spirit and they that worship Him must
[50:56] worship Him in spirit and in truth isn't
[50:58] that right that he has a purpose that he
[51:01] has a desire something he's trying to
[51:04] achieve one purpose in doing it isn't
[51:06] that right Hallelujah that mystery that
[51:09] was hid from ages and generations is now
[51:12] being revealed which is Christ in you
[51:15] the hope of glory to know his nature to
[51:18] know his being second Peter 1 4-7 faith
[51:23] and virtue and and knowledge and
[51:25] temperance know the seven part nature of
[51:28] God so that tonight we can be brought
[51:31] into the full
[51:32] manifestation of Sons and Daughters of
[51:34] God in the last days isn't that right
[51:37] that's the purpose of it so so God wants
[51:40] us to be fruitful
[51:42] tonight he wouldn't go through all the
[51:44] trouble of bringing us out and
[51:47] establishing us if we weren't fruitful
[51:50] because in there is how he will
[51:52] reproduce himself in there is how he
[51:55] will make more like him make more Sons
[51:59] like like like how he had in in the in
[52:00] the Garden of Eden isn't that right
[52:03] Hallelujah and and and so on
[52:05] so and so if we're
[52:08] not yeah so God wants us to be fruitful
[52:11] he wouldn't go through all the trouble
[52:12] right if we're not bringing forth some
[52:14] form of profit or
[52:16] increase there has to be a purpose
[52:19] behind it isn't that right and God will
[52:21] achieve his purpose amen so everything
[52:24] serves a purpose right what purpose is a
[52:28] tree that brings forth no fruit the same
[52:31] is heun and and cut down and uprooted
[52:34] and cast Into the Fire isn't that right
[52:37] amen I never forget that time when dad
[52:38] had planted a tree in the in in the in
[52:41] the middle of the garden and he was so
[52:43] excited because it was supposed to be a
[52:45] lime tree or a lemon tree of some kind
[52:48] and uh we waited and the tree sprung up
[52:51] and looked good and it was blooming and
[52:54] getting into itself but after after the
[52:56] first year there was no fruit after the
[52:58] second year no fruit third year no fruit
[53:02] and at some point he was like here's
[53:04] what this thing is just occupying space
[53:07] let us uproot it and put something else
[53:10] in its place and I was part of the
[53:13] uprooting process which was quite
[53:15] interesting um but but that's the way it
[53:17] is you see you wouldn't you you're
[53:20] putting up space you're making space for
[53:22] this thing you have such great
[53:24] expectations for it and then all of a
[53:27] sudden there's nothing to get from it
[53:30] that's just a great
[53:32] dissatisfaction I could imagine how
[53:34] Jesus felt when when they were passing
[53:36] by that fig tree and he was hungry his
[53:40] stomach was in his hand and he's coming
[53:42] up to the frig tree to get something
[53:44] from it because he is hoping to satisfy
[53:47] his natural hunger he is hoping to
[53:49] satisfy to satisfy something within but
[53:52] the tree has nothing to offer him and
[53:55] the Bible said he cursed the fig tree
[53:57] Hallelujah to the
[53:59] roots by the time they came back the
[54:01] next day it had dried up from the roots
[54:04] and the disciples marveled at this isn't
[54:07] that right praise God Amen Hallelujah
[54:10] and I believe God does these things to
[54:12] show us that God's desire and intent
[54:16] praise God is very clear he wants
[54:18] fruitfulness he wants multiplication he
[54:21] said in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[54:24] in multiplying I will multiply unto thee
[54:27] as the sand that is on the seashore and
[54:30] as the stars that is in the heaven oh
[54:34] you can't count those Stars you can't
[54:36] count the sand so shall thy seed be oh
[54:40] Hallelujah so shall my word be it shall
[54:43] not return void but it shall accomplish
[54:47] and there'll be blessing after blessing
[54:49] fire after fire anointing after
[54:53] anointing oh Hallelujah when God
[54:57] gets us in alignment with the word of
[54:59] God for our day when God is ready to
[55:03] release his Spirit upon us oh HW brother
[55:06] Brandon said what we seen work in a
[55:09] small measure will be in its fullness
[55:12] when that time comes it will be power
[55:15] after power wave after wave of the glory
[55:19] of God hit in the Earth the dead in
[55:22] Christ will rise up oh up will come
[55:25] brother branam
[55:26] up will come Wesley up will come Luther
[55:30] oh what a power is getting ready to
[55:33] strike the church in the last days oh
[55:37] God wants us to be
[55:39] fruitful and
[55:42] multiply oh hallelujah hallelujah
[55:45] hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[55:49] Goden amen amen thank you Lord
[55:52] hallelujah when God created man he
[55:55] commissioned his fruit in in that man
[55:57] isn't that right let's read it Genesis
[56:00] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[56:03] image after our likeness and let them
[56:07] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[56:10] and over the foul of the air and over
[56:11] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[56:14] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[56:17] upon the Earth and so God created man in
[56:21] his own image in the image of God
[56:24] created he him male and Fe female
[56:27] created he them and God blessed them
[56:29] verse 28 and God said unto them be
[56:34] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[56:37] Earth and subdue it oh in other words
[56:40] overcome it overrun it oh hallel with
[56:44] more beings just like yourself you have
[56:47] a commission God spoke to man this isn't
[56:50] flesh man yet but this is that Spirit
[56:53] man that he had created oh Hallelujah
[56:56] hallelujah hallelujah not that flesh man
[56:59] yet not yet Adam flesh man but the
[57:02] spirit man that came before isn't that
[57:05] right amen amen amen hallelujah he told
[57:08] that man be fruitful and multiply and
[57:11] replenish the Earth in other words make
[57:13] more just like yourself Hallelujah Hal
[57:16] isn't that right and the Mystery of how
[57:19] that was to be done was there yet to be
[57:21] unfolded but he still spoke it over it
[57:24] over the being isn't that right over man
[57:26] over the spirit man he spoke it over
[57:29] them he breathed upon them the promise
[57:32] that they were to receive and to
[57:34] reproduce and to do isn't that right oh
[57:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
[57:39] God's word cannot return void he has
[57:42] already spoken it over this man beinging
[57:45] so if tonight we ever get back into the
[57:48] image and likeness of God like what it
[57:51] had in the beginning then we come right
[57:54] back into our commission again
[57:56] to be fruitful and to multiply and to
[58:00] make more like these oh hallelujah
[58:03] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[58:05] that
[58:06] right God objective to bring us back
[58:09] into that condition an image of likeness
[58:12] of God seven spirits that has been
[58:15] released throughout all the Earth to
[58:17] bring us back into that condition isn't
[58:20] that right oh hallelujah hallelujah and
[58:24] I have in here Psalms 1 which is like a
[58:27] blueprint to getting us back into this
[58:30] condition let's read it it says Psalms 1
[58:32] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[58:35] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[58:38] in the way of the Sinners nor sth in the
[58:41] seat of the scornful in other words this
[58:44] man that is walking is walking separate
[58:47] and apart he is cutting himself away
[58:50] from the seat of the scornful away from
[58:52] the way of The Sinner away from the
[58:55] world and their natural progression and
[58:58] pattern of things this man that God is
[59:01] calling tonight is not walking in the
[59:03] Council of the ungodly oh but he is
[59:06] walking in the counsel of God he is
[59:08] walking in the word he is walking in
[59:11] righteousness he is walking in Purity he
[59:15] is walking in love oh hallelujah
[59:18] hallelujah God separated us from our
[59:21] mother's womb God knew who you was way
[59:25] back in your grandfather father's
[59:26] lineage because he was going to call you
[59:28] out and choose you and predestinated you
[59:33] he said you have not chosen me but I
[59:36] have chosen you and ordained you to
[59:39] bring forth fruits and that your fruit
[59:42] shall remain oh hallelujah hallelujah

[1:04:36] Hindu meditation no no we just focusing
[1:04:39] on the word seeing watching what he has
[1:04:41] said and as he we think of him and we as
[1:04:45] we talk about him his presence comes as
[1:04:48] we pray on him and think on him his
[1:04:51] presence comes and Grace himself unfolds
[1:04:53] his own word to you unfold it through

[1:04:58] placed in the body isn't that right oh
[1:05:00] and all these things is for our benefit
[1:05:02] praise God hallelujah we are meditating
[1:05:05] putting aside every other
[1:05:07] distraction day and night that is the
[1:05:10] condition of this man isn't that right
[1:05:12] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:05:15] the rivers of water oh this is where we
[1:05:17] want to get to now God wants to plant us
[1:05:21] this is not a temporary fixation this is
[1:05:24] not just a short stint no no no no God
[1:05:26] wants to plant you God wants to dig a
[1:05:29] hole and put you in it put half of you
[1:05:33] in it take a hole and establish you in
[1:05:36] there and cover it up and mold you up in
[1:05:40] it and let you stay there and abide
[1:05:43] there and find your roots there and
[1:05:46] spread out there and catch yourself oh
[1:05:50] Hallelujah and come into yourself God
[1:05:52] loves when his sons come into themselves
[1:05:55] oh when they begin to get mature when
[1:05:57] they begin to get ripened when they
[1:05:59] begin to come into this original
[1:06:03] condition oh the man that he had
[1:06:10] made amen
[1:06:13] glory amen in Genesis 1 there was no
[1:06:16] mention of Adam it only said the man we
[1:06:20] shall make man in our image man in our
[1:06:22] likeness this is the back part amen but
[1:06:25] about that uh Friday night this is the
[1:06:28] back part the front part is the part you
[1:06:30] see that's the visible tangible things
[1:06:32] that you could appreciate with your eyes
[1:06:34] oh but the back part oh H was the
[1:06:36] original part oh that was the seab bed
[1:06:39] that was a rock bed that was a
[1:06:40] foundation that gave life to what you
[1:06:42] saw on the surface praise God it's only
[1:06:45] because of a deeper mystery a deeper
[1:06:47] truth and when the Breath of God was put
[1:06:50] into that man flesh man then Man became
[1:06:53] a living soul but it was what went into
[1:06:56] that man that made that man who he was
[1:06:59] amen and when he fell out of that
[1:07:01] condition even though there was a flesh
[1:07:02] man there because the spirit was now
[1:07:04] Twisted because it was now bent it could
[1:07:07] not no longer hold the authority that
[1:07:10] was once given to it because something
[1:07:11] was out of place in the back Parts isn't
[1:07:14] that right amen God wants to fix us
[1:07:17] tonight fix our hidden Parts hide in us
[1:07:20] his word that we might not sin against
[1:07:22] him he wants to fix us in our secret
[1:07:24] places tonight tonight oh if we would
[1:07:26] only open the door if we'd only go in
[1:07:29] Beyond the Veil drop the door behind us
[1:07:32] get into our prayer closets and let God
[1:07:34] speak to us oh and work in us and shape
[1:07:38] us and mold us oh Hallelujah and draw us
[1:07:41] closer to him amen and abide in him
[1:07:45] praise God isn't that right amen then we
[1:07:47] could bring forth fruit and our fruit
[1:07:50] will remain isn't that right so a tree
[1:07:53] planted by the rivers of water planted
[1:07:56] situated in a specific location not in
[1:07:59] the middle of nowhere it's not planting
[1:08:02] God is Not planting you um you know by a
[1:08:05] wall somewhere or to make you look good
[1:08:07] by somebody no no he has a purpose for
[1:08:09] doing it uh he had Rivers out of Eden
[1:08:13] there were rivers that were coming out
[1:08:16] that was giving life to all the Earth
[1:08:17] and everything else around it Eden was
[1:08:20] specifically uh strategically located by
[1:08:22] a river praise God that they were fruits
[1:08:24] and veget ation and flowers and God is
[1:08:27] very strategic he's purposeful in what
[1:08:30] he's doing and when God says he wants to
[1:08:32] plant this man like a tree near rivers
[1:08:36] of water the purpose is for you to
[1:08:38] always be nourished by the water that is
[1:08:42] coming through doesn't matter what
[1:08:43] seasons come and Seasons go you are
[1:08:46] where the water source is oh Hallelujah
[1:08:49] and your fruits will always be coming in
[1:08:52] oh Hallelujah no matter what Wasa say no
[1:08:55] matter what this one say or that one say
[1:08:57] whether the government put in
[1:08:59] infrastructure or not you don't have
[1:09:00] nothing to do with that you are
[1:09:02] strategically plac by the rivers of
[1:09:05] water oh Hallelujah not a drain not a
[1:09:10] faucet but Rivers oh hallelujah
[1:09:14] hallelujah isn't that right we don't
[1:09:16] have enough Rivers here in Trinidad for
[1:09:18] us to describe what a river really looks
[1:09:20] like some of us still thinking about the
[1:09:22] drain being back of our house that's not
[1:09:25] what talking about we're talking about
[1:09:26] rivers bodies of water going down praise
[1:09:29] God Unstoppable pray isn't that right
[1:09:32] Mangrove and giving life to every type
[1:09:34] of bird and every type of crustation and
[1:09:36] every type of manity in the in the water
[1:09:39] and everything else there's a Riverside
[1:09:41] crocodiles dwell by the Riverside
[1:09:43] looking for things to eat all nature
[1:09:45] even man worshiped the river at one time
[1:09:48] because they thought it was a source of
[1:09:49] life not knowing that it was God that
[1:09:52] created a river that there was a God and
[1:09:54] in charge of all of these things that
[1:09:57] they see around them and that God is
[1:09:59] still here tonight that God hallelujah
[1:10:02] there is a river tonight that flows from
[1:10:05] deep within and if you ever getting
[1:10:07] connected with God out of that rough of
[1:10:10] your belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:10:14] Water oh you're going to be connected to

[1:10:46] to bring forth fruit in his season
[1:10:49] because you're connected to the Water
[1:10:50] Source isn't that right you're where
[1:10:53] right where he needs it to be
[1:10:56] amen and it's just only a matter of time
[1:10:59] until his word is fulfilled isn't that
[1:11:01] right okay well I think we've got it
[1:11:03] here amen wonderful so St John 7 and
[1:11:06] 37 Jesus says in this scripture here and
[1:11:10] the last day in that great day of the
[1:11:12] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[1:11:15] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:11:17] drink and he that believeth on me as the
[1:11:20] scripture said out of his belly shall
[1:11:23] flow Rivers of living water and then the
[1:11:27] Bible goes on to say in verse 39 but
[1:11:31] this spake he of the spirit which they
[1:11:34] had yet they they they that believe on
[1:11:36] him should Reed for the Holy Ghost was
[1:11:40] not yet given oh so this was a prophecy
[1:11:44] of this rivers of Living Water to come
[1:11:46] out of you this was a prophecy of the
[1:11:48] Holy Ghost doing a work in the
[1:11:51] individual but it was not yet given even
[1:11:54] though it was not yet given
[1:11:56] Jesus still spoke it over them oh that
[1:11:59] if any man believe on me as the
[1:12:02] scripture had said then out of his belly
[1:12:06] out of the depth of him oh shall flow
[1:12:09] rivers of Living Water oh hallelujah
[1:12:14] hallelujah hallelujah oh John went up to
[1:12:17] that angel and he took the scroll and he
[1:12:20] ate it and in his mouth it was sweet as
[1:12:22] honey but when it D down into the belly
[1:12:25] it was bitter it was bitter he had to
[1:12:28] digest it he had to go through a stage
[1:12:30] of baress oh th must prophesy again

[1:12:36] going to flow rivers rivers of Living
[1:12:39] Water oh hallelujah hallelujah oh

[1:17:53] only thing we know tonight is the word

[1:17:58] anybody says the days of Miracles has
[1:18:00] passed that fate only knows the word
[1:18:03] somebody says there's no such thing as a
[1:18:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost that Faith
[1:18:07] only knows the word oh God said I'm
[1:18:10] going to receive the Holy Ghost and if
[1:18:12] God said it I believe it that Faith only

[1:18:28] the word that's the reason I came out
[1:18:31] tonight that's the reason I put on my
[1:18:33] shoes because my faith only recognizes
[1:18:36] the word it doesn't recognize how I feel
[1:18:39] doesn't recognize the infirmities in my
[1:18:41] body oh count it all as not oh

[1:19:20] right it only knows the word oh give us
[1:19:24] that real spiritual fith tonight amen
[1:19:27] amen how this is that right he says then
[1:19:29] that was number one he said number one
[1:19:32] coming to you your mental fate right
[1:19:34] here coming to your mental fate comes
[1:19:36] the Holy Ghost down into your mental
[1:19:39] fate making it a spiritual fith and then
[1:19:42] the spiritual Faith only recognizes that
[1:19:44] word and he said now on number two uh
[1:19:47] three he said then you'll have uh
[1:19:50] spiritual you'll have the Holy Spirit he
[1:19:52] said and will'll seal all these things
[1:19:55] into you oh seal all these things up
[1:19:58] into you as the Holy Spirit covers this
[1:20:01] he says from Faith all the way up to the
[1:20:04] Holy Spirit he said it seals you in with
[1:20:07] Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[1:20:10] that right that's what we're looking for
[1:20:11] to happen in the last days the Holy
[1:20:14] Spirit itself will come down and seal
[1:20:17] all these virtues up into you isn't from
[1:20:20] Faith all the way up to Holy Spirit he's
[1:20:23] going to seal you up isn't right he said
[1:20:26] and then you become one amen he said get
[1:20:30] this thing out of my way he said you
[1:20:31] become one he said see you and Christ
[1:20:33] live together he said and at that day
[1:20:36] you will know that I am in the father
[1:20:39] and the father in me and I in you and
[1:20:42] you in me see then that is a sealed unit
[1:20:46] of the Lord God and he said now and then
[1:20:49] they are Vindicated and placed that's
[1:20:52] you and I when we come into that uh
[1:20:54] process says we are Vindicated and plac
[1:20:57] and he said when that time takes place
[1:21:00] then they become Vindicated Sons and
[1:21:03] Daughters of God when we go through that
[1:21:05] process amen amen isn't that right oh my
[1:21:10] what a promise Prophet said an
[1:21:11] ordination he said remember Les this
[1:21:13] lesson is morning this morning's lesson
[1:21:15] okay so he comes in the evening service
[1:21:16] now of Blasphemous names and he speaks
[1:21:19] it again just what we read here just now
[1:21:21] he says and remember this morning's
[1:21:22] lesson uh these uh virtues has to be in
[1:21:25] there before the Capstone will ever come
[1:21:28] on it see he said oh you might shout you
[1:21:30] might sing you might speak your tongues
[1:21:32] and dance that has nothing at all to do
[1:21:34] with it he said but until these things
[1:21:37] scripturally proven and are sealed into
[1:21:40] you the Holy Spirit seals you in as an
[1:21:45] individual oh and then you're a son and
[1:21:48] daughter of God isn't that right amen he
[1:21:50] said we've heard people speak with
[1:21:52] tongues that didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:54] he said you know that he said I've heard
[1:21:56] witches speak in tongues he said Witch
[1:21:58] Doctors speak in tongues and drink blood
[1:22:00] out of human skull and call on the devil
[1:22:03] yes sir he said so he say I've seen
[1:22:06] witches Wizards see the time that that
[1:22:08] pencil was laid down and run up and down
[1:22:11] the stove pipe and played a shav and
[1:22:13] hair played that shaven haircut and
[1:22:15] write in unknown tongues somebody made a
[1:22:17] pencil animate isn't that right and a
[1:22:18] guy standing there and just scribble up
[1:22:20] and down and write and tell exactly what
[1:22:22] it was saying and and he said now you
[1:22:24] know that ain't God he said you know all
[1:22:27] those things he said So speaking in
[1:22:29] tongues don't mean that you're of God he
[1:22:31] said working of Miracles don't prove
[1:22:34] that you're of God he said but it's the
[1:22:36] thing the thing the fruits of the spirit
[1:22:40] that proves that you're in God when you
[1:22:43] see that life sealed Away by the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost then that is what proves that you
[1:22:50] are in God oh hallelujah amen so we're
[1:22:54] not looking for speaking in tongues in
[1:22:55] that sense or running up and down no but
[1:22:57] we've got to see that life signs of that
[1:23:00] life being emanating from you oh then
[1:23:03] the fruit will be the evidence that that
[1:23:06] spirit is in you amen isn't that right
[1:23:09] that's what we wanted to get to tonight
[1:23:11] amen being fruitful and multiply that
[1:23:13] our fruits could come in and that fruit
[1:23:16] will be evidence of the spirit of God
[1:23:18] that is working in you amen amen because
[1:23:21] Jesus said by your fruits you're going
[1:23:24] to know them isn't that right oh God let

[1:25:25] tonight oh do you believe it glory to
[1:25:28] God Prophet said on three kinds of
[1:25:30] Believers that's the reason I do believe
[1:25:33] that when the bride is called out and
[1:25:37] elected and set in The Book of Life
[1:25:40] there will come a sound from Heaven that
[1:25:43] will take such a baptism of the Holy
[1:25:46] Spirit into that bride oh that it will
[1:25:49] take her from the earth in a rapturing
[1:25:52] Grace God promise it oh did he promise
[1:25:56] it tonight oh that when that bride is
[1:25:59] called out this is a prophecy oh and I
[1:26:01] believe tonight it's coming into view
[1:26:04] that when that bride is called out when
[1:26:06] she's elected and when she's set in The
[1:26:09] Book of Life there's going to come a
[1:26:12] sound from Heaven that will take such a
[1:26:14] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:26:18] bride that it'll take her up from the
[1:26:20] earth in a rapturing Grace called God
[1:26:24] promis it brother bam said don't care
[1:26:27] how many science how many astronauts
[1:26:30] they signed and everything else how many
[1:26:32] million of miles they can see he said I
[1:26:35] don't care nothing about that he said
[1:26:38] there is a heaven and there is a literal
[1:26:41] Jesus Christ that there will come in a
[1:26:44] body form to receive his church to
[1:26:48] himself no matter how old the story
[1:26:51] seems oh no matter how oldfashioned it's
[1:26:54] still the truth he said God said so and
[1:26:58] that is what Believers believe oh do you
[1:27:02] believe it tonight oh God promis it he
[1:27:05] is the same God that promis it he's big
[1:27:08] enough to keep his promise tonight he's
[1:27:10] big enough to fill you with a glorious
[1:27:14] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:17] Fire oh Hallelujah can we praise him
[1:27:20] tonight Hallelujah God said Hallelujah I
[1:27:24] am the Lord that heals all thy
[1:27:26] diseases I am God and I change not Amen
[1:27:31] brother B says and God is and God is the
[1:27:33] word and if God don't change then how is
[1:27:37] the word going to change he said see he
[1:27:39] said I am God and I change not and the
[1:27:43] scriptures said that and God said it
[1:27:45] himself and if he cannot change then he
[1:27:48] is the word he said in the beginning was
[1:27:51] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:27:54] Word was God the unchangeable word oh
[1:27:58] that word promise your deliverance that
[1:28:01] word promise your breakthrough that word

[1:28:15] dwelt Among Us amen yes sir isn't that
[1:28:19] right glory to God Jesus says here in
[1:28:22] Matthew 7 bew of false prophets which
[1:28:26] come to you in sheep's
[1:28:27] clothing because inwardly they are
[1:28:30] ravening wolves he says he said but you
[1:28:32] shall know them by their fruits he said
[1:28:36] do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs
[1:28:39] or thistles he said even so every good
[1:28:42] tree bringeth forth good fruit he said
[1:28:46] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[1:28:48] fruit a good tree cannot bring forth
[1:28:51] evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[1:28:54] bring forth good fruit and he said every
[1:28:57] tree that bringeth forth not good fruit
[1:28:59] is heun down and cast into the fire oh
[1:29:04] that is the fate of that tree isn't that
[1:29:05] right and Jesus says again here he said
[1:29:08] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[1:29:10] them oh so there's coming a Time friends
[1:29:14] where the fruits is going to come in and

[1:29:20] sheep and the goat is isn't that right
[1:29:22] oh then that will be the separation then
[1:29:25] because the manifestation will be the
[1:29:27] interpretation and the reflection will
[1:29:29] be the Perfection isn't that right by
[1:29:33] your fruits you will know who is who
[1:29:36] when that time comes isn't that right
[1:29:38] it's going to come down to a proven time
