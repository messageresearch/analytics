[31:38] rise above tiredness, to rise above the
[31:41] cares of this world. Uh rise above the
[31:43] sin that so easily beset us. Uh rise
[31:46] above the weights of this world to rise
[31:48] above the distractions of this world.
[31:51] Rise above what the enemy may throw our
[31:54] weight. Rise above what the enemy may
[31:56] try to do. Rise above how we feel. Rise
[32:00] above how we think. Rise above what the
[32:03] doctor might say it. Rise above what the
[32:06] neighbor might say it. Rise above what
[32:08] the government may say. It rise above
[32:10] what our bodies may say. Rise above the
[32:13] temptations. rise above the lust of the
[32:16] eyes and the lust of the flesh and the
[32:19] pride of life to rise above our carnal
[32:21] nature to rise above everything else,
[32:24] Lord, and to be caught into the realms
[32:26] of the heavenlies, Father. Lord, there's
[32:27] no place we'd rather be than in your
[32:30] presence. There's no atmosphere we'd
[32:32] rather be in than in your presence. So,
[32:34] Father, may you lift us up tonight and
[32:37] may you help us to see a fresh picture
[32:39] of Calvary. May you help us to see a
[32:42] fresh picture of your word. May you help
[32:44] us to catch a fresh vic a fresh picture
[32:47] Lord of how you want our families to
[32:49] operate, how you want the church to
[32:51] operate, how you want us to live. Uh we
[32:53] could be in this world but [music] not
[32:55] of this world. Father, may you give us a
[32:57] fresh picture today that we are
[32:59] creatures of eternity trapped in time.
[33:01] That we are just passing through and
[33:03] that we have a responsibility, Lord, to
[33:06] create an atmosphere. Live in that
[33:09] atmosphere, walk in that atmosphere,
[33:12] nurture that atmosphere. We have no time
[33:14] for foolishness. We have no time for
[33:17] depression. We have no time for
[33:19] frustration. We have no time for
[33:21] unbelief. We have no time for
[33:23] negativity. But Lord, we want to hear a
[33:25] word from you tonight, Lord. Because a
[33:27] word from you in due season, how
[33:29] pleasant it is, how wonderful it is, how
[33:31] fresh it is tonight, Father.
[33:34] May you bless everyone that's here in
[33:35] the service tonight. May you bless
[33:37] everyone that's gathered online that's
[33:39] connected. May the same presence we feel
[33:42] tonight, Lord, move [music] through the
[33:44] stream, Lord, into homes. Move through
[33:46] the stream and have an impact in jobs
[33:48] wherever they may be. Whoever is
[33:50] watching the service right now, may the
[33:52] pillar of fire, the presence of God,
[33:55] deity himself make himself known [music]
[33:57] to your people. We commit the service
[33:59] into your hands. May you take me out of
[34:01] the way and [music] speak lip to air to
[34:03] your people. We ask in the precious name
[34:05] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[34:07] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So happy to be here in the house
[34:10] of the Lord tonight. Wednesday nights
[34:13] are always a special service. It takes a
[34:16] greater effort to be here and God
[34:17] blesses that. He rewards that. It's a
[34:20] separation because you have a choice.
[34:21] So, we appreciate uh those of you who
[34:24] have made a choice to be here physically
[34:25] in the church. And those of you who
[34:28] could have been here and are not, you
[34:30] have some work to do. And for those of
[34:32] you who really couldn't be here tonight
[34:34] and you are connected online, we
[34:36] encourage you to take the service as if
[34:38] you are in the service. So, don't be
[34:40] casual about it. Don't be light about
[34:42] it. This is God's business. And when we
[34:44] approach God's business, we want to
[34:46] approach it with the same level of
[34:48] sacredness and respect as if we are in
[34:50] the house of God. So
[34:53] shall we take our Bibles just one
[34:55] portion of scripture tonight reading
[34:57] from Hebrews uh chapter 3 and reading
[35:01] from verse 12.
[35:04] One portion of scripture there tonight.
[35:08] Take heed, brethren,
[35:12] lest there be in any of you an evil
[35:17] heart of unbelief. Now, this is Paul's
[35:20] letter not to the Romans, but to the
[35:23] Hebrews, those who would have grown up
[35:25] in the faith, those would have a certain
[35:26] understanding of the faith. So, he's
[35:28] speaking to them and giving them a
[35:29] warning. He also addresses them as
[35:32] brethren. So, he's not speaking to
[35:33] casual onlookers. He's not speaking to
[35:36] people who are not of the faith. So take
[35:38] heed, brethren, lest there be in any of
[35:41] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[35:44] departing from the living God. But
[35:46] exhort one another daily
[35:49] while it is called today. In other
[35:51] words, while there's an opportunity to
[35:53] do so,
[35:56] lest any of you be hardened through the
[35:59] deceitfulness of sin.
[36:01] For we are made partakers of Christ if
[36:03] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[36:07] steadfast unto the end. So Paul is
[36:10] understanding that everyone who comes
[36:12] into the faith has a beginning has a
[36:14] starting point. But the challenge in the
[36:17] journey is to hold the beginning of our
[36:21] confidence steadfast unto the end. When
[36:24] people come into the faith they come
[36:25] with a steadfastness in the beginning of
[36:27] it. But during the journey it sometimes
[36:29] gets shaky and he's saying be confident
[36:31] and steadfast until the end.
[36:35] While it is said today, if you will hear
[36:37] his voice, harden not your hearts as in
[36:39] the provocation. For some, when they had
[36:42] heard did provoke, how be it, not all
[36:46] that came out of Egypt by Moses? But
[36:49] with whom was he grieved 40 years? Was
[36:51] it not with them that had sinned, whose
[36:53] carcasses fell in the wilderness? And to
[36:56] whom swear he that they should not enter
[36:58] into his rest, but to them that believed
[37:01] not. So we see that they could not enter
[37:04] in because of unbelief. May the Lord add
[37:07] a blessing to the reading of his word.
[37:10] You may be seated
[37:14] for our title tonight for this uh word
[37:19] from the Lord. I want to take a title
[37:22] tonight. Separating
[37:24] the true believers from the church
[37:27] members.
[37:28] Separating the true believers from the
[37:32] church members. And we know that the
[37:35] prophet taught us that in every church,
[37:37] not some churches, but in every church
[37:40] there are three kinds of believers. Are
[37:43] we together? In every church there are
[37:45] three kinds of believers. There are
[37:46] unbelievers. And that's a somewhat of a
[37:48] paradox to think that in the church they
[37:50] are unbelievers in the church. They are
[37:53] make believers in the church very good
[37:55] actors. So they do almost everything
[37:57] right that you would believe that they
[37:59] are believers because they are make
[38:01] believers. The unbelievers they are
[38:03] there in the church but they don't
[38:04] believe. They may not show it and
[38:05] express it and demonstrate it. But deep
[38:08] down the God who looks beyond the facial
[38:10] expression and beyond how they dress and
[38:12] beyond how they may respond to the word
[38:13] knows that there's unbelief in there. So
[38:16] there's unbelievers, there are make
[38:18] believers, and then there are the true
[38:19] believers. And there has to come a point
[38:21] where there's a separation of that one
[38:24] category of true believers from the rest
[38:26] that are just church members. So the
[38:28] unbeliever and the makebeliever, THEY
[38:30] ARE IN THE CHURCH. But God is not
[38:32] calling church members. He's not calling
[38:33] the unbelievers. He's not calling the
[38:35] makebelievers. He's looking for the
[38:37] individuals who are the true believers
[38:39] because God could only prove his word by
[38:42] true believers. So we are happy tonight
[38:44] to be identifying with true believers
[38:46] because true believers want all the
[38:48] word. True believers eat all the word.
[38:50] True believers are hungry for the word.
[38:53] When the true believer sees a buffet of
[38:55] the word, they want to take everything.
[38:56] They are not being selective and take
[38:58] this thing or that thing alone. They
[39:00] want to take all of it. So they're
[39:01] taking healing. They're taking
[39:02] correction. THEY'RE NOT JUST TAKING THE
[39:04] POSITIVE AND SAY, "I'M LOOKING TO BE
[39:06] BLESSED," BUT THEY want the word of
[39:07] correction to take the root of
[39:09] bitterness out of their heart, TO TAKE
[39:11] THE ENVY OUT OF THEIR HEART, TO TAKE THE
[39:13] JEALOUSY OUT OF THEIR HEART, TO FIX THE
[39:15] ISSUES IN THE HOME, TO RESTORE THE
[39:17] PRAYER ALTAR IN THE HOME, TO TO OPERATE
[39:20] A CERTAIN WAY IN THE JOB, TO MAKE THE
[39:22] WRONGS RIGHT, AND TO FORGIVE YOUR
[39:25] BROTHER, AND TO DROP YOURS, AND TO
[39:27] CHANGE YOUR WAYS, AND TO NOT JUST KNOW
[39:29] THE WORD, BUT LIVE the word. Oh,
[39:31] somebody preached back to me this
[39:33] evening.
[39:35] Hallelujah. There are many who know the
[39:37] message. It's a whole another thing to
[39:39] live the message, friends. But the true
[39:41] believers are those who put the word
[39:42] INTO PRACTICE. THEY PUT the word into
[39:44] action. They worship when they don't
[39:46] feel like worshiping BECAUSE THEY
[39:48] BELIEVE THAT THEY are born to be
[39:49] worshippers. Oh, somebody help me
[39:51] tonight. THEY COME TO CHURCH BECAUSE
[39:52] THEY BELIEVE THAT CHURCH IS A PLACE TO
[39:54] BE. AND THEY FORSAKE NOT THE ASSEMBLING
[39:57] OF THEMSELVES TOGETHER EVEN AS THE DAY
[39:59] APPROACHES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A TRUE
[40:00] BELIEVER IS. A true believer is not
[40:03] PUTTING ON A SHOW LIKE THE BIG BELIEVER.
[40:05] THEY'RE NOT THERE TO IMPRESS ANYBODY BUT
[40:07] THEY ARE TRUE BELIEVER IF NOBODY ELSE IS
[40:09] STANDING. THEY ARE TRUE BELIEVER AND GOD
[40:12] is about to separate the true believers
[40:14] from the church members. There has got
[40:17] to be a separation. I'm not doing the
[40:19] separation. The pastor is not doing the
[40:21] separation but God himself is doing the
[40:24] separation. Sometime the church say
[40:25] amen.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm feeling good tonight. God is
[40:32] going to have a witness. HE'S GOING TO
[40:34] HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S going to break out
[40:36] of the humanistic realm. HE'S GOING TO
[40:37] HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO BREAK into
[40:39] the realm of divine revelation, break
[40:42] into vision and see who they ARE IN GOD.
[40:45] UH THAT PICTURE OF GOD THAT THAT GOD HAS
[40:48] ABOUT YOU, ONCE YOU CATCH IT, THEN
[40:49] EVERYTHING ELSE IS A DISTRACTION.
[40:51] EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOTHING. EVERYTHING
[40:53] ELSE HAS NO VALUE WHEN YOU SEE WHO GOD
[40:56] SAYS YOU ARE. BECAUSE WHEN GOD LOOKS AT
[40:58] YOU, HE SEES YOU IN A CONDITION HOW HE
[41:00] FORMED YOU, HOW HE SHAPED YOU. NOT THE
[41:03] PRODUCT OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT, NOT THE
[41:05] PRODUCT OF YOUR HOME, NOT THE PRODUCT OF
[41:07] YOUR MISTAKES, NOT THE PRODUCT OF YOUR
[41:09] FAILURES. BUT BEFORE THERE WAS A WORLD,
[41:11] BEFORE THERE WAS A MOLECULE, BEFORE
[41:13] THERE WAS A PROBLEM, YOU WERE IN GOD.
[41:16] YOU ROTATED OFF OF GOD. AND GOD HAS NOT
[41:18] FORGOTTEN YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE PART OF
[41:20] HIM. CAN THE church say amen?
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, HALLELUJAH.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; GLORY to God.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You in your home, you
[41:31] worship. Hallelujah. If you're in your
[41:33] job, you worship. We are born to
[41:35] worship. We are creatures created to
[41:37] worship. THERE ARE SONGS THAT THE ANGELS
[41:39] CANNOT SING. OH, HALLELUJAH. THERE'S AN
[41:42] EXPRESSION THAT THE ANGELS COULD ANGELS
[41:44] COULD NEVER WORSHIP LIKE YOU. THEY DON'T
[41:46] KNOW WHAT IT IS TO SING THE SONGS OF
[41:48] AMAZING GRACE. HOW SWEET A SOUND THAT
[41:51] SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME. I ONCE WAS LOST
[41:53] BUT NOW [screaming] I'M FOUND. WAS BLIND
[41:56] BUT NOW I SEE.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:01] HALLELUJAH.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Born to worship. True believers who
[42:06] could stand alone. That's a challenge
[42:08] today. People can't stand alone. We are
[42:11] social creatures. So people are looking
[42:12] to see who else is doing this and who
[42:14] else is doing this and who else is doing
[42:16] this. But the true believer just hears a
[42:18] word from the Lord. And if nobody else
[42:20] is moving, they move. Uh if NOBODY ELSE
[42:22] IS RESPONDING, they respond. Uh if the
[42:24] word is speaking to you, it has nothing
[42:26] to do with anybody else. YOU ARE FULLY
[42:28] PERSUADED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A TRUE
[42:29] BELIEVER IS. YOU BELIEVE ALL OF THE
[42:32] WORD. HALLELUJAH. MAY LORD, MAY THE LORD
[42:34] ELEVATE US TONIGHT TO BE TRUE BELIEVERS.
[42:37] IF IT CUTS ME, I STILL BELIEVE. IF I
[42:39] LOSE FRIENDS, I STILL BELIEVE. IF I LOSE
[42:42] REPUTATION, I STILL BELIEVE BECAUSE
[42:44] THAT'S WHAT A TRUE BELIEVER IS. Can the
[42:46] church say amen?
[42:49] &gt;&gt; So I want to lay a few quotes and a few
[42:51] things before I get to part of the
[42:52] thought from the message of unity of one
[42:54] God in the one church. But the working
[42:57] of the Holy Spirit, the kingdom of God
[43:00] in you, God sets on the throne of your
[43:03] heart in his control room. You see how
[43:05] BROTHER BRANDON DESCRIBES IT? HIS
[43:07] control room. It's not your control
[43:09] room. It's his control room. That
[43:11] control SEAT IN YOUR HEART doesn't
[43:13] belong to you.
[43:16] It's not your control room. It's his
[43:17] control room. YOU SOMETIMES HAVE ALL
[43:20] KIND OF THINGS INSIDE THERE CONTROLLING
[43:21] YOU. BUT GOD IS LOOKING to take the seat
[43:24] on his control room SO HE COULD DRIVE
[43:26] your car. He could move your handshake
[43:31] control of your lips. The things that
[43:33] YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO NOT
[43:35] SAY, WHEN HE SITS THERE, YOU WILL HAVE
[43:36] NO TROUBLE NO MORE BECAUSE HE'S IN THE
[43:38] CONTROL ROOM. AMEN.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; You want to hear how the prophet
[43:42] continues that controlling your
[43:44] emotions.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; You you hear that?
[43:49] &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER PAPA, GOD WANTS to control
[43:51] your emotions.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; You have people who say, "I'M AN
[43:54] EMOTIONAL PERSON. THAT'S WHY I ACT IN
[43:56] THIS WAY." And God is saying when when I
[43:59] SIT ON THE THRONE, I TAKE CONTROL OF
[44:01] YOUR EMOTIONS.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Because a leader doesn't panic. A LEADER
[44:05] DOESN'T GET FRUSTRATED AND UPSET. A
[44:07] LEADER STANDS HIS GROUND BECAUSE HE
[44:08] KNOWS WHAT GROUND HE'S STANDING ON. YOU
[44:10] think God panic when man fell? You think
[44:12] God PANIC WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND THAT
[44:14] HAPPENED?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; The disciples screaming IN THE BOAT,
[44:20] "MASTER, SAVE US." JESUS WIPED HIS EYES.
[44:23] He say, "You of little faith. Peace be
[44:26] still."
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Imagine if Jesus was panicking with
[44:28] them. He couldn't get emotional. But
[44:30] faith, true belief, understands that God
[44:32] is in control. The Lord gives, the Lord
[44:35] take it away. Everything I have come
[44:37] FROM GOD. WHY PANIC IF I'M losing
[44:39] something? It didn't come from God.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; If the Lord give you and he can take
[44:43] away, why you panic?
[44:45] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said worrying is a
[44:47] sin. We worrying about things we cannot
[44:48] control. GOD GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU don't
[44:50] think he could preserve it? AND IF GOD
[44:52] ALLOWS something to be removed from you,
[44:54] don't you think he can give US SOMETHING
[44:55] BETTER THAN WHAT HE HAD BEFORE? BECAUSE
[44:57] JOB GOT DOUBLE FOR HIS TROUBLE. OH, COME
[44:59] ON NOW. ALL THE PROBLEMS JOB HAD, GOD
[45:02] ALREADY HAD A TRANSFER WAITING TO GIVE
[45:04] HIM FOR STANDING THE TEST OF TIME. YOU
[45:06] DIDN'T THINK GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH IN YOUR
[45:08] BANK ACCOUNT, WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
[45:10] THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR HOME, THE PROBLEMS
[45:12] IN YOUR FAMILY, THE GOD WHO PUT YOU HERE
[45:15] IS MORE THAN ABLE TO PRESERVE YOU. TO HE
[45:17] WHO STARTED THE WORK IN YOU IS MORE THAN
[45:19] ABLE TO BRING IT TO PASS.
[45:23] But it's to get him tonight,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[45:25] &gt;&gt; to sit
[45:27] &gt;&gt; in the control room.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; And I hope I could get save it where by
[45:30] the man I'm talking about. But the true
[45:32] believer is truly trusting in God.
[45:35] That's what belief is.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; People worrying about this, stressing
[45:39] about this. I'm guilty. We all guilty
[45:42] &gt;&gt; because OUR NATURE IS TO TRY TO FIX
[45:44] THINGS.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; When something goes wrong, your nature
[45:47] is not to sit down and say, "Let it go
[45:49] wrong." Your nature is say, "What can I
[45:51] do? What can I do better? What can I do
[45:52] different? AND THAT'S FINE. BUT DON'T
[45:55] LET THAT REPLACE YOUR TRUST IN GOD.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THAT REPLACE YOUR FAITH IN
[46:00] GOD. DON'T LET THAT CHANGE THE WORDS
[46:02] THAT COME OUT YOUR MOUTH. BECAUSE AS A
[46:04] FAITHBASED CREATURE, OH, come on now. AS
[46:06] A FAITH-BASED CREATURE, ONLY FAITH
[46:09] SHOULD COME OUT FROM YOUR MOUTH.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW DARK IT LOOKS. I DON'T
[46:13] CARE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. I DON'T CARE
[46:15] WHAT THE BANK SAYS. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[46:16] THE BOSS SAYS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IF GOD
[46:19] SPEAKS, THAT SETTLES IT. IF HE SAYS
[46:21] YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE HOLY GHOST, I I
[46:22] DON'T CARE WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR
[46:24] LIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND YOU'RE
[46:25] going to get THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH.
[46:27] HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTED, YOU
[46:29] MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, you're going
[46:31] to be adopted. If he promised you your
[46:33] children, I don't care where they are
[46:34] tonight, THEY HAVE GOT TO COME BECAUSE I
[46:36] HAVE PROMISES unto you and TO YOUR
[46:38] CHILDREN. GOD IS GOING TO RAISE YOUR
[46:40] FAITH FOR YOUR HOUSE. AND YOU CAN SPEAK
[46:43] LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS FOR ME AND MY
[46:45] HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD." Can the
[46:48] church say, "Amen."
[46:49] Somebody give God a shout of praise
[46:51] tonight.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's the problem with
[46:58] many of us. We are too much in control.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; And when we are in control, God cannot
[47:04] be in control. But when you let go of
[47:06] the wheel and you let go of the wheel of
[47:08] your life and and [laughter] you want to
[47:09] do this and you want to and let God take
[47:11] control, you'll see how smooth the ride
[47:13] is GOING TO BE. HALLELUJAH. YOU NOT A
[47:16] PILOT. YOU ARE TO FLY THE PLANE OF YOUR
[47:18] LIFE. But if you have a good pilot who
[47:21] understand where the turbulence is,
[47:23] sometimes you're in a plane and the
[47:24] pilot say I'm going to go a little
[47:25] higher because there's some turbulence
[47:26] up ahead. And if you go higher, I'll fly
[47:28] above the turbulence. Hallelujah. The
[47:30] God we serve could fly above the
[47:32] turbulence. He could take you through
[47:34] the storm. HE COULD HE COULD TAKE YOU
[47:35] THROUGH THE HURRICANE. HE COULD PROTECT
[47:37] YOUR HOUSE. HE COULD PROTECT YOUR HOME.
[47:39] THOUGH 10,000 FALL ON THIS SIDE, HE
[47:41] KNOWS HOW TO CARRY YOU THROUGH. OH, CAN
[47:43] WE GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:50] &gt;&gt; We're still in that quote. Controlling
[47:53] your emotions. This is the prophet
[47:55] speaking. Controlling your powers.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Controlling your conceptions, your
[48:01] ideas. Sometime your ideas running wild.
[48:03] You're thinking about this. You're
[48:04] thinking about that. You want to do
[48:05] this. You want to do that. AND WHAT? BUT
[48:07] WHEN HE SITS IN A CONTROL TOWER, HE IS A
[48:09] STABILIZING FORCE
[48:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY DO HIS WILL. AND
[48:13] HE CAN ONLY GUIDE YOU IN HIS WILL. YOU
[48:15] FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY AT PEACE AND AT
[48:17] REST BECAUSE HE IS IN THE CONTROL TOWER
[48:19] AND YOU ARE BLESSED BECAUSE YOU'RE IN
[48:21] HIS WAY. BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH
[48:23] NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNGODLY OR
[48:25] STAND IN THE WAY OF THE SINNER OR SIT IN
[48:27] THE SEAT OF THE SCORNFUL BECAUSE ALL OF
[48:29] A SUDDEN THERE'S THE MASTER OF THE WIND
[48:32] IN THE CONTROL TOWER OF THE HEART AND
[48:34] HE'S DIRECTING YOU GO HERE. DON'T GO
[48:36] HERE. STOP HERE. DO THIS. DROP YOUR SAY
[48:39] THAT BETTER. GO AND APOLOGIZE. GO FIX
[48:41] THIS. GO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND ALL THE
[48:43] GUILT YOU FEEL AND THE SHAME YOU FEEL
[48:45] BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR BECAUSE HE'S THERE
[48:47] TO HELP YOU. HE'S THERE TO BUILD YOU UP.
[48:49] HE'S THERE TO HELP DEVELOP THE CHARACTER
[48:51] IN YOU. THE SEED IN YOU COULD ONLY BRING
[48:54] FORTH AFTER ITS KIND. AND THE HOLY GHOST
[48:56] SEED IN YOU COULD ONLY BRING FORTH A
[48:59] LIVING FAITH, A LIVING GLORY, A LIVING
[49:01] POWER, FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT, STATURE OF
[49:03] A PERFECT MAN. SOMEBODY GIVE God a shout
[49:06] of praise.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause]
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory.
[49:20] We still in that court.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Controlling your conceptions and making
[49:25] you one with him in fellowship and in
[49:28] love. And God fills you with love. He
[49:32] fills you with power. He fills you with
[49:34] the spirit. He fills you with his own
[49:37] divine nature. And he changes your
[49:39] carnal nature into his nature. Then in
[49:42] this you become a new creation in
[49:44] Christ. Believest thou this?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] But the Brandham goes on then the love
[49:51] you God you seemingly the birds sing
[49:53] different
[49:56] &gt;&gt; what you talking your perspective change
[49:57] you know
[49:58] &gt;&gt; because when you were in your atmosphere
[50:00] you know brother but Brandham said
[50:02] somebody came into the car and spoke a
[50:03] blue streak it interrupted his
[50:06] atmosphere it interrupted his
[50:09] environment one time brother Brandham
[50:10] was walking into the hotel room he say I
[50:12] can't go in this room because
[50:13] fornication just took place in this room
[50:16] &gt;&gt; he is protecting thing his environment.
[50:18] [clears throat] HE DON'T WANT TO SPEND
[50:19] TIME WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE. He's in an
[50:21] atmosphere. He's in a bubble. He could
[50:23] walk the street and he could preserve
[50:25] the atmosphere.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. Nothing
[50:29] bothers you anymore.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; You're at peace. You're at rest. You're
[50:33] you're YOU'RE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN WHO
[50:36] YOU ARE IN THE LORD. YOU COULD WALK THE
[50:37] STREET AND nothing moves you. People
[50:39] having and you IN YOUR YOU IN YOUR OWN
[50:41] WORLD. WHAT WORLD? YOU'RE IN HEAVENLY
[50:42] PLACES.
[50:45] JOHN WAS IN THE AISLE OF PATMOS. HE
[50:46] DIDN'T CHANGE HIS PHYSICAL LOCATION, BUT
[50:48] IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM, HE WAS CALLED
[50:50] COME HIGHER. HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE COULD
[50:53] HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM ALL AROUND. THEY
[50:54] THINK HE'S THERE, BUT HE'S CAUGHT UP IN
[50:56] THE HEAVENLIES, SEEING WHAT THEY CANNOT
[50:58] SEE, EXPERIENCING WHAT THEY CANNOT
[51:00] EXPERIENCE. AND YOU IN YOUR HOME
[51:02] TONIGHT, YOU IN HERE TONIGHT CAN BE
[51:04] CAUGHT UP IN THE HEAVENLY REALM AND SEE
[51:06] WHAT OTHERS cannot see BECAUSE YOU HAVE
[51:08] SPIRITUAL EYESIGHT TO ENTER INTO the
[51:11] realm of the heavenlies. Can the church
[51:13] give the Lord a shout of praise?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on how different
[51:19] IT IS WHEN CHRIST COME.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU LOOK BACK AND THINK HOW DID
[51:24] I EVER stay away from it? How did I ever
[51:27] reject it? Everything is different. But
[51:29] the man said you have no enemies. Oh
[51:31] Lord help us.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; You have no enemies.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; They all look sweet.
[51:41] This is good thing tonight you know
[51:44] &gt;&gt; because if you I know I know there are
[51:46] people you have issues with and you
[51:48] struggle to look at them a certain way
[51:50] but when that when that master of the
[51:53] winners is in the control tower all of
[51:55] your enemies suddenly become you say you
[51:57] have no enemies when people say I
[52:00] thought you don't talk to so and so no I
[52:02] I [laughter] have no issue I I have no
[52:04] enemies how is it they're looking sweet
[52:06] I reading the word here you know this is
[52:08] what the prophet say they're looking
[52:09] sweet I used to look AT THEM AWAY BUT
[52:11] SOMETHING CHANGED AND THE SAME BROTHER I
[52:13] COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. I COULDN'T FIGURE
[52:14] OUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM I JUST SEEN
[52:16] SWEETNESS. WHAT IS IT? THE CONTROL
[52:17] TOWER. SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE.
[52:19] [screaming] IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S THE HOLY
[52:21] GHOST.
[52:24] HALLELUJAH.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE DOING? CHANGING YOUR
[52:27] THINKING, CHANGING WHAT YOU LOOK AT,
[52:29] CHANGING BECAUSE A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENS
[52:31] in your mind.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I feel this. This person SAY THIS AND I
[52:35] VEX WITH THIS AND YOU END UP CAUGHT UP
[52:37] AND YOU END UP CROOKED and twist up. But
[52:40] when the Holy Ghost come as a
[52:41] stabilizing FORCE AND THE TASTE CAN BE
[52:43] CONTROLLED, IT'S NOT EVEN A MATTER OF
[52:45] YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE AND FORGIVE. YOU
[52:46] JUST START TO LOOK AT PEOPLE DIFFERENT.
[52:48] YOUR ODDS JUST DROP THE PERSON WHO YOU
[52:50] COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH. You you DON'T
[52:52] EVEN KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT THE
[52:53] PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE GOD UNWIPE YOUR
[52:55] PERCEPTION, WIPE YOUR THINKING, DESTROY
[52:58] YOUR MEMORY, DESTROY IMAGINATION, WHAT
[53:01] YOU THOUGHT, YOUR THOUGHT, IT DOESN'T
[53:02] EVEN MATTER BECAUSE IT'S THE HOLY GHOST.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:11] When Christ come, you have no enemies.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; They all look sweet. You can forgive
[53:18] everything that's ever been done. Oh,
[53:20] glory.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Not some things. YOU COULD FORGIVE
[53:25] EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE. THE
[53:28] BITTEREST of enemy. I'm reading the
[53:30] prophet's words. You could pray for him
[53:32] on the street.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Put your arm around him and lift him up.
[53:39] WHAT A CONDITION. BROTHER TERREN, WHEN
[53:41] you read this, it makes you wonder about
[53:43] the foolishness in the message. Who
[53:45] can't shake one hand and who CAN'T DO
[53:47] THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THAT.
[53:50] AND IF THIS IS NOT THAT I KEEPING this
[53:53] &gt;&gt; because this is something THAT I WANT
[53:55] WHERE NO MATTER WHAT SOMEBODY DID, WHAT
[53:57] SOMEBODY SAID, WHAT SOMEBODY WHAT YOU
[53:58] WENT THROUGH, YOU KNOW HOW LIGHT you
[54:00] live when you have nos,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO GRUDGES, NOBODY BOTHERS YOU,
[54:04] nobody gets you upset. YOU ARE YOU ARE
[54:06] LIVING HIGHER.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; I said to somebody recently that a lion
[54:14] don't walk around the jungle getting wet
[54:15] with the ants.
[54:19] He's a lion. A mouse runs. So he's
[54:22] stressed out. You see that mouse? He's a
[54:23] lion.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; When you become so big amidst your
[54:28] situation and your trial after a while,
[54:30] they say I can't that happened that go
[54:32] wrong. THAT THAT IS NOTHING. IT'S AN
[54:34] PROBLEM.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Ghost to lift you
[54:38] up there to see.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't see it, THEN YOU GET
[54:41] TRAPPED. EVERYTHING BECOME A MOUNTAIN.
[54:44] Everything is a panic. YOU IN A
[54:45] PERMANENT PANIC ATTACK.
[54:48] YOUR LIFE IS WAVE AFTER WAVE OF PANIC.
[54:51] EVERYTHING WE CALL OH GOSH. You hear
[54:52] this? Calm down, brother. Calm down,
[54:54] brother. What happened? [clears throat]
[54:56] Boy, I got a flat tire. All that
[54:58] hysteria is a flat tire.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; When people get in caught up in emotion
[55:05] and their feelings, everything that is a
[55:07] everything starts to escalate and then
[55:09] it builds and builds and builds and
[55:10] builds. It's like a pressure cooker. But
[55:12] when the Holy Ghost come as a
[55:14] stabilizing force,
[55:16] your whole perception changes. And
[55:17] that's what we fighting for.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; The bitterest of enemy, you could pray
[55:24] for him on the street. That's a real
[55:27] thing. You know, this is not just
[55:28] forgiving on the street, but to pray for
[55:30] somebody, you have to be able to enter
[55:31] in to their needs. You want to be happy
[55:34] for them because that's the problem.
[55:35] Some people just be acting like they're
[55:37] happy for you and they're not. But for
[55:39] you to already pray for somebody, you
[55:40] have to be able to enter in. What do you
[55:41] need, brother? What do you need, sister?
[55:43] Let me pray for you. Let me pray with
[55:44] you.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; And you're praying with sincerity.
[55:47] You're going to God know.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; You're praying to for them to hear you
[55:50] pray. You're praying for God to answer.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; So God is the one auditing this
[55:54] exchange. He's the one watching the
[55:55] conversation. He is seeing the sincerity
[55:58] and the lack of sincerity. No wonder
[55:59] when Jesus was here, he could say, "IN
[56:01] VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING
[56:03] COMMANDMENTS OF MEN." BECAUSE HE COULD
[56:05] see their lips moving, but there's no
[56:07] sincerity in there. But when the Holy
[56:09] Ghost comes, when you approach God, they
[56:10] come in with a real need. They come with
[56:12] a desire and God IS OBLIGATED TO RESPOND
[56:14] WHEN YOU COME TO THEM THE RIGHT WAY ON
[56:16] THE BASIS OF HIS PROMISED WORD. CAN THE
[56:18] CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; No matter what creed, what denomination
[56:28] he belongs to, he's a creature who
[56:31] Christ died for. You see how God sees
[56:32] it? You see how the prophet expresses
[56:34] it? how we have to temper and remain
[56:36] humble and remain with humility and a
[56:38] certain spirit and keep low to the
[56:40] ground because at the end of the day it
[56:42] takes God to give revelation. I can't
[56:44] stand here and profess to have any kind
[56:46] of great revelation is the grace of God.
[56:48] I don't have no authority, no right to
[56:50] be here but by the grace of God, God can
[56:52] move me in the morning and knock me over
[56:54] AND TRUST ME, THE MOMENT I'M GONE, HE'LL
[56:56] put a replacement BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S
[56:58] BUSINESS. IT'S HIS KINGDOM. It's his
[57:00] word. THIS IS HIS CHURCH. IT'S HIS
[57:02] PEOPLE. HE IS THE ONE WHO OWNS THE
[57:03] BENCHES. OH, come on now. It's his
[57:05] camera. IT'S HIS KEYBOARD. IT'S HIS
[57:07] MUSIC. IT'S HIS DEACONS. IT'S HIS
[57:09] TECHNICIANS. GOD IS THE BOSS. HE'S THE
[57:11] KING OF KINGS. HE SAID HE IS THE HEAD OF
[57:13] THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE BODY.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO JUDGE SOMEBODY?
[57:20] WHAT RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO SAY WHO CAN
[57:22] MAKE IT AND WHO CAN'T MAKE IT? IT'S A
[57:23] God that justify it. THE GRACE OF GOD TO
[57:26] ALL OF US. HE'S A GOD WHO COULD PICK UP
[57:28] THE PROSTITUTE. HE COULD RETURN THE
[57:30] BANDIT. HE COULD TAKE THE MAN WHO WOULD
[57:32] NEVER WANTED GOD AND MAKE HIM A
[57:33] PREACHER. HE TOOK PAUL WHO WAS
[57:35] PERSECUTING CHRISTIANS, KILLED A DEACON.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; HEY, brother Papa.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; The church was impacted when brother
[57:46] Steven died. You know,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; the Bible SAY IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THEM
[57:51] TO ACCEPT BROTHER PAUL, YOU KNOW. YES.
[57:53] YES.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine
[57:56] &gt;&gt; the day brother Paul walk into a church
[57:58] they say not th not Saul.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Deacon say put him in the back. Put him
[58:02] in the corner. Watch him there. Put two
[58:04] deacons. Put one deacon in front one
[58:05] deacon behind the left. One deacon to
[58:07] the right.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I was there when they when he he was the
[58:11] one who led Stephven being killed.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; It would not have been an easy thing.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; But God wasn't business with that. That
[58:22] was not just a man in the church. That
[58:23] was a messenger of the age, a star in
[58:26] the right hand of God. You vex with God
[58:28] now.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; If God could take the murderer of a
[58:31] deacon,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; you hear what I said? If God could take
[58:33] the murderer of a deacon and make him an
[58:35] apostle and put HIM AS A STANDINY RIGHT
[58:37] HAND OF GOD, YOU COULD WRITE ANYBODY
[58:39] OFF, GOD IS ABLE TO RAISE UP ANYBODY. HE
[58:42] SAID, "IF YOU DON'T PRAISE ME, THEN THE
[58:43] ROCKS ARE GOING TO CRY OUT. GOD'S GOING
[58:45] TO RAISE UP SONS. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.
[58:48] DON'T BE AFRAID. GOD IS GOING TO HAVE A
[58:50] SUPER CHURCH. HE'S GOING TO RAISE UP
[58:52] SONS, RAISE UP DAUGHTERS. DON'T BE
[58:54] BOTHERED ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE. GOD IS
[58:57] GOING [screaming] TO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE
[58:58] WHO WILL STAND FOR THIS MESSAGE. DON'T
[59:00] BE DISCOURAGED. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. LIFT
[59:02] YOUR SHOULDERS UP. SPEAK POSITIVE AND
[59:05] WATCH GOD MOVE. HE'S GOING TO MOVE INTO
[59:07] YOUR HOME. HE'S GOING TO MOVE INTO YOUR
[59:09] SITUATION. HE'S GOING TO DELIVER THE
[59:10] YOUNG PEOPLE. LET ME PROPHESY. HE'S
[59:13] GOING TO RAISE THEM UP. HE'S GOING TO
[59:15] BREAK THE POWER OF SIN.
[59:21] AND GIVE THEM A REAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE
[59:23] HOLY GHOST.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T be words and rules. And now
[59:27] I understand it will be the living
[59:29] Christ in the CONTROL TOWER OF THEIR
[59:32] HEART. WHEN YOU SEE THEM ON FIRE, YOU'LL
[59:34] be amazed TO SEE WHAT GOD DONE.
[59:37] HALLELUJAH. WHAT THE LORD SEE WHAT THE
[59:39] LORD HAS DONE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It will be THE LORD'S DOING
[59:46] AND IT'LL BE MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES. WE
[59:49] WILL REJOICE. WE'LL BE GLAD WHEN WE SEE
[59:51] IT. AND [laughter] IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN
[59:52] BECAUSE GOD SAID IT.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:00:02] [applause and cheering]
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Every true seed of God has an
[1:00:08] appointment with the supernatural.
[1:00:12] That same Saul who became Paul
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; wasn't looking for Jesus when he was on
[1:00:16] the road to Damascus.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; He was on a mission to find more
[1:00:19] Christians to destroy. But when his time
[1:00:22] came, his time came. And God didn't send
[1:00:24] an angel. He came himself.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And he knocked HIM OFF HIS HORSE.
[1:00:28] HALLELUJAH. AND HE SAID, "IS IS IT ME
[1:00:30] YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?" OH, COME [laughter]
[1:00:31] ON NOW. HALLELUJAH. WHO YOU LOOKING FOR?
[1:00:34] BECAUSE YOU PICKED THE WRONG ONE. I CAME
[1:00:36] TO FIND YOU. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ME.
[1:00:37] I COME TO FIND YOU. I HAVE A WORK FOR
[1:00:39] YOU TO DO. I HAVE A MISSION FOR YOU TO
[1:00:41] DO. GOD IS GOING TO TAKE BACKSLIDERS AND
[1:00:44] TURN THEM INTO PREACHERS. OH, COME ON
[1:00:45] NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME TONIGHT. HE'S
[1:00:47] GOING TO TAKE A WAYWARD BROTHER AND MAKE
[1:00:49] HIM AN EVANGELIST. HE'S GOING TO STICK
[1:00:51] THE SISTER AND MAKE HER A PRAYER
[1:00:53] WARRIOR.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD I SERVE.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged, church. Yes, Lord.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; That's what being a true believer is
[1:01:09] about.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; It's being elevated above what you could
[1:01:12] see
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; because that's a test of your belief
[1:01:14] when it doesn't look good
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; to believe that God is able.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; More than
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; more than able. Thank you, brother
[1:01:22] Terren. Not just able, more than able.
[1:01:24] That's the true test of if you're a TRUE
[1:01:26] BELIEVER. WHEN IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
[1:01:28] LISTEN. WHEN IT LOOKING GOOD, it don't
[1:01:29] take faith.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? When it looking
[1:01:36] good with a joy, it don't already take
[1:01:37] faith, you know, because it looking
[1:01:38] good.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; It takes looking good. It already take
[1:01:41] much from us. BUT FAITH STARTS TO GET
[1:01:44] VALUABLE WHEN it don't look good.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; If the doctor say you're looking good,
[1:01:52] then you don't have faith.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house tonight?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; IF THE DOCTOR SAY CLEAN BILL [screaming]
[1:02:00] OF HEALTH,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; then you could walk out feeling good.
[1:02:03] They going to drink some soft
[1:02:04] [clears throat] drink and all kind of
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; clean bill of health. When the doctor
[1:02:07] start to say well here it it looking
[1:02:10] good enough.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; When he say looking good that is when
[1:02:17] your account of faith start to get
[1:02:19] tested. You ask yourself how much I have
[1:02:21] in this account boy.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Because your faith need to fill the gap
[1:02:25] between good bill of health and not so
[1:02:28] good bill of health. Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; And when they go back again and the
[1:02:31] doctor say still looking good and know
[1:02:33] then you it's a withdrawal from your
[1:02:34] faith account.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; So when we come faith comes by hearing
[1:02:38] the word.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; So every time you come to church is
[1:02:40] really you really trying to get a
[1:02:41] deposit of faith to know. Oh come on now
[1:02:43] somebody help me. And when you hear the
[1:02:45] positive faith that he is the god that
[1:02:47] health and by HIS STRIPES YOU ARE
[1:02:48] HEALED. And who he for you he called and
[1:02:50] WHO HE CALL HE JUSTIFIED AND WHO HE
[1:02:52] JUSTIFIED HE HAD ALREADY GLORIFIED PAST
[1:02:54] TENSE. AMEN.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm realizing how much this is why
[1:02:59] the scripture say when the son of man
[1:03:01] cometh shall he find faith
[1:03:04] and I was even reading in Hebrews
[1:03:05] because when you read through Hebrews I
[1:03:07] seen it was so striking
[1:03:09] because when it reached the part say
[1:03:11] these all died IN FAITH.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE DIED IN
[1:03:17] FAITH. HEBREWS 11.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; So it means these guys here die in
[1:03:20] doubt. No, they die down to the end in
[1:03:22] faith, you know.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And that faith is counted as a currency.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; So this whole thing, so there's such a
[1:03:29] thing as living BY FAITH IS ALSO DYING
[1:03:31] IN FAITH.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; But the teaching here is BEING IN FAITH
[1:03:36] BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW THAT GOD RIGHT TO
[1:03:38] CALL YOU HOME, YOU'RE GOING HOME IN
[1:03:40] FAITH
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT FAITH IS THE FAITH THAT
[1:03:42] WILL CONNECT TO RESURRECTION FAITH
[1:03:44] BECAUSE THIS BODY IS A PESS HOUSE. THIS
[1:03:47] BODY, WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT. WHETHER
[1:03:49] THROUGH THE RAPTURE OR THROUGH THE
[1:03:50] GRAVE, THIS BODY FINISHED. BUT THERE'S
[1:03:52] ANOTHER BODY WAITING FOR US.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; AND THAT BODY IS BETTER THAN THIS BODY.
[1:03:56] THAT BODY CAN NEVER GET SICK, NEVER GET
[1:03:58] TIRED, NEVER GET DEPRESSED. THAT'S WHO
[1:04:00] [screaming] I REALLY AM. THAT'S MY
[1:04:02] THEOPHONY. AND MY THEOPHONY IS CALLING
[1:04:05] FOR ME TONIGHT. HE'S SAYING, "STAND
[1:04:07] THERE BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU AND
[1:04:08] [screaming] I WILL BE TOGETHER." OH,
[1:04:10] SOMEBODY HELP ME TONIGHT.
[1:04:16] THAT'S WHY PAUL COULD SAY DEATH WHERE IS
[1:04:18] YOUR STING? GRAVE WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY?
[1:04:20] BECAUSE THAT REVELATION WAS CLEAR TO HIM
[1:04:22] THAT THIS BODY IS NOTHING. THIS 16
[1:04:25] ELEMENTS IS NOT WHO I AM. I'M JUST A
[1:04:27] PASSING THROUGH.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So whether IN THIS OR THE NEXT, I AM WHO
[1:04:31] I AM. I EXIST HERE BECAUSE I EXIST
[1:04:33] SOMEWHERE ELSE. OH, COME ON NOW.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT BECOMING SEED. YOU ARE SEED.
[1:04:39] AND BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, YOU COULD BE
[1:04:40] REBORN. BECAUSE YOU ARE SEED, YOU'RE
[1:04:42] GOING TO GET THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE YOU
[1:04:44] ARE SEED, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTED.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And that helps you live
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; a certain way, act a certain way, walk a
[1:04:59] certain way, talk a certain way, operate
[1:05:02] a certain way in your work environment.
[1:05:04] Why are you a prince?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SON OF THE KING. YOU'RE CALLED
[1:05:08] TO A HIGHER CALLING. YOU'RE LIVING IN
[1:05:10] THE HIGHER CALLING. YOU'RE NOT WAITING
[1:05:12] FOR THE LAST MOMENT TO SAY TO step into
[1:05:14] it. No, you're walking into it now.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Still in that same quote. I still trying
[1:05:23] to get out that quote, but like I
[1:05:24] staying in there.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; He said we are not to further a
[1:05:29] denomination,
[1:05:31] not to further a cult or some creed.
[1:05:33] We're one to further the kingdom of God.
[1:05:36] Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Then we take his blueprint and every
[1:05:39] time the blessed Bible says anything,
[1:05:41] the Holy Spirit in you cries out, "It's
[1:05:43] so it's my word."
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; As I've said, man, in the message faith
[1:05:52] in the sons of God, no man seeks after
[1:05:54] God. God seeks after man. Man in his
[1:05:59] nature is a rebellion against God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He's against God. But God loves the man.
[1:06:05] Since the fall in the Garden of Eden,
[1:06:07] God has still been calling for his
[1:06:09] child. And he calls him through the
[1:06:11] thunder, through the lightning, through
[1:06:14] the setting of the sun, through the
[1:06:16] preaching of the gospel, through signs
[1:06:18] and wonders, through prophets, through
[1:06:21] miracles, through visions, God speaking
[1:06:24] to his people.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in God commissioning Moses.
[1:06:32] Brother said, "And one of the doctors
[1:06:34] said, "Well, I tell you, I find this
[1:06:36] that the GREATEST POWER IN THE world
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; is not the atomic bomb,
[1:06:43] but a believer in contact with his
[1:06:46] maker."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Can we say that one more time?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; The greatest power in the world is not
[1:06:55] the atomic bomb, but a believer in
[1:06:58] contact with his maker. It changes the
[1:07:01] whole attitude. Changes his mental. It
[1:07:04] changes his habit. IT CHANGES HIS BODY.
[1:07:08] IT CHANGES HIS NATURE. EVERYTHING.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And friends, when you think about it, we
[1:07:13] live our lives every day. And if you
[1:07:14] don't stay in the presence and read the
[1:07:16] word and think, you could forget who you
[1:07:18] are. You know,
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; you get caught up in politic, caught up
[1:07:22] in the news, caught up in this and all
[1:07:23] that. Look, this whole thing that was
[1:07:25] last week with the quote unquote war,
[1:07:26] all that fizzle out, boy, it looking
[1:07:28] like bad as we say.
[1:07:32] People caught up in the hysteria one
[1:07:33] minute, then it gone. This cycle of life
[1:07:36] that is just meant to take you from
[1:07:38] distraction to distraction.
[1:07:40] And if you get caught up in that world
[1:07:42] of distraction to distraction, you'll
[1:07:43] realize when you look back over time,
[1:07:45] because time compounds what we do not do
[1:07:48] and time compounds what we do.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again?
[1:07:53] In the heat of the moment, you don't
[1:07:55] really realize what you didn't do and
[1:07:57] what you did. But when you look back
[1:07:59] over the last month, the last year, the
[1:08:01] last 5 years, and you measure how much
[1:08:03] progress you make, then you realize, but
[1:08:05] wait a minute, you know, if I had just
[1:08:06] do a hour of this thing a day, I've been
[1:08:08] in a different place.
[1:08:11] Many times people WONDER HOW I REACH
[1:08:13] HERE and it's because as they say with a
[1:08:15] plane just one degree off over time you
[1:08:18] in a different country you know over two
[1:08:20] three minutes you don't feel the impact
[1:08:22] you know but over a month over two
[1:08:24] months over a year over two years you
[1:08:27] was trying to go to Canada and you in
[1:08:28] Spain
[1:08:31] because that one degree off carry you
[1:08:34] carry you carry you carry you until you
[1:08:36] realize that you're not where you're
[1:08:37] supposed to be all along and then they
[1:08:38] ask yourself but how I end up here.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And it's one degree in your life that
[1:08:43] not ALIGN CORRECTLY
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; AND JUST PUT TIME ON IT
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; and you don't realize you miss your
[1:08:50] prayer life.
[1:08:52] You miss the word. You're in the wrong
[1:08:55] conversations, spending time with the
[1:08:58] wrong people, and before you know it,
[1:09:01] you have to be asking, "But how do I
[1:09:02] return to my first love?"
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Because that's what happened to the
[1:09:06] early church. You know,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; it wasn't a over it wasn't they leave
[1:09:09] Sunday and by the next day they it was
[1:09:10] over time slowly slowly slowly over time
[1:09:14] they stopped doing this and they stopped
[1:09:15] doing this until until church became a
[1:09:17] routine and church became casual.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; But the true believers are not like that
[1:09:24] because the truly believers are looking
[1:09:26] to anchor themselves in the word.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; The true believers are trying to find
[1:09:30] ways to ensure THAT THEY READ THEIR
[1:09:32] BIBLES AND PRAY every day. AMEN.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN THE WORD. THEY ARE PLAYING
[1:09:37] THE TAPES. THEY ARE READING THE QUOTES
[1:09:38] BECAUSE IT'S A DISCIPLINE.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; The discipline of the word.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; What did God tell Joshua? Meditate on
[1:09:47] the word
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and you'll have good success.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; When anybody say I'm not being success
[1:09:54] successful, the one question I had to
[1:09:55] ask is are you meditating on the word
[1:09:57] day or night?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; When you start, do not come back to me.
[1:10:00] Then we can analyze what the issue is.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Because if the formula is meditate on
[1:10:06] the word day and night and you'll have
[1:10:07] good success. Then before we do a audit,
[1:10:10] let me audit that now.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Because God give us a formula. Meditate
[1:10:14] on the word day and night. In other
[1:10:15] words, let it be a practice. What does
[1:10:17] God say? How does God want me to move?
[1:10:19] Make him I heard somebody say, put him
[1:10:21] on your board of directors. Put him on
[1:10:22] your team. You working ALONE IN YOUR
[1:10:24] OFFICE. PUT JESUS ON YOUR TEAM and see
[1:10:26] what's happen in your work.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? BRING JESUS
[1:10:29] INSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND SEE HOW YOUR HOUSE
[1:10:31] CHANGE.
[1:10:33] Can the church say amen?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me just drop
[1:10:40] a few thoughts here so we could start to
[1:10:43] find a place to land this evening.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; To help us.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the separation or
[1:10:51] separating the true believers from their
[1:10:53] church members. Those who want this as a
[1:10:56] gospel of convenience.
[1:11:01] Brother Brandham said here in the
[1:11:02] message the queen of Sheba now some
[1:11:04] people look at their symptoms and we
[1:11:06] could read this and we have read this
[1:11:08] course many times and what I've realized
[1:11:10] I don't know what your experience is but
[1:11:12] many of these things sound good when you
[1:11:15] hearing it and it's not you
[1:11:20] but when is your issue suddenly it is be
[1:11:23] different you know like I said some ago
[1:11:26] you could say have faith have faith have
[1:11:28] faith and you can tell your brother have
[1:11:29] faith you're going through a rough time
[1:11:30] But pap hold on hold on. But when your
[1:11:34] turn come
[1:11:36] and you are telling yourself hold on you
[1:11:39] throw up your hand you recognize wait
[1:11:41] now all them brother I tell hold on I
[1:11:43] struggling to hold on you know because
[1:11:46] the problem becomes your problem. So you
[1:11:47] can tell somebody don't LOOK AT THE
[1:11:48] SYMPTOMS LOOK AT GOD because you don't
[1:11:51] have the problem but when the problem
[1:11:53] come to your house you have a list of
[1:11:55] all the symptoms. Symptom number one,
[1:11:57] symptom number two, symptom pastor, look
[1:11:59] at all the symptoms.
[1:12:01] But here the word is saying to us,
[1:12:03] people look at their symptoms. My pastor
[1:12:05] prayed for me last time, but my hands
[1:12:07] know better. That has nothing to do with
[1:12:08] it.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; If you are really a believer, you don't
[1:12:12] even look at that. It's already settled
[1:12:13] forever. God healed you. MAY THIS BE A
[1:12:16] STATEMENT OF FAITH FOR EVERYONE WHO
[1:12:18] HEARING THIS TONIGHT. WHEREVER YOU MIGHT
[1:12:20] BE, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SYMPTOM IS,
[1:12:22] WHAT THE FEELING IS. GOD IS A HEALER. HE
[1:12:24] HAS ALREADY HEALED YOU BY HIS STRIPES.
[1:12:27] YOU ARE ALREADY HEALED. MAY YOUR FAITH
[1:12:30] RISE TO THAT AS A TRUE BELIEVER. I DON'T
[1:12:33] CARE WHAT THE AFFLICTION IS. HIGH BLOOD
[1:12:35] PRESSURE, CANCER, DIABETES, FEMALE
[1:12:38] CONDITION, WHATEVER IT IS, BY HIS
[1:12:40] STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. THAT SETTLES
[1:12:42] THE MATTER. TAKE THAT TO THE DEVIL. TAKE
[1:12:45] THAT TO THE DOCTOR. TAKE THAT TO THE
[1:12:47] WORLD. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT TRUE BELIEVERS.
[1:12:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I believe in I believe in I believe in
[1:12:58] it has to become a reality to you.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; It has to be a reality to YOU AND YOUR
[1:13:05] WORDS HAVE TO ALIGN WITH IT. YOUR
[1:13:08] THINKING HAS TO ALIGN WITH IT. YOUR
[1:13:10] BEHAVIOR HAS TO ALIGN WITH IT. COUNTING
[1:13:12] THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT AS THOUGH THEY
[1:13:14] WERE. SO YOUR CHILD IS ALREADY
[1:13:16] DELIVERED. DON'T LOOK AT WHERE THEY AT
[1:13:17] TONIGHT. THEY ARE DELIVERED. WHEN PEOPLE
[1:13:19] ASK YOU ABOUT THEM, SAY THEY'RE
[1:13:21] DELIVERED. BUT ARE YOU SEEING THEM? I
[1:13:23] DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. THEY ARE
[1:13:24] DELIVERED.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; That woman with the dead BOY
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE DIED in the field and she PUT
[1:13:34] HIM ON THE CHARIOT AND SHE GOING TO THE
[1:13:36] PROPHET AND THEY SAY, "WHAT GOING ON?
[1:13:38] WHY YOU BREAKING THESE FIELD LIMIT?" SHE
[1:13:39] SAY, "ALL IS WELL.
[1:13:41] ALL IS WELL." WHAT IS SHE? SHE'S LOOKING
[1:13:43] AT FAITH.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; SHE KNOWS IF SHE COULD GET IN TOUCH WITH
[1:13:46] A PROPHET. ALL IS WELL.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; DON'T DISTRACT ME. ALL IS WELL. DON'T
[1:13:52] SLOW ME DOWN. ALL IS WELL. I'M ON A
[1:13:53] MISSION. I'M NOT TAKING THE LEFT OR THE
[1:13:55] RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO I DON'T
[1:13:56] WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS, YOUR IDEAS,
[1:13:58] WHAT YOU THINK, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
[1:14:00] WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE WAS WHEN YOU WAS
[1:14:03] GOING THROUGH IT. THAT WHAT IT WAS. ALL
[1:14:04] IS WELL. FAITH HAS A BELINE. IT HAS A
[1:14:08] DIRECT LINE TO THE WORD OF GOD. OH, CAN
[1:14:10] THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:14:15] Some of us talking too much
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; to the wrong people and the voices
[1:14:19] telling you, well, it mightn't be so, it
[1:14:21] mightn't BE SO. PERHAPS YOU KNOW ALL IS
[1:14:24] WELL. FAITH TAKES YOU HIGHER.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? True believers,
[1:14:33] we have got to be ANCHORED IN FAITH.
[1:14:35] WHEN THE SON OF MAN COMETH, SHALL HE
[1:14:36] FIND FAITH?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT [screaming] TO BE A CHURCH
[1:14:40] WITH FAITH. EVEN SEVEN THUNDER FAITH
[1:14:42] BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE SEVEN THUNDER FAITH
[1:14:44] TO CARRY THE BRIDE OUT OF HERE. AND
[1:14:46] SEVEN THUNDERS GIVES FAITH. SEVEN
[1:14:48] THUNDERS SHOWS US HOW TO GO. SEVEN
[1:14:50] THUNDERS GIVES THE BRIDE A REVIVAL.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; SEVEN THUNDERS GATHERS THE BRIDE
[1:14:56] TOGETHER.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Levels of faith from dingy faith all the
[1:15:09] way to rapture and faith.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us how can we
[1:15:13] have faith for the rapture if you got
[1:15:14] faith for DIVINE HEALING. THERE'S GOT TO
[1:15:16] BE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING. AND GOD
[1:15:18] WILL PLACE SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE IN
[1:15:21] THE CHURCH TO TEST YOUR FAITH.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO
[1:15:26] WORK, GOD IS GOING TO SAY, "STAY RIGHT
[1:15:27] THERE AND BELIEVE IT. SAY IT. PREACH IT.
[1:15:29] DO IT.
[1:15:32] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Look how Jesus spoke.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Lazarus is dead.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus say I go wake him.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He not going to awaken. No.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Even his words. And I'm trying to teach
[1:15:55] us something. And I'm speaking to myself
[1:15:56] as well. Our words are powerful.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] Life and death is in the power of the
[1:16:03] tongue.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; If you shall say to this mountain, be
[1:16:07] moved.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; There's a connection between your words
[1:16:11] and your faith. If you shall say to this
[1:16:13] mountain, be moved. And don't doubt in
[1:16:15] your heart, you will have it.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; The two have to work together.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Your words and your faith.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me YOU HAVE FAITH, BUT
[1:16:28] YOU'RE speaking doubt.
[1:16:30] And you can't SPEAK IF YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:16:32] REAL FAITH BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUBSTANCE
[1:16:34] BEHIND THE WORDS. BUT IF YOU HAVE FAITH
[1:16:36] like a mustard seed,
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God say it's a small SEED, JUST A LITTLE
[1:16:39] BIT OF FAITH AND YOU COULD SPEAK to your
[1:16:41] situation and count the things that are
[1:16:43] not as THOUGH THEY WERE. THEN THERE'S
[1:16:45] nothing will be able to stand before
[1:16:46] you.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] And that is what God is looking for in
[1:16:53] this end time bride
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; because we are promised the spoken word.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And that word only operates with favor.
[1:17:00] And God thinks something and expresses
[1:17:02] it. He expects it to be there and it's
[1:17:04] there.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? May God help us
[1:17:09] to for our faith to rise tonight to
[1:17:12] begin to speak what's in the word
[1:17:14] concerning our lives because you have a
[1:17:16] right as a son and daughter OF GOD TO
[1:17:17] APPLY THE WORD FOR YOUR HOUSE. AMEN.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What if Abraham
[1:17:26] would have looked that next month to see
[1:17:29] if Sarah was going to have the baby?" He
[1:17:31] never noticed that. He just noticed what
[1:17:32] God said. And any true believer looks to
[1:17:36] the promise, not what symptoms are
[1:17:39] around them. This is an encouragement to
[1:17:41] brother Hugh, encouragement to brother
[1:17:42] Terren, encouragement to anybody going
[1:17:44] through anything tonight.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the symptoms say.
[1:17:48] Whose report will you believe? WE SHALL
[1:17:52] believe the report of the Lord. AND IN
[1:17:54] THE LORD'S REPORT, ALL IS WELL. IN THE
[1:17:57] LORD'S REPORT, YOU ARE HEALED. IN THE
[1:17:59] LORD'S REPORT, YOUR BODY ALREADY GETTING
[1:18:01] BACK YOUNG AGAIN. IN YOUR OH, COME ON
[1:18:03] NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME TONIGHT.
[1:18:10] [cheering and applause]
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; FAITH LOOKS AT THE IMPOSSIBLE AND SAY
[1:18:16] IT'S POSSIBLE. AMEN.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; FAITH LOOKS AT IT BEING BROKEN AND SAY
[1:18:20] IT IS WELL BECAUSE JESUS STOOD THERE AT
[1:18:23] A DEAD MAN'S GRAVE AND SAY LAZARUS COME
[1:18:25] FORTH.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And that was a defining moment in
[1:18:32] Jesus's ministry. Because up until that
[1:18:34] time he was saying don't tell nobody.
[1:18:37] Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody.
[1:18:39] But do you know that when Lazarus came
[1:18:41] forth that is when water was more than
[1:18:43] flour because they came after that
[1:18:46] brother Steven to see Jesus but they
[1:18:48] already was looking for Lazarus
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; they say brother Lazarus here but
[1:18:53] Lazarus here because we heard he was
[1:18:54] dead but look him look him look him at
[1:18:56] that point they couldn't keep it SECRET
[1:18:58] NO MORE EVERY SAY HEY THIS THING IS REAL

[1:19:02] COULDN'T KEEP QUIET anymore
[1:19:05] [applause and cheering]
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; and God is going to have a situation
[1:19:09] and situation by the terance that will
[1:19:11] require such faith. It will be such a
[1:19:13] manifestation that BACKS WILL SAY NAH
[1:19:15] BOY this thing REALLY REAL BOY ALL THIS
[1:19:17] YEAR I HEARING ABOUT THIS MESSAGE THING
[1:19:19] BUT LOOK HOW GOD BEGIN TO MOVE IT WILL

[1:19:28] POWER AND DEMONSTRATION AND GOD IS
[1:19:30] LOOKING FOR TRUE BELIEVERS BECAUSE HE
[1:19:32] COULD ONLY PROVE HIS WORD BY TRUE
[1:19:34] BELIEVERS. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? GIVE
[1:19:37] THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; I'm working to find a place to wind

[1:19:50] said, "No, Miss Brother Clarence, but

[1:19:53] "Don't close yet."
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; I know brother Clarence now say,
[1:19:56] "Brother Clarence, thank you for the the
[1:19:59] substitute that you have up here
[1:20:01] anchoring the service."
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Any true believer looks at
[1:20:11] the PROMISE NOT WHAT SYMPTOMS are around
[1:20:14] them.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:21:28] [applause and cheering]
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:33] Everything we need is IN THIS MESSAGE.
[1:21:35] RAPTURE AND FAITH IS LAYING IN THIS
[1:21:37] MESSAGE. JUST AS MUCH AS DIVINE FAITH,
[1:21:39] JUST AS MUCH AS FAITH FOR DIVINE
[1:21:41] HEALING. CAN THE CHURCH say amen?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:21:48] in the message. Who is this? And we know
[1:21:51] Lord that thy church is not in the
[1:21:53] majority this morning, this evening. The
[1:21:56] true believers are in THE MINORITY. BUT
[1:21:59] SOMEDAY, LORD, YOU WILL TAKE THAT
[1:22:01] minority to yourself.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Can we take a few more minutes?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet said in the message, Micaiah
[1:22:11] the prophet,
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; all true prophets, all true Christians,
[1:22:16] all true believers stay with that word.
[1:22:18] No matter what anybody says, you stay
[1:22:20] right with the word. They say the days
[1:22:22] of miracle is passed. Don't you believe
[1:22:24] it?
[1:22:28] THEY SAY REVIVAL IS PASSED. DON'T YOU
[1:22:30] BELIEVE IT?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; They say speaking IN TONGUES IS PASSED.
[1:22:34] DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; THEY SAY SHOUTING ON THE HILLS OF GLORY
[1:22:38] HAS PASSED. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY
[1:22:40] SAY THERE'S NO OTHER POWER TO COME.
[1:22:42] DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT? BECAUSE THERE'S A
[1:22:44] SUPER CHURCH THAT'S GOT TO COME INTO
[1:22:45] POWER. THERE'S AN ANOINTING THAT'S GOING
[1:22:47] TO TAKE THIS BRIDE HIGHER.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; If somebody don't have faith to believe
[1:22:56] it, don't limit my faith.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; If you want to take a helicopter, YOU
[1:23:00] TAKE A HELICOPTER. I WANT A PLANE THAT
[1:23:02] COULD BREAK PAST THE SOUND BARRIER. I
[1:23:04] WANT TO GET A ROCKET.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; WE THE ASTRONAUT AGE. YOU WANT TO FLY A
[1:23:08] HELICOPTER? NO PROBLEM. I'M NOT STOPPING
[1:23:09] YOU. GO IN A HELICOPTER. BUT WE ARE
[1:23:11] SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. THE VEHICLE WE
[1:23:14] WANT HAVE TO BREAK PAST THE SONG
[1:23:15] BARRIER.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Take us straight to glory.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:21] Don't limit my faith.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We serve a big God.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; This is a a clarion call to those that
[1:23:32] are sick among us.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; You believe for the rapture, sickness
[1:23:35] has got to be dealt with
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; because sickness, if God could change
[1:23:38] his body from mortal to immortality, he
[1:23:41] could heal your man. You have to believe
[1:23:42] it. You have TO SEE IT. YOU HAVE TO
[1:23:44] RECEIVE IT.
[1:23:46] IF THE PROMISE IS THIS OLD GRAY HEAD AND
[1:23:49] THIS BOY going to get young again, HE
[1:23:50] COULD TAKE CARE OF YOUR SITUATION.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; DIABETES IS NOTHING TO GOD. CANCER IS
[1:23:56] NOTHING TO GOD. LEUKEMIA IS NOTHING TO
[1:23:58] GOD. TUBICULOSIS IS NOTHING TO GOD IS
[1:24:01] NOTHING TO GOD.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE POWER TO PUT SATAN UNDER OUR
[1:24:06] FEET.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF THIS CHURCH HAS TO RISE.
[1:24:10] THE POWER OF YOUR FAITH HAS TO RISE
[1:24:12] UNTIL YOU WALK OVER THESE THINGS. CAN
[1:24:14] THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? MAY IT START
[1:24:16] TONIGHT. MAY IT START NOW. MAY IT START
[1:24:19] IN YOUR HOME. ALL IS WELL. GOD IS IN
[1:24:22] CONTROL. THERE'S A POWER THAT'S RISING.
[1:24:26] [cheering]
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet taught us the moment
[1:24:31] THE MOMENT THE BRIDE GETS TO KNOW WHO
[1:24:34] SHE IS, THEN THE RAPTURE COULD GO. SO ON
[1:24:36] THE JOURNEY, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW HEALING
[1:24:38] IS YOURS. YOU GOT TO KNOW REVIVAL IS
[1:24:40] YOURS. YOU GOT TO KNOW YOUR FAMILY IS
[1:24:42] YOURS. AND YOU WALK OUT OF HERE SPEAKING
[1:24:44] IT. AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL
[1:24:47] SERVE THE LORD. CAN THE CHURCH say amen?
[1:24:50] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE.
[1:24:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:56] MUSICIANS, get ready by the grace of
[1:24:58] God. We'll continue on on Bible study on
[1:25:00] on Friday on service on Sunday. But we
[1:25:03] are going to keep climbing higher. KEEP
[1:25:05] YOUR FAITH BANKS RUN. KEEP YOUR MOTORS
[1:25:07] HUMMING. KEEP THE ENGINE TUMBLING. WE
[1:25:09] ARE GETTING READY TO LEAVE HERE. LET'S
[1:25:11] WARM UP THE ASTRONAUT. LET'S WARM UP THE
[1:25:13] ROCKET SHIP. LET'S GET CHARGED. LET'S
[1:25:15] GET [screaming] READY TO TAKE BACK OUR
[1:25:17] FAMILIES. TO TAKE BACK OUR HEALTH, TO
[1:25:19] TAKE BACK YOUR JOY, TO TAKE BACK YOUR
[1:25:21] VICTORY, TO TAKE BACK WHAT THE DEVIL
[1:25:24] TOOK FROM YOU. WE'RE NOT LEAVING HERE
[1:25:26] WONDERANDERING. WE ARE LEAVING HERE
[1:25:28] VICTORIOUS. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF
[1:25:30] PRAISE.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; May the Lord richly BLESS YOU TONIGHT.
[1:25:33] MAY THE LORD KEEP YOU TONIGHT. MAY THE
[1:25:36] LORD MAKE YOUR FAITH RISE TONIGHT. MAY
[1:25:38] THE REVIVAL BEGIN TONIGHT.

[1:35:01] Let's just bow our heads. We do have a
[1:35:04] prayer request tonight [music]
[1:35:06] uh from brother Francis Timothy. Good
[1:35:08] night saints. Please pray for my
[1:35:10] brother-in-law Raymond Antoine for his
[1:35:13] total healing. He's in the ICU on live
[1:35:16] support. And this is brother Antoine's
[1:35:18] son.
[1:35:20] And if there's anyone with a request
[1:35:21] tonight you want to show by raising your
[1:35:23] hands. And that applies both here in the
[1:35:27] sanctuary and even if you are connected
[1:35:29] online right now, lift your hand right
[1:35:32] where you are as we unite in faith as
[1:35:34] the church of the living God to bring
[1:35:37] all of these requests before the
[1:35:38] heavenly father.
[1:35:40] Lord Jesus, we come to you tonight,
[1:35:42] Lord, on the basis of faith. Lord, the
[1:35:45] currency of eternity, the currency of
[1:35:48] heaven, Lord, standing on the confession
[1:35:50] of our faith, Lord, with a revelation
[1:35:52] that Lord, you are not now healing.
[1:35:54] You're not now doing it, but it is
[1:35:56] already done. Father, it's a finished
[1:35:58] work. And we are writing a check from
[1:36:00] what has already been done. Lord, the
[1:36:03] healing power is available. And we are
[1:36:05] making a withdrawal, Lord, from the
[1:36:07] account in the sky, Lord. Lord,
[1:36:09] everything we could ever desire, Lord,
[1:36:11] has already been taken care of in your
[1:36:13] word when it comes to these things,
[1:36:15] Father. So, Lord, we bring Lord Raymond
[1:36:17] Anwine before you, Lord. He's in the ICU
[1:36:20] on life support, Father. Lord, may you
[1:36:23] visit him where he is right now. And may
[1:36:25] you bring healing from the crown of his
