[37:23] is the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[37:26] shall grow up before him as as a tender
[37:28] plant as a root out of dry ground he had
[37:31] no form nor cess when we shall see him
[37:35] there is no beauty that we should desire
[37:37] him he has despised and rejected of men
[37:41] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[37:44] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[37:46] from him he was despised and we esteem
[37:49] him not surely he had borne our griefs
[37:52] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[37:55] esteem him strickly
[37:58] smitten of God and Afflicted but he was
[38:00] wounded for transgression he was bruised
[38:03] for iniquities the chastisement of our
[38:06] peace was upon him and with his Tripes
[38:08] we are healed amen all we like sheep
[38:10] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[38:13] to his own way and the Lord had laid on
[38:17] him the iniquity of us all he was
[38:20] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[38:23] not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to
[38:26] the slaughter as a sheep before his
[38:28] sharers is dumb so he open it not his

[38:44] your life where you are today amen amen
[38:48] and um just a thought I
[38:51] have strength through weakness that's a
[38:56] thought strength through weakness and
[38:57] from communion brother brah said these
[38:59] words now if God did not spare his own
[39:03] son from Cruel testing then he will not
[39:06] spare you and I from Cruel testing and
[39:10] Jesus was here confronting the greatest
[39:14] test that he had ever had Gethsemane
[39:18] laid just before him a whereare that
[39:20] once that final all sufficient test must
[39:23] come when the burdens of the entire
[39:25] world laid upon his bless shoulders
[39:28] there was no one in all heaven or Earth
[39:30] could ever stood it but him and to know
[39:33] that all of the sins of past sins
[39:38] present sins and future sins rested upon
[39:44] this decision it was one of the most
[39:47] greatest victories that Christ ever won
[39:50] or proved his great messiahship as when
[39:54] he said to God not my will thine be done
[39:58] that was the greatest Victory he had
[40:01] ever won all the Demons of Torment was
[40:05] around to tempt him and try him and when
[40:08] we get right with God when our hearts
[40:12] become pure and the Holy Spirit has
[40:16] taken its place in our hearts it's the
[40:19] most glorious thing to have testing amen
[40:23] amen
[40:25] amen a s like
[40:27] 35% before we would say it again when we
[40:31] get right with God when our hearts
[40:34] become pure and the Holy Spirit has
[40:36] taken its place in our hearts it's the
[40:39] most glorious thing to have testing the
[40:44] Bible tell us that our testings and
[40:46] trials are more precious to us than
[40:49] silver or gold of this world and we
[40:52] should be
[40:53] thankful that means you're grateful to
[40:55] God to be considered Worthy to be
[40:58] tested remember he could to throw you
[41:01] away but he decide to work you and
[41:04] rechannel you and repurpose you for his
[41:08] honor and His glory for his
[41:12] honor
[41:14] Hallelujah therefore the greatest
[41:17] victory of overcoming for Christ was in
[41:19] The Garden of
[41:21] Gethsemane under
[41:23] anguish under pain and that word anguish
[41:27] means severe mental or physical pain or
[41:31] suffering anguish misery sorrow
[41:36] heartache dispear desolation grief
[41:40] anguish is to be extremely distressed
[41:43] about something amen he was a man
[41:46] acquainted with grief amen not just with

[42:17] but in that weakness in that struggle

[42:25] your life who have known where Jesus
[42:28] took some step forward in the Ghana
[42:30] Gethsemane and prayed and his sweat like
[42:32] drops of blood who would have thought
[42:34] that was the greatest Victory when a man
[42:36] in prayer saying not my will but thy
[42:38] will be done if it's only possible let

[50:54] necessities and persecutions in the the
[50:56] Str for Christ sake for when I am weak
[51:00] then am I
[51:02] strong I am become a fool in
[51:05] glorian you have compelled me for I
[51:09] ought to have been commended of you for
[51:11] in nothing am I behind the very cheest
[51:14] Apostle do I be
[51:16] nothing from perfect my perfect weakness
[51:18] listen to The Prophet God passes the
[51:23] Nobles and get the weakest God passes
[51:26] those who think they are something to
[51:29] get somebody that don't know nothing in
[51:32] order to work his purpose in their life
[51:35] God said to Paul my strength is perfect
[51:38] in your weakness my strength becomes
[51:41] more perfect as you become more weaker
[51:44] more you can yield to me the better I
[51:48] can use you you see normally when we get
[51:51] high yes on the job on the money on the
[51:55] house on the car on the land on the post
[51:58] or whatever it is we feel
[52:03] sufficient so then that sufficiency make
[52:06] us less dependent upon God so God have
[52:09] to give you a
[52:10] highfall make something happen make a
[52:13] split in your life make some kind of
[52:16] punch inside of there to oh God that's
[52:18] what he want to hear you that you could
[52:20] get to depend on him lean on him because
[52:24] if you could lean on a brother you lean
[52:25] on your brother lean on on a father lean
[52:27] on an uncle lean on a husband lean on
[52:28] your wife lean on anybody except him but
[52:30] he want you to lean on him that's why he
[52:32] pulled the props off of Isaiah and
[52:35] Isaiah to run into the temple Isaiah was
[52:37] leaning on King Uzziah and when God
[52:39] pulled the prop this is where he saw the
[52:41] Lord high and lifted up then he can
[52:43] confess my dependency is on God that's
[52:45] when the SS come among him to bring fire
[52:48] to bring cleansing power oh Hallelujah
[52:52] so the more you can forget about your
[52:54] education the more you can forget about
[52:56] your denomination the more you can
[52:58] forget about the stuff and your stuff
[53:01] and yield yourself to me the more I can
[53:03] use you CU you become weak and I'll make
[53:06] you my own purpose
[53:08] strong God can make strength out of
[53:12] weakness that's the reason he always
[53:14] does it who would think of the humility
[53:15] of his own son when he was born in the
[53:17] manger manard B cow stall wrapped and
[53:20] swad and CLA he could have come to a
[53:21] palace he could have come through
[53:22] corridors of Heaven A full Angel salute
[53:24] but he choose to make Christ the example
[53:27] of us he brought him in humility he
[53:29] never trained him in the schools of this
[53:31] world but he trained him by his own
[53:32] power so he could completely yield
[53:34] himself not to the thoughts of man or
[53:37] the strength of the world but yield
[53:39] himself to the power of God and that's
[53:41] what us today we yield ourselves today
[53:43] to our great denominations and Realms we
[53:45] yield ourselves denomination people sold
[53:47] out to their churches to the what they
[53:51] believe in that kind of a way they not
[53:53] sold out to God because they don't have
[53:55] a personal experience with Christ
[53:56] they have a church experience so as long
[53:59] as they in the church they safe and I'm
[54:01] sorry they're not
[54:02] safe oh you're not safe you have to want
[54:05] a personal experience you have to want
[54:08] your own
[54:10] fire that church are fire boy don't talk
[54:13] about that church of fire you have to
[54:14] have the
[54:16] fire don't talk about no church fire the
[54:19] church fire is one thing but do you have
[54:20] the fire of God to take you through what
[54:23] yet lays ahead
[54:25] amen you hear what I said the fire is
[54:28] not phenomenal the fire is to prepare
[54:31] you for what lays ahead because a trying
[54:33] time is coming a challenging time is yet
[54:36] ahead of
[54:40] [Applause]
[54:43] you amen we heal ourselves to
[54:46] denomination what it's got to say and
[54:47] what they say about it that's contrary
[54:49] to God's will we've got to heal ourself
[54:50] to the spirit of God and go where the
[54:53] spirit should go Hebrews God soldiers
[54:55] Heroes and they said they said out of
[54:58] weakness was made strong that's Hebrews
[55:00] 11:34 they had to get weak before they
[55:03] could get strong out of their weaknesses
[55:05] they were made strong you you put on
[55:06] that scripture here's something to
[55:08] console us I'm almost
[55:12] done here's something that console us
[55:14] here's something that encourages out of
[55:17] weakness and humility God chooses the
[55:20] people to build his kingdom out of if we
[55:24] ever get to heaven
[55:26] if we ever stand in the presence of God
[55:29] with his church we will stand in a bunch
[55:31] of people that's been weak and rejected
[55:34] cast out by the world and know it's
[55:37] nothing isn't it strange that God Likens
[55:39] a sheep a sheep is the most helpless
[55:41] thing there is nothing is so
[55:43] insufficient or defense than a sheep a
[55:45] rabbit can run a squirrel can get up in
[55:47] a tree a dog can bite a l can tear a
[55:50] horse can kick a bird can fly but the
[55:52] Sheep stands helpless that's the way God
[55:55] wants us Amen to realize that we are
[55:58] totally insufficient then God takes that
[56:01] person and begins to mold himself into
[56:04] that person and make his hands do what
[56:07] God would have his hands to do make his
[56:09] lips speak what God lips would speak
[56:11] because they're not his they Gods he
[56:13] begins to build a character begins to
[56:15] take his weakness to make his own self
[56:17] am he brings us here on Earth but then
[56:19] we are educated we are smart did you
[56:21] ever think about that and then that what
[56:23] educated Great Men Builders professional
[56:25] men and what but God's side was weak and
[56:27] humble that's how God uses them that's
[56:30] God's opportunity that's God's way of
[56:32] getting to us is when we are weak we get
[56:34] something then this encourages of course
[56:37] because God's whole kingdom is built out
[56:39] of these kind of people then when you
[56:42] get that
[56:44] kind when you get to that kind of a way
[56:46] then you in his kingdom the case is with
[56:49] us here we go not that we are too weak
[56:51] the case is we are too
[56:53] strong we are just too strong we are Str
[56:57] stronge headed on another side
[56:59] bullheaded nobody can't tell you nothing
[57:01] because you seen it so and you stand by
[57:03] your conviction and you seen it
[57:05] so and God have nothing with you seen it
[57:08] so God say my thoughts is not your
[57:11] thoughts my ways are not your ways so
[57:13] it's not how you see it it's God's
[57:16] vision of it oh Hallelujah that's what
[57:18] you need a vision that transform your
[57:21] life that that show you something Beyond
[57:24] you isn't that right the cas is we're
[57:26] not too weak we're too strong we're too
[57:28] strong too Str strong-headed we're too
[57:30] strong in our head we know too much God
[57:33] wants to get that out of us we're too
[57:35] strong we're too strong to yield to him
[57:38] we to yield
[57:39] ourselves and this I'm going to close
[57:41] with the scripture First Corinthians one
[57:43] and Paul saying Christ said me not to
[57:45] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[57:47] with wisdom of words at least the Cross
[57:48] of Christ should mean none effect for
[57:50] the preaching of the Cross is them that
[57:52] perish foolishness but to us which are
[57:54] saved it is the power of God for it is
[57:57] written here we go I will destroy the
[57:59] wisdom of the wise I will bring to
[58:02] nothing the understanding of The Prudent
[58:05] where is the wise where is the Scribe
[58:07] where is the disputer of this world had
[58:09] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[58:11] world for after in the wisdom of God the
[58:13] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[58:16] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[58:19] save them that believe for the Jews
[58:21] require a sign and the Greeks seek after
[58:23] wisdom but we we preach Christ crucified

[1:09:10] church says amen amen you appreciate our
[1:09:14] pastor this morning you appreciate the
[1:09:16] comments this morning you appreciate the
[1:09:18] message last week the refiners fire what
[1:09:22] a masterpiece of a masterpiece you know
[1:09:25] during the week I said to him I feel
[1:09:26] like I'm in the refiner fire and it's
[1:09:29] something he read and I said that was it
[1:09:31] for me when he did some research on how
[1:09:34] they put the silver in the refiner fire
[1:09:38] and in every Flame or the fire there's
[1:09:40] the hot spot it's the hottest part of
[1:09:43] the fire and that's where God places you
[1:09:45] but he has to keep his eye on you
[1:09:47] because if he leaves you there one
[1:09:49] second too long you get destroyed so no
[1:09:52] matter how hot the trial is he is
[1:09:54] watching you because he knows just how
[1:09:57] much fire you need to be in a position
[1:09:59] that he could shape you and he could
[1:10:01] mold you and he could take the
[1:10:03] impurities out to you so I thank God
[1:10:05] this morning for the refiners fire I
[1:10:08] thank God for the trials I thank God for
[1:10:11] the testings I thank God for the
[1:10:14] pressure because it's good it doesn't
[1:10:16] always feel good but it's good can the
[1:10:18] church say
[1:10:20] Amen so I have a thought this morning if
[1:10:22] you have your
[1:10:24] Bibles would will you turn with me to
[1:10:26] four portions of
[1:10:28] scripture going to read quite a bit this
[1:10:30] morning I don't normally do this but I
[1:10:34] think it's necessary for this message
[1:10:35] we're going to read two scriptures in
[1:10:38] the Old Testament and two in the New
[1:10:40] Testament we're going to be in the Book
[1:10:42] of
[1:10:43] Ecclesiastes we're going to be in the
[1:10:45] book of St Matthew and the Book of St
[1:10:48] Mark
[1:11:00] reading
[1:11:02] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and reading verse
[1:11:06] one to everything there is a
[1:11:10] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:11:15] the
[1:11:15] heaven a time to be
[1:11:17] born and a time to die a time to plant
[1:11:22] and a time to pluck up that which is
[1:11:24] planted a time to kill and a time to
[1:11:27] heal a time to break down and a time to
[1:11:30] build up a time to weep and a time to
[1:11:34] laugh a time to mourn and a time to
[1:11:40] dance moving in the same book
[1:11:43] Ecclesiastes to chapter 7 and reading
[1:11:47] from verse
[1:11:49] two it is better to go to the house of
[1:11:53] mour than to go to to the house of
[1:11:56] feasting for that is the end of all men
[1:11:59] and the living will lay it to his heart
[1:12:02] am sorrow is better than laughter for by
[1:12:06] the sadness of the countenance The Heart
[1:12:08] Is Made better the heart of the wise is
[1:12:12] in the house of mourning but the heart
[1:12:15] of
[1:12:15] fools is in the house of Mirth reading
[1:12:19] from St Matthew Chapter 5 and reading
[1:12:22] from verse one
[1:12:25] in Matthew 5 and verse1 and seeing the
[1:12:28] multitudes he went up into a mountain
[1:12:30] and when he was set his disciples came
[1:12:33] unto him and he opened his mouth and
[1:12:34] taught them saying blessed are the poor
[1:12:37] in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of
[1:12:41] Heaven blessed are they that mourn for
[1:12:43] they shall be comforted blessed are the
[1:12:47] meek for they shall inherit the earth
[1:12:50] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:12:52] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:12:54] shall be f F blessed are the merciful
[1:12:57] for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are
[1:13:01] the pure in heart for they shall see God
[1:13:03] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:13:06] shall be called the children of God
[1:13:08] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:13:10] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:13:13] Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when
[1:13:16] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:13:19] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:13:21] you falsely for my sake and our last
[1:13:25] scripture reading from the book of St
[1:13:26] Mark chapter 5 and reading from verse 21
[1:13:31] and this scripture interestingly as I
[1:13:33] Was preparing it I didn't even realize
[1:13:35] where it fell but this scripture
[1:13:37] actually falls right after Jesus comes
[1:13:40] back from dealing with Legion so he's
[1:13:43] coming back from the other side so verse
[1:13:46] 21 and when Jesus was passed over again
[1:13:49] by ship unto the other side much people
[1:13:52] gathered unto him and he was nigh unto
[1:13:55] the
[1:13:55] sea and behold there cometh one of the
[1:13:58] rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name
[1:14:01] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[1:14:04] and besought him greatly seeing my
[1:14:07] little daughter lith at the point of
[1:14:10] death I pray thee come and lay thy hands
[1:14:12] on her that she may be healed and that
[1:14:15] she shall live and Jesus went with him
[1:14:18] and much people followed him and
[1:14:20] thronged him and a certain woman which
[1:14:23] had an issue of blood 12 years and had
[1:14:25] suffered many things of many Physicians
[1:14:28] and had spent all that she had and was
[1:14:31] nothing better but rather grew worse
[1:14:33] when she had heard of Jesus came in the
[1:14:36] press behind and touched His Garment for
[1:14:38] she said if I may touch but his clothes
[1:14:41] I shall be whole and straight away the
[1:14:44] Fountain of her blood was dried up and
[1:14:46] she felt in her body that she was healed
[1:14:49] of that plague and Jesus immediately
[1:14:52] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[1:14:54] out out of him turned him about in the
[1:14:58] press and said who touched my clothes
[1:15:00] and his disciples said unto him thou
[1:15:02] seest the multitude thr in thee and
[1:15:04] sayest thou who touch me and he looked
[1:15:06] around about to see her that had done
[1:15:09] this thing but the woman fearing and
[1:15:12] trembling knowing what was done in her
[1:15:14] came and fell down before him and told
[1:15:17] him all the truth and he said unto her
[1:15:19] daughter thy fate had made thee whole go
[1:15:21] in peace and behold of thy plague and
[1:15:24] while he had spake there came from the
[1:15:26] ruler of the synagogues house certain
[1:15:29] which said thy daughter is dead why
[1:15:31] troubles thou the master any further as
[1:15:35] soon as Jesus heard the word that was
[1:15:37] spoken he said unto the ruler of the
[1:15:39] synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and
[1:15:43] he suffered no man to follow him save
[1:15:45] Peter and James and John the brother of
[1:15:47] James and he come into the house of the
[1:15:49] ruler of the synagogue and see it the
[1:15:51] tumult and them that wept and wailed
[1:15:55] greatly and when he was coming he saith
[1:15:57] unto them why make he this a do and Weep
[1:16:01] the damsel is not dead but sleep it and
[1:16:04] they laughed him to scorn but when he
[1:16:06] had put them all out he taketh the
[1:16:08] father and the mother of the damsel and
[1:16:11] them that were with him and entered in
[1:16:13] where the damsel was lying and he took
[1:16:16] the damsel by the hand and said unto her
[1:16:18] talitha come me which is by interpreted
[1:16:20] damsel I say unto thee arise and
[1:16:23] straightway the damsel AR Rose and
[1:16:25] walked for she was of the age of 12
[1:16:27] years and they were astonished with a
[1:16:29] great astonishment and he charged them
[1:16:31] straightly that no man should know it
[1:16:33] and command it that something be given
[1:16:35] her to eat may the Lord add a blessing
[1:16:37] to the reading of his word let's just
[1:16:38] bow our heads one more time Heavenly
[1:16:41] Father any man could read the scriptures
[1:16:43] but it it really takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:16:45] breathe life upon it Lord and I pray
[1:16:47] this morning you would walk out of the
[1:16:49] pages of the Bible and touch your people
[1:16:52] Lord touch my body Lord father minister
[1:16:55] to us this morning Father may you bless
[1:16:57] the word and the reading of it in the
[1:16:58] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[1:17:00] church says amen and amen you may be
[1:17:03] seated Hallelujah this
[1:17:05] morning so I have for this morning a
[1:17:08] very interesting
[1:17:10] title my title this morning is a house
[1:17:13] of
[1:17:15] mourning a
[1:17:17] house of
[1:17:20] morning we read in Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:17:23] 3 there's to everything there's a season
[1:17:25] and a time to every purpose under Heaven
[1:17:28] time to be born a time to die a time to
[1:17:31] plant a time to pluck up that which is
[1:17:33] planted and A Time to Kill a time to
[1:17:35] heal a time to break down a time to
[1:17:36] build up and it goes on a time to weep A
[1:17:39] Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time
[1:17:41] to dance and many times in our lives we
[1:17:44] find
[1:17:45] ourselves attracted to one thing more
[1:17:48] than another it is our nature to go
[1:17:51] after joy and go after what's what's
[1:17:53] Pleasant or what's appealing to us there
[1:17:56] are things that we find ourselves that
[1:17:58] we like and there things that we we
[1:18:00] don't like and it doesn't matter what
[1:18:02] the situation is it's a war going on
[1:18:04] because doctors tell you you should eat
[1:18:06] this to be healthy but what you should
[1:18:09] eat and what you want to eat has two
[1:18:11] different effects on your taste
[1:18:14] buds but we find ourselves in life life
[1:18:16] is about balance and when you read that
[1:18:18] scripture they said to everything
[1:18:19] there's a time and there's a purpose and
[1:18:22] so you can't get away from it because
[1:18:24] even even if you have the moments when
[1:18:26] you are happy all the time there will
[1:18:27] come a time when you have to
[1:18:30] cry and no matter how long you cry
[1:18:32] there's a time that you'll have to laugh
[1:18:34] because that's just the way it is
[1:18:36] there's a time to
[1:18:38] everything there's a time to dance even
[1:18:41] if you don't and have never danced in
[1:18:43] the spirit there's coming a time when
[1:18:45] you have to dance because to everything
[1:18:47] there's a season and a purpose and
[1:18:50] a can I get a witness in the house this
[1:18:52] morning we are going somewhere this
[1:18:55] morning so to everything there is a time
[1:18:58] and there's a season you can't get away
[1:19:01] from it you cannot just have one you
[1:19:03] cannot just have laughter all the time
[1:19:06] you cannot just have dancing all the
[1:19:08] time you cannot just have what you want
[1:19:10] all the time because that's not how God
[1:19:13] does things brother brandom said it this
[1:19:15] way he said there are mountains and
[1:19:16] there are valleys and you can never
[1:19:18] appreciate the mountain unless you know
[1:19:21] what the valley is can I get a witness
[1:19:23] in the house just morning he said the
[1:19:26] very nature of God is a god of variety
[1:19:29] there are yellow flowers there are red
[1:19:31] flowers there are pink flowers there are
[1:19:33] green flowers they all kinds of flowers
[1:19:35] because that's how God wants to see the
[1:19:37] tapestry of life even God himself there
[1:19:40] are times he is glad there are times
[1:19:42] he's angry he said I'm a jealous God he
[1:19:45] himself goes through these changes that
[1:19:48] take place kind of church say Amen
[1:19:50] there's a there's a time for everything
[1:19:52] Hallelujah there's a season for
[1:19:54] everything you could you could be
[1:19:56] walking the street and it's a dry season
[1:19:58] but when the season Chang the rainy
[1:20:01] season you can't walk as if it's a dry
[1:20:03] season not because you don't change
[1:20:05] doesn't mean change is happening around
[1:20:07] you because it's a time to every season
[1:20:11] when it's the rainy season you need to
[1:20:13] adjust how you dress adjust what you
[1:20:15] carry you got to carry an umbrella or
[1:20:17] something because the season has change
[1:20:19] if you don't change you'll be forced to
[1:20:21] change or you'll get wet can I get a
[1:20:23] witness in the houses this morning to
[1:20:26] everything there's a season and a time
[1:20:28] to every purpose under the heaven and
[1:20:31] under the heaven every purpose that God
[1:20:34] has for under Heaven has a time to every
[1:20:36] purpose that's why you couldn't miss the
[1:20:38] service this morning if you wanted too
[1:20:41] because there's a time to the purpose
[1:20:43] for you being here this morning your
[1:20:45] condition has nothing to do with his
[1:20:47] purpose and the time for his purpose
[1:20:50] what happened to you yesterday has
[1:20:52] nothing to do with his purpose and the
[1:20:54] time time he placed on his purpose
[1:20:57] because when God says the time is up and
[1:20:59] the time is ready and he calls Saul from
[1:21:02] over of his horse Saul couldn't say
[1:21:04] check me back next week his time had
[1:21:07] come because it's a time and a season a
[1:21:11] time to be born and a time to die a time
[1:21:14] to plant so all these years we have had
[1:21:17] times of planting the word seed but is a
[1:21:19] time for a harvest there's a time to
[1:21:22] reap the rewards of the sacrifice and
[1:21:25] your labor the time to see the blessings
[1:21:28] of the travailing Zion there's a time to
[1:21:31] see the benefits of the testimony that
[1:21:34] you have maintained on your job
[1:21:36] maintained in your neighborhood there's
[1:21:38] a time to every
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:41] purpose A Time to Kill and a time to
[1:21:44] heal the devil is afraid of this
[1:21:46] scripture because when the time to heal
[1:21:48] is come there's nothing could stop a
[1:21:51] time of healing there's nothing to stop
[1:21:53] a time of life there's nothing to stop a
[1:21:56] time of dancing When God says it's time
[1:21:59] for you to dance you may have never
[1:22:01] danced before you may not even know how
[1:22:03] to dance but when David saw they are
[1:22:05] coming it was his time to dance his wife
[1:22:09] got flustered about it but he had tapped
[1:22:12] into this scripture a time to dance he
[1:22:15] had mourned for a long time he had
[1:22:17] weeped for a long time but the time for
[1:22:20] dancing had
[1:22:22] come can the Church Say Amen
[1:22:25] you could only appreciate the mountain
[1:22:27] unless you taste the valley that's why
[1:22:29] God takes you through your ups and downs
[1:22:31] and your trials and your testing and
[1:22:33] your tribulation and your persecution
[1:22:35] because there's coming a mountain
[1:22:37] there's coming a holy city there's
[1:22:39] coming a holy Jerusalem those who get
[1:22:41] there will appreciate that day and sing
[1:22:44] the songs of Amazing Grace because the
[1:22:46] Angels cannot sing that song because the
[1:22:49] Angels don't know what it is to be in
[1:22:51] the valley the Angels don't know what it
[1:22:53] is to be sad Angels don't know what it
[1:22:55] is to be depressed and frustrated and to
[1:22:58] feel like giving up they don't have that
[1:23:00] transition between laughter and sadness
[1:23:03] between joy and peace but we know what
[1:23:05] it is because we are operating under a
[1:23:08] law that Solomon wrote about everything
[1:23:11] there's a season and a time to
[1:23:13] everything under the
[1:23:16] heaven so brother Isaac I've been
[1:23:18] waiting I've been holding on I've been
[1:23:21] sighing I've been praying uh that's good
[1:23:24] that's all right but there's something
[1:23:26] happening behind the scenes uh that have
[1:23:28] nothing to do with your sign and have
[1:23:30] nothing to do with your crying it has to
[1:23:32] do with God's clock God's time piece and
[1:23:35] it never stops ticking it never stops
[1:23:38] moving and one of these days an alarm
[1:23:40] will go off it's God's Heavenly alarm
[1:23:43] when you have a destiny you have an
[1:23:46] appointment with the supernatural that
[1:23:48] you cannot miss
[1:23:52] you can the church say
[1:23:56] Amen
[1:23:59] hallu hallu we're going
[1:24:03] somewhere this is just the background
[1:24:05] Hallelujah but the brandom said the time
[1:24:07] has come friends when something's got to
[1:24:09] be said
[1:24:10] amen got to break the routine a little
[1:24:13] bit we got to say something a little
[1:24:15] more effective the time has come for the
[1:24:17] church to move upall or to go back is
[1:24:20] that how you feel this morning what's
[1:24:22] the good coming to church after the
[1:24:24] service and you're not moving up you're
[1:24:26] not getting stronger you're not getting
[1:24:28] faster when you join the Army after a
[1:24:31] week of training you supposed to be
[1:24:32] stronger than the first day you came in
[1:24:35] after a month of training you're
[1:24:36] supposed to be a little stronger a
[1:24:38] little faster a little more experience
[1:24:40] so I say this when the time has come for
[1:24:42] the church all of your experiences now
[1:24:45] you have work experience Hallelujah can
[1:24:47] the church say Amen when you apply for a
[1:24:50] job you want to know how much experience
[1:24:51] you have amen and when God is looking
[1:24:54] for some vessels to use he wants to know
[1:24:56] how much experience you have how many
[1:24:58] Devils you push back how many times
[1:25:00] you've been pressed down but you didn't
[1:25:02] stay down you got back up
[1:25:05] again can the church say Amen the time
[1:25:08] has come brother the brand said for
[1:25:10] these things to be fulfilled the time
[1:25:12] has come for god Jehovah to rise on the
[1:25:15] scene and show himself that's the
[1:25:17] prophet's words now the time has come

[1:25:35] of Heaven the time has come to believe
[1:25:38] or to don't believe do we have any
[1:25:41] believers in the house this
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:47] morning the time has come to act upon
[1:25:50] what you know to be the truth the time
[1:25:53] has come for a show
[1:25:55] from the message the hour has come
[1:25:57] brother said the time has come that God
[1:25:59] will gather his church together through
[1:26:01] under one great big banner of the Lord
[1:26:04] Jesus Christ and pour out his powers
[1:26:07] among them and great signs and wonders
[1:26:09] will take place the time has come the
[1:26:12] time has come for the Pentecostal Church
[1:26:14] to make a stand the time has come to
[1:26:17] circumcise the church and call out this
[1:26:20] foolishness the time has come to go back
[1:26:22] to the old Landmark the the time has
[1:26:24] come for the outpouring the time has
[1:26:26] come for the Gathering of the people the
[1:26:28] time has come for Jesus to come the time
[1:26:31] will be here soon to give out the
[1:26:32] rewards brother I'm excited because the
[1:26:35] clock is taken and the time has
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:42] come don't worry I haven't gone to the
[1:26:44] text just yet Hallelujah brother be
[1:26:47] careful the prophet said that your crown
[1:26:50] is in set on someone else's head the
[1:26:53] time has come we're at the end time if
[1:26:55] we're ever going to do anything Brethren
[1:26:58] we're going to do it now the time is at
[1:27:00] hand the time has come when God shaken
[1:27:04] every denomination Under the Sun can the
[1:27:06] church say
[1:27:08] Amen can the church say Amen am
[1:27:13] wonderful so we read this scripture and
[1:27:16] I'm building a background because I'm
[1:27:17] going somewhere to everything there's a
[1:27:19] season there's a time to
[1:27:22] mourn and a Time
[1:27:24] time to
[1:27:26] dance and then we read the scripture in
[1:27:28] Ecclesiastes and I want you to ride with
[1:27:31] me this
[1:27:32] morning where Solomon continues and I
[1:27:34] want you to understand the picture of
[1:27:35] Solomon for the young people who have
[1:27:38] not studied it in depth would you've
[1:27:40] studied
[1:27:42] it God gave Solomon an opportunity he
[1:27:45] said whatever you ask
[1:27:47] for I'm I'm going to give it to
[1:27:50] you it was a blank check whatever
[1:27:52] Solomon requested he was going to get it
[1:27:55] Solomon could have asked for riches and
[1:27:57] wealth and whatever he had an
[1:27:59] opportunity to ask and whatever he asked
[1:28:03] for he was going to receive it but
[1:28:05] Solomon made a choice and he asked for
[1:28:08] wisdom that's right and God said to him
[1:28:11] you know what I'm going to give you
[1:28:12] wisdom unlike anybody else but because
[1:28:15] he asked wisdom I'm also going to give
[1:28:17] you a great Kingdom I'm going to give
[1:28:19] you strength I'm going to give you and
[1:28:21] he gave him everything else wealth and
[1:28:22] everything else that he didn't even ask
[1:28:24] ask for so when we read the book of
[1:28:27] Ecclesiastes it's it's written by a king
[1:28:30] like no other
[1:28:31] king and Ecclesiastes after he says in
[1:28:34] chapter three there's a time to mourn
[1:28:36] and dance he goes on to say it is better
[1:28:39] to go to the house of
[1:28:41] mourning than to go to the house of
[1:28:44] feasting for that is the end of all men
[1:28:46] and the living will lay it to his heart
[1:28:48] and then he goes in verse four the heart
[1:28:50] of the wise is in the house of more
[1:28:55] but the heart of fools is in the house
[1:28:57] of merth and throughout the Book of
[1:28:59] Proverbs Solomon takes his time to draw
[1:29:02] a distinction about fools and wise in
[1:29:06] fact he very early he begins to speak
[1:29:09] about the fear of the Lord amen is the
[1:29:12] beginning of wisdom amen and he begins
[1:29:15] to draw a distinction between fools and
[1:29:18] the
[1:29:19] wise are you with me this morning
[1:29:22] Hallelujah
[1:29:24] amen Solomon says in fors a fool a fool
[1:29:28] finds pleasure in evil
[1:29:33] conduct Solomon goes on whoever spreads
[1:29:36] slander is a
[1:29:37] fool I'm not calling anybody a fool this
[1:29:40] morning I'm just
[1:29:41] reading the
[1:29:43] scriptures the mouth of the fool gushes
[1:29:47] fully so when somebody is speaking
[1:29:49] nonsense they are a
[1:29:55] it is a man's honor to avoid Strife but
[1:29:58] every fool not
[1:30:00] some every fool is quick to
[1:30:05] quarrel that's
[1:30:07] word the way of a fool seems right to
[1:30:12] him but a wise man listens to
[1:30:16] advice so Solomon begins to create this
[1:30:19] distinction between fools and wise this
[1:30:22] has nothing to do with how long you're
[1:30:24] the church that's right if you're a
[1:30:25] deacon Elder Minister Usher truste it
[1:30:27] doesn't this is not about that it's
[1:30:29] about how you speak how you act what you
[1:30:32] do a fool spurns rejects his father's
[1:30:37] discipline Solomon goes on as a dog
[1:30:40] returns to his vomit so a fool repeats
[1:30:42] his
[1:30:45] folly and then he goes on to make this
[1:30:48] distinction it is better to go to a
[1:30:50] house of mourning and he said the heart
[1:30:52] of the wise is in the house of mourning
[1:30:56] but the heart of the fool is in the
[1:30:57] house of Mer you know there people who
[1:30:59] like to joke and they like to laugh and
[1:31:02] they like to have fun there's nothing
[1:31:04] wrong with laughter and smiling there's
[1:31:06] a time to laugh there's a time to smile
[1:31:08] there's a time to dance but it's also a
[1:31:10] time to mourn but Solomon makes a
[1:31:13] powerful distinction he said it is
[1:31:15] better if you have a choice between the
[1:31:18] house of laughter and the house of Mirth
[1:31:21] and the house of Happiness he said it is
[1:31:24] better to go into the house of
[1:31:26] mourning that's right because the heart
[1:31:28] of the wise is in the house of
[1:31:31] mourning you gain wisdom in the house of
[1:31:33] mourning because in the house of mour
[1:31:36] it's not all about what's funny
[1:31:38] Hallelujah in the house of morning it
[1:31:40] brings you to confront will I go out
[1:31:43] like this man will I go out like this
[1:31:46] woman in the house of morning they talk
[1:31:49] about who went on was he a good man was
[1:31:53] he honorable man was she a good woman
[1:31:56] was she a prostitute was he an honest
[1:31:59] man was he a man with a testimony was he
[1:32:02] a real Christian did he have a
[1:32:05] testimony I've been to houses of
[1:32:08] mourning of real Christians where the
[1:32:11] neighbors who don't know Jesus would say
[1:32:13] that man was different that man loved
[1:32:16] the Lord that
[1:32:19] man Hallelujah it is better to be in the
[1:32:22] house of mour than the house House of
[1:32:28] birth a house of morning that's my title
[1:32:32] this
[1:32:32] morning a
[1:32:35] house of mourning because in the house
[1:32:38] of mourning you get wisdom in a house of
[1:32:41] mourning you get to reflect in a house
[1:32:43] of mour you begin to think carefully am
[1:32:46] I living
[1:32:48] right about a week or so ago he didn't
[1:32:51] sent me a message for a schoolmate of
[1:32:54] mine who got a heart attack and died all
[1:32:57] of a sudden Jesus it shook him it shook
[1:33:00] me I'm young I'm like that age a heart
[1:33:03] attack and all of a sudden made me think
[1:33:06] am I
[1:33:07] healthy that was the first thought that
[1:33:09] came to
[1:33:12] mind cuz all of a sudden when you are
[1:33:14] confronted with your mortality you begin
[1:33:16] to
[1:33:17] think I need to exercise I need to eat
[1:33:21] better can't allow things to stress me
[1:33:25] and I didn't even go to the house of
[1:33:27] morning so much more when you were there
[1:33:29] and you were in that environment yes so
[1:33:33] I want to paint a picture this
[1:33:35] morning of the House of morning when
[1:33:40] Jesus was here there are very few houses
[1:33:42] that he
[1:33:45] visited in very early in his ministry he
[1:33:48] would visit a house and there was a
[1:33:51] wedding and we know it is his first
[1:33:53] miracle he's there he's invited nobody
[1:33:56] really knows who he is there's suspicion
[1:33:58] there are rumors he's just there and
[1:34:00] they run out of
[1:34:03] wine and his mother Mary come and say
[1:34:06] listen we run out of wine he said that
[1:34:09] what is that to do with me I'm just a
[1:34:11] guest like everybody else and say
[1:34:14] whatever he says to do do it Jesus is in
[1:34:17] that house and when Jesus is in the
[1:34:19] house says something got to happen
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:25] and Jesus gives instruction pour water
[1:34:27] and they pour water and but the brandom
[1:34:29] said he bypass the grapes he bypassed
[1:34:31] the pressing of the grapes he bypassed
[1:34:33] the fermentation he and you know what it
[1:34:35] was the best wine they say who does that
[1:34:38] who saves the best wine for last why
[1:34:41] Jesus was in the house can the church
[1:34:43] say
[1:34:44] Amen I'm trying to paint a picture this
[1:34:47] morning there are very few houses that
[1:34:50] Jesus visited when he walked the Earth
[1:34:52] he would visit a house of Simon where he
[1:34:54] would face
[1:34:56] disrespect it was the custom because of
[1:34:59] the roads and the camels and the donkeys
[1:35:01] and the animals that when you walk the
[1:35:04] streets your feet would be
[1:35:06] dirty By Invitation he didn't force
[1:35:09] himself into that house by invitation he
[1:35:11] is there and they allowed the Messiah to
[1:35:14] sit in the house with dirty
[1:35:18] feet and Jesus as a wise man he didn't
[1:35:22] argue he he didn't slander he didn't
[1:35:25] criticize them he didn't say oh gosh all
[1:35:28] yes he may here everybody else would
[1:35:30] clean no he sits there and a woman sees
[1:35:34] this is disturbed by
[1:35:36] it she begins to
[1:35:38] cry he said this is not right and with
[1:35:41] her
[1:35:42] tears she washed his feet hallah with
[1:35:46] her hair she wipes his
[1:35:49] feet Jesus visits the home of zakus and
[1:35:52] there are few homes that he visit
[1:35:55] visited and each of these homes had a
[1:35:57] different story a different message a
[1:35:59] different
[1:36:00] lesson to be gleaned out of the life of
[1:36:03] Jesus and we handled
[1:36:05] it but I want to go a bit deeper this
[1:36:08] morning brother the Jason and look at
[1:36:10] how Jesus dealt with two
[1:36:13] situations we preached two weeks ago
[1:36:16] about Jesus going to the other side to
[1:36:19] deal with a man who couldn't come to him
[1:36:20] so Jesus went to him and the Bible says
[1:36:22] as he returns he is met with a group of
[1:36:24] people and a man called gyrus comes up
[1:36:27] to Jesus and said Jesus my daughter's 12
[1:36:31] years old she's dying and Jesus the
[1:36:34] Bible said is on his way towards
[1:36:37] charis's house but there's a huge crowd
[1:36:40] around him and at the same time there's
[1:36:42] this woman with the issue of blood who
[1:36:45] interrupts Jesus's journey to gyrus his
[1:36:49] house so you see as you watch Jesus life
[1:36:52] he's going from mission to from mission
[1:36:54] to Mission there's no wasting
[1:36:56] time he finishes preaching and he comes
[1:36:59] from preaching tired he goes to the
[1:37:01] other side he delivers the man callion
[1:37:03] he comes back gyrus confronts him he's
[1:37:06] walking there's a woman with the issue
[1:37:07] of blood
[1:37:10] Hallelujah he's on a mission and as
[1:37:13] Jesus is walking this woman touches him
[1:37:14] and Jesus says who touched me I felt
[1:37:17] virtue left me disciples say but Jesus
[1:37:20] everybody touching you amen and he
[1:37:23] speaks to the this woman and the Bible
[1:37:25] says while he's talking to her a man
[1:37:28] comes to gyus and say gyus don't waste
[1:37:31] the Master's time your daughter just
[1:37:35] died while Jesus finish and talk to the
[1:37:38] woman with the issue of blood who was
[1:37:40] just healed he overhears this he said
[1:37:43] don't worry about it gyrus only
[1:37:48] believe and Jesus continues his journey
[1:37:51] brother kangali to the house
[1:37:54] of
[1:37:59] morning the Bible says when Jesus gets
[1:38:01] to this house of mourning but a shame
[1:38:03] there's crying there's wailing there's
[1:38:05] weeping yeah
[1:38:08] amen and Jesus ask why are you making
[1:38:11] all of this
[1:38:12] fuss why are you making all this
[1:38:17] noise I've come to wake
[1:38:20] up but the nights the Bible said they
[1:38:22] laughed at him
[1:38:24] they mocked him they scorned him because
[1:38:28] for a long time brother said she was
[1:38:32] sick so when Jesus come and said now we
[1:38:35] brother brand dramatized it and said
[1:38:38] she's dead you can't wake on no what but
[1:38:40] Jesus said get all the unbelief
[1:38:43] out and the Bible say after he threw
[1:38:46] them
[1:38:47] out after he threw all the unbelievers
[1:38:50] he goes up to this young damel and says
[1:38:53] arise and this young girl got back up
[1:38:57] and he said give her in one book they
[1:38:59] say give her some
[1:39:00] meat you know normally said they say
[1:39:02] when you're sick give you something soup
[1:39:03] and you know you say give us some meat
[1:39:05] give us some real food because the the
[1:39:07] sickness she had not only she raised
[1:39:09] from the dead but she's not
[1:39:11] even don't give her any soup give her
[1:39:14] some meat give her some heavy food she
[1:39:15] she could handle it because it's
[1:39:17] resurrection power resurrection power
[1:39:21] Jesus stepped into a house of mourning a
[1:39:24] house of sadness a house of
[1:39:28] weakness he may be
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:35] seated but
[1:39:37] mourning is not just for people who go
[1:39:41] on you know people mourn all kinds of
[1:39:44] stuff They Mourn their
[1:39:48] car They Mourn
[1:39:51] opportunities They Mourn where didn't
[1:39:53] work out They Mourn how their neighbors
[1:39:57] have stuff that they don't
[1:40:00] have and they go into their own
[1:40:04] mour because they don't have and it's
[1:40:08] painful that they do not that's in the
[1:40:10] scripture it's in
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:16] scripture their own
[1:40:18] morning and it's important to understand
[1:40:21] because people don't study the Bible so
[1:40:23] when and that's the reason I read the
[1:40:25] blessed are the peacemakers and the poor
[1:40:28] in spirit because that scripture blessed
[1:40:30] are they that mourn is not mourning
[1:40:32] natural
[1:40:34] death because those
[1:40:36] scriptures let me draw a reference I'm
[1:40:39] kind of it's Sunday school this morning
[1:40:40] is that
[1:40:42] okay listen to the structure of Jesus's
[1:40:45] teaching he said blessed are the poor in
[1:40:48] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:40:50] heaven so what they are blessed with
[1:40:52] blessed the poor in it's something to
[1:40:54] attain it's something to have it's
[1:40:56] something to get blessed are the poor in
[1:40:58] spirit so if you get and if you are poor
[1:41:00] in spirit you get the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:41:02] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:41:04] shall be comforted blessed are the meek
[1:41:05] for they shall inherit blessed are they
[1:41:07] which do Hunger so they shall be filled
[1:41:09] there's nobody walking around saying I
[1:41:11] want to mourn as many people as
[1:41:13] possible that's not what this mourning
[1:41:16] is friends so there are three types of
[1:41:19] mourning can I teach a little bit
[1:41:24] amen natural mourning is grieving for
[1:41:27] someone you have
[1:41:29] lost God gives you a give the natural
[1:41:32] responses to mourn even Jesus mourned at
[1:41:34] the grave of
[1:41:36] Lazarus but that's not what Jesus is
[1:41:38] talking about
[1:41:42] here of all the the Beatitudes it's
[1:41:45] called it's submit a desire nobody would
[1:41:49] say about natural mourning no ber person
[1:41:51] would say I want to go after as much of
[1:41:52] it as I I can that's what not what Jesus
[1:41:55] is speaking
[1:41:56] about another type of morning is sinful
[1:41:59] morning King
[1:42:01] Ahab when he was king of Israel God gave
[1:42:04] him a palace and a kingdom and next to
[1:42:07] the Palace there was a poor man called
[1:42:09] naboth a poor man who had a Vineyard and
[1:42:13] the Bible said Ahab set his eyes on
[1:42:15] nebo's
[1:42:17] Vineyard the Bible said Ahab got vexed
[1:42:20] and suen he got sad he got depressed he
[1:42:24] started one biblical scholar said he
[1:42:26] started to pout he started to mourn
[1:42:28] because he couldn't get his hands on the
[1:42:35] vineyard that is called sinful
[1:42:38] mourning so it's a sadness is a grief
[1:42:41] that leads to
[1:42:42] death amen but Godly sorrow or Godly
[1:42:47] mour produces a
[1:42:50] repentance that leads to life
[1:42:54] so we talk about natural sorrow natural
[1:42:56] mourning with the loss of an individual
[1:42:59] there's sinful sorrow but there's also
[1:43:02] Godly sorrow there is Godly mourning
[1:43:05] amen it's the same thing like those that
[1:43:08] sigh and
[1:43:10] cry to the abomination in the
[1:43:13] city so blessed are they that mourn for
[1:43:17] the sin in the city blessed are they
[1:43:20] that mourn because we have lost young
[1:43:22] people people blessed are they that
[1:43:24] mourn because we need a Revival blessed
[1:43:28] are they that mourn because they are
[1:43:30] dead people in the church but they are
[1:43:32] dead but we are mourning for them
[1:43:34] blessed that mourn because they shall be
[1:43:37] comforted they shall be comforted with a
[1:43:40] Revival they shall be comforted without
[1:43:43] UNP pouring they shall be coverfor oh
[1:43:46] you don't hear me this morning you don't
[1:43:48] hear me this morning blessed are they
[1:43:51] that mourn for the tying and they're
[1:43:54] crying They Mourn because there are sick
[1:43:56] people in the church that need to be
[1:43:58] healed but but you are not happy you are
[1:44:01] mour and I want this to be a house of
[1:44:03] mour this morning because Jesus is
[1:44:06] attracted to a house of mour he could
[1:44:08] only perform Resurrection in a house of
[1:44:11] mourning there could be no Resurrection
[1:44:14] in a house of sickness but in a house of
[1:44:16] mourning Jesus could step in and he
[1:44:18] could raise the dead there are people in
[1:44:21] the church this morning that are dead
[1:44:23] so this is the house of mour for those
[1:44:25] that have given up a long time ago their
[1:44:28] bodies are here but their Spirits are
[1:44:30] messed up but in this house of mour I
[1:44:33] believe Jesus is in the building he has
[1:44:35] stepped into the building and we are
[1:44:37] throwing the unbelief out oh can I get a
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:43] witness
[1:44:45] hall
[1:44:47] hallelujah
[1:44:49] hallelujah spiritual mourning is sorrow
[1:44:52] over our sins against God spiritual
[1:44:55] mourning is sorrow because we haven't
[1:44:57] prayed enough spiritual mourning is
[1:45:00] sorrow because we haven't cried enough
[1:45:03] spiritual mourning is sorrow because we
[1:45:05] have not desperate to see the Holy Ghost
[1:45:08] pour out spiritual morning is when we
[1:45:11] come to the Altar and say Lord I'm sorry
[1:45:14] Lord I'm broken up Lord I've lost
[1:45:16] everything and I'm willing to lose more
[1:45:18] but I'm mourning this morning my pride I
[1:45:21] want my pride to die I'm calling a time
[1:45:24] of morning I'm calling a funeral for
[1:45:26] Pride I'm calling a funeral for lust I'm
[1:45:29] calling a funeral for Envy I'm calling a
[1:45:32] funeral oh you don't hear me this
[1:45:34] morning it's a house of mour there could
[1:45:36] be no Revival unless something dies
[1:45:39] there's got to be a debt something's
[1:45:41] going to die this morning fornication
[1:45:44] got to die adultery got to die oh you
[1:45:47] don't hear me this morning a house of
[1:45:49] mourning we're going to kill every evil
[1:45:51] spirit we're going to kill your flesh
[1:45:54] we're going to kill your mind battles we
[1:45:56] are going to kill doubt this will be a
[1:45:58] house of mourning because when God comes
[1:46:00] in to resurrect you what will come out
[1:46:03] is a living faith a living virtue a
[1:46:06] living knowledge a living
[1:46:09] Temperance can I get an amen in the
[1:46:12] house a house of mour a house of mour a
[1:46:17] house of mour there are all kinds of
[1:46:19] houses there are houses that are houses
[1:46:21] of laughter but this morning morning is
[1:46:23] a house of mourning there are times that
[1:46:25] the Deep stuff is talked about but we
[1:46:27] need more crying we need more sighing we
[1:46:30] need more soul searching we need more
[1:46:32] travail we need more dying out we need
[1:46:36] more giving up we need more surrender we
[1:46:39] need more letting go we need more giving
[1:46:41] up uh we need more breaking up we need
[1:46:44] more breaking up the follow ground we
[1:46:47] need to have a house a house of mourning
[1:46:50] because only through death we could live
[1:46:52] uh Jesus had to die he had to die so we
[1:46:55] can see resurrection power and he said
[1:46:58] because I live you are going to live
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:04] also Hallelujah you may be
[1:47:08] seated the house hallu of morning I was
[1:47:12] asking my wife if she knows or if she
[1:47:15] knew what the term awake comes from you
[1:47:19] know you say when somebody passes on you
[1:47:21] have to attend awake
[1:47:24] yeah and that term wake brother Clarence
[1:47:27] comes from years ago before there were
[1:47:31] medical professionals who would
[1:47:33] pronounce that somebody was
[1:47:35] dead there were many times centuries ago
[1:47:38] brother kangali where people would be
[1:47:40] unconscious people would be in a
[1:47:42] temporary coma and they would bury them
[1:47:45] or start to bury them or start a funeral
[1:47:48] for them and these people while they
[1:47:50] about to throw dirt over them they would
[1:47:52] wake wake
[1:47:55] up so when somebody passed on they would
[1:47:59] say let's wait three or four days just
[1:48:03] in case they wake up so that we don't
[1:48:06] make the mistake we made the last time
[1:48:09] you know what I love about God God makes
[1:48:10] sure and remove every
[1:48:12] doubt he makes sure and remove every
[1:48:15] room for the enemy so whereas somebody
[1:48:17] could have said but jra's daughter what
[1:48:20] if she was in a coma what if she was
[1:48:23] unconscious so Jesus runs away from a
[1:48:27] village because he had had some words
[1:48:29] with some of the
[1:48:30] Believers so the Bible said he couldn't
[1:48:32] go back there where Martha Mary and
[1:48:35] Lazarus were living so when they told
[1:48:38] him Jesus Lazarus is sick he say don't
[1:48:41] worry about
[1:48:42] it but then he came back and said but
[1:48:44] Jesus Lazarus is
[1:48:47] dead Jesus know they are mourning the
[1:48:50] death of Lazarus they really not on him
[1:48:52] amen so Jesus comes back and in this
[1:48:56] time brother Gideon they couldn't say
[1:48:58] Lazarus wake up they couldn't say he was
[1:49:02] unconscious because they all knew for
[1:49:04] days he was in the Tomb they knew
[1:49:07] Lazarus was stinking so it couldn't be
[1:49:10] awake it couldn't be unconscious it
[1:49:11] wasn't revived it wasn't it wasn't that
[1:49:14] this man was gone and Jesus comes to the
[1:49:17] house of morning and they have the ceks
[1:49:20] the coffee the biscuit the everybody is
[1:49:22] sad and he says one question where have
[1:49:25] you laid
[1:49:27] him take me to the place where you laid
[1:49:29] him where have you laid the problem
[1:49:32] where have you laid the situation take
[1:49:33] me to the problem I can't fix it where
[1:49:35] I'm at right now take me to where the
[1:49:36] problem is and they took Jesus to the
[1:49:39] problem he said roll away the stone roll
[1:49:43] away I don't want any hindrance because
[1:49:44] I'm about to perform some surgery in the
[1:49:47] house of mour people all now watching
[1:49:49] they're looking and say what Jesus up to
[1:49:51] there he goes again and Jesus stood
[1:49:53] there and said
[1:49:55] Lazarus come forth and brother here
[1:49:58] comes a man who they know was dead who
[1:50:02] didn't know for days he locked up didn't
[1:50:04] know he wasn't in church for a long time
[1:50:06] didn't know he missed Sunday service
[1:50:10] they know he wasn't there for the
[1:50:11] Revival and this man start to come
[1:50:13] outside this man start to move
[1:50:16] outside as best as he could because he
[1:50:19] was still tied up and they said lose
[1:50:22] that man and let him go set him free
[1:50:25] because he has a reason to shout he has
[1:50:27] a reason to Rejoice
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:31] Hallelujah and I say this morning if God
[1:50:34] could raise a man who was not just dead
[1:50:37] but was already rotten in his flesh a
[1:50:39] man who was already going a man who was
[1:50:41] already gone and he could raise him up
[1:50:43] how much more could God give a spiritual
[1:50:46] Resurrection to Sons and Daughters of
[1:50:48] the Living

[1:51:26] weakness but the B said then God can
[1:51:28] achieve his purpose by sending not a
[1:51:30] Revival but listen carefully but brother
[1:51:33] what he needs to do first first before

[1:57:51] Bible said there was so astonished Jesus
[1:57:53] knew their mind was blown out he said
[1:57:55] don't even tell nobody it don't even
[1:57:57] make sense trying to tell nobody because
[1:57:59] what I did for you it's for you it's an
[1:58:01] individual Affair that at that time was
[1:58:04] not for everybody and God in the upper
[1:58:06] room he pulls some men aside and they
[1:58:09] were dying out dry seeds in the upper
[1:58:12] room that same Peter who had cursed that
[1:58:16] same Peter who had backslid he was dying
[1:58:19] out for 50 days in the upper room dying
[1:58:22] out until there was no more Peter until
[1:58:25] and there was a day of mour then all of
[1:58:27] a sudden when Peter was dead and James
[1:58:30] was dead and there was no more flesh and
[1:58:32] there was no more personality there was
[1:58:34] no more agenda there was no more big me
[1:58:37] little you there was no more arm in the
[1:58:39] ministry there was no more of that Mary
[1:58:42] had no chip on her soul when everybody
[1:58:44] was dead when everybody had died out
[1:58:47] when the day of morning had come when
[1:58:49] everybody was us
[1:58:53] H you may be seated you may be seated I
[1:58:57] want to get this
[1:59:02] right when God visited lot via the
[1:59:07] angels and told them come out of Sodom
[1:59:10] but whatever you do don't look back it
[1:59:14] was a day of mourning it was a day of
[1:59:16] death they were being killed and they
[1:59:19] had the opportunity to let what was in
[1:59:22] die with what was behind
[1:59:24] [Applause]
[1:59:27] them let me say that again they had the
[1:59:31] opportunity to let what was in them die
[1:59:34] with what was behind them because they
[1:59:37] had left the world they were already
[1:59:38] outside of Sodom you you don't hear me
[1:59:40] this
[1:59:42] morning Sodom was already behind them
[1:59:44] denomination was already behind them
[1:59:46] their P was already behind them they
[1:59:48] were walking out of Sodom they were
[1:59:50] walking into Glory they were walking
[1:59:52] into the
[1:59:53] deliverance and they had the opportunity
[1:59:56] to let what was in them die with what
[1:59:58] was behind them lot he did it he killed
[2:00:02] what was in him and did not look back
[2:00:05] the daughters killed what was in them
[2:00:07] and did not look back but Lot's wife she
[2:00:11] was out but she was still tied she was
[2:00:14] out but she was still connected she was
[2:00:16] out but there was still something alive
[2:00:18] in her that was not of God so she turned
[2:00:21] back
[2:00:24] this morning I say kill the past and
[2:00:27] kill whatever is in you that God hasn't
[2:00:29] want there that's why we come boldly
[2:00:32] this morning on this day of mour that
[2:00:34] Spirit of lust it's
[2:00:36] dead in the name of Jesus
[2:00:40] Christ whatever it is that Spirit of
[2:00:43] backsliding we come against it this
[2:00:45] morning in the name of Jesus Christ that
[2:00:48] Spirit of cancer of sickness of disease
[2:00:52] a female condition I don't care what it
[2:00:54] is we come against it in the name of the
[2:00:57] Lord Jesus Christ House of Hell give way
[2:01:00] to the name of Jesus you are not wanted
[2:01:03] here you have no place in this house
[2:01:11] [Applause]
[2:01:27] hallu
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:37] h no turning back no turning back we're
[2:01:42] not going back we're not going back
[2:01:46] we're not going back to the old ways
[2:01:48] we're not going back to the old you
[2:01:49] we're not going back to the old ways
[2:01:54] you may be
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:01:58] seated I look forward to meeting
[2:02:02] Lazarus because it's impossible for you
[2:02:05] to go through what Lazarus went through
[2:02:07] and be the
[2:02:14] same a couple weeks ago I believe a few
[2:02:17] days ago I put something on on my
[2:02:20] Facebook page I said a man who's on his
[2:02:22] dead bed he doesn't ask for a book on
[2:02:25] mathematics he doesn't ask for a book on
[2:02:28] science doesn't ask for a book in
[2:02:30] theology he asks for the
[2:02:34] book The Only book that matters because
[2:02:38] he comes to
[2:02:40] confront the reality of his
[2:02:43] life death is not an easy thing natural
[2:02:47] and spiritual is still
[2:02:48] hard people don't want to die
[2:02:59] God Hallelujah the death of a corn of
[2:03:03] wheat people don't want to let go of
[2:03:06] themselves let go of their
[2:03:08] Ambitions let go of their
[2:03:10] desires let go of their perspectives let
[2:03:14] go of their dreams and Ambitions and God
[2:03:17] loves to crush our dreams and our
[2:03:20] Ambitions because he is not sharing your
[2:03:23] heart with anything
[2:03:25] else he wants all or
[2:03:27] nothing that's good there's no middle
[2:03:30] ground that's why the Bible say I rather
[2:03:31] you hot or you cold but that middle walk
[2:03:35] you want to walk where on Sunday You Are
[2:03:38] Holy and on Monday you are less Holy by
[2:03:40] Tuesday you're not sure if you're
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:47] holy but when you begin to die out to
[2:03:50] yourself it's it's really amazing about
[2:03:53] the wisdom in the house of
[2:03:56] morning the older you get certain things
[2:04:00] begin to just lose its
[2:04:04] attraction after you live for a certain
[2:04:06] amount of
[2:04:07] years the car and the house
[2:04:11] and it doesn't it's not as important
[2:04:14] anymore the car becomes an object to
[2:04:17] take you from one place to the
[2:04:20] other because when you get closer to the
[2:04:22] end of your road because Solomon was
[2:04:25] bringing the wisdom to say the end of
[2:04:27] all men is De so take wisdom in the
[2:04:30] house of morning because when you reach
[2:04:33] that point you're not really worrying
[2:04:35] how much cylinders is in the
[2:04:38] engine it's not that important
[2:04:41] anymore the question that you ask is
[2:04:45] what
[2:04:45] will I re be what will I be remembered
[2:04:50] for sometime ago
[2:04:52] I I spoke at the home of someone who had
[2:04:54] passed on and I preached very short
[2:04:57] message called remember
[2:04:59] me and I took it from the text of the
[2:05:02] thieves who were next to Jesus on the
[2:05:06] cross and Jesus is day hanging in a
[2:05:08] cross and these two thieves are having a
[2:05:12] conversation Hallelujah and one of them
[2:05:16] said Remember
[2:05:18] Me amen and Jesus responds to him is
[2:05:21] today
[2:05:22] you will be with
[2:05:24] me I said those are two powerful words
[2:05:27] Hallelujah remember me and I ask the
[2:05:30] question how do you want to be
[2:05:33] remembered there are some people who are
[2:05:35] not
[2:05:37] remembered yeah because in the tapestry
[2:05:39] of Life they have left no
[2:05:41] marks
[2:05:43] yeah they have left not one life has
[2:05:47] been influenced or touched in any way
[2:05:49] Hallelujah but look at the life of Jesus
[2:05:52] so many years after look at the life of
[2:05:53] Peter so many years after James John
[2:05:56] Moses Noah we don't even need to know
[2:05:58] his surname just Noah and you know who
[2:06:00] I'm talking about Moses you know who I'm
[2:06:02] talking about their lives have left a
[2:06:05] mark on us that we could look back and
[2:06:08] glean how will you be remembered
[2:06:10] Hallelujah that's when you meet Daniel
[2:06:13] and he says tell me about you I know you
[2:06:15] heard about
[2:06:16] me what will they say about you how will
[2:06:20] you be remembered
[2:06:22] [Music]
[2:06:25] will he be remembered as a prayer
[2:06:27] Warrior just like Daniel Daniel I took
[2:06:30] inspiration from you and I prayed every
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:35] day will I be remembered like Jesus at
[2:06:37] age 12 we're not reaching Jesus in his
[2:06:40] adul just at age 12
[2:06:42] confounding the men in the in the temple
[2:06:45] at age
[2:06:47] 12 how would you be remembered
[2:06:53] we're still in a house of
[2:06:55] mour this
[2:06:57] morning and I pray that when we leave
[2:07:00] this house of morning that we can leave
[2:07:02] here with a renewed life A Renewed Zeal
[2:07:06] A Renewed passion to know the word a
[2:07:08] passion to please God and we would leave
[2:07:11] this Tabernacle this morning with the
[2:07:13] old you
[2:07:14] buried that's good that's good buried
[2:07:17] never to be taken up
[2:07:19] again and you have the opportunity today
[2:07:22] to be a real Christian and to sing that
[2:07:24] song Lord I want to be a
[2:07:26] Christian in my
[2:07:29] heart we allow the things of the world
[2:07:32] to Cloud us and to take up our time and
[2:07:34] to take up our energy and take our Zeal
[2:07:36] and we don't even talk to God
[2:07:39] enough Lord help us this morning can the
[2:07:43] church say
[2:07:45] [Applause]

[2:07:55] believe this is Brother Bram he's seen
[2:07:58] the resurrection of Lazarus he's talking
[2:07:59] about
[2:08:02] Jesus so when Jesus said our friend
[2:08:04] Lazarus sleep
[2:08:06] it Jesus said he do it well then he told
[2:08:09] him in plain words he's dead but I love
[2:08:10] this he said and I'm glad I wasn't there
[2:08:13] but I go wake
[2:08:14] him he knew what the father had told him
[2:08:17] to do so he said I go wake him and away
[2:08:20] he started back
[2:08:22] and when Lazarus was getting sicker and
[2:08:24] sicker and they sent for him oh how
[2:08:26] discouraging but said they would have
[2:08:27] felt they sent for the pastor to come
[2:08:29] pray for them they left the church they
[2:08:32] left everything to follow this man this
[2:08:33] Divine healer and no hopes of him coming
[2:08:36] he just went on ignored their message
[2:08:38] what a dark hour and the first thing you
