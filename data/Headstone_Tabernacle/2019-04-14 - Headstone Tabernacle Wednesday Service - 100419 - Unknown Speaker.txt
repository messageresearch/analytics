and read first epistle of Peter chapter 2 First Epistle of Peter chapter 2 and want to read from three to eight and it says if so be have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in a scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but under them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made ahead of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereon to also they will appoint it and got a blessing amen amen praise Lord hallelujah glory to God let us bow our heads on a prayer Almighty God Father we are gathered in your name to worship in the beauty of holiness all yeah depending upon your tonight to walk all the pages of the Bible and the come and speak lip dear to us what may take note of the we take most of the five senses out of the humanistic Lord there a mine of Christ robbed on the right thing be said in the right can be done that we could - in your blessings Lord caught me anoint believers knowing their feet to believe and they will see themselves in the world and see you promise we make manifest unto them love me a common filled with the Holy Ghost come and see come on he come and deliver come only five incher and why acid tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen may obvious eats well I want to conclude from Sunday Sunday I didn't finish because time was against me so I'm with the same taught the stone that the builders disallowed don't look at me look to the wood because God is making love this bright the prophet said is tell Allah the love secrets and the things he has to get applause after himself before she leaves here so the word is becoming so simple that you could recognize decrease of God towards your life and the love of God towards you now this stone that we're speaking about this rejected stone had been prophesied way back in the Old Testament before the temple was built David as a prophet and Sam's 1:18 identify the stone that the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner Solomon temple was not built but David in the spirit he had a revelation of this rejected stone and all through the Old Testament and the new Christ is that rejected stone and in this last day crisis comte's body and has been rejected the Prophet said that the Church of God is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ then he went further the Sarah Church of what is built upon the revelation of the word of God in its season the career deeper because Jesus Christ is the word of God but the word of God comes in season so God is giving out a special menu this season you have to hook up with this menu you have to eat from this menu to be in the Church of God so the Prophet identified the life that was in justification when on to make sanctification the life of us in sanctification went on to make the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the life in the Pentecostals went on to make the seed would to bring forth Christ the life passed through the stages so to be in the Church of God in the days of Wesley you had to be sanctified to be in the body you had to have a revelation of sanctification that would be your confession in the days of the Pentecostals you have to receive the holy spirit of promise for that day to be in the body but the prophet common revealed the fullness of the Holy Spirit the life that passed to the seven churches because when the body of the bride of Jesus Christ has been built through the seven church edges from Ephesus to audition no light never shone on that building nobody had a crew got a sapling when John when the seals was open the Prophet said John so what God was sending for the church for time he strike in symbol form all he saw was an antichrist spirit readin he never saw the life that was combating the Antichrist spirit he never saw the tunnels that was shaking the devil in every age so he saw a white horse he saw a red horse a black horse and a pillow before living creatures they were guarding the blade in every age they were guarding the pride of Jesus Christ but Panem said this is Jesus Christ in bright form so when John saw him walking through the seven golden candlesticks instead he saw one like unto the Son of Man and brother branham said that was Jesus Christ in platform because Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the bride is the mystery of Christ's real so Christ is revealing his wife he's revealing his bride because Adam had Eve's locked up in him and Christ had the bride locked up in him so God put Adam to sleep and took out a ribbon and bring the feminine love spirit out of Adam and put it in that body and that was Eve and she fell God but Jesus asleep on the cross and water blood and spirit came on from his side those were the elements to make up the bride to the seventh which itches but nobody knew about it nobody knew about it but the seventh angel he was commissioned to reveal the mystery of God and to reveal all the mystery of God for the eruption of the church so when God given the revelation of the seven angels coming from eternity but a Branham recognized it was the coming of Christ he said the angel with the cut back wings is Christ the covenant angel the one hole in this different seal and he said he couple of the three full revelation of a short of voice the truth and he unfold the mystery of the shout only coming down to the end of his ministry so the people that were a world where abandon did not have a revelation of the Son of Man the new brother branham was a prophet but they did not have the revelation of the son of man that was revealed to them it was a son of man within public dissing of man and it didn't have that revelation that referee was will reveal only to his bride he said only the elected going to see that so what elected you in this generation to see this mystery because you as lively stones are built up a spiritual house for the habitation of the spirit not dead stones lively stones and we have to fit around a headstone so watch when Berta Brennan spoke in since is this the time they identified that message as seven thunders in court and simplicity in Albuquerque New Mexico he said you have heard my message the seven thunders says is this so he labeled that message seven thunders it was in that message the Lord spoke double poolman tell him go and start the church on the 6th of January 1963 that pastors preach on the 30th of December 1962 but a Branham preach a message call a greater than Solomon is here and he was letting the people see the gift that word least in Solomon all of Israel gathered around that gift and they were blessed the nation was addressed and the world was blessed and the Queen of Sheba went to City gift and he was saying that God has sent the Holy Ghost in this generation he was showing them that that same gift which is greater not quest Christ in the headstone is now filled in him performing the same wood and did not gathering around it and he said in Asia a check was difficult to be judged in that message he said for years we have had the Word of God but now we have the god of the world in our midst he identified God himself it snow in the midst of the people but it wasn't seen it because there wasn't or didn't to see it because on the 7c morning he tell em you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it and the builders rejected so listen he preached a message called the way of a true prophet in that message he identified the Prophet Amos coming down to Samaria and he said let us suppose Amos will come here no today what will he see and he blasts all the Pentecostals he said the same God you claimed yes it was good to destroy you in that message he identify he has a message to preach to the ministers you gotta gotta be ministers to preach this message so when he preached the message indictment that message was not for just believers that message was specifically for ministers he said he will send and notify the ministers during that message was a whole lot of Ministers was gathered together for that message but it is God in the prophet knew the spirits that was operating the ban on tominaga so the Prophet sin and informative pull maneuver the hunt he's going to ordain them in that meeting at the come for ordination so they came the Jeffersonville for ordination all the ministers are gathered for indictment and they are gathered for ordination so when they came procurement tools and fellow ministers how the Prophet is going to ordain him they laugh they make fun out of it be perfect with all the already profitable for the no ministers for the longest wine but here is two colored men same chord is greater all T in them so but a parent comes the pulpit he never informed his elders and his associate ministers in the tabernacle that his greet or D in these two colored men because he knew the spirits that was operating in the church so he come to the tabernacle they talk about you sister happy right but I'm the sister that the second she going through menopause and who said - can you talk about the minister's welcome miss and many say he have two colored patron from New York City Tour de trop de palma each of the prominence of boom and then Paul for his angry son he had a lot of hobbies sweetie call and he call his ministry associate ministers LS the commonly hands upon them and two ministers were water within the car back because what abandom never ordained no colored ministers and the spirit upon these people if you let move her in front like we open a potential thing so here is here what discipline but a balance said he's ordained in these men and sent him forth so you're deemed but a pool man never a hunt then he preached the message indictment in the message except I am entitled all these ordained ministers for crucified the Lord Jesus Christ a second I am one minister said who is he speaking to other man say us us so he went and week all the ministers hide because they all had rejected the spoon of power the serpent under revelation this was in July the service just opening match because they reject what what's in he indict them but he sent out but a poor man about a haunted see we said them because they Anson to decry you see me a mesh be fruitful I may go attend to the foreign field and across the will listen at the end of that message he was pretty and he said lord I have I have invited all my fellow servants he identified what it did because they crucified you would he said where did they crucify we're getting more Spears from this one behind the pulpit behind the pulpit he blasts all the fun denominational system but he passed administers that was around him because they wasn't following in line with what was taking place so when the seventh under revelation came forth it was a war a spiritual disturbance as spiritual the statement was false but it always happens that way because it's rejected tool when God said the open door and a Philadelphian age and the people came out Azusa Street all these secular churches came together and held a meeting to try to cut it off oh no and I start having Street meetings to prevent their people from going to Azusa Street but what was anointed people to live all part of the states and traveled Azusa Street to receive the apportion these people were sanctified God was selling the Baptist money hooli goes upon a sanctified life not upon planted word was a sanctified life so people explained by trade and it was so sanctified that sometimes asked a step of the treat on the platform because equality of course committed four city blocks away this is just four eleven repower good you're not the wisdom up and ceremony we walk in to go to Azusa Street because they were so sanctified and sanctified life always attracts the Holy Ghost so you as an individual have to be in a sanctified condition you must come in here on a sanctified condition to attract the Holy Ghost the common baptized you cannot become in here any all how in the house of God you have to come under expectation with your life right a sanctified life to attract God Holy Spirit the baptized because you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is what the builders refused this is what they build us in the message of all refused because for the Branum identified the messages are super sign that God is going to send the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of the denominational churches and when the Alexus unwanted are going to be a super-sized and you did that in 83 and the whole message will reject it they say they're going back to Pentecost you see if people only grown the grammatical of Pentecost and try it out here the administer them said what is this persisters for Negro not to put on them this elk hunting they were after Pentecost we have the world but whatever Bannon says they recheck the acts 2:38 screaming Halloween young ones the only type the word going to bring forth it happens what nothing else these are birds is a mess we're in a pigpen whopping decorators hospital it is a mess and you must be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire listen prapannam said the messenger of malachi fo and revelation 10 7 is to do two things I want us tonight to analyze he holds admit he make impacts you're going to see awkward hide here officially seven thunders right here he say the messenger of Malachi 4 attend several two things right in that statement he is identifying that Malachi 4 verse intent 7 is the same person and his routing is a 1 according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children back to the feet of the fathers and reveal the seven thunders of Revelation 10 92 things and anyone to see he's dull describing what is antennas are he says in Revelations contained in the seven seas so in revealing the seven thunders of Russia in Tennessee they are the revelations contained in these seven seals she cannot leave the series can't leave the world and one that says these divinely revealed basic truths but that surely turned the hats returned back to the faith three fathers JJ , analyze the whole sentence be messenger of Malachi for understand servants do one thing one thing reveal the seven thunders of Elisha 10 because once he revealed the 700 revelation 10 is this revelation with the Teri Hatcher and back to the faith of the others so it's not that cool things is supposed to do is wanting reveal the revelation of the seven thunders which are the revelations contained in the seven seals right there he hid the mystery of the seven voices of these seven Church ages in simplicity they couldn't see it because it was so simple God hiding in simplicity and revealing himself in the same listen other experience 2009 in 2009 14 of us went to Jeffersonville we visited the butter problems tomb there's a big pyramid deal on the tomb and there are the seven churches there's this Commission a hula things written on different sides a - after we came back we went to a Chinese restaurant to eat buffet style so I was my first master cleaning so I went to collect my food and sat down there next to my wife Timmy cleared me both rivers Community Giving last they went to not separate people when Tim is Waldoboro sanitary went to them so the brothers are fellowshiping on the table and one brother make a statement about the fact that the seven virtues is not written on the tombstone of the Prophet when he made that statement I said in my heart I don't agree with that he should not have said that and God was pleased with what I said and the Holy Spirit started speaking to me so I just bend my head off my plate my knife and I'm listening to a still small voice speaking to me hear what the Lord said he said brother Branham placed before choose in the pyramid not on the pyramid it is the mystery of the life that was sealed in the seven church ages this is the mystery the poor abandoned took his grave and to this day it remains a secret he said this is the secret the periban took to his grave and to this day it remains a secret that was thus saith the Lord the secret was the life of these seven virtues that was inside the pyramid not on the pyramid so any better sort of tools which was written on the pyramid he made a statement I shall never meet so hold hidden the life of Christ in the pyramid that is why the Prophet said it is the guides duty to lead us from poor formalities and things into the glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue didn't see fit you see where there is virtue knowledge temporary writer and the Holy Ghost itself because the Holy Ghost comes the seal your feet at the bottom of the pyramid faith is the seed that God needs you so listen at one time but a Branham was walking in the stature of a perfect man but it did not have Pirelli kindness he was in godliness he was here in asleep like wood and doing things like God but he didn't have but early kindness he went into a restaurant and he saw a lady in a short pass with a toenail paint up with two men and fainting and decided say lower wider wipe this off the face of youth is decided to go up in inventing and a hand touch him an eternal and cried me back and watch through him his sins going up and Jesus right pardon potentia forget entreat guidance Baptist and I forgive you what you condemned in the lady so dear he got a revelation of the Father's kindness the quality burley kindness is not really your kindness honour is the father's - being expressed through you so you had a revelation of the Father's kindness now we had to quote out a testy revolution so he tell him a trap is set for you and he sent two people to church to make love and butter Panama's on the pulpit sweatin and his preaching I said don't do that he say call upon indifferent he said this is also calling the Lord tell him there in your hands whatever you see that is it if they say that if we say buying divine whatever you say God is testing this revelation of the Father's Agnes call is tested his revelation of bronchitis because were to come with charity the person of Christ is what coming next so he said I forgive you we say God was pleased he said dear acting so the power God came down upon them and conviction and repentance because he spoke the rantings I forgive you so now he is standing on the seventh step you call for a balancer when they reach up there the chance of comes out to challenge the comma to command the presence of the king so we have to give all diligence to at our feet virtue and knowledge temperance and patience and godliness all these things have to be in us that will be sealed with charity so this stone that the builders rejected is the same stone is this same story with the seven virtues because when Burakumin identified the seven thunders are the seven voices of the seven church ages which are seven manifestations of God holy spirit into the church as faith and the voice hood when the voice he identifies how the spirit was operating in the church as it was a life that was thundering and they rejected the builders rejected but they could only be in the church as a member of the body by the revelation the Word of God in its season so but abiram identified in since the time he said the seven seals are the set of the manifestations of the seven angels of the seven churches the life that was manifested it's no guard up in the southern man hear what he said I am the happiest man in the world for God to show me this that deceived went to the processes and come back to seed again so on the top by the pyramid of loud Isha Hezbollah Pan Am standing on the top of the pyramid with the seed would Christ veiled in him the life path to the stitches and is now fill in the man he says so hard you to get it separated it's not his son of man himself but this is Son of Man reveals buddy Solomon because the work is all fear in his flesh he said there was fine and fault with the man who was the woman who subscribes he's not a fine and fault with the word working truth man the people didn't recognize the headship to the body but abandon preach a message Christ the mystery of God revealed in that message we identify the headship which describes himself is know at the head of the body detergent they identify all the mysteries from FSS tell Alicia is no car up in the Sun among all the mischievous card up in him so what was happening the seven thunders was wrapped up in the Prophet as a seed so you had to get the seed of seven thunders in you to be in the Church of God in its season because the seven thunders is Jesus Christ when God came down among Sinai teacher of Israel there was thunder lightning and voices each other says totally both speak lest we die the shaking the boots yet they mounted on fire and got thundering go tell Moses the people have rightly spoken he no longer speak to them like that so what God did he happy thunders in a still small voice the heavy thunders in the prophets and brother branham speaking about it he said when the truth anointed of God speak it is the voice of God to reject it is remove the candlestick so these seven stars was the voice of God when Jesus aquiline said to the edge of sadhas here he said unto the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he and have these seven spirits of God and whole the seven stars once great going to each time because the star is the messenger and the Spirit is the Holy Ghost and mounting the messenger for the age to bring the word for the edge so that lovely voice Accord to the edge but I bound say I am the voice of God to you but a ballon tool is follow she wouldn't leave them took for good and they still didn't believe it when he got an accent they still looking for him too recently did we already tell them because they did not have a revelation Jesus own disciples didn't know who he was coming down to the end of his ministry say who do men say I is son of man they talk all what men say they're in service who do you say I am they did not know Peter received the revelation though are the Christ the Son of the Living God when Jesus died and rose from the dead they still like Alice in Wonderland they had new revelation when he success came and tell them that he is risen they say the words were like idle tears they couldn't believe it Jesus on the road to Emmaus had to rebuke them fools and slow of heart to believe all that is really possible this time concerning Christ these were men that was with Christ for three and a half years they fished with him eat with him sleep with him all about they went with him and is never a friend of who he was and that is the same thing that happened in this generation with whatever to prove how these people didn't know who he was but a banner on the THC he identified Chuck no Chuck boy was a better band from the look he saw the dead raised in Finland USDA he was in Mexico when the dad was really Korriban tend to put a jack you gonna pray for the lady she don't know you would he see you a lot he was D and here Bronson he believe I am God's prophet to the Sun he if you check him at the Sheep would see reason but I am always by Jack but listen underneath didn't see you but I wanna identify Jack more Knightly people's hairless coven he said all the right and said God sent us a prophet we did a prophet leader prophet then writing up people and telling gold and beg and gold to send them our prophet and the prophet present tense with them but a brand I eat with him I know his wife is cook in whom attending and they still couldn't see who he was dinkum if you look about Joseph Busey he loved the Prophet the Prophet was put out of a meeting because he was going and preached by brother Joseph bossy after a forensic convention when he went in the stadium Courtney Lindsay and Eve had the big meeting and they asked him I go and preach about abortion he says yes when I leave here tomorrow a grant proposal this was a cabbage and this convention he just drive out and the tele people didn't come but a boss they went to Kenya and open our school our producing ministers said emotion we feel and but our bosses didn't have a revelation of the baptism in jesus christ name for all these years but a brand said he was why the hardest person to see that and if you believe our brand our prophet and the prophet is the voice of God you just have to accept where the prophets Father Son and Holy Ghost titles to the name it was in either 63 or 64 but they're bad porno but I'll choose the favor abandon Isabella Joseph if somebody comes to you and say there was baptized in the name of the rules or shine on the really valley and the brighter Melissa what will he do he shall baptize them over it is never far illegals Robespierre just did what they did because roses aren't real valid title surname father son Holy Ghost type adenosine his eyes pop open a bar brands he have to go back to Kenya and we baptize all these people as he baptized in Jesus name that was 564 the cattle evil evil join me parent camp Kevin and 53 in Miami and it came back in 57 hours to them only time doctrine even doctor revealed he was only baptized and 63 in Jesus Christ name he was the creator of our brand speak about and these are men are only prophet only one minister hood confessed that he miss dishonor man that is what Eddie bisque at the bicycle testify of the kind of experiences he had with the Prophet hunting and fishing he was in the car when the injured came in the car all but I Bambi instead of Street and then the most commonly Road well I said me ok ok a moose and he should be moves and faintings and he said in a speech and you say but I miss this son of man and when he spoke those words you can see the hurt in his heart that he misses and he did all Canada profit and he missed the resolution of this son of man that he was with so all these people did not have a revelation of what was taking place right around them and as the same thing today is the exact same thing today he identified that they reject the builders we checked the baptism of the holy spirit today in this message people not looking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say when they believe I was with a better talk in my actual Holy Ghost you see when you believe this message residually goes fine after I said how did but abandon receive the Holy Ghost he said brother branham received the Holy Ghost that we because the Word of God wasn't open up yet but since the Word of God has been open up once you receive the wizard you received the baptism of the universe and they believe a lie and be damned by the copper bomb blast that Baptist doctrine for all the years was a neat he blasted you understand since you believe not when you believe since you believe so you have to get the Holy Ghost by and experience I spoke another burden you my testimony he told me his mother had an experience like that in Canada I said what about you experiences I mean I have received the baptism without sensation but the banner in speaking with the mysteries once you have spoken at the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did when us here they really should hop on chat ECU unison but he never had an experience a bribe answer must have an experience to have the illegals you must have an experience to have the Holy Ghost lister friends you that believed this revelation is a rejected sooner we are called to become the headstone so watch the common of the Lord is the capstone coming down so the pyramid at the bottom here prapannam identify chord as the white light and condescend to the earth he said the foolish Erie was the real Fred that is the long way that's healed he said when your red sins come under the red blood it comes white when the community red light it comes white so the foolish waiter hit the earth the real red doan feet and science and scientists discover that we right under the red yes another light infrared that could see to darkness so this real light came down in the earth with all the darkness of sin and see all the elected progresses and seeds and pull them out by that tree and fit them into that slot but a banham said these tools were for ordained of God the Phaeton each slot from Ephesus tell Alicia [Applause] think of it but we not initial changes he said the messenger comes at the end of the age blast the agents open another age but a Branham the last the audition is important a bright age or the age of adoption and it never knows nothing about it because it's not written and it was under the Seventh Seal that is in silence so we have been called out from loud isha to enter into the bride age to go back to god the white light reflected itself into the seven colours it got to go back to white light the only way it could go back to white light doctor pass to another pyramid in physics in physics they take a prison and take white light and pass it to again all these seven colors from a genocide then I take another prison the other side and you get all the seven colors pass really bring about the white light God is light and Himmler darkness what I put on the same principle so the life that was in the 70s ages was all gathered up in this son of man and he sodomized is so ugly conceded and he saw a sea containing seven part native Almighty God and sealed containing seven thunders and no it has to pass through another prison that is why the Holy Ghost lot is there because um above that is the white light the capstone of love so the bride have to claim the Holy Ghost slit by this route request you have this seventh under seed that was in the seventh which ages which is the same seven spirits of God have to come back no to the white light to hit the capstone so here are the Prophet says the professor after we have added or fearful to our knowledge and temples he said is this the mystery of the thunders that brings back the headstone if it is they have several messengers that was song is for to the 78 ages that they thought to bring back the fourth to bring behind if it is then the seven thunders kept the pyramid the seven thunders captain permit and the holy ghost lot and the builders and caretakers rejected they reject the headstone listen intrusion the professor the bride is an independent woman any message Christ is the mission of God with you he said the bride is an independent woman he says she is like this people build the blood he said this birdie kills speckled because they take the blood of the meat ran off the head and the sprinkled blood upon this building and the letter was justified and the blood was building wrong saying holy holy holy holy that's the speckled bird in the Bible and the song they sing they say all the other birds the flock is a cancer all the other birds are against the envy her fortune and fame because she been covered by the blood of a mate and the life is in the blood and the life is the life of Christ the life of seven lived voices the parcel of his need in jeffersonville is thousands of lives voices the thunder of God hundred and sweetness in purity and an undefined life that is the Thunder that shakes the devil the devil's don't care how magical shout how much a good holler but what hurt him is to see that life and he probably life back in the body is a vindication that the rapture is at hand so we got to see the life of Christ back in the body we gotta see signs murders and wonders accompanying the word in you to learn the life is back in the body because he promised to walk amongst us to heal the sick Teresa dared to open up recognize because your muscly conditions so called to be glorified and we magnify in the midst of his people so we have to be under such an expectation to see world walk in the temple suddenly suddenly this period of vodka just chopped down inside here and start the new things that with Marvel he will be mothered to see the live walk and the blind see court promise it and we are mountain it because the stone that the builders disallowed is become the headstone of the corner it is time for the headstone that come down in headstone Tabernacle you must be under that expectation you must be looking for the headstone to come and tap off the payment of your life this is what you have to be looking for to see the glory of God anything from you when I balance we got to bring the people in the presence of the living chord we got to have the presence of God within us where Anthony said the other night one is the maturity important one man taught is surrender to God is omnipotent God doesn't even a cold what did be holy goes to individuals you've got to recognize you got to get your individual portion you got to get your individual inheritance this is inheritance time this is time you to get your personal experience with the Holy Spirit this is time you have a positional birth into the body to be in the
