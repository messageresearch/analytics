the weaving hole hallelujah glory you must build your hopes up oh thank you [Music] hallelujah [Music] as you want to go into the word [Applause] hallelujah i'm going to go to matthew chapter 3 2 verses there was 16 and 17. john chapter 20 to verses there 21 and 22 and mark 16 verse 14 to 20. matthew 3 verse 16. and jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water although the heavens were open upon him and he saw the spirit of god be sounding like a dove lighting upon him and lure a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased or pleased to dwell in it's in john chapter 20 read verse 21 and 22. and then then said jesus to them peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send are you when he had said this he breathed on them and says unto them receive thee the holy ghost last scriptures are mark on reading from mark chapter 16 and you want to read from verse 14. afterward he appeared at 11 as they sat at meat and operated or rebuked them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into him and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen let's bow our heads forward i pray father we thank you for your presence and your power that we feel is among us right now and you promise where the twos and trees are gathered together you'll be nominated god you know the needs of their people minister to their needs and help them help us the bride bodies the sickest body on earth we pray virtue will go out of families to marriages to homes to the children to each represented here those that are connected to us and the internet may have blessed them also and may the spirit be released upon their lives in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god i have a title this morning anointed with god hallelujah i have a subject fully surrendered to god i have an inspiration ambassadors of the throne amen ambassadors of the throne an individual christian note my words christian not jewish member christian represent the kingdom of god amen you listen carefully as a christian amen represent god's kingdom amen amen amen hallelujah not your family not your kind [Music] the kingdom because what jesus come to preach was the kingdom amen he never tried to establish a church jesus church and oh no no he come to establish a kingdom he told him my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me hallelujah so he he was trying to bring them to a higher kingdom to a higher life to a higher thinking altogether he said i've heard an old past eiffel iron truth for tooth but i say unto you don't go down to that barbarian level don't go down to that i do and you let your nature be loosed i want to take it to another level because that nature is a higher one hallelujah that life is a higher life the law is for the lawless but i call you to hire by the power of grace to release you to get back to where you were before which is back to eden which is back to your sonship which is back to your culture which is back to your inheritance so the mind is a gateway to the soul that's why before you you do something it has to come true to your mind and by time it kept your heart you're caught because it's what somebody have in their heart their mouth could go this way but it's what they have in their heart so he said your mind open up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection so if your mind could shut down that you could say i don't you know if you don't feel the praise god this morning you shut that down so you don't even bother with your feelings you raise your hands and he hung up [Applause] you're feeling so good you're feeling sick you reject that and you put your feeling in one side you put your upside down he don't know what to think about you afterwards that can't handle you you see you want to come like moses when when when moses was finished with pharaoh moses pharaoh said take your flocks take your people take all take it and go hallelujah glory to god here man how many want to deal with the issues okay the lord that shout i'm not hearing that show you have to deal with it i'll say it and see it again and again until until it's stick you can't defeat what you're not prepared to confront let me say it again you can't defeat what you're not to prepare to confront you have to confront yourself look in the mirror and deal with you deal with your anger your temper your attitude your hastiness your impatience you lost deal with it [Music] oh come on now pirates you the disrespect deal with it you lose stone deal with it don't try to cover it over deal with it take the head of that dog off oh give the lord a shelter praise you're going to put your foot on the devil's neck you're going to put your foot in those shallowest times every power that banging you hinder you upset you you're gonna overcome you were raised up for that you were called for such a time as this [Applause] don't let the devil tell you otherwise oh you may be seated praise god my god i feel like i'm getting started the devil cannot get stronger all he is is the same old devil but we can come on now come on now if the lord has shouted in the halls [Applause] all right [Applause] so the battle rage since the garden of eden in the human mind is not even your battle because this battle started in heaven people want to die and go to heaven and there was war and there was one in heaven michael fought in a dragon fort battling heaven you know and then they kicked them demons out and it fell on the earth and the battle of angels became the battle of men oh and now here you tonight you are in between hell is below demons coming up heaven is on top angels coming down and you are in between what is influencing you this morning oh glory you may be seated and from every section releasing an anointing anointing from the law or anointing from above but today we're talking about being anointed with god [Applause] jesus use the word the spirit is upon me amen all right and the background that was chosen was a human mind because a human mind is where decisions are made friends you gotta forgive me but i love decisions i love to choose i love to know i am responsible for my choice i hate excuses i don't like excuses no more excuses you put the fire on the excuses it's because i see it's because i he and dempsey and this one no no no excuses you choose to love you choose to forgive you choose to repent you choose to hang in there i ask the song leader to sing hold to god's unchanging hand i choose that song this morning oh covet not this world's in riches that soon rapidly decay seek again the heavenly treasures they will never pass away hold the gods unchained i choose that movie season i didn't choose that because i all know when you see i'm going in my head since 17 years old i made that choice to serve god and put them first above money popularity and woman god first about family god first before this one and that god first above ministers preachers ministers association and all who think about what i have nothing to do with the thoughts of man man then call me man can't save me man i don't have a heaven they don't have a hell but god call you god save you glory to god hallelujah and god could justify you god has won the testifier god is the one that it don't look for no man to justify you [Applause] is there a shout in the house listen you may be seated you can be nice like joseph you will still be hated without a cause there are all people that don't like you so go play nice and i see for everybody somebody go hate it they don't know why they hate you they have anointing upon them because you are anointed on god joseph was a special man with a special son and so are you that's why god call you through hell and high water you're gonna make it because god could drop that anointing upon you oh hallelujah [Applause] glory to god [Applause] may be seated samson is presented as a man with big muscles and being like if he jumped pumping a gym but the truth was samson was a small little fella but some girly looking curl said seven of them you wouldn't believe what that man have in him until the anointing come upon him oh when the spirit of the lord comes upon my huh [Applause] oh you're getting me started you're getting started you're gonna be seated one time samson walk into a field at thousand philly stands the man don't have a weapon they might have no protection they might have no backups and the spirit of god come upon samson and samson took a jawbone oh hey man donkey jawbone and thompson take that jawbone put the anointing upon him the anointing upon it it has to be upon him and upon it because if the anointing is not upon you and upon it you wouldn't have the fear to take it to deal with them but when the anointing comes upon you whatever your touch wherever you put your foot by god whatever you do going to prosper because the anointing is upon you you are anointed with god [Applause] right now your depression leaving right now your frustration right now your sicknesses we curse every sickness in this building this morning come on we set you free we come against demon powers be your devil come out let my people go [Applause] [Applause] do i have hallelujah in the house [Applause] you see what you feel is what samson feel sounds like it came upon him he had no books he had no church he had no song leader he had nobody exhorting him he was one man that god called and god spoke to and put the covenant with seven lots oh glory to god as long as you keep that covenant i'm going to be with you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you even in you come on now we're looking for a church that gonna be anointed of god [Applause] [Music] cannot sin until he first cast aside god's word until first he gets rid of the word of god the presence of god he cannot sin thou why david said the lord is at my right hand i shall not be moved let me say it again he said the lord is on my right hand i shall not be moved and always david you should be practicing the presence of god that the glory is with him amen because when people feel the lord not there they want to do this they want to do that they want to do that they want to do that because the lord he's not that he's not seeing but they said the lord is at my right hand i shall not be moved oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why the bible says in the amount of two or three witnesses let everything be established so you can't just take a evil report about someone and there's no evidence or witnesses you'll be receiving an evil report isn't that right that's why if somebody offend you or something don't go and tell somebody go to that person suppose you're misinterpreting them like i give a reference one time you can see somebody come on that bar with some water or something some bottle a next minute report come he wasn't about drinking you didn't see him drinking that's right man that's right but there's a report but he put some car may have broken down and when they got some water upon the radiator but because it was seen that way and instead of verifying information somebody run with that and next minute he was drinking he was drinking a sim card that's assumption that's come saying like everything in the garage is a car but supposed to learn more there are four wheels it was in the garage that don't mean it's a car so you can't just take things like that you have to have a love for truth i want to say it again you have to have a love for truth not gossip not back now not just talk for truth because the truth is what sets people free but i can't give a testimony about the woman with the fried bread and he didn't finish it off he finished it off in london he's got the tape and we're going to put it on your website try to get it but he was telling the woman listen if the doctors take off your womb i think you i don't see you have the faith if you can't have faith for the fibers to be healed how you have faithfully for the room to be restored when they got a long story short the woman was healed totally and completely he said don't believe the facts the facts say you have five boys the fact is right you can't deny the facts but god is right god is a healer you see i want you to rise to the challenge to shake off your past you leave the life of the people they'll put you in a box because they might have fight that you're going ahead or you're going higher you're going further they will hinder you they will box you in so you can't bother with people trying to put boxes around you you have to study what god wants unfold in your very life amen you love him if this church know what something let me see if satan can get you here in these conscience and all these things if he gets right down in the soul in the mind you will never look at one of them things until first you let him in there you have to let him in or when he gets in he got control he began to use a conscience he began to use your the outlet which is your feel your taste your imagination your memory and whatnot he began to use his different channels see and he will batter you and it can't get to you until you accept it should come like this if the if the if the um post lady bring a package for you and and and and you see send from and have snakes in it and you had a sign for it and you know it snakes inside the day you'd have to sign for that tell the post lady i am not signing for that package whoever sent it take it back don't sign for cold fever cough disease sickness no sign i'm so sick oh god no no don't sign for that say i'm sealed just have to do something different talk different back again oh look at caleb here let me sign up for that praise god kill himself just as strong that's when i first pat it off and let the lord be with me i shall be able to die [Applause] you understand what caleb did there he has sit down with them all young young people oh god look how strong he is yesterday muscles he needs him every day i can't fight none and once you have fight he must have getting weak and weaker beginner putting young people to shame listen it was giants on the mountain there wasn't giants on the flat you know it's dancing among the other go up to meet them you know but but caleb was telling me coming up that's man that's my coming up turn your child tell your mountain you're coming up oh give the lord a show i'm coming up you know what the bible says caleb expelled the three sons of enoch he put them out time to put them out [Applause] every influence that come negatively to your life we're gonna throw it out i know some of you said the truth already take the bucket and destroy them out because the bible said in my name they shall cast out devils cast out notice they didn't say preachers gonna do that you know they said these signs come on now shall follow damn says them sit down sit down sit down damn dark believe me are you a believer or give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] and there's more to that the bible said the lord himself went everywhere in the kitchen don tong in the bus wherever you go you have escort the angel of the lord and camp around them that fear him don't be afraid i want to get the feel of your system praise god too much of fear [Applause] listen you could be fearing the wrong group and you're looking for the right group but i read for you there is no right group in the sense then that god has set no church up there's no certain organizational group can say we have it the resident doesn't have it that's a spirit you know that's right yeah that's the superior written thing if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one accord with not one shadow of doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there will be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what would receive it if you can get that certain thing fixed if i could change your mind i could change your behavior if the world could change your mind you could change your life but you have to want that change be transformed by the renewing of your mind your mind have to change before your heart to change that's why god start to write it's a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit inside your spirit what it is changing your mind changing your thoughts changing the desires amen and we said god invading your very life all right when jesus came on the scene god always vindicates the truth that's the reason today we can't have faith faith is not based upon man's theology faith is based upon the solid rock of god's eternal world before continue i want to say back something we talk about right spirit and wrong doctrine better than right doctrine and wrong spirit that's true but god didn't send a prophet for us to have right spirit and wrong doctrine he's in a prophet that we have the right spirit and right doctrine i want to nail that down so i'm not advocating this right spirit right spirit no no no god and a prophet with thus saith the lord and that prophet said the spirit the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the world you can't take away from it it's toxic of the lord hallelujah hallelujah so watch so jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he came to the earth here he was known of the day that john baptized him god vindicated him god spoke from the heavens john saw him coming down in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell the right translation here is in whom i am pleased to dwell in jesus immediately anointed with god amen amen he was just a man till that time now he becomes a god man [Music] so the anointing of god brings you to become one man a god man hallelujah you see god is a spirit and christ means the anointed one a man anointed with god oh give the lord some praises people and just as a man could be anointed with god a man could be anointed with the devil listen to this jesus was god he had a big job he went over to the meenak in gadara who has been a wild man for years a young fellow we were told had lost his human reasoning lived in tombs with an evil spirit what a place for a man to live in a graveyard is very fitting for the devil to be among dead things so he lived out there and was so terribly afflicted with these demons he broke chains his strength was here we go a super strength did you ever see a man that had been stricken by the evil spirit like that he is several times his strength i have noticed them in the meetings when groups of police couldn't even hold them they would tear them police to pieces and carry on because hey why he is fully surrendered to the evil one it took possession of him and had not his own understanding he only did what the evil spirit put in him to do then i taught with complete surrender to the devil a man can be five times his strength what could complete surrender to god do to a man what would it do to that's weak in the body that can't walk if we could completely yield to the holy ghost god will give us a super strength to rise in the name of jesus christ is he that's in you that he's in the world the strength of god that's in you is greater than any affliction that can come upon you there is nothing can overtake you but you're gonna supersede it because you are full of super power and that superpower is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you are a christian that means everybody here could be healed every sick i could get a touch from heaven you could shake it off yes and jesus he was not god he was all god he created the winds the waves if other things had to obey him he was the creator notice let us remember he also created our bodies he created winds he created waves he created seas he created fishes and he created our bodies let man come from the dust of the earth and god for man first was a spirit man genesis 1 then a dust man genesis 2 and god put the spirit man in the dust man that's you and i here this morning hallelujah so he created our bodies just like they create fish and moon and stars and everything else won't our bodies have to obey him come on now come on now help me somebody oh hallelujah so now he's coming on the power of herself that's why when the spirit hit jesus he was he went into the willingness to overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lust of the flesh overcome the pride of life because before god empowers a man with full power he has to be able to overcome himself no excuses oh give the lord a shout that's nothing but that's gospel that's nothing but the truth people looking for power and have no character no power for them [Applause] waiting god holding back power and because god's stingy and god playing hard to get i had to give he's holding back power again you know you've seen characters know without paul would it be holy basically if they get paul on top of that they be worse oh hallelujah the prime minister's president all the time in opposition the one way so they're coming power to change a different cap fit the head hallelujah there's man all about the poor the struggling the scrunting and some blessings come around them they on top of the world if rainfall they drown their nose up in here and god looking for somebody the more god blesses the more humble they become the more you could bow my god because god was so great he humbled himself and came to us and god wants you to live that out praise god do you believe that so watch he created our bodies won't our bodies obey him you surrender your thoughts to him you surrender your life to him you surrender your faith to him and watch that body will be what he says if you are drunkard and you can't quit drinking surrender that life to him and what you will drink no more if you are a habitual smoker and try to give it up and can't do it just surrender that to him and watch what happens he will make that body come in subjection to the word oh hallelujah but you have got to surrender it to him but people worship the spirit upon them praise god sometimes people don't even want prayer because they want to continue what they're doing so they don't really want no deliverance they really don't want to break through they know it's right the no church nice to go toe and they will come and get blessed but they don't really want that breakthrough yet because they have the things to do they have their friends to keep up they have the places they want to go and this course for a price he said any man follow me let him deny himself take up his cross [Applause] oh glory to god do i hear i shout in the house jesus said if i even come after me people are waiting on the lord within the lord reading lord you see my man come you want him you go after him so seek after him he said those who seek my face god i want you i want a reality i had enough i hear scriptures are your talk the minister's preached but i want to live in reality lord you met moses i want to meet you come on save me somebody when last have you argued with god amen because he can't give god talking back to you there had to be a discussion to go into argument but god tell abram i am thy shield and i exceeded great reward and abram said god what what kind of reward are they talking about seeing i go tireless so if i'm starting to have a debate and argue back with god everyone say god say go outside and come the stars so shall i see me don't argue with me whatever i say i'll bring it to pass i am going to heal you i'm going to seal you i'm going to deliver you i'm going to restore you i'm going to help you i'm going to strengthen you i'm going to anoint you [Applause] [Music] when the woman was caught in the act of adultery caught in the act this is not here saying no they have it on tape they have evidence and they come to test jesus not a woman you know is that a woman trying to get to you know no no no no no no no no no it's not the woman what's the issue you know it's jesus this is a good master moses lord say a woman that court should be stoned what you saying i am preaching some fresh stuff i hear you're preaching some anointed stuff what stuff you're saying about what moses said come on now because we have the stone ready do you not hear what i'm saying oh hallelujah jesus said which one are you with ocean you just cast it just pelt it just pull it hit you with it i feel like dancing no no i don't feel like dancing [Applause] you may be seated and one by one i mean i go to the market i don't remember that my wife told me to buy some potatoes oh boy i had to buy a dog show oh yes somebody it they can ask phone calls oh yes yes i wanna pick it up no excuses excuses excuses excuses everybody make an excuse to walk because their hearts have to convict them and condemn them because when they look in the mirror of their own lives they recognize that just as guilty of like that woman they know better than her hallelujah there was no more righteous than her hallelujah there was him better than her and jesus turned it back to them and was writing on the ground i want to give them time to walk away turn to the woman call the case and say woman case call where are their accusers none my lord who one didn't see when they're gone she she's in tears there's embarrassment there's pressure [Music] caught a very hard bringer in front of people public exposure public shame she crying things to see when they walk away and just a woman near do i condemn me go and sin no more what she's supposed to do not dance not shout what a woman supposed to do what what what what was she supposed to do but when you know jesus dropped your church is what you're supposed to do when your case is what you're supposed to do when god forgive you of your sins what you supposed to do could somebody tell me where i was though when i lay the foundation of the earth and the mornings i sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy [Music] we have to throw fear out perfect love casts fail amen you can't be fearful fear and fear can't work together you have to kick out fear to get fit that's right stop studying on the loose study the word blessed is a man that walketh nothing comes from him currently and stand in the way of sinners now sit in the seat of this country but his delight is in the law of god and that law that he meditate dear night he shall be like that's what you have to hold to the world he shall be like a tree whatever he took on a prospect they ever get a fight one time with the ungodly prospering god give me that good god oh look are they prospering and god said have you considered the end and i guess they might say no i wasn't thinking about that you know i was thinking how they prospered now yeah go to give him some time you will see when all that end up hallelujah stay with the world stay with god [Applause] jesus said i am the first and the last i have the keys of death and hell fear not that is it i am he that was he that is and will come so watch that means you have the keys for both graves and hades that itself hates itself for you let me see this i'm gonna back it up a little bit i am the first and the last i have the keys of debt and hell why i have overcome here we go and conquered both death and hell that is what the graves and debt itself for you jesus conquer death and hell for us think about saying it again that's why paul can say death where is this thing [Music] [Applause] grave raising victory none for you when you understand that you can see jet hat no power over the blood wash ones we're going to rise hallelujah we're going to rise [Music] job you may see that job was sail i see the tree die come back up but if a man dies shall live again shall you hide me in your my right and then let your wrath be passed and i come back up he couldn't understand the mystery beyond that veil of cold death because satan only finished a death after sickness after death said i know no more power so when a man come back from the dead satan in real trouble we can only reach up to death but jesus raised from the dead and that anointing that resurrection power that glory that dynamic that is what is coming upon a bride to vindicate the resurrection to vindicate his hebrews detonate definitely get his raise from the dead that will be vindicated you know what i've overcome it all i will overcome death hell you'll grieve when he was in the earth many men settled to conquer napoleon set up to conquer the world he did at age 33 and at the age 17 to 25 napoleon was a prohibitionist he didn't believe in drinking he went to france and and he didn't like it he didn't like france but he conquered he went forth and conquered france he took them frenchmen and conquered the world at the age of 33 he sat down and cried because there was nobody else to conquer and he died an alcoholic says he boss now he's king no and it's pressure to keep maintaining that crown uneasy lies the head that wears that crown he couldn't even conquer himself amen other countries but then when that booze take him so he just had a boy down hallelujah couldn't conquer himself but another man come into this world a young man he died at 33 talking about jesus he conquered everything that could be conquered when he was the earth he conquered passions pride sickness devils when he died he conquered death when he arose he conquered the hell he went in conquered everything that was against mankind divine press of god and crushed it he conquered death he conquered the grave he conquered sickness he conquered formalities everything else and overcoming all rose on the third day and conquered listen all the atmosphere above that cut that mist between god and man and connected heaven and earth together [Applause] give the lord a shout [Applause] the atmosphere was laden with devils and jesus conquered all of that so right now we're feeling victorious celebrations from heaven right now this morning give the lord some praises right now you are feeling victorious vibrations from heaven [Applause] glory fear not hallelujah cut every obstacle from the human beings that they might be connected like in the garden eden i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is but here's the fine print of that statement [Music] a man fully surrendered to god it's omnipotent oh give the lord some praises that's my subject a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent and when omnipotent speaks the miraculous takes place hallelujah give the lord a shout on that one when my omnipotence speak lazarus come forth i don't give the man dead how many days how he's rotten [Applause] said one time on a challenge of fate that's a great statement for a person to make and i want to give you in this manner you think of yourself now you messed this baptist pentecost or whatever you are if we are the content for that fate and we believe that jesus rose from the dead this same man that makes the challenge that time i said you can't prove one thing that there is a god outside the supernatural for when omnipotence speak the miraculous take place omnipotence can't speak without being miraculous so how can a man claim to be fully surrendered to god and there is no miracle almost sound like he's lying or he's not talking the full truth a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent so when jesus was going and looking for fig from the victory kiss the tree and next day the tree was dried up they said master it drive from the roots and jesus said somebody said jesus said when jesus said it is it he said you shall say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say [Music] you are here

destroy the nation of the philistines ordained born on the earth anointed of god to destroy the philistines and one day they caught him out in the field without a sword without a spear a thousand of almond philistines run upon him one time did he get down and say oh lord i'm waiting for vision oh lord what must i do direct me now what to do that when christians don't want to act lord help me jesus within the new i'm gonna say i waiting on you i'm watching you i give you my word i give you a head you don't have a monkey brains i give your brains as a man that you could think and choose and make decisions to act i love decisions because you'll see the fruit of decisions down the road he he know he had a need he found nothing but an old jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand fellow stance you hear how much it be done a thousand let's say 999 a thousand and the captain of that thousand had the one report back to the king everybody come back beaten and bruised and he came to come forward what happened how much armies were there 80 000 10 000. you are my best man all right how much demand amen he doing what two will be 10 000. did you hear that kind of max that that's called mathematics one will put a thousand to flight and two tenth housing what will happen with tree geometric progression welcome to three what are we we we you talk about joey's army how many feeling that anointing of god this morning i guess news news news caster was broadcasting here shame report today one man named samson beat a thousand palestines like that's bad news that's not good news to the kingdom oh hallelujah after the embarrassment i write the plot to get him down oh my hallelujah so many people think wait to know it you know it's god they hear from god hear this wait till the voice come and hear it and know that his god is dusted and lord if it isn't just is the lord then it's your impression it's what somebody else thinks people request people say this for me do this for me how can you do it if you're not if you're honest with god until god first tells you how can i tell you thus here jack mo and jackpot hasn't said nothing to me it has to come first from god not impress it's got to be god then it will happen for it is thus saith the lord woman came to brother branham and she couldn't have couldn't have a child and so on she couldn't get pregnant and so on and bahram to like thus say the lord you'll have a baby i literally get among other women and they're talking talking she doubt and whatnot and what that sometime later on she came back to brother branham and she said brown you know i went among other women and i doubt and i ain't believe i want to chat with you he said what did he say she said he said god said the lord he said whether you believe it or don't believe that you're still dusting the lord now when does thus say lord it ain't resting upon the woman you know not even resting upon her face you know it's what god has declared and that's the same as as i will restore god asks if you're going to restore anything no you won't know he said i will restore to you all the years [Applause] and the holy spirit if a man is anointed of god will direct you to follow the holy spirit and the bible amen for he is the one who does these things jesus christ in the form of the holy spirit oh my god praise god so from the resume of the church ages he said thus to the lord joel 2 38 says be glad general zion rejoice in the lord for giving you the former rain moderately and it will cause the condom for you to rain the former natarine in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i have restored to you the years the lucas has eaten the canker worm the caterpillar palmer will my great army you shall eat and plenty and my people shall never be ashamed now it says god is going to restore the lutheran age didn't restore the church it started the reformation isn't that right watch now this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of matthew 24 24. and so much if it possible do you see the very elect and who is it that they attempt to deceive the very elect the spirit of the antichrist in the force anointing one and last days these false ones have already come in jesus name claiming that they've been anointing of god for this last day they are fourth messiah's anointed ones they claim their prophets but they are one with the word never they have added or taken from it no one denies that spirit of god manifesting his gifts upon them but like balaam they all have their programs make their pay for money exercise gifts but deny the word and bypass it for fear that the controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of god like judas with a ministry impacted by christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have the wrong spirit motivating them and watch this part i want to get to the outshine the electing effort and zeal but it is now audition not of christ for it looks for big crowds big programs starting signs among them they preach a second coming and so forth but deny the advent of a prophet messenger though in power and signs and true revelation equipping them all yes it is part this false spirit in the last days is so close to the real can be distinguished here we go only by its deviation from the word amen amen not by anointing not by shouts not by jumping not by singing not by specials not by worship but by deviating from the word that's why we say the prophet and the bride and the spirit says the same thing and what they say will be already in the word are you with me watch they can distinguish only by his division from the word or whenever it is caught in being anti-word it falls back on one argument we already are shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of god because we get results oh my oh my are you with me watch watch god had called moses he didn't want to go those prophets had things it was a hard thing to do they didn't want to be going out and be scorned that they wanted to have fellowship and go with the rest of them i don't want to do this but god has spoken and i must deliver it whether it like it whether they crucified him whether they stone him whatever it is god has spoke to his heart obedience is better than sacrifice watch it was in his heart he must do it it was his life he couldn't hold it there was something here we go a pulsation that pushed them they couldn't bless or curse it god had so much complete control of them till he was their voice their action these prophets so look at elijah elijah said not even rain or dew will fall till i call fair amen he shut the heavens could you imagine a man doing that i shut the heavens not even jew or rain will fall till i call for it this guy was so anointed with god that their word was god hallelujah then vermont prophecy give me a church that's so completely anointed with god till their every action and move is thus say the lord walk in that she kind of glory i will show you a messiah anointed one of god standing up on the earth today oh hallelujah oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theology fails to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church strikes home to that faithful little remnant after the doors of the gentiles close god will anoint his church then he was filled to be filthy still whose right to the director still oh my what a time oh my oh my oh my hallelujah so praise god so joseph was given a quota many colors and the brethren hated him he became to bring them peace but they misunderstood him they hated him without a cause they didn't try to stop to see what he was trying to achieve they just judge him because listen he didn't agree with them amen they don't agree with them they judge you he makes himself so and so on so look at moses he couldn't help train himself there he didn't do it hypocritically when god tell moses get away there i'm going to destroy his people moses put himself in the gap and say lord before i destroy them destroy me amen moses wasn't playing you know moses was looking for photoshoot in him he was genuine spirit of christ in him said before you take them people take me first it was the spirit of christ in moses oh hallelujah are you with me he never did it for self-glory watch if they would have looked to the word they would have seen his purpose he will always do that to glorify the father neither will any servant of god take glory neither would any servant take the gift of god and try to glorify himself i want to read that again a servant of god will not take glory nina would any servant of god take a gift of god and try to glorify himself the spirit of god working in men make men act like god no wonder jesus said it's not written here god's not a small gene a big g and if they are called god to whom the spirit of god came to how can you condemn me when i say i'm the son of god they were gods commanding because they would hear yeah why here why yeah why because they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of god and they were working for the glory of god david said you come with me and shield and spare but i come to you in the name of the lord you have the right objective you have the right motive isn't that right so when a man is anointed with the spirit now let us go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man are you ready everybody alive everybody up when a man is so anointed with the spirit when a man is anointed of the spirit of god his habits his actions and everything is moving in him sometimes he's misjudged look at david would say my god my god wild dog forsaken me that was the spirit of christ and david and when he raised his psalm how could they even say that it was the spirit saying my god my god somebody said listen that hypocrite up there who hands his peers who feed his peers that's the intellectual but one what this element of spirit would know that was the spirit of god in him crying out when a man is anointed here we go again of the spirit of god he has got the action of god are you ready and the action of god is never to break us up amen the action of god is to draw us together for we are one in christ jesus god's purpose is to bring us together to love one another do you get that the action of god is not to break up [Applause] break up husband and wife break up families break up churches break up this break up that then the action of god the action of god is to bring together. he is making a bride he is hewing the chips now chopping off the world watch he's cutting you down now cutting you down to his wood only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word how could you become bright you have to cut shave shape you to be his bride you can't come up with your old own self he wants to cut the church out just like he cut the sun out like he did the bride and groom to be his bride you must be part of him you must leave the world you'll aim and praise god hallelujah he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting up for christ no matter what the world say you have lost your mind you've gone crazy you went and joined the church of holy rollers don't pay attention to that if you're not truly saved in that body and the word of god in you and reflecting itself and the life of christ reflecting out of you brother sister don't take that chance i don't care what you are what kind of experience you have let that work reflect through you each day because god in this last day is taking a bride for his son jesus christ not a church for his son a bride for his son and that bride is made up of members who are part of him who is part of that word so you could never get fight with the word because you are going to be the word itself so when the word hit you you could only say amen that word is you you are part of that word isn't that right so therefore you give birth to the tree on the day of pentecost isn't that right luke 24 49 and do it powerful on high and there he give birth to the tree the holy ghost pentecost justification signification department only goes and then christ come to dwell in it to bring forth the fruits fruits justification sanification baptism holy ghost then the prison of the holy ghost comes in that to bring forth the fruits oh my so all through the ages all these organizational vines or branches rather and what god keep doing cutting them off they produce a baptist branch methodist branch pentecostal branch keep cutting the door because that's not the original branch god didn't make no pentecost baptist church methodist church catholic church he didn't make those things men set up those things so as the vines and branches push out because baptist after his kind catholic of this kind methodist after his kind everybody after his kind but whatever time too but we give the lord a shout hallelujah every seed have to pray for it after his time god have a kind too oh hallelujah so watch they are dead and and won't come in the presence won't come in the first resurrection with divine fruit of organization watch they will go into organizational group and they won't come with the food of the vine so we cannot point you to this church or pointed to an organization or pointing to a system you have to be pointed to jesus christ because he's the vine and you are the branch and you expect to bring forth fruit all to you a man get a wife is to produce children is to produce fruit well a vine having branches to produce fruit you want to pump his life through him through you to produce the fruit come on you are the woman you are the bride come on now you are the womb oh glory to god you are the man with the womb you're the woman hallelujah to produce childhood christ hallelujah messiah will be on the earth oh my god are the sons of god gonna come forth oh hallelujah we're gonna make adam proud my god i'm gonna be happy adam didn't make it hallelujah as a son plays positionally he fell and god said i'm gonna reboot reflect the whole thing and pretend youtube process i am a place [Music] god said i want to bring them to children now let them go to the group process and listen god himself didn't bypass it because christ was born our virgin so he went through the process also christ is a teenager christ is a young man christ is a carpenter how to wait his time to be anointed of god he has seen a wait of our anointing i have freedom to work now i am working on a shop i am i am i am jesus hallelujah so how you are lazy jesus i'm not working jesus jesus worked jesus walked jesus lived a normal life so he could understand that you will have no excuses [Applause] he suffered things he was tried he was tested he was in the word he waited for his anointing amen promise 13 to 30 he was in the scriptures waiting for the anointing of god waiting for john to come out gone before time you can raise the flag of oh i'm jesus i already know i'm going forth with my faith with no one notion of god can do that oh my hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah is there any home stretch here could we take a little more this is a personal experience with god by the brand and i felt like to bring this back to you the story of the building there's some lesson saturday we're going to see and i believe that jesus said this the thing that i do shall you do also and i believe these things was to accompany the resurrection of jesus christ ministry watch i am okay okay loving him we have faith we have love but if we have love we have faith perfect love casts out fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect when fear is gone feet is perfect when fear is gone fit is perfect you fear gonna lose your job your fear will not get the job your fear you will this will happen that's what happened faith is not made perfect but fear you throw that fear out and you put faith in god and god holds tomorrow so everything going to be just right as god ordained it to be then you move in the fate of god believe in god isn't that right so but the brandon was passing through a field that had a killable a not killable is just a title for bulma but his name is that killer because he killed before so he have reputation and but around forget that killable was in that field and he leave his gun back and so on he's walking to the field let's continue i turned first i fell for the gun it wasn't there i'm glad it wasn't i'll probably kill the bull and paid for it i felt for the gun it wasn't there i looked at the fence it was too far for me there was no trees around for me to get to there was nothing but to face death i said lord if the time has come for me to die i want to face it like a man so i showed my shoulders down i said if this is it if i must die by this bull then i must die and something happened amen i know this song like a child but it's the truth somehow instead of despising that beast i had a love for it and i thought that poor thing laying out in the field i come in on his territory i disturb him he don't know no more than to protect himself he threw his horns up dug the dirt up fell into his knees you know what they do before the charge and i told that animal i feel so sorry sorry i disturbed you i said you can't talk to anyone now now remember what go tell adam right have power over animals and the beast of the field and everything else this is god talk adam that this is genesis and this is a man in the 20th century and i feel better pulled and this is what's happening and i said i'm sorry to disturb you i don't want to kill you i'm a servant of god i'm on my way to pray for sick people i forget about these signs i was talking just like that now and there was something another had happened something has happened now so growing up now i wasn't scared of him i was no more afraid of that bull than i would my brother so first something happened he's had a lovely bird and then something happened again no fear you ever see a little child with a dog or an animal no fear when a big man will frown from a big dog the child walks straight up to that dog no fear good when the ball made his charger come to me he come within 10 feet and he stopped threw his feet out he looked so depleted he looked this way that way he turned went right back around and laid down and i walk oh no no sorry sorry um that is where the church is you're always scared it's not going to happen that's the reason it don't happen when fear love casts out fear when you've got love fear is gone but as long here we go there's a bomb as long as you've got fear love cannot operate as long as you have fear love cannot operate so but around had spoke to the bill and tell the world go back and sit down and so on right and the bull made his charge look depleted and he turned and went right or back around lay down there where he got up at i walked across the field went out the pasture he laid there look at me it was love that took the fear away and god seen me through now in the next part after i got all the pastor and that left me i was shook like a leaf hallelujah did you hear that that that whatever come over him when he come over to that he was shaking like a leaf while i was in the presence of him that fear had left what was it the anointing of god amen when i come upon him he's a different man what is he a god man [Applause] a man just like adam let's continue oh my so but abram says here watch you are man outside you is one man inside of you is another man inside of you is supernatural outside is physical god angel is the very same word you can't separate god messenger or god angel which has the greatest authority an angel from heaven on angela the pulpit which has it the angel of the pulpit if an angel from heaven comes and preached any of the gospel to you that that which i have already preached let it be a curse so the angel anointed with the holy spirit with the word stand next to god watch oh my god he said watch all powers of heaven is given into my hand oh if the great holy church jesus said all paul's heaven has given me to my hand go i'll be with you always whatever you bind on it i'll burn it by heaven whatever loosen it i lose in heaven if the great holy church only realized its power to do these things but there is so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright but when here we go every talk of fear is vanished and the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and the church has the power and they have everything that heaven owns behind them they are ambassadors of the throne oh hallelujah praise god do you see that now all fear gone then you become an ambassador of the throne when the government set up i sent out an ambassador it represents the country it represents all the countries behind you all the authorities behind you and when you become a pastor of the throne of god the whole heaven is behind you all the authorities behind you you're not representing yourself you're not representing your own kingdom not representing your own family you represented the kingdom of the most high you are ambassador of the throne of god and from that turn proceeding and voices oh glory to god and when the true anointed of god speaks it's the voice of god oh hallelujah praise god do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah do you believe that so when fire came into peter's heart and bombed the demons out of peter and god put a throne and sit down on it and nasty the fire came into the church lying and peter said you're not lying to a man you're lying to the holy ghost what happened that fire was on a throne around the throne of lightning and voices and rainbows and so on the rainbows and peter's hurt oh hallelujah brother brown said it going to happen again oh little all you little rotten you got firebombed your heart and put himself inside her there same old outside man same old face same old hands whatever but god failed those prophets wasn't much to look at they had long beard and wrinkled face but they are dusty of the lord hallelujah glory to god amen glory to god are you with me moses 40 years older egypt 40 years ago get beat out there settle with his family and when he go back there you saw the ten commandments what kingdom are you coming from the

to drop it on you in your home when you feel your anointing then go and lay hands upon your brother your sister your wife your husband your children when you're anointed upon you you know the spirit that comes like your jawbone and you're going to beat the devil off for them praise god come on save him and somebody move with the anointing right with the anointing push with the anointing right now the anointing is upon you right now in this building here [Applause] hallelujah no watch go into all the world you're my witnesses an ambassador of christ has the authority everything that christ owns belongs to that ambassador and we read the scripture he said as my father sent me so send are you you're not getting a ticket from somebody overseas or some commission from somebody jesus give the commission he said go to all the world we under commission we are anointed and commissioned oh give the lord a shout oh i am anointed i come in to do what i'm doing [Applause] hallelujah go into all the world you're my witnesses after the holy come upon you what is a witness it's an ambassador it's to come and witness something the whole power of heaven is right in your hands why do we sit and the church's barren and recep dormant is because we don't recognize these things if the united states send me to russia as an ambassador to the nation of russia if they have officially sent me to russia all the power of united states has is behind me my word is just that's the same as the united states if i have been recognized as an ambassador oh glory to god so when when many elijah said not even green or jew will fall then i call for god to back that up because the whole of heaven that's omnipotent speaking that's a man surrendered to god then brother brown said wait until them seven thunders after the voices of that group they're gonna slice and cut they could shut the heavens they could do whatever they want to do [Applause] it's the thunders gonna be out in his voices this is the message [Applause] then you will be seated if god has sent us to be his ambassadors all the powers in heaven all that god is all the angels all his powers stand behind our words if we are correctly ordained send messengers to the people god has to honor his word oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm almost done but i wanted a farm and he saw a tree so what kind of tree is that he saw five different kind of fruits on it this is an orange tree i see grapefruit tangerine tangelo lemon all kind of fruits he said oh yes they're grafted he said no what yeah anything with citrus life will live in it that's very good i stopped i looked again i said brother john i see oh not something next year all those citrus fruits like lemon and tangerine and grapefruit that that that will drop off it would be oranges he said no no no no it will bear its kind the one that get a lemon branch will produce lemons they want to have the tangerine to produce tangerine i thought you said it was an orange tree yes but did it quit bearing oranges no when the original tree puts out an original vine it will be oh orange another original branch is coming forth i let the interpretation have been grafted in grafted in crafted in grafted in grafted in but if that orange tree put forth another original branch it will produce the original fruit are you ready when that tree puts forth another original branch there will be a book of acts behind it not a book a talk sit down a minute the bible called the book of acts another book of talk is the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles and if that branch put forth another tree is is another book of acts written behind it what you're talking about silvan gold having none such as i have i give unto you peter had something he was cursed but he denied christ he denied christ three times and whatnot but when that power hit him she was anointed with god he could tell a crippled man i have something i have something i have something man didn't get it a man can't take it away or give the lord a the church give it to you they can take it back if the association gives you they can take it back if some minutes are giving you they can take it back but when god give it to you [Applause] no watch go watch watch i am divine okay i'll skip that watch now how do we get into that body by one spirit first corinthians 12 and by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and the spirit is the life of christ is that right the life of christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life and if that life is laying in the seed the seed is the word and this baptism of the holy spirit comes upon it it belongs to bring that seed to life hallelujah oh my oh my god hallelujah so the seven angels messages blew up the seven seals calling the our gentile workers to receive the same pay the first hour receive the even time message restore back that same thing again if that tree put forth another branch it will bear the original fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things at the end of the vine so what this is a branch this is a plant here this is a stem i'll have all kind of branches but right to the top our original branch is going to pick up and that's we're going to get oranges out watch there's got to comfort a restoration an evening light to light up and make it right it will come out of the vine not a denomination that grafted into it by the original production of the word and it comes from the evening time and watch no matter how much you preach here we go whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only by him who said i am the light of the world so there has got to comfort our power here we go the holy spirit himself to write or vindicate or prove to make manifest what he predicted would happen so right now we're in talk mode prophesying again from version 10 8 11 until god come to manifest his word so i can't prove nothing up to anybody or say i'm better than this one no i'm waiting because power gonna come neutral has it power where's he got his power the pentecostal got the power we're gonna get ours and we are waiting upon that and the power is not the thing really is the seed is the main thing because power come and the seed is not right what's going to happen amen amen so many says if the lord receives evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing i'll save him amen but that's up to you you've got something to do did it overcome shall i narrate all things see how quiet you get when it's up to you to get clean you also get clean with that broom and you're picking up the paper and you sweep in here and you're cleaning here that's how you always get clean god can give you strength to clean your homes but if you expect an angel to come down to our history with your sweeping keep on waiting hallelujah all right you you you'll be keeping on praying it's just that that prayer will not be answered in other words you're wasting time get cracking and get it cleaned up [Applause] don't mean to rebuke anybody that's up to you it's something you got to do they'll overcome we'll inherit all things day that overcome your power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready you see god could not push you to a pipe and pull you out on the other side and say blessed that he said overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i had to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show faith and respect to god oh hallelujah praise god but god is the creator living in you given you all the power and you are in possession of anything that he had so it is in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil the fruit of righteousness to walking from temptation all malice hatred strife envy and so forth come away from it for it takes him from your heart oh holly dear brother sister if you haven't got the bathroom holy ghost this morning run into the kingdom of god as quick as you can oh hallelujah the disciples had power but enough faith to move the power and that's what the matter with the church today the people today it's not a lack of power no it's a lack of faith to move the power what is it you have got to get the word and what you have got to get with the word and get yourself killed out i am persuaded that many of us friends there we go have received the holy ghost but we receive enough holy ghost to make us that place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but god wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill a bit of you so if you're watching movies movies movies what chance god have to put anything in your mind because you caught up in that movie world you caught up in that magazine world you call it in that novel world and god have no place to inject himself but as you die out and all the nervous that have moved this way the movies start to move out there and go start to move in movies move out his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that is promising itself through you it's not a group i'll take one and leave one amen it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god i'm longing for the old people can meet you and and greet you and god bless you and they know you're a christian they amen matter what church you're going to you're a christian because of your life you're not a christian before i go to church christian because you have a testimony of christ infecting your life so filled with the holy ghost which brett living itself
