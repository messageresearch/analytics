[14:51] the body is going to be changed will be
[14:53] changing the very atoms in the moment
[14:56] and the twile of an eye and we will not
[14:58] be here
[14:59] we have a scripture a man named Enoch
[15:02] you may be see that he walked with God
[15:04] and was not for God took him but before
[15:07] God took him you see there are so much
[15:09] people like to talk about what God
[15:11] allow it almost like if there's no
[15:14] devil what God allowed and God allowed
[15:18] the devil to afflict me and God allowed
[15:21] this and stop studying what God allow
[15:23] and start to study what you have a right
[15:26] to you see because God give promises
[15:28] inside of here that we have to take the
[15:31] kingdom is preached and Every Man Press
[15:33] their way into it and those who
[15:36] understand who they are they could take
[15:37] it only those you see you see when those

[16:39] do this evening are you with me are you
[16:43] going to fight this evening let's all
[16:46] stand for the word Deuteronomy chapter 8
[16:49] Amos chapter 3 and Revelation chapter 10
[16:54] for the word
[17:07] remember in me in prayer on Wednesday
[17:10] I'm on my way to Ivory Coast for the
[17:11] Easter meeting and Ivory Coast I'm
[17:14] expecting a great time over there in the
[17:17] Lord next month supp to be
[17:21] Cameroon praise God so
[17:24] let's Deuteronomy chapter 8 read verse
[17:27] one
[17:29] all the Commandments which I command the
[17:31] this day shall he observe to do that he
[17:35] may live and multiply and go in and
[17:40] possess the land which the Lord swear
[17:43] unto your fathers and thou shalt
[17:46] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[17:49] God LED thee these 40 years in the
[17:52] wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee
[17:57] to know what was in thine heart
[17:59] whether thou wouldest keep his
[18:01] Commandments or no and he humbled thee
[18:05] and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[18:08] with manner which thou knowest not
[18:11] neither did thy fathers know that he
[18:15] might make thee know that man do not
[18:19] live by bread alone but by every word
[18:23] that proceeded out of the mouth of the
[18:25] Lord do man
[18:27] live Amos 3 we want to read from verse 7
[18:32] and 8 and next we read Revelation 10 81
[18:36] read in Amos 3 verse
[18:41] 7 surely the Lord God will do
[18:44] nothing but he revealed his secret unto
[18:48] his servants the
[18:50] prophets the lion had roared who will
[18:53] not fear the lord God had spoken who can
[18:57] but prophesy
[18:59] Revelation 10 and you going to read from
[19:02] verse
[19:09] 8 and the voice which I heard from
[19:11] Heaven spake unto me again saying go
[19:14] take the little book which is open in
[19:15] the hand of the Angel which standed upon
[19:17] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[19:19] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[19:21] a little book he said unto me take it
[19:23] eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter
[19:26] shall be thy mouth with as honey I took
[19:28] the little book out of the Angel's hand
[19:30] ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as
[19:32] honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[19:35] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[19:37] prophesy again before many peoples and
[19:41] Nations and tongues and Kings let's bow
[19:43] our heads father we have read your word
[19:45] bless it speak may they hear your word
[19:47] from your mouth your voice in Jesus name
[19:50] I ask it amen and amen you may be seated
[20:02] Hallelujah the title have this evening
[20:04] is the word from the mouth of God
[20:08] hallelujah I'm subject living by the
[20:11] word title again the word from the mouth
[20:14] of God Jesus said it when the devil
[20:17] tempted him to turn the stone into bread
[20:21] he quoted the scripture man shall not
[20:24] live by bread alone but by every word
[20:27] that proceeded out of the mouth
[20:29] of God and I'm talking today about the
[20:32] word from the mouth of God now they have
[20:36] billions of people on the Earth millions
[20:39] of mouths on the earth men and preachers
[20:42] on the earth it's onean thing for words
[20:44] to come out the mouth of a man or men
[20:48] but is another thing for it to come out
[20:50] the mouth of Goden when God brought all
[20:54] the children of Israel and they came to
[20:56] the mountain and fire Came Upon the
[20:58] mountain and the mountain begin to shake
[20:59] and earthquake and so on the people said
[21:02] don't let God
[21:04] speak let Moses speak amen and God say
[21:08] okay I'm going to let Moses speak he
[21:11] going to be my mouthpiece amen isn't
[21:14] that right so then the mouthpiece of God
[21:16] are His prophets yes sir and Amos said
[21:19] surely the Lord will do nothing except
[21:21] he revealed the secrets unto his
[21:24] servants the prophets amen so therefore
[21:27] when Adam fell
[21:29] God continued in his creation to try to
[21:31] find a man who would live every word he
[21:35] tried to find a man that would live the
[21:37] word for his age and we find out that
[21:41] Satan caused Adam to Fall by that one
[21:43] word by saying you shall not surely die
[21:47] and God continue on in his creation to
[21:50] try to find one man that would live by
[21:53] every word his first man fail and this
[21:56] man would live his time his age live in
[21:59] now there are different ages that God
[22:02] prophesied from the beginning which
[22:03] would take place all down and that's the
[22:05] reason he could tell the end from the
[22:07] beginning what if Moses had brought
[22:09] Noah's message it wouldn't work amen
[22:12] what if Jesus brought Moses message it
[22:14] wouldn't work so we can't bring a
[22:17] Methodist message or a Baptist message
[22:19] or a Pentecostal message it wouldn't
[22:20] work amen isn't that right so we've got
[22:23] to find out the what the scripture says
[22:25] for today that's why Jesus said it this
[22:28] way he that believeth on me as the
[22:31] scripture had said amen in other words
[22:34] it has come right back to what's written
[22:36] in the scriptures isn't that right so
[22:41] God excuse me is going to judge the
[22:43] World by the church which one Catholic
[22:46] 66 something El naations how's he going
[22:49] to do that God is going to judge the
[22:51] World by Jesus Christ because in the
[22:54] beginning was the word the word was with
[22:57] God and the word was God and the word
[22:59] became flesh and dwelt Among Us God and
[23:03] the word is the same and this is God in
[23:11] print this is God in print amen I want
[23:15] to say it again this is God in print am
[23:18] so that's why the devil don't want you
[23:20] to even read the Bible because this is
[23:22] God in
[23:23] print but Jesus said it is written it is
[23:27] written it is written
[23:29] oh give the Lord some
[23:31] [Applause]
[23:37] Praises so the word of God is God on
[23:43] print amen Brethren God on print here we
[23:47] go Jehovah printed on a
[23:50] book oh give the Lord some Praises
[23:55] Jehovah
[23:57] printed on a
[23:59] book isn't that right here we go he has
[24:03] got to judge the church by some standard
[24:06] and he cannot judge it by the standard
[24:08] of any system that we have made so there
[24:11] are churches and there are systems built
[24:14] around the churches how they humiliate
[24:17] the deacons or how they Jam the trustees
[24:19] or how they press the ushers or how they
[24:21] do this or how to do that how they
[24:23] straighten their members out they have
[24:25] systems around the word sys are built
[24:29] around the word but it's not the word
[24:31] the word is always
[24:34] [Applause]
[24:36] God so when Jesus came he came andet
[24:39] systems Pharisees scribes Sadducees e he
[24:43] met systems and he was the
[24:48] word so he was bringing the present
[24:51] tense reality of truth but they had the
[24:55] systems that was built around the truth
[24:57] which was SP and pans
[24:59] gospel handwashing gospel Thou shalt not
[25:03] and do this and do that and he came and
[25:05] bring the word and when he brought the
[25:07] word it was
[25:09] rejected because the word is always
[25:12] rejected because the world can't handle
[25:14] truth and system is built off of the
[25:17] world because system is always manmade
[25:21] but the word is
[25:24] God church is
[25:26] man-made but revelation of Upon This
[25:28] Rock I'll build my church that's
[25:30] [Applause]
[25:34] God and he said Upon This Rock I'll
[25:36] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[25:38] shall never Prevail against it fight
[25:40] with it wrestle with it come against it
[25:42] Hallelujah so when God put a tick on
[25:44] your life before the foundation of the
[25:46] world no man can ex you off on the
[25:51] earth I will say it again when God put a
[25:55] tick on your life a green tick on your
[25:57] life
[25:58] before the foundation of the world
[26:01] nobody can ex you down here come on now
[26:04] come
[26:05] on
[26:06] Glory Glory Hall the woman in the well
[26:11] she had a tick on her life before the
[26:13] foundation of the world but then Earth
[26:15] they put an ex on her and Jesus came to
[26:17] tell her you have a tick up CSA woman
[26:20] don't bother with those men I come to
[26:22] tell you you have a green tick you are
[26:24] all right you are
[26:27] fine oh I want to hear a bigger shout
[26:29] than
[26:32] that okay so watch because every one of
[26:36] our systems are man-made and listen it
[26:39] has to be judged yes sir now if you want
[26:42] to disagree and say no I believe you're
[26:44] wrong there but brandham I believe ours
[26:47] or the other fellow would say well ours
[26:49] is well then which one is right then
[26:51] there are 900 different systems of it so
[26:55] God could not judge the church by 900
[26:58] 100 different systems there will be one
[27:02] and that will be God will judge the
[27:04] World by Jesus Christ and Christ is the
[27:07] word so that is why every church is
[27:10] Sovereign
[27:13] yes and you cannot take the standard of
[27:15] one church and show it on another church
[27:18] the standard is the word regardless of
[27:20] where that church is this is the
[27:22] standard not race not color not hair not
[27:26] skin just the word word because this
[27:30] written word is what became flesh in the
[27:33] person of Jesus Christ he was this word
[27:37] Made
[27:39] Alive I want to hear you ride with me
[27:42] this
[27:43] evening so when they asked John the
[27:45] Baptist who are you he said I am the
[27:48] voice of one crying in the wilderness he
[27:51] was quoting the written scriptures he
[27:54] was quoting the word himself because the
[27:57] scripture is the word from the mouth of
[28:04] God oh Hallelujah and when the mouth of
[28:08] God speaks something nothing could stop
[28:10] it he said my word shall not return unto
[28:17] me void but it shall accomplish the
[28:21] purpose that I sent it to
[28:26] accomplish w
[28:29] you don't know I feel this evening Glory
[28:33] so
[28:34] Jesus knowing the scriptures knowing
[28:38] what David said I shall not suffer my
[28:41] soul that soul in corruption nor leave
[28:44] my my leave his soul in hell my Holy One
[28:47] he knew David spoke speaking about him
[28:50] by prophecy because men of old were
[28:52] moved by the spirit and spoke the
[28:56] prophecy and when Jesus read that
[28:58] scripture he could rest his soul on it
[29:02] because that was the word from the mouth
[29:04] of God he said destroy this Temple and
[29:09] in three days I will raise it up
[29:12] myself Jesus was relying on the word
[29:16] from the mouth of God that was spoken to
[29:20] David come on say Amen somebody they
[29:23] were so convinced that it was from God
[29:27] they could hand their soul and it Jesus
[29:30] said destroy this body never a man speak
[29:34] like that man never a man speak like
[29:38] that
[29:38] [Applause]
[29:43] man do you do you understand Daniel
[29:49] Daniel said I read by books and I
[29:52] understood the time that was at hand and
[29:54] I begin to seek the Lord because all
[29:57] these these brothers understood that the
[30:00] word from the mouth of God cannot fail
[30:05] man's word will not stand but this word
[30:08] one time Jesus heaven will pass away but
[30:11] my words will never pass away he was so
[30:14] convinced of where he come from and what
[30:18] he was he could say my word will never
[30:22] pass away come on are you going with me
[30:24] now oh glory to God
[30:29] hallelujah
[30:30] hallelujah so we are coming back that we
[30:34] could live by the scriptures live by
[30:39] word the word oh Hallelujah blessed be
[30:43] the name of the Lord you may be seated
[30:46] let me just share a few scriptures with
[30:47] you Matthew 2:23 and he came and dwelt
[30:51] in the city of Nazareth that it might be
[30:53] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[30:55] prophets he shall be called a Nazar
[30:59] Matthew 13:34 all these things spake
[31:02] Jesus UN in unto the multitude in
[31:04] Parables and without a parable speaking
[31:07] it unto them that it might be fulfilled
[31:10] which was spoken by the prophet saying I
[31:12] will open my mouth in Parables I will
[31:15] utter things which have been kept secret
[31:18] from the foundation of the world Matthew
[31:21] 27:35 and they crucified him and parted
[31:25] his garments casting lots that it might
[31:27] be fulfill which was spoken of by the
[31:30] prophet they parted my garments among
[31:32] them and upon my vest did they cast lots
[31:35] Mark 7:6 he answered them and said well
[31:39] had Isaiah's prophesy of you Hypocrites
[31:41] for it is written this people honored me
[31:44] with their lips but their heart is far
[31:46] from me so you begin to understand that
[31:49] Jesus was living the word and
[31:52] identifying scripture being fulfilled
[31:55] because he knew every word that came out
[31:58] from the mouth of God it can't fail it
[32:01] can't lie it's the truth you shall know
[32:05] the truth and the truth going to set you
[32:07] free we need to hear a word not any word
[32:12] but the word from the mou of
[32:15] [Applause]

[39:40] the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[39:41] stood forth to read and there was
[39:43] delivered unto him the book of the
[39:45] prophet Isaiah and he found the place
[39:48] where it was written the spirit ah you

[40:04] was a random scripture it was a chosen
[40:07] scripture it's a scripture he found to
[40:10] effect a season change and time and
[40:13] purpose he found the place where it was
[40:15] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[40:18] me because he had anointed me to preach
[40:20] the gospel to the poor he had sent me to
[40:23] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[40:25] Deliverance to the captives and
[40:26] recovering into the sight of the blind
[40:28] to set at Liberty them that are bruise
[40:30] to preach the acceptable year of the
[40:32] Lord he closed the book he gave it to
[40:34] the minister sat down and all the eyes
[40:37] of them that were a synagogue were
[40:38] fasten on him and he began to say unto
[40:40] him this day is this scripture fulfilled
[40:44] hallelujah oh glory to God I wonder what
[40:46] you going to say I wonder what the bride
[40:49] going to say you waiting for healing so
[40:51] long but you're going to say this day
[40:53] the scripture is fulfilled I was reading
[40:56] about the prophet pray for a woman I
[40:58] think she had some stomach condition she
[40:59] couldn't eat and he prayed for her and
[41:01] she was so sick and for three weeks she
[41:04] going through pain and struggling and
[41:06] whatnot praise God and people mocking
[41:08] her and scuffing her because she was
[41:10] just believing God and trusting God and
[41:12] after a while she just felt to eat
[41:14] something she eat one thing she eat
[41:15] something else and afterward she
[41:17] recognized she was healed she run out
[41:19] praising God the prophet said the angel
[41:21] of God listen listen he said the word of
[41:24] healing what happened God said thus
[41:26] sayth the Lord you shall be healed and
[41:28] that's dust Lord is the word coming out
[41:31] from God when he dust here the Lord it
[41:33] can't fail for three weeks she is
[41:36] struggling she is looking like she is
[41:38] all sick and after three weeks you see
[41:40] the angel of the Lord pass by her
[41:42] neighborhood and fulfill what God had
[41:46] spoken three weeks before so don't you
[41:49] give up you pass through that prayer
[41:51] line last Sunday don't you doubt one
[41:53] moment praise God they shall lay hands
[41:56] on the sake and they shall be
[42:03] healed glory glory to God Amen
[42:08] Hallelujah praise God you believe that
[42:11] let's continue now in order to have
[42:14] faith faith have to have a basis you
[42:17] can't let Faith be loose and wild faith
[42:20] has to rest not upon the shifting SS of
[42:23] man's reasoning but faith is based on
[42:27] the solid rock of God's word so once you
[42:30] have the word the word becomes a
[42:32] platform to rest your faith on it's got
[42:35] to rest on something isn't that right
[42:38] that's why Jesus could rely on David's
[42:40] words that's why Dani Daniel all these
[42:43] prophets could rely on one another word
[42:45] because they know where the source is
[42:46] they know where it come from it came
[42:49] from the mouth of God so this word man
[42:52] shall not live by bread alone but by
[42:54] every word is is exciting to me it is
[42:57] thrilling to me to know we are called to
[43:00] live by the scripture itself I'm
[43:02] expecting this word to be activated in
[43:05] your spirit to be activated in your soul
[43:08] I expect you to connect with your
[43:10] scripture I expect you to have Victory
[43:13] from this day
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:21] forward so faith is based rest on God's
[43:25] word so Faith Can't float Faith have to
[43:28] rest I want to say faith can't float it
[43:30] have no floating faith it have to rest
[43:33] oh Hallelujah and something isn't that
[43:35] right and it must rest on the word so
[43:37] you need the word you need a word from
[43:40] the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise
[43:43] God gyrus was a secret believer he
[43:46] couldn't confess he really believed the
[43:47] Messiah because they was going to kick
[43:49] him out the synagogue they was going to
[43:51] press him out from his special position
[43:54] in church and give him a backseat
[43:55] somewhere and small ify him that's not a
[43:58] word reduce him is not put pressure on
[44:01] him but gyrus you see God has forced the
[44:03] issue his daughter got so sick that
[44:06] gyrus couldn't be silent anymore private
[44:08] anymore or secret anymore he know the

[48:18] they are lukew about it for seven out of
[48:21] Seven Ages I've seen nothing but men

[48:25] at the end of thise age I'm spewing you
[48:27] out of my mouth it is all over
[48:29] Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice
[48:31] of the seventh messenger when he shall
[48:34] begin to sound the mystery of God which
[48:37] should be finished as he declared unto
[48:39] his servant of prophets here it is here

[48:48] 2,000
[48:49] years listen to the kind he is sending
[48:52] someone who is far from organization
[48:55] education
[48:57] the world of religion that as John the
[48:59] Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear
[49:02] only from
[49:04] God this last the prophet he will have
[49:07] thus sayth the Lord and speak for God he
[49:11] will be God's
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:17] mouthpiece who will be God mouthpiece he
[49:21] this Prophet according to Malachi 4
[49:24] behold I send you Elijah the prophet not
[49:26] Elijah the prophet coming behold
[49:30] I send you not a man come and say I am
[49:34] the Elijah no behold I send you Elijah
[49:40] the prophet and he's got a job to do but

[49:49] mouth will come my word come on say Amen
[49:52] somebody and man shall live by bread
[49:55] alone but by everywh
[49:57] come on now that proceeded out of my
[50:00] mouth
[50:02] [Applause]
[50:06] peace the Bible
[50:08] said in his hands have seven stars or
[50:12] seven Messengers seven spirits actually
[50:16] re reverse to one Spirit working out the
[50:19] will of God in different Generations so
[50:21] watch he is holding them amen it didn't
[50:25] say eight Stars 92 Stars 100 stars seven
[50:29] stars and a fivefold star it didn't say
[50:32] that it say Seven Stars not seven and a
[50:36] quarter not seven and a eight just
[50:39] seven because they are only Seven Ages
[50:43] so God just needs seven
[50:45] stars stars means it's night time stars
[50:49] mean they come to shine light in the
[50:51] time of Darkness that's when stars do
[50:53] come out because it's all dark so you
[50:56] need Stars has to shine to show us the
[50:58] light for the hour it shall be light in
[51:01] the evening time come on give the Lord
[51:03] some Praises people oh glory to God
[51:06] Hallelujah in his right
[51:11] hand you know what right away they are
[51:14] held in his hand they are associated
[51:16] with his power that is what the hand
[51:19] signifies it signifies the power of God
[51:22] the authority of God not one of them
[51:24] came in his own power and authority
[51:27] that is what Paul said it takes the
[51:29] authority of God and the power of the
[51:32] Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the
[51:35] authority of God in the power of the
[51:37] spirit these men were all empowered by
[51:40] the Holy Ghost they all stood up to the
[51:43] world they were full of God they were
[51:46] sent or authorized by God not by self or
[51:52] other
[51:52] men so this is what man selling out man
[51:56] says God sending out man that's
[51:59] [Applause]
[52:02] different Jesus said here we go this is
[52:05] powerful you got to listen
[52:07] carefully Jesus said that when he went
[52:09] away he would send his Spirit which the
[52:13] world could not receive that is right
[52:17] the world's systems could not receive
[52:20] him that is what organization is it is a
[52:24] world system right show me a world
[52:27] system church that is full of the Holy
[52:29] Ghost I want to see it you will never
[52:32] see it he said if I can show you if you
[52:35] can show me such a church you are
[52:37] finding a Mystic in the word not one of
[52:41] these Messengers was
[52:42] organized either they were put out or
[52:46] got out because they were convicted of
[52:49] the sin of
[52:52] organization you hear about the sin of
[52:54] adultery and fornication all kind of
[52:56] sins but there's a sin called the sin of
[52:58] organization when men rule men and men
[53:01] dictate to men and men anoint themselves
[53:04] Crown themselves lay hands on themselves
[53:06] lay hands on others that's denomination
[53:09] that's organization that Spirit of man
[53:12] when man bring inspiration for the rest
[53:14] to say the same inspiration that is
[53:16] organizational stuff yes sir but these
[53:19] men were different they were hearing
[53:22] direct from God the word of God they
[53:26] brought the revelation of God as God
[53:29] gave it to them they spoke it out man
[53:32] shall live my bread alone but by every
[53:35] word that proceed out of the mouth of
[53:38] God and God mouth was unfolded through
[53:41] Seven Ages so through Seven Ages he had
[53:43] seven men that would release a portion
[53:46] of his word to the age of that
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:52] time oh are you with me and this age he
[53:56] sent William Marian branam a 20th
[53:59] century Prophet as his mouthpiece to
[54:02] release to the entire age every mystery
[54:05] that was sealed from the foundation of
[54:07] the
[54:10] world oh give the Lord some Praises
[54:14] people are you with me
[54:18] Hallelujah and in Revelation 10 the
[54:20] mighty angel came with his book open
[54:23] every mystery revealed every mystery
[54:25] unfolded the book was open open it was
[54:27] sealed with Seven Seals no man could
[54:29] look at it no man could touch it but the
[54:31] lamb died and take the book and loose it
[54:34] on the earth and the prophet was there
[54:36] to catch it because the word of the Lord
[54:38] comes to a prophet the word of the Lord
[54:40] comes to a prophet the word of the Lord
[54:42] written voice word comes to a prophet it
[54:46] must be in the book it must be written
[54:50] that's why he said the seven tunders
[54:52] after a while you're going to find where
[54:55] it is written
[54:56] [Applause]
[55:05] you may be seated so Revelation 108 the
[55:08] voice said go to the angel with the book
[55:12] and eat it because you have to live by
[55:14] it man shall by bread alone but by every
[55:18] word of the open book so once the book
[55:21] is open you can eat it you can't eat the
[55:23] sealed book you have to eat the open
[55:25] book and once the Myster is revealed you
[55:28] can eat it because the secret things
[55:30] belong to God but the things that are
[55:32] revealed belongto us and to our children
[55:36] that we may do the whole works of the
[55:38] Lord so once it's revealed that's ours
[55:41] that's mes give me my Mountain come on
[55:45] now church are you getting it are you
[55:49] seeing it
[55:50] [Applause]
[56:00] so these men either they were put out
[56:04] got out because they were convicted of
[56:07] the sin of organization hallelujah how
[56:10] can the Holy Spirit possibly be in an
[56:14] organization when it is organization
[56:16] that takes the place of the spirit and
[56:19] denomination take the place of the word
[56:22] remember organization is debt yes if the
[56:26] world takes over the spirit departs here
[56:30] we go yes the spirit is not seven
[56:33] spirits but one he will always be the
[56:35] same and act the same and the Seven
[56:39] Messengers will have the same spirit and
[56:42] teach the same word and have the same
[56:46] power and if the true church is the true
[56:50] church it will have the very same spirit
[56:53] and word and acts of power that they had
[56:56] of of Pentecost by experience it is a
[56:59] Pentecostal Church there will be tongues
[57:02] interpretations prophecy healings God
[57:05] will be in the midst of her God will
[57:07] declare himself in the midst of her as
[57:09] he always has and he will she will be
[57:11] unorganized don't forget that we have
[57:14] some more to say so sit at the edge of
[57:17] your seat and listen
[57:19] carefully now we see that Jesus Christ
[57:23] is revealing himself Through the Ages by
[57:26] his Spirit In The Messengers they are as
[57:29] Moses was to the children of Israel he
[57:32] had the Revelation for his day here we
[57:35] go so each messenger has God's
[57:39] revelation and Ministry for that day
[57:42] thus when we see that the messengers are
[57:45] in his hand we see the Lord identifying
[57:49] himself with these men and granting them
[57:52] his power amen it is not enough that he
[57:57] has Associated himself with the whole
[57:59] church which we saw when he was standing
[58:02] again among the seven Golden Lamb stands
[58:04] now it is even enough here we go there's
[58:08] a ton there's a bum
[58:10] hereall now is it enough that we see the
[58:13] fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4
[58:16] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[58:19] pastors for in each age the church goes
[58:24] astray but it is not just the
[58:27] lady but the clergy
[58:30] group that Bunch soal fold there he said
[58:34] the shepherds are wrong as well as the
[58:36] Sheep my God so when you hear a church
[58:40] go astray it's not just the bunch of
[58:42] lady going astray it's
[58:46] Shepherds and
[58:47] [Music]
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:49] sheep then God brings himself on the
[58:53] scene as the chief Shepherd yes in the
[58:57] ministry of these seven men to lead his
[59:00] people back to the
[59:05] truth oh give the Lord a praise
[59:10] offering
[59:13] Glory so religious men spiritual men
[59:16] pastors Evangel and whatnot the start of
[59:18] God in the word afterwards the backslide
[59:20] deteriorate and the form Church big
[59:22] steeple that's
[59:25] right s me and God send some men to
[59:28] bring the
[59:29] word Luther Wesley Columba all bring the
[59:32] word to them these men bringing light
[59:34] for the age isn't that right isn't
[59:37] something else Hallelujah seven churches
[59:39] is set
[59:41] forth if Ephesus pamus Titar
[59:45] Philadelphia he said he had an air come
[59:50] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[59:54] to the ages to the churches notice here
[59:58] that Jesus by the spirit in every age
[1:00:02] addresses himself to one
[1:00:04] person relative to the word for that age
[1:00:08] here we go are you ready listen to this
[1:00:12] statement
[1:00:13] only one messenger for each age receives
[1:00:18] what the spirit has to say for that age
[1:00:22] that's
[1:00:24] right one message
[1:00:27] receive all for the entire
[1:00:33] age
[1:00:34] all not some
[1:00:41] all one man in the Age receive all for
[1:00:45] the entire age so if the age stands strs
[1:00:48] 400 years what he says is to stand for
[1:00:51] 400
[1:00:52] years because it's the word for the
[1:00:54] entire age one man a man sent from God a
[1:00:59] man in his right hand one of the Seven
[1:01:01] Stars one of the seven voices one of the

[1:03:30] that message is received individually by
[1:03:35] only a certain qualified group in a
[1:03:39] certain way each individual of that
[1:03:43] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:03:48] what the spirit is saying by way of the

[1:05:26] pass and the manifestation is the
[1:05:29] interpretation we don't know man to
[1:05:31] interpret what the prophet already
[1:05:32] interpreted for us we don't need no
[1:05:34] man's Spirit to be loosed among us we

[1:24:16] hstone oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory
[1:24:21] Glory
[1:24:26] now watch in every age we have the same
[1:24:28] pattern that is why the light comes
[1:24:30] through some god-given messenger here we
[1:24:32] go in a certain area and then from that
[1:24:37] messenger there spreads the light
[1:24:41] through the ministry of others who have
[1:24:44] been Faithfully taught so the messenger
[1:24:47] brings the light and from that light
[1:24:51] others draw to preach but of course here
[1:24:55] we go all those who go out don't always
[1:24:59] learn how necessary it is to speak only
[1:25:04] what the messenger has
[1:25:06] spoken remember Paul warned the people
[1:25:09] to say only what he said 1 Corinthians
[1:25:12] 14:37 If any man think himself to be a
[1:25:14] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:25:16] that the things that I write unto you
[1:25:18] are the Commandments of the Lord what
[1:25:21] came the word of the Lord from you or
[1:25:22] came unto you only the they added here
[1:25:25] they take away there and soon the
[1:25:27] message is no longer pure the Revival
[1:25:30] dies down how careful we must be to hear
[1:25:33] one voice here we go for the spirit has
[1:25:37] but one voice which is the voice of
[1:25:41] God even Paul said he couldn't change
[1:25:45] what he had
[1:25:46] said he said if we or an angel come down
[1:25:50] from heaven and preach any other thing
[1:25:53] let him be a curse
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:56] Paul said I can't change what came out
[1:25:59] from the mouth of God do not hear what
[1:26:01] I'm
[1:26:03] saying when God spoke to his mouth he
[1:26:06] can't change
[1:26:08] it this is real you are going to be
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:17] delivered Glory listen to this
[1:26:21] Hallelujah he that he that has an Al
[1:26:23] here with the spirit in the church
[1:26:25] in every age it was the same cry hear
[1:26:29] what the spirit says if you a Christian
[1:26:32] you will get back to what the spirit is
[1:26:34] teaching that is the word for this age
[1:26:38] every Messenger to every age will preach
[1:26:40] the word every fresh here we go are you
[1:26:42] ready every fresh and true revelation
[1:26:45] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:26:49] the word for their ageu The Cry of every
[1:26:51] age is the rebuke you have left the word
[1:26:53] of God
[1:26:54] repent come back to the word from the
[1:26:57] first book in the Bible Genesis to the
[1:26:59] last book Revelation there's only one
[1:27:02] reason for God displeasure that is
[1:27:04] leaving the word oh blessed be the name
[1:27:06] of the Lord he said these men he said
[1:27:09] they they were denounced by by
[1:27:11] organization now it is not hard to stand
[1:27:14] up and keep true to a Creed it is easy
[1:27:17] for the Devil is right behind all of
[1:27:18] that but it's something else to stay
[1:27:21] with the true word oh praise God
[1:27:24] could you we I'm going to hit the home
[1:27:26] stretch now let's look at uh Jeremiah
[1:27:29] chap 23 you don't have to find it but if
[1:27:30] you want to read with me I want to read
[1:27:32] some scripture to show you God's
[1:27:34] thinking God's thoughts God mind
[1:27:38] concerning
[1:27:40] pastors concerning sheep let's look at
[1:27:43] Jeremiah chapter 23 we read woe be unto
[1:27:46] the
[1:27:47] pastors wow is that real I thought all
[1:27:52] pastors are lovely men
[1:27:54] saints of God men of the
[1:27:58] cloth and God say woe unto the men of
[1:28:01] the
[1:28:02] cloth pastors that destroy scatter the
[1:28:05] Sheep of my pastor say the Lord
[1:28:08] therefore thus sayth the Lord God of
[1:28:10] Israel against the pastor that Feed My
[1:28:12] People ye have scattered my flock driven
[1:28:14] them away have not visited them behold I
[1:28:19] will visit upon you the evil of your
[1:28:22] doing sayeth the Lord
[1:28:24] and I will gather the remnant of my
[1:28:26] flock out of all countries where I have
[1:28:28] driven them and will bring them into
[1:28:30] their fs and they shall be fruitful and
[1:28:33] increase I will set up Shepherds over
[1:28:36] them that would feed them and they shall
[1:28:39] fear no more nor be dismayed neither
[1:28:42] shall they be lacking sayeth the Lord
[1:28:45] behold the days come sayth the Lord that
[1:28:46] I will raise up David A righteous branch
[1:28:48] and the King shall reign and prosper
[1:28:51] shall execute judgment and Justice in
[1:28:52] the earth in his day Judah shall be
[1:28:54] saved and right and Israel shall dwell
[1:28:56] in safely and this is his name whereby
[1:28:59] he shall be called the Lord our
[1:29:00] righteousness therefore behold the days
[1:29:03] come sayeth the Lord they shall no more
[1:29:04] say the Lord liveth which brought up the
[1:29:06] children of Israel of the land of Egypt
[1:29:08] but the Lord liveth which brought up and
[1:29:10] which led the seed of the House of
[1:29:12] Israel out of the North country from all
[1:29:14] countries where I have driven them and
[1:29:16] they shall dwell in their own land my
[1:29:18] heart within me is broken because of the
[1:29:21] prophets all my bones Shake I'm like a
[1:29:25] drunken man like a man whose wine have
[1:29:27] overcome because the Lord because of the
[1:29:30] Lord and because the words of his
[1:29:31] Holiness for the land is full of
[1:29:32] adulterers for because of swearing the
[1:29:35] land mournet the pleasant place of the
[1:29:37] Wilderness are dried up their course is
[1:29:39] evil and their force is not right for
[1:29:42] both prophet and priest are profane Y in
[1:29:45] my house are found their wickedness
[1:29:46] sayith the Lord wherefore their way
[1:29:50] shall be unto them a slippery ways of
[1:29:52] Darkness they shall be driven on and and
[1:29:54] fall therein for I will bring evil upon
[1:29:56] them even the year of their visitation
[1:29:59] this what people don't know sayeth the
[1:30:01] Lord and I have seen the Folly in the
[1:30:04] prophets of Samaria prophets now they
[1:30:08] prophesy in Baal and caused My People
[1:30:11] Israel to ear I have seen the prophets
[1:30:14] of

[1:30:18] adultery walking lies listen they
[1:30:20] strengthen the hands of the evildoers
[1:30:23] that none return from his wickedness the
[1:30:26] all of them unto me are Sodom and of the
[1:30:29] inhabitants of Gomorrah therefore th
[1:30:31] sayth the Lord of hosts concerning the
[1:30:34] prophets behold I will feed them with
[1:30:35] wormwood and make them drink water of G
[1:30:39] for from the prophets of Jerusalem is
[1:30:41] profanes gone forth all the land thus
[1:30:44] sayth the Lord of hosts listen here we
[1:30:46] go ha not unto the words of the prophets
[1:30:50] that prophesy unto you they make you
[1:30:52] vain they speak a vision of their own
[1:30:55] heart and not out of the mouth of the
[1:30:58] Lord they say they say still unto them
[1:31:01] that despise me watch the Lord said he
[1:31:04] shall have
[1:31:05] peace and they say unto everyone that
[1:31:07] walketh in the imagin of Their Own Heart
[1:31:09] no evil shall come upon you for who had
[1:31:12] stood in the councel of the Lord and
[1:31:14] perceived and heard his word who had
[1:31:16] marked his word and heard it Behold a
[1:31:18] whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in
[1:31:20] Fury even a grievous Whirlwind it shall
[1:31:22] fall grievously upon upon the head of
[1:31:24] the wicked the anger of the Lord shall
[1:31:26] not return until he have executed till
[1:31:29] he have performed the thoughts of his
[1:31:30] heart in the latter days he shall
[1:31:31] considered perfectly I have not sent
[1:31:36] these prophets yet they ran I have not
[1:31:41] spoken to them yet they prophesied but
[1:31:45] if they had stood in my counsel and had
[1:31:47] cause my people to hear my words then
[1:31:50] they should have turned them from the
[1:31:52] evil ways and from evil doings am I a
[1:31:56] god at hand say the Lord or a god a far
[1:31:59] off can any hide himself in secret
[1:32:02] places and I shall not see him sayth the
[1:32:05] Lord do I not fill Heaven and Earth
[1:32:07] sayeth the Lord I have heard that what
[1:32:09] the prophet said that prophesy lies in
[1:32:11] my name I have dreamed I have dreamed
[1:32:14] how long shall this be in the heart of
[1:32:15] the prophets the prophesy lies yay they
[1:32:19] are prophets of Deceit of their own
[1:32:21] heart which think to cause my people to
[1:32:24] forget my name by their dreams which it
[1:32:26] tell every man to his neighbor as their
[1:32:28] fathers have forgotten my name for Beal
[1:32:30] the prophet that had a dream let him
[1:32:32] tell a dream he that at my word let him
[1:32:34] speak my word Faithfully what is chaff
[1:32:37] to the wheat sayth the Lord is not my
[1:32:39] word like a fire say the Lord I like a
[1:32:41] hammer that break the Rock in pieces
[1:32:44] therefore behold I am against the
[1:32:45] prophets sayth the Lord that steal my
[1:32:48] words everyone from his neighbor behold
[1:32:50] I'm against the prophets sayth the Lord
[1:32:52] that use their tongues and said he SA
[1:32:53] yet behold I'm against them that
[1:32:55] prophesy false dreams sayeth the Lord
[1:32:58] and do tell them and cause my people to
[1:33:00] ear by their lies and by their likeness
[1:33:03] yet I sent them not nor commanded them
[1:33:06] therefore they shall not profit this
[1:33:07] people at all sayeth the Lord may God
[1:33:09] bless his word I read that to you to let
[1:33:13] you know how God sees things is not as
[1:33:16] man sees it is as God sees it we need to
[1:33:20] get back to the word from the mouth of
[1:33:22] God because when God speaks it's got to
[1:33:25] come to pass isn't that right I'm about
[1:33:28] to close Hallelujah I want to ask you
[1:33:30] something B I'm saying Jo witness is
[1:33:32] loyal to what they believe the Baptist
[1:33:34] is loyal to what they believe why can't
[1:33:36] we be loyal to the word amen to the word
[1:33:40] I want to ask you something you say well
[1:33:42] brother brandham how do you know they
[1:33:43] are not now if those Pharisees and
[1:33:45] Sadducees and leaders of that day
[1:33:47] musician come please that would have got
[1:33:50] away from their Creeds and their dogmas
[1:33:53] and listen to what the word said what
[1:33:55] Jesus was telling them just exactly but
[1:33:59] listen to this part they Tau so much of
[1:34:01] their leaders they wasn't bad men they
[1:34:04] wouldn't lie steal cuss anything like
[1:34:06] that they wouldn't do that they wouldn't
[1:34:07] commit adultery certainly not they would
[1:34:09] witness why they were good men but the
[1:34:12] only thing there wasn't spiritual men oh
[1:34:17] hallelujah oh Hallelujah I'm closing a
[1:34:20] momentary consideration of the church
[1:34:21] history would prove go God sent the word
[1:34:25] in Luther's day Luther spoke for God at
[1:34:27] that time they organized again pure word
[1:34:30] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:34:32] dogma and Creed they not simple word
[1:34:34] they could no longer speak for God then
[1:34:36] God sent Wesley he was the voice with
[1:34:38] the word in that day the people who took
[1:34:40] his Revelation from God became living
[1:34:42] Epistles rather known of all men for
[1:34:44] their generation when the Methodist fail
[1:34:46] God rais up others so it has gone on
[1:34:48] through the years until again there's
[1:34:51] another people in the land who under
[1:34:53] them messenger that same one Messenger
[1:34:56] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:34:58] here we go are you ready yeah the church
[1:35:01] is no longer the mouthpiece of God it it
[1:35:04] his own mouthpiece so God is turning on
[1:35:08] her he will confound her through the
[1:35:10] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[1:35:13] God will be in her oh blessed be the
[1:35:15] name of the Lord praise God and look as
[1:35:19] I close Samuel old Eli rather old priest
[1:35:24] isn't that right Samuel a young man the
[1:35:27] priest so old in the message at that
[1:35:29] time he couldn't have the ability to
[1:35:31] hear from God so God find this young man
[1:35:33] Samuel begin to speak to him because
[1:35:36] Samuel and his sons were doing evil in
[1:35:38] sight of God and so on isn't that right
[1:35:40] and he said now the work has being done
[1:35:42] he said and today one reason that the
[1:35:43] church is in the condition it's in is
[1:35:45] because there are so many voices so many
[1:35:47] voices to attract the church from the
[1:35:49] voice of God so it's very doubtful that
[1:35:51] many would even hear the voice of God
[1:35:54] though it spoke right in the midst they
[1:35:56] perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[1:35:58] there are so many voices on the Earth
[1:35:59] today that is absolutely a hard thing
[1:36:03] because it deadened the voice of the
[1:36:05] supernatural oh my there are so many
[1:36:08] intellectual voices great voices of
[1:36:10] mighty men who are intellectual and in
[1:36:12] that intellectual condition they even
[1:36:13] Shake Nations they are not overnight
[1:36:16] persons but they Shake Nations and it'll
[1:36:19] bring confusion and so forth and their
[1:36:21] voices raise up and it causes The Voice
[1:36:23] voice of God to be placed
[1:36:25] somewhere with the true from the true
[1:36:27] voice of God and the voice of God they
[1:36:29] say how will we noce the voice of God
[1:36:31] because today it was in the Vindicated
[1:36:33] Prophet now today how do we know it's
[1:36:35] the voice of God are we ready am because
[1:36:38] it's a manifestation of the prophet's
[1:36:40] word this is God's prophet and a true
[1:36:43] voice of God only brings back that real
[1:36:46] living Supernatural god with his
[1:36:48] Supernatural word with the supernatural
[1:36:50] manifestation of the true word that's
[1:36:52] the voice of God
[1:36:54] may the Lord richly bless you oh praise
