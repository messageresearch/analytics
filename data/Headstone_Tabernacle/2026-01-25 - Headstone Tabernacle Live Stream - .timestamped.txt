[16:32] I thank your prayer, Lord. Amen. For
[16:36] your goodness and your mercy. Are you
[16:38] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[16:40] this morning?
[16:41] Are you happy to be found alive in his
[16:43] hands?
[16:45] Doesn't matter what happens, as long as
[16:48] I'm in his hands,
[16:50] &gt;&gt; I know I'll be all right.
[16:52] God [music] bless you this morning as we
[16:53] find our Bibles. Welcome to the house of
[16:56] the Lord.
[16:58] Uh we like to turn [music] our Bibles
[16:59] over to Psalms chapter 100 for a
[17:02] scripture reading this morning.
[17:05] A psalm of praise this morning. Amen.
[17:08] And I know you're familiar with it. So
[17:10] if you know it, say it along with me as
[17:12] we read this morning from the Holy Rit,
[17:15] Psalms 100. that says, "Make a joyful
[17:17] noise unto the Lord, all ye lands."
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord with gladness. Come
[17:25] before his presence with singing. Know
[17:29] ye that the Lord he is God. [music] It
[17:32] is he that had made us and not we
[17:34] ourselves. [music] We are his people and
[17:38] the sheep of his pasture. [music] Enter
[17:41] into his gates with thanksgiving and
[17:44] into his courts with praise. Be thankful
[17:47] unto him, [music]
[17:49] and bless his name. For the Lord is
[17:52] good, his mercy is everlasting,
[17:56] and his truth endureth to all
[17:59] generations. May God add blessing to the
[18:01] reading of his word this morning. Can we
[18:03] praise him? Oh, hallelujah. Glory to
[18:06] God. Thank you, Jesus. We're here to
[18:08] make a joyful noise this morning. Let us
[18:11] bow our heads and pray. Amen. Heavenly
[18:14] Father, we thank you, Lord, to be here
[18:17] this morning. [music]
[18:19] To be alive in your grace, Lord. Father,
[18:21] we did not bring ourselves, Lord. We did
[18:24] not call ourselves, Father. We did not
[18:26] save ourselves. Neither could we choose
[18:28] ourselves. You chose us, Lord. Father,
[18:31] before the foundation of the world,
[18:33] Lord. Father, you brought us forth,
[18:34] Lord. You took us out of the miry clay.
[18:38] You put our foot on a rock this morning.
[18:41] And that rock is Jesus [music] Christ.
[18:44] Uh there's no great thing of us, Lord
[18:46] Father, that we could exalt this
[18:47] morning. There is nothing higher than
[18:49] you today. [music] We give you the
[18:51] highest praise, Lord Father, because you
[18:54] deserve it, Lord Father. Because there's
[18:56] no one else like you this [music]
[18:57] morning. So we come into the tabernacle
[19:00] today. We come to lift up holy hands,
[19:03] Lord Father, to acknowledge you, Lord,
[19:05] as God and Savior, [music] as creator of
[19:08] our lives. Oh God, Father, you are
[19:10] founded it upon the seas and establish
[19:12] it upon the floods. Lord, we pray that
[19:15] you establish your word here this
[19:16] morning. Establish your anointing in us
[19:18] this morning, Father, as we surround,
[19:21] Lord, the throne of God this morning
[19:23] with praise, honor, and glory, joining
[19:25] with the angels that never cease to
[19:27] worship you, dear God, for all of your
[19:29] goodness and your mercies, Lord, for the
[19:32] generations and generations. We praise
[19:34] you this morning. We give you glory. We
[19:36] give you honor. We come to worship and
[19:38] adore you this morning. We come to
[19:40] create an atmosphere in the house of God
[19:42] that you would be pleased [singing] to
[19:43] come down in and dwell with us, Lord,
[19:46] and minister to our hearts and lives,
[19:48] Father, as we look to you, God. Our eyes
[19:51] are steadfast upon you, Lord. Father,
[19:54] Lord, to see what you would speak to us,
[19:56] Lord. We are ready in waiting this
[19:58] morning. Pour out your spirit this
[20:00] morning. Pour out your anointing,
[20:03] Father. May you touch lives today, Lord.
[20:06] Touch us in the physical realm. Touch us
[20:08] in the spirit, Lord. Father, touch all
[20:11] weary souls this morning. Give strength
[20:13] to the weary. Give grace to the humble.
[20:16] Father, may you pour out healing upon
[20:18] those that are sick. May you raise up
[20:20] the town and Lord, may you bless, oh
[20:22] God, the mothers, the fathers, the
[20:24] husbands, the wives, Lord, the children,
[20:26] oh God. Father, may you fill this place
[20:28] with your with your holy presence. Even
[20:31] those that are on the internet this
[20:32] morning hooking in, Lord, [music]
[20:34] listening online, we pray you bless them
[20:36] wherever they may be. Father, may your
[20:38] anointing poured upon them also. Bless
[20:40] your [music] servant as he yields
[20:41] himself to be used mightily of the
[20:44] spirit. Lord, we want today to be a
[20:46] glorious and blessed day. We surrender
[20:48] it to you, Lord, that your mighty works
[20:50] would be done in it, Father. All that is
[20:53] to happen thereafter, we commit it into
[20:55] your hands. We pray, Father, have your
[20:57] way in Jesus Christ's precious name. We
[20:59] pray and ask and commit these things.
[21:02] Amen. And amen and amen. Can we give the
[21:05] Lord a praise offering? [music]
[21:07] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father.

[49:08] &gt;&gt; Father, we praise you. We bless your

[49:28] for the presence with you this morning
[49:31] and we are grateful. Amen. Praise God.
[49:34] God bless you. It's good to be home. I
[49:37] know you were blessed last week with the
[49:39] message from Pastor Ulu, the house that
[49:42] love built.
[49:45] Amen. Brother Steven Oliver sent me this
[49:47] testimony.
[49:48] God bless you, brother. I have a small
[49:50] testimony. I was listening to uh William
[49:53] Brown's message this week [music] and at
[49:55] the end he was praying for the sick and
[49:57] each time he was saying do you believe
[50:00] me to be [music] God's prophet God's
[50:03] servant I asked myself for a moment why
[50:05] is it that he had to ask each person
[50:07] that question it played on my mind a bit
[50:11] but today God in his great love for me
[50:14] explained the answer in such great
[50:16] detail it could not have been a better
[50:18] explained it was truly God thank support
[50:20] for the meeting every need through his
[50:22] word through his ministry. So praise God
[50:25] he was really blessed with brother's
[50:27] message and also we had three baptisms
[50:30] last Sunday and I was very pleased how
[50:32] this unfolded in the absence of brother
[50:34] Isaac and I. God bless you all and was
[50:37] very happy to hear the report. Amen.
[50:40] [applause] Also
[50:42] want to thank brother Steven uh for
[50:45] overseeing the baptism service and for
[50:47] brother Andy and for brother Adrian for
[50:49] conducting the baptisms and so on.
[50:52] [applause]
[50:53] You know when I was heard about the
[50:55] baptism and and brother but Isaac and I
[50:57] will be out. Um somebody said if we do
[50:59] when we come back I said not not at all
[51:01] the church have to move on. And this is
[51:02] what we want to see. We want to see that
[51:04] nothing must hinder
[51:06] &gt;&gt; what has to be done. Praise God. It's
[51:09] not the church is not built upon us. It
[51:11] built upon Jesus Christ the rock of
[51:13] revelation. Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we also want to thank uh
[51:18] brother Sein Barandi, brother Adrian and
[51:19] also for brother Anthony songs at the
[51:21] baptism service. No brother Isaac was in
[51:23] Lagos Nigeria where he ministered in
[51:25] pastor de church and also pastor Lou's
[51:28] church and the Lord did bless
[51:29] tremendously.
[51:31] So last weekend I was in Miami in two
[51:33] churches in Miami and I preached on the
[51:36] latter rain is fixing to fall and um
[51:39] another message the restoration of the
[51:41] person of Christ to the bride by Malachi
[51:43] 4. Now in the latter rain fixing to fall
[51:47] just want to read a quote from it. What
[51:48] is the seed of life? The word of God.
[51:51] Therefore for life you can't come
[51:54] through a creed. You can't come through
[51:57] a denomination. You have got to come
[51:59] back to the word. This to do with a
[52:00] group thing. What church you go to on
[52:02] tabernacle have nothing to do with that.
[52:04] You've got to come back to the word now.
[52:06] The seed of life. All right. His word is
[52:08] a seed and his spirit is the water. So
[52:11] it's not just word word. The word is a
[52:14] seed,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; but the spirit is the water.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Right back to John 3:13. Jesus is the
[52:19] word of God. Yeah. Here we go now. And
[52:22] he that was to be busted open
[52:25] that life. So Jesus just just didn't die
[52:28] at Calvary and pay the price. You know
[52:30] &gt;&gt; his that seed had to break open
[52:33] &gt;&gt; that life could be released and that's
[52:35] why you in this building this morning
[52:37] &gt;&gt; because his life is what reach you
[52:39] &gt;&gt; because no man could come except the
[52:41] father by his spirit pulls and draws and
[52:44] woos. So if the spirit had draw you
[52:46] can't come
[52:49] &gt;&gt; if the spirit haven't drawn you. You
[52:51] cannot come.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; You can only come because something is
[52:53] moving you. Remember the devil pulling
[52:55] to you now. Devil pulling downwards, God
[52:57] pulling upwards.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So God pull you to get you where you
[53:00] are.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You might be broken, but he still got
[53:05] you.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; You might be wounded, but he still got
[53:08] you. You may have dirt and mud on you,
[53:10] but he STILL GOT YOU. HE COULD clean you
[53:12] UP, BUT HE GOT YOU. Give the Lord some
[53:15] praises. There's no reason for anybody
[53:17] inside of here not to praise God this
[53:19] morning because HE GOT YOU. WHATEVER
[53:22] CONDITION IS, he got you. HE HAVE YOUR
[53:25] BACK. HE GOT YOU.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. Hallelujah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Here we go now. Therefore, if the spirit
[53:32] of God comes forth to water the seed, if
[53:35] it's a seed, it's watering, it'll
[53:36] produce a life in the seed.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Is that clear? It produce the life of
[53:40] the seed. And that's what is given for.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the restoration of the person
[53:44] of Christ by the bride by Malachi 4. God
[53:47] didn't sell God didn't send a prophet
[53:48] William Brandham for us to be preaching
[53:50] William Brandham.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's not the object. Brandon Brandon
[53:54] Brandom. I know the purpose. He sent a
[53:56] prophet. A prophet is for purpose. You
[53:58] know, as John the Baptist was sent to
[54:00] forun my coming, first coming, you have
[54:02] a message that was for my second coming.
[54:05] God sent William Brandham to introduce
[54:07] Jesus Christ.
[54:11] Let me say it good. God sent William
[54:13] Brham to introduce THE PERSON OF JESUS
[54:16] CHRIST. THE PENTECOSTALS ONLY HAD GIFTS.
[54:19] They didn't have the person
[54:21] &gt;&gt; because the person comes by the word
[54:23] &gt;&gt; and the word is in that pyramid there.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; FAITH AND VIRTUE AND KNOWLEDGE AND
[54:27] TEMPERANCE. THAT'S JESUS CHRIST.
[54:29] [cheering]
[54:29] [applause]
[54:31] &gt;&gt; So let me give you his own words here
[54:33] now. And my inspiration in that message
[54:35] was from the prophet to his prophecy.
[54:37] People stuck at the prophet. But what
[54:38] about the prophecy?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet that come to say I'm a
[54:41] prophet. I'm a prophet. I'm a prophet.
[54:42] You have a prophet. What are you doing
[54:43] with that?
[54:43] &gt;&gt; The prophet come the prophesy.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to get from the prophet
[54:47] to the prophecy.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; All the time they were prophesying.
[54:50] Messiah coming. Messiah coming. Here
[54:51] come John the Baptist. He said, "Behold
[54:53] the lamb OF GOD." AND RIGHT THERE IT
[54:55] SWITCH FROM THE PROPHET
[54:57] &gt;&gt; to the prophecy.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Follow him.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Who him? Jesus Christ. Well, give the
[55:02] Lord some praises.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; This is the words of William Brham. We
[55:06] are not building an organization. I am
[55:08] not here this morning to build an
[55:10] organization. Christ never sent me to
[55:14] build an organization. Christ sent me to
[55:17] build individuals to the stature of
[55:20] Jesus Christ that they MIGHT BE A
[55:22] POWERHOUSE AND A DWELLING place of the
[55:25] spirit BY HIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE
[55:28] GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE A
[55:31] POWERHOUSE. NOT A DEPENDENT HOUSE, NOT A
[55:35] LOOSE HOUSE, A STACK HOUSE.
[55:39] I'm not HEARING YOU. GOD SENT YOU TO BE
[55:42] A [screaming] POWERHOUSE.
[55:45] POWERED BY THE SPIRIT,
[55:47] &gt;&gt; POWERED BY THE WORD,
[55:52] [cheering]

[55:56] &gt;&gt; not we Christians. All these drones they
[55:59] flying on all these drones with Ukraine
[56:00] and attacking. But these things are very
[56:02] accurate. You know,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; you could be emotional about essay
[56:08] writing and thing you got 90 or 80. You
[56:10] see mathematics it have no mystics with
[56:12] that you know four and four still equal
[56:14] eight you know
[56:16] &gt;&gt; unless you say four and four is 44 oh
[56:18] yeah you seeing that but 4 + 4 will

[56:44] it's finished.
[56:47] [applause]
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Let me be seated. This bride age in is a
[56:51] mystery. You know, you have no scripture
[56:52] say bright.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; You only have but God pull you out on
[56:57] top of brotherly kindness. Have that
[56:59] Holy Spirit slot. God pull you out THIS

[57:12] YOU HAVE TO COME OUT OF THAT.
[57:16] [cheering and applause]
[57:18] HALLELUJAH.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Let's say again, Christ did not send me
[57:21] to buildation. Christ sent me to build
[57:23] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[57:25] Christ. Not to follow some man,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; not to follow some church.
[57:30] BECAUSE THIS IS THE AGE of maturity.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; I can't say it here now. That's a whole
[57:34] message by itself. The reason the
[57:36] Pentecostals couldn't get the mystery is
[57:37] because he said they were begotten.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? They were in
[57:40] the womb.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; The baby had born yet
[57:43] &gt;&gt; up to now with all the million dollar
[57:45] billings they have, all the million
[57:46] dollar congregation they have, all the
[57:48] thousands and thousands, they're still
[57:49] failing and falling. They have no life
[57:53] &gt;&gt; because the LIFE COME BY THE WORD
[57:55] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD COMES TO A PROPHET AND THEY
[57:57] TURN ON THE PROPHET. THEY TURN ON THE
[57:59] LIFE. [screaming] THEY HAVE CHURCH, THEY
[58:00] HAVE MILLION, THEY AIRPLANE, THEY HAVE
[58:02] THIS, THAT EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT it
[58:03] and they still falling one by one. It
[58:05] has to fall, has to fail because man
[58:07] kingdom has coming down. DANIEL SAY I
[58:09] SEE A ROCK cut up without the hands of
[58:11] man. What you're about to see is without
[58:13] the hands of man. NO MESSAGE MAN, NO
[58:16] MESSAGE POP, NO PASTOR MAN, NO MAN AT
[58:19] ALL. HALLELUJAH. CHRIST SAID UPON THIS
[58:22] ROCK I WILL BUILD. LOOK AT ME START HERE
[58:25] THIS MORNING. MY CHURCH JESUS HAVE A
[58:27] CHURCH YOU KNOW THAT CHURCH IS A KINGDOM
[58:30] AND THE KINGDOM IS WORD AND NEW COVENANT

[58:37] CALLED THE CHURCH NO MAN AND NO HEAD ARE
[58:39] YOU OKAY THE LORD HAS SHOUTED THE HOUSE
[58:42] NO MAN IS NO HEAD OF NO BRA [cheering]
[58:45] AND NO MAN HEAD NOWHERE

[58:54] SOUTH AMERICAN MAN TRINIDAD MAN. WHEN
[58:57] THEY SAY GOOD AND GET THEIR HEAD, the
[58:59] head man in charge OF HIS BRIDE. HE IS
[59:02] THE HEAD OF THE BODY. [cheering]
[59:04] [applause]
[59:05] &gt;&gt; MAN COULD HOLD THE CHURCH BUT NOT THE
[59:07] BRIDE.
[59:10] [cheering]
[59:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; These stars falling into the
[59:19] constellation backyard that angel
[59:20] coming. I said, "And John the Bapt was
[59:22] sent to wind up the Old Testament and to
[59:25] bring forth the introduction of Christ,
[59:27] a message will wind up the loose ends
[59:32] &gt;&gt; and introduce the Messiah."
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Just before his coming.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Introduce who?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Aha. You mean brother Brandham came to
[59:40] introduce the Messiah?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. The Messiah came down in
[59:43] Revelation 10.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The Lord himself the seven of
[59:46] them with a shout with the book open AND
[59:50] SEVEN THUNDERS BUST OUT them books bust
[59:52] out those voices. Those voices was
[59:54] loosed to the bride together to get the
[59:57] bride faith TO SHOW THE BRIDE HOW TO
[59:59] PREPARE. THAT IS ONLY BRIGHT THING NOT
[1:00:02] BRIDE MAID BRIGHT THING.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He come to get that bride. Go get that
[1:00:06] bride.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; There are millions of church members but
[1:00:09] the bride is a minority.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So I was blessed
[1:00:14] to have to be in a ministers meeting
[1:00:16] over there also. So praise God. Uh very
[1:00:20] happy for what the Lord is doing and we
[1:00:23] can only expect greater things. So let's
[1:00:24] stand. We want to go into the word one
[1:00:26] scripture. This is the first time I
[1:00:27] think I only read on a one verse
[1:00:29] scripture here.
[1:00:31] So
[1:00:34] Galatians 4:19 just one verse.
[1:00:45] My little children of whom I travail in
[1:00:49] birth until Christ be formed in you.
[1:00:53] Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, we
[1:00:55] thank you for your word and your
[1:00:56] scriptures. And I pray you'd come down
[1:00:59] in a special way among your people. God,
[1:01:01] you know what you placed upon my heart
[1:01:03] and what to share. And I pray that you
[1:01:06] would honor your word this morning.
[1:01:07] Confirm it with signs, wonders, and
[1:01:08] miracles and report your Holy Spirit
[1:01:10] upon the lives of your children. May
[1:01:12] lives be changed here, Lord. May lives
[1:01:14] be transformed here that many come, they
[1:01:16] hear, they go back home, and all they do
[1:01:17] is hear. But I pray today that you would
[1:01:20] arrest them that they will go beyond
[1:01:22] hearing and they go to acting upon the
[1:01:23] word and receiving. Granted, Father, in
[1:01:25] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be
[1:01:27] seated. Praise God.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I got a a note from a brother. I just a
[1:01:37] question that I'd like to read for you.
[1:01:40] Greetings, brother over in the precious
[1:01:41] name of Jesus.
[1:01:43] I pray that this correspondence meets
[1:01:45] you in good health and strength. I
[1:01:46] choose to write rather than speak so
[1:01:50] that my thoughts would be properly
[1:01:51] ordered and not come across as
[1:01:53] scattered.
[1:01:55] In the latter part of 2025, I've been
[1:01:57] making it a daily habit
[1:02:01] to listen to a message from the prophet
[1:02:04] or to one of our church services in its
[1:02:06] entirety.
[1:02:08] Did you hear that?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; I get two amens.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Because it say here, I made it a daily
[1:02:18] habit.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; You see before it comes unconscious
[1:02:21] habit or conscious doing, you have to
[1:02:22] consciously do it.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Because habit actually produces
[1:02:27] character in life.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; To listen to a message from the prophet
[1:02:35] or to one of our church services in its
[1:02:38] entirety.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; On January 19, 2026 around 7:15 p.m.
[1:02:44] While searching through YouTube under
[1:02:46] the tab title righteousness, I came
[1:02:47] across a trailer for our July 2020
[1:02:50] virtual convention. I allowed it to play
[1:02:53] through its entirety and immediately
[1:02:55] after it ended, it transitioned into a
[1:02:58] sermon preached by you on May 15 prior
[1:03:00] to the convention. The title of the
[1:03:02] sermon was, "Let us cross Jordan
[1:03:05] to an open vision of another Ephesians."
[1:03:08] What struck me as unusual was that the
[1:03:11] sermon began playing from the middle of
[1:03:14] the service. From that message, what
[1:03:16] stayed with me most was that a as
[1:03:18] Christian believers seeking to attain
[1:03:21] the crown of adoption, we must cross
[1:03:23] Jordan with no shortcuts. The central
[1:03:26] theme of the sermon was death to self.
[1:03:30] Early the next morning, I awoke with a
[1:03:32] question pressing strongly upon my
[1:03:34] heart. Is the approach to Jordan
[1:03:37] intentional
[1:03:39] or is it by conditions?
[1:03:42] This brought to mind the prophet's
[1:03:43] statement, "If love does not get us,
[1:03:47] desperate
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; conditions will."
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; This question arose directly from what
[1:03:53] was preached in the sermon, particularly
[1:03:55] concerning debt to self and forsaking of
[1:03:58] certain comforts and desires of this
[1:04:00] life before crossing Jordan. Now, as the
[1:04:03] Lord Jesus said in Matthew 19:29, "And
[1:04:05] every one of you that had forsaken
[1:04:07] houses and brethren and sisters or
[1:04:08] father, mother or wife, children, or
[1:04:11] lands for my name's sake shall receive a
[1:04:13] hundfold and shall inherit everlasting
[1:04:17] life." The scripture I felt pressed to
[1:04:20] read that morning was Romans 8 in its
[1:04:22] entirety with verses 1 and 12 and 15,
[1:04:26] especially remaining with me. There is
[1:04:28] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:04:31] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:04:33] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:04:36] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not
[1:04:38] to the flesh to live after the flesh.
[1:04:39] For if you live after the flesh, you
[1:04:41] shall die. But if you through the spirit
[1:04:43] do modify the deeds of the body, you
[1:04:45] shall live. For as many as are led by
[1:04:48] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:04:50] God. For you have not received the
[1:04:52] spirit of bondage to fear, but you have
[1:04:54] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[1:04:56] we cry, Aba, Father. So my question
[1:04:58] remains, is this crossing of Jordan
[1:05:03] something that comes by divine
[1:05:04] conditions or by intentional
[1:05:08] surrender and obedience?
[1:05:10] I also reflected on brother Brandon's
[1:05:12] experience with his first encounter with
[1:05:15] Jesus own only Pentecostal people. When
[1:05:18] his mother-in-law warned him not to take
[1:05:21] her daughter among that, she considered
[1:05:24] such trash.
[1:05:25] The consequence of not obeying the voice
[1:05:27] of God and instead listening to his
[1:05:29] mother-in-law was extremely severe, the
[1:05:32] loss of his wife and daughter. I will
[1:05:35] appreciate I would greatly appreciate
[1:05:37] your thoughts and spiritual insight on
[1:05:38] this question. Yours sincerely in
[1:05:41] Christ, Brother Shane Williams. I love
[1:05:42] this question. So when I got this
[1:05:44] question, I said, "Bro Shane, I'll
[1:05:45] answer it, but I want to read this for
[1:05:47] the church." So is So I have this here.
[1:05:51] is crossing the Jordan by condition or
[1:05:55] by intentional surrender and obedience.
[1:05:58] So I want to answer this because this is
[1:06:00] important
[1:06:02] because of what I had in my heart to
[1:06:03] preach and this ties in straight perfect
[1:06:06] there. So let me give you the title of
[1:06:08] what I have here this morning.
[1:06:11] The title I have is when you are dying
[1:06:14] and Christ is coming to life.
[1:06:18] And the subject I have the age of dying
[1:06:21] out the death of a corner wheat. That's
[1:06:23] the subject I have tonight.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The age of dying out. Now I know
[1:06:29] there's not um
[1:06:31] Okay. So let's just answer this question
[1:06:34] a bit. Is crossing the Jordan by
[1:06:37] condition or by intentional surrender
[1:06:39] and obedience? Joshua 1 2 and 3 God
[1:06:42] speaks. Moses my servant is dead. Now
[1:06:46] therefore arise, go over this Jordan.
[1:06:48] Now we saying Jordan, but Jordan
[1:06:50] represent debt.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Go over this Jordan, thou and
[1:06:55] all this people into the land which I do
[1:06:58] give them, even to the children of
[1:06:59] Israel. Every place that the soul of
[1:07:01] your foot shall tread upon, that have I
[1:07:03] given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That is the big print.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Every place you put your foot is yours.
[1:07:11] Right?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; The fine print is later on. We're not
[1:07:14] going to read it. It says meditate on
[1:07:16] the word day and night
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; to have good success.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; So if you read the the top print all is
[1:07:23] yours and everything else. That sounds
[1:07:24] great. That sounds good. But you have to
[1:07:26] always look for the fine print
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; where you're going to meditate when
[1:07:30] you're going to think about these
[1:07:31] things. Isn't that right?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And the other scripture I have is from 2
[1:07:34] Kings 2 and we know the story when
[1:07:38] Elijah told Elisha stay here and stay
[1:07:40] here and so on. But this these three
[1:07:41] verses here and Elijah said unto him tar
[1:07:43] I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to
[1:07:45] Jordan. So the man said stay at Betal
[1:07:47] stay at Gal stay at Jericho and he said
[1:07:51] I'm not staying
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; now that's a brother with revelation.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; He's not saying the prophet tell me stay
[1:07:56] here I ain't moving.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Oh no. So he's still moving.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; He dead where he is.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; You have to move sometimes.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; But you have to have revelation to move.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; And he had a revelation. He want more.
[1:08:08] Where that come from
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; because Elijah took his mouth and drop
[1:08:10] it on him and pull it off.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; So something TOUCH HIM,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HIT him and I hope something
[1:08:15] hit you this morning.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; That you will want
[1:08:19] you would want more OF WHERE THAT COME
[1:08:21] FROM.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Are you with me?
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; So watch. Elijah said unto them, Tyrie,
[1:08:26] I pray thee, for the Lord had sent me to
[1:08:28] Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth,
[1:08:30] as thy so live, I will not leave thee.
[1:08:31] And they two went on. And 50 men of the
[1:08:35] sons of the prophets went and stood to
[1:08:38] view a far off and there two stood by
[1:08:41] Jordan. So there's al people to witness
[1:08:44] your dying. [laughter]
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; There will always be people to witness
[1:08:50] your transformation.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be transformed in
[1:08:53] the dark. You know you No, no, no. There
[1:08:54] will be people seeing you dying
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; that you're changing
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; that your hot not your hot mouth not so
[1:09:00] hot no more. Amen.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I got about six. Amen on that one.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't be rude no more. You
[1:09:09] wouldn't be in discipline no more.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; All right. So, watch this. And Elijah
[1:09:13] took his mantle, wrap it together, smoke
[1:09:15] the waters, and they were divided and
[1:09:16] thither, and they two went on dry
[1:09:18] ground.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Giggal, Bethl, Jericho,
[1:09:24] then Jordan.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Three steps then die.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and
[1:09:32] then the word.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; The corner wheat.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; The instruction was arise and go over
[1:09:39] this Jordan.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's not a question if we should
[1:09:42] die.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; We have to die.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; It's not taught in the message or preach
[1:09:46] much in the message. What you hear your
[1:09:48] bride
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and you the eye in the bride.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I not seeing that.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; The bride is the Holy Ghost punch.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride have the extra oil.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; The bride is not the foolish virgins
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; or the stupid virgins.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Brother, some of the prophets said to
[1:10:12] Elisha, "Do you know your master will be
[1:10:15] taken from you?" He say, "I know it, but
[1:10:16] hold your peace."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "I like that. I am going to
[1:10:20] stay right with him no matter what the
[1:10:22] rest of them say."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Elijah turned around and said, "No, you
[1:10:24] t here for God is sending me to Jordan."
[1:10:27] Then brother Brown speak this three
[1:10:29] places justification gigal
[1:10:32] sanctification the school of the
[1:10:34] prophets and to the baptism of the holy
[1:10:36] ghost at Jordan where Jordan represents
[1:10:41] death notice Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:10:45] Pentecost and down to the Jordan
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; dying out time
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; so there's a time for you to receive the
[1:10:53] word there time for you to die out you
[1:10:55] start first with receiving the word
[1:10:56] there in the word you because you see
[1:10:58] you don't know God
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; until God revealed himself to you.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; When Moses brought the people out, they
[1:11:03] had no clue who God is.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Moses met God,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; not the people.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; The people were following a prophet
[1:11:09] CALLED MOSES BECAUSE HE MET THE PILLAR
[1:11:12] OF FIRE. BUT GOD TOLD THEM, "BRING THEM
[1:11:14] TO THIS mountain
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; that I could talk to them, THAT I COULD
[1:11:17] SHOW MYSELF to them, THAT I COULD PROVE
[1:11:20] MYSELF TO THEM. BRING THEM TO THIS
[1:11:21] MOUNTAIN." OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:24] THEREFORE, WHEN THE RED SEA WAS IN FRONT
[1:11:26] OF MOSES, MOSES WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW
[1:11:28] BETTER BECAUSE WHEN GOD GIVE YOU A
[1:11:30] COMMISSION, NOTHING STOPS IT. NOTHING
[1:11:33] COULD HINDER IT. NOTHING COULD BLOCK IT.
[1:11:35] So when MOSES BEGAN TO CRY, HE SAID,
[1:11:37] "WHY CRY UNTO ME? SPEAK AND MOVE
[1:11:39] FORWARD."
[1:11:41] AND THEN THE [screaming] REST HAD TO
[1:11:42] OPEN UP BECAUSE GOD GAVE HIM A RETURN
[1:11:44] TICKET TO THAT MOUNTAIN. WHAT CAN THE
[1:11:46] LORD SHOUT IN THE HALLELUJAH?
[1:11:51] GOD DIDN'T GIVE HIM A ONEWAY TICKET TO
[1:11:52] EGYPT. HE GAVE A RETURN TICKET. GO TO
[1:11:55] EGYPT AND BRING THEM OUT.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; BRING THEM TO THIS MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:00] AND GOD BROUGHT US A MOUNTAIN.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; MOUNT PYRAMID. LOOK AT THERE.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MOUNTAIN WE COME TO NOW.
[1:12:07] [applause and cheering]
[1:12:08] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But the third stage is coming on. The
[1:12:17] church still follows on. Elijah.
[1:12:21] Elisha. Following Elijah down to the
[1:12:24] Jordan. Jordan the meaning of of
[1:12:26] separation or debt. You heard many times
[1:12:28] when I come down to the Chile Jordan.
[1:12:30] Jordan was debt. The Lutheran age
[1:12:32] followed by so did the Methodist age.
[1:12:36] But we come to another age now.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I never said this before. I'm reading
[1:12:42] the age of dying out.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; You see Wesley was dynamics of Lutheran.
[1:12:52] Pentecost was dynamic to the wesians.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Every time God come on the scene, it
[1:12:57] changes what was passed.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So when the word come, the Pentecostal
[1:13:01] birth was nothing.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; God pushed that back in the womb because
[1:13:04] now the word is required.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You see, you can't go back and build an
[1:13:06] ark from like Noah's day saying rain
[1:13:08] coming.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Young people say out of timing. Then
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; for Noah's time,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; you understand I'm saying? You have to
[1:13:15] find out what is promised for this day.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And fight up with God's requirement for
[1:13:19] this day.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And this day, God requirement is
[1:13:21] perfection.
[1:13:24] [applause]
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen. Right with me
[1:13:26] now. Right with me now.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT CHURCH. PENTECOST TO Jehovah
[1:13:30] Witness and Baptist. THAT'S CHURCH.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; WE TALKING ABOUT PERFECTION.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; We not EVEN TALKING ABOUT SALVATION. WE
[1:13:40] TALKING ABOUT REDEMPTION. REDEMPTION IS
[1:13:42] TO BRING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU were
[1:13:44] before. IT GOES BEYOND BEING SAVED. IT
[1:13:47] IS GOING BACK TO WHAT ADAM HAD. LET US
[1:13:50] MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, OUR LIKENESS. LET
[1:13:53] THAT MAN have dominion over the fish,
[1:13:54] OVER EVERY CREEPING THING. YOU HAVE TO
[1:13:56] HAVE DOMINION, NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:13:59] DOMINION IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. OH,
[1:14:01] DON'T GET ME STARTED THIS MORNING.
[1:14:03] DOMINION IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. LOVE
[1:14:05] AND JOY IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. YOU
[1:14:07] HAVE TO HAVE IT HERE. YOU HAVE TO
[1:14:08] EXERCISE IT HERE. YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY
[1:14:10] HERE. GOODNESS, GRACIOUSNESS.
[1:14:13] [cheering and applause]
[1:14:18] You're mean as the devil. You're stingy
[1:14:20] as Satan himself. You don't want to give
[1:14:22] nobody nothing. When you give, when you
[1:14:24] go in your side, when I go side, I will
[1:14:25] give. Who you giving to?
[1:14:29] Who you deceive him?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I go love when I love your side. You
[1:14:32] hating down here now for now.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; The blood can't take this one. I cast on
[1:14:37] this one.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You are to want to love your enemies.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you can't be gossiping about
[1:14:45] enemies. Oh, God. She's the enemy of
[1:14:46] God. You don't do it.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I thought you want to love your enemies.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; God set up the enemy's face of love.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; But you only complain about the enemy.
[1:14:54] Oh, God. The enemy of God. You call this
[1:14:56] one that stop it. Cut it out. That's the
[1:14:58] enemy. How you going to love that?
[1:15:00] [applause]
[1:15:01] Let me STICK YOU NOW. OR YOU COULD LOVE
[1:15:03] GOD WHO YOU CAN'T SEE AND YOU HAVE A
[1:15:05] PROBLEM TO LOVE YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR
[1:15:07] SISTER who right in front of your face
[1:15:09] who next door to you who behind you. You
[1:15:10] want to shake your hand. Oh, don't get
[1:15:12] ME STARTED THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW YOU
[1:15:13] HAVE TO DO better than that. YOU HAVE TO
[1:15:15] GET MORE MATURE THAN THAT. YOU HAVE TO
[1:15:17] GROW HARDER THAN THAT.
[1:15:28] [cheering and applause]
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:32] My blood.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; The age of dying out.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; All your worldly pleasures. God has got
[1:15:46] to do something with you
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; in order for he could give you the Holy
[1:15:50] Ghost. You got to die out and get dead.
[1:15:53] You don't die. You see, that is why the
[1:15:54] message will like Mary, be it done unto
[1:15:57] me according to your word. They love
[1:15:58] that
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; because they have no work to do there.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; They have no work.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; That's nice. Baptist doctor according to
[1:16:07] your word. Yeah. Why Mary in the upper
[1:16:10] room?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Because B say she had to die out, you
[1:16:13] know.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; She had to get all the prize. She's the
[1:16:15] mother of Jesus and you know she had to
[1:16:17] sit down next door to Mary Magdalene who
[1:16:19] had who and living with who and who had
[1:16:21] who and who [laughter] had who say Mary
[1:16:23] and B hallelujah glory and so on you
[1:16:25] know.
[1:16:27] OH GOD, DON'T LOOK AT ME STARTING here
[1:16:29] this morning, you know. Amen.
[1:16:32] HALLELUJAH. SO YOU CAN'T BE HALTY TOY
[1:16:35] WHILE YOU'RE PROUD AND you feel you're
[1:16:36] better than somebody. Yes. Spit them but
[1:16:38] YOU DON'T CARE. HALLELUJAH. WHO YOU
[1:16:40] THINK YOU ARE? YOU NEVER FORNICATE. You
[1:16:42] never adulterate. You never work but you
[1:16:44] never sin. You never that
[1:16:47] make you special.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; All have sinned. In case you're
[1:16:51] misreading the Bible, not some. All have
[1:16:54] sinned.
[1:16:56] AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY. BEHAVE
[1:16:59] YOURSELF.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Even if you say amen, a sin, you behave
[1:17:13] yourself.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Behave yourself righteous self.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; BEHAVE YOUR HOLIER THAN THOU SELF.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; BEHAVE YOUR PHARISEE SELF.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; GO SAY AMEN. I'm still coming.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; I ain't done yet. I'm still coming. I
[1:17:29] still coming. I still coming. I STILL ON
[1:17:30] MY WAY. I'M COMING. I COMING. I COMING.
[1:17:32] I'M COMING. GOD WANT YOU STRIPPED.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; God want YOU ON THE CROSS. GOD WANT YOU
[1:17:40] HUMBLED.
[1:17:41] [cheering]
[1:17:42] [applause]
[1:17:46] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:17:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Out of death comes life.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Out of the death of Christ come the
[1:18:01] resurrection of life.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can tonight become
[1:18:04] alive of faith in God is die out to
[1:18:06] yourself and symptoms and everything
[1:18:09] around you and become alive. Die out.
[1:18:12] Die out to your symptoms. Die out to
[1:18:15] your circumstances. Die out with
[1:18:17] everything else and become alive in
[1:18:19] Christ.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Sometime I was preaching about Isaac. on
[1:18:22] Isaac planting in the time of famine.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; That just boggles my mind.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Rain falling. You know
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; and that man dig up the ground and
[1:18:30] putting seeds out there.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody looking at him say you a mad
[1:18:33] man.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; We in dry season.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Famine
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; and he's still planting.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; But you know what Isaac had?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't make you look at the
[1:18:45] weather.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't make you look at God
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; because God controlled that. Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; You see, we have a responsibility, as I
[1:18:53] said on Friday, to till the ground.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility to put the
[1:18:58] seed.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And only God could send rain.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Man don't control rain.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; God does.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Your figures shall
[1:19:08] bring forth his fruit, and I will
[1:19:10] restore, and I will send you rain in the
[1:19:12] first month, EVEN THE FORMER RAIN AND
[1:19:14] THE LATTER RAIN. And it shall COME TO
[1:19:16] PASS AFTERWARDS, I WILL POUR out my
[1:19:18] spirit UPON ALL FLESH [screaming]
[1:19:19] AND YOUR SON. LET THEM LAUGH. THE RAIN
[1:19:22] IS THE SEED IS IN THE BAND. LET THEM
[1:19:24] LAUGH. THE SEED IS INSIDE OF YOU, BUT
[1:19:26] the rain is fixing to fall. WHEN THAT
[1:19:29] RAIN FALL, LIFE WILL COME FORTH.
[1:19:31] HALLELUJAH. JESUS ALREADY PROPHESIED,
[1:19:33] "OUT OF YOUR BELLY SHALL RIVERS OF
[1:19:36] LIVING WATER, THE SPY OF THE SPIRIT."
[1:19:40] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUTING OUT. WE NOT
[1:19:42] CRAZY HERE. AMEN.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE TRUTH.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE WORD.
[1:19:48] [applause and cheering]
[1:19:53] [applause]
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; What a shame. Thank you for that
[1:19:56] question.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Is it some people waiting for pressure?
[1:20:00] You know there some people like that. I
[1:20:04] not accusing anybody here.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; There are some people like to um study
[1:20:08] the day before the exams. Do you know
[1:20:10] who I talking about?
[1:20:13] I I know who I talking about. I know I
[1:20:14] know specific people all the time during
[1:20:17] the months they are studying see close
[1:20:18] to exam time final week
[1:20:22] and and they're so gifted. You know the
[1:20:24] things the study has come
[1:20:27] it's amazing that the gifted the blessed
[1:20:29] lucky and so right I'm not talking about
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:33] but
[1:20:35] you don't have to wait for circumstances
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; to act. So I will take the approach of
[1:20:43] intentional.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; The word intentional means done on
[1:20:50] purpose.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Deliberate.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Like some people I wouldn't say they
[1:20:54] intentionally do wicked
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; but they do things and they doing like
[1:20:58] if they intend to do it you didn't
[1:21:01] intend to do it.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Plotting and planning and thing. I mean
[1:21:07] I not in that area. I can't live on
[1:21:09] plan. I just had to live.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; But intentional means done on purpose.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Being intentional means making
[1:21:18] deliberate choices.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; To reflect what is most important to us.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Becoming intentional can help us
[1:21:27] maintain a positive mindset, reach
[1:21:30] goals, experience more clarity. It can
[1:21:34] also increase our focus and commitment
[1:21:37] and bring more purpose and meaning to
[1:21:39] our lives.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; That's the problem today. People are not
[1:21:43] focused. They're mind everywhere.
[1:21:46] They're not intentional.
[1:21:48] Something intentional was done on
[1:21:50] purpose.
[1:21:52] If a crime was intentional, it was no
[1:21:55] accident.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother, if you follow Christ,
[1:22:01] you'll be hated by people.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. For all that live godly in Christ
[1:22:05] Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; If you come to Christ, you will not come
[1:22:10] by any church or denomination or creed.
[1:22:12] You'll come by the blood. That's the
[1:22:14] only avenue.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You cannot bring no one with you. You
[1:22:18] will come alone and stand on your own
[1:22:20] confession
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and your own faith.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; You have to confess with your mouth.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ. You have to
[1:22:27] confess with your mouth your deliverance
[1:22:29] and your breakthrough and your healing
[1:22:30] and your blessing and restoration. You
[1:22:32] come as an individual when you come to
[1:22:34] God. And many times we make those
[1:22:36] foolish choices. Let me continue. What
[1:22:40] if Lot when he seen everything easy, he
[1:22:43] saw where there was money and much
[1:22:45] popularity. We know the story. God
[1:22:47] called Abraham. Abraham, Abraham bring
[1:22:49] along family and the blessing fall on
[1:22:51] Abraham family too. Family prospering or
[1:22:53] whatn not then fight among the herdsmen.
[1:22:55] Abraham the bigger brother come and tell
[1:22:57] let's not fight. Let's let's say family
[1:23:01] we don't need that.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Let us let us take take apart. You go to
[1:23:06] the east, I go to the west. You you
[1:23:07] choose.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; God called Abraham and Abraham tell you
[1:23:10] choose.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Abraham look the eyes. You look and see
[1:23:13] all the what? So what? Sodom. You look
[1:23:14] and see all the wells. You see desert.
[1:23:16] So you see what your eyes see now.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He see in desert. So he see water and
[1:23:21] well towards Sodom. So he start going
[1:23:22] down this way. Abraham say fine. But
[1:23:25] Brown,
[1:23:27] he he because he was a smart man. Watch.
[1:23:30] I've got faith in God. I just go down
[1:23:32] into Sodom. I'll make some extra money.
[1:23:34] I become a great man. Make a wonderful
[1:23:36] preacher. But you have a choice to make.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; The ley have a choice to make.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; But Abraham, Lot didn't see his family
[1:23:42] breaking up.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Lot couldn't see his wife turning the
[1:23:45] pillar of salt. Lot couldn't see the
[1:23:47] secondary consequences of a decision to
[1:23:49] go to what sort of
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; so many times our decisions and our
[1:23:53] choices have consequences that are
[1:23:55] farreaching.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's why I say ask God to lead you in
[1:24:00] your choices and decisions. Sometime the
[1:24:02] choices make it look hard
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; but you make the right choice.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; It's the harder way.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; It's a narrow way. Sometime people mock
[1:24:10] that way and they quarrel and they try
[1:24:11] to put seeds but you stand with your
[1:24:13] choice
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; when God lead you the way God leading
[1:24:16] you. [cheering]
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Tell my son brother Isaac say listen I
[1:24:22] recognize do you're damned. Don't you
[1:24:24] damned. I either do or don't. I do as I
[1:24:27] feel led.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Because you can't please everybody.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody looking to be pleased. I
[1:24:31] cannot please everybody. So I please no
[1:24:33] one. I pleasing God.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; As long as God is happy, I am happy. Who
[1:24:38] vex loss? As you say, who vex loss?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Anytime you're catering for others, your
[1:24:44] life will be manipulated.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; When you cater for others opinion and
[1:24:48] ideas, your life could be controlled.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; But when you hold steady with what God
[1:24:51] has revealed to you, you can stand as a
[1:24:53] rock. I shall not be moved.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; HOW DAVID SAID IT. DON'T 10,000 FALL MY
[1:24:59] RIGHT SIDE. I shall not be moved.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Look what David say. And you come in
[1:25:06] here and get a fight with this one, a
[1:25:07] fight with that one. A fight. Gulak live
[1:25:11] inside of here.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; You see a giant inside of here.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Please don't leave without telling me
[1:25:17] and show me that giant. You know, don't
[1:25:19] come here and get fight. You know, get
[1:25:21] all your fights home and you come come
[1:25:22] and rejoice.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; You fight with the deacon, you fight
[1:25:25] with the usher, you fight with the
[1:25:26] preacher, you fight with the elder, you
[1:25:27] fight with everybody that people like
[1:25:28] that, you know, they come come to fight.
[1:25:30] They not come for harmony. They come not
[1:25:31] come for fellowship. They come for
[1:25:32] faults.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And if you want to live a false, come to
[1:25:37] me.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I could show you. I will help you. I
[1:25:39] will show you all the faults.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I know them, you know. Yeah, I will help
[1:25:42] you. Come and see mine and all too.
[1:25:44] Yeah, I will help you. I will escort
[1:25:45] you. Then he escort you straight out.
[1:25:50] That's why I can't understand people
[1:25:51] criticizing this preacher, criticize
[1:25:52] him, criticize him, criticize him. Now
[1:25:54] what they doing? They're criticizing the
[1:25:56] preachers all around.
[1:25:58] So the people will tell that man, he
[1:26:02] everybody else falls. be right.
[1:26:04] Everybody else wrong. He's right
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; because the people that's what cut in
[1:26:08] the mind this one off that one off that
[1:26:09] one off that one off that one. If Christ
[1:26:12] was doing like that when he say Peter so
[1:26:14] he could deny me.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was in the same vein of how we
[1:26:22] think he touch Peter you know I see
[1:26:25] behold he will deny me. I am one man. I
[1:26:27] want
[1:26:29] brother Timothy inside.
[1:26:35] I ain't going to use PAUL BECAUSE YOU
[1:26:36] FIGHT THE CHURCH.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; God said my thoughts are not YOUR
[1:26:42] THOUGHTS.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; MY WAYS are not your ways.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; People who you think not going to make
[1:26:47] it, they're going to make it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; People you think wouldn't come, they're
[1:26:50] going to come. People you think God
[1:26:52] won't deliver, God will deliver. I LOOK
[1:26:54] HOW HARD IT IS. DON'T LOOK AT THAT.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for amen to that.
[1:27:01] You're not see me. Amen to the word.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; The lady has a choice to make. I going
[1:27:06] to sit in church and everybody in
[1:27:08] tongues thinks is the best church and
[1:27:10] mayor of the city belongs to this
[1:27:11] church. But you still have to judge that
[1:27:13] church and its people by the scriptures.
[1:27:16] Notice this. Abraham the only thing he
[1:27:19] could do was to take a second choice.
[1:27:23] Ah, sometimes the second choice is
[1:27:26] better than the first.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I get two amens on that.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Abraham could have check first choice or
[1:27:33] you know Justin. I could see one man
[1:27:36] just right now to get the front of the
[1:27:37] picture cuz he figure easy. I wouldn't I
[1:27:40] wouldn't go there. I wouldn't call his
[1:27:41] name among among world leaders and so
[1:27:46] Abraham can say listen God called me you
[1:27:48] know I am the man that God has called
[1:27:51] Lot. Go behave yourself.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Go in that corner there.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And Abraham straightened Lot and put Lot
[1:27:57] in his place.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; But what did Abraham do? Lot you choose.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Give Lot first choice.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Give Abraham second choice.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And Abraham take second choice. And
[1:28:10] second choice are better than first
[1:28:11] choice.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; So sometimes stop complaining. I was the
[1:28:14] first choice. I was the first choice.
[1:28:15] Cut that crap out. I just read for you.
[1:28:18] Second choice is better than first
[1:28:19] choice because second choice put you in
[1:28:21] God's plan in God's program. Lot got
[1:28:24] MESSED UP. HIS FAMILY GOT MESSED UP. HIS
[1:28:26] WIFE TURNED TO PILLAR SWORD. STOP
[1:28:28] COMPLAINING. God saving you from
[1:28:30] yourself. Oh give THE LORD A SHOUT IN
[1:28:32] THE HOUSE.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:28:39] It only notice it wasn't long. Lot seen
[1:28:41] a big city. He didn't see his wife turn
[1:28:43] the pillar of salt. Though he didn't see
[1:28:44] the fire burning of the city. But
[1:28:45] Abraham took the way of the lost his
[1:28:46] wife few. He stayed in the desert. So
[1:28:50] being intentional
[1:28:51] is living purposefully,
[1:28:54] deliberately, and in alignment with
[1:28:56] God's word and will.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, you're not
[1:29:00] doing today. God, what are you doing?
[1:29:02] You know, poke a poke. You're nothing.
[1:29:04] You are nothing. You can't wake up in
[1:29:06] the morning and start to figure out what
[1:29:07] you're going to do. Your planning should
[1:29:09] be the night before.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; I want to hear more amens than that.
[1:29:14] Your planning for your tomorrow day is
[1:29:16] supposed to be the day before.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You can't wake up on some Sunday morning
[1:29:19] to plan to go to church.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Six.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; When you're living intentional, you have
[1:29:30] to write down things
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; because your peanut brains are going to
[1:29:35] remember everything.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I don't put nothing up there.
[1:29:42] Don't think it's a joking because I had
[1:29:44] something to get Isaac this morning. I
[1:29:45] put that inside my phone.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He give me an alarm because in my bag
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; and if I come with it in my bag and I
[1:29:52] don't give it to him, I'll forget.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; But when it pop up so I put it at alarm
[1:29:56] for 10:00
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; pop up.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Soon as he come in the office that this
[1:30:02] for you.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That done you know.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; My brain had too much thing to deal
[1:30:06] with.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; That's true. So I have this Google for
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; I just upload everything on that
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; so my brain's clear to get fresh
[1:30:16] inspiration.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want my brain having a hole. I
[1:30:20] had to go to the bank. I had to go here.
[1:30:22] I had to visit once here. No, my brain I
[1:30:24] I don't my brain have all them things.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Some of you know what that is for. But I
[1:30:32] help you this morning.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Offload.
[1:30:37] I remember the church was about six
[1:30:38] seven people and boy was pressure
[1:30:40] thunder good
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I said Lord Jesus
[1:30:46] I wouldn't say was terrorism but it was
[1:30:47] quite a character up there
[1:30:50] and one day I said Lord Jesus I put them
[1:30:52] into your hands
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; I offload them
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; and after that never pick them up again
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; pray for them
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; so being intentional
[1:31:05] is living purposefully,
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; deliberately,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; in alignment with God's word and his
[1:31:11] will. The opposite is living by
[1:31:14] reacting,
[1:31:16] acting by impulse, acting by feelings,
[1:31:20] emotions, drifting on the sea of life or
[1:31:22] just reacting.
[1:31:26] The Bible said lazy man, he said there's
[1:31:28] a land in the street.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; That's why he not going out.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; He pull the sheet over and take a next
[1:31:33] leap.
[1:31:35] Okay.
[1:31:37] So this is to live on purpose
[1:31:40] not by chance but by forethought. This
[1:31:43] [snorts] is you choosing to obey. This
[1:31:46] is you choosing obedience on purpose
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; not by chance.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Choice is a great thing. In many things
[1:31:54] of life we have a give a choice. The way
[1:31:56] of life itself is a choice. We have a
[1:31:58] right to make our own way. Choose our
[1:32:00] own way that we want to live. Education
[1:32:02] is a choice. We can choose whether we
[1:32:04] going to be educated or whether we are
[1:32:06] not going to be educated. That's a
[1:32:07] choice. Right and wrong is a choice.
[1:32:10] Every man, every woman, boy or girl has
[1:32:13] to choose whether they are going to try
[1:32:15] to live right or not live right. It's a
[1:32:18] choice. Choice is a great thing. And
[1:32:21] your eternal destination is a choice.
[1:32:23] And maybe tonight some of you might make
[1:32:25] that choice where you will spend
[1:32:26] eternity before this service might end
[1:32:28] tonight. There'll be one time if you
[1:32:30] turn God down many times. There'll be
[1:32:32] one time you will turn him down the last
[1:32:33] time. This is the line between mercy and
[1:32:36] judgment. It's a dangerous thing for a
[1:32:38] man or woman, boy or girl to step across
[1:32:40] that line. There's no return. There's
[1:32:42] another choice we have in life. The
[1:32:44] life, a life companion. A young man, a
[1:32:46] young woman stepping out on life has
[1:32:48] been given a right to make a choice. The
[1:32:51] young man chooses. The young woman has a
[1:32:53] right to accept or reject. It's still a
[1:32:55] choice on both sides. Both man and
[1:32:57] woman, they have a right to choose. And
[1:32:59] you have a choice as a Christian. You
[1:33:01] have a choice of the church. Choose any
[1:33:04] church you want to belong to. That's
[1:33:05] your choice. There's nobody can tell you
[1:33:08] or make you come to a certain church.
[1:33:10] That is our freedom. Every man can
[1:33:13] choose for himself. Freedom of religion
[1:33:15] is a great thing. Then he said, "God,
[1:33:17] help us to keep it as long as we can."
[1:33:19] So when you choose this church, you can
[1:33:21] choose whether you are in this church,
[1:33:22] whether you will choose a church that
[1:33:23] will guide you to eternal destination.
[1:33:25] You can choose a church that has a
[1:33:27] certain creed that you might think that
[1:33:29] creed is just what you want or the other
[1:33:31] church has their creed and then there's
[1:33:33] the word of God. You have a choice. You
[1:33:36] have to make that choice. There's some
[1:33:37] people love the church. There's some
[1:33:38] people love the word.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; The church people love the church. They
[1:33:41] love the pastor. They love everything
[1:33:42] and whatnot. They in church. They are
[1:33:45] the same as Catholics
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; in the message. THEY ARE SAME AS BAPTIST
[1:33:49] in the message. The Catholic churches
[1:33:51] they go they go and play the cannival.
[1:33:52] They come and get the ashes and they get
[1:33:54] normal normal. They going to church,
[1:33:55] they're not missing mass
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; and you're missing mass.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; The people come, they smoke up the place
[1:34:06] and whatnot. They do all little similit
[1:34:09] and they smoke on the place and they
[1:34:11] sing like little him and man do little
[1:34:12] things cross thing like that. People
[1:34:14] feel religious.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; AND THERE THOUSANDS GO TO every single
[1:34:19] Sunday.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; I know I was part of it.
[1:34:26] I was acolyte you know.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; All right. So you watching a here
[1:34:32] exacolyte
[1:34:36] I come out and become I come out to walk
[1:34:38] in the light.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Keep the light.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. Here we are.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; So watch. I believe it was Elijah one
[1:34:48] time at Mont Caramel with the showdown.
[1:34:51] But there will come a time when you will
[1:34:52] have to make a choice.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And you men here, he said the hour going
[1:34:58] to come or you going to make a choice.
[1:35:00] You're going to either go into go this
[1:35:01] world council or you're going to go into
[1:35:03] the denominational or you're you're not
[1:35:04] going to be a denomination anymore.
[1:35:06] You're going to have to do that. That
[1:35:07] choice is coming soon.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; It's a dangerous time to wait till the
[1:35:12] last hour because you might take on
[1:35:14] something that you could never shake out
[1:35:16] of it.
[1:35:19] And you talk about the Jubilee. When the
[1:35:20] Jubilee comes and the priest roing to go
[1:35:22] free and people don't want to hear and
[1:35:24] go free, they had their ears bored and
[1:35:26] they could hear it and they can't go
[1:35:27] free anymore. Elijah said, "Choose you
[1:35:30] this day whom you shall serve. If God be
[1:35:32] God, serve him. If Bal be God, serve
[1:35:35] him." So I think I want to conclude
[1:35:36] here. So listen, Jordan crossing Jordan
[1:35:39] dead has to be intentional.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; When they was trying to press Jesus one
[1:35:43] time, she said, "My hours yet come." In
[1:35:44] other words, you can't touch me. They
[1:35:45] can't hold me.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; When his hour come, he said, "My hour is
[1:35:48] now come."
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus whole temple changed
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; because how he know he's setting out
[1:35:54] towards Calvary.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; So the first part of his ministry, cast
[1:35:57] no devils, healing the sick, multiplying
[1:35:59] the bread and fish and so on, healing
[1:36:00] the people and so on, blessing them and
[1:36:02] so on. He knew he was on a mission.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; He knew this path was temporary. He knew
[1:36:06] he's coming to a purpose. He told his
[1:36:08] disciples privately, if I don't go, the
[1:36:09] comforter will not come. I will not give
[1:36:11] you comfortless. I have to go.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; But I send him back something. I have to
[1:36:14] go for it to come.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Don't try to hold me back. [laughter] I
[1:36:17] have to go for it to come. If I don't
[1:36:18] go, it will not come. If I don't go, it
[1:36:20] will not come. You have to wait for it
[1:36:22] to come.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So, when he rose FROM THE DEAD, HE
[1:36:27] [laughter] START TO TALK TO THEM AND
[1:36:29] TELL THEM, "BEHOLD, I send the promise
[1:36:31] of my father upon you. Carry in the seat
[1:36:33] of Jerusalem until you get power from on
[1:36:36] high." They need power to deal with them
[1:36:37] devils. They need power to deal with
[1:36:39] their children. You need power to be
[1:36:40] WITH THAT HUSBAND, WITH THAT WIFE, OH
[1:36:42] WITH THAT FAMILY, WITH THAT BOSS. YOU
[1:36:44] NEED POWER TO DEAL WITH THEM SEX SPIRITS
[1:36:46] AND ALL THEM DEMONS AROUND THERE. YOU
[1:36:48] NEED POWER IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU COME TO CHURCH, BE EMPOWERED.
[1:36:55] [cheering and applause]
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:37:06] All right.
[1:37:11] John 12 20-2 24 scripture and there were
[1:37:14] certain Greeks among them that came to
[1:37:16] worship at the feast
[1:37:18] the same came therefore to Philillip
[1:37:19] which is a basa of Galilee and desired
[1:37:22] him saying sir we worship Jesus
[1:37:25] Philip come as telling Andrew again
[1:37:27] Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus
[1:37:30] answered them saying the hour is come
[1:37:34] that the son of man shall be glorified
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; verily I verily I say unto You except a
[1:37:39] corner we fall into the ground and die.
[1:37:41] It abideth alone. But if it die, it
[1:37:44] bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So these people come to see Jesus. I
[1:37:48] want to see him. Why? They heard about
[1:37:51] him. So the hearing part wasn't the
[1:37:54] issue. Faith come by hearing, hearing
[1:37:56] the word. The issue wasn't what they
[1:37:58] heard. They didn't come to hear about
[1:38:01] him or hear him. They wanted to see him
[1:38:04] or meet him. They came to the disciple
[1:38:07] and unlike these modern disciples now
[1:38:09] taking um let me tell you about it but
[1:38:12] we
[1:38:15] not what they did. He said these
[1:38:17] disciples representing the true five
[1:38:20] ministry bring the seeker to Christ.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; All right let's go. He said except a
[1:38:27] corner we fall into the ground and die
[1:38:29] alone. If you want to bring forth fruit,
[1:38:32] here we go. Die to yourself and your own
[1:38:35] man-made theology and be born again of
[1:38:38] the spirit and the resurrection. That's
[1:38:40] right. Get rid of that old spirit of
[1:38:43] selfishness and dryness that is in you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Take on new life.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; There are too many people just coming to
[1:38:51] church hearing and going back home.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; They're not even examining what they are
[1:38:56] hearing
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; as a applied to themselves. Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; When you hear this here old spirit of
[1:39:03] selfishness,
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; you have to examine yourself.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; You have an antisocial spirit.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Got to examine yourself.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You can't mix.
[1:39:16] You can't. So, what happened to heaven?
[1:39:18] Heaven, you get plenty trouble. You
[1:39:19] know, you you not corner by seven
[1:39:21] heaven. You ain't mixing. Stay down here
[1:39:24] with that. That can't make heaven.
[1:39:28] You follow what I'm saying?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; So we have to come out of us.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You have to come out of your Trinidad
[1:39:33] thing.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Some people love the train thing in the
[1:39:36] I want to get on that this morning.
[1:39:37] There's a whole sermon by itself. That
[1:39:39] that terrible trainer. A terrible spirit
[1:39:41] trainer. Say God is not a Trinidadian.
[1:39:43] Don't don't fool yourself right now.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; One man say train that bride had to be
[1:39:50] perfected by train flesh. Oh yeah.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That come from the bottomless pit of
[1:39:56] hell. That the kind of demon doctrines
[1:39:59] of devils that was pedling in this
[1:40:00] message. Train that bride has been fed
[1:40:02] by train flesh. Flesh flesh.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You're crazy.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; All right. Unless a grain of corn falls
[1:40:14] into the ground and rots, unless a man
[1:40:16] rots to his own t uh theology. Listen to
[1:40:20] this now. So they heard that God was
[1:40:22] using used this miracle working Hebrew
[1:40:25] God in the land. This is Greeks. So it
[1:40:27] attracted the attention to come to see
[1:40:29] Jesus. And notice usually the way that
[1:40:32] people want to find Jesus is to find
[1:40:34] somebody who knows how to take them to
[1:40:36] him. And if he ever chooses a servant,
[1:40:39] he always chooses somebody that will
[1:40:41] bring the people to him.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; We find that here we go.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; They brought they were brought into his
[1:40:48] presence.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; How much years of human preaching that
[1:40:51] this is what the people need to get
[1:40:52] into.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Not into theology. Not into mystery and
[1:40:56] all kind of revelations but to come into
[1:40:58] presence.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; The fight is to get you into presence.
[1:41:02] In the Old Testament was dead to go in.
[1:41:04] Now it's dead to be outside his
[1:41:05] presence.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; The churches are struck by the kangly
[1:41:07] with spiritual debt. That why they said
[1:41:09] dead in church this morning. And the
[1:41:12] excuses the preaching mysteries and the
[1:41:13] preaching histories and revelation.
[1:41:16] 4 hours burning out the people
[1:41:19] praying weary after that jars of
[1:41:22] biscuit.
[1:41:24] No worship, no atmosphere, no moisture.
[1:41:27] And the prophet taught us it will take
[1:41:29] the water.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Your water, the water is the praises.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; When you worship, you create an
[1:41:35] atmosphere on the seed that you're
[1:41:38] receiving.
[1:41:40] [applause]
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; If you keep quiet, you fall in the
[1:41:44] amorphous, you know, you just fall
[1:41:45] asleep just cold, cool, cool. And an
[1:41:47] angel, some angel will come and find
[1:41:49] some air condition breeze right over you
[1:41:50] there. and your top lip get sealed up
[1:41:52] there and in your head just n day
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I know where they go subconscious and
[1:41:56] you're dead as a don inside the church
[1:41:58] go and put a toothpick and open your eye
[1:42:00] go and wash your face and come back up
[1:42:02] or something but start to give God
[1:42:03] praise and create atmosphere you
[1:42:05] wouldn't do that in football you
[1:42:06] wouldn't do that for cricket you
[1:42:08] wouldn't do that in your house and
[1:42:09] you're watching cricket you would be
[1:42:10] dead oh god goal or cricket or ball I
[1:42:13] don't know football or whatnot or
[1:42:14] cricket or score or you know wicket
[1:42:16] wicket wicket
[1:42:24] World Cup is just your head.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; People looking to have World Cup.
[1:42:30] You long say that.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Thousands of people they paint their
[1:42:35] face, they paint the color, the the the
[1:42:37] color of the flag and whatnot. They in
[1:42:39] the spirit, they're in the atmosphere of
[1:42:40] it.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; When you come to service, you have to
[1:42:43] come to see your goal. You got to come
[1:42:45] TO SEE JESUS SCORE. YOU HAVE TO COME TO
[1:42:48] SEE MIRACLES AND SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU
[1:42:49] HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE EXPECTATION. You
[1:42:51] have to come out the excitement. The
[1:42:52] hand all them st
[1:42:55] and make a look at OUR OLD NOISE. THEY
[1:42:57] DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WORSHIPING. BUT WE
[1:42:59] KNOW WHAT WE WORSHIP. WE KNOW WHO WE
[1:43:01] WORSHIP. WE KNOW WHY WE WORSHIP. OH,
[1:43:05] GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. LET JESUS
[1:43:07] CALL A GOAL THIS MORNING.
[1:43:09] [cheering and applause]
[1:43:13] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU COME HERE
[1:43:16] BUT YOU DO DON'T HAVE TO PAY NO PLANE
[1:43:17] TICKET.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; You had to go and get no visa to go to
[1:43:20] America cuz you know problems with the
[1:43:23] visa thing already
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; right here.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; You can get IN THE ATMOSPHERE
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PREACHER HAVE TO DO
[1:43:31] with you
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; the woman WITH THE BLOOD ISSUE WASN'T
[1:43:36] BOTHERED BY ALL THOSE BIG HULKING MEN
[1:43:38] STANDING THERE WITH NO FAITH WHATSOEVER.
[1:43:40] SHE WASN'T BOTHERED BY HER SISTERS WHO
[1:43:42] COME INTO GOSSIP AND MOCK AND WHATNOT.
[1:43:44] SHE WASN'T BOTHERED BY THE CROWD AROUND
[1:43:45] JESUS. SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE BLOOD
[1:43:47] ISSUE NEED TO BE STOPPED. SHE WAS
[1:43:49] CONCERNED THAT SHE NEEDED A HEALING. SHE
[1:43:51] WAS CONCERNED SHE NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH
[1:43:54] AND NOTHING WAS GOING TO STOP HER THIS
[1:43:56] MORNING. OH, give the Lord some praises.
[1:43:59] WHEN YOU GET THAT FOCUS, WHEN YOU GOT
[1:44:01] THE DETERMINATION, WHEN YOU GOT THAT
[1:44:03] INTENTION, SHE WAS INTENTIONAL. OH,
[1:44:05] GLORY. LOOK GOOD. SHE SAID, "IF I COULD
[1:44:07] TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT, I'LL BE
[1:44:09] [screaming] MADE WHOLE." GIVE THE LORD
[1:44:11] SOME PRAISES. THAT WOMAN WAS
[1:44:12] INTENTIONAL.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; She wasn't going by her feelings.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; She told herself something.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And when she come the crowd around
[1:44:28] Jesus. Now, if she was in the feelings,
[1:44:30] she say, "Well, I'll come back
[1:44:30] tomorrow." You know, my less
[1:44:32] unbeliefless people tomorrow wasn't
[1:44:34] coming. She said, "Today is the day."
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; When she left the house, she said,
[1:44:37] "Today is the day.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to leave your house like
[1:44:40] that.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to come to church like that.
[1:44:42] STOP COMING TO CHURCH. STAY HOME. IF YOU
[1:44:44] DON'T HAVE EXPECTATION, STAY HOME. WE
[1:44:46] DON'T BEGGING YOU TO BE IN YOUR CHURCH.
[1:44:47] NOW, YOU COME HERE BY YOUR CHOICE. YOU
[1:44:49] COME HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMETHING
[1:44:50] FROM GOD. YOU COME HERE TO TEACH THE
[1:44:52] PASTOR. YOU COME HERE TO EXPLAIN NOTHING
[1:44:54] TO THE PASTOR. YOU COME HERE TO SHOW THE
[1:44:56] PASTOR NOTHING. [applause] YOU COME HERE
[1:44:58] BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP. YOU COME HERE
[1:45:00] BECAUSE YOU NEED A BREAKTHROUGH. YOU
[1:45:02] COME HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED DELIVERANCE.
[1:45:04] [cheering and applause]
[1:45:08] OH, give the Lord SOME PRAISES.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; I WAS expecting a better sermon than
[1:45:17] that this morning. You know, go with
[1:45:19] expectation.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to fulfill your
[1:45:22] expectation.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; So they brought them into Jesus
[1:45:30] presence.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Not the vials, wolves, trumpets, and
[1:45:35] when a man finish. That's why Paul said,
[1:45:37] "I come to you not with enticing words
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; because I don't want your faith rest on
[1:45:42] me.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I want your faith rest on the power of
[1:45:44] God.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; So I come to bring that impress my my my
[1:45:47] my explanation and revelation when you
[1:45:49] feel so but I see I have been in
[1:45:52] meetings where people just shake their
[1:45:53] no when they say shake their head not
[1:45:55] because they believe or not not because
[1:45:56] they revelation you know it's because
[1:45:58] unbelief taking them. They don't even
[1:45:59] know what the man saying.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; I see men I don't think they're
[1:46:02] conscious of it. is scratching their
[1:46:03] heads though.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz do you understand what going on?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Don't feel confused.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; And God is a God of clarity.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; If you ain't get nothing else, get this.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; God wants to get it to you clear. When
[1:46:19] you have clarity as a business person,
[1:46:21] as an individual, as a teacher, lawyer
[1:46:23] with clarity, it's clear before you.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You could effectively execute.
[1:46:30] What a point. If a mechanic doing
[1:46:32] SOMETHING AND HE CAN'T GET THROUGH, he
[1:46:33] don't know what going on here and he get
[1:46:35] something and he unfold and what what
[1:46:37] it's clear
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; break this not break this not do this
[1:46:40] put this here put this here it's over
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; because you get clarity what did Habac
[1:46:44] say WRITE THE VISION
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; MAKE IT PLAIN
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU WILL REACH AND RUN NOT MAKE IT
[1:46:51] COMPLEX OR GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT MAKE IT
[1:46:54] PLAIN GOD LOVES CLARITY Tallel
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; vision brings clarity.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; That why Jesus operate by vision.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; That why Bible say without a vision you
[1:47:13] perish.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Vision means you see it before it
[1:47:16] happens.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; This church is built by vision.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; What you see here was vision
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; materialized. Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; I ask you on Friday to say and repeat
[1:47:34] after me, make me a revival.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Let the revival be in me.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You want revival for the church. You
[1:47:40] know you, you
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; individual.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; You're poor father, POOR MOTHER, POOR
[1:47:48] HUSBAND, poor wife. But make me a
[1:47:50] revival.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; It will change your whole atmosphere
[1:47:53] around you.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; They were brought into the presence of
[1:48:05] Bam. Just as soon as these Greeks was
[1:48:08] pointed to Jesus, Jesus did not point to
[1:48:11] himself.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; So why all these ministers pointing to
[1:48:15] the church?
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus never say, "Aha, all you want to
[1:48:18] see me. Here am I. I am. You know who
[1:48:20] I'm Jesus. Oh, I'm so glad to meet you.
[1:48:23] God bless you. No, Jesus didn't do that.
[1:48:27] Listen to this.
[1:48:29] He did not make himself known to them
[1:48:31] because you cannot know Jesus in that
[1:48:35] way.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus is known in that way. But we see
[1:48:39] here in the scripture when the Greeks
[1:48:42] was brought up to Jesus, here we go. And
[1:48:45] was in his presence,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; we're not talking about brought up to
[1:48:48] books and tapes
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; and I believe the message. We're not
[1:48:50] talking about that.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; We're talking about beyond the word.
[1:48:53] Hallelujah.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; We talking about presence.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; See what we fighting for?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; That's why I say praise God. Worship God
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; because normally and naturally you're
[1:49:03] not into that.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; You in your flesh. You're in yourself.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; You're in your human.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; But to praise God is to defy gravity. To
[1:49:12] lift your hand. That say praise him.
[1:49:14] Praise him in the good time. Praise him
[1:49:15] in the bad time. Hallelujah. Praising is
[1:49:18] not about you. It's about who he is.
[1:49:20] Worship is not about you. is about who
[1:49:22] God is. He's the object of worship.
[1:49:25] Hallelujah. Whether things working out
[1:49:27] or not, you're still worshiping. Then
[1:49:29] the God could say, "Look at them.
[1:49:31] They're worshiping me regardless. THEY
[1:49:33] CUT THE PAY, THEY WORSHIP. THEY LOST
[1:49:35] THEIR JOB. THEY WORSHIP. THE TASK GET
[1:49:38] TWO FLAT TIRES AND THEY'RE STILL
[1:49:39] WORSHIPING. I have to bless that person.
[1:49:42] I have to back that PERSON UP. LET THE
[1:49:44] ANGELS GO FORWARD." OH, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:49:47] HALLELUJAH. YOU THINK THAT'S FARFETCHED?
[1:49:50] Let me tell you something. No, the the
[1:49:52] two were brought brothers, Bished.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell them and whis in their
[1:49:57] ears. They accustom praying, busting the
[1:50:00] door open. They wasn't backslitting as
[1:50:01] us.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Catch them.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; There's three times that they pray.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't ask how much time you pray
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; and show I raise of hands. I wouldn't
[1:50:16] ask that.
[1:50:18] Hallelujah.

[1:50:21] jealous them fellas and them them fell

[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; pray normal

[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; they say no problem
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; they answer you know
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; now if you're not in the faith

[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take us one time. We're not
[1:50:54] bowing down.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Our God is God. He is able to deliver TO
[1:50:58] BOW DOWN. OUR ABLE GOD IS ABLE TO
[1:51:00] DELIVER US. AND IF WE DON'T DELIVER US,

[1:51:07] TO SEND ON FIRE. OUR IS GOING TO SEND NO
[1:51:10] MIRACLES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN.

[1:51:15] LISTEN,

[1:51:24] God has telling me to hold back, hold
[1:51:25] back, hold back. I go NUMB MYSELF.
[1:51:28] HALLELUJAH. I go numb myself. And when

[1:51:32] BANDS WERE LOOSE AND THEY SAW A FOURTH
[1:51:34] MAN. THEY THREW THREE MEN IN THE FIRE.

[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; as soon as they were brought into his
[1:52:36] presence. That's the main thing.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Get the people in his presence.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; I told his ministers in M right here in
[1:52:47] that I said I don't want to hear all the
[1:52:48] revelations. I want to hear what the
[1:52:49] prophet say.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; I want to hear no private revelation.
[1:52:54] God sent a prophet for me to bring no
[1:52:55] private revelation. God bring me God
[1:52:58] sent me to do that. I dream last night
[1:53:00] and dream last night and that certain
[1:53:02] things I don't touch.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I touching the star, the moon, the comet
[1:53:05] and I don't touch them things at all.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; They have enough external sign to fight
[1:53:09] up with. I want to know what's supposed
[1:53:10] to be inside of here.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I want to know what is the bright sign.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; It have people food is on astrology and
[1:53:20] diet of of stars and Venus and Mars and

[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Why you want to do my thing?
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; The thing that God want me to do.

[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; that's
[1:53:43] Trump say and back down. He could do
[1:53:45] that.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; We can't do that.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; God can't do that. When God say his
[1:53:49] thing, he don't back down on it. HE
[1:53:51] SAID, "MY WORD SHALL NOT RETURN IN the
[1:53:53] void." God don't BACK DOWN WHEN HE said
[1:53:56] his thing. He says seven time revival.
[1:53:58] He can't BACK DOWN ON THAT. HEY, GLORY

[1:54:35] GLORY. [cheering]
[1:54:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:38] WHERE THERE IS GOD, THERE IS NOISE. NO
[1:54:41] NOISE. NO GOD. WHEREVER JESUS IS.
[1:54:45] HOSANA. HOSANA. HOSANA.
[1:54:51] Give the LORD SOME PRAISES. I AM NOT
[1:54:53] ASHAMED OF THE SON OF MAN NOR HIS WORDS.
[1:54:57] I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THIS MESSAGE. I AM
[1:54:59] NOT ASHAMED OF THIS GOSPEL.
[1:55:03] [cheering]
[1:55:12] That's the main thing. What's the main
[1:55:14] thing? Get the people in his presence.
[1:55:18] As soon as in his presence Jesus said,
[1:55:21] "Except a corner of wheat falls into the
[1:55:23] ground and die, it's abide alone."
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; What an unusual thing. Instead of
[1:55:27] accepting the introduction, the thing he
[1:55:30] done was pointing them to the place
[1:55:32] where they could find him.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He pointed them to that great truth.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; How to see him.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; They could not see him in that eternal
[1:55:42] life
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; standing there the way he was. He was a
[1:55:45] man. But he pointed them in his
[1:55:47] presence. Christ. Oh, [groaning] I now
[1:55:50] get it. Because the people not coming
[1:55:53] into presence, they're not seeing the
[1:55:56] Calvary
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; where they're supposed to go and die out
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; to see Jesus.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; So then they fall in love with the
[1:56:03] church.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; They fall in love with the doctrine of
[1:56:06] the church, the creed.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; That's decreed. You know,
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Catholic church have decreed
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; that message with the creed.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; You see? So hear us now.
[1:56:15] He pointed them there in his presence.
[1:56:17] Christ pointed them to the truth. He
[1:56:20] said how to see him was to go to the
[1:56:23] cross
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; except a corner wheat falls. It abides
[1:56:26] alone. And if he did not die, listen
[1:56:29] with Christ now. If he did not die,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; he would have to abide alone himself.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; If he did not die, but him being the
[1:56:38] corner wheat that fell into the ground,
[1:56:39] then if it falls into the ground, it
[1:56:42] would bring forth an abundance. If it
[1:56:44] falls into the ground and die, first it
[1:56:46] has to be a gumatized grain.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; That means have to be a grain with the
[1:56:51] spirit baptism in it.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; To be a corner wheat.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; So first you have to identify what this
[1:56:57] corner wheat is.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; He said first it must be a gemized grain
[1:57:00] or it won't bring forth nothing. But he
[1:57:02] had to give his own life in order to
