[56:49] you and

[56:56] to read Joshua 1 1-3 says Joshua now
[57:00] after the death of Moses the servant of
[57:01] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[57:04] spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses
[57:07] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[57:10] now therefore arise go over this Jord
[57:12] and thou and all this people unto the
[57:15] land which I do give them even to the
[57:17] children of Israel every place that the
[57:19] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[57:21] have given unto you as I said unto Moses
[57:25] and the prophet said this
[57:27] and the church organizations
[57:29] denomination has
[57:30] failed they will not take the church
[57:33] over God will raise up a new system amen
[57:38] a interdenominational system yes sir by
[57:41] the power of
[57:44] God that will take the church into the
[57:47] promised land organization and the
[57:50] nomination has messed it up each one
[57:53] after their own theology each one one
[57:56] after their own way of thinking but God
[57:59] will take his Holy Spirit and will raise
[58:03] up his Joshua that will take the church
[58:06] to the promise with no denominational
[58:10] strings tied anywhere but will take over
[58:13] his church amen Moses had failed he was
[58:17] a lawgiver Joshua has
[58:19] [Music]
[58:24] called Joshua had called
[58:29] with Moses had fail he was a lawgiver
[58:32] Joshua was called of Grace and he took
[58:35] the church over when that headstone come
[58:38] it will come with shoutings of Grace
[58:41] Grace unto him but Brandon said if the
[58:43] power of God has to come among the
[58:44] people it wouldn't even be their prayer
[58:47] it would be the grace of God oh Blessed
[58:50] Be let's all stand and I want to sing

[1:00:19] weekend also we salute the
[1:00:23] fivefold for the wonderful job that have
[1:00:26] done the wonderful greetings we have
[1:00:29] had and we can say that we have a
[1:00:32] wonderful
[1:00:34] time sometime it is said what more to
[1:00:37] say but the truth be told we cannot
[1:00:40] exhaust the goodness and the mercies of
[1:00:42] God God always have a
[1:00:45] more just want to read a portion of
[1:00:48] scripture here and for a few moments I
[1:00:50] would
[1:00:51] Age come Revelation
[1:00:54] 3 21 and 22 to him that overcometh will
[1:00:59] I grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:01:03] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[1:01:06] father in his throne he that had an air
[1:01:09] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[1:01:11] the churches God bless his precious
[1:01:14] words to our hearts amen you may be
[1:01:19] seated using this text God's Prophet
[1:01:23] ministered for us how can I
[1:01:28] overcome but a study of the word
[1:01:33] overcoming the study of the word to
[1:01:36] overcome we need to come to a
[1:01:39] recognition we could never overcome
[1:01:43] anything so the title seems to be
[1:01:46] Paradox how can I overcome when the
[1:01:50] truth be told we cannot overcome
[1:01:53] anything so what it is
[1:01:56] it is he that overcame for me Hallelujah
[1:02:01] it is he that overcame for me in the
[1:02:04] message Paradox God's Prophet speaking
[1:02:06] of a young man he said in his El
[1:02:09] intellectuals he's trying his best to
[1:02:12] overcome the thing but he cannot do it
[1:02:17] in his intellectuals he's trying his
[1:02:21] best to overcome the thing but he cannot
[1:02:25] do it
[1:02:26] Christ will have to come and overcome it
[1:02:30] let Christ come in you already
[1:02:35] overcome how can I overcome when we let
[1:02:39] Christ in because he already overcome
[1:02:43] for us hallelujah so we never overcome
[1:02:48] we did not overcome one thing we are
[1:02:51] just HS tonight of what he already
[1:02:55] overcame
[1:02:58] amen and amen and amen so we give praise
[1:03:01] to almighty God Amen what it is all
[1:03:05] about it means that the god in you is
[1:03:09] greater and mightier than the devil
[1:03:13] Hallelujah the god in you overcoming has
[1:03:16] nothing to do with you it has to do with
[1:03:20] the god in you the god in you is what
[1:03:24] make you more than a match for the enemy
[1:03:28] that is real
[1:03:29] overcoming real overcoming is to
[1:03:32] recognize the god in you is greater than
[1:03:37] the devil Hallelujah trust God these
[1:03:40] meetings will revive that thought in our
[1:03:43] hearts amen the God of this world is not
[1:03:48] as great as the god that is in you the
[1:03:52] Word of Promise we have is greater is he
[1:03:57] that is in
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:01] Hallelujah glory to
[1:04:03] God so how do I overcome it is not me
[1:04:08] overcoming it is the word in me it is
[1:04:12] the word in me and who is that word that
[1:04:17] word is almighty
[1:04:20] God hallelujah so we want to thank God
[1:04:23] that go we could walk with a s
[1:04:26] we are not a fearful people we are not
[1:04:29] walking in any scar we are fearless as
[1:04:32] our brother ministered for us last night
[1:04:35] we have no scare because the god in you
[1:04:39] the God in Me is greater than the god in
[1:04:43] the world so we recognize by that by
[1:04:47] God's grace how did I overcome amen so
[1:04:53] we want to thank God to be a short
[1:04:56] tonight nothing could overtake
[1:04:59] you nothing could suede you Hallelujah
[1:05:05] because you are full of superpower you
[1:05:09] are full of superpower and that
[1:05:12] superpower is the Holy Spirit by God's
[1:05:16] grace in the message Easter seal God's
[1:05:20] Prophet tells
[1:05:22] us but I didn't I
[1:05:26] that's not okay the acts of the Prophet
[1:05:30] but I didn't didn't quit nothing I
[1:05:34] didn't overcome nothing I never overcome
[1:05:37] nothing if I tell you I overcome it I'll
[1:05:39] go back and do
[1:05:41] it I tell you I overcome it I will go
[1:05:45] back and do it but I didn't I didn't
[1:05:49] quit nothing he just come to me and took
[1:05:53] it out of me woo
[1:05:59] Hallelujah glory to God so tonight it is
[1:06:03] not what I did but it is what he has
[1:06:08] already done it is he that did it glory
[1:06:14] and praise to almighty God Amen and
[1:06:19] amen so brother that is how we overcame
[1:06:22] that is how we overcome is Christ the
[1:06:25] word in a message WAP here and we be
[1:06:28] look at it on another angle in the
[1:06:30] message WRA here paragraph 147 God's
[1:06:33] Prophet tells us unless that was God's
[1:06:36] seed his Gene from the beginning you are
[1:06:42] gone what overcoming has to do with
[1:06:45] me what overcoming has to do with me
[1:06:49] unless you was God's seed unless you was
[1:06:54] God's G from the beginning you are
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:04] finished as our brother said that is
[1:07:07] from another realm
[1:07:09] Hallelujah is a about fact we already
[1:07:13] overcome as a matter of fact we already
[1:07:18] overcome somebody overcame for us
[1:07:22] hallelujah hallelujah we want to thank
[1:07:25] God tonight brother sister there is
[1:07:27] something in you there is something in
[1:07:30] me something that you never put
[1:07:34] there there is overcoming brother it
[1:07:38] will give us a recognition now we
[1:07:40] understand what it mean to praise God
[1:07:43] what it mean to give the glory to God it
[1:07:45] means that it has nothing to do with me
[1:07:48] there's nothing to do with me glory to
[1:07:53] God hallelujah
[1:07:56] there is something in you there is
[1:07:59] something in me you never put there it
[1:08:03] is something that you could not desire
[1:08:06] to be there it is something that is
[1:08:09] contrary to your nature it is the for
[1:08:12] knowledge of God taking place Oh Glory
[1:08:16] Glory Glory Glory Glory so when we look
[1:08:20] at it in that angle we will get to
[1:08:23] understand who we really praise

[1:08:28] worthy of Praise who is worthy of
[1:08:31] worship it is he we worship he is the

[2:00:13] us that he will be in
[2:00:15] us that when we walk we can take the
[2:00:18] spirit to where the spirit can lead and

[2:00:28] world of what Glory God don't do things
[2:00:31] for our Glory he does things for his
[2:00:35] glory so in order for him to trust you

[2:01:14] you ready to vindicate the word not by
[2:01:16] your might now it's not by might nor by
[2:01:19] power but by my spirit
[2:01:25] and that statement concludes with what
[2:01:28] sayth the Lord and you know that that se
[2:01:31] of the Lord cannot
[2:01:33] fail okay the harest
[2:01:37] time now Malachi 4 teach
[2:01:41] us that great that before the great and
[2:01:44] terrible day of the Lord shall come this
[2:01:46] will take place amen how many knows that
[2:01:51] I'm coming to my message
[2:01:53] now amen and he will restore the hearts
[2:01:57] of the children to the fathers is that
[2:02:00] right the faith of the original
[2:02:02] Pentecostal fathers and in that day Luke
[2:02:05] 17:20 I believe it is Jesus said when
[2:02:07] the son of man is being revealed not
[2:02:10] man the son of man not an
[2:02:13] organization the son of man The Living
[2:02:16] Word itself again among the
[2:02:19] people this word church must
[2:02:24] live we are not crazy when we are
[2:02:26] passionate about the
[2:02:29] message we are not
[2:02:33] crazy because even the Muslims in the
[2:02:36] Quran it is written that we are the
[2:02:39] people of the
[2:02:40] book that is how they refer to
[2:02:43] Christians so even the enemy knows that
[2:02:46] you are the people of the book that book
[2:02:49] that no man was worthy no man was worthy
[2:02:52] to look on no man was worthy to lose the
[2:02:54] seals no man was worthy and John was
[2:02:59] weeping they know that we are the people
[2:03:02] of the
[2:03:05] book and there is power in that
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:09] book and he came himself to redeem the
[2:03:13] book because they were names in that
[2:03:16] book my name was in that book that is
[2:03:19] why I am crazy about Jesus Christ
[2:03:22] that is why I don't play with this God
[2:03:24] that I serve that is why I am passionate
[2:03:27] about him and I tell my children there
[2:03:29] is no hope for you anywhere I don't care
[2:03:32] what you stay it to become it is nothing
[2:03:36] unless this is in
[2:03:42] you once we are on this area we can get
[2:03:44] our degrees and our jobs and our
[2:03:47] professions but beyond that there's a
[2:03:51] day to be born and there's a day to die
[2:03:55] when you die your certificate becomes
[2:03:59] useless that job you don't have time for
[2:04:02] God they will replace you the next
[2:04:04] second they will not even think about
[2:04:07] you so I better get this there I better
[2:04:10] get this certificate I better get the
[2:04:12] token I better get the Holy Ghost I
[2:04:15] better break every shackle I better
[2:04:17] denounce everything and get the power
[2:04:20] let him enforce the Spirit into my soul
[2:04:23] oh it will save you when you are dying
[2:04:25] it will T you from your life it will
[2:04:28] heal you when you are
[2:04:31] sick we are not
[2:04:33] [Applause]
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:47] [Applause]

[2:04:52] we are not crazy if we are crazy we are
[2:04:55] crazy for
[2:04:56] [Applause]
[2:05:00] Jesus some are crazy for
[2:05:03] JayZ some are crazy for Michael Jackson
[2:05:06] some are crazy for whatever nonsense but
[2:05:09] we are crazy for King Jesus because he's
[2:05:13] coming back again I know my Jesus is
[2:05:17] coming back again he's coming back for
[2:05:20] me but without that I can't
[2:05:26] [Applause]
[2:05:30] go Hallelujah so he promised to
[2:05:33] restore so if you are not there you
[2:05:37] maybe see them and restoration is not

[2:06:46] restored treasure big
[2:06:50] time so we are looking for a
[2:06:53] restoration we're not looking for a
[2:06:55] Reformation oh just change a little bit
[2:06:58] no that's not what we are asking for we
[2:07:00] are asking to be fully restored where
[2:07:03] you can have a direct communication with
[2:07:06] Christ oh when you speak he will hear
[2:07:08] you when you cry he will answer oh that
[2:07:11] is what we are talking about church amen
[2:07:15] hallelujah as I wind down I'm I'm I'm
[2:07:18] I'm done praise God Reformation
[2:07:22] anytime there is a
[2:07:24] restoration God sends
[2:07:30] Elijah Elijah's spirit is with what
[2:07:36] restoration when Jezebel messed up
[2:07:39] Israel God had to raise Elijah the
[2:07:43] tishbite Hallelujah and when he prayed
[2:07:46] that prayer after he had reped the altar
[2:07:50] he said Lord I have done this according
[2:07:52] to Thy word that the people's heart will
[2:07:55] be 10 turn back praise God they hard
[2:07:59] heart to be restored Elijah brought back
[2:08:02] God back to Israel and when God sent the
[2:08:05] fire the people said Elijah is God he is
[2:08:08] the god they must see the restoration
[2:08:11] they must confess that the time of
[2:08:13] Resurrection has come God was brought
[2:08:16] back to

[2:08:20] Israel oh oh

[2:08:28] tonight Hallelujah and when Jesus
[2:08:32] came that was the mightiest
[2:08:36] Resurrection John the Baptist had to
[2:08:38] come in the spirit of
[2:08:41] Elijah Hallelujah because Jesus had come
[2:08:45] to restore all
[2:08:46] things the Pharisees couldn't understand
[2:08:49] that the Sadducees could not understand
[2:08:51] the understand that but it was time for
[2:08:54] the book to be restored it was time for
[2:08:58] the price to be paid it was time for
[2:09:01] Redemption to be
[2:09:06] completed John the Baptist had to come
[2:09:08] on the
[2:09:12] scene and when Pentecost came on the
[2:09:17] scene they messed up
[2:09:21] brought organization into the
[2:09:23] system God had to send a
[2:09:27] restoration but in Joel 1 when you read
[2:09:30] the scripture in Joel 1 he told them he
[2:09:34] said tell your children let them tell
[2:09:37] their children and their children's
[2:09:40] children that what the caterpillar had
[2:09:43] left the lucos had
[2:09:45] eatting the word of the Lord came onto
[2:09:49] Joel to tell them the of the time that
[2:09:53] what the caterpillar left the Locust has
[2:09:55] eaten what the Locust has left the power
[2:09:57] has eaten what the power left the caner
[2:09:59] woman has eaten just to tell them the
[2:10:02] rotness of the time the deadness of the
[2:10:04] time praise be the name of the Lord but
[2:10:07] he told them what to do Anda hit it
[2:10:10] yesterday call for a solemn assembly let
[2:10:13] the ministers go wailing and crying and
[2:10:15] praying oh there's something that can be
[2:10:17] done because the enforcer must drop down
[2:10:20] to bring back a
[2:10:22] restoration oh come on now come on now
[2:10:26] come on now and in Joel 2 he returned
[2:10:30] back and told them praise God he said

[2:10:36] trumpet come on blow the trumpet blow
[2:10:39] the trumpet let them hear your shout let
[2:10:42] them hear your Victory before he's going
[2:10:45] to do it let them hear it because I will
[2:10:48] restore to you to you all all the years
[2:10:53] not part of it all the years I am going
[2:10:56] to restore what the P destroyed I will
[2:10:59] restore what the caner worm destroyed I
[2:11:01] will restore what the Locust are eating
[2:11:03] I will restore and he had to send Elijah
[2:11:06] the prophet in our day to bring us back
[2:11:10] the word and Elijah told us that four
[2:11:13] death Messengers destroy that tree oh
[2:11:17] Hallelujah but thank God in the ministry
[2:11:20] of Elijah the prophet he had to take
[2:11:23] four life Messengers to restore the

[2:11:40] Messengers and Elijah Elijah's Ministry
[2:11:45] was the fourth flight that brought back
[2:11:47] the full restoration
[2:11:52] and that is where we are today we are
[2:11:55] part of that light we are the one that
[2:11:57] have been restored so he says blow the

[2:13:20] mind F and brought them right
[2:13:23] [Applause]
[2:13:26] back is there anything too hard for the
[2:13:30] Lord we are under a
[2:13:35] promise when Elijah restored back that
[2:13:38] place God restored back the altar he

[3:24:30] when he went to India and the spirit the
[3:24:32] presence of God came now people began to

[3:24:39] matter what the culture the nationality
[3:24:41] was you know there comes a point when
