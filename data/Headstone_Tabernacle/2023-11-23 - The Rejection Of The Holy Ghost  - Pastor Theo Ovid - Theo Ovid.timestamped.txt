[26:12] being here tonight if have your Bibles I
[26:14] like to 1st Samuel chapter 8 we want to
[26:17] read verse 1
[26:19] to8 Romans chapter 8 want to read from 1
[26:22] to9 13 to 15 we're grateful to God to be
[26:26] here tonight amen
[26:28] amen
[26:30] reading
[26:32] uh 1st Samuel 8 verse one and it came to
[26:37] pass when Samuel was old he made his
[26:39] sons judges over Israel now the name of
[26:41] his firstborn was Joel and his name of
[26:43] the second ABIA they were judges in bipa
[26:47] his sons walk not as in his ways but
[26:50] turn aside after Luca took bribes
[26:53] perverted
[26:55] judgment then all the elders
[26:58] gather themselves together and came to
[27:01] Samuel andto Rama and said unto him
[27:03] behold thou are old thy Sons walk not in
[27:07] thy ways now make us a king to judge us
[27:12] like all the nations but the thing
[27:15] displeased Samuel when they said give us
[27:18] a king to judge us Samuel prayed unto
[27:21] the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel
[27:23] hacken unto the voice of the people in
[27:26] all that they say unto thee for they
[27:29] have not rejected thee but have rejected
[27:32] me that I should not Reign Over them
[27:36] according to all the works which they
[27:38] have done since the day that I brought
[27:40] them out of Egypt even unto this day
[27:42] where they have forsaken me and serve
[27:46] other gods so do they also unto thee and
[27:50] from Romans chapter 8 reading from verse
[27:54] one there is therefore now no
[27:56] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[27:58] Jesus who walked not after the flesh but
[28:00] after the spirit for the law of the
[28:03] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[28:05] me free from the law of sin and death
[28:07] for what the law could not do that it
[28:10] was weak through the flesh God sended
[28:12] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[28:15] flesh and for sin condemn sin in the
[28:18] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[28:20] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[28:22] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[28:25] they that are after The Flesh do minor
[28:27] things of the flesh but they that are
[28:29] after the spirit the things of the
[28:31] spirit for to be kindly mind is death
[28:34] but to be spiritually minding is life
[28:36] and peace because the carnal mind is
[28:41] enmity against God for it is not subject
[28:45] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[28:48] so then they that are in the flesh
[28:50] cannot please God but ye are not in the
[28:53] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[28:55] the spirit of God dwell in you
[28:58] and now if any man have not the spirit
[28:59] of Christ he's not of his his let's go
[29:02] down to verse
[29:03] 13 for if you live after the flesh he
[29:06] shall die but if you through the spirit
[29:09] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[29:11] shall live for as many as are led by the
[29:14] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[29:17] for you have not received the spirit of
[29:19] ab bondage against the fear but you have
[29:21] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[29:23] we cry AB father let's pray father we
[29:26] thank you for your word and it's a joy
[29:28] to read your word and to hear your word
[29:30] and to oh God be in contact with this
[29:33] word Lord make this word a reality

[30:01] but always a privilege to be in the
[30:03] house of God we don't have this right
[30:05] it's a privilege okay our title tonight
[30:09] the rejection of the Holy
[30:12] Ghost the rejection of the Holy Ghost i'
[30:15] have an inspiration to live after the
[30:17] flesh or to live after the spirit your
[30:20] choice it's your choice all right let's
[30:23] go let's get down let the tires hit the
[30:26] road now let's let's go brother BR there
[30:30] are only going to be two classes of
[30:32] people in the last day not 22 not 44
[30:35] just two both of them is going to wear a
[30:38] mark the mark of God is the baptism of
[30:41] the Holy Spirit without a shadow of
[30:44] doubt that's the mark of God and the
[30:47] mark of the beast is not Corona virus
[30:50] and taking vaccine all right all that
[30:53] foolishness that that that gone already
[30:54] now all right the mark of God is the
[30:57] baptism of the Holy Spirit without a
[30:59] Shadow of Doubt I preached that not long
[31:02] ago by the Holy Spirit help and the word
[31:04] of God and proved it that the Seal of
[31:07] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:10] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy
[31:11] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[31:14] until the day of your Redemption without
[31:16] the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but
[31:18] the holy spirit is God sealed and then
[31:22] all that was not sealed by the Holy
[31:25] Spirit took on the of the Beast and the
[31:28] mark of the beast is the mark of
[31:30] apostasy which is rejecting the Holy
[31:33] Spirit you see what I mean glory to God
[31:36] and then when the Year of Jubilee listen
[31:38] prophecy when the Year of Jubilee or the
[31:41] blast comes the people are receiving the
[31:43] holy spirit so there's a prophecy that
[31:46] you're going to be receiving Holy Spirit
[31:47] there's a prophecy that you're going to
[31:48] be Year of Jubilee there's a prophecy
[31:50] when the blast going to come out oh give
[31:52] the Lord a shout in the house this a
[31:55] finished yet is about to get started Oh
[31:57] Glory to God we speak it by the
[31:59] testimony of Jesus we speak it by the
[32:01] spirit of Prophecy oh give the Lord some
[32:03] Praises when the Year of Jubilee or that
[32:06] blast comes the people are receiving
[32:09] Holy Spirit and you deliberately
[32:12] willfully turn it down God has no more
[32:15] or not under any obligation to speak to
[32:17] you anymore then you'll be marked off he
[32:21] said the old types of the Old Testament
[32:23] and type shadow of the new to reject
[32:26] Christ and to turn him down that he
[32:28] knocked at your door you in danger line
[32:31] of being bored through the air Faith
[32:33] come by hearing and hearing the word of
[32:35] God and God will put a blind over your
[32:37] ears that you'll never be able to
[32:39] understand no more and you will do no
[32:41] more than criticize the gospel as long
[32:43] as you live and die and be lost
[32:46] forever

[34:23] to bring on a new birth Oh Glory to God
[34:26] we find out that the Pentecostal was in
[34:28] the womb so they didn't get that birth
[34:30] the birth have to come by the word and
[34:32] the word comes to the prophet so when
[34:34] the prophet brought the word we could be
[34:36] born by the word and by the spirit
[34:39] correctly oh give the Lord some Praises
[34:42] Give the Lord a shout hallelujah
[34:45] hallelujah let's ride now now watch this

[35:00] in the church world today I'm going to
[35:03] get this off my shoulder and then I have
[35:05] it over with we all know that's the word
[35:07] of God and the denominational system

[35:11] saying that two system work in this
[35:13] message in this message I I'm not
[35:16] talking about outside the message
[35:18] whatever preaching here is in the
[35:19] message we talking about all right let's
[35:21] go all right I'm going to get all right

[35:32] the flesh Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[35:35] could we give the Lord a shout one after
[35:38] the spirit it means you're going after

[35:43] the spirit glory to God and one going
[35:46] after the flesh Oh Glory to God your
[35:50] choice if you want to live after the
[35:52] spirit or after the flesh your choice
[35:55] nobody have forcing you your choice

[36:14] right one after the spirit one flesh and
[36:16] what is it Esau and Jacob was fighting
[36:17] in the womb of the mother and even at
[36:19] the time they were born and so is the
[36:21] nominals and the word fighting one
[36:24] against the other now he said they say

[36:30] if they pick this up and goes out with
[36:34] it they can make more sense to it he
[36:37] didn't stop there some people stop there
[36:40] and make us feel like we doing stripp
[36:42] like if we making more sense than what
[36:43] the prophet say that not what you mean
[36:45] here we talking about write the vision
[36:46] and make it plain making the same vision
[36:49] plain because the spirit the prophet and
[36:52] the bride will say the same thing and
[36:54] what they say will already be said in
[36:58] the word no new
[37:00] mystery Liars out there oh glory to God

[37:39] all butam could have do put the seed
[37:41] then he come and said then hope they
[37:44] make it come to life and that is what we
[37:46] striving for here in The Headstone
[37:49] Tabernacle striving to hope to get these
[37:51] seeds to come to life I don't want to be
[37:54] talking talking explaining explaining I
[37:56] want to see sees come to life come alive
[37:59] the word made flesh the invisible made
[38:02] visible oh give the Lord some Praises

[38:10] Esau just a man of the world very
[38:12] religious he's all right good fellow

[38:17] didn't know nothing about the
[38:20] birthright he's born that way he is
[38:24] shaped that way wow he's saw no
[38:26] Mysteries he saw no Revelation and all
[38:29] kind of word and teaching and
[38:30] explanation and whatnot but the
[38:31] birthright part but let's talk about
[38:34] Jacob now and Jacob I don't care what he
[38:37] is he wants that Birthright he's the
[38:40] spiritual one he is the spiritual one he
[38:43] little
[38:44] Trixie he little
[38:47] skull but he's a spiritual one them two
[38:50] today is in the womb of the church
[38:53] there's a great big system trying to be
[38:55] formed called the work Con churches and
[38:58] from the womb of the church is coming
[39:00] forth two children you just mark my word
[39:04] prophecy now the word must deliver the
[39:07] word bride
[39:09] Church who who bringing that the word
[39:12] the church has got to be delivered out
[39:14] of her a bride from Christ then them
[39:17] that asleep in all ages will make up
[39:19] that bride that come out of the word
[39:21] they come out of us isn't that right now
[39:24] watch these systems will not grow out of
[39:26] that he said no what they are both in
[39:28] the same
[39:29] field watered by the same water same
[39:33] sunlight one is the word and one is not
[39:36] the word and they are fighting they have
[39:39] been fighting since the First
[39:41] Reformation they're still fighting
[39:44] Hallelujah but say what system are you
[39:47] in two
[39:49] systems one system is after the Flesh
[39:53] and one system is after the spirit now
[39:56] watch this now Israel the church let's a
[40:00] few minutes let's follow her a few
[40:01] minutes she had birth pains at his
[40:04] message every under every Prophet The
[40:06] Prophet had the word and she had shown
[40:08] so much rotness and so much systematic
[40:11] orders in her being until this Prophet
[40:14] shook her off her foundation they were
[40:17] hated by everybody therefore when God
[40:19] sent a prophet the church itself went in
[40:22] the bir pains because of the Prophet Oh
[40:25] Glory to God the word of the Lord comes
[40:27] to a prophet watch and the churches they
[40:31] build so many systems around the word
[40:34] now is around the word they build the
[40:35] systems come on now it's around the word
[40:37] around the same message they build their
[40:39] systems around it around the word it's
[40:41] not the word it's around WR the word
[40:43] that why they using word they're using
[40:44] the the word as as like ketchup or like
[40:47] sauce or like pepper sauce they sprinkle
[40:50] their Doctrine and their Revelations
[40:51] with a little message thing now you know
[40:53] what I mean you season it with that let
[40:55] let people know what you know why still
[40:56] connected with that all right let's go
[40:59] watch this now they build so many system
[41:01] around the word until she shook off her
[41:03] Rock when he come she had birth pains
[41:06] what was it back to the word back to the
[41:09] life there's a prophet speaking there
[41:11] know the rocking is what back to the
[41:13] word back to the life systems doesn't
[41:16] have a life it's only God's word has
[41:19] life the systems are built around it but
[41:22] they do not have life the life is Faith
[41:25] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[41:28] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[41:30] love of God holy spirit that is life
[41:33] systems are built around that but that
[41:35] is not that oh give the Lord some
[41:36] Praises glory to God Hallelujah huj the
[41:41] systems are built around it where but it
[41:43] doesn't have life it is the word that
[41:45] gives life all right let's go going good
[41:49] now watch something we know the old seed
[41:52] must the new seed can come out of the
[41:54] old seed it must rot not die but rot
[41:57] after his death now this is deep this is
[42:00] something to be taught not just die you
[42:02] know but
[42:03] rot not just die but rot when you rot
[42:07] you can't go
[42:10] back that's the same thing in a new
[42:13] birth we never go back we go forward
[42:16] when you are born again there are so
[42:18] many that's why we have not so many
[42:20] genuine new Birds it because the seed
[42:22] will sympathize with the word of the
[42:24] person but they don't here we go want to
[42:27] rot away from the old system that they
[42:30] were in that's why I had to press the
[42:33] light God say leave more bites you I
[42:35] more that mountain I leave es that
[42:37] mountain leave them alone leave people
[42:38] alone you drag them and P light they get
[42:40] some more bites inside of here and they
[42:42] get some es Shing out here and that will
[42:45] be problems you what I'm saying go I
[42:48] want to see God at the right people
[42:50] because I want God increase our borders
[42:52] increase our Coast at the right people
[42:54] inside of here we have enough little
[42:56] cucko already we have enough of that we
[42:58] we we we could do it less than that all
[43:00] right let's continue
[43:02] watch they don't want to rot away from
[43:06] the old system that were they were in
[43:09] they don't want to come out of it they
[43:11] want to stay in the old system and claim
[43:13] the new birth doesn't work that way the
[43:15] message of the age we found that under
[43:17] Luther Wesley Pentecostal all the ages
[43:19] they still try to hold on to the old
[43:21] system and claim this you can't and
[43:24] people say don't want to admit that were
[43:26] off and they went off the word the
[43:28] pastor was off the whole church was off
[43:30] key and they had to rot out of that they
[43:32] to fire burn that oh glory to God come
[43:35] out at a complete system burn it Oh
[43:38] Glory to God put dynamite and throw
[43:40] everything behind you blow up the bridge
[43:41] behind you and go forward Oh Glory to
[43:44] God hallelujah hallelujah when they talk
[43:47] Elijah stay here he say stay where gigal
[43:49] Jero betel he said no as the Lord liveth
[43:52] praise God I ain't staying here don't

[43:56] I'm moving with the pillar of fire I'm
[43:58] moving with the cloud let's move with
[44:00] the cloud oh give the Lord some Praises
[44:03] glory to God they know the old system is
[44:07] dead but they just don't want to rot out
[44:10] of it now rot is when you're really done
[44:13] away with it a claim is made and they
[44:17] are newborn but a claim is only a
[44:19] begotten sign this is deep stuff here
[44:21] now a claim is what a begotten sign the
[44:24] begotten is in the womb I claim this I
[44:26] claim that I claim that that a born yet
[44:28] that's a begotten sign Oh Glory to God
[44:30] he said ring brings forth the new birth
[44:33] you got to rot away from it and just a
[44:36] it all the ages oh give the Lord some
[44:38] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[44:41] glory to God all right let's go during
[44:44] these Church ages there are two Spirits
[44:47] working among right down through here
[44:50] one is denomination the other one is the
[44:52] Holy Ghost amen and Jesus said they were
[44:56] so close that we receive the very
[44:58] elected if it's possible these two
[45:02] Spirits are marking their people for
[45:05] future
[45:07] judgment so the holy spirit is marking
[45:09] you tonight to be sealed Oh Glory to God
[45:13] and the and and the devil amen power is
[45:16] marking people tonight to be judged but

[45:27] to be people Mark for the Rapture Mark
[45:29] for the resurrection oh give the Lord
[45:31] some Praises tonight oh glory to God let
[45:35] me read it again these two Spirits are
[45:37] marking their people for future judgment
[45:40] oh my hallelujah hallelujah and brother
[45:44] bam said this let me show you another
[45:46] reason why Satan hates This Book of
[45:48] Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[45:50] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[45:53] yesterday today and forever he changes
[45:55] is not he knows a whole lot more than do
[45:58] 90% of theologians he knows that since
[46:01] God is immutable in his nature then he's
[46:03] immutable in his ways thus Satan knows
[46:06] assuredly that the original church at
[46:08] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[46:13] in action we are talking about turle and
[46:16] and and a secret we not talking about
[46:17] that
[46:19] yet people talk about a secret not a
[46:23] public show I public I Mark 16
[46:26] that what Jesus say hallelujah watch he
[46:30] said watch thus Satan knows assuredly
[46:32] that the original church at Pentecost
[46:35] with the power of God Mark 16 AC is the
[46:38] true
[46:39] church that Jesus claim as his own all
[46:43] else is false it has to be take that in
[46:47] the message all else is
[46:50] false glory to God Mark 16 is action hey
[46:55] true church

[46:59] that with Mysteries fight that with all
[47:02] kind of Cu Revelation fight that the
[47:04] true church with the power of God s Mark
[47:07] 16 in action is the true church all else
[47:10] is all else is all else is oh give the
[47:15] Lord some Praises it has to
[47:18] be here we go you a finished yet now
[47:21] remember this Christ in the true church
[47:24] is a continuation of the book of Acts

[47:33] and the bride in this last day going to
[47:35] write another book of Acts if that

[49:04] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[49:07] knows here we go here we go he knows
[49:09] that if the people get the true
[49:12] revelation of the true church what she
[49:15] is what she stands for that she can do
[49:18] the Greater Works as she will be an
[49:20] invincible Army if they get a true
[49:22] revelation of the two spirits will came

[50:14] the seed of God is the Holy Spirit the
[50:17] Bible said so every place in the
[50:18] scripture speaks of it it's the mark of
[50:21] God the Seal of God and all that did not
[50:25] Happ was the one who rejected and how
[50:28] did he reject it by refusing to hear it
[50:31] there's a big one here
[50:33] now they want to hear other things the
[50:35] Bible talk about having having itching
[50:39] ears keeping themselves teachers they
[50:41] want Holy Ghost know because Holy Ghost
[50:43] will change you give me the old time

[58:15] now this part is
[58:18] scary I heard our dear brother Pastor
[58:21] Neville made a remark on his television
[58:25] or Radio cast the other
[58:27] morning that just went over and over in
[58:30] my mind I just can't forget it I quoted
[58:34] to a friend of mine last night and that
[58:37] was
[58:38] this after the taken away of the Holy
[58:43] Spirit out of the
[58:44] Earth the formal Church religion will go
[58:47] right on not knowing the
[58:50] difference have you heard that that was
[58:53] astounding
[58:55] yeah they didn't know the holy
[58:59] spirit so they won't know when it is
[59:04] gone my God this is Aon we talking about
[59:07] any
[59:16] message they'll just be going right on
[59:18] just the same
[59:21] prophecy when the last one is sealed
[59:26] into the body of
[59:27] Christ not give him a book or
[59:31] tape or give him a tablet to reading
[59:33] message and believe not
[59:35] that when the last one is
[59:38] sealed into the body of Christ they will
[59:41] still be going on trying to bring
[59:44] converts to it because they don't know
[59:46] what it
[59:51] is and their former religions will
[59:53] continue to just like they were now it
[59:57] may not sink into you like it did to me
[59:59] where speaks but that was really an
[1:00:01] Aston statement they' be so far away
[1:00:05] just in religious
[1:00:07] rituals until they will not miss the
[1:00:11] holy spirit because they don't know what
[1:00:15] it is to begin
[1:00:16] with it have men who walk on to this
[1:00:19] message after 30 years preaching this
[1:00:21] message they never had the Holy Ghost
[1:00:24] they never had a
[1:00:26] revelation time unfold for they to walk
[1:00:29] out oh give the Lord a shout you hear
[1:00:32] you hear
[1:00:37] that then Baron said God have mercy on
[1:00:40] us let alone his absent I don't want to
[1:00:44] be here when he's not here I want to be
[1:00:47] gone then for there will be no blood on
[1:00:49] the mercy seat it'll be dark and Smoky
[1:00:52] and black the sanctuary will have no
[1:00:54] lawyer there to plead our case at that
[1:00:56] time you know the scriptures say the
[1:00:58] sanctuary was smoking there was no mercy
[1:01:00] in Blood and mercy is Judgment what we
[1:01:03] need in America is a changing of the
[1:01:05] Holy Spirit to take the place of some of
[1:01:07] our religious
[1:01:08] rituals
[1:01:11] Hallelujah my God then he said this
[1:01:14] later on in a bunch of little so-called
[1:01:18] Holy Rollers one
[1:01:20] night I found what I wanted Hall that
[1:01:23] money could not by in a bunch of
[1:01:26] illiterate uneducated poorly dressed

[1:01:36] floor on the floor on the floor let it

[1:01:44] price a jewel when that old looked
[1:01:48] in my face and said have you received
[1:01:51] the Holy Ghost since you believed was
[1:01:54] something that I wanted I didn't expect
[1:01:57] to find it among these people but they
[1:01:59] had what I needed oh give the Lord a
[1:02:02] praise oh that Holy Ghost is something
[1:02:05] oh glory to God
[1:02:08] Hallelujah the UN today they wouldn't
[1:02:10] accept what we got but that's what they
[1:02:13] need kushev all the rest of them need
[1:02:16] Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] it will change your disposition it will
[1:02:22] make men who they hate become others it
[1:02:25] will take greed away and Malice and
[1:02:28] strife and put love and joy and peace
[1:02:31] goodness and mercy yes in the unexpected
[1:02:34] Place sometimes is where you find what
[1:02:37] you are looking for that is from without
[1:02:39] with without money or without price oh

[1:02:53] Jesus
[1:02:56] Hallelujah the people ask for a
[1:03:00] king they want is to be like the other
[1:03:03] nations and God told Samuel they have
[1:03:06] not rejected you they rejected me that
[1:03:10] is Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 8 Samuel
[1:03:15] 10 verse one says then Samuel took a
[1:03:17] vial of oil poured upon his head and
[1:03:20] kissed him talking about sa is it not
[1:03:23] because the Lord had anointed thee to be
[1:03:26] Captain over his
[1:03:29] inheritance praise the
[1:03:31] Lord and Samuel begin to speak to Saul
[1:03:36] and after Thou shalt come to the hill of
[1:03:38] God where is the Garrison of the
[1:03:40] Philistines it shall come to pass that
[1:03:42] when thou had come to to the city thou
[1:03:44] shall meet a company of prophets coming
[1:03:46] down from the high place with a sultry
[1:03:48] the Tabet pipe pop before them and they
[1:03:51] shall
[1:03:52] prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will
[1:03:54] come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy
[1:03:57] with them and shall be turned into
[1:04:00] another
[1:04:02] man Hallelujah this is the spirit of God
[1:04:07] this is God this is Samuel the prophet
[1:04:09] proph sign over Saul what going to take
[1:04:13] place and let it be when these signs are
[1:04:15] come unto thee that thou do as occasion
[1:04:18] serve thee for God is with
[1:04:21] thee and thou shalt go down before me to
[1:04:25] gigal and
[1:04:26] behold I will come down unto thee to
[1:04:30] offer burnt
[1:04:32] offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of
[1:04:35] Peace
[1:04:36] offerings seven days shall thou carry
[1:04:40] till I come to thee and show thee what
[1:04:44] Thou shalt
[1:04:46] do oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:50] amen hallelujah can we give the Lord
[1:04:51] some
[1:04:53] praises
[1:05:00] strict instructions wait seven days I
[1:05:03] will come and offer sacrifices and so on
[1:05:07] 1 Samuel 13:5 and the Philistines gather
[1:05:09] themselves together to fight with Israel
[1:05:11] 30,000 chariots 6,000 Horsemen people as
[1:05:15] the sandwiches on the seashore in
[1:05:18] multitude and they came up and pitch in
[1:05:20] mismash Eastward from Beth and when the
[1:05:23] man of Israel saw that they were in a
[1:05:25] straight for the people were distressed
[1:05:28] then the people did hide themselves in
[1:05:29] caves and in tickets and in rocks and in
[1:05:31] high places and pits and some of the
[1:05:33] Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of
[1:05:35] GAD and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in
[1:05:38] gigar and all the people followed him
[1:05:40] trembling and he tarried seven days
[1:05:43] according to the set time that Samuel
[1:05:45] had appointed but Samuel came not to
[1:05:48] gigar and the people were scattered from
[1:05:50] him and Saul said bring hither a a burnt
[1:05:54] offering to me peace offering and he
[1:05:57] offered the burnt offering and it came
[1:06:00] to pass that as soon as he had made an
[1:06:02] end of the offering and the burnt
[1:06:03] offering behold Samuel
[1:06:06] came and Saul went out to meet him that
[1:06:09] he might salute him and Samuel said what
[1:06:12] hast thou
[1:06:14] done and sa said
[1:06:16] because I always have a reason you know
[1:06:19] because I saw that the people were
[1:06:21] scattered from me and that thou camest
[1:06:22] not within the days of appointed and
[1:06:25] that the Philistines gather themselves
[1:06:26] together at MM therefore said I the
[1:06:30] Philistines will come down now upon me
[1:06:32] to gigal and I have not made
[1:06:35] supplication unto the Lord I forced
[1:06:38] myself
[1:06:40] therefore and offered burnt
[1:06:43] offering and Samuel said to Saul thou
[1:06:45] has done
[1:06:47] foolishly thou was not kept the
[1:06:49] Commandment of the Lord thy God which he
[1:06:51] commanded thee for now would the Lord
[1:06:53] have esta thy kingdom upon Israel
[1:06:55] forever but now thy kingdom shall not
[1:06:58] continue the Lord has sought him a man
[1:07:02] after his own heart and the Lord had
[1:07:04] commanded him to be Captain over his
[1:07:06] people because th has not kept that
[1:07:09] which the Lord had commanded
[1:07:15] the brother
[1:07:18] Brown we find out when this man saw the
[1:07:21] first thing you know he got
[1:07:22] great then stuck out his chest we built
[1:07:27] this big thing we done this when he done
[1:07:29] it when he got to a place he didn't want
[1:07:32] Samuel's advice
[1:07:34] anymore they don't want the prophetic
[1:07:36] word no more because they getting their
[1:07:38] own thing
[1:07:40] now he done it the way he wanted to do
[1:07:43] it that's what happened today the people
[1:07:47] has got to a place that they don't want
[1:07:49] to do it the way God wants to do it am
[1:07:52] amen they want to do it the way they
[1:07:55] want to do it and that is what's the
[1:07:57] matter today God wants Divine Healing
[1:08:00] among his people the big high fellow say
[1:08:02] wait a minute days of Miracles pass now
[1:08:05] what caused Saul to do that when he got
[1:08:08] to a place that L it blow my mind when I
[1:08:12] was studying this when he got to a place
[1:08:15] that he took over the leading of the
[1:08:17] people instead of letting the Holy
[1:08:20] Spirit that's it now Samuel told him
[1:08:23] said now if you go ahead and have your
[1:08:26] king and all live right and keep God's
[1:08:28] commandment and do what the Lord says
[1:08:29] and follow the spirit Saul will be able
[1:08:32] to preach us some great Mighty
[1:08:34] messages they had no right to disbelieve
[1:08:37] Samuel because Samuel always prophesied
[1:08:39] the truth to them he told them what was
[1:08:40] truth now if you just let Saul and all
[1:08:43] of you follow the leading of the spirit
[1:08:45] keep the Commandments of the Lord
[1:08:47] everything will be all right amen but B
[1:08:49] says if every preacher of all
[1:08:50] denominations would just follow the
[1:08:52] leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:54] instead of some Creed oration that's why
[1:08:57] I hate when I see men trying to control
[1:08:59] other men or other churches you said N I
[1:09:02] am at war with Nan
[1:09:07] spirit because God hates
[1:09:11] that he hates controlling the lady am by
[1:09:15] Spirit of man he hates that amen all
[1:09:18] right so watch the following instead of
[1:09:21] Holy Spirit watch instead of some
[1:09:23] denomination what some Bishop said
[1:09:25] somebody else said somebody else said
[1:09:27] what somebody else said has nothing to
[1:09:29] do with it I'm reading God sent the Holy
[1:09:34] Spirit and he is our guide he is our
[1:09:38] leader not jille or any place else the
[1:09:42] holy spirit is our leader the holy
[1:09:44] spirit is our guide and when they even
[1:09:47] see the Holy Spirit moving they get
[1:09:49] scared of it they don't know what it is
[1:09:53] it's it's a stranger to them because
[1:09:55] they are not taught in that
[1:09:59] line they have been taught away from the
[1:10:02] Holy Spirit they are taught just certain
[1:10:04] things that the church believes go right
[1:10:06] on like that go through life Call of
[1:10:07] Christians and one like that I said to a
[1:10:10] man long ago sir didn't the Lord ever
[1:10:12] condemn you for that smoking he said oh
[1:10:13] no he said no I said I've seen you drink
[1:10:16] myself but look preach I want to tell
[1:10:18] you my faith saves me I said but Mister
[1:10:21] let me tell you something faith without
[1:10:22] works is dead amen I said the Holy
[1:10:24] Spirit don't live like that I said you
[1:10:26] may be disappointed I said now Faith is
[1:10:28] all right but if Works don't follow
[1:10:30] faith faith is no good and when you die
[1:10:33] remember it doesn't change your spirit
[1:10:36] it only changes your Dwelling Place
[1:10:38] whatever type of spirit you got in you
[1:10:40] that's the place you will go and sin can
[1:10:43] never enter into
[1:10:47] heaven I wonder if the message will
[1:10:49] understand
[1:10:51] that he said confess M every night yes
[1:10:55] you said God forgive me for drinking
[1:10:56] forgive me for commit adultery forgive
[1:10:58] me for lying forgive me for Ste turn
[1:10:59] right back and do the same thing forgive
[1:11:00] me he said he said well that shows
[1:11:03] something hasn't changed inside am
[1:11:05] you're trying to paint the outside kind
[1:11:06] of white wash it what it needs to be
[1:11:08] done is to put the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] and washed white instead of whitewashed
[1:11:12] Amen all right let's continue now he
[1:11:13] said we find out then because Saul here
[1:11:17] we go this is deep took upon himself
[1:11:20] Samuel was a little late one day to
[1:11:22] offer the burnt offering
[1:11:24] which was the only legal for him to do
[1:11:26] Under the inspiration of God yes sir and
[1:11:28] Saul said why do we have to wait for him
[1:11:31] he went and offered
[1:11:33] himself he started Leading the People
[1:11:38] himself instead of letting God lead the
[1:11:41] people there is where he made his
[1:11:45] mistake that is where every church that
[1:11:48] ever organized made their fatal mistake
[1:11:50] sir I have took history from pre seen
[1:11:53] fathers Josephus all the early
[1:11:55] historians I've never seen one time
[1:11:57] where a church ever come into a great
[1:11:59] spiritual Revival fell and got away from
[1:12:01] it ever rose again I want to show you
[1:12:04] where it's at if they won't follow the
[1:12:07] light God will lay it right on a shelf
[1:12:10] let somebody else God able to raise up
[1:12:12] stones to rise children of
[1:12:15] Israel you want to be like the world
[1:12:18] don't be like the world we are different
[1:12:20] Servants of God are different they are
[1:12:22] born different they are new in Christ
[1:12:24] watch this part now the Christian robe
[1:12:27] is not made up of church made theology
[1:12:29] the Christian robe is made up of the
[1:12:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen nothing
[1:12:34] less than that and a life that followed
[1:12:37] that baptism Holy Ghost makes you live
[1:12:39] right do right act right talk right live
[1:12:43] right are we in the word
[1:12:48] tonight now when
[1:12:50] Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more
[1:12:54] Samuel turned right away from him
[1:12:56] remember the first time not the second
[1:12:58] time but the first time that Saul took
[1:13:00] upon himself to take over the service of
[1:13:02] the Lord Samuel turned his back on him
[1:13:05] and walked away from him and the first
[1:13:07] time that the church lets their leader
[1:13:09] take over to lead the people the Holy
[1:13:11] Spirit gets right away from him he the
[1:13:13] bomb now and the very first time that
[1:13:17] you go being led by a man instead of God
[1:13:21] the holy spirit will get away from you
[1:13:23] too
[1:13:24] so first the leadership get broken at
[1:13:26] the top and then it goes down to the
[1:13:30] people did you get that yeah listen to
[1:13:33] this the first time that the church let
[1:13:37] their leaders take over to lead the
[1:13:39] people the Holy Spirit gets away from
[1:13:43] them in the
[1:13:45] message we finished yet know it'd have
[1:13:48] more things to trouble you tonight you
[1:13:51] know and the very first time that you
[1:13:54] get being led by a man instead of God
[1:13:56] the holy spirit will get from you so in
[1:13:57] other words the pastor lost the Holy
[1:14:00] Spirit and the people lost their holy
[1:14:02] spirit amen because they've been led by
[1:14:04] a
[1:14:05] man so it have to first come to the
[1:14:08] ministry the change have to come at the
[1:14:11] top yes sir not the minister gets off
[1:14:14] when the people and then the people gets
[1:14:15] off from being led of the Lord then he
[1:14:18] said let the Holy Spirit lead that's
[1:14:20] what we need is leadership and God give
[1:14:22] us a leader but we don't want to hear it
[1:14:25] and the same holy ghost that fell on the
[1:14:27] Pentecost which we all know was the
[1:14:29] birth of the new church if that same
[1:14:31] Holy Ghost don't bring the same
[1:14:33] experience to you then you got a
[1:14:34] different Holy Spirit than what was it
[1:14:37] will make you live a sacrificial life a
[1:14:39] life full of joy pleasure and the
[1:14:41] baptism of the spirit leading you into
[1:14:43] sign one Miracles and things something
[1:14:45] happened watch we find out Saul said I
[1:14:48] will do it myself I know how to do it I
[1:14:52] know about it much as Old fogy
[1:14:55] Samuel Samuel had proved that he was a
[1:14:59] servant of God he proved that the Holy
[1:15:02] Spirit was with him and I he said I'll
[1:15:04] take you to record this day have I ever
[1:15:06] spoken to you anything in the name of
[1:15:08] the Lord but what come to pass have I
[1:15:09] ever beg and bum money from you and all
[1:15:12] these things they said no you haven't
[1:15:13] done that but we want to have it the way
[1:15:16] we want
[1:15:18] it we find out then here we
[1:15:21] go when a man
[1:15:25] rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:28] you know what God did for Saul he gave
[1:15:31] him an evil spirit to lead
[1:15:36] him so the churches are still being led
[1:15:38] you
[1:15:39] know but not by the Holy Spirit am by a
[1:15:43] evil spirit quoting word and preaching
[1:15:48] word now how about that he give him an
[1:15:50] evil spirit God give him an evil spirit
[1:15:52] to lead him so when a man rejects the
[1:15:56] leading of the Holy Spirit or any person
[1:15:59] rejects the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:02] you got a devil on you to lead you
[1:16:05] that's exactly
[1:16:07] Bible don't expect to have much Amen on
[1:16:10] that but this is still the
[1:16:13] word you say I can't compar with this
[1:16:15] meeting because my church what
[1:16:16] difference does that make what that's
[1:16:18] got to do with it I tell you they
[1:16:20] believe in this and we don't believe in
[1:16:21] that as long as they preaching the Bible
[1:16:24] the whole Bible and the Full Gospel
[1:16:27] Nothing But The Truth Listen to it amen
[1:16:29] as long as they led by the spirit
[1:16:32] believe in it let's go if a man is led
[1:16:35] by the spirit of God God will make
[1:16:38] himself known to that person God
[1:16:40] promised to so in doing so the Holy
[1:16:44] Spirit leads people and God takes care
[1:16:46] of it then I'd like to say some another
[1:16:49] thing that evil spirit begin to lead
[1:16:52] Saul
[1:16:53] and it led him and today when the Holy
[1:16:57] Spirit is
[1:16:58] rejected what will it do you will get an
[1:17:01] evil spirit to lead you now I know this
[1:17:04] is a tough call for people to understand
[1:17:06] and believe they will cannot believe
[1:17:08] that their minister is led by the
[1:17:10] devil but we read that last
[1:17:13] Wednesday that the enticing Spirit come
[1:17:16] among men ministers and make them say
[1:17:19] things and do things that are contrary
[1:17:21] to the word of God that's why you need
[1:17:23] the guide which is the holy ghost that
[1:17:25] came with the spirit of truth from the
[1:17:27] prophet you need to stay what and see
[1:17:29] what the prophet said Oh Glory to God
[1:17:32] it's so easy to deviate from the word
[1:17:35] hallelujah hallelujah now listen but
[1:17:39] speaks I don't want to hurt you I want
[1:17:42] to get you to get
[1:17:44] this just as it was in them days so it
[1:17:48] is today they don't want the Holy Spirit
[1:17:52] to to lead them same thing with young
[1:17:55] people sometime you give them advice you
[1:17:57] tell them you speak to them they don't
[1:17:59] want to hear it we some sometime ago
[1:18:01] talk people don't want to go to God
[1:18:03] because they don't want God to tell them
[1:18:04] no son get ready to go they don't want
[1:18:08] the ho Spirit to lead them so they get
[1:18:09] an evil spirit what takes place with an
[1:18:12] evil spirit the evil spirit wants to
[1:18:15] lead it wants to lead them then and now
[1:18:18] what they don't want they didn't want
[1:18:19] God to be their judge and people today
[1:18:22] don't want the whole Spirit to judge
[1:18:23] them that's the reason to turn on Samuel
[1:18:26] because his judgment was of God it was
[1:18:28] scriptural watch they don't want to be
[1:18:30] led by the spirit for as many as are led
[1:18:34] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[1:18:39] of God they don't want led by the spirit
[1:18:41] they tur it down for ecclesiastical man
[1:18:43] what did they get a evil spirit to lead
[1:18:46] them people today don't want to be led
[1:18:50] by the Holy Spirit they don't want the
[1:18:52] Holy Spirit to judge them that's true
[1:18:53] friends they don't want the Holy Spirit
[1:18:56] to judge them no they don't want the
[1:18:58] spirit to judge them if you get the Holy
[1:18:59] Ghost and you come to me and tell me you
[1:19:01] got the Holy Ghost and living like that
[1:19:02] I can't be a judge but according to the
[1:19:03] word you missed the line somewhere we
[1:19:06] need back to get back to Holiness we
[1:19:08] need to get back to God but they reject
[1:19:11] it certainly they do now they don't want
[1:19:13] the real true gospel they don't want the
[1:19:16] real truth they don't want the holy
[1:19:18] spirit to guide them they rather have an
[1:19:20] intellectual Pastor amen now what did
[1:19:23] Saul do here what here we go now almost
[1:19:26] there he certainly made a great Army
[1:19:29] let's find out Saul's accomplishment he
[1:19:31] certainly did he brought Israel to a
[1:19:33] great Army he made them all with fine
[1:19:35] polish Spears he trained them with
[1:19:37] Spears to fight like GRE Gallant men in
[1:19:39] other words he had the deacons he had
[1:19:41] the ushers he had everybody in order he
[1:19:43] made them all big shields and everything

[1:19:48] along fine the rest of the nation looked
[1:19:51] out you know Israel coming along PR

[1:20:00] Challenger by the name of Goliad folded
[1:20:03] his arms and Israel shook till their

[1:20:12] there he stood he never seen such a
[1:20:14] thing the spirit had to take over the
