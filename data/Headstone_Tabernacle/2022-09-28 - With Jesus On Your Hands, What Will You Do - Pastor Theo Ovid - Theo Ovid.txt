Matthew chapter 27 we want to read from verse 11 to 28. it's good to be here tonight it's a reading from Luke chapter 14 reading verse 16. then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and beat many sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that will didn't come for all things are not ready they all would want us consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground I must needs go and see it I pray they have an excuse another said I have bought five Ox yoke of oxen I go to prove them I pray thee have me excuse not I said I've married a wife like if I can come so that seven came showed us Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said unto his servant go out quickly into the streets Lanes of the city bringing hither the poor the meme the halt the blind the seven said Lord it is done was commanded and yet David's room and the Lord said unto that servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled if I say unto you that none of those men which were bitten taste of my supper the next a translation of that or next scripture the same thing he said they were not worthy a reading from Matthew chapter 27 reading verse 11. and Jesus stood before the governor and asked him saying and the governor asked him saying a thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him downstairs when he was accused of the chief priest and Elders he answered nothing and said piloted to him here is thou not how many things do you witness against him he answered them never would and so much that the governor marveled greatly now that that Feast the governor was one to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will you that I release unto you rob us or Jesus which is called Christ for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him and when he was sat down on the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priest and the eldest persuaded the multitude that they should ask about Barabbas and Destroy Jesus the governor answered and said unto them wither of the twin will he that I release unto you they said Barabbas the parrots said unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ this all said unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil had he done but they cried all the more saying let him be crucified and when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but that rather a too much was made he took water wash his hands before the multitude scene I'm innocent of the blood of this just person see you to it then the answered all the people and said his blood be on us and our children then release he Barabbas unto them and when he had scored Jesus he delivered him to be crucified than the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and got unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet robe let's pray father we read your word tonight and I pray that your spiritual take and ride your word into the hearts and lives of your children in Jesus might ask amen God bless you you may be seated a what shall I do I was thinking about titling this message that we what shall I do but I put with Jesus on Your Hands what will you do and it's what will I do what will we do as individuals with Jesus on Your Hands what will you do what will you do oh let's go we see what the Lord will do tonight I won't appreciate brother Anthony's National profit service on Sunday what a message I was a masterpiece of a message I so was so blessed I told but Anthony that was the greatest message he didn't preached it was so solid it was so full of stuff in it it was inspirational to see how he has grown and his ministry is growing and I'm happy for him I really thank God for him tonight amen God has blessed us with some fine gifts Fine Brothers amen praise the Lord God bless you brother Anthony certainly love and appreciate you put a brown what we need today is an inspiration over us God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us and to weaken us to his word and then the word here we go being brought into that Spirit of inspiration then you will see miracles happen and things take place because the two just come together let me read it again what we need today is an inspiration over us the issue is not the books and the tips and the Bible and the word and they're not the issue you know this year is the issue the inspiration to come over us God's sweeping down who's sweeping down I thought a minister bringing something no God's sweeping down with a new inspiration breeding over us his power his love himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us and waking us up this word sometimes I preach about the spirit equipment if they take the spirit to quickness isn't that right and he said no so that's one part then the word now being brought into that Spirit of inspiration oh so that means the word could be brought without that Spirit of inspiration correct but when the word is brought into the speed of inspiration then you will see miracles happen and things take place because the two just comes together because they give the laws on praises amen when that last struggle of our life comes and death rattles are in our truth we still must Hold Steady and remember that God said I'll raise you up again in the last days that must be our testimony our place in Christ our position what we are knowing that we have kept every word of his Commandments blessing a day to do his Commandments that they have the right to enter in see when we know that no matter what anyone has said we have kept every Commandment that we see in the Bible with reverence and love and respect to the Creator who wrote the Bible you see God in all his wisdom and omnipotence he wrote the Bible true men there is no mistakes there's no errors because he know every word will be written every road to be spoken men have all moved by the spirit depend those words and we can rest our souls on the Eternal Word of God even Jesus himself found himself resting on the word he said destroy this body and Jesus I raise up myself because he knew what David said and Daniel saw my books what Jeremiah said they looked at each other because it was the word coming from God and course enough Vindicated last day Prophet people lie on him and say what kind of thing about him but that doesn't change who he is and doesn't change who we we are and they will see for themselves when they see our hearts turn back literally back to the faith of the fathers all who says they are liars and understand that they are lying we will vindicate Malachi for we will send me King what God have said this last day we will prove this message it's not a hoax it's not a fake it is real it is to say the Lord or could we get a lot of shout I became the host the whole of Hell come against it it still can't change it Jesus said my whole glory to God he said heaven will pass away but my word will never pass away oh is it worth the Eternal thoughts of God isn't that right you receive man wrote it man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote it you see God rooted through men like a prophet speaks his word is not the prophet's word it is God's word to that prophet and that's the reason has come it has to come to pass it is truly the truth we see this great man and remember job now had no bible to read in this day he only went by inspiration he was a prophet to whom the word of the Lord comes to he had only to be inspired because he knowed his position that he was God's Prophet the only thing that had to happen was for the inspiration to strike him and then he knowed what he said would happen because it was by inspiration and that's the church so he's talking about Joe being in a channel knowing his position just waiting for inspiration knowing that what he said by inspiration will come to pass then he said that's the church watch watch if it's in order set an order so there's a prophecy hanging over the church to be set in order all the cuckoo all the mistakes all the gaps all the things that lead to be placed correctly it could be set in order because a prophecy for concerning that that is why they choose Matthias because Judas fell and they bring it at number 11 but they had to get number 12. so that's why they had to get my tasks in position before when the day of Pentecost was fully come so before Dynamics struck the hard was to select Matas in that position to have a 12th man oh Chloe they've got to set the church in order before the Fire Fall so God have to set the church in order from the pulpit to the back bench the entire church has to be set in order it has to start somewhere and tonight it starts with your heart or give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God and that's the church if it's set in order it's only got the mechanics ready it's got the mechanics ready it only needs then the Dynamics tonight here we go tonight if we'll get the mechanics ready and then he begin to bring in the mechanics praise God get our hearts right the things that we can do the things that we can do the things that we can do there are some things you got to do your glory to God God can't do it for you go glory to God God can repent for you God can press for you God can't pray for you the things that you can do what shall I do with this Jesus called the Christ because when Christ come in your hands there's something for you to do oh glory to God hallelujah you can't escape it you can't wash your hands and say I have nothing to do with this you have to do something with it oh God you can't make excuses because when this word comes and bring me invitation to this glorious wedding supper Oh Glory what shall I do with this invite tonight stay as I am or be transformed stay as you were or be transformed oh blessed be the name of the Lord so tonight if we will get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow them in baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for the Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's the challenge of the hour man could do so much and no more that's why he said if you could only get started God will do the rest but we have to got to get started the things that we can do there is something for you to do tonight oh give the Lord some Praises not to sit and stare and then hear hear hear praise God press and play and hear no we have to have more than that you have to act upon what you have heard or could somebody say Amen praise God praise God watch then we are ready for the Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's to drop into your heart to feed that say I am now healed praise God then don't make any difference what circumstances is you're here anyhow causes feet by your heel let's do this important statement now he job had a Channel of communication to God that he got by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting God move in and he knew he was justified it was a gift it was a gift for the people not for job but for the people all Divine gifts are to serve God's people with or could he give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God and in every age they made excuses manners always make try to make excuses but to receive not to receive God's word of his invitation though it is firmly proven to them and it says supper his invitation but man is constantly making excuses now watch when God gives a man an invitation to do something to do something to receive the invitation that's given to him and he turns it down there's nothing left after Mercy is spoon but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy there's only one thing left that's judgment it happened every age of the Bible when God shall know his silver made a way of Escape for all the people who wanted to be saved but the people need laughing at Noah but God made a way but they had an excuse it wasn't a quality than modern thinking they make excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses on this Elijah the middle exclusional day of Christ they make excuses today stop making excuses let's kill excuses let's get the job done praise God we don't want to hear your story we want to get the job done praise God stop making excuses to justify your position to justify your attitude to justify why you are how you are you have to be you have to despise all you are in that sense you have to say like you I hate myself oh glory to God I can do better than this I can live higher than this I could press better than this Oh Glory to God you don't have to say mediocre you can press for excellence oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah they made excuses I know what Moses they made excuses is Elijah they made their scrutiness of Christ and they are making excuses today isn't that right he came to Israel It Was Bitten to come to the feast and they won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord if Israel two thousand years ago would have accepted I've accepted the invitation they would they were given they wouldn't be as they are today two thousand years ago Israel turned on the invitation to come to the wedding supper they turned it on and went to the judgment and Jesus said they stoned and killed the prophets that was sent to them by making excuses and there's excuses they're making each day we find out praise God and every day they're making excuses Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah give him some praises hallelujah praise God praise God so what's your excuse tonight Oh Glory to God what's your excuse tonight glory to God hallelujah praise God and when they came they brought Jesus they were so convinced they saw against Jesus the word made manifest they said may his blood be upon us and our children they were so convinced they take the blood of Jesus they may be upon us and our children that were convinced they were right but they were wrong oh praise the name of the Lord Jesus was trying to tell them that their excuses what killed the prophets what killed the righteous they accepted the Creeds that men has given them instead of taking the word of God and today instead of people take what the prophet said thus say the Lord say where the tape say they are accepting what men interpret some Angel tell them some voice tell them some Spirit tell them some dream tell them they're taking everything else but what the prophet said and what the Bible said because what the prophet said and the Bible said have to be the same thing because the prophet the spirit the Bible and the bride will say the same thing oh give the Lord a praise offering Oh Glory to God Jesus told him if he had known Moses foreign Fire and Fire Oh Glory to God know that I speak it Oh Glory to God it got to come to pass hallelujah hallelujah praise God there's something the Creeds that men had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so here we go they made the word of non-effect non-effect same word non-effect making a whole meal cooking their own food and like salt they sprinkle the profiting on top of it the prophet didn't bring salt he didn't make flavoring his whole seven course menu Oh Glory to God all seven seasons in open they can't take it and preach their own thing and they sprinkle salt like they put in pepper and salt and seasonally message we have one of seasoning we want a real thing oh give the Lord a shout in her house praise God I sign up for no seasoning praise God of this message on top of men's thoughts and ideas Oh Glory to God God sent a prophet that I could hear Dusty of The Lord Oh Glory to God Amen do you believe that tonight what you eat us got to say is this is God's Will and God see Zaya or Israel it is something else you can come up with that is better than this you have to take one or the other you can't take God and serve God and Mammon you have got to say this is the truth or this is part of the truth or it isn't all the truth or us isn't put together right or it isn't interpreted right did you hear that he said you have to say it's the truth or it's not the truth you got to say this is part of the truth it is not the truth it doesn't put together right or isn't interpreted right but the Bible said that the word of God is of no private interpretation no private interpretation well the way I seen it shut your mouth I don't want to hear away you've seen it what did God say Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house the word of God has no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it is written just the way God wanted interpreted just what it says that's what it's supposed to be just take it the way it said it it is wrote down here but they accepted the Creeds and they make God promises of no effect to them they bypass that and they skip away from that and the prophecy concerning the bright Revival written there's the bride had no Revival yet no manifestation of God to steal the bride it will take them seven Thunders to wake her up again he said if the church will forget the equation dogmas and plead their promises then it will become effective to them Prince there's all content we can preach tonight but there are some promises inside I hear that if we can pleading promises the very first thing I'll give you was a promise the inspiration to come over I'm getting the channel of the inspiration and let the world come in the channel of inspiration and go see Miracles all of his promises oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God protect the Creeds forget your dogmas and plea your promises glory to God the darkness and your mind the quiz of your own ideas the crease of your own thoughts forget that and take what God Said tonight God can't lie oh give the Lord some Praises we have the Assurance tonight that the God we serve can't lie oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that amen here we go if Russia had accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia that same Russia you're talking about all them bombs and nuclear bombs Holy Ghost fell on them give the Lord a shout we are talking about evangelists and prophet and past and teacher you know Holy Ghost fell in Russia they wouldn't have been a communist today now 75 years ago they had a great Revival in Russia God come among them they had great revivals way into Siberia what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone the churches can't have church only under permission they are doomed in the Judgment has gone over to the wild tangent of Communism solo to the devil so the rejection of the Holy was in Russia brought the Communist spirit upon them they can help it they are inspired they anointed and we have to come to the place where we can't help it we are inspired and we anointed by the holy ghost that Russia rejected that the world rejected that the church had rejected that denomination rejected we have to be anointed and inspired by the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that fell under their Pentecost the same holy ghost that Paul had the same holy ghost that Peter had the same Olivers that the richest had together 50 years ago Holy Ghost fell in England just after that come George Jeffries FF Bosworth Charles price Smith Wiggles Wiggles Smith wiggle swords those great rise of the Fate 50 years ago and offered England the Holy Ghost Revival what did they do they laugh at them put them in jail call them crazy thought they'd lost their minds the churches refused the people to come to hear them they healed the sick the castle Devil's done great works and because England as a nation rejected the gospel her sins is no true to all the world the holidays are more Apostles nation in all the world even including Roman France than England she's the mother of apostasy right by Finney and many of the Great Men preached thinning and Wesleyan they turn it down and tonight the reason this nation is doomed there's no hope for it at all she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy talk about America she's elected what she has there to control the nation she's rotten to the core of politics is rotten morals and Nations alone or anything I can think of and I really the system is written under the morals she becomes in doing this she now join us with all these churches and the Nations to the Federation of churches and has taken the mark of the peace what a thing why Christ gives them the opportunity come to my face and there's a bomb to me the Feast of Pentecost or give the Lord a shout come to what feast the Feast of Pentecost same Holy Ghost Fire same holy ghost power that is why God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and the feet of fathers dropped down under the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one man and one Accord and suddenly there was a song from Heaven not where the sun come from Russian Mighty Wind fellow all the house where they would settled nobody had to preach to them and teach them anything they will fill with the Holy Ghost that's the words that the Bible said and they stand out like drunk men Oh Glory the God bring back that bring back that same Holy Ghost bring by that same wind the wind is blowing again just as the day of Pentecost Oh Glory to God the Holy Ghost is moving again the fire is falling again just as it was under the appendicos oh god with a God hallelujah we're gonna have a real Revival Holy Ghost Revival demon Chase and Revival hell crossing the Rival or give the Lord some praises the seconds will be healed the bang on the sea people are gonna walk oh God him man amen without hands being laid on them oh Hallelujah glory to God when the Holy Ghost ported on Russia they were called to a feast of Pentecost still reading spiritual Feast they turn it down England the Holy Ghost was poured upon them just turn it down America the Holy Spirit upon them they turn it down when God said the Holy Ghost and knocks on a man's door and his Liberty turn it down sometimes you want to turn off for the last time then it won't be privileged character you can sit in church and listen to the gospel because with the gospel you come and do us say I know it's right but never put a thing on it help yourself what can I do because when somebody rejected Holy Ghost for the last time there's nothing they can do you know they cross the line now when you have the opportunity when you could do something do it Hallelujah you said you said you listened to it you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I could say I believe that's ten thousand dollars that don't mean I got it I can say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you see what I mean so identifying that the message that you're away you know yeah yeah what is that like just a book you have you know I listened that tape every day three times a day what is that you're a good listener you have good ears that have nothing to do with what the prophet said yeah do you get me now yeah he said watch but to refuse to drink it you know what I mean this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and you won't have the privilege to come and receive it now watch some kind of excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some kind of by rejecting their visitation it separates you from God now notice in the Old Testament it had Jubilee and the Jubilee you could go free if there was some with excuse he could give he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the air with an all by the post in the temple and then no matter so in other words he could go free you know price paid trumpet song but you love your master Hallelujah I love what controlling you you love what they reckon you and hitting you and striking you do this do this you're lucky you're falling over the master and you have your own land you have your own family to go back to what happened Boya is isn't that right and they watch the death for slavery is over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't locked no more with Israel his possession was given to another the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel I know it's true and we reject it and refuse to do it or listen to it we take the mark of the beast Hallelujah take the mark of the beast get his bum now somebody said no there's going to be a mark of the beast is going to be come someday let me tell you it's already come you ready yeah as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to Fall the mark of the beast begin to take place did you hear that that's a prophecy you know as soon as the Holy Ghost began to fall the mark of the Big East began to take place you only have two things one of them is to accept it take the Seal of God to reject it take the mark of the beast to reject the seed of God is to take the mark of the beast so he ties it all together the seed is presented rejecting Mark taking yeah something on the credit card and some kind of number you're not looking for that you know there's a word here no this is the interpretation in the market division the seed of God comes as an offer as I invite reject that take the mark waiting to be judged so the word come as an offer a word offer and you receive it you are marked by the word to be sealed by the Holy Ghost oh give me give me a shout in the house did you get that tonight the world come to bring her offer I invite as you receive it God no you receive it tick a mark put on you to be sealed with the Seal of God by the Holy Ghost now Hallelujah that's meant which is a holy holy Eagle they'll offer by the word they are marked to be judged the Beast so let me let's say it again to reject the seed of God is to take the mark of the beast everybody understands he asks that question to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast you don't need a three-hour sermon to explain that you don't need a three-hour sermon to explain that you don't need an interpretation of some intellectual come to explain the depth of that it is very straightforward it is very simple grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption Oh Glory to God to reject the seed of God is to take the mark of the beast for the Bible said all that was not sealed with the seed of God took the mark of the beast he caught him from Revelation 13 all that problem he hurt shall worship the peace

hallelujah no longer books on people's hands now you could have hit him for years hallelujah thank you Jesus at the crucifixion Jesus on Your Hands God word has been thoroughly Vindicated proven over and over you see God has already got it laid out let the ministry study it but you see they take somebody as wood some group of men they are so blinded to the truth praise God message A bunch of men and that's the smartest man in the message indeed most talkative message the most revelated message he had a guiding ministers and direct ministers you write this script I thought God is the one writing the script how come man interfering interfering churches Jesus is suffering so that way he followed me about this because he's sovereignty of the local church no Bishop behind it spirited soul and you know these vision is no you know where by you I'm not following you have to follow who directed here let us feel like they could privatize God you know you saw the government is then privately privatize God like God yeah you know I have him here you can't privatize God is truth God is life we can show you from the scriptures how God save people who you might think would be safe like the man on the cross that old teeth the old Bandit the whole rubber who teeth stove and fridge and rub you at gunpoint hanging on the cross and say Lord remember me Oh Glory to God he said today you will be with me check that out check Mr Grace out and see oh Mr Grace is operate oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God woman caught any academies and the religious world alone and he went for humble men went for fishermen went for prostitutes and drunkers and all kind of people else or give the Lord Our Praise would he do that again oh he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and my Bible tell me the spirit and the bride say Come Oh Glory to God whosoever will say come let him the Earth is come whosoever will let him come also you mean they're gonna come over whosoever will yes nobody gonna stop whosoever will or get taught us praise offering whether they come in hot pants short pants long it doesn't matter what time they come in they come in with three men tinted here painted here it doesn't matter whosoever will come glory to God the church to church God wasn't churchy when he called you he was a ranked sinner he was in sin when God called you God didn't seemed called you when you were cleaned up he called you when he was filthy he called to justify the ungodly oh don't let me start it tonight Hallelujah all have sinned and come short of the glory but God reached Mercy Oh Glory to God God reaching Mercy oh he is here tonight to deliver to redeem to heal to save to baptize to inspire to anoint oh my Hallelujah praise God praise God oh let's continue watch the rejected the Messiah and then today is the same thing the very same thing we have been given an opportunity because God cannot judge this this blew my mind out without being justified for his judgment so God hold himself to high standard in order to judge that is going to judge Nineveh send Jonah take all our hearts chapter and everybody will never repent and God canceled the judgment and Jonah in trouble do not open because you expect God to do this and God to do that and go to that he said oh God God said well God repent are they cancel that one because you wish you all come to repentance you see if you you say if you're if a certain person you stop them and say there's a hole in the road down there if you continue that speed you'll be killed they say nonsense I know what I'm doing you see the blood can't be upon your hand because you have warned them but God does the same thing by his word he thoroughly warns the people of uncommon judgment shows his signs wonders predicted in the Bible for the age he shows them people just walk right over it it's not easy for a person to go to hell a man fights his way to Hell the first lie ever told the first wrong first cigarette ever smoke you know it was wrong the first evil your dead Universe wrong but in your conscience told it was wrong and you continue to run through the red light over the barricade this is probably going to get to remember you fight your way to hell it is not easy to go to hell you have to reject truth you're coming deep into that tonight because this is a thing I thought that I never presented that way before never see that before no beef oh okay so now that they take Barabbas right they had to accept that man Barabbas to reject Christ the offer was Barabbas or Christ which one of these two everybody knows record I mean making newspaper already the man was sentenced already didn't know his reputation he's a murderer he's a vagabond he's abandoned he's an independent Society nobody wanted and then them religious people will give us Bara Barabas and before any man a woman can accept wrong this is deep it always sees already but boy they said they have to reject right there is something about nature it got allotted you have to reject the right thing before you can receive the wrong thing so when you see people on the wrong side of this thing you recognize they reject the right thing because God kind of get you writing to the people now watch I have quoted to to keep you from telling a lie you told a lie against your better judgment you tell a lie against your conscience you told a lie against what your mother or parents taught you to do or even native self teachers you shouldn't do it so therefore you have to reject truth to accept a lie you have to reach up truth before you can accept the LIE see so then I tend this the reverse is also true you have to reject the LIE before you can accept the truth fornication unclean living must be rejected before you can accept the right way of living you can't have it both ways so the compromise Javier limbo because you have not rejected the lie or rejected that is of the word or reject this is not what God wants and you can accept God's word you're trying to bridge the gap trying to walk with two things can't work notice do you get that tonight the reverse is also true you have to reject the liar before you can accept the truth or embrace the truth or connect with the truth you have to disconnect from life [Music] pull the plug on lies pull the plug on what is not beneficial what is not edifying what is not inspiring Paul said it this way whatsoever things are lovely what some things are true whatever things are good report if there be any virtue if there may be prayers think on these things these things is this the word we're preaching tonight is this the Bible all right now the church has to turn his word down first and after the church turned it down and call him belzebub or evil spirit then it was brought to the government reject the bride the bride will be Joseph the rejected he said damn they find fault with the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through the man oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God the bride going to be rejected when the bride become manifested oh give the Lord a shout help me Jesus do you get that tonight a prophet like not true all Israel is not Israel two million people came out but two only two went in like Joshua Caleb so bright had to be identified I am right I am the irony bride and I catchphrases and stuff like foolishness I just words there's just a man talking when the bride is identified which which I'm preaching it already you have to be the word manifested to be the bride [Music] the word manifested so therefore you have a passion that's what you should have a passion to strive to become the word manifested Oh Glory to God Amen he said what they call him watch oh so let's say it again so after the church turned it down calling belzebub or an evil spirit then it was brought before the government so that the whole race had to become them what did they reject many of them wanted to believe but the Traditions not the people but the Traditions they are so undocumented with the system so the time are we going good they were so so in document with the system it isn't the person it's the system it isn't the people it's the system it wasn't the Jews it was their system so after 50 plus years of this message men have built systems systems that's where they have systems it's just describing Pharisees and services they build systems the people are locked into a system so even though they hear truth outside their system they can't accept it because they connect to their system and they love the system Oh Glory to God they love the system God sent a prophet you know you have words here you know but men pushing back the words even recently here a man say you don't need a Bible not in this message but you say you don't need the Bible and you don't need to read the Bible when you when they come to the Lord God will talk to direct a demon talking here then Lucifer agent tonight Lucifer there you know you know when GSA many foreign and guess so sometimes we come to pass I'll make the past Spirit tell them things oh help me Jesus this is wood all right so is isn't the people it's the system it isn't the Jews it's the system the system condemning because it didn't tolerate with their system and there's a difference between the mark of the beast and the ceiling of God are you ready oh here we go God seals by his word [Music] but if we stop right there be in trouble God intellectual say what's my word oh God that mystery that preached last night no not just yet not just yet all right now this is true because you say my words are spirit and life you're the prophet bring it now go on seals by his word you believe the word is but you see is that right yes sir then he called Ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed on the day of your Redemption now the holy spirit is the word hahaha oh my God I love it I love it I love it love it you see that he said God sees by his word and then he bring now green for the Holy Spirit baby I see you he said holy spirit God is Not tree he's the same God in tree dispensation three offices God the Father over the jaw God the son in Grace God the Holy Ghost as you call it the same God in the Holy Ghost dispensation God the father was the word God the son was the word and God the Holy Ghost is the word see it's just three offices and the Holy Ghost therefore seals you therefore you are sealed by the word you hear that equation when you add up all that I can put the equal sign you are sealed by the word Oh Glory the gods of us you are seen by the word and put it this way now that we're turning in the spirit inside of you and that's the kingdom inside of you behold the kingdom is within you oh Glory the God don't go low here low there go here go there go there oh glory to God do we do that tonight belong to a system and be sealed with the system Underwood so anytime somebody gets a revelation and they recognize their system there they get out because the word don't agree with system because systems are built around the world oh glory to God systems cannot be the word it's built around the world but the bride will be the word itself so when God put in your spirit the revelation of you becoming the word itself when you hear the word that you were talking about that's your name we're talking about system cabanu foreign Oh Glory to God you can't belong to a system and be sealed with the system and the word see because it's contrary one to the other you can't do it you see the machine but automobile it got Pistons valves carburetor and so forth that's the mechanics I like to say something to the church right here brings in my memory see I believe we are so close now I'm gonna say something now see the mechanics he's emphasizing there are so many people trying to explain the mechanics when you don't know it you hear me say what I hear funeral services on the other side and a lot of details I've got another problem there you know because they have never been there I don't mind your passing through you know but but but you can't go too deep you can't explain you know I mean the the pavement in the city of gold and the streets of gold have they repeat that right on this side and brown on this side you cargo there ain't gonna go in there in trouble because have you been there you cross over you get what's up from the fellas who cross on your side you get a text oh you know we're going on another side you know what they're doing what kind of foolishness is that bringing back a revelation on the other side wow all right if a Prophet come and testify like how we talk about his wife and and and his vision of his wife and someone like that because that's different but us here forget it all right I'm gonna say something there are so many people trying to explain the mechanics when you don't know it suppose somebody said Noah I want to explain the mechanics of how I flute he couldn't do it you don't have to know the mechanics I wonder how much people believe that Brother Andy you don't have to know the mechanics but the Dynamics of it I don't have to nobody driveshaft any connected the engine and and and and and and and the condenser and the plugs I'm not a mechanic all I want to know the engine tumbling and the car four wheels there no harm mechanics there no a lot of power you know just engine making noise you know is that going nowhere and you have an engine but no you want the whole car with the engine in it that people's body and wheels and things and they can still then take pictures of behind the wheel but they're not going anywhere a bicycle could pass them they have no engine inside the deer there's no power inside of there you need all together you need the whole vehicle with the engine with the battery with the power but everything's out of there when the bright start off you might be a rumble devil must get smoke in his face when we're leaving here oh glory to God when we start that Raptor Express when we cut on an engine here oh glory to God we have to at least smoke and the devil's face as we take off Glory there's going to be a meeting in the air Give the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God listen to this song Moses might have known the mechanics but it wasn't anybody else business anybody has placed to understand it but Moses he said you don't he said is it him you don't have to know the mechanics that makes it true praise the name of the Lord see they've got the mechanics the only thing they have is okay I'll skip you though he said they all have arrived that that big machine that set up there talking about the United Nations they've got the mechanics the only thing they have to get is Satan in there with the Dynamics to force the magnet of the Beast so even United Nations written Dynamics and they might have it already what kind of foolish is that nonsense the United Nations waiting on their Dynamics which is Lucifer coming in them as rain to enforce laws to put the squeeze upon the bride oh God but then can't get Dynamics first you ever see that before the devil didn't move when them demons reported back to hell that look they're staggering and they excited and sit and said I'm excited man leave them alone they're having a good time praise God Jesus done dead and gone already he's having a good time but when Peter went to they get caught beautiful and I kept my man that everybody know was there and he said sir Van Gogh Have I None structures have I give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ when them Devils went and tell Satan you know what happened a man walked by a crippled pork it's like Jesus come back again it's not one Jesus as many Jesus is or give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God that's him Jesus living in Peter living in John living in Paul living in James Give the Lord some praises then they bring the Press on them I said licks blows they beat them Hallelujah I said Don't Preach no more in Jesus name we want to see nonetheless happen again go back upstairs and make a noise but don't come and do things like that and when them fellas went back day they say Lord God who acts for now said no your power that we could go out and testify and while they were praying they were filled all over again we call it a resilient of the Holy Ghost what they had in Acts 2 they come back and get the next portion in Acts four they must get in portioned upon portions upon portion Oh Glory they refilled with the Holy Ghost went backward and bust that word fresh right open again Lord there was a liar tonight glory to God is not right let me say something I believe the pride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed into the kingdom of God all in his prophecy I believe the mechanic is here they are waiting for the Dynamics they are waiting for what they are waiting for what some man from America they're waiting for what it's a man from England no they are waiting for Dynamics oh give the Lord a shout glory to God no they're waiting for Dynamics Hallelujah that will take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture I deliver with all my heart we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it here's why here's why you ready he is the Dynamics I want to connect to him Oh Glory to God I want to know him I want to connect to him because he is a Dynamics we become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into His Image what's his image fate virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness badly kindness and love of God we have to form ourselves into His Image oh give the Lord a shout glory to God one time this building was steel and cement and gravel we had to form that into this building Oh Glory to God and parabenam brought the material of the world but the Bible said his wife had made himself ready okay the Lord I shout that means she took the clothes of the word and she dressed herself you have to form yourself make yourself a Christian okay the Lord I shout my God I could run to the church tonight Hallelujah let me see it again I feel that wood this wooded is wood being here tonight glory to God we become members of the machine of his body not a system his body how you get into his body by one Spirit we are baptized into that body so we become a member of the body isn't that right hallelujah praise God praise God forming ourselves into his image as we see him United himself with us his works and his love gifts as he hands them to us before the wedding supper we are waiting and watching for that and tonight I'm saying it with the prophet we are waiting and watching for that the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down the full deposit coming down your full inheritance coming down you're working with a down payment you're working with that you remember that with that intro oh you're working with this data until the full meal come praise God you're working with the orders you're working with the spirit in a small measure until the power come down full power in the church full word restored full power back in the church and we back to the days of the Apostles Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout it's this don't make us sin happy I don't know what will Oh Glory to God let me say the whole quote the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit so he's not talking about other judges Hallelujah the bright church when we refill on the holy spirit that we have worked worked worked what somebody said work some people don't like work but what in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body and when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost somebody Shout Out full power full power said full power full power gonna be in the church no no more power little powerful power where is the devil come on devil out he goes blind seed death here oh dead be raised up go where the Lord I shout full power back in the church oh that don't you want to see that this is something to live for whatever I'm saying I wish I could live to see it oh lord is my prayer so close full power of the Holy Ghost would raise up amen he said what he said and the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take the fight to the skies and he kept it off with the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit oh Hallelujah Dynamics Esther Holy Spirit and that would have him rejected the spirit rejected now wow mother Eve corrupted the whole earth into physical debt listen mother Eve corrupted the whole Human Race by physical death how by rejecting the word and accepting something almost like it she caused all physical debt because she left the true word and believed the true word all but just a little bit one little disagreement full word of God cause every heartache every death everything here I mean Earth Eve done the mother of death you see where we are coming the mother noticed she just released the word she said God had said Satan said that's right God I said that's right God has said that's right God has said yes that's exactly right that's what I've said but your eyes open but God has said in that that's supposed to settled the word it started with a little misconstruation of the word and the same thing it ended the same way notice a daughter is a product of mother and father by a union now here's something shocking debt physical debt is United of mother Eve and Satan together by disbelieving God's word they United and brought the product of debt debt is the product of United States and Eve together Eve had the word Satan is against the word and almost 99 and 99 hundreds of it Satan admitted was right watch so close the Bible said in the last days it will deceive the very latest possible the hope is going to be the same how it's going out the same way and this is a bomb here now uniting of unbelief in all the full word of God you got it that is what brought that is only in this message of the full word he's not talking about denomination he's not talking about Pentecostal and baptism Methodist he said uniting of unbelief with the full word produce debt so this letter killer this debting is not easy you know we're talking about spiritual debt people Concord in the pews dead in churches stoned on the way to meet up with the rest of the tribulation scenes it has no Rapture for that this is serious watch uniting of unbelief in all the full word of God you got it that is what brought debt it's United unbelief of the word unbelief just a little bitty part of it little bitty teeny bit 100 of one percent it must be 100 say 100 percent you have to receive the wood 100 percent here we go we almost done now God's daughter the church the bride is a product of God and his word United the holy spirit uniting in a body of flesh is produces Son of God It produced the righteousness of god let's get to the prophecy now but in the last days are we ready we are told as when there's a Sodom the bride will be United by the word of God made manifest in the flesh and you explain it right after the Holy Spirit sealing them into God and sealing unbelief on the outside or give the Lord a shout I hope this register with you tonight I hope there's anchor in your soul tonight you have to believe this you have to receive this you have to hear this because this is Dusty of the Lord glory to God the bride will be United Hell by the word of God made manifest In the Flesh the Holy Spirit deceiving them into God stealing unbelief on the outside God is United his bride being one him and Christ together is the spirit working in the flesh of the church like it work in the flesh of Jesus Christ the spirit the spirit working in the flesh of the church I love that because it is part of his body not twin they are one husband and wife is no longer trained but one and Christ and his body is one and the Same Spirit was in Christ is in his pride in his body and death United together with all the word god living in dear manifesting it all right notice after the promised word for the age was Vindicated to turn him down they turned him down the dead I know I'm coming to the close now as he came then clearly identify himself to be the word it come down to our Showdown where they must choose the word or take the system and the same thing today you must choose the word or take the system and they took the system what will you do tonight I'm the one's finished here here or on tape wherever you are at you're going to weak sometimes sinner and realize there's blood on your hand and the blood of the Son of God and you are guilty of murdering him your sin murdered him your unbelief in his word you're feeling disease identification grieve away the Holy Spirit what can you do but stand at the Judgment of God knowing what's going to happen to you what will I do with this Jesus called Christ pilate said nobody by now is going deeper Pilots he placed on his hands and the blood of Jesus Christ is placed again on the hands of this congregation it is based on the hands of this nation around the world where these tips have been and things have been Vindicated and proved of God watch let's look when blood is on your hands man has to watch when he's got another man's blood on his hands look at
