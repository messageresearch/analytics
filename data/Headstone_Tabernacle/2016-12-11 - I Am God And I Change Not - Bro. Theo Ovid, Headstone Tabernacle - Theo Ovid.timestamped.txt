[43:45] Peter this Second Epistle beloved I now
[43:47] write unto you in both which I stir up
[43:49] your pure Minds by way of remembrance
[43:52] that ye may be mindful of The Words
[43:54] which were spoken before by the holy
[43:56] Prophets of The Commandments of us and
[43:58] of our Apostles of our Lord Jesus Lord
[44:00] and Savior knowing this first that there
[44:03] shall come in the last days scuffers
[44:06] walking after their own lust saying
[44:08] where is the promise of his coming for
[44:10] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[44:12] continue as the were from the beginning
[44:15] of the creation for this they willingly
[44:18] are ignorant of that by the word of God
[44:22] the heavens were of old and the Earth
[44:25] standing out of the water and in the
[44:26] water
[44:27] whereby the world that then was being
[44:30] overflow with water perished but that
[44:33] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[44:36] by the same word are kept in store
[44:39] reserved unto fire against the day of
[44:42] judgment and parition of ungodly men but
[44:46] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[44:49] thing that one day with the Lord is a
[44:52] thousand years and a thousand years as
[44:54] one day the Lord is not slack
[44:56] considering his Pro promise of some men
[44:57] con cons slackness but his longsuffering
[45:00] to usw not willing that any should
[45:02] perish but that all should come to
[45:04] repentance but the day of the Lord shall
[45:07] come as a thief in the night in which a
[45:09] Heavens shall pass away with a great
[45:10] noise and the element shall melt with
[45:12] fervent heat the Earth also and the
[45:14] works that out there in shall be burnt
[45:16] up here we go seeing then that all these
[45:21] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[45:24] persons ought he to be in all holy
[45:27] conversation and godliness looking for
[45:31] and Hasting unto the coming of the day
[45:33] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[45:36] shall be dissolved and the elements
[45:38] shall melt with fervent heat
[45:40] nevertheless we look we according to his
[45:43] promise look for a new Heaven A New
[45:46] Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[45:48] wherefore beloved seeing ye look for
[45:50] such things be diligent that you may
[45:53] found of him in peace without spot and
[45:58] blameless Malachi 3 1 verse verse

[46:07] I'll stop right there and we go to uh
[46:11] Hebrews chapter
[46:20] 6 reading from verse
[46:25] 10 for God is not unrighteous to forget
[46:28] your work and labor of love which you
[46:30] have showed towards his name in that you
[46:32] have ministered to the Saints and do
[46:34] Minister and we desire that every one of
[46:37] you do show the same diligence to the
[46:39] full Assurance of Hope unto the end that
[46:42] you be not full but followers of
[46:45] them who through faith and patience
[46:48] inherit the promises for when God made
[46:51] promise to Abraham because he could not
[46:54] swear by no greater he swore by
[46:58] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[47:01] Bless thee multiplying I will multiply
[47:04] thee so after he had here we go
[47:07] patiently endured he obtained the
[47:09] promise for men verily swear by the
[47:12] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[47:15] to them an end of all Strife wherein God
[47:19] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[47:23] ears of Promise the immutability of his
[47:27] confirm it by an oath that by two
[47:31] immutable things in which it is
[47:33] impossible for God to lie that we might
[47:36] have a strong consolation who have fled

[48:28] to get to that spot to say you know what
[48:29] I'm waiting
[48:31] on hallelujah praise God but this
[48:33] morning I have something upon my heart I
[48:36] have a title and that title was taken
[48:39] from the scriptures in Malachi 3:6 the
[48:41] title is I am God and I change not this
[48:45] is not toov saying I am God now want to
[48:48] make sure that very very clear this is
[48:50] the
[48:51] scriptures amen I am God and I change
[48:54] not and the inspiration the coming of
[48:59] judgment uh that's the inspiration the
[49:01] coming of judgment when we use the term
[49:04] the coming of the Lord and Jesus coming
[49:06] again he's not coming to hail out the
[49:10] world he's not coming to smile with
[49:13] mankind he's coming in judgment amen
[49:17] that's what the coming of the Lord is
[49:18] don't forget that now he's not coming to
[49:20] bring Apples and gpes is coming in
[49:24] judgment amen hallelujah
[49:27] I'll read and this is from the
[49:29] unchangeable word of God but brand I'm
[49:31] giving a story here
[49:33] testimony a young lady out in Oregon was
[49:35] trying to discuss with me one time she
[49:37] belonged to a church where that Mary was
[49:39] O the boss
[49:41] over and she was talking about I hate
[49:44] she said you mean to tell me in heaven
[49:48] these bunch of idiots like was K on in
[49:50] the last night when you were preaching
[49:52] will be the people that ruled in heaven
[49:55] I said that's what the Bible says she
[49:58] said I said your Blessed Virgin Mary had
[50:01] to go up to Pentecost and receive the
[50:02] Holy Ghost and act like them people did
[50:06] last night or she would have never went
[50:08] to heaven she said that's not so I said
[50:11] let me show you right here in Acts two
[50:13] whether it was so or not Mary got so
[50:15] drunk she staggered like she was drunk
[50:17] in the spirit acted like a drunk person
[50:19] under the Pentecost and if God wouldn't
[50:22] let Mary go home to Heaven anything less
[50:25] than how in the world are you going to
[50:27] make it without
[50:28] that you see let you belong to any
[50:31] church you want to you'll have to have
[50:32] the same experience the same exactly she
[50:36] said well I wouldn't want to be there I
[50:39] said I don't think you have to worry
[50:40] very much about that I don't think you
[50:43] have very much to worry about that I
[50:44] said now go on and write up a real dirty
[50:48] article of it in the paper and I will
[50:50] tell you this thus sayith the Lord you
[50:53] mark my words down between this
[50:57] and 2 months from now you'll be dying on
[51:00] the side of the road in an accident and
[51:02] you will remember the words I told
[51:06] you let's continue she never wrote
[51:09] nothing she played a wise trick
[51:12] there I seen her dying no no this this
[51:15] is important this is very important I
[51:18] seen her dying laying in a car accident
[51:23] and God was giv her a chance then but
[51:27] she is smart enough not to write nothing
[51:30] there wasn't nothing in the paper they
[51:32] just let it go that was a smart idea she
[51:35] only save her own life by it God is
[51:38] still
[51:40] God do you understand what happened
[51:42] there the prophet saw a vision of her
[51:45] dying in an
[51:46] accident and that Vision was dependent
[51:49] upon the action she would take if she
[51:51] wrote that evil article she was going to
[51:53] be judged she was smart she Sav like by
[51:56] not writing article it pays to do the
[51:59] right thing and say the right thing it
[52:02] pays to have respect because God is
[52:05] still
[52:06] God I may die in the morning but he's
[52:09] still God you may get a raise a pay but
[52:11] he is still God you could do whatever
[52:13] you want to do but he is still God you
[52:16] could say you're free to do this and
[52:17] you're free to do that but you are not
[52:18] free from the consequences of what you
[52:21] have
[52:22] [Applause]
[52:24] done hallelujah it does not free of
[52:27] choice of consequences because nature
[52:29] have laws and if you break those laws
[52:31] you pay the penalty of those laws you
[52:33] say I free I plant my garden with corn
[52:35] and I plant corn I'm not cleaning no
[52:39] grass I ain't cleaning no weeds well you
[52:42] will see some tie up corn and you'll get
[52:45] no corn and you waste the time planting
[52:47] because the Lost day had to get them
[52:48] weeds away from them
[52:49] corn isn't that right and that's because
[52:54] God is God
[52:57] he deserves respect and we have got to
[53:00] respect him and give fear to him and
[53:03] that brings respects and that's why the
[53:06] Bible is talk about here is the
[53:07] beginning of wisdom to fear God and keep
[53:10] his Commandments the beginning of wisdom
[53:12] isn't that right and God has demanded
[53:15] watch and he we have got to respect him
[53:18] and give fear to him and that brings
[53:20] respect God has demanded that for
[53:22] himself and for all his servants and God
[53:24] demands respect for his servants
[53:26] servants how we know they're his
[53:28] servants because he vindicates these
[53:29] servants by his word he takes these
[53:32] servants and make them Servants of God
[53:34] and proves their servants and by making
[53:37] his word work through them servants then
[53:41] as you respect that servant you respect
[53:43] God and when you respect when I respect
[53:45] you and you respect me and we respect
[53:48] each other then we are respecting God so
[53:52] you can't claim to respect God and
[53:54] disrespect your brother or your sister
[53:56] you give respects because you have it
[53:58] you have to have it to give it and
[54:01] that's something that we fought for and
[54:02] we continue to fight for because there's
[54:05] the coming of judgment amen hallelujah
[54:08] and the tongue is an unruly member and
[54:10] something have to come to tame that
[54:12] tongue you have to press your way to say
[54:14] the right thing that's what sister hatti
[54:16] rright did she said the right thing she
[54:18] said that's nothing but the truth
[54:20] brother brandham and that throw him in a
[54:22] different Gay Al together that's what
[54:23] Martha Mary said the W thing even now
[54:25] Lord and that show Jesus into another
[54:28] Channel all together that he could says
[54:30] Where have you laid him praise God I am
[54:33] the resurrection and the life because a
[54:36] sister said the wrong thing praise God
[54:38] she going say Jesus you want some more
[54:40] coffee and biscuit is a wake going on
[54:42] here we have some special covering or
[54:44] something for you no she went in a
[54:45] different gear Lord if you had been here
[54:47] my brother had not died she was in a
[54:50] gear to ask for more Oh Glory to God she
[54:53] wasn't in a gear to stick in her Circ an
[54:57] and to remain in the condition around
[54:59] her she wanted to say there's something
[55:01] that could have changed what was around
[55:03] her sometime your words change break in
[55:06] some Dimension that change the whole
[55:09] thing for your life oh give the Lord
[55:11] some Praises this
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:20] morning
[55:22] my
[55:24] Hallelujah Jesus praying one time
[55:26] preaching one time and a soldier come up
[55:28] to him Soldier watching him for a while
[55:29] observing
[55:32] him when he recognized what going on he
[55:35] caught
[55:36] it he had a sick man home and he came up
[55:39] to Jesus he asked permission he said

[56:03] house and my servant shall be
[56:08] healed this wasn't a Jew this was a
[56:12] gentile this was a soldier this was one
[56:15] of Rome's men that understood the
[56:17] principle to have authority you can't do
[56:20] your own thing you got to be under
[56:24] Authority oh give the Lord shout in the
[56:31] house we don't want nobody in the church
[56:33] doing their own thing running your own
[56:35] show you have to be authorized you have
[56:38] to be under Authority then you have to
[56:40] back up from everything behind you and
[56:42] Jesus said go thy way thy servant is
[56:44] healed then he said I've never seen
[56:47] Faith like this in Israel that man just
[56:49] took the word and run with it we want

[1:02:24] people set in the meetings and Snicker
[1:02:26] and laugh in the meeting and less than
[1:02:28] 24 hours be crushed into the streets
[1:02:31] this is young people you know am that's
[1:02:33] why Ezekiel 9 the Bible said slay
[1:02:36] utterly young old male female little
[1:02:39] children but come not anyone near with
[1:02:41] that Mark that has nothing to do with
[1:02:44] which church you go to that has nothing
[1:02:46] to do which denomination you belong to
[1:02:48] that has to do with the pillar fire and
[1:02:50] good because God had promised in the
[1:02:52] last days Baptist and Methodist and Je
[1:02:53] winess and bamit and message people God
[1:02:56] didn't promise that God promised sons
[1:02:58] and daughters that going to come into a

[1:03:41] you one husband not husband and special
[1:03:44] men outside of your close close friends
[1:03:46] not that come on now because to come to
[1:03:50] Christ you have to come to the Waters of
[1:03:52] Separation something that separates you
[1:03:55] I know you are marked you are separated
[1:03:58] unto

[1:04:08] offend the people you don't want to show
[1:04:10] them where the exit is on you don't want
[1:04:12] to do that you don't want to throw off

[1:06:44] you'll be filled with the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost if I tell you going to be healed
[1:06:49] you going to be healed because I am God

[1:07:18] America repent America will still be
[1:07:21] judged because America already rejected
[1:07:24] God
[1:07:27] the judgment is already sealed God can
[1:07:29] change
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:40] it I've seen young people sit in a
[1:07:43] meeting in one year when I was placed
[1:07:46] the next maybe within 6 months go back
[1:07:48] to that same place and practically
[1:07:50] everyone was gone stricken somewhere
[1:07:52] with disease and things you have
[1:07:56] to respect
[1:07:57] it I remember sitting young girl one
[1:07:59] night Tennessee I was going out the door
[1:08:02] preaching on a big Baptist Church I felt
[1:08:05] led that night to call her to come up to
[1:08:08] Christ she laughed in my face when I
[1:08:12] when I called her to come to crry she
[1:08:14] happened to be one of the Deacon's
[1:08:18] daughters so that Deon that Deon
[1:08:21] daughter I don't care if it's Pastor
[1:08:22] daughter Pastor son Pastor mother Pastor
[1:08:25] father Pastor brother Pastor sister
[1:08:27] elder daughter Elder son I don't care
[1:08:29] what position that has nothing to do
[1:08:32] with what God have
[1:08:33] said God is no respect our
[1:08:36] persons
[1:08:39] on that's why no higher me and bigger
[1:08:41] you we all have different positions and
[1:08:42] roles and posts to
[1:08:44] fulfill I'm called to do this if I do
[1:08:48] this I'm in God's plan and program for
[1:08:49] my life to be you call to sit there and
[1:08:51] hear the word and do something about it
[1:08:53] for your own life
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:57] if you don't personally apply what
[1:08:59] you're hearing to your own spirit and
[1:09:00] life you just like a
[1:09:02] Catholic B get two our and Mary and go
[1:09:05] with
[1:09:06] that the priest say
[1:09:10] that the postp authorize all them priest
[1:09:13] to forgive
[1:09:14] abortions and because his mouth say so
[1:09:16] he feel
[1:09:17] so he really think he's
[1:09:21] God and he's God to them but this one we
[1:09:24] say here
[1:09:25] 36 he said I am
[1:09:29] God
[1:09:31] H not that kind of not that kind of
[1:09:34] human thing they set him up as God that
[1:09:37] man down in pop but he in the Bible
[1:09:40] there the one who say I am God and I
[1:09:43] change not he just prove himself he just
[1:09:46] vindicate himself he not afraid to show
[1:09:49] himself that's why Elijah said let the
[1:09:52] god that answer by fire
[1:09:55] let that God be good give the Lord a
[1:09:59] shout in the
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:06] house and this message world is about to
[1:10:09] get a serious challenge after all these
[1:10:11] churches for 50 plus years when the god
[1:10:14] of Elijah begin to step forward to
[1:10:17] identify his men and the it God called
[1:10:21] man not man called man but God called
[1:10:25] man not man appointed man but Pillar of
[1:10:28] Fire anointed appointed elected
[1:10:33] predestinated when God begin to anoint
[1:10:35] those men what a rocking is going to be
[1:10:38] because the people are trained to listen
[1:10:40] to The Scribe and the Pharisees but
[1:10:42] Jesus came from the volume of the
[1:10:45] book not from the Pharisees not from the
[1:10:48] Sadducees not from the Ministers of
[1:10:50] Association he came from the volume of
[1:10:52] the
[1:10:53] book and he was
[1:10:56] Messiah and we declare Messiah is on the
[1:10:59] earth
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:07] now that's Messiah anointed word
[1:11:11] anointed word word coming to anoint my
[1:11:15] God and you have something inside of you
[1:11:17] devil can't take it out God put it
[1:11:19] inside of you your father couldn't put
[1:11:21] it out your mother couldn't put it out

[1:11:26] fornication lying this that that nothing
[1:11:29] couldn't stop what God put inside of
[1:11:31] your system had to come out somehow had
[1:11:34] to unfold
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:47] somehow if God was dealing with you at
[1:11:49] the human level as you sin that that's
[1:11:51] it that's it but his blood already paid
[1:11:54] for it

[1:19:11] office he holds in God that's exactly
[1:19:15] right respect him if a minister comes up
[1:19:17] your pastor always respect him I've
[1:19:20] heard congregations talk about their
[1:19:21] pastor and run him down ridicule him how
[1:19:24] is that Pastor want to do anything for
[1:19:25] you he can't I don't say this church but
[1:19:27] I've seen churches you got to love your
[1:19:30] pastor you got to know he's a human
[1:19:31] being and yet God has made him his
[1:19:33] Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him
[1:19:35] overseer and then when you got to
[1:19:36] respect him in that manner listen and no
[1:19:38] matter what the pastor's done if you
[1:19:40] respect him in your heart as God's
[1:19:42] servant God will respect you for doing
[1:19:48] it God will respect you for doing that
[1:19:51] amen so these wars you take these young
[1:19:55] kids talking about young people going in
[1:19:57] the Army they're the cream of the crop C
[1:19:59] they don't know no better knowing
[1:20:01] discipline Army discipline stick ah head
[1:20:02] up the hill let somebody shoot it off
[1:20:05] and the nation forgets them unless their
[1:20:06] family come back here many of soldiers
[1:20:10] but listen to this but a man seldom will
[1:20:12] you find one that will lay down his life
[1:20:15] for the cause of
[1:20:17] Christ I want you to think about that
[1:20:19] statement that's right people find for
[1:20:22] money bigger job bigger house want to
[1:20:24] this and that and everything else but
[1:20:26] what about the sacrifice for
[1:20:29] Christ for God's
[1:20:31] sake
[1:20:33] listen they wouldn't lay down their life
[1:20:35] for the cause of Christ he wouldn't even
[1:20:37] crawl out of a shade tree to go to
[1:20:40] church won't even get out from behind
[1:20:43] the television long enough to attend a
[1:20:45] Wednesday night prayer meeting my God
[1:20:47] that's right it's a shame and disgrace
[1:20:50] that's the reason Angels don't visit the
[1:20:53] churches
[1:20:55] all right that's the reason Angels don't
[1:20:57] visit homes you mean Angel could visit
[1:21:00] homes
[1:21:01] yes we have got to get down to deep
[1:21:06] sincerity of this
[1:21:08] thing that's why it's disgusted to see
[1:21:10] the arrogance of people in this message
[1:21:13] as if God is obligated to them because
[1:21:15] they believe God's in a
[1:21:17] prophet God is not obligated to with
[1:21:19] that at all God is obligated to his word
[1:21:22] because even the devil believe and
[1:21:24] tremble
[1:21:25] so we have got to climb a little higher
[1:21:28] because Jesus busted his own disciples
[1:21:30] and say you have to have righteousness
[1:21:32] bigger than loving your own treating
[1:21:34] your own nice you got to go beyond that
[1:21:37] to love even your enemies you got to go
[1:21:39] beyond that Hallelujah to demonstrate
[1:21:42] that you are at a higher class a higher
[1:21:45] level a higher calling that is what this
[1:21:48] is about not to stay where you are but
[1:21:50] to lift you up higher could somebody say

[1:40:02] mighty angel came down seven Thunders to
[1:40:04] the voices of watch what and God swore
[1:40:06] by himself he come too immutably can't
[1:40:09] listen in other words it is impossible
[1:40:11] for God to lie is one thing God can do
[1:40:15] is lie God can't lie he is a function of
[1:40:19] Truth so when he speak his word he's got
[1:40:22] to bring it to pass both his curse and
[1:40:24] His blessings he's got to bring it P
[1:40:26] when he tell Abraham by blessing I Will
[1:40:28] Bless thee and multiply and I multiply
[1:40:30] God cannot break
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] that God cannot break his Blessing
[1:40:37] towards you and upon your life
[1:40:39] Hallelujah blessings could be delayed
[1:40:41] but not denied oh hallelujah praise God
[1:40:46] thank you
[1:40:47] Jesus praise
[1:40:51] God there are many things that change
[1:40:54] time changes people
[1:40:57] changes weather
[1:40:59] changes nature Nation changes but God is
[1:41:03] unchangeable amen he's the same all the
[1:41:07] time God is an infinite God and we could
[1:41:11] we we we we could use any word to
[1:41:13] explain the word or try to explain the
[1:41:15] word
[1:41:16] infinite he never had a beginning he
[1:41:20] will never had an end therefore when God
[1:41:22] called the scene to act or to make a
[1:41:25] decision the way he acts the decision he
[1:41:28] makes that is forever the same he cannot
[1:41:31] change it amen because he is perfect yes
[1:41:35] sir now you and I can say certain things
[1:41:37] next year we have to change it maybe or
[1:41:38] do something different because we are
[1:41:39] finite we do not know all things but he
[1:41:42] is perfect and his first decision will
[1:41:46] have to be his second decision will have
[1:41:48] to be like the first or if you make
[1:41:49] another decision then he is he did not
[1:41:51] act right when he make the first
[1:41:52] decision
[1:41:53] that will put him as fin out as us so
[1:41:56] God do something say God ouch I didn't
[1:41:58] realize it was going to move so
[1:41:59] you that mean God just like us but God
[1:42:03] can't do that so when he speaks his word
[1:42:06] that's why he could say by myself have I
[1:42:09] sworn
[1:42:12] Hallelujah and it could only swear by
[1:42:14] somebody greater than you but there was
[1:42:16] nobody greater than him amen
[1:42:21] amen you could only swear by somebody
[1:42:24] more powerful than you but there was
[1:42:25] nobody more powerful than him so he
[1:42:27] swore by
[1:42:29] himself that he will keep his Word of
[1:42:32] Promise oh I feel good my God that's why
[1:42:35] Paul could said death where is his thing
[1:42:38] grave where is your Victory these guys

[1:48:14] Faith Hallelujah see the spirit and

[1:49:19] Lord where have you laid him roll away
[1:49:22] the toone Lazarus come
[1:49:27] forth so Jesus couldn't go by Lazarus
[1:49:29] grave and said you're there he's there
[1:49:34] that's not the word we want he there we
[1:49:37] want him to come out from there Jesus
[1:49:39] Lazarus come forth he had to speak
[1:49:43] it what are you speaking you're speaking

[1:50:08] seed or so or so and a seed if it is a
[1:50:11] gumati seed it goes into the ground then
[1:50:14] that seed under the right condition with
[1:50:16] sun and moisture will bring forth the
[1:50:18] life that's in the seed so the word of
[1:50:22] God if a person take it and place it in
[1:50:24] their heart create the right atmosphere
[1:50:27] it going to produce itself so the key
[1:50:29] thing is to create the right atmosphere

[1:50:33] atmosphere that atmosphere is what you
[1:50:36] can create create in your own home in
[1:50:39] your own heart you could choose not to
[1:50:41] hold Arts you could choose not to have a
[1:50:43] grudge and in your heart have a right
[1:50:46] atmosphere and you're waiting upon God
[1:50:49] and God will bless you
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:55] hallelujah praise God praise God the
[1:50:58] thing it is with people is the way God
[1:51:01] Appears many times we want to make an
[1:51:04] idol out of God we ask God for something
[1:51:06] and then he must do it just the way we
[1:51:08] ask
[1:51:11] itow you hear that he call that making
[1:51:14] an idol out of God I see people put I I
[1:51:18] know somebody used to cut the
[1:51:20] Bible I think there's a Baptist spirit
[1:51:24] wake up in the morning call the Bible
[1:51:25] the eyes fall on script for the day the
[1:51:31] word iut the Bible and come and tell me
[1:51:34] we not supposed to play back T in uh
[1:51:36] have TV in the church to play playing
[1:51:37] back message but that's a idol go she
[1:51:39] say an idol I said God show you
[1:51:44] that and when they come with the
[1:51:46] testimony so listen to
[1:51:48] them because see I'm afraid I'm not
[1:51:50] afraid to show them the exit we're not
[1:51:52] begging and buming and trying to drag
[1:51:54] anybody inside of here especially
[1:51:56] especially religious
[1:51:58] ones one who know they figure they know
[1:52:00] more than the preacher know more than
[1:52:01] God himself God doesn't have that God
[1:52:04] have a word for you the people sit down
[1:52:08] and they looking for what the dream to
[1:52:09] get
[1:52:10] confirmed and if the dream rain and the
[1:52:13] preacher on say rain they say
[1:52:15] oh Lord show me the rain dear
[1:52:21] boy they so important that God make sure
[1:52:24] the preacher say that to confirm that
[1:52:25] what is seen is and it's not
[1:52:28] so what you come here for is to get
[1:52:33] exposed that your life could be changed
[1:52:36] you want God to rip the things out of
[1:52:38] you that's not like him you want all the
[1:52:42] hindrances in your life that affecting
[1:52:45] your communication with God and with
[1:52:47] others you want your life to be purged
[1:52:50] and
[1:52:51] purified
[1:52:53] am
[1:52:54] hallu oh my I know we have some issue
[1:52:56] with the sound system but I see we're
[1:52:58] going to close off
[1:53:01] here Moses was 80 years old almost you
[1:53:06] might think too old for God to deal with
[1:53:09] he was an old man unexpected in his age
[1:53:12] to be dealt with with God and he was in
[1:53:14] an unexpected Place Mount Horeb and on
[1:53:17] an unexpected way God met Moses the way
[1:53:21] he usually me he didn't meet Moses the
[1:53:23] way he usually met men he met him with
[1:53:25] the pillar of fire isn't that right old
[1:53:29] man strange place but that God met him a
[1:53:32] certain way Hallelujah so now sometime
[1:53:35] he answers our prayer in the way he
[1:53:37] thinks is best I remember a sister had a
[1:53:40] dream she dreamed she was going through
[1:53:41] some dark Waters some some some some
[1:53:43] troubling Waters and so on and this
[1:53:45] brown skinned man was counseling and
[1:53:47] what not different things like that and
[1:53:49] whatnot now she was a real a bullhead P
[1:53:53] that Spirit whenever her husband is back
[1:53:55] in condition she in church she chur
[1:53:58] whenever her husband start to come
[1:54:00] straighten out and straighten out and
[1:54:01] whatnot she will stay and whip him and
[1:54:04] beat him down to Sid and take he back
[1:54:05] side so I see the spirit upon her and
[1:54:07] something like that so she had this
[1:54:08] dream of this man talking to her and
[1:54:12] straightening um talking to helping her
[1:54:14] and so like that so doing the dream now
[1:54:17] when I begin to talk to her and and
[1:54:18] straighten out and showing her
[1:54:19] operations she said no I said I am that
[1:54:22] man that
[1:54:24] dream you know she didn't believe dream
[1:54:26] after
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] that I said this is your dream here
[1:54:30] being
[1:54:31] interpreted straighten you out but she
[1:54:33] didn't want that she figure when you ask
[1:54:35] her how your husband I praying for I'm
[1:54:37] praying for him I'm praying for him I
[1:54:38] praying for him cuz she didn't whip him
[1:54:40] into into non- entity already whip him
[1:54:42] straight out to the
[1:54:44] church cuz she so she's spiritually
[1:54:46] strong especially when he's weak she's
[1:54:48] strong when he begin to get the strength
[1:54:50] to stand up like a man in his own house
[1:54:51] forget it she stop coming to church he
[1:54:54] under pressure he under stress and
[1:54:56] that's that how went eventually
[1:54:57] everything break up all because she
[1:55:01] don't want she don't want to Humble
[1:55:02] herself to the word of God we all have
[1:55:05] to subject ourselves to the word of God
[1:55:07] oh praise the name of the Lord so
[1:55:09] sometime it may come as this guys it
[1:55:11] become another way around another way no
[1:55:13] matter what way it comes if we have to
[1:55:16] ask we shall receive God said so oh
[1:55:19] praise God now I almost going to wrap up
[1:55:21] here he said no the coming of the Lord
[1:55:24] no the coming of Jesus is so imminent
[1:55:27] the coming of judgment he is calling his
[1:55:30] elected together in Oneness with a
[1:55:33] particular Church in Trinidad no it
[1:55:35] didn't say that in Oneness with
[1:55:38] himself so when you hear Oneness with
[1:55:41] some church or some Pastor or Bishop you
[1:55:42] know that is plum off the beaten part it
[1:55:44] is Oneness with himself and he is the
[1:55:50] word hallelujah
[1:56:07] I I'll keep I'll keep
[1:56:10] this pray for
[1:56:13] me so what he's doing he's calling the
[1:56:16] elect out of the lutherans to make the
[1:56:18] wesan he called the elect wesan to make
[1:56:20] the Pentecostals now he is calling the
[1:56:23] elect Pentecostal to make up the
[1:56:25] headstone to come into it amen he's
[1:56:28] going to come into it isn't that right
[1:56:30] and he is dropping the same kind of
[1:56:32] ministry amongst them it wouldn't be my
[1:56:36] Ministry our ministry it will be his
[1:56:38] ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:56:40] and if it's his ministry it wouldn't be
[1:56:42] puffed up it wouldn't be arrogant it
[1:56:43] wouldn't be KN it all it wouldn't be
[1:56:44] above all and what it wouldn't be that
[1:56:46] it will be just what the Bible
[1:56:48] says hallelujah what the Bible talk
[1:56:51] about charity it Bear all things
[1:56:53] believeth all things hope it all things
[1:56:55] where is
[1:56:56] that everybody spiritual everybody super
[1:56:58] spiritual everybody on where is
[1:57:01] that one time bar was preaching and
[1:57:04] there was this man used to beat up
[1:57:06] preachers the man have a
[1:57:08] reputation okay his reputation went
[1:57:11] before him in B meetings he had about
[1:57:13] 200 men on the platform behind him them
[1:57:16] his preachers back in the prophet saying
