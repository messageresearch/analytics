p.m. we'll have our youth Service as we announced the last Saturday of every month we want to have our youth service so this Saturday ahead of us is the last Saturday of this month so we have youth service at 5:00 p.m. we want to encourage everyone uh to make it after this service uh so correct right so in addition maintenance team group three please meet with Brother Andy Henry after the service and next week group five is CED to serve which is brother the Blackman's group I do want to take this time how many you appreciate the Sunday School choir this morning the Lord carries us a whole Next Generation there and we really want to surround them with love and the support and we really want to appreciate the Sunday school team for the labor and for the parents for being a part of it and those Brave young people who are coming to their own and seen all kind of young preachers and song leaders and singers and you know it's really really wonderful to see how God will use them in a special way um in addition um we do continue to solicit your support for the upcoming July convention we are actually literally the convention is in 19th the 20th and the 21st of July so we are literally three months to the end of the convention so three months from today will be the last day of the convention and before you know the time will come and we'll say it's over we just don't know if this time when this convention is over this will be over and that'll be the last convention so we we we don't know so we want to do all that we can do so we continue to solicit your prayer your support it's a battle it's a challenge but we are under great expectation because the greater the battle the greater the victory the greater the challenge the greater the opportunity for God to show himself alive amongst us can the church say Amen so one more time this coming Wednesday service continues at 8 p.m. here at the Tabernacle there's no service this Friday we have youth service here at the Tabernacle uh on Saturday at 5:00 p.m. maintainance team group three please meet your brother Andy Henry after the service and next week uh Lord willing group 5 which is brother the Blackman's group will be carded to serve and we certainly want to thank all of these groups and certainly if you would like to be involved in one of these groups we certainly encourage it and we ask you to just let one of the deacons know or let brother Steven oliv know as well so may the Lord richly bless you we are not we are not finished yet last week Wednesday it was our pastor's birthday how many appreciate our pastor so everything that has been said thus far he has been aware of it what what what we going into now he is not aware of it so this is this is where we exercise a little you know discretion and Authority Under headship but there are some things we we you know can show him everything you know so but we certainly love and appreciate our pastor andov we salute you you know and was standing preaching this morning and I telling myself wait like he getting older he getting better at this thing but you know you see something there and it's like you know so certainly he's not let letting age slowing down slowing him slow him down at all so we certainly love him and appreciate him and there's one scripture uh that I want to read just from Jeremiah 3:15 and this is my testimony and I trust is yours as well but here it is the Lord is speaking through Jeremiah and I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and that is my testimony so I believe the Lord has given us a pastor after the Lord's own heart that will lead us feed us with knowledge and understanding so we could deal with the issues of Life the challenges of life and to point us to Jesus Christ and that I think is the most important thing because the one thing you know about brother the over he doesn't Point people to himself he doesn't Point people to headstone Tabernacle he is a damant to point people to the Lord Jesus Christ he is a sign pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ it's something that's a foundation of this church and it sets you know so many things in order because in a time when you see so many people pulling people to themselves and saying you know unless you go through me you can't get anything and that kind of foolishness this is a very very very strong position we take here that we are just tools in the Harvest pointing to the coming this context Where We Are under the Good Shepherd the great Shepherd that God has blessed with an Earthly Shepherd who has a heart for the sheep and operates in the way that he does so but over may the Lord richly bless you happy birthday may God grant you many more years of life of health of strength and the wisdom to lead this church and um so he doesn't know this part so the next part are going to put him on the spot we like to invite the church downstairs right afterwards we have some cake and some ice cream and you would like everyone to participate in and even before that we we have a custom cake that we want you to stick the cake with sister ID so I know CH don't know this either so this is now being this is the first full second full F just unfolding here this evening s but but we do want to be able to celebrate with the pastor um on his birthday so may the Lord richly bless you church and um as the ushers and deacons Usher us downstairs for part two of the service where we are able to give honor to where honor is due while we could give the honor that is due so so may the Lord Rich you bless you may your faith be strong and may God continue to lift You Higher and Higher and but over said something really powerful today and I I trust it resonate with you he said as a Christian your battle cannot always be just fighting with sin it needs to move from the struggle with sin to the struggle of growth where the focus is no longer about the lusting and the fornication and these things that that and and and the Bible said to to to to present your bodies a Living Sacrifice that's your reason able service meaning as the foundation and that the battle becomes adding to your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness so that is the growth so I'm looking to see Sons and Daughters come into spiritual maturity because when you have that level of spiritual maturity your roots get deep and no matter which way the wind blows your tree don't get pushed down because you have been through some stuff and the stuff that you have been through have you solid you might feel weak you might feel tired but you're not going to go back in the world to him that overcome it I'll make a pillar in the Church pillar in the Tabernacle pillar in the temple so may the Lord Rich you bless you stay on fire don't let take don't let the devil take your joy away whenever the Trials come look the devil in the face and say hahaa and say Boo back to the devil I'm going to the Rapture I'm going to make it I'm going to make it somehow I don't know how I'm going to make it but I know I'm going to make it I don't know how I'm going to make it but I know I'm going to make it by the grace of the Lord so may the Lord with you bless you ushers deacons and we'll see you downstairs by the grace of God amen amen the move is on my
