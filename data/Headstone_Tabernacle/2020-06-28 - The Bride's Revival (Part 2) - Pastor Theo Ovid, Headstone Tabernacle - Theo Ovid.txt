or or towards any divine gift you will never receive any benefits on it you have got to come with a surrender to God or glory to God hallelujah look at that sign of vision woman she was told by Jesus is not fit for right to take the turns Brendan casted the dogs what would you do if he called you a dog but not her she knew who she was talking to she said Lord that's right so you are right in that but the dog is willing to either scraps from the master's table that got him that was it that here we go that is what he's written for from you to do humble yourself into such a place so see that pride that brother Isaac spoke last week that had to get busted in your life you have to humble yourself or glow and just do what God's they do just follow instructions and over to bless you thanks oil it's no big thing you know god bless you listen Kim was told if he do like his brother evil you get bless can didn't even need a revelation god bless him there's revelation but Kim couldn't handle it because he was not the right seed Oh glory to God so you could actually see somebody do something unless the same thing I'll be blessed just the same I want to be blessed I want to bless them to follow me I want to do what is right I want to say what is right now that I know we could see the right things why I want to say the wrong thing I want to speak the right thing or glory to God when Chavez under his stress and pressure what the job said the Lord give the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord God can tell the devil you hear that you hear that Sita there's a son talkin

going to be a prize and this bride must have a revival Koriyama God Jesus I'm good one-liner dead woman stopped on the altar do you take this dead woman to be a wife no dead bride no coal bride no former bride no intellectual bride is the original bride flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone so this bride have to get a revive her or chlorine accord and we'll come along to the bride has not a revival yet but it coming oh I feel it coming up coming up coming up coming up coming up coming I got something before I can't dead know how something before while going down over the cat I know ask someone to live for it coming up coming up coming I've got to see this revival whatever I wanted to live to see it he said Oh God help me lift us here oh there's a lot of show he couldn't see it because you was the card yet but I could run number Church and run around the church the bride wasn't go yet it takes seven Ponder's to call that bride it takes the voice of God but some points a man function of God to call that brand hallelujah my god is what that's what you waitin for for you to humbly serve in such a place no man I must call senator you know if you are heat instantly or if you are here by degrees so you can be healed instantly or you can be healed by degrees or like Abraham was 25 years whenever the promise instead of getting weak he got stronger hallelujah just remember I go on record I see this with all my heart that is a person here we go we'll take the right mental attitude there was any divine promise of God and it will bring it to pass if you can take that's right attitude I have seen sarcomas cancer leave people by the same thing now this is the part of when I get to maybe you won't be able to receive enough to deliver you all of a sudden but I might say it tonight just closing I want to talk to you a moment and say this if you have time to receive enough faith to be healed instantly then you take the adopted baby route so there is instant healing and there is time of style healing either one you were healed and if your total fear for the instant one take this one they adopt a baby route did you ever hear about adopting a baby if you take a young woman she'd be married she have a husband she's scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one and the thing that I fear come upon me what you feel happen you take that same woman let her adopt a baby then she have on herself but if you haven't got enough faith to receive it right now as a miracle then take the adopted baby attitude say Lord know what the same it's mine because you're promised it and I call from here tonight praising you just the same as I was well now if we don't say this how you will apply it watch what happens it has to happen oh my or - hit the home stretch here but am I wrong he said no watch all right he said when the spirit begin the fall we got that the word will live in the people now what is very vital for a revival as Cisco quickly it washes all the trash out of the bank so that is why we have a revival to get all the unbelief and things away from us so after what you sit on in church it gets settled you go to work I mean some of us we I had no jobs a little children grow up any message I've told you get married we have children you can occupy before you was married it's fun serving it Lord no you have a wife the Seaboard hardly seen your royal here going there there little one come next one come then there's a whole piece of drama by itself then life becomes picked up but occupied with so much different things especially message here our time to use our cell phone so that we should know what's that no cell phone so we I guess before oh so what are you rather does it gets the unbelief and things out of us see that why what a baptism to

continue we on the homestretch you know what is a revival but a Branham he said I want okay just go away all right technically this he's talking about when you see a servant of God gets oceans here till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to God and blushing because of the iniquity of the people then you're gonna say if I ever start a man cannot leave and the presence of a church cannot cannot see the presence of God on the repentance unless the Holy Ghost spirit comes there and give function and power for me another Calvin Knox Finney Sankey of any of those who feels the Buddha love the people that will lay on their face and cry and pray before God he says send us another John Smith the Baptist Church again who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes are swell shut the next morning from weeping till his wife would lead him to the table and feed him at his breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley again a fireman snatch I will show your revival or Glory the Gauss or if I have a caustic was that it right a price of course it is right let's continue quickly what I want you to understand a revival if it ever studied the issue of revivals a revival signifies a move of God in power say it after me a move of God in power let's say together a revival signifies a move of God in power that's not the posture explaining anything

the form of the spirit of prophecy dial resolution 1010 t level 80 level and prophesy who when it's at a fulfill we had to come to the temple like Jesus after all them hundred hills of prophecy she has come and said this day after he talked he said this day this scripture is fulfilled Lizzy here just read I just so you know he went and overcome Lucifer and he returned there we go in the power in the power of the Spirit no yummy yummy yummy Jesus was always the word you know twelve years he explained in words to them Pharisees and scribes the 18 years is a long silence and church name misinterpreted and miss caught instructors I in a certain day and watch them for 18 years knowing and fellows not right Levi did nothing then pretended mocking pretenders all glory to God when he overcome the devil and the spirit no watches break him up on him fullness and the full and said make him make no Superman thing you know that fullness try them drive him let him because he had to prove the Gordian character because he is he is he is a model son but on Colleges worth example seat son so the example season at the demonstrate he have power over himself question do you up all over you do you power your tongue some people come still loose at least try to control that by saying the right thing so when you overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life he returned in the power of the Spirit find the right scriptures to divide it and he divided it he said the acceptability of the law and he stopped in the middle day and read the day of vengeance for endtime bride that will pick up the rest of the scriptures Jesus rightly divide the word and said this day the scripture is fulfilled and they rejected him and then he had a revival that I heal the

things are Reviver brings he says we know so the great thing we are after for Emory viral is one to bring lost souls to Christ true to revive the church back into a spiritual condition the way it should be close communion with God three it brings fellowship among the churches third pray for the sick so kind of revival that is a private revival we have anahit is our revival nobody said when the bride find when they choose finds his brotherly love talk about the bride when the church finds his holy decency talking about the bride when it she finds his priest in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us we have found the coin that was lost I don't care what it is Baptist Methodist I don't care if you have seen or see 1654 see you well you'll have no seams at all Carmen rejoice with us because we have found what we lost and when you find what you lost you're happy you rejoice hallelujah thank you lord missions gonna please hallelujah glory to God so do you get that four things a revival bring it bring lost souls to Christ it's revive the church back into a spiritual condition to where it should be which is close communion with God tree it brings summer ship among the churches third and fourth fourth is to pray for the sick that is our aim sinners first fellowship with the churches and a closed walk with God and pray for the sick that's what the Prophet said in speak to this mountain Oh glory to God we have to fulfill all of that do you believe that or glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah he said felons fans are deep and I'm tyrannical the Philistines a new Pentecostal so if I learn our day how can we have it when the regular Reviva giver is pawned by the world God won't come in where the will is you can just depend upon that you're associated with the world is all off of it when you let the world creep in you go to act like the world then you are finished but when you cut loose every feather from the world and come to God God will use you until you go to Flitton again here is my only hope I have this morning he said while Samson was born a new shock of hair grows out he said God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her come into her what in the demonstrations of the spirit that is not unfallen Oh mystery on full in the wood I'm not talking about
