[3:24] the priest of Midian and he led the
[3:27] flock to the backside of the desert and
[3:28] came to the mountain of God even to
[3:32] Horeb
[3:32] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[3:35] Him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[3:37] of a bush he looked and behold a Bush
[3:40] bullet fire and the bush was not
[3:42] consumed and Moses said I will know our
[3:45] Tim aside and see this great sight why
[3:48] the bush is not burnt when the Lord saw
[3:52] that he turn aside to see God called
[3:56] unto Him out of the midst of the bush
[3:58] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[4:02] I he said Jonathan hither

[4:07] the police where are lost and this is
[4:09] holy ground moreover he said I am I am
[4:12] the God of thy father the God of Abraham
[4:15] the god of Isaac the God of Jacob and
[4:19] Moses hid his face and he was afraid to
[4:22] look upon God and the Lord said I have
[4:26] surely seen the affliction of my people
[4:28] which I in Egypt and have heard their
[4:32] cry by reason of their taskmasters find
[4:35] no dis Horrors and I am come down to

[4:50] of the killer' nights and the Hittites
[4:52] and the Amorite sonder parasites and the
[4:56] Hivites and the Jebusites my god blessed
[4:58] to be nervous waiting to be seated
[5:00] oh praise the name of the lord thank you
[5:03] lord
[5:04] well a small exhortation today maybe 10
[5:08] minutes 8 minutes there's a few minutes
[5:11] the cries of my people that's the exact
[5:15] Tichenor how a user this evening the
[5:17] cries of my people and the Prophet said
[5:20] from a message of wine now to you people
[5:23] that wanted to renew the joy of your
[5:24] salvation somebody lost joy ting back
[5:28] what you did
[5:29] did you neglect parameter neglect read
[5:32] in your Bible neglected preen at your
[5:35] home asking the blessing at the table it
[5:40] may look like little stuff but all these
[5:43] little stuff adds
[5:45] that's right oh my that is so be
[5:48] uncommon of Christian no matter where
[5:50] you are
[5:51] bow your head and pray don't be a shame
[5:55] of him pray anywhere
[5:57] if ever there left that joy whatever
[6:01] weeded out not a root of bitterness
[6:04] remember when a man got saved here we go
[6:06] when I might get saved there's this
[6:09] button here becomes eternal life in your
[6:11] heart that is God as you are able
[6:15] here we go to push out all the roots of
[6:17] bitterness then God begins to spread in
[6:21] you then you become a son of God a man
[6:25] was made to be God small G and to be a
[6:29] God did you know that he's in the image
[6:32] of God he's a son of God he is like him
[6:35] he was given my domain Genesis 1:26
[6:38] dominion over the earth that's right
[6:39] he ruled the earth he ruled the animal
[6:41] kingdom all your the King number the
[6:43] kingdom of God above he was God an
[6:45] amateur God because he was image image
[6:48] of God what happened because he
[6:50] disbelieved God's Word it sent him back
[6:52] out of shift for himself no God here we
[6:55] go is trying to get him back and when
[6:58] you have faith and accept him my brother
[7:00] just let that doesn't like begin to grow
[7:02] out and take all the roots of doubts and
[7:05] bitterness yield yourself to the spirit
[7:07] then you become a son of God a daughter
[7:09] of God you begin to grow in the grace of
[7:11] God the Holy Spirit begins the bill is
[7:13] kingdom within you so that's why the
[7:16] Prophet could say make yourself a
[7:18] Christian don't assume you Christian
[7:21] because you come to church but make
[7:23] yourself a Christian isn't that right so
[7:26] you see brother Branham why is is that
[7:28] we do not do the things and then we
[7:30] should do how is it that our gifts and
[7:32] things in a church does not come to its
[7:33] color where we should be how is it our
[7:36] church does lift up into the spot where
[7:38] it should be the people in the testing
[7:41] time drops away like Israel did they
[7:44] think God has left them oh my but
[7:47] remember the rock never left Israel
[7:49] Israel left the rock it forgot about her
[7:53] being with them all the time it was
[7:54] right there
[7:56] to the end of the road it followed them
[7:58] and that rock is following you
[8:00] not even Gideon knew that God was with
[8:03] him because the people was just beating
[8:06] them out and taking the crops but the
[8:07] Lord came down until didn't the Lord is
[8:09] with you the Lord is with you then
[8:12] Gideon challenged God if you could be
[8:14] with us
[8:14] where are the miracles praise let's have
[8:16] a discussion go glory to God I don't
[8:19] wanna get caught is with me port is with
[8:21] me I want to see the power I want the
[8:23] seed of vindication I want to see the
[8:25] healing power I want to see delivering
[8:27] power or glowing a God and professor
[8:30] dealing with a structural man you love
[8:32] scripture man he said if God is here
[8:34] they talk to the miracles
[8:35] if God is here it cut the how
[8:38] supernatural if God is here they got to
[8:41] be a manifested reality or give the Lord
[8:44] a shout glory to God here coming to sit
[8:48] up on your food your coming together God
[8:49] praise and worship Oh hallelujah

[9:01] if I left the rock it followed him it
[9:03] wasn't out of speaking distance it
[9:05] wasn't out of here in distance it wasn't
[9:07] out of seeing distance and neither is
[9:10] Christ in the church today some of you
[9:12] have back slid and done thing which is
[9:15] wrong he lost that joy your water is
[9:17] dried up he is still in speaking
