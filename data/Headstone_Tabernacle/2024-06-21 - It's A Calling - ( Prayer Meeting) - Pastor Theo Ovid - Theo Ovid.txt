especially those that are sick among us we have several people that have different challenges like sister Lord sister Wendy father God different ones Lord Jesus sister Karen Knights Lord sister praise God my precious sister Lord visit them in a special way done a c clack Lord Jesus may you visit your people that are sick in body sick with flu cold Lord disease whatever condition it is and may a healing virtue flow tonight in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen amen God bless you and it is great to be here we have had perion for a while and we want to do that tonight and then I have something very short I like to share with you and it's have a scripture I like to read that scripture is taken from 2 Peter 1 verse 10 2 Peter 1 vers 10 and it says here wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election show but if you do these things it shall never fall make your core election sure and I a sort of thought here it's a calling it's a calling that same scripture 2 Peter 1 10 in the Amplified it says this because of this Brethren be all more Sol solicitous and eager to make sure to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast your calling and election for if you do this you will never stumble or fall you know I was thinking about this scripture and I was thinking about election and calling and he thought different things and I was thinking you know like a child born into a home that child didn't asked to belong to that home or to be born of that family that child has been elected to be in that family so say you have a child or children and these are your children and yet when they start to grow they start to mature you have to they have to be guided as to what career what job and that's where your hand is in molding and shaping and directing their lives and their response to what you share and to how you present things you know it could have a positive effect or negative effect and I'm thinking in my mind you know sometimes your mind going a bit and I'm thinking a mother or father calling a son hey Johnny come and Johnny don't want to come now you can't deny him belonging to the family but he's not responding to the call the call of God and there are so many people and I see back Brethren over the years and they always prophesying to themselves in their own imagination I'll come back I'll come back and I I'm a son I'm a seed elected and that kind of and all that is just talk because this scripture about make it cor let show is to ratify or to confirm exactly that because if you are elected you would respond to the call of God it's a call in other words say for example tonight tonight we are in a PR whether you feel to pray or not that is not the part we deal with we dealing with what this is tonight and what we are called to do tonight if you don't respond to the call to talk to God tonight then you know you have to wonder what have you been elected onto because you see the election is in God we don't touch the Nubs of election we don't press those buttons God does and when God have election in mind he has predestination in mind that's why the Bible said it this way who he for you he called so his for knowledge of us give him the ability to elect us and call us out of our sinful condition because that's what we were in onto a purpose and sometimes as humans we drop down and live in this human realm without seeking and Desiring to know what is that purpose at the end of the day if we live go to church come back home meet people uh buy car house get married whatever it is get old and dirty we are living just like anybody else on canat because that's what everybody does they live they have children they get married they have jobs they get old and so on like and they die but this end time church and this end time people have the highest calling ever given to a people on the Earth this Gentile Bri because just imagine when he said he came unto his own his own receive him not and the turn have to switch from the Jews to the Gentiles out of which Christ gets a bride then he is looking to the response of this Divine call now when God call you or I could say when God chose you he chose you to unexpected end he chose you that you could make it he have confidence that if you do what you're supposed to do and act how you're supposed to act you will make it Jesus told his own disciples if you love me you will keep my Commandments and my my father we would love you and we will manifest ourselves to you it wasn't an automatic thing it was some conditions tying to their predestination or we know how Jesus prayed he said father that they may be one as we are one and so Jesus prayed that prayer and yet he knew that Peter was going to backslide and yet he knew that Peter was going going to go in the power of self he knew that and Jesus didn't despise Peter because he knew this this flesh man he he he understood that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak but at some point in time we have to get this realization that not only are we elected but we are called to do something if you just throw election up in the air I'm elected you're smoking but you're elected you're fooling WR but you're elected that doesn't make any sense God doesn't run his business that you are elected unto a purpose and part of the purpose is on to prayer a call to prayer not a call for somebody to pray for you this what a lot of us pray for me pray for me pray for me and you not praying for yourself I'm not praying for nobody but you have to recognize it is a calling I was feeling extremely tired tonight but you know what I have a calling I have responsibility I saw when G started to play something wasn't right and I know you know when I check and what's happening now I something wasn't right and I have a choice press on or just stick because it's not working out as we expect tonight but what we choose to do is to press decisions are great it's a joy to be a decision maker it doesn't make any sense not making decisions and not making decisions is to make a decision not to make a decision make a decision to accept your call Jesus told disciples plainly you have not chosen me but I've chosen you then what are you going to do about what are you going to do about this call that you have there are some of us we we we wasn't born with the gift of fatherhood or the gift of being a great husband that was not the gift there is no gift as that there's no gift as such we learn we feel we stick we fall short but that doesn't mean we cannot learn that doesn't mean we cannot grow that doesn't mean we cannot teach because if you fail as a father or as a wife or as a husband or as a mother you could still learn stuff to teach others that they wouldn't do what you do or act how you act and you'll grow into maturity this is the purpose of God and sometime I go I preach a message upon not just about salvation but Christian maturity Christian grw them because Jesus grew in knowledge and wisdom and understanding God expect that from us in other words the teacher that teaches any class Any teacher you could ask and we have teachers Among Us they feel great when the children do well and they move on so the form one teacher feel great the child move on to form two the form teacher and this is the the students they make the teachers proud when they perform as they supposed to perform let's switch it to God now what did Bam says the Holy Spirit sent out reports God is asking how is my son doing what's the report on him well was in church and know next in church again and well he's not making any stand well he's not making any sacrifice he's not doing anything he just believe a son that's it that's all yes we have that too but what is the c in about this election so let me just uh I just give a backdrop there let me just get something here Ephesians 1 says according as he has chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to good pleasure Romans 9 verse 11 says for the children not not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not a work but of him that call it it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger and is it written Jacob have I love but Esau have I note that both Esau and Jacob have absolutely nothing to do with this calling that God put here he said the calling according to the election might stand not of works but him that call it and the last one of yeah last one in this is 2 Peter 1:10 that we read wherefore the rather bre give give diligence to make a calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall never fall now and we have a few SC on calling it won't be long with you Romans 8 from script 28 for we know all things work together for good to them that here we go love God do you love him to them who are be called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate they he also called whom he called they he also justify and whom he justified they also glorified now if we take this scripture at St value it finished because we elected called Justified glorified finish we can go home now and relax that is not how it works that middle part there that is not written the part of sanctification the part of sacrifice the part of labor labor to enter stride towards this promise that part is a part God expect us to do and guess what God can't do it for us when the Bible says uh like in consecrating yourself or um Romans 12 and so on like that when the Bible speaks about these things about you um becoming and you beholding his face and you being changed and transformed God cannot do the part that you have to play in that regard that is why you come to hear the word why because you will learn of him the word will teach you because we have our own will and our will have to come in subject to his will okay almost done few more we finish all right now 2 Timothy 1:9 says who had saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began and the last scripture in this section is 1 Peter 2:9 but he have chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should here we go show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness into this marvelous land let's go this is a calling time for the BR it's a separating time when the cha and the wheat is to be separated and Al though the wheat has been wrapped in the Sha but now it's calling out time it's another Excellence so has the gospel and the power of almighty God has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of the Bride that's what says let me be part of the BR let's continue the life the stalk there Carri the life certainly did but you see it become the St and it was finished the organization the life went on into Wesley it come right out one big blade do look like the green didn't Jesus in the last day says the two would be so close it would receive the very genes the predestinated elected it was possible he said now watch it's weak time it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecostal age this is the bride age and here we go as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church so friends is a calling that is going on last quote we have God wants his people to pray and when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled and their burden lay farther than what they thought then they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then God begin to hear it was time for God's word to be fulfilled so when amam and Jose saw it was time for the word to be fulfilled they went to pray to God and it is usually those who pray is the one who got the burden and the one who gets something it is those who pray and hear this part that's ordained of God to do so inclosing I want to tell you it's a calling it's a call to pray it's a call to cry out it's a call to seek his face it's a call to ask it's a call to plead it's a call to intercede make your calling an election show right now as we hit the home stret those that catch the vision will have a burden of being in relationship with God people will call upon God you but when condition Ares for 50 years Saudi Arabia had an agreement with America that oil will be purchased in US dollar that agreement ended I believe the 7th of June and Saudi Arabia is not uh going and restore or renew that agreement what it means is that by this by oil which is the energy that the world was pumping by all along it held the US dollar as a reserve currency it is no longer it's heading now where it will no longer be so because people could buy oil in rupees in the Chinese currency and in in the Russian currency in whatever currency things are changing and if you think for one moment that because it's not in your country doesn't affect you you are wrong things are changing everywhere and we have to be concerned with not just the external that is happening but the internal about us I want to challenge you to be concern about you you and your burden what is your burden tonight what is your concern tonight many are called but few are chosen be one of these chosen ones tonight that is called to pray if you are backsliding ask God to restore if you are in a condition ask God to deliver you if you are sick ask God to heal you you're not here to say words you're here to honor God God didn't call you out for you to remain in that Miss God called you out that you could walk in the light why would Jesus tell the woman go and sin no more because I forgive you now she could run and say he forgive me that's s to do let me go and sin and I'll go back again no the call out is that you will not go back the way you were let us bow our heads heavenly father I thank you for tonight I thank you for this opportunity to share these words with your people it's a calling a calling I remember that call upon my own life it was it was something I just had to do it I had to respond I had to get baptized I had to serve you I had to drop the girlfriend I had to drop everything to follow Jesus oh God May a first love strike your people tonight May the opportunity to get right with God the opportunity to get reconciled May stke the heart tonight May something come a fresh break off the staleness break off the largy break off the sluggishness and may a new expectation Aris in their hearts to love and to serve you granted tonight Lord those prophets words are so precious that those who have a burden to pray those who have a burden they pray and as they pray they get back a burden so is it that when we see people without a burden it means that something is not there they're not praying because there's no burden there we have children Lord we have grandchildren Lord we have family we have friends we have people in church that we have seen they just get old and they're not changing they the same as we ever knew them how much years ago same behavior same attitude same actions Same Spirit is terrible but here we are Prayer Changes Things won't you touch Heart Tonight Lord won't you stir Spirits here tonight won't you anoint your people like never before that they will seek you with all their hearts go into the homes Lord visit them go among the family Lord visit them convict them of wrong convict them of sin convict them of strain and may their heart be refocused to you may this be a reboot tonight A recharge tonight are strengthened tonight in Jesus name I ask it be with your people speak to the fathers speak to the mothers speak to the brothers speak to the sisters Lord speak to your children their husbands and wife speak to them Lord the husbands who not in position Lord may you put that inspiration upon them a desire in their heart to get back into a position when the world is trying to emasculate men you trying to bring men into the statue of a perfect man oh God help your people Lord when the world have women in Rebellion and rebellious Spirit oh God that same bullet Spirit want to take over people Lord Jesus oh God won't you just bring them back into the word sisters like Sarah Brothers like Abraham God bring the right quality of metal father God when when you get that metal Lord you have to go through fire to burn and to cleanse it Lord there something else to find gold and to get it purified and and the fire and the trials and the testings is to help purify Lord may we not shut them but may we Fe them may we look forward for them because our trials and our testings have more to do with our purpose than we think and instead of shrinking back as we often say asking God to take us out take us out take us out instead of bringing take me through that I can learn what I need to learn that I can grow that I can strive oh God help the people tonight oh God forgive their past and bless their future may this be the beginning of something special of something real lord make this word a reality make this message a reality and have so much testimonies in the old days of people making so much sacrifices and waiting and brother Blackman gave us such a powerful testimony had no money to go to church and just standing waiting for transport and somebody could tell just step in here and get a ride and get a bus ride and everything else so much testimonies they were just gone everywhere the testimony was he did it the testimony he opened the way he provided the testimony was everywhere but time roll on Lord we're getting older we need to hear those testimonies acknowledging what you are doing what you have done and what you're about to do father
