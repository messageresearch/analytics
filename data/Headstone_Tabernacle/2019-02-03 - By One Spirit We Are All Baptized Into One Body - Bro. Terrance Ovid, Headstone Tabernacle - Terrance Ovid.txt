a shot gonna play a many many loving this evening breeze chord hallelujah as you get ready for the word tonight man we have a precious brother Terrence move it administering for us but we wanna turn to proportional scriptures beforehand so let's turn to Genesis we wanna turn to chapter 17 even Genesis after 17 we want to go from this is 10 to 14 there and then we have we'll skip on down from there so I just followed me this evening on Genesis 17 reading from boost to him a man Genesis chapter 17 and blues 10 he says this is my covenant which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and he shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is brought with bought with I money must means be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people for he hath he has broken my covenant when skipping down to verse 23 of that same chapter and Abraham took Ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of Abraham's house and circumcised a flesh of their foreskin and a self-signed a oscarbot had said unto him and Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and Ishmael his son was two teen years overall when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin in the selfsame was Abraham circumcised and Ishmael his son and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger was circumcised with him and now wanted to lead us was one verse first Corinthians chapter 12 and we wanna just read one who's there who's 13 first Grainger's 12 and verse 13 just one verse there that says for by one spirit are we all baptized a man into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit and got our blessing amen oh please go away man hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus let's just bow heads over the prayer all Christians have any father Lord we come before you true enough grease on Melissa this afternoon through the speaking blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been speaking for seven church ages and speaking on our behalf this evening God your promise that every man child must be circumcised Lord this is the covenant the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord you circumcised a hundred and twenty believers in the upper woman that they are Pentacles that was the Alpha Church receiving their portion you are the Alpha and you at the Omega here we are the Omega bride of Jesus Christ looking forward portion I was the Commission to get out of here Oh God a pretty angel of God the Holy Ghost Himself will drop down when amidst the smoke this evening Lord and inspired you water to the hearts on your trend I'm going to Accord each one feet Lord to believe Lord that they could be sealed today for we are in our revival we recognize our promise and we come to claim it Lord true father me anoint your word and me and speak to me to your people Lord I surrender myself unto your will received and have your perfect week for asking Jesus Christ's name Amen you may have a seat for thought this afternoon by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body as well Anthony read in John chapter 17 God came and told Abram this is my covenant after Abraham had fresh bread God after you went and took back lot for the kings had communion everything else after God make him partially sacrifice and do all those things in the time pass here is God coming to give him the final confirmation and change in his name is it this is the Covenant every man child in your house got to be circumcised if he is not he's going to perish and that seal of circumcision only represented the baptism of the Holy Ghost but every believer is supposed to have but a balun said that God made a covenant with his people and the Covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the seed of Abraham so only until you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you becomes Abraham's seed but form angel spirits has come known and people don't have a clue as to what is the promise they have knowledge they have wisdom they believe this way and that way but this evening I want you to see the reality of where you come from and where you will you only spray this morning true but you talk about the final battle took place in heaven good to be finished on it so I wanted to take you on a short journey before you get long interview circumcision to see what took place and if profits are going to see with your eyes of supernatural looking you know parabrahman spoke about seeing the white light before the dawn creating the will without going there we're going to see the war in heaven we're going to see what took place so I wanted to fasten your seat belt open your eyes are spiritual looking because we traveling at the fastest speed you could think about that's the speed of thought so we have arrived I can see the Great Spirit of Almighty God rotating through eternity and angels just rotating out of the Spirit of God could you see it if you could see its Amen because you have to see it with his supernatural eyes of looking ethical said he saw a great whirlwind out of the north I wasn't fooling the glory of God he saw everything come out of it when brother branham was seven years old a woman came in the poplar tree and the voice of God speak to Parapan am that was the Spirit of God in the form of a whirlwind so I wanted to see this Great Spirit of God spinning along in eternity and ensures this fly out of him can you see it right if you see it here is but a bun and said you are part of the angelic beings that rotated out of God and resisted the devil's life [Applause] so there is with your representation started as part of the angelic beings that rotated out of God [Applause] so watch there are angels that God created and your angels that rotated out of God so think about millions of angels all looking alike in heaven and some root eat a lot of God and some was created by God I'm going to create one special angel we call him Lucifer he was the son of the morning he was the anointed cherub that covered he was perfect in beauty until iniquity was firm with him now this particular angel didn't know who he was he was God ouch enemy God created his own enemy because God have to display his attributes all these angels only know about worshiping worshiping worshiping God but God is a God who might was Nevada power was about Dominion so he has to have something to express his might his power and his Dominion against so he created this beautiful angel called Lucifer son of the morning the anointed cherub that covered perfect in beauty and he Lucifer don't know who he is and god-given power because God don't want one advantage advantages you want a good adversary to have a good fight that is why you have to face your battles because you have to fight because you as bad of the angelic being that whatever god that resisted the devil's life so let me spirits have coming against you you have to have a good battle god set it up show public record set it up so every son that cometh to God must be tried must be tested I must be proven to be the right people son hallelujah glory to God so God gives Lucifer power he had power of transformation yet power of deception and yet one more power of perversion of deformation so yeah three degrees he was a doctor here a doctorate of deception a doctorate and transformation and a doctorate in deception think of it this man Lucifer but a Balaam said sit and thought he was good so here this he looked at himself and he saw his beauty he look at Michael Michael so simple there is no beauty and hamrick desire just simple and humble and meek and Michael controlling all the Angels they at his disposal and he was a shining angel Lucifer with all his beauty and he is not getting that worship so he decides in himself he will be like God I'll sit in the Mount of the Congress at the north and be worshipped because of my beauty and because of what is in me I wanted to follow carefully because we fight in these Devils from way back then you understand so he decide to walk up and down like when job God acts Satan where was he said walking to and forbid it the same thing Lucy if I was doing a heaven walking up and down with his beauty does in the Angels so angels are looking at this character and someone else in but isn't he beautiful the same suit Satan has created musical instruments in him you know all these things attributes was in him so he keep on doing this for quite a while until he believed he had the majority of the Angels on his side the Bible said put heads of the angels listen carefully so when the time came the tortoise if of the thought he was born what a word is a thought Express so he had to express his thoughts at one time so he made a declaration in heaven I am God I am the Holy Ghost the prophet said the Angels was never given to make a choice the angels in heaven was never ever given the opportunity to make a choice and he said whatever choice they make they cannot change the mind you said we could change our mind change about to have a nice idea and Tennessee but they cannot change the mind whatever decision they make we have to stay with it so when he made that declaration all the angels that believe him immediately was transforming the demons including Satan because of the transform important Satan the balance a marvel not that Satan to transform itself as an angel of light and his ministers as ministers of righteousness so when he spoke that word all these inches I believe him the turning to a demonic form I want you to see yourself in that great congregation as an angel that rotated out of God and next to you stands another angel just like you all of a sudden it turned to a demon what would you do they draw a sword and the war started why 11 so all these prayers I was in these bodies were cast down to the earth and all the demonic bodies was reserved in the chains of darkness for the end time all the bodies that these spirits was in the tented demons that was once angels there were so hideous that had to take them and put them in Chains of darkness but the spirits that inhabited the bodies came down upon the earth these are the spirits that we are fighting the prophets said the Spirit is harmless until they get a body to operate true there was a thousand there was a legion think of it it wipe out a whole shrine a thousand demon in legions and you was there in that battle and God put your tongue in it to finish the battle he said you are the physical manifestation of the attributes that you wasn't God so if you are that physical manifestation of the attributes that you wasn't God then the Spirit of God have to come down and see you with the Holy Ghost to make you a manifested attribute of Almighty God and yes ready battlers yes we're the battlers so these four means of quit coming the message and I tell people I am the only ghost the same declaration that Satan military some say when you believe this message they received the Holy Ghost same lion deceptive spirit remember you have a degree in deception and he deceived the people by the word he deceived Eve by the word he had not a different explanation for God that no think of it and is these Devils you gotta fight so some people think and I have the Holy Ghost I believe in the have the Holy Ghost when they don't have the Holy Ghost and looking for the Holy Ghost but by one spirit we are all baptized into one body Abraham had to circumcise his servants all the people was bought with his money they were a group of people that was covenanted by the seal of circumcision anybody else that was dead in so much so the Bible's like God sought to slay Moses after he commissioned him to go down to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel God looking the Slayer Moses in the in because Moses didn't circumcise his children she was returned forth was Moses forth so when his wife recognized what was taking place she circumcised - a bloody husband you are to me and you as an individual must be circumcised it's absolutely essential and compulsory and necessary that you receive the seal of circumcision of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be coming to this church and see a nice church and about your mission no you have to get the seal of circumcision for yourself you got to get desperate to hold on that you wanted your child cry out and report them to baptize you with the Holy Ghost it's a desperate time is that desperate Oh weather Brandon said if you don't have the baptism of the holy lose it means God has not recognized your feet because when God recognized your feet he put fire upon your feet by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that when I got the Holy Ghost then you make yourself a Christian you could preach 2nd Archangel because cast out Devils we could dance on his perch because prophesy because do all these things and still don't have the Holy Ghost I want you to see the reality of the hour what you have to get jesus said so you have to read between the lines listen Jesus said many will come to me in that deal and say Lord have that I preach in your name I thought I cast out Devils in your name have a tie he listened to him and I said to them depart from me you workers of iniquity I knew you not the Prophet said the word dear is the same word that is written translation and Adam knew his wife Eve and she bought what set it mean he didn't put his Holy Spirit in the person he never had a personal experience in their lives but I was doing these things life it remember the disciples was commissioned to do the same with all the illegals and yes they met a brother doing the same thing and he was with them and they come to Jesus they say master you know with a guy casual devonee not with us we wanted a stop you know he said no leave him if he is not against me is for me and people are sitting down in the message commented church and been fine cheese was but republic see doors are what further for the Atomic Age don't become for a theater may get your friend Christians in church is further I know it's father that grants actually is put in fact wicked blaze iron I want you to see as an individual because it is a new season the oil spirit identify as whose a street what was taking place see more prophesy inside what a hundred years after and going to have a great revival but it would be individuals he said that all the men in the power of the Spirit what it is the manifestation of the sons of korah eternal contain as individuals possessing the individual inheritance in the promised land [Applause] you got to recognize you got to fight fight and pray fight the devil's I want to keep you from getting the Holy Ghost you got to wrestle not let go the angel until he sees you with the seal of the Living Corder [Applause] some people say it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost is they seed in the soul i seed in the soil it's just a seed it got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit [Music] it got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit this thing is so real friends when you see the reality of the our time is short if you want to be lost focus where time is short it is the acceleration of ripening so God is telling you about that with Seymour what happen Azusa Street to anoint your feet to get desperate like Seymour get desperate because everybody was against them the earth was against them and the odds are against us the odds are against us everybody settle down in the message and the technical in the rapture you're not going nowhere they got to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you grow up for the Holy Ghost itself to come he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seed of God one time he said is the seed of Abraham he prophesied the manifestation of the Holy Ghost operating is his children is the seed of the itch yet the manifestation of the Holy Ghost operating in his children he holy verse but to be operated and you the Holy Ghost got to be moving Alleluia with sighs with my purse with one mass disciple to follow the believer not believer following signs this is the reality but let me tell you this God sent a super saying to this generation but the bernam went to Grass Valley in 1962 he had some places lineup to go to and a whole set up ministers come together and it was discussing doctrinal things up where bands who decided to him don't far system please this is a voice spoke to him I see Jessie I see Grass Valley and call butter borders was his mange time and if there's anything in Grass Valley so here it is for ministers in four different changes for different Pentecostal churches in Grass Valley is spring for Evelyn can a son and then when but I borders check it if I know these guys one by one to come then he said sister Adam bite always acts him the Gulen Grass Valley so if you don't Grass Valley to minister he preached five messages the first one was says we will see Jesus when he finished preach that message he had a hidden line is every couple was everybody was his love his message say preach to vichara part one trapa to trap a stream then he preached a super sign he used Isaiah 7:14 to preach the message called super sign if you read Isaiah chapter 7 will realize that Syria and Israel had Confederated to lick Judah they wanted to fight Judah and wipe off Judah a house or the king God said Isaiah said tell him do whatever they I go fight a battle field and Isaiah ax ears ask God for a sign because borders give people signs to confirm what able to do they generally go back this August so ah the King said I am NOT asking God for no sign he believed what would do it he had no sigh you know God said he said that the Lord will give them a sign prophesied a virgin shall conceive it mr. bachelor wore it mr. bacala dude on the chat with Syria and Israel gonna stock mutton fortune conceiving quite a good boy himself Kodama sign yes I'm sure in Grass Valley brother branham give a sign for the world message would I hear what he said he said when that church strike the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of the denominational churches I want to say it again maybe a girl get it all the denominations churches was seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and was having experiences with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in a measure evenly catholics of the charismatic was having that all that them was having that but the profit is prophesized something different he said when the church strike that power of God the baptism of the holy ghost outside of the dimensional system of churches outside the Catholic Church wherever it is he said when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is may agree to the people he said damn that is predestinated like you are here take care my life see it and walk in it what is it a super sign a super sign [Applause] so God sent a super-sized in 1983 1984 1985 what same as super sign to the message will and they rejected you know what they say they say we're going back to Pentecost but we profess a Pentecostal bajo Comerica Durazo [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my god my god father what's going on here Oh Lord Jesus oh my god hello glory to God thank you Jesus Oh My Lord my God my father hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah my Jesus my Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh boy yes oh my god hallelu listen to me friends the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy so all that is about to happen has already been prophesied in the word to happen so but a Branham little that prophesy in that message is super Sayan and then is a message Vijaya he was speaking about the former in and the latter in going to fall and why he was speaking that the spirit of prophecy drop upon him and he said God is going to send the baptism of the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word it going to restore and he stopped right here he didn't restore what but is thwarted by tree he bring it more specific the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon planted with cuenca sua who plans in the world the son of man is he saw this was really good seed the seed of the chair the kingdom and the people that manifest the world a voice for the edge which will live and he chanted kingdom for the Aged so you got to manifest the world evolved for your age you've got to receive your Pentecostal outpouring of the baptism of the holy ghost and shia hallelujah glory to God he made it more specific listen in 1982 I stood Umbra nights father's house in the drawing when a bunch of young people and see the power of God come down and slay every one of those young people on the go one sister started sing like an angel her lips was hardly moving she was singing there is a river and aside all these windows were open and half music pipe organ music was just filling the whole house accompanying the sisters sing like an angel on the ground it was such an experience but a night father came and look in his mind was blown his oh my god what dooms is true and you run to Policastro Prakash is an open D cursor under Castro walk up the driveway eat everyone eyes father I said that is the Holy Spirit leave that the people left their homes and came all outside the building all of these steps they want to see what is happening this is Minister 10 we cannot make no noise after 10 because they could call the police these children groaning and on the ground we have to enter okay we got to lift them up and put them on chairs Saddam they drunk in the spirit not one of them claimed they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they had an experience with God and the spirit of prophecy came not amongst them but abandom said they spread of prophecy could come on one place in the day and never come back again it comes somebody else and I see that with my own eyes and one of the things that was said to the young people is that do not follow your friends your friends don't know the way I am doing and I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost that was 1982 in 1982 Burakumin prophesy the baptism of the holy ghost beyond poor in 1983 and it did and it's sweet
