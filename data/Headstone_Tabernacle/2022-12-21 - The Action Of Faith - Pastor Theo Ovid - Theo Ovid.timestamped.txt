[20:33] [Music]
[20:36] live
[20:40] God bless you thanks for coming
[20:43] and if I have your Bibles I'd like you
[20:45] to turn the two portions of scripture
[20:46] tonight Matthew chapter 16 we want to
[20:49] read from 13 to 19. you also want to
[20:52] read from James chapter 2
[20:54] verse 15 to 24.
[20:57] Matthew chapter 16 reading from verse
[21:01] 13.
[21:06] when Jesus came under the coast of
[21:08] caesarea Philippi he asked the disciples
[21:10] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[21:13] man am
[21:14] they said some seed at our John the
[21:16] Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah's one
[21:19] of the prophets he said unto them but
[21:21] who is he that I am
[21:23] Simon Peter answered and said thou art
[21:25] this Christ the son of the Living God
[21:26] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[21:28] blessed are thou summoned by Jonah for
[21:31] Flesh and Blood had not revealed unto
[21:33] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[21:35] and I see unto Thou Art Peter and Upon
[21:38] This Rock I rebuild my church on the
[21:40] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[21:43] it and I will give unto thee the keys
[21:45] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever though
[21:48] shall bind on Earth shall be bound in
[21:49] heaven whatever shall loosen it shall be
[21:52] loosed in heaven
[21:54] I read in James chapter 2 I want to read
[21:57] from verse 15.
[22:00] and if a brother or sister be naked and
[22:02] destitute of daily food and one of you
[22:04] say unto them departing peace be warm
[22:06] and filled notwithstanding you give them
[22:09] not those things which are needful to
[22:11] the body what does it profit
[22:13] even so fit if it had not works is dead
[22:22] my feet by my works
[22:25] they'll believe us that there is one God
[22:27] they'll do as well
[22:29] the Devils also believe on Trimble but
[22:32] will thou all know will thou know over
[22:34] in man that faith without works is dead
[22:37] was not Abraham or father justified by
[22:40] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[22:42] upon the altar
[22:43] see his doll feet wrought with works and
[22:46] by works was feed me perfect and the
[22:49] scripture was fulfilled which said
[22:52] Abraham believed God it was imputed unto
[22:56] him for righteousness and he was called
[22:58] the friend of God you see then how that
[23:02] by works a man is Justified and not by
[23:05] faith only let us pray father we have
[23:07] read your word and we thank you for your
[23:09] word we are grateful for the scriptures
[23:12] that is being made alive in Israel and I
[23:15] pray tonight that the word become flesh
[23:17] and dwell Among Us father may I take the
[23:20] word and maybe like a direct arrow to
[23:22] the house of your people made anchor in
[23:24] their souls and maybe a transformational
[23:27] service where their lives will be
[23:28] completely transformed by this blessed
[23:31] word of God in Jesus I ask it amen and
[23:34] amen you may be seated or praise the
[23:37] name of the Lord It's always a blessing
[23:39] and a privilege to be in the house of
[23:41] God I don't have a title reaction of
[23:45] faith
[23:46] praise God feet come by here and here in
[23:48] the word is not right the last of us we
[23:51] had hearing receiving and acting on the
[23:54] word tonight we're talking about the
[23:55] action of Faith another inspiration the
[23:57] call of God
[23:59] I believe each one of you here tonight
[24:01] have a call of God upon your life
[24:04] is that man that called you
[24:06] is God that called you it's not your
[24:09] family called you it's a calling of God
[24:12] I want you to that to Anchor inside your
[24:14] spirit inside your heart that there's a
[24:17] call of God upon your life he didn't
[24:20] call you when he was good and nice and
[24:23] he was righteous he called it when he
[24:24] was filthy and he was no good it's a
[24:26] call for for Just As You Are
[24:29] and you came Just As You Are but he
[24:32] didn't leave you just as you are he
[24:34] began to tidy you up and clean you up
[24:36] because he was born in sin and they
[24:38] coming shaping iniquity or all Filthy
[24:41] all nasty and rotten and so on but he
[24:44] said you are my child and I coming back
[24:47] for you I'm coming I'm coming to redeem
[24:50] you
[24:50] praise God I'm not coming just to bless
[24:52] you anymore to bring you back because
[24:55] you were somewhere before
[24:57] and the scripture clearly states who
[24:59] even knew he called
[25:01] so if you have to be in God's for
[25:03] knowledge to get the calling of God
[25:06] let me say it again you have to be you
[25:07] had to be in God's for knowledge to get
[25:10] the calling of God
[25:11] so that is why Jesus had the ability to
[25:14] see Peter come
[25:15] and you come because he knew those guys
[25:18] names was on the book
[25:20] came to call them Direct Call
[25:23] Hallelujah that was Jesus word made
[25:26] flesh calling these disciples but he
[25:29] released his spirit because he has a man
[25:32] outstanding there in Jerusalem and in
[25:35] Israel and so on like that he could do
[25:37] so much and no more but when his spirit
[25:39] is released it released throughout the
[25:41] whole Earth
[25:42] seven spirits released throughout the
[25:45] whole earth to find every predestinated
[25:48] seed
[25:50] I think the internet have billions of
[25:51] people how much billions not millions
[25:53] billions connected to the internet that
[25:56] is man Science and Technology accomplish
[25:59] that but God don't need internet
[26:01] God need just a spirit
[26:03] what the spirit begin to move it could
[26:06] reach but I'm gonna say the Holy Ghost
[26:07] will drop will go across the world
[26:09] overnight overnight
[26:12] the entire world overnight with a
[26:15] wonderful glorious
[26:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost overnight
[26:20] I am standing here to you tonight and we
[26:23] are few in numbers that have nothing to
[26:25] do with this omnipotent power
[26:27] that is about to be released
[26:29] you sit here ordinary but you don't know
[26:32] what about to take place something great
[26:35] something magnificent something powerful
[26:37] about a Breakout
[26:39] nothing could stop it
[26:41] Oh Glory because no man could stop it
[26:43] not your past can even stop it the mouth
[26:46] of the Lord had spoken it he spoke to
[26:48] the prophets I will restore that I have
[26:50] nothing with you you can't stop the
[26:52] restoration that God prophesy over your
[26:55] life Oh Glory to God I will restore to
[26:58] you the years you can't even stop that
[27:00] God promised a bumper crop go somewhere
[27:03] to bring back the oil and the wine god
[27:05] promise me bring back the figs we
[27:06] produce in its strength that means
[27:08] you're gonna have production you
[27:10] wouldn't be burying it on fruitful but
[27:12] you will have a living faith and live in
[27:14] virtue living knowledge and live in
[27:17] Temperance I live in patience I live in
[27:20] godliness and living brotherly kindness
[27:22] this thing you're gonna live
[27:23] whatever I'm said the house of God will
[27:25] live again this Bright Tree would live
[27:28] again the devil cutter down
[27:31] but God said I'm gonna restore your
[27:35] glory to God hallelujah praise God oh
[27:38] give them some Praises tonight do you
[27:40] believe this is a word for you tonight
[27:42] Oh Glory nobody and I want to see the
[27:45] action of faith in your spirit in your
[27:48] soul in your heart Peter couldn't help
[27:51] it because inspiration knew upon Peter
[27:54] you may be seated praise God o glory to
[27:58] God hallelujah question Jesus asks the
[28:01] question who do men say I am some said
[28:05] this some say that and it's easy to talk
[28:07] about what other people say yeah
[28:09] yeah you could Rara and talk all night
[28:11] about what people talking about
[28:13] but when he asked the disciples who do
[28:16] you say I am they got caught
[28:20] because all of a sudden they realized
[28:22] they don't know
[28:24] they just know he's a messiah he's a
[28:26] master teacher he's Healing The Sick
[28:28] this whatever whatever but they don't
[28:30] know who that man really is and all of a
[28:32] sudden inspiration move upon Peter
[28:34] anoint and move upon Peter fire jump
[28:37] upon Peter because he's a channel
[28:40] to get inspiration because he's a son
[28:44] he's a seed he don't have the Holy Ghost
[28:47] yet but he could get Revelation he don't
[28:50] have the Holy Ghost yet but he could be
[28:52] inspired he don't have the Holy Ghost
[28:54] yet but the call of God is upon his life
[28:56] that's why Jesus came to him and Peter
[28:59] dropping that channel number toward the
[29:01] Christ the son of the Living God and
[29:04] Jesus said Flesh and Blood did not
[29:07] reveal that to you so Revelation is
[29:09] Supernatural God give the Lord a shout
[29:12] Revelation is not natural Leverage is
[29:14] Supernatural you could study that is not
[29:17] Revelation that is study you can get
[29:19] information that is not Revelation
[29:20] Revelation when the spirit reveals it
[29:23] and when the spirit reveals it it comes
[29:25] he confirms it okay the Lord I shout so
[29:28] we're not talking about knowledge we're
[29:30] not talking about intellectual
[29:31] information we're talking about divine
[29:34] revelation that's why the prophet these
[29:36] divinely reveal mystery troops not just
[29:40] revealed but divinely revealed not man
[29:42] interpreted not man revealed but
[29:46] divinely revealed when you hear from
[29:48] Heaven Oh Glory to God Seven Thunders
[29:51] will unlock the heaven when they are
[29:54] spoken by Revelation Revelation have to
[29:57] speak this word
[30:00] divine revelation
[30:02] Oh Glory to God praise God
[30:05] [Music]
[30:11] let me just read something here for you
[30:12] brother Branham
[30:14] he's in here I didn't feel this
[30:16] resentment from my other word I feel no
[30:19] your welcome spirit that you are a
[30:20] Believer and I want you to come just
[30:22] closer to me I am not trying to read
[30:24] your mind sir at all you don't believe
[30:27] that do you no because that would be
[30:29] something that you had on your mind I
[30:31] pray that God will go back and do
[30:33] something that's not even on your mind
[30:34] so you will know he said no uh there's
[30:37] something wrong with you no doubt he
[30:39] said you wouldn't have gotten that
[30:41] prayer card you you come here to be
[30:43] prayed for you confess your faith by
[30:45] believing that he will heal you no what
[30:47] I'm trying to do now is speak to you to
[30:50] contact your human Spirit your faith you
[30:53] see your feet operate this gift your
[30:58] feet brings it down on me
[31:02] so the prophet was going down with
[31:04] discernment to activate the faith
[31:06] because the faith is not going to bring
[31:07] this thing down on him
[31:09] oh Hallelujah another one thanks be to
[31:13] our Lord Jesus Christ who brought again
[31:14] the spirit of God and the resurrected
[31:16] Christ who is present tonight to heal
[31:18] all that is in need he is here friends I
[31:21] have no way of bringing him to you only
[31:24] your faith brings him present
[31:26] [Applause]
[31:29] so I want to show you the importance of
[31:32] you having faith sitting there and
[31:34] having the expectation sitting there
[31:36] you're not just going to hear the
[31:38] preacher expong and hear a teacher Teach
[31:40] an information you're here to be a
[31:43] participant here to get in the spirit
[31:45] you have to receive from God Peter was
[31:48] one of the disciples but Peter got
[31:50] involved he got caught up somehow he
[31:52] gets into our Channel where the spirit
[31:54] could drop down upon him and he can say
[31:56] talk about the Christ so you could get
[31:58] in a channel because understand this all
[32:00] the disciples were there all of them
[32:02] were called but Peter dropped into my
[32:04] channel that the father opened it up to
[32:07] him
[32:12] you forget that you are individual
[32:15] Revelation doesn't come as a group
[32:17] there's no group Revelation okay the
[32:19] Lord I shout I want to say it again
[32:20] there is no group Revelation it's our
[32:23] personal revelation that Christ has
[32:26] revealed himself to you and Jesus went
[32:29] on further and said Upon This Rock I
[32:31] will build my church therefore the devil
[32:33] can't really throw off the church
[32:35] because he cannot get what's in your
[32:37] heart yo what's in your heart is sealed
[32:40] he can't go there because only the word
[32:43] can discern the thoughts and in terms of
[32:45] that the devil cannot discern the
[32:46] intents of your heart
[32:50] or you should be shouting on that one
[32:52] down by the devil not to listen to see
[32:54] what you're speaking
[32:57] he don't know what's in your heart it's
[32:59] only when you speak he should hear what
[33:01] you're saying
[33:04] God wasn't given the Devil Revelation
[33:06] and discipline was getting no Revelation
[33:07] so when you step and talk to Eve what
[33:09] did God say go I don't know
[33:11] he's not talking to me
[33:14] and then Eve so I'd fit to explain and
[33:17] explain and explain and see she's the
[33:19] normal revelation
[33:21] because if even a revelation she never
[33:23] explained nothing to that devil she will
[33:25] not tell that so don't go on asking
[33:27] yourself
[33:28] because I get it from my husband
[33:30] my husband got the word
[33:32] and when I came forth I didn't know

[38:11] and Adam
[38:12] you heard it preach over and over
[38:14] when when God lost the whole of Adam
[38:17] lose the whole of the Earth
[38:19] as long as God was in control of Adam
[38:21] Adam could control the Earth it's an
[38:24] automatic flow of the current
[38:26] the corn was flown from God to Adam and
[38:28] Adam to the earth once that line was
[38:31] broken Adam couldn't this dictate to no
[38:33] lion he couldn't speak to no elephant
[38:35] because all these animals the name was
[38:37] he wasn't born with him he was supposed
[38:39] to call them too just as God called Adam
[38:41] he's a lion come and sit down here oh
[38:44] what's the lion keep on walking normal
[38:45] normal Adam have no power when a lion
[38:48] there are no power of the elephant he
[38:50] lost the power and God had to take back
[38:53] the book and seal it up with Seven Seals
[38:55] and put seven Thunders are stamped
[38:57] behind there oh no man could watch on it
[39:00] no man can look upon it the book was
[39:03] sealed the inheritance was sealed the
[39:06] power was sealed and he promised them
[39:08] unseal that power unseal the book that's
[39:11] why we're here tonight because Seven
[39:13] Seas have been broken
[39:15] and the entire Holy Ghost has visited
[39:17] the church the entire Holy Ghost has
[39:20] visited the church to reproduce Luke's
[39:22] 1730 in a prophet in this hour

[39:30] that was this son of man revealing any
[39:32] son of man don't tell me that was
[39:34] indirect God said the Lord every word
[39:37] from that Prophet was not say the Lord a
[39:39] Time failed there's gonna be a pride
[39:42] there's going to be a bride in Trinidad
[39:43] there's going to be right around the
[39:45] world there's going to be a seven ton of
[39:47] Revival because I say so no because the
[39:50] prophet prophesied that the bride had
[39:52] another Revival yet it will take that
[39:56] what that those seven Thunders
[39:59] to pick that bride up again
[40:01] he's sleeping
[40:03] she's sleeping

[40:16] even young men shall faith and utterly
[40:18] fall but take that faith upon the Lord
[40:20] not dead and hang on in service no wait

[40:24] Frank will come back inside of you
[40:26] strength to press strength to push I'm
[40:29] not gonna give up Caleb was 80 plus
[40:31] Hallelujah he said I will if the Lord be
[40:34] with me I shall be able to drive them
[40:36] out it was the action of faith and Caleb
[40:38] he couldn't kill my Giants two as good
[40:41] as 22 it doesn't matter the numbers
[40:43] didn't matter this is my land God give
[40:45] me this month monk he brought his mind
[40:47] I'm coming to take it do I become a
[40:50] chance on that mountain I'm gonna climb
[40:52] on Pyramid Oh Glory Don't Tell Me Faith
[40:54] is too hard and brought you to hide a
[40:56] knowledge but I'm gonna get every one of
[40:58] those virtues that's my promise
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:05] I could say it differently every one of
[41:08] these virtues is a new one in me
[41:10] in seafoam
[41:12] getting my mountain mean that gonna
[41:14] unfold and manifest itself
[41:16] Oh Glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah
[41:20] The Apple Tree will take a deep breath
[41:22] and try to pump up apples they just keep
[41:24] drinking water
[41:25] oh glow and grow him that's all the
[41:27] apples you have to do just drink water
[41:29] and grow all these summer autumn winter
[41:32] spring everything passing through but he
[41:34] just stay in this drawing that when I
[41:37] was a child I speak like a child
[41:38] Hallelujah because a small plant you
[41:40] can't expect that apple tree that small
[41:42] plant to produce any fruit it's too
[41:44] small had to get mature and when you're
[41:47] too small you're caught what food you
[41:48] could produce you had to get big you
[41:50] have to get pacifier you have to get
[41:52] baby stuff but when you become a man
[41:54] that's different
[41:55] now we can produce fruit no God expect
[41:58] something have you
[42:01] [Applause]
[42:03] for a message expectancy but Abraham
[42:06] says he said no that's the way tonight
[42:08] many of you here may seem like your your
[42:11] time of Deliverance is way away but
[42:13] sometimes when it seems the foot is away
[42:15] on the darkest of our that is when you
[42:18] receive help from God
[42:20] there's an old dishonoring proverb
[42:22] dishonoring proverb which says God help
[42:24] those who have themselves that's an
[42:26] error God helps those who can't help
[42:29] themselves
[42:31] if you could help yourself you would
[42:34] need God's help
[42:35] but God has Mercy on those who cannot
[42:38] help
[42:39] themselves
[42:41] God
[42:42] revealed the Simeon that he will not see
[42:45] that until he sees the Lord's Christ it
[42:49] was a divine revelation to this old man
[42:53] emphasize all
[42:56] everybody expect him to drop down and
[42:58] dead they want him to sit at home in a
[43:00] rocking chair and he keep going to the
[43:01] temple whether he walked with a cook
[43:03] stick a hook stick he come at the very
[43:05] end of the service but he know
[43:08] Messiah have to come true there so he's
[43:11] checking every don't know when
[43:13] all you know death only buzzing but
[43:15] can't touch him because he has to see
[43:18] the Christ because it's a revelation he
[43:21] can't produce that to nobody he can spot
[43:22] a piece of paper signed by God and tell
[43:25] him that
[43:25] Hallelujah this thing is in my heart
[43:28] and a man living out something the
[43:30] action of faith in his heart brings me
[43:33] the service he can forsake the
[43:35] assembling because you don't know when
[43:36] God will come suddenly to his Temple so
[43:39] he can't afford a mess
[43:40] a Wednesday night a fire night a Sunday
[43:42] is there
[43:44] Hallelujah is coming because he knew one
[43:47] day the god that revealed it would
[43:50] confirm it to God that revealed it with
[43:53] indicated they're going up reveal it but
[43:56] manifested
[43:59] so you can't stop that brother
[44:02] because he has Revelation Revelation is
[44:04] not water
[44:06] where is this wine
[44:07] won't have no stimulation with it wine
[44:10] have that kind of thing it does make you
[44:12] a little dizzy it just makes you a
[44:14] little tipsy it is making a little happy
[44:16] it's making a little excited because
[44:18] it's the wind of Revelation you have
[44:21] something your neighbor don't have
[44:23] Oh Glory to God you're drunk but a new
[44:26] wine
[44:26] oh give the Lord a shout
[44:29] [Music]
[44:29] [Applause]
[44:35] because the Holy Spirit told him so
[44:39] and that's why there's so much a short
[44:41] testimonies because there's a short of
[44:42] Revelation because the revelation will
[44:44] give you a testimony
[44:45] oh my what was blind one time just heal
[44:48] a man who's blind and you see and he
[44:50] says say God he will say God heal you

[49:15] plumbing went off key so we couldn't
[49:17] have that channel of the flow of God and
[49:20] all this gospel to clean and justify and
[49:23] sanctify is to make a preparation that
[49:26] you could become a Channel of God that
[49:29] the spirit could flow through and when

[50:18] wealth because you ask for wisdom and
[50:20] Solomon was a wise man that's why he
[50:23] built that Temple but these guys were
[50:25] endured with the power of God and they
[50:27] were reflecting different things because

[1:06:55] world in this orbit in five minutes time
[1:06:57] the time has come when there's a fallen
[1:06:59] away the Bible said the time has come
[1:07:01] for signs to follow the Believers we are
[1:07:04] at the end time we are in the lattering
[1:07:06] we are the time when men will be heavy
[1:07:08] high-minded lovers of Pleasures more
[1:07:10] than lovers of God truth Breakers force
[1:07:12] accusers and continent fears despise
[1:07:14] those that are good the time has come
[1:07:16] when they are teaching doctrines of
[1:07:18] devils perverten the Bible teaching into
[1:07:21] the theories and theologies to draw
[1:07:23] groups of people away after them that's
[1:07:26] the object of them doctrines of devils
[1:07:28] to get collection of people to have
[1:07:30] power over men doing up over yourself
[1:07:32] they want to power over churches and

[1:08:38] Mighty hand they Twisted right back into
[1:08:40] the things of the world so the time had
[1:08:42] come when God called a halt and it must
[1:08:44] be that way and I think it's time to
[1:08:46] call a halt now we have Twisted the word

[1:08:49] in the world every plant every man has

[1:08:54] this way
[1:08:56] they twist the world to suit what they
[1:08:58] believe
[1:09:00] because what they believe is inside the
[1:09:02] heart and get Satan give them a delusion
[1:09:04] and the flipping scriptures this way I
[1:09:07] mean
[1:09:08] the president it even fit like a square
[1:09:11] pegging a wrong hole and you're pushing
[1:09:13] it pushing it and you're squeezing it
[1:09:15] and turn it and God never ordained that
[1:09:17] line must be upon line here little dear
[1:09:20] little praise God the pyramid no noise
[1:09:24] and no noise
[1:09:26] everything perfectly slide into place
[1:09:28] Oh Glory to God isn't that right
[1:09:31] hallelujah praise God he said now watch
[1:09:34] watch he said no watch and as we went to
[1:09:37] it this morning you can't expect a baby
[1:09:38] to be a born a man
[1:09:40] it's got to grow to it
[1:09:42] and we grow in Christ
[1:09:44] through the full stature not somebody
[1:09:46] that converted tonight and tomorrow they
[1:09:49] go and preach the gospel we grow up in
[1:09:50] the mannered into this statue of Christ
[1:09:53] Elijah was tired he was weary and God
[1:09:56] gave him a rest under a juvenile tree
[1:09:58] Quran says God tell him eat because the
[1:10:01] journey is very hard he said oh how we
[1:10:04] need in this journey we are need to find
[1:10:06] a place of rest to Feast on the word of
[1:10:09] God so it will give us strength night
[1:10:11] after night go to the room and rest come
[1:10:13] back next morning fresh eat more because
[1:10:15] there's a great journey and a great
[1:10:17] battle ahead for the church
[1:10:20] that's a prophecy so that's why we come
[1:10:23] and hear the word to eat because there's
[1:10:26] a great battle ahead for the church God
[1:10:30] is going to turn his church into manhood
[1:10:32] now we have played and Fallen as
[1:10:35] children but now we are going to have to
[1:10:36] put away childish things and take on
[1:10:38] mannered and maturity we have got to get
[1:10:41] down into the father's business
[1:10:43] Oh Glory to God now many people say this
[1:10:46] is the prophet of our church this is the
[1:10:47] prophet of our church and two of them
[1:10:48] contrary one to the other something is
[1:10:50] wrong we must all speak the same thing
[1:10:52] we must speak not contrary but exactly
[1:10:55] with this word that's how a true Prophet
[1:10:57] is tested where he's got the word if
[1:10:58] their testimony is not according to the
[1:11:00] law and the prophets there's no light in
[1:11:01] them
[1:11:02] the Holy Ghost is the action in you
[1:11:05] it's a life not an emotion
[1:11:08] oh my not some fleshly evidence it's a
[1:11:12] person

[1:11:34] Quicken to make alive the world
[1:11:36] to bring this world to life Oh Glory to
[1:11:39] God for somebody reading this and it's
[1:11:40] ordinary to them but to you Christ is
[1:11:42] jumping out of the book
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:45] because Christ is revealed in his own
[1:11:48] word
[1:11:48] almost done when you know you have done
[1:11:51] when you have done what you know is
[1:11:52] right

[1:16:37] why they put you all of that his
[1:16:40] brothers are jealous of him sell him out
[1:16:42] go down to Egypt yeah they make jail all
[1:16:45] kind of stuff
[1:16:47] to get into position
[1:16:49] what if Joseph was a miserable
[1:16:52] complaining believer
[1:16:54] he fed up by the dreams he complained he
[1:16:56] felt up a dizzy complaint he gone
[1:16:57] complained he complained he complained
[1:16:59] he complained the story ended up the
[1:17:01] front he was complaining to him
[1:17:03] but David Joseph understood he had a
[1:17:07] call of God upon his life
[1:17:09] and the vision is always from appointed
[1:17:11] time
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:14] look how God brought Julia down to the
[1:17:16] very close end
[1:17:18] have a baker and a butler Joseph City
[1:17:20] visions of one grand cut off one being
[1:17:22] restored and Joseph tell him guarantee
[1:17:25] when your credit position remember me I
[1:17:29] saw him and walk out the prison women
[1:17:30] forget
[1:17:32] he didn't want to remember
[1:17:34] what to remember prison
[1:17:36] he he won the party thinking about that
[1:17:39] he is not the restored Butler
[1:17:42] but I need
[1:17:46] an atmosphere prison who he doesn't talk
[1:17:50] about that he was like even never went
[1:17:51] there
[1:17:53] but God given Joseph time
[1:17:56] for the season him to unfold because God
[1:17:59] was working his way out
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:03] God was working his way out in Joseph
[1:18:06] so Jordan had to hit that maturity spot
[1:18:08] drop a dream upon pharaoh and then when
[1:18:10] Pharaoh say all man Jack who can't come
[1:18:13] and bring this Revelation and unfold his
[1:18:15] vision that I can't remember he said
[1:18:18] they're losing their head
[1:18:20] when they start the game old talk he saw
[1:18:21] the plane for time
[1:18:24] there's no time
[1:18:26] quality wise man time right now yes
[1:18:28] because this thing's whole thing I can't
[1:18:29] remember it's a trouble trouble
[1:18:31] then they bottle up remember there's a
[1:18:35] man in prison who prophesied and told
[1:18:37] him this and told him that let's get
[1:18:39] that man
[1:18:40] send for Joseph you could see the drama
[1:18:42] you could sit on a big screen and Joseph
[1:18:45] don't be suffering is an old bread and
[1:18:48] moldy bread and and bad taste and tea
[1:18:53] and Joseph is about to get promotion
[1:18:56] to be a fish table with people bringing
[1:18:58] the kindness of grapes and apples and
[1:19:00] meats and everything else but right now
[1:19:03] it's still bread
[1:19:05] Remnant food
[1:19:07] and you have to take that with Grace
[1:19:11] Oh Glory but that is a temporary place
[1:19:16] that's not that's not permanent
[1:19:18] that prison condition is not permanent
[1:19:20] your prison of sickness or whatever
[1:19:22] condition you're in is that primitive
[1:19:24] that's a temporary place Oh Glory we're

[1:20:02] Them Bones the Joseph bones yes
[1:20:04] every time you see them bones there they
[1:20:06] still be going out
