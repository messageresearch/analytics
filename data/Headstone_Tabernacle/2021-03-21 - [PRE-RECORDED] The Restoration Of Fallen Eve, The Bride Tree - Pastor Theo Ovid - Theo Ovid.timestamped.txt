[17:54] will i pour out
[17:55] my spirit matthew 17 reading from verse
[17:59] 10
[18:00] and his disciples asked him saying why
[18:04] then say the scribe that elias must
[18:06] first come
[18:08] and jesus answered and said unto them
[18:11] elias truly shall first come and restore
[18:14] all things
[18:16] but i say unto you that elias has come
[18:19] already
[18:19] and they knew him not and have done unto
[18:22] him
[18:22] whatsoever they listed likewise
[18:26] shall also the son of man suffer of them
[18:28] then the disciples
[18:30] understood that he speak unto them
[18:33] of john the baptist let us pray father
[18:35] we thank you for your presence and those
[18:37] gathered here today
[18:38] and we thank you for those connected
[18:40] even today on the internet we pray your
[18:42] blessing with flu out
[18:44] and speak to our hearts as we wait on
[18:46] you and depend upon you
[18:48] look into calvary looking to the cross
[18:50] may your blood come and splash all over
[18:52] here and cover us this morning
[18:54] in jesus name may ask it amen and amen
[18:56] you may be seated
[19:03] praise the lord
[19:07] advertiser the restoration of fallen eve
[19:10] the bride tree another inspiration our
[19:14] restore saith the lord
[19:16] o blessed be the name of the lord the
[19:18] restoration of
[19:19] fallen eve the bride tree well i
[19:22] certainly appreciate
[19:24] that final message uh with isaac
[19:26] preaching but isaac preaching
[19:28] one fate one lord
[19:32] one baptism kind of bloomer
[19:36] it's very noteworthy that in the
[19:39] beginning when man was trying to get
[19:40] that unity it was under the
[19:42] ship of man isn't that right and god had
[19:45] to come out to confuse
[19:46] the language because that unity
[19:49] challenged god it was very troublesome
[19:52] to god god
[19:53] could not allow man to remain under that
[19:56] unity
[19:57] so god came and tweaked and changed the
[20:01] different languages
[20:02] so when somebody said bricks they
[20:04] hearing something else
[20:07] or something like that so they couldn't
[20:08] continue building so god confused the
[20:10] language but they are pentecost
[20:12] when the holy ghost came down all here
[20:15] in their own tongue
[20:17] god flipped the whole thing back to show
[20:20] that when the holy ghost comes
[20:22] it will produce the right kind of unity
[20:25] under the headship of the spirit isn't
[20:28] that wonderful today
[20:30] oh blessed be the name of the lord so we
[20:33] see what the law will do for us this
[20:34] morning
[20:35] now he said here and a guide at the
[20:38] finishing of the seventh seal
[20:40] the mystery of god should be finished
[20:41] you know who god is
[20:43] what he is how he lives his nature
[20:46] his being and referring to the pyramid
[20:49] you're supposed to be
[20:50] all the way up there by that time to
[20:52] bring us into the full stature
[20:54] of the sons and daughters of god
[20:56] remember we didn't
[20:58] know about god's stature and nature
[21:01] until gaussian and prophet
[21:02] all we know is church bible teachings
[21:05] and so on but when the prophet came
[21:07] he came to introduce the statue of god
[21:10] the nature of god he even said when we
[21:13] ask to get close to god
[21:15] what we're already seeing we want to
[21:16] grow in god
[21:19] hallelujah praise him our lord so he
[21:21] said oh brother give me a church full of
[21:23] the holy ghost
[21:24] god will do in one year what all
[21:26] theology fails to do in 2000 years
[21:29] you wait till the anointing of the
[21:31] church really strike home
[21:33] to that little remnant after the doors
[21:35] of the gentile
[21:36] is closed oh god will anoint a church
[21:39] then
[21:40] he who is filthy doesn't be filthy still
[21:43] he was righteous let him be righteous
[21:44] still
[21:45] and he is holy let him be holy still and
[21:48] god will anoint the church
[21:50] with the power of god and things will be
[21:53] taking place
[21:54] not coming home and going going going
[21:56] the streets are
[21:58] will be taking place he's in and i
[22:00] believe that we're on the borderland
[22:02] tonight
[22:03] he's that right he said watch we can't
[22:05] even have faith for divine healing let
[22:07] alone a rapture in faith
[22:08] he said god have faith that will change
[22:11] and quicken this body and be taken away
[22:14] we talk about the rapture but the rap
[22:16] the rapture have to do with your body
[22:18] being changed
[22:19] and you would have to have faith that
[22:21] your very body will be changed
[22:23] what he said i believe that there's a
[22:26] church on this road tonight
[22:27] a power of the living god that men and
[22:30] women will speak the word here and there
[22:32] it will flash like like then a church is
[22:35] coming out
[22:36] not a psychologist not a put on make
[22:39] believe
[22:39] but a real true genuine
[22:42] anointed holy ghost called our church do
[22:45] you believe that this morning
[22:47] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[22:49] hallelujah praise
[22:51] god and we find out the holy ghost is
[22:53] bordered on individuals
[22:55] praise be to jesus not the entire group
[22:58] but on individuals
[23:00] so when you come to church you come as
[23:02] an individual
[23:04] to get your portion nobody could keep
[23:06] you from getting your portion
[23:08] your husband can't keep you your wife
[23:10] can keep you back
[23:12] your children can't keep you back not
[23:14] even your trials could keep you back
[23:16] the holy ghost is poured on individual
[23:19] do you believe that i say it again
[23:22] the holy ghost component opponent on
[23:24] individuals
[23:25] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[23:29] you may be seated hallelujah praise god
[23:33] poured out
[23:36] [Applause]
[23:40] [Music]
[23:46] what kind of foolishness is that
[23:48] hallelujah
[23:49] praise god the holy ghost gonna be
[23:51] poured out
[23:52] but amanda said one day the last drop in
[23:55] god's bucket
[23:57] gonna be poured out and afterwards
[23:59] there'll be no more left
[24:01] that's why the wise version get the
[24:03] extra oil
[24:05] that's why you didn't come here to
[24:07] occupy a pew
[24:09] or occupy a chair you come here for the
[24:11] holy ghost
[24:23] he was god almighty he was a master
[24:26] teacher
[24:26] he knew exactly what he was doing when
[24:29] he called peter and
[24:30] andrew and all of those guys he knew
[24:32] exactly what he was doing
[24:34] they were born in sin they were shape
[24:36] iniquity but they had a german side of
[24:38] them
[24:39] that they did not know so he came to
[24:42] reveal
[24:43] where they came from
[24:49] glory to god you may be seated before
[24:52] they receive the holy ghost
[24:53] he gives them a taste of what power is
[24:56] like
[24:56] in matthew 10 he said behold i sent you
[24:59] power
[25:00] these were men without god in them
[25:03] they didn't have the holy ghost but they
[25:05] had power upon them
[25:07] it was temporary power to let these
[25:09] brothers know
[25:10] it could be done when the spirit of the
[25:13] lord
[25:14] comes upon my heart i will
[25:18] dance like david dance shall i give it
[25:21] shout
[25:22] and do the works that christ do
[25:29] samson didn't have the holy ghost
[25:31] because the holy ghost was not yet given
[25:34] but when the spirit of the lord
[25:37] came upon samson he did things that
[25:40] normal humans can't do
[25:42] that's when the spirit comes upon you
[25:45] you don't have to have the holy ghost
[25:47] for the spirit
[25:49] to come upon you come on same as
[25:51] somebody
[25:52] so don't look at if you can't make it
[25:54] you've got to make it
[25:58] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[26:02] glory to god man
[26:03] [Applause]
[26:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[26:09] all things must be restored
[26:12] [Applause]
[26:13] glory my god amen
[26:16] hallelujah why describe the last must
[26:20] first come
[26:21] disciples only here describes preaching
[26:24] elasmus first come
[26:25] right last must first come the last must
[26:27] first come
[26:28] as he lies and jesus he said elias must
[26:32] first truly come
[26:34] present prophecy and restore all things
[26:37] but elias come already
[26:38] so you do two things here he said he
[26:40] last coming in the future
[26:42] and he last it's come already he was
[26:45] saying john the baptist he's come
[26:46] already
[26:47] but is elijah to come that elijah to
[26:50] come
[26:50] couldn't restore all things not some
[26:53] things
[26:55] come on come on i'll say ms somebody
[26:59] that elias is to come speaking about
[27:01] william branham
[27:02] speaking about malachi 4 he is to
[27:05] restore some things
[27:06] no all things and i say today all things
[27:11] has been restored the book has been
[27:14] restored
[27:15] the authority has been restored the
[27:18] pillar of fire
[27:30] so once it's restored the prophet can
[27:32] preach possession
[27:35] all things because once all things
[27:37] restored
[27:38] we could go back to how we were before
[27:41] the fall
[27:43] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you
[27:47] was in the position of power and
[27:48] authority in genesis 1 26
[27:51] the authority of god said let us make
[27:54] man
[27:55] in our own image in order like this
[27:58] and we found the secret of the harmony
[28:01] between
[28:02] adam and eve the prophet revealed that
[28:04] secret and oneness
[28:05] he said they had the nature of god adam
[28:08] had god's nature
[28:09] and eve had god nature and they were one
[28:13] come on same as somebody so the nature
[28:16] of god
[28:16] restores back harmony response back in
[28:19] unity
[28:20] that's what the nature of god does then
[28:23] if the nature is
[28:24] is dissolved or taken away you're gonna
[28:27] get problems
[28:28] you're gonna get this unity you're gonna
[28:30] get things out of salt isn't that right
[28:32] are you with me oh hallelujah
[28:36] so they're not their pentecost isn't
[28:38] that right yeah
[28:39] hallelujah pentecost he said there's
[28:41] gonna be a wave in again
[28:43] the son of man is to be wave over the
[28:45] people who's the son of man
[28:47] in the beginning was the word the word
[28:49] was with god is not right
[28:50] and we find out that the word again is
[28:53] to be waved
[28:54] over the people that the dead traditions
[28:57] of men is dead
[28:58] and the son of god is alive with the
[29:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[29:02] and is giving us life amen oh
[29:05] hallelujah so the word of promise has to
[29:07] be wave over the people
[29:09] notice what god does he doesn't wait for
[29:12] you to be ready
[29:13] to give you
[29:19] hallelujah he give you before you're
[29:24] ready
[29:26] you know you're going to make yourself
[29:27] ready
[29:28] [Applause]
[29:34] you maybe see this he didn't feel
[29:38] or wait for david to feel like a king
[29:41] to anoint david
[29:44] he told saul god anoint a king for me
[29:47] out of the sons of jesus not a king to
[29:50] be
[29:51] he's a king in my eyes he told gideon

[42:45] let's start see the possibility and the
[42:47] possibility make you pray
[42:49] because the first thing devil does is
[42:50] take prayer away from you you take it
[42:52] out of your mouth
[42:53] you can't even feel to pray the thought
[42:56] to pray don't even

[43:08] blind get his power and omnipotence
[43:11] blind
[43:12] to his power deliverance for your life
[43:15] but
[43:15] once you see a possibility then the
[43:18] prayer
[43:18] is restored to your lips and in your
[43:21] lips are power
[43:23] prayer power speaking power
[43:27] there is power got somebody it is there
[43:32] i said it again you want me let's pour
[43:35] in your lips
[43:39] that amen is not good enough i'm saying
[43:42] to you there's power in your lips
[43:44] [Applause]
[43:50] there is power in your lips when you
[43:53] pray
[43:54] the devil tremble because you don't know
[43:57] what god will do with your
[43:59] prayer
[44:00] [Applause]
[44:03] remember do you understand
[44:07] that the prayers of the saints is stored
[44:09] in vials
[44:12] [Applause]
[44:14] your prayers
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:33] look at the abraham god told abraham
[44:37] through sarah you're gonna have that son
[44:38] of promise god
[44:40] did not speak to sarah so there was a
[44:43] problem to begin with
[44:47] sarah did not hear from god
[44:51] abraham to tell sarah god told me
[44:54] that you're going to have my child
[44:56] [Music]
[44:58] amen all right sarah i'm all right to
[45:02] say
[45:03] all right well i ain't sure about that
[45:05] my mind
[45:06] because i don't know you're too old
[45:11] because that was all right praise god
[45:13] abraham wright was to tell him tell her
[45:15] but god said sure
[45:18] sarah to tell abram but i don't believe
[45:20] it
[45:21] and abram tells sarah it doesn't matter
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:26] so because the lord
[45:32] [Applause]
[45:34] the bible said abraham
[45:37] believe god amen
[45:41] now watch it's one thing to believe god
[45:45] is the next thing to encourage somebody
[45:47] about what you believe
[45:52] after five years of encouraging sarah
[45:55] every morning is the same face with some
[45:57] more wrinkles
[46:00] after five years abraham don't know you
[46:03] have
[46:03] plenty more of those
[46:07] you're not hearing me this morning
[46:11] abraham don't know he has plenty more
[46:14] come on sarah god is good
[46:17] sarah don't forget to cook that morning
[46:20] she don't feel to make
[46:21] breakfast this morning she is frustrated
[46:24] and
[46:24] set up of hearing the testimony which is
[46:27] the spirit of prophecy
[46:29] she's tired of hearing abraham say god
[46:31] said so
[46:32] god going to be with us god going to
[46:34] bless her she's tired
[46:35] amen but abram was not tired because
[46:38] when god speaks to a man
[46:41] it gives him faith it gives him ambition
[46:44] and it gives him purpose
[46:48] a man that god speaks to can't
[46:51] give up come on now you must know
[46:54] a man that god has spoken to
[46:58] oh give the lord a shout of prayer
[47:01] [Applause]
[47:09] a woman that god speaks to you can't
[47:11] stop that woman
[47:12] look when the angel spoke to mary she's
[47:14] a young person
[47:16] she's not a big mature adult she's a
[47:18] young person
[47:19] and the angel says i heal mary you
[47:22] highly favored the lord is with thee she
[47:25] doesn't know that
[47:26] this is news the lord is with you
[47:31] all she had is one question how shall it
[47:33] be the holy ghost
[47:36] god i tell mary you are the holy ghost
[47:38] forget it the whole ego is continuing
[47:40] you isn't that right what did mary do
[47:43] she ran
[47:45] come on now that's what i'm talking when
[47:47] god speaks to you you have to act
[47:49] she runs her custody elizabeth to tell
[47:52] elizabeth i'm hoping to have a baby
[47:54] no she said i'm gonna have the christ
[47:58] his name is jesus and john
[48:02] waiting to hear his name
[48:05] based in the year jesus john was quiet
[48:08] all the time
[48:09] until he heard that name john started to
[48:12] rejoice
[48:13] in the womb of elizabeth nothing
[48:15] happened by chance
[48:17] come and say him and somebody your baby
[48:20] is dead
[48:21] your baby written he had the name and
[48:23] the word manifested
[48:24] is the interpretation of the name of god
[48:27] come on then seven times gonna roar out
[48:30] oh same as somebody you think you
[48:34] are dead but you are not you are waiting
[48:36] for the right word to be
[48:37] spoken for the right thing to be done
[48:40] that we could dash into the blessings of
[48:42] god maybe that might strike this morning
[48:49] oh hallelujah a possibility
[48:53] that's what samson saw and you could say
[48:56] once more
[48:57] once more once more because i had it
[49:00] before
[49:01] yeah i'm not saying i'm not hearing you
[49:03] once more means i had it before
[49:05] give me it once more and when we talk
[49:08] about redemption
[49:10] being redeemed not salvation
[49:13] being redeemed means you were somewhere
[49:15] before
[49:17] and we fail and god is bringing us back
[49:20] from a fallen condition so don't do like
[49:23] it then
[49:24] you're not part of the fall
[49:30] so i hope we take a box shot
[49:33] and blow out every self-righteous spirit
[49:37] in this building who think they're more
[49:39] right than who
[49:40] who take the more holier than who who
[49:42] think this and i forget about
[49:44] it for all have sinned and come short
[49:48] of the glory but god said
[49:51] he's going to restore and nothing going
[49:53] to stop it
[49:55] oh glory to god hallelujah nothing going
[49:58] to stop
[49:59] this restoration samson was the type of
[50:02] it
[50:03] and this tree that jordan saw the type
[50:05] of it let's get on into it oh praise
[50:07] god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[50:11] listen to this
[50:13] whoa oh my the first time there will
[50:15] come forth for the bright age
[50:17] a resurrection of that denominationalism
[50:20] will be a message
[50:21] and that's what we struck when we talk
[50:23] about the world being born into
[50:24] manifestation
[50:26] the brother branham prophesy that there
[50:28] will comfort a message
[50:30] that the full maturity of the world
[50:35] has turned again in its full
[50:38] power turning back against full power
[50:40] and being way
[50:41] over the people with the same signs
[50:44] wonders
[50:45] and miracles so god can't afford to have
[50:48] immature people
[50:50] manage power they will mess things up
[50:53] so god had to let the world take its
[50:55] full maturity
[50:56] the greenness baked out through trials
[51:00] and
[51:00] testings and so on isn't that right oh
[51:03] listen from bamboom
[51:04] lucas conglomerate caterpillar 1953
[51:08] 12th june by the brown during the time
[51:11] of joyous prophecy here speaking of the
[51:13] scripture we read
[51:14] amen the church was in a terrible
[51:15] condition backslid
[51:17] just prior the coming of the lord for
[51:19] the first time how the spirit come upon
[51:21] this prophet
[51:22] he forced all things he saw the
[51:24] condition of the jews he saw the
[51:26] condition of the church in this day
[51:27] now this prophecy of course like all
[51:30] other prophecy has a compound meaning
[51:34] a prophecy sometimes has a natural
[51:36] meaning then it has a spiritual meaning
[51:39] but it has a meaning listen of the last
[51:43] days
[51:44] towards the armageddon so the prophet
[51:48] with his prophetic eyes looking at this
[51:51] scripture
[51:52] fleshing it out pulling it out revealing
[51:54] it to
[51:55] show it connected to us in the last days
[51:59] now listen to these words he said now
[52:02] uh towards the armageddon the coming up
[52:05] of the last days
[52:06] the condition of the church spiritually
[52:08] in the last days
[52:10] now there are four great things here i
[52:12] want to mention
[52:13] that joel the prophet who was god's
[52:15] eagle
[52:16] climb up into the sphere of god and saw
[52:19] the day coming
[52:20] and joel saw it coming and i want to
[52:23] speak on the four great destroyers first
[52:25] it was the palmer one
[52:26] next was the lucas next was the
[52:29] cankerworm
[52:30] and the next was the caterpillar those
[52:32] destroyers were destroying
[52:34] the heritage of god divine
[52:38] oh hallelujah now you will check closely
[52:40] on your insects
[52:42] those four insects are the same insects
[52:46] in different form amen caterpillar
[52:49] lucas conquer women and so forth isn't
[52:52] that right
[52:52] just different forms if pentecost was
[52:55] god's vine
[52:57] which was the new vine that growed up
[52:59] let's find
[53:00] out what pentecost had and find out what
[53:03] we got lacking
[53:04] and then we ought to find out what the
[53:06] destroyer are and who they
[53:08] are and what did it right so are you
[53:10] with me this morning
[53:11] yes here we go are you ready is
[53:14] everybody ready say amen
[53:16] are you ready hallelujah that's funny
[53:19] and good people feeling literally
[53:21] ready the first thing that pentecost
[53:23] produced was brotherly love
[53:29] not the second not the third
[53:33] the first amendment it tore down the
[53:36] middle wall of partitions
[53:38] and meet brotherhood in such a way that
[53:41] everything in common in the bible
[53:43] paul spoke at his brotherhood he gave
[53:45] all the gifts of pentecost to church he
[53:46] said first corinthians do i speak with
[53:48] the tongue of men and angels
[53:49] i have not this love which brings the
[53:51] brotherhood
[53:52] i am nothing and do i have knowledge to
[53:55] understand
[53:56] all the mysteries of god i am still
[53:59] nothing without love the love of the
[54:01] brethren
[54:02] and jesus said this shall all men know
[54:05] my disciples
[54:06] that you have loved one for another
[54:08] isn't not right and jesus paul said
[54:11] let brother love continue that wasn't
[54:14] the first church
[54:15] but something taking place and then this
[54:17] fellow came by the name of palmer
[54:19] and he began to eat on the vine of
[54:22] bradley love
[54:25] has a mission his missiles and
[54:28] and weapons is for burnley love once you
[54:31] see bright love
[54:32] eating away got him
[54:38] all right so let's go down further now
[54:42] now watch okay let's let's read
[54:43] something here this is 85.
[54:46] now the pentecostal church comparing the
[54:48] two what happened
[54:49] he said no notice the first gif is
[54:51] wisdom the best gift
[54:53] and so on he said now hear this now
[54:56] i want to speak to ministers it's all
[54:58] right to have the nomination there's
[54:59] nothing
[55:00] against that but when the nomination
[55:03] isolate himself and separates his
[55:05] fellowship
[55:06] from his brethren that old company has
[55:09] eat the life out of it to begin with
[55:11] when we get to a place if you differ
[55:14] with a man
[55:14] why a man that i know i could i could
[55:16] see eye to eye with
[55:17] as close and scripted as anybody in the
[55:19] world is brother more sitting here
[55:21] now listen to what brother brown said
[55:22] here but we get times when we are
[55:24] million miles apart
[55:26] but didn't ever touch us no sir
[55:29] with his little wife over yonder
[55:31] answering the phone so much
[55:32] until she got almost a nervous breakdown
[55:34] last night crying on the phone
[55:37] oh praise the lord and he loves me well
[55:38] enough not because he gives a penny or
[55:40] money no sir
[55:41] but he flies that whole lockheed plane
[55:43] everything else to get over here to be
[55:44] with me
[55:45] every little bit i don't believe the
[55:47] night would ever be too dark
[55:48] or the rain would ever fall too hard but
[55:51] i'll climb
[55:52] and crawl to the jungles to get to him
[55:54] it's love
[55:55] yet we wouldn't agree unscripted by a
[55:58] hundred miles
[56:06] i am so glad that the palmer hasn't
[56:09] touched us yet but
[56:16] once cameron will touch you yeah what
[56:17] happened to fellowship
[56:21] so it has nothing to do with doctrine of
[56:24] what somebody believed
[56:26] love have nothing to do with somebody
[56:27] believe i show you love your mother or
[56:29] your father your brother is standing not
[56:31] in church with you
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:38] they're not going to your church but you
[56:40] love them
[56:41] because that's your mother or that's
[56:43] your uncle whether that's your auntie or
[56:44] whatever it is you love them
[56:46] they're glad to see them all right
[56:49] you ever see a dog vex the city master
[56:52] well you don't see myself
[56:53] you don't just turn around and just
[56:54] start walking
[56:56] there's another
[57:01] [Music]
[57:05] make his noises and back and so on why
[57:07] because the dog loves his master
[57:10] it's not right it's a lot of my way i'm
[57:12] showing it
[57:14] and if you keep running that dog you
[57:15] don't watch it still for you no he'll be
[57:17] angry at you
[57:19] why because you're not friendly with him
[57:22] you're not nice with him
[57:23] isn't that right praise the name of the
[57:26] lord
[57:27] but i went to a church here not long ago
[57:29] i thought they would never invite me
[57:31] back
[57:32] a bunch of simply woman but they was
[57:34] bobbing off their hair
[57:35] wearing lipstick i tore the thing apart
[57:37] sure did
[57:39] and i thought he would have feedback but
[57:41] you know what there was such
[57:43] an anointing of the holy spirit around
[57:45] the vine
[57:46] still like all power couldn't touch it
[57:48] at all
[57:49] it's like an electric fence the palmer
[57:52] worm can't get over the
[57:54] fence the shock of the holy spirit of
[57:56] love
[57:58] it will kill him every time brother
[58:01] if we need fences to build it ought not
[58:03] to be the enormous offenses
[58:04] it ought to be love fences to keep the
[58:07] insect out
[58:09] to keep the palmer worm out
[58:12] because he is the number one destroyer
[58:16] listen to this i don't care what a man
[58:19] believes
[58:20] whatever he believes he's got a right to
[58:23] come right back and tell me
[58:25] he don't believe these the things i've
[58:27] got the right to say little things that
[58:29] he doesn't believe
[58:30] but i don't belong to a pinnacle
[58:32] denomination because pentecost is not a
[58:34] denomination
[58:35] it is an experience oh blessed be the
[58:38] name of the lord
[58:40] praise the name of the lord are you with
[58:42] me
[58:43] the next thing come was the locust so
[58:46] first
[58:47] the fruit eat brotherly love
[58:50] food eaten next it come the locals come
[58:52] for the leaves
[58:54] and the leaves is the unity amen amen
[58:56] isn't that right
[58:57] he said okay america and he is the one
[58:59] who destroyed the unity of the believers
[59:02] in pentecost there was a unity isn't
[59:04] that right oh blessed be the name of the
[59:06] lord
[59:08] hallelujah praise the lord
[59:11] praise god so there's only one church
[59:14] there might be branded baptist
[59:15] presbyterian
[59:16] but it's only it's got to be a
[59:18] born-again experience
[59:20] so this locus what did it do they eat
[59:22] the leaves and they take the leaves what
[59:24] the parmesan left
[59:25] so them fellas work in a chef system
[59:29] one eat the fruit one eat the leaves
[59:32] and that's coming from the back and it's
[59:34] coming for the life itself
[59:36] that is the order of attack oh
[59:38] hallelujah just strip the church of his
[59:41] power
[59:41] yeah let something take god bloody love
[59:44] let something take all the leaves of
[59:45] fellowship
[59:46] let something take on the back of
[59:47] doctrine then there's only one thing
[59:48] left it's exposed now
[59:50] take and hit the light church is dead
[59:53] forms and they had the priests and they
[59:56] had a pulpit and they have the ministers
[59:58] and everything else
[59:59] and god move on because it kills it
[1:00:02] right there
[1:00:03] what did this uh lucas did destroy the
[1:00:06] leaves what at least for
[1:00:08] divine fellowship now he's a
[1:00:09] presbyterian we won't have nothing to do
[1:00:11] with him
[1:00:12] he's a nazarene he's pentecostal just
[1:00:14] that we won't have to do with him
[1:00:15] because he don't belong to our group
[1:00:20] that he look us at work yes yes are you
[1:00:23] with me
[1:00:24] amen what did the locusts do it took
[1:00:27] away
[1:00:27] fellowship what is fellowship what does
[1:00:29] the leaves do it make it cool
[1:00:31] where the birds fly under the leaves
[1:00:34] isn't that right
[1:00:34] and he should be like a tree planted
[1:00:36] when you look frustrated you come into
[1:00:38] the group and so on
[1:00:39] and you have a russian might you win and
[1:00:40] the leaves blow you get some fellowship
[1:00:43] you feel encouraged you feel revived
[1:00:45] that is what
[1:00:46] the leaves are for the lucas come to eat
[1:00:49] the leaves down
[1:00:50] go talk to this one go fellowship with
[1:00:52] this one don't go to convention by that
[1:00:54] one
[1:00:55] don't go to church by that one have
[1:00:56] nothing to do with that one that's the
[1:00:58] locust eaten
[1:00:59] that's a local spirit that's what i'll
[1:01:02] be loose in this message
[1:01:06] and some pastors welcome the local
[1:01:08] spirit
[1:01:17] he's a doctrine guy all kind of cuckoo
[1:01:20] stuff
[1:01:21] strip original doctrine you can't fight
[1:01:22] fighting the bible they could find the
[1:01:24] message but people preaching what kind
[1:01:26] of cuckoo stuff
[1:01:26] and then afterwards the last one is take
[1:01:29] the life
[1:01:30] there's not something there but you know
[1:01:32] what god said i will restore
[1:01:34] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:01:37] praise his holy name
[1:01:39] praise jesus jesus hallelujah hallelujah

[1:01:44] god amen now watch all of his former
[1:01:48] glory

[1:01:53] to shake the trees and every time you
[1:01:55] get a shaken
[1:01:56] it loosen up the root and cause you to
[1:01:59] go
[1:02:00] deeper and deeper and every time the
[1:02:02] holy ghost falls on the church
[1:02:04] in an old-fashioned revival it's shake
[1:02:07] up the roots
[1:02:08] so that it can get rooted and grounded
[1:02:11] that the storms and trial come upon it
[1:02:13] isn't that right
[1:02:14] i will restore seer the lord all of his
[1:02:16] former days have been eaten down
[1:02:18] one took out the baptismal one took all
[1:02:21] the joy out
[1:02:22] another took the holy ghost out another
[1:02:24] took healing out another took the kiss
[1:02:26] out
[1:02:26] and the first thing you know you ain't
[1:02:27] got no more but an old dead bleak bush
[1:02:30] standing there
[1:02:31] but somewhere under there god reserve
[1:02:34] life is coming on oh blessed be the name
[1:02:37] of the lord
[1:02:38] isn't that right the church here we go

[1:03:17] supposed to have a church with jesus

[1:04:05] lord so help me i make this prophecy
[1:04:08] before the coming of the lord the true
[1:04:12] apostolic fate the true apostolic
[1:04:15] teaching
[1:04:15] the true bible spirit the true it's on
[1:04:18] his word right now

[1:04:22] again supper the banana prophecy the
[1:04:24] true apostle
[1:04:25] spirit will be restored to the church in
[1:04:27] the last days
[1:04:28] it's not right you believe that isn't
[1:04:31] that right
[1:04:32] you saw you say four dead messengers eat
[1:04:35] down the tree isn't that right
[1:04:36] and four life messengers was gonna
[1:04:39] restore it
[1:04:40] so god raised up luther isn't that right
[1:04:42] praise god and wesley and pentecost and
[1:04:44] then he said william random with the
[1:04:45] word
[1:04:46] isn't that right abraham fate isn't that
[1:04:48] right isaac love
[1:04:50] jacob craze i'm joseph the capstone word
[1:04:53] the headstone
[1:04:54] word perfection so god put the
[1:04:56] perfection word to restore
[1:04:58] to get us back into position for the
[1:05:00] fullness of the power
[1:05:01] to come back amongst the people oh i
[1:05:03] feel good this morning
[1:05:05] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:05:08] lord do you believe that
[1:05:10] four killers stick it out four
[1:05:12] messengers destroyed it
[1:05:13] and four misses of death took it away
[1:05:16] and god sent four messengers of life
[1:05:18] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:20] praise god do you believe that
[1:05:22] first line justification then
[1:05:24] signification
[1:05:25] then the baptism the holy ghost then the
[1:05:28] coming of the cap what is it
[1:05:29] the holy ghost bunch being hold out so
[1:05:32] it can fit with the same kind of
[1:05:33] ministry
[1:05:34] so what are we talking about god
[1:05:36] promised a holy ghost bunch
[1:05:38] not an intellectual bunch a holy ghost
[1:05:42] bunch
[1:05:43] a bunch of people filled with the holy
[1:05:44] ghost
[1:05:48] that he could now begin to cut and shape
[1:05:51] and prune and hone to fit you in with
[1:05:54] the same kind of ministry
[1:05:59] because eve wasn't another creation eve
[1:06:02] came
[1:06:02] out of adam
[1:06:06] and the bride came out from christ
[1:06:10] so the bride came from out of the word
[1:06:12] so the bread can be off the word
[1:06:15] because you come from the word itself
[1:06:18] so when the word is preached the bride
[1:06:20] will say amen
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:27] oh my god oh blessed be the lord
[1:06:31] so he finally got trevor mystery number
[1:06:33] one to reveal himself
[1:06:34] he was too mysterious he did it in
[1:06:36] christ number two
[1:06:38] to have the preeminence in the people
[1:06:39] called the bride
[1:06:41] number three to restore about the
[1:06:42] kingdom why would god restore
[1:06:44] the kingdom and there's no evil
[1:06:48] eve and adam was placed in the garden of
[1:06:50] eden
[1:06:51] isn't that right that's the place where
[1:06:54] he placed the man and woman
[1:06:55] the man fell and got kicked him out no
[1:06:58] car's going to restore that eden
[1:07:00] not to say i have a nice healer no he
[1:07:03] has to restore that evil
[1:07:05] back into the original into the evening
[1:07:07] again
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:09] the devil is filling because god purpose
[1:07:12] can be
[1:07:13] god purpose can't be stopped so when the
[1:07:16] devil thought he was finished
[1:07:18] what he didn't know is that i will
[1:07:19] restore
[1:07:21] because there is coming a second atom
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:25] that second arm is jesus christ he's
[1:07:28] coming for you
[1:07:30] hallelujah you and i we are fallen eve
[1:07:34] oh hallelujah to take us back to eden
[1:07:37] we are going back somewhere we don't
[1:07:40] belong here
[1:07:42] oh do you believe that oh praise god
[1:07:45] oh hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:07:50] my my mind are you ready for some deeper
[1:07:53] stuff
[1:07:54] i'm on you ready for some deeper stuff
[1:07:57] what
[1:07:58] oh a great revelation now to restore
[1:08:00] back his kinship
[1:08:01] to bring back now he had to let them get
[1:08:04] lost
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:09] that's deep that's very deep
[1:08:12] he had to let them
[1:08:15] get lost he could not make them sin
[1:08:28] he could not make them sin and remain
[1:08:30] god and then punish him for something he
[1:08:36] made
[1:08:38] but when we put man on partnership with
[1:08:41] him and let man act as a free
[1:08:43] moral agent you act
[1:08:47] any way you want to you are a free moral
[1:08:50] agent so therefore if he put the first
[1:08:53] like this
[1:08:54] he has to put the second like this he
[1:08:56] had to put everybody on the same basis
[1:08:58] now notice in bringing back in
[1:09:01] letting that man do that knowing he
[1:09:04] would do that
[1:09:05] what did he do to display his attribute
[1:09:08] as a savior
[1:09:10] the whole purpose is left in jesus
[1:09:12] christ
[1:09:13] to become god to take the penalty of
[1:09:15] death
[1:09:16] to redeem the wife that was lost by
[1:09:19] rejecting him
[1:09:21] so when you see the picture of garden of
[1:09:23] eden you see it
[1:09:24] beautiful now when you see it in his
[1:09:26] fullness of his revelation
[1:09:28] that god had all these attributes locked
[1:09:30] up in him
[1:09:31] and he couldn't reveal it until man fall
[1:09:34] he couldn't take man and push him down
[1:09:35] he couldn't say man trip yourself and
[1:09:37] fall no you have to leave man
[1:09:40] let the decisions and choices work out
[1:09:44] so when the devil thought he had won on
[1:09:47] god god had one on him
[1:09:51] when the devil thought he was throwing
[1:09:53] down god's whole
[1:09:55] future and plan what the devil didn't
[1:09:57] understand
[1:09:58] is that this give god the opportunity to
[1:10:00] unveil
[1:10:01] himself reveal himself in the fullness
[1:10:05] of his redemption
[1:10:06] plan
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] so whether as a bride which is fallen
[1:10:12] eve or as a tree
[1:10:14] i will restore
[1:10:17] because the devil came and knocked on
[1:10:19] eve in the beginning
[1:10:21] then when god turned into tree form
[1:10:23] bright tree he come with his counter
[1:10:25] woman caterpillar to eat on the tree
[1:10:27] until they come into a stump until his
[1:10:29] thumbs at the prophet's eye
[1:10:31] i'm coming back the devil have no more
[1:10:34] teeth
[1:10:34] to eat it was finished there was nothing
[1:10:37] more to eat
[1:10:39] so now when we start to move up
[1:10:41] nothing's gonna stop this
[1:10:42] right i wonder if you're getting what
[1:10:46] i'm saying
[1:10:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:55] listen along the way as the nomination
[1:10:58] form got cut off this branch cut off
[1:11:00] this branch cut on his badge
[1:11:01] but this tree that was eaten down to the
[1:11:05] stump
[1:11:06] when this had to push out nothing is
[1:11:08] cutting off you know
[1:11:10] this is i will restore this is god
[1:11:13] himself
[1:11:15] in the seed in you fulfilling his own
[1:11:18] prophecy
[1:11:19] come on now this is god fulfilling the
[1:11:21] prophecy
[1:11:22] in your life to raise you up
[1:11:26] where you belong come on out and lift
[1:11:28] you up
[1:11:32] oh man do you see that this morning
[1:11:36] hallelujah you may be seated oh
[1:11:39] hallelujah
[1:11:41] it got to be inspired to you you got to
[1:11:43] understand
[1:11:45] that eve was fallen and god wouldn't
[1:11:47] leave her fallen
[1:11:48] if god leave him full that the devil had
[1:11:51] the upper hand
[1:11:52] then the devil could taught and throw
[1:11:54] and to change
[1:11:55] god's purpose and plan but god has to
[1:11:57] bring back eve
[1:11:59] to prove to the devil this eve that will
[1:12:01] not fall
[1:12:02] he said this bride is different this
[1:12:04] despite different
[1:12:06] listen you will be seated the difference
[1:12:08] between this eve
[1:12:10] the first even this eve is this the
[1:12:12] first eve was hiding behind the world
[1:12:15] but this eve is the word
[1:12:22] glory are you see what i'm saying now
[1:12:24] the first evil
[1:12:25] she was supposed to stay behind the word
[1:12:28] that was given to her by your husband
[1:12:31] amen god said this
[1:12:34] but this eve is different this eve
[1:12:38] becomes the word and the word
[1:12:42] cannot be defeated anywhere
[1:12:45] anytime under any condition the world
[1:12:50] can never be defeated jesus proved that
[1:12:54] but he said it is written it is written
[1:12:55] it is also written
[1:12:59] oh hallelujah that's why the devil james
[1:13:02] is try to get you off the wood
[1:13:05] because once you get off the world you
[1:13:06] get off the power
[1:13:08] you get off your strength oh are you
[1:13:10] with me you may be seated
[1:13:12] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:13:16] to notice in bringing that back and
[1:13:19] letting man do that
[1:13:21] knowing what he would do he displaced
[1:13:23] actually the savior
[1:13:25] and when eve went away from the word she
[1:13:27] went away from a mate
[1:13:29] and when the church goes away from the
[1:13:30] word to denomination
[1:13:33] she rejects and comments fornication
[1:13:35] with the world of man's
[1:13:37] wisdom and rejecting the authority of
[1:13:41] god's word
[1:13:42] not when the bride or the church or a
[1:13:45] member leave a church
[1:13:46] she committed adultery because it passes
[1:13:48] the husband to her
[1:13:49] that is foolishness that is nonsense
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:53] that that applies in a certain context
[1:13:55] you
[1:13:56] as christ's wife he is your husband and
[1:14:00] he
[1:14:00] is the word if the man preached the word
[1:14:03] you are hearing direct from your husband
[1:14:06] if the man don't preach the word he is
[1:14:08] off there's another man
[1:14:10] that you're hearing from but christ is
[1:14:11] the word and as long as we preach the
[1:14:14] word you are hearing from your husband
[1:14:17] who is your maid the revealed word
[1:14:20] is your husband isn't that right
[1:14:23] okay so watch okay
[1:14:27] now notice his threefold purpose the
[1:14:29] manifest himself
[1:14:30] and jesus have the preeminences now we
[1:14:33] see the mystery
[1:14:34] he had hit before the foundation of the
[1:14:36] world praise god and he's had to read it
[1:14:38] didn't want to get to paul an apostle of
[1:14:40] jesus christ
[1:14:41] by the will of god now it's not
[1:14:42] addressed to the world but his address
[1:14:46] to the at the emphasis to the saints
[1:14:48] isn't that right
[1:14:49] amen how do you get into christ by
[1:14:52] joining church no by
[1:14:53] birth now watch grace be unto you
[1:14:57] and peace heavenly places i wish i had
[1:14:58] time here to mark that
[1:15:00] it's the believer's position in christ
[1:15:02] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:15:04] before the foundation of the world when
[1:15:06] did he choose us
[1:15:08] before the foundation of the world when
[1:15:10] this great
[1:15:11] hidden mystery he chose us in christ
[1:15:14] before the foundation of the world here
[1:15:15] we go watch
[1:15:17] i have predestinated us
[1:15:20] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[1:15:22] christ himself according to good
[1:15:23] pleasure of his will
[1:15:24] here we go this is where i get my
[1:15:26] inspiration from predestinated
[1:15:28] there's the mystery he before christ or
[1:15:32] anything else was ever on earth
[1:15:34] you see this great mystery that he would
[1:15:36] choose in
[1:15:37] a choose a bride knowing eve would fall
[1:15:41] from disbelieving the word knowing she
[1:15:45] would fall
[1:15:46] but he would choose a bride that would
[1:15:49] not fall
[1:15:50] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:15:53] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:15:54] say about it
[1:15:55] amen now you see the secret what to to
[1:15:58] restore
[1:15:58] for eve so the great secret
[1:16:03] with god unfolding with abraham faith
[1:16:05] and isaac love and jacob
[1:16:07] all of that all the prophets all the
[1:16:10] sages and so forth all of that was to
[1:16:13] bring forth a bride
[1:16:16] so he was only expressing and joseph
[1:16:19] expressing in moses apart
[1:16:21] apart in jacob apart mysteries being
[1:16:24] unfolded
[1:16:25] as these brothers and sisters live their
[1:16:26] lives out
[1:16:28] he was expressing in part what he was
[1:16:31] going to do in his fullness in the last
[1:16:32] days
[1:16:34] oh hallelujah are you with me
[1:16:38] so watch he said god took a rib from
[1:16:40] under his side
[1:16:41] and took eve out of it and god did the
[1:16:44] same thing taking out the side of christ
[1:16:45] the blood the water
[1:16:47] and christ is the word and taking the
[1:16:49] word
[1:16:50] and making up his church making up his
[1:16:52] church
[1:16:54] from the word isn't that right back to
[1:16:56] himself god
[1:16:57] great mystery being unfolded prefigured
[1:16:59] all the way on down
[1:17:00] oh praise the name of the lord the pride
[1:17:03] oh here we go
[1:17:04] praise be to jesus what did he do he
[1:17:07] opened adam's side took part of his
[1:17:08] flesh which was adam to make eve
[1:17:10] the bride here we go has to be the word
[1:17:13] for he is the word she cannot stand on
[1:17:16] creeds
[1:17:17] she cannot stand on the nomination she
[1:17:19] cannot stand on good behavior
[1:17:22] did you hear that she can't even stand
[1:17:25] on good behavior
[1:17:26] she has to stand alone on the word
[1:17:29] for she is part of it for she was taken
[1:17:32] from christ
[1:17:33] do you understand how much of the world
[1:17:35] you must become you can't
[1:17:37] act because somebody act like that no is
[1:17:39] that the word
[1:17:42] well this husband behave so is that the
[1:17:44] word this wife behave like that
[1:17:46] is that the word it has to come back to
[1:17:48] the world
[1:17:49] are you with me okay here we go
[1:17:53] this is serious and to be sure
[1:17:56] the whole rapture now luther was apart
[1:17:58] whereas he was a part
[1:18:00] the prophet was apart just in the
[1:18:02] revelation that they were making up the
[1:18:04] body
[1:18:05] you mean lute is a part of the rapture
[1:18:06] that's right we shall not hinder those
[1:18:08] that are asleep
[1:18:12] that are sleeping is part of the whole
[1:18:13] rapture you know it's a bright body
[1:18:15] this is not the entire body you know
[1:18:17] this is the capstone headstone ride
[1:18:19] we had a cap and the rest is in the
[1:18:21] ground and we like that head mark
[1:18:23] they're gonna pull them out of the
[1:18:24] ground
[1:18:25] but all that is in the ground they are
[1:18:27] bright who receive the word for their
[1:18:29] age
[1:18:30] they are bright members already sealed
[1:18:32] away in christ
[1:18:34] hallelujah waiting for the resurrection
[1:18:36] call
[1:18:37] waiting for the trumpeter's song waiting
[1:18:39] for the trump of god
[1:18:41] isn't that right they are in the earth
[1:18:43] waiting for the voice of the archangel
[1:18:45] resurrection call are you with me
[1:18:48] hallelujah so watch just in the
[1:18:52] revelation
[1:18:52] they were making up the body feet toes
[1:18:55] arms
[1:18:56] until the head that makes the entire
[1:18:59] rapture
[1:19:00] it's the body of the word amen
[1:19:04] which is christ outside of that you are
[1:19:07] lost
[1:19:10] i don't feel good you are what your
[1:19:12] relationship is
[1:19:14] what your fellowship is what your
[1:19:16] organization is
[1:19:17] you are lost outside the world being in
[1:19:20] you
[1:19:22] and then he went under quotes in john 15
[1:19:24] if he abided me
[1:19:25] and my word abide in you you can ask
[1:19:27] what you will or you're going to bring
[1:19:28] forth fruit and much fruit and so forth
[1:19:31] isn't that right so it means if the word
[1:19:33] is in you that if he abided me and my
[1:19:35] words are burning away
[1:19:36] you're gonna ask what you will you'll be
[1:19:37] a bride of authority this ain't gonna
[1:19:39] be a jokey bride this is not church
[1:19:40] member pride this be a pride will be
[1:19:42] just like jesus christ
[1:19:45] this will be jesus in bright form
[1:19:51] oh glory you'll be healed like him
[1:19:53] you'll be praying like him
[1:19:54] you'll be cast out devils like him
[1:19:56] you'll be raising a dead like him
[1:19:58] oh yes he'll be performing miracles like
[1:20:00] him because it will be him inside of you
[1:20:03] oh glory to god the signs and wonders
[1:20:06] will be evident
[1:20:08] of the preeminence inside of your life
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:14] that would vindicate the second part of
[1:20:16] his threefold mystery to have the
[1:20:18] preeminence and a bride
[1:20:20] so the revelation is to bring on
[1:20:21] preeminence how could we have
[1:20:23] preeminences and have to strike i am
[1:20:25] nothing

[1:20:59] revelation

[1:21:05] preeminences self must get kicked out
[1:21:08] [Music]

[1:21:12] vanishing of demons

[1:31:54] not by organization not by denomination
[1:31:57] but by the holy
[1:31:58] spirit god will bring for the church in
[1:32:00] the last days
