[50:12] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[50:15] times some shall depart from the faith
[50:18] amen giving heed to seducing spirits and
[50:23] doctrines of devils verse six if thou

[50:39] thou has
[50:40] attained and also from
[50:43] Ephesians
[50:46] 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh
[50:48] and blood but against
[50:52] principalities against Powers against
[50:55] against rulers of the darkness of this
[50:57] world against spiritual wickedness in
[51:00] high places four things have been
[51:01] identified here we wrestle not against
[51:04] flesh and blood but against one
[51:05] principalities two Powers three rulers
[51:09] of Darkness of this world and four
[51:11] spiritual wickedness in high place let
[51:13] us pray one more time father we thank
[51:15] you for your word and Lord It's shaking
[51:18] and enlightening to see in the word and
[51:21] it's almost like if the Bible become a
[51:22] new book oh God shine light on your word
[51:24] for us this morning morning in Jesus
[51:25] name I ask it amen and amen you may be
[51:28] seated oh praise the Lord trust the Lord
[51:31] that dealing with your heart I trust
[51:33] that you're pressing the battle and I
[51:35] trust the Lord that you're
[51:37] wrestling um that's what we shared in
[51:38] prayer meeting we wrestle you had to
[51:41] fight wrestle rolling on the ground amen
[51:42] you're groaning you're travailing you're
[51:44] wrestling amen and I said something in
[51:47] the prayer meeting that I never said
[51:49] before about the woman with
[51:52] the uh daughter Vex with the Devil
[51:56] and um she said it's not Jesus told her
[51:59] it's not fit to take the children's
[52:00] bread and give it to dogs and she stood
[52:02] there instead of fussing and carrying on
[52:05] she stood there and said even the dogs
[52:06] take the crumbs and Jesus made an
[52:09] amazing statement and says for this
[52:11] sining your daughter is made whole that
[52:14] means you could say the right thing and
[52:16] have a a effect in in your family you
[52:20] understand so in other words your words
[52:22] could affect your family and I happened
[52:24] to just spill out that the opposite is
[52:26] also true you could say the wrong thing
[52:28] and bind your family and I got this
[52:30] scripture from Proverbs chapter 6 verse
[52:33] two thou are sneered with the words of
[52:36] thy mouth Thou Art taken with the words
[52:39] of thy mouth so your own words could
[52:41] bind things and loose things you could
[52:43] get sted by own so it pays to say the
[52:46] right thing it pays to be nice it pays
[52:50] to treat people nice you don't know even
[52:52] might be talking to an angel Oh Glory to
[52:55] God have no blessing in being
[52:57] disrespectful being argumentative being
[52:59] Troublesome have no real blessing in
[53:01] that amen all right so let's get to
[53:03] service this morning um the title I have
[53:06] is for we wrestle not against flesh and
[53:10] blood we for we wrestle not against
[53:13] flesh and blood but the Brandon I was
[53:17] talking to some brethren over in PTO
[53:19] Rico a few weeks ago that I seen Great
[53:21] Sea a great the great sea and a great
[53:23] storm the way was hi on this Tabernacle
[53:26] and I said you know what it hasn't got
[53:28] one more drop of water than it when it's
[53:30] perfectly calm well what does this
[53:32] churning and jumping what does it mean
[53:35] it throws all the trash out upon the
[53:38] bank and that's what the church needs is
[53:42] a Revival to shake from it all the
[53:45] worldliness and the things of the world
[53:47] and bring back Purity and Holiness of
[53:51] God in the hearts of its Believers
[53:54] humility
[53:56] man as soon as they don't get a Revival
[53:58] once in a while in their Spirit they
[54:01] become so caral so indifferent till they
[54:05] get self- styled staty and
[54:08] self-righteous that is the lacking of a
[54:11] Revival now and again in your own Spirit
[54:15] sometimes sometime you don't have to be
[54:16] canel thing to you off you know the
[54:18] disciples got thrown off by the temple
[54:20] and they say look at the temple look at
[54:22] B Stones just said don't bother with
[54:23] that and a time will come not one stone
[54:25] will be upon another Stone you know and
[54:27] but said natural thing could throw you
[54:29] off you know yes natural things like how
[54:31] Christmas come here right now paint and
[54:33] and and and vill and what kind of could
[54:35] throw you off you know because there a
[54:37] season the atmosphere that could throw
[54:38] your Plum off and you do recognize it
[54:41] throwing you off leave that for the
[54:43] people in the world to fight up with
[54:44] that worldly Spirit out there that
[54:45] Christmas spirit Christmas spirit is not
[54:46] the Holy Ghost it's a spirit you know
[54:49] but it's not God oh give the Lord some
[54:52] Praises so if you don't get a Revival

[58:26] blessed be the name of the Lord if you
[58:28] have your Bibles you can turn to Genesis
[58:30] chapter 25 we want to read 29 to 34 and
[58:33] Jacob sought pottage he cook pottage
[58:36] nice plint
[58:37] peas you I cook some myself you know
[58:41] until
[58:44] peace but I I cook it for
[58:47] me all right and Jacob said potage and
[58:51] Esau came from the field and he was
[58:53] faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I
[58:57] pray thee with the same red pottage for
[58:59] I am faint therefore was his name called
[59:01] Edom Jacob said Jacob Jacob said s me
[59:06] this day thy
[59:08] Birthright now the first born have the
[59:10] birthright Jacob said sell me this day
[59:13] thy bre esus said behold I'm at the
[59:16] point to die what prophit shall this
[59:20] Birthright do to me in other words is no
[59:23] value are you hungry
[59:26] and Jacob said swear to me this day and
[59:30] he swear unto him and he sold his
[59:33] Birthright onto Jacob then Jacob gave
[59:35] Esau bread and potage of lentil and he
[59:38] did eat and drink rose up and went his
[59:40] way thus
[59:43] Esau despite his
[59:47] birri
[59:49] hallu but BR so what a satisfaction it
[59:52] gives to us to know when you you are
[59:54] born of the spirit of God you are Sons
[59:56] and Daughters of God Jacob it meant so
[1:00:00] much to him what means what to
[1:00:05] you Jacob it meant so much to him but
[1:00:10] the birthright meant nothing to Esau
[1:00:14] frankly he despised it and I say this
[1:00:17] with all reverence his children still
[1:00:18] does he despise it what do I have to go
[1:00:22] do that for why should I receive the
[1:00:24] Holy
[1:00:25] Ghost I am good as you are the seed is
[1:00:29] my soul God call me why should I receive
[1:00:32] the Holy Ghost my religion is just as
[1:00:34] good as yours why should I go through
[1:00:35] all that here I'm just as good as you I
[1:00:37] go to church I got my name on the book
[1:00:39] you got to be born again amen it didn't
[1:00:42] mean anything to Esau he despised it and
[1:00:45] the carnal believer today still despises
[1:00:48] that Birthright and the birthright is
[1:00:51] the Holy
[1:00:52] Spirit what kind of Amen is that
[1:00:55] somebody paying you to say Amen the
[1:00:58] birthright is the Holy Spirit you could
[1:00:59] shout on that because that is what you
[1:01:01] want the birth right that's is what
[1:01:03] you're fighting for the birthright Oh
[1:01:05] Glory the birth right is what the
[1:01:08] birthright is what and Jes don't want it
[1:01:11] but Jacob want it oh G his name changed

[1:01:28] to God hallelujah I don't care what
[1:01:30] condition you're in you must want it
[1:01:32] because this is the thing that you need
[1:01:35] glory to God your roof will get back
[1:01:37] Rusty praise God this will break down
[1:01:39] that will break down but this thing is
[1:01:41] eternity we talking about here glory to
[1:01:44] God and when you die but I'm say your
[1:01:46] soul find yourself being blocked out
[1:01:48] like a tooth praise God like God like it
[1:01:50] getting plucked by a tooth and you're
[1:01:52] facing an eternity that you're unsure of
[1:01:55] oh give the Lord some Praises oh
[1:01:58] Hallelujah everybody a face it one day
[1:02:00] you know hallelujah praise God Hebrews
[1:02:03] 12 verse 5 let me going get something
[1:02:06] here now he and for ye have forgotten
[1:02:08] the exaltation which speak to you as
[1:02:10] children my son despise not the chasten
[1:02:13] of the Lord nor faint when thou art
[1:02:15] rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth
[1:02:17] he chasten whom the Lord what love it he
[1:02:19] chasten it so if you get no chastening
[1:02:21] you wonder if how much God love you but
[1:02:24] who God love he does Chase we just spoil
[1:02:26] our children you had to watch that you
[1:02:28] know that is his poor bad rotten
[1:02:30] parenting who he love he does chasten
[1:02:33] rebuke and exalt all right watch watch
[1:02:36] watch it here now for if you endure
[1:02:38] chastening endure is the underlying word
[1:02:40] de god dealth with you as Sons for what
[1:02:44] son is he whom the father Chase it not
[1:02:46] but if you without chastisement where of
[1:02:48] all are partakers then you're bastards
[1:02:51] and not Sons furthermore we had fathers
[1:02:53] of our flesh with corrected us and we
[1:02:55] give them reverence shall we much rather
[1:02:58] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:03:00] spirits and live for verily for a few
[1:03:02] days they chasten us unto their own
[1:03:03] pleasure but he for our Prophet that we
[1:03:06] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[1:03:08] no chasing of the present seems
[1:03:10] joyous and Grievous I have children too
[1:03:13] you know and I know how I handle them I
[1:03:16] can't expect everybody to be like me but
[1:03:18] the point about it when you have to get
[1:03:21] discipline and what not is not a nice
[1:03:22] thing but it's the for the good of the
[1:03:25] child when God corrected is for our good
[1:03:28] no child want licks they want correction
[1:03:30] they want rebuke they all want their own
[1:03:32] way I want that I want that and you must
[1:03:35] give them that that that and if they
[1:03:36] keep giving them what they want they get
[1:03:38] become spoiled and then they feel they
[1:03:40] entitled and when they get older they
[1:03:42] will grow up in the world thinking that
[1:03:43] everything they see they want and they
[1:03:45] will get a rude awakening and we say if
[1:03:48] your parents do discipline here life
[1:03:49] will cut your tail life will put licks
[1:03:52] on you oh glory to God to endure what
[1:03:55] you have to go through take correction
[1:03:57] praise God don't try to Swit sides take
[1:04:00] what and go through don't try to get out
[1:04:02] go through what you're going through go
[1:04:04] say Lord take me I'll take me through oh
[1:04:07] give the Lord some shouts in the house
[1:04:10] glory to God hallelujah wherefore lift
[1:04:13] up your hands which what wherefore lift
[1:04:16] up the hands verse 12 which hand down
[1:04:18] and the feeble knees make straight past
[1:04:20] your feet least that which is lame be
[1:04:22] turned out of the way but be rather
[1:04:24] healed okay verse 14 follow peace with
[1:04:26] all men one and Holiness without which
[1:04:31] no man shall see the Lord so if you want
[1:04:33] to see the Lord you to come and line up

[1:07:55] hundreds and thousands of years and he
[1:07:58] promised will bring them back and out of
[1:08:00] all of that only 144,000 going to be
[1:08:02] saved and they rejected their own
[1:08:05] Messiah to give us an opportunity as
[1:08:07] Gentiles to get the Messiah coming to us

[1:08:19] there that his blood wasn't shed to
[1:08:20] reach you and to bring you
[1:08:22] out
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:32] least there be any fornicator or profane
[1:08:36] person as Esau who for one morle of meat
[1:08:41] sold his Birthright for he know how that
[1:08:45] afterwards when he would have inherited
[1:08:47] the blessing he was rejected for he
[1:08:51] found no place of repentance though he
[1:08:54] sought it carefully with tears not dry
[1:08:57] you know with tears and he couldn't get
[1:09:04] it so I I'll just read one verse from
[1:09:07] the Amplified in verse 11 for the time
[1:09:08] being no discipline brings Joy but seems
[1:09:12] Grievous and painful but afterwards it
[1:09:16] yields a Peaceable fruit of
[1:09:17] righteousness to those who have been
[1:09:19] trained by it a harvest of fruit which
[1:09:23] consists of righteousness in Conformity
[1:09:25] to God's will in purpose thought and
[1:09:28] action resulting in right living and
[1:09:31] standing with
[1:09:32] God Amen now let's go let me see if I
[1:09:35] could start this morning all back Dr I

[1:10:38] painted but you bu on sand change where
[1:10:42] you have built make sure it is on a rock
[1:10:45] I believe the greatest battle that was
[1:10:48] ever fought is now ready to go in
[1:10:52] action I believe believe that God has
[1:10:54] been selecting his soldiers I believe he
[1:10:57] has been dressing them training them and
[1:11:01] the Battlefront is now set getting ready
[1:11:04] to start so who think in the battle that
[1:11:07] is their business I am seeing we are
[1:11:10] getting ready to start oh I wish I was
[1:11:13] 30 I could only wish that but I'm not 30
[1:11:16] but I've been in this way training a
[1:11:18] long time and this battle is about to
[1:11:20] begin and I'm happy to be part of this
[1:11:23] battle
[1:11:24] and this battle is not a flesh and blood
[1:11:25] battle Oh Glory to God we are not
[1:11:28] wrestling against flesh and blood Oh
[1:11:30] Glory to God if you could only see what
[1:11:32] what what the spirit
[1:11:34] sees all right let's go so watch the
[1:11:38] first battle ever fought begin in heaven
[1:11:40] when Michael his Angel fought against
[1:11:41] Lucifer and his angels it first started
[1:11:44] the first battle was in heaven so sin
[1:11:46] here we go did not originate in heaven
[1:11:50] it was thrown down from heaven cast onto
[1:11:52] the Earth and fell and human beings then
[1:11:54] the battle begin here on Earth and begin
[1:11:57] in us and have been raging ever since
[1:12:01] aration 127 to1 says and there was a war
[1:12:04] in heaven Michael and his Angel fought
[1:12:06] against the dragon the dragon fought on
[1:12:08] his angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:12:10] their place found any more in heaven and
[1:12:12] the Great Dragon that was cast out the
[1:12:15] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[1:12:17] which deceived the whole world he was
[1:12:18] cast into depth the Earth and his Angel
[1:12:21] were cast with him and I heard of L
[1:12:23] voice in in heaven now is come salvation
[1:12:26] and strength the kingdom of our God and
[1:12:29] the power of His Christ for the
[1:12:32] accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[1:12:36] which accuse them before our God day and
[1:12:39] night and they overcame him by the blood
[1:12:44] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:12:47] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:12:50] unto death so we understand that this
[1:12:52] Lucifer that was kicked out he's the
[1:12:54] accuser and you know why you want to
[1:12:56] accuse you to make you feel guilty you
[1:12:58] did this you did this you did this but
[1:13:00] you overcome by the blood and by your
[1:13:03] testimony because the blood made a way
[1:13:05] for you to confess Oh Glory to God and
[1:13:09] when you confess he atones for what you
[1:13:12] have done but the accuser is still
[1:13:14] around looking at every sin looking at
[1:13:16] every failure looking at every fall but
[1:13:18] they overcame him if the Lord has sh by
[1:13:21] the blood oh glory to God you sin
[1:13:24] because you a sinner you sined because
[1:13:26] you were born in sin but his blood Oh
[1:13:29] Glory to God made a way for you made a
[1:13:32] way for your family glory to God it's
[1:13:34] not your righteousness it's not your
[1:13:36] Holiness it's not your prayer it's not

[1:14:53] spirit
[1:14:54] and the body
[1:14:56] must follow the head as the wife follows
[1:15:00] the husband being that Adam was not
[1:15:03] deceived he walked out with Eve Eve was
[1:15:06] deceived she was in transgression or the
[1:15:10] entire resurrection of the whole body
[1:15:12] would have come forth at the day of the

[1:15:14] grave but he had to redeem her which is
[1:15:18] his body she has to be redeemed in order
[1:15:21] to come with him do you see that so when
[1:15:24] man fell Jesus couldn't just take her
[1:15:25] back you know he had to redeem her
[1:15:28] that's why he had to go and pay the
[1:15:29] price to have blood the blood was the

[1:15:39] Satan you have to be worthy you have to
[1:15:41] be rich you have to be able to pay the

[1:15:44] blood price and he said die for them I
[1:15:48] pay the price for them I lose a book for
[1:15:50] them they have the names on my book give

[1:16:05] this body down he's under my feet he's
[1:16:08] under my feet oh give the Lord some
[1:16:11] Praises this morning hallelujah
[1:16:14] hallelujah so you have to redeem her who
[1:16:17] is her the body she has to be redeemed
[1:16:20] in order to come to him but that's it
[1:16:24] now you see the seals when he was in his
[1:16:26] mediatorial work back there redeeming
[1:16:29] but someday he comes for to get this
[1:16:32] book that he's redeemed and all that is
[1:16:36] in this book would be him for that's the
[1:16:39] believer the words in the book you are

[1:17:12] book and your name is in that book oh
[1:17:16] Hallelujah and to get the book a price
[1:17:18] had to be paid and no angel could do it
[1:17:21] because the angel is not a Kinsman
[1:17:23] hey so it had to be a Kinsman had to be
[1:17:26] somebody near to us so God was born hey

[1:31:12] Shake kingdoms that made the world as a
[1:31:15] Wilderness and destroy the cities
[1:31:16] thereof that open not the house for his
[1:31:18] Prisoners the devil is doing the same
[1:31:20] thing building up a hybrid Church hybrid
[1:31:23] Believers hybrid members hybrid by
[1:31:25] knowledge instead of the word by
[1:31:27] intellectual men instead of Born Again
[1:31:30] men building an intellectual Kingdom
[1:31:32] that will outshine Christ little bitty
[1:31:34] flock what is that did that question
[1:31:38] Fallen
[1:31:40] Angels
[1:31:42] that's the Bible said it was Fallen
[1:31:44] Angels who listen to Lucifer instead of
[1:31:48] Christ now listen
[1:31:49] close Fallen Angels what kind of angels
[1:31:53] Luther
[1:31:55] Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept
[1:31:59] not their first estate like the Angels
[1:32:02] did that fell into organization like
[1:32:05] Lucifer manhole and Isa what have they
[1:32:07] done organized a great ecumenical
[1:32:10] Association of ministers to make an
[1:32:11] image unto the Beast what did they do
[1:32:14] stole out the reasonings of wisdom and
[1:32:16] education like Eve did Fallen Angels did
[1:32:19] here we go Wesley was a man of God
[1:32:22] but what followed him Fallen Angels got
[1:32:25] into it you mean Fallen Angels got into
[1:32:29] every
[1:32:30] message I want to shake it you know but
[1:32:33] this is something astonishing you know
[1:32:35] you mean Fallen Angels coming into this
[1:32:36] message
[1:32:38] exactly what was the Angels first
[1:32:41] creative beings of God but fell for
[1:32:44] Lucifer's wisdom you see what they
[1:32:46] become Fallen Angels an organization
[1:32:50] from Men of God who went forth to
[1:32:52] establish truths in the earth and before
[1:32:55] that truth could go on and proclamate
[1:32:57] and get onto the real revelation of
[1:32:59] Christ Fallen Angels come and took it
[1:33:02] over and made denominations out of
[1:33:04] it so every single denomination is a
[1:33:08] attribute a manifestation of fallen
[1:33:11] angels and they have nice pastors and
[1:33:13] evangelists and nice service and
[1:33:14] inspiration and all kind of like that
[1:33:16] Fallen
[1:33:17] Angels when God looked down we see God
[1:33:19] not seen his holy spirit you know
[1:33:22] Fallen
[1:33:24] Angels because denomination points you
[1:33:26] to an image I am a Pentecostal there an
[1:33:29] image I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist
[1:33:31] that's something to point to not
[1:33:33] Christ but the word will
[1:33:36] produce Jesus
[1:33:38] Christ
[1:33:39] Hallelujah but bam said this now now you
[1:33:43] see what they left off if Luther would
[1:33:46] have went on it would have been there if
[1:33:49] would have went on if pente went on they
[1:33:50] would have been done praise that's the
[1:33:53] reason the revelation of the seven seal
[1:33:56] mystery had to be unfolded because it
[1:33:58] exposes What Spirit Fall after the
[1:34:01] prophet's me after each messenger
[1:34:03] falling droide because your mind gone
[1:34:06] and somebody must have somebody smart
[1:34:09] that the devil could
[1:34:10] use all right here we
[1:34:16] go let's give a little picture here a
[1:34:18] little mental picture here's a stream
[1:34:21] coming through here Channel Now give me
[1:34:22] your undivide attention now so you won't
[1:34:25] miss this in this little channel here
[1:34:28] dwells mortal beings you and I now in
[1:34:31] dear let's look at it it's a mass of
[1:34:33] folly everything else but once in a
[1:34:34] while you see a light you re see
[1:34:37] Blackness and streaks that is Gatey and
[1:34:39] carrying on Devils getting the people
[1:34:41] they dress fine highly cultured polished
[1:34:44] colors but still the devil but there has
[1:34:46] born against it in there now these
[1:34:49] people in this channels influenc from
[1:34:50] two different sides
[1:34:52] on this side there's a trinity and on
[1:34:54] that side there's a trinity now the
[1:34:57] first place on this side is The Souls of
[1:34:59] the unjust when a man die he goes into a
[1:35:01] place place waiting judgment Jesus went
[1:35:05] and preached to them Souls that were in
[1:35:07] prison the next is demons the next is
[1:35:09] the devil and Hell going up there are
[1:35:13] ghosts spirits of dead men that never
[1:35:16] repented they are waiting for judgment
[1:35:18] the only thing they know is folly and
[1:35:20] that's what they did up here these
[1:35:22] Christians here we go are in influenc
[1:35:25] from above up here is another ghost the
[1:35:29] Holy Ghost the ghost of a man Christ
[1:35:32] Jesus the Holy Ghost influences his
[1:35:35] church in this realm of
[1:35:38] mortal the Devil by these Spirits
[1:35:41] influence men the next is Angels the
[1:35:44] next is God so this way below is SS of
[1:35:48] the unjust that people that they have
[1:35:50] half mask for and talk a nice talk
[1:35:52] behind the funeral and going to hell
[1:35:53] Souls on the unjust and then de demons
[1:35:56] and then the devil and Hell On Top here
[1:35:59] have souls of the blessed and then
[1:36:01] angels and then God himself we are in
[1:36:04] between we are Mortals and the
[1:36:07] influences come from above and below so
[1:36:09] when you walk these streets you see what
[1:36:10] going on you're seeing Devils Everywhere
[1:36:13] by how they're dressed by how they look
[1:36:14] you know it's Devils praise God praise
[1:36:17] God all right watch now watch now he's
[1:36:21] talking about a woman who was accurate
[1:36:23] and she was predicting things and she
[1:36:25] was a um um a medium like right intact
[1:36:28] with demons and so now what that woman
[1:36:30] done she broke into that realm she is
[1:36:33] speaking to those demon-possessed men
[1:36:35] who at the beginning the spirits here we
[1:36:38] go of those fallen
[1:36:42] angels that repented not back there in
[1:36:45] the beginning and allow their beings to
[1:36:48] be possessed of them their waiting
[1:36:49] judgment and these over here are
[1:36:52] influenced by the spirit of God so it's
[1:36:55] three sides up Tre sides down Hallelujah
[1:36:58] and the people in the in between being
[1:37:01] influenced now watch Lucifer has got
[1:37:03] into the
[1:37:04] church and taken away the word and
[1:37:08] injected
[1:37:10] denomination and He is building a church
[1:37:13] Jesus I my church been aard you know
[1:37:17] he's been a f and soal Monarch and thing
[1:37:20] and not interested that you know them he
[1:37:22] had it already he interested in
[1:37:28] church follow me now know all right The
[1:37:32] ecumenical move that's going on now to
[1:37:36] unite all the Protestants together and
[1:37:39] come into Catholic this Pope that got
[1:37:41] now to do the same thing exactly what
[1:37:42] the scripture said now watch he is doing
[1:37:45] it by man of those great ecumenical
[1:37:47] moves who does not know God and and the
[1:37:51] many of them in the Pentecostals because
[1:37:54] they are doing the same what is it he is
[1:37:56] doing it with Fallen
[1:37:59] Angels then he then he listed here
[1:38:01] Fallen lutherans Fallen methodists
[1:38:05] Fallen Pentecostals lost their original
[1:38:08] estate from the word of God going right
[1:38:10] back to make a great economical move
[1:38:13] Fallen Angels Fallen Messengers who once
[1:38:16] stayed with the word but so out their
[1:38:18] birth rights and join in the world con
[1:38:21] churches and so on in the last day
[1:38:23] Lucifer's achievement today by man wait
[1:38:26] listen with those Spirits in
[1:38:32] them man with those Spirits in them that
[1:38:36] he did with angels at the beginning
[1:38:38] Fallen Angels who did not kept their
[1:38:41] first estate amen so God permitted
[1:38:43] fallen
[1:38:44] angels all that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:38:47] be deceived except those whose names
[1:38:50] written but you the bride cannot be
[1:38:53] deceived Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:38:57] praise God praise God praise God and
[1:39:00] you're going to find out I'm going to
[1:39:01] read it for you that these Spirits have
[1:39:02] Natures with it and the Holy Ghost have
[1:39:05] a nature with it oh glory to God so when
[1:39:09] the Holy Ghost influence you you will
[1:39:10] come up with a certain nature look at
[1:39:12] right there faith and virtue and
[1:39:14] knowledge and Temperance and patience
[1:39:15] and godliness brotherly kindness and so
[1:39:17] forth and out of that will get the
[1:39:18] Galatians fruit with joy and peace some
[1:39:21] long suffering and oh give the Lord some
[1:39:23] Praises glory to God and then Fallen
[1:39:26] Angels coming with their n and out of
[1:39:28] that you get second timy praise God
[1:39:30] heavy and high minded and lovers of
[1:39:31] pleasure and lovers of God pray do you
[1:39:34] see what going on here it's the same the
[1:39:36] two Spirits we talking about here glory
[1:39:38] to God blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:39:44] to God so after the prophet left the
[1:39:46] Fallen Angels drop inside the message
[1:39:48] with interpretations and ideas and
[1:39:50] that's spirit because they have to come
[1:39:52] to the head first you know that's why
[1:39:54] every time a man want to take charge of
[1:39:55] other man I to watch that you had to
[1:39:56] watch that because the devil because the
[1:39:58] devil get to the pastors a man in charge
[1:40:00] of ministers if a man in charge of
[1:40:01] ministers and become I identify message
[1:40:04] Pope only preacher talk about message
[1:40:05] Pope years I talking about that the
[1:40:08] message Pope want to control ministers
[1:40:10] because the ministers have influence
[1:40:11] over the congregation so when the
[1:40:13] message Pope bring his false seed and
[1:40:14] drop it on them pastors and then pastors
[1:40:16] go and drop it on the church the church
[1:40:19] paralyzed because they're not on the
[1:40:21] word and God can only bless his word
[1:40:22] because God know what he said to the
[1:40:24] prophet God don't care about what man
[1:40:25] say you know he spoke to a prophet
[1:40:27] hallelujah hallelujah so I can't come
[1:40:29] and bring my thoughts and idea my dream
[1:40:31] last night I have to say what the tape
[1:40:32] say I don't have a message I preach a
[1:40:34] message Oh Glory I preaching another
[1:40:37] man's message oh give the Lord a shout

[1:40:44] good seed and if we preach this word you
[1:40:47] going to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:49] because the word is the holy ghost in
[1:40:51] word form Oh Glory to God give the Lord
[1:40:54] a

[1:46:06] to show unto his disciples how he must
[1:46:09] go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things
[1:46:12] of the elders and chief priests and

[1:46:34] Satan now Jesus was not talking to Peter
[1:46:39] there Jesus was talking to the spirit
[1:46:43] that was behind
[1:46:44] Peter saying those things because Peter
[1:46:48] was influenced by that spirit and he he
[1:46:50] called it out he said get behind me

[1:55:06] and he healed him in so much as the
[1:55:08] Blind and dumb both spake and saw and
[1:55:11] all the people were amazed and said it's
[1:55:13] not this son of
[1:55:14] David but when the Pharisees heard it
[1:55:18] they said this fellow
[1:55:20] do not cast out Devils but by
[1:55:24] B the prince of devils and Jesus knew
[1:55:27] their thoughts and said unto them every
[1:55:31] Kingdom divided against itself is
[1:55:35] brought to Desolation and every city
[1:55:38] house divided against itself shall not
[1:55:41] stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is
[1:55:46] divided against himself how shall then
[1:55:50] his kingdom stand so he's also saying
[1:55:53] without saying it Satan has a kingdom
[1:55:56] and the kingdom of a structure and the
[1:55:58] kingdom is
[1:56:02] standing and this kingdom consist of
[1:56:07] principalities
[1:56:08] Powers spiritual wickedness and the
[1:56:11] other
[1:56:13] one rulers of Darkness so he organized
[1:56:16] it by country by
[1:56:20] City And he it lordship D you have all
[1:56:24] of that everything
[1:56:28] covered but if I by Bel cast out Devils
[1:56:32] by whom do your children cast them out
[1:56:35] therefore they shall be your judges but
[1:56:37] here this verse here this verse is
[1:56:39] important but if I cast out Devils by

[1:56:51] is he saying here I am showing you by my
[1:56:55] power to cast out Devils the kingdom of

[1:57:03] his kingdom by casting no devils in the
[1:57:06] Kingdom of Satan oh give the Lord a

[2:04:04] and when he had called his 12

[2:04:17] power he EMP power of unclean against
[2:04:21] against unclean Spirit to cast them out
[2:04:24] and to heal all manner of sicknesses and
[2:04:27] all manner of disease and they didn't
[2:04:29] have the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord
[2:04:31] some Praises if the Lord a
[2:04:34] shouting this is Matthew 10 this was an
[2:04:38] allotment of temporary power for the
[2:04:41] work of the ministry to work along with
[2:04:43] Jesus but the judge temporary power and
[2:04:47] when the status he devil scatter so they
[2:04:49] run one day happy happy happy they said

[2:06:13] the challenges that that's yet in are
[2:06:15] yet ahead in the realm of the spirit
[2:06:19] the only way we could really combat that
[2:06:21] devil is to come into our place and
[2:06:23] position to know who we are because

[2:07:57] go from future home but
[2:08:00] Brown talk about new heaven New Earth by
[2:08:03] these passages one might think or be led
[2:08:06] rather to believe that the whole planet
[2:08:09] of this Earth will be destroyed and make
[2:08:11] a new Heaven and new
[2:08:13] earth that the heavens will be gone and
[2:08:15] Earth will be gone completely anal but a
[2:08:19] close study and with the help of the
[2:08:21] Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this
[2:08:24] it is only the atmospheres around
[2:08:29] it and the sin that come upon the Earth
[2:08:32] will be destroyed we realize that
[2:08:35] Heavens means the atmosphere
[2:08:38] above what does it do in this these
[2:08:41] titles and sickness and death and
[2:08:43] politics and sinful man sinful woman
[2:08:45] evil spirits will all be going away and
[2:08:47] unleaded and un
[2:08:49] it has to be done that way because we
[2:08:52] are going to live right
[2:08:54] here take your
[2:08:58] property see we
[2:09:03] right this thing sweet sweet sweet sweet
[2:09:05] sweet all right now watch all germs all
[2:09:10] sicknesses will be completely taken away
[2:09:12] it's existence that's in the earth now
[2:09:14] man-made systems politics sin all kind
[2:09:16] of evil spirits that's in the world
[2:09:18] contaminated with all the heavens above
[2:09:20] us is contaminated with evil
[2:09:25] spirits all this exist in the heavens or
[2:09:29] atmospheres and the Earth which is now
[2:09:31] this Earth hold those things but it
[2:09:33] wasn't made for that purpose sin caused
[2:09:35] that all our bodies physical bodies now
[2:09:39] that we live in now was put on the earth
[2:09:41] when God created
[2:09:43] it there's a big one when God created
[2:09:47] let there be a earth our bodies was
[2:09:48] created right there because we come from
[2:09:51] the dust of the
[2:09:52] Earth all of B we live in now was put in
[2:09:54] the earth when God created the Earth
[2:09:55] because you out of the Dust of the earth
[2:09:57] it was all laid out there when God
[2:09:58] himself created it you were in his
[2:10:00] thinking the great Eternal was the
[2:10:03] thought which is the attribute now sin
[2:10:05] caused all this to happen and God
[2:10:06] through this age is gathering up his
[2:10:09] material Satan is still here that's the
[2:10:12] reason all these things happen he's
[2:10:13] still here all his evil forces are still
[2:10:15] here notice why the earth now is so
[2:10:17] filthy amen why the scum and ridiculous
[2:10:20] things that goes on Bloodshed War
[2:10:22] politics sin adultery all kind of fness
[2:10:24] goes on is because Satan is the ruler of
[2:10:26] this Earth and this
[2:10:29] atmosphere both heavens and earth is now
[2:10:32] contaminated with Devils that can accuse
[2:10:34] us before God and Jesus is there to
[2:10:38] intercede for us while the accusers keep
[2:10:40] pointing a finger they did this they did
[2:10:43] this they did this but the blood still
[2:10:45] covers he came to redeem that elected he
[2:10:48] for
[2:10:49] sure do you receive this have you
[2:10:51] received
[2:10:52] [Applause]
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:56] this Ephesians 2 verse one says and you
[2:11:00] had he quickened who was dead in
[2:11:02] trespasses and sins wherein in time pass
[2:11:05] you walk according to the course of this
[2:11:06] world according to the prince of the
[2:11:09] power of the air which is the atmosphere
[2:11:12] so Satan is the prince of the power so
[2:11:15] he is in fourth
[2:11:17] dimension
[2:11:18] he's where TV RS and radio ways and all
[2:11:21] the dimensions that why he uses so
[2:11:24] much and I can't get on too much take
[2:11:26] too much time Satan was a master
[2:11:30] musician his body was a music his body
[2:11:33] was a music
[2:11:35] thing and that is why the channel of
[2:11:37] music is so important and he uses it to
[2:11:41] get to people Spirits using music to
[2:11:45] bring adulterous Spirit fornicate Spirit
[2:11:48] lion Spirit do Spirit Spirits War
[2:11:52] animosity thiefing
[2:11:55] Spirit um was some man sing some song
[2:11:58] one getting rich at any cost I can't
[2:12:00] remember
[2:12:01] um man name 50

[2:12:15] whatever it is just get rich and then
[2:12:17] dead rich
[2:12:19] die like a dog yeah taking the money
[2:12:22] with you see all right so the Bible call
[2:12:25] this the prince of the power of the air
[2:12:27] the spirit that now worketh in the
[2:12:30] children of Disobedience so when you're
[2:12:32] rebellious inside of here the
[2:12:34] disobedient inside of here the prince of
[2:12:36] the power here he have you you're
[2:12:38] floating in his atmosphere and they C
[2:12:41] chur God bless you God prince prince
[2:12:43] have
[2:12:47] you
[2:12:52] all right let's go when God created me
[2:12:55] William Bram I was before the foundation
[2:12:58] of the world he made my being my spirit
[2:13:02] I wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[2:13:04] I know now watch Jesus told his
[2:13:07] disciples he knew them before the
[2:13:09] foundation of the world and Paul said
[2:13:11] here he chose us him before the world
[2:13:13] began so there was some part of me om
[2:13:15] man Neville and the rest of you all here
[2:13:17] that's in Jesus Christ before the will
[2:13:19] ever began and I
[2:13:22] think and here's my analysis of that I
[2:13:25] think that the people today that are
[2:13:28] possessed with this Spirit or the spirit
[2:13:29] or part was a part of these Angelic
[2:13:32] beings hallelu Spirits which rotated off
[2:13:36] of God hallu that never fell in the
[2:13:39] beginning and resisted the Devils lie in
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:46] heaven how many C that now he said we
[2:13:50] are part of we believe that we are part
[2:13:53] of the spirit the Angelic beings the
[2:13:56] spirits which rotated off of God that
[2:13:58] never fell in the beginning and resisted
[2:14:02] Devil's lie no wonder he said the two
[2:14:05] spirits will be so close it will deceive
[2:14:08] the very elect if it was possible but it
[2:14:12] can't be because we we we deny him that
[2:14:15] in heaven those angels represent us we
[2:14:19] were nowhere then but the Angels
[2:14:21] represent the angels that fought against
[2:14:23] Lucifer they represented our stand on
[2:14:25] Earth so we going to resist him down
[2:14:28] here that what the Bible say resist the
[2:14:30] devil he shall flee we have authority to
[2:14:33] resist not to give in not to be washed
[2:14:36] up but to resist because you are a
[2:14:40] soldier oh give the Lord I shout in the
[2:14:43] house glory to
[2:14:45] God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:49] praise God praise God praise God
[2:14:51] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory
[2:14:54] to God hallelujah praise God all right
[2:14:59] let's go 2/3 of the earth is in
[2:15:02] sin what what third of the Angels was
[2:15:05] kicked out here we go and those demon
[2:15:09] spirits come into people and habitate
[2:15:14] their
[2:15:15] body there was once EX existed and they
[2:15:18] come into people and give them a
[2:15:22] nature Jesus cast seven of them out of
[2:15:25] Mary
[2:15:26] Magdalene then you start to identify
[2:15:28] some of
[2:15:29] them you could compare what you have
[2:15:32] here

[2:15:41] Strife they are
[2:15:44] spirits about 10 people say Spirits
[2:15:47] about 10 people say amen
[2:15:51] if that's Spirit you don't want to say
[2:15:53] amen I can understand
[2:15:54] that but you could say
[2:15:56] Amen even Legion and all say amen and he
[2:15:59] had a thousand Devils I don't think you
[2:16:01] have much I don't think you have as much
[2:16:03] as Legion so say Amen because you have
[2:16:06] to be delivered because you will be
[2:16:09] delivered this will come to deliver you

[2:17:09] nature praise God and what about the
[2:17:11] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost come into your

[2:17:23] what about the opposite the opposite is
[2:17:24] also true the Holy Ghost come to give
[2:17:26] you a nature hallelujah praise God watch
[2:17:30] them were spirits that was made up back
[2:17:34] there when God made man off of his own
[2:17:37] image he created those supernatural
[2:17:39] beings Hallelujah all right first Peter
[2:17:42] 3 said but how bir have all these
[2:17:44] scriptures today don't even ask me how 1
[2:17:47] Peter 3: 18 and 19 for
[2:17:50] Christ also had one suffered for sins to
[2:17:54] just for the unjust that he might bring
[2:17:56] us to God being put to death in the
[2:17:59] flesh but quickened by the Spirit by
[2:18:01] which also he went and preached unto the
[2:18:05] spirits in prison so when Christ died he
[2:18:09] didn't just die and we just chilling out
[2:18:11] on his second day no he was at work he
[2:18:14] went down to the regions of the Lost he
[2:18:16] took the keys from Satan and he had to
[2:18:18] go to preach to those people all them
[2:18:21] Spirits from Noah's day and everything
[2:18:22] else and preach to them and witness to
[2:18:24] them that he's the one that was prophesy
[2:18:26] about and they couldn't be saved souls
[2:18:30] in prison question and answers but AB
[2:18:34] BR the question answers now the souls
[2:18:38] that were in prison that repented not
[2:18:41] were not Angelic beings that have been
[2:18:44] brought down in the form of angels but
[2:18:47] it was the spirits of those Angelic
[2:18:50] beings that fell before the foundation
[2:18:53] of the world back dear when the war went
[2:18:55] on in
[2:18:56] heaven so the spirits of those Angelic
[2:19:00] beings is what fell on them people to
[2:19:02] fight
[2:19:06] Noah so when Jesus said as one day a
[2:19:09] Noah so shall it be the Comm son of man
[2:19:12] what Jesus is also saying the same
[2:19:14] spirits that was in Noah's day will come
[2:19:17] back in this day okay give the Lord a
[2:19:19] shouting the house do you catch it now
[2:19:23] watch Satan and the dragon fought
[2:19:26] Michael and a dragon fought on Lucifer
[2:19:27] and Lucifer was cast out with all his
[2:19:29] children all the angels that he had
[2:19:32] deceived and those angels come down to
[2:19:35] earth and were subject then to become
[2:19:37] human and when they did when they saw
[2:19:40] the sons of daughters of men were fear
[2:19:42] and talking to them wives they are sons
[2:19:43] of God here we go listen to this part
[2:19:45] every man that was born in the Earth is
[2:19:47] a Son of God regardless of whether he a
[2:19:49] sinner or whether he is he's a Son of
[2:19:51] God created in the image of God for the
[2:19:53] praise of God he's created that way and
[2:19:55] God in the beginning knew who would
[2:19:56] receive him who would not receive him
[2:19:58] therefore he could predestinate or not
[2:20:00] predestinate but by for knowledge he
[2:20:02] could tell who would be Sav and who
[2:20:03] wouldn't be saved he knew which person
[2:20:06] will take up which
[2:20:10] Spirit he knew who will pick up Church
[2:20:12] Spirit who will pick up Baptist spirit
[2:20:14] and who will take up the spirit of the
[2:20:16] word he knew you would receive this
[2:20:19] message so when this message come you
[2:20:21] had to come out your Catholic church
[2:20:22] Baptist to come out beating pant smoking
[2:20:23] cigarette dancing fooling around you had
[2:20:25] to come out whether your wife didn't
[2:20:26] want it your husband didn't want it you
[2:20:28] had to come out he knew you would pick
[2:20:30] this up you couldn't miss it if you Tred
[2:20:32] Give the Lord a that alone you make a
[2:20:37] shout
[2:20:40] watch and those spirits that come from
[2:20:42] the Throne of God and stands Before the
[2:20:45] Throne of God and live billions and
[2:20:48] billions and ions of time before the
[2:20:49] world ever begin in the presence of God
[2:20:52] you think they don't know something
[2:20:53] about
[2:20:54] worship they get right into men and they
[2:20:58] worship God he's talking about the men
[2:21:01] now he talking about the
[2:21:04] spirit absolutely they worship God they
[2:21:07] have a knowledge of God and they are
[2:21:10] smart shrewd educated always but God
[2:21:15] rejected them from the beginning
[2:21:19] so we talking about these Angelic
[2:21:20] spirits that coming upon human beings
[2:21:23] and influencing them a certain way and
[2:21:26] these Spirits could influence men talk
[2:21:27] to them that why they meet an angel but
[2:21:30] the angel is not a Bible
[2:21:32] Angel so we can't fight the Experience
[2:21:35] One
[2:21:36] Man deceased brother precious zigma told
[2:21:39] me this brother he said he don't know
[2:21:41] how it felt when the anointing come down
[2:21:43] upon me and a voice said I am the Holy
[2:21:46] Ghost
[2:21:50] and that is where that Doctrine come
[2:21:51] from you know an
[2:21:53] experience that they come the air you
[2:21:55] know it come from the area the
[2:21:57] prince it come from above it come it
[2:21:59] come down then compar with the word you
[2:22:01] know how you arrive that it has to be a
[2:22:04] scriptural voice so don't just hear
[2:22:06] angel angel talk what you saying what
[2:22:08] you say I can find brother Bram check
[2:22:10] what the angel was telling them with
[2:22:11] what's in the Bible and he was the
[2:22:13] prophet so is come and said they come
[2:22:15] open sees and sees and SE say good yeah

[2:27:41] musicians get ready
[2:27:45] please question
[2:27:47] question does the sons of God means
[2:27:50] Angels or Spirits from Heaven question
[2:27:55] that's was the person's question I
[2:27:57] believe that they wasn't Angels they
[2:28:00] were beings sons of God like the
[2:28:02] scripture says not Angels they were sons
[2:28:04] of God and they come from Heaven to
[2:28:06] Earth and was put into flesh not pressed
[2:28:09] themselves into flesh I believe all
[2:28:11] flesh is born sexual outside of Jesus
[2:28:15] Christ I believe he's the only virgin
[2:28:17] born being that ever was Jesus Christ I
[2:28:20] don't agree with Josephus and that great
[2:28:23] historian I do believe that they were
[2:28:25] supernatural beings that come down and
[2:28:27] took over the spirit of men and I
[2:28:29] believe they are right here today still
[2:28:32] walking around in jonville today them
[2:28:37] same
[2:28:38] beastly lustfully ungodly spirits that
[2:28:43] live in human beings listen to this now
[2:28:47] someday these men will die and if
[2:28:51] there's another
[2:28:53] generation that they will come right
[2:28:55] down on
[2:28:58] them he was saying these Spirits walking
[2:29:02] around inen lustfully and and and um we
[2:29:06] say there all
[2:29:08] right ungodly Spirits right in human
[2:29:11] beings someday these men will die and
[2:29:15] there's a an there's another generation
[2:29:17] they will come down to them remember God
[2:29:21] take his man but never his spirit this
[2:29:25] is the same holy spirit that they
[2:29:28] receive on
[2:29:29] Pentecost it's the same devil in
[2:29:32] religious form that persecuted Christ
[2:29:36] it's the same Devils that is in the
[2:29:38] church today wearing long robes so when
[2:29:41] God take a man he said I'll get it I'll
[2:29:43] read it to you the Holy Ghost on that
[2:29:45] man goes on somebody else
[2:29:48] and the Devils on people that's why sin
[2:29:50] here
[2:29:52] finish they catch the drug lord and they
[2:29:55] they hang them and they kill them when
[2:29:56] them dead the spirit on them drug lord
[2:29:59] drop on somebody else and they have a
[2:30:00] new drug lord The adulterous Spirit when
[2:30:03] that person die that adulter jump on
[2:30:05] somebody else do you get it now so they
[2:30:08] can't clean up this world unless he sons
[2:30:10] of God have to clean them
[2:30:14] up because the government legislate
[2:30:19] righteousness all the police could do is
[2:30:21] we have one here all the police lock up
[2:30:23] people but that is just from a natural
[2:30:25] standpoint but behind those people have
[2:30:28] spirits that directing them and guiding
[2:30:30] them it will not stop so you shoot all
[2:30:33] the bandits in tongue now this month and
[2:30:35] next month that's all them Spirits if

[2:31:06] they are very religious you mean
[2:31:08] religious yes even teach the
[2:31:13] scriptures is that Spirit doing that
[2:31:16] I notice Jesus came to a bunch of men
[2:31:20] that was holy priests kept the Lords to
[2:31:22] the letter and they were very religious
[2:31:25] John called them you Generation of
[2:31:27] Vipers who want you to flee from the r
[2:31:30] to come when Jesus saw them he said you
[2:31:32] have the Father the devil that was God
[2:31:34] saying that just as religious could be
[2:31:38] remember the devil takes his man but
[2:31:41] never his Spirit God take his man but
[2:31:45] never his spirit
[2:31:46] the Holy Spirit comes into your life and
[2:31:50] sanctify your spirit lives through you
[2:31:53] gives you power to live but when your
[2:31:55] spirit goes on your spirit is kept with
[2:31:58] God but the holy spirit that was on you
[2:32:00] comes on somebody else and somebody else
[2:32:03] and somebody else this spirit that was
[2:32:06] upon Elijah come upon elishah a double
[2:32:08] portion 700 years it come upon John the
