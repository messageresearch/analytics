[22:27] and i saw on the right of him that sat
[22:29] on the throne a book written within
[22:31] on a backside seal with seven seals and
[22:33] i saw a loud angel strong angel
[22:36] proclaim with a lord voice who is worthy
[22:39] to open the book and to loose the seals
[22:41] thereof and no man in heaven knowing
[22:43] earth neither under the earth was able
[22:45] to open the book needed to look there on
[22:48] and i wept much
[22:50] because no one was found worthy to open
[22:52] and to read a book needed to look
[22:54] thereon
[22:55] one of the elders said unto me weep not
[22:58] behold
[23:00] the lion of the tribe of judah
[23:02] the root of david
[23:04] had prevailed to open the book until
[23:07] loose the seven seals thereof and i
[23:09] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[23:11] and of the four beasts in the midst of
[23:12] the four and the elders to the lamb
[23:15] as it had been slain having seven horns
[23:17] and seven eyes which are the seven
[23:18] spirits of god
[23:20] sent forth into all the earth he came
[23:22] and took the book out of the right hand
[23:24] of him that set up on the throne and
[23:26] when he had taken the book the four
[23:28] beasts the four and twenty elders fell
[23:29] down before the lamb having every one of
[23:32] them harps and golden vials full of
[23:34] odors which are the prayers of the
[23:37] saints
[23:39] and they sung a new song
[23:41] saying
[23:42] god worry to take the book and to open
[23:45] the seals thereof for dao was slain and
[23:48] has redeemed us to god
[23:50] by thy blood out of every kindred and
[23:54] tongue
[23:55] and people
[23:56] and nation
[23:57] revelation chapter 8 reading verse 1 to
[23:59] 5.
[24:02] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[24:05] there was silence in heaven
[24:08] about a space of half an hour
[24:10] and i saw the seven angels which stood
[24:12] before god
[24:14] and to them were given seven trumpets
[24:17] and another angel came and stood at the
[24:18] altar having a golden censer
[24:21] and i was given unto him much incense
[24:24] that he should offer it
[24:26] with the prayers of all saints
[24:28] upon the golden altar which was before
[24:31] the throne
[24:32] and the smoke of the incense which came
[24:34] with the prayers of the saints
[24:36] ascended up before god out of the
[24:38] angel's hand
[24:40] and the angel took the censer
[24:42] filled it with fire
[24:44] of the altar cast it unto the earth
[24:48] and there were voices
[24:50] and thunderings
[24:52] and lightnings
[24:54] and an earthquake

[30:38] now jericho was strictly shut up
[30:41] because the children of israel none went
[30:42] out
[30:44] none came in
[30:46] there's a tight ship
[30:48] shut up
[30:51] and the lord said unto joshua see
[30:54] i have given unto thine and jericho
[30:59] it's shut up
[31:00] nobody coming in nobody going out and
[31:02] god says see i give it to you
[31:06] they bind it up
[31:07] they block it up
[31:09] they
[31:10] put a gate around it they put walls
[31:12] around it but i have given it
[31:19] you can't miss it
[31:20] because the world is bigger around it
[31:23] you can't miss it
[31:24] because the tallest thing are wrong and
[31:27] it can't move
[31:30] they ain't going nowhere
[31:32] you're going to lose them
[31:34] and you're going to set them free
[31:37] let's read on hell
[31:39] the lord said see
[31:40] i've given one to thine hand jericho
[31:43] and the king thereof
[31:45] and the mighty men of valor
[31:49] you shall come past the city all the men
[31:51] of war
[31:52] go around the city once
[31:55] thus shall thou do six days
[31:58] seven priests shall bear before the ark
[32:02] seven trumpets
[32:04] of ram horns
[32:05] and the seventh day
[32:07] he shall come past the city seven times
[32:11] and the priests shall blow
[32:13] with the trumpets
[32:16] and it should come to pass when they
[32:17] make a long blast
[32:19] with the rams horn
[32:21] and when you hear the song of the
[32:23] trumpet all the people shall shout
[32:27] with a great shout
[32:29] and
[32:30] the wall of the city shall fall down
[32:33] flat
[32:34] and the people shall ascend up every man
[32:38] straight before him
[32:40] so god lay out the end
[32:43] from the beginning
[32:45] he gave the description of the order
[32:48] of how it's supposed to be
[32:50] he described the end game
[32:52] which is the city was to fall flat
[32:56] but there are fine prints
[32:58] to that whole plan
[33:00] that god give
[33:02] you carry out and get excited and just
[33:05] do your own thing
[33:06] you have to wait for further instruction
[33:10] the city has already been given
[33:12] your family has already been given
[33:19] forget what your eyes see
[33:23] everybody should be screaming now
[33:24] [Applause]
[33:26] you are not going with your five senses
[33:29] your senses are lying
[33:34] say man
[33:36] say amen
[33:38] your senses are lying
[33:40] you are not the believer
[33:44] the believer is the word in you
[33:48] [Applause]
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:03] let me just get cracking here
[34:07] our
[34:08] righteousness
[34:10] is
[34:13] filthy rags
[34:15] you see your best foot forward
[34:17] you praying and you seeking the lord and
[34:19] so on filthy rags
[34:22] that's what you do
[34:24] you pray you pray that you
[34:27] you can't even approach god holiness
[34:29] with that
[34:31] so god will even hear you yes you is
[34:34] because of blood
[34:38] over you
[34:41] he hears your prayer
[34:43] and when your prayer comes to that blood
[34:45] it smells sweet
[34:47] [Applause]
[34:49] like incense
[34:51] not just your voice
[34:53] but when it comes to the perfume
[34:55] [Applause]
[34:58] of that rose of sharon
[35:00] of that lily of the valley
[35:02] my god when a man of god prayer when the
[35:06] saints of god pray under that blood
[35:09] those devils tremble
[35:12] because you got to know
[35:14] there is power not your prayer but power
[35:18] in the blood and when your prayer boss
[35:22] through that blood
[35:23] my god the gates of heaven
[35:26] have to open up and i feel this morning
[35:30] something's gonna break
[35:31] something gonna take place
[35:34] right in this place
[35:35] right in this building
[35:37] right among you
[35:41] [Applause]
[35:47] don't bother with what the senses
[35:48] declare
[35:50] you might be seated oh our father
[35:52] abraham demonstrated a life of faith
[35:55] that was
[35:56] astonishing
[35:58] that is shocking
[36:00] god spoke to him
[36:01] about he and his wife
[36:04] god never told syria anything
[36:06] he said you're gonna have a son
[36:08] and his name gonna be isaac isn't that
[36:10] right true this old woman named sarah
[36:12] never had a child and past child by her
[36:14] own time
[36:15] and abraham to believe for himself
[36:18] and believe for his wife
[36:20] who god never spoke to who had horrors
[36:23] and fight and mind battles and she have
[36:24] a right to have that because she never
[36:26] got a revelation of what abraham had
[36:29] if she was in the spiritual and super
[36:31] spiritual not super religious behavior
[36:33] she might walk out on abraham
[36:35] until you have crack but you see the
[36:37] fate of abraham does make it act funny
[36:40] it is making act contrary to other
[36:42] people thinking
[36:44] they make an old man believe that he's
[36:46] going to have a child and make an old
[36:48] man believe his old woman wife gonna
[36:50] have a child
[36:51] and he's tagged not
[36:57] when his back hurt him he wasn't stuck
[36:59] in a little bit when he had to hold the
[37:01] stick he was rocking a little bit that
[37:03] wasn't the problem he had a cough he had
[37:06] this he had pain he had fever that's not
[37:08] the problem but what god said don't mess
[37:11] with that
[37:12] don't play with that
[37:14] what god said don't deny that
[37:17] just say god said so
[37:21] come on let the lord give the lord a
[37:23] shout
[37:24] don't fool with that
[37:25] [Applause]
[37:34] listen
[37:35] god took them out to egypt
[37:37] that wasn't a problem
[37:39] feed them in the wilderness they
[37:40] complained that wasn't a problem
[37:42] they want meat
[37:43] they had a light bread there's not a
[37:45] problem you said meat for them
[37:46] they would drink
[37:48] water from a rock whatever they want
[37:50] god struggled you with them because you
[37:52] know that's not the promise
[37:54] the journey is not the promise
[37:56] so all you're fed up and you're tired
[37:58] you're on your journey
[37:59] but when they came to kenya
[38:01] and god trying to say but listen friends
[38:04] i'm about to show you
[38:06] what the fulfillment is
[38:08] what the endgame is
[38:10] don't don't know
[38:12] i want to bring evidence back
[38:14] i want to send men spies to bring back
[38:17] evidence of a reality that this is more
[38:20] than quotes and books and tapes and
[38:22] scripture reading there is a land beyond
[38:25] the river there's a supernatural power
[38:27] there's a power to heal the shake to
[38:29] raise the dead to cast out better to
[38:32] speak in new tongues there's a power
[38:34] like you've never seen before
[38:36] that is coming to the church now
[38:38] hallelujah i want you to believe in that
[38:40] power don't just come to church to sit
[38:43] the bench come to church to create an
[38:45] atmosphere
[38:47] to make a church
[38:48] not going to make a revival
[38:51] even a 700 revival
[38:53] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[38:56] oh
[38:57] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[39:00] to god glory to god
[39:06] my father my father my father yes
[39:09] six of that scripture
[39:11] and joshua the son of nun call the
[39:14] priests
[39:16] said unto them
[39:17] fine print
[39:19] take up the ark of the covenant
[39:21] let the seven priests bear seven
[39:23] trumpets of our homes
[39:25] before the act of the lord
[39:27] he said unto people pass on compass the
[39:29] city
[39:30] let him that is am the person before the
[39:32] act of the lord
[39:33] and it came to pass when joshua spoke
[39:35] unto the people
[39:36] seven priests bearing seven trumpets of
[39:38] ram horns passed on before the lord and
[39:41] blew their trumpets and the act of the
[39:43] covenant of the lord followed them
[39:45] and the armed men went before the
[39:46] priests and blew the trumpets
[39:48] and reward came after the act the priest
[39:50] going on blowing the trumpets
[39:52] hear this part and joshua had commanded
[39:55] the people saying you shall not shout
[39:57] [Music]
[39:59] or make any noise with your voice
[40:01] neither shall any word proceed out of
[40:03] your mouth
[40:04] until the day i beat you to shout
[40:07] then shall you shout
[40:09] so amidst the whole plan
[40:12] joshua introduced a
[40:14] a time of silence
[40:19] [Music]
[40:21] silence does mean nothing happening
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:28] silent doesn't mean that there's just
[40:30] nothing in effect no
[40:32] silence is waiting
[40:34] for the appointed time
[40:36] to execute
[40:38] god's plan and purpose
[40:41] so joshua said when i believe the show
[40:44] then show
[40:46] oh
[40:47] hallelujah
[40:49] glory to god amen
[40:51] hallelujah
[40:53] praise the lord
[40:55] praise god praise god
[40:57] and it came to pass
[40:59] on the seventh day
[41:00] when they arose early about the dawn of
[41:02] the day and compassed the city seven
[41:05] times only on that day and the compass
[41:07] is 87 times came to pass on the seventh
[41:09] time when the police brought the
[41:11] trumpets justice and people shout for
[41:13] the lord had given you the city
[41:16] praise god that's before the city fall
[41:18] before the walls fell
[41:21] they had to shout because the lord gave
[41:23] the city you're not waiting for the
[41:25] walls to fall to shout you have to shout
[41:31] before your walls
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:45] that's faith
[41:47] when you could shout
[41:49] before your eyes pop open
[41:51] when you could shop before your
[41:52] party your body get loose
[41:54] when you could praise god
[41:56] hallelujah

[42:02] offering
[42:04] my god that like the devil said that

[42:16] you born in sin and shape iniquity and
[42:18] connect the five senses but when you see

[55:02] break forth five more stars
[55:04] that's what the seventh seal it ends the
[55:06] time of the world
[55:08] it ends the time for this it then the
[55:09] time for that it ended time for
[55:11] everything is ended up on that seventh
[55:13] seal
[55:14] the breaking of the sea was so great
[55:18] that heaven was hushed
[55:20] by silence
[55:22] for the space of half an hour
[55:24] half an hour was fixed
[55:26] no man could change it
[55:28] it's only for a space
[55:30] of half an hour
[55:32] half an hour of silence god's silence
[55:35] heaven silence but underneath that
[55:37] silence he's redeeming a people
[55:40] by his blood
[55:42] by his word
[55:44] redemption present tense
[55:46] he himself came down
[55:48] in first thessalonians 4. scripture said
[55:51] the lord himself
[55:53] descends from heaven with a shout
[55:55] with a sound
[55:57] hallelujah with the voice of the
[55:59] archangel
[56:00] and the trump of god the lord himself
[56:03] here he had to trust no other angel to
[56:06] come to cut this bride

[56:35] [Applause]
[56:37] all glory of god
[56:39] and the lion of the tribe of judah

[56:46] oh praise the name of the lord
[56:48] no singing no praises no altar nothing
[56:51] silence

[56:54] hour all the hosts of heaven was silent
[56:58] when this seven seal mystery in the book
[57:01] of redemption was broken think of it but
[57:04] it's broke
[57:06] oh hallelujah
[57:07] who could say it wasn't broke

[57:21] oh my heaven going back with noise man
[57:24] because heaven is full of worship you

[57:30] hold that back for half an hour after
[57:32] half an hour is back to worship it's
[57:34] back to shouts because shout
[57:37] because the lord has given you the city
[57:40] after half an hour is a year of jubilee

[57:44] your family you're going back to your
[57:46] prayer life you're going back to
[57:47] inheritance you're going back to that
[57:49] anointing that make you a super church a
[57:52] super race as super people on the earth
[57:57] i am convinced
[57:58] that there is a super race on the earth
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:02] all this racist nonsense is only
[58:04] impersonating a true elect race that god
[58:08] put on the earth
[58:10] with the dna of god
[58:12] hallelujah makes you
[58:15] not superior
[58:16] but make you to be like god
[58:20] a god man on the earth
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:27] glory
[58:28] glory
[58:29] glory
[58:31] [Applause]
[58:33] my jesus
[58:35] you remember caesar
[58:37] that super gene
[58:38] make you transcend natural and
[58:40] supernatural
[58:42] look at jesus going to a wedding and
[58:44] wine ran out
[58:48] and they man i study wine right now do
[58:50] you say what i have to do with that
[58:52] what i'll do with that i'm a guest like
[58:54] everybody else
[58:56] but then he had instructions whatever he
[58:58] said do it
[59:00] got his word not normal
[59:02] he just speak by faith and walk by faith
[59:04] his word could create things just like
[59:06] that
[59:07] so don't fool with what he said whatever
[59:08] he said just do it
[59:10] he said take some bottles and just draw
[59:12] it draw the water out of it listen
[59:14] you're pouring water and you're pouring
[59:15] out wine you're full in water and
[59:17] pouring out wine you're full in water
[59:19] and pouring on wine don't let the water
[59:21] fool you you're going to pour old wine
[59:23] oh oh my god
[59:28] hallelujah
[59:30] you know what wine is wine is
[59:32] stimulation
[59:34] of revelation
[59:35] wine is what makes you stand up why is
[59:38] what makes you shout what is going to
[59:40] make it all hallelujah
[59:42] why make it crazy
[59:44] it's being revealed to you
[59:47] by your father
[59:50] flesh and blood have not reveal it
[59:54] [Applause]
[1:00:06] and that's the problem lacking
[1:00:08] people like revelation know the bible
[1:00:10] true and god is true and god is true but
[1:00:12] not revelation
[1:00:13] but if you get revelation a different
[1:00:14] thing like that
[1:00:16] look at simeon
[1:00:17] old man it was revealed to him
[1:00:20] that he shall see deathly lord christ
[1:00:22] cancer come flicker cancer so
[1:00:28] grim reaper come he said take a spin
[1:00:32] not yet
[1:00:33] as long as you see christ you can do
[1:00:35] nothing
[1:00:36] grim people gave me wink i went guys say
[1:00:38] wink how much i want a wink
[1:00:41] make a spin
[1:00:42] you can't touch me you could watch me
[1:00:44] but until messiah come you can do one
[1:00:46] thing
[1:00:48] because these eyes are anointed
[1:00:50] to see messiah
[1:00:54] [Applause]
[1:00:56] what are you anointed for this morning
[1:00:59] what are you anointed for this morning
[1:01:01] tell me tell me tell me what are you
[1:01:02] anointed for this morning
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:10] every day
[1:01:11] he's coming to church
[1:01:12] old man
[1:01:14] who are you coming to church for
[1:01:16] i come to see christ
[1:01:19] old man we'll be giving you a rocking
[1:01:21] chair for retirement
[1:01:23] i still communistic christ
[1:01:25] old man we improve on your bed home
[1:01:28] relax he said no
[1:01:31] one day
[1:01:32] one day
[1:01:34] every day
[1:01:36] on the expectation
[1:01:37] because you have revelation
[1:01:39] he knows he's not going to die
[1:01:41] until he sees the christ
[1:01:43] and hear what david said i shall not die
[1:01:46] but live
[1:01:48] to declare
[1:01:49] the works of the lord
[1:01:51] the lord are chasing me sure
[1:01:54] but he has not given me over under death
[1:01:57] so don't complain
[1:01:59] stand up like a man
[1:02:01] you're gonna make it stand up like a man
[1:02:03] you're gonna break out stand up like a
[1:02:05] man
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:08] come on you royal seat of abraham
[1:02:12] don't stagger
[1:02:14] don't give up
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:28] don't ever think your prayers means
[1:02:30] nothing
[1:02:32] because when john began to praise
[1:02:34] his prayer
[1:02:36] his prayers
[1:02:37] was breaking dimensions
[1:02:39] pray prayers praises something else
[1:02:42] prayer is something else you know prayer
[1:02:44] can stop and earth and hit heaven
[1:02:48] and you don't even know when it hits
[1:02:50] heaven's door
[1:02:51] but when god hears it he says yes you
[1:02:53] know
[1:02:55] i've heard
[1:02:57] the people are desperate they really
[1:02:59] want a revival the freddie want the holy
[1:03:01] ghost they really want the supernatural
[1:03:04] to break amongst them
[1:03:06] they are hungry for god
[1:03:09] i feel it this morning
[1:03:10] there's a test in the camp
[1:03:12] i love it
[1:03:14] any preacher going to love this i feel a
[1:03:16] deep calling to a deep
[1:03:18] i feel you're groaning in spirit
[1:03:20] i feel the abilities about the comfort
[1:03:23] when zion travail
[1:03:25] zion brought fought
[1:03:27] all glory to god is a travailing zion
[1:03:30] there's got to come as travail in zion
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:39] you wanna be seated
[1:03:41] the world worries because i don't know
[1:03:43] what he done or will do
[1:03:45] but don't have nothing to do with what
[1:03:46] we get to do
[1:03:48] what he don't know what they do don't
[1:03:49] know how to do
[1:03:50] but what the bride have to do
[1:03:52] the bride have to do
[1:03:54] oh we have some some heavy stuff
[1:03:56] this morning hallelujah praise god
[1:03:58] praise god
[1:04:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:02] and then he went further to say
[1:04:04] my
[1:04:06] as certain as i stand on the platform
[1:04:08] tonight
[1:04:09] i had the revelation that will reveal of
[1:04:12] that seventh seal
[1:04:13] it is in a three-fold manner
[1:04:15] and i will speak to you of enough of a
[1:04:18] fold of it
[1:04:19] he said what happened is that those
[1:04:21] seven thunders that he heard thunder i
[1:04:23] was forbidden to write what's the
[1:04:25] mystery lane those seven consecutive
[1:04:27] thunders rolling out
[1:04:30] oh harlow the mystery under the seventh
[1:04:32] seal
[1:04:33] seven thunders
[1:04:34] that the devil knows nothing about
[1:04:37] it was silent
[1:04:38] so he can't interpret it he has no
[1:04:39] revelation of it he don't understand it
[1:04:41] he can't connect with it so anytime you
[1:04:43] talk about thunders he's totally
[1:04:44] confused
[1:04:46] his cabeza can't handle that
[1:04:49] his spirit can handle that
[1:04:51] hallelujah praise god but the bride
[1:04:53] could handle that
[1:04:54] because that restores her image
[1:04:56] and the likeness of god back into a
[1:04:59] bride
[1:05:00] that is what make her a super race and a
[1:05:01] super church and the super people
[1:05:03] they're going to be amazed at the
[1:05:04] confidence that god put in your spirit
[1:05:07] and in your heart but they're gonna take
[1:05:08] note that you have been with jesus
[1:05:11] because what jesus did you'll be doing
[1:05:12] the same thing too
[1:05:14] these things jesus began and continued
[1:05:17] to do
[1:05:18] hallelujah if the first church wrote a
[1:05:20] book of acts and next to sky write books
[1:05:26] i will say it again if the first church
[1:05:28] wrote a book of acts we can be writing
[1:05:30] books
[1:05:31] and reading books we have to write
[1:05:33] another book of acts
[1:05:39] book of acts means shaking off the snake
[1:05:41] in the fire
[1:05:42] not going to the doctor and say oh god
[1:05:44] there you go there like a snake bite me
[1:05:45] no no shake it off and the snake good is
[1:05:47] dead
[1:05:48] he dead
[1:05:51] fire kill him
[1:05:52] shake it off
[1:05:53] when the snake bites everybody looking
[1:05:55] for the dead look at me they give up
[1:05:56] looking at the write-off right then
[1:05:58] you're off before they're trying to
[1:05:59] write you off they want to write you off
[1:06:02] but god didn't write you off god put
[1:06:04] your name down
[1:06:05] in the book that's why the devil
[1:06:08] he's exposed this morning
[1:06:18] don't believe you're just ordained to
[1:06:19] get sick and die
[1:06:20] don't accept that
[1:06:22] don't accept that
[1:06:24] let god sign you off not let it ever
[1:06:25] sign you
[1:06:27] don't ever take what the devil tell you
[1:06:28] you're sick you can't make it this far
[1:06:30] breaking this door close that door
[1:06:32] closed well you close the doors
[1:06:35] and you can open any door you close
[1:06:37] the only door that you can't open it
[1:06:38] with god that god's shot
[1:06:41] don't let the devil shut not off for you
[1:06:43] let god open the door he's a waymaker
[1:06:47] [Applause]
[1:06:56] so brother berlin
[1:06:58] i believe we are so close to the coming
[1:07:00] of the lord jesus
[1:07:01] it behooves us to do all that we
[1:07:03] possibly can
[1:07:04] to bring every soul to the kingdom
[1:07:06] and to bring the kingdom
[1:07:08] to the people
[1:07:10] that we might be healed of our spirit
[1:07:14] and i believe that the body of jesus is
[1:07:15] the sickest body i know of
[1:07:17] the spiritual body of christ on earth is
[1:07:19] very sick
[1:07:21] so do you talk about physical healing
[1:07:23] but what about the healing of your soul
[1:07:25] of your mind of your past of your sins
[1:07:28] to be released from your guilt
[1:07:30] and you can't get out your own
[1:07:31] condemnation
[1:07:32] and can't condemn the rot you were in
[1:07:34] how do you get out of it
[1:07:36] how do you pull out of it they cry and
[1:07:38] seem like god not hearing you you cry
[1:07:40] you're called you pray and see my god is
[1:07:41] silent
[1:07:42] but god is not silent as if you're doing
[1:07:44] nothing amen
[1:07:46] i believe in my heart that's his
[1:07:48] response
[1:07:49] has to do with your response
[1:07:51] amen isn't that right
[1:07:53] praise god that woman told us that if i
[1:07:54] could just touch the hem of his garment
[1:07:56] i made hole she pressed away and she was
[1:07:58] made home
[1:07:59] isn't that right one time a baby brown
[1:08:01] was pretty
[1:08:02] the baby was raised from the dead next
[1:08:04] woman she heard about that baby recently
[1:08:06] that her baby was dead
[1:08:08] and she went to the convention she went
[1:08:09] to the meeting and she pressed away she
[1:08:11] passed her leg she pushed she pushed she
[1:08:12] pushed
[1:08:13] and brother bannon tell somebody go down
[1:08:15] and pray for she doesn't know who she
[1:08:17] doesn't know who i am
[1:08:19] and eventually she pressed away so much
[1:08:21] her faith was present it's not just her
[1:08:25] physical body person her faith is what
[1:08:27] was pushing her her faith went up the
[1:08:30] hill
[1:08:31] her faith break that dimension
[1:08:33] of time
[1:08:34] and went into that higher dimension
[1:08:37] heaven dropped down a vision on brother
[1:08:38] branham saw the baby smiling
[1:08:40] and that woman who was at the back had
[1:08:42] to come to the front he said bring that
[1:08:43] baby to me
[1:08:46] and the baby was raised from the dead
[1:08:49] why because feet broke through and
[1:08:52] caught heaven's attention
[1:08:54] you see faith
[1:08:55] heaven must respond to faith
[1:08:58] must it's compulsory heaven cannot
[1:09:01] ignore faith
[1:09:02] faith is like racket in heaven
[1:09:04] faith is a heavy noise
[1:09:06] that interrupt what's going on in heaven
[1:09:09] when them through a voice our god is
[1:09:11] able to deliver us but if we really
[1:09:12] deliver us we will not bow down
[1:09:15] listen one word
[1:09:16] bomb said the angel

[1:09:44] them
[1:09:45] in the fire
[1:09:47] fire can't burn them they say we put

[1:10:18] no but something somebody created and
[1:10:20] you lift you up
[1:10:22] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:10:24] that's what you have to do you had to
[1:10:25] worship him
[1:10:26] when it sound good give a shout

[1:10:59] christian and a holy ghost-filled
[1:11:01] christian
[1:11:02] isn't that right the first place is a
[1:11:04] christian professor to be a christian
[1:11:06] but if this christian has not yet been
[1:11:07] filled with the holy ghost he's only in
[1:11:09] the process of being a christian he is
[1:11:12] professed to believe it he's working to
[1:11:14] it but god has not given him the spirit
[1:11:16] of the holy ghost he has not yet reached
[1:11:18] that goal with god
[1:11:20] that god recognized it
[1:11:22] and abraham found abraham was faithful
[1:11:24] to the promise that god gave him
[1:11:26] that he will have a child and god here
[1:11:29] we go confirm his fate by giving him a
[1:11:32] sign a sign of circumcision which is a
[1:11:35] type of the holy spirit
[1:11:37] he said you talk to me
[1:11:40] you let me talk to a man two minutes i
[1:11:43] could tell you whether he received the
[1:11:44] holy ghost or not
[1:11:46] you so can you it separates them it's a
[1:11:49] mark you are so different
[1:11:51] when the holy spirit comes on you until
[1:11:54] the mind of this world don't like you
[1:11:56] they're against you they want nothing to
[1:11:58] do with you at all you're born of
[1:12:00] another world listen you are just as
[1:12:03] much alien listen ten times more alien
[1:12:06] you will be if you go to the far flung
[1:12:08] regions of african jungle
[1:12:11] you're ten times more alien than that
[1:12:15] you are different
[1:12:17] when the holy spirit comes it's a mark
[1:12:20] among the people
[1:12:22] so you are a alien
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:27] you from outer space
[1:12:32] before there was a moon
[1:12:34] before there was a star
[1:12:37] before there was a molecule
[1:12:39] you from back there
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:44] so you belong to a higher order
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:53] you belong to a god class
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:59] i see some of you looking
[1:13:01] you look like you wonder if this thing
[1:13:02] is really true you know
[1:13:06] some of you watching me with unbelief
[1:13:08] you're looking at me like sarah
[1:13:10] but i still believe for you
[1:13:13] [Applause]
[1:13:24] outer space
[1:13:26] aliens
[1:13:28] higher order
[1:13:30] god
[1:13:32] different people all together
[1:13:34] look at peter curse deny christ run cry
[1:13:38] hide on himself
[1:13:39] but when the holy ghost
[1:13:42] came upon the seed
[1:13:44] here we go that was in peter
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:48] and change him
[1:13:50] all of a sudden
[1:13:52] that cuss bud
[1:13:54] that man who cursed and swear
[1:13:56] and a writer 50 days ago
[1:13:58] that man could say silver and gold
[1:14:01] i don't have
[1:14:03] because where i come from
[1:14:05] don't even need silver and gold
[1:14:08] and the power
[1:14:09] that i'm empowered with
[1:14:11] didn't come by silver
[1:14:15] but what i have
[1:14:17] such as i have
[1:14:19] i give it unto you
[1:14:21] rise up and walk
[1:14:23] in the name of jesus
[1:14:30] and i tell you rise out of your
[1:14:31] depression

[1:14:35] in the name of jesus
[1:14:38] receive your breakthrough
[1:14:44] you may be seated
[1:14:46] hallelujah
[1:14:48] glory
[1:14:49] because jesus
[1:14:51] did not bypass his theophany
[1:14:54] because jesus came from thought toward
[1:14:57] the flesh he knew all things
[1:14:59] so he knew he belonged to that god class
[1:15:02] higher class
[1:15:03] superman
[1:15:04] hallelujah god himself
[1:15:07] word made flesh
[1:15:08] so you have to let the brothers know
[1:15:10] they come from that same class too
[1:15:13] but they couldn't reveal it to them you
[1:15:15] have to come back from the father the
[1:15:16] spirit
[1:15:17] so he said i will not leave you

[1:15:20] i'm gonna come to you listen while the
[1:15:22] world see at me no more but you are
[1:15:25] going to see me

[1:15:32] on now oh
[1:15:36] hallelujah to introduce
[1:15:40] this god class you may be seated he
[1:15:42] began to do some works
[1:15:44] and when he brought as punishment to
[1:15:45] disciples
[1:15:47] he said don't worry
[1:15:48] the same works i do
[1:15:50] shall you do also because you don't know
[1:15:53] it yet
[1:15:54] but at that day
[1:15:55] you want to know
[1:15:57] i am in the father you are in me
[1:16:00] and i am you
[1:16:01] you belong to that same god class
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:14] oh help me jesus
[1:16:16] and that's why the bible said if that
[1:16:17] same spirit
[1:16:18] that raised christ from the dead
[1:16:21] dwelling you
[1:16:22] it's gonna quicken your mortal body
[1:16:26] if that same spirit

[1:16:31] if that same spirit
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:47] oh glory
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:51] what about him said right now
[1:16:52] he said your geophone is near by you
[1:16:55] and you're getting a charge from it

[1:16:59] you your theophany anointing you like a
[1:17:01] charge going to battery you are being
[1:17:03] charged up this morning
[1:17:05] you're going to be running devils
[1:17:07] the lord has given you the victory
[1:17:10] shout
[1:17:12] for the lord i've given you the city
[1:17:14] [Applause]

[1:17:32] job had no bible
[1:17:34] joe had no service
[1:17:36] he had no elders or some leaders
[1:17:38] he just had inspiration
[1:17:41] job was under a test
[1:17:43] not caused by himself
[1:17:45] he didn't start it he didn't invite it
[1:17:48] he didn't ask god for it it just came
[1:17:51] because god told the devil there's a man
[1:17:53] on the earth there's none like him
[1:17:56] have you considered him
[1:17:58] because i've got something in him that
[1:18:00] you cannot take out
[1:18:03] come on now and i say
[1:18:05] i say today there is something in you
[1:18:08] that that devil just can't take out
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:28] [Applause]
[1:18:46] you might be seated
[1:18:48] that's why
[1:18:50] that's right brother brown says god's
[1:18:51] love is that parental love you love your
[1:18:53] child love your child and my baby and
[1:18:55] whatnot that's not the kind of love god
[1:18:57] has
[1:18:58] his approval is in christ beloved
[1:19:00] so he could put you in the lion's den
[1:19:02] that's love he can put you in fire but
[1:19:04] that's love
[1:19:05] as long as in christ you're find
[1:19:08] what shall separate me from the love of
[1:19:11] god that's in christ jesus
[1:19:14] trials testaments tribulations
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:29] that's the reason why i sing
[1:19:31] that's the reason i shout because of him
[1:19:35] because of christ
[1:19:37] hallelujah
[1:19:39] that's the reason i stand
[1:19:42] my god
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:19:46] there's power in the blood
[1:19:48] there is wonder working power in the
[1:19:50] blood
[1:19:51] what can wash away my sin
[1:19:56] nothing but the blood of jesus
[1:20:00] what can make me whole again
[1:20:04] nothing but the blood
[1:20:06] of jesus
[1:20:09] oh
[1:20:10] precious is the flow
[1:20:14] that makes me white
[1:20:16] has
[1:20:24] nothing but the blood of jesus

[1:30:06] without even studying whether they have
[1:30:07] a writ out famous warrant arrest for
[1:30:10] murdering a man he had nothing to do
[1:30:11] with that

[1:30:44] to bring the people to this mountain
[1:30:46] he said look the ticket here you're
[1:30:48] going and you're coming back
[1:30:49] guaranteed

[1:34:32] they were covering peter with their
[1:34:34] prayer
[1:34:35] asking for peter deliverance
[1:34:37] it was the prayers of the saints
[1:34:40] it was going up to god
[1:34:42] your single prayer like a little note
[1:34:49] but when it's come together it makes a
[1:34:51] harmony
[1:34:53] it strikes a chord
[1:34:55] it plays a tune to god
[1:34:58] when the saints were praying and prayer
[1:35:00] went up to god
[1:35:01] on behalf of peter the kids open up

[1:36:32] group of people he deals with the truth
[1:36:33] as individuals each individual in the
[1:36:35] church and now it's got to a time
[1:36:37] there's no secret here we go
[1:36:39] we all see it when a man proves and god
[1:36:41] loves him he takes him out somewhere to
[1:36:44] himself and dear in the front of angel
[1:36:47] he does something for him he lifts him
[1:36:50] up and there in the presence of god
[1:36:52] gives him and fills them and sets him
[1:36:53] out that's the age we are living in
[1:36:56] that god taking his sons and daughters
[1:36:58] and blessing them and you can't do
[1:37:00] nothing about it it's just god hand upon
[1:37:03] that person's life
[1:37:05] the same holy spirit that saved the
[1:37:06] lutherans signify the methodists
[1:37:08] baptized the pentecostal is now setting
[1:37:11] in order the coming of the lord jesus
[1:37:13] when it will be so powerful that body
[1:37:15] will come into this group of church will
[1:37:17] draw the rest of them from the grave
[1:37:19] that and there'll be a resurrection that
[1:37:21] is what the holy ghost was given for
[1:37:24] it wasn't given forth just to say we
[1:37:25] have the holy ghost it was given for a
[1:37:27] purpose to bring perfection to bring on
[1:37:30] the resurrection
[1:37:31] that is what god released his spirit
[1:37:33] full what is the holy ghost without us
[1:37:35] the economy made perfect they live in
[1:37:37] one day under that we live in another
[1:37:39] day when the enemy comes like a flood
[1:37:41] the spirit of god raises standards
[1:37:43] against it the spirit of god raises the
[1:37:45] standard what is it he's pouring in the
[1:37:47] spirit then those were arrested in the
[1:37:49] grave under the altar saying crying how
[1:37:51] long lord how long how much longer god
[1:37:53] is waiting on me and you the church is
[1:37:55] waiting on me a new adoption time when

[1:38:23] creating a tabernacle a house a dwelling
[1:38:26] place for him to come in step into it we
[1:38:29] become the capstone bride the magnet
[1:38:31] bride for christ to step into it to pull

[1:38:48] god got a minority somewhere he's got a
[1:38:50] church that'll move right on with the
[1:38:52] baptism of the holy ghost and claim in
[1:38:54] the light your testimony today will make
[1:38:56] judgment against this city our testimony
[1:38:58] is the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:39:00] power of god a holy life will bring
[1:39:02] judgment against this city
[1:39:05] what do you need the holy ghost for what
[1:39:07] is for is to give you power of prayer
[1:39:10] power of speech power for a holy life
[1:39:14] that is what the holy ghost is given for
[1:39:17] power of prayer power of speech
[1:39:20] power for holy life isn't that right
[1:39:23] some people say i can't quit drinking i

[1:41:20] it's to give unction to the preacher

[1:41:26] so you have to see unction on the
[1:41:28] preacher virtue power upon the preacher
[1:41:31] that's what the holy ghost is supposed
[1:41:32] to do no no dry intellectual lecture
[1:41:34] stuff no unction come to the preacher
[1:41:38] power of speech

[1:41:46] that is the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:41:48] function to the preacher is to give
[1:41:50] holiness to the group here we go is to
[1:41:53] set the church in order it's to bring
[1:41:55] the unity of the spirit it's to unite us
[1:41:58] together with power
[1:42:00] leopard convention and books on taste
[1:42:02] with power
[1:42:03] power pull you power upon me
[1:42:05] we get united
[1:42:07] oh glory to god how many believe that
[1:42:10] you're inspired on your job you're
[1:42:12] inspired in school you're inspired when
[1:42:14] you go home you're anointed with god
[1:42:20] look what iran was praying for a woman
[1:42:21] uh praying in a prayer line a woman came
[1:42:23] up with a baby
[1:42:25] and the testimony was something like
[1:42:26] this
[1:42:27] he said
[1:42:28] baby's already healed
[1:42:30] the woman next to the woman when she was
[1:42:31] sitting down fell left to pray for that
[1:42:33] baby
[1:42:34] and she prayed for that baby
[1:42:36] her prayer god honor the prayer of that
[1:42:38] woman for that child
[1:42:40] brother branham said god knew that woman
[1:42:42] had more compassion
[1:42:46] than him to pray for that child
[1:42:48] so see what god using
[1:42:50] that you could step into somebody's
[1:42:52] shoes
[1:42:53] and feel their pain
[1:42:55] and then effectively minister to them in
[1:42:58] prayer
[1:42:59] and spirit
[1:43:00] is not a mechanical thing
[1:43:03] it's a hard thing
[1:43:10] you know how hard it was be for that
[1:43:12] woman caught in adultery
[1:43:15] in the very act
[1:43:17] do you know the shame and the
[1:43:19] embarrassment she must have felt
[1:43:21] by all these high priest looking men
[1:43:23] with all the long gong and whatnot and
[1:43:25] had the insights in and who was outside
[1:43:30] you know jesus felt dealing with that
[1:43:32] whole scenario he turned his back on
[1:43:34] them and right in the sun
[1:43:36] he gave them a chance to leave one by
[1:43:37] one he knew they would leave
[1:43:40] because he dropped the picture on them
[1:43:41] in the mirror and said look at all his
[1:43:43] elves take a peek if you like where you
[1:43:45] see all right
[1:43:47] you big stone
[1:43:48] when they look so they couldn't handle
[1:43:49] what they're seeing
[1:43:51] what's the mirror you put
[1:43:53] check yourself out first
[1:43:55] and they couldn't handle it they walk
[1:43:56] away
[1:43:57] so you could understand how the
[1:43:58] compassion that jesus dealt with to deal
[1:44:00] with that woman
[1:44:02] to tell a woman neither do i commit then
[1:44:04] condemn thee go and sin no more
[1:44:06] you could understand how he was reaching
[1:44:08] out to the woman out of the world
[1:44:09] you can understand how he caught a blind
[1:44:11] batimus you can understand and and it's
[1:44:13] interesting
[1:44:14] because a blind man come to him and
[1:44:15] jesus what will you want me to do for
[1:44:17] you
[1:44:19] and a man blind like a bat
[1:44:22] and you could see that
[1:44:23] but he still wanted to come out your
[1:44:25] mouth
[1:44:26] what do you want me to do
[1:44:29] for you
[1:44:31] lord to receive my sight that's what he
[1:44:34] wanted to hear
[1:44:36] be the hole go and see
[1:44:38] receive your sight
[1:44:40] receive your deliverance receive your
[1:44:42] breakthrough receive your healing
[1:44:45] receive your victory receive your
[1:44:46] comfort
[1:44:52] hallelujah glory hallelujah
[1:44:55] so the breastplate of aram
[1:44:57] aaron called human thumb
[1:45:00] had 12 stones and isaac shared it with
[1:45:02] you
[1:45:03] and anytime somebody got a dream of
[1:45:04] vision they would bring it and speak it
[1:45:07] the stones would blood dormant dead
[1:45:09] nothing but when you speak it
[1:45:11] a supernatural light used to glow
[1:45:13] like a rainbow light to say that's god
[1:45:17] so that's how they knew the dream or the
[1:45:19] vision of the prophecy was of god
[1:45:22] if somebody speak it and nothing
[1:45:23] happened
[1:45:26] thumbs down
[1:45:27] and that one
[1:45:29] so but i'm saying here now if that
[1:45:30] supernatural light and the human torment
[1:45:32] did not flash it was rejected because
[1:45:34] god was not in it
[1:45:36] i want you to hear
[1:45:38] listen
[1:45:39] any message
[1:45:41] regardless if it's from priests from
[1:45:43] preacher from prophet or anything else
[1:45:45] any man
[1:45:46] no matter how spiritual
[1:45:49] what his office is
[1:45:51] what he has done if he raised the dead
[1:45:54] if he healed the sick if he's the
[1:45:56] archbishop of canterbury if he's the
[1:45:58] pope of rome if he's the head of any
[1:46:00] denomination no matter how spiritual
[1:46:02] though he has spoken tongues dance in
[1:46:04] the spirit to all he preached the gospel
[1:46:07] no matter what he has done
[1:46:08] if his message doesn't come up the bible
[1:46:11] it's wrong
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:17] this is god's human family
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:29] so the iran priesthood has done over it
[1:46:31] but we still have our human tongue which
[1:46:33] is the bible it has to flash isn't that
[1:46:36] right
[1:46:36] it's all a dream
[1:46:39] okay whatever he saw the secret like
[1:46:41] okay skip that down
[1:46:43] praise the name of the lord
[1:46:51] so he can't be one quote here it has to
[1:46:52] be lined up online it hasn't reached the
[1:46:55] scriptures to bring out the whole
[1:46:56] picture isn't that right
[1:46:58] oh my hallelujah the holy ghost ought to
[1:47:01] be more important to you than everything
[1:47:03] else
[1:47:04] there is in the world your prestige your
[1:47:07] life your job you anything that there is
[1:47:10] you should not cease until you have it
[1:47:12] you must receive it it must be the most
[1:47:15] you say well i'm afraid they're at my
[1:47:17] work i'm afraid that my husband don't be
[1:47:19] afraid that be the first place to let
[1:47:21] everything else go i expect to get it
[1:47:23] one of these days brother branham no not
[1:47:25] one of these days no this is the time
[1:47:28] let it be first before you before i do
[1:47:30] everything else let me have it now
[1:47:33] praise god desperate you get desperate
[1:47:35] you already got to have it or die
[1:47:37] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:47:40] praise be to jesus that's what the holy
[1:47:43] ghost supposed to mean to you isn't that
[1:47:45] right
[1:47:46] now joshua to divide the land what if he
[1:47:48] liked the tribe of god better than the
[1:47:50] tribe of benjamin
[1:47:51] driver ephraim
[1:47:53] what did he like to try but joseph
[1:47:54] better than judah he didn't do it that
[1:47:56] way
[1:47:57] he divided it according to the word
[1:48:01] revealed by the spirit he divided it
[1:48:04] according to tribe and notice he done it
[1:48:07] by revelation by the deserement of god's
[1:48:10] spirit each
[1:48:11] one of those hebrew mothers giving birth
[1:48:13] to those babies called their name and
[1:48:15] each one of their name had a meaning
[1:48:18] jacob when he was born being a twin she
[1:48:20] called him a planter but when he got
[1:48:21] overcoming power his name was changed a
[1:48:24] prince isn't that right and when the the
[1:48:26] creating each one of those hebrew
[1:48:28] mothers in their travailing and
[1:48:30] childbirth called the name of reuben and
[1:48:34] placed him positionally in palestine
[1:48:36] so the child birth
[1:48:37] the travail brought out the name has to
[1:48:41] place them
[1:48:42] and before we leave here you have to be
[1:48:44] placed
[1:48:45] so it will take some travel
[1:48:49] to positionally place you
[1:48:52] [Applause]
[1:48:54] it will take more than just a man
[1:48:56] it will literally take a travel
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:02] you must want your position
[1:49:06] you must desire your place in christ
[1:49:11] we're not talking about the position of
[1:49:12] the church at this electricity or
[1:49:15] something we're not talking about that
[1:49:16] that's easy
[1:49:20] we're talking about place
[1:49:23] in christ
[1:49:24] because in your place you have faith
[1:49:26] in your place you have power
[1:49:28] in your place you are you anointed in
[1:49:30] your place you're not in anybody's
[1:49:31] business you can't be jealous or envious
[1:49:34] of anybody
[1:49:36] you are comfortable in your position
[1:49:38] because that is what god did for you
[1:49:44] [Applause]

[1:52:50] my god i'm about to get started i ain't
[1:52:53] get started yet
[1:52:54] praise god are you striving trying to
[1:52:56] get started what is this we're going to
[1:52:58] get this thing turning
[1:53:00] oh hallelujah praise god i hope i could
[1:53:02] get turned in before i get too old
[1:53:09] so bad abraham says
[1:53:20] that's the name
[1:53:22] ephraim
[1:53:24] cornraiser so this one gone positioning
[1:53:27] land here
[1:53:28] and that land good for raising corn he's
[1:53:30] a corn specialist
[1:53:33] this one here is in cattle cattle
[1:53:36] specialist
[1:53:37] isn't that right
[1:53:39] other one she put up now watch a
[1:53:42] beautiful type today of what we need at
[1:53:44] joshua for today
[1:53:45] the trouble today
[1:53:48] when we come into the promised land god
[1:53:51] want to raise sheep like ephraim
[1:53:58] and and and god is a cattleman
[1:54:02] but he finds ephraim sheep looking real
[1:54:04] nice
[1:54:08] every man
[1:54:10] one wants to raise something like the
[1:54:11] other every man wants this to be the
[1:54:13] same let god give one man a gift for
[1:54:16] healing
[1:54:17] every man wants to give a healing
[1:54:19] ephraim and god all of them wants to mix
[1:54:22] all up and come as one but we are
[1:54:24] divided in our position
[1:54:28] that's why all the attempts to bring
[1:54:29] unity and unity has failed because unity
[1:54:32] is not coming that way it's not unity
[1:54:35] it's unity of defeat
[1:54:37] and the faith is personal
[1:54:40] you don't have a general faith with it
[1:54:42] it's defeat
[1:54:44] and defeat is christ in you
[1:54:47] that's a peter
[1:54:48] that's why in the book of acts nobody
[1:54:51] asked for bishop permission
[1:54:53] like how would evangelist philip leave
[1:54:54] the whole uh uh uh program i'm going to
[1:54:58] each
[1:55:00] he asked
[1:55:01] bishop please could i leave now
[1:55:05] he was translated to minister to that
[1:55:07] man
[1:55:08] nobody signed up to say well bishop
[1:55:10] should i should i
[1:55:13] stephen i asked that question um you
[1:55:14] think i should preach to them rascals
[1:55:16] out there stephen but you stiff neck and
[1:55:19] i'm circumcised of heart he was a deacon
[1:55:22] he didn't get a sign now singing a
[1:55:24] certificate of preaching
[1:55:25] he give it out
[1:55:27] that was the book of acts
[1:55:29] men of god speaking the word and they're
[1:55:32] being led and directed by god
[1:55:35] when paul shipped wrecking and saying i
[1:55:36] am not supposed to have a ship right
[1:55:38] because i am paul
[1:55:40] i am the apostle i am prophet paul it
[1:55:42] happened
[1:55:44] and you have to deal with it isn't that
[1:55:45] right
[1:55:46] oh praise god so we don't all have gift
[1:55:48] of wisdom we don't all prophesy we do
[1:55:50] not speak with tongues we are not all
[1:55:52] the same god give people separate gifts
[1:55:55] and talents and so on
[1:55:56] isn't that right
[1:55:58] oh glory to god to the east side
[1:56:01] praise god was judah isn't that right
[1:56:04] you say watch the ten commandments on
[1:56:06] the west side

[1:56:13] east side the salt was ruben and the the
[1:56:16] west was ephraim
[1:56:18] and that represented north side then was
[1:56:20] the eagle
[1:56:21] judah the east represented the lion
[1:56:24] the salt reuben represented the man and
[1:56:26] ephraim represented the ox
[1:56:29] and that is what was in the book of
[1:56:30] revelation the four beasts
[1:56:32] faced like a man
[1:56:34] feels like an ox feels like an eagle
[1:56:36] he's like a man and they were guarding

[1:59:47] holy spirit continue to bless his people
[1:59:49] as you wait on his coming
[1:59:51] now a minister cannot bring a revival
[1:59:53] there's no preacher that can bring a
[1:59:54] revival he doesn't pack it with him the
[1:59:57] only thing he can do is be loyal to god
[1:59:59] in his word and the revival has to come

[2:01:54] thousand years you wait till the
[2:01:56] indulgence of the church while you
[2:01:57] strike home to that little remnant after
[2:02:00] the doors of the gentile is closed god

[2:02:12] things will be taken place

[2:02:16] how many believe that
[2:02:18] the doors of the gentiles will be closed
[2:02:20] god going to anoint the church with
[2:02:22] power
[2:02:27] i can't stop now
[2:02:29] i'm in the middle
[2:02:30] put of something
[2:02:31] in prayer in a contest listen to this
[2:02:33] prayer raise up mighty men
[2:02:37] raise the mighty warriors of the faith
[2:02:40] oh hallelujah
[2:02:41] hallelujah that was his prayer the
[2:02:43] prophet is gone where are those mighty
[2:02:46] men
[2:02:47] where are those warriors of the faith
[2:02:49] when daniel prophesied the people that
[2:02:52] know their god
[2:02:53] shall do great exploits
[2:02:55] not just read books and tapes not just
[2:02:57] being a message no you can't exploit
[2:03:01] our exploits of faith
[2:03:03] the sixth sense and demonstration
[2:03:06] [Applause]
[2:03:08] come on now
[2:03:10] we're not preaching word only
[2:03:12] we preaching there's power and
[2:03:13] demonstration of the gospel
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:18] what god is waiting for
[2:03:19] god is trying to place his church in
[2:03:21] position
[2:03:22] to manifest himself
[2:03:24] getting one he can work through and say
[2:03:27] dear is my spirit flowing freely i can
[2:03:31] work here
[2:03:33] i can place him
[2:03:34] get another one
[2:03:36] maybe he could start maybe he could
[2:03:38] start here maybe he could start today
[2:03:41] that god could place one that god could
[2:03:43] say i could send my spirit my spirit can
[2:03:46] flow freely
[2:03:48] unhindered channel no politics
[2:03:51] no sin no unbelief
[2:03:53] just a
[2:03:54] pipe the spirit can flow through
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:02] glory to god glory
[2:04:08] so whenever god expressed himself
[2:04:10] by the word
[2:04:11] all the word listen if it's a hybrid the
[2:04:14] word gets short
[2:04:16] the spirit gets short-circuited so they
[2:04:18] can't flow because some creed or some
[2:04:20] dogma go trying to send the current and
[2:04:22] it's
[2:04:25] blow the fuse
[2:04:26] but when the current is flowing freely
[2:04:28] the word of god expresses itself
[2:04:30] that's why when the word becomes flesh
[2:04:32] the invisible
[2:04:34] becomes visible
[2:04:36] so don't tell me there is no god we had
[2:04:38] to say there is a lack of surrender to
[2:04:40] god

[2:10:12] said when the church

[2:10:17] working within the framework of the
[2:10:18] christian church and with god's spirit

[2:11:09] to even give a tremendous exhortation in
[2:11:11] permitting on
[2:11:13] on on tuesday night
[2:11:14] prairie is gone and i want to bring some
[2:11:16] of the quotes from what he shared here
[2:11:18] no one can look at what they see and be
[2:11:20] a christian
[2:11:22] no one can look at what they see and be
[2:11:24] a christian you have got to believe the
[2:11:27] things that are unseen
[2:11:28] by faith you are healed not by sight not
[2:11:32] by feelings
[2:11:34] the supernatural is what you do not see
[2:11:36] but what you believe and act on
[2:11:39] through that
[2:11:40] we become so conscious of looking at one
[2:11:42] another like this but there's an unseen
[2:11:44] world greater than anything you can see
[2:11:47] the unseen world is is more real than
[2:11:49] this world
[2:11:50] because the world that came came from
[2:11:52] things that do not appear
[2:11:58] in other words a person that cancer
[2:12:00] humor a person dying but the unseen
[2:12:02] world saw that person healed
[2:12:05] so the unseen world is greater than this
[2:12:06] world
[2:12:08] and when you're put from the unseen
[2:12:09] world and bringing to this world eyes
[2:12:11] pop open death air you pop open tom
[2:12:14] begin to speak because this unseen world
[2:12:16] is more real than this world because
[2:12:18] this unsealed world could create a new
[2:12:20] world
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:24] oh my oh my didn't mean to keep it slow
[2:12:27] but listen this in this world man is
[2:12:29] continually getting worse
[2:12:32] choosing rather to walk by sight instead
[2:12:33] by faith then when he does he rubs the
[2:12:36] inner man which is the soul the eternal
[2:12:39] part of man
[2:12:40] in this world in this building there are
[2:12:42] evil spirits and war
[2:12:44] and christians anointed and the angels
[2:12:46] of god and camp around them to energize
[2:12:50] them with faith
[2:12:51] and here i am standing here yielding
[2:12:54] myself and the holy spirit is moving
[2:12:57] this is what you call heavenly places
[2:13:00] so when you come to church you come to
[2:13:02] be energized
[2:13:05] when you praise somebody behind you not
[2:13:07] praising god your anointing start to
[2:13:09] sweep and be all around them
[2:13:15] the whole armor of god is supernatural
[2:13:17] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[2:13:20] meekness in the holy ghost all of that
[2:13:22] is unseen
[2:13:24] life faith joy peace all of that is
[2:13:27] unseen every arm of the is looking at
[2:13:29] the unseen the whole armor of god is
[2:13:31] supernatural if you look at your
[2:13:32] crippled hand if you look at your tumor
[2:13:34] it will remain that way look away from
[2:13:36] that and look to the promise of god
[2:13:39] dania was looking at the unseen when he
[2:13:41] went to the lions there the two huber
[2:13:43] boys are going to be unseen when they
[2:13:44] fire furnace if you're watching fiery
[2:13:46] furnace you've got a ball oh god but
[2:13:49] when you look at the unseen you say my
[2:13:50] god if my god to deliver i'm still not
[2:13:53] going to bow down i'm going to go as
[2:13:55] long as god is leading i'm going to go
[2:13:57] he's going to lead me up the mountain
[2:13:59] he's going to leave me down the valley
[2:14:00] he can leave me over the hill wherever
[2:14:02] he's going to go he's going to lead me
[2:14:03] isn't that right
[2:14:05] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:14:08] hallelujah the sixth sense that sense of
[2:14:10] faith is what made the resty push back
[2:14:12] that sixth sense raised the dead by this
[2:14:15] success mighty miracles are be performed
[2:14:17] it's the most powerful force on earth
[2:14:19] your fifth sense delays within your
[2:14:21] brain but your sixth sense lays in your
[2:14:23] heart your five senses lays in your
[2:14:26] brains but this sixth sense come on give
[2:14:28] the lord a shout you're almost done that
[2:14:30] success leaves inside your heart
[2:14:33] guide your heart

[2:14:37] guide your heart
[2:14:39] don't let no bitterness don't let envy
[2:14:41] and evil guard your heart
[2:14:43] because there is where that sick sense
[2:14:44] got the thunder
[2:14:48] oh hallelujah
[2:14:50] glory to god
[2:14:52] because of the sixth sense the lands
[2:14:54] could need daniel they couldn't get near
[2:14:56] him because that sixes were the
[2:14:57] supersense that same sixth sense the
[2:14:59] three voice was thrown in the fiery
[2:15:01] furnace and all reasoning could have
[2:15:03] proven that we were going to death but
[2:15:04] at six and stayed for two three hours
[2:15:07] it's that same sixth sense that have a
[2:15:09] peter paul laying in jail and we're
[2:15:10] going to be headed next day but down in
[2:15:12] mark's house they had a prayer meeting
[2:15:15] and the sixth sense here we go begin to
[2:15:16] accumulate around the jail where he was
[2:15:19] covered by prayer it was the prayers of
[2:15:21] the saints loose in the sixth sense and
[2:15:24] they created atmosphere around the
[2:15:25] prison they wanted cut off brother peter
[2:15:27] head next day but the sick sense of
[2:15:29] faith bust that prison open and lose
[2:15:32] peter from that prison and the devil won
[2:15:34] the cut off your head but today we come
[2:15:36] to guaranteeing you and with the prayers
[2:15:38] of the saints praise god to raise you
[2:15:40] out of that atmosphere that you're in oh
[2:15:43] glory to god it was the sixth sense that
[2:15:46] raised jesus from the dead after he laid
[2:15:48] in the ground he believed the word of
[2:15:49] god destroyed his body in three days i
[2:15:51] would raise it up but he is going down
[2:15:53] but i will raise it up because the sixth
[2:15:55] sense was built in
[2:15:56] oh give the lord some praises people
[2:15:59] hallelujah
[2:16:01] hallelujah
[2:16:02] hallelujah and the prophet said the
[2:16:05] sixth sense oh god pour it out on me
[2:16:07] give it to me
[2:16:09] give it to everyone who needs it paul
[2:16:11] dies sixth sense into me lord
[2:16:15] [Applause]
[2:16:18] oh glory to god
[2:16:20] hallelujah
[2:16:23] i think that no church in his practice
[2:16:25] no matter how intellectual and
[2:16:26] fundamental it might be that church
[2:16:28] cannot strive until the supernatural is
[2:16:31] made known among the people and they see
[2:16:34] it amen just a
[2:16:36] foreign hallelujah from a true sign
[2:16:39] overlook and the torture man many
[2:16:41] wonders why would those things be
[2:16:44] necessary for man to go through it's
[2:16:46] because talk about the prophets it's
[2:16:48] because people won't read the word and
[2:16:49] they won't pray so god is sovereign he
[2:16:52] sends his prophet to be a sign the
[2:16:54] people won't read they don't care to
[2:16:55] read they don't pray because they have
[2:16:57] other things to do they can't take time
[2:16:59] to pray and the bible is awesome to them
[2:17:01] it hasn't got enough action for them
[2:17:02] these days god here we go wants his
[2:17:04] people to pray and when israel got so
[2:17:06] taxed in such a condition that they
[2:17:08] could not go any further their time was
[2:17:10] fulfilled and their burden lived further
[2:17:12] than they thought they begin to pray and
[2:17:15] when the people begin to pray then god
[2:17:17] begins to hear
[2:17:18] it was time for the word of god to be
[2:17:20] fulfilled and ahmad yoshid saw it was
[2:17:24] time for god to be for word to be
[2:17:25] fulfilled they went to prayer to god and
[2:17:28] usually those who pray is the one who
[2:17:30] got the burden and i want to get
[2:17:32] something is hoopery that's ordained of
[2:17:34] god to do so
[2:17:35] watch let them all break down the
[2:17:37] prejudice and say we'll all forget our
[2:17:39] creeds and cataclysm everything else
[2:17:40] isn't it strange that god wants the
[2:17:42] people to have a part into it
[2:17:46] the prayers of the saints
[2:17:47] isn't it strange here why when jesus
[2:17:50] looked up to the harvest he said the
[2:17:51] harvest is right the laborers are few
[2:17:53] you pray
[2:17:54] the lord of the harvest that's was him
[2:17:56] you pray to me that i will send laborers
[2:17:58] into the harvest it is some part you
[2:18:00] have to do god here we go are you ready
[2:18:03] church is everybody up and alive
[2:18:06] god is waiting for his church to call on
[2:18:09] him
[2:18:13] everybody didn't hear that
[2:18:15] because then he thinks i got 100 amen
[2:18:18] god is waiting on his church to call on
[2:18:21] him
[2:18:22] he always did it god is waiting today
[2:18:26] for the people to call his servants into
[2:18:29] action
[2:18:30] the servant can't get into action until
[2:18:33] the people pray
[2:18:36] [Music]
[2:18:37] [Applause]
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:42] i'm not hearing you
[2:18:44] i'm not hearing you
[2:18:46] do you want the church do you want the
[2:18:48] servant of god to come into action
[2:18:51] then you have to have the prayers of the
[2:18:52] saints
[2:18:53] and there's a vile
[2:18:55] there's a container to hold your prayer
[2:18:58] it's like incense unto god
[2:19:05] [Applause]
[2:19:12] we're looking forward for a great time
[2:19:13] in the lord with your prayers i'm sure
[2:19:15] we'll do the best we can for the glory
[2:19:17] of god
[2:19:18] prayer changes things
[2:19:20] prayer changes death to life
[2:19:22] prayer changes sickness to health
[2:19:24] sinners to saints it's prayer
[2:19:26] you may laugh too much
[2:19:28] you may shout too much
[2:19:30] you may eat too much
[2:19:31] but you will never pray too much
[2:19:34] the bible said i would that man would
[2:19:36] pray may the lord bless you
