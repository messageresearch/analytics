[18:42] welcome to Sunday morning feasts around
[18:46] the Word of God amen
[18:49] it was always a pleasure to come into
[18:53] the house of God it's always a privilege
[18:56] I know people just take it for granted
[18:57] go to church go to church but it
[18:59] wouldn't always be like that
[19:01] and you know that praise the name of the
[19:04] Lord
[19:05] well Tuesday night what a prayer meeting
[19:07] we had on Tuesday night and I want to
[19:12] thank all of you for coming out this
[19:13] morning for the sama prayer before
[19:15] service what a atmosphere we want to
[19:19] continue to continue to do that to come
[19:21] early impress all we and I call it a
[19:25] ministry of Prayer those who want to
[19:28] join the prayer various warriors
[19:31] Pereira's isn't that right a Holy Office
[19:34] of Prayer and we shared something I want
[19:37] to bring back something from what we
[19:39] spoke on just before we start the
[19:40] service but we Jesus the word said you
[19:43] have not because you ask not
[19:45] that's why I don't have when you ask
[19:48] your acts without feet you have to ask
[19:51] and fit to believe and the receive isn't
[19:55] that right praise be to God and God
[19:58] ordained prayer as a means obtain what
[20:02] we desire and the thought we shared
[20:05] on Tuesday was give him no rest under
[20:09] the scripture from Isaiah the
[20:11] scriptorium ever and maybe you never
[20:13] thought about but it's a powerful
[20:15] scripture from Isaiah chapter 62 and
[20:18] read in verse 6 and 7 and it reads I
[20:23] have set watchmen upon my thigh walls o
[20:26] Jerusalem which I'll never hold their
[20:29] peace they know night ye that make
[20:34] mention of the Lord keep not silence and
[20:38] give him no rest
[20:40] don't worry Lord now give him no rest
[20:42] till he establish until he make
[20:45] Jerusalem a
[20:47] freeze in the earth and that was the
[20:50] exhortation until tonight give him no
[20:52] rest trouble God knock until the door is
[20:56] open
[20:57] seek until you find ask until is be
[21:00] given don't be discouraged don't give up
[21:04] keep pressing forward ever
[21:07] forward believing that God going to
[21:09] answer his world because God want to
[21:11] confirm his word isn't that right
[21:13] and we want to have the confident
[21:15] expectation of an answer is a waste of
[21:17] time just talking to God and you have no
[21:19] expectation it's a waste of time that
[21:21] you're not even believing and I expected
[21:23] that go on to answer your prayer but
[21:25] when you come believing and expectant
[21:27] then you're on your way in a channel
[21:29] that God could bless you isn't that
[21:31] right an answer in prayer comes by feet
[21:34] come by parents come by praying in
[21:37] his name and come by the will of God all
[21:40] of that put together but the climax of
[21:42] all of that is in sin John 15:7 and it
[21:45] says if he abide in me and my words
[21:47] abide in you you can ask what you will
[21:49] and it shall be done unto you so it
[21:52] comes to a life it come down not just to
[21:55] a performance and just words it come
[21:58] down to you Abidin and the world abiding
[22:01] in you and then you can ask what you
[22:03] will isn't that right
[22:05] so praise God so true the power of
[22:08] prayer God purpose is accomplished in
[22:10] the church hallelujah God is waitin for
[22:14] the people to pray to call his servants
[22:16] and on the scene and by yielding our
[22:20] lives to the Spirit of God we can
[22:23] restore to a healthy order of God isn't
[22:25] that right
[22:26] by giving to the Spirit of God so at
[22:29] this time you understand and we want to
[22:30] go into the word this morning a tree
[22:33] portion of Scripture Genesis chapter 32
[22:36] Isaiah chapter 40 and Luke chapter 4
[22:39] first scripture reading this morning
[22:41] blessed be the name of the Lord John go
[22:45] for the service last Sunday and the
[22:47] service before that but Anthony the
[22:49] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[22:51] God but Isaac speaking about return unto
[22:55] the Lord and the final showdown I was
[22:58] something Eamon praise God
[23:00] blessed be the name of the Lord so
[23:02] Genesis chapter 32 we want to read one
[23:06] verse verse 28
[23:14] and he said thy name shall be called no
[23:18] more Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[23:22] has no power with God and with men and
[23:26] has prevailed as a chapter 41 a repro
[23:31] foolish 28:31 hast thou not known has
[23:42] thou not heard that the everlasting God
[23:45] the God the Lord the creator of the ends
[23:47] of the earth fainteth not neither is
[23:50] weary there is no searching of his
[23:52] understanding he given power to the
[23:55] faint unto them that have no might he
[23:57] increases strength even the youths shall
[24:01] faint and memory and the young men shall
[24:04] utterly fall but they that wait upon the
[24:07] Lord shall renew their strength they
[24:10] shall mount up with wings as Eagles they
[24:13] shall run and not be weary they shall
[24:15] walk and not faint
[24:17] and I looked up to for wanna read from
[24:20] verse 32 to 36 Luke chapter 4
[24:24] this scripture is after Jesus was led by
[24:27] the spirit into the wilderness and he
[24:30] was tempted by the devil and then he
[24:33] went into the temple took up the
[24:35] scriptures and read the scripture of the
[24:36] spirit upon me are we go on don't know
[24:38] to verse 32 and they were astonished at
[24:45] his doctrine for his word was with power
[24:50] and in the synagogue there was a man
[24:53] which had a spirit of an unclean devil
[24:56] and cried out with a loud voice saying
[24:59] let us alone what have we to do with
[25:01] thee doubt Jesus of Nazareth I don't
[25:04] come to destroy us I know thee who thou
[25:06] art the Holy One of God and Jesus
[25:10] rebuked him saying hold thy peace and
[25:13] come out of him when the devil was shown
[25:16] him in the midst he came out of him and
[25:19] heard him not and they were all amazed
[25:22] and speak among themselves seeing what
[25:25] what is this for with authority and
[25:28] power he commanded the unclean spirits
[25:32] and they come out

[33:29] who would unite with it and a boycott
[33:31] but it will be tool in them you already
[33:34] don't took the mark don't say I'll do it
[33:36] you better do it now Ramses is growing
[33:39] but remember why Romney's is growing in
[33:43] power in Egypt God had Moses in the
[33:46] wilderness and he was growing too
[33:51] so while Ramses is growing born of a
[33:54] bride and she is growing true and if God
[33:58] placed that man in power in America God
[34:02] wanted positionally place to brag by
[34:05] power and authority on the air what
[34:10] sites are growing there's gonna be a
[34:13] showdown are you gonna get ready for it
[34:16] are you prepared for it that's gonna be
[34:18] a final showdown even at this prophesied
[34:21] there'll be one more ride Oh gives a lot
[34:24] of shout in the house
[34:26] Oh hallelujah remember why Ramses was
[34:33] growing in the power in Egypt God had
[34:35] Moses in the wilderness he was going to
[34:37] Ramses had a political system Gore had a
[34:41] spiritual system under profit ready to
[34:44] come down and speak to the people oh
[34:47] praise God revelation 6 4 and they went
[34:52] out another horse that was red and was
[34:56] given to him I think in Sam said I've
[34:59] said it once I heard it twice power
[35:01] belongs to God power comes from God God
[35:04] reads the fear of our purpose God
[35:07] promote this one for a purpose he
[35:09] promoted this one to cut him down to
[35:10] show he is God
[35:12] Oh hallelujah I feel good this morning
[35:16] because this would count like God is not
[35:19] a man that we're like God is true they
[35:21] went out another horse was red and power
[35:24] was given unto him that sat thereon to
[35:27] take peace from the earth and that they
[35:30] should kill one another and there was
[35:32] given to him great a great short
[35:34] duration 6-8 and I looked and behold a
[35:37] pale horse his name that sat on him was
[35:40] death and hell followed him and power
[35:44] was given unto them over the fourth part
[35:48] of the
[35:49] to kill with sword with hunger with debt
[35:52] I with the beasts of the earth
[35:54] Oh hallelujah but a Branham from now is
[35:58] in church age he said remember we all
[36:01] have shown clearly through the ages and
[36:03] even as Adam and Eve fell because they
[36:05] left the word so the Ephesians it fell
[36:08] by turning slightly from the world until
[36:10] with every age continuing to turn away
[36:13] we have a final relation of the word by
[36:16] the world church system this loud ISA
[36:19] age ends in a black hole of the word
[36:22] thereby causing a departure of the Lord
[36:25] from the midst he stand outside calling
[36:29] his own who follow him by obedience to
[36:32] the word after a short and powerful
[36:36] demonstration of the Spirit this little
[36:40] hunted persecuted group will go to be
[36:44] with Jesus I want to read that again
[36:47] after a short and powerful demonstration
[36:53] of the Spirit this little hunted
[36:57] persecuted group will go to be with
[37:00] Jesus so we are not here for church we
[37:04] are here for God we are here for the
[37:06] word and the word prophesied that the
[37:09] bride will be a hunted persecuted group
[37:11] but she will have a powerful
[37:13] demonstration of the Spirit and when
[37:17] that bride ministry began to roll they
[37:19] will say what word is this hallelujah
[37:22] what the word is this because this would
[37:25] come with power I'm a Pharisee Oh
[37:28] hallelujah
[37:29] it wouldn't be teaching it wouldn't be
[37:32] explaining it wouldn't be just called
[37:34] him back homes it was what word is this
[37:36] because this preaching is different this
[37:39] is preaching with authority because the
[37:41] Devas are being cast out the sick is
[37:44] being healed the crippled is walking the
[37:47] bynars here what manner of man is this

[39:07] you have to recognize the D and your
[39:10] message from that message but Aram says
[39:12] national force put Israel in a homeland
[39:15] national force will put the church in
[39:19] the work on some churches what is he
[39:21] saying it will become the law just that
[39:24] they have key and all these marriages
[39:26] are not kind of stuff in America it has
[39:28] become law not a matter of realize right
[39:31] or wrong it's dello they keep the Bible
[39:35] of the church their schools they kick
[39:36] pray all the schools and whatnot that's
[39:38] their law constitutional rights and so
[39:40] on okay they want to make America great
[39:43] again that's what the president said
[39:44] right but they don't even know what
[39:46] America whole America begin great to
[39:48] begin with you can't make it again if
[39:52] you don't hold that way I say once more
[39:53] Lord you had to be somewhere first the
[39:55] ball once more
[39:56] Sampson knew what he was talking about
[39:58] Samson wasn't guessing oh I wonder what
[40:00] happened up there no he felt it before
[40:02] he was in contact with power before he
[40:04] had it before he was involved in it
[40:06] before he took up the gates and throw it
[40:09] off he destroyed the lion he licked on
[40:11] the Philistines they were afraid of
[40:13] Samson France and knew what powers and
[40:16] he lost it but he's a son he has
[40:20] available he is available to him yes you
[40:23] may have lost it but you can still get
[40:25] it back that's why he said once more
[40:27] Lord

[40:34] you might be seasoned
[40:35] the Bible says did establish the
[40:38] wilderness because the world it was a
[40:39] mix would fit didn't make it because the
[40:42] word all them hear the same word but
[40:45] with two men Joshua and Caleb have
[40:46] effect upon them they couldn't help it
[40:49] that's why Caleb said is we are more
[40:50] than able to take the land he was
[40:53] convinced because they've got promises
[40:54] this is if God promised power power is
[40:56] coming when are you ready or not it's
[40:59] still coming
[41:01] my you should be shouting on that one

[41:45] him Jesus dead and everything else Jesus
[41:47] rose from the dead walking with him and
[41:48] it's sad and I'm sad and telling Jesus
[41:51] stories and she's also rebuked them and
[41:53] so fools and slow of heart stop that
[41:56] storytelling thing Christ was supposed
[41:58] to pass through that and all things work
[42:00] together for good or they supposed to
[42:01] have a different beat altogether a
[42:03] different understanding altogether
[42:04] praise God it was sad and depressed my

[57:16] that's 680 reads and Stephen full of
[57:23] faith and power did great wonders and
[57:28] miracles among the people not just faith
[57:33] faith and power and Stephen was in my
[57:36] preacher he was a deacon even digging
[57:40] hard faith and power even deacon was
[57:42] doing miracles even Tacoma Scott's not
[57:45] levels God didn't say in my name shall
[57:47] minister the roll cast out devils he

[57:59] whoever they're going the signs going to
[58:02] these signs wherever they're going where

[58:25] following you wherever you go the signs
[58:28] following

[58:42] the blagger spirit follows the blood
[58:46] hundred brothers upon you
[58:50] [Applause]
[58:58] let me season first Corinthians 2 4 and
[59:02] 5 Paul speaking and my speech and my
[59:08] preaching was not with enticing words of
[59:11] man's wisdom but in demonstration of the
[59:16] Spirit and of power that your faith the
[59:20] purpose that your faith should not stand
[59:23] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[59:27] God because when he came and if he come
[59:29] with enticing words they will say what
[59:31] word is this because the experiment
[59:33] planting mysteries an unfallen you what
[59:35] I never see it show but Paul didn't come
[59:37] but never see it so when Paul preached
[59:40] his world was with power the RSA what
[59:43] well is this because the way that man is
[59:46] preaching that man not talking like the
[59:48] scribes and the Pharisees killing
[59:50] diamond Dinah bullpen entertain member
[59:54] jokes and with dice or can old talk know
[59:57] that these were preaching the word with
[1:00:01] power word with power or blowing a god
[1:00:04] word with power
[1:00:06] ok the Lord show this world has to be
[1:00:09] inspired to you yes yes you're not
[1:00:11] coming just to hear you coming to be
[1:00:14] inspired when we finish with you you
[1:00:17] will be looking for the devil's the

[1:03:51] spirit flowing freely understand this
[1:03:54] the objective of God is to make each one
[1:03:57] of your branch connected to him divine
[1:04:00] the objective of God is that the mix of
[1:04:03] vines sub branches is branch connected

[1:04:51] continue but a Branham we talk about
[1:04:56] Ramses and so on they're both growing
[1:04:57] together it would be assured on one of
[1:05:00] these days it will come to a showdown
[1:05:02] watch and you can't get away from it the
[1:05:06] Holy Spirit coming down the mysteries of
[1:05:08] God been revealed and set in order she
[1:05:12] is already in the white house
[1:05:13] the church is pulling itself together
[1:05:16] that's the bride pulling itself together
[1:05:19] not a denomination no out of bondage
[1:05:23] away from the AMA rights of people that
[1:05:25] is free so nobody got campus and see it
[1:05:29] could only go so far and no more she
[1:05:33] dies what he'd ever like to do you cramp
[1:05:34] your style
[1:05:35] isn't that right hinder you sometimes
[1:05:38] telling people it's only wrong twisting
[1:05:40] your stories when you telling the story
[1:05:41] is a setup block you're here I'm
[1:05:42] blocking here because they don't want to
[1:05:43] go forward they don't want you progress
[1:05:45] they want you to be hindered because
[1:05:47] they want to feel that they better than
[1:05:48] you and the better and you all as
[1:05:50] foolishness praise God that's why when
[1:05:52] Abraham tell pick pick pick pick choose
[1:05:55] choose me I want to go and let's see
[1:05:56] Sodom and look to what Saddam's the
[1:05:58] angry near nor they go into words lot
[1:06:02] didn't enter London said oh no no no he
[1:06:04] was just going towards but anyway where
[1:06:07] direction is way efficient that way
[1:06:08] hidden wherever they reached really
[1:06:11] denies he will fall so if you want
[1:06:12] righteousness if you want holiness
[1:06:14] everyone purity if you want undefined
[1:06:15] life if you want a revival you have to
[1:06:17] lean that we
[1:06:18] isn't that right remember remember the
[1:06:23] enemy is the intellectual sign and I
[1:06:28] know people fight this kind of gospel
[1:06:30] because they don't want no spirit in the
[1:06:33] one talking team because they could talk
[1:06:34] plenty and the biggest oven but when it
[1:06:40] come down to what good is this the word
[1:06:44] come with power that's different you
[1:06:47] can't manufacture that no that has to be
[1:06:50] produced by the spirit itself because
[1:06:53] Christ watch are the monitor now
[1:06:55] remember there's only true don't forget
[1:06:57] this there are only two powers one is
[1:06:59] spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the
[1:07:01] other one is the devil working through
[1:07:04] intellectual power and that's what
[1:07:06] happened again the Eden's so understand
[1:07:08] this there's only two powers there's
[1:07:12] only two forces devil and God it's not
[1:07:14] right
[1:07:14] in Egypt there is intellectual power we
[1:07:18] can Ramsey's bringing him bring him up
[1:07:20] to power and raise him up no listen it's
[1:07:23] not intellectual it's an intellectual
[1:07:26] power I don't forget that part
[1:07:29] it's not this brother just intellectual
[1:07:31] it's an intellectual power
[1:07:33] the man is empowered by his intellect so
[1:07:38] he's not trying to like you know he's
[1:07:40] not professor then he's anointed
[1:07:42] intellect as a different kind you know

[1:15:19] thousand wrong special after that source
[1:15:23] had a watch divert cookie i you know the
[1:15:25] story trouble since then after that but
[1:15:28] it's something when you have to come
[1:15:30] into a position of power the tone gets
[1:15:32] into power in a group formation god
[1:15:35] place you as an individual and empower
[1:15:38] you in your spirit in your heart in your
[1:15:41] mind
[1:15:42] david was anointed to be king
[1:15:45] praise God Samuel came and poured oil
[1:15:48] upon him and David had to go back
[1:15:49] because he's not ready yet you may not
[1:15:51] be ready yet but that doesn't mean it's
[1:15:53] not you I want to be a man than that I'm
[1:16:00] talking about you or praising the Lord
[1:16:03] praise goes to be goes further so they
[1:16:06] got their own system it's not what the
[1:16:09] Bible said is what the church said see
[1:16:12] and the Protestants we've listened weave
[1:16:15] into it till in their little groups well
[1:16:17] sure I know it says this but I tell you
[1:16:20] them days is gone the intellectual parts
[1:16:22] look perfect
[1:16:23] here is balm and it is perfect but it's
[1:16:26] perfect the inspirational season and its
[1:16:33] intellectual Rameses was growing
[1:16:34] commented to the throne remember he
[1:16:36] raised up as a brother to Moses see one
[1:16:38] of them had the intellectual seat and
[1:16:40] like Joseph his brethren what did I do
[1:16:42] to little Joseph excommunicate him from
[1:16:44] the world
[1:16:45] the wood is God they excommunicated the
[1:16:47] world and accepted a Creed and now the
[1:16:50] Creed has grown into power so even the
[1:16:52] Creed communist power
[1:16:53] so everybody coming to power you know it
[1:16:55] will be assured on the don't you tell
[1:16:57] you cover the power I never say no God
[1:16:58] she come to power I am doing
[1:17:00] it's power versus Power let's continue
[1:17:04] quality with individuals here we go not
[1:17:06] with groups with individuals only thing
[1:17:08] has to do is the one man he could
[1:17:10] operate wit that's all he wants is one
[1:17:13] man he tried to get them true every age
[1:17:15] he gonna get one man one man decent Noah
[1:17:18] one man is Elijah one man is a John the
[1:17:20] Baptist one man is all he needs these
[1:17:21] are judges you get one man Samson given
[1:17:23] great power he stole it a woman was
[1:17:25] blinded its judges wasn't so God is the
[1:17:27] judge you see he's trying to get one man
[1:17:30] here we go that can he can get in his
[1:17:33] hands and tell the truth that will be
[1:17:37] fearless with it that won't pull no
[1:17:40] punches that will not be dogmatic one
[1:17:43] man he can hold his hands and show it
[1:17:46] with a life and show himself alive one
[1:17:50] man and pizza and disciples they
[1:17:53] struggled after being given power okay
[1:17:56] they were given power the Castro there
[1:17:58] was and so on they didn't have the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost yet but they were given power and
[1:18:02] they were doing a lot of stuff with the
[1:18:03] power that were released upon them even
[1:18:06] Judas had power because it was given to
[1:18:10] them so God could give you power but you
[1:18:13] still need character isn't that right
[1:18:15] because afterwards Pete and get
[1:18:18] frightened and they get afraid because
[1:18:20] the power was no longer there with them
[1:18:21] because Jesus died left and go on they
[1:18:23] were susi with Jesus and if you
[1:18:24] associate with somebody with authority
[1:18:25] you come back you are the authority to
[1:18:27] so come back if I know the Prime
[1:18:29] Minister not Prime Minister my friend I
[1:18:31] could talk to Prime Minister you know
[1:18:32] any Prime Minister you know I could get
[1:18:33] his ears so they had got ears too
[1:18:36] because Jesus was your buddy
[1:18:38] they were part of the system of
[1:18:40] connection to the higher up and they
[1:18:43] could see this woman come and this one
[1:18:46] common and worship and this woman come
[1:18:48] and dig bringing they were the men
[1:18:50] around Jesus so they were effectively
[1:18:52] empowered but a man on rising on his son
[1:18:55] listen to his words they were cowards
[1:18:57] but they had the mechanics
[1:19:01] are you with me they had received the
[1:19:05] word the world was in them they had the
[1:19:07] mechanics but they were cowards but they
[1:19:09] were all sit in back seat I'm afraid of
[1:19:11] them I'm afraid to go out and make a
[1:19:13] claim cause them big bishops and things
[1:19:15] out there my freedom presum things I'm a
[1:19:17] free to make a clean but all of a sudden
[1:19:19] dynamics come this is what we regional
[1:19:23] now all of a sudden this empowers this
[1:19:26] mechanic pyramid inside of them a word
[1:19:28] inside of them cowards but the word in
[1:19:30] them codes but the word in them afraid
[1:19:35] disturb d'Arnaud but the word in them
[1:19:38] all of a sudden dynamics come what did
[1:19:41] it do
[1:19:42] are you ready it's not only fill their
[1:19:45] spirit inside but it quickened their
[1:19:47] mechanics
[1:19:48] their bodies were quickened there were
[1:19:52] no more cowards
[1:19:53] so the Spirit of God is to affect entire
[1:19:56] life including your body not just your
[1:20:02] mind not just your spirit not just your
[1:20:05] soul but your body itself have a promise
[1:20:09] to be influenced by this quitman power
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:15] that's our promise hallelujah
[1:20:18] your body itself to be anointed with God
[1:20:23] Oh hallelujah could be go some more
[1:20:26] their bodies were quicken they were no
[1:20:28] more cowards they went right out in the
[1:20:30] face of people you men are Judea you
[1:20:33] that dwell in Jerusalem where before the
[1:20:35] dynamics come they were just mechanics
[1:20:37] him and mother Clarence
[1:20:39] so before dynamics come it's just
[1:20:41] mechanics Billy the message please the
[1:20:44] word amen glory hallelujah read a book
[1:20:45] is nothing mechanics but when dynamics
[1:20:47] come that's different that's different
[1:20:50] altogether he managed Islam right I'm
[1:20:53] one of them
[1:20:54] this is that that the Prophet spoke of
[1:20:56] and he said if this isn't that will keep
[1:20:58] the stir that comes no this is that I'll
[1:21:01] pour my spirit upon all flesh so Peter
[1:21:04] was taught in the prophecy of Joyal of
[1:21:07] the point of the Spirit so this is then
[1:21:11] they were not just written because jesus
[1:21:13] said behold I send the promise of my
[1:21:15] father upon you that was the revealed
[1:21:17] Word by Sunim on that day but the
[1:21:20] written word from choil
[1:21:22] said I will pour my spirit in the last
[1:21:25] days
[1:21:25] so the reveal was from Jesus connect
[1:21:29] with the written word from Doyle so when
[1:21:34] Peter came out on the scene he said this
[1:21:36] is that that the Prophet Joel speaker he
[1:21:41] could take the manifestation and
[1:21:42] identified back in the Bible back in the
[1:21:45] scripture of what was written Oh
[1:21:46] hallelujah
[1:21:48] so what we are connecting to today is
[1:21:50] not a foreign thing let a strange thing
[1:21:52] you know we looking for power and we
[1:21:53] want power power and the power no no no
[1:21:55] what promise this thing oh and I believe
[1:21:58] it coming today
[1:21:59] I believe I'm expecting it this morning
[1:22:02] I'm expecting it to come upon you I'm
[1:22:05] expecting the you leave a like a
[1:22:06] Superman hallelujah supercharged praise
[1:22:10] God I expect your battery to be fully
[1:22:12] loaded for evil God amen hallelujah some
[1:22:16] of you people that was afraid some woman
[1:22:19] would laugh at you having along here or
[1:22:21] you quit man wake up some of you man
[1:22:22] afraid your organization will show you
[1:22:24] out when you baptized in the scripture

[1:22:30] upper room to Dynamis come it's changed
[1:22:33] them I want to stick stick on that they
[1:22:37] didn't remain the same it changed them
[1:22:39] when dynamics come you don't care what
[1:22:42] uncle say Tandy say mommy daddy brother
[1:22:44] sister it doesn't matter it's what God
[1:22:46] says it's not right I love this it

[1:22:53] them different they were a changed
[1:22:56] people from then on it quickened them
[1:22:59] from an old life of being a coward to
[1:23:02] like the lion of the tribe of Judah the
[1:23:04] dynamics was in the mechanics it
[1:23:06] quickened a mortal body they were so
[1:23:09] quicken the bravery of the landowner but
[1:23:12] Judah fell into them over the weaving of
[1:23:14] the sheaf isn't that right oh here this
[1:23:16] prophecy hallelujah there's gonna be
[1:23:19] more who's gonna give their lives blood
[1:23:21] for this world it was customer and his
[1:23:23] constant flood here we go
[1:23:25] the son has got to be revealed again in
[1:23:32] the bride in the last days the Cretan
[1:23:39] power has got to come to quicken them
[1:23:43] all these deadly nomination increase to
[1:23:46] a Living Word of the Living God so the
[1:23:49] son of man was revealed to a prophet but
[1:23:52] the son of God has to reveal again in a
[1:23:55] bride in the last days by the pitman
[1:23:58] power Eloise has got to be work with
[1:24:00] power hallelujah that is how the son
[1:24:04] would reveal again did leader
[1:24:06] it's quickened into a new life it does
[1:24:10] the same thing for us now they were so
[1:24:13] quickened in that quickness power unborn
[1:24:16] baby a mystery here the quickness power
[1:24:19] wasn't only in their soul it was all

[1:24:25] my my my that's why they take pitches
[1:24:29] off a pause body and people healed

[1:24:38] didn't say that prayin orders just lay
[1:24:39] hands on the sick just lay hands on the
[1:24:42] sick they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:24:45] though you have to pray just to lay
[1:24:48] hands on the sick because the hands are
[1:24:50] anointed the hands in the hands of God

[1:25:48] will go to work upon your life
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:54] he quickened the mechanics watch they
[1:25:57] were so quicken till their tongues begin
[1:25:59] to speak another language they were so
[1:26:01] quickened by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ till their hands they were so
[1:26:05] quicken with a Krypton power till when
[1:26:07] they lay their hands upon the sick they
[1:26:08] got well it quicken your mortal body and
[1:26:11] they were healed by the lean on of hands
[1:26:14] and the spirit quickened the fellowship
[1:26:16] together with God till it was so quicken
[1:26:18] in the presence of God when a person
[1:26:20] died and their soul had gone off they
[1:26:23] call him back to life again
[1:26:25] I'm Branson know I'm feeling religious
[1:26:26] so Paul was preaching man fell off the
[1:26:29] banister fell long dead they pray they
[1:26:31] get him up risen from the dead and
[1:26:33] continue preaching the dead couldn't
[1:26:35] stay dead
[1:26:35] the citizen says sick the depressed
[1:26:38] couldn't say depress the doorknob
[1:26:39] couldn't say Domino because a quick
[1:26:41] temper is there that's what we needed we
[1:26:44] need a revival you must want it you must
[1:26:47] ask God for it you must pray for it you
[1:26:49] must clean it you must want it real bad
[1:26:51] you want a revival the boiler trashed
[1:26:54] out of your life out of your heart out
[1:26:56] of your spirit order your soul you want
[1:26:58] to be revived to God you want have a
[1:27:00] renewed and connection to God your
[1:27:02] father can hold you back
[1:27:04] your mother can hold you back why
[1:27:05] because a revived unto God
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:10] can't nobody Pompeii from the church
[1:27:12] nobody forces them to church you like
[1:27:15] David I was glad when they said unto me
[1:27:17] let us go into the house of God you
[1:27:19] yourself whenever the church becoming a
[1:27:22] cobbler come inspired you come to get an
[1:27:23] anointed glory now this word power
[1:27:35] squeak wood it is Dunamis is the word
[1:27:39] Dunamis is the word it comes from the
[1:27:42] root word dynamo or dynamic and I where
[1:27:46] dynamics come from this word called
[1:27:49] Dunamis is not right
[1:27:51] praise be to Jesus and that Dunamis
[1:27:55] refers to moral power and excellence of
[1:27:59] soul but more than just that it refer to
[1:28:03] that as miraculous power isn't that
[1:28:06] right on Dunamis also refers to it as
[1:28:09] inherent power power residing in the
[1:28:13] thing by virtue of its nature in ours
[1:28:15] resident power not temporary power but
[1:28:20] permanent power power to reproduce
[1:28:23] itself so once this wheel gets turnin
[1:28:26] once this wheel gets activated once that
[1:28:30] Dunamis the corn and turn on inside of
[1:28:32] you enough power
[1:28:34] the rapid so that's right Jesus
[1:28:40] oh my god this is so good devil had a
[1:28:44] rough time with Jesus because he
[1:28:46] couldn't handle him he got a written
[1:28:48] written it written it written written
[1:28:49] and a shock no miracles get shocked and
[1:28:52] Jesus stepped out I began to do miracles
[1:28:54] darica just stunnin repeatedly please
[1:28:57] and that's why they exclaimed what would
[1:28:59] is this man with word of authority and
[1:29:02] power that was Jesus but when he
[1:29:05] freshman disciples he knew that the
[1:29:08] power that he's about to release him to
[1:29:10] them into them would reproduce the same
[1:29:13] thing
[1:29:15] so before I even get deer to give them
[1:29:19] that after the resurrection he began to
[1:29:22] tell them the same looks I do shall you
[1:29:23] do also
[1:29:24] no data data then that was this a seed
[1:29:26] spoken to them he was speaking the
[1:29:28] promises into them if you shall see it
[1:29:30] as long as we move and no doubt in your
[1:29:31] heart you can have what you say so don't
[1:29:34] study that I alone could do this you
[1:29:35] could do this too because where you come
[1:29:37] from I come from - I come from we come
[1:29:39] from the same source it's not right we
[1:29:42] come over Elohim isn't that right so
[1:29:44] Jesus was was trying to anoint them to
[1:29:47] the sense of greatness to their sense of
[1:29:50] where they came from in a sense of the
[1:29:52] ability in God and so on they couldn't
[1:29:55] grasp it fully yet because they didn't
[1:29:56] have resurrection faith did not defeat
[1:29:59] all the promises the way it's supposed
[1:30:01] to be held so it took Christ to come
[1:30:03] back from the dead and appear moong them
[1:30:05] and still burn the scriptures still
[1:30:07] break the word of them no they feel is
[1:30:09] anointed
[1:30:09] no you could say bye-bye I'm gone no
[1:30:11] more crying crying is over I'm finished
[1:30:14] I'm going I'm going I'm going say it's
[1:30:16] bye-bye
[1:30:16] and they say bye-bye why didn't cry
[1:30:19] they had revelation oh why didn't cry
[1:30:21] that understanding know of what they
[1:30:23] were posed to receive he said teri in
[1:30:26] the city of Jerusalem until you receive
[1:30:28] power from on high
[1:30:30] they know this is a different one
[1:30:32] altogether now they noticed enough from
[1:30:34] the pasta or the preacher or the bishop
[1:30:35] or somebody else they fall for one high
[1:30:37] so they're easily upper room on the
[1:30:39] expectation worship and praising God
[1:30:40] continually because whenever you receive
[1:30:43] from God in Revelation you have to talk
[1:30:44] in faith
[1:30:50] that's why Abraham stagger nut but give
[1:30:52] glory to God his faith was praising God
[1:30:55] and was fully persuaded and he was
[1:30:58] praising and worshipping God continually
[1:30:59] for the promise say forgive your promise
[1:31:01] you thank God in advance
[1:31:03] you got grump and complain and keep
[1:31:05] silent no there's no silence because you
[1:31:07] receive it he said thanks from a healing
[1:31:10] thanks for my deliverance thank you Lord
[1:31:13] for my breakthrough if you claim it and
[1:31:16] receive it then you could give worship
[1:31:17] it then go to expect you to come with a
[1:31:20] sour face go to a trailer come like it
[1:31:22] and he has done nothing for your life
[1:31:23] you praise him anyhow
[1:31:25] you worship Melanie oh don't you spare
[1:31:27] me and I'll trust him
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:36] so there are certain scriptures that
[1:31:39] identify this word Dunamis the same one
[1:31:41] as power on the angel this Islam Luke
[1:31:43] 1:35 when the angel answered and said in
[1:31:45] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:31:47] and the power of the highest shall
[1:31:49] overshadow thee therefore also the holy
[1:31:51] thing which shall be of thee shall be
[1:31:52] called the Son of God Luke for 36 days
[1:31:55] you want to read in the scriptures they
[1:31:57] were all amazed and speak among
[1:31:58] themselves saying what a would is this
[1:32:00] for with authority and power he
[1:32:01] commanded the unclean spirits and they
[1:32:04] come out the fusions 3:20 know unto him
[1:32:08] that is able to do exceedingly
[1:32:10] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[1:32:12] think according to the power that
[1:32:15] worketh in us unto Him be glory in the
[1:32:18] church of jesus christ throughout all
[1:32:20] ages
[1:32:21] amen second Timothy 1:7 God had not
[1:32:25] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[1:32:27] and of love and of a song main second be
[1:32:32] the one tree according as his divine
[1:32:33] power had given unto us all things that
[1:32:36] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:32:38] the knowledge of him that call us to
[1:32:40] glory and virtue so virtue power has to
[1:32:44] be given to do the works of Christ this
[1:32:47] divine power that comes true proper
[1:32:50] knowledge has to come into the church
[1:32:52] isn't that right mark 5:30 and Jesus
[1:32:57] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:32:59] virtue had gone out of him telling him
[1:33:01] about in the presence a who touched my
[1:33:03] clothes that would want a blood issue so
[1:33:06] when she pull and she withdraw he felt
[1:33:08] that virtue left him that has to return
[1:33:11] power has to be dear to be released God
[1:33:16] have to give that power isn't that right
[1:33:18] Luke 619 and the whole multitude sought
[1:33:20] to touch him for they went virtue out of
[1:33:23] him and heal them all
[1:33:24] so this ministry of Jesus Christ is not
[1:33:27] talking talking talking explaining
[1:33:30] explaining experience that's not the
[1:33:32] message Jesus Christ the best Jesus
[1:33:33] Christ has to be thought you throwing
[1:33:35] freely power flowing freely
[1:33:41] Luke 846 and Jesus said somebody had
[1:33:44] touched me for I perceive virtue is gone
[1:33:46] out of me
[1:33:47] he had it therefore he could give it
[1:33:50] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:33:52] praise God inherent power is not right
[1:33:56] and this is what the adoption is all
[1:33:58] about sons come in safe position of
[1:34:00] power now listen to this other one
[1:34:03] Luke 619 and the crowd sought to touch
[1:34:06] him for power and out of him and He
[1:34:07] healed them all praise the name of the
[1:34:10] Lord blessed be the name of Jesus praise
[1:34:13] be to God
[1:34:14] so the adopted son will have virtue
[1:34:16] flowing out of him isn't that right
[1:34:19] praise be to Jesus should have to have a
[1:34:21] start first I begin to add and to grow
[1:34:23] that's why I keep saying I'm brother
[1:34:25] George nor seen for years the ministers
[1:34:27] the people are yet to really go into
[1:34:28] wilderness to be tested of the devil
[1:34:30] they go I take the Duff to lead you dear
[1:34:32] you cannot in yourself going the
[1:34:33] wilderness so therefore your trials and
[1:34:36] what you call in trials right now forget
[1:34:37] about it that is so small in this whole
[1:34:39] thing and you complain you're palling
[1:34:41] and you're balling you're balling and
[1:34:43] what you call him buddy what trials you
[1:34:44] ready going through you come in the
[1:34:46] church freely bumps that fallen wrong
[1:34:48] you but get together creep if I die in
[1:34:50] some utila what not all can you have
[1:34:52] them around the world
[1:34:52] you shall come in and your but they hear
[1:34:54] the word freely and what not
[1:34:56] what try they're going through it coming
[1:34:59] people don't see me more than that they
[1:35:03] do want to come you want power but you
[1:35:06] don't want apostolate conditions but you
[1:35:08] want a Pacific Power if you're qualified
[1:35:10] Pacific Power you have to expect
[1:35:12] apostolate conditions why I think they
[1:35:16] will room with the door shut the door
[1:35:19] was no pillow and I believe hallelujah
[1:35:21] dying the glory in glory
[1:35:24] it wasn't even an outside you know the
[1:35:25] door was shut because they were afraid

[1:36:10] can be a believer in other could
[1:36:12] something like that hysterical is bitter
[1:36:15] but bitterly why because in his human
[1:36:17] self he doesn't have the strength
[1:36:19] there's not the power it's the end it is
[1:36:22] not there yet but when that power hit
[1:36:24] him he was the first man to slam the
[1:36:27] door open
[1:36:28] he's people on a joint as you supposed
[1:36:30] but this is that that the Prophet Joel
[1:36:32] he was the first man to step oh that's
[1:36:34] in Peter
[1:36:35] Oh glory to God that's what we're
[1:36:37] talking about you really can utter words

[1:39:26] throne
[1:39:27] people have an opportunity to respond
[1:39:29] like I'd never understand people grow up
[1:39:31] in a message or nineteen twenty and not
[1:39:33] baptized in Jesus name I do understand
[1:39:35] that under previous message and what I
[1:39:38] do you understand that where is the
[1:39:39] conviction to obey what God said in the
[1:39:41] world to repent and get baptized in
[1:39:43] Jesus name this sins that even taken
[1:39:46] away yet I said as I go I have a
[1:39:48] cassette or DVD or something light of
[1:39:50] your life and all he has to do it
[1:39:52] doesn't accuse you no just take back a
[1:39:54] life and play it back and put it in a
[1:39:56] movie of a screen a screen and you see
[1:39:58] Mac your whole life when you repent and
[1:40:00] you get baptized he taken any raise the
[1:40:02] whole thing give you a fresh start
[1:40:06] then you're under covenant of God under
[1:40:09] promise to receive the Holy Ghost repent
[1:40:11] and be baptized and you shall receive
[1:40:13] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:14] that's your promise but people don't
[1:40:17] even answer the promise that's your
[1:40:18] promise that's what this offers we
[1:40:19] looking for next the Holy Ghost when
[1:40:22] they're coming Church and I come and
[1:40:23] look for this and I thought you coming
[1:40:24] for the Holy Ghost before wife or
[1:40:28] husband you should be asking about Holy
[1:40:29] Ghost
[1:40:37] he's a human women
[1:40:39] remember the payment message is the
[1:40:41] capstone the Holy Spirit cup of the
[1:40:43] individual and sealant when we added to
[1:40:45] fit righteousness and godliness and he
[1:40:47] kept add until we got seven things and
[1:40:48] the seventh one was love which is God
[1:40:50] that's how he makes the individual he
[1:40:52] caps him and sees him at the Holy Spirit
[1:40:54] then if that be so he's got seven
[1:40:56] churches and he had seven mysteries that
[1:40:58] we song away and they fought for to
[1:41:00] bring back now the headstone comes the
[1:41:02] cap of the church does the tunnelers
[1:41:03] mean that my bredrin
[1:41:05] and then he referred to junior Jackson
[1:41:08] dream with the pyramid and the crowbar
[1:41:11] and knocking off the chrome and so on
[1:41:12] and then he says no watch watch and
[1:41:15] watch he said this is all interpreted
[1:41:18] according to his dream is all finished
[1:41:19] according to God's Word the seventh
[1:41:21] messenger will finish the seventh
[1:41:25] message will be finished and then the
[1:41:28] seven thunders and he saw the capstone
[1:41:30] roll over so after the 70 inches message
[1:41:34] come seven thunders which many people
[1:41:36] don't even know they're seven seems to
[1:41:38] be reveal I've read many many books from
[1:41:40] Revelation never hear them talk about it
[1:41:42] he said no look he's the parent when I
[1:41:44] get to the capstone was not interpreted
[1:41:47] could it be that the mighty thunder or
[1:41:50] the seven angel in the seventh angel
[1:41:52] conservation that made a permanent a
[1:41:54] form tree on one side one on the top
[1:41:56] they drop out of eternity could it be
[1:41:58] here I want to get to is this the
[1:42:01] mystery of the tunnels that will bring
[1:42:04] back the headstone you know the prayer
[1:42:05] was never capped the headstone is yet to
[1:42:08] come
[1:42:08] it's been rejected could be brethren is
[1:42:11] this the mystery that would open up
[1:42:14] and bring a power to the church so he is
[1:42:22] saying a mystery is to open up to bring
[1:42:25] up power could it be what open up to
[1:42:27] bring a power to the church now listen
[1:42:29] this angel come from heaven all the
[1:42:32] messages finish the seven angel winds up
[1:42:35] the whole thing
[1:42:35] this angel comes not to the earth he
[1:42:38] isn't a man from the earth as the
[1:42:40] message of the church a Jesus finished
[1:42:41] this in shall bring the next
[1:42:43] announcement which is the mighty angel
[1:42:45] what was the announcement is the seven
[1:42:48] thunders twenty voices oh isn't that
[1:42:49] right this one didn't come from the
[1:42:51] earth he come from heaven because the
[1:42:53] mystery is all finished and when the
[1:42:55] mystery is finished angel said time
[1:42:56] shall be no more he said and then seven
[1:42:58] thunders to divorce result what if it is
[1:43:00] something that let us know how to end in
[1:43:02] disruption fate is it will be run on
[1:43:05] leap over walls
[1:43:05] is there something fixing to happen and
[1:43:08] these all mud vile bodies are going to
[1:43:10] be changed so friends if we're talking
[1:43:12] about the eruption that comes the Lord
[1:43:13] we have to look for that power that God
[1:43:16] promised they're going to transform our
[1:43:18] lies he's not right let's continue for
[1:43:22] marriage of the Lamb
[1:43:23] but a Branham so many say if the Lord
[1:43:24] will take his evil spirit from me from
[1:43:26] drinking from gambling from line and
[1:43:29] stealin our Sylvan that's up to you
[1:43:31] you've got something to do
[1:43:33] did I overcome challenge every all
[1:43:36] things did overcome you have power to do
[1:43:39] it but you must be willing to lay it
[1:43:42] down she had made herself ready isn't
[1:43:44] that right
[1:43:45] so therefore the Dove came down to lead
[1:43:47] Jesus is not right the anointing came
[1:43:49] upon him the Spirit came upon him but
[1:43:52] gone at the teen-oriented off of him to
[1:43:54] lead him into the wilderness to be
[1:43:55] tested to overcome by the word and his
[1:43:58] word was it is written it is written it
[1:44:00] is written we know it and he already had
[1:44:02] the power before he went in he went with
[1:44:05] power into the wilderness isn't that
[1:44:07] right he had power before he went in but
[1:44:10] he had to be tested isn't that right
[1:44:12] so Jesus when he returned from the
[1:44:15] wilderness he returned the power of the
[1:44:16] Spirit but he had to prove prove he
[1:44:20] could overcome by the world
[1:44:23] before he returned in the power of the
[1:44:26] Spirit he had to prove he can overcome
[1:44:29] by the wood it is written it is written
[1:44:33] it is written so don't look for spirit
[1:44:36] for you to overcome take the wood and
[1:44:38] overcome let me say it again
[1:44:46] don't look for spirit to overcome like
[1:44:49] you look at me the spirit and then you
[1:44:50] overcome no take the wood and die take
[1:44:52] the wood and confess the word take the
[1:44:55] wood and speak it take the word and say
[1:44:57] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:44:58] strengthens me
[1:44:59] praise God take the word amen the Lord
[1:45:02] is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:45:04] overcome your anxiety overcome your
[1:45:06] fears take what the word said rumours
[1:45:08] 8:28 all things work together for good
[1:45:10] to them that love God isn't that right
[1:45:13] take the word the Lord gives a lot take
[1:45:15] it away you lose your job take the word
[1:45:17] the Lord gives the Lord taketh away you
[1:45:19] lose this you lose that to give God
[1:45:20] praise and you know what is it you're
[1:45:23] overcoming by the word you're taking the
[1:45:25] word first and when you're welcome by
[1:45:26] the word become the spirit to prove that
[1:45:28] the word is spirit
[1:45:30] Oh glory hallelujah the word is said in
[1:45:34] spirit the devil don't want you to see
[1:45:36] that the word is assured that Anthony
[1:45:39] speak about I love what he brought out
[1:45:41] about the all the other weapons his
[1:45:43] defence the shield everything else but
[1:45:45] that sword is the only active one to
[1:45:47] attack and to cut the sword is the word
[1:45:50] and if the devil could make you feel
[1:45:51] that that is not powerful enough
[1:45:53] then he catch you right there but when
[1:45:55] you recognize the sword is the spirit
