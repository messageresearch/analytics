again once more in the house alone amen and Ezra we want to look at the book of Ezra chapter one um and the first three verses there praise God and then I'll let you have your seats Ezra chapter one and verse 1. it says now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stood up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing so if you miss the proclamation it was also in writing saying thus say it King Osiris King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven had given me all the kingdoms of the Earth and he have charged me to build him and house at Jerusalem which is in Judah who who is there among you of all these people his God be with him and let him go up to

you all the praise on and glory Lord As you move with us Lord father granted almighty God we pray and ask in Jesus name amen you may have your seats praise God amen amen praise the name of the Lord so we're happy to be in the house alone and we feel his show feel his presence amen amen well I have a title this morning my title is when God stirs that's my title this morning when God stirs God does the steering it's not man that stirs but when God stirs there's a difference when he steers when man tried to make things happen they make mistakes they trip over themselves they cause confusion because we are in a fallen condition and even though our intentions are good when we try to do it in our own strength it always comes out a certain way it comes out biased it comes out maybe one-sided because we can't see all of the picture and no one of us is just that good but God is good all by himself and when he begins to do the stirring it comes out perfect in the end because it's his work isn't that right every work is a reflection of the Craftsman behind it every work that is produced is a reflection of the Craftsman that is behind that work so if you do something you will do it according to your standards if I do something I will do it according to my standards or my level of perfection but when God does something he does it to his level of Perfections and we know that there's nothing more perfect than God is this morning so if you are in his hands you can't help but come out perfect David said that the Lord will perfect that which concerned me and if you are in God's hands this morning then you in the right hands then God can't help but pour into you his talent his efforts his ability all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ is going to be poured into the church in the last days there's going to be a Ministry of perfection that caught himself will produce in the last days or can we say Amen this morning oh oh hallelujah hallelujah oh do you trust your leader this morning Your Leader is not a man that he would lie but your leader is the Holy Ghost Your Leader is Jesus a five-star general the captain of our Salvation he knows no retreat he knows no surrender for whatever could never he never lost a battle oh he's got straps this morning he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of his peace is upon us and by his stripes we are here oh can we say Amen this morning Hallelujah oh man amen so so let's get into this text here so this Ezra verse 1 here is a uh is actually happening according to prophecy it's not right this prophecy was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the children of Israel being down there for a space of 70 years is that right let's read Jeremiah 25. let's see what the Lord says here Jeremiah 25 11-12 here and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years and it shall come to pass prophecy now that when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity and the land of the Chaldeans and will make it a perpetual desolations Jeremiah 29 is read here again he says for thus say the Lord will stand that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for he said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you say the Lord thoughts of Peace are not of evil to bring you to give you an expected end oh Hallelujah God knows the thoughts this morning that he thinks towards you oh he wants to pull you into himself he wants to gather you back together though you'll be lost and Scattered oh Holly but you will always remain in that condition God's thoughts towards you this morning are thoughts of restoration are thoughts that give you strength in your weakness to give you power Hallelujah in your insufficiencies to give you healing from all your diseases oh God is here this morning and his thoughts towards you are perfect oh he is going to perfect that which concerns you this morning don't you be worried don't you be afraid God is in control of your life he is Lord over everything to some people he's just a Healer to some people he's just a deliverer but many but few people can truly call him Lord but I pray this morning that after the end of this service you'll be able to call him Lord over your life Lord over your household Lord over your wife over your husband over your Affairs over your assets over your everything oh may he be Lord this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen amen is not right glory to God oh Hallelujah and now so there's a pattern with when God stirs okay now watch this real quick now so that prophecy might be fulfilled God began to stir up the heart of King Cyrus to bring his will to pass right and God will move things around as soon as he is ready to bring his word to pass his promised word in your life anytime God is ready to to do something Supernatural something that you cannot do within yourself and he has set up the situation the circumstance in such a way that it would take God to deliver it won't take your money your money can't help you your position won't be able to help you your job can help you only one thing can help that's God Almighty have to come down in that situation oh you know what situation I'm talking about this morning oh each one of us is walking a road this morning and you know that it's caught for you it's the same God for me it's the same God for each one of us that will deliver us in our time and season and I know a god that is a deliverer he was a deliverer to Daniel he was a deliverer to Moses and he'll be a deliverer for you this morning don't you be afraid or have confidence not in yourself but in this court of Deliverance this court of healing this God who with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm had promised to deliver you from out of your bondage out of your Affliction the devil's days are numbered this morning oh there is a God in Israel and I know my thoughts that I think concerning you he has thoughts to perfect you he has taught to redeem you he has thoughts to restore you he has taught to baptize you to fill you with the Holy Ghost to give you power like you've never known before you've gonna run the squatters offer your land and this morning God's gonna give you power power in your perch power in your unexperience power in your hearts power in your soul power in your life or you'll have power upon you just like the apostles had power upon them oh they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover there's coming a time where God is gonna stir up our people upon the Earth 2023 God is stirring this morning getting you ready getting you ready to release power oh Hallelujah Oh Glory to God Amen whoa do you believe it Hallelujah [Applause] so Cyrus is actually positionally placed to do this this work I want to read from Isaiah 44 real quick you don't have to find it but if you want to Isaiah 44 and 24 Justice first here um okay no wait let me skip down to okay I'll read it from 24. thus say the Lord thy Redeemer and that he that formed thee from the womb right this is good I couldn't I couldn't skip this I am the Lord that maketh of all things oh hello he's the Lord this morning amen I'm not stretch it forth the heavens alone that spread it abroad the Earth by myself oh he don't need no help he does it by himself amen amen it is he that called you this morning he called you all by himself he made up his mind he said I'm gonna call that brother I'm gonna call that sister I'm gonna give them what it takes to stand in 2023 stand against The Wiles of the devil against the enemy against principalities against the forces of Darkness against the rulers of this world against wickedness in high places God's gonna give you power in your butt to understand have internal to stand stand there for oh oh Hallelujah Glory he made you that way Amen to to meet the challenge of the hour amen that's right verse 25 that frustrated the tokens of the Liars wow and make it different as mad and turn that wise man backward and make it their knowledge foolish foolishness of God right confirmed the word uh of his servant and performeth the Council of his Messengers that say it to Jerusalem Thou shalt be in heaven inhabited and to the cities of Judah ye shall be built and I will raise up the decayed places thereof thus say it to the Deep this is down connecting to that prophecy now said that to the Deep be dry and I will dry up the rivers verse 28 here's what he says that saith of Cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem thou shall be built and to the temple thy Foundation shall be laid thus say the Lord to his anointed this chapter 45 coming into anointed is Anointed to Cyrus God's anointed whose right hand have I hold on to subdue Nations before him and I will lose the loins of the Kings to open before him the two leave Gates and the gate shall not be shut in other words God already is a proclaiming Cyrus to do this work long before and this scripture is brought before Cyrus even come on yet and God actually calls Cyrus by name in other words there's gonna be a Cyrus that will raise up that I will have thou use he will be my servant and I'm gonna use him to proclaim a prophecy to connect to prophecy to bring my word to pass brother God will raise up Kings for your sake to bring his word to pass because of who you are because you are predestinated because you are fordained of God because he knows the thoughts that he thinks towards you God will ordain Kings to bring his word to pass God will move whatever wherever if it's a big Stone he have to move he is moving it this morning if it's a situation he will move it this morning if we have to give you a job if you have to take away your job if you have to give your house if you have to take away a house if you have to give you a car if you have to take away your car door he slay me yet will I trust him the Lord give and the Lord shake away blessed be the name of the Lord oh that's got to be your attitude this morning doesn't matter what happens God is still in control though the world look like it's falling but that is the hand of God in your life to the world it is confusing to your mind it is confusing but God in you is doing a work of perfection in your heart in your life I need somebody this morning to believe God with me that he is able to restore he is able to protect he is able to instruct in wisdom and guidance he will cast you through the Mighty Claire for his name's sake yeah before I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid thus have they comfort me oh somebody Shout somebody give God praise Hallelujah oh [Music] Glory his hand is upon you this morning don't you fear don't you be afraid it is Jesus his hand is upon your life it's always been upon your life oh you thought it was negative you thought it was a storm but that was coming for your Perfection it was coming to teach you how to trust in Jesus every dark moment every trial every test every painful scar every memory everything was to the Perfection of God it was for your good oh Hallelujah Hallelujah you can only appreciate the hand of God in times of trouble in times of distress David's head in times of distress I cried out to the Lord I poured him out my complaint before him and he heard me and delivered me out of all my troubles this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and if God could hear him this morning surely the court can hear me surely there is a bomb in Killian surely there is a physician there surely there is healing for your sickness this morning raise up in feet this morning and believe the god of Israel will deliver will restore he has caught this morning all by himself he made his word and he'll keep his word oh Hallelujah Murray oh my oh my God do you be rejected do you be despised that was still God's hand upon your life oh told people didn't understand you you were a mystery in your school mystery on your job a mystery amongst your family but you was called mystery that's why they couldn't figure it out God hides his wisdom from the wise and the prudence and revealed little babes such as would learn God knew you'd have the heart of a child to look unto Jesus and forget about your God manly knowledge and forget about education and wisdom and say Lord you who make it the Stars you who call it them by name he knows your name this morning and he will raise you up for such a time as this think it's not strange you are here taken not strange you are in a situation that you are in it is for the glory of God God don't do nothing by accident and you are not an accident this morning God loves you he wants to fill you he wants to anoint you he wants to give you power he wants to clothe you in righteousness he wants to bathe you down with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire he wants to overshadow you foreign you up this morning stirring you up so there's a pattern to this stirring off the time God and a lot of times things get in a falling condition in the Bible you see it repeatedly things come into our planet backslidden condition and it moves into such a state that God begins to stir God says enough is enough time up on confusion time up on Darkness time up on on ignorance time up on the work of the enemy God begins to stir God begins to stir things up so that he could bring it back to the plum line bring it back to the word bring it back to Holiness bring it back to Purity bring it back to his Divine Law oh isn't that right hey bring him back I do the work of restoration to bring it back and when he begins this book of restoration it usually starts with a stirring isn't that right Ezra 1 and verse five we didn't read this but I'll read it then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all them whose Spirit God had raised up to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem so God started to stood the car to the King's house and he also started to still the hearts of the people who was going to go back and rebuild this Temple in Jerusalem isn't that right and as I was studying this word uh of course I was thinking about my son because it's the book of Ezra but the inspiration for his name I was thinking about how God was going to rebuild not this physical Temple we're talking about but just like the prophet said rebuild the church in the power of the spirit there's going to come a generation that is going to witness this rebuilding of the power of the spirit that's going to witness this rebuilding of a church a church without spots a church in our wrinkled washed in the blood of a lamb a church with Jesus walking in it a church of perfection a church oh hallelujah hallelujah glorious walking and Marching In step that's the kind of church Jesus is coming for [Applause] in the last days and I don't think God raised us up here by chance but I believe every one of us only is called to make a church that will make a Revival oh hallelujah hallelujah people are complaining saying the seven Thunders that's not even written is being mean manifests you've got to believe I'm not talking about you the group but you the individuals who God has raised up for such a time as this something in your heart this morning is stirring oh Hallelujah something in your soul knows that your time and your season is coming season of adoption season of blessings season of your filling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost God promised it and he will bring it to pass this morning don't you be afraid somebody say Amen he's Gonna Fill you he's gonna deliver you he's gonna deliver your family you will see the mighty hand of God it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when you better be ready when he comes oh he's a behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work oh make sure you're working this morning oh we come this morning to work Hallelujah do you believe it amen thank you praise God amen so Horizon bill right that's all calling so now I just felt in my spirit so I studied through the scripture since well about three years ago again um and then that's what came to me so this is what the Lord has here in store um for a long time to stir what does it mean it means a state of distillment a state of of agitation or it's also called a Brisk activity these were taken out of Merriam-Webster Iman a state of disturbance that's what a steering means it's doing it's a verb it's an activity it means that something was laying motionless for a long time then all of a sudden something begins to move something begins to serve like the moving and the Buller and the mulberry tree when David saw that motion he knew that something was fixing to happen somebody was fixing to take place that's not a man that's called interrupting the program interrupting your idea God is a spirit he's not a natural man and he is outside of our environment therefore if God wants to intervene on your situation this morning his hand comes into our three-dimensional world and he begins to stir things up he begins to move this move that push this person move that brother move his sister stir up by the so-and-so stir up sister so and so he speak a word to his Prophet here and speak a word to his anointed dare learn the candle on both ends and they meet on the half to let you know that God was working all the time while he's working on me he's also working on you but when this Temple is getting ready to come together Stone gonna come to stone stone gonna come to Stone it was God's work all the time here a little they're a little precept upon precept line upon line this trial this test this persecution God knows all about it he who formed the Earth out of dry land this morning is able to form you into the word image oh blessed are you that we could be conformed to the image of his son you are predestinated or according to the good pleasure of his will hallelujah oh how great is a measure of Our Father's Love We foreign [Applause] he had already glorified what shall we then say to these things if caught before us who can be against us brother when you are standing on the word of God there's not enough terrible that can stop you from possessing your inheritance that belongs to you the Holy Ghost belongs to you healing belongs to you this morning rise up and grab it reach up and claim it this morning oh killer Shout get a lot of scream let him know you mean business this morning Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my God oh my God glory oh do you believe in this morning all right so we're here to be stood [Music] because that's the only way we could get out of our our comfort Zoom state of Lux and gonna get out of that get into the spirit of the coming of the Lord you have to get into atmosphere of worship you have to come up them stairs and know that the Lord he is God it is he that had made us and not we ourselves we are not making ourselves this morning this is not a Frankenstein shop this is not a mad scientist laboratory we're not trying to make people pray come on now get out of your head he's the one that is making who can add one cubit to his stature it is God that is building this statue of a perfect man and when this tattoo is completed this will be the servant of God oh that goes into the Rapture God is doing the building therefore God is doing the choosing he choose your trial he choose your tests he choose your persecution he choose everything you went through he allowed this to happen he allowed that to happen for his glory so that he could get the glory out of your life story I'm so happy that millions of lost when I was saved he saved you plucked you out of the enemy's hand and he's gonna perfect you oh do you believe it this morning glory to God amen still is a verb it's a commotion trouble somebody out of the ordinary something unexpected that God does when he's getting ready to do his thing because his thing is unexpected if it was expected we would act differently What If Abraham knew that his son was going to come for 25 years later he would have done what he wanted things it would go come in 25 years then he set our reminder in a spoon and about a week before you wake up reminder hey welcome in 25 years okay good right and then he'll start to get his act together that's us I mean let's let's be real now we we know ourselves but God doesn't allow it to be like that he he purposefully withholds information from you so that he could keep you in a always in a state of readiness all is in a state of dependency imagine an expectation looking to see God fulfill what he said because all we have is what he said we don't have our own ideas we don't have our own opinions and God's word is of no private interpretation so we're not going to sit around a corner and say I think I know what God Said praise God you'll end up off the roadside on site somewhere that's right isn't that right off to one extreme praise God you end up crazy fanatical maybe or you end up in the world somewhere but you gotta stay down the middle of the road and be realistic oh hallelujah hallelujah plan for the next 25 years but live like he's coming tomorrow oh Hallelujah and stay on the firing line oh look in to see if he don't come today he'll come tomorrow and if you don't come tomorrow he'll come the next day but while I'm here I'm building I'm building a show quick message shake the whole nation it's coming soon but while we're here we're just playing a foundation so that he can come upon it oh Hallelujah [Music] pound the foundation of your faith amen he'll do a great work he's not right oh man so this is it now see this is what it means it means a trouble to perturb the cause of disturbance when we think about Genesis in the beginning when God stood or when he brewed it over the Earth over the waters didn't I Genesis 1 2 said the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God begin to move upon the face of the waters that's what the Bible says I wasn't there but I take what the word says the face of God began to move upon the troubled waters we couldn't see the waters but God knows where the waters are this morning God knows where your trouble is this morning God knows where your mistake is your heartache is this morning he knows your situation he knows your condition and God I pray that God caused his face to shine upon you this morning in spite of your condition in spite of your situation I know a God who is able to move upon the face of the waters oh oh Hallelujah might seem like confusion but don't you worry as long as God is on the throne he's going to work all things together for your good according to them that love God unto them who are called according to his purpose you have a purpose in God don't you ever let the devil get that out of your mind oh come hell or high water we're gonna trust him trust in his leadership trust in his hand trust in his ability to take us all away to Perfection this morning oh do you believe it oh Hallelujah he began to Stir It Up why because he's getting ready to bring the past his word the speaker's word isn't that right on the seat shall not be here with the shock 1965. with a paragraph 79 said he was God the logos the word that went out from God and when it began to brood upon the Earth and it brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the word which God said let there be and there when the logos which is the word logos and the word isn't that right and the word began to because all this was in the logos all that that we see materialize Upon Us was in the logos waiting to be expressed but I spoke of word isn't that right it's not right the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age and the logos began to breathe upon the Earth and the prophet said there come marine life and building up he said the bird life and on up he said the animal life out of the logos come all these things all the things that we see around us was made by something that does not appear oh Hallelujah it is not right he said a prophet said and finally there comes something in the representation or that look like

time oh he made a reflection of himself oh it's not right a man in Dominion now watch paragraph it he said and that man fell like the seed has to fall so he brings it in now it's predestinated there's like the seat had to fall and then gone began to brood over that after he had fallen the prophet said he brought up Enoch he brought up Elijah he brought up Moses he brought up Prophet after Prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was God the logos made flesh that dwelled Among Us now finally there came for Jesus

Praises of God to go up oh Hallelujah sacrifice of praise we fight to Tennille to keep that atmosphere because in the right atmosphere anything can happen oh Hallelujah glory to God the devil's job is

them in a brooder house or whatever and how the heat is regulated and the heat has kept over that egg until it's hatched and God has so set in order that one day through all the types back through Adam through Eve all down to the prophets down through Adam he has set in order put it all in the Old Testament showing what he was going to do and then he finished it a Calvary when he sent Jesus he who was wounded for transgressions proves for all iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were here and he was finished with it at Calvary then he anointed preachers and set it out now to bring the word and to put the eggs in the right positional place and then he takes the same word and anchors it out there and then it comes and hovers over it by the Holy Ghost he said until that word comes to life in the human heart the prophet said all the Devils of Hell couldn't keep life out of it oh what is the secret the word is already in the bride and now

hallelujah amen amen oh man God stood when it was time to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt he calls it disturbance upon the mountain God came down in the form of a burden Bush and began to cause a stirring unexpected thing an attraction something that looked weird and Moses turned aside to look at this site why the bush is not burnt but what Moses didn't know was that the fire didn't come for the bush the fire come from Moses the fire didn't come for the Earth we come from Moses he come to give him an experience he come to speak to his heart and the fire this morning didn't come for the pews it didn't come for the carpets it didn't come for the camera it came for you this morning it came to feel you with the Holy Ghost it came to burn inside your soul it came to burn inside your heart against the burden inside our life Burn Out the Devil and put God in your soul but Zoey eternal life into your fall receiving the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah

oh I don't even know if we get through all of this oh my God hallelujah Hallelujah huh [Music] Prophet said Moses was a bit of failure it was a bit of failure but out there now we see his attention attracted to the boonin bush or when you look to the bush to find what the trouble was he walked close to it the prophet said fire usually brings an attraction oh and usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in a fire is to attract the attention of the people or may he come in a fire this morning and attract your attention turn your eyes off for the internet turn your eyes off of all distractions amen open the worldly things Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and see what he's trying to call you to he said on God when Moses turned aside to consider this Burning Tree God spoke to him by a fresh Vision amen and now watch Faith take a whole quick he said the old things are passed away and now Moses has a new vision he has a revelation and he has an experience Prophet said he had met God he finally met God and he talked to God before that he had not met God he had only read and knowed about what his mother had told him and so forth by hearing what his mother had said or hearing what his Pastor said and so forth but now Moses has a personal experience oh you see how much this means now you see how much we need it amen amen young people amen all of us amen our personal experience he said that's what the church needs tonight is to stop studying so much Theology and get down to the Altar and pray until our personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the dullness and give you a new vision oh no wonder the Bible said without a vision the people perish but Isaiah said lo I beheld the Lord high and lifted up his train filled the temple and the post from the pillars move by the voice of him not crying oh holy holy unto the Lord called Almighty oh The Vision Chicago he was never the same again and you need a fresh Vision this morning from the supernatural to shake you out of the natural to stir you up to get you ready for what God is fixing to pour out upon his people in these last days oh may he prepare your hearts my brother prepare your hearts my sister by the word and by a spirit for what he's fixing to do oh Lord whatever you are doing in this season don't do it without me don't do it without me this morning I heard a songwriter sing that oh what an inspiration I want to be caught up in the move of God for this time amen God began to stir when he called Samuel A young Prophet Eli was blinded couldn't see his eyes waxed him and just about that time when the fire and the temple had gone out it seemed like everything was at its lowest point no fire enough Church no fire upon the people no burden everybody lost anything just then the spirit of God began to speak so Samia just at that time when nothing seemed to move oh Hallelujah don't take it lightly the first sign of the supernatural you see you run for the hills man or it could be a cloud as small as a man's hand but don't despise that they have small things the day you hear his voice Harden not your heart this morning oh that answer the call Hallelujah Samuel Young Samuel didn't even know the voice of the Lord it sounded like the voice of a man and with the wrong teachers and men and Priests and holy men and so-called men of the cloth men who were supposed to supposed to be living an example but it was caught in all kinds of folly Hallelujah and though Samuel is in this environment God wants to call into something higher out of all of that oh Hallelujah God had a son down there God always have somebody there he could put his hand on God always have a witness that he could express his power too oh the prophet of God might be God but I believe this morning there is a generation on the earth that God will have his hands upon that he could say Lou here is my spirit go here go there praise God Amen speak my word oh thank you not strange you came all the way that you come that you come to trial come to test somehow or another God kept you all these years that is not by chance God does not make accidents he made you he formed you from in the beginning he separated you from your mother's womb he wants to put his spirit inside of you he put something in your heart for you to receive this word he put a receiver in your heart to pick up God's Wi-Fi to pick up God's real signal and when God began to speak his message it went across the Earth and Found You The Prophet never came to Trinidad but the word of God found a way to come to you [Music] found everyone oh and now he's gonna bring those seats to life oh man who am I let me hurry up well time's going it's good though amen this is um really try to I might have to skip some of this I want to see but praise God my God begin to Stew he's too all the time kept stirring coming all the way all the way isn't that right when it's time to select a new king over Israel God stood called Samuel aside and say take this horn over here and go down to the house of Jesse and anoint a king or by Israel he didn't tell him who it was he just told him go down there and obey my word I tell me all the scared said oh God if so I'll hear about this he'll kill me oh he'll have my head he said don't worry I'll teach you how to do it oh if we could only be taught this morning how to do the will of God we'll make less mistakes we'll mess up less times if we just trust and Obey him and God showed Samuel how to go down and offer sacrifice and when he passed on oil no witness no witness no witness you say without is that all the sons and Jesse said well I've got one more son but he's out in the fields he's turning to the sheep and his name is David Samuel said we are not sitting down tonight until Samuel makes an uh tell David makes an appearance and here come David didn't look like much already scrawny little boy but this was called chosen this was God's anointed when he showed up sometimes you gotta show up I don't care how you look I don't care how you feel I don't care how funny you feel once you show up God will show up too and do his thing upon you oh hallelujah oh you gotta show up get down on your knees doesn't matter how you feel pray try it one time see if God don't answer mean business with God praise God in the midst of your circumstance worship God and have the right attitude in the midst of your trial and see if God don't do something God always hears a desperate cry oh Hallelujah he's here to answer your cry this morning don't you worry and he'll do it as soon as he knows you fully trust him amen you've got to trust him got to be willing to wait upon God it doesn't make sense me coming to somebody who know I'm not going to wait on me I know you're not gonna wait ain't nobody took on jump in my car and drive anyway because I know you're unreliable right but if I know this person is true to their word and says yes ah we'll be here then I will make every effort to Beat It because I know they're waiting on me and God wants to feel that from you that commitment that you're going to wait on him that right attitude that says Lord if you're if you don't meet me you'll find my bones here at this altar but I'm willing to wait until you feel me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not going back the same then God is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised word oh because he knows that you're waiting on him amen God always keeps us promises if you keep your promise if you keep his you keep inside of the contract amen amen and do what he promised to do isn't that right oh my Hallelujah okay look at Divine judgment again in the Days of Elijah the prophet said shown that Divine judgment it come to a time when there was nothing and the people I got away from God and they said Elijah went up on the mountain and he prayed and come before the king and he said not even two will fall from Heaven till I call for and for three years and six months you didn't even come on the earth the prophet said and when it come to the place that Elijah said let us prove who is God the fiery God he said all God is a consuming fire let the God had answered by fire he said and that's what I say tonight let the god that answers my fire let that God be God tonight oh oh let him answer by fire and consume the sacrifice let him answer my fire and let you know who he is in your life when fire answers you that's all the answers you need the world don't need to convince you you don't need to read nothing you don't need to see nothing else when God answers you by fire that's what you need this morning that's what I'm looking for this morning I'll answer my fire baptism fire upon the world fire in your sword find your chin the church hallelujah oh can somebody say Amen Glory oh let's ride it home amen God begin to serve when John the Baptist came forward preaching and they asked John to identify himself he said that he this they are sweat then I thought Elias I thought one of the prophets he said no he said they said unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make strange the way of the Lord and said the prophet desires and David will send one of the Pharisees the Bible said and they asked them they said why Baptist doubt baptize us now then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias or neither that prophet and John answered them saying I baptize with water but their stand at once among you whom you know not here it is Who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose he is gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire John was only stirring John was only getting the people ready making the path straight prepare the way of the Lord and that's what we're doing with the word this morning prepare nowhere for the coming of the Lord he is coming this morning his shoes we aren't worthy to unlatch but he's coming to fill you he's coming to Celia he's coming to a doctor he's coming to bring his word to you this morning and make it manifest he alone can do it this morning oh oh he's gonna do it he's got to do it because he is called and he cannot change my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I sent forth for it to accomplish his word in you my brother my sister shall come to pass [Music] oh man stirring God stood when he sent that angel down at the pool of Bethesda Saint John 5 says after there was a feast of the Jews Jesus went up he said no there is by the Sheep Market a pool which is in Hebrew called in Hebrew Bethesda having five porches and the Bible said in these lay a great multitude of important folk of blind of Halls of withered waiting for the movement of the water oh what were they waiting on the moving of the water for an angel the Bible said went down at a certain season and went into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had oh but that angel come down at a certain season in other words God knows the season when he is to come down it is not for us to know the times or the season that the father had put in his own power but what we do know know is that you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost come upon you oh but that angel comes down at a certain season what has he come to do trouble the waters it's the same water it's not a new water it's the same water but the difference is the Angel it's not the water but it's the angel that is in the water that's what makes a difference and the difference is not this building it's not this group but when God comes down when that angel comes down the prophet said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord then all of a sudden he says he is here I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God not a devil move until I say so the authority of God drop them upon the Earth the weight of his glory an arrest every demon on the field oh every devil is arrested this morning that angel is here this morning there is one standing among you this morning who's here to fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he's standing right among you oh cry out to him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] who am I God calls are stirring when he had died and rose again it was a stirring Hallelujah the centurions are scared the stone was rolled away when the Two Sisters come with the spices to treat with the body they came and found no one there they found an empty tomb oh I'll let it turned around didn't see nobody because Jesus was raised from the dead or he apparented his disciples he appeared to the winds on the road to Emmaus saying all fools and slow apart don't you know that the scriptures had testified of Christ to come and to do all these things that you are talking about why are you doubting why are you in Fair don't you know that Jesus Christ has rose from the dead and he's walking Among Us and he's living among us among human beings perfecting this one blessing this one anointing this one protecting this one from debt from accident from Peril the hand of the Lord is with you on your job I don't care what you don't see doesn't matter what you feel God is upon you tonight he's always been upon you oh he'll never leave you never forsake you he'll always be with you he's stirring you up this morning by his word and by his spirit oh my God he appeared unto them breathe upon them receive the Holy Ghost hope be not afraid it is high Jesus isn't that right oh and Jesus said told him tarry in Jerusalem until he be into the powerful and high isn't that right and God calls us stirring days later there they were waiting in the upper room tiring praying in his name waiting on the Lord Jesus waiting on that Holy Ghost I promise and Acts chapter 2 says and when the day of Pentecost was fully calm they were all at one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothed and tongues like us of a fire and hear what the Bible says it sat upon each of them oh it didn't only set up on Peter it didn't only set up on Andrew he didn't only set upon Philip but everyone all 120 who were sitting in that Upper Room got their clove and tongue of fire from the pulpits to the back bench downstairs everywhere clove and tongues of fire it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost it's not just for the preacher it's for you this morning it's not just for the Apostle it's for you that's not just for whoever and wherever all who are thirsty all can be filled this morning oh man I began to speak without tongues as the spirit gave them utterance he and they were dwelling at Jerusalem devout man and when there's noise abroad noise abroad s touring begin to take place the multitude came together and they were confounded because that every man heard them speak in this own his own language oh my is that getting ready to happen again oh God coming for another Revival Saints oh Hallelujah things are gonna happen things are gonna take place every gift gonna find their place in the house of God hallelujah God will restore the gifts to the church amen how here we every man in our tongue wherein we're born parthians meet us and medes and elamites dwellers of Mesopotamia Judea Cappadocia pontus Asia they all heard God speaking in their own language the spirit of God expressing itself speaking to each one that was there and abroad oh Hallelujah in different tongues it's not right the Bible said they were all amazed and some were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this oh I believe God's gonna send such a Revival in Trinidad where people are browned are gonna ask what mean at this what mean at this since Sangre Grande what meaning this are people down there I've got a revelation there are people on there are seen a manifestation of God oh hallelujah what means oh may God pour out such a Revival amen Prophet said the resurrection of Lazarus keep your Motors home and I'm getting ready to close that's what the matters of the church today he said we need a Revival we don't need a new Seminary we don't need new preachers we don't need new church buildings we need a Revival in what we got that's what it is he said are stirring up amen all right he says I'm not amen myself he says amen means so be it that's why we say Amen this morning amen means so be it to you he said and I believe it with all my heart can you say Amen with the Prophet this morning he said that's what the world needs today is an old-fashioned god-sense sky blue sin killing religion all Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible of Holy Ghost back into the church again that might be pretty strong for a Baptist but that's right he said I am a Pentecostal Baptist he said I got the Holy Ghost since I've been a Baptist he said that's right notice he said it cleans up sets aside makes you a different person a new creature in Christ Jesus all right that's what we need isn't that right and when the holy church died out I was persecuted God Amen go look to the Dark Ages him is not right they all died out and God had to raise up another church again in the last days so he had to begin a work so what did God do he began to stir upon a priest called Martin Luther isn't that right and he taught page on the Bible and walked down there praise God with a nail and a Hammer's hand and pounded a scripture upon the door the just shall live by faith let all men know what the word of God is for this day isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah God's getting ready to stir again oh when God stirs isn't that our title today where God is getting ready to stir one more time in this last generation hold all the filth in it with all the sex demons in it with all the evil with all the hatred with all the lusts righteousness God of this evil age here God is getting ready to stir one more time Upon A people in the last days who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age [Applause] Hallelujah he said now what that's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have he said we have denominational revivals but we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh my they've got millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet he said we're looking for it now it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he said he will send it he promised it now watch the first year and then there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all he said that's right I believe that Trudeau's seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for Rapture and page because what we got right now we won't be able to do it but there is something this morning we've got to step further the prophet said oh we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith this morning to be changed oh Hallelujah in the moment in the twinkling of an eye to be swept out of this Earth and we find that after a while we're gonna find where it is written you're gonna find your word for your season your word for your day seven Thunder this promise to wake that Pride up again he will send it he will promise it oh God send Revival Revival of the just repower to transform you from what you was into what you're supposed to be in Christ form you to the world image Hallelujah praying not by might not by power but by my spirit say the Lord who is this mountain before the ruler bear thou shall become a plane God's Gonna flatten the work of the enemy and God will raise up in you a Capstone of love oh Hallelujah oh my God oh my I'm getting ready to close you can stand you can sit praise God we're gonna go out with a shout isn't that right on the fourth seal Prophet said now we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word God's word sharp two-edged sword it slays him puts him right down wait till the seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word and hand it there it'll slice and it will cut they can close the heavens they can shut this they could do that whatever they want to Glory the prophet said he'll be slayed by the word oh that's coming a bride upon the urge she will have the word of God for her dare she will have the intelligence what to do with that word she will do it in his name she will have to say the Lord or she will keep still but when she speaks it will flash like lightning God's Gonna back up whatever you speak because of spoken word power will be in your mouth will be in your lips to slay the enemy slay him go in Slam coming with the two-edged sword of the spirit of God which is the word of God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh according to Ephesians 6 amen oh my the prophet said whatever they say is going to happen because it is the word of God coming forth from the mouth of God he said yeah amen God always it's his word but he always uses man to work it oh no wonder God chose you no wonder God predestinated you my brother my sister he needs man in order to work his word he says I am Divine you are the branch the banker or the branch can do nothing in itself but when it's connected to the True Vine it's gonna bring forth fruit peace and love and joy and meekness and forgiveness and low long-suffering oh all the fruits of the spirit hallelujah oh man God could have called for them flies down there in Egypt but he told Moses he said that's your job I'll tell you what to do and you go and do it he fully done that see he could have chosen the son to call them he couldn't you cause the moon to call it or the wind to call it but he said Moses he called Moses just like he called you for this hour to speak his word God's gonna have sons and daughters stepping out of the pages of the Bible to speak his word oh that's you my Christian friend that is you my brother that is you my sister God's getting ready to empower you with his holy ghost I promise to speak his word through you and make you a witness in this last day Hallelujah Oh my he said Moses that's what he chooses man all right another Prophet said a minute cannot bring a Revival there's no preacher can bring a Revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing you do is just be loyal to God and his word and the Revival has got to come by the people in your home in your life he said in our Revival isn't adding new members to the church but it's Reviving stirring up what we've already got oh you can get ready to piss himself I'm gonna really close out here revive means to bring back isn't that right Prophet radical here afterwards that I stood here uh oh yeah I'll read the quote here afterwards he said I stood here some years ago for my first time a large body of water which was Lake Michigan uh and I was about just about ordin the Missionary Baptist Church he said and he said he went out to Issa Issa Sunrise Sun service out on the lake amen and he said uh he was a he said he drove out there for a while and he noticed big waves right so he drove out to the to this to the Sea and he said it was his first time seeing a large body of water oh there amen it's not right he went out on Lake Shore Drive stood out there a little while he said and I noticed all them waves jumping up and down just splashing around and I thought what is it so excited about what is all the excitement and the little waves he said would start and it would run out and get come big Great Waves then bounce into each other and break apart and the form would fly up and it'll come back in and then he said I see the big waves coming again breaking on the bank he said like you're used to here he said but that was something new for me he said a landlocked servant so I noticed how to do that he said and then I said he said well what must it be he said the lake is having a Revival he said that's what it must be it does what it is he said it's having a big time just jumping up and down I thought he said well that's good that's fine he said but you know I thought well I wonder if it's got a lot of extra water when it's having a Revival he thought and he said no he said there isn't one drop more in it right now than if it was perfectly calm not one bit he said it's the same water he said but it's just having a Revival is that what we need this morning oh Hallelujah jumping up and down I thought well what what good does that do the prophet said come to find out when it's having a Revival and jumping up and down like that it washes all the trash up out of it on the shore and he said that's what the church needs oh that's what the church needs this morning is a Revival oh get all of the world and all the things of the world you can understand wash out so it could look clear it could look pretty again and when it all calms down it's got the same amount of water but what causes the sea to do that is because the wind comes and blows against that waves blows against the body of water pick it up he said that's what the church needs tonight it's a rushing Mighty Wind coming down upon it again and Reviving it getting all of the world out getting all of the things of the world out and then when it starts it's not a Revival and then when it settles down the church is all his condition then to start off to receive spiritual gifts and blessings from God that's what we want isn't our eyes oh hallelujah hallelujah Prophet said the church is predestinated to adoption when man God could take a man and adopt him into the family give him something then push try it see if it's right the Bible said try the spirits this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it's right move right with it then say Lord send us something else send us something else and he said Keep moving see just keep moving until every fellow takes his place then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get into its by its place that's when the Philistines will go to backing up the shorts will go off the here will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get into its might see Power when we have an ananias and Sapphira and a few of them yes sir you'll see when that
