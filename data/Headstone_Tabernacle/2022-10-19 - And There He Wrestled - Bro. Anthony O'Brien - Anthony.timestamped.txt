[26:09] okay
[26:11] amen
[26:13] Genesis 32 and chapter 24
[26:17] getting into this
[26:19] story we know about Jacob
[26:22] and this is kind of what we want to draw
[26:23] context tonight amen
[26:25] Genesis 32 24
[26:28] says and Jacob was left alone
[26:31] and there Wrestled a man with him until
[26:35] the breaking of the day
[26:37] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[26:39] against him he touched the hollow of his
[26:42] time
[26:43] and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out
[26:45] of joint
[26:46] as he wrestled with hymns all of this is
[26:50] happening in the moment amen
[26:53] Nextbook says now he said let me go for
[26:57] the day breakth and he said I will not
[27:00] let thee go except thou bless me
[27:03] and he said unto him what is thy name
[27:06] and he said Jacob
[27:09] and he said thy name shall be called No
[27:11] More Jacob but Israel for us a prince
[27:15] has doubt power with God and with men
[27:19] and has prevailed amen
[27:23] uh one one second here please go on and
[27:26] has prevailed amen
[27:28] and Jacob asked him and he said tell me
[27:30] I pray thee thy name and he said
[27:32] wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after
[27:34] my name and he blessed him there and
[27:37] Jacob called the name of the place
[27:39] penile for I have seen God face to face
[27:42] on my life is preserved amen remember he
[27:47] was faint for his life but he got a
[27:49] blessing there and his life was
[27:51] preserved amen what a blessing amen I
[27:55] want that kind of blessing tonight amen
[27:58] my life is preserved amen hallelujah
[28:01] it's not right
[28:03] oh wonderful right so Saint Luke 16 now
[28:05] 16 and verse 16 just one was there we
[28:09] want to read amen and then ask God's
[28:11] blessings upon a little thought here
[28:13] tonight
[28:15] by the grace of God Saint Luke 16
[28:17] from verse 16. says the law and the
[28:20] prophets were until John
[28:23] since that time the kingdom of God is
[28:26] preached and every man press it into it

[28:39] your call Upon Our Lives father Lord
[28:42] It's a privilege to walk in this way

[28:48] that find it Lord but we thank you for
[28:50] your love Upon Us Lord Lord that you
[28:53] could help us to see in this last hour
[28:55] so father we pray that your lord as
[28:57] we've just read your scriptures Lord we
[28:59] pray your holy spirit will just come for
[29:00] a few moments Lord while we wait and
[29:03] talk about you Lord we pray that your
[29:05] presence would come and just anoint
[29:07] these scriptures we I have here tonight
[29:08] this little thought to share their God
[29:11] lord you know what you place upon my
[29:12] heart but I pray Lord that I say deliver
[29:14] it up to you now father that you prayed
[29:16] you multiply it alone make it a
[29:18] something Lord a minister and father to
[29:20] your people here tonight Lord that we
[29:23] could see something in your word Lord
[29:24] that would Inspire us Lord Inspire us to
[29:28] pray Inspire us to motivate us to be
[29:30] better Christians Lord to press the
[29:33] battle award Phantom to keep on keeping
[29:35] one father because there's a promise of
[29:37] the road amen and may your promise Lord
[29:39] that in your time and season you would
[29:42] fulfill it so bless your people tonight
[29:43] as we labor in the scripture tonight
[29:45] take me out of the way and hide me
[29:47] behind your cross Lord and just bless
[29:49] your people tonight in a special way we
[29:51] pray and ask it in Jesus name amen and
[29:54] amen you have your seats tonight glory
[29:56] to God hallelujah amen
[30:04] wonderful
[30:07] amen glory
[30:09] praise God okay
[30:11] God bless you tonight so I have a title
[30:14] amen short and sweet
[30:17] and there he wrestled amen that's my
[30:20] title tonight
[30:21] and there he wrestled
[30:24] amen that's my title amen so it speaks
[30:27] about a few things there it's just a
[30:28] short uh phrase but there's a few things
[30:31] in there and there he wrestled there
[30:33] talking about a place praise God there's
[30:36] a place where you meet with God
[30:39] amen and that that he is a subject and
[30:42] we're praying tonight that each one of
[30:43] us could find amen that place where we
[30:47] could go to wrestling amen wrestling
[30:50] with who wrestling with uh uh uh with
[30:53] God isn't that right wrestling with that
[30:55] angel for the promise that he he gave
[30:57] isn't that wrong amen and rap that
[31:00] wrestle there is a verb as we know amen
[31:03] and uh I'm going to read a definition
[31:05] here
[31:06] to wrestle it means to engage
[31:10] to engage in a much engage in a boat or
[31:13] a form in wrestling it is to wrestle
[31:17] with is Narayan another word for another
[31:20] way for it says to move or to maneuver
[31:22] wrestling means to force with difficulty
[31:26] praise God isn't that right and one of
[31:30] these interesting things about the word
[31:31] wrestle
[31:32] and as I was studying it I realized that
[31:36] wrestling does not ensure victory
[31:40] it's a struggle that they're talking
[31:42] about
[31:42] amen it's not guaranteed for you to win
[31:46] it's a wrestle it's a power versus
[31:49] another Power it's a force versus
[31:52] another force and who will win depends
[31:55] on who is more desperate than who it's
[31:58] more who is more determined than who
[32:00] that is who's going to win the wrestling
[32:03] match isn't that right that's what
[32:05] wrestle means amen and as we study this
[32:08] this story about Jacob and how he had
[32:12] come down to his defining moment he had
[32:15] sent everything away his wives and his
[32:17] children and all that he had and the
[32:19] Bible said he was left found alone oh
[32:23] and how we need to be found alone
[32:25] sometimes praise alone for all the cares
[32:28] of this life separated from everything
[32:30] that we think is so important that we
[32:32] think is so amen so so like like a
[32:35] pedestal like so valuable but God wants
[32:38] to get us alone tonight it's got us
[32:41] separated from the world separated from
[32:43] our thoughts separated from our cares
[32:46] separated from our ideas and get us
[32:49] locked into a channel where he could
[32:52] speak to you oh Gloria got in their
[32:55] rights no wonder the prophet used to go
[32:57] up into the mountains go up into the
[33:00] high places away from the noise away
[33:02] from the traffic away from the horns
[33:05] beeping away from the voices of other
[33:07] people why so he could hear the voice of
[33:10] God oh to hear something speak to him oh
[33:13] safe to speak to something and let
[33:15] somebody speak back to him or to have
[33:18] that communion he needed to separate
[33:20] himself and tonight that's what we come
[33:22] to do we come to separate ourselves from
[33:26] all unbelief and get locked into a
[33:28] channel where we know the promises of
[33:31] God are going to come to pass he
[33:34] promised the Holy Ghost he promised a
[33:36] failure he promises Celia he promised to
[33:39] anoint you that promise will not fail
[33:42] but it's your faith in his promised word
[33:46] that will bring it to pass nothing wrong
[33:49] with the promise it's how much you can
[33:51] reach out for it or that's how it's
[33:54] gonna be affected to you and tonight we
[33:57] come to wrestle oh to wrestle and to
[34:02] overcome to wrestle and to be victorious
[34:05] oh somebody say Amen tonight
[34:08] Hallelujah
[34:09] Oh Glory hallelujah amen
[34:14] and that's just the way it's set up
[34:17] in the world and since the fall of Man
[34:20] wouldn't go over that but we know how it
[34:22] developed from there into this present
[34:25] time
[34:26] and the world is designed that way in
[34:29] every Avenue of Life there is some form
[34:33] of struggle
[34:34] for survival man found himself in a
[34:38] dangerous place and they found it it's
[34:40] not right oh then the Wilderness
[34:42] fighting up with the Lions and the
[34:44] Tigers and the Bears it isn't that right
[34:46] he is in danger amen he's in a place
[34:49] where he has no control in the Garden of
[34:52] Eden he had power over this power over
[34:54] that but here man found himself in a
[34:56] place of danger constantly constantly
[34:59] fighting constantly hiding in tens and
[35:01] caves constantly making fire constantly
[35:04] cutting Spears from wood to defend
[35:07] himself why because he found himself in
[35:09] a great uh uh uh jungle praise God
[35:12] obtained us from all around it's not
[35:14] right and even in today's modern world
[35:17] even though things have become so
[35:18] civilized still there's a struggle
[35:21] there's a struggle to survive there's a
[35:23] struggle to make ends meet there's a
[35:25] struggle to wake up there's a struggle
[35:27] to step out there's a struggle to go to
[35:30] school struggle to get dedication
[35:32] struggle to pay your bills struggle to
[35:35] fight every day or wrestling every day
[35:38] you're struggling that's how life is
[35:40] designed
[35:41] foreign
[35:43] and God knew it would come like that but
[35:46] he purposely allowed it to come that way
[35:49] so that you could prove yourself in this
[35:53] age to be the bride you say you are then
[35:56] come on and struggle come on and fight
[35:59] because in that atmosphere in that
[36:02] environment is when what inside of you
[36:04] really comes out oh hallelujah
[36:08] hallelujah when it's ease and Zion you
[36:11] don't know what's in there everything
[36:12] looking the same but when you turn it
[36:14] over on his head when you turn it upside
[36:17] down oh and then you see what's really
[36:19] going on then it becomes a fight for
[36:22] Survivor then it becomes a struggle for
[36:24] life oh Hallelujah will bring situations
[36:28] within circumstances into your home into
[36:32] your marriage into your garage wherever
[36:35] you have to bring it he will bring it so
[36:37] that you could fight and struggle and
[36:41] wrestle and wrestle wrestle with your
[36:43] thoughts wrestle with your mind wrestle
[36:46] with your Hallelujah with your condition
[36:48] wrestle with your situation what are we
[36:51] fighting for we're fighting to overcome
[36:53] we fight understand we're fighting to
[36:56] press every foot we put forward is
[36:59] another foot closer another step closer
[37:02] I'm not away for Hallelujah into a
[37:05] promise
[37:07] that's what we're here to do tonight
[37:08] hallelujah oh do you believe it
[37:12] do you believe it Hallelujah
[37:15] and they wrestled oh we gotta find a
[37:19] place tonight I don't know where to be
[37:22] Jesus said drop here drop your job drop
[37:24] your curtain and go into your prayer
[37:26] closet oh Hallelujah and wrestle with
[37:28] God in there oh he don't overcome it
[37:31] while I grant to sit at him in my Throne
[37:33] oh Hallelujah it is to him that overcome
[37:36] it that is who will kept the victory oh
[37:39] Hallelujah but if if you're willing to
[37:42] fight if you're willing to wrestle if
[37:45] you're willing to battle if you're
[37:47] willing to grit to grind to scrape to
[37:50] scream to cry to crawl until you receive
[37:55] the baptism of the Holy Cross what are
[37:58] you willing to do what are you willing
[38:00] to sacrifice what are you willing to
[38:02] give up
[38:03] yeah
[38:05] Hallelujah
[38:07] and we'll see I hope by the grace of God
[38:09] we'll see as we go through these stories
[38:12] in the Bible
[38:13] that it come at Great personal sacrifice
[38:17] and if I could use that as a theme
[38:18] tonight almost with this message great
[38:21] personal sacrifice
[38:23] Jacob lost his leg in this fight
[38:27] what are you willing to give up tonight
[38:29] he couldn't walk with his swagger like
[38:31] he used to he couldn't walk with his
[38:33] punks unless he could walk with a rock
[38:35] like this young boy Rock like he used to
[38:37] he lost the whole of his tie in this
[38:39] battle he was willing to give up
[38:41] something but when he got up from there
[38:43] he was Victorious and that's how I want
[38:46] to be tonight oh if I lose my leg that's
[38:49] all right oh I wanna have a pitbull look
[38:53] on God's promise I want to have a pit
[38:56] bull to our luck on God's people and
[38:58] Promises tonight he promised the Holy
[39:00] Ghost that's mine he promised to deliver
[39:02] me it's mine he promised my freedom is
[39:05] mine he promised to break me out I've
[39:08] got a pit bull lock on it oh you can saw
[39:11] my arm off I'm still holding on if you
[39:14] cut my leg off I'm still holding on oh
[39:17] I'm still staying strong oh Hallelujah
[39:21] amen
[39:26] [Applause]
[39:27] determination
[39:29] a crit that's what it takes to wrestle
[39:34] now I have an interesting read here
[39:36] from Arabic
[39:38] now this is interesting here now he put
[39:40] an article called wrestling with God
[39:42] and this Rabbi is a teacher
[39:44] in the Jewish community
[39:47] and the Jews as we know very connected
[39:50] with Jacob and the story because in this
[39:52] story his name is changed to Israel and
[39:56] this is the Jews birthmark isn't that
[39:58] right this is the the whole thing here
[40:00] you see so here's what he says listen
[40:02] this real I just pull the X up out here
[40:04] just to bring a context from a Jewish
[40:06] conceptual or understanding of this
[40:09] wrestle because it's very important
[40:10] today listen to this
[40:12] he said traditional texts sometimes
[40:14] identify us Jews as benign
[40:18] or the children of Jacob
[40:21] and he said but but the name that the
[40:24] Torah and the Torah and that we
[40:26] ourselves use much more often Israel
[40:31] which is the children of Israel
[40:33] you see he says so Jacob becomes Israel
[40:37] however
[40:38] only after he wrestles with the angel
[40:42] then he changes from Jacob to Israel he
[40:46] says so this is here so in order to be
[40:49] an authentic Israelite he said we too
[40:53] must wrestle with God
[40:57] so the rabbi is saying basically how
[40:59] Israelites identified how Jews identify
[41:03] themselves with God is through the same
[41:05] story of Jacob where his name is changed
[41:08] from Jacob to Israel and he is basically
[41:11] saying in order for you to be an
[41:14] authentic which means real which means a
[41:17] genuine Israelite you too must wrestle
[41:20] with god oh if our fathers wrestled in
[41:24] the wilderness they say we too must also
[41:27] wrestle in order to belong oh how to
[41:31] wrestle to enter in and I say tonight if
[41:34] you want to call yourself a Christian
[41:35] you want to call yourself a Believer and
[41:38] you don't want to fight come on you have
[41:41] to wrestle too there's something you got
[41:43] to do you got to be willing to lay your
[41:46] life on the line for this birthrights
[41:49] you've got to be willing to cast it all
[41:52] aside for this birth rights for This
[41:55] Promise of God for this promise of the
[41:57] Holy Ghost for This Promise of the
[41:59] Rapture for this promise of the
[42:01] quickening power for This Promise of the
[42:03] Dynamics to the mechanics you've got to
[42:06] wrestle tonight in order for you to
[42:09] overcome oh
[42:11] oh you gotta make up your mind oh to
[42:14] wrestle to fight to press the battle
[42:20] it's not right
[42:22] and that's why Saint Luke 16 brings that
[42:24] into context for us because since that
[42:27] time the gospel has been preached and
[42:30] every man pressed their way into it if
[42:33] God forced you to wrestle God will force
[42:37] you also to wrestle to get down on your
[42:40] knees and begin to cry and ask for God
[42:44] to give you the Holy Ghost the burn burn
[42:47] Holy Ghost burning your soul put on all
[42:51] the lusts but on all our lives but not
[42:54] all the filths burn out everything
[42:55] inside of you oh and I don't want to
[42:58] come out fire is coming fire is coming
[43:01] fire is coming to burn to burn out the
[43:05] demons to burn out the lust and the lies
[43:07] and the filth God hallelujah it's gonna
[43:10] force the issue so that you struggle and
[43:14] that you fight until you win
[43:17] oh
[43:20] can I get an amen can I get a Hallelujah
[43:25] [Music]
[43:31] Glory
[43:33] you don't fight till you're tired
[43:36] if I tell it you feel like giving up
[43:38] you fight until you win
[43:41] regardless of what you lose you're
[43:43] fighting to win oh Hallelujah Give me
[43:47] liberty or give me debt oh there is
[43:51] there not a cause oh Hallelujah yes it
[43:54] looks bleak yes it looks dark yes it
[43:57] looks like the enemy have every
[43:59] stronghold conquered but if there is a
[44:02] cause for Christ in this hour then
[44:04] brother that ought to be enough for us
[44:07] to take our swords of the spirits into
[44:10] our hands and walk firmly into the
[44:14] battlefield
[44:15] jealous and Reckless and Page oh God's
[44:19] got your back tonight oh stand up and
[44:22] fight
[44:23] the good fight of fate
[44:26] and wrestle
[44:29] wrestle meets a struggle
[44:31] struggle
[44:33] isn't that right but Brown talk about
[44:35] that airplane
[44:37] when they're going past the sound
[44:38] barrier
[44:39] that it's going start to take up speed
[44:42] but as it gets faster it starts to shake
[44:46] it starts to wrestle with the air it
[44:50] starts to wrestle praise God with the
[44:52] sound barrier that's around it because
[44:54] it's trying to get to a speed that is
[44:57] just beyond that sound barrier but in
[44:59] order to do that it has to get faster
[45:02] and as they get faster it rattles what
[45:04] about them said look like the airplane
[45:06] look like the wings might tear off of it
[45:08] look like all the nuts and Bulls shaking
[45:10] inside but keep on pressing keep on
[45:13] pressing you're almost there the sound
[45:17] barriers right there your present
[45:19] promises right there the Holy Ghost is
[45:22] right there what you're longing for what
[45:25] your thirsting for what you're Desiring
[45:27] for what you've been coming to church
[45:29] for all these years what you've been
[45:32] praying for what you've been looking for
[45:34] a mighty Revival to bring the
[45:37] backsliders to heal to save the loss
[45:41] that anointing is almost there tonight
[45:44] you've just got to wrestle
[45:47] on the point
[45:52] Hallelujah
[45:54] to see the victory ahead
[45:55] [Applause]
[45:58] so the condition of the world today
[46:00] is designed
[46:01] to bring out the struggle itself
[46:04] it's not right
[46:06] it's not right
[46:07] so the act of wrestling itself does not
[46:10] really ensure victory it's an
[46:12] opportunity for victory isn't it it's an
[46:16] opportunity for you to be victorious but
[46:18] it depends on how much you willing to
[46:20] put into the fight
[46:22] tattoo Victorious you'll be in the
[46:24] wrestle oh but there's gonna be a
[46:26] wrestle whether you like it or not
[46:28] whether you're ready or not there's
[46:30] gonna be a wrestle there's a wrestle
[46:32] going on in this message and the devil
[46:34] is fighting he is fighting to the nail
[46:37] oh Hallelujah he doesn't want that Holy
[46:39] Ghost he doesn't want that Jesus Christ
[46:41] coming back upon the Earth but there is
[46:44] a promise tonight and that's what
[46:46] fighting for there is a Bible tonight
[46:49] and that's what Python's for there's a
[46:52] prophetic message tonight that William
[46:54] Branham fought for he wrestled he
[46:58] wrestled to the point of suicide he
[47:00] wrestled at a point I'm almost given up
[47:02] but he said though he's flaming yet I
[47:05] trust him the Lord give and the Lord
[47:08] take it away and he kept wrestling and
[47:11] fighting and struggling and tonight what
[47:15] are you fighting for oh come on now
[47:18] you're gonna fight come on now where's
[47:21] your catch with your caption with your
[47:23] energy
[47:24] oh oh Hallelujah
[47:28] [Music]
[47:34] you gotta dig deep
[47:38] find that thing that keeps you alive
[47:41] in order to win the battle
[47:43] sometimes boxes at the end of their wit
[47:45] at the end of the energy
[47:47] at the end of their last their last
[47:49] weekend
[47:50] and somehow
[47:52] by some Merit they're behind on the
[47:54] points
[47:56] so they're losing already and they're
[47:58] against the ropes somehow some boxers
[48:01] have the unique ability to tap into an
[48:04] extra resource deep tongue inside a
[48:07] reason for survival a reason to win this
[48:11] match it had a guy one time he used to
[48:14] box for money and he used to do it and
[48:16] you know he enjoyed his sport and did it
[48:18] for money and stuff like that was cool
[48:19] he liked it he enjoy it he leave boxing
[48:22] after a while times got hard the 1930s
[48:25] depression kicked in in America and then
[48:27] he ended up on the bread line trying to
[48:29] feed his children then he got desperate
[48:31] when the friend come and tell him come
[48:33] and let me boxes for bunny he said yeah
[48:35] I need money he went out there and start
[48:37] the fight he started to fight and fight
[48:40] he was winning every match he bounced up
[48:42] a man who he used to fight before and he
[48:45] calls telling brother you fight this man
[48:47] already what is your problem he said
[48:49] boss he said coach there's not the same
[48:52] man this man thirsty this man hungry
[48:55] this man pray
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:04] praise God it was a difference
[49:07] and you've got to have a test tonight oh
[49:10] I thought for the supernatural I touched
[49:12] by the promise I touch my healing I
[49:15] touched with Deliverance I touched me I
[49:17] break through you're gonna be so thirsty
[49:19] you don't care if I lose an arm lose her
[49:22] legs but I've got to get to the Finish
[49:24] Line oh I see my promise in view
[49:28] oh Hallelujah
[49:30] glory to God
[49:32] that's the attitude
[49:34] amen that's that mental attitude that
[49:37] brought the prophet is talking about
[49:38] that right mental attitude
[49:41] it comes from a deep desire a deep call
[49:45] into a deep there's got to be a tip to
[49:48] respond in your heart you know there's a
[49:51] deep out there somewhere God didn't call
[49:53] me for nothing all these years I was a
[49:56] teenager oh Hallelujah but God met me he
[49:59] spoke to my heart spoke to my pen I
[50:02] could never be the same no more he's
[50:04] still the same God he was all those
[50:05] years ago he's still the same God
[50:08] tonight he still heals he still seals he
[50:12] still delivers he still restores he
[50:15] still baptizes with the Holy Ghost on
[50:18] Fire he is the same yesterday
[50:22] oh today
[50:24] and forever
[50:26] Great Is Our God tonight well do you
[50:29] believe it
[50:30] yeah man give him a shout out please
[50:44] oh feeling good now
[50:46] so listen closely to this language here
[50:49] listen closely to this Revelation 3 21
[50:53] Bible says to him not overcome it
[50:55] well I Grant and sit with me in my truth
[50:58] even as I also overcame I must set down
[51:00] with my father in his room
[51:04] so that part I on the line there was to
[51:06] him that overcome it
[51:08] meaning this glorious victory
[51:12] that's being painted in the scripture by
[51:14] Jesus Christ himself he's saying it is
[51:17] to him that overcome it
[51:20] to him whosoever that is that is willing
[51:23] to break past that is willing to fight
[51:26] that is willing to press him
[51:28] do not overcome it will I grant to say
[51:30] to me my true oh Hallelujah him that is
[51:34] willing to pray him that is willing to
[51:36] sacrifice him that is willing to call
[51:39] upon God he
[51:40] that is willing to pray and to pass and
[51:43] to do all that he can do he or her
[51:45] whoever praise God is not right
[51:47] promise is to
[51:52] get enough
[51:53] him not overcome it
[51:55] okay let's take another scripture Joshua
[51:57] 14 12. this is Caleb
[51:59] Caleb says now therefore give me this
[52:03] mountain
[52:03] oh he's making his appeal right he said
[52:06] where of the Lord speak in that day in
[52:08] other words he has a revelation he knows
[52:11] that this mountain they're talking about
[52:12] is not a random Mountain but this is his
[52:16] Mountain this is the one Moses speak of
[52:19] oh Hallelujah I've got it written down
[52:23] praise God hallelujah I can quote it
[52:25] back where that Prophet said that this
[52:28] is my Mountain
[52:30] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh but I'm
[52:34] tired of having it on paper I want it in
[52:37] reality I wanted materialize I want my
[52:41] mountain
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:45] all right you hear the language
[52:49] all right good amen so he said where the
[52:52] Lord speak in our day for thou hood is
[52:55] that the anarchyms would oh my under the
[52:58] cities are great and fence but he's not
[53:00] worried about that he goes on he said if
[53:02] so be watch this now that the Lord will
[53:05] be with me
[53:07] then I shall be able to drive them out
[53:11] as the Lord had said oh honey in other
[53:14] words he's taken his confidence and
[53:16] God's ability to help him in his hour of
[53:19] need but he ain't afraid he is not
[53:22] scared tonight to go all the way up or
[53:25] up on his mountain and take what
[53:27] rightfully belongs to him he's already
[53:30] convinced of that oh hallelujah
[53:33] hallelujah oh Hallelujah and if the Lord
[53:37] be at me that I shall be able to drive
[53:41] them out as the Lord had said in other
[53:43] words there might be a risk factor here
[53:45] if the Lord is not with me I might make
[53:48] it Hallelujah by the will to pull it all
[53:50] on the line to know that he is with me
[53:53] and that I will be able to overcome
[53:56] Hallelujah I've got faith to believe
[53:58] that he didn't bring me out this power
[54:00] for me to walk around in the wilderness
[54:02] and die no no no no no I got Visions man
[54:06] I want to see my mountain man I want to

[1:03:13] appreciate me when you get out there in
[1:03:14] the ring he said that was right that was
[1:03:16] right all right so here's another quote
[1:03:19] here amen just some inspiration tonight
[1:03:21] amen just encourage you
[1:03:23] preparation Prophet said here uh uh uh
[1:03:26] paragraph 46 said here not long ago I
[1:03:28] was in the west heard of an Indian that
[1:03:30] got converted said how are you feeling
[1:03:32] chief after a few days he said well
[1:03:35] pretty good pretty bad said what do you
[1:03:38] mean Prophet said pretty good we said
[1:03:39] what do you mean pretty good said well
[1:03:40] since I got saved said there's two dogs
[1:03:43] in me he said one's black and one's
[1:03:47] white and he said and they just fight
[1:03:49] all the time he said the black dog wants
[1:03:52] to do me bad and he's having a good dog
[1:03:54] wants me to do good or the white dog
[1:03:57] wants me to do good and stuff like that
[1:03:58] right he said so what's so the prophet
[1:04:01] asked him he said which one is going to
[1:04:02] win chief he said huh he said well
[1:04:04] depends on which one Chief feeds the
[1:04:07] most

[1:04:10] oh you've got to feed your faith tonight
[1:04:13] and starve your doubts feed your page
[1:04:17] and that thoughts get going to fighting

[1:04:45] fight

[1:04:52] feed your faith in it if it's not right

[1:04:56] the thing that's in your heart now the
[1:04:58] prophet said telling you that it is
[1:05:00] God's truth telling you that that is the
[1:05:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the way he

[1:20:20] do we come into it amen I just love it
[1:20:23] just like the same just like the Jew had
[1:20:26] to wrestle to become Israelite so to you
[1:20:27] oh you who the gospel was preached to
[1:20:30] you who by the sacrifice of Christ have
[1:20:33] been they joined heirs with him
[1:20:35] Hallelujah the main fellow heirs into
[1:20:37] the kingdom yet there's something we
[1:20:39] have to do there's a part we have to
[1:20:41] play in order to enter in because by one
[1:20:45] Spirit we are baptized into that party
[1:20:47] and that the kingdom of God is preached
[1:20:49] and every man have to press their way so
[1:20:52] that that Spirit could baptize you into
[1:20:54] himself you've got to have a desire a
[1:20:58] strong desire a thirst it's got to
[1:21:00] overwhelm you it's going to overcome you
[1:21:03] oh Hallelujah tell all you want all you

[1:21:22] looking for
[1:21:23] amen amen hallelujah okay can I read
[1:21:27] this here oh Hallelujah the thing of it
[1:21:30] is I was saying last night the Prof the
[1:21:32] Pentecostals are waiting for a Russian
[1:21:33] right to win but they failed to hit a
[1:21:35] still Small Voice see that's what's
[1:21:37] wrong to do these things they think as
[1:21:39] long as the wind is rushing it's all
[1:21:40] right but that didn't attract The
[1:21:41] Prophet's attention
[1:21:43] rushing we never bothered the Elijah in
[1:21:45] the cave the mighty Thunder and
[1:21:48] Lightnings and things pouring down never
[1:21:50] attracted them at all but what's Title
[1:21:53] Here what caught his attention was that
[1:21:55] still Small Voice that's something
[1:21:57] speaking with inside
[1:21:59] with inside that my word is truth let
[1:22:02] every man's word be a lie I let mine be
[1:22:05] true see he said that's what attracted
[1:22:07] the prophets see he said and it'll still
[1:22:09] do it the word of God always attracts
[1:22:11] that spiritual mind because it's a mind
[1:22:14] of Christ in you that knows that that
[1:22:16] word is true another Prophet said then
[1:22:19] you go through a testing time he said
[1:22:21] and a church goes through a testing time
[1:22:23] each individual goes through a testing
[1:22:26] time before it can ever possess the Gate
[1:22:30] of the enemy you've got to go through a
[1:22:33] testing time a time of wrestling a time
[1:22:36] of fighting oh a victory seems uncertain
[1:22:38] but you've got a promise in your soul
[1:22:40] that you're holding on to and when
[1:22:43] everything else is stripped away when
[1:22:45] all your thoughts all your hopes all
[1:22:48] your cares are Stripped Away then one
[1:22:50] thing about desired David shared one
[1:22:53] thing about it is higher and that will I
[1:22:56] seek after Lord that I might dwell in
[1:23:00] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:23:03] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:23:05] until quiet as temples because in a time
[1:23:09] of trouble in a time of trouble he shall
[1:23:12] hide me in his Pavilion in a secret
[1:23:15] place he saw hide me and he shall set me
[1:23:19] up upon a rock and now my head shall be
[1:23:22] lifted up above mine enemies because
[1:23:25] thou has made all of the Lord thy God
[1:23:29] thy habitation oh somebody give him a
[1:23:33] shot of praise tonight
[1:23:35] oh
[1:23:37] Hallelujah
[1:23:38] glory to God
[1:23:40] oh Hallelujah you could keep standing
[1:23:42] unfinished we could worship Christ went
[1:23:45] through it he said after Christ was
[1:23:46] filled the Holy Ghost he could place
[1:23:47] Them Softly he said after Christ was
[1:23:49] filled with the Holy Spirit there at the
[1:23:52] River Jordan Prophet said he went
[1:23:54] through a testing time after Abraham was
[1:23:56] called out
[1:23:58] put into his land where he was to be a
[1:24:00] pilgrim given a circumcision all that
[1:24:03] God met him time after time yet he had
[1:24:05] to go through a timer testing every seat
[1:24:09] of Abraham does the same thing Abraham
[1:24:12] and his seat and he said any
[1:24:14] organization a church that reason we
[1:24:16] find organization is failing because
[1:24:18] when it comes to the test what test he
[1:24:20] said God's word
[1:24:22] there's a test can you hold on can you
[1:24:25] believe oh I'll only believe oh how all
[1:24:29] things are possible hold to that word
[1:24:31] tonight
[1:24:32] there's a test he says God's word is the
[1:24:35] test
[1:24:35] will we do what a bunch of man says do
[1:24:37] or will we do what God says to he said
[1:24:41] that is the difference
