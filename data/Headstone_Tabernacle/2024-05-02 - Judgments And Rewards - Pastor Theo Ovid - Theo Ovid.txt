red in verse 7 behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the SS of the prophecy of this book and Ian saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then say he unto me see thou do it not for I'm thy fellow servant un of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sins of this book worship God he said unto me seal not the sins of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand what time he do unjust let him unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give Every Man a according as his work shall be I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed that they that do his Commandments that they might have the right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city for without at dogs and Sorcerers and hungers and murderers idolators and who whosoever love it and make it a lie I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the the bright and morning star and the spirit in the bright say come let him that hear it say come let him that at thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that he the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he that testified these things sayth surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight and Lord I'm so needy of you and I pray that you would help me Lord and take me out of the way and all the different things may you place it together and present this Vision this picture of your present tense doings and Revelations father Grant it Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God Amen so tonight I have a title judgments and rewards that's a title I have tonight judgments and rewards now God never brings any man to his debt without first warning him about it telling him something he knocks on the man heart man may have a funny feeling whatever but God and and and this is it God does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do because it is his nature to do that it is God's nature to warn a man before judgment or to warn a nation before judgment or want a church or individual it doesn't matter it is just his nature to warn he always gives his warning a reminder to us who have a responsibility and we are responsible and God put us here on Earth for a reason and that reason that he put us here for we are responsible to him for that reason and therefore it is your duty to find out what he wants you to do you're not existing here it's not by chance it's specific that God put you here for a purpose and a reason and you want to find out what you are here for isn't that right and because we have a responsibility we have got to answer to God someday for that every man that come on the face of the Earth has to answer to God for a responsibility and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for this responsibility is a stewardship that has been committed to us by God I don't care what it is it could be a housewife if it's a housewife be a genu housewife if it is to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that God put us put you to do you got a stewardship that you got to answer for so each one of us have a responsibility each one of us have a stewardship each one of us have the give an account some point in time isn't that right now watch first what God does he sends his prophets to bring warning so that's why God sent Malachi 4 that's why God sent William maram Brown to bring a warning to the Earth behold I send you Elijah the prophet when before the great and terity of the Lord because that day is coming so before that day strikes he sends Elijah to bring a message and this message have been echoing over the through the Earth around the world over 50 plus years isn't that right this is not this Yer this message is not a yesterday message this message is way back it's years upon years it is known around the world isn't that right now watch so he find he send his prophets with warning he doesn't change his way or his method of doing things he does not always strike when he warns I want you to watch this quotation God gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he warns and then the prophet is mocked he didn't have it he told a lie wasn't right and that's what it is isn't that right because God have a timing and man don't know his timing so he gave them the opportunity to talk and laugh and mock but one thing we know God can't do is lie once it come out the mouth of God it cannot return void God going to bring it back with something so when God sent for you by his word it couldn't come out empty you came because of the call of God put upon your life isn't that right so once there's a Vindicated Prophet that word got to come to pass that judgment the only thing could stop it he said is quick repentance now here we go tonight now this what I'm about to read here now is something we have read many times before but tonight it just struck me so different and I want to bring it back again now watch during these Church ages there's two Spirits working almost alike right down through here one is the denomination the other one is the Holy Ghost and Jesus said they will be so close that they would receive the very elected was possible here we go these two Spirits are marking their people for future judgment now we heard that before but what you think about that now these two Spirits are [Music] marking their people for future judgment in other words there is the Judgment of reward and there is the judgments of God hallelujah for the bride or for the elect you have to be judged but to be rewarded Hallelujah so there will to be judgments and there will be rewards but people are being marked Now isn't that right marked by the attitude so people bad attitude inside of here that that not hurting me any Bullhead attitude people don't want to Humble theel that's not affecting me you know that affecting the people according to the word I could judge you God will judge me but you can't judge me you could pray for me to all those who figur that Moses seat both here and online I want to judge they better be careful because this is prophecy the two Spirits are marking their people for future judgment Satan promised that he would have more than Christ and now watch this close now praise God it will be a mark in the people and we know the two marks going out the mark of God and the mark of the beast it's two systems two spirits that will be working in the framework of the church and we are called to discern the two spirits and withand and jam the other Spirit in order to bust through because the spirits come to tie you up to mess you up to bring a heaviness to bring a weight upon your life to to encroach upon your space that God give you and you have a right to rebuke to push back to allow nobody to take and occupy the space that God put you here God as a Son of God God as you as a daughter of God or a son of God God give you your space it is your space oh God don't let no demon come inside of there whether they are upon family or friends relatives church members keep your space keep the atmosphere around you clear you are creator of an atmosphere glory to God you are not a garbage dump don't let nobody come and dump the whole story on you and Paul that said a trash on you tell them go with that tell your story walking oh give the Lord some Praises don't get pack up in HS and grudges and hurts and pains and who do you want drop everything fast and get light get free praise God isn't that right even Jesus bust his own disciples he said forget about them phans he said they have their reward them Hypocrites but don't do like them well give the Lord some Praises they have their reward but your reward is not like their reward love your enemies hate them that pray do good to them that HTE you oh glory to God they ask you to go one mile go two miles oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus amen you know the Saints will judge the Earth right that's what the Bible teaches us right the Saints going to judge the Earth isn't that right hallelujah praise God so if people are being marked people will be tested with the attitude towards rebuke towards instructions towards correction towards the officers and and God watching so and people do their own thing the Vex and they carrying with that attitude that ending tape Sunday was mindblowing for me and it's the first time I hear Brother BR say you want to wear earrings keep wearing them you want to do this keep doing it that is I have to read that back again you know I've never heard the prophet say say do it go and do it you want to do it go and do it God will give it his have your own heart but judgment coming and that's the problem I keep saying for Years brother Kangley judgment has not struck this message yet so people getting a word murder they think they're getting away what they think they deceived in message thinking because they believe prophet and have books and tapes they could see anything do anything think anything act any way and it's okay that's what they have any message message folks I'm not talking about denomination and Pentecost I'm talking about message folks who think they're right because they're in the right group they think is the right group and the prophet Clearly say every group have three kinds so have no right kind because the body is Christ and by one Spirit you're baptized into that one body nobody in trainer to change that that is just the word of God so anybody say their group is Liars lying and the pulpit lying to the people and God will judge them judgment and rewards coming oh give the Lord Us Praise In The House glory to God he said don't add don't take away we don't need to add God sent a prophet to reveal the whole mystery of God for the Raptor of the church I don't need to come here to explain something that you don't need an explanation for the word is God God can't lie he bring a word and you know what that word is Oh Glory to God what we see should make a church that would make a Revival how you going to make a church make Revival Get Your Heart Right get your soul in order praise God get get get get cleaned [Applause] up God can't clean you up in other words God can't take the rubbish in your system you had to deal with that he bring the word he save you he pull you out you can't you be grateful can't you be thankful you couldn't come andless the father draw you you were drawn up because is you're not a Christian by your own choice you a Christian because God chose you to be a Christian that's why God call [Music] you all he ask is some gratefulness and some thankfulness and some worship and some praise and some appreciation what trial going through the church is not closed down what trial you're going through praise God what Tri you a hit the Wilderness yet oh give the Lord a shout you a meet Lucifer by yourself yet oh God go go get me started tonight this message is you know trials the trials coming most of the crappy things is your own self your own human Spirit your own mistakes and your own bad decisions get you in trouble and all kind of thing and they call a trial what trial Jesus led by the Holy Ghost Into the Wilderness you have been led by what the Holy Ghost itself LED Jesus Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil Oh Glory to God and when he get the anointing and overcome the devil dry as a biscuit it is written it is written it is also written he said that for you and I he said it is written you don't need no gift you don't need to be a pastor a minister a deacon to overcome all you need is a plain word dry biscuit beer word Satan it is written but if you don't read the word you don't know the word you can't tell no devil nothing about what is written because you don't know what is written for years God pumping this word for you to understand what is written to fight back the devil the word say resist the devil and he shall flee from you you have to fight back okay the Lord some pray don't tell me the devil have here and you have to do this and you have to do that we want to praise God run that Tas mask straight out of here you don't have to do you could go free oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah what reward you're going to get if you don't overcome the reward is for the Overcomers then you have to have something to overcome Oh Glory to God something have to be in your life to overcome something have to test you something have to try you something have to prove you whether it's your wife whether it's your children whether it's your husband whether it's your family whether is the job whether it's the neighbor it doesn't matter who you are where is church [Music] members it's time we stop thinking about people and start to think what how God sees and this this what I keep thinking Minister say this and carry on do this and what and ask a question how does God see this I see parents in this church act so cuckoo and I'm asking myself how does God see that I see people get disrespectful and judged and they're not even thinking they're not even understanding what has happened and I can't say a word just leave it alone just keep pressing on because they know better it's a choice so the people who came out of Egypt and following Moses they don't know this God of Abraham Isaac they don't know this God of Moses they come to the mountain now they're dancing they partying until when they find Moses they can to Long say a make us a God now gosh man we need a God then they pull out all the earrings gold they make a golden calf they said this is the god that brought us out of Egypt and almighty God watching them here in this bunch of like idiots like fools see Power displayed see might displayed see Pharaoh humiliated yes in front of all the other nations see the Reds he open up and they make their own god what have been preaching for years people making their own God in this message I call it the god of their own imagination their message God they make that not the god of the Bible so you want to tell me after God come down Moses come down with with with with the Ten Commandments written by the Finger of God Throw Down The Commandments earthquake bust thing open people fall inside of there what are the other people remaining to think that this God not real you see partners and friends and arguments and talkers and and talkers and Walkers and everything else gone down in a big hole swallowed up God always displays his power his judgments and we'll get it he did it in the early church it wasn't you know I have a disagreement with the pastor I have a disagree no it wasn't that you know it was Jesus God wanted to keep that church so pure that any impure had to be cut offall cut out judged out hallu so because man have books and tapes and call ministers and call pastors they could see anything by the pulpit bind the people to themselves see the people against a next church and next Ministry and what not do all of that and say that God that bride Whispering Whispering Whispering two Spirits are now present tense marking their people for future judgment marking people to be judged and mocking people to be sealed because you cannot be in the bride if you're not sealed with the Holy Ghost it have no bride I'm in the message I am bride I'm the I am the bride that's only talk that's just talk we're not here to present talk we here to present what god require of us the bride will be the Holy Ghost filled do you get that the bride is not who take the corona the vaccine that the kind of dness that they had I the vaccine the Beast everybody take Max that kind of nonsense that educated intellect people think that and accept that nonsense equate Mark of the Beast with vaccine what an that have to do with what God Said go talk about vaccine in the Bible seal all those who cry and for what for the Abomination if you are in Abomination you can't cry for that if you're living an abominable life you can't cry for that you have to come above that and that's why I saying it is going beyond the sin question and getting into growing as a Christian because God want you to hate what he hates and love what he loves and to get back where Holiness becomes a way of life not something that is mentioned in the message Holiness becomes a way of life because he is Holy he said be holy because I am Holy oh give the Lord some Praises this is message this not wesle sanctification this is the word of God oh give the Lord awesome Praises this is the seven drops of blood sprinkled upon The Mercy Seat woo Oh Glory to God and this Mercy Seat was extended to Seven Ages so endless people in this message of the hour are deceived they are deceived they're deceived by the same books and tapes that they believe go they feel like old two Spirits marking their people for future judgment you're being marked if you are the bride for the Judgment of rewards Prophet speaks and what's the matter the day here we go the sleeping virgin or we call it the foolish virgin stayed long enough to get part of the word but not all of the word the deceived Church says long enough to get part of the word but not all of the word he had but and they were sincere and honest about it but they were deceived sincere honest deceived let's go Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his people and a sign of judgment to the Lost World Moses was a sign of Deliverance and a judgment to Egypt both wrapped up in the same man isn't that something Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his people a sign of judgment to the Lost World the unbeliever the very Waters that choked the world and drown the world was the only means of saving Noah the only thing that could save him was the Judgment but that's a powerful statement for nor to be saved the rain of to fall The Rain Fallen means the world being judged Noah salvation was judgment to everybody else the water is what was needed to raise the ark yes and that water was coming to kill so we talk about Dynamics we talking about the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost taking another bride killing the world you know judge the world you do you know the coming of The Headstone closes the Gentile dispensation do you understand the Gentile dispensation closes with the bride being sealed sealed into the the kingdom of God then the angel from the East could now go to the Jews to see the 144,000 the angel can't go there until the bride be sealed and the bride after getting condition to be sealed a condition to be marked Glory do you get a church you have to be in condition to be marked to be sealed to be filled bu to be kept to receive the Dynamics of your mechanics when atomic bombs and people are scared in the Pentagon they don't know what to do and Mystic signs in the skies are flying sources everywhere God predicted it is time for that Elijah to rise on the scene then he prophesies let the people people let that little flock let that little Remnant that God will give him let that little Remnant go to calling out to God and Watch What Happens there'll be a national Showdown prophecy there'll be a power that they have never seen before what kind of intellectual idiot want to say we going to leave here without any power are we going to leave it with Mysteries we cast out Devils with Mysteries Christ has to become the mystery of God revealed in Dynamics and mechanics he said wait till that little group that God going to give that Elijah wait till that group go to calling upon God the people are content the people are satisfied the people are feel entitled in the message there's no need for anybody to call upon God but give me a bright church that understand the season and time that time is running out that truly an end the end is come oh give the Lord a praise in the house and the Death Angel is about to move the angel is commissioned to move to take out anybody that don't have the token anyone that don't have the blood on the doorpost oh give the Lord Us Praise in the house when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you I don't care who your pastor is I don't care how much books you have I don't care what Mysteries what Revelation he's looking for the token itself he's looking for the Holy Ghost itself he's looking for the seal from Faith all the way up to charity let's say it again let the people I talking about you tonight let little fluck that little Remnant that God will give him let that little Remnant go to calling out to God and Watch What Happens the curse of entitlement it's a terrible thing you know it scares me people think they come like if you think I'm supposed to hear all every all the time and you hear but gone gone and then do all the time the curse of entitlement you entitled to what really because you wear a long dress we entitled too sisters wearing long dress and the bad attitude towards the husband rude disrespectful their spirit is not in the word they're bullheaded at home they play shy in church but they're like bullheads in the husband house they're not taking any word to say this spirit is what I want the spirit of Sarah I want to be like how what gods I'm supposed to be that is my scriptures that is my word same apply for the husband you should be a priest in the house a man in the house a Son of God in the house but want but you see when things are compromised and when things are tolerated it come like the gome and afterward God has tolerate a certain amount of thing he said because the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full you think time running and God let CS full let all the sin full Let It full and when they full go ready to pour out pour the Judgment for the full cup of iniquity we have to come to a spot where we reject medoc mediocrity why you reject the flaws and is all right is all right you know what time service starting what time you leav in your house if service starting 10: and you leave 10:00 when you reach in service there's a choice no angel pulling you out your house to come here fast No Angel pull in your house to come here to pray up this service that's a choice everybody have a choice to what they put in in church to what they put in the prophet said that woman that was crying in Jesus feet she didn't even know what Jesus thought because he never said a word he leave her there until he do everything and then he got a reward this woman who sends on many are forgiven oh give the Lord some Praises in the house he may let you do a lot of stuff and it looked like he's not looking it looked like he's not hearing it looked like he's not seeing but he is seeing he is hearing he is knowing and he going to give you that reward and he told Simon I have a word for you I come in here and never wash my feet I come in here and never treat me right I have a word for you but this womanall hallu I'm not fighting to be no tribulation Saint I'm not fighting for that I keep blasting I don't care if it end up to six people in the church we going have a super Church a super race has be near the headstone they're going to walk out look the exit I ain't afraid to tell look the exit we're trying to drag nobody inside of here but I know

and them seven Thunders watch what take place you better get to Goan while there is time to get to Goan oh praise God I want to turn to Acts chapter 5 for the scripture reading and we verse one acts 5 ver1 it says don't know they could get this in the back a certain man named anas his Sapphire's wife sto a possession kept back part of the price his wife also being privit so she know what's going on and brought a certain part and laid it at the Apostles feet but Peter said ananas why has Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whil it remain was it not thine own after it was sold was it not thine own power why H has thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God so the thought was a man the lon to because the custom Lon a lion anointing was back there all right annias hearing these words fell down give up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things this a happen yet but it's going to happen six and the young men arose wed him up carry him out and buried him it was about a space of 3 hours after his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter answered unto her tell me whether you sold the land for so much she said yeah for so much then pet said to her how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried the husband at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she down straightway at his feet yielded up The Ghost and the young man came came in and found her dead carried her forth and buried her by her husband verse 11 said and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as who these things it is notable and I never saw this before that judgment came forth first before great power was expressed so therefore this acts 5 up to verse 11 was judgment on the church where God dealt with anas and Safara because they did not discern who was sitting on Peter's heart they did not discern they wasn't talking to a man it was the Holy Ghost that was veiled in a man isn't that right so he lighted the holy ghost look at verse 12 now of that same chapter so fear upon the people because of what happened but look at verse 12 and by the hands of the apostle that after that were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch so after God cleaned that act out of the church signs wonders Miracles and verse 13 and the rest does no man join himself to them but the people magnify them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes of men and women in so much verse 15 that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at least a shadow of Peter passing might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the city wrong about Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone Dynamics to the mechanics adopted Sons Moving in power the church cleaned out of anas Safa and the prophet said we going to have some more of that again oh G we have a lot to look forward for judgments and rewards oh give the Lord some

healed and then because he did this makes him rich in Mercy as he has always been rich in Mercy it must be and if he refuse this there is nothing left but the Judgment because sin must be judged many time we forget that Jesus Took upon him our sins in that's why he was judged do you know Christ was judged he was judged at Calvary because he had our sins upon him but sin couldn't just change or stain his character so when he went down to hell he could offload that sin on the devil Rose pure as ever to redeem us and to play our case so our judgment was in Christ so we don't have to be judged again oh give the Lord a shout say any man being Christ he's a new creature Hallelujah Glory Pharaoh went into the sea an impostor seeing that he could go in like Moses did Pharaoh think that se was that way was made for him that was made for God rich in Mercy made a way of Escape for the Hebrew children why because they followed in the line of duty they were following in the word now that's the only way to obtain Mercy is to follow the instruction that God give us to follow in that's the only way he can show Mercy is when we follow what he said do remember God can't go by our feelings

the light of the unfolding word and you will get your breakthrough God hates sin and sin must be judged he said I we got a fine president but we put everyone one in every county in the United States will still not do good it will take the comment of the Lord Jesus to do it sin must be judged and I say this with respect uh the Christian ministers if God let this generate get by without giving them

shrewdness of their own simple human mind which is nothing but filtness before God oh God may they get just empty out and humble submit themselves and come for the filling of the spirit oh my let me he PR a prayer in this message is Spirit our heavenly father I want to express it if I can this morning how in my heart I feel towards one the holiest of holies coming down to the Earth to redeem a sinner like myself and I'm sure that these ministers that are present now can feel the same way that it was by your grace that we have been made Ministers of this Covenant that thou was given with Adam's Fallen race and we are here this morning Father father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God that we must do to make Christ real to the people unto this generation listen knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to Father God please through Jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong may we be have sincere hearts and open mind that we might receive the things that is yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work after the day and be better equipped because of meeting with you this morning granted Lord and I going close up right there oh praise God hallelujah Luke 4 Jesus went to Nazareth I'm going to summarize and there was delivered him the book of the prophet Isaiah when he opened the book he found the place was written we know it he sto in the middle of a sentence to preach the accept of the Lord the other part from Isaiah 61 was and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn and the prophet said this here he's cutting you out now talk about the bride cutting you down to his word only cutting all the Crees and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back to the bride for the son another Masterpiece listen to this part Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read the day in the book he read just part of the prophecy he left the rest of it for the last day we are supposed to take that part what part the day of Vengeance human could take over the Vengeance no it has to be the ministry of Jesus Christ back in the church to take up the Avent we who born in sin could take a Vengeance vengeance is mine sayth the Lord I will repay we cannot take that up in other words Flesh and Blood can't pick that up but when the pillar of fire is veiled again in flesh the holy spirit will pick it back up it will be judgment
