[1:05:13] parts I'll share something about AIESEC
[1:05:15] will come behind and share something
[1:05:18] with you I will have a prayer I am
[1:05:20] praise God reading from Isaiah chapter
[1:05:24] 61 we want to reverse one two three
[1:05:27] Daniel 12:1 verse was one only wanted to
[1:05:32] read from Romans chapter 13 verse 11 to
[1:05:34] 14 so we go to Isaiah chapter 61 we
[1:05:40] didn't voice one two three the spirit
[1:05:43] and remember Jesus will be using these
[1:05:46] same words in in Luke chapter 4 but this
[1:05:50] is the Spirit of God upon Isaiah this is
[1:05:54] Christ's Spirit speaking through him he
[1:05:57] said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:05:58] me this is that for Isaiah now this is
[1:06:02] him in the spirit speaking the Spirit of
[1:06:05] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[1:06:07] had anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:06:10] unto the meek he had sent me purpose to
[1:06:17] bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[1:06:20] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[1:06:23] of the prison to them that are bound to
[1:06:25] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:06:29] and the day of vengeance of our God to
[1:06:32] comfort all that mourn to appoint unto
[1:06:35] them that mourn in Zion to give them
[1:06:37] beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for
[1:06:40] mourning the garment of praise for the
[1:06:44] spirit of heaviness
[1:06:45] that they might be called trees of
[1:06:48] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:06:51] that he might be glorified and readin
[1:06:54] from Daniel chapter 12 real verse 1 and
[1:07:00] at that time shall Michael stand up the
[1:07:04] Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:07:06] children of thy people and there shall
[1:07:09] be a time of trouble such as never was
[1:07:11] since there was a nation even to the
[1:07:12] same time and at that time thy people
[1:07:16] shall be delivered every one that shall
[1:07:21] be found written in the book that is not
[1:07:25] a perhaps that is that a maybe everyone
[1:07:28] written in that book shall not perhaps
[1:07:33] that maybe shall be delivered a reading
[1:07:36] from Romans chapter 13 reading from
[1:07:39] verse 11 and that knowing the time that
[1:07:43] now it is high time to a week out of
[1:07:47] sleep for now is our salvation nearer
[1:07:51] than when we believed the night is far
[1:07:55] spent the days of him let us therefore
[1:07:58] cast off the works of darkness and let
[1:08:01] us put on the armor of light let us walk
[1:08:04] honestly as in the day not in rioting
[1:08:06] and drunkenness and in chambering and
[1:08:08] wantonness not in strife and envying but
[1:08:12] putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:08:14] make not provisions for the flesh to
[1:08:16] fulfill the lusts thereof
[1:08:18] let's pray one more time father we thank
[1:08:19] you for your word come and inhabit your
[1:08:22] word Lord and speak out through your
[1:08:23] word by your spirit bless your people
[1:08:26] Lord and take me out of the way and O
[1:08:28] God the whole service today father may
[1:08:31] you be glorified and magnified and you

[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:44] our title this morning another year of
[1:08:47] Jubilee then judgment another year of
[1:08:52] Jubilee then judgment and then I have a
[1:08:54] scripture inspiration revolution 2017
[1:08:57] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:09:01] God will have a Speas for the spirit to
[1:09:04] anoint the bride to give that bride a
[1:09:06] voice oh praise the name of the Lord do
[1:09:10] you believe that so Caleb and Joshua
[1:09:12] there were men of feet they were men of
[1:09:15] integrity who know God said dong in
[1:09:17] Egypt I give you the land and that's
[1:09:19] good enough there wasn't there when
[1:09:21] Abram was alive but God told Abraham he
[1:09:24] you have seed with Cecilia in a strange
[1:09:26] land God will bring them all and they
[1:09:28] will get a land that they're gonna
[1:09:29] possess so they took the word from what
[1:09:31] God said and they believe the word oh
[1:09:35] praise God I give the land that's good
[1:09:37] enough they run to the people the people
[1:09:39] are mourning crying and so on but Caleb
[1:09:41] said we are well able to possess that
[1:09:43] land he's not right but they ought to
[1:09:46] fight for every inch of it so it's your
[1:09:48] line yes but are you gonna fight for it
[1:09:51] do you get what I'm saying it is your
[1:09:53] land but you have to fight for it and
[1:09:55] people have got relaxed and comfortable
[1:09:58] in the message just waiting for things
[1:10:00] to come their way
[1:10:02] but Jesus overcame by the world or glory
[1:10:05] arisen with a spirit but you had to
[1:10:07] overcome by the world or glory to God it
[1:10:09] is written it is written it is written
[1:10:11] by the word Oh hallelujah believer
[1:10:15] thank you Lord Jesus now what are you
[1:10:18] overcoming the overcome by your word let
[1:10:21] me say this again God made a promise God
[1:10:23] made a promise you've got to have a
[1:10:25] battle if everything comes lazy
[1:10:28] what are you overcoming so if everything
[1:10:31] going on you whatever you want like a
[1:10:32] spoiled child you want this your cry
[1:10:35] fake God give it to you God give it to
[1:10:36] you God give it to you everything is
[1:10:38] just fine you're blessed without stress
[1:10:40] and you know people have those small
[1:10:41] quotations and so on
[1:10:43] but that's not what we are promised here
[1:10:44] now it will go tell Joshua every place
[1:10:46] you put your foot is yours the land is
[1:10:49] yours but you're gonna fight fair
[1:10:51] he'll miss yours deliverance is yours
[1:10:53] victory is yours
[1:10:55] joy is yours reach it that's yours too
[1:10:58] Oh hallelujah holy wars overcoming power
[1:11:01] that's yours too
[1:11:02] everything God promising about that's
[1:11:04] yours but you're gonna fight for it are
[1:11:07] you gonna fight for it this morning I
[1:11:08] wanna a salute you this morning I didn't
[1:11:10] even know that they say there will be
[1:11:12] terrible weather today and you did you
[1:11:14] didn't bother with that
[1:11:15] and it look like what cancel the
[1:11:17] terrible weather because you got fit to
[1:11:20] come here bad weather
[1:11:22] praise God but you have yet to come this
[1:11:24] morning you didn't bother with the
[1:11:26] weather because you were bidden about
[1:11:28] your deliverance than what the waiter at
[1:11:29] the scene and go up a roll-back storm
[1:11:31] weather rain Go Go push all that back
[1:11:34] because he won't you get a breakthrough
[1:11:36] that's why you were here this morning
[1:11:37] and if you come for a bridge Sugamo give
[1:11:40] you a breakthrough Oh what is that a man
[1:11:42] I would like you wouldn't lie praise God
[1:11:44] and bring your son Lord or glory to God
[1:11:47] he bring you for deliverance he bring
[1:11:49] you for a breakthrough we believe that
[1:11:51] so the overcame by the Word of God and
[1:11:54] that by the testimony and by the blood
[1:11:56] of Christ you've got to overcome
[1:11:58] something so you have got to have some
[1:12:00] obstacles when I hear a shout on that
[1:12:04] one you've got to have some obstacles
[1:12:06] some sickness here some pain here as the
[1:12:10] obstacle go don't want to be like that
[1:12:11] forget yourself gone well and you're
[1:12:14] sitting about you go I want you to be
[1:12:15] healed
[1:12:16] I want your brush man be good help
[1:12:18] listen God desire is that you have good
[1:12:20] out was analyze I a second a second a
[1:12:23] second a second forget that you have to
[1:12:26] be healed
[1:12:26] that's what Jesus came for all glory to
[1:12:30] God to open up the prison bars they set
[1:12:33] up keep Liberty them that a bog the heal
[1:12:35] the brokenhearted or glory no God set
[1:12:39] you Liberty listen when you captive from
[1:12:41] physical and spiritual conditions let me
[1:12:45] see them again to bring a deliverance
[1:12:48] from spiritual and physical condition
[1:12:51] because I have demons in the physical
[1:12:53] and demons in the spiritual the physical
[1:12:56] is sickness or glory to God the
[1:12:58] spiritual is demonic
[1:13:00] and the lives of individuals but he
[1:13:03] promised the free from all attacked
[1:13:04] physical and spiritual or and who Yuma
[1:13:08] the son of man set free it's free indeed
[1:13:12] could begin the law some princes this
[1:13:13] morning Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:13:16] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[1:13:20] so before Jesus returned in power to
[1:13:25] read this scripture he had to overcome
[1:13:28] by the word the lust of the eyes the
[1:13:31] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:13:34] I'm talking about dry wood or glory to
[1:13:41] God because Jesus was led by the spirit
[1:13:42] into the wilderness to be tested and he
[1:13:46] told that devil it is written it is
[1:13:48] written it is also written he never
[1:13:52] demonstrated power to Lucifer he never
[1:13:55] demonstrated power to the enemy he
[1:13:58] overcome by the world there's an
[1:14:00] overcoming by the world where you take
[1:14:02] the word and let the devil know where to
[1:14:04] get off when you take the word and said
[1:14:07] I'm not going to back down and moved on
[1:14:09] from what God said because the world
[1:14:11] itself is God and the word of power and
[1:14:14] it never don't believe that but the word
[1:14:16] of power that's right Jesus said
[1:14:19] destroyed this body and it treated a lot
[1:14:22] a wizard of myself because he knew what
[1:14:24] David said he knew David spoke the word
[1:14:27] I will not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:14:29] corruption or glory the dog be believer
[1:14:34] so Jesus after overcoming these three
[1:14:37] attacks lust of the eyes lust of the
[1:14:41] flesh and pride of life he was ready to
[1:14:43] go into the temple and he found the
[1:14:45] place where it was written and he read
[1:14:47] the scripture from Isaiah 61 but in the
[1:14:50] middle of that sentence he stopped he
[1:14:52] only stopped after the acceptable year
[1:14:54] of the Lord and he left off the day of
[1:14:56] vengeance of our God he left off the
[1:15:00] judgment part because that judgment part
[1:15:03] is for now
[1:15:05] that just meant part is for the bride to
[1:15:07] pick up and God will not hide from the
[1:15:10] brain what he's about to do free is gone
[1:15:15] if you have new it Wednesday night
[1:15:16] service you need to go on YouTube and go
[1:15:18] in the channel and listen to that
[1:15:19] service lot and his wife and I trust the
[1:15:22] Lord but I said could bring back some of
[1:15:23] that this morning but luck was boss God
[1:15:26] was about leaving and and he said shall
[1:15:29] I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do
[1:15:32] Sodom is already judged hallelujah
[1:15:35] judgment is coming and and lot had this
[1:15:37] burden Abram at his building for his
[1:15:39] family who was done in Sodom and he
[1:15:42] began to plead with God if there's fifty
[1:15:45] righteous would you destroy God said no
[1:15:48] and he's plea and plea until court
[1:15:51] dispatch angels to get the family out
[1:15:54] some mocked some make fun out of it but
[1:15:58] there were a few that came out all glory
[1:16:01] to God there's somebody to come out
[1:16:03] before the judgment strike it has to be
[1:16:07] a voice to say come leave what you're
[1:16:11] doing and come and just don't look back
[1:16:14] what opportunity there was two teas on
[1:16:17] the cross or glory to God two recipes on
[1:16:21] the cross to Big Time Bandits on the
[1:16:23] cross one say why you say this haven't
[1:16:26] seen us also another one say Lord
[1:16:28] remember me he said the right thing and
[1:16:32] Jesus said today you will be with me he
[1:16:35] did another get baptized in Jesus name
[1:16:37] he didn't have to come to church he
[1:16:39] didn't have to stay long and I'll
[1:16:40] fellowship with the Saints jesus said
[1:16:43] today you will be with me in paradise
[1:16:47] God made a provision for that man a
[1:16:50] final hour reprieve final voice of mercy
[1:16:54] Oh God mercy that was great
[1:16:58] and Chris was free pardon there was
[1:17:01] multiplied for me there my burdened soul
[1:17:04] found Liberty at Calvary or get the Lord
[1:17:09] a show
[1:17:10] you talk about the grace of God you talk
[1:17:13] about the mercies of God you I want to
[1:17:16] be delivered this morning by the grace
[1:17:18] and the mercies of God Oh hallelujah
[1:17:22] glory to God hallelujah praise God he is
[1:17:27] making a bride hallelujah
[1:17:31] he is cutting you up now cut you down to
[1:17:36] his word only gotten all the kree's and
[1:17:39] dogmas and everything away from you
[1:17:40] trying to get back a bride for the son
[1:17:43] another masterpiece part of the word
[1:17:47] Jesus couldn't take the place you
[1:17:49] remember when they read that in the day
[1:17:52] in the book he read just part of the
[1:17:53] prophecy he left the rest of it for the
[1:17:56] last day we are supposed to take that
[1:17:59] part you see he was cut and God wants to
[1:18:02] cut the church out well he cut the son
[1:18:05] out like he did the bride and the groom

[1:32:42] hallelujah whispers look at the dead I
[1:32:44] don't care all there nobody look at it

[1:32:49] nobody don't anybody wanna live and you
[1:32:52] have a right to want to live yes and I
[1:32:55] thought that you might have life let's

[1:33:04] [Applause]
[1:33:11] [Music]
[1:33:12] this is it hallelujah
[1:33:18] so when man fell blood of bulls and
[1:33:21] goats was accepted as a substitute but
[1:33:23] then God is waiting for the lamb to come
[1:33:26] because only one blood was not truly
[1:33:28] accepted which is the blood of Jesus
[1:33:30] Christ which is the blood of God was
[1:33:33] enough blood of a man was not Jewish
[1:33:35] blood is real like blood was the blood
[1:33:37] of God that's why you're foolish enough
[1:33:39] to conceive so what God put egg and
[1:33:41] sperm to produce the body called Jesus
[1:33:43] so when he died was the blood of God and
[1:33:46] the blood released the spirit life but
[1:33:48] that blood was the answer the same
[1:33:50] question because the devil could hold us
[1:33:52] captive as long as we covered with sin
[1:33:55] but the blood was the answer the same
[1:33:57] question because it has to be dealt with
[1:33:59] say not to be judged and the penalty of
[1:34:02] sin was death so death was required
[1:34:05] anybody to compare kinsman-redeemer have
[1:34:08] to pay the price of debt and give me a
[1:34:10] kiss my redeemer you have to be willing
[1:34:12] you have to be rich you have to be
[1:34:14] connected with man so jesus met the
[1:34:16] qualification to be the kinsman redeemer
[1:34:19] he was willing he was rich he was
[1:34:23] connected to us as a man because no
[1:34:26] angel could redeem us a man had to
[1:34:28] redeem us a what every man a worthy
[1:34:31] kinsman so when he stepped forward to
[1:34:34] take the book when he stepped forward
[1:34:36] the die on the cross was the answer the
[1:34:39] same question once and for all or give
[1:34:43] the Lord a show you may be seated this
[1:34:50] same question was answered 24/7 illa it
[1:34:55] was not temporary and Sayla this was an
[1:34:58] answer to sin 24/7 I die for them see it
[1:35:05] and say they did this he did this she
[1:35:07] did this but I died with my blood is
[1:35:10] almond like if you pay in advance so it
[1:35:14] have a cost look at here blood blood
[1:35:16] blood blood
[1:35:18] seven ages seven cups of blood
[1:35:22] and mercy seats Oh Gloria v8 the blood
[1:35:26] speaking on behalf
[1:35:27] Oh God we are only here this morning
[1:35:35] because of blood not because we put
[1:35:38] because of blood not because we tried to
[1:35:40] do better but because of blood there is
[1:35:46] none righteous none none none no not one
[1:35:52] no Pope righteous no pastor I just know
[1:35:55] this man righteous is one righteous that
[1:35:57] is Jesus Christ and when his blood apply
[1:36:00] to your heart to your mind to your
[1:36:02] spirit and your spirit hallelujah we see
[1:36:04] the spirit then you are covered by the
[1:36:07] blood and you God doesn't see you he

[1:36:13] voice you see the voice of the blood
[1:36:15] speaking on your behalf he sees you

[1:38:23] Old Testament to lead the chance to
[1:38:26] bring man back to his rightful
[1:38:28] possession all glory to God I want you
[1:38:32] to get that not leave the church lead
[1:38:35] you to the your rightful possession Oh
[1:38:40] do you believe that oh praise the name
[1:38:43] of the Lord so he breaks the seals and
[1:38:45] reveals
[1:38:46] his inheritance to his people he gives
[1:38:49] the inheritance that inherited become
[1:38:51] Anakin's my redeemer he freely give it
[1:38:53] out to us it belonged to him he is the
[1:38:57] one who redeemed but instead of keeping
[1:38:59] it for himself
[1:39:00] he gives it back to it the people that's
[1:39:02] just love for us he took the book isn't
[1:39:05] that right he took the book and what
[1:39:07] happened he came down and give it to the
[1:39:09] Prophet and any Indians they go and take
[1:39:11] the book and eat the book a book that he
[1:39:13] couldn't look upon a book that he
[1:39:14] couldn't touch no you could eat the book
[1:39:16] that book belongs to us it's the book of
[1:39:19] God it's the book of prophecy so we
[1:39:22] could receive that book and take that
[1:39:23] book and prophesy your deliverance this
[1:39:25] morning and the court is here to enforce
[1:39:28] that would have prophecy over your life
[1:39:30] a complete even what the doctors give up
[1:39:33] on you
[1:39:33] Oh glory to God don't you give up on
[1:39:35] yourself now don't you give up on God
[1:39:37] don't do that now
[1:39:38] Oh glory to God doctor get 24 hours to
[1:39:42] live don't you give up or believe God
[1:39:44] anyhow he could heal you he could redeem
[1:39:47] you even deliver you glory to God
[1:39:51] so Satan is this squatter but he throw
[1:39:54] one to give it up right quick say Tonya
[1:40:00] all the time do you think I'll just give
[1:40:01] you up just after sphere say take your
[1:40:05] people and go and they're going out well
[1:40:07] firstly don't think it over he said god
[1:40:09] what a modern nations will think about
[1:40:11] me this God that I don't know deliver
[1:40:14] these people out of my hands he can tell
[1:40:17] you mission more the plagues that he
[1:40:18] frogs on he flies that you get in on all
[1:40:20] he mentions in people even out Oh God
[1:40:22] like he lost sheep oh I like it so cool
[1:40:26] it looked like the big fear of Egypt
[1:40:29] which was the supreme power that time
[1:40:30] you get overthrown if you can handle
[1:40:32] that he said let me go back after them
[1:40:37] so anytime you see freedom come in that
[1:40:40] develop think over you know because
[1:40:41] after you get licks like that you have
[1:40:43] to let you go but when he think it over
[1:40:46] how eagle look I hadn't kept it for so
[1:40:49] long
[1:40:50] then he coming back after your
[1:40:53] to prove and show you delivered and you
[1:40:56] will stay deliver you're gonna accept
[1:40:58] deliverance and tell that Devils not
[1:41:01] anymore
[1:41:01] you had met before but not now not
[1:41:04] anymore
[1:41:05] I am free I am free I am free
[1:41:10] all glory to God but a venom he said
[1:41:15] early season as a squatter he don't
[1:41:17] legally own this he had two thousand
[1:41:20] against the fuss whether you want it or
[1:41:21] not but somebody else own it Christ came
[1:41:24] as a kinsman redeemer and redeem it back
[1:41:27] to us but Satan Satan possessed it and
[1:41:30] you know after a while this great
[1:41:31] Fighting's over he be cast into a lake
[1:41:33] of fire and he done away with on those
[1:41:36] who worship with him a man lost his
[1:41:39] inheritance a squatter common his land
[1:41:41] he could not hold it longer than fifty
[1:41:44] years and after fifty years there comes
[1:41:47] a to believe so when you see your gone
[1:41:50] in poverty and your lost this and he
[1:41:51] lost that somebody could only hold your
[1:41:53] land and Bible is haunted law only for
[1:41:56] 50 years and after 50 years they have to
[1:41:58] walk out they have to give up

[1:57:35] cope with it okay the Lord a shout when
[1:57:50] you begin to see the day of Jubilee aha
[1:57:53] so you're given a fine tune but
[1:57:55] occurrence of this Jubilee you know when
[1:57:58] you begin to see the of Jubilee where we
[1:58:02] don't have to fuss and strain and pull
[1:58:04] like this so they of Jubilee no fussing
[1:58:11] no straining no pulling you're walking
[1:58:15] and your worship then you walk in your
[1:58:17] atmosphere you're walking and the
[1:58:20] heaviness around you because heaven
[1:58:23] consists of the word and the word is in
[1:58:24] you where is our unhappiness around you
[1:58:28] they walk into your house and demons
[1:58:30] scattering before you reach the door
[1:58:34] you're visiting your family and as you
[1:58:37] open the door so demon status Kempe
[1:58:40] because an anointing son a jubilee son
[1:58:46] redeemer son you're coming to redeem
[1:58:49] your fallen family oh you're coming like
[1:58:52] a mini Jesus like a small Messiah but a
[1:58:56] round ball of the Messiah at I'm anyone
[1:58:58] a small version of the one the big one
[1:59:01] when you walk in the Spirit of God is
[1:59:04] upon me for he has anointed me your
[1:59:08] family sit in bed but you know you're
[1:59:10] coming to pray for them you're noting
[1:59:13] all over you the anointing upon your
[1:59:15] hands the feet inside your heart or
[1:59:18] chlorine are when their lands upon them
[1:59:20] so you know it's more than the SEC
[1:59:22] pineal universe all will be delivered
[1:59:26] or give the Lord some praise as people
[1:59:28] hallelujah
[1:59:30] when you see this begin to hear you have
[1:59:32] Jubilee where you don't have to fuss and
[1:59:34] strain and pull like this but we already
[1:59:36] secured in Christ Seton can't hold you
[1:59:42] amen this'll depth our Gentile workers
[1:59:45] because God is releasing his spirit by
[1:59:48] His grace Gideon wants some reason come
[1:59:51] here I want to switch but I wanna share
[1:59:54] something with you but listen this
[1:59:55] Barham Roberto deliverance he said I
[1:59:58] heard but I never learned I'm just
[1:59:59] warning back there can I come to my mind
[2:00:01] the people I see really gettin away from
[2:00:03] deliverance it seems to be something
[2:00:05] that the people seem so they push it to
[2:00:07] the other side where God can't do it but
[2:00:09] that's not the attitude Moses when he
[2:00:12] was called by God he was total complete
[2:00:14] prophet when God sends a man to do
[2:00:17] anything
[2:00:17] he completely equip him and puts what he
[2:00:20] has needed of if go across want to be a
[2:00:22] preacher he puts in something to preach
[2:00:30] and that's what he's done he sent Moses
[2:00:32] to Egypt and equipped him just like you
[2:00:35] if you're Christian go don't make half a
[2:00:37] Christians God make complete Christians
[2:00:39] go to make half were preachers but we
[2:00:41] just can't be half free and Gordon makes
[2:00:43] his children Christian but sometime
[2:00:44] they're half a Christians it's not quads
[2:00:46] intention for them to be that way is
[2:00:48] there always that got mixed up with the
[2:00:50] plan of God for their life and that's
[2:00:52] what makes them that we go to make off
[2:00:54] we're preachers or halfway Christians
[2:00:56] but he said more they was completely
[2:00:58] surrendered into the hands of God and
[2:01:00] that's the reason God could completely
[2:01:02] trust him
[2:01:02] I wonder this morning as Christians if
[2:01:05] we have either our own will
[2:01:06] here ourselves so completely to God to
[2:01:08] go can trust us to a place that put us
[2:01:11] I won this morning myself if I could be
[2:01:13] solely with the God till God could trust
[2:01:15] me could trust but I never could trust
[2:01:17] the trustee board Deacon board the
[2:01:19] minister has got a place the duty to
[2:01:22] preach the gospel and a member of the
[2:01:24] church if he's got to be a member of
[2:01:25] this certain group he should not
[2:01:27] compromise if the Church believes that
[2:01:28] we should not gamble that member should
[2:01:30] never touch a deck of cards if we
[2:01:32] believe in drinking he should turn his
[2:01:33] head completely from drinking if we
[2:01:35] believe not believin Gamlen or smokin
[2:01:37] not supposed to be in that at all and if
[2:01:40] we've completely deliver ourselves into
[2:01:41] his hand then one can live in us Christ
[2:01:43] hope of glory he can reflect himself
[2:01:46] from us and we get ourselves out of the
[2:01:47] way then our tours of his thoughts could
[2:01:50] imagine Christ smoking a cigar
[2:01:51] could you imagine Christ painted cards
[2:01:53] if then if your spirit is part of his
[2:01:55] spirit he wants it to be upon your
[2:01:57] confession and you permit the devil come
[2:01:59] in and take over if our hearts condemn
[2:02:01] us we want complete deliverance we don't
[2:02:04] want a halfway Church we want to be a
[2:02:05] real Church on nutrition at all we want
[2:02:08] to be real Christians or no questions at
[2:02:10] all we want to deliver on some of our
[2:02:12] habits from our sins for more evil
[2:02:14] thinking for more evil doing from our
[2:02:16] negligence whatever we have done we want
[2:02:19] a torta deliverance so when people come
[2:02:21] into this church to be prayed for
[2:02:22] there'll be little group this little
[2:02:24] group maybe not over 100 or to sit in
[2:02:26] here they'll be completely in the hands
[2:02:27] of God and when when you're unified
[2:02:30] praise God in our hearts together with
[2:02:31] brotherly love or bear the office of the
[2:02:33] church and the pastor the pastor obey
[2:02:35] God then go and work to the pastor to
[2:02:37] the board go into the church and we all
[2:02:39] together one unit for the kingdom of God
[2:02:41] and Pharaoh Pharaoh Moses you can go but
[2:02:44] leave your children behind that's the
[2:02:46] way the devil wants a Christian to come
[2:02:47] he'll be all right for you to join a
[2:02:49] church but don't ever forgive Jones
[2:02:50] maybe all right you don't have to give
[2:02:53] up your smoking or drinking online or
[2:02:54] stealin your fault fine and backbiting
[2:02:56] you rather given up just join the church
[2:02:58] but Moses wasn't compromise'
[2:03:00] he wanted a complete deliverance he said
[2:03:02] we will not leave one hoof behind we
[2:03:05] will take everything that belongs to us
[2:03:06] then we go to worship God we will take
[2:03:09] righteousness we will take holiness we
[2:03:10] will take purity where it took all what
[2:03:12] God required that's when one night when
[2:03:15] God ordained that lamb shall be killed
[2:03:16] type of Christ and the blood was dipped
[2:03:18] and he said when I see the blood you had
[2:03:20] to put it doorpost on the doorpost you
[2:03:22] have to put the blood on a place where
[2:03:23] it might be displayed you cannot be a
[2:03:25] private believer you cannot be a private
[2:03:27] Christian Christians is a public thing
[2:03:29] it has to have the blood displayed upon
[2:03:31] your chest upon your heart upon your
[2:03:33] life and when the church shall be
[2:03:34] completely delivered when everything is
[2:03:37] brought under the blood when your sins
[2:03:39] come under the blood when you're smoking
[2:03:41] you're gambling you're cheatin when
[2:03:43] you're stealing your line when
[2:03:45] everything is brought under the blood
[2:03:46] there'll be a total of runs if you are
[2:03:48] wrong somebody make it right you can't
[2:03:50] bring that under the blood it won't
[2:03:52] steer you can bring it something won't
[2:03:53] let you do it
[2:03:54] when yourself is completely totally
[2:03:56] brought on the blood there'll be a total
[2:03:58] deliverance and you'll have a freedom
[2:04:00] here we go you'll have a freedom like
[2:04:02] you have never known before when
[2:04:04] everything is brought under the blood
[2:04:06] brought in submissive to the kingdom of
[2:04:08] God there'll be a real deliverance and
[2:04:12] then he was saying pray in the air God
[2:04:13] you don't think you don't take things
[2:04:15] unless it's to to delivered you cannot
[2:04:18] receive a sacrifice a blemish on it you
[2:04:21] will never receive a prayer with sin
[2:04:22] back in the life of that person you
[2:04:24] could not do it Lord you didn't do it in
[2:04:26] the ages gone by you can't do it but the

[2:11:57] me from running over a little girl last
[2:12:00] night who ran behind my cars I was a
[2:12:03] boater reverse out of a parking space at
[2:12:05] a supermarket something made me freeze
[2:12:08] as I was about to press the gas pedal a
[2:12:10] few seconds after that I saw a little
[2:12:13] girl run from behind my vehicle
[2:12:15] she had bolted from her father who was
[2:12:17] in as much shock as I was I know that it
[2:12:19] was the Lord the angel of the Lord in

[2:12:49] complications and constant infections
[2:12:52] but doctors in the USA where she lives
[2:12:56] wanted to do a fitted surgery she has
[2:12:58] refused because she believes that God

[2:13:03] fever and swelling all of our body due
[2:13:05] to the infections he's a friend brother
[2:13:07] Mike Blackmon sister Janice god bless

[2:13:32] and he's acting the Lord will heal him
[2:13:34] and make him completely whole and if
[2:13:36] there's any other request
[2:13:37] I know we have the prayer line but but
[2:13:40] if Adam said we could sing too much we
[2:13:42] could dance too much but we could never

[2:14:56] father God may you touch your people
[2:14:59] touch me and me you bless the world and
[2:15:01] a reading of it on the opening of our
[2:15:03] understand into your scriptures Lord for
[2:15:05] the next few moments in the precious
[2:15:07] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[2:15:09] Amen an email just want to read one
[2:15:12] portion of scripture before we get ready
[2:15:15] for the prayer line scene Luke 17 and
[2:15:17] verse 26 this scripture and this subject
[2:15:21] has been burning in my heart for a few
[2:15:24] weeks now I can't shake it so I know
[2:15:26] there's something in there for us this
[2:15:28] morning
[2:15:28] see in Luke 17 and verse 26 and as it
[2:15:32] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[2:15:35] also in the days of the Son of man they
[2:15:38] did eat they drank they married wives
[2:15:40] they were given in marriage until the
[2:15:43] day that Noah and
[2:15:44] into the Ark and the flood came and
[2:15:46] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[2:15:50] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[2:15:52] drank they bought they sold they planted
[2:15:54] they builded but the same day that lot
[2:15:57] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[2:15:59] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[2:16:02] all
[2:16:03] even thus in other words so shall it be
[2:16:06] shall it be in the day when the Son of
[2:16:08] Man is revealed in that day he which
[2:16:11] shall be upon the housetop and his stuff
[2:16:14] in the house let him not come down to
[2:16:16] take it away and he that is in the field
[2:16:19] let him likewise not return back
[2:16:22] remember Lot's wife me the Lord had a
[2:16:26] blessing to the reading of his word you
[2:16:28] may be seated in the presence of the
[2:16:30] Lord this morning and I feel like we are
[2:16:32] in a hospital room this morning
[2:16:35] I don't know how recently my wife had to
[2:16:38] visit a doctor and she went early 5:30
[2:16:41] 6:00 in the morning around 8 o'clock I
[2:16:43] checked in she said she's still waiting
[2:16:45] nine o'clock checked in she's still
[2:16:47] waiting 9:30 is checked in she's still
[2:16:49] waiting because when you go by the
[2:16:51] doctor you can tell the doctor right now
[2:16:53] right now the doctor some time comes
[2:16:55] when he's ready to come he knows the
[2:16:57] different matters he has to deal with
[2:16:58] and when we come into the house of the
[2:17:01] Lord it's a hospital room Jesus when he
[2:17:04] was a said he that are well have no need
[2:17:07] of a physician but he came as the great
[2:17:09] physician so he is in the building this
[2:17:12] morning to deal with different
[2:17:13] situations a deal with different
[2:17:15] conditions and he is a deliverer but for
[2:17:18] the deliverer to operate he has to be
[2:17:21] activated because God is very clear in
[2:17:24] his laws with jurisdiction he is God of
[2:17:26] heaven and he gave Dominion to man on
[2:17:28] the earth so when we pray what we
[2:17:31] actually do is open the door to allow
[2:17:33] God to move it's reason God has to find
[2:17:36] somebody to operate true because if it
[2:17:39] was not that principle he would operate
[2:17:41] without humans and then we would
[2:17:42] understand God in that context so that's
[2:17:44] why he would use prophets and he become
[2:17:46] his mouthpiece because when God came
[2:17:48] down and spoke is they let Moses speak
[2:17:51] because when you speak we can deal with
[2:17:53] it so God always uses
[2:17:55] and he always uses prayers access into
[2:17:57] this realm and into this jurisdiction
[2:17:59] you believe that this morning so we are
[2:18:01] here this morning for a special
[2:18:02] deliverance service because man needs to
[2:18:05] be delivered and that deliverance and
[2:18:08] the need for deliverance needs back to
[2:18:10] Genesis when man fell from his condition
[2:18:12] he fell from his position he fell from
[2:18:14] where God left him and when God asks a
[2:18:17] question Adam where doubt he was not
[2:18:19] asking for his physical location he was
[2:18:21] asking about his spiritual condition God
[2:18:24] knows exactly where you are physically
[2:18:26] he knows that but his question animals
[2:18:28] where are you because I left you in a
[2:18:30] certain position as a believer I left
[2:18:32] you in a position of authority but you
[2:18:34] are no longer there what happened what
[2:18:36] went wrong and it was that Adam had
[2:18:38] disobeyed an instruction that God gave
[2:18:40] to him and that disobedience as whether
[2:18:43] Branham said drinking smoking
[2:18:44] fornication adultery carousing
[2:18:46] pornography whatever it is that's not
[2:18:49] sin that is the attributes or the
[2:18:51] behaviors that come out of sin sinners
[2:18:53] unbelief and if you really believe God
[2:18:57] it'll make you behave a certain way if
[2:18:59] you really be leave God it'll make you
[2:19:00] act a certain way if you really believe
[2:19:02] God it'll make you do things that are
[2:19:04] contrary to your training if you believe
[2:19:06] God it'll make you do things that are
[2:19:08] contrary to me what your parents said to
[2:19:10] you if you believe God it'll make you go
[2:19:12] against what your teacher told you
[2:19:14] because when you hear from God God
[2:19:16] speaks in a way to us that doesn't make
[2:19:18] sense all the time and it's not supposed
[2:19:21] to make sense because the Bible said my
[2:19:22] thoughts are higher and your thoughts
[2:19:24] the fact that his thoughts are higher
[2:19:25] than our thoughts means it doesn't have
[2:19:27] to make sense to us all the time but he
[2:19:29] promised to reveal certain things to us
[2:19:31] and those things which I reveal they can
[2:19:33] now belong to us because it's within our
[2:19:35] comprehension outside of that we have to
[2:19:38] trust God for the journey that he takes
[2:19:40] us true to bring us to perfection the
[2:19:42] journey that he takes us true to bring
[2:19:44] us to a realization
[2:19:46] so the trials and the ups and the downs
[2:19:48] and word of it is speaking about you may
[2:19:50] have been smoking drinking whatever it
[2:19:51] was in the past the journeys that we
[2:19:53] have gone through to be here this
[2:19:55] morning there is no accident in it there
[2:19:58] is no mistake in it because god I see
[2:20:02] this all the time it's either quarters
[2:20:03] in control or he's not in control he
[2:20:05] can't be
[2:20:06] in the middle somewhere it is either
[2:20:09] quarters in the controller Gordon's
[2:20:11] nothing control if God is in control
[2:20:14] it means he's in control of where you
[2:20:15] are today he's in control of the job you
[2:20:18] have he's in control of the house you
[2:20:20] live in him whether you like you know
[2:20:21] you don't like it you have to accept the
[2:20:23] fact that he's in control if he's
[2:20:25] nothing controlling that's a whole
[2:20:27] different story
[2:20:27] but I believe he's in control because he
[2:20:30] is omnipotent he is omniscient he is
[2:20:32] all-powerful there's nothing he cannot
[2:20:34] do this nothing he cannot fix he could
[2:20:37] move governments he did it when Jesus
[2:20:39] had to be born he could produce money he
[2:20:41] put calling the fish on when the fish
[2:20:43] they founded there is no situation that
[2:20:45] he's not capable of able to and has the
[2:20:49] ability to change the twist to turn so
[2:20:51] we have no excuse this morning but to
[2:20:54] give God worship and to give God praise
[2:20:58] and to give Him fans in the midst of the
[2:21:01] trial that he and his wisdom carefully
[2:21:04] sat down enough for us for our benefit
[2:21:07] our trials of our benefit our problems
[2:21:11] of our benefit our failures of our
[2:21:13] benefit because he promised to work it
[2:21:16] out can the church seaman but the pranam
[2:21:19] said missing limbs will be restored can
[2:21:22] I have a volunteer this morning to have
[2:21:24] your limb removed so we can restore it
[2:21:26] nobody wants to volunteer to be blind
[2:21:29] what blind eyes have to be open them
[2:21:31] nobody wants to volunteer to be deaf but
[2:21:34] the death is up to here so Gordon is
[2:21:37] wisdom allowed things to happen to you I
[2:21:39] love things that happen to your family
[2:21:41] and like jover you could stand there and
[2:21:44] see to the skin worm destroy my body yet
[2:21:47] in my flesh I will see God nothing could
[2:21:53] happen to you nothing could happen to
[2:21:55] your family unless God allows it to
[2:21:57] happen and if you're loaded to happen
[2:22:00] it's a greater purpose behind this and
[2:22:02] we have to accept that and that gives us
[2:22:05] a reason of thank God that in the midst
[2:22:08] of the Lord gives the Lord taketh away
[2:22:10] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:22:13] can the church semen hallelujah
[2:22:18] hallelujah so ever thought this morning
[2:22:21] for a few minutes you already have the
[2:22:23] message but I have to get this out I'm
[2:22:25] pregnant with this this morning don't
[2:22:27] look back don't look back that's the
[2:22:30] title this morning don't look back
[2:22:33] if you came here this morning don't look
[2:22:35] back if you want to walk with God don't
[2:22:37] look back we sing the song when we get
[2:22:40] baptized I have decided to follow Jesus
[2:22:42] no turning back no turning back
[2:22:45] so I want to remind the church this
[2:22:47] morning about don't look back don't look
[2:22:50] back to you always don't look back to
[2:22:53] your old friends don't look back to
[2:22:55] where God took you from even pizza
[2:22:57] before he got the Holy Ghost when Jesus
[2:23:00] died he looked back not only did he look
[2:23:02] back he went right back to his former
[2:23:04] employment that Jesus pulled him from
[2:23:06] God didn't pull him from fishing for him
[2:23:09] to go back fishing but when he lost
[2:23:11] something
[2:23:12] he went back to where he was before and
[2:23:15] for somebody to be back slidden
[2:23:17] it means they are not where they will
[2:23:19] pull the - they went back to where they
[2:23:21] were before because if God pulled you
[2:23:23] out of something and you stay out of
[2:23:26] that something then you cannot be black
[2:23:28] Satan but the reason we have deliverance
[2:23:30] services is because somebody steps back
[2:23:33] from where God please them and their
[2:23:35] different reasons why we step back the
[2:23:37] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[2:23:39] the pride of life the cares of life our
[2:23:42] jobs our families conflicts marital
[2:23:45] problems financial problems all of these
[2:23:48] things are designed and they come at us
[2:23:50] and we have a choice to make every day
[2:23:53] we have a choice - I stand my ground do
[2:23:56] I go back
[2:23:57] do I go forward and for anybody who
[2:24:00] found themselves stepping back it's
[2:24:02] because you decided nobody forced you to
[2:24:04] do it you decided to not breathe you
[2:24:07] decided to not come to church you
[2:24:09] decided to talk to your friend before
[2:24:12] talking to God what's riding is not an
[2:24:16] immediate opening
[2:24:17] it is a process it is a slow process
[2:24:21] it's a slow process of losing your joy
[2:24:24] it's a slow process of losing your feet
[2:24:27] it's a slow process but tangled and
[2:24:34] restoration does not to be a slow
[2:24:35] process
[2:24:36] thank Lord that when Jesus was at that
[2:24:39] wedding and they ran out of wine he said
[2:24:42] bring some water and by the pranam shed
[2:24:45] that Jesus bypassed the picking of the
[2:24:47] grapes
[2:24:47] Jesus bypass the fermenting of the
[2:24:50] grapes Jesus bypass all of that and in
[2:24:54] as they were pouring he said how they
[2:24:56] keep this wine for last the best wine
[2:24:59] Jesus not just turn the water into wine
[2:25:01] he is the one because the quality of
[2:25:05] wine is aged so it means that God my
[2:25:08] past time to restore what they needed so
[2:25:11] I don't care how long you've been back
[2:25:12] sit in this morning God to restore your
[2:25:15] family he can restore your house he can
[2:25:17] restore your health he can restore your
[2:25:19] children I'm not just clutter he wants
[2:25:22] to he wants to restore your children he
[2:25:25] wants to restore your joy not just once
[2:25:28] - he will restore your children he will
[2:25:31] restore not just will he must restore he
[2:25:34] a stirry straw is obligated to restore
[2:25:38] he can't help himself his heart is
[2:25:41] beating fastest morning because somebody
[2:25:44] is crying out to him it doesn't mean
[2:25:46] that have to be your voice you may be
[2:25:52] seated for a few minutes there's a cry
[2:25:55] from within that you can't even put into
[2:25:57] words the ceiling ups cries out the seed
[2:26:01] in your soul cries out because the word
[2:26:03] is the believer you are not even a
[2:26:05] believer but the word and you is crying
[2:26:08] out for something you try to drown the
[2:26:10] cry with alcohol you try to drown the
[2:26:12] prior with your world problems but that
[2:26:14] cry is still here and he is able to
[2:26:17] small him to answer the cry
[2:26:19] he's evil this morning to break the
[2:26:21] chains that I've held you have held you
[2:26:23] all these years
[2:26:24] some people in church and chained up
[2:26:26] people out to church and chained up
[2:26:29] but this morning
[2:26:30] don't look back the Egyptians you see
[2:26:32] today you will see them no more forever
[2:26:34] today's a new day it's a new season it's
[2:26:38] a new our God Himself has come down you
[2:26:41] may be seated
[2:26:44] can I talk to you a little bit it's
[2:26:51] interesting that out of every age that
[2:26:56] God compared the M - he didn't compare
[2:26:58] to the age of Moses or the golden age of
[2:27:01] David or the great prophetic age of
[2:27:03] Elijah you see as it was in the days of
[2:27:05] Noah as it was and it is of lot those
[2:27:09] are the ages those are the eras the
[2:27:11] times the dispensations the epochs that
[2:27:14] he compares our day to and he brought
[2:27:16] the similarities and he sat on a church
[2:27:19] they builded they planted they married
[2:27:22] they had wives and he brought the
[2:27:24] similarities of what it was which was
[2:27:26] normal living people want to get married
[2:27:29] they want to build a house they want to
[2:27:31] go to work they want to have a job they
[2:27:33] want to get a nice car they want to
[2:27:35] survive they want to be see if these are
[2:27:36] natural things and Jesus is painting the
[2:27:42] picture that the issue for many people
[2:27:44] is not even the spiritual because the
[2:27:46] natural does impact the spirit the cares
[2:27:51] of this life is what leads to the decay
[2:27:54] in the spiritual realm and that is why
[2:27:57] we have to remember Lot's wife and I
[2:28:00] said on Wednesday night you can't talk
[2:28:02] about Lot's wife we don't know her name
[2:28:03] we don't know how old she was dude we
[2:28:04] don't know at all how we don't know her
[2:28:07] identification is luck Lot's wife that's
[2:28:09] how she's known to us
[2:28:10] that's all we know about her in terms of
[2:28:13] describing her but we know her behavior
[2:28:15] we know what happened to her and when we
[2:28:17] go back to Genesis we can talk about
[2:28:19] Lot's wife unless we talk about a lot
[2:28:21] and lot is of no mention if it's not
[2:28:25] forever ahem because it's because of
[2:28:28] Abraham we know a lot if God didn't call
[2:28:31] the ever ahamill we had children of
[2:28:32] Abraham and we know these things they've
[2:28:34] gotta call Abraham who islets
[2:28:36] but the Bible tells us Abraham had two
[2:28:39] brothers and one of his brothers died
[2:28:41] and that was Lots father and for some
[2:28:44] reason I don't know what it was an
[2:28:46] attracted lot to Abraham but when God
[2:28:48] spoke to Abraham lot say I'm coming with
[2:28:51] you
[2:28:53] something in luck was attracted to
[2:28:55] something in Abraham that attraction had
[2:28:59] to be real because Abraham didn't even
[2:29:01] know where he was going
[2:29:02] so it had to be something about
[2:29:05] Abraham's approach something about
[2:29:07] Abraham's attitude that attracted a lot
[2:29:10] to follow him in the first place
[2:29:12] Abraham the Bible said was seeking a
[2:29:14] city whose builder and maker was God he
[2:29:17] wasn't looking for a big bank account or
[2:29:19] a platinum Visa credit card or a nice
[2:29:22] house he was looking for a builder a
[2:29:24] city made by God he was not about the
[2:29:28] natural things he was not about natural
[2:29:30] wealth he wasn't about natural ambition
[2:29:35] are you with me this morning don't look
[2:29:38] back
[2:29:38] I'm not taking too long with you but I
[2:29:40] want you to get this because many of us
[2:29:42] we find ourselves caught in this
[2:29:44] position lot is under Abraham's
[2:29:47] leadership he's the part of Abraham's
[2:29:51] house his family worships at Abraham's
[2:29:56] altar and the Bible said that it was
[2:30:01] conflict there was strife between the
[2:30:05] houses now I want to draw clearly to the
[2:30:09] church this morning the issue was not
[2:30:11] spiritual it was not doctrine it was not
[2:30:14] Koontz it was not Scripture
[2:30:17] it was the natural things you park your
[2:30:20] car here I does normally Park here is
[2:30:22] the Bible said they didn't have enough
[2:30:23] room so the natural things I mean I want
[2:30:30] to expand my house but this person too
[2:30:32] close to me so I should explain and he
[2:30:34] tell me I might fence bigger and natural
[2:30:36] things so I want to make the point that
[2:30:39] it was a natural problem a material
[2:30:43] problem a business problem that led to
[2:30:46] the conflict
[2:30:49] it was not that luck did not believe it
[2:30:53] was not that Lot's wife did not believe
[2:30:55] it was to create peace within the family
[2:31:00] that Abraham as the senior said to the
[2:31:03] junior you choose for the sake of peace
[2:31:07] we are too good for us to have our
[2:31:10] people fighting like this it was a
[2:31:12] natural situation and many times in our
[2:31:17] homes and our families we have natural
[2:31:19] arguments there are people who come to
[2:31:22] church upset not because of a spiritual
[2:31:24] issue in the house but an argument in
[2:31:26] the house is anybody in the house this
[2:31:28] morning an argument between husband and
[2:31:33] wife son and daughter oh you don't want
[2:31:35] me to come to your house this morning
[2:31:37] huh husband and wife and house and
[2:31:41] neighbor you on your way to church of
[2:31:43] his argument with a neighbor argument
[2:31:47] over who did breakfast and who washes
[2:31:48] the dishes natural problems and it rules
[2:31:52] the spiritual perspective out of line
[2:31:54] and under the pressure of the natural
[2:31:58] problem lot I want you to pitch your
[2:32:00] luck now he has to make a decision
[2:32:03] Abraham is not choosing for him Abraham
[2:32:06] is not making a recommendation to him
[2:32:09] lot has to choose for himself and every
[2:32:12] one of us in this room this morning we
[2:32:14] have to choose for ourselves because
[2:32:18] that's how God organized it that you
[2:32:21] have a choice to worship or not to
[2:32:23] worship you have a choice to pray or not
[2:32:25] to pray you have a choice to believe or
[2:32:28] not to believe you ever tries to accept
[2:32:30] or not accept you have a choice to come
[2:32:33] to church or not come to church you ever
[2:32:35] tries to pay a tithe or not they attack
[2:32:37] you ever tries to pray or not to pray
[2:32:40] you have a choice a cheat on your wife
[2:32:43] or not to cheat on your wife that's a
[2:32:45] choice you have a choice to save or not
[2:32:47] to see where you can spend your money
[2:32:48] stupid that's a choice
[2:32:53] life is about choices we're gonna have a
[2:32:55] prayer line today and you have a choice
[2:32:57] how you approach the prayer line if you
[2:33:02] are here today because you're looking
[2:33:03] for a blessing or you want to choose
[2:33:04] life and choose eternity and choose
[2:33:08] Redemption and choose not going back
[2:33:10] from where you came and choose real
[2:33:12] deliverance because repentance is not
[2:33:14] just saying I'm sorry it's a change of
[2:33:16] behavior are there any Bible believers
[2:33:21] in the house is Smalling I'm not gonna
[2:33:26] be too long with you but we're waiting
[2:33:28] on a doctor right now I'm operating as a
[2:33:30] nurse right now because the great
[2:33:32] physician is here to operate I'm
[2:33:34] checking the blood pressure
[2:33:36] checking your BMI I'm doin a urine
[2:33:39] sample this morning checking your blood
[2:33:40] sugar level before the doctor that
[2:33:42] operate making sure that the test
[2:33:45] results are in that your heart is right
[2:33:48] that your heart is open up so that he
[2:33:50] can operate without without reservation
[2:33:52] that your toys open because he said I
[2:33:54] stand at the door knock and if any man
[2:33:57] open up I'm gonna come in and sup with
[2:33:59] him you may be seated
[2:34:04] I saw something yesterday until people
[2:34:10] want to be delivered you will anoint him
[2:34:13] with oil and have greasy demons I see it
[2:34:23] one more time until people want it to be
[2:34:26] delivered
[2:34:26] you can anoint him with oil as much as
[2:34:28] you want he'll have greasy demons the
[2:34:31] man who was beating up preachers when he
[2:34:33] came into the house we're better Branham
[2:34:35] was and the minister's left the platform
[2:34:36] and he challenged the Prophet the
[2:34:39] Prophet as a short man stood right there
[2:34:41] when all the other ministers ran for
[2:34:43] their lives when that man came up to the
[2:34:46] Prophet the Prophet said you wanna fall
[2:34:48] over my feet because you have challenged
[2:34:50] the Lord he didn't challenge God even
[2:34:52] challenged the Prophet challenge God
[2:34:53] because I was God's man
[2:34:59] when the police came because the police
[2:35:01] the law got involved see Willis mommy
[2:35:03] already said no because you worship the
[2:35:07] spirit that's upon him he wants to be
[2:35:10] that way he wants to be that way you
[2:35:16] have to want to be delivered I am tired
[2:35:18] of having services you talk to people
[2:35:22] the Branham said he it hurt him when he
[2:35:24] preached certain things and he the same
[2:35:26] over and over and over again and the
[2:35:29] people didn't respond it wears down on
[2:35:31] the preacher it's the same frustration a
[2:35:40] teacher would have in a school you stand
[2:35:42] in front of a classroom and you teach
[2:35:43] and you tell them you have to mix
[2:35:45] something about yourself and these
[2:35:47] panelists and the good teachers they do
[2:35:48] it and it hurts them when they see
[2:35:52] children potential wasted where's their
[2:35:56] potential
[2:36:05] so there is Abraham he's waiting for a
[2:36:09] lot to tell him where he wants to go and
[2:36:13] the Bible said that a lot made a
[2:36:16] decision he did not decide to backslide
[2:36:20] he didn't decide to leave the church he
[2:36:24] didn't side to take his family out of
[2:36:26] church lot made a decision believing
[2:36:31] that it would work out lot made a
[2:36:37] decision believing that his family would
[2:36:40] maintain the values that they were
[2:36:43] raised up under lot made a decision at
[2:36:47] that time that he thought was the best
[2:36:49] decision he could make he made a
[2:36:54] decision not to go into Sodom but to
[2:36:58] move close to Sodom the Bible said he
[2:37:02] pitched his tent towards he leaned in
[2:37:06] the direction and I shared on Wednesday
[2:37:10] and I shared in another place I said
[2:37:11] listen what you may be able to handle
[2:37:14] speaking to the fathers in the house
[2:37:16] your family may not be able to handle
[2:37:19] because lot was able to survive this
[2:37:24] whole story as we know about but he lost
[2:37:27] children in the process he lost his wife
[2:37:30] in the process so we are decisions
[2:37:33] prayerfully before doing anything can
[2:37:37] the church say Amen so lot the Bible
[2:37:40] says and black sliding I can imagine
[2:37:44] missus lot gets close to Sodom that's a
[2:37:50] look at the clothes look at the styles
[2:37:53] look at the fashion not is a man of
[2:37:56] prestige he thought he made a good
[2:37:58] decision for his family because by
[2:38:00] moving close to Sodom he had more
[2:38:01] customers he moved to the city I'm
[2:38:06] preaching it because they builded they
[2:38:09] planted they married a lot of people say
[2:38:13] lot had two daughters read the Bible he
[2:38:14] had
[2:38:15] more than two daughters because he had
[2:38:16] daughters who were married and he was
[2:38:19] sons-in-laws in Scripture to left with
[2:38:21] him but he lost daughters so he had
[2:38:23] daughters who married lot would have
[2:38:26] builded he was a businessman he was a
[2:38:29] wealthy man because it was wealth that
[2:38:31] created a problem
[2:38:32] Abraham's prosperity and lots prosperity
[2:38:35] grew to the point that it could not
[2:38:36] coexist the Bible said what was found at
[2:38:39] the gate of Sodom the gate of Sodom is
[2:38:42] the commercial center of the city so he
[2:38:45] was at the business center when these
[2:38:47] two angels came and he bowed down to
[2:38:49] them I said on Wednesday night that God
[2:38:52] was finishing up with Abraham and the
[2:38:54] Bible said the endless will of work
[2:38:55] getting up and walking and the Bible
[2:38:57] said Abram was leading them along the
[2:38:59] way when God said to Abram it was almost
[2:39:04] in passing that he since that's a
[2:39:07] conversation he had went so well and I
[2:39:09] told him what are you children according
[2:39:11] to Tamara life let me just share
[2:39:12] something with you Adam why are we
[2:39:13] walking why are we walking I'm about to
[2:39:17] go I've heard a cry in Sodom and I want
[2:39:19] to investigate to see if this thing is
[2:39:21] as bad as I'm hearing because it was as
[2:39:23] bad as I'm hearing judgment is coming
[2:39:25] and I can imagine the level that Abraham
[2:39:28] had to have to almost all go at hand if
[2:39:31] it were and say hol up hol up hol up hol
[2:39:32] up
[2:39:33] it can't be your way for you to just
[2:39:37] judge everybody like that that's not how
[2:39:39] you do things I'm paraphrasing that's
[2:39:42] not what you operate you are fear judge
[2:39:45] in Debbie 50 would you not spare them
[2:39:48] I'm going to say okay and the Bible said
[2:39:51] Abraham started to plead he said I am
[2:39:53] but dust I am nobody I have nothing
[2:39:55] forgive me if I push it myself but if
[2:39:58] it's five less than fifty what he
[2:40:00] destroyed and we know this we understand
[2:40:02] this and Abraham pleaded down to ten and
[2:40:05] two angels went into Sodom
[2:40:09] for one reason and one reason only
[2:40:11] deliverance this is a deliverance
[2:40:14] service one reason and one reason only
[2:40:17] deliverance because with deliverance is
[2:40:20] always judgment but as pertains the
[2:40:24] believers is deliverance judgment is to
[2:40:26] the world
[2:40:27] so with deliverance
[2:40:28] judgment and the Angels get there me
[2:40:33] know the story lot brings them in the
[2:40:35] men of the city tried to get them locked
[2:40:38] offers his two daughters who had not
[2:40:40] known men virgins to the men and listen
[2:40:43] we don't want them we won the men that
[2:40:45] came into the house when Locke said no
[2:40:48] you can't have them the men of the city
[2:40:50] say who lot think he is you are outsider
[2:40:53] trying to fit in here does empower
[2:40:55] phrasing how you become a judge over our
[2:40:57] lifestyle read a Bible and at that point
[2:41:02] the Bible says that the Angels pulled
[2:41:04] lot didn't blinded the men and the Bible
[2:41:07] said it was only exhaustion that stopped
[2:41:11] those men in their blinded conditions
[2:41:12] trying to find the door because it was
[2:41:15] spirits upon them spirits upon them are
[2:41:22] we dealing with spiritual warfare Lot's
[2:41:27] wife would have been seeing all of this
[2:41:29] interaction so she knows how the people
[2:41:32] live now many times we look at lot as a
[2:41:39] compromiser and in part we could say yes
[2:41:42] he ended up in sort of but I want to
[2:41:44] read one scripture for you to see how
[2:41:49] Peter justified lot in second Peter 2
[2:41:54] and verse 4 second Peter 2 verse 4 for
[2:42:01] if God spared not the Angels that sinned
[2:42:03] but cast them down to hell and delivered
[2:42:05] them into chains of Darkness to be
[2:42:09] reserved unto judgement and spared not
[2:42:12] the old world but saved Noah the eighth
[2:42:14] person a preacher of righteousness
[2:42:15] bringing in the flood upon the world of
[2:42:18] the ungodly and turning the cities of
[2:42:20] Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned
[2:42:23] them with an overthrow making them an
[2:42:25] example listen what's around and more is
[2:42:27] an example unto those that after should
[2:42:30] live ungodly
[2:42:33] so for all times Sodom and Gomorrah is a
[2:42:37] memorial to those that would live
[2:42:39] ungodly against gods we as a reminder to
[2:42:43] you of the consequence and delivered the
[2:42:48] Bible goes on just lot
[2:42:49] so Peter justified lot just lot vexed
[2:42:53] listened a lot vexed with the filthy
[2:42:56] conversation of the wicked now there are
[2:42:59] people here this morning who say they
[2:43:01] want to be delivered
[2:43:02] are you vexed with the conversation of
[2:43:04] the wicked or you all up in the
[2:43:06] conversation that's the conversation of
[2:43:13] the wicked bother you or it has have you
[2:43:15] accepted it and you tolerate it and
[2:43:19] people know that they could talk that
[2:43:21] way around you because you never fight
[2:43:23] it it never vex you have you been vexed
[2:43:26] because lot was in a messed up condition
[2:43:29] but the Bible says he was still vexed
[2:43:32] with the filthy conversation of the
[2:43:35] wicked anybody with me
[2:43:39] have you become intolerant have you
[2:43:45] lowered your guard so much that you just
[2:43:47] allow any kind of conversation around
[2:43:49] you you know that but the Branham said
[2:43:51] there are certain things he said he
[2:43:52] didn't let certain people into his car
[2:43:53] because he said one time a man came in
[2:43:56] the can spoke a blue streak what he said
[2:43:59] had a color read a message words have
[2:44:04] power so a lot in his condition although
[2:44:08] he was in a backslidden condition as it
[2:44:10] were found himself in Sodom he was tell
[2:44:15] vexed with the conversation where his
[2:44:17] behavior
[2:44:19] we reached conduct and attitude and the
[2:44:22] homosexuality and that's not we reach
[2:44:24] that part yet just a conversation it's
[2:44:28] an embarrassment when Christians are
[2:44:30] involved in foolish conversation because
[2:44:33] life and death is in the power of the
[2:44:35] tongue and your lips your mouth is
[2:44:37] reserved for spoken would spoken would
[2:44:42] that's why you are temples of the Holy
[2:44:43] Ghost for the spoken
[2:44:45] would God to use you as a vessel let's
[2:44:53] go further for that righteous man
[2:44:56] so Peter called a righteous man you call
[2:44:59] him something else because the Angels
[2:45:03] went into Sodom to get the righteous so
[2:45:07] it was lots righteousness that covered
[2:45:10] his family it was lots righteousness
[2:45:13] that made a way for his family to even
[2:45:16] hear the message but come on and you
[2:45:21] young people who want to be
[2:45:22] disrespectful to your parents it is
[2:45:25] their righteousness they may have false
[2:45:28] but God sees them as righteousness
[2:45:31] because he sees to the blood how do you
[2:45:34] disrespect your parents yes not had his
[2:45:44] problems but there's blood for problems
[2:45:46] come on somebody helped me this morning
[2:45:49] yes luck messed up but there's blood for
[2:45:52] messing up oh come on
[2:45:54] somebody come on somebody anybody in the
[2:45:58] house this morning
[2:45:59] [Applause]
[2:46:04] so we dealt with I want to read it
[2:46:07] carefully because I know many who have
[2:46:09] not read the scripture and delivered
[2:46:11] just lot so pizza in his ministry had to
[2:46:16] come in the New Testament to justify the
[2:46:19] perception of lot just like we didn't
[2:46:24] know until Peter made it clear because
[2:46:25] if you read Genesis alone you would see
[2:46:28] lot as this backslider and if it wasn't
[2:46:30] for Abraham lot had no chance but Peter
[2:46:33] brings another perspective
[2:46:35] yes luck messed up yes Abraham pleaded
[2:46:38] for him but we didn't know about the
[2:46:40] sighing and crying that was going
[2:46:43] through the travail of a father the
[2:46:46] travail of a husband the travail of
[2:46:48] maybe a grandfather we don't know but a
[2:46:50] lot was there
[2:46:51] he wasn't captive but he wasn't reveal
[2:46:55] he wasn't trouble but he wasn't surveil
[2:46:58] of spirit travail of soul he knew he was
[2:47:01] not where he was supposed to be he did
[2:47:04] not the strength to deliver himself you
[2:47:06] need to deliver us but it was a travail
[2:47:08] in his spirit he was crying out for
[2:47:11] something anybody in the house this
[2:47:17] morning I want to read a scripture
[2:47:20] carefully and delivered just lot vexed
[2:47:25] with the filthy conversation of the
[2:47:28] wicked so there are two things I want
[2:47:30] you to understand that because we had
[2:47:33] put a mark upon those who sigh and cry
[2:47:36] for the abomination in the city but what
[2:47:38] does that really mean this is it here he
[2:47:43] is vexed with the filthy conversation of
[2:47:45] the wicked sighing and crying is Britain
[2:47:48] bothered by it
[2:47:49] and the Bible goes on for that righteous
[2:47:51] man dwelling among them in seeing and
[2:47:55] hearing now we come into actions not
[2:47:59] just words in seeing and hearing vexed
[2:48:04] his righteous soul from day to day with
[2:48:07] their unlawful deeds
[2:48:10] now we dealing with the behavior so lot
[2:48:14] is there at the gate of Sodom and he's
[2:48:16] dying within himself he's dying watching
[2:48:20] his wife hear from him because she is no
[2:48:22] different from when they came to this
[2:48:24] house her behavior has changed his
[2:48:27] children who he had an expectation of
[2:48:30] the Bible said that they went and threw
[2:48:32] worldly men and married them and that's
[2:48:37] the Bible can we go on
[2:48:42] so the angels and they were allowed to
[2:48:44] say a lot is there anybody else that you
[2:48:48] care about our access money is anybody
[2:48:51] else that you care about who should be
[2:48:53] delivered because we came to let you
[2:48:55] know that we have come to judge this
[2:48:58] whole city is gonna be destroyed so I
[2:49:00] advise you get your whole family get
[2:49:03] them in to hear this message the aims
[2:49:08] are specific you have son-in-law you
[2:49:09] have any other daughters he goes down in
[2:49:11] Genesis 19 and the Bible says but two
[2:49:16] verses or so later lot goes to his
[2:49:18] sons-in-law and Arab said the sons in
[2:49:21] law mocked him and the Bible said that
[2:49:27] lot lingered let me read it I'm almost
[2:49:33] done
[2:49:41] don't look back friends I find in
[2:49:47] Genesis three kinds of believers lot
[2:49:53] sons-in-law were clearly unbelievers did
[2:49:58] not believe they mocked him let me get
[2:50:01] it and lot went out and speak unto his
[2:50:07] sons-in-law which married his daughters
[2:50:09] plural and said up get you out of this
[2:50:12] place for the Lord will destroy this
[2:50:14] city but he seemed as one that mocked
[2:50:17] unto his sons in laws didn't accept it
[2:50:22] and when the morning arose at the angels
[2:50:24] he stood not saying arise take thy wife
[2:50:28] and my two daughters which I hear we
[2:50:32] don't know where the other daughters are
[2:50:33] but these are here lest they be consumed
[2:50:37] in the iniquity of the city and I could
[2:50:40] imagine Lots device and while he
[2:50:43] lingered you know what it is as a parent
[2:50:46] to stand there and you don't know what
[2:50:49] going on with the other daughters his
[2:50:51] sons-in-law you know your wife and a
[2:50:53] condition and these two daughters who
[2:50:56] have stayed with you the Bible said they
[2:50:57] have not known any man they are the ones
[2:50:59] who at least tried to behave so a lot is
[2:51:04] lingering we don't know why he's
[2:51:05] lingering but maybe he linger because
[2:51:07] he's hoping the other daughters come to
[2:51:10] their senses
[2:51:11] maybe he's hoping his sons and laws
[2:51:13] decide at least let me take a risk and
[2:51:16] go out what could go wrong if he write
[2:51:20] us alive if he wrong I come back but
[2:51:25] these were young men was so delusional
[2:51:27] that didn't even take the calculated
[2:51:30] risk I want you to think about it
[2:51:32] friends I don't think you've ever heard
[2:51:35] this presented like this
[2:51:39] why are you lingered the angels not a
[2:51:42] falsity action the Bible says the men
[2:51:44] laid hold upon his hand and upon the
[2:51:47] hand of his wife and upon the hand of
[2:51:49] his two daughters in other words
[2:51:50] angels are now physically removing them
[2:51:53] they are no longer depending on words to
[2:51:55] move them but a pop well they are
[2:51:57] physically extracting them they are
[2:52:00] kidnapping them they are arresting them
[2:52:03] physically taking them out because the
[2:52:06] words were not enough luck was still
[2:52:08] lingering the inner to physically take
[2:52:12] them out I want you to understand now
[2:52:15] two dimensions of this one is God is
[2:52:21] serious about deliverance so serious
[2:52:24] about deliverance that he will not just
[2:52:26] use word alone to get you he has to use
[2:52:28] force if necessary to get you he is so
[2:52:35] serious about deliverance and his
[2:52:38] promise to deliver he made a promise to
[2:52:41] Abraham to get his family and God cannot
[2:52:46] break his promise so God had to have you
[2:52:48] angels let me I just had the earpieces
[2:52:51] or they say all the Deacons are
[2:52:52] earpieces pull them out extract them
[2:52:53] know and move them out now no more
[2:52:56] waiting time is gone no time left take
[2:53:00] them out put them unconscious if you
[2:53:02] have to but get them out knock them out
[2:53:04] if you have to but take them out break
[2:53:07] the foot if you have to but get them out
[2:53:10] because judgment is coming but there's a
[2:53:12] promise over them yet time I died with
[2:53:14] the rest they must be delivered God will
[2:53:23] do whatever it takes to break you out of
[2:53:26] even break you out of sin to break you
[2:53:29] out of the world you better believe it
[2:53:33] [Applause]
[2:53:38] can eat a little more
[2:53:40] almost then sue me feelings just skipped
[2:53:42] you wither and while he lingered the men
[2:53:46] lead hall upon his hand and upon the
[2:53:48] hand of his wife and upon the hand of
[2:53:50] his two daughters the Lord being
[2:53:52] merciful unto him so this force this
[2:53:54] kidnapping this extraction was mercy
[2:53:59] it's like a father pulling a child
[2:54:01] roughly from a fire because a child
[2:54:04] don't know what gonna happen and the
[2:54:05] child cried because you call Emily and
[2:54:07] they feel bad about being pulled but
[2:54:09] that's mercy when the word comes to you
[2:54:17] in a way that makes you feel
[2:54:18] uncomfortable because you're not living
[2:54:19] right that's mercy because it's a
[2:54:23] judgement sheet and it's just blood on
[2:54:25] the judgment seat that makes it a mercy
[2:54:27] seat the Lord being merciful unto Him
[2:54:34] and they brought him for and set him
[2:54:37] without the city or outside the city and
[2:54:41] it came to pass when they had brought
[2:54:44] them forth abroad that is an escape for
[2:54:47] thy life No that to me is
[2:54:49] self-explanatory if somebody says you
[2:54:54] better Joe run for your life that way
[2:54:57] what would you do
[2:55:05] escape for your life look not behind me
[2:55:09] in other words don't look back need us
[2:55:11] Theodore when all the plane and I were
[2:55:13] doing around here
[2:55:14] there's nothing more for you here let's
[2:55:20] go be consumed and I'll stop reading
[2:55:25] there
[2:55:26] I work too brainy so close musicians
[2:55:28] made ready
[2:55:42] they are challenged to move quickly but
[2:55:45] the Branham and doing prayer lines and
[2:55:47] in doing ministry he would say the angel
[2:55:51] is here receive him quickly stand up
[2:55:52] right away because if you don't respond
[2:55:55] right away he said he will move on
[2:55:59] respond quickly
[2:56:07] Lot's wife would have grown up on the
[2:56:09] Abraham would have had to decline while
[2:56:14] she wasn't Sodom with no doubt had known
[2:56:17] that these are angels that would have
[2:56:18] come would have seen a manifestation the
[2:56:21] blinded eyes would have heard a lot
[2:56:23] repeat the message would have been told
[2:56:27] by the Angels escaped don't look back
[2:56:30] they start to move out it's only when
[2:56:34] they were all judgment strike so when
[2:56:36] judgment struck they were already out
[2:56:39] there was something to go back to
[2:56:41] because judgment was already striking
[2:56:44] deeper than that in that custom lot
[2:56:48] would have been in front leading his
[2:56:51] family out friends I don't know when a
[2:56:56] lot found out what happened his wife
[2:56:59] because he couldn't look back so he is
[2:57:03] walking running moving trying to get to
[2:57:07] safety and some along the journey his
[2:57:11] wife has turned to salt but he's still
[2:57:12] going maybe he was talking to them
[2:57:14] saying how he got any back they hurry
[2:57:16] back then after a while he gets no
[2:57:19] response this is real friends this is
[2:57:24] not Church why is your there he can't
[2:57:30] stop moving because he's a believer
[2:57:34] because guacamole proved his word by
[2:57:36] believers so as a believer he has to
[2:57:38] keep moving because if he stops moving
[2:57:40] he's not a believer wife you're there
[2:57:43] yes I'm here yes I'm here
[2:57:45] wife you the wife wife no response
[2:57:55] sons-in-laws they were unbelievers they
[2:57:57] stayed back they were Judge up until
[2:58:00] Lot's wife turned around we didn't know
[2:58:03] what she was she acted like a believer
[2:58:07] she walked like a believer she talked
[2:58:10] like a believer but when she looked back
[2:58:13] she shoe who she was she was am a
[2:58:15] believer
[2:58:17] because why she was in Sodom she didn't
[2:58:19] realize Sodom came into her friends
[2:58:23] whatever is in your heart will come out
[2:58:27] everything less it is in darkness that
[2:58:29] you want to keep covered up it's gonna
[2:58:31] come out there's no secret to know you
[2:58:34] know hiding nothing alone I want you to
[2:58:43] wonder I'm kidding you you can make me
[2:58:45] play something softly that's why she's
[2:58:48] walking out she hears it she she
[2:58:51] believes she's here in the cries she's
[2:58:53] here in the judgement she's see a lot
[2:58:56] moving the daughters may be behind her
[2:58:58] and something is eating her up because
[2:59:03] they were telling her to come out of
[2:59:04] Sodom but nobody had taken what was in
[2:59:06] her out of her love couldn't deliver
[2:59:11] himself but she came physically out but
[2:59:17] she was still there she was physically
[2:59:21] out but her heart was still there there
[2:59:25] are people here this morning in the
[2:59:27] tabernacle but your heart is not here
[2:59:29] your heart is not here this morning your
[2:59:36] body is here you have the signs and
[2:59:38] emotions how many churches this morning
[2:59:40] I filled with corpses people bodies and
[2:59:44] they have all emotional and moving but
[2:59:46] their heart total of the Lord said if
[2:59:51] you love the world and the things of the
[2:59:52] world a love of God is not even in you
[2:59:57] [Music]
[2:59:58] her issue was the Styles the fashion the
[3:00:03] lifestyle the culture what's your
[3:00:07] attraction
[3:00:09] not when thinking you would have a
[3:00:11] bigger business perhaps is it your
[3:00:14] career is it prestige and I want to ax
[3:00:19] another question let's just go back to a
[3:00:20] lot before I close out because a lot
[3:00:24] despite the fact that he was just he
[3:00:26] merely deliverance too so they bought
[3:00:28] needed deliverance will touch a lot then
[3:00:33] we'll get back to Lot's wife and we'll
[3:00:35] finish if a lot was uncomfortable why
