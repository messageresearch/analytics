[45:23] morning service it's so good to be in
[45:26] his presence
[45:27] is the most important thing for our
[45:30] lives to get into God's presence
[45:32] amen and you know Only God know Eden
[45:34] when man got kicked out he put angels to
[45:37] God
[45:38] the we got that tree so that man cannot
[45:41] partake of that life that tree of life
[45:44] in that condition but now the angels are
[45:47] driving and striving to get us back into
[45:50] that position
[45:52] you the angel of the more for you than
[45:54] against you
[45:55] you don't know how much God working day
[45:57] and night to get you back in your
[45:59] position and please how much accidents
[46:01] how much disasters how much things God
[46:03] has protected you from praise God things
[46:06] seen unseen praise God and God has been
[46:08] blessing and helping you to get back
[46:10] because we are in Satan's Eden make no
[46:14] don't make no bones about it we are
[46:16] incident Eden hell is on the earth and I
[46:20] was thinking about um
[46:22] about what the devil is using now and I
[46:25] see using the music in particular every
[46:27] time music behind it everything in the
[46:29] movies the music social media and it's
[46:32] all that four-dimension realm the prince
[46:35] of the power of the ear and the worst
[46:38] thing the devil have for the Church of
[46:39] deception to see if he could deceive you
[46:41] because once you see it get off the word
[46:44] it's like the hung of hell because
[46:46] remember remember with the battle not
[46:48] against flesh and blood it's not flesh
[46:50] and blood it's not your family and your
[46:51] friend no it's principalities and Powers
[46:53] coming upon family and friends praise
[46:56] God is the devil coming upon them and
[46:58] you you have a battle in your hand and
[47:00] once you understand that you fight every
[47:02] day
[47:03] every single day you fight not weekly
[47:06] every single day you want to be a
[47:09] Christian every day you want to fight
[47:10] every day praise God you want to give
[47:12] God a witness that you'll have a
[47:14] testimony like Shattuck Michigan and
[47:16] then they go you'll have a testimony
[47:18] like Daniel you will have a testimony
[47:20] like all the heroes are fake out there
[47:22] oh praise the name of the Lord so
[47:24] something else is she called the Liturgy
[47:26] of the message and the hug and stay
[47:28] close to this word because heaven will
[47:30] pass away but what is those cannot pass
[47:32] away and the only thing the devil cannot
[47:34] deceive is the word you cannot mess up
[47:36] with the word and if you become a word
[47:38] break you cannot be deceived you will
[47:40] begin to recognize the devil at every
[47:42] one of his tricks and when we begin to
[47:45] recognize listen to these words now when
[47:47] you begin to recognize the devil is then
[47:49] you will effectively start to overcome
[47:52] because if Satan is not coming up to you
[47:54] and all I am the devil no he's you know
[47:56] that he slowly does things he does
[47:59] things in a slow way to pull you into
[48:01] his web he don't just drop down and do
[48:04] this you know it's a slow way you stop
[48:06] praying you slow you stop praising it's
[48:09] very slow you stop coming out you're
[48:11] very slow and it's just taking you over
[48:14] oh praise God but we are here to resist
[48:17] the devil he said resist the devil he
[48:20] shall flee that's our order from God
[48:22] resist the devil and you can flee your
[48:24] tolerated resist him let him know you
[48:27] are against him let him know you're
[48:28] still standing with him praise God let
[48:30] him know that you're standing with God
[48:32] you're standing with the word Oh Glory
[48:34] to God presents the devil oh Hallelujah
[48:37] he shall free from you
[48:40] he many men put up a resistance they'll
[48:43] just give in don't just let go praise
[48:45] God one shall let go he likes that when
[48:47] you let go and you're easy you let go oh

[48:52] of this praise God hallelujah you may be

[58:00] like to go to our Bibles and
[58:02] uh
[58:04] read from the scripture this morning
[58:07] amen we have a few thoughts to share
[58:10] I pray that to be a blessing to you this
[58:12] morning amen so three portions of
[58:14] scripture we want to read from
[58:16] actually first from Matthew uh
[58:20] Matthew chapter 8 on Books five I'll go
[58:23] back to Psalms
[58:26] we just read from Psalms one
[58:29] and then I'll go back to sync Loop in
[58:31] the New Testament
[58:32] 24 Okay so praise God it's just the
[58:36] order of it I uh
[58:38] just how it come to me
[58:40] so Matthew chapter 8
[58:45] um
[58:46] and who's five right so he says that
[58:48] when Jesus entered into Capernaum
[58:51] they came unto him
[58:53] a centurion beseeching him and saying
[58:56] Lord my servant liar at home sick of the
[59:00] policy grievously tormented
[59:03] and Jesus said unto him I will come and
[59:05] heal him
[59:07] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[59:10] am not worthy that thou has come
[59:12] under my roof
[59:13] but speak the word only my servant shall
[59:17] be healed
[59:18] for I am a man under Authority
[59:21] having soldiers under me I say to this
[59:24] man go
[59:25] and he goes unto another come
[59:28] and he cometh unto my servant do this
[59:32] he doeth it when Jesus heard it he
[59:36] modeled and said to them that followed
[59:39] verily I say unto you I have not found
[59:43] so great faith no not in Israel
[59:47] amen and now Psalms chapter 1
[59:50] we just want to read through there
[59:54] Psalm chapter one okay and it says
[59:56] blessed is a man that walketh not in the
[59:58] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[1:00:01] the way of sinners
[1:00:02] or sitted in the seat of the scornful
[1:00:05] but his Delight is in the law of the
[1:00:08] Lord
[1:00:09] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[1:00:12] night
[1:00:13] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[1:00:15] the rivers of water
[1:00:17] and bringeth forth fruit in his season
[1:00:19] his leave also shall not wither
[1:00:23] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:00:26] the ungodly are not so
[1:00:28] but I like the chaff which the wind
[1:00:30] driveth away
[1:00:31] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:00:34] the judgment no sinners in the
[1:00:37] congregation of the righteous
[1:00:39] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[1:00:41] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[1:00:44] Shall Perish amen lastly we want to read
[1:00:48] from Saint Luke 24 amen and then we you

[1:01:13] and it came to pass while he blessed
[1:01:16] them he was pointed from them and
[1:01:18] carried up into heaven
[1:01:20] and they worshiped him and returned to

[1:05:10] able to work to the effectual working of
[1:05:11] his power praise God and a place there
[1:05:14] for a reason amen isn't that right so we
[1:05:18] thank God for every little part for
[1:05:20] every brother for every sister for every
[1:05:23] prayer for every stand for every word of
[1:05:26] encouragement for every amen a shoulder
[1:05:28] towed a wheel we thank God for all of it
[1:05:31] isn't that right amen and amen so praise
[1:05:34] the name of the Lord so
[1:05:35] so that's my theme today and that's my
[1:05:38] general thought wanted to speak on
[1:05:40] leadership
[1:05:41] and
[1:05:45] God
[1:05:47] you know I could probably just reflect
[1:05:49] on this but
[1:05:50] you know God has kind of been showing me
[1:05:52] a lot of things for the past few years
[1:05:55] in particular
[1:05:56] and I've seen the hand of God in my life
[1:05:58] in a special way
[1:06:00] uh showing me things
[1:06:03] uh instructing me in things uh educating
[1:06:07] me in things and it's so important to
[1:06:10] have a spirit of willingness
[1:06:12] to be willing to learn
[1:06:15] uh you know learn of me then see God God
[1:06:19] speaks to us
[1:06:20] and um you know it's it's so important
[1:06:23] even no matter how much older you get
[1:06:26] you know we tend to think we're like the
[1:06:28] prophet said we get self-secure
[1:06:30] you know uh in our ability to know
[1:06:33] things or understand things maybe we
[1:06:35] come to a point where we even
[1:06:37] opt to teach
[1:06:39] younger ones
[1:06:41] still even in that condition we have to
[1:06:44] be in a place that where we could learn
[1:06:46] things
[1:06:47] I genuinely believe that that's where
[1:06:49] we're coming to because we're going to a
[1:06:52] place where we we haven't been before
[1:06:54] and it take God to lead us
[1:06:57] by inspiration
[1:07:00] amen and by Revelation to show us where
[1:07:02] he wants to go
[1:07:04] isn't that right
[1:07:05] look at Joshua Joshua when they were
[1:07:08] Conquering the land
[1:07:10] God told Joshua meditate on a word day
[1:07:13] and night and you'll have good success
[1:07:14] now every city required a different
[1:07:18] strategy or required a different tactic
[1:07:21] in order to take it
[1:07:23] it's not right the way they conquered
[1:07:26] Jericho was not the same way they
[1:07:29] conquered the AI isn't that right and
[1:07:32] the way they conquered eye is not the
[1:07:33] same way they conquered the other city
[1:07:35] and the other city and so forth and the
[1:07:36] jebusites and the parasites they all
[1:07:39] require different plans and strategies
[1:07:41] as God moves forward but as long as
[1:07:44] Joshua was willing to listen
[1:07:47] to his Captain's instructions as long as
[1:07:51] he was willing to be led then he was
[1:07:54] willing to follow then they had the
[1:07:56] victory
[1:07:57] every single tongue as long as they
[1:08:01] followed God's instructions they got the
[1:08:04] Victory and as long as you are willing
[1:08:06] to follow God's leadership
[1:08:09] oh somebody say Amen as long as you're
[1:08:11] willing to follow God's instructions you
[1:08:15] will get the victory in your life over
[1:08:17] every trial over every test over every
[1:08:21] table over every enemy over every
[1:08:24] opposition or there shall no evil be
[1:08:27] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:08:30] of thy life and as I was with Moses so
[1:08:34] shall I be with you God's Gonna approve
[1:08:37] you hallelujah amen if you're willing to
[1:08:41] be lame
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:44] to have the right attitude
[1:08:46] I was in a class
[1:08:48] I think I might have said this before
[1:08:49] anyway I was in a class learning about
[1:08:52] graphic design and stuff
[1:08:53] and the uh the lecturer put on a video
[1:08:56] for us and he was like you know you'll
[1:08:57] watch this video
[1:08:58] uh about one of the one of the courses
[1:09:02] it was so sad I saw turn around I saw
[1:09:05] one of my classmates
[1:09:07] uh and he made a remark he said you know
[1:09:09] I know this already
[1:09:11] you know
[1:09:12] I've seen this before
[1:09:14] and then he
[1:09:16] pulled out his cell phone and scrolled
[1:09:18] through into account or something
[1:09:19] and it was just so sad because
[1:09:22] here it is he has an opportunity to get
[1:09:24] maybe a refresher
[1:09:26] or maybe he has something he never heard
[1:09:29] before
[1:09:30] but because he took that attitude
[1:09:33] he shut down his opportunity to learn
[1:09:36] something
[1:09:37] and to clean something new
[1:09:40] the human brain is interesting I learned
[1:09:43] about something recently called
[1:09:44] habituation
[1:09:46] and habituation is when your brain
[1:09:49] begins to learn your environment
[1:09:51] and it habituates it and it becomes
[1:09:53] habitual
[1:09:55] meaning that your brain gets comfortable
[1:09:57] with seeing the same images all the time
[1:09:59] right so after a while
[1:10:02] you tend to not notice certain things
[1:10:05] you know it tends to bypass your your
[1:10:08] your your brain kind of thing you know
[1:10:13] um so
[1:10:15] you might have walked in the the
[1:10:16] building this morning and probably not
[1:10:18] noticed there was a bottle on top of
[1:10:20] that ledge there
[1:10:21] you didn't turn to look at it it's there
[1:10:24] but your brain habituated it because
[1:10:26] maybe you saw it before and your brain
[1:10:27] said well I you know I'm trying to learn
[1:10:30] new things so I'll disregard the things
[1:10:33] I've seen before
[1:10:34] and sometimes this can be an enemy
[1:10:37] to you to your progress
[1:10:40] because when you get so used to
[1:10:43] something
[1:10:44] you don't notice when maybe there's a
[1:10:46] subtle change
[1:10:48] in your environment
[1:10:50] that might actually be a danger to you
[1:10:53] but you don't notice it right away
[1:10:55] you know sometimes some people on the
[1:10:58] show and they see the water go back and
[1:10:59] they say oh maybe a wave's coming in
[1:11:01] maybe it's not going back in more what
[1:11:04] they don't even realize that maybe a
[1:11:05] title is coming
[1:11:07] but they get so used to seeing the ocean
[1:11:09] they drive by and say well it's not the
[1:11:11] ocean
[1:11:12] they don't even realize when something
[1:11:14] unusual is happening
[1:11:15] isn't there a tsunami or some warning
[1:11:18] you see because he habituated it and so
[1:11:21] it's a really bad approach to take and
[1:11:23] so what we want to do especially when
[1:11:25] when we're in the presence of gone is to
[1:11:28] take every opportunity we can to learn
[1:11:30] of God
[1:11:31] and to learn it because sometimes you
[1:11:33] haven't heard it until you heard it
[1:11:35] sometimes you have to hear it again
[1:11:37] praise God and sometimes when you hear
[1:11:39] it again your brain picks up something
[1:11:41] new
[1:11:42] that you probably didn't hear before
[1:11:45] amen amen isn't that right and sometimes
[1:11:48] that's God speaking to you praise God
[1:11:51] because yeah I hadn't heard it until you
[1:11:52] heard it until it's resonated in there
[1:11:55] until it's become solid in me until that
[1:11:58] seed is sewn in there and then when it's
[1:12:01] sown God can pour His Revelation upon it
[1:12:04] and reveal what is being spoken and
[1:12:08] reveal to you personally what is being
[1:12:10] said because once it's revealed to you
[1:12:12] you could now have it you could possess
[1:12:15] it you could walk in it it could
[1:12:18] materialize for you this morning oh so
[1:12:22] if God revealed to you this morning that
[1:12:23] you're gonna be healed maybe you heard
[1:12:25] it before but this morning in the
[1:12:28] presence of the Shekinah he's gonna make
[1:12:30] it fresh to you this morning fresh Manna
[1:12:33] Hallelujah he can anointed afresh he can
[1:12:37] Inspire afresh to your heart and life
[1:12:40] this morning to make you know that
[1:12:43] you're going to be healed that you're
[1:12:45] going to be delivered that you're going
[1:12:47] to be restored that you're going to be
[1:12:49] sealed oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:54] oh Hallelujah so let's get into spirit
[1:12:57] this morning praise God let's get on the
[1:13:00] expectation this morning to hear what
[1:13:02] God will speak amen because I am under
[1:13:04] expectation
[1:13:06] you're an expectation praise God Amen to
[1:13:09] hear what he will sing
[1:13:10] amen praise God I'm just as excited as
[1:13:12] you amen praise God
[1:13:14] so God bless you leadership
[1:13:16] now I just found it was a foundational
[1:13:18] principle teaching of Life see this
[1:13:21] theme and subject of leadership
[1:13:24] and there was a zoom uh meeting that we
[1:13:29] had quite a while back about parenting
[1:13:33] but Ovid had hosted so graciously and
[1:13:36] loved what he brought out
[1:13:39] one of the most pivotal things I thought
[1:13:41] that he brought out was a
[1:13:43] how he connected parenting to leadership
[1:13:46] you know uh and how being a parent
[1:13:51] is really being a leader in that
[1:13:54] capacity
[1:13:56] you know
[1:13:57] uh like a parent caring for a child and
[1:14:00] even God Likens himself to a parent
[1:14:04] he Likens himself to a father
[1:14:07] he's called El Shaddai the breasted one
[1:14:10] nurse upon his breast nurse upon his
[1:14:13] promises he he Likens himself unto a a
[1:14:16] parent a father caring for his children
[1:14:19] consumed for his sons concerned for his
[1:14:23] daughters concerned that they would that
[1:14:25] they would make it that they would
[1:14:27] overcome concerned that their needs
[1:14:29] would be met all the time he's concerned
[1:14:33] about you this morning even when you
[1:14:35] were lost and undone even when you were
[1:14:38] in sin even when you were away from his
[1:14:42] presence even when like The Prodigal Son
[1:14:45] maybe you took your little inheritance
[1:14:47] and went away to a far country even then
[1:14:50] he was concerned about you because
[1:14:53] always then the portals waiting and
[1:14:57] watching praise God watching for you
[1:15:00] watching for me come home oh all you are
[1:15:05] wearing come home all you are struggling
[1:15:08] Oh Come unto me all you do a heavily
[1:15:11] Laden and I'll give you rest or do you
[1:15:15] need rest this morning oh do you need
[1:15:18] guidance this morning he's here to lead
[1:15:20] you this morning oh to lead you oh to
[1:15:24] your trial through your tests through
[1:15:27] your Wilderness through the dry places
[1:15:30] he's here to lead this morning oh
[1:15:33] Hallelujah I'll follow leave me Lord
[1:15:37] I'll call you have called me and I will
[1:15:40] answer the call this morning oh how many
[1:15:43] want to be led
[1:15:45] I caught this morning
[1:15:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:51] amen so I have
[1:15:54] kind of two I kind of split it into two
[1:15:56] the thought today
[1:15:58] talking about in authority and under
[1:16:01] Authority yeah so we're gonna look at
[1:16:03] leadership in two ways in that sense and
[1:16:07] of course to be under Authority is to be
[1:16:09] under God
[1:16:11] is your leader right so if you're under
[1:16:13] Authority then you're under the
[1:16:15] leadership of God you're under his
[1:16:18] command
[1:16:19] amen and if you're in Authority then I
[1:16:22] mean God give you Authority and God
[1:16:25] makes somewhat of a leader out of you
[1:16:27] yourself
[1:16:29] then you are carrying the light that he
[1:16:31] has imparted to you as a leader in Your
[1:16:34] Capacity and you are leading others to
[1:16:37] that same Christ to that same word to
[1:16:40] that same Jesus isn't that right praise
[1:16:43] God so you want to look at it like that
[1:16:44] at the end
[1:16:45] and so on Amen so let's go leadership is
[1:16:49] very important it's a very important
[1:16:51] part of our life's journey
[1:16:53] amen I believe that with all my heart
[1:16:56] and almost everything about who we are
[1:16:58] and what we do and the choices we make
[1:17:00] and the atmosphere we create around us
[1:17:03] and what we allow to inspire action
[1:17:07] involves leadership
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:11] and we can see that the purpose of God
[1:17:13] since the beginning
[1:17:15] was the established leadership
[1:17:18] himself
[1:17:23] then as you keep coming down he created
[1:17:25] angels He created the Earth and
[1:17:26] everything else there coming all the way
[1:17:28] down to Creation itself
[1:17:30] coming all the way down to a man itself
[1:17:32] then he established man as a leader over
[1:17:35] the Earth
[1:17:36] isn't that right a man in his own image
[1:17:40] I like this a creature isn't that right
[1:17:42] to reflect him because the monkey didn't
[1:17:45] look like him the trees didn't look like
[1:17:47] him praise God the sky the sea something
[1:17:50] had to reflect him on Earth
[1:17:52] to manage this this this this Earthly
[1:17:55] realm that he had created this domain
[1:17:57] that he had created it needed a leader
[1:17:59] praise God and God establish a son
[1:18:03] praise God and said have dominion he
[1:18:06] gave this man Spirit man in the
[1:18:08] beginning Genesis one man he said have
[1:18:11] dominion over every creeping thing over
[1:18:14] every fall of the air over every fish of
[1:18:17] the sea and over everything that creeped
[1:18:19] upon the Earth he gave that man no
[1:18:21] minion he gave that man leadership
[1:18:24] by position
[1:18:26] by Authority
[1:18:28] and of course he had the character in
[1:18:30] nature like gone
[1:18:32] you see but this leadership was given
[1:18:36] you see
[1:18:37] he never did what we are going through
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] coming through all these hard stuff
[1:18:44] and having the world toss us about to
[1:18:46] and fro he didn't have to go through all
[1:18:48] of that as yet
[1:18:50] you see it was just given to him this
[1:18:54] Authority and this power and even in
[1:18:57] that condition we see that man fail
[1:19:00] it's not right please go any man praise
[1:19:04] God so don't feel too terrible this
[1:19:06] morning you made a mistake he was a man
[1:19:07] given a position
[1:19:09] and he fell from that estate but God
[1:19:11] promised to restore us
[1:19:13] he promised to bring us back
[1:19:15] to a place of power to a place of
[1:19:18] authority but this time he's going to
[1:19:20] establish leadership
[1:19:22] he's gonna she's gonna lead you and he's
[1:19:25] gonna make you a leader yourself praise
[1:19:27] God so that you could lead by example oh
[1:19:31] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen
[1:19:34] amen isn't that right
[1:19:36] so it could be the right kind of a
[1:19:38] leader amen because if we see in today's
[1:19:41] world there's a lack of leadership
[1:19:44] there's a lack of genuine leadership
[1:19:47] amen isn't that right
[1:19:49] people who are willing to go the extra
[1:19:51] mile
[1:19:52] praise God willing to see the problems
[1:19:54] that are out there and find a way to fix
[1:19:57] them
[1:19:58] amen isn't that right and to make it
[1:20:00] better create a better system amen
[1:20:02] that's what it's all about so since the
[1:20:04] beginning we see that God wanted
[1:20:05] establish this right
[1:20:07] so leadership then actually isn't about
[1:20:10] position
[1:20:12] it's not about power
[1:20:14] it's about the ability to act in a
[1:20:16] positive way
[1:20:17] that uses the powers or abilities that
[1:20:20] one possesses in order to advance a
[1:20:23] cause to pursue a vision or to achieve
[1:20:28] an objective
[1:20:29] okay that's what leadership is praise
[1:20:33] God it's not right so because the truth
[1:20:35] is any one of us can be a leader
[1:20:37] at any level
[1:20:39] a parent can be a leader
[1:20:42] student can be a leader
[1:20:43] a teacher can be a leader a policeman
[1:20:46] can be a leader a prisoner
[1:20:49] can still be a leader
[1:20:51] in his environment
[1:20:52] he has the ability he can create a
[1:20:55] positive environment around him
[1:20:58] so your environment doesn't necessarily
[1:21:00] have to declare how you behave and act
[1:21:01] you could take up the the the the mantle
[1:21:05] you can choose to be somebody that
[1:21:09] influences others in a positive way
[1:21:11] isn't that right
[1:21:13] even Joseph was a leader when he went to
[1:21:16] prison
[1:21:16] amen he acted and behaved in a way that
[1:21:20] gave him a certain level of recognition
[1:21:22] to the point where he became one of the
[1:21:24] head of the of the people in the in the
[1:21:26] in the prison cells there isn't that
[1:21:28] right he was going around feeding
[1:21:30] different prisoners and they were so
[1:21:32] confident in his abilities praise God
[1:21:34] that they Place him in a position of
[1:21:36] leadership
[1:21:37] because he acted in a transparent way
[1:21:40] that brought all of the all everything
[1:21:42] together all that he had learned all
[1:21:44] that God had taught him all that he was
[1:21:47] praise God isn't that right
[1:21:50] amen see so we find leadership in
[1:21:54] different positions see so uh because
[1:21:57] there are people in in higher powers of
[1:21:59] society
[1:22:00] who aren't leaders at all
[1:22:03] you know we do what they tell us because
[1:22:06] they might have power over us but
[1:22:08] they're not very good leaders
[1:22:10] isn't that right
[1:22:12] they don't possess the qualities of true
[1:22:15] leadership
[1:22:17] so this leadership thing is really
[1:22:19] important
[1:22:20] and really truly when you look at the
[1:22:22] Bible and you see how God acts and
[1:22:26] behaves and we see his motive his
[1:22:28] objective his nature and how he treats
[1:22:32] with others and how he speaks to others
[1:22:35] uh and how he expresses himself we see
[1:22:39] the true traits of a genuine leader
[1:22:43] in God Almighty isn't that right
[1:22:46] uh Matthew 15 7 I want to read this here
[1:22:50] uh Jesus uh
[1:22:53] then came his disciples and saying unto
[1:22:55] him so Jesus would just finish blasting
[1:22:57] the Pharisees
[1:22:59] um you know concerned in the washing of
[1:23:01] hands and pots and stuff like that so
[1:23:03] they said no it's down uh that the
[1:23:05] Pharisees were offended after they heard
[1:23:07] the same
[1:23:08] and he said and he answered and said but
[1:23:11] every plant
[1:23:12] which my heavenly father
[1:23:14] hath not planted
[1:23:16] shall be rooted up
[1:23:18] he said let them alone they be blind
[1:23:22] leaders of the blind
[1:23:23] and if the blind lead the blind
[1:23:26] boat shall fall into the ditch yeah
[1:23:29] isn't that right
[1:23:31] so the people are suffering for a lack
[1:23:33] of leadership
[1:23:34] and the leaders need a vision to cling
[1:23:37] to because without a vision of people
[1:23:38] perish you see so we thank God for our

[1:27:27] excuse me man oh praise God are you
[1:27:29] loving this morning amen
[1:27:31] Hallelujah
[1:27:32] just an encouragement this morning amen
[1:27:35] yes sir
[1:27:37] so that's the vision
[1:27:39] and we're looking too
[1:27:41] and Jesus made a way for this to come to
[1:27:43] pass
[1:27:44] to the Cross he bridged the gap
[1:27:47] bring us back into himself
[1:27:49] God's Gonna reconcile you back to
[1:27:51] himself
[1:27:52] praise God because we are lost
[1:27:55] Adam who had the first estate God
[1:27:57] established him as a leader he fell from
[1:27:59] that
[1:28:00] he didn't have the
[1:28:02] the
[1:28:03] you know he didn't uh he didn't do the
[1:28:06] right things to continue his leadership
[1:28:08] so we just fell through isn't that right
[1:28:10] but God knew all things
[1:28:12] and he put all things in place and and
[1:28:15] even though the title he acts the title
[1:28:17] deed to the Earth
[1:28:18] the devil wanted to grab it
[1:28:21] when it left Adam's hand he wanted to
[1:28:23] grab it on his way up
[1:28:24] but his hands were too slippery
[1:28:26] he doesn't have the character or the
[1:28:29] nature that it takes a beer a real kind
[1:28:32] of a leader so it went back to their
[1:28:33] hands to the original leader uh which is
[1:28:36] which is God Almighty man which is the
[1:28:38] one on the throne waiting for the time
[1:28:41] that we could be reconciled where we
[1:28:44] could take back the leadership take back
[1:28:46] the control Take Back The Authority
[1:28:48] praise God hallelujah of the sons of God
[1:28:51] on the earth isn't that right
[1:28:53] oh my isn't that right praise God so God
[1:28:57] is concerned about who we are it's not
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:59] because Who We Are
[1:29:01] is how we lead
[1:29:04] say that again
[1:29:05] who we are is how we lead
[1:29:09] ership is tied to the individual
[1:29:14] it's tied to the character
[1:29:16] it's tied to the person
[1:29:18] so because that is that way God is very
[1:29:20] concerned
[1:29:21] about Who We Are
[1:29:24] because on our nature and how we conduct
[1:29:26] ourselves our Behavior our attitude
[1:29:29] because power without character is
[1:29:31] satanic
[1:29:33] amen it's not right
[1:29:34] and he's very concerned about us because
[1:29:37] if we not in the right place
[1:29:40] in our hearts and our minds we can
[1:29:42] really mess things up
[1:29:44] all right
[1:29:45] let's read a quote here from the prophet
[1:29:47] Simon and church age Prophet said unless
[1:29:49] we suffer with him
[1:29:51] we cannot reign with him
[1:29:54] he said you have to suffer oh my
[1:29:57] God this is big this is not conflicts
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:00] you have to suffer to rain
[1:30:04] the reason for this is that character
[1:30:07] simply is never made without suffering
[1:30:11] hey
[1:30:12] glory to God you gotta suffer to make it
[1:30:16] you gotta go through something praise
[1:30:19] God honey you gotta compare the marks of
[1:30:22] past experiences that taught you how to

[1:30:35] you've been through something
[1:30:37] that was real
[1:30:40] this cars remind us
[1:30:43] that the past is real
[1:30:45] that you went through something
[1:30:47] when Jesus appeared to his disciples he
[1:30:49] said look at my hands
[1:30:51] look at my feet
[1:30:53] touch me handle me see that it is I
[1:30:55] Jesus
[1:30:57] I died I suffered but I also rose again
[1:31:02] I am victorious oh Hallelujah and I made
[1:31:06] it and because he made it you're gonna
[1:31:09] make it too oh he came back as a witness
[1:31:12] oh to show you that you are gonna make
[1:31:15] it and even as my father had sent me
[1:31:18] even so sin are you go and preach the
[1:31:22] gospel see it's them compel them my

[1:31:35] amen
[1:31:37] Glory

[1:31:41] experience
[1:31:43] he went through something
[1:31:44] it was real
[1:31:46] but he come out to testify to let them
[1:31:49] know that I'm alive
[1:31:50] that I made it through the pain that I
[1:31:53] made it past the cross Jesus told his
[1:31:55] own disciples he said a servant is no
[1:31:58] greater than his Lord so he said if I
[1:32:02] hated the world hated me then they're
[1:32:05] gonna hate you also
[1:32:06] but he said don't you worry not a hand
[1:32:09] your head shall be touched oh Hallelujah
[1:32:12] I will give you a mouth to speak and you
[1:32:15] will speak my wisdom and confound them
[1:32:18] that are wise oh hallelujah hallelujah

[1:32:24] put his glory in you as a witness oh
[1:32:28] Hallelujah of his resurrection
[1:32:30] his resurrection power
[1:32:32] that it is true I am a true witness and
[1:32:36] that's what we need in this message not
[1:32:38] too much talk people saying all kinds of
[1:32:41] stuff people making up all kinds of
[1:32:43] stuff forget about it praise God
[1:32:45] hallelujah we're not here to make up
[1:32:47] anything

[1:32:56] die we are supposed to be slain we are
[1:32:59] supposed to be hanging across like he
[1:33:01] did but he took our place so that we

[2:02:08] to help you get what you're looking for
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:13] a real leader is fully persuaded
[2:02:15] and really they will risk his own life
[2:02:17] for others it's not right
[2:02:19] look at Moses
[2:02:21] when God wants to judge the people God
[2:02:23] throw himself in front
[2:02:24] and said no no take me instead
[2:02:28] that's a real leader
[2:02:29] he acted out like Christ would
[2:02:32] amen when he came on a cross and he died
[2:02:34] taking on the sins of man
[2:02:36] did the same thing what was it
[2:02:38] christ-like
[2:02:39] leadership amen leaders go first Into
[2:02:44] the Danger
[2:02:45] praise God hallelujah just like David
[2:02:46] praise God hallelujah said who is this
[2:02:49] uncircumcised Philistine they will not
[2:02:50] wait for anybody to do it you know they
[2:02:52] would have went get went and get five
[2:02:54] smooth stones and fill his little script
[2:02:56] Pride he going down to meet the enemy on
[2:02:59] any ground he comes upon why because God
[2:03:02] had trained David
[2:03:04] on the back side of the desert
[2:03:06] he might have been a mighty warrior he
[2:03:09] might not know how to handle a sword but
[2:03:11] he was trained by God and he saw a
[2:03:14] picture God taught him through his
[2:03:17] backside of the Wilderness experience to
[2:03:19] his desert experience a little boy
[2:03:22] dressed in dear skin and playing a harp
[2:03:25] didn't look like much but God was with
[2:03:28] him or teaching him how to fight the
[2:03:30] bear teaching them how to fight the lion
[2:03:33] teaching them how to take care of his
[2:03:35] sheep oh how to be a good shepherd
[2:03:39] that's what it takes
[2:03:42] to be a great leader
[2:03:44] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:47] no wonder a man like that
[2:03:49] could become king
[2:03:50] over Israel is that right
[2:03:53] it was taught how to lead by the best
[2:03:55] leader we know how
[2:03:56] God himself
[2:03:58] isn't that right
[2:03:59] amen leadership inspires pulse amen
[2:04:02] praise God
[2:04:04] leadership understands civitude
[2:04:07] not self-service
[2:04:09] but service others
[2:04:11] focuses on the solutions and not the
[2:04:14] problem
[2:04:15] it's not
[2:04:16] a good leader listens is that right
[2:04:19] Jesus said he doesn't keep on my
[2:04:21] Commandments and do with them he it is
[2:04:22] that love with me not just hear him but
[2:04:25] you're doing something about it you're
[2:04:27] listening willing to learn willing to
[2:04:30] put what you've been taught into action
[2:04:32] to get a result
[2:04:34] good result a good report
[2:04:37] that's a leader amen always willing to
[2:04:40] learn
[2:04:41] could be 99 years old
[2:04:43] still willing to learn something new
[2:04:45] that's right that's a real leader
[2:04:48] one of the most important things is that
[2:04:50] they understand their Rule and function
[2:04:53] and they understand what part they play
[2:04:55] in the program of things
[2:04:57] so they're really knows how to do that
[2:05:00] because they understand what their part
[2:05:02] does for the overall achievement of the
[2:05:04] vision objective of what is trying to be
[2:05:07] achieved isn't that right understand how
[2:05:09] they fit in
[2:05:10] and make the most of the time that is
[2:05:13] given to them
[2:05:14] to play their part
[2:05:16] that's what a leader is Luther played
[2:05:19] his part he was a leader when he saw
[2:05:22] that the people who didn't were ignorant
[2:05:23] or did not know of the great promise of
[2:05:25] God for their day he ripped a page out
[2:05:27] of the Bible and marched down the road
[2:05:30] that morning with a nail and a hammer in
[2:05:31] his hand and he pounded a note upon the
[2:05:34] upon the uh and upon the church door
[2:05:36] it's not right upon the door praise God
[2:05:38] the just shall live by Fate praise God
[2:05:41] let the whole world know praise God what
[2:05:43] God is saying here pray God what God is
[2:05:46] revealing here pray God he's convinced
[2:05:49] he was concerned or not only for himself
[2:05:52] but for the people and he preached a
[2:05:55] message and he preached them praise God
[2:05:58] out of that Catholicism praise God into
[2:06:00] the new move that God was moving which
[2:06:03] justification and there came a people
[2:06:05] out under that leader oh Hallelujah
[2:06:08] under the messenger oh Hallelujah and
[2:06:11] they lived justification and they did
[2:06:14] what they were supposed to do and they
[2:06:16] played their parts unlike a great relay
[2:06:19] race when their part was finished
[2:06:22] and handed over to Wesley and he played
[2:06:25] his part and he ran his race and he said
[2:06:28] you might not only Justified but
[2:06:32] you must live a Sanibel life amen you
[2:06:35] must never signify life clean up your
[2:06:37] act clean up your life clean up your
[2:06:39] house clean up your spirits get all the
[2:06:43] trash out get all the stuff out of here
[2:06:45] prepare yourself to be a tabernacle for
[2:06:48] the most holy God most holy God be a
[2:06:51] dwelling place oh Hallelujah and the
[2:06:53] people are so Sanctified oh Hallelujah
[2:06:56] that the Holy Spirit wanted to come upon
[2:06:57] them because they were playing their
[2:06:59] part oh hallelujah hallelujah they run
[2:07:03] their race and when they finish running
[2:07:05] the race the battle was handed over to
[2:07:07] the Pentecostals and here they come
[2:07:09] praying staying in the atmosphere
[2:07:12] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ not
[2:07:14] the same promise he gave to Peter and
[2:07:16] Paul and Mary and the apostles on them
[2:07:18] he could give to them also that same
[2:07:21] Penny you shall receive the gift of the
[2:07:23] Holy Ghost and they prayed all night and
[2:07:26] they wept and they prayed and they cried
[2:07:29] until they started a Revival until Holy
[2:07:33] Ghost compound oh and they ran to hear
[2:07:36] and they ran there or they were
[2:07:38] persecuted but they kept on running and
[2:07:40] as they run the fire spread the fire
[2:07:43] spread it kept spreading the devil
[2:07:46] couldn't stop it it was too late God had
[2:07:49] already started his great relay race
[2:07:52] hallelujah oh do you believe it this
[2:07:55] morning
[2:08:00] over to William Marion Branham and that
[2:08:03] might Eagle Prophet stood there and said

[2:08:28] manifests he went through trials he lost

[2:08:50] down now we gotta keep running gotta
[2:08:53] keep pressing gotta keep praying gotta

[2:09:24] we have to understand our rule
[2:09:26] prophets preached light and said
[2:09:27] recognize your day and its message
[2:09:30] recognize your day
[2:09:32] recognize your message
[2:09:34] then go and not just go but go and tell
[2:09:37] something
[2:09:38] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:09:40] forever that Messiah is on the earth now
[2:09:43] fixing things around for the coming of
[2:09:45] the Lord and at that time a voice I've
[2:09:48] got to be in you a little anoint
[2:09:50] revelation 22 17 the spirit on the
[2:09:53] battle say come come to your loved ones

[2:10:13] can we take some more amen I I don't
[2:10:15] want to be too long with you yeah
[2:10:17] stretch you out too much
[2:10:19] but there's just so much here and I just
[2:10:20] want to get the mean thing things in and
[2:10:22] then we could shout and praise again
[2:10:24] but he's gone amen so a few things about
[2:10:26] bad leadership see they obsessed with
[2:10:29] power
[2:10:29] see they love to control they focus on
[2:10:32] problems and not the solution
[2:10:35] they had the flip side focus on the
[2:10:37] solution the bad leaders focus on the
[2:10:39] problem too much see
[2:10:41] love recognition but they don't give it
[2:10:44] back
[2:10:45] love to be respected
[2:10:47] but they don't return it
[2:10:49] suffer from
[2:10:51] but over entitlement
[2:10:53] they have entitlement syndrome
[2:10:55] I kind of coined that phrase
[2:10:59] I feel like I believe I believe this
[2:11:01] belongs to me see they have a false
[2:11:04] sense of permanence
[2:11:06] always this is weird psychotic thing
[2:11:08] that happens with crazy leaders they
[2:11:10] always feel like they're supposed to be
[2:11:11] there forever
[2:11:13] yeah if they could transplant their
[2:11:15] brain and a heart into a new body
[2:11:17] it's our 21 year old body they would do
[2:11:18] it
[2:11:19] to live 70 years longer you know
[2:11:23] yeah
[2:11:24] it's just weird it's so
[2:11:28] it's crazy
[2:11:29] they just
[2:11:30] they obsess
[2:11:32] with permanence feel as though it's
[2:11:34] supposed to be like that for all the
[2:11:35] time
[2:11:37] not knowing that like yeah you don't
[2:11:40] have much time left
[2:11:46] you have a number of days
[2:11:48] and then that's it
[2:11:50] regardless of where you reach at that
[2:11:52] point you have to stop
[2:11:55] it's finite
[2:12:03] insurance no
[2:12:06] it's finished
[2:12:09] the game is finished out
[2:12:11] and normally what they do with that game
[2:12:12] is that they take all the dice they take
[2:12:13] all the cards and they pack it up in a
[2:12:15] box
[2:12:16] foreign
[2:12:17] box away
[2:12:19] okay the game is over
[2:12:21] everything they put it in a box nice
[2:12:23] little box
[2:12:25] fit perfectly three frame to put
[2:12:27] everything in
[2:12:29] the game is done finish everybody going
[2:12:32] home people take a little box of food
[2:12:34] and they're going home the game is
[2:12:35] finished
[2:12:39] so what what what race are you running
[2:12:40] this morning
[2:12:42] Hallelujah we got all these natural
[2:12:43] things they're gonna fade away
[2:12:45] that's why we've got a thing that cannot
[2:12:47] change
[2:12:48] everything around us changes but God
[2:12:50] Remains the Same he says I'm God and I
[2:12:53] change not and what he required for
[2:12:55] Moses he cried for Abraham he cried for
[2:12:58] Paul Peter who requires the same of you
[2:13:00] this morning a surrender life oh
[2:13:03] dedicated to God that is what could
[2:13:05] bring Jesus Christ into present tense
[2:13:09] amen amen do you believe it praise God
[2:13:12] one more thing here bad leaders they
[2:13:14] stand to win whole informational
[2:13:15] Knowledge from others in an effort to
[2:13:17] retain power
[2:13:18] I I find that really amazing and even
[2:13:22] you see it sometimes in a message world
[2:13:25] or something you know and then sometimes
[2:13:26] somebody would bring
[2:13:28] sometimes they bring a complicated thing
[2:13:30] and you wonder
[2:13:32] should I brought her uh should I have
[2:13:34] brought the checkered line copy book The
[2:13:35] Church
[2:13:36] to figure out what is being said I mean
[2:13:40] when God is trying to make it so simple
[2:13:43] because at the end of the day when you
[2:13:45] get this vision and you read it it's
[2:13:47] supposed to have one action
[2:13:49] you suppose he wasn't running
[2:13:51] to be able to run is not walking walking
[2:13:54] is one thing
[2:13:55] but to run means you have confidence
[2:13:58] Just Like Old David ran to me Goliath
[2:14:01] when you see a vision that inspires you
[2:14:03] to run then that Vision had to be made
[2:14:06] plain it had to be so simple that our
[2:14:10] baby could understand it because when
[2:14:12] you see it you have to be able to run
[2:14:15] to run this race oh and to seek his face
[2:14:19] and to turn aside from everything else
[2:14:22] every other distraction but Paul said
[2:14:25] lay aside every witch that so easily
[2:14:28] beset us and run the race with patience
[2:14:31] the race that is set before us oh
[2:14:35] Hallelujah
[2:14:37] [Applause]
[2:14:40] you see so it's interesting yeah man
[2:14:43] sometimes you see it in the workplace
[2:14:44] sometimes somebody teaching somebody
[2:14:46] yeah but they're telling them you know
[2:14:48] hyperbole you'll do something and the
[2:14:50] existential crisis of the
[2:14:52] and you can tell that they don't want to
[2:14:54] impart knowledge to the younger ones
[2:14:55] because they feel as though they're
[2:14:57] coming to take their job
[2:14:58] but a true leader knows how to empower
[2:15:00] others how to help others how to build
[2:15:03] others up how to share the light so that
[2:15:06] others can have it too because some when
[2:15:08] he's a little down maybe he could go to
[2:15:10] somebody else and get a little life for
[2:15:12] the journey because he shared his light
[2:15:14] he could get it back when it makes the
[2:15:17] full circle when it comes back around
[2:15:19] again
[2:15:22] this morning
[2:15:24] spread the gospel freely as you have
[2:15:27] received freely give and that's the
[2:15:30] Gospel of Jesus Amen
[2:15:32] amen amen so we are what we consistently
[2:15:34] do
[2:15:36] we have to be consistent
[2:15:38] about it not intense but consistent
[2:15:40] intensity is when you have a problem and
[2:15:42] you fight to solve it
[2:15:43] you spend two days fighting solve the
[2:15:45] problem as soon as you finish fighting
[2:15:47] solve any problem you go down to default
[2:15:49] mode
[2:15:50] what you used to do before the problem
[2:15:52] arise not so yes that's human nature but
[2:15:57] consistency
[2:15:59] behavioral habits amen that's what we
[2:16:02] want to form and if we form good habits
[2:16:04] praise God we can continuously do good
[2:16:07] things
[2:16:08] consistently and I genuinely believe
[2:16:11] that God wants consistency with our
[2:16:13] spiritual on daily living
[2:16:15] and daily practice oh is that right Paul
[2:16:19] said in Corinthians that I Die daily
[2:16:21] daily doing the will of God isn't that
[2:16:23] right and if we have profitable days
[2:16:25] then we can have profitable weeks if you
[2:16:28] have profitable weeks get our profitable
[2:16:29] months if we have profitable months we
[2:16:32] get our profitable years and if we have
[2:16:34] profitable years we can live a
[2:16:36] profitable life
[2:16:37] amen
[2:16:39] amen you could be a profitable servant
[2:16:41] praise God hallelujah amen who spent his
[2:16:44] Masters treasure with usury and gave
[2:16:46] interests amen isn't that right oh my
[2:16:49] see so God is an authority we honor his
[2:16:52] authority and I'm still gonna wrap this
[2:16:53] up here in about 10 minutes
[2:16:54] but he's gone under his Rule and under
[2:16:56] his leadership even the highest person
[2:16:59] in the land is under God
[2:17:01] isn't that right we believe that see
[2:17:03] Colossians 1 16 18 says for by him were
[2:17:06] all things created that are in heaven
[2:17:08] and that are in Earth visible and
[2:17:10] invisible
[2:17:11] isn't that right it's the word here said
[2:17:13] whether they be troons or dominions or
[2:17:17] principalities or Powers all things were
[2:17:20] created by Him
[2:17:22] and before it hit and he is before all
[2:17:25] things and by him all things consist
[2:17:29] and he is the head of the body the
[2:17:32] church who is the beginning the
[2:17:34] firstborn from the dead that in all
[2:17:37] things he might have preeminence isn't
[2:17:41] that right you believe it this morning
[2:17:42] amen Prophet said he own respects he
[2:17:45] said if you can't respect a man respect
[2:17:47] the office he holds in God that's
[2:17:50] exactly right he said see respect him if
[2:17:53] a minister comes up you're a pastor he
[2:17:56] said always respect him isn't that right
[2:17:59] and this respect is not only for the
[2:18:01] pastor now goes both ways see but uh the
[2:18:05] Bible said here Psalms 130 138 number
[2:18:08] six says though the Lord be high
[2:18:11] yet he had respect unto the lowly
[2:18:15] but the proud he knoweth afarov
[2:18:17] isn't that right on respect again the
[2:18:19] prophet said
[2:18:20] Ecclesiastes the 12th Chapter 13 Verse
[2:18:23] it's written like this he said see Let
[2:18:25] Us hear the conclusion of the whole
[2:18:26] matter he said fear God
[2:18:29] and keep his Commandments for this is
[2:18:32] the full duty of man
[2:18:34] the conclusion of the whole Mata is to
[2:18:37] fear God
[2:18:38] and when you cannot have his he said you
[2:18:40] cannot have respects until you have fear
[2:18:44] said you've got to have to fear God see
[2:18:46] Solomon said also in Proverbs that the
[2:18:49] fear of God is the beginning of wisdom
[2:18:53] the fear of God is the beginning of
[2:18:55] wisdom said no that don't mean that
[2:18:58] you're afraid of him Prophet said he
[2:19:00] said but that means that you're giving
[2:19:01] him respects
[2:19:03] and reverence
[2:19:05] when you respect God you fear God you
[2:19:09] fear that you might displease him in
[2:19:11] some way you fear that you would lest
[2:19:13] you do something wrong that you wouldn't
[2:19:14] want to see no hear this part this is a
[2:19:16] bomb no because he said I fear my mother
[2:19:19] I fear my my wife he said I fear my
[2:19:23] church
[2:19:24] I fear all of God's servants
[2:19:28] unless I should put a stumbling block
[2:19:32] somewhere in their way he said I fear
[2:19:36] the people
[2:19:37] oh wow
[2:19:39] what a prophet
[2:19:41] what humility
[2:19:43] you hearing is here now he said I fear
[2:19:45] the people of the city unless I should
[2:19:47] hear do I should do something wrong that
[2:19:50] would cause them to think that I wasn't
[2:19:52] a Christian
[2:19:53] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what
[2:19:56] a respects huh praise God Amen what a
[2:19:59] respect you see somebody doing something
[2:20:00] we respect them in the office praise God
[2:20:03] we respect them for what they're doing
[2:20:04] for the kingdom of God isn't that right
[2:20:06] if I see somebody cleaning the carpet
[2:20:08] downstairs after church respect that
[2:20:11] brother say brother can I pass around
[2:20:12] but is it okay can I pass here always

[2:23:16] praise God all right getting ready to
[2:23:18] wrap up here
[2:23:20] wow what a run amen oh man just a few
[2:23:24] more leadership see Prophet saying 965
[2:23:27] he said remember that the first step in
[2:23:29] the universe made somebody let us your
[2:23:31] mother's your mothers remember the first
[2:23:33] steps that Junior the little bill made
[2:23:34] they don't remember it no more but
[2:23:36] somebody LED you to your first step
[2:23:39] Prophet said I remember when Billy Paul
[2:23:40] made a full step Joseph and all of them
[2:23:43] when they made their first step he said
[2:23:45] it's usually a mother that gets to lead
[2:23:46] the children to its footsteps usually
[2:23:48] because she's home while the dad is not
[2:23:50] working trying to make a living but it's
[2:23:53] when they made the first step at night
[2:23:54] time Daddy come home said he said oh Dad
[2:23:56] see Johnny and Mary little boy can walk
[2:23:58] little girl can walk see come and look
[2:24:00] and so on like that says
[2:24:02] he said no he said no somebody somebody
[2:24:05] helped you when you made your first step
[2:24:07] and he said and your last step that you
[2:24:10] ever make in this life somebody will be
[2:24:12] leading you see that's right I want you
[2:24:15] to remember that Prophet said your first
[2:24:17] step somebody LED you is that on your
[2:24:19] last step somebody will be leading you
[2:24:22] we have to be led you know he said God
[2:24:24] likened us unto sheep and did you know a
[2:24:27] sheep can't lead itself
[2:24:29] he'll wander away and stray away he just
[2:24:32] can't lead himself so he has to have
[2:24:34] somebody to lead him and sometimes the
[2:24:37] shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep
[2:24:38] and now that was back in the days of
[2:24:40] Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd
[2:24:43] he said but today you see we're living
[2:24:44] in another day and everything is changed
[2:24:46] and perverted
[2:24:48] is that right he said you know what man
[2:24:49] has to lead the Sheep today he said a
[2:24:51] goat he said you know where that goat
[2:24:53] leaves them right into the slaughter
[2:24:56] them little sheep don't know where
[2:24:57] they're going so the goat goes up into
[2:25:00] the pen of the slaughter and the Sheep
[2:25:02] don't know no more than to follow a
[2:25:04] leader so it just leads them right up
[2:25:07] into the slaughter and then the goat
[2:25:09] jumps over the track and the ship goes
[2:25:12] in and gets killed oh Hallelujah you see
[2:25:15] and he says see the goat a wrong leader
[2:25:17] amen so be very careful this morning who
[2:25:20] and what is leading you
[2:25:22] praise God what are you being influenced
[2:25:24] by is it influence on above or is it
[2:25:27] influence From Below judge it by the
[2:25:29] word of God
[2:25:31] how many men judge it by the word of God
[2:25:32] whether what kind of influence you're
[2:25:34] under what kind of leadership you're
[2:25:36] under amen Saint John 10 he said very
[2:25:38] nice saying to you he that entered not
[2:25:39] in by the door into the Sheepfold but
[2:25:41] climb it up some other way the same is a
[2:25:43] thief and a robber but he that enter in
[2:25:46] by the door
[2:25:48] is The Shepherd of the Sheep
[2:25:50] and to him the portal openeth and the
[2:25:54] sheep hear his voice
[2:25:55] and he calleth his own Sheep by name and
[2:25:59] lead them out and when he put it for his
[2:26:02] own sheep he good before them and the
[2:26:04] Sheep follow him because they know his
[2:26:07] voice oh a stranger's voice they will
[2:26:11] not follow they will flee from him for
[2:26:14] they know not the voice of strangers oh
[2:26:16] we have not followed a voice of a man
[2:26:18] this morning but we have been following
[2:26:20] the voice of our master of our Lord
[2:26:23] Jesus Christ who is the Good Shepherd
[2:26:26] and he loves you this morning and his
[2:26:29] voice is calling you home his voice is
[2:26:32] calling you to Healing his voice is
[2:26:35] calling you to Deliverance his voice is
[2:26:38] calling you to Restoration his voice is
[2:26:41] calling you to the Holy Ghost his voice
[2:26:43] is calling you this morning oh the day
[2:26:46] you hear my voice how to nod your hearts
[2:26:49] as in the provocation in the wilderness
[2:26:52] oh don't be like that now we're tempted
[2:26:54] but the day is voice Harden at your
[2:26:57] hearts hearken to his voice this morning
[2:27:00] and he had a Shepherd calling you this
[2:27:03] morning
[2:27:04] oh Hallelujah musician can get ready to
[2:27:07] call me man I'm getting to close out
[2:27:10] hey many men I watched a video one time
[2:27:12] of a man they said they had a whole
[2:27:14] bunch of sheep out there and they got
[2:27:15] people to go and call the Sheep
[2:27:17] people went to the heckling
[2:27:19] sheep scholarship
[2:27:21] nothing
[2:27:22] they didn't even look up
[2:27:24] this bad whatever
[2:27:27] but as soon as the Shepherd come he gave
[2:27:29] us a call
[2:27:30] yeah
[2:27:33] and all of them just sat around
[2:27:36] and come straight in front of him
[2:27:39] the Good Shepherd
[2:27:41] they know his voice
[2:27:43] and that's what God's voice is to us
[2:27:46] the devil has come come come come and
[2:27:49] look at this come and look at that come
[2:27:51] and get distracted come and look at this
[2:27:52] but we can't hear that praise God no no
[2:27:54] no no we've received a seed we're
[2:27:57] already impregnated with something
[2:27:59] something more than gold in our soul
[2:28:03] there's something in us this morning
[2:28:05] something brought you to church
[2:28:07] something brought you to that trial
[2:28:09] something brought you to that test
[2:28:12] something brought you to that
[2:28:13] persecution and though the devil tried
[2:28:15] to sift you like wheat oh but something
[2:28:18] in your heart like a stream running down
[2:28:22] it makes me feel so happy as happy as I
[2:28:25] can be and when I think about Jesus and
[2:28:29] all that is done for me oh I know
[2:28:32] something in my heart something is what
[2:28:34] holding the reins there's something
[2:28:37] within me oh that's a hole in the reins
[2:28:40] it's Jesus Jesus and my soul and oh I've
[2:28:46] touched the aim of his comments and his
[2:28:49] blood had made me whole I have a reason
[2:28:53] to shout I have a reason to lift my
[2:28:55] hands I have a reason to worship God
[2:28:58] this morning I Heard a Voice
[2:29:00] of the master the Good Shepherd and he
[2:29:04] is calling me home he is calling you
[2:29:07] home this morning home home never more
[2:29:11] to Rome oh hallelujah hallelujah

[2:29:20] hallelujah
[2:29:21] amen and amen praise God hallelujah but
[2:29:26] he that is in a higher link see bad bad
[2:29:28] leadership
[2:29:29] and not the shepherd whose own cheapest
[2:29:31] are not seen the World Cup and leave at
[2:29:33] the sheep and flee it and the Wolf
[2:29:35] captured them and Scattered them the
[2:29:37] Highland flee because he's a hireling
[2:29:39] and careth not for the Sheep Jesus said
[2:29:42] I am the Good Shepherd and I know my
[2:29:44] sheep and they are known of mine amen
[2:29:48] and amen praise God you're gonna get
[2:29:49] placed on Me Softly and get ready to
[2:29:51] move out here now
[2:29:53] amen so God is our leader and he wants
[2:29:56] to make leaders out of us it's not right
[2:30:00] I'll read something from adoption set
[2:30:01] adoption the truth is supposed to be
[2:30:02] predestinated onto the adoption of
[2:30:04] children where man God could take a man
[2:30:06] and adopt him into the family give him
[2:30:09] something
[2:30:09] that and first try that after he given
[2:30:13] something he said try it and see if it
[2:30:16] is right
[2:30:17] this is the approach you know
[2:30:18] the Bible said try the spirit
[2:30:21] this man claims a certain thing try it
[2:30:23] see if it's right and if it says right
[2:30:25] then move right with it then say Lord
[2:30:28] send us something else because he's
[2:30:30] leading you you're moving you're not
[2:30:33] standing still he said send us some more
[2:30:34] he said and just keep moving you see
[2:30:36] just keep moving
[2:30:38] until every fella take his place
[2:30:41] then you're going to see the Church of
[2:30:42] God begin to get into his place
[2:30:44] when the Philistines will go to backing
[2:30:46] up
[2:30:47] the shocks will go off
[2:30:49] hair will grow down
[2:30:51] faces will be washed cigars would be
[2:30:54] missing that's right oh Hallelujah then
[2:30:57] the church began to get into its Mighty
[2:30:59] power
[2:31:00] when we have an anania sense of fire and
[2:31:02] a few of them oh that's gonna happen
[2:31:04] again when you see one day yes sir but
[2:31:07] you see when that Holy Church stands
[2:31:08] together in his power positionally
[2:31:10] placed our sons of God adopted into the
[2:31:13] family of God powerful Church standing
[2:31:16] there in his glory oh that's what he's
[2:31:18] coming for oh hallelujah what do you
[2:31:22] look like what are you following he said
[2:31:23] what we have done
[2:31:25] he said you must chose your leader
[2:31:26] choose today the prophet said you choose
[2:31:29] life or death and your choice will
[2:31:32] determine your Eternal destination what
[2:31:35] you choose you can understand he said
[2:31:37] remember Jesus said follow me
[2:31:39] and you're invited tonight to do so
[2:31:42] and to follow him to eternal life you
[2:31:45] must come on his terms that's right the
[2:31:47] word not upon the Creed not upon the
[2:31:50] public opinion not upon what anyone else
[2:31:52] thinks about
[2:31:54] on what God said about it you say well
[2:31:56] brother Brown am I Noah I know a woman
[2:31:58] just as good as she can be does this or
[2:32:00] oh no a man went through this he said I
[2:32:02] can't help what they've done God's word
[2:32:04] said let every man's word be a lie and
[2:32:06] mind be truth you've got to come on his
[2:32:09] terms come on his conditions the word
[2:32:12] you can't come to a Creed you can't mix
[2:32:14] it like that see there's only one thing
[2:32:16] you could do just accept it on his tombs
[2:32:18] praise God it's not right he said I know
[2:32:21] it's a stone cutting message brother he
[2:32:23] said but get rid of all things of the
[2:32:24] world and follow me he said but I didn't
[2:32:27] come here to choose a message to the
[2:32:28] people just to make him sing or holler
[2:32:30] I've been in Hidden meetings where
[2:32:31] they've done the same and he said but
[2:32:33] I'm interested in your life I'm a
[2:32:36] servant of God that's got to answer
[2:32:38] someday
[2:32:40] and the ministry that the Lord has given
[2:32:42] me a Vindicated itself thousands of
[2:32:43] times before he said remember Jesus
[2:32:45] Christ said follow me follow me get rid
[2:32:48] of what you've got
[2:32:49] and follow me that's the only way to
[2:32:53] have eternal life that's the only remedy
[2:32:55] he gave this man talking about original
[2:32:57] ruler that was the only remedy he gave
[2:33:00] his businessman that's the only remedy
[2:33:02] he gives anybody his choice he makes his
[2:33:04] decision and it's perfect every time but
[2:33:07] we must follow him it's the only way to
[2:33:09] have eternal life and so the leadership
[2:33:11] God of God is to follow the Vindicated
[2:33:13] whatever
[2:33:14] by the Holy Ghost to be led by a spirit
[2:33:18] praise God Amen through everything give

[2:56:23] still pulling our souls that brought us
[2:56:25] here to hear from our theophany
[2:56:28] to hear from another dimension to hear
[2:56:30] from another realm Lord to remind us
[2:56:33] that we are more than our problems our
[2:56:35] situations we are more than the bills

[2:57:21] behalf of that child on behalf of that

[2:59:38] way upon your people may you bring us
[2:59:41] back at your appointed time and Lord may
[2:59:44] you love me when I see a special prayer
[2:59:46] at this time father Lord for the
[2:59:49] backsliders
[2:59:51] for those that are struggling we see the
[2:59:53] enemy on a deliberate strategy to pick
[2:59:56] off one here and one there and one there
[2:59:59] and one there Lord and Lord but always
[3:00:01] talking about that fire being dimmed
[3:00:03] ever so slowly until you don't even
[3:00:06] realize your fire has gone out you don't
[3:00:08] even realize your lamp has gone out but
[3:00:11] oh God we want to unite as a church Lord
[3:00:14] if you said two shall agree touching
[3:00:16] anything we can have what we ask for so
[3:00:19] Lord we want to forget about ourselves
[3:00:21] and how we feel and unite and Faith as a
[3:00:24] church one agree with the other and
[3:00:27] agree with the other and agree with the
[3:00:29] other all over the building all on the
[3:00:31] internet we want to unite and fit
[3:00:34] because there's power in the Church of
[3:00:36] the Living God lord you stood at the
[3:00:38] grave of Lazarus a man who was dead for
[3:00:41] days and you said Lazarus come forth so
[3:00:44] we know there's no situation there's no
[3:00:46] problem there's no backslider who's in
[3:00:49] the realm of the living that you cannot
[3:00:51] deliver because you delivered a dead man
[3:00:54] so father God in the name of Jesus we
[3:00:57] pray for the backsliders for the weaker
[3:00:59] ones up for those that are struggling
[3:01:01] that are in the building that are
[3:01:04] awesome in the mighty name of Jesus we
[3:01:07] lose the Bloodhound but after them today
[3:01:10] to arrest him and to bring them back
[3:01:13] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[3:01:15] House of Hell give way to the name of
[3:01:19] the mighty name The Wonderful Name the
[3:01:22] Glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:01:24] of and a dimension of that name every
[3:01:28] knee will bow every tongue has a
[3:01:30] confession that Jesus Christ is Lord we
[3:01:34] lift your name higher today we give you
[3:01:36] the glory we give you the honor in the
[3:01:40] mighty name of Jesus Christ and the
[3:01:41] church says
[3:01:43] and the church says and the church says
[3:01:47] Give the Lord a handle praise
[3:01:49] [Music]
[3:01:55] you may be seated for a few
[3:01:56] announcements
[3:01:59] [Music]
[3:02:02] something else when you catch a burden
[3:02:04] and the burden is bigger than you
[3:02:07] Vision has to be bigger than you purpose
[3:02:10] has to be bigger than you the desire for
[3:02:13] God to be made manifest in and around
[3:02:15] your life has to be bigger than you you
[3:02:17] have to look Beyond you because sallam
[3:02:19] is not just for you there's somebody
[3:02:20] depending on your prayer somebody
[3:02:22] depending on your worship somebody
[3:02:24] depending on your sacrifice and we bring
[3:02:27] that sacrifice of praise this morning
[3:02:29] into the house of the Lord
[3:02:32] our next service continues on Wednesday
[3:02:34] night it will not be a physical service
[3:02:37] here at the Tabernacle it will be a live
[3:02:40] streaming service
[3:02:41] as you know Wednesday night is
[3:02:42] Independence there's a lot of different
[3:02:44] moving pieces around that so we will
[3:02:46] have a live stream service only on this
[3:02:50] coming Wednesday night at 8. p.m so be
[3:02:54] on a great expectation and
[3:02:56] set aside that time friends
[3:02:59] when you really look at how you spend
[3:03:01] your time and how you use your time and
[3:03:04] the value of your time we do not give
[3:03:07] God enough
[3:03:10] we don't
[3:03:12] the very best effort you could put on a
[3:03:14] daily basis is not enough for the one
[3:03:16] who made you wake up in the morning
[3:03:19] we have the best plans to achieve this
[3:03:21] and do that and accomplish this and if
[3:03:23] God don't wake you up nothing happening
[3:03:26] so the first thing when you wake up you
[3:03:28] say Lord thank you good morning
[3:03:29] [Music]
[3:03:31] I'm in the land of the living I have an
[3:03:33] opportunity to do something
[3:03:34] if he didn't wake you up this morning
[3:03:36] you could do nothing
[3:03:39] so I challenge you and there's an
[3:03:41] opportunity to worship to praise to be
[3:03:44] in the house of the Lord to connect and
[3:03:46] and in your own time you make time for
[3:03:48] the business of God so I want to
[3:03:50] encourage you connect the service on
[3:03:52] Wednesday night and this coming Friday
[3:03:54] it's the first Friday of the month so
[3:03:57] it's our prayer and our fasting day
[3:04:00] and fast during the day and at night at
[3:04:03] 8pm we come together in a zoom prayer
[3:04:05] meeting
[3:04:06] make it your priority on that day we
[3:04:10] don't know how much time we have left
[3:04:12] Lord teach me to number my days
[3:04:15] we don't know how much time we have left
[3:04:17] so every day every hour every minute
[3:04:19] there must be a consciousness of deity a
[3:04:23] consciousness of God can the Church Say
[3:04:26] Amen
[3:04:27] so again this coming Wednesday live
[3:04:29] streams if it's only this coming Friday
[3:04:31] time of prayer to be culminated by a
[3:04:34] zoom prayer meeting at 8pm on Friday and
[3:04:37] of course this coming Sunday we're back
[3:04:39] in the house of the Lord
[3:04:41] I also want to make mention that as we
[3:04:43] approach this month of September that we
[3:04:47] are going into
[3:04:48] there are four things that we are going
[3:04:51] to be
[3:04:52] I guess reactivating in a certain sense
[3:04:54] I just want to put you on notice of it
[3:04:57] the exact dates will follow but Sunday
[3:04:59] school will begin once again in
[3:05:02] September the date will be announced
[3:05:04] officially we also looking to have one
[3:05:08] special youth service and fellowship in
[3:05:10] September as well so you want to put you
[3:05:12] on notice the date to be confirmed we
[3:05:15] also will be having the Lord's Supper in
[3:05:17] September so we'll let you know which
[3:05:20] service that will be and finally we'll
[3:05:22] be certainly looking to get some Bible
[3:05:24] studies in in September as well so be on
[3:05:28] notice you know we want to try to fit
[3:05:30] all these things in and and really sort
[3:05:32] of see how best we can help and put our
[3:05:34] shoulders to the wheel as it were so we
[3:05:36] can grow in every area of Our Lives
[3:05:39] but ernstein was so tremendous and
[3:05:42] speaking about God's concern as a father
[3:05:44] God's concerned in our well-being and
[3:05:47] when you read the message and you see
[3:05:49] how the prophet laid it out God is
[3:05:51] interested in every single aspect of
[3:05:54] your life not just your spiritual work
[3:05:56] but every aspect he's interested in your
[3:05:59] marriage he's interested in your
[3:06:00] business he's interested in your job
[3:06:02] he's interested in how you get to work
[3:06:04] he's interested in your happiness he's
[3:06:06] interested in your well-being he's
[3:06:08] interested in your mental state God is
[3:06:10] concerned as a father about every single
[3:06:14] aspect of your life
[3:06:16] and the challenge for us is how much are
[3:06:19] we willing to surrender to that
[3:06:21] leadership that brother Anthony spoke
[3:06:23] about because where he leads us once we
[3:06:25] follow then everything falls into place
[3:06:28] he said seek first the kingdom
[3:06:32] and his righteousness and every other
[3:06:34] thing that you ever could ever desire
[3:06:36] will just fall in place because you're
[3:06:39] under leadership God help us to come on
[3:06:42] the leadership of the Holy Ghost not
[3:06:43] leadership of a influence on social
[3:06:46] media or family member or a neighbor or
[3:06:48] relative or something you read any
[3:06:50] newspaper that's leading you here
[3:06:52] because they're only two influences
[3:06:53] you've been influenced from above or
[3:06:55] From Below but the leadership of the
[3:06:58] Holy Spirit would always take you into
[3:07:00] the right place you can never go wrong
[3:07:02] surrendering yourself to the leadership
[3:07:04] of the Holy Ghost
[3:07:06] never ever ever ever go wrong
[3:07:10] but there are a million ways to go
[3:07:12] around with all of the other voices that
[3:07:14] are being driven by that architect in
[3:07:17] Hell who is designing and redesigning
[3:07:19] ways to attract people into his world
[3:07:21] but God has only one way it's true that
[3:07:25] blood through that blood through that
[3:07:27] blood and through that baptism of the
[3:07:30] Holy Ghost That by one Spirit we are
[3:07:32] baptized into that mystical body can the
[3:07:35] church say Amen anybody love the Lord we
[3:07:38] ought to be the happiest people on the
[3:07:41] face of the Earth every single day come
[3:07:44] what me
[3:07:45] how's it going all is well
[3:07:49] I lost my job how's it going all is well
[3:07:51] because you know where your source is
[3:07:53] you know where your strength comes from
[3:07:55] and you know that God is leading you
[3:07:58] [Music]
[3:07:59] finally maintenance group three please
[3:08:01] meet with brother Anthony Henry after
[3:08:04] the service and next week Lord willing
[3:08:07] group five for the Blackman's group is
[3:08:10] carded to clean may the Lord
[3:08:12] [Music]
