[54:56] chapter 8 reading verse 10 this is Jesus
[54:59] after the parable of the seed and the
[55:01] disciples and he acts they asked him

[55:16] now the parable is this
[55:19] the seed is the word of God those by the
[55:22] wayside are they that hear then commit
[55:24] the devil and take it away the word out
[55:26] of the hearts at least they should
[55:28] believe and be saved they on the Rock a
[55:30] day which when they hear receive the
[55:32] word with joy and these have no root

[59:06] here revealing the word of God he said
[59:09] God let the people be awakened quickly
[59:11] Lord quickly those who have their names

[1:00:21] God where the sacrifice is lead there's
[1:00:24] no more hopes for the world she is

[1:08:59] promises being preached
[1:09:00] from the new land
[1:09:02] that is what we will be preaching from
[1:09:03] we have been preaching all these years

[1:10:36] little Eagle you're hooked to the
[1:10:37] promise I'm waiting upon God I have a
[1:10:40] promise to preach the gospel and I know
[1:10:42] the gospel is not in word only I've been
[1:10:44] preaching for years but this is not the
[1:10:45] gospel yet the gospel this word is the
[1:10:48] gospel in sea form but when the word
[1:10:50] began to be Vindicated and manifested
[1:10:52] and confirmed and the angel of his
[1:10:54] presence is walking among us there will
[1:10:57] be no doubting your heart in your mind
[1:10:58] that you will know God Among Us what can
[1:11:01] the Lord and Shout there will be no
[1:11:02] question ever and he's saying that I
[1:11:05] hope he could say that he will shut him

[1:11:09] straighten up and get inside of here
[1:11:10] give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to

[1:11:15] Jesus walking in and the shout of the
[1:11:17] king will be in the camp Oh I bless God

[1:11:35] over you oh glory to God
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:45] Glory
[1:11:46] made me let me see this so we have to
[1:11:50] fight and battle to find every promise
[1:11:52] for the bride every promise spoke about
[1:11:54] the bride it has spoken about Los
[1:11:56] Angeles
[1:11:58] about Russia about different things but
[1:12:01] they're possibly bride I can't wait half
[1:12:03] an hour how I talk about Russia and
[1:12:04] alone and whatnot that is crying and
[1:12:06] even Force anointed I can't touch them
[1:12:08] guys if I go and touch all them whatever
[1:12:09] you gotta take out the whole service
[1:12:11] trying to identify this force that falls
[1:12:13] that is too much of them it's many false
[1:12:15] props should arise I can't touch that
[1:12:16] many I talk into the bride okay the Lord
[1:12:18] I shout in the house oh God I will leave
[1:12:20] that for the sword of God to deal with
[1:12:22] them
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:27] to claim that building in there
[1:12:30] Oh Glory to God hallelujah because faith
[1:12:34] is a revelation you gotta give yourself
[1:12:36] that is God must give you that it's the
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the
[1:12:41] divine revelation of Jesus Christ Oh
[1:12:44] Glory to God as many receive him oh
[1:12:47] glory to God by Revelation let them give
[1:12:50] you virtue power
[1:12:52] foreign

[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:03] spirit
[1:13:05] is a revelation but virtue is spirit
[1:13:08] Power
[1:13:09] not knowledge power
[1:13:11] spirit Power and when God gave me the
[1:13:13] spirit you have to give his knowledge on
[1:13:15] top of that because they get the spirit
[1:13:16] and you have no knowledge you wouldn't
[1:13:18] know what to do with it so upon Faith
[1:13:20] revelation God put Power and then power
[1:13:22] knowledge knowledge you know what
[1:13:25] to know you have to go and die
[1:13:27] you have to go to Calvary now not
[1:13:30] adoption the spirit of adoption that
[1:13:32] will drive you the calvary he said the
[1:13:33] Dynamics will drag the people to Calvary
[1:13:35] and get into the Rapture say virtue
[1:13:38] knowledge and then driver to die and in
[1:13:40] titira
[1:13:42] Colombo is when the seed went long into
[1:13:45] the ground
[1:13:45] that is why you die and they get
[1:13:48] Temperance you die and you get patience
[1:13:50] you die and you get godliness you die
[1:13:56] and then the Holy Spirit the same power
[1:13:59] that hit you at virtue come back on top
[1:14:02] the cap the Pyramid of your life oh give
[1:14:05] the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God
[1:14:08] that's a living virtue that's a living
[1:14:11] pyramid that's not just a picture on the
[1:14:13] wall

[1:15:15] yeah that could function real fight you
[1:15:17] could hide you could have yourself
[1:15:19] under the ministry of the word but never
[1:15:21] under the ministry of the spirit
[1:15:23] you cannot do that
[1:15:25] you cannot do that under the ministry of
[1:15:28] the spirit
[1:15:29] because the military Spirit comes with
[1:15:30] discernment the minister the spirit is
[1:15:32] what makes Peter say your light to the
[1:15:33] Holy Ghost and NASA fire they will pack
[1:15:36] them all dead out the church they get

[1:23:43] so zealous of the kind of a seed I
[1:23:46] planted for the body
[1:23:48] so we have to find those seeds that
[1:23:50] brother Branham planted he actually put
[1:23:52] it on books and tapes
[1:23:54] he go tell them to say things a certain
[1:23:56] way to throw awesome and all but there
[1:23:58] are seeds for the body and our duty is
[1:24:01] to find those seeds that he planted for
[1:24:03] the body now watch the rain is going to
[1:24:06] fall pretty soon I mean the real rain
[1:24:08] and it's got to have sea to fall on I
[1:24:12] hope I live to see it
[1:24:14] God didn't allow him to live to see it
[1:24:16] but you're gonna see it
[1:24:17] let me prophesy to you to your own face
[1:24:20] you're gonna see it you're gonna see

[1:24:31] side of you you're gonna see God Quicken
[1:24:34] the seeds and the life of the people to
[1:24:36] produce a living faith and live in
[1:24:38] virtue and live in knowledge because the
[1:24:40] seed have the potential oh give the Lord
[1:24:42] a shout the seed of the potential to be
[1:24:45] transformed into whatever God said the
[1:24:47] seed is and we put the Sea of the
[1:24:50] stature of a perfect man
[1:24:52] Not A Primitive side of you
[1:24:54] Oh Glory to God
[1:24:56] Glory
[1:24:59] my
[1:25:01] watch
[1:25:04] so you know Solomon Temple the past were
[1:25:07] caught in different places right and
[1:25:09] they came to assembly to say another
[1:25:10] Soul was healed and so on he said no
[1:25:12] watch it didn't even need a honing it
[1:25:15] was already honed God made it so perfect
[1:25:17] to fit in this place what a type here we
[1:25:19] find that spiritual how every gift of
[1:25:21] God every odd Act of born-again
[1:25:23] Christian in their peculiarity yes it's
[1:25:25] got a place
[1:25:26] it fits in the body it goes in the right
[1:25:28] place many of us would say that that's
[1:25:30] not God a good holy consecrated soul of
[1:25:33] the Cross and we say no we stood in the
[1:25:35] church all the other night we heard such
[1:25:36] a thing that can't be God but if it is
[1:25:38] in line with the pattern if it's in line
[1:25:41] with the Scripture it may be odd but
[1:25:43] it's going to have its place it will fit
[1:25:45] right in and it won't even need horny or
[1:25:47] polishing it's go to its place for the
[1:25:49] great architect Christ is dependent now
[1:25:52] now we notice in the building down here
[1:25:54] the next chapter in the building there
[1:25:55] was one stone there was actually too odd
[1:25:58] to fool with so the builders rejected it
[1:26:01] and they pitch it over in the corner
[1:26:03] that stone is too hard to be used
[1:26:04] there's no such a place but remember
[1:26:06] they had built the building so high till
[1:26:09] they missed the stone and they didn't
[1:26:10] know where that stone was they searched
[1:26:12] on the ships they went through every Ox
[1:26:14] cart they said did you lose your stone
[1:26:15] on the road something is wrong and they
[1:26:18] could not find it nowhere else come to
[1:26:19] find out it was right on the ground
[1:26:21] it was the Chief Cornerstone that the
[1:26:24] bill has rejected and Jesus spoke of it
[1:26:26] he said have you not read that the stone
[1:26:28] the bill is rejected was the Chief
[1:26:30] Cornerstone where the rest of the
[1:26:31] building rested on and in the building
[1:26:33] the day of the spiritual house that God
[1:26:35] worshiped I think it had been a great
[1:26:36] big failure today among the builders we
[1:26:38] have come with our denomination we have
[1:26:40] laid them in sincerity we sent our boys
[1:26:42] to school to educate them speak well
[1:26:44] before congregations learn them
[1:26:46] psychology Bible History we did
[1:26:48] everything built fine pews high tower
[1:26:49] Steeples beautiful music we find
[1:26:51] something is wrong we try to build it
[1:26:53] out of man-made material what education
[1:26:56] could produce what seminaries could
[1:26:58] bring out what scholarship which I'd
[1:26:59] ability upon education and all these
[1:27:02] things will not work as long as we have
[1:27:03] not accepted this Odd Stone this
[1:27:06] peculiar Stone and as the building begin
[1:27:08] to materialize they realized that the
[1:27:10] hole that was left the Odd Stone fitted
[1:27:13] to the dot that is where the spiritual
[1:27:15] Builders today that is why the bride
[1:27:17] building of Christ is not ready for the
[1:27:19] bridegroom
[1:27:21] listen to these words
[1:27:23] that is why the bride building of Christ
[1:27:27] is not ready for the bridegroom is
[1:27:29] because the builders has rejected the
[1:27:32] Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the
[1:27:34] Ping of Pentecost which is the baptism
[1:27:38] of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:42] it's been odd people act funny they
[1:27:44] don't want to come in order of
[1:27:46] psychology or Educational Learning they
[1:27:47] don't fit in there and they kick it out
[1:27:49] because it was too odd
[1:27:52] too peculiar no we find out
[1:27:54] but you have stones and Stones got 14
[1:27:56] and we're only waiting for that
[1:27:59] headstone that the bill has rejected
[1:28:01] waiting for his coming the captain Stone
[1:28:05] that is the real church not mortar not
[1:28:07] brick and stone and so forth which is
[1:28:09] perishable but the real church is built
[1:28:12] upon the revelation of the word and the
[1:28:14] will of God and they have been placed in
[1:28:17] the body since Ephesians is all the way
[1:28:19] down to allow this year in the day of
[1:28:21] Solomon completed the temple he said no
[1:28:24] watch I say this with reverence with all
[1:28:25] respects to every man in every Church
[1:28:27] today accept the rejected instead of
[1:28:30] pushing them off and call them a bunch
[1:28:31] of Holy Rollers the odd ones they're
[1:28:33] making too much noise here's somebody
[1:28:35] calls exercise in church really stand up
[1:28:36] like maybe
[1:28:38] like we're doing aerobics
[1:28:43] church when you gain up and saying but
[1:28:46] they they probably stay tuned and they
[1:28:48] say no stone dead
[1:28:50] watch and watch but did you notice after
[1:28:53] the building was completed it was still
[1:28:54] empty
[1:28:56] it was nothing but furniture
[1:28:58] so Solomon had done all this he could do
[1:29:00] now the great dedication come and they
[1:29:02] were going to dedicate this building for
[1:29:03] worshipers to worship something now
[1:29:05] without Something There To Worship the
[1:29:06] building would have been in vain no the
[1:29:08] building was ready for dedication they
[1:29:10] started marching the trumpet song and
[1:29:12] they saw trees playing smoke going up
[1:29:13] from dead animals sacrificed before
[1:29:15] Jehovah down through the building of the
[1:29:17] dedication that came they brought it to
[1:29:18] his resting place and when it fit down
[1:29:20] into the sockets of the huge place
[1:29:22] when it fit down finally come to its
[1:29:24] resting place the Bible said
[1:29:27] that the Lord
[1:29:29] sended dong upon the place
[1:29:33] till he filled the entire Temple
[1:29:35] the pillar of fire came in dear with
[1:29:38] such a great glory of God till the
[1:29:41] minister could not Minister anymore
[1:29:42] because of the glory of God that
[1:29:45] building by Solomon was built according
[1:29:47] to specification it was built according
[1:29:50] to our vision according to our program
[1:29:52] and nothing happened you're not remind
[1:29:54] me of when Elijah was following Elijah
[1:29:57] Elisha was following Elijah and he
[1:29:59] crossed Jordan and he said if you see me
[1:30:01] go he said what you want me to do he's a
[1:30:03] double portion if you see me go and
[1:30:05] Elijah making sure
[1:30:07] no politics he was just focusing on
[1:30:09] Elijah and then he saw him go and he
[1:30:11] dropped the mantle upon him and when
[1:30:13] that man had hit him so he tried to only
[1:30:15] cheer up his own robe and nothing
[1:30:16] happened
[1:30:18] he's so good
[1:30:19] I topping upon that Michael
[1:30:22] nothing
[1:30:25] it was just a mantle and then he catch a
[1:30:27] revelation it's not in my bloody power
[1:30:30] he saw you like that strike the mantle
[1:30:32] and you throw it and open up it wasn't a
[1:30:34] mantle he took the mantle and he said
[1:30:36] where is the Lord God of Elijah and he
[1:30:39] recognizes more than just letter it's
[1:30:41] more than just word it's more than
[1:30:43] having a rule from the prophet I am the
[1:30:45] prophet's robe you could have whatever
[1:30:47] role you have you better have the god of
[1:30:48] Elijah okay the Lord some praise it
[1:30:52] Glory
[1:30:53] Hallelujah
[1:30:55] mine
[1:30:57] mine
[1:30:58] Glory
[1:31:00] then he said watch we find out Stephen
[1:31:02] said our fathers from favor before God
[1:31:04] and Solomon built another Temple how
[1:31:06] would be the most high dweled not of

[1:31:25] upper room and waited for 10 days for
[1:31:28] dedicational service and then suddenly
[1:31:30] completely surrendered and God came down
[1:31:32] again in Shekinah Glory and fill all the
[1:31:35] house where they were sitting so he

[1:42:39] praises
[1:42:41] when Christ was being formed in Mary
[1:42:44] quickly come the king's commandment
[1:42:46] Christ was becoming a full baby ready to
[1:42:48] be delivered now the baby has been
[1:42:50] formed for a long time
[1:42:52] in the womb but this is the coming of
[1:42:55] the last days when the completeness hear
[1:42:57] these words when the fullness of the
[1:43:00] godhead when the fullness of Christ is
[1:43:03] to be manifested among his people he
[1:43:05] promises in his word and when the
[1:43:07] fullness you see there's an unusual
[1:43:08] thing begin to happen
[1:43:09] that's the reason of a great so
[1:43:11] socialize and things can't understand
[1:43:12] it's foolishness to them or hear the
[1:43:15] path toward press come down right
[1:43:17] probably press coming down and they're
[1:43:18] trying to come down and pass laws and
[1:43:20] all kind of nonsense to try to scare the
[1:43:22] people
[1:43:24] hear this now now watch they are forming
[1:43:28] a function of churches
[1:43:30] just the time
[1:43:32] when the church is begin to get to its
[1:43:36] feet
[1:43:37] where the Supernatural is begin to work
[1:43:42] now they're going to try to try to stop
[1:43:44] this stuff
[1:43:45] and I'm preaching this all the time and
[1:43:47] I'll find it here
[1:43:48] in other words you're saying when this
[1:43:51] Supernatural begins to be manifest in
[1:43:54] the church that is when the church gets
[1:43:56] into its feet that is when they're gonna
[1:43:58] try to stop it they can't stop us
[1:44:00] because we have books and tapes and
[1:44:02] saying God's not Prophet we're doing
[1:44:04] nothing just 58 years
[1:44:08] we have nothing to show them
[1:44:10] but a book and a tape what are you gonna
[1:44:12] stop us for
[1:44:13] what press come down what price are you
[1:44:15] talking about
[1:44:16] it's fraud
[1:44:18] the fraud for this Revelation out the
[1:44:20] time and thing
[1:44:22] when the supernatural
[1:44:24] begins to come forward
[1:44:26] then the church gets into his feet
[1:44:28] because Power is coming in the devil is
[1:44:31] foolish he must know power he witnessed
[1:44:33] power before he must know and power
[1:44:35] coming in when Powers at the Community
[1:44:37] Church all kind of cooks and cranks will
[1:44:38] come inside of this building because he
[1:44:40] said once the Revival begins he will
[1:44:42] send the devil will send spirits to try
[1:44:44] to stop it and hold it but we already
[1:44:47] exposed that we expect and we're looking
[1:44:48] for him oh God we could be ready for him
[1:44:51] then look at the Lord some praises
[1:44:53] this is not a game
[1:44:55] this is real war

[1:50:45] that means he's saying I'm finished I'm
[1:50:47] doing the beginning I'm doing the ending
[1:50:48] but that sanification part
[1:50:50] that's the hard part
[1:50:52] as a legalistic part that's the labor
[1:50:54] part that's the use of continent here
[1:50:56] you start to behave yourself you said

[1:51:32] that's at the bottom
[1:51:33] in the full Church
[1:51:35] it is a headstone

[1:52:53] mortar will put an immortality this
[1:52:55] corruption will put on in corruption we
[1:52:57] shall be changed
[1:53:01] all right
[1:53:03] let's go
[1:53:04] four messengers of debt that's what he
[1:53:07] read about tamawum Lucas Cancun
[1:53:09] caterpillar one talks is fruit one took
[1:53:11] the back one talks the leave and one
[1:53:14] took the life
[1:53:15] that was the dead angels
[1:53:17] that was the angels of death four you
[1:53:19] call them messengers of debt and then
[1:53:21] four messes of Life restores the tree
[1:53:25] four messages were sent to restoratory
[1:53:27] first as Martin Luther justification
[1:53:29] second was John Wesley sanification what
[1:53:32] was the third the Pentecost where the
[1:53:34] Russian of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[1:53:35] baptisms what was the thought the word
[1:53:39] that's why I titled the message luta
[1:53:40] Wesley Pentecostal and the word
[1:53:44] that is the fourth message
[1:53:46] one of them looter you begin the shine a
[1:53:48] light
[1:53:48] small strength of justification Along
[1:53:51] Came Mercy stronger sanification
[1:53:53] and then the last days Malachi 4 Elijah
[1:53:57] is to come with the very word the word
[1:53:59] of the Lord comes to the prophet to turn
[1:54:02] the hearts of return back to the faith

[1:54:24] touching of Holiness the Pentecostal
[1:54:27] brought back the leaves clap hands and
[1:54:29] fellowship and rejoicing what the
[1:54:31] thought was the word
[1:54:33] the word made flesh fruits of the proof
[1:54:37] of the Resurrection sign that Christ
[1:54:40] here we go has finally after
[1:54:42] justification been planted that's the
[1:54:45] word planted standard vacation being
[1:54:47] planted the bathroom only goes
[1:54:49] organization died out and Christ has
[1:54:51] again centered himself like that cup of
[1:54:55] the pyramid first line justification
[1:54:59] sanification second Holy Ghost stood
[1:55:02] then the coming of the camp
[1:55:05] that's where we are at
[1:55:07] then he said what is it he's going on
[1:55:09] deeper that Holy Ghost bunch

[1:55:38] Ministry
[1:55:40] you think Peter want to kill innocence
[1:55:41] of Ira
[1:55:43] it's Peter wasn't in charge of that you
[1:55:44] know he said enlighten me you lie to the
[1:55:46] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost took care of
[1:55:48] that
[1:55:50] so that wasn't Peter Ministry that was
[1:55:52] the Holy Ghost Ministry working to Peter

[1:56:08] Ghost bunch being honed so that it can
[1:56:11] fit with the same kind of mystery had
[1:56:13] when he went away and when he comes back
[1:56:16] it will catch the whole thing in the
[1:56:18] Rapture where the Justified
[1:56:21] sanctified
[1:56:22] baptism only goes that pyramid will
[1:56:25] stand again
[1:56:26] the house of God will live again the
[1:56:29] tree of life is growing again
[1:56:31] so you cannot say you're Justified the
[1:56:34] message
[1:56:35] because he had the word no you need the
[1:56:38] whole package
[1:56:41] because all is God
[1:56:43] the spirit justifies you the spirit
[1:56:45] sanctifies you the spirit baptizes and
[1:56:49] the spirit bring the word to you to turn
[1:56:51] the word on the light
[1:56:52] Oh Glory to God so when you want to get
[1:56:54] closer to God you're only trying to grow
[1:56:56] in God

[1:57:02] I want to be close God give you
[1:57:04] knowledge

[1:57:06] patience and godliness right up the
[1:57:08] pyramid seven steps to perfection
[1:57:11] write up the pyramid and then afterwards
[1:57:13] you become one with him when you see me
[1:57:15] you see the Father the father who lives
[1:57:17] in me
[1:57:18] and what the prophecy we have since John
[1:57:20] 14 20 at that day you shall know I am in
[1:57:22] the father he and me and I knew so God
[1:57:24] promised to be in you he was God above
[1:57:27] us in the pillar of fire he was God With
[1:57:28] Us in Jesus Christ but he really want to
[1:57:30] get in you God above god with and now
[1:57:33] God in
[1:57:34] that's why he told them I will not leave
[1:57:36] you comfort this I will come to you
[1:57:38] otherwise see me no more and but you're
[1:57:40] gonna see me Oh Glory to God how you
[1:57:43] dwell it with you but shall be in you
[1:57:45] I would not leave you comfortless I will
[1:57:47] come
[1:57:48] oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:57:50] hallelujah praise God
[1:57:53] these people who died are depending and
[1:57:56] waiting on us that includes all the
[1:57:58] Brethren and sisters who died in this
[1:57:59] church
[1:58:00] all the prophets all who died the
[1:58:02] waiting on us watch what so this church
[1:58:05] prophecy has got to come to perfection
[1:58:07] in order to bring the resurrection their
[1:58:10] souls under the altar waiting for this
[1:58:11] church to come to Perfection that is
[1:58:13] when Christ does come
[1:58:15] oh my Hallelujah okay the Lord some
[1:58:18] praises
[1:58:19] glory to God and when it comes this
[1:58:23] church
[1:58:24] has got to be honed
[1:58:30] between them so when the pyramid cap
[1:58:33] does come
[1:58:34] the body of Christ will have to be honed
[1:58:37] that is not America that's the entire
[1:58:39] body of Christ
[1:58:41] see you in Africa and YouTube you have
[1:58:43] it so no yeah
[1:58:45] if you're in China you have to be honed
[1:58:47] South America has to be home Canada
[1:58:49] America West Indies have to be honed
[1:58:52] that means God must raise them from
[1:58:53] Stone Mason
[1:58:54] to hone the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:58:57] why there's a fight for Ministry for the
[1:58:59] Perfection of the Saints for the work of
[1:59:00] the ministry for the 85 of the Body for
[1:59:03] the honing of the body to do the final
[1:59:04] finishing touches the word cut you out
[1:59:07] but the finishing touches I said that is
[1:59:09] fine tuning now this
[1:59:13] [Music]
[1:59:14] [Applause]
[1:59:16] what what you not seeing God's seal
[1:59:19] that's why God tell the prophet be more
[1:59:21] sincere Oh Glory to God because God's
[1:59:24] seeing something man cannot see or give
[1:59:26] the Lord a shout so he had to be honed
[1:59:28] and cut and smooth out oh glory to God
[1:59:32] hallelujah
[1:59:34] Hallelujah sand people rubbing you down
[1:59:36] so it's not easy but look glory to God
[1:59:39] when God finished with you it fitting
[1:59:41] just right the Devil Himself can move
[1:59:43] between that hey
[1:59:46] torn upon Stone
[1:59:48] glory to God red blood into orange blend
[1:59:52] into yellow blood into thin and no leaks
[1:59:55] in the building and charity comes down
[1:59:57] the wonderful Fitness and seal the whole
[2:00:00] building and he said I use the pyramid
[2:00:03] living pyramid of the Living God
[2:00:07] oh Hallelujah glory to God
[2:00:10] all right let's hit the homelessness you
[2:00:12] know
[2:00:13] you're going good
[2:00:15] for marginal voice he says this God is
[2:00:17] ready if he isn't doing it now he is
[2:00:20] going to call a church the Perfection by
[2:00:24] his word Jesus Christ
[2:00:26] that's the call
[2:00:28] to this group because it is pastor this
[2:00:29] minute so this inspiration to connect to
[2:00:31] this one and what no no call the
[2:00:34] perfection
[2:00:35] by his word Jesus Christ all right so
[2:00:38] let me get to the inspiration now
[2:00:40] I was wondering how to title this was so
[2:00:42] tough
[2:00:44] I was thinking about this last Grace
[2:00:45] that must come to Perfection if I titled
[2:00:47] that you would know what I'm talking
[2:00:48] about
[2:00:50] Wesley
[2:00:51] Pentecostal and the word and this last
[2:00:55] great step
[2:00:56] must come into the Perfection which is
[2:00:59] the word
[2:01:00] let's step there right so now we
[2:01:02] understand where he comes from now from
[2:01:04] the sign of the time New York brother
[2:01:05] Brown we have left the Pentecostal age
[2:01:07] we are coming now to wear like in a
[2:01:09] pyramid not pyramid reduction now the
[2:01:11] headstone
[2:01:12] when it comes to fit it's got to be
[2:01:15] honed there's got to be a Ministry in
[2:01:17] the church he is not talking about
[2:01:19] brother to your ministry
[2:01:21] the ministry he's talking about here now
[2:01:23] is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:01:25] has to be in the church
[2:01:27] here there's got to be a Ministry in the
[2:01:30] Church the true children God to where
[2:01:32] when The Headstone come Christ or the
[2:01:36] ministry of Christ and Christ will fit
[2:01:39] right together
[2:01:40] so Christ is coming but the minutes of
[2:01:43] Christ is here
[2:01:44] to fit with Christ
[2:01:48] in other words he's come back for the
[2:01:50] Same Spirit
[2:01:51] you know
[2:01:52] but don't give a story about any in the
[2:01:54] early times when the Chinese came over
[2:01:56] and they had laundry and when they come
[2:01:58] and put your laundry closed he said take
[2:02:00] a ticket until and give your peace to
[2:02:03] keep and they will keep a Peace So when
[2:02:05] they come back for a laundry Cruise
[2:02:06] doesn't match it
[2:02:07] and then then match it then you could
[2:02:10] get your clothes and always the other
[2:02:11] half of the Chinese ticket so when God
[2:02:14] come back he has to have the same Spirit
[2:02:16] here on the earth when Christ come it
[2:02:18] must match
[2:02:19] it must blend
[2:02:20] in other words word of my word
[2:02:23] Spirit of my spirit it has to be here it
[2:02:26] has to have the brotherly kindness of
[2:02:28] Jesus Christ not your birthday kindness
[2:02:30] not you loving your own and your family
[2:02:32] and whatnot that is you and your
[2:02:33] business that is not you and your
[2:02:34] natural business we're not talking about
[2:02:36] natural body kindness natural virtue
[2:02:38] natural Faith natural patience we talk
[2:02:40] about the patience of Jesus Christ
[2:02:42] the temperance of Jesus Christ the
[2:02:44] godliness of Jesus right not your own of
[2:02:47] Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some
[2:02:49] Praises that has to be emanating in you
[2:02:52] glory to God can be calling with your
[2:02:55] wife and when somebody knocking the door
[2:02:56] you say God praise the Lord
[2:03:00] when you're smiling so but you're just
[2:03:01] calling with your husband
[2:03:05] so you know any stranger come or some
[2:03:07] people come to get in my shoulder prison
[2:03:10] all is well but you're just a correct
[2:03:13] that yet you know
[2:03:16] see I'm talking about so when they begin
[2:03:18] to live in you it's automatic
[2:03:20] you act the right way to give a witness
[2:03:22] to Pentecostal to anybody haters and
[2:03:25] atheist Muslim Buddha Hindu it doesn't
[2:03:28] matter which is you act like Christ how
[2:03:30] christ-word you live the life of Christ
[2:03:31] you act the Life of Christ is the life
[2:03:34] behind the name they're going to make
[2:03:35] them Devils tremble
[2:03:37] are you with me now
[2:03:38] [Applause]
[2:03:40] all right
[2:03:42] there's got to be a Ministry in the
[2:03:44] church the True Church of the Living God
[2:03:46] to when when The Headstone come Christ
[2:03:48] or the ministry of Christ and Christ
[2:03:50] would fit right in together then that
[2:03:53] brings back the redeemed to take the
[2:03:55] whole house of God to Glory the
[2:03:57] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian true
[2:03:59] great proficient ages will come out and
[2:04:01] give their lives and persecution on
[2:04:02] things for the kingdom of God but that
[2:04:04] Stone is coming yes sir it says me will
[2:04:06] come God will send it it will fit all
[2:04:09] the building together upon it we see
[2:04:11] these signs and we see the ministry from
[2:04:13] Christ beginning to narrow up now
[2:04:16] to the complete Ministry of Christ in
[2:04:20] the fullness of the Holy Spirit under
[2:04:22] Luther it was the same holy spirit so
[2:04:24] don't say loser didn't have the Holy
[2:04:26] Spirit the Holy Spirit was given to
[2:04:27] Luther in the form of justification so
[2:04:29] justification was his baptism are you
[2:04:31] with me
[2:04:32] sanification then sanitation on the
[2:04:34] Wesley the messages then the baptism of
[2:04:37] the Holy Spirit making a tree not three
[2:04:39] steps of Grace but three stations I
[2:04:40] might call it notice and this is where
[2:04:43] he switched over now when a baby is born
[2:04:45] these three things considers birth
[2:04:48] normal birth is water then blood then
[2:04:51] life
[2:04:52] the new birth is water blood and spirit
[2:04:54] that's the elements that come from his
[2:04:56] body to make up his bride Adam had his
[2:04:59] bride taken from his body crimes his
[2:05:01] brightening from the body and when
[2:05:03] Christ died there was three elements
[2:05:05] that came from his body water blood
[2:05:06] spirit justification true Believin water
[2:05:09] sanification to the blood the battle
[2:05:11] Holy Spirit and this is where I get it
[2:05:13] from
[2:05:14] so now
[2:05:16] this last great step
[2:05:20] must come into the perfection
[2:05:23] that the Holy Spirit has to live in that
[2:05:26] church
[2:05:27] so perfectly not he's not talking about
[2:05:29] messages
[2:05:30] he's not talking about sermons
[2:05:32] and foreign
[2:05:42] four hours three hours pumping the wood
[2:05:44] and Elena Foundation when you go when go
[2:05:46] finish
[2:05:48] because you see you have to get on the
[2:05:49] expectation for the cap
[2:05:51] you have to get an expectation for the
[2:05:54] lettering you have to get an expectation
[2:05:56] for the spirit you need a spirit to be
[2:05:58] with your children you need the spirit
[2:05:59] to live with your family you need the
[2:06:00] spirit to be the loved ones it's Devils
[2:06:02] on them
[2:06:03] you can go and beat them at a spoken
[2:06:04] book you can take the Bible and slam it
[2:06:06] on them and tell them in the Bible
[2:06:09] just laugh at it
[2:06:11] but when you see a move of the spirit
[2:06:13] by the time you hit that front door them
[2:06:15] Devils looking to go on the back door
[2:06:17] because they know what is coming they
[2:06:20] recognize the anointing upon your life

[2:07:09] before be say amen and the 24 Elders say

[2:08:05] praises
[2:08:12] what you want

[2:08:25] oh give the Lord some praises
[2:08:26] [Applause]
[2:08:29] oh let's see if you can hit the womb
[2:08:32] this last great step
[2:08:34] must come into the perfection
[2:08:37] what is that the Holy Spirit has to live
[2:08:40] in that church so perfectly it will make
[2:08:42] the head and the body unite together
[2:08:45] that's the body
[2:08:47] he's the head of the Buddy notice this
[2:08:49] on Masterpiece the life that was in the
[2:08:52] husk
[2:08:52] in the stock in the tassel all God is up
[2:08:56] in the seed
[2:08:57] yeah
[2:08:59] the sea began to pull their life
[2:09:01] so the light God is in the seed hear
[2:09:03] what he said no the light of under the
[2:09:05] stock and that's it that
[2:09:07] is
[2:09:10] talk leaves but the stalker leaves is
[2:09:13] not deceived
[2:09:14] it's when it's reproduced in the
[2:09:16] original state it come back to the
[2:09:17] original
[2:09:18] so when the seed dies what happens they
[2:09:20] push up a stock and that's the ages
[2:09:22] there the unfolding of the life of the
[2:09:24] seed but when it comes to the last age
[2:09:28] spot itself
[2:09:29] which is the seed
[2:09:31] and around the seat of a husk or a shock
[2:09:34] that covers the seed because the seed is
[2:09:36] not ready for the Sun so you'll have a
[2:09:39] shock around it that come into church
[2:09:40] with the seed
[2:09:42] fellowship and break the seed acting
[2:09:44] like the seed but a shock and when the
[2:09:47] sunlight had to hit it so the shock
[2:09:49] dries up and the Sea becomes golden
[2:09:52] brown
[2:09:52] [Applause]
[2:09:54] do you get it now
[2:09:56] that's why when pressure comes the sea
[2:09:58] could handle it the secret take pressure
[2:10:01] the seed will leave church because
[2:10:03] pressure come I done whether it says
[2:10:05] I've done with this Christianity thing I
[2:10:06] finished no no no no no no the sea just
[2:10:08] stayed there and the pressure gets the
[2:10:11] sea to be cold and prone we'll give the
[2:10:13] Lord some Praises now Glory
[2:10:16] are you ready
[2:10:18] one went to meet the other justification
[2:10:21] middleware personification sanification
[2:10:23] made away for the back only goes here we
[2:10:25] go and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:27] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself
[2:10:31] to come right down in Perfection and
[2:10:34] back to the word it's still not living
[2:10:36] the word so you can't talk about
[2:10:38] perfection and no word it has to be back
[2:10:40] to the word oh praise God praise God
[2:10:43] Hallelujah the church will come to

[2:12:16] perfection in Joseph
[2:12:18] there is not one thing recorded against
[2:12:20] Joseph that's the perfection
[2:12:22] he was love of the father
[2:12:24] his father gave him a quarter many
[2:12:25] colors is that right and if you watch
[2:12:28] yeah that robe without seeing
[2:12:31] which represented
[2:12:33] the Holy Spirit
[2:12:35] that cover his being and today is the
[2:12:39] holy spirit that covers the church
[2:12:41] the robe of Many Colors there are seven
[2:12:44] colors in the rainbow
[2:12:45] now I want to assure you that Joseph
[2:12:49] represents the Spirit-filled church
[2:12:52] with the rainbow coat
[2:12:54] so only Joseph have this quote you know
[2:12:57] covered as being
[2:12:59] and Joseph was hated by his brethren and
[2:13:02] he was hated Without a Cause
[2:13:04] what is he called no cause
[2:13:06] no cause at all and people have a spirit
[2:13:09] Hate You Without a Cause
[2:13:11] so the bride will be like Joseph
[2:13:13] she will get the perfection
[2:13:15] he hated
[2:13:17] all being rejected isn't that right
[2:13:20] so Joseph couldn't help being who he was
[2:13:22] look at those four Patriarchs Abraham
[2:13:25] Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham calling Isaac
[2:13:28] election vice versa
[2:13:30] calling Jacob Grace Joseph affection
[2:13:33] nothing against him
[2:13:35] that was God working its way out
[2:13:38] oh my you could go on right here now
[2:13:41] God put a seed in you
[2:13:43] and that seed in you begins to
[2:13:46] work
[2:13:48] its way out
[2:13:49] you're working away out past the mock
[2:13:52] past the Maya past lies past people
[2:13:56] mistreating you past pain and suffering
[2:13:58] the seed working his way out God take
[2:14:01] this from you God cut that offer for you
[2:14:03] but there's a seed inside of you the
[2:14:05] devil didn't put it and the devil can't
[2:14:07] take it out of you that's Joseph that's
[2:14:09] the seat of affection inside of you
[2:14:12] there is nothing against you this
[2:14:13] morning
[2:14:14] if you can only catch that if you can
[2:14:16] only see that this morning
[2:14:18] and I decided we're not talking about
[2:14:20] that we're talking about Revelation
[2:14:21] right now according to this word there
[2:14:23] is nothing against Joseph and Joseph is
[2:14:25] this Capstone bride
[2:14:27] Joseph is this fourth line bride Joseph
[2:14:30] is this word bride the secret is the
[2:14:32] word is in the bride Oh Glory to God
[2:14:35] glory to God hallelujah
[2:14:38] listen to this Luther Wesley
[2:14:42] Pentecost the Capstone and the church
[2:14:46] and the world becomes the same
[2:14:48] so right after Luther Wesley becomes
[2:14:49] what the Capstone
[2:14:51] glory to God
[2:14:54] he said tree is perfection the ministry
[2:14:58] comes to its Perfection when it
[2:15:01] reproduced Christ again in natural among
[2:15:05] human beings
[2:15:06] talk about the ministry now
[2:15:11] foreign
[2:15:18] has come to its Perfection when
[2:15:22] it reproduce Christ again in natural
[2:15:26] among human beings
[2:15:28] example Jesus advisors are winning and
[2:15:31] the wine run out
[2:15:32] what did Jesus do they come and tell
[2:15:35] Jesus listening message Divine run out
[2:15:37] he's selling wine
[2:15:39] Jesus ran in our wine business
[2:15:41] Jesus need to go back and get wine from
[2:15:43] the wine cellars
[2:15:44] what that have to do with he
[2:15:46] he was against everybody else they come
[2:15:47] to Jesus
[2:15:48] and Jesus said take water
[2:15:50] and fill it and draw it
[2:15:53] and somebody said whatever he said
[2:15:56] do it
[2:15:57] whatever he said just do it
[2:15:59] and they went on the draw water and when
[2:16:01] the poor
[2:16:03] it pour into wine
[2:16:05] and people who is wine drinkers
[2:16:07] everybody has leave you all wine for
[2:16:09] last it looked like you lived the best
[2:16:10] wine for last
[2:16:12] into the wine
[2:16:15] he began at the best wine
[2:16:16] Jesus bypass the process
[2:16:19] of cautionary grapes
[2:16:21] of mixing within water of Covenant
[2:16:24] energy leaving it 90 days and 100 days
[2:16:26] he bypass all of that he killed all of
[2:16:28] that and turn the water into wine hey he
[2:16:31] turned the word into stimulation of
[2:16:32] Revelation
[2:16:33] God could take the word you're hearing
[2:16:36] and bring it stimulation to you you
[2:16:38] leave here saying it it's eaten nice it

[2:18:05] this great spirit we call him Elohim the
[2:18:08] self-existent one that was before he was
[2:18:10] God he wasn't always God he was one
[2:18:13] security called Elohim self-existed one
[2:18:16] because God is the object of worship and
[2:18:18] there was nothing to worship because he
[2:18:20] was there by himself existing with his
[2:18:22] thoughts and then he created the angels
[2:18:24] and the angels worship him and then he
[2:18:27] become God but before he was God he was
[2:18:29] Elohim the thought and you were in his
[2:18:32] thought you were in his thinking you
[2:18:34] were not yet expressed but you were part
[2:18:37] of him he was thinking about you and
[2:18:39] when he spoke it became a word and in
[2:18:42] the beginning was the word and the Word
[2:18:44] was with God and the Word was God but
[2:18:47] before it was a word it was a thought
[2:18:49] and earlier I'm thinking you were one of
[2:18:52] them jeans in his thinking you can't
