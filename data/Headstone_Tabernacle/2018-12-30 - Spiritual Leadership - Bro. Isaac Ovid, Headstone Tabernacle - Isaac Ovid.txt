today in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says a many many many men you may be seated for a few minutes are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning happy to be in the presence of the Lord this morning knowing that all things are possible knowing that there is no better place to be than in the presence of the Lord and amen I like to welcome Virginia still English yet god bless you welcome to the answering Tabernacle invites it by sister Bernadette and also it's so good to see brother George Mahon god bless you good to have you back in

passed nothing present nothing can separate us from the love of God Amen you may be seated and it's so good to be coming down to the end of 2018 and facing a new year new season and new opportunities it's a reminder to us that there's there's a possibility there's no hope there's a chance that something could happen for us if we could have the faith to believe that he is still a miracle worker you still a healer he is still a Baptizer he is still a restorer how many appreciate the service last week where August message from South Africa what a tremendous blessing and I they're having a time in Ghana Berube the preach last night again but all who preach this morning and we're a daily and where the context flows another meaning in Ghana but Paul's book as well and what a mighty victory I listened about his message from last night and my what a mighty mighty mighty visitation of God and we are we are under something and the devil cannot stop it the devil cannot stop it so ever thought this morning that I want to share with you and I pray that will be a blessing to you and I was just tearing in fact I was helping out with some cleaning at home and my wife was in the room and I said a thought just came to me you said what I said the thought just came to me you know and I was you know just many didn't seen you know going into unknown territory you need leadership you know and the thought is beginning to open up to me about spiritual leadership or without a spiritual leader we don't know where we're going and by the Branum taught us who the spiritual leader is the spiritual leader is not a man the spiritual leader is not there's not a human being the spiritual leader is the Holy Ghost he is the leader the Holy Ghost is the leader the Holy Ghost is the headquarters so as we approach 2019 you know my burden in my heart is for us to be led and for us to be able to follow it's one thing to have a leader but if you don't know how to follow the leader then you just as bad as if there is no leader because you don't follow and then as I was looking through the prophets message in December of 2000 60s December story of 1965 when the Prophet left us the the very last message he preached was the message communion and just before that message what message did he preach leadership so but a random was leaving us with a nugget about leadership just before he went on to be with the Lord and he said a lot of powerful thing in those things in that message so we're gonna touch what the Lord wants us to touch depending on him this morning thank you musicians you appreciate a song service this morning and you might want an anointing so let's get straight to the wood if you have your Bibles would you turn it me we just gonna want or ssin of scripture reading from Romans eat and reading from verse 1 this morning Romans eat reading from first one when you have it you could see men there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I want you to take note of this for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God I want to say it again they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye I'm not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be so he's giving further clarity yeah I'm not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his so if you are here this morning and there's no spirit of Christ in you you ought to run quickly to get that spirit of Christ in you because according to Paul's very clear teaching he's not mincing words here he's not trying to make people feel okay he's bringing it Clare he's bringing it direct now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you not with you but in you the body is dead because of simba the spirit of life this is but a spirit is life because of righteousness and then he goes on but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you and umberto this message he preached it gonna last you say one day you're gonna realize that a raptor is in you you're not looking for the rapture but it's already inside of you it's a rapture in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh but if we live after the flesh he shall die but if he true the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as I led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God so there are many people who claim to be sons of God but the qualification of sons of God those are not led by the Spirit of God and the Spirit of God could only lead you into certain places spirits of God cannot lead you into fornication the Spirit of God cannot leave you with the last time and lying him and the Spirit of God can lead you to I don't feel like coming to church today that can't be the spirit talking to you if you don't feel like worship and you're feeling because a spirit of clock only lead you to himself the Spirit of God can only lead you to the word spread of clock only lead to worship the Spirit of God leads you to counter things that I'm not as though the world the Spirit of God lead you to look at your sickness and say these are lying symptoms that that everything is of the demon and this demon has got to go through as many as I led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God but he have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but he have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit itself Piron witness with our spirit that we are children of God so it's not just we are saying we are cheering up God but the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit it's not me saying I know carpenters corpse say I know you the spirit man witness with our spirit that we are cheering of God and if children then is as mean you have an inheritance and means you have access heir me and you have rights then is heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him how many wanna suffer with him this morning how many wanna suffer with him this morning that we may be also glorified together I'm not sure everybody raise your hands with it turns on the suffering so I reckon that the sufferings of this present time I'm not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God made a lot of a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning and you can give the Lord a hand clap or praise let's it be the name of the Lord I feel very inspired this morning I believe this is our season I believe this is our time I believe this is our hour I believe this is what we were born for this is what we were born to do this is why we are here we're not here to get degrees and have a job and to have a can't have a house those are those are things you pick up along the way but I start our purpose those are part of the journey but we have a destination and it's to shake this world it's a turn things upside down it's to be conquerors it's to be rulers it's to be leaders he said you are royal priesthood you are kings you are priests he's speaking to leaders not speaking to followers a king is a leader a priest is a leader God came to call leaders not followers [Applause] we're gonna say a few things then we gonna get into the word too many people follow him following all kind of suffering by the Brandon proto there that they're only two influences they're not five influences they're not sixteen in the only two you influence from above or your influence from below nothing happens in the world with our leadership but they're Brandon Prager that's a child so we need to lead you to learn to help y'all to walk he said usually it's your mom who helps you and then your father he say he may not even be smarter than your mom better bound brought all that out but the leader is the father in the house it has nothing to do with his knowledge or his intellectuals qualification that's just how God set it up deal with it go back to the script you have a problem with it that's cause order God established that week she said growing up somebody has to lead you to any way to school and your school teacher had the chops to leave you and to teach you how to add and how to write your name but all of these human leaders were were what temporary because you were being groomed for real leadership and groom to being taught by the great tutor who is to show you who you really are not in this humanistic natural perspective but who you are as a teen of God because who you I hear is only a reflection of where you come from somewhere else if there was no other existence there will be no existence for you here representation by predestination so your nature your being your attribute your appetite what you like what you deal with the only way you could be here this morning because somewhere else in a nother dimension in another place [Music] there's another being that's just like you there's an appeal that has your attribute there's another peer that is a representation of you in another place [Applause] that's rapid advances death doesn't change who you are it just change your dwelling place if there was no representation over there you could not be worshiping here no wonder culture doctor where was Darwin and lay the foundation of the earth morning stars sang together because you were there you should appreciate what you're going through hear and understand that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us there's a glory that's coming but that glorious tide of suffering that glorious title we are in the reproach of the word of that glorious tide to you letting go of certain things up and taking some kind of pressure 20:18 oh it's hard that's good the harder it is the more pressure is the most suffering it is the more beautiful the glory the more you squeeze the rose the more the fragrance of the Rose of Sharon to come out oh come on let's be mature this morning how is spiritual this morning leadership when we hear the word leadership a number of things come to mind there's political leadership there's military leadership any student of history there's certain names you don't even know them by lastly we just have one name Caesar one name Moses leaders left such a mark on the world you just need to hear one in money you're not confused because they were leaders they did something that was different that went against the green that maybe other people said could not be done when the Wright brothers decided to build a aeroplane they were leaders something was anointing them something was inspiring them to do what had not been done before if they had listened to the criticism and followed everybody else the plane would have never been built Somali preach to me [Music] there were other Jewish people is other Israel people around the time of Daniel but Daniel was different because Santa was anointing him to do what others don't want to do you see leaders cut their own path Lina's are not afraid to deal with challenges leaders are not afraid to stand alone followers need to be part of something that's why the whole gang mentality is because of the bunch of followers and they just want to be part of something that whereever we don't know but we go in but a leader could go against the crowd where you're going I'm inspired I'm seeking a city whose builder and maker is caught up not sure exactly where I'll end up but I'm believe it my family because I'm being led oh come on somebody please back to me so with the fathers in the house it's impossible future truly need unless you are being led it's like we're the only bridge when God was in control of Adam Adam had control over the years so his controllers based on the controller quart or hat over him so one moment the control from God was lost to Adam because he broke the Covenant Adams control of the earth also lost but when a man is being led by God it becomes easier to lead us family because he is under leadership under Authority the Centurion said I am a man under authority when I see him - uncle he was part of something bigger there's a higher ranking a Centurion so he understood because I'm under the authority if these men step off the line I can go higher than my rank and bring more soldiers to deal with my ready kids because I understand I am under authority I could give an instruction and say to one go and he has to go and I recognize Jesus are you also a man under Authority you come from a different place you come from a different power what does Jesus say I am the father one I will are you with me this morning the Christ is what our young people is their friend step out they are afraid to be out balls they are afraid to dress right act right because they want to follow what other people are doing but God is looking for leaders because he is the great leader there's no leader like our leader people celebrate their country's leader there their company leader but our leader is different with our leader he makes no mistakes our leader has never lost a battle our leader said all that the father has given me my son did have a choice our leader even when Lazarus was dead was able to take a dead man and bring him back to worship our leader is the only one to say I can lay my life down I pick it up again find me another leader to follow I've been looking for a leader to follow my whole life find me one who can lay his life down and pick it up again somebody say many may be seated I heard someone say yesterday he said to all the different religions he had no problem with no religion at all you say if you live in my morals and values one thing but he said you know what he said if you ever write a check you acknowledge that Jesus was here because the deed system is ad and BC so whether you're this or that or this or that it don't matter the fact that a man could have lived on this earth for thirty three and a half years and for thousands and years and a hundred years we still recorded before he was here and after he was here that's a leader can I talk about my leader this morning you ever say I'm talking with a leader who took men who couldn't write their names and there's a book of Peter oh come on somebody somebody talk back to me this morning man with no education but when the Holy Ghost came upon these men you may be seated in business school they tell you leadership is about influence Jesus has never forced anybody to follow him he's a gentleman he I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice but his voice is so sweet he said my sheep know my voice the momma Dee snapped up is that your leader my sheep know my voice and a stranger's voice they will not follow that's why you are here this morning you didn't come to hear man you can take here I'll fly such a great Shepherd because you are sheep oh come on somebody bridge back to me you may receive it we having a conversation this morning because what do we work for 2019 we want to be led more than the lead us to the right job but they lead us at the right time sometimes caught our laws and booty and stick you in traffic because down the road you don't know what's gonna happen at quarters the Angels top the light make sure no it's not time for you to go yet because there's something going on down there when that's over you record you did frustrated DAV said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth me beside the still waters he [Applause] you know I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why because I were leader a great leader he could see beyond what I could see he can feel the change coming he knows how to protect me he knows how to provide for me he knows what my family needs you know what my house means he knows what I need you may be seated [Music] in speaking about leadership and a random typed US which as the Bible as a sheep and sheep I'm meant to be led she paid when I say you know what I got she caste is no clue you know she got planned no Kuen sheep are meant to be led but God caused Bulls horses you ever see what's nice Treasuries and horses I'm buzzing in many Wild West Minotauro hunting and lasso and have dog sir and pull them in and to break the horse and brick thing I'm Khaleesi period and I wanna fight him I don't wanna be kids but sheep come come you'll come but the problem with cheap is because sheep are men to be led didn't to be cautious what voice they listen to her because she was so vulnerable Brandon brought her that when it's time for shifted dyeing they should do what you know what but the promises they put out good I mean she was such a good follower that is she polity good and he caught no Jess how to jump over the slaughter thing and any sheep still following and one by one because his sheep is meant to follow so cause leadership is different than the women's leadership is and that's why sitting young people and I want you to understand this God is not about rules and and lean on law he's about influence and love and as you as a sheep and as those that I in love with God the more we get to love God and understand his love for us then we want to please him it not only becomes this is what I do and this is because it passes singing because noise because I love him so much I don't want to hurt him I love him so much I can't wait to talk to him I love him so much I can't wait to come into the presence of the Lord kinda should say man for this thing of leadership God has always wanted to lead his church himself but the Branham said this he said God was eventually gonna humanize his leadership the record humanity leadership how true Christ so another leadership through the Old Testament the first thing that should have been put in place was supposed to be Jesus that's the prophets teaching and a Robert brought her to the scripture that up until the same of the prophet Samuel everybody with me this morning it had been prophets and spiritual leaders but Abraham call it God was father King father and King but the tune of Israel in the current cycle look around and say poet now the Philistines have a king why do I have a king - and it bothered Sammy well so much that the Lord Souls animal Samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me and that is how King Saul came to be king and while Saul was hidden there's a little shepherd who was being trained and how to work with sheep that wild Saul was in office God is speaking as Samuel and say I've found a better man to do this thing this is know whatever I wanted but under the circumstances I've already found a better man a man after my own heart and that's how David became King then the church say Amen so leadership isn't about title this done about position is not about leadership is about influence and when Abram said to differentiate you said the Christian ought to be the most ambitious boost in the world you can't be ambition Delia follow Anna you have to be ambitious about the kingdom of God he said bring this glorious gospel of eternal life to a dying and perishing world but if I said when there is no real courtly leader then the people begin to get into a morals I think that's what the matter with us today in our nation and our children and things we need godly leaders somebody has set an example the decline in this world is because of these two influences so the politicians as much as they can have the best of intentions they have been influenced to change the laws to make things acceptable error and we're never acceptable before the change our environment to change our because there are leaders and they are leaving and there be as well man in Genesis was made in the image of God Adam was led by the spirit he walked by the spirit he moved by the spirit in the cool of the evening God's Spirit God would come and commune with Adam can the church see man and everything was in order there was there was nothing out of place there was perfect fellowship perfect communion God will come down as he Adam how was your day and Adam could see well I moved this mountain and and this this lion I like he was good over there but I totally better over here I told him lion move over there and he did that because Adam was a leader on it under the Great Father God King Eli can the church say man but a pranam used the word divine fellowship Adam had the vine from the Supreme Court and Court was pleased is anybody here this morning one divine fellowship with God not divine phallus about the church not to be a sorcerer with a church but a relationship with God and God was pleased but when sin came it brought a disconnect and that sin brought hiding that sin brought here that shouldn't brought shame and still to this data people hiding hiding in the church hiding in shame but God comes to restore Adam did not know initially that there was a way back Adam didn't understand that there was blood and a blood sacrifice that existed before even he was there that God foresaw all of this taking place and here it was Adam feeling his hood he feeling troubled and I didn't even know that it was power in the blood he had his own interpretation and the drive fig leaves to cover him because they knew they were naked but God are already a provided way for restoration it wasn't gonna be his interpretation to bring them back it wasn't gonna be your way of doing it on my way of doing it but God already had a provided way to bring this black to fellowship God as leader saw sheep I got a string and he didn't leave it upon the Sheep to find a way back God walk out and met to see where the world or somebody preached back to me so close I'm leaving it up to you to find your way back he's smarter provided we a NASA provided a way to reach you in your job reach you in your school reach whoever you are so you could know that he is your Shepherd he is your protector he is your kind he is your provider he is your keeper oh can the church see manna and we go on to keen and evil and we know what happened they were put in church they're poor had some revelation the poor had some understanding but email got a genuine revelation of this blood sacrifice thing and even on the inspiration he was looking for the most beautiful offering but he took a lamb and he slit the truth of the lamb and the blood to get just spewing Oh God's not good because he saw a type of the lamb that was slain for the sins of the world God feel good evil didn't reveal that to himself but the great leader dropped something in a bear's hat so he could know what this was the way back on the church semen Oh hallelujah hallelujah a type of the perfect sacrifice not to cover up your sit not to cover up what you're doing but the perfect sacrifice I would take away the sin as if you never did it in the first place as you can never fell in the first place as if it never back slid in the first place as if I never doubted in the first place as even never fell away in the first place the perfect sacrifice friends the more revelation you get the simpler everything's becoming because you don't need your intellect we are getting back to the leadership of the spirit and the spirit could only leave you to the revealed Word of the D the spirit cannot leave you now to be a Baptist or Methodist or a Pentecostal the spirit has to leave you to your message so your name in the book this Bible is a sealed book anybody can pick it up but when you read it it's a sealed book because God sent a prophet send messengers to unlock the secrets of this great book so we can sign away black to even find our way back to fellowship letter sheep we could look in here and see who we are see the pathway because this whole book is about the great Shepherd but the Planum said if you read the Bible and don't see Jesus in every verse you to read it again this whole book is about bringing sheep back into the pasture this whole book is about restoring your fellowship we saw in your joy restoring your health up restoring your promise restoring your covenant restoring your family restoring your fellowship Oh somebody help me this morning led by the Spirit who is leading you this morning Oh hallelujah the screwed will never leave you it's a place you should not go Oh hallelujah hallelujah who's leading you this morning who's leading you to do the things that you are doing you better check yourself this morning because if you're being led the wrong way you need to find another leader but the Holy Ghost is the leader and the Holy Ghost will only lead you to the promised world the Holy Ghost will only lead you to the token the Holy Ghost will only leave you to the rapture the Holy Ghost will leave the cleaner life out the Holy Ghost when you eat it's a party the Holy Ghost will use the grand smoke and drink that's not the Holy Ghost but when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and begins to lead you we can suppose you begin to not you he's trying to take complete control now he's leading you and it'll be external at first he'd be pointing you hear nothing you'd hear but his goal is to get control to lead from the inside here's one lead from the outside because he says they are led by the spirit they are the sons of God his goal is to get complete control he doesn't want to leave you on a Sunday he doesn't want to leave you on a Wednesday you want to leave you everything he was a leave you for what time to pick up your phone he was a leader to what time to leave your house up he was the leader to when you need to pray he was a leader to watch scriptures you supposed to leader he wants to lead you to any suppose a shout have assaulted before oh come on somebody please back to me spiritual leadership not the leadership of man you may be sweet you receive it when we go to our doctor we go to a doctor because they are Lena in their own right you know how to do the medication and they'll lead you to give you instructions take this medication take this and you faithfully understand the instruction you take the leadership and you take your medicine in order and you make sure you do it because they are leading you you got a lawyer he's a leader he's in your tone see this see this this way don't do this sign here don't sign it he's leading you below we are meant to be led but too many of us we depend on the lawyer we depend on the top top we depend on the neighbor we depend on their family and people leading us here until you graver know where to find yourself because this wasn't a call here go and do this and I'm chorus waitin to give you because he is the only lawyer you never need he's the only doctor you never need somebody please back to me there people have more feet in their doctor than doctor Jesus but if he ever operates on you you don't need operation again somebody help me please just warning if he ever gets your kiss there's no kiss he takes over that cannot be won in any court because the course of man has subjected a course of God he thought whatsoever you bind on earth I climb in heaven I'll bind a lawyer I'll bind a judge [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] spiritual leadership somebody preached back to me Joshua was a leader and when I came to take over Jericho this leader recognized he was at the end of his limit he needed not no counsel not no generals the men around him couldn't help him he needed spiritual leadership he's anybody had his personal leadership this morning that's what he's speaking about he had a situation he had a challenge he had a confrontation and he is there because he knows he kind of depend on his men so he's in the spirit he's Terry and he's he can't move yet until his direction what did I promise I'm waiting I'm waiting on something the Prophet is waiting on the leader wait on the Holy Ghost with an angel of the Lord he's waitin for the leader to direct what to pray for and when he comes he said he's over there stand up and receive your healing because a leader had stepped into the building oh I'm waiting for him this morning are you waiting for him this morning to step into your house and step into your situation and step into your life when he steps in everything is all right he may be seated today as Joshua Joshua the warrior Joshua he has seen things he was one of 12 men all leaders you know what I'm talking about right this is before they reach King's Landing everybody feeling fine put up a little notes here now what they can I get my notes I want you to understand how how am i suffered when two million people walk out in Egypt 2 million oh no but GZ 2 million people come out and when the time come to go into this land that they are heard about it already stories passed on from father to son one day it's a promised land they had heard about it land florid milk honey is our land and when the time come to cross over define 12 men I want you to understand how excited it was to have been selected you must be 12 another 2 million people [Music] sumwa soffit kill em eagle Joshua party Korea Gauri Ailsa - nabhi and gear I know some of you didn't know their names but those are the 12 brothers the hell they had chosen as leaders for God's people these were not have been light men you know because out of two million if you said in many promise I'm gonna find it very best men yet forgiving anybody to go and spy all this land you want to get it very best man for tribe so as these men supported upon is already there whole tribe saying yes that's our man bring back the report of how good a man is and one by one and men walk all day with his swords walking into this land of promise all leaders all knew the promise and when they got there they started eating grapes when the God didn't started tasty milk and honey and when they cut day they all saw the Giants it is not that these men were not brave enough these men died they all came back so the mission was accomplished what they went for because they brought back the report they were successful spies and they delivered a report the content of the report was a problem everything was correct except the conclusion the land is as described it's beautiful the grapes better than described honey when I tell you there's no honey ladies honey I see the striping is little chest doing it is perfect that's where we need to be that is the Promised One is we didn't was really wrong we went to the correct land this is the Promised Land we somebody else please this is the place that was described to us conclusion regarding leadership is about facing the challenge and meeting the challenge and Wendy Sparrow pottery test they give up Caleb and Joshua came back later as we all know because they was in a Terry a little moment with the grapes I mean Lannon walking a little better and put their foot in it I feel comfortable that this was theirs when they cut back then thought I was gonna get back to see everybody with his heel and his sword and spear ready to go in the Bible see when the club party who'll come you know just when fight will crime is is being horrible song he was he had two million people right and Caleb and Joshua cut back there and see what is going on I'm Bill Rancic he left a load box instead we seen let us go up at once but he damaged I believe it was already done sheep had already gone and because of that this is so cool so good so good forty years until the time appointed so I can imagine now that when Joshua came back around and was now facing Jericho there was no fear he had been through things before but he needed something more than his own understanding he needed spiritual leadership and as he stood there there was a noise and Joshua not taking chances drew in short right away I say are you for us or are you against us and I say put down your sword I am the great leader I'm the angel of the Covenant I come to give you the instructions on how to take this land and you will take it on this ways I will leave you and how to take it I will give it the directives on how to take it that Jericho in your life I will tell exactly how the ticket I know I've been waiting for leadership on how to do it for the whole 28 you know you don't know how to confront the situation but I come to let you know exact know to do it and the first thing gonna walk around one time don't shout yet just walk around and then come back they wanna take it as exercising but that's alright just keep it motors humming because the activity is important because they do at least they will know you're not dead just keep on walking make one lap gonna come back out on the second day do the same thing only till they do the same thing only 42 the same thing only 50 do the same thing on this sexy do this only seven day after you do it in normal way and they get comfortable at senior doing it this way do it again and then do it again I wanna do it seven times I will show so they can never shot before listen anybody listening to these instructions wouldn't understand how this thing works but just show us under leadership and when you are under leadership in this after all peak and when you obey transfer see when I picture show shout and when they shouted rather the walls begin to crumble because a spiritual leader had showed him exactly what to do can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah but a random said God as always wanted to lead us you know he's any problem with us we like to lead ourselves I really let other people leaders you say we don't want to wait to hear how to do it so you want to do it ourselves we rusty promise we're us just because we don't want to wait but corners are right timing here's a right way to do things is a way he does things are you looking to do it the right way for 2019 look into approach things more prayerfully look at this alone I'm waiting you before I go this way I want to hear from you put quad challenge court Gideon say listen listen if you see you are who you are then I need a saying each island girl you say if I put this Frisian and I mean get with it and keep code Tillis never do it I'm gonna make sure that I'm a lady right way I don't want to do things in my own strength I wanted to think of my own ability because I want to be led can the church amen from the message expectation brother branham said the same reason you are here tonight you sick people the same holy goes out let's see me on the same hole equals Atlanta Anna has led you here for you to believe that has a function open somewhere for your healing it's God's moving among his people young sister young brother the Holy Spirit will not lead you to listen to worldly music the Holy Spirit will I leave you to no boy in the world or girl in the world and then we end up in trouble you're coming to God and say well god help me and see what I never let you there you never came and get my advice you never acts to my leadership no you may want a bailout package I wanted to sink in friends because actions have consequences and when you do your own thing there will be consequences to do any whole thing I wanted to sink in deep because this is what it is this is kindly minded depending on your own self and you're not conscious of the spirit around man you're operating in the Lord and you're operating in it's different than the laws of the world I'm talking to you this a plant in your heart that this new year the Lord spare life for you you were two things differently not just from this year but every year in the past because look back through your history whenever you did think you always end up in trouble there's only one right way and that's God's Way and the whole what do you know is God's Way it's lines up with the word but a brannamon preaching on these things said it's not it's not hard to know if he's certainly leading you you spilled already told you don't forsake the assembling of ourselves together he spirit already told you don't be unequally yoked this word already told you flee youthful lusts because the Bible is the written form of the spirit and the spirit anyone cannot contradict itself so I don't a--first go out telling me no because what happened and what had happened was the office was having something and the moment he stopped the story so it kind of end up right the moment you start with what had happened was because that is Eve explanation well it and everybody is he blame game it wasn't me it was the boss what happened I just got promoted now so I didn't want to just see no just director to find another way to see no because I know I'm not supposed to steer you know but I said I said I steer very sadly very tour are more outside than in I know deeper hours on that side yeah but as I said by here and then they tell me well why you have to explain yourself the Holy Spirit will not lead you with her she replays one thing let's honor there's nothing left or no other there's no one thing leading and see the whole is really leading you or it devil in you [Music] the Bible says listen the road to hell is people the best of intentions and nothing people don't start off but I said and I said people don't ever say I want to go on nobody says I want to end up a drug addict nobody says that but it starts with influence small influence take a pull dos building you too young for a critical pool okay good take that and before you do you realize it your foot on top your head you can't find back your balance flee youthful lusts we appreciate a couple resist the devil and he will flee from you Jack your leadership this morning and it's not just for young people see with all of the moment the moment I see when you really have to fix and adjust your clothes you feel a not justice he was not just in before about Julia Benny Konaseema is fix it a little better something wrong because I am NOT yo Lewis and he's even watching you all the time when I can't see you what led you to dress that way I was sharing with my web the other day people like to blame and I said if you really accept responsibility moment you are the age of accountability you are responsible at that point if playing game is over you can't blame your children well if you know what my son tell me dies why I brake the car that's why you bring me what because you get so vex perhaps they're foolish woman destroy house with her own hands no nobody has ever what will lead you I see people get vexed wacky effects your husband and do you respond to so I'm break all he plates any any homes it's not your place is his place and when it done you were sparked up when it be here anybody have to clean it up because then you realize the gravity of the foolishness the magnitude of it in a and was it a future him okay sorry sorry wouldn't let you because but AB random Christian I want to this is not to make it comical but it's the reality of it because as either we have been led to Christ away from Christ because the Holy Ghost is a gentleman and the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit you grieve the holy sweat by your behavior by your conduct because the Holy Ghost is a tough it is gentle it is waited for the right time when your spirit is sweeter perfume man and your wife sees only against you and it is my like pj go with your roof on you relax yourself some of us we have some great up to do and God will keep us with this class there's no there's no skipping no classes with God you will t be class over and over and over until you pass because what is promised is power and to handling power you have to have character so some of us who are twenty eighteen degree C in class over you temper class with the temper class we still in temper class every man right there is D tempered glass God send something to Tessy temper some of us that praying that we would have improved but you have to pass it s because if it didn't pass the test in 2018 you have it in January 2019 waiting for you are give the tests of husband love your wife [Music] not just your win or not as well we said known as your father loved your mother you know but as Christ loved the church it's not really love supposed to be the split not your own understanding of it but we already have the understanding of it husband loved it whereas Christ loved the church is a way to do it I'm Cora give it taste upon test and pontus and he took a vow before God and you witnesses until death do your part and God making sure and keep your life until you pass the test can somebody say Amen but something has to leave you leave you to feed foot to knowledge temperance patience will lead you into righteousness lead you into perfection lead you it's our job to leave you it's a new walk and you talk a new behavior a new type of action the disciples confused if people who knew them on tell em to take North that they had been with Jesus and he was such a great leader people couldn't believe it was he st. Peter the same came the same John because something had come over them that she who is leading you this morning we need spiritual leadership I'm challenging all the fathers established to prayer closet the prayer altar in your house who leading her away from that because this year spiritual leadership this morning because that's in the word pray without ceasing men ought to pray and not to faint to many theaters so they're primitive men out cold but a bouncy little hoodie real churches do it call a prayer meetin in Syria churches we're gonna do some good testing this year 2019 serious prayer meeting our effort to provision get the real country the lot of religious spirits in on Sundays church it gets up breath is like a commitment like it have to be there and church another drug it's not a fix it's not and many of you may be max fix or come next time because you're gonna make it yes I gotta make it that's positive reinforcement this is deeper than that there's a seed in your soul that is getting ready to be redeemed this can be casual to you you are being led into a journey all of her problems lie she was being left on my baby don't smoke don't drink don't defile your body I have a work to do he peed and it being unfallen to him over time he didn't even understand it it was only a steal of his wife and lost his child God's I was just testing you and he was led that journey spiritual leadership the Holy Spirit will never lead you to do your wrong thing the Holy Spirit kind of do that because he cannot go against his good so if you find yourself doing the wrong things then it's not the Holy Spirit leading you you can go back to the altar and say Lord take this desire out of me you think I'll leave me Lord I'll follow lead me Lord I will bow if you live that way you will not end up in trouble but always talk but we head into the wilderness to be tested have you trouble you in as you lead yourself in the trouble you to see but but everything you choose eat hamburger and a whole set of cheese and pepper too am any morning and then speak up six o'clock series ascending out the delegate and blame footing he even do he's like well my name I wasn't even

you looking back at yourself with all your batteries you can look again until you see you were living out and waiting to lift you would can you see your children look at you different and you become a magnet because Jesus did not do big grand education trying to put poet intellectuals but his life was a magnet Peters life became a magnet Paul's life became a magnet just by the way they live can the

follow Jesus no turning back no turning back let that be your prayer today I have decided to follow Jesus I have this study tool of the Holy goes to lead me whether he leaves you in a trial that his tries to lead you into a trial because if he leaves you in that trial is a trial design to develop your character but don't put yourself in trouble because you were feeling that go into trouble and

rule in your life its flesh could be your mind your flash your food anything if anything you just music your clothes your company your words let your words glorify God always let your dress glorify God let the people you spend time with who you spending time with because if you are not the influencer positively then you are being influenced and if you're not so never nobody because you this you are recluse you are hermit that is also of the early because if I said God and the only word I'm preaching gospel you supposed to be influencing you didn't see let's lock up in a room it's one thing

doesn't matter if you're about job it doesn't matter because there's something else controlling you can the church is this happen anybody this morning could we keep on going in return and Jubilee but if I said the church is a born-agains bunch of believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost so that's a definition of the church it's not measured by attendance or knowledge or interpretation but the church is a born-again bunch of believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the Spirit of God they are not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world that's what make them what they are different from the world so if people can tell you are different than the world then you don't qualify for this coat come on somebody preach back to me there has to be something different about your walk there has to be a better way a more excellent way because you are a Christian because you are in the bride because you are in the body because you are called because you are separated because you are chosen people because you are peculiar people and the church see man they are different from the world maybe be different from the world maybe be happy to be different on the world may be happy hava testimony I don't drink I don't smoke I don't party I'm happy that was testimony because clogged up the whole of my life it's not my own choosing but his love reached me where I was and get something inside of me I can't help myself though a thousand fallen my right ten thousand and I shall not be moved I'm different I'm happy to be different you may be seated we have rights we have rights in this world we live in everybody one rights the case is lesbian every we have right to I have rights to be different also have a right to worship have a right have a testimony I'm a right to lift the Bible and live the message of this great hour don't make me feel uncomfortable because I'm a Christian I'm proud to be a Christian I'm happy to be a Christian [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you may be seated people happy to walk the streets to tell people who they are happily to dress and do what they want and that's what you want seen listen this is who I am but this is who we are this is what we do we are born to worship we are born to manifest the life of Jesus right we are born to cast out demons we are born to be adopted oh come on come on come on somebody help me not anymore the Bible said my people shall never be ashamed never be ashamed never be ashamed don't be ashamed at his gospel don't be ashamed of the wonder-working power of the blood not ashamed to call cincin not ashamed to call holiness holiness not ashamed to call modesty modesty not ashamed to come to the house of God not ashamed to have a brand meeting not a shame

some boy in the next church and ding ding ding I see has he been in church well sometimes he cannot believe and I said what did he prophets say I said he prophesied under no circumstances should I believe I'm Mario unbeliever there's no truth interpretation of that is either we in the prophet mentioned we not see any prophet message you say unknown know circumcised should I believe a minor

the leader of this church [Music] you may be seated and shame on you weak parents who tell your kids nonsense about who have money who don't have money whose what nonsense you're talking about where

were born into this thing they didn't know about this thing I told them about the gospel but they pitched a tent toward Sodom another 50 40 30 I'm glad for the burden in Abraham's heart and he said I'm not gonna let them die bottom shelf arrangers in the middle of hell come on come on come on come on sent me oh god help me you lot didn't even realize that the cries of Abraham is what was pulling

world [Music] God loves you and because he loves you and Yanis your faith your family must come I don't hear where they are right now I don't care what the situation is right now but you have power to call upon God you have the power to move Jesus on the scene woman with the issue of blood she didn't have the Holy Ghost we don't even know if she went to service before but she just heard that Jesus was in town the Bible said she ran out of her money she had ran out of her strength and she told herself no preacher encouraged her not ella Minnesota ha no D consent with her she had a conversation with herself she came to the service like everybody else but she came with an agenda she came with a purpose she didn't even come to hear Jesus oh god help us she never come to hear the message she just came with a need and sisters if I could just touch the hem of His garment my faith is really enough if I could just touch the hem of His garment I know I'm gonna be made whole I preached this before that woman when she could take but a brand on grammar times there would have been people around Jesus there were many people touching Jesus but none were pulling from Jesus her clothes they were in the church but he were not pulling from the ministry but this woman she don't wanna shake Jesus his hand she wasn't touching him of his comment you can't touch the hem standing up that woman cut down on her knees she was between who she had to push through because she has wanted to touch the hem of His garment and when she touched him she said who touched me I felt that you left me I felt he left me I felt deliverance left me I felt restoration left me I've got a break who left me somebody touched me is there anybody here this morning who wants to touch the hem of His garment is there anybody here this morning with a need so great you know you will even come to the altar while the service is going on between them come to hear good service but you came for a leader to be mad I'm not leaving this service until I got what I came for I'm not letting this here pass me by until I guess what I came for I'm elected 2018 and I said I guess what I came for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] remember the Billy Paul was in trouble and he came to his father but about him said to him son you did the sinan you go to the praying there's no excuse for this you've got to do what you got to do you've got to get your house in order is either you accept your situation as permanent or you resolve to change it there are only two options it is either you accept that your son is in the world or your resolve today that is gonna change not by their own action but by you storm in heaven like that widowed woman who went to the door of the unjust judge who didn't regard God or man in other words you couldn't tell that man court sent you he has no regard for God have no regard for man but that woman knock on the door until the adjuster said enough is enough I can't take it no more what you want what you want what you want have you knocked on the door until God said what you want or not once and see well here and Sonia you are not you have you reached a point yet when enough is enough because when you reach your breaking point of desperation till you know I won the Holy Ghost more than life itself I want my son to have an experience more than anything else I want my daughter to have an experience I want my family I want to apply the blood on my house I know my son is in trouble I know my daughter-in-law is in trouble but lord I would have knocked on the door I'm gonna knock when nobody else is watching I'm gonna go and walk on the street and call upon your name no demon could touch you because you are protected by angels you can walk and say God I need you and call with the space angels I'm sorry for those who who measure service by time today is not that be I'm feeling just as strong as when I first as it out this is our thing I combine with youth I was young too young people feel that that what they go and show no we understand not as young as I used to be buzzy seemed devil different tactics different weapons different tools how the enemy is so deceitful but abarim stood and said shoot the TV because of what was coming through the movies now we have voice on TV because every cell phone is a supercharged weapon that he'd ever just sending all kinds of stuff in me say should be for now so may say if you want to know how many people home just switch off the Wi-Fi you wonder get a head count let's switch off the Wi-Fi see we'll come on the rooms didn't know existed people connected to the Internet connected to politics connected to economic is connected to celebrities and information and they're being slowly sippin on this juice of iniquity styles from whoever it is and they don't even understand this influence and hold the desire to behold he's disappearing the problem is God doesn't change so he says I am holy and I changed not so we changed but he does not change his requirement has the cheetah standard has not change his laws have not changed meanwhile what was never accepted years ago laws are being adjusted that forces the sodom and gomorrah situations and we have become softer because we ought to be tolerant iniquity but God will never tolerate energy you will never tolerate sin there's no exception to the rules of God and that's why but a parent city will have to shut down the churches that's why because the laws were change and it's either you bend to the laws or you stand up for what is right but the panel said the bride will be a hunted persecuted group let's see how many could see another anointing you don't have a testimony now when the press comes when the squeeze comes when the pressure comes and that's why all the foolishness and the massive awards and groups on division then I'm gonna ask you which interpretation of the message you have did you believe cause I'm a prophet did you believe that being gay and this and that arises is wrong they say well well is that is not how it where he was you really tried to see it right is right wrong is wrong a cabbie 99% courage and well we're just said now because it's 2019 so what worked in 65 ATP you know it's different the difference it's not a different time as a sim devil see him develop for Elijah that fourth Moses and for Joshua that was here at Malachi and was here when John James and Jeff 70 were all here is he seemed ever but the Bible tells we're not ignorant of Satan's devices there's nothing new he bring to us because the god we are fighting with who is fighting with us and the Angels have also been around longer than he wants oh god help us and took the keys that's why the devil is afraid of us because Isaiah I'm Joshua and Elijah they gave the devil trouble but when Jesus came and took the keys of death and hell on the grave a lot the devil now has nothing that's why the Prophet is said that there is a bluff he let's try to tell you you have problems you have no problems you only have blessings you only have blessings the pain in your bodies remaining your lives because if you tell you have him and he promised to take your pain away somebody please back to me [Applause] hallelujah glory to God brother I can wait one deep to put my foot on the devil the Bible says one day we'll ask the question is this the one who caused all this trouble because Brian to this bride will be fulfilled all that was promised Elijah is waitin on us moses waitin on us but a problem with animals but a jerem waited enough to bring on the resurrection we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed thank God for the Holy Ghost who is leading us into all truth so we can know how to prepare hallelujah give the Lord a sort of praise even if you don't understand give him a shout of praise your worship to him is not based on understanding is based on who he is He is God he is king of kings he is Lord of lords he is the great I am he is the great Shepherd he is our king he's our leader he's our master [Applause] [Music] lesson [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah or this is life to us French this is life to us friends this is what we live for real Christians real sons of God real daughters of God you may be seated that's what a little this down so you know what to expect because listen ignorance is trouble in them when they don't know it's do Devils have you locked up in half of businesses be sin ignorant people go in right internet belong in one particle to buy something come and said that two blocks away and you don't know if you let's walking or eating they right we buy from did he do it on a cyber is that is trouble but he still nice a credo we're gonna Nancy anything cheaper but because you don't know but that's why Paul said to Timothy study the shares have approved the problem in this message is people don't study that's the problem that's a real problem people don't pray people don't read their Bibles people do not study the message of Malachi form people watch movies people watch the news people read their papers I suffered somebody recently and they told me so much about American politics and they live in sure I couldn't believe it I didn't understand channel politics he had a perfect understanding opportunity that under you as an Emer to explain Russia how you find the time oh you funny time but he acts them weird it a prophet say this how do you piece this listen the Prophet never taught us to blindly follow any man never never ever ever doesn't exist but app random taught us he said Paul was the gold standard in other words that even measuring-rod if you want to know how a minister's was he measured go to Paul's ministry and Paul taught it like this he said follow me conditionally as I follow Christ so it means you're following a Paul had to be based on your revelation of who Christ is a piece on his word because I see only ways you can show in a poll could you explain that to me because of quality Scriptures and the condom what Christ taught that little off so poor Tony Church stay on your toes always it's laziness of the people at the convergence and listen to everything well and they take everything laziness listen there's no more important people study for hours to pass rule exam I was I give you example to tell you how bad it is in standard 5 this is not University this is not forum 6 this is not Secondary School in primary school in standard 5 in my biology class I was so focused on learning a certain piece of biology by receiver I mean audio tape of the notes from the teacher and I played it over and over till God helped me to this dear target of my head not all plants and animals are eaten some die and fall back to the ground these dead organic substances are reduced simpler substances the process by which this is done is called the key the key is caused by small plants or bacteria called funky like other living organisms bacteria so you need food to live they cannot get your own food as the green plants too so they get your food by [Music] [Applause] form five eleven years old cannot get it out of my head know what happens with young people able to look at them and say resist the devil he was here do I walk to the valley shadow of death you think any devil català listen Jesus defeat the devil with the written word he had no Bible with him to pull I wonder what I will use the fight him he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth or not of God it just came out of him because it was locked up inside of him you may be seated the Bible told us out of the abundance of the heart emojis it is what you're feeding on that's what you live out see your feet on carnality and must live all tonality but if you're feeling unattended or spirit your muscle about the things of the Spirit [Applause] you may be seated the other day I was telling Oh Christmas I never plays PlayStation in my life tell my wife I wonder if I should get one because I'm trying to understand this thing people spending hours sleeping at night playing a game and then they say well they get in trouble to move up in the trouble guys if you put on the game and focus on your work trust me you will get promoted because it bears any harder with diligence mid-fight so whatever your focus your energy on that is what you will get blessed with it as it is with it natural it seemed really spiritual if your meditate it is there many tell you what day and night you will have good so listen anybody for 2019 tell me they're not successful you are actually telling us but upon together in this class this morning the measure of your success is directly mathematics it directly proportionate is my right breast even the measure of success is mathematically directly proportionate to the level of study you're doing any morning and evening so if you increase the morning and increase the evening with your meditation on the word so will your success increase live you want more success but a parent said he wished you a happy purpose accessible new year he's busy same edited more because of more humanity turnover the modesty becomes your world listen is not his message is your message get to know his message get to love this message can the church say man I want to try to find a place to wind up but this is going so good I kid you do anything in a groove and I groove here Luckman is group here but a Norris say give us six hours money who is readily Diego anyway I never went before you see we meet always night service here one time what's enough tomorrow I have nothing tomorrow this one is finished this one is finished you know children are already nobody go to work tomorrow we can steal from now until tomorrow night kanna-chan same [Music] port was preaching and the service went on until a - for long did they even close a bishop Rafi brief you in terrorism a quitter and went back would put when went back to preaching but you have to love this thing when you love God you love his people you love one another the back - you're supposed to be you're supposed to be happy when they come together like this because this is your family this is your family I'm not yes - also I in this physical good little buddy buddy of Christ that is your family you cannot see wars listen if Minister want to see what size demeanor but if people win that because he was she supposed to what he see sheep but there I have some birds and goats in the middle because boutique and fight Church fight anything but sheep all sheep scene and sheep when sheep see sheep is a fellowship whenever I said one day the rain will fall I many talk to them sheep together because there's no division over there there's no heater over there s none of that we need more love we need more of God we need to get man out of the way so at the Holy Spirit which is the leader of the church will take his place when man or do we listen God have Liberty to move I can't wait for isakova to disappear no whatever it says it he want to see to you over then because any Holy Spirit has t complete control guide you how to pray who to bring for Jesus was led he came there by the Pool of Bethesda he could have prayed for everybody but he was also led so a man who was there for 28 years critics in this message mercy Jesus edgy they said when I knew one man boy how he moved so that's the Liberty to not answer where angels are free to tread we criticize him I don't know why who preach who came to preach why you say that service is still going on and people have open anything to say and she says Kim came to a one month and say well don't be made who I mean man toward Jesus come to help in many water he didn't even know who was talking she took him on a mission to help that man because he's a God who goes after sheep always individuals so when we come to preach earnest church service is never to the group there's somebody in here this morning some sheep who was drifting away that the Holy Ghost arrested you and pulling you right back into the pasture where you could be protected by the great Shepherd and the church say Amen so I was gonna read a few course and then rewind on the musicians you could come we try to close out sums of gonna let by the Spirit of God not led by some other fanatics I'm reading from the prophet or some organization or something or another they're led by the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise the churn of God not our bishops and Cardinals and so forth but the Holy Ghost I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or Pentecostal preacher I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believe that God promised tip that did be a church here without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said it was so can the church say Amen so we look you know special money but a number of it little bit pull it up big bazooka no message Pope no you know member of it the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost from the mess of the Word made flesh if your heart and your mind is so and in filled with God's Spirit listen now to spiritual leadership or divine leadership in action until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guy becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts too many of us using our own thoughts you don't use your own mind that sounds hollow you know but I have an opinion I have a position I have and God's saying I want to shoot that mind out I don't want your opinion I don't want your idea you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion I'm reading from the prophet but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be what kind of people would it be this morning if this Branum tabernacle and see if this excellent tabernacle this one was so filled with the presence of God why when you didn't even use your mind didn't even use your own thoughts then even have no alternative of your own but just be led by the spirit hallelujah just a few more quotes it's a meal now from the Prophet from the word manifests a message in your trip report 1954 andthere at our sons of God I led by the Spirit of God then when the human element goes out somebody say Amen the Spirit of God fills that vacancy you see there has to be a vacancy there has to be a vacancy if you are sitting there then court cannot there's no vacancy but when the human element goes out and the Spirit of God fill that vacancy where you empty yourself then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material that's when the church in its power I believe it's on the road that's when the chillest will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw away from themselves you don't see themselves you don't know tots but to still of God no thought but to serve God and they're torts move on they refuse the things of the world like Moses Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter see that's not my name don't call me that that's not who I am that's not my identification don't call me of this world I don't belong to this world I belong to God don't call me son of Pharaoh's nothing don't call me I'm not I'm not from this place I'm not from this world this is not my home I come from another place I'm waiting for the new earth because when it's a new dirt and fire cleanses and puts down the red carpet for the youth of the earth then I will show who I really am that is when it belongs to me they refuse a thing of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart the love of Christ not your interpretation of love because our interpretation of love you will love who we close with - we love who our blood take we love who we who share our ideas so we love because we have the same political understanding or or the same

why I didn't [Music] listen to you prophet the Miss Ireland believe doesn't help somebody but about sin our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up and see how you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart I will not see if anybody has done that a lot of times we say I am this and that I will do that you don't mean it in your heart see I don't meet in my heart but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first listen Christ is all then your entire makeup is of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean and your thoughts will be pure anybody blessed by that this morning amen let me just skip down to the end I'm on page 18 of 62 clothes over this animal is a prayer from the Prophet in preaching this message brother branham and leadership in December of 65 II he really brought her the rich young ruler and he said that the rich young ruler would have come up to him and say good master and we know the story and he told him the young man asks what can I do to inherit eternal life and jesus replied obey the commandments and only a father and mother and the young man said but I've done all these things from my youth what what like I get and the Bible said Jesus loved him prophecy been the love of God was so powerful he reached out to him and he's in what is situational the love cut to the bone could true the marrow down to the soul and saw that he had great wealth and he was so attached to his wealth that is what was holding him back so Jesus not that he wanted him to be poor but he wanted to break the hole that went on him said go sell all that you have and give to the poor take up your cross and follow me and the Bible said a man walked away grieved and when the banham said no doubt this young rich ruler would have had good tutors good guidance good leadership for him to be so successful but the madam said me I've just come out of high school maybe he would have been about 18 years old when abandon brought all of this out and he put his whole time to bring him to the end about how this rich and ruler actually ended and then says it's really about leadership you could begin a place for me softly this rich man from the message leadership when he come down or young ruler we talked about all religious and belong to church and everything fine educated a fine businessman and everything when he comes to the end of the road he began to scream there's nowhere to sleep where's his leadership he has been led by his church which is dead he had been led by the dead world and there was nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it hell but here comes Moses a faithful servant who esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt he come to the end of the road and all manner 120 years will walked up on the mountain and he know what dead laid before him he looked over into the promised land and he looked Lena by his side there was his leader the rock he stepped up on the rock and he answered of God packed him away into the glory the glory of God into the bosoms of God why eight hundred years later he was still being led by his leader we finally move on Mount Transfiguration standing there with Elijah talking to Jesus he went to the cross eight hundred years after that the one that he esteemed the report of his ministry the great treasures and all the popularity of the world and all the money of the world his leader was still leading him oh my he was led his leader he led to the death the shadows of death he was led to the grave hundreds of years later there he stood again because as his youth he had chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit his name will be great when there is no more Egypt or treasures when the pyramids are dust and when Egypt is no more Moses will be immortal among men because he accepted the leadership of Christ instead of going the way his church went there's others that did the same thing look at Allah he walked with God for five hundred years and then he had a test so many that he pleased God God had verified it this is the Prophet and said there's no need of you dying just come on up home this afternoon he went up and Elisha after boiling out baba here a woman and everything as he did in his day Jezebel's with the paint on them he got so full of it and I don't all he could and all them priests making fun of him and everything else he walked down the river one day and Jess across the river was the horses hitched up butch over there a chariot of fire and horses of fire he stepped right on and through his robe off to the next prophet to follow him and went up into heaven he accepted the leadership of eternal life because it was Christ that was in Elijah oh yes sir what was it follow me we said at the beginning if there's a leader you have to follow follow me now you must choose your leader you've got to choose it friends look in God's looking-glass the Bible and see where you are at tonight what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose today you choose life or death your choice will determine your eternal destination what you choose remember jesus said follow me and you invited a do so to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms I'm closing that's right the wood not upon the creed not upon the public opinion not upon what anybody else thinks about it but on what God said about it you say well brother Branham I know a woman just as good as she can be she does this and one man that went through this I can't help what they've done God's will he said that every man's would be a lie and mind me the truth you have got to come on his terms come on his conditions the world you cannot come through creed you cannot come through your domination you cannot mix it like that there's only one thing you can do accept it on his term that you're willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts and follow him get rid of all the things of the world and follow me may this be your closing message in 2018 I know that's a stone cutting message brother but I didn't come here to choose a message to the people just to try to make them sing shout holler and I mentioned this earlier I've been in heathen meetings where they've done the same thing I'm interested in your life I'm a servant of God that's got to answer to God Sunday and the ministry that the Lord has given me has vindicated itself thousands of time before you this is the prophets weekend remember Jesus said follow me follow me get rid of what you got and follow me that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he gave this man was the only remedy he gave this businessman it's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision is perfect every time and we must follow him is the only way to have eternal life so the leadership of God is to follow the vindicated word every hour by the Holy Ghost let us stand to our feet and I want to read this prayer this how bad a Branham closed-off this message leadership on December the 7th 1965 the second and last message that he preached can we bow our heads for a word of Prayer dear God as we stand here tonight a dying people our faces are turned towards the eat and dust we just you have given us this cutting sermon Lord we see the example of two men one of them being a religious man went to church but rejected the leadership to eternal life and the other rejected the worldly fame and turned to eternal life and we see both of their conditions tonight according to the Bible the rich man is in torment and Moses is in glory father we want to be like Moses we want to be led by your holy Son Jesus Christ to eternal life give it our hearts tonight Lord tear out all stony hearts please into us the new heart the heart of flesh the heart that you can talk to and deal with them it will not be haughty or
