perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ may god bless his word you may be seated or praise the lord well this morning i have a title the perfecting of the saints that's the title this morning the perfecting of the saints i'll have an inspiration the ministry of perfection yeah i know a lot of things happening outside but europe uh britain england los angeles the scientists say the fault is moving and shifting it's just a matter of time a lot of things is happening outside but i'm not going to talk about that this morning we want to deal with what's on the inside because the saints have to come to perfection we have got to return to the ministry of jesus christ and always god have to use somebody's bodies flesh buddies to raise the dead that that's how we're gonna work somebody gonna be a channel of god for his spirit to flow through and that body gonna be his wife his bride his people nothing going to stop it because the mouth of the lord had spoken it we spoke sometime back about prophecy and process that for jesus born in bethlehem they had a call for taxation to get joseph out from where he is leave joseph in his comfort zone he stay right there and marry up the baby right there but that will break the scriptures so in order that the scriptures be not broken god had to force the issue to get this re the train moving to get things turning and to get you to connect with your scriptures god have to get the train around your life moving so god will create situations and issues in order to bring you into the fulfillment of your word of prophecy hallelujah it's not coming to you you are going to wait [Applause] hallelujah in other words you have to come into your position you wasn't born into it you have to come into it hallelujah praise god you are predestinated to it so therefore you had to walk out of what you're in to go into what god wants you to be in isn't that right redemption is always in two paths coming out of and going into or unless people come out in this message but have what have they gone into praise god another denomination another cult another group of people just gathering together but there's a promised land called the ephesians land there's a land of ephesians joshua didn't cross over just to cross over he crossed over to give them an inheritance come on now moses ministry could only take them out come on now i'm saying it again moses anointed moses ministry could only bring the people out it take what just will anoint him it take the holy ghost anointing it take the ministry of the spirit to take the people in for 40 years we had moses you're not hearing what i'm saying come out the baptist come on the necklace come on come on come on come out but there's gotta come out we'll be no longer coming out but we are going in to our land of promise to your inheritance to your land hallelujah let me see that praise god oh my god when somebody got sold out in the old testament that await either two things somebody to bail them out pay for them all some rich man willing and rich to be build them out and pull them out or wait for the jubilee because they have jubilee provided the grace of god for you to be delivered whether you had the money or not so if you're in slavery and some rich uncle could pull you out they could pay for you and you get out but in case you have no rich uncle ruiz family or nobody to redeem you you have to wait till the jubilee come and when the jubilee come somebody gonna start to blow some trumpets you'll hear some trump inside of blow a trumpet gonna start to give a certain song that you don't have to sin no more you don't have to backslide no more you gotta be up and down no more you'll have to surrender to the devil no more come on now no man could bang you anymore no preacher no pastor no minister you're married to no man behind the pulpit you're married to jesus christ or give the lord a shout of prayer [Music] [Applause] i love freedom i love freedom i like my love freedom and you might be free to shout and jump and i'll be free to bust the word right in your face we've put on us free this morning oh give the lord some shouts of praises the one truth you want truth they don't want psychology you want the truth because the truth is we're going to set you free [Applause] all right let's get on now all right from the guide justin phil now remember this these are the things he's talking about the first the night the morning he preached a statue of a perfect man where he had all the virtues faith and knowledge and temperance and patience this is the night service he's preaching the guide and he's he's going back now and connecting to the morning service he said these are the things that build the servant of christ see faithfulness then virtue he doesn't say church is the thing that built he didn't say people is eating that bill he doesn't say deacon and elders and trustees isn't that bill this even the christ that might build a man ministry and reputation but these are the things which is faith and virtue you can't see those things those are invisible things you could see a building you could see officers stand on their post of duty that's thing you could see with your eyes but you see these things these are inside things these could only manifest through the flesh through the body it had the thunder they had to rip off the word didn't remain word in the beginning was the word it was invisible hallelujah and the word become flesh that is how the word becomes visible and dwell among us and that same invisible word that you're reading all these years you're hearing all these years that word has to become flesh could i get a shout in the house i am not your priest the catholic church have that all right but the priest is the man and he just do everything and you're good to go this is for all of us lady members anybody believers worshipers all of us that will have to register inside your system these virtues have become part of your being part of your very life you made a pledge last week to pray without ceasing until these virtues become part of your system we said how many pledges is by the grace of god how have your prayer week been hallelujah you have to make a personal investment in these virtues hallelujah this is better than uni trust this better than bank and putting the money in the bank this is investing in them virtues because when satan sees as register but it doesn't recognize it you might recognize your tie and you're closing but when you see these virtues it has to recognize it because it thunders oh it's shake the devil man you could go freak you are more powerful than you think oh man you sit there watching me with all that potential inside of you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god them demons say paul i know peter i know that's the same man who denied christ that's the same man who was cursing but them demons recognize not peter it's what was inside of peter was flowing over peter oh glory to god and that damn they were gonna recognize what's flowing outside of you the devil don't believe who you are the devil don't know who you are but what you shall know as you are known you shall know as you are known god know you a certain way but you're gonna come into that perfect knowledge you're gonna come from partial realization into perfect realization you're gonna come into a complete realization of where you come from where you're going and who the devil is and sin don't have to grip you no longer we want to break that off for you this morning oh yes oh yes oh yes and when that broken up you'll be shouting you'll be screaming you'll be jumping you'll be hallelujah [Applause] [Music] every service you're supposed to be getting more and more free every service you are nearer than when you first believe [Applause] now watch when god gave abram the promise you're gonna have isaac god didn't tell about 25 years something you haven't exactly known what for ibrahim to go and do everything else and then 2040 abram appearing in remembrance after 24 years the lord already know no god didn't do that just give him a promise hold that i can't lie i am god i give you that promise you can't bring it to pass by yourself so don't play self-righteous and i'm puffed up just speak about it just testify about it just prophesy it get the ministry of the word to prophesy that you're going to have this virtue and knowledge and temperance and you will have this son you don't hear what i'm saying just prophesy to the world you're gonna have faith and virtue and knowledge and camp you're gonna have isaac you're gonna have your son your body all your barren hallelujah struggling for years but god said so and god can't lie you can't explain how we're gonna come to pass all you know you're gonna come to pass oh glory the devil is a lie i don't care what you have done he chose you he said you have not chosen me i have chosen you oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] you see when i say give the lord a shout i mean that you know because you see when you're shocked you're backing up your goats [Applause] you see when you just watch the words i call them watching the world you hear any picture pain you're watching that you're watching it you're watching it like a horse you're bringing your water you're watching the water drink horse drink horse dogs i want to drink jose nice water boy nice water nice water it is nice water but you can't taste it even that particularly when he's at the party he said this eating good this really nice i eat in the cake and you watching you you don't know what it isn't i can tell you it's nice but you're dribbling you your mouth watering until i give you peace they say oh you have more but that's how you're supposed to be in service god you have more of this thing this thing eaten real nice this is the best thing god's in a prophet god take away the prophet god has so much confidence in us he could drop 40 plus years in this message and we're not moving we stand against principalities powers ministers unbelievers sexual preachers bastard ministers backslidden believers all kind of spirits for all these years and guess what we said standing on fire not not bored and half dead no we're still on fire as when we first started out just as strong just as strong just as strong give me my mountain [Applause] oh hallelujah oh glory to god since 1975 i have been looking for this hour and i am nearer than when i first believe we're going to appreciate gospel with power with signs with wonders with miracles right before your eyes we gonna have a seventh on the revival on this island in this church oh hallelujah or you talk about the shaking coming it has already started god i said nobody can ruin me out of this message they're crazy run me out of this inspiration this revelation they have to be nuts what is that man call you it's that man call me it's that man give me revelation if man get reversion they could take it back is it going to give me a party card getting back the party card but when pill of fire flesh and blood hath not had not revealed this unto you but my father had revealed and the gates of hell feel like dancing this morning and the gates of hell man what a place to be in nothing customer nothing can't draw you off you don't even want to have an excuse you just want to deliver the goods lord reporting for duty oh get the lord some praises man on fire for god [Applause] understand this many wise men would like to be here daniel will get in revelation pour upon him and then i say i understood not when ghost had to drop it on daniel so he said i understood not quesadilla go that way the book is sealed till the time of the end because with the unsealing of the book come the unsealing or the unveiling of sons for hundreds of years they are church members it's the first time god went and pulled the veil off of some mysteries called sons you see how them big technical companies that hide all the secrets and license and cover it up and only reveal it to put it on the market well god has hiding some stuff he's about to put it on the market are you hearing what i'm saying all along sometime they have something called r d it is called research and development they spend billions of dollars doing research and development of different products and have the hackers want to hack into the computers to find out what the research is about but the devil couldn't hack this one because when the seven seal broke when the seven seal broke there was sirens so the old hacker couldn't hack this oh but i'm telling you the silence about to be broken and what god hid under those seals he going to rip the veil off of it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god so no no because people could hack and see what you're writing in the emails they have something called encrypted communication hallelujah all tied up they can't unveil it they can't go that's how god communicating with his sons is encrypted communication so the devil can intercept what god is telling you the devil can't do anything about your healing the devil can't do anything about your deliverance the devil can't do anything about your breakthrough or give the lord a shout my god i feel the windows of heaven is about to break upon your life [Applause] [Music] it's always it's always a question when it's not manifested did he say so did he say so he said will he do it will he do it when is it manifested is a shock to the devil's mouth it's a shock the model of the critics you're sick the doctors say you got dead you're sick you're sick and sick but when you heal what did doctor go say the doctor had to keep quiet god wants to unveil this bride he want to bring out a church that he could be proud of a perfect church where sin can't even stay a church that love him that don't fear hell you you hear what i'm saying i chose to have a love for god a love for his people a love for his word i love his objective and motive i love to see his desire fulfill i must be about my father's business i always do that which pleases a bunch of ministers no pleases my father ministers angry let them huggy be angry i don't want my father to be angry all glory oh glory glory come on you gentiles god called you to be individuals god called you the stannis men stannis woman not stand as a killer group church group will fail it has failed but an individual standing upon that rock [Applause] [Music] faithful virtue remember the holy spirit cannot cap the building of god until these things are operating by the spirit amen now these are careful words and spirit given words he could have said operated by revelation but he didn't say that he said the virtues have to be operated by the spirit in other words it had to operate at the subconscious level where it is automatic at the conscious level you have to be nice you have to smile you just had a call with your husband but somebody knocked on the door and you can't open it like that you have to change from that oh mean look into the smile look because somebody's at the door that is you working the thing but when it's operating by the spirit you talk a husband right you talk to your wife right you talk to whoever at the door right because you are just right it's the spirit that's operated within your soul [Applause] what is it you are dying and christ is coming to life i see it again you are dying and christ is coming to life then you begin to see things in your life that you know you can't do then it is him it can't be you oh hallelujah come on now come on now help me somebody so these virtues have to be operated by the spirit how it could be operated by the spirit of this world and come so the spirit is promised amen i know it's not preached like that amen as a promise but it is a promise jesus he had moses ministry to bring them i like those words as far as the bethany that's how the word bible describe it he brought them up as far as the bethany and he was taken up and they waving bye-bye that's as fast he could take them no no no joshua which is represented by holy spirit because jesus prophesied if i don't go the comforter will not come so just like to hold on to me word [Music] [Applause] i caught you [Applause] they like the word made flesh they like him breaking bread and making more fish and healing the sick and whatnot he said but listen i gotta go oh no don't go you say i gotta go if i don't go comfort i will not come amen my ministries are bringing up to this spot but the holy ghost in the upper room he gonna take you further he's gonna break upon your life all you've got to do now is to create the atmosphere for him to come down because holy ghost can come and dry holy cows gotta come and dumb mulch and people poor eagles can't come and that holy cow come on sin holy ghost god come on you're not worshiping and praising god so you have to connect with revelation chapter five when the lamb took the book you believe a prophet you believe all the sea is open and you can't worship god something is wrong you have to see your name if you see your name you let me drop this on you the devil deceives all [Music] on the earth those who have their names written if you know and know your name is written which trial which testing what to come what what condition what can separate you from [Applause] britain uk walk out of the euro zone three trillion dollars was lost on friday off the market three there's a plenty zeros after the one there's a whole lot of zeros just like that something i direct the financial market of the world to bring on a new system i call it the beast system that one could dominate with trade and commerce because the bible said they wouldn't be able to buy or sell unless they take the mark of the peace and all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast who you're worshiping this morning it's not rich people worshiping the beast and the hip-hop us worshipping the beast no poor rich bun free church people non-church people drunkards whatever all except then when we preach the word somehow your father the lord the spirit has to reveal to you where your name is on that book i can't do it i am not the revealer i am not a revelator god is he alone have the sovereignty to reveal this thing to whomsoever he will that's why every service you ought to be excited you ought to be on the expectation you ought to lose yourself free yourself enjoy yourself in his presence oh do i hear a shout in the house oh hallelujah hallelujah doom devils are on the run you are going to go free oh chloe [Applause] [Music] once you see your name and you understand by revelation that your name is on that book and that book is the book of redemption and to redemption have redemptive rights then you have to want to know what is your right if you are a citizen of this country you supposed to have rights in this country you're not a foreigner you're not a stranger you can't walk like you're not sure that you belong every place you put your foot becomes yours oh god help me jesus help me god you may be seated understand this the people was in israel in egypt on the pharaoh ghost i'm going to bring it to our land that's not yours they come on the bondage and go say that land is yours from this border to that border to that border but there's your fine print you have to place your foot on it [Applause] the car used binoculars and said that line is mine's you know all done they're all done then you're looking through some spy glasses no no no go to sit by your spyglasses you go see it you go read it you want to put your foot on it you want to put your hand on the neck of the lion you want to put your hand on top the ears of the beer oh you're not here what i'm saying man people said they got frightened already [Music] [Applause] no matter what's in store i will praise the lord when that lion come in from your house i want to hear your praise in the lord i'm not making it easy for you i'm not bringing some kentucky fried chicken for you i'm telling you this is real judgment is already sick [Applause] any day los angeles could go down america will be under war because the iniquity has rose up to god and the cup of iniquity is about full when god said i had enough oh hallelujah thank you jesus didn't plan to read this but i'm going to read it for you oh glory revelation chapter eight and when you opened the seventh seal there were signs in heaven about this piece of effingham and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer there was given to him much incense that he should offer it with prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it onto the earth and there were voices and tundras and lightnings and an earthquake did you hear that but the prayers of the saints angel take the incense cast it upon the earth and they were tendons voices lightning and an earthquake all that tied together hallelujah we approached men we are approaching the judgment tower gods and elijah before that terrible day of the lord [Applause] oh hallelujah could somebody say amen don't forget that now this is here first first your faith virtual knowledge and so forth is to be added to it until the complete statue of christ is made manifest then the holy spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body and by your fruit you are known when all this takes place watch the place of worldliness and ungodliness all unbelief is cast out all the things the world is passed away there's nothing but a new creature in christ then grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption the ceiling is the holy spirit the cap is what seals us into the body the cap seals us into the body after all these virtues are added from ordination he said until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you the holy spirit seals you in as an individual so that's why taking refuge in churches is no talking and that's what they have deceived the people with that if the church is the holy ghost or the church gives them the right to to the rapture it doesn't give you that the church is like a covering out of the church there's going to be a bride who's going to be wife of the lamb or his wife that will make herself ready while all the others just watching the clothes and washing the dress his wife gonna put on the dress clean and white rashes of the saints hallelujah let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife not the church members the church members hoping to be right to me it must be but his wife got to make herself ready you got to see something to put on you've got to see something to act on it [Applause] you see those people they only want to hear nice things they want to hear excited oh i never see it so never see it you feel revelation but bright people they want things to apply how could i apply how can i change things in my home in my life in my relationship in my work in my talk and my actions my attitude i want the things applied i don't want to hear here here i want to know what to apply you have a soul you have a disease you have a disease it's a big disease is that extended disease i hear that i want a cure you're a sinner you're a sinner yes i know that i bored and said shape integrity i want deliverance i want that breakthrough i want redemption i want healing i want restoration you're back sitting yeah i said yes i'm back sitting [Music] the question is if you're going to stay back sitting the question if you're going to stay sick if you're going to say bong are you going to shake yourself like samson shake yourself shake yourself stop that and shake himself you know is he is he in prison is he as he's blind what an effort what an effort to push forward one opportunity hallelujah one opportunity he had this is his last chance this is the last stage this is our final chance one small lord [Applause] it is scary because it is dangerous to be lazy it is dangerous to be lukewarm it is dangerous to be dead former it is dangerous god said rather you're hot or you're cold if you're cold i know you're dead if you're hot you're on fire but when you're lukewarm you're miserable [Applause] [Music] [Applause] somehow all the anchoring samsung held he fell he backslid he lost his eyes he lost his joy he lost a lot of stuff but he didn't lose his god [Applause] and sometimes people feel because your failure fail your backslide that all is lost that's not true that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie that's a big liar huge lie that is lying massive david never lost his salvation david said lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation [Applause] oh [Music] don't look at me worship god [Music] i didn't come to say all them things his angels dropping down his voices inspiration anointing god has needs here that god is ministering to and the spirit is picking it up glory hallelujah you gonna step out after this service you can't stay where you are you got to step out [Applause] when when esther recognized the crisis at hand her people was about to be destroyed esther come to the spot that she tell herself if i perish i perish she know the rules you can't just go into the presence of the king she know the laws but it's one time lord no law i'm desperate nestor said if i or perish if my prayer don't stop me i'll go in i better go in church and die than to die and sin and unbelievable i'm going to go i'm going to get a breakthrough my god gave us people so hungry for god they want a revival i don't care who god have to change god had to change the past that you go change him gotta turn the pastor upside down and shake him out he gonna shake him out nothing must stop the perfecting of the saints but there is going to be the perfecting of the saints [Applause] you are going to come to perfection [Applause] man i hope i get you this today oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] [Music] a fifo minister will be a manifestation of a positionally placed son of god forget all who say the fivefold the endearfall that is not the full god talking about when god said for god set [Music] in the church not man appointed not somebody voted in this is when god and when god set a man but abraham was born a prophet he was always a prophet but god told him do the work of an evangelist until he gets set [Applause] are you following what i'm preaching so even though he was born a prophet he had to do the work of evangelists and talk until god set him up [Music] and god set him by the opening of six seals sex because the word come to the prophet because christ is the seventh seal [Applause] so the prophet will win six and christ stood there in that prophet as the seventh seal and out of the seven tunnels who rode out to gather the bride together to give the bright faith that's what about how to be prayer out of the mother of christ the mighty angel oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] so the six seals indicated him as that elijah malachi 4. now he was ready to reveal the son of man who is christ the soul of the good seed veiled in a son of man these son of man speaking bridal promises speaking prophecy oh hallelujah are you with me fightful minister will be a manifestation of positionally placed son of god amen in other words jesus walking on two feet not intellectuals not church politicians and manipulators or message popes or spiritual dictatorship all of that yes so don't think i just playing with words there we are not talking about a sign of the fivefold or a sign of the turtle or a sign of adoption a sign points you to the destination i am speaking about an adopted son veiling the pillar of fire with sigium [Applause] not with doctrine not with teachings because peter was in the body he was an adopted son and peter had jim [Applause] in him so when he went to conure's house while peter speak the holy ghost the spirit and the word was one when he speak the word he speak in spirit and other sons got quickened made alive hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah peter was god's channel of communication for god's inspiration to flow through and you're going to have a repeat of that peter the throne of god that was once in heaven that was in jesus christ was known in the heart of peter that's what we're talking about a man filled the purifier hallelujah what will it be it will be the ministry of jesus christ it will be a ministry of perfection to bring the saints to perfection all glory to god hallelujah [Music] still want to finish the statement god picks and ordains the faithful ministry for the body of christ the entire bride body so the fightful ministry not just a local ministry the fivefold ministry will be an international ministry that affects and influences and speaks to and communicates to the entire bright body [Applause] amen so what brother i'm taught is that a man must be adopted gifted and sent out as a fifo minister so we have to do the work of what we're working at until we are placed positionally and sent hallelujah with that authority the whole heaven behind those men because they are ambassadors of the throne did you hear what i'm saying they become ambassadors of the throne ambassadors are special passport their special rights and liberty and freedom they pass in special quarters and special places because the ambassador of this country in that country but then you become an ambassador of the very throne of god when you speak god speaks when you say heaven lock up heaven lock up when you say heaven unlock heaven unluck it will be the word of god coming forth from the mouth of god brother brother said once more the world will hear direct from god and that is not about playing books and tapes he's not talking about that he's talking about man that fail in the purifier having the voice of god you're going to know is the voice of god because the voice of god brings back that real supernatural power not no high-level word talk high-level revelation talk that is still [Applause] [Applause] [Music] we believe there's a church coming into that perfection the ministry of perfection where the officers the opposers and prophets and pastors and teachers evangelists for the perfection of the church them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word till they will work right up to the coming of the lord not with their dreams not for their own private revelation but with the word that's why you have to know what the prophet prophesy because if you don't know it what people interpret to you you will interpret it as that is the word god not trying to vindicate me you know god trying to vindicate his word [Applause] if i die if i am no longer in his pulpit this word will still be vindicated [Applause] do you understand that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why god gives give samuel ruffin up hallelujah mourning for saul he's away why are you wasting time on soul see i'll find a better man what a more time to it's 40 years they had soul god said time up they choose that spiritual man no i'm going to get my man go and anoint him who one of the son of jesse i like how god has do things he said god tells that samuel david david but like the process our god is an awesome god do you see that samuel can i go down and say i'm looking for david anybody know who david all right david don't mind the thing and he's anointed with a private ceremony and do that god not a person like that amen number one is a tough job to anoint a man as king when the next king is alive you're looking to get your head off so the question was how do i do it he's able to just say you're going to have fellowship you're going to confuse you know you got to move with wisdom you're going to kill him [Music] the whole thing and let samuel go to the process to let samuel know assuredly i don't see as man says i see a little different so i said let them pass through under the desert may they recognize there's no spirit witness let them keep passing keep moving brothers don't stop now don't handle the line keep going whenever they pass you start time and say is this all god god will waste time if god sent me here for a better man it has to have a better manner so you you think you waste time coming seriously this morning you came for purpose you came for enlightenment you came for perfection you came to raise up above where you are you have to see something bigger than you better than you greater than you more awesome than you mightier than you that could pull you from where you are to where you ought to become [Applause] the clarinets are a nice little thing for me you don't have no bones but it could break hearts [Music] be careful what you see [Applause] be careful with your words they say mark the perfect man he can bridle his tongue glory enjoying the lord amen so therefore the dynamics has to come to a fifo ministry amen isn't that right there is going to be the ministry of christ so that the dynamics is what will positionally please the fightful ministry but a brahmana in your trip report listen to this i don't really hear ministers talking much about this but others say but lebron said and my brethren here this morning speaking and i pray that each of these ministers in here these ministering spirits that god hear my prayer and i pray that you will purge that gift that's in them are men arrogant this is that and they're showing the muscles and bones they push them if they're preachers make them better preachers if the evangelists make them better evangelists if their teachers make them better teachers if their pastors make them better pastors god grant that they will be filled with the spirit of god and will be energized by that great supervine that will give them life eternal and power to minister with and to touch the needy world as it is so needy today so he is talking about effective ministry he's taken about empowered ministry he's talking about ministry that could only grow as you are purged and cleansed and taken through god's grinder otherwise known as place of trying amen this is what i'm seeing right now the first sign of the ministry of christ is power virtue flowing amen and that scripture i have is mark 5 30 and it says here and jesus that woman touch him vote you left him and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turn him about in the presence that who touched my clothes the amplified said and jesus recognizing in himself that power proceeding from him had gone forth turned around immediately in the crowd and said who touched my clothes so we're talking about not revelation but we're talking about resident power permanent power not temporary power ah the power that they receive in the upper room was not temporary what jesus gave them in matthew 10 was temporary because judas was there the old bunch of them had power because jesus put that on them amen they was even really saved in that sense there was him sanctified they were just disciples they in contact with jesus and they like jesus they have jesus reputation with them everybody know they were jesus and they have the authority of jesus yes but that wasn't resident in them so you have to give them promises and say you know what you feel you have to become inside of you because everybody are wrong at getting part of it and one time they said lord we want to stop somebody who didn't in your name and they were jealous they're going to fight with people who doing things not not with them they have problems among one another who's the greatest who jesus loved more their own issues they were men until god shake them down and bring them into one mind one heart one accord and then you could step into them then nobody are jealous you had your portion it's one thing to have your portion man oh glory to god when you have your portion you have nobody else to fight up with nobody can steal your joy it's your own your own joy you have it so when peter had this resident thing in him that is why people could say silvan gold i none such as i have i give and you have to have it to give it let's go forward but branham how god set some in the church true labor pains not true conventions not your specials and singing and preaching and revelations no true shout out labor pains shout out again one more time shout it out that means you're making baby oh give the lord a shout you're laboring to bring food [Applause] oh they get remembered sometimes you can let it even float on that one all the time you have pain but you get tremendous now people don't want no pain you know no pain in a marriage no pain in the relationship if you give them a chance they get no test lord no tests so why should anybody you know you want to go on a job no interview just let's go in just go in a madman will be doing that that's right if anybody's just sending people in that job just just go keep on going this take take whatever post you want whatever trouble whatever player wants you can take that too god carry on no not even natural man running business like that that's why i have tests examination it have all the interviews it have all these things to filter the process they're going to have all types out there good bad ugly ragamuffin thieves bandits that's why god put the angels of god between the garden of eden he said least adam in his condition eat at that and go continuing like that but eternal life god said got it so they had to block adam from that tree don't let him touch that tree god has set some in the church through the labor pains they get tremendous some time then he says when a church here we go now is groaning under the persecution of the outside world that is not bandits and robbers and drunkards that's church people okay that believing on the lord jesus that here we go the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was the pentecost he didn't say you are the holy ghost he didn't say that he said when the church is believing that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real as it was the pentecost watch watch how they groan and cry on the labor pains when they are born one and positionally born to in the kingdom then god sets in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors he don't set them in conventions he don't set them because this one like them and this one don't like this one he doesn't set them that way true labor pains how they grown how they travel yes yes yes ministers have to grow and travel too [Applause] if they don't go in and travel it's on their way to tribulation because we have to put into the ministry of jesus christ it has to come forward man have to die [Music] [Applause] then the holy ghost sets them in the church apostles prophets teachers some pastors some evangelists then he gives in to their speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of healing all kind of miracles oh praise god the pillar of fire is identified scientifically and by the reaction of a spice character and everything else just the same then he says as it was when it was dwelling in the body of god's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted sons for the last day [Music] the same pill of fire that was in jesus that pill of fire going to be an adopted sons in the last day oh hallelujah tree is perfection it's also in prison now the ministry comes to perfection this is the ministry now this is the ministry now another lady ministry are you ready the ministry comes to its perfection when it reproduced christ again in natural among human beings i like that not christ in spiritual talking mysteries no natural amen you see if it going by higher revelation and who are more revelation and more revelated then then the intellectual professors and doctorates and degrees people in this message who preach this message they adopted already they don't they don't need any dynamics their head take them higher but if it has to be a repetition of christ you have to see christ's own life oozing out the man you wouldn't have to say nothing about it the devil make you prove yes every one of these virtues is in you that is not you and god now that you're the devil the less they get less he said it will speak for itself you won't have to say anything about it will speak for itself it will be good walking on two feet listen right now right now sodom is walking on two feet and if sodom could walk on two feet with a rainbow flag white we can't have good walking on two feet with the rainbow not a flag [Applause] oh glory oh give the lord a shout in the house oh man if they're so bored to step out we gonna step out be like jesus [Applause] i'm absolute he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers and so forth he is the dynamic that works that aha so i mean this fightful ministry will be worked by dynamics oh hallelujah it will turn from the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit what's the objective for the perfection of the saints oh hallelujah it's worked by a certain dynamic he is the fire that fires off the gas he's the fire in the combustion chamber he is the power of the resurrection he is god he is the fire so the holy spirit is on the guide watch always speaks of the word i've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it here we go this is very important that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being here we go you are supposed to be all the way up there by that time watch see and that brings us into the full stature of the sons and daughters of god a church that washed in the blood of christ that's bought without money with all that price so what is he saying at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be way up in the virtues with the word word on top of word on top of word on top of word what's the secret the word is in the bride then they're going to come for the fightful ministry with the ministry of the spirit to take the bride further because you will be perfected the cap of perfection will be the spirit part because right now you are perfect under the blood you have been redeemed by the word but then you're got to get the spirit to cap that and that is what the dynamics is all about oh hallelujah do you believe that oh glory to god glory to god hallelujah so therefore at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be way up there and what is this christ have to come to finish that off christ is what coming true of eiffel ministry it will be the ministry of christ not this man ministry this brother ministry no it will be the ministry of jesus christ coming to bring on that perfection could we say amen praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah so the world is doing the work of redemption right now you've been redeemed by the word right now so christ the spirit coming to do the final part of that work the complete the redemption the finishing the seven sale the common incompleteness and joy oh hallelujah redemption and completeness and joy hallelujah you commented that completeness charity the bond of perfectness come to seal you then you become a sealed unit of the lord god perfect standing under the blood and a perfect step by the spirit devil cup butter with conscience imagination memory affection reasoning all of that under the control of the holy ghost that is an invincible army that's an invincible man that's an invisible woman she has the word she has the spirit he has the word he has the spirit who gonna stop that man you put that man in prison the prison bars open up do not hear what i'm saying oh hallelujah spirit lead [Applause] you say that song in fairfax no the whole creation is groaning for this manifestation that i just share with you of the sons of god they're not grown into our church members they have no blowing their people sitting on a church pew that can't doing anything we had hundreds of years of huge views but what going to shape the system the sons of god being unveiled from under the seventh seal all glory to god coming right out of the book of redemption there'll be one more ride there'll be one more ride tell me one more ride he said i'll ride this trail once more there'll be one more ride the white horse rider the holy ghost himself there gonna be one more ride but signs wonders and miracles may it start today oh hallelujah there's gonna be one more ride [Applause] [Music] man he's reading ephesians what we read some evangelism pastors for the perfection of god no does it read like that no for the perfection of what the saints who are the saints the sanctified ones you ain't a saint until you're sanctified [Applause] someone like 50 say amen we're gonna get to the other fifty percent you ain't a saint until you are sanctified so when we say the perfecting of the saints we're talking about the perfecting of the sanctified ones hold it right there don't don't get too nervous we come in fear coming to get you perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry then he says deep ministry of jesus christ so we know nobody's about to ministry is that the other minister's brothers ministry no we have that but we're talking about the ministry of jesus christ and there's only one of that that ministry coming in the form of a pastor form of evangelist former prophet just same ministry one ministry everybody around the world are going to call into this fight for ministry will have that same one ministry it's one ministry called the minister of jesus christ it will act like christ talk like christ live like christ do the works of christ it will be just like jesus christ how do you know about over look at byram he walked like christ he talked like crazy act like christ he raised the dead like christ he healed like christ he was just like christ they even thought he was christ you had to tell them i am not he and run for his life he was so much like christ they mistook him for christ you mean it will happen again yes yes i'm not talking about taking you for christ no you're going to be just like christ so when the devil see you say i see him before you know i see him before because christ doesn't sting him already so he don't want to get a second one like that because i feel that before boy that he's saying presence that was in the wilderness there's the presence that cast me out there's a presence when jesus random devils out the devil asked permission to go into the pigs they want to float around they want some more mischief to do somebody to get invited jump up that's all the endeavors have to find somebody for mischief they have to find somebody to use to do the impetus behavior and their stuff i'm waiting for the holy ghost looking for somebody to use somebody to use god looking for somebody i wanna hear a bigger amen than that open your mouth and say amen you're looking to use you the holy is looking to jump on you holy looking to speak through you hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so this ministry is not for you it's not for me this ministry of jesus christ is necessary to raise the dead because the lord does all three the shout the voice and the trump so it has to be christ's ministry come back is that man reasonably dead think about it it has to be christ true and by man raising the dead oh hallelujah are you with me oh glory to god hallelujah so god wanted to come into bodies and use them for his glory amen for his honor isn't that right amen so the church come to justification certification through wesley through the bathroom where he goes all the pentecostals go right into the perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the self-seen person god will be so manifested into his bride his church they'll be one of the same do you see where we are at then we read this i think before build me up lord into this that christ be my head working through me and my foundation my feet that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working me oh lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sink or drown denominational mission friend or no friend let that work in me this is for the ministry now let christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that i might be able to teach those whose virtue christ's virtue whose knowledge that we might be able to teach so it's not our teaching it has to be christ knowledge christ virtue no we don't have virtue in ourselves we could get faith which is at the bottom as revelation faith is revealed but virtue is power jesus said he came unto his own he don't receive him not but as many as receive him the damn gary power to become the sons of god so you are promised a power which is a virtue to come upon your faith that you could now begin to add that life power have to come we have none except he sent it except he promised it except he release it except he give it and you will promise it you shall receive power or give the lord a shout in the house let christ virtue his knowledge flew out that i'm able to teach those for god has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastor and evangelist all here we go this is a deeper part all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that perfection of the coming of the son of god so what is he saying here these virtues cannot come into you by revelation the minister can bring it into you by revelation he has to have the experience of the virtues you have to have the experience of the life itself it has to be a life speaking logos [Applause] it has to be a life speaking fire [Applause] why peter yet speak these words holy coast fell upon them what is happening seed germ from the body spirit life coming out out of the mouth of another sun because adam was supposed to speak for other sons and jesus he must be born again of the word and the spirit so we are coming back to that oh glory to god do you get it we are coming back to that when god give adam the promise to multiply replenish multiply and so on he was supposed to wait for a further revelation of how to do it of how then the devil came in then it comes down in the sex but he was supposed to wait for food and revelation so god gives something you have to wait until it unfolds devil can't bring it into petition and that we end up born in sin born of a woman born in hell so going to bring christ to bring a new boot to bring wood and spirit to bring it back to adam again so when god speak the word that's why jesus said upon receiving the holy ghost and come back to the mount again they come into the mouth of god the word of god so therefore you come now and you get the word inside your soul the devil do believe that it's a secret god put a seed inside of you your spirit might be messed up your flesh might be messed up but go put a seed inside of you and then the spirit come down the poured upon that and then it started to grow and break out there's how to influence your spirit it's hard to influence your flesh it has to influence your walk start to influence your talk and the more you die out is the more this light expands the more you god have the preeminences and the more you give up this and give up that the more you make room is the more that holy spirit expands inside of you then you become anointed with god you are in the presence of god you are living in his presence you are walking in his presence you have the joy of the lord which is your strength nobody can show you off knock your offer on your off practice pull you down you can you choose your accents you make your decisions you make the right ones regardless oh give the lord a shout out you're happy to be a christian and not a cushion a cushion they stick or kind of thing in it but you're a christian you stand for christ you stand for the word you stand for the spirit [Applause] you tango for your trials your tango for your testing you change your picture you change your attitude when the trials come you say lord how do i get out of this you might be seated watch watch watch patches i want to stay too long on this but when god called the devil walking two and four on the earth see where you're going see up on the upper now i'm looking for more mischief to do he said come check out this man i have here this man called joe joe they never said the reason i'm touching him because you have a head's around him yeah oh god people have a hedge courtyard caught you didn't know that right in case you didn't know no you know so whether you think you get yourself out of trouble you get to have already accident because it's god put the heads around you definitely get permission to touch you he can only watch you unless god [Applause] so sometimes somebody had a bullet ball to see if they could but then go say go into training because our ball coming again because no you're gonna make it god knew in advance his faith was in job his seed was in job the man born in sin shaped iniquity have his ups and downs have his failures you have a holy talky wife you have all kind of issues around him but that can't stop deceiving him so god tell it to have a listen take a crack take your best shot do your best [Applause] i went as devil finished with him demanding boilings the man look like you have heads nobody i want to go near him the man's scratching and kind of thing and the man stood on me i'm all go to the skin room destroy my body get in my flesh i shall see god for myself another and i was devil you are a liar you ain't gonna get me the curse god [Applause] like the song said i never lost my praise i lost friends and lord's family i lost minister's friend but i never lost my prayers don't let deaton take your prayers where was though when i lay the foundation of the earth and the mornings i sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy [Applause] oh [Applause] every son that committed god must be tested and dry not some sons like what fever that one boy god doesn't do favors like how humans has favored his son and their son and god nothing that he disciplined noah disciplined moses he disciplined his sons all of them and if these jokers in this message is going to discipline them they're wrong god is pure and he is just his righteousness demands judgment but his blood speaks for grace that's why you tell them he said he said nebuchadnezzar my servant will come and do this that for 70 40 70 years you've been babylon and after something's accomplished only enough long time while your mother died all your old heads die out and when they come to repentance and what that i'll punish the king of the bible and after 70 years so god always takes somebody to take into captivity and you're buying and what nothing like that you you can't get a breakthrough because your outer your outer line your outer position as soon as grow people start to get back position line up go and just line up with them authorities have to line up with them everything's that are lined up for you as soon as you come up in line when you're live you're one you see you have to have an intent this is a problem a lot of people don't have the intent you have to have an intent to do right an intent to serve god i intend to please him yes that appreciate you know you have to have an intent if you're just respectful you have to have intent to be respectful so then you're pressing your way and you'll find this you're getting less and less and if you're ready word go we had to cast that spirit out because i spirit upon your life because god wants respects demand respects you'll be judged for being disrespectful whether it's your husband to the pastor to deakin anybody like that god demands your respect he wants respects oh hallelujah isn't that right praise the name of the lord so therefore the virtues praise god cannot come in just by talk talk talk like one time somebody said take a breath in oh income fate virtue take seven deep breaths you get from faith virtue knowledge good lord i wish it was that easy hallelujah barbara says somebody asked him how could you go to this church in that church in that church he said kindness knowledge know what to believe know it's in somebody listen if something in somebody's heart are you guys in that doubt without jackhammer so you spell it always always rebuke and rebuke it it's in their heart if it's in the head other small talk would fight off in them but when is it a heart in trouble but my mom said one of the hardest people to convict your witness because they legislate done with the knowledge and the intellect but you know where they should come up supernatural that is just stop the knowledge [Applause] so anytime you want to deal with them you have to have something supernatural if his argument in scripture they're going down with your greek woman they're going down they're going down they're going you lost that back but you see when you see supernatural come battle over they get shut up that is what god has to begin to do shut them all to the critics by bringing out sons manifested sons are you with me praise god the church is weak the church today we have broke up with organizational strife separation of brotherhood methodist baptist presbyterian oneness trainers finest all kind of stuff watch that's the way it's supposed to be do you hear he brought that he said he broke a broker broke about he said but either way it's supposed to be break up breaker breaker break up but watch what we say next that's where it's supposed to be then then there will come a message [Music] hallelujah we know that that same pillar of fire that led israel we know that that same ministry that accompanied jesus christ by that pillar of fire had him anointed as a company to change today we need the ministry of jesus christ to fit the headstone commentator that brought the church into a place where the ministry exactly like what jesus had when he left not we wanted we need it so it has to come to that ministry of jesus christ number six have to run out oh praise god hallelujah we take a little more he said now talking about those those there wasn't spirit filled talking about those pharisees people and salvation people there's something inside with jesus but they were loyal and held to the modern creed of their leaders now he had moses teaching about messiah coming and all those prophecies about messiah coming but then was preaching the old pots and pans gospel and that loyal following everybody loved the pastor or the priest or the kaifas and it was hat and he had anything like that right he looking good he went good and so on like that caiphus is the man watch hear this part but his ministry i love this part who are showing up their doctrine they had their doctrine but jesus ministry began to expose their doctrine that's what the ministry of christ will do it's a manifestation of christ's own life now they had their creeds they were great churches great people great men holy men good men gentlemen fine men all men men of honor educated smart religious is that right and we all know that just as good as you can find anywhere but when jesus come on his ministry showed up their doctrine because god was proven by the ministry of jesus christ that he was with him and peter used these words he said jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you so what you want to see is man approved of god oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah no doubts no questions no wonderings it is vindicated by god himself jesus of nazareth a man approved of by god this is all right to know the mechanics but one of them has the dynamics he said oh you say other cadillac have tanks and crankshaft and steering wheel it's pretty but it it it casts that it's not working you have it right in the house look at my rims look look at these seats it's leather splash look at the dashboard you say let me go for a spin it can't start you so know do you have there better borrow a bicycle you understand what i'm saying so if a man explained the only word any mysteries and it's this hidden mystery deep that that yeah it looking nice but could it start could it bring on a revival could it bring on a super church a super race is a spirit flowing freely could it start could that engine tumble the last indian tumblers hallelujah men doing nothing moving hallelujah because the battery too weak it take it take is this a northern light could work on this bridge you gotta get it right back to you get this engine moving go and you turn the key you wanna hear a rumble you don't want to know the plugs coming into the wire to all i want to do is to drive oh give the lord some praises all you want to do is to try [Applause] all of them had the right mechanics but one of them has the dynamics you see you might know the mechanics but it takes dynamics to start off the mechanics to make it work and no matter how much geology with all dynamics you see in other words you've got to have a spark to the gasoline and no matter how well we are taught how well we believe how much of the bible that we say is true we believe it all it's got to be the dynamics to get there the spark to set the world of fire to start it rolling it's got to have that if you don't he said the church sit still the car sits still you sit still no matter how much you say i sympathize i believe every word of it you've got to have something to spark it off hallelujah it's got to take the dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics but lacking dynamics and i think that's the matter with the church today is lacking the dynamic power of god to press the word terrorist to make it live not to explain it more enough for you to run with more notes on a notepad that you cannot do it but to make it live oh hallelujah martin luther had mechanics in the enemies of his day john wesley had them pentecostal had them what about our day this is another time the church shall be fully grown now ready to meet christ with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the bible hallelujah operating in that one great body that he promised he would meet the people and be worshipped so the more we get closer to god is the more worship supposed to be in the church the more praises not less praise there's more praises more worship hallelujah the more we come to the coming lord is the more worship he said then we are worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among us that's the thunder's being unfolded oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah could i have shouted again in the house christ ministry which is ephesians 4 ministry will bring the bride to perfection oh hallelujah by that seven spirits of god to come upon the word the pyramid already seated in you in wood form you're already packing the prayer what do you think instead of you is the pyramid inside of you is the bible inside of you there's a seed inside of you it's a word inside of you you only wait for dynamics satan better be careful you don't know what you're messing with you don't know what the fooling went oh how when god pulled the veil of this bride he said she will be a super church she will be a super race as she nears the headstone northern life could work in her nobody can make her do otherwise it will be christ himself by and through the bride fulfilling his work because he didn't finish his work while he was on earth no bye and through the bride oh hallelujah praise god glory glory hallelujah oh hallelujah but abandoned what later in brother reginald lettering he said if the lattering had been here the power of god would have struck that thing and swept across the world he said the latter is fixing to come so who claimed that dynamics what dynamics what position he plays they have don't have mult only talk the lateral is fixing to come trump says the devil is coming on his dynamics through the united nations to enforce laws right now they take this whole thing about our gays and whatnot to the united nations and they want to enforce laws concerning transgender rights to the rest of the world the devil set up that a long time ago only to come to enforce laws so it would be legal it would be illegal not to marry people like that man a man or woman a woman so the christians find himself back against a wall in america and it would be across the world who said all of that and prophesied that but the brahmana prophesied that he said the people that follow the pillar fire will have a rough time but they'll be ready for the rapture so if you think we are playing games with any human we are not because there are bigger battles yet ahead oh hallelujah to minister to people all glory to god hallelujah oh my my my mind so therefore god have to release the ministry of the spirit to bring the people into that perfection oh blessed be the name of the lord buddha branham a woman engaged to a fine clean man and they come together and she is found pregnant by someone else then her own seed is which is betrothed her own body is betrothed her engaged husband is found full of seed of another man what it is grace that's what adam found that is what christ found they couldn't wait that's the matter with the people today here we go they can't wait for the real holy spirit to take the church in position they've got to manufacture something like speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all kind of tummy rut instead of waiting upon the lord for the real manifestation of resurrection of christ making himself known among the people they have to have no manufacture of that but ram stand up there and say you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on the angel of the lord and he will be talking talking all of a sudden he said he is here that is no makeup stuff it is real then because he is here he says i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god because he know he has backups he know now the operation change the devil in subjection no spirit move till he says so amen because the angels on the platform right now and he is doing this now he's doing this he's going here you so and so you spit so and so i noticed sometimes he said somebody would die but he said everybody would die but he stand up somebody with hype everybody stand up with the same condition everybody stand up and deal with it then one time he's dealing with some spirit and i say he's a spirit trying to get an expert to ask for help because they don't want to leave so the spirits and them looking for backup too then when you come here and say worship and praise the devil have no room to move you understand those devils want you bong they want you sick don't ever believe sicknesses of god and god that god gave me this because you did this and he was wrong and he deserved this don't don't let never fool you with that you know healing is the children's brethren [Applause] i don't care if you're sick for 40 years are they kept in a heritable heritage a disease they have nothing with god god does heal cancer tumor leukemia all kind of thing god is a healer he is a healer god is a healer like he saved you he's a savior he's a healer too in case he didn't know no you know people are so bastard now they don't even believe god for healing no evil for miracles god is a miracle worker too [Applause] my god he's a miracle working god how many you can say amen [Applause] how many to do with a miracle this morning oh we are believers here this morning i can do it one so we become tabernacles of the holy spirit which is christ that's the real seed now then if the real holy spirit gets into the real seed of the word it just won't take part of it because the devil uses that all right so the devil used part word the devil is in this message preaching part of the message but the bride will take all of the word not part of the word every mystery every word the bible will take what the prophet said not word what somebody interpret what the prophet said the bride the prophet will be speaking the same thing hallelujah the bride the spirit and the prophet will be saying the same thing oh hallelujah okay wow this is the part i want to get down into amen question and answer on the holy ghost the holy spirit you are believing unto eternal life but when the holy spirit comes it is eternal life this is you are begotten of the spirit at sanctification but never born of the spirit until the holy ghost comes in amen that's correct now he went in the natural type to explain what he's saying here a baby watch but never born is going right a baby got life in the womb of the mother but when it breathes its little muscles are quivering it's a life but it's a different life when it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils so when the baby is in the mother's womb it's a life maybe it's kicking it's quivering it's moving and so on it's not the same life as when it comes on the outside when it comes to the outside it's born when it's on the inside it's begun when they come on the outside it is born when it's on the inside it's begotten it's adding foot and legs and eyes and so on word on top of word on top of word that's begotten all right let's go further my dear methodist brother pregnant holiness and nazarene the baptism of the holy ghost is different from sanctification sanification is a cleansing which is preparation of life but when the holy ghost comes it is life preparation is cleansing the vessel clearing the vessel the holy ghost is filling the vessel sanification means clean and set aside and the holy spirit puts it in service so you are the vessel that god has cleaned up now we find out that the holy ghost is god himself in you god above you pill of fire with moses god with you and jesus christ now god is in you in the holy ghost not three gods but god working in three offices god condescending when god came down and dwelt in that sanctified body a virgin born of a woman that was god himself you know what god did he did nothing he just placed his tent among ours god dwelt in a tent called jesus christ and he pitched his tent with us and that is how god tent was dwell with us you see when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word is the question answers when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word we will be eternally seven christ do you mean the foolish virgin will leave eternally but they will be separated from the new jerusalem where christ will dwell with the bride here are those who do not have the holy spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again if the natural birth here we go requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth requires all these three stages of grace before the person is truly born again you say absolutely i just explained that this morning you have got to have all stages he's going back over again you are begotten of the spirit like a baby begotten in the womb of the mother but not born until they receive the holy ghost that's right you are born then you are not convicted you are in the process of being converted until that time now this is the part that's the reason that all these great mysteries could not be given to luther could not be given to wesley could not be given to the age just passed by the pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten so what he is saying the pentecostal birth god pushed that as begotten when malachi 4 come because he brought the person of jesus christ when that which is perfect has come then that which is part is done away with so watch you cannot teach no baby in the womb so the pentecostal in the womb begotten couldn't get mysteries so the prophet brought the bullet of the oh hallelujah hallelujah the prophet brought the word so you could comfort now and get the mysteries preached to you [Applause] so you are begotten of the blood cell of the word of god isn't that right hallelujah then you are sanctified that's a different life is not right praise god so the blood is what comes by the word to reveal your name so that's why the seven thunders is blood to sanctify you you are not sanctified you are not in the message until you're really sanctified you can't even come to perfection if you're not sanctified because the perfecting of the saints is the sanctified ones so it means that you have to come to that spot to truly live a sanctified life unto god a separated life unto god and your signification is proof you receive and believe the blood oh give the lord a shout in the house i want you to get to this part so bad oh hallelujah so your signification is proof that you received the blood message oh hallelujah hallelujah he sent you hot i will give you a new spirit i will give you then i'll put my spirit in your spirit therefore the blood supposed to give you a change aiming towards others towards people a change in your life and you're still looking for the his spirit to come within your new spirit because your old spirit's so terrible hallelujah you're so troublesome you're so misbehaving and bad attitude that's not christian whether they say even another still preaching that whether you like it or not i still put an adult i am free free free oh hallelujah hallelujah oh give the lord but there are some saints in the house [Applause] oh there's going to be a perfection of the saints so that 7 thunder baby is in you right now oh hallelujah but charity is the life on the outside that's not that seventh on the baby that could you anoint you with charity the spirit is here to anoint that baby inside of you you're gonna be anointed of god hallelujah oh glory to god oh my god my god let me see if we could wrap up here hallelujah though the whole creation is waiting and groaning for the sons of god and arise in the last days with the power of the holy ghost at the end of the age not rise with books and tapes but with the power of the holy ghost amen to reveal the secret things to bring it up but abraham said no the coming of the lord jesus oh close at hand until the spirit from way down here sound vacation back in holy spirit right until the time of the coming of the headstone the church has got to be so perfectly like christ until christ and the church unite together and if you live the life of christ it will act life of christ do the work of christ what does that ministry identify the coming of the lord oh hallelujah oh glory to god remember it cannot be taught in any seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god are you want to hear it it's waiting until the time now all these things be brought come and shape after to the manifestation of the sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly so perfectly until dear ministry will be so close like christ till he will join him and his church together oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah what man fell from his inheritance what's his inheritance he said sonship yes to be a son of god that's inheritance that's inheritance not land and house and car they're not inheritance you're hurting in sunship to be a son of god not church member just

hallelujah get out of him devil that's sonship hallelujah lay hands upon the sick you don't even have to pray just touch your hands did you hear what i said you don't even have to pray just lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that sonship you are anointed with god your hands are anointed your feet anointed paul was so anointed they took clot over his body and people were healed [Applause] sonship imagined by the brandon wife on the operating theater she have a tumor big like a grapefruit and he is speaking before the doctor's son touches my wife the tumor will go down he's overseas he's not in the hospital room he ain't born outside nervous oh gosh oh yeah well no operation he'll bite his nails he is going through song barrier he is going to time space distance means nothing to

not made perfect we got to raise them up we got to get to the ministry of jesus christ we got to get to the voice of the archangel nobody could turn on that voice that voice is what called lazarus from the grave that voice is had to come lazarus had no choice do you understand what power's coming i got no choice in you elijah said i feel like going home jesus come forward i just had to pack up shop and turn around traveling all them three days they just had to come right back and come right back in this body still tied up on that grave clothes only anointing that great clothes upon him and

satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again waiting on the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of god will be manifested with the power of god and will take every power that satan got away from him then the devil will be like powerless like a bluffer with a bow and no arrow hallelujah trying to tell you you're in the jail cell and he cannot stop the door it's already busted open because when jesus died he went and stopped the keys from him he doesn't have the keys of death and hell he doesn't control the keys of death and hell because jesus took the keys away from him he's a bluffer today oh great god hold this body down that can't keep me down oh hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah jesus i've got the keys glory what is god waiting for here we go waiting and trying to get the place's church in position to manifest himself getting one he can walk through like this and said and say what dear is my spirit flowing freely why the ministers don't preach that amen everybody want to talk about the doctrine and the teachings and the revelation and the level of word how high the level of wood is that is not dear is my spirit flowing freely that is there is your level of weird talking freely but that's not what god waiting to hear god wanted to say there's my spirit after 40 years we must hear a word word word when we're going to have the 15-minute service under pentecost peter preached for 15 minutes and three thousand people repented how much mysteries you could preach in 15 minutes and everybody's hearing in their own tongue that that's a mystery that is mystery how hear we all in our own tongue everybody have had different tongues and language and there was all hearing that is supernatural normal 15-minute silent thing that that is a mystery oh you could hear the voice of god in your spirit in your heart in your life get in one you can say there's my spirit fully free there it is i can work here get another one over here and please him i can place him adoption placing manifesting give him a ceremony visit him with an angel tell him something praise god if he told the truth if you make up something it won't work it won't work he said we had plenty of that a real manifestation of the sons of god when god manifests himself he sends him out and then what he goes for what he says is the truth what he does is the truth and what he does he manifests christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the world how will the judge know by if you fellowship with that one yeah convention they judge it by everything else but by what the prophet says how do you judge a man how are you supposed to judge me by how i stay with the word so if i stay with the word today i am with the word amen i don't have to be with nobody else as long as we read the word and i'm with everybody else who is with the word amen amen all right whoa now when these offices and places but abraham say oh okay are we almost done i gotta finish this off because this is this is amen amen amen somebody's gone but yeah like like they want to back you up on that boy hey [Applause] now watch watch but around from a prophet like unto moses hear these words watch five spiritual offices in the church to set the tuition order apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors these those are called the offices of god then in a local congregation there are nine spiritual gifts now in these offices and places in the offices you hear from the apostle ministry you hear from the prophet his ministry from the evangelist from the teacher from the pastor each has a separate ministry and their ministries of god and god has set them in a church for this purpose he didn't say some podi coming and take over he said you're here he's here all right like some in africa somebody said don't go to the pastor go to the five hole who's the fivefold a man picking people and say five four five five four five five and in five photos the men he picked so they're trying to mess up churches by bringing a nice denomination with papa behind that poor period behind that everybody want to be a pulpit there is a curse that we have from the very first tweetage they take the anointing of the people and put it on a man they conquered the laity and the lady batted down in the corner and goes i hate it he call her the d's of the nicolaitan that become a doctrine because god is the god of the audience he won't caught back in the people he want the perfection of the saints [Music] the ministry pastor teacher is for the perfecting of the saints god to bring this body into a final close to represent him on the earth it will be christ ministry reproduced he presents his army in the form of five officers he presents his army he says pastor prophet teaches evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy each one backing one another up with him there we go the chief captain not out there in front not up here not above not behind but in them that's the army vindicating and vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his works oh my my my almost done that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he will place into the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanted his work done he sent it to his son the son who wanted his work done he sent him to the church at that day you will know i am in the father the father and me and i knew and you and me at that day because here we go the same power that was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ the same power that rested in jesus christ rest in placed sons in the body of christ muslims come up please the same power that resident jesus christ rest in placed sons he didn't say sons he said place sons these are sons that the holy spirit reported on [Music] so these sons have been approved by the father after being pushed into the place of trend by the spirit oh hallelujah listen if god revealed to you that you and the place are trying you are blessed above all men [Music] you ought to be qualified when the willingness people die there you go when god should be willing to say about turn you know will the who but jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness to amen to be tested hallelujah hallelujah glory to god thank
