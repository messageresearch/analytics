[1:07:45] us we have a greeting from Brother sham
[1:07:48] he'll come a minute but just want to
[1:07:49] share something with you and this is
[1:07:52] from 2 Timothy 3:16 it says all
[1:07:55] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:07:57] and is profitable for Doctrine for
[1:07:59] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:08:02] and righteousness and that in the
[1:08:04] Amplified they say every scripture is
[1:08:05] God breathed given by his inspiration
[1:08:09] profitable for instruction for Repro and
[1:08:11] conviction of sin for correction of
[1:08:14] error and discipline in obedience and
[1:08:17] for training in righteousness in holy
[1:08:19] living in Conformity to God's will in
[1:08:22] thought purpose and action and the thing
[1:08:26] about the gospel coming forth every
[1:08:27] scripture being God breathed is how the
[1:08:31] word is received and 1 Thessalonians
[1:08:34] 2:13 says for this cause also we thank
[1:08:37] we god without ceasing because when you
[1:08:39] have received the word of God which you
[1:08:41] heard of us you receive it not as the
[1:08:43] word of a man but as it in Truth the
[1:08:46] word of God which effectively worketh
[1:08:49] also in you that believe and in
[1:08:51] Amplified it says here and we also
[1:08:53] especially thank God continually for
[1:08:56] this that when you receive the message
[1:08:58] of God which you heard from us you
[1:09:01] welcome it not as the word of M men but
[1:09:03] as it truly is the word of God which is
[1:09:07] effectually at work in you who believe
[1:09:10] exercising it superhuman power in those
[1:09:13] who adhere to and Trust in and rely on
[1:09:16] it so this word that's being spoken is
[1:09:19] effective this word is effective
[1:09:22] depending upon how you receive it and
[1:09:24] you could rece receive it formally and
[1:09:26] outwardly or you could receive it
[1:09:27] willingly and inwardly and if you
[1:09:29] receive it willingly and inwardly it
[1:09:31] could have an Effectiveness in your life
[1:09:34] because the the many who heard it didn't
[1:09:36] re it it wasn't effective to them
[1:09:37] because they didn't have faith to
[1:09:38] receive it so how God want you to
[1:09:40] receive the word is willingly and
[1:09:43] inwardly not forly and outwardly and I
[1:09:46] am believing God this morning this
[1:09:47] evening that the pillar of fire would
[1:09:49] come down upon these sons of God and
[1:09:52] will speak to you the elect remember
[1:09:54] it's not about the minister it's about
[1:09:57] you the bride remember it's not about
[1:09:59] who is behind the pulpit is what the
[1:10:01] inspiration could speak remember God is
[1:10:03] God he is not God of your church he is
[1:10:06] God almighty praise God and he is no
[1:10:09] respect of persons he know your needs he
[1:10:12] know your tears he knows your fears he
[1:10:15] knows your weakness he knows your
[1:10:17] struggle he know just what you are here
[1:10:19] for and he's going to deliver and I'm
[1:10:22] believing that Pillar of Fire going to
[1:10:24] rest upon the sons of God and speak
[1:10:27] direct to you praise God praise God so
[1:10:31] it's a blessing and privilege you may be

[1:13:10] together for this International
[1:13:14] Convention I would like to first of
[1:13:18] all commend very
[1:13:21] highly brother
[1:13:23] too the host pastor
[1:13:26] who together with his associate
[1:13:29] ministers and the Believers of The
[1:13:31] Headstone
[1:13:33] Tabernacle who have all worked very
[1:13:37] hard to make these meetings
[1:13:41] possible my deepest
[1:13:44] respects to all the Servants of God
[1:13:48] present especially those who have
[1:13:52] traveled great distances to be here
[1:13:57] my prayer is that the Holy
[1:13:59] Spirit would anoint you and inspire
[1:14:03] you to deliver what has been laid upon
[1:14:07] your
[1:14:09] heart
[1:14:11] amen and of
[1:14:13] course I must greet the elect
[1:14:16] lady the lovely Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:19] Christ
[1:14:21] [Applause]
[1:14:28] without whom these
[1:14:31] Services would be all in
[1:14:35] vain amen
[1:14:38] amen it is my esteem
[1:14:43] honor and privilege to address the
[1:14:46] gathering this
[1:14:49] afternoon in the absence of a provided
[1:14:53] team I sincerely hope
[1:14:55] hope that my few remarks would be
[1:14:58] relevant and
[1:15:01] appropriate as many of you would
[1:15:04] know I have been around the message for
[1:15:07] quite a long
[1:15:08] time over the past five
[1:15:11] decades I have made certain
[1:15:15] observation some of which I would like
[1:15:17] to
[1:15:18] use as a
[1:15:20] basis for my
[1:15:23] contribution from the breaking of the
[1:15:26] seals in
[1:15:29] 1963 to where we are
[1:15:32] presently it has
[1:15:34] been approximately 61
[1:15:38] years and so I believe it is feir to
[1:15:41] see that our
[1:15:45] walk with this great
[1:15:47] message started many years
[1:15:51] ago it has been more than 60 years
[1:15:56] since the opening of the
[1:15:58] word and so I believe it is only
[1:16:02] reasonable to wonder how
[1:16:05] close or how
[1:16:08] far amen we are we are from our
[1:16:13] god-given
[1:16:15] goal you see
[1:16:17] friends it is my personal
[1:16:21] conviction the bride today is not as
[1:16:24] close
[1:16:25] to her Perfection as she ought to
[1:16:28] be given the length of time she has
[1:16:32] been exposed to the revealing of the
[1:16:37] word and when we consider the flashing
[1:16:40] red
[1:16:41] lights of the Lord's coming all around
[1:16:44] us not to mention the
[1:16:47] handwriting that is on the
[1:16:50] wall how could we not be concerned
[1:16:55] would it take us another 61
[1:16:58] years to get to where we need to
[1:17:02] be what are the things that are
[1:17:04] hindering
[1:17:06] us from hitting the
[1:17:08] Target and achieving Our God given
[1:17:14] objectives should we be
[1:17:16] satisfied to continue the way we have
[1:17:19] been
[1:17:20] going when there are so many unfulfilled
[1:17:23] promises
[1:17:25] in the word of
[1:17:26] God which demand our urgent
[1:17:30] attention after all these years we are
[1:17:33] still
[1:17:34] awaiting the
[1:17:36] Fulfillment of Mark
[1:17:38] 11:23 St John
[1:17:41] 1412 the Greater Works the adoption of
[1:17:45] son of the sons of God the manifestation
[1:17:48] of the sons of God the bride's
[1:17:52] Revival which includes the restoration
[1:17:55] of missing
[1:17:57] limbs by the power of the spoken
[1:18:01] word and while we
[1:18:03] may and while many around the message
[1:18:08] says that our
[1:18:09] setbacks are due to doctrinal
[1:18:13] differences or doctrinal
[1:18:16] issues and problems relating to
[1:18:19] Doctrine I would like to suggest to you
[1:18:22] this
[1:18:23] afternoon that what we are facing is
[1:18:26] really a life problem right where the
[1:18:31] corrup of the
[1:18:33] people is
[1:18:35] not developing as it ought to
[1:18:39] be over the past 60
[1:18:42] years many God inspired
[1:18:45] ministers have been expounding to the
[1:18:48] people The unsearchable Riches of Jesus
[1:18:53] Christ exploring in great
[1:18:56] details every major doctrinal truth of
[1:19:00] the
[1:19:02] message yet there are
[1:19:04] many little results which we can point
[1:19:08] to very little
[1:19:11] manifestation a whole lot of
[1:19:13] Dynamics and very
[1:19:16] little a whole lot of
[1:19:18] mechanics with very little
[1:19:22] Dynamics but saints of God
[1:19:25] I would like to present for our
[1:19:29] consideration the following
[1:19:31] quotation which I believe will help us
[1:19:35] to better
[1:19:36] understand what
[1:19:38] is responsible for the
[1:19:41] imbalance that we have been
[1:19:44] witnessing I am quoting from the message
[1:19:47] humble
[1:19:48] th July 63 paragraph
[1:19:52] 72 brother Vil speaks for 70 minutes on
[1:19:58] Mark 16:15
[1:20:01] to2 and other
[1:20:04] scriptures
[1:20:06] entitled why has Mark 16 not worked and
[1:20:10] how according to the
[1:20:12] scriptures to make it
[1:20:15] work and here the prophet went on to
[1:20:18] tell us in paragraph
[1:20:22] 74 I was thinking here
[1:20:25] a one little
[1:20:27] illustration to back of what he
[1:20:30] said now we look to this
[1:20:33] watch to find out the time what time it
[1:20:37] is unless at every
[1:20:40] instrument in that watch is
[1:20:43] coordinating means to work together
[1:20:47] effectively and
[1:20:49] harmoniously with one another we will
[1:20:52] never know the correct time
[1:20:55] is that right amen and that takes all of
[1:20:58] us together if we want to see the third
[1:21:02] pool really do something for
[1:21:05] God is
[1:21:07] coordinating with every one of us
[1:21:10] together to Humble ourselves before
[1:21:14] God so here we see the prophet making a
[1:21:18] connection between the third pool and
[1:21:21] the
[1:21:22] humility that is required of the True
[1:21:25] Believer then he goes on to say in
[1:21:28] paragraph
[1:21:29] 77 you know people want power and really
[1:21:33] they don't know what power is see they
[1:21:37] don't really know what goes with it the
[1:21:41] Way Up Is Down always if you want Power
[1:21:46] see how humble you can get just get away
[1:21:50] from all your worldly thinking and
[1:21:53] humble yourselves before
[1:21:58] God and then you have got more power
[1:22:02] than the man that runs all over the
[1:22:04] building and makes a lot of noise see
[1:22:08] because you have been able to conquer
[1:22:11] yourself and commit yourself to Christ
[1:22:15] you see to humble yourself before him
[1:22:18] that's really
[1:22:20] power paragraph
[1:22:22] 78 you show me your church that's humble
[1:22:26] real humble not arrogancy a church just
[1:22:31] sweet humble I will show you a church
[1:22:35] amen that has the favor and power of God
[1:22:38] in it hallelujah
[1:22:41] amen which is Grace on the part of The
[1:22:44] Giver made accepted that's right that's
[1:22:49] the thing it takes humility humbling
[1:22:53] yourself before God
[1:22:55] letting God just work through us then as
[1:22:58] you continue to read read it in
[1:23:00] paragraph 103 of the same message the
[1:23:04] prophet goes on to say look at Jesus
[1:23:08] nothing but one bundle of Love see amen
[1:23:13] he was God
[1:23:15] manifested Amen he God expressed himself
[1:23:19] through him no wonder Miracles and
[1:23:23] things happen happened his humble life
[1:23:27] consecrated lives to God from being God
[1:23:32] to be a man here on Earth to express God
[1:23:35] for himself that's what made him what he
[1:23:38] was I always said what made Jesus God to
[1:23:42] me was the way he humbled himself he was
[1:23:46] so great and yet amen could be so
[1:23:50] small that's right you see friends
[1:23:55] it was for this reason that God's
[1:23:57] servant and Prophet to us
[1:24:00] Amen in his teaching on the SM chur a
[1:24:05] man without
[1:24:06] corruptor can't rain because power apart
[1:24:10] from
[1:24:11] corrup is
[1:24:14] satanic but Power with corrup is f to
[1:24:17] Rule now my friends if maybe I could
[1:24:21] briefly address another area of concern
[1:24:25] I believe that both ministers and
[1:24:27] Believers alike must
[1:24:29] demonstrate a deeper
[1:24:32] respect amen for each other and must
[1:24:36] treat each other with respect
[1:24:40] recognizing that in the kingdom of God
[1:24:44] Amen we all have our part to play I Am
[1:24:47] quoting from revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:50] chapter 4 paragraph 118 the prophet is
[1:24:53] saying
[1:24:55] tell me what to stop brother now
[1:24:57] everybody can be a preacher but you got
[1:25:00] a

[1:29:10] your Doctrine if you miss that

[1:31:10] 346 of the same message we hear the
[1:31:13] prophet
[1:31:14] saying now that is the house that God
[1:31:18] dwells

[2:07:07] I'm standing just next to him but he
[2:07:10] does it praise the Lord I'm only one
[2:07:13] that's near when he does it I was only
[2:07:17] the voice that he used to say
[2:07:20] it praise the Lord Lord how humble the
[2:07:23] prophet was he said I'm only a voice
[2:07:26] that he could use praise the

[2:22:30] Vindication of his presence you find
[2:22:33] healings you find deliverances you find

[2:23:17] thing when you start down he said the
[2:23:19] first you find a ram here he's got the
[2:23:23] unsaved in it praise the Lord and I just
[2:23:27] is the unsaved ones in the round below
[2:23:30] brother brandham says it's the souls in
[2:23:32] prison that never
[2:23:34] repented if they would have only
[2:23:37] repented in the days of Noah they
[2:23:39] wouldn't be found in that place brother
[2:23:42] BR says demon possessed men spirits of
[2:23:44] th those fallen angels that repented not
[2:23:47] y back in the beginning that's the first
[2:23:50] realm down now brother Bram said the
[2:23:53] next realm is demons and the next is
[2:23:56] Hell itself and he says the world is
[2:24:01] influenced the world is influenced and
[2:24:03] you see it all over why is there where
[2:24:06] from where the influence is coming the
[2:24:08] world is influenced by these demon
[2:24:10] powers through this Trinity through
[2:24:13] these three Realms the world is
[2:24:15] influenced now brother Brenham says and
[2:24:18] the Christian are influenced by a spirit
[2:24:22] too they're influenced by the Holy
[2:24:25] Spirit I was just the one standing next
[2:24:27] to him influenced by the Holy Spirit he
[2:24:30] said the first real is the holy
[2:24:34] spirit so you have three RMS going down
[2:24:37] and you have three Realms going up
[2:24:38] brother BR says the first realm is the
[2:24:41] holy spirit above and he said it's for
[2:24:45] Christians praise the Lord the realm of
[2:24:48] the Holy Spirit is for
[2:24:51] Christians praise the Lord he brother BR

[2:24:57] by the blood of Jesus Christ that is
[2:25:00] influenced and Born Again by the spirit
[2:25:03] of God Amen so the Born Again influenced
[2:25:07] by the spirit is finding himself in
[2:25:09] another realm no more in a realm of five
[2:25:12] senses but in another real and it says
[2:25:15] the next layer is angels and the next
[2:25:18] Heaven Is God so you have Holy Spirit
[2:25:21] angels and God and the Holy Spirit come
[2:25:24] past angels and came down to redeem
[2:25:28] sinner on level zero praise the Lord

[2:58:43] trying to get to you the presence of his
[2:58:47] being
[2:58:54] hereall look this way all too many read

[2:59:18] brother Bram says and they just pass
[2:59:21] right on
[2:59:24] it they don't see

[2:59:56] spirit if they saw it young people if
[3:00:00] you can see that by getting in the
[3:00:03] spirit of this
[3:00:05] word they would know that if they want
[3:00:09] to receive the Holy Ghost that's right
[3:00:14] excess if you want the
[3:00:16] excess praise the Lord they would know
[3:00:20] if they want to receive the Holy Spirit
[3:00:23] they need to repent and be baptized in
[3:00:26] the name of the Lord Jesus and then God
[3:00:29] would be Duty bound Duty bound he cannot
[3:00:34] change his mind Duty bound because it's
[3:00:38] his word and the Holy Spirit is bound to
[3:00:41] the word Duty bound to fulfill his word
[3:00:45] by filling them with the Holy Spirit
[3:00:48] praise the Lord but why so many didn't
[3:00:51] get baptized he says because they didn't
[3:00:54] get in the spirit of the
[3:00:57] word they never get in his Spirit or it
[3:01:01] would have happened to them exactly as
[3:01:04] the words say brother BR says pray to
[3:01:07] God for Revelation by his Spirit that's
