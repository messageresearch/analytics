for my God bless you God bless you all and glad to be in the house of the Lord again this morning if you have a Bible it's like you pay attention quickly to a few portions of scripture I'd like invite attention to Acts 2 Romans 7 and Romans 8. the book of Acts chapter 2. uh speaking about the day of Pentecost Acts 2 and um everything was one and if you have a marker Roman 7 I'll read from verse 7. and then Romans 8 verses 105 asked you um everything was one the former Chinese of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion but many infallible proofs being sin of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water for he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hands when did therefore will come together they asked of him saying Lord will at this time restore against the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but you shall received power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and on to the uttermost part of the Earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight and while um they looked steepestly I'm sorry I'm already asked you I was wondering the only sounding familiar I'm so sorry I'm so sorry maybe I should speak on that anyway I'm so sorry I asked you dear Pinnacles um verse one so we have to go through this all over again okay I'm sorry I'm getting old I'm so sorry actor Arie from verse 1. and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they apparent to them clothing tongues like as of fire and he set upon each of them and they were all through the Holy Ghost and began to speak with all the tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man had every man had them speak in his own language and they were all amazing Marvel same one to another behold and not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians amides and elamis and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and Cappadocia in punters and Asia freygar and panfilia in Egypt and in the past of Libya about sarin and strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes critics and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongue the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and whined out no they're confused you were perplexed saying one to another what minute this amen what minute this Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of saints and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen Romans 7. let me get this from verse 15. you can you can when you get home you can read from verse seven all the way down well let's pick it up from verse 15. for that which I do I allow not but what a word that do I not but what I hate that do I incredible what I don't want to do that's what I do what I want to do I can do it incredible even I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will his present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do how many can relate now if I do that I would not it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find them alone that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warned against the law of my mind I'm bringing bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members all wretched men that I am who shall deliver me from the from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin chapter 8. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not out to the flesh but after the spirit for the law of a spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God's saying his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk after the flesh but after the spirit for this that are in the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but if that after the spirit the things of the spirit amen may the Lord are these bless the written of his holy words God bless you you may be seated God bless you again and good morning one more time and so for my thank you again for that tremendous tremendous um song God Is Bigger Than all my problems amen I feel the same ways that are from and I'm sure we all feel the same with his mind God bless you well this morning um um so this mine are trust I won't roll you too long um I want to speak on the subject of the language of your birth I mean the language of your birth and I got a few kind of scriptures here um Galatians 5 um 16-21 and Galatians 5 16 to 21 and 17-22 and then also my inspiration is the repellent of predestination you know what a repellent is about mamco repellent but we call it repellent you know when you have um um books that book your plant like ants and wheat hands that you know eat your plants you spray those plants with what you call a repellent when mosquitoes trouble in your home you spray a repellent insect mosquito insect repellent or muscular repellent when cockroaches are a problem in your house you spray the room or the house with a repellent and when those cockeries or insects or termites whatever come there they move back so brother Branham said the same way predestination is a repellent and God spreads you with the repellent of predestination and that's my inspiration this morning amen are you happy amen amen Amen brother bam said predestination that's the mystery and truly if you and I really can get away from our human thinking our human thing which is our problem mainly get away from our human thinking but you know what many times we are trying to get away from our human thinking and try to we are not called to do that we're not called to do that we're not called to do anything in the flesh nothing not a single thing in the flesh because when you try to do that in the flesh you are walking with willpower I'll try to do it I will do it I will struggle it doesn't work it will never work Paul said the law of sin is in the flesh we're not called to even do a single thing with the flesh Allah we were speaking last night gods are foreign knowledge saw you struggling in the flesh struggling in the flesh he didn't look on that if he was going to look upon how many times you'll fail how many times you fell and got up you will not even call you but God looked upon the heart because God doesn't judge the way man judges God saw in your heart the desire the desire for him and God just who will want it who will know money who has a desire on the inside of them for God who wants God who want in spite of their challenges in spite of falling and Rising who wants it on the inside of them that's what God's looking for and When God says that that's what he grabs the whole of so God doesn't deal with this flesh here he deals with the heart amen so we don't will on the outside here we will in the heart amen amen amen amen May 7 19 46. an angel came to William Branham amen you can shut it off an angel came to William Branham and you know the story even though um some try to dispute it these days that never happened and all that stuff that's fine there their problem at Green's Mill and um and he had been having some expansion in his life and some were telling me it's an evil spirit I'm somewhat you know he felt this was God because it didn't he didn't see it out of the scriptures I mean they don't see it was different from what the Bible said could take place so he hadn't experienced that again he said no I am not going to come back until God speaks to me about this so you went away and had a little place where he meets God and went to Green's Mill a little place where he locked himself up God if I don't hear from you I'm not going anywhere and he prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed how it will be good to have Christians like that again amen and brother Brown wasn't an Auburn at the time he wasn't an old man at all so anyway so he he was just in Aesthetics and so he prayed and right about 11 pm at night he said a lot came in the room and from the light a man appeared and he once he had his voice the man said that fear not he said once heard that voice he knew right away this is the same voice that I spoke to him all the time the symbols of the angel of God that had been with him all the time amen an angel is he's standing right by your side that's our heritage as sons of God I know some in the past have over beaten these angels and but it's true it's but the problem said you can't believe God's word and not believe in angels not believe in angels to save you Angels don't save us angels are servants that are sent to minister unto us The Heirs of Salvation angels protect us Angels watch over us and just take a report back to God about our Behavior amen Angels keep us on our toes the very fact that we know Angels around makes us conscious that Heavenly a Heavenly Host is watching us amen so an angel the angel came and once he spoke but mama said he knew right away this was the same angel that had always spoken to him and said I've been sent from the prince of God to tell you that give you have been given a message that will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ and began to speak your brother Branham and tell him different things and bobans asked him like that oh yeah and and you'll be sent with a sign and all that and things like that bam said the people won't believe me he said no I'll give you a son like Moses I give you two signs one in the hand and all that and my mom said but the ministers will not believe me then it's not for the ministers it's for the people because the missiles usually and you and I experience that are not seeing anything against Ministries because I'm one myself but the truth is that we ministers cause most of the trouble the people don't have a problem mostly it's the ministers that cause a problem with the things we teach with our Behavior with the things we tell the churches with ministers like the Army Pastor myself so I'm talking to myself here amen many times we are saying things there a person has a fight with this church here and his truck people must get in that fight they must buy their pastors fight the angel told him it's not for the ministers it's for the people they're not sent to the minister you are sent to the people Jesus himself didn't come to the ministers he came to the lost sheep of the House of Israel it's not a minister thing [Applause] and brother one other thing brother said everything that angel told him he checked up with the scriptures he didn't say because of the Angel and with the prince of God it shed it up from the scriptures every single thing that angel told him he checked up from the scriptures and the Bible said beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits see if there of God if you are from Lagos check me out whatever you go to check the watch from the puppet check it out amen that's your heritage that's your that's your responsibility as a Christian as a Believer you may be seated [Applause] so brother Benham said brother said you check everything out that then you told him and then the angel told him these very very memorable words that you know what on Earth many speak just everyone chatter as a police but they don't seem to realize that in heaven the thoughts of man's heart speak their thoughts speak louder in heaven than they are what do on Earth and that's where I want to start from this morning your thoughts actually speak amen we know a word is a thought expressed but because those who watch those thoughts become what they actually speak those words speak in heaven they speak on Earth your thoughts speak your words speak your life speaks I'm sure you heard the phrase action speak louder than words your thoughts speak your thoughts actually Awards your first actually are things as a matter of fact nothing happens but what you think about it first and your thoughts they are words your thoughts are things and nothing is going to Define you more than the quality of thinking in your heart it's not so much what you do on the outside as a matter of fact there's nothing you and I can do but what we think about it first so your words are thought your thoughts are words and your thoughts speak your words speak your life speaks amen can you say Amen amen hallelujah amen so anyway when the angel told him that Amen brother was a revelation to him that your life speaks because your life is made up of your thoughts your words and your actions in other words your life speaks your life speaks your life is a letter your life is something that somebody can read they can hear they can see your life speaks can you say Amen so each one of us here we are speaking even though we are not speaking even though you are not saying what you are speaking that's the authority and the Heritage God gave you as a human being Hallelujah you can influence without saying one word you can influence a whole generation without saying one word you can send so many souls to Hell Without saying one word your behavior your actions can speak more than you it was what even will your thoughts speak in heaven larger than the Zion out here I didn't say one word I didn't see anything no your thoughts speak [Applause] amen leader [Music] oh come on brother Peter tremendous Which medicine leader young man really really far for God reach a medicine leader amen so your life speaks amen your life is made up of your thoughts your words and your actions in other words your Deeds the things that you do that's what your life is made up of Amen and when we talk of speaking why don't you go speaking I see your life speaks so what's the language what's the language here we come from different tribes many of us come from this nation maybe somebody from outside the country I don't know but many of us come from different tribes and when we speak we have a language we have evil hausa Yoruba um name it those are the three major tribes that make your tribes even in those trials you have so many different dialects and when you say the language of My Tribe you know what I'm talking about I'm talking to Igbo or hausa or whatever Yoruba whatever Dalek I'm talking about so I'm talking about the language of your birth the language that your breath speaks that's what I'm talking about what voice is that language what language is it is it Yoruba that your life is speaking that your breath is speaking all right glory to God Amen Hallelujah you are speaking you are a testimony right or wrong possible negative you are a testimony your life is speaking oh Hallelujah shall amend somebody amen get yourself some Elbow Room this is an apple room because you are gonna shout you are going to look your devils in the eye you are going to run those Devils out of your life not your past is going to do you are going to do yourself because you come from God and you are going back to God again showed you last night there is nothing against you nothing has been restricted now struck off and your name has been transferred to a new book right here this morning you are sitting elected in the Lamb's Book of Life and you're only waiting for a mighty Rush Madison from Heaven amen as a Russian Mighty Wind you maybe see that amen so what language are we talking about here what language are we talking about here amen the language your life speaks is the language of your birth on the day of Pentacles those men cried out how here we go from different nations mind you and the apostles who are speaking speaking in tongues like we say and each one of them every nation not one nation was left out every nation that was there said how come they were they were shocked they were surprised how come we had them speaking in the language they taught where we were born in what's going on here there were perplexed they were confused they were in doubt that meant they were wondering they couldn't put their finger on what's going on here what meaneth this had these men drunk what's going on here they're speaking and they don't come from a country but they're speaking and we understand the language and I said the same way your life speaks because the angel said your thought speaks in heaven and if your thoughts speaks so it's not just your actions that speak your thoughts speak your words speak and your actions speak so your life speaks [Applause] and what language is this here is it Yoruba Igbo hausa English Spanish French uh Chinese whatever language it is no it's none of those the language is the language of your birth the language of my path that's the language our life speaks Hallelujah so every day I wake up in the morning I wake up I'll go to bed at night my life that day has spoken to somebody my life has spoken from the land of my path and where is the land of your past Hallelujah glory to God you've got to know where you are born from and when you know where you're born from you have the authority then the authority is given to you then to live like one from that land Hallelujah [Applause] Orange you may be seated [Music] the language your life speaks is the language of your breath and it's a universal language it's the language of the human tribe whether we are evil hausa Yoruba Englishman white man black man Green Man yellow man it matters not it's a universal language that's why every nation there could hear it because your universal language the language of about everybody has it everybody understands it nobody can say I don't understand that no you lie you understand the language because it's a human language every human being understands this language it's a universal language we all speak the same common language can somebody say hallelujah [Music] [Applause] Glory to cut in man you really see this amen so like the word that means the same in every language Hallelujah in every language means praise God when you say hallelujah you know how to tell the Chinese what does that mean many times they say things in Hebrew and I say that what does that mean Mercy you don't know that after all these years and your wife is evil you don't know all these years nobody has to tell you that you want to say hallelujah everybody knows it means praise God that's the word that means the same thing in every language and the same with this language of your birth nobody has to say what does that mean we understand it universally nobody can say what does he mean by that no we understand it it's a universal language can somebody say Amen Oh Glory to God Amen I won't belong with you but you're going to receive an experience this morning amen so the language of your life it understood by every man in every language needs no translation needs no interpretation it's a universal language the language of your life it's a universal language why because the language of your birth amen that's why it's Universal because birth is universal we are born the same way white man Green Man gray man we're all born the same way if we are born the same way we all come out of our mother's womb the same way we are conceived in our mother's wombs the same way so we are born the same way Universal anywhere on this Earth Here White Man Poor Man rich man wealthy man amen King George whoever we are all born the same way our breath comes the same way and so the language of our birth is universal the same way amen I know the story when God made man there's no need for human bath no Adam spoke a language the language of his birth the land where he came from the prince of God the book of redemption the Lamb's Book of Redemption where God's life was in that book and Adam spoke and spoke from that book he lived from that book that was the language that his life spoken amen but then something happened in human birth even the back by sex was introduced and the whole program changed but let me leave that alone for a while amen all right [Applause] amen so the language of your birth the language of your life the same language in every way on the face of the earth is a universal language because we're all upon the same way and we all speak the same language the language of our birth so what's this language about what is it amen what is it is the language is the language of human nature it's the language that human nature speaks and that's why it's Universal because all of us being human beings we have the same nature same human nature we all have this in nature Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell and those Believers that had worked with Jesus Christ and others that had believed their testimony about 120 of them in the upper room the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they were sealed baptized the Holy Ghost and adopted at the same time those things happen at the same time because God was trying to set a foundation the foundational Christian Church God Jesus I prophesied upon this walk I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and this was that prophecy coming into fulfillment the church was being born on the day of Pentecost and so the Holy Ghost came to birth to give back to that church and they were born again each one of them and they were also adopted at the same time and that's where Pentecost misses it Pentecost cannot separate that on the view of Pentacles they didn't just received the basement of the Holy Ghost no they received the Batman of the Holy Ghost and immediately they were also adopted [Applause] and that's what Pentecost misses beyond your bottom of the Holy Ghost there is a promise of adoption time as a matter of fact you are not ready for adoption yet until you are baptized in the Holy Ghost until you have baptized the Holy Ghost you are not on the match to adoption yet you're not on the match to burn Sons feel your sons that's going to speak the word and their words gonna be backed you are not on the road yet to get the demons to back up when you speak demon scream for life [Music] amen so when the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and began to speak they're going to speak as they speak of the motion runs and the different people from it was noise abroad something is happening in the upper room there and everybody came to see like come and see they came to see and when they saw their hands that's how I was trying to people who are around but then this man I'm understanding what he's saying I hear what he's saying I understand what he's saying and they set those memorable words how he outcome these men are Jews how come they are speaking a language you understand they're speaking a language of the land of our birth the language they were speaking was the language of human nature and you speak the language all the time you and I speak the language all the time because your life speaks your life speaks amen Oh Glory to God Amen so on the dear panickers amen when those words went out how here are we they were perplexed they were wondering they were confused how here we them speaking the language of a bath maybe she did maybe she did oh my God already Hallelujah are you following my story amen Oh Glory I'm almost done I'm almost done amen ities they were galileans parthians minis elamites Mesopotamians uh uh Julians yet they all had the same language the language of their birth amen unlike them we have a natural place of our birth and our natural breath speaks you know many times you say oh that's how you realize that that's how they talk you ever heard that oh that's our evil said that's just how they do that's how they think and that's how the reason the language of your birth in this case the other way hearing the words are understood the words but like I told you earlier it's not just words that speak your thoughts speaks your words speak your actions speak your whole life speaks your whole life is a letter your whole life is a testimony your whole life is each your whole life is speaking words right now amen oh brother amen amen amen glory to God amen so a natural but speaks your birth speaks a language the language of human nature what's human nature that nature is in the soul your life is speaking from the soul life is really in the soul that's where you have birthed from that's where you are born from amen when God gave birth to Adam and Adam in the Garden of Eden and then Eve later go put his cities genius life his nature in the soul of Adam and that Soul lived out the Bible said Man became a living soul so the life that man was leaving was his soul actually walking around his son actually was leaving and walking around that was the language Adam's life was speaking and what was that life here the life of a Son of God was going through the Garden of Eden Man became a living Soul he wasn't Man became an alive Soul because he can be alive and dead but Adam was leaving the two different things living is a present active active action living present tense his soul was living in other words nature the nature of God in Adam's Soul was living out as Adam walked through the garden and that was the language Adam's life spoke the language is not so much your words the language amen comes from the soul on the inside of you Hallelujah that's the soul that's the language that's the language of your birth whatever is in your soul that comes out that's the language of your birth oh Hallelujah Oh Glory to God Amen we're almost home now we are almost home glory to God Amen are you following me are you following that story is your story of redemption are you finding a story amen so here we are this morning you and I are here this morning and our life also speaks our life is speaking the language and I may ask you what language is your life speaking they said and you can say we hear them they are speaking the language of Our Lives the language from the land of our birth what language is your life speaking you know too many of us can say I didn't do that don't talk to me don't judge me no I'm not talking about what the other person thinks of you I'm talking about you yourself this morning what language is your life speaking you know too many times too many times I spoke to you last night about the book and I'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna connect them together you know that's the book of life and the Lamb's Book of redemption the Lamb's Book of Life but here we are here we at it this morning many of us have saved many of us give a testimony Holy Ghost but we're still living the people who are in The Book of Life we're still living from the land of The Book of Life while we have been trained over and we're supposed to leave from the land of the Lamb's Book of redemption the language of your birth of the light of your birth how hear them they speak in the language of the place where we were born from where are you being brought from The Book of Life or the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] but you are going out free this morning let me say it in the name of the Lord you are going out free this morning I'm not supposing so I am telling you so Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory to God you may be seated show me let me ask you what language is your life speaking what language is your path speaking you are either born from above or born from here those are the children that's why it was a universal language whether you are born in Europe or in America or China it doesn't matter it's out from above or from here and if you are from here you speak to an invested language the language of human nature if you are from above it speaks one in Versa language the language of God's nature [Applause] whether you are evil hausa your Aruba whatever it is China man it doesn't matter you are either born from above or born from below when you are born from above you are speaking from the land of your path the land of human nature and the language of life is going to be the language of human nature was the language the law of sin and death in your members the law of sin and death in the flesh what I would I would not that which I don't want to do that I find myself doing you can help it is the land is the language of the land of your birth you cannot help no matter how hard you try you cannot help it if you could help you would not need a savior come on somebody say Amen if you could help it we would not need a savior [Applause] if you could help it if your will power could do it we will not need Jesus Christ he would have died in vain then so ask yourself this morning what what language is my life speaking is my life speaking the language of the land from heaven or is my last language from here or is my life speaking a mixture of both [Applause] [Music] so in your soul because this language is language of human nature and human nature is the same thing when you're created man or when you formed man when he created a man on the sick day the god of Eden you know the story Manning just he didn't just tap from that 60 when God created man has is beginning from way back yeah his Origins from way back and that's very scientists who want to talk about the origins of life and start it and say my side from a tadpole because they know even they know that money just start you know like that there's something that precedes men they know that themselves so they want to prove and say like that okay monster from a tadpole and from a tadpoles were higher being to a higher one then to an ape to a chimpanzee and then man was formed they are right in the sense that they know man come from a from some other being but they think man came from a lower being but man actually come from a higher bin and all man was supposed to do was to leave was to leave a life from the land of his birth which is from heaven which are from the man of God we from the mind of Christ from the back part of the beginning what life is that the life of God himself the life of a seven spirits of God with the Bible calls the mindful fruit mindful fruit and Adam was in the garden and Adam lived a life from this land of his birth and Adam's life spoke he spoke the language of his path many times 95 of of communication of speaking is non-verbal so when we're talking about your language it is not what what what what was 95 of speaking science will tell you is non-verbal your attitude is a speaking you just come in you just have an attitude you are speaking daddy and mommy talk to you you just squeeze your face you are speaking your son does something you just take a look at them and just blink you are speaking you haven't said one word that's what you call non-verbal communication most of our communication comes like that your son is running all over this place here you just look at me and say I'll just call him like that hey son that's all you say you understand so mommy doesn't like this that doesn't like this so when we talk language it's not just words is your whole life your thoughts your attitudes your thinking your words your speech that's your life that's the language here and this is what comes from the heart and when Adam was walking through the garden Adam was speaking from the line of his path Hallelujah there was a Son of God birth on the face of the earth a Bones on a fear son that have full anointment authority to walk on the face of the Earth in the in the place of his father God a tree never died before Adam no nothing could die before Adam Adam had all authority on the face of the Earth he was speaking from the land of his birth that was the language of his birth [Music] [Applause] a tree brought his view Adam could just move that tree out of the way a tree Too Tall Adam could just say that you to come down he was an amateur God on the face of the Earth that was the language his last spoke the language of a Son of God born from the Throne of God born from the back part of God's mind [Applause] but the devil didn't like that and he got jealous and he went in there you know the story and cut them to sin and in that introduced another nature another nature you may be seated [Applause] brother Brown said God is trying to condition his children condition them by finding a way into their hearts I could read you the quote but take it from him but Venom said that condition is children to work will get into their hearts and when they can get into their hearts then he can make them do on the face of this Earth here what he brought them to the Earth to do because there's a nature in there you can't do anything but live by what your nature dictates how many times many of us pride ourselves that's me that's just who I am that's my nature well where's that nature from the land of which bar is he talking from we get so proud that's my nature that's how we are my family we just like to say it straight well that's fine but what land of your back is that nature speaking from from The Book of Life or from the Lamb's Book of Life it cannot be both ways can somebody say hallelujah [Applause] thank you Peter you may be seated Adam walked through the garden he had only one land that he come from the land from the back part of elohim's mind they learned from The Book of Life and so he lived a life from the lambsical Redemption he was the book of redemption manifested he was the manifested Lambs of redemption walking up and down the earth a Son of God on the face of the Earth and Adam come on you Brothers come on you husbands but the problem said Adam recognize that Eve was the weaker vessel so he dealt with that according to knowledge recognition was a weaker vessel a woman for a thousand times I think the Bible says a thousand times before a man falls one time so how do you square up to your wife every time she misbehaves like that she's weaker than you a thousand times can I get any can I get witness back can I get a witness back oh don't be quiet on me can I get a witness back I don't want these young men and women who don't know what their husband and wife relationship looks like to be talking I want those of you who know to give me a witness back I can hear you no you're a little too quiet this is Sunday morning I cannot hear you amen amen Brothers to you glory you maybe see that just talking to you or you maybe see that the language of Adam's birth from the land of his birth God could look at Adam and say how over here are we the Angels who look at Adam how are here we this man speaking the language of the land we know brother Venom said Adam he anointed Eve with his word image Spirit Adam was loving he was kind he was sweet that's how Adam rode his home in there you have enough strictness in there you have not known nonsense but it was covered up with the spirit of sweetness loving kindness and tenderness that's how Adam Road is home the language of his birth can you say Amen [Applause] [Music] Ambassador doing he anointed Eve with his own word image spirit that's how it became like Adam little by little by little by little because Adam was leaving the line his life was the language of his bath the lion was born from him and then the devil didn't like that too much there was jealousy jealous of you right now you think that me I'm so useless nothing happened to me but I don't even know whether this Christianity is working for me or not I I get that I get it I get it he's not working for you I get it I get it but let's just talk I just let's just come together and let's come let's come to God said uh come and let us reason together the reason is not so useless anyway it's useless when it's risen against God's word even God is inviting you to come and reason with him so let's reason together I'm just about ready to give up this Christian race it's not working for me at all and all that so I can be like the boys can't be like the girls I can't be like this one here I can do this I can't do that here anytime each other they always condemning you I can't get it on your neck I understand I get that I get that the devil is jealous of you in your similarly frustrated condition is jealous but you are sitting there what mean at this what's going on here I don't know what all this means I don't understand this here I don't even understand this message like a bondage for me I don't understand this here can't be like everybody else can be like the children can be like other people can be like this yeah not be like that I don't understand this here I get that I get it you may be seen it [Applause] let us have a conversation on the world [Applause] so the devil was jealous of Adam and Eve and watch what he said watch what he did he got in there and you know the story he talked to Eve and all that stuff and and he told her you can't be happy this way you cannot be happy he said as God said sure I'm gonna say I'm a very wonderful garden one can you see all so beautiful and everything oh yeah it's so beautiful I mean we just have everything we need here and whatever whatever we can just check it out our resources never run dry the pile of meal never fails and God takes care of us we don't have a whole lot but God takes care of us we are just coming and fine then we say oh yeah you think you believe your testimony he doesn't he does not he doesn't believe anything you say the devil doesn't believe anything you say and when the devil doesn't mean your testimony many of us will get shaken is our testimony really true is it really true he's got really real because the boys in school don't see why you should leave the way you live and the girls who don't say why should lead the way you live you start doubting your testimony is it the right way to live why can't I be like everybody else what can I do what they are doing they are Christians who anyway and what does it matter that brother Commander said yesterday all our girls trying to go the way of the world in their dressing there's towels in there where they look and you take a look at them you're not sure whether they're Christians or not because it's in my soul it wasn't me on the outside no a joyful heart makes a merry continent most on the inside shows on the outside as a matter of fact whatever is on the outside is because on the inside that's right let me leave that alone let me see that so the devil got inspired to talk to Eve that's how the devil gets to you too he said to talk to Eve chair to have a conversation with her try to talk to her that she got a language that she'll understand he said everything is fine and down here oh yeah it's God can everything be fine you can do everything here sure I've never looked around oh yeah and God even shall they say they said what what what did God say and he said we can take everything but that one exactly that one he said should not take that's where the Secret Lives the one he doesn't want you to take that's the one he is keeping that from you for a reason sometimes from a reason you know friends the devil knows you and I he doesn't know us on the inside he sees us on the outside and she's our complaints he sees everything that we say we Grumble like this he has all that and so the devil specializes as he did with Eve that one single Eve had everything by her own testimony the only thing God kept away from her the only thing documentary from her for her own protection that was the thing the devil singled out the one thing God kept away the devil told her you can be happy not having access to this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and with time Eve brought that story when you the devil is telling you those things here it's not just telling you he wants to get into your soul he wants to introduce another nature in there and once he introduce the other nature there he told Eve what's God talking about so you should wait wait for what I can show you right now how to bring life into the world I can show you right now how to be like God that's what God gave us everything I'll show you a faster way to get the promises done and according to us so condition her mind condition her twisted and conditioned her God in high emotions and once he did that the devil had her and the deal was done and came forth and showed a husband and Abel came forth and that's why another nature was introduced the two lands were introduced the land of the Lamb's Book of redemption and the land of The Book of Life and every man from Adam and Eve Cain and Abel had a book of life the land of the about a book of human nature every single thing that you did on the face of these are there everything is recorded everything is recorded recorded and you live right out of that book you live right out of that land every man every woman boy and girl live right out of that land of human nature the way we are conditioning our hearts that's how we are born we will spawn and shaping iniquity we're coming to this world speaking lies Amen in my flesh that lies no one good thing what I would I would not when I would do right evil is present that's the land of our birth that's the Book of Life your book of natural life is written in there I mean there every act that you did is written there that's a natural birth but thank God thank God that's not the end of the story there's another story there's another side to the story there's another ending to the story there's another birth to take us back that's right brother now well we're truly born from and God was looking before the function of the world this all happened a split second time God first mention of God look upon the Earth this land of natural birth and so who is wanting to get out of that land who is wanting to stay there if God were to look on our actions not a single one of us will he pick but God looked upon their heart God looked upon our hearts look upon the design I had what do they want in there what do they want in there if God was look upon our falling up and rising up and falling and falling he was look upon our fornication our filthiness our sins he will not take a single one of us but no he not look upon our upon our bodies Upon Our flesh you look upon our hearts because God doesn't judge from the bodies are from the flesh from the outside he judges from the heart so God look in our hearts and look for that desire and that brings us right back to the dear Pentecost these guys were confused they have the apostles the 2120 in the upper room speaking the language of their birth just like you are hearing your own life today speaking the language of your birth amen that anger the bitterness the filthiness the fornication the secret sucking name it put it there even all the classy sins the anger the impatience the language of our birth and God is not telling you stop that stop that stop that because for the foundation of the world that's not what he looked for he did not look for who was topping that stopping that stopping that no he looked for who had the desire foreign of that natural path into the land of the spiritual path amen amen Oh by far knowledge he chose them by far knowledge he elected them and stand their names in The Book of Life and by foreknowledge he spread them he spread them with a precious blood of Jesus Christ but with their Sanctified and that precious blood of Jesus Christ is their repellent against anything the devil will throw at them and without repellent on them he established them now predestinated them to be conformed to the image of his son oh Hallelujah [Applause] Oh Glory [Applause] you maybe see that so here we are we believe we are God's sons and others and if we are not we'll get you in a minute here we are amen God's grace is upon us and we're God's sons and the others and we believe our names have been transferred from The Book of Life into the Promised Book of Life and we have been born from the alarm but you're not really born from Islam's alive until you are baptized to the Holy Ghost on Fire the person of the Holy Ghost your election in the Lamb's Book of Life and too many of us are comfortable without the baptism of the Holy Ghost too many of us so we end up living as though today we are in the lamps in The Book of Life tomorrow when the Lambs you got life then tomorrow when they'll book a life when the alarms look alive we're just us to and Flow by every single win of Doctrine but not anymore not anymore you are either in the Book of Life or in the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] oh Hallelujah [Applause] you may be seated let me tell you what's been going on the language of your life it's a lived voice it's in your heart it's in your soul your heart is your soul is what they call the subconscious some call it the unconscious it's your soul that is subconscious being the inner man the man on the inside the man that comes from another land foreign said what I would I would not who is that man speaking the man here or the man on the inside it was the man here he wouldn't complain but the man on the inside is wondering this man on the outside is just doing what I don't want to do I don't want to live like that how many ever feel that way I don't want to live like that oh yes we all do the way I feel that way many times I don't want to live like that oh Hallelujah we come from God we say that so many times don't we we come from God and we're going back to God again so the language of our birth should speak the language they quit from heaven brother Branham said we have to wear two for being one on the other to die one from Heaven to live we live our lives on Earth here like they do up in heaven but how many of us actually live like that we're waiting for the Dynamics to come no the Dynamics only manifest you to the world as a son and daughter of God that come from the back side of the beginning the Dynamics doesn't make you a son the dynamic manifest you to the wall as a son can you say Amen Oh Glory to God Amen oh brother so here we are like all those people on the deal Pentacles they were confused and you might be confused today you might be confused today what's wrong with me why can't I have the victory in my life that I want I come for convention after convention but the community about the Isley Brothers Redemption and I believe that but are no ones that go out I'm going to go the same route again that's been your experience that's been your testimony and I know you can relate I know many can relate Bishops can relate pastors currently ministers can relate not about young people wives and fathers and mothers can relate husbands can relate we all can relate that's why Paul said who shall deliver me body of this death I'm tired of myself so many times I'm tired of myself in your Quiet Moments you talk to yourself but in your quiet moment you are speaking to yourself you are like the prodigal son he drifted away drifted away because I told his father I can't take it anymore the controlling this house is too much too much control me I'm an adult now father get you got to know I am an adult now I'm not that little boy anymore too much control here well the control he was going away from me in the father's house where there was a lot of loving compassion and kindness and tenderness he had to go and he wasted all his living he didn't work for that living it didn't work for when you don't work for you don't value it easy come easy go he wasted all his living on rioters leaving wine women and song now when he came to himself he found out the control I was running from my father's house that's just what I have here I am with pigs and swines and I have a boss he doesn't even care whether I've eaten or not eaten in my father's house they they have control but they have a lot of loving kindness and compassion In My Father's House who was he talking to he was talking to himself the Bible said he came to himself he said within himself he spoke to himself are you speaking to yourself this morning are you speaking to yourself this morning I cannot go on like this anymore [Applause] you may be seated a few minutes I'll be done you maybe see that [Applause] lawyer took me out of Egypt now Lord take Egypt out of me when I'm tired everybody thinks I'm such a wonderful Christian but you know like the party guys I'm speaking to myself you know me inside my heart of hearts this language of my brother I'm hearing I'm still I'm hearing my life speak I'm confused those guys in those uh brethren in in on the geopentecost the Mesopotamians and Julians they were confused they were missed though I doubt maybe many of you are in doubt this morning well it is the right this is wrong this is right I'm not even sure no more your son is crying out please don't everybody jump for joy what does it do good doesn't mean I jump for joy and I go back the same day rose with me again after one or two days all my jump for joy is gone and the Seven Devils beat me black and blue again what does it profit me I don't want that I want something real I want something something genuine I want something that's gonna last me forever I want an experience that's going to stay with me that's what I'll stay there and I'm not going to get away from an experience that's not going to get away from him Jesus got a hold of my life won't let me go that's what I want this meeting is here can somebody shut Hallelujah and that's what you are gonna get this morning that's what you are gonna get I prophesy in the name of the Lord that's what you are gonna get [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so they said we are confused we don't know what to do we are amazed we are confused this language of our birth we're confused I've been saved that's one group or I am not saved your case is very easy I am saved you have the language of my birth is speaking something different from the language of a path of a real son of God that's another group and there's also a third group baptize the Holy Ghost and a little while you will enjoy the experience of a Victorious Life and then your father is getting away but you are confused I'm going to ask you many people are here this morning in either of any one of those three groups either you're not saved or you are saying we don't have the Holy Ghost or you are safe have the Holy Ghost and you just feel the language of your breath is not speaking the language of the birth from the back of the Bible the Lambs of God Redemption Oh Glory if somebody with me this morning is somebody with me this morning Oh Glory Oh Glory you may be sitting let me real quick mother Brown here Glory amen you know what's going on I'll read you the queen I mean what was going on that little that little button when God saw when God took a look on this Earth here he didn't see you living and marching victoriously that's how he chose you know he saw in your heart on the inside of you a desire a desire let me talk about yourself for a minute what they desire you desire to live right sure I say yeah it's true every single wrong act you do is starts the same way a desire in your heart he tells the young man see your friends how they have the girls with them what does it feel like to have a girl and before comes in your heart what would you like to touch that girl excuse me in a certain way what does he feel like that's how he starts that's how it starts and you'll build it up in your heart that will feel good and you look for friends who have experienced that or you go and read books where they talk about how to experience that you know that's what happens and while you are doing that you know I should not be doing this but you just lack the power to stop doing it the part will say no no I will not do it you cut it off you just like the power I'm the devil Whispers in your ear and say this Christianity thing it really works doesn't it it doesn't work now you are in doubt like they were on the day of Pentecost they were in doubt they were amazed they were confused this Malachi fourth thing this gospel thing this Christianity thing this message thing they were confused but hold that desire you don't have that desire we can help you this morning but that his eyes there that's what God looked on and God's looking on again the holy spirit is brooding over here and looking for who has that desire who had that desire that desire is what's crying out what minute this that is what's crying out who shall deliver me from the body of his death that desires was crying out if you don't understand what's going on that desire willing to frustration doubting we're into giving up I can't take it anymore I'll leave it up it doesn't work and you get back you're like a woman who is pregnant who has another life on the inside but just like you have another life on the inside of you the man is pregnant or just when she's pregnant she found that she eats a normal portion of meal and she feels like eating another person again what's wrong with me if she doesn't understand she feels like I'm watching I just became a gluten gluten I just eat all the time but if you understand shows another life is calling for it that desire for another bottle of milk or whatever other barrel of meal or bowl of meal is another life calling for it and that's what your desire that design your hand is another life on the inside trying to break out trying to break out of his cocoon the life that's gonna speak really speak the language of your past from the promised book of redemption and the devil is going to see you is going to make way for Liberty before adoption time it's going to make way for Liberty not an adoption before adoption time right here beginning today [Applause] because that's still on the inside of you is the seed that God saw they desire got saw and got elected and spread it with the principle of Jesus Christ and their life just needs to come out and is repellent not this flesh here that life has been spread with the precious blood of Jesus Christ the repellent of predestination never attend the first place if you never did the first place how come you are doing it now and the Bible said I didn't do it sin that dwells in me did it I didn't do it so let's put sin in his place once and for all can you say Amen let's put sin in its place once and for all is not God's kingdom it's not the land of your birth from God's kingdom where you live today on top of the mountain down the Valley tomorrow you are living in both walls that's not God's Kingdom [Music] he can deliver from fornication cigarette smoking adultery is it too too powerless he cannot do all that is God bigger than all your problems is it bigger than anything that can be thrown across your path oh let's prove that God this morning he's a real God he's in him oh yes he is oh yes he is [Applause] let me do a few questions from the Panama in our clothes I understand my point here our story here I'm morale here where you're sitting right here this morning don't be confused that that thing crying like they did on the opinion one minute this is a seed on the inside that all the life like the other life in the in the belly of the mother who is crying out for something who is crying out for some vitamins that other love wants to Break Forth wants to grow out and this life on the inside of you has been sprayed with the repellent of predestination nothing's going to touch her nothing can harm her [Music] nothing can harm you we are too afraid and when you afraid the devil looms larger nothing can harm you [Applause] nothing can harm you we can bring every sick present here and they shall be healed nothing can harm you we'll lay hands on the sick they shall recover nothing can harm you the repellent of predestination is over you the devil can tag Us in on you let's listen to brother Branham you remember seeing it but I'm sitting here it's been about these repellent open destination now when the war Lane that cannot be fixed God's spirit move upon his seat that was predestinated and gospel is moving upon you will see that's designated this morning he translated and transformed Isaiah 96 of its promise he God was made in human flesh to save that time when man was made in the image of God here comes God by the prophet for seeing it now remember the prophet saw it just the same Prophet that sin in his last days in these last days amen religious program that same prophet Isaiah 9 6 said and was a childish Pawn towards his son is given and his name Shall be Called counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his Reign there shall be no end and thou word is God's word and the spirit moved upon that world and informing the womb of a virgin amen his son is born not created born Satan tried and tried again to spread what's going on to you is that when The Sinner is trying to spray you pray you pray you with his negative with his unbelief with his evil leaving trying to spray you with that you never did in the first place it cannot take on you you do those things because you don't recognize who you are he whispers you that it can work and you abide and believe it sinan took him up and said he did it to Jesus he tried to spray him he took him up and said if what you say are what you say you are if you are what you say you are then do some of this heal him here for me show me how you can do it turn this bread and these turns into bread let's see you take a dive because scribble says that you'll do it you see them reach us Devils they're still saying the same thing if there's such a thing as Divine Healing they're less brother so and so let's see you heal him amen that same devil stood at Jesus At The Cross and say if thou be the Son of God come down of the cross the word said he was the Son of God the spirit probably was the son of God is fulfilled and the other night many of you in the broadcast heard how that we give City summon all scriptures almost I believe they are proving that the scripture said that he was the son of God oh sit and tried and tried again to do everything one night laying on the back of his ship he had seen him asleep and he said I'll destroy him right now but he couldn't do it he tried to attempt me into doing the wrong thing like he tries many times to attempt to doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it so why does he succeed with you why he had been spread that Jesus with a repellent of predestination because when God saw you a desire he grabbed that desire your heart he grabbed it and spread that with the precious blood of Jesus Christ and send you to this world here and only waiting for that heart to break out to break out and thou have nothing shall harm it nothing will stand in his way no sin no field nobody is nine years old nothing year old 90 years old that life is going to live victorious victorious every single day oh Hallelujah it cannot be deceived all this crazy dwelled heresies damnable doctrines cannot touch her glory to God Amen the watch said he would be here there ain't no devil to bother him in order Son of God that's prisoner to take his place and nobody's gonna take your place either oh Hallelujah he spread with the repellent Satan's poison denominational doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing is going to bother him see he didn't have any effect on him oh brother Branham Florida call him man oh man he has a personal seed and that personality is on your inside this morning that's the seed that comes from the land of the Lambs because Lamb's Book of redemption and that series on the inside breaking forward trying to break forth trying to break forth crying out one minute this didn't try to spread amen Glory here's the president another quote here bringing for the Emmanuel God With Us should I try to spread like he did Eve he tried to spread but he failed and so far here because I was praying with every negative every filthiness here you still are hey you still house hanging on hanging in there because something on the inside of you saying to hold on telling you there's a way out Oh Glory amen he was God's predestinated spoken word Satan couldn't throw his unbelief on him he had a reparent on him God pray us with your repellent is my prayer oh my God brother Branham here piano playing something softly

The Book of Life is the works of the flesh lost adultery Galatians 5 you know 20 to 22 I mean 17 to 22. filthiness ungodliness all that the life anger whatever name it is that why your life is speaking all your life is speaking the life from the Lamb's Book of redemption love peace gentleness goodness meekness against such there is no law Oh Glory is your life speaking them seven Living Voices Glory one minute is what it means this is what it means Oh Glory to God Amen what it means this morning is a call going out to exchange the life from The Book of Life to exchange for the life from the Lamb's Book of redemption and it doesn't take a whole year to do it it happens right here now it's an exchange one is going in one is going out it's an exchange how many will lock that exchange this morning how many would love that exchange this morning oh so your language of your birth can really speak from the land of your path Oh Glory to God amen Amen brother panel said here now listen I want to talk to you while they're coming have faith if you I've never received Jesus Christ here's your chance the prescription one minute this um Peter went through all that preaching to answer that question to bring up in their heart a thirst for repentance that's all we need to do wherever you are at today if you haven't received Jesus Christ or you have received Jesus Christ and you have you are you don't have the Holy Ghost repent if you have the Holy Ghost and you just found out you are not having the victory there's something wrong repent every one of you repent that's where the Christian Gospel starts from that's where the exchange starts from exchanging the life of the book of redemption and getting out of the life in the Lambs I mean getting the life from the convention and exchange for the Lamb's Book on life oh repent if you never know Jesus Christ repent if you know Jesus Christ of the Holy Ghost if you have the battle of the Holy Ghost and you still find you are shaky exactly the point I'm making because after the battle of the Holy Ghost you are predestinated unto the adoption there are still seven birth pains to grow up into the attacher of a perfect man Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah glory to God Amen amen you exchange the Life in The Book of Life which comes by natural birth for the previous needed life in the Lamb's Book of Life which comes by spiritual bath amen but the problem said here now listen I want to talk to you why they're coming have faith you come up here he that will confess me before men he will not comfort from my father now you confess what you are now you confess what what where you are how you've neglected God you confess them as wrong and say that I'm sorry God that I did that I'm sorry find favor with God then watch what he will do for you that you were wrong and it will take care of the rest of it this is not to condemn you this will catch you free just confess you're wrong and we'll take care of the
