[44:38] and verse 1.
[44:39] it says now in the first year of Cyrus
[44:43] King of Persia
[44:45] the word of the Lord by the mouth of
[44:47] Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[44:50] the Lord stood up the spirit
[44:53] of Cyrus King of Persia
[44:56] that made a proclamation throughout all
[44:58] his kingdom
[44:59] and put it also in writing
[45:02] so if you miss the proclamation
[45:04] it was also in writing
[45:06] saying thus say it King Osiris King of
[45:10] Persia
[45:11] the Lord God Of Heaven had given me all
[45:14] the kingdoms of the Earth
[45:16] and he have charged me to build him and
[45:20] house

[45:27] people
[45:28] his God be with him and let him go up to
[45:32] Jerusalem

[46:02] brought your word to us in this
[46:04] generation Lord

[46:23] that you have your way and just move in
[46:26] whatever way you choose father we just
[46:28] want to hide ourselves in the for the
[46:30] rock now Lord and Lord I just want to

[46:34] moments Lord that you may take charge of
[46:36] this service Lord

[46:40] need a blessing strengthen those who
[46:42] need strength Lord encourage those who
[46:44] need encouragement Lord father Lord may

[46:48] morning
[46:49] and be careful to give you all the
[46:50] praise on and glory Lord As you move
[46:53] with us Lord father granted almighty God
[46:55] we pray and ask in Jesus name amen you
[46:59] may have your seats praise God
[47:03] amen
[47:11] amen praise the name of the Lord
[47:14] so we're happy to be in the house alone
[47:16] and we
[47:17] feel his show feel his presence amen
[47:20] amen well I have a title this morning
[47:23] my title is
[47:25] when God stirs
[47:28] that's my title this morning
[47:31] when God stirs
[47:36] God does the steering
[47:39] it's not man that stirs but
[47:42] when God stirs
[47:44] there's a difference
[47:46] when he steers
[47:49] when man tried to make things happen
[47:51] they make mistakes
[47:53] they trip over themselves
[47:55] they cause confusion
[47:57] because we are in a fallen condition
[48:00] and even though our intentions are good
[48:04] when we try to do it in our own strength
[48:08] it always comes out a certain way
[48:10] it comes out biased
[48:13] it comes out maybe one-sided because we
[48:16] can't see all of the picture
[48:19] and no one of us is just that good
[48:23] but God is good
[48:26] all by himself
[48:28] and when he begins to do the stirring
[48:31] it comes out perfect in the end
[48:34] because it's his work
[48:37] isn't that right
[48:39] every work is a reflection of the
[48:42] Craftsman behind it
[48:45] every work that is produced
[48:47] is a reflection of the Craftsman that is
[48:50] behind that work
[48:52] so if you do something you will do it
[48:55] according to your standards if I do
[48:58] something I will do it according to my
[49:00] standards or my level of perfection but
[49:04] when God does something
[49:06] he does it to his level
[49:08] of Perfections and we know that there's
[49:11] nothing more perfect than God is this
[49:14] morning
[49:15] so if you are in his hands you can't
[49:18] help but come out perfect
[49:21] David said that the Lord will perfect
[49:24] that which concerned me and if you are
[49:28] in God's hands this morning then you in
[49:31] the right hands then God can't help but
[49:34] pour into you his talent his efforts his
[49:39] ability all that was in God he poured
[49:43] into Christ and all that was in Christ
[49:46] is going to be poured into the church in
[49:50] the last days there's going to be a
[49:53] Ministry of perfection that caught
[49:57] himself will produce in the last days or
[50:01] can we say Amen this morning
[50:03] oh oh hallelujah hallelujah oh do you
[50:08] trust your leader this morning Your
[50:10] Leader is not a man that he would lie
[50:13] but your leader is the Holy Ghost Your
[50:17] Leader is Jesus
[50:20] a five-star general the captain of our
[50:24] Salvation he knows no retreat he knows
[50:28] no surrender for whatever
[50:31] could never he never lost a battle oh
[50:36] he's got straps this morning he was
[50:39] bruised for our iniquities the
[50:41] chastisement of his peace is upon us and
[50:45] by his stripes we are here oh can we say
[50:50] Amen this morning
[50:51] Hallelujah
[50:53] oh man
[50:56] amen so so let's get into this text here
[51:01] so this Ezra verse 1 here is a uh is
[51:05] actually happening
[51:06] according to prophecy
[51:08] it's not right
[51:10] this prophecy was spoken by Jeremiah the
[51:13] prophet concerning Babylon
[51:15] and the children of Israel being down
[51:17] there for a space of 70 years
[51:20] is that right
[51:22] let's read Jeremiah 25.
[51:24] let's see what the Lord says here
[51:26] Jeremiah 25 11-12 here
[51:28] and this whole land shall be a
[51:31] desolation
[51:33] and an astonishment and these nations
[51:36] Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years
[51:40] and it shall come to pass prophecy now
[51:44] that when 70 years are accomplished
[51:47] that I will punish the king of Babylon
[51:51] and that Nation saith the Lord for their
[51:55] iniquity
[51:56] and the land of the Chaldeans and will
[52:00] make it a perpetual desolations
[52:03] Jeremiah 29 is read here again he says
[52:05] for thus say the Lord will stand
[52:07] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[52:12] Babylon
[52:13] I will visit you
[52:15] and perform my good word toward you
[52:18] in causing you to return to this place
[52:23] for he said for I know the thoughts
[52:26] that I think towards you
[52:29] say the Lord
[52:30] thoughts of Peace are not of evil to
[52:34] bring you to give you an expected end oh
[52:38] Hallelujah God knows the thoughts this
[52:40] morning
[52:41] that he thinks towards you oh he wants
[52:44] to pull you into himself
[52:46] he wants to gather you back together
[52:48] though you'll be lost and Scattered oh
[52:51] Holly but you will always remain in that
[52:53] condition God's thoughts towards you
[52:55] this morning are thoughts of restoration
[52:58] are thoughts that give you strength in
[53:01] your weakness to give you power
[53:03] Hallelujah in your insufficiencies to
[53:07] give you healing from all your diseases
[53:09] oh God is here this morning and his
[53:13] thoughts towards you are perfect oh he
[53:16] is going to perfect that which concerns
[53:19] you this morning don't you be worried
[53:21] don't you be afraid God is in control of
[53:25] your life he is Lord over everything to
[53:30] some people he's just a Healer to some
[53:32] people he's just a deliverer but many
[53:35] but few people can truly call him Lord
[53:38] but I pray this morning that after the
[53:41] end of this service you'll be able to
[53:44] call him Lord over your life Lord over
[53:48] your household Lord over your wife over
[53:51] your husband over your Affairs over your
[53:54] assets over your everything oh may he be
[53:58] Lord this morning oh hallelujah
[54:00] hallelujah glory to God Amen
[54:04] amen is not right
[54:07] glory to God
[54:10] oh Hallelujah and now so there's a
[54:12] pattern
[54:14] with when God stirs okay
[54:16] now watch this real quick
[54:19] now
[54:20] so that prophecy might be fulfilled God
[54:22] began to stir up the heart of King Cyrus
[54:25] to bring his will to pass right
[54:28] and God will move things around
[54:31] as soon as he is ready to bring his word
[54:34] to pass
[54:36] his promised word
[54:37] in your life anytime God is ready
[54:41] to to do something Supernatural
[54:45] something that you cannot do within
[54:47] yourself

[54:51] circumstance in such a way that it would
[54:54] take God

[1:05:15] your school mystery on your job a
[1:05:18] mystery amongst your family but you was
[1:05:21] called mystery that's why they couldn't
[1:05:23] figure it out God hides his wisdom from
[1:05:27] the wise and the prudence and revealed
[1:05:30] little babes such as would learn God
[1:05:33] knew you'd have the heart of a child to
[1:05:36] look unto Jesus and forget about your
[1:05:38] God manly knowledge and forget about
[1:05:40] education and wisdom and say Lord you

[1:06:26] overshadow you
[1:06:28] foreign

[1:06:41] off
[1:06:43] the time God
[1:06:44] and a lot of times things get in a
[1:06:46] falling condition
[1:06:48] in the Bible you see it repeatedly
[1:06:50] things come into our planet backslidden
[1:06:52] condition
[1:06:53] and it moves into such a state
[1:06:56] that God begins to stir
[1:06:59] God says enough is enough
[1:07:01] time up on confusion
[1:07:04] time up on Darkness time up on on
[1:07:07] ignorance
[1:07:08] time up on the work of the enemy God
[1:07:11] begins to stir
[1:07:13] God begins to stir things up so that he
[1:07:15] could bring it back to the plum line
[1:07:18] bring it back to the word bring it back
[1:07:21] to Holiness bring it back to Purity
[1:07:23] bring it back to his Divine Law oh isn't
[1:07:27] that right
[1:07:28] hey
[1:07:31] bring him back I do the work of
[1:07:33] restoration
[1:07:35] to bring it back and when he begins this
[1:07:36] book of restoration
[1:07:38] it usually starts with a stirring
[1:07:42] isn't that right Ezra 1 and verse five
[1:07:44] we didn't read this but I'll read it
[1:07:45] then rose up the chief of the fathers of
[1:07:48] Judah
[1:07:49] and Benjamin and the priests and the
[1:07:53] Levites with all them whose Spirit God
[1:07:57] had raised
[1:07:58] up to go up to build the house of the
[1:08:01] Lord which is in Jerusalem
[1:08:05] so God started to stood the car to the
[1:08:07] King's house and he also started to
[1:08:09] still the hearts of the people who was
[1:08:12] going to go back and rebuild this Temple
[1:08:14] in Jerusalem isn't that right and as I
[1:08:18] was studying this word uh of course I
[1:08:21] was thinking about my son
[1:08:22] because it's the book of Ezra
[1:08:24] but the inspiration for his name
[1:08:27] I was thinking about how God was going
[1:08:30] to rebuild not this physical Temple
[1:08:33] we're talking about but just like the
[1:08:35] prophet said rebuild the church in the
[1:08:38] power of the spirit there's going to
[1:08:41] come a generation that is going to
[1:08:44] witness this rebuilding of the power of
[1:08:47] the spirit that's going to witness this
[1:08:50] rebuilding of a church a church without
[1:08:52] spots a church in our wrinkled washed in
[1:08:56] the blood of a lamb a church with Jesus
[1:08:59] walking in it a church of perfection a
[1:09:04] church oh hallelujah hallelujah glorious
[1:09:07] walking and Marching In step that's the
[1:09:10] kind of church Jesus is coming for
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:13] in the last days and I don't think God
[1:09:16] raised us up here by chance but I
[1:09:19] believe every one of us only is called
[1:09:22] to make a church
[1:09:23] that will make a Revival oh hallelujah
[1:09:27] hallelujah people are complaining saying

[1:11:09] this is what the Lord has here in store
[1:11:12] um for a long time

[1:11:17] state of distillment

[1:15:18] worship
[1:15:19] you have to come up them stairs and know
[1:15:22] that the Lord he is God
[1:15:24] it is he that had made us and not we
[1:15:28] ourselves we are not making ourselves
[1:15:30] this morning this is not a Frankenstein
[1:15:33] shop this is not a mad scientist
[1:15:35] laboratory we're not trying to make

[1:15:48] that is building this statue of a
[1:15:50] perfect man and when this tattoo is
[1:15:53] completed this will be the servant of
[1:15:55] God oh that goes into the Rapture God is
[1:15:59] doing the building therefore God is
[1:16:02] doing the choosing he choose your trial
[1:16:05] he choose your tests he choose your
[1:16:08] persecution he choose everything you
[1:16:10] went through he allowed this to happen
[1:16:13] he allowed that to happen for his glory
[1:16:17] so that he could get the glory out of
[1:16:20] your life story I'm so happy that
[1:16:24] millions of lost when I was saved he
[1:16:28] saved you plucked you out of the enemy's

[1:16:36] believe it this morning

[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:46] still is a verb it's a commotion
[1:16:50] trouble
[1:16:51] somebody out of the ordinary something
[1:16:53] unexpected
[1:16:55] that God does
[1:16:57] when he's getting ready to do his thing
[1:16:59] because his thing is unexpected
[1:17:02] if it was expected we would act
[1:17:04] differently
[1:17:05] What If Abraham knew that his son was
[1:17:08] going to come for 25 years later
[1:17:10] he would have done what he wanted things
[1:17:12] it would go come in 25 years then he set
[1:17:15] our reminder in a spoon
[1:17:17] and about a week before
[1:17:19] you wake up reminder hey welcome in 25
[1:17:21] years okay good right and then he'll
[1:17:24] start to get his act together
[1:17:26] that's us I mean
[1:17:28] let's let's be real now
[1:17:30] we we know ourselves
[1:17:34] but God doesn't allow it to be like that
[1:17:37] he he purposefully withholds information
[1:17:39] from you
[1:17:41] so that he could keep you in a always in
[1:17:44] a state of readiness
[1:17:46] all is in a state of
[1:17:48] dependency
[1:17:50] imagine an expectation
[1:17:52] looking to see God fulfill what he said
[1:17:56] because all we have is what he said
[1:17:59] we don't have our own ideas we don't
[1:18:01] have our own opinions and God's word is
[1:18:04] of no private interpretation so we're
[1:18:07] not going to sit around a corner and say
[1:18:09] I think I know what God Said praise God
[1:18:11] you'll end up off the roadside on site
[1:18:14] somewhere that's right isn't that right
[1:18:15] off to one extreme praise God you end up
[1:18:18] crazy fanatical maybe or you end up in
[1:18:21] the world somewhere but you gotta stay
[1:18:22] down the middle of the road and be
[1:18:25] realistic oh hallelujah hallelujah plan
[1:18:28] for the next 25 years but live like he's
[1:18:30] coming tomorrow oh Hallelujah and stay
[1:18:32] on the firing line oh look in to see if
[1:18:36] he don't come today he'll come tomorrow
[1:18:37] and if you don't come tomorrow he'll
[1:18:39] come the next day but while I'm here I'm
[1:18:42] building I'm building a show quick
[1:18:44] message shake the whole nation it's
[1:18:46] coming soon but while we're here we're
[1:18:49] just playing a foundation so that he can
[1:18:51] come upon it
[1:18:53] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:56] pound the foundation of your faith amen
[1:18:59] he'll do a great work he's not right oh
[1:19:00] man
[1:19:02] so this is it now see this is what it
[1:19:05] means it means a trouble to perturb the
[1:19:07] cause of disturbance
[1:19:09] when we think about Genesis in the
[1:19:11] beginning when God stood
[1:19:13] or when he brewed it over the Earth over
[1:19:15] the waters didn't I
[1:19:17] Genesis 1 2 said the Earth was without
[1:19:19] form and void and darkness upon the face
[1:19:23] of the deep and the spirit of God begin
[1:19:27] to move upon the face of the waters
[1:19:29] that's what the Bible says I wasn't
[1:19:32] there but I take what the word says the
[1:19:34] face of God began to move upon the
[1:19:37] troubled waters we couldn't see the
[1:19:39] waters but God knows where the waters
[1:19:41] are this morning God knows where your
[1:19:44] trouble is this morning God knows where
[1:19:46] your mistake is your heartache is this
[1:19:49] morning he knows your situation he knows
[1:19:52] your condition and God I pray that God
[1:19:55] caused his face to shine upon you this
[1:19:59] morning in spite of your condition in
[1:20:02] spite of your situation I know a God who
[1:20:06] is able to move upon the face of the
[1:20:09] waters oh oh Hallelujah might seem like
[1:20:12] confusion but don't you worry as long as
[1:20:16] God is on the throne he's going to work
[1:20:18] all things together for your good
[1:20:21] according to them that love God unto
[1:20:25] them who are called according to his
[1:20:28] purpose you have a purpose in God don't
[1:20:32] you ever let the devil get that out of
[1:20:34] your mind oh come hell or high water
[1:20:37] we're gonna trust him trust in his
[1:20:41] leadership trust in his hand trust in
[1:20:44] his ability to take us all away
[1:20:48] to Perfection this morning oh do you
[1:20:51] believe it
[1:20:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:55] he began to Stir It Up why because he's
[1:20:58] getting ready
[1:20:59] to bring the past his word the speaker's
[1:21:01] word isn't that right
[1:21:05] on the seat shall not be here with the
[1:21:07] shock
[1:21:08] 1965.
[1:21:10] with a paragraph 79 said he was God the
[1:21:13] logos
[1:21:14] the word that went out from God
[1:21:17] and when it began to brood upon the
[1:21:19] Earth
[1:21:20] and it brought forth marine life
[1:21:22] when the spirit of God the logos the
[1:21:24] word which God said let there be
[1:21:28] and there when the logos which is the
[1:21:31] word logos and the word isn't that right
[1:21:34] and the word began to
[1:21:36] because all this was in the logos
[1:21:39] all that that we see materialize Upon Us
[1:21:41] was in the logos
[1:21:43] waiting to be expressed but I spoke of
[1:21:46] word isn't that right
[1:21:47] it's not right the whole word of God the
[1:21:48] whole Bible for every age and the logos
[1:21:51] began to breathe upon the Earth
[1:21:54] and the prophet said there come marine
[1:21:56] life and building up he said the bird
[1:21:59] life and on up he said the animal life
[1:22:02] out of the logos come all these things
[1:22:05] all the things that we see around us was
[1:22:07] made by something that does not appear
[1:22:09] oh Hallelujah it is not right he said a
[1:22:13] prophet said and finally there comes
[1:22:15] something in the representation or that
[1:22:18] look like the things that was brewing it
[1:22:21] that was brooding over it God a man made
[1:22:25] a God made a man in the very image of
[1:22:29] God isn't that right hallelujah
[1:22:32] hallelujah so God stood he brewed and
[1:22:36] things began to happen creation began to
[1:22:38] form the son found its place the moon
[1:22:41] found its place the hills the trees the
[1:22:43] animals the birds the peas they all
[1:22:46] found their place but there was one
[1:22:48] thing left God made a man to govern all
[1:22:51] these things that he had created after
[1:22:54] he proved brood brood coming right up
[1:22:56] then came fought something that looked
[1:22:59] like the brooder that looked like the
[1:23:01] one who was baking it all the time oh he
[1:23:05] made a reflection of himself
[1:23:08] oh it's not right a man in Dominion now
[1:23:12] watch paragraph it he said and that man
[1:23:14] fell
[1:23:15] like the seed has to fall so he brings
[1:23:18] it in now it's predestinated
[1:23:20] there's like the seat had to fall and
[1:23:22] then gone began to brood over that after
[1:23:25] he had fallen the prophet said he
[1:23:28] brought up Enoch he brought up Elijah he
[1:23:31] brought up Moses he brought up Prophet
[1:23:34] after Prophet trying to restore that
[1:23:36] image again and finally upon the Earth
[1:23:40] came the genuine image of God himself
[1:23:43] again which was God the logos made flesh
[1:23:48] that dwelled Among Us now finally there
[1:23:51] came for Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:23:54] the same today the same forever after
[1:23:58] that perfect man fell in the beginning
[1:24:00] God promised to raise up another Adam
[1:24:03] and he kept brooding Prophet after
[1:24:06] prophets king after King he kept
[1:24:09] brooding until finally the Stepford one

[1:26:10] to that scene and the church

[1:34:50] everywhere approaches exactly what it
[1:34:51] promised because God has provided it he
[1:34:54] said look at the preparation when a
[1:34:56] person is getting ready to set their
[1:34:58] chickens on things he's still talking
[1:34:59] about the egg he says how they select
[1:35:01] the eggs and put them under the brooder
[1:35:04] and put them in a brooder house or
[1:35:06] whatever and how the heat is regulated
[1:35:08] and the heat has kept over that egg
[1:35:10] until it's hatched and God has so set in
[1:35:14] order
[1:35:15] that one day through all the types back
[1:35:18] through Adam through Eve all down to the
[1:35:20] prophets down through Adam he has set in
[1:35:22] order put it all in the Old Testament
[1:35:25] showing what he was going to do and then
[1:35:29] he finished it a Calvary when he sent
[1:35:32] Jesus
[1:35:34] he who was wounded for transgressions
[1:35:37] proves for all iniquities the
[1:35:39] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:35:41] and with his stripes we were here and he
[1:35:46] was finished with it at Calvary then he
[1:35:49] anointed preachers and set it out now to
[1:35:52] bring the word and to put the eggs in
[1:35:54] the right positional place and then he
[1:35:57] takes the same word and anchors it out
[1:36:00] there and then it comes and hovers over
[1:36:03] it by the Holy Ghost he said until that
[1:36:07] word comes to life in the human heart
[1:36:10] the prophet said all the Devils of Hell
[1:36:13] couldn't keep life out of it oh what is
[1:36:18] the secret the word is already in the
[1:36:20] bride and now the spirit of God is

[1:41:30] Prophet said Moses was a bit of failure
[1:41:33] it was a bit of failure but out there
[1:41:36] now we see his attention attracted to
[1:41:37] the boonin bush
[1:41:38] or when you look to the bush to find
[1:41:40] what the trouble was
[1:41:41] he walked close to it the prophet said
[1:41:43] fire usually brings an attraction
[1:41:46] oh and usually the Holy Spirit when it
[1:41:49] comes in a fire is to attract the
[1:41:51] attention of the people or may he come
[1:41:53] in a fire this morning and attract your
[1:41:56] attention turn your eyes off for the
[1:41:58] internet turn your eyes off of all
[1:42:01] distractions amen open the worldly
[1:42:03] things
[1:42:04] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and see what
[1:42:07] he's trying to call you to
[1:42:09] he said on God when Moses turned aside
[1:42:11] to consider this Burning Tree God spoke
[1:42:13] to him by a fresh Vision
[1:42:15] amen and now watch Faith take a whole
[1:42:17] quick he said the old things are passed
[1:42:19] away and now Moses has a new vision
[1:42:23] he has a revelation
[1:42:25] and he has an experience Prophet said he
[1:42:29] had met God he finally met God and he
[1:42:32] talked to God before that he had not met
[1:42:34] God he had only read and knowed about
[1:42:37] what his mother had told him and so
[1:42:39] forth by hearing what his mother had
[1:42:41] said or hearing what his Pastor said and
[1:42:43] so forth but now Moses has a personal
[1:42:45] experience oh you see how much this
[1:42:48] means now you see how much we need it
[1:42:51] amen amen young people amen all of us
[1:42:54] amen our personal experience he said
[1:42:57] that's what the church needs tonight is
[1:42:59] to stop studying so much Theology and
[1:43:02] get down to the Altar and pray until our
[1:43:06] personal experience burns down into the
[1:43:10] human heart and burns out all the
[1:43:13] dullness and give you a new vision
[1:43:17] oh no wonder the Bible said without a
[1:43:21] vision the people perish but Isaiah said
[1:43:24] lo I beheld the Lord high and lifted up
[1:43:27] his train filled the temple and the post
[1:43:30] from the pillars move by the voice of
[1:43:33] him not crying oh holy holy unto the
[1:43:37] Lord called Almighty oh The Vision
[1:43:40] Chicago
[1:43:41] he was never the same again and you need
[1:43:45] a fresh Vision this morning from the
[1:43:48] supernatural to shake you out of the
[1:43:50] natural to stir you up to get you ready
[1:43:54] for what God is fixing to pour out upon
[1:43:57] his people in these last days oh may he
[1:44:01] prepare your hearts my brother prepare
[1:44:03] your hearts my sister by the word and by
[1:44:06] a spirit for what he's fixing to do oh
[1:44:10] Lord whatever you are doing in this
[1:44:12] season
[1:44:13] don't do it without me don't do it
[1:44:15] without me this morning I heard a
[1:44:17] songwriter sing that oh what an
[1:44:19] inspiration
[1:44:22] I want to be caught up
[1:44:24] in the move of God for this time amen
[1:44:27] God began to stir when he called Samuel
[1:44:30] A young Prophet Eli was blinded couldn't
[1:44:33] see his eyes waxed him and just about
[1:44:36] that time when the fire and the temple
[1:44:39] had gone out it seemed like everything
[1:44:40] was at its lowest point no fire enough
[1:44:43] Church no fire upon the people no burden
[1:44:47] everybody lost anything just then the
[1:44:51] spirit of God began to speak so Samia
[1:44:54] just at that time when nothing seemed to
[1:44:57] move
[1:44:58] oh
[1:45:02] Hallelujah don't take it lightly the
[1:45:05] first sign of the supernatural you see
[1:45:07] you run for the hills man or it could be
[1:45:11] a cloud as small as a man's hand but
[1:45:14] don't despise that they have small
[1:45:16] things the day you hear his voice Harden
[1:45:20] not your heart this morning
[1:45:22] oh that answer the call
[1:45:25] Hallelujah
[1:45:30] Samuel Young
[1:45:32] Samuel didn't even know the voice of the
[1:45:33] Lord
[1:45:34] it sounded like the voice of a man and
[1:45:37] with the wrong teachers and men and
[1:45:38] Priests and holy men and so-called men
[1:45:42] of the cloth men who were supposed to
[1:45:44] supposed to be living an example but it
[1:45:47] was caught in all kinds of folly
[1:45:48] Hallelujah and though Samuel is in this
[1:45:51] environment God wants to call into
[1:45:53] something higher out of all of that oh
[1:45:55] Hallelujah God had a son down there God
[1:45:59] always have somebody there he could put
[1:46:01] his hand on
[1:46:03] God always have a witness that he could
[1:46:04] express his power too
[1:46:06] oh the prophet of God might be God but I
[1:46:09] believe this morning there is a
[1:46:11] generation on the earth that God will
[1:46:14] have his hands upon
[1:46:16] that he could say Lou here is my spirit
[1:46:18] go here go there praise God Amen speak
[1:46:22] my word
[1:46:23] oh thank you not strange you came all
[1:46:26] the way that you come that you come to
[1:46:28] trial come to test somehow or another
[1:46:31] God kept you all these years that is not
[1:46:35] by chance God does not make accidents he
[1:46:38] made you he formed you from in the
[1:46:40] beginning he separated you from your
[1:46:43] mother's womb he wants to put his spirit
[1:46:46] inside of you he put something in your
[1:46:49] heart for you to receive this word he
[1:46:52] put a receiver in your heart to pick up
[1:46:56] God's Wi-Fi to pick up God's real signal
[1:47:00] and when God began to speak his message
[1:47:02] it went across the Earth and Found You
[1:47:06] The Prophet never came to Trinidad but
[1:47:10] the word of God found a way to come to
[1:47:14] you
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] found everyone
[1:47:20] oh and now he's gonna bring those seats
[1:47:22] to life

[1:47:42] time kept stirring coming all the way
[1:47:44] all the way isn't that right when it's
[1:47:46] time to select a new king over Israel

[1:47:51] take this horn over here and go down to
[1:47:53] the house of Jesse and anoint a king or
[1:47:56] by Israel he didn't tell him who it was

[1:48:13] morning how to do the will of God we'll
[1:48:16] make less mistakes we'll mess up less
[1:48:19] times if we just trust and Obey him and

[1:48:35] but he's out in the fields he's turning
[1:48:38] to the sheep and his name is David
[1:48:40] Samuel said we are not sitting down
[1:48:42] tonight until Samuel makes an uh tell

[1:49:57] got to be willing to wait upon God

[1:50:23] we'll be here
[1:50:25] then I will make every effort to Beat It
[1:50:27] because I know they're waiting on me and
[1:50:30] God wants to feel that from you that
[1:50:33] commitment that you're going to wait on
[1:50:36] him that right attitude that says Lord
[1:50:38] if you're if you don't meet me you'll
[1:50:41] find my bones here at this altar but I'm
[1:50:45] willing to wait until you feel me with
[1:50:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:50:51] going back the same
[1:50:53] then God is obligated to meet you on the
[1:50:57] basis of his promised word oh because he
[1:51:00] knows that you're waiting on him
[1:51:02] amen God always keeps us promises if you
[1:51:06] keep your promise if you keep his you

[1:52:45] John to identify himself he said that he
[1:52:48] this they are sweat then I thought Elias
[1:52:51] I thought one of the prophets he said no
[1:52:53] he said they said unto him who art thou
[1:52:55] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:52:58] sent us and he said I am the voice of
[1:53:01] one crying in the wilderness make
[1:53:04] strange the way of the Lord and said the
[1:53:07] prophet desires and David will send one
[1:53:09] of the Pharisees the Bible said and they
[1:53:12] asked them they said why Baptist doubt
[1:53:13] baptize us now then if thou be not that
[1:53:16] Christ nor Elias or neither that prophet
[1:53:19] and John answered them saying I baptize
[1:53:22] with water but their stand at once among
[1:53:25] you whom you know not here it is Who
[1:53:29] coming after me is preferred before me
[1:53:32] whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to

[1:53:39] Holy Ghost and with fire John was only
[1:53:43] stirring John was only getting the
[1:53:45] people ready making the path straight
[1:53:48] prepare the way of the Lord and that's
[1:53:51] what we're doing with the word this
[1:53:53] morning prepare nowhere for the coming
[1:53:56] of the Lord he is coming this morning

[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:38] oh man
[1:54:40] stirring
[1:54:42] God stood
[1:54:44] when he sent that angel
[1:54:46] down at the pool of Bethesda
[1:54:49] Saint John 5 says after there was a
[1:54:51] feast of the Jews Jesus went up he said
[1:54:52] no there is by the Sheep Market a pool
[1:54:55] which is in Hebrew called in Hebrew
[1:54:57] Bethesda having five porches and the
[1:55:00] Bible said in these lay a great
[1:55:02] multitude of important folk of blind of
[1:55:06] Halls of withered waiting for the
[1:55:08] movement of the water oh what were they
[1:55:11] waiting on the moving of the water for
[1:55:14] an angel the Bible said went down at a
[1:55:18] certain season and went into the pool
[1:55:21] and troubled the water whosoever then
[1:55:24] first after the troubling of the water
[1:55:27] stepped in was made whole of whatsoever
[1:55:30] disease he had oh but that angel come
[1:55:34] down at a certain season in other words
[1:55:38] God knows the season when he is to come
[1:55:41] down it is not for us to know the times
[1:55:44] or the season that the father had put in
[1:55:47] his own power but what we do know know
[1:55:49] is that you shall receive power after
[1:55:52] that the Holy Ghost come upon you oh but

[1:55:59] season what has he come to do trouble
[1:56:02] the waters it's the same water it's not
[1:56:06] a new water it's the same water but the
[1:56:09] difference is the Angel it's not the
[1:56:11] water but it's the angel that is in the
[1:56:14] water that's what makes a difference and
[1:56:17] the difference is not this building it's
[1:56:19] not this group but when God comes down
[1:56:22] when that angel comes down the prophet
[1:56:26] said you know what I'm waiting on I'm
[1:56:28] waiting on the angel of the Lord then

[2:03:04] Pentecostal Baptist he said I got the
[2:03:06] Holy Ghost since I've been a Baptist he
[2:03:09] said that's right notice he said it

[2:03:13] different person a new creature in
[2:03:16] Christ Jesus all right that's what we

[2:03:21] church died out I was persecuted God
[2:03:24] Amen go look to the Dark Ages him is not
[2:03:27] right they all died out and God had to
[2:03:30] raise up another church again in the
[2:03:31] last days so he had to begin a work so
[2:03:34] what did God do he began to stir upon a
[2:03:37] priest called Martin Luther isn't that
[2:03:40] right and he taught page on the Bible

[2:04:48] stirring no no no no sir don't think we
[2:04:51] got revivals we haven't oh my they've

[2:05:35] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[2:05:38] days in order to get the bride together

[2:08:28] the spirit of God which is the word of
[2:08:31] God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:08:35] according to Ephesians 6 amen oh my the
[2:08:39] prophet said whatever they say is going
[2:08:42] to happen because it is the word of God
[2:08:45] coming forth from the mouth of God he
[2:08:48] said yeah amen God always it's his word
[2:08:52] but he always uses man to work it oh no
[2:08:56] wonder God chose you no wonder God
[2:08:58] predestinated you my brother my sister
[2:09:01] he needs man in order to work his word
[2:09:04] he says I am Divine you are the branch
[2:09:07] the banker or the branch can do nothing
[2:09:10] in itself but when it's connected to the
[2:09:12] True Vine it's gonna bring forth fruit
[2:09:16] peace and love and joy and meekness and
[2:09:20] forgiveness and low long-suffering oh
[2:09:24] all the fruits of the spirit
[2:09:27] hallelujah oh man
[2:09:31] God could have called for them flies
[2:09:33] down there in Egypt but he told Moses he
[2:09:36] said that's your job I'll tell you what
[2:09:38] to do and you go and do it he fully done
[2:09:41] that see he could have chosen the son to
[2:09:44] call them he couldn't you cause the moon
[2:09:46] to call it or the wind to call it but he
[2:09:48] said Moses he called Moses just like he
[2:09:51] called you for this hour to speak his
[2:09:54] word God's gonna have sons and daughters
[2:09:56] stepping out of the pages of the Bible
[2:09:58] to speak his word oh that's you my
[2:10:02] Christian friend that is you my brother
[2:10:03] that is you my sister God's getting
[2:10:06] ready to empower you with his holy ghost
[2:10:08] I promise to speak his word through you
[2:10:12] and make you a witness in this last day
[2:10:15] Hallelujah
[2:10:18] Oh my he said Moses that's what he
[2:10:22] chooses man all right another Prophet
[2:10:25] said a minute cannot bring a Revival
[2:10:26] there's no preacher can bring a Revival
[2:10:28] he doesn't pack it with him the only
[2:10:30] thing you do is just be loyal to God and
[2:10:32] his word and the Revival has got to come
[2:10:36] by the people
[2:10:37] in your home in your life he said in our
[2:10:41] Revival isn't adding new members to the
[2:10:43] church but it's Reviving stirring up
[2:10:45] what we've already got oh you can get
[2:10:49] ready to piss himself I'm gonna really
[2:10:51] close out here
[2:10:52] revive means to bring back isn't that
[2:10:55] right Prophet radical here afterwards
[2:10:58] that I stood here uh oh yeah I'll read
[2:11:01] the quote here afterwards he said I
[2:11:02] stood here some years ago
[2:11:03] for my first time a large body of water
[2:11:05] which was Lake Michigan uh and I was
[2:11:08] about just about ordin the Missionary
[2:11:10] Baptist Church he said and he said he
[2:11:11] went out to Issa Issa Sunrise Sun
[2:11:14] service out on the lake amen and he said
[2:11:16] uh he was a
[2:11:19] he said he drove out there for a while
[2:11:20] and he noticed big waves right so he
[2:11:22] drove out to the to this to the Sea and
[2:11:24] he said it was his first time seeing a
[2:11:26] large body of water
[2:11:27] oh there amen it's not right he went out
[2:11:29] on Lake Shore Drive stood out there a
[2:11:31] little while he said and I noticed all
[2:11:32] them waves jumping up and down just
[2:11:34] splashing around and I thought what is
[2:11:36] it so excited about what is all the
[2:11:39] excitement and the little waves he said
[2:11:40] would start and it would run out and get
[2:11:42] come big Great Waves then bounce into
[2:11:45] each other and break apart and the form
[2:11:47] would fly up and it'll come back in and
[2:11:49] then he said I see the big waves coming
[2:11:51] again breaking on the bank he said like
[2:11:53] you're used to here he said but that was
[2:11:55] something new for me he said a
[2:11:56] landlocked servant so I noticed how to
[2:11:58] do that he said and then I said he said
[2:12:01] well what must it be he said the lake is
[2:12:03] having a Revival he said that's what it
[2:12:06] must be it does what it is he said it's
[2:12:09] having a big time just jumping up and
[2:12:13] down I thought he said well that's good
[2:12:15] that's fine he said but you know I
[2:12:17] thought well I wonder if it's got a lot
[2:12:19] of extra water when it's having a
[2:12:21] Revival he thought and he said no he
[2:12:24] said there isn't one drop more in it
[2:12:26] right now than if it was perfectly calm
[2:12:29] not one bit he said it's the same water
[2:12:33] he said but it's just having a Revival
[2:12:39] is that what we need this morning oh
[2:12:41] Hallelujah jumping up and down I thought
[2:12:44] well what what good does that do the
[2:12:46] prophet said come to find out when it's
[2:12:48] having a Revival and jumping up and down
[2:12:51] like that it washes all the trash up out
[2:12:55] of it on the shore and he said that's
[2:12:58] what the church needs oh that's what the
[2:13:02] church needs this morning is a Revival
[2:13:06] oh get all of the world and all the
[2:13:09] things of the world you can understand
[2:13:11] wash out so it could look clear it could
[2:13:14] look pretty again and when it all calms
[2:13:17] down it's got the same amount of water
[2:13:19] but what causes the sea to do that is
[2:13:21] because the wind comes and blows against
[2:13:23] that waves blows against the body of
[2:13:25] water pick it up he said that's what the
[2:13:27] church needs tonight it's a rushing
[2:13:30] Mighty Wind coming down upon it again
[2:13:33] and Reviving it getting all of the world
[2:13:36] out getting all of the things of the
[2:13:38] world out and then when it starts it's
[2:13:41] not a Revival and then when it settles
[2:13:45] down the church is all his condition
[2:13:47] then to start off to receive spiritual
[2:13:49] gifts and blessings from God that's what
[2:13:52] we want isn't our eyes oh hallelujah
[2:13:55] hallelujah Prophet said the church is
[2:13:57] predestinated to adoption when man God
[2:13:59] could take a man and adopt him into the
[2:14:01] family give him something then push try
[2:14:04] it see if it's right the Bible said try
[2:14:06] the spirits this man claims a certain
[2:14:08] thing try it and see if it's right if
[2:14:10] it's right move right with it then say
[2:14:12] Lord send us something else send us
[2:14:15] something else and he said Keep moving
