and Welcome to our Sunday morning service and what a blessing we had on Friday brother Kelly if you haven't heard it go back and listen to it every service counts everything that we do and share I said that um I felt led to call him and I can't say he felt L to be ready but he was ready just like he was waiting for that call so that's how God work on both sides and there's another testimony what happened the day after just to confirm what took place on Friday so it's kind of mind bugling so I told him it's all Supernatural and this is what we have to see about being led by the spirit so for example on Wednesday night I know I didn't finish and had stuff I could preach I had another message preach this morning and yet I get something else to do this morning so we going to see what the Lord will do but I want to bring back a scripture that brother kis read from Jeremiah uh chapter uh three and God was speaking and said and the Lord said unto me the backsliding Israel had justify herself more than treacherous Judah go and Proclaim these words towards the North and say return th backslide in Israel sayeth the Lord and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful sayth the Lord and I will not keep anger forever so I want you to think that God is not a man so let's say another dimension mysterious being Spirit humans that's what we are and he can't break his own laws because he's God even though he want to be merciful even though he want to help you he can't help you outside the law of his word do you understand that he can't say like I was human as as you pass pass pass or come to the back door oh or is your child no he's no respect of persons so you may have issues with your child being straighten out by the ministry or by the word and you get vexed and everything else that have with God you know that have to do with your human element that has nothing to do with God uh the Bible study Isaac had the king who was a good King his sons was terrible so you can't say because the king is a good King automatically his son's going to be good no them guys was terrible guys even with Eli was terrible people terrible children in other words they don't follow through the king is righteous the father is righteous and the children end up corrupt so it cannot be is my child and my child you're defending your child no have child off your child off your child wrong your child wrong because God word is true so God was saying here go and Proclaim his words to the north and said return th backside in Israel say the Lord and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful sayith the Lord I will not keep anger forever so this God we serve do get angry come on say don't hold back on what talking mystery he just get angry he just get upset you as a parent you ever get upset upset with your children upset with the situation well God has get upset he has get upset with you and with me he get upset and he has get angry and when he get angry he just want to do something just as you as a parent when you get angry you want to do something either you speak to the child or correct the child or whatever it is but you do something about it the first thing you do is to speak stop that foolishness and if you don't want to hear you just feel afterwards oh I go bring the belt but something had to be done the first thing is a warning because it's God speaking are you with me here this part verse 13 this the part me only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy God right and has scattered thy ways to the strangers on the evergreen tree and you have not obeyed my voice sayeth the Lord all right he said only acknowledge your iniquity don't make excuses don't say it's not me no no no you was that fault you sinned you fail you were corrupt you were whatever you did it but you want to make the pastor excuse the Elder excuse a DI excuse somebody excuse you want to make church are excuse all kind of excuse and you don't want to see the mirror of the word to see your own self and that's a shame because God will hit your heart on that you are his child but he going to discipline you praise God he going to forgive you know but you going to reap what you s you can't so Cav and reap Dash oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah so watch this part turn oh backsliding children sayeth the Lord for I am married unto you amen and I will take you one of a city two of a family and I will bring it to Zion and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding oh praise the name of the Lord and it shall come to pass when he shall be multiplied and increased in the land prophecy in those days says the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall it be done anymore at that time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of God and all nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem neither shall they walk anymore in the imagination of their evil heart and this is the problem that we have to come to some point in time you have to come to that man's heart is evil I don't care how nice they are how they're looking outside and the clothes nice and the shoes nice and the tie nice and the jacket nice man heart is evil and God said give me that evil heart give me that hard heart I'll give you a my a heart towards me I'll give you my spirit your I'll give you a new spirit and I put my spirit inside of there this is what God want to do transform people's lives this is a message of transformation Enoch had to be made ready to hit the Rapture Oh Glory to God he can't just be say I am Enoch you know I sa the Lord you know no the Bible said before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God each one of you have got to have a testimony you can't be sitting in your rotten self having the same behavior same attitude all the time job said I will wait till my change come because he knew a change was coming do you know A Change Is Coming a Rapture or a tribulation But A Change Is Coming Oh Glory to God nothing is remaining the same your age will not be the same youth is Vanity strength is Vanity all your looks is Vanity it will fail someday Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God when we come into the church this morning we hit the traffic light I say Amry look at that that light is red but that light red is not forever Oh Glory the red light is not forever and the green is not forever oh glory to God the rain is not forever and the sun is not forever and you will not be sitting in this church forever oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise God Amen so this friends is I and God knows my heart I I in all what I try to present I try to challenge you out of the lethargic message thing that I see people in I try to challenge you out of that to press your way amen into a spirit atmosphere of communion and fellowship with God and not the ridiculous entitlement spirit that this generation have I don't want that in this church you entitled to nothing you're entitled to go to hell but you're entitled to press your way God want you to press your way into the kingdom of God who do you think you are because you are two money in your pocket two cents p on your head two cars two house to what what what is that you can't take that into the kingdom you can't take the latest you have into the kingdom that that is that is irrelevant the kingdom is not in meat and drink but in power and joy in the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God that's what the kingdom is of that's what we come here to press into the kingdom of God and there's a prophecy hanging over you over this church of adoption where God could put a man in a position of power because of his character not because how much years he in the message not because how much time he be the pulpit but because of his character God could put the man in a position of power the Lord I shout in the house glory glory to God do you get it now do you get it now all these years fire Dynamics truck the Pentecostal and what did it do speak in tongues and give hell speak in the tongues and take on somebody else wife speak in tongues and live contrary to the word of God it Pentecost is still in the [Applause] message we don't want that is a god of righteousness and Holiness Hallelujah he said be holy because I am Holy that's the reason you be holy I holy is he's a god of sacrifice Prophet said when he was in birth pains when he was bringing you forth before the he was in birth pains to bring you amen that's a powerful quot you know I'll say it again he was in bird pains to bring you forth the lamb was slam for the foundation of world but the lamb come down here and die on Calvary so what you have to go through you have to go through and God a he sorry for you you mother might feel sorry your father might feel sorry but God are feeling sorry for you you have to go through you to go through glory to God serve the Lord he going to bless you he going to bless you going out he going to bless you coming in no devil can stop that blessing that God put upon your life Hall Glory Glory I want your fair out in God reach out in [Applause] God I wonder what if I didn't call Brother Kelly then I would be under Disobedience because the spirit bid me to do that what if he wasn't ready something wrong because God has a word on both sides a time is not fair you don't call somebody know to to say something next day you don't do that that not even logic unless unless unless the person that you're calling is [Applause] reall so I RT your coming you know but for those who are ready you have to be ready you can't be in wanting found in the balance and found wanting you can't be wanting you have to be ready the Bible said his wife had made herself ready own up to your iniquities own up to your own sin repent Oh Glory to God if you never do you have to repent you have to repent you can't continue you can't repent and continue in sin you have to repent and get out of sin turn around return you back side in Israel glory to God you may be seated so this morning have a special tape if you

dance amen Rejoice on your promise that there's going to be adopted sons in Trinidad oh give the Lord our shout let's get that tape on ready oh Hallelujah adoption part [Applause] [Music] one you feel [Music] good well it's always as I have said before I was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord I believe David made that statement once let us go into the house of the Lord I don't know any better place to be to you and in the house of the Lord amen now tonight we are we got some friends here that's all the way from Georgia and they'll probably be driving down after after the lunch tonight and then we will some of them from way down I hope you stay over and what rooms we got is open to you and then Wednesday night we'll continue on on the study and then the Lord willing next Sunday again and then shiaka begins on the 6th so all that's got your vacations plann we're expecting a great wonderful time at the Sha that's where we always have such a marvelous time not too biger crowds we run sometimes it'll hold up to about I suppose we could put 10,000 in it easy but usually last year I think we had around about 7,000 something like that was a packed out place but there's plenty of room to stand and seats that they could run all the way out and uh so we are looking forward to that and glad to see many of our Minister Brothers in uh can't never think of his name here the missionary brother Humes sister Humes is that you sitting right here the little ones we're glad to have them a missionarying other ones brother Pat brother Dalton and all just so many brother beer and seen brother Collins just a few moments ago and oh it' be kind of hard to call them all but we're very happy to have you in the house of the Lord tonight this great precious brother Neville sitting behind me here to pray with me while we are going to teach the word Charlie glad to see you and sister Nelly Here Tonight the little ones this is and Bible teaching is usually a very yes brother Welch I just was looking for you I see you sitting back there now Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on the thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the the church to what I think to uh uh complete uh understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother beer that teaching goes beyond that and kindly especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen now if the United States of this Fair land here sent me over to Russia as an ambassador of this nation to Russia then if they have officially sent me to Russia all the power that the United States has is behind me my word is just the same as the United States if I have been recognized as an ambassador amen and then if God has sent us to be his ambassadors all the power that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels and all of his power stands behind our words amen if we are correctly an ordained sent Messengers to the people God has to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatever you bind on Earth that will I bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that will I loose in heaven I give unto thee the keys to the kingdom all such great promises he's given the church and I am after the other day if many of you are supposed to share this morning to here as I try to in my humble simple way to explain the the vision that I saw of Heaven I Would by no means ever try to doubt anything that anyone ever told me that God told them I believe it even if I didn't see it in the scripture I would still uh want to believe that brother's word I I might just stay right along with the Bible but still I would believe it may be brother had just misunderstood it some way that he might have just got it mixed up a little and still I would believe he he to be my brother and if there's anything that burns within my heart and I hope it never leaves in my years to come that I'll never forget what happened last Sunday morning as a week amen it has done something to me that's revolutionized my my life I I do not fear I I have not one fear of death death has no fear at all and it it doesn't for you if you just understood now maybe if you'd have to have the experience to know it because there's no way to explain it you cannot find words because it doesn't lay in the English uh dictionary or no other dictionary because it's in an eternity no yesterday no tomorrow it's all present tense and it's no uh I feel pretty good in an hour from now I don't feel so well and another hour feel good again it's present tense all the time never cease just that glorious peace something and there can be no sin there could be no jealousy there could be no sickness there there could be nothing ever reach that Heavenly Shore and if I may have the privilege of saying this which maybe I do not if I do not then I pray God forgive me but if if I have the privilege and it was that God let me be caught up to see something I would refer to the first heavens and then I believe one in the Bible by the name I believe was Paul that was caught up into the third heavens and if it was this glorious in the first Heavens what does that third Heavens hold [Music] am no wonder he couldn't speak of it for 14 years he said he did not know whether he was inbody or out of body with that great Apostle not to share his his his office or not to try to make ourselves anything like he was but I can say with him I don't know whether it was in this body are out of the body only thing it would just as real as I'm looking at you and I've always wondered about if I'd passed by I'd see a little Cloud floating by a spirit and say there goes brother and sister that's Charlie and Nelly that's brother and sister Spencer going there that always puzzle me if my eyes is in in the grave uh decaying rottening if my ears is not here to hear anymore and if my blood is all gone back and they've been bombed it and it's in the waters are in the ground and my mental faculties my brain cells are all gone then how would I be any more than just a spirit floating around that wearied me how would I like to say hello brother Pat oh so glad to see you hello brother naville I would like to see you but I thought well if I don't have anything to see with any mouth to speak with it's rotten it's dust how would I be able to say hello brother Pat hello brother Neville or so forth hi Charlie but now I know that that's wrong for it is written in the scriptures which I say it's not contrary for if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting another Tabernacle it has eyes ears lifts mental faculties if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved it has a body that I can feel can talk and now it comes to me just now that Moses had been dead and in an in unmarked grave for 800 years and Elisha had went to heaven 500 years before but on Mount Transfiguration they were found talking with Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah after Samuel had been dead for at least 3 to 5 years and The Witch of indor called him up and she fell on her face and she said you have deceived me because you are Saul yourself she said because I see Gods she was a heathen you see I see Gods rising up and Saul couldn't see him yet and he said what does he look like describe him to me said he's thin and he has a mantle over his shoulder said that's Samuel the prophet bring him here before me and I want you to notice that Samuel had not lost any of his personality he was still a prophet he told Saul exactly what would happen happen the next day so you see death does not completely diminish us as we weep and wail and lament at the grave it only changes our Dwelling Place it takes us from a place to what is age if I live one more hour I'll outlive a many 16y old person I'll out live a many five year old person age is nothing we're just set here for a purpose to do something well now many of these little pretty faed mothers sitting here some of them 60 or 70 years old would say what have I done brother brandom you've raised your children you've done what you were supposed to do maybe some old dad sitting here say well I've hired the fields I've done this I never preach but you did just what God sent for you to do there's a place for you speaking to an old doctor yesterday one of my doctor friends buddies 80 something years old and his sister law is here at the church tonight and she's been just a tle teeny bit worried about him and I went to see him and as soon as I begin to talk to him he brightened up told me about a hunting trip he taken many years ago up in Colorado in the very same country I hunt at just as brilliant and bright and I said Doctor how long you been practicing he said when you were nursing and way down I said a many a time he said I've practiced taking my buggy I've put my saddle bags over my horse I've took the little satchel and I've walked and I said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with your flashlight trying to find the house where a little child had tummy acre mother labor pains that's right I said you know doctor I believe across this dividing line here between Mortal and immortality God has a place for good old doctors that serve like that great tears come in his eyes and he started crying he reached up his feeble hands and said brother I hope so across the land god judges a man's Soul what he is then I give him this satisfying scripture many times plying through those dark muddy fields at night trying to help somebody maybe never get a penny for but it's all right I said Jesus said in the scripture blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and that is true tonight we want to set the church in these three lessons if God permits how and what to look to what we are we're going to begin at the first chapter of the book of Paul's letter to Ephesus and we're going to take the three first chapters in our next three studies trying to get a chapter a evening if we can tonight Wednesday and next Sunday morning Ephesians the first chapter now as we study together I'd like to say this that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament Joshua Ephesians the book of Ephesians now remember if we happen to get just a little off to your teaching just far give us and bear with us a while before we open it let's ask him to help us as we bow our heads Lord we are approaching thy holy and sacred RIT which it is more secure than all the heavens and earth for we read in this word called the Bible that both Heaven and Earth will pass pass away but my word shall never fail then upon this solemn hour that I come to this ppit tonight before the purchase of your blood these precious darling martal that set here tonight grasping for every little hope that they can to hold on for that life that is to come yes may it be so sufficient tonight that every believer here will see his position and everyone who has not yet come into this Great Fellowship will press the kingdom Lord and knock at the door until the keeper opens the door granted Lord we are reading in here where uh this Bible is of no private interpretation God forbid that I your servant or any other servant would ever try to put their own interpretation to the word let us just read it and believe it the way it is written and especially we Shepherds of the flocks we pastors who someday will gather you in that glorious land with the little flocks and we'll stand in the presence of the Lord Jesus and we'll see that generation come up of Paul and of Peter and of Luke and Mark and Matthew and all the them and see them judge there with their groups God grant that I can lay 10 million trophies at your feet while I humbly Coss all up and lay my hands upon your precious feet and say Lord they are yours oh God fill us freshly with thy spirit and with thy love and thy goodness and may we as the poet has expressed in the song many years ago dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power until all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more and ever since by faith I saw that stream thy flowing wound supplied redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I [Music] die then in a nobler sweeter song he goes on to say I'll sing thy power to save when this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave then the grave does not hold any death for your children it's only a resting place or a hiding place for this corruption put on incorruption may we tonight see this Lord plainly as it is given to us in the word give us understanding and place us Lord at our post of Duty that we might serve Faithfully until you come we ask this in jesus' name and for his sake amen amen now the book of Ephesians as I was just saying I to my opinion is one of the greatest books of the New Testament it leaves us on where Calvinism runs out on one limb and Armenian ISM runs out on the other L but the book of Ephesian draws it together and positionally play es the church now I typed it with Joshua if you notice Israel was brought up out of Egypt and the three stages of their Journey one stage was leaving Egypt the next stage was the Wilderness and the next stage was Canaan now Canan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represents the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they killed and burnt and Tuck cities and there will be no death in the Millennium but another thing that it does it brings up justification by faith after they believed Moses and left Egypt sanctification to following under the pillar of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and then entering into a land that had been promised now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer the promise is the holy spirit for it shall come to pass in the last days Joel 228 that I will pour out my my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my hands maids and my maid servants will I pour out of my spirit and they shall prophesy I'll show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth pillars of fire and smoke and vapor and Peter said on the day of Pentecost after taking his text and preaching repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission to remit to forgive to take away all back trespasses did you notice Joshua before they Cross Jordan Joshua he said go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you and let no man come at his wife far within 3 days you'll see the glory of God see it is a it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise now the promise to Israel was God gave Abraham the promise of the land of Palestine and it was to be their possession forever and there was to always remain in this land now they come three stages coming to this promised land now watch it's perfectly typed in the New Testament now if this is I've said disagrees with some of the thinking of yours some of you precious Nazarene people Church of God and so forth don't let it hurt but just watch it close and watch the types watch and see if ever place don't hit just perfect there was three stages of the journey and and there's three stages of this journey for we are justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus christall forsaking the land of Egypt come out and then are Sanctified to the offering of his blood wash from our sins and become pilgrims and Souljers claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming are a promise so did Israel in the wilderness sojourners no place to rest traveling night after night fallowing the pillar ofar but finally come to the promised land where they settle down that's where the believer comes he comes first to recognition that he's a sinner then he is separated by the waters the washing of the Water by the blood and are the washing of the Water by the word rather Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ than being justified by faith he becomes a partaker and a peace with God through Christ baptized into the name of Jesus Christ to Omit him into the journey you get it into the journey then he becomes a soul Jer and a Pilgrim he's on his journey to what a promise that God made Israel had not yet received the promise but they were on their [Music] Journey I'm without raising please do understand that's where you the Nazarene and Pilgrim Holiness and so forth fell because Israel when they come to the spot of kades Baria when the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them come back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up and so forth but Joshua and Caleb stood out and said we're more than able to take it because of there're already signed up documented statements they believed in two works of Grace justification and sanctification and could not move any farther and listen that whole generation perished in the wilderness but two that went over into the promised land and brought back the evidence that it was a goodly land and we were more than able to take it because it was God's promise then instead of the people going on receiving the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues receiving the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs wonders Miracles they felt that it would break down their tradition of Doctrine and what happened to it perished in the land that's right but the Believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they move moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we pray rest down into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost bar Peter said on the day of Pentecost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them it's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positioning you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land Ephraim here Manasses here and this one here Gad here Benjamin here he divided the land and notice oh this just burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study we can only go into it in details which would take hours after hours someday when we get our church fixed I just like to come and take a solid month or two am just stay right in it watch when they each one of those mothers when she called out e for him when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet was setting in ARL just exactly every one of them whever they were at and Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being into the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth Bank there how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometime when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he's given to there speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles where the church is now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corn but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're a Manasses you've got to take your place in Christ positionally take it all it gets deep and Rich when we get in here how that God puts one in the church to speak with tongues another now we have been taught many times we all have to speak with tongues that's wrong we all got to do it no we don't they all didn't do one thing each one was each lamb was provided and divid up by inspiration and each one I could take the scriptures and show to you exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be amen positionally how that the two half tribes is to stay across the river how that their mothers cried that in their birth and how that each place was supposed to be and now after you're in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see Canaan did not represent the great heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk there's where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of the Judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother Brandon well that's the truth think of it Joshua after he crossed over into the land God gave him the promise that just think the fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting a scratch without having to have a nurse or a first aid or a B God said the land's yours go fight think of fighting a campaign and there's no Red Cross around at all there's nobody going to get hurt and they slay the amorites and the haites but there wasn't one hurt among any of them until sin come in the camp and when achen took that Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it under his Camp then the next day they lost 16 men Joshua he said stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call seven days of fast God made us a promise there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere because we got 16 dead men laying here they're Israelite brothers and they're dead why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of the line you see the reason this needs to be taught amen the church lining up lining up with the word of God Amen lining up with God lining up with each other amen walking perfectly upright soberly before all men fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not done took the life of 16 man I think it was 16 maybe more I believe it 16 man that was dead Joshua called said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it and he called a fast and they found out the Castel lots and aen confessed it and they killed aen family and all and burnt their ashes and left it there for a memorial and Joshua went right on through the battles taking everything without a scratch her wound there you are one day he had needed a little time extra time the sun was going down that man couldn't fight very good at night time Joshua that great warrior anointed of God positionally placed into the land like Ephesians to the new church Poss possessed the possessing the land taking it over he needed some time so he said Son stand still and she stood still for about 12 hours until he took the land see now the book of Ephesians Place us positionally in Christ what they was in the Holy Land we are placed not in the Holy Land but in the Holy Ghost amen now let us read just the word see how perfect the church is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God oh I like that yes God made him an apostle no Elders laid hands on him no Bishop sent him anywhere but God called him and made him an apostle Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints Sanctified ones which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Jesus Christ watch how he addresses this this is not to the unbelievers this is to the church it's called to the called out ones the Sanctified and called ones that are in Christ Jesus now if you want to know how we get in Christ Jesus if you turn to First Corinthians 12 it said for by one Spirit yes are we all baptized into one body how baptized by what the Holy Ghost not by water baptism you Church of Christ people but by one capital s p r i t by one Spirit not by one handshake by one letter not by one sprinkle but by one spirit amen we are all baptized into one body our possession the land that God give us to live in the Holy Ghost just as he give Canaan to the Jews he's give us the Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body amen you get it now he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel us possessed the land oh aren't you glad you come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness and remember they had to eat Mana Angels food out of Heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they crossed over into the land the Mana ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land amen now thank now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the censor milk of the Gospel that you don't have to be baby and patted and persuaded to come to church now that you're real fully matur Christians you're ready to eat strong Meats now amen you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and Rich oh we'll get into it directly and all it's been hidden since the foundation of the world am God he said now that you've come into this I'm addressing this to you not to those who've just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised Landen that has received the promise how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad that you're in the land amen over here now eating the old K eating the strong things of God and got a clear understanding your your spiritual mind is all un muddled up you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day oh that's the one that's who Paul's talking to now listen close I want the faithful in Christ Jesus now let me have the church to repeat that how do we get into Christ by jaring Church no by putting our name on a book no by being baptized by IM mercy no how do we get into Christ by one's Holy Spirit amen are we all baptized into one promise the body amen and are partakers of all that belongs into the land amen amen oh I like that if it wasn't a horse I could shout hallelujah when I get in this land it's mine I'm home now I'm in Canan amen I'm subject to anything God wants to use me for I'm walking on Holy Ground Hallelujah a child of the king amen all roped and ready I've come out of Egypt come up through the promised land stood the trials passed over Jordan into this blessed promise hallelujah oh how did I get it by one Spirit the same way Paul got it acted on me the same way did on him same way it did on you amen by one Spirit we are all baptized hallu not sprinkled just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good but immersed under god oh make the be swim under and the Holy Ghost that's the promise are Ephesians are Joshua which is the holy spirit Joshua means Jesus Savior Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural that he is our great warrior amen he's our great leader as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about and When sin comes in the camp the Holy Spirit Demands a halt amen what's wrong here in this church something's wrong oh can't you see how we got too many sons of Kish now too many Sauls coming from seminaries and Theological schools and going out and teaching this perverse things as the Bible said they would do seemingly not having the faith separating themselves from you having no fellowship with you and so forth having a farm of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turnaway they don't know where they come from they can't

knowledge he foresaw you and know that You' love him and before there was a foundation of the world he chose you amen and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself to love oh wish we had just a few more minutes time let me before we go any further go back Genesis 1:26 I'll pick it up Wednesday when God made man before he made man he called himself l e l l e l h l o l oim the word means in the Hebrew the self existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence the ever was self existence on L Elohim means all sufficient all powerful allm mighty self-existence one Hallelujah but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y a h u ju u v u h yah Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existence one who has created something all of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore he exists with his family Hallelujah el el Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak it it would be so he could speak this and it would be so amen there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him amen there you are Hallelujah I read that we'll get into it Wednesday night when we got more time we just about 15 more minutes and we I thought I'd get to a certain spot here but uh we won't to where we're sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise all right now when was we called to be Servants of God when was Aral Neville called to be a servant of God am oh my this staggers me I tell you let's get some scriptures I want you to get first Peter uh 1220 and uh Pat get Revelation 178 and I'll get Revelations 13 now we want to listen here you want to know when God called you to be a Christian oh I love this this man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God all right brother nille you got first Peter 120 120 read 119 and 120 listen to this 119 and 20 yes but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you when was he for ordained before the foundation of the world brother Pat read Revelation 1778 for me the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not yet who's going to be deceived who's going to be dece by this religious person like Saul was that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive the what very e if possible if possible all right Revelations 13:8 let me read it for you and all that dwell upon the Earth sh all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slaying before the foundation of the world Hallelujah when was our names put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when God was Jehovah el el Elohim the self-existence one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior Amen in this attributes on the inside of him was a Healer Hallelujah while there was nothing to save and nothing to heal but his attributes produced it so then before the foundation of the world when he know that the great display in here of him that he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt Among Us and he know by his stripes would be healed he slayed the Lamb on his book before the foundation of the and wrote your name on that book before the foundation of the world Amen thank you Jesus listen to this predestination looks back to for knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is I was a cockle bir I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among Sinners father and mother and all my whole family Sinners I was a cockle bird but all of a sudden I become a wheat grain how did it happen uh that what is that election God before the foundation of the world elected that the CER was to become a grain of now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved how do I do it look back and see that he predestinated it long time ago by for knowledge he seemed that I would love him so he made a propitiation through his own son that through him I might become from a of bird to a grain of wheat now where am I at now I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to and where am I going that's got you there you are now let's read just a little farther and then we'll have to close pretty shortly according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do he by for knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence there was no Angels no nothing just God L Elohim the self-existence one nothing but him alone but in him was a savior amen well what he go to save there's nothing lost knowing that then he know that this great attribute in him would project something out under that he could save then when he did that by four knowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it yes and then by doing so he said to save that the only way I can do it will be come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of the man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worshiped because he is God the object of worship amen then he came down and taken up on himself and while he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved praise the Lord do you see what I mean by for knowledge amen the infinite God who know all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do so he put your name on there and he said that the Antichrist would be so religious so good such a fine fellow such a smart man such a religious man that he would deceive that very elected if it was possible but it isn't impossible because her names were for ordained before the foundation of the world by election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are going there you are now who could doubt that that's what Paul said that's Paul's scripture that's Paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body amen to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you positionally then when we have come from the garlic lands of Egypt through sanctification and baptized into the promised land for the promise of God is the Holy Ghost amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are SE until the day of your Redemption amen then God having predestinated the church he said and all the peoples there will be Millions times millions that will walk very religious and be deceived the only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the promised land who before the foundation of the world had their names put on the Lamb's Book of Life and come over into the promised land and enjoying it amen many people are afraid you're going to act funny many people are afraid the Holy Ghost will make you do something you'll be ashamed of people many people are afraid they'll cry and their sweetheart will see them crying or mama or your neighbor or your boss will see you let me tell you about a man one time before closing that was a man named David and when the Ark of God had been down in the Philistine land and had come across pull by Ark old oxes that pulling him when David saw that Ark coming he had a little gown on him he run out there and kicked his feet in the air and jumped around and screamed and jumped and danced and jumped and danced and him the king of Israel and his wife looked out of a window and saw him acting so strange she despised him why she must have said the idiot look at him out there the way he's acting throwing his feet up in the air and jump around and acting like that why he must be crazy and that night when come in she said in words like this why you've embarrass me why are you the king my husband out there doing like that acting like that David said tomorrow I'll do better than that yes sir he said don't you know I was dancing unto the Lord Lord he crossed over he was in the land of the promise he lost all self Styles and buck of the world he was so happy to know that the ark was coming into his own City no I tell you some people's afraid to receive the Holy Ghost afraid that they might speak with tongues they're afraid that somebody would say now he's them tongues guys they're afraid to come to the church to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because they're ashamed of it oh somebody said I have to recall my tapes because I preached you been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I ain't recalling him I'm making more amen that's right making more that is the Bible if they don't like what we did yesterday this watch what we're going to do tomorrow that's the thing to do just keep on going there's no end to it because it is of the lord it's God you know what God did God looked down out of the heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart amen David wasn't ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he loved the Lord and he was so happy so Overjoyed though he didn't think about human pre you see as I said in my sermon this morning we are so much afraid that we want a Saul to teach us we want a saw from some Seminary to tell us how we must do our religion and how we must do it that is on the other side of the Jordan this side the Holy Spirit leads over here you're out of that M over here you don't care what they think over here you're dead in your life is hid in Christ suit and sealed by the holy ghosten you don't care you're living in Canaan you can stand good corn you're a new creature in Christ Jesus you're bound for the promised land I remember standing y brother Collins some 30 years ago when this church wasn't built yet there's a little tent meeting sitting here on the corner my first meeting I was preaching this same gospel same thing The unsearchable Riches of Christ water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ believing every word to be the truth baptism of the Holy Ghost Divine Healing the powers of God just like I preach it now never varied one inch from any of it God revealed more of it to me so as he reveals it I just keep bringing it on he never takes away from what has been he just keeps adding more on to it I stood down there when about 500 people stood on the banks singing on Jordan stormy Banks I standing cast The Wishful eye to canaan's fair and Happy Land where my possessions lie When shall I reach that helpful Shore and be forever blessed When shall I reach be my father fathers and forever rest when they begin to sing that I was taking a boy out into the river to baptize him out there into the name of the Lord Jesus I said Heavenly fathers I bring this boy to you upon his confession just a boy myself got the pictures of it at home I said when I baptize him with water lord upon his confession in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God you filling with the Holy Ghost about that time something l out a whirl and hear it come whirling down the bright and morning Stars stood there there stood that light that you see right there on the picture there it stood it went around the world way up in Canada and around it that a Mystic light appears over a local Baptist Minister while he's baptizing a few days ago and Dr lsza come to me and never know nothing about that brought me a picture which Brothers got it there with him now if you got that picture if you got the Bible with you there is in your book all right there was a picture of the old ancient Hebrew sign of God just exactly that that existed in the days of job before the Bible was ever WR amen God and his three attributes not three Gods one God and three attributes Father Son and Holy Spirit three offices that God worked into not three Gods three attributes and there was that great man Dr LS of the translation of the lmes of Bible when he said that morning when I told him that I said I said what's that sign he said that's God's ancient sign the Hebrew God one God in three attributes I said such as Father Son and the Holy Ghost he stopped and he set his cup of coffee down he looked at me Jean believe you was there Leo said you believe that I said with all my heart he said last night standing in your meeting brother brandham I've seen that discernment I've never seen it before in America in my land he said these American people don't even know the Bible only thing they know is a denomination they don't even know where they're standing said they don't know nothing he said but when I stood there last night said I said I brother Gan I say this with reverence and love and such he said I said that must be a prophet but when I see that you believe that father Son and Holy Ghost ghost was no three Gods it was attributes then I know that you are a prophet of God or it wouldn't be revealed to you like that he said that's a perfect sign said I've never said you're not Oneness I said no sir I am not the Oneness I believe in God being the almighty God and the three attributes are only three offices that the one God lived in he said bless your heart he said someday you'll pour your blood upon the Earth for that but said prophets always die for their cause now said so let it be if it pleases my Lord the translation of the ls of the Bible oh it is so true how many times do I say to this church as Samuel said before the chose Saul before you go out and join some denomination now and get yourself all tied up in some kind of a religion why don't you let the Holy Spirit lead you why don't you take God for your leader let him bless you and forget about your denomination now I'm not saying don't belong to any denomination a church you belong to anyone you want to that's up to you but I'm telling you as an individual you let the Holy Spirit lead you you read the Bible and what the Bible says do you do it God bless you and I've waited a long time I wonder if there's any here that want to come through the prayer line to be prayed for if they are would they raise your hands just one two three all right yall come right up here and stand here and if you wish to at this time and and uh we'll have prayer and then we're I don't want you to leave yet I want to officially do something else here just before we we close how many likes the study of the book of Galatians oh I mean Ephesians now Wednesday night we're going to go into the seal and then on next Sunday morning we're going into the positionally placing the church all if we'll probably get in on that on this coming Wednesday night to you people here in Jeff positionally placing the church where they belong amen each one how we're called by the adoption God has adopted us Unto the Sons we are Sons by birth adopted and positionally placed by the Holy Spirit look they were every one Hebrews when the cross the river but Joshua divided the land and give each one his land according to the utterance of his mother at the birth where the Holy Spirit told him look at Jacob when he was dying a prophet blinded pulled his feet up into the bed said come forth ye sons of Jacob and I'll tell you where you'll be at the last day oh amen praise the Lord oh I know I may seem strange the people may seem strange but oh if you only knew the the Assurance the they're burning in the heart amen come forth and I'll tell you where you'll be in the last days and I can take that same scripture and take the map of where the Jews are setting today and prove to you they're exactly on the same spot that Jacob said they'd be in the last day and they never did there haven't been on that spot until they returned since May the 7th 1946 the night the angel of the Lord appeared to me up there and said for this Mission amen and I can show you that when they come back into the new land they struck exactly the spots where Jacob said they would be setting and there they are sitting there today glory to God oh my oh my we're one day near home is all you dear people you're sick or you wouldn't be standing there just to be standing I'm your brother I have a commission from God to pray for the sick not as my as I have power to heal I do not but I have power of prayer as I said this morning David didn't have nothing but a little slingshot but he said I know what it'll do with the power of God on it see I only have a little prayer to offer for you and my hands to lay on you but I know what faith in God will do it's done for others it'll do for you you believe that now as you step right up it's a little closer to the place and I wonder to make this so efficient if I wouldn't ask my brother to come here and anoint him with all what you do that sir I'll ask the church if you bow in prayer I remember remember last week when I was so sick with that old cast AR I would just to give anything if somebody would have come by laid hands on me if I could have had somebody to come by that God had blessed and helped I so appreciate it you all feel to now like I did then you feel now you want me to do just like I wanted somebody do for me that God forbid I ever sh the job let me always where I'm tired where I'm weary where I can hardly move one foot

a hand of Praise this morning what an anointing what an atmosphere what a moving of the Holy Spirit to follow the word of [Music] God through that star in the right hand of God in the person of his Prophet who took the scriptures and shun the light as revealed to him the son of man veiled in a son of man speaking words that through these words that are promised as seed we could be partakers of his divine nature and could have access to Divine Authority have access to presence have access to very deity himself being able to be present in our hearts can we thank the Lord one more time for his grace his mercy and I'm so blown away by how God and random said it on this side of Jordan is the holy spirit leading we have not been this way before but it's the Holy Spirit every service last Wednesday the pastor stood he couldn't even finish his message because the Lord had him to say certain things about anointing the word and then to see brother Kelly out speak last Friday brother Kelly God bless you I was so blessed to see God use you in such a mighty way and to see it all tie together from even the message last Sunday with Jeremiah into the message last Wednesday into brother Kelly and now to hear the prophet speaking about being positionally placed your part in the body whether it's a housewife whether it's a preacher whether it's a prophet whatever it's supposed to be God in his great riches and his mercy and his predestination and his for knowledge knew you'd be here and no demon could stop it no devil could stop it your past can stop it your mistakes can stop it nothing present nothing past that to come to separate you from that great High Calling oh what a joy to be a Christian in such a time as this and the atmosphere in the church as a tape being played but over it said back then they weren't shouting but in here this morning the shout of the king is in the camp and this word is just as real just as the Holy Ghost is just as real to us today this tape this word is alive and in the days of the voice of that seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery is finished so we are worshiping knowing the mystery is finished knowing every mystery is revealed knowing our names are written and knowing that all is in order God is in control and the devil can't stop it I love something the prophet said he was speaking with David dancing with the Y coming and he said if you're bothered by what you see today wait till tomorrow oh God Lord help me this morning if what you see today as you worried wait till tomorrow because this Joy I have the world cannot take it away this peace I have and listen David had his ups and his downs and his victories and his defeats but when he saw the AR coming up the road he's oh mind what a joy in his soul and that's a joy we feel this morning give the Lord one more hand of Praise Blessed Be His holy name we just have one note of praise and always a joy this is from Anne he's not here physically here in the Tabernacle but thanking God for allowing me to celebrate my 88th birthday last Wednesday but Anne God bless you but Anne's Faith his Joy whenever you know him at Anne reach when he in the house he move in a certain way and age not suffing no demon trying to hold his body down so but Anne may God Rich you bless you may he strengthen you may your cup run over May the Holy Ghost round your life amen so let's just bow our heads for word of prayer and if there's anyone with a need this morning that we could take to the throne of grace knowing after the word has gone forth the atmosphere is right for anything that needs to be taken care of to be taken care of and if you want the show by raising your hand this morning a NE a Unwritten NE a unspoken NE a Unwritten desire and unspoken desire he is here to meet your needs if he is able this morning and we know he is to answer the desires of your heart what is that desire this morning as we approach the throne of God hallelujah hallelujah there's an anointing that just you you you felt it right you you felt him mve into the building Hallelujah so many times the prophet would say he is here we take every Spirit under our control troll in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatever it is this morning Hallelujah Heavenly Father lord El Elohim there is none like you from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same

5:00 p.m. that Saturday will be at 5:00 p.m. and and Easter Sunday morning will be at 8 a.m. we're going to have our precious brother stephanus colen Brena from Germany he'll be here to minister to us uh for two of those services so we want to remember him in prayer as he prepares to fly in for that special time and I had the privilege and the honor of being in the Germany conventions last year August and how the Lord moved Mally and just about two weeks ago to be in Germany once again and to see how God is using the church in Germany and how he's using with the stephanus and I know he's going to be a tremendous blessing to the church he has a true burden and he's coming with a burden and I know he's coming because the lord gave him something to come with he's not coming because he feeling to come or he just wants to come and but I know the Lord has spoken to his heart and these are this is the way that God moves with the body cuz it's one body and is a body is a universal mystical body body where each part of the body is supplying something for the body so we are so grateful to the love gifts that God has placed in the body that we could be blessed so I want to encourage you to stay in prayer stay in preparation and you know spread the word around that God is doing something he's doing something real in our hearts he's doing something real in our lives and he's in the process of transformation and we're looking for you know lies to be born into the kingdom and transformed even before that meeting but but I have great expectations for what God will do during those Easter meetings can the church say amen amen maintenance team group one please meet with brother popwell after the service and next week group three is carded to serve and there's a special note that we want all the team members who were part of the various teams to meet with your respective team leaders for a maintenance update and we really want to express our deepest gratitude to all of the Believers and you heard it from mother Kelly sa he's not even here but he's identified with the work because it is an important work making preparation for the word of God to be brought from the sacred desk we we really want to thank and extend our deepest gratitude to all of the Believers who are part of the various teams and the maintainers of the Tabernacle may God richly bless you this is from groups I believe 1 to five and we also solicit more support for the various groups um in whatever way you could contribute we invite you speak with brother Stephen oliv our administrative Elder if you're interested in being part of a group and sometimes with different schedules different ones can't make it on different things so we really solicit all of the support into making this body and this operation here moves smoothly so uh we also want to remind you of the upcoming convention uh in July we the countdown is own we just suff about about 4 months of being able to make contributions and an input before the convention in July so we continue to solicit both your prayers and your financial support so that we'll be in a position to have a wonderful time we truly don't know how much time we have left and there's something that's moving that is undeniable and the closer we get to that time we'll have different kinds of services knowing that God has to cut the work short he promis to cut the work short for the elect because if you don't cut the work short for the elect nobody going to make it I want us to process that for a minute he has to cut the work short for the elic because the devil the Bible said the devil knows that his time is short so we had a very short time to do all we could do for the kingdom of God so may God richly bless you may you practice the presence of God may you stay in the presence of God and and there are so many ways you know and um it's it's so interesting last communion service uh brother play the the table tape of the prophet and in that he made that reference to putting the cross in his car and I've always used that with the young people to say that if the prophet of God would put a cross in his car so that when the woman on the street around he would look at the cross he had his own system if I could use that to protect himself and this is this is not a man on the street this is a prophet not just a prophet but a messenger to an age not just a messenger to an age but the greatest since Paul was on the earth not just the greatest but a star in the right hand of God and he was put in mechanism in place to protect his walk on the earth so I want to encourage you practice the presence of God if you have the message app on your phone you know you could listen to it you could you you you could choose what music you listen to you could choose to listen to scriptures there time I'm driving and I'm listening to scriptures the time I'm driving and listening to the prophet's message it changes your hope your desires your thinking the Bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind what you feed on what you eat on that is what you become so I want to really encourage you you want to see your walk change your talk change your life change eat differently feed your mind differently look at different things and you'll see it move from the inside to the outside so may the Lord richly bless you we love you we appreciate you and may God give you a blessed week brother [Music] [Applause] Anthony amen and amen thank you Jesus so she has come to us praise God there just one quick
