good so this morning is a special morning a special day every Sunday's a special this Sunday it shall be covered under great expectation that God will meet the knees and well we'll give the ocean and the inspiration that you have in here that you have any heart because you have to have that in your heart this is an odd thing I will share this morning and I know when I come back I have more on it but this is a thought that came to me of a tip I'd like to put on I'll see what the Lord will do but we want to stand for the wood no we want to go into the world Bishop of the Rudolf praise the Lord good to see you amen you good happy to be here this morning alright so don't miss any service no and what a Steven give a tremendous exhortation and on Friday a tremendous receiving after stitch those things together and give us a message a whole message okay so we want to look at footsteps Illusionist up to five wanna read verses 1 to 7 wanna look at Isaiah chapter 2 11 to 12 and we want to look at Isaiah 13 6 take them now many times I can't even explain how I get messages how things come but they come and I have to speak what God put put my heart so let's go to first just a little chapter 5 we have of this one but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief we are all children of the day and we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for data at sleep sleep in the night did I be talking a drunken in the night I'm a good Isaiah chapter 2 verse 11 God speaks the lofty looks of mana be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed on and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon everyone that is lifted up and he shall be brought low Isaiah chapter 13 we're in verse 6 wholly for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and soul shall take a whole of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travail let this shall be Amin is one at another the feast shall be as flames oh praise the Lord let's continue 6011 behold the day of the Lord cometh crewel boot rat and fierce anger to lay the land desolate he shall destroy the sinners deal out of it for the stars of heaven and the constellation thereof shall not give their light the Sun shall be darkened in the going forth and the moon shall not cause a light to shine and I will punish the world for the evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and I will lower the haughtiness of the terrible let us borrow his heavenly father we read your word and Lord is just such an interjection at this point in time how this message came and what you gave me to say to the people Lord may you inspire take me out of the way and Lord I only speak what you want me to speak in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be seated or praise the Lord amen praise God hallelujah glory to God I will contact Scripture version 612 and I beheld and he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood title this morning is the day of the Lord that's the title this morning the day of the Lord I feel is the message the warning and God always send warning before judgment but before he sends a warning he always made a provision for us keep whatever is coming because something is fixing to break for something is fixing to take place how can God give power question how can God give more than someone who doesn't know him looking for power but how could God gives someone power who doesn't know him who doesn't have a relationship with him who is not even close to him you know you could go and ask your father for something or your uncle for something but if you have some distance somebody you even talk to them how you gonna ask them for this walking for that or expect me to give you this time to give you that when you have a relationship with them it easy to ask easy for them to give it to you because you're a relationship with them is easy forgot to give you the size of your heart because your relationship with him so how can God give you power when you don't know him when you're not interested in knowing him I don't know him as much as I know the Lord you could only know him by his word you couldn't know him how we reveal how he could be contacted how he could all you could relate and commune with him if you don't go by the word then you're going by the god of the imagination of your own heart and mind the queen by the core of your own thoughts what you think he is what you feel is was a good God all the time and all let me look at phases and sort you going like that but God is not bad God is what we just read here tonight I will punish the sinners I will punish the world for the evil I will do that or glory to God hallelujah praise God I will share my wife this one in the scripture when God was telling them the when when I bring you all to Egypt I will bring it to a land a new land a different land or glory

become higher that'll come in the spirit to see further the see people they catch more okay the Lord I showed you can't stand firstly common natural family selfish stuff and expect to see what what you think you want to see Christ was the dog Christ is the door he's not right about and said before I set before you an open door and he's bringing a revolution inside of here he said this is my mercy in Chapter four just in the Ville he said Vietnam I've said before the open door he said after the Methodist Church age they turn away from it I've said before an open door I put an open door which is the Holy Spirit hallelujah so when God put the open door he put no man with that door he put the whole these prayers are set before you an open door Holy Spirit and that is was an open door but anybody that's why the Pentecostal is have no mind messenger it was open door still that's why the holy was brought upon them cuz open door he's not like watch watch I put an open door which is the Holy Spirit and he said by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is Christ he set that message before the Methodist Church and the turn aside from it the conference and vacation and refused the Holy Ghost remember that's the open door how do we get into Christ by one spirit Holy Spirit which is Christ spirit we are enter in not by hand shaken not by sprinkling but by one Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and made partakers of that one body one Holy Ghost baptism into that door Oh hallelujah I says again one Holy Ghost baptism into that door this door was set in heaven he looked up towards heaven and he's in an open door on the first voice sound like a trumpet and all the scenes change from Patmos to heaven the voice the voice that walk with the seven golden candlesticks that same voice didn't change but the voice when it was in the first time how many remember that I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day in the spirit isn't that right I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day I heard behind me a voice of a trumpet that song like many waters and that many waters is a voice of the ministers the voice of the preachers the voice of many waters the voice of the people he explained what the voice of many waters is its cause for all the ages speaking the word the people and as they rejected the voice to enter judgment Oh glory to God remember revelation is still a book assembles a lot of things representing something else let's continue hallelujah and when I tuned and look I saw one style missile semicolon stands legs and as he showed all the mystery of them seven golden candlesticks holding seven stands he looked and saw an open door an open door into heaven how do you get in by Christ Jesus one door one way any man can climb one away and the other we see him as a thief and a robber and in the parable W of the one who climb up and was in the wedding supper with hope they comment on was found guilty was bombed and cast into outer darkness only one way I believe I preached here not long ago whenever somebody gets married in the old country he given invitations himself he has to furnish the robes and when he met this man sitting here how many remember the parable he found a man at the supper table without a wedding garment on what is it the bridegroom stands at the door and all who comes up with an invitation no man can come to the Father except by me and when you come to the invitation so that everybody will look alike look alike not you better than Who am I suggesting who look alike watch watch whether they are rich or poor bond or free black or white male or female they are all one in Christ Jesus and the bridegroom stood at the door and received the invitation and put the rope around his fellow so the rich and the poor all look alike that's the way it is in the kingdom of God there's no big guys and little guys there's only one guy one Christ Jesus one in Christ or literally that so this money came to this back door and the master came as a friend how did you get in here when Oprah comment on Jesus said self he said he called to the port of Tainan photon ham he was cast into outer darkness where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that's Christ's own words he was cast out because it proved yeah we go without the wedding garment he comes some other way besides the door because if he come to the door he would have received the wedding garment he said oh listen to this then if the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how our Weaver will be going to be represented any other way you've got to come by Christ Jesus to me that truth the life Oh hallelujah but by some join in some church I never easy message and a brother branham what I sit with at the door you only gettin started the Bible he said he'd ever believe and tremble Oh hallelujah let's continue but here's one when I get to Revelation 1:10 3:13 I want you to notice the voice that he heard speaking to him had the clearness of a trumpet you know how our trumpet songs that give a shrill tone what does a trumpet mean question in the Bible what does a trumpet mean war any time you see a trumpet blow it is war in the by the time it is a song in meant a war then he went further either a revelation or something to take place so identify treating a war a revelation or something to say please all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord wonderful hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah praise be to Jesus thank you Lord Jesus give me some give you some we spent three okay let's continue Honolua come up here the war this is the setting of the great battle the people that rejected God's message rejected the Holy Spirit the messenger of the seven churches oh the one that had rejected this message of His grace has nothing left but judgment and that's why with the jubilee trumpet song those who don't wanna go free had to be bored in their ear so that they will have no more effect upon them they have to hear it and they can't be released from the condition because they choose not to go free all glory to God that's exactly right when it come to that sex pert set condition he does fifty-fifty still righteous still holy still or this is not skim milk Alleluia there's one that rejected his message of His grace but not only but judgment was ready while he was making ready to pour the plagues upon it come up here I will show you what was taking place hallelujah Moses had to act first before he saw the miracles did she humor boys had to have first before this holy fourth man in the fire they had to act on the wood so the world is not given to sit down just to think about until talk about and to explain about and to fellowship about the word confusion acts on it I'm but a short George sent me something I guess I think I'm gonna read it sometime not a night about a woman who came and she was too late for the prayer line and she was healed before of some disease or something like that and she come and me back and Byron was leaving my mom said the same God that he Leah the first thing will he go or what you have know or something like that and as she got healed three months later the miracle was performed on her and it brought brother George man who would take three months it took three months but it was done I said well I thought she was a believer she believed what the Prophet said Oh glory to God because of instant miracle and it have span of time miracles so what could give your miracle and it's already released to you praise God hallelujah praise God it already released you see it Laurie release that blind man he was already healed Oh blow it up caught him I take seven days ten days who eats one month three months one year it doesn't matter your family shall be delivered he released your miracle he came back your family already raised while you're waiting on that miracle but you are acting upon what God said thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God Joshua let's go back to this morning he march around the wall exactly like the chief captain told him the enemy must be was defeated because there was inside the wall but now he was going to get in how he'll get inside idea so he took a little stroll to meditate and then he's met a man he draw his sword and just what thought maybe this might wanted to be the enemy or whatever he join us on our you force are you against us and he said I am the captain of the host and he's told him what to do and it's a kind of hard thing to think watch that you could blow a trumpet and make a wall fall down awaiting the mother the instruction looking kind of flimsy that you could blow a trumpet and make a wall folder but the activity and God makes it simple and silly it goes from over the head of the limb it takes those unlearn that don't know very much to understand it but when you try to figure it out you can't figure it out you've got to take God's will for it do we said to do it not the way we think to do it but the way he said do it Oh glory to God when I bid you to shout shout and then shut them trumpets on them walls or glory to God I guess in science we're going to it know they might see how them and there is something about it Oh glory hallelujah he b-boys they sit upon the Word of God they said you should not bow down to any image they will not do it

not bowing down you obeying the words this is what we're talking about if God don't deliver you you're still staying with the word before the world is caught and when God saw those brothers under the fate upon the word he's I come to myself fourth man in the fire Oh glory to God to bless his sons who stands faithful for him and caught some some sons in the last days who are staying with that word I will show you a contingency of the world or give the Lord a shout o us confidence I hunt hallelujah glory to God they acted upon the Word of God and then Gordon gray brought that miracle Daniel

because God put your name on ordained you to beef nothing gonna stop the purpose that God raised your phone and this so it must be accomplished all glory to God to have long again just sex or to you tonight form Isaiah 58 verse 1 God speak and cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins yet the seek me daily until like to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and for the ordinances of their God the ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight and approach it to God wherefore have we fasted say they and though she is not God like a fast and like an idea see not where for how we are fitted it was all a no tickets no knowledge and then God speaks behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure exact all your Labor's behold you fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness you shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice to be denied in other words there's a fasting that makes your voice to be who deny I call fast an amplified prayer as when pray have volume on it oh let's continue in such a fast that I have chosen a different man to flick his soul is it the bottom is head as a blur to spread sackcloth and ashes under him we don't call this a fast an exceptional day to the Lord it's not this the fast I have chosen what for to lose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to deal I rented the hungry that don't bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when those here's the naked that don't cover him and on a high not thyself on my own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning then he'll shall spring forth speedily help and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be your rear award then thou shalt call and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am if thou will take away from the midst of thee do you can put it for the finger and speaking fancy if thou draw all thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted then that shall delight rise in obscurity my darkness piaster Lully and the Lord shall Kinkaid he continually and satisfy thy soul and drought and make fat i bones and thou shalt be like the water garden like the spring of water whose waters feel not until I shall be of thee shall build always places those shall raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shall be called the repairer of the breach to restorer of paths to dwell in we have a great ministry ahead a great calling ahead but it's a cost that goes with it I'm almost done Ezekiel 33 reading from verse 1 again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the share of Israel and said to them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their Watchmen well he see the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever here at the strong of the trumpet and take it not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his all here he heard the song of the trumpet took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he had taken warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blown up the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's and all so this give a different perspective now of this trumpet to be blown oh if the watch band or the trumpet and things happen God require at the watchman's hand the man saw Solomon so now verse 7 so sodaro Solomon I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear over at my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked a wicked man don't shall surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if the warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his iniquity but there was delivered I saw therefore thou son a man speak under the house of Israel does he speak sin if our transgression of all still be upon us and we pine away holy shall we live say unto them as I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but are the wicked till from his way and live turn me from your evil ways why will you die Oh hopes of Israel so if you see from these scriptures whatever burden for people to really repent because he wants to forgive he wants to restore he Steele he wants to bless do you believe that Isaiah 21 11 12 the buildin of Duma he cornered me or the seer watch man what of the night watchman one of the night the watchman said the morning coming and also the night if he/she will inquire in Peyer ye return come and in but abandon preach a message watched by one a night he says for and the day is talking about as soon as we get washed up and groomed up talk about people this traumatising we will meet at the tavern as usual and I'm sure John you are you all this to buy body message we here today watch 100 hour trying to make a tick to joy or door life when I tell us there's a push in danger because it was finally tower he seen something and these people want a party they want to drink and what not so he talking about people who talking about it with this watch man want to take away the joy from us he said know what and you know we have the best Happy Days I'm in our soldiers meet each night same place we enjoy fellowship together gambling a few drinks as for myself he said I would refuse to be alarmed about any of this stuff that this watchman would talk about or rabbis know about this or pastors and so on we believe that there will be a possible chance to Watchmen could be right this warning thing and warning thing you know we don't have to take that so serious do you know this this is Birdman on you know there's something about danger there's something about debt that seems to have a forewarning of it many times that loved ones before pass them across the other side a warning comes to them hallelujah Watchmen must be on duty at all times he was to warn the people of approaching dangers that was his duty to watch for Butch and Dena danger he was up in a tower I was built much higher than the walls and this tower had to be up there in it the books of astronomy and so forth he could watch the stars I'm telling the time any approaching time of the day he could tell it then he was you could see further than anyone on the ground he could see further he was up higher actually before they build the city walls they build a tower that's the first thing that that was he tall first thing so they kept pistol on the Bella tower a report was run up there and he watchin and even fightin and they watchin lien bricks the wall they built the kid indiscernible hoses d45 but at watch man you had to put him up there because he had to scan the horizon cuz I've always some demon some spirit some lights look in the sea they could come and take back get back get back revenge about all these that's just the nature of life and the Holy Spirit is that much man who is making ready the people and given warnings to God hallelujah that Watchmen have to be trained you have to know what he was doing for any distance as soon as he arose the enemy could detect it he could tell their walk he could tell their match he could tell their color he could tell that rank-and-file just as father Hume I could see could see it he was higher than the rest of them he was trained to know the enemy and God required the whole city as it had oh my position come up please oh praise God I'm closing I know you like read a lot of scriptures tonight but this is what I got flesh here with you tonight Lord trumpet shake yourself hallelujah second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance and Hebrews 12 this is all a scripture who is 18 for you are not coming to the mount that might be touched that Boone would fire no unto blackness and darkness and Tempest and the song of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice be heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they couldn't endure that what was commanded so if as much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned of trust to it at that so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but you a comment amongst I am under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and into an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and the chase of the firstborn which are written here and to God the judge of all under the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things at a Nevada see that they refused on him that speaketh for if they escaped not to refuse him a speaker how much more shall be not escape if we turn away from it must be from heaven whose voice men struck the earth but now he had promised yet once more I shake that little only but also heaven and this world yet points more simplified the removal of those things with a shitty-ass thing that I made that boosts things that cannot be shaken a mere me wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire let's all stand and give God some praises father we thank you
