[53:08] this morning so you happen to be in the
[53:10] house of the Lord today amen we'd like
[53:15] to welcome Saleem Jack invited by
[53:17] brother Barry where is Jack okay god
[53:21] bless you welcome to headstone
[53:23] tabernacle and we also have a note of
[53:25] praise from mother Mondays I like to
[53:28] thank God for the praise of the scenes I
[53:30] am back on my feet
[53:32] god bless you were the mothers
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:34] [Music]
[53:36] then a men a many many men you know and
[53:40] but the random said that to have a
[53:43] victory that must be a battle
[53:46] so to have a victorious life you must
[53:49] have a life as full of methyls and I'm
[53:51] more convinced than ever that the devil
[53:55] has a job to do so we ought not to be
[53:57] upset when he does his job but
[54:00] commensurate or in parallel with his job
[54:03] we also have a job to do and our job is
[54:06] to make his job harder and to overcome
[54:08] our job is to make him look like he's
[54:10] doing nothing and to win and his job
[54:12] because our story is already written the
[54:15] conclusion of his story is also written
[54:18] and the conclusion of our story is also
[54:21] written can the church say Amen amen so
[54:24] I bring greetings this morning in the
[54:26] precious name of Jesus Christ firstly
[54:29] from the believers in South Africa from
[54:31] Durban from Johannesburg from believe
[54:34] Cape Town's SATA hime and different
[54:36] IRA's in South Africa we were in a
[54:38] tremendous youth meeting in Dillon and
[54:40] the Lord really blessed I think it was
[54:43] on Sunday morning close to maybe around
[54:44] 500 or so people were there and it was
[54:47] really really a tremendous time I was
[54:49] able to speak us on the mornings on the
[54:51] evening then when the meeting was over
[54:53] and Tuesday night I spoke about a
[54:55] blessed Church and all over the world
[54:58] the Spirit is moving we men to the
[55:01] believers send their greetings but the
[55:04] players sense is greetings and the
[55:05] family matured with a Rhema
[55:06] Thompson family and church and the
[55:08] ministers over there and then I slipped
[55:10] over to Germany and last Sunday I spoke
[55:13] about the coulomb Rhenish which in
[55:15] Germany so where the : Rena sends his
[55:17] greetings his family and the church as
[55:19] well
[55:21] and it's certainly good to be back home
[55:24] and I was really blessed to hear the
[55:26] worship and the singing and the
[55:30] anointing and the atmosphere because
[55:32] that is what makes the difference is the
[55:33] anointing that makes a difference and I
[55:36] believe in my heart as brother Branham
[55:38] taught us the minister could never bring
[55:40] the revival there's no man of the hour
[55:42] who is pouring out and carrying out a
[55:44] revival it is still up to the people God
[55:47] you remove that privilege from men and
[55:49] please sit on the people so that you
[55:52] could call upon him whenever you have
[55:54] need and get a response and God loves
[55:56] that because he is a part of the
[55:58] audience he's a God who loves fellowship
[56:00] he's a God who loves relationship when
[56:02] he was there by himself he felt lonely
[56:05] he was not satisfied just to be there by
[56:07] himself and when he got the angels he
[56:10] still was not satisfied because he
[56:11] couldn't relate about your struggles he
[56:13] can relate because the angels had no
[56:15] struggles he angels have no trials but
[56:17] but when man came and man felt for the
[56:20] first time he could hear how rough your
[56:22] day was and how and what what trouble
[56:24] you had and he could extend himself and
[56:27] display his attributes ooh so God loves
[56:30] fellowship and and he loves when you
[56:32] call upon his name he loves it when we
[56:34] worship he loves it when we lift our
[56:37] hands and and when the ground said we
[56:39] defy gravity we defy the laws of nature
[56:43] when we bring pass our Normand and do
[56:46] something different I mean I'm a big
[56:48] believer in doing something different
[56:50] I'm a big believer in doing the
[56:52] unexpected I'm a big believer in
[56:54] breaking the routine so I said to the
[56:57] people if you are custom raising one
[56:59] hands raise both hands
[57:01] if you never raise both hands on one
[57:03] foot before tries out today
[57:07] I don't think Alda you saw me if you'll
[57:09] never raise board hands at one foot
[57:11] before it sounds crazy but doing
[57:16] something that's unexpected the devil
[57:19] dunno if you're coming if you're going
[57:20] if you're happy or you're sad you're in
[57:23] the middle of your trial was in the
[57:24] house of God and the devil is in trouble
[57:27] because you are here he tried to keep
[57:30] you out of home he you tried to tell you
[57:32] this is not working out he he tried to
[57:34] tell you there you're not gonna make it
[57:36] he tried to tell you to throw in the
[57:38] towel he tried to tell you to give up
[57:41] but something kept holding me holding on
[57:47] to me and he's not gonna let me go he's
[57:50] not gonna let you go because he knows
[57:53] your name he knows your every thought he
[57:57] knows who you are better than you know
[58:00] yourself blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:07] Oh hallelujah so are you ready for the
[58:12] word this morning
[58:13] are you excited about the Lord did you
[58:16] come to church this morning to spend the
[58:18] day in the presence of the Lord you
[58:21] forget about the bills you forget about
[58:23] the work you forget about tomorrow Bobby
[58:27] says take note thoughts even the
[58:30] Apostles didn't even think about what
[58:32] had to say because the spirit moved one
[58:35] of these days listen there'll be no more
[58:36] work no more house no more mortgage
[58:39] let's practice how that's gonna be today
[58:42] no more plaque me let's get let's try it
[58:45] out this morning oh then I have a care
[58:48] in this world to not have a stress or a
[58:51] child or worry about the budget or the
[58:54] price of diesel doesn't have nothing to
[58:57] do with it we come from an eternal
[58:59] Kingdom we perform any time our place we
[59:03] turn up when we need to move we can move
[59:09] like that faster than a plane faster
[59:12] than a rocket translation tape what
[59:15] didn't you see me next without world
[59:18] that's what in until it is made diesel
[59:23] come back to me this morning Oh what was
[59:26] on the inside expressed itself on the
[59:29] outside and one of these days this word
[59:32] that you have been worshipping this word
[59:35] you've been feasting on will transform
[59:37] itself from on the inside into these 16
[59:41] elements
[59:43] Oh give the Lord a hand of praise give
[59:46] the Lord a shout of praise
[59:48] that's only 5% give the Lord a shout of
[59:51] praise
[59:52] that's 45% give the Lord a shout of
[59:55] praise
[1:00:01] the Bible says he inhabits the praise of
[1:00:04] his people and I was praises his house
[1:00:10] praises his house he lives in the praise
[1:00:13] so when you praise you are creating a
[1:00:16] place for him to live he inhabits the
[1:00:19] praises of everybody what of his people
[1:00:23] he inhabits the praises of his people
[1:00:25] and his people are born to praise his
[1:00:29] people are born to worship his people
[1:00:32] know who he is Jesus saw the woman at
[1:00:35] the well the hour cometh and now is for
[1:00:38] the true worshipers the use of the word
[1:00:42] true would indicate that they are also
[1:00:44] false worshipers there are people who
[1:00:47] worship because it's what they're
[1:00:48] supposed to do that's not what I'm
[1:00:50] talking about the true worshipers
[1:00:53] worship from their belly their worship
[1:00:55] from all that's within them when I have
[1:00:57] money or don't have money he still
[1:01:00] deserves the worship when I woke up on
[1:01:02] the good side of the bed or the bad side
[1:01:05] of the bed he still deserves worship
[1:01:08] whether he can do what I asked for
[1:01:10] he didn't give me what I wanted he still
[1:01:13] deserves or ship what I've been in
[1:01:16] church for 40 years
[1:01:17] for one day he still deserves the
[1:01:20] worship because he has halfa years Omega
[1:01:24] he is the beginning is the end is the
[1:01:27] Rose of Sharon
[1:01:28] his name is wonderful he has pounced
[1:01:31] about he is Prince of Peace of he is
[1:01:34] your shield
[1:01:35] he is your reward he is your buckle up
[1:01:38] he is the shoe brand

[1:03:22] not leaving you in Egypt there's a
[1:03:25] promised land to be taken we are telling
[1:03:28] Pharaoh let my people go

[1:03:44] musicians thank you for the anthony if
[1:03:46] you have your bibles will you turn with
[1:03:50] me to two portions of scripture reading
[1:03:52] from the book of Genesis and the book of
[1:03:54] Revelation as the Prophet said there are
[1:04:03] two books in the Bible the devil hits so
[1:04:07] we are being very very deliberate this
[1:04:10] morning the devil hits the book of
[1:04:13] Genesis he it's the book of Revelation
[1:04:16] so we gonna take him on both sides this
[1:04:19] morning from the book of Genesis and to
[1:04:21] the book of Revelation Genesis 32 and
[1:04:24] reading verse 24 and Bible says and
[1:04:29] Jacob was left alone is that wonderful
[1:04:35] to be left alone away from your
[1:04:39] co-workers away from the church away
[1:04:42] from the believers left alone you and
[1:04:45] your thoughts you and your identity you
[1:04:48] and your mission you and your purpose
[1:04:50] you and God and Jacob was left alone and
[1:04:54] they wrestled a man with him until the
[1:04:56] breaking of the D and when he saw that
[1:04:59] he prevailed not against him he touched
[1:05:01] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[1:05:04] of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[1:05:07] wrestled with him and he said let me go
[1:05:10] this is the angel speaking for the day
[1:05:12] bring it and he said Jacob said I will
[1:05:15] not let me go except thou bless me and
[1:05:18] he said unto Him what is thy name and he
[1:05:22] said Jacob then he said and he said thy
[1:05:26] name shall be called no more Jacob but
[1:05:29] Israel for as a prince has thou power
[1:05:32] with God and with men and hast revealed
[1:05:36] reading revelation chapter 2 and reading
[1:05:39] verse 17 revelation 217 and it says here
[1:05:46] he
[1:05:47] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:05:51] spirit saith unto the churches to him
[1:05:54] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[1:05:57] the hidden manna and will give him a
[1:05:59] white stone and in the stone a new name
[1:06:02] written which no man knoweth save he
[1:06:05] that receiveth it made a lot of a
[1:06:07] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:06:09] may be seated this morning so I have a
[1:06:13] title this morning what is your name
[1:06:17] what is your name a subject the
[1:06:23] unfolding of the bride and an
[1:06:25] inspiration the mystery of who you are
[1:06:30] what is your name
[1:06:35] reading throughout the Bible starting
[1:06:39] from the book of Genesis just want to
[1:06:41] read this or two there in the beginning
[1:06:48] God created we know it's and God said
[1:06:50] let there be light going on to verse
[1:06:51] three and down to verse five it's the
[1:06:55] first time the process of a meme comes
[1:06:58] into play I'm going all the light D so
[1:07:03] the light was given a name and the
[1:07:05] darkness he called night so way back one
[1:07:10] of the first acts that God did was meme
[1:07:12] to name something and one of Adam's
[1:07:15] purposes so the purpose that Adam had in
[1:07:19] the beginning was to name the animals
[1:07:23] now a name can apply to animate as well
[1:07:27] as in animate objects so a human has a
[1:07:31] name an animal could have a name this
[1:07:34] has a name if I say chair something
[1:07:38] comes to your mind because it has a name
[1:07:43] names have three main purposes on the
[1:07:49] one hand a name is used to identify so I
[1:07:55] could walk up to brother George and say
[1:07:57] that is brother Terrence
[1:07:59] so the name identifies him so if you
[1:08:02] meet somebody for the first time that is
[1:08:05] who he is so the name can be used to
[1:08:08] identify a name can be used to refer so
[1:08:13] I could go out to buy the George and say
[1:08:14] by the George did you hear however the
[1:08:17] Terence was worshipping so the name now
[1:08:22] refers to him it's time identifying him
[1:08:24] he's already identified because he knows
[1:08:26] who he is
[1:08:28] know I could refer to him I can't refer
[1:08:31] to him unless he knows his name are you
[1:08:35] with me so a name can be used to
[1:08:38] identify a name can be used to refer and
[1:08:41] a name can also be used to address so I
[1:08:44] can say brother Terrence how is your
[1:08:47] walk with the Lord by calling for the
[1:08:51] Terrence I don't expect brother Mikey to
[1:08:53] answer because I was addressing him and
[1:08:57] throughout scripture we see these
[1:09:00] encounters and that's why I act with a
[1:09:02] tree to sing that song he knows my name
[1:09:08] [Applause]
[1:09:10] naming is powerful because a name is not
[1:09:14] just by what you are call and their
[1:09:16] different ways because the name also
[1:09:18] represents something so in different
[1:09:21] cultures around the world taking Africa
[1:09:24] for example when a child is born the
[1:09:27] father would walk around and meditate
[1:09:30] and look at the Stars and look at the
[1:09:32] child and we take a couple of days most
[1:09:35] times we have what's called a naming
[1:09:36] ceremony because the name you give to
[1:09:40] the child has significance it has it has
[1:09:43] meaning that's in the natural if you
[1:09:46] call it in a natural in the spiritual
[1:09:48] and the Bible and the Prophet speaks
[1:09:50] about it when those Ebru mother's give
[1:09:52] birth in birth pains they call the name
[1:09:56] I'm not even Joshua led by the spirit to
[1:10:00] change the policeman that their names
[1:10:02] place them in the promised land so names
[1:10:06] have great meaning what is your name
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:15] go through the scripture God meets Abram
[1:10:19] we call him Abraham but when God met him
[1:10:22] his name was Abraham but God knew his
[1:10:26] name and we read this scripture from
[1:10:30] which the tackle is taken this morning
[1:10:32] of this man called Jacob
[1:10:34] but the Branham refers to him quite a
[1:10:36] bit and his story is known I would
[1:10:39] expect by almost everyone Jacob the
[1:10:42] deceiver Jacob the liar
[1:10:45] Jacob the scamp Jacob the cheetah they
[1:10:49] call him Hawkins stuff and when it came
[1:10:52] time for the butch right
[1:10:55] his mother was complicit she was very
[1:10:59] much the hands was in the cookie jar
[1:11:03] because she loved this boy called Jacob
[1:11:06] and even God said from from before they
[1:11:10] were even here Jacob I love and Esau I
[1:11:15] hate it so there was something about
[1:11:18] this man Kim called Jacob all was not
[1:11:21] well with him but he was still loved by
[1:11:24] God but in growing up the Bible says one
[1:11:31] time Esau was out hunting and around
[1:11:34] that time is when the father Isaac was
[1:11:37] about to pronounce the blessing and when
[1:11:39] you got time you could go through it and
[1:11:41] during that time the mother saying you
[1:11:42] can go and get the blessing the Bible
[1:11:46] says that Jacob put on skin because his
[1:11:49] brother was hairy so he covered himself
[1:11:51] up so he could appear like his brother
[1:11:54] because he wanted the birthright
[1:11:57] but by custom the boots right would only
[1:12:00] go to the firstborn and Jacob was not
[1:12:03] the firstborn there were twins in their
[1:12:05] mother's womb but Esau was the fortunate
[1:12:07] one to come out first so Jacob didn't
[1:12:09] stand a chance but he was desperate to
[1:12:11] get this thing called the birthright it
[1:12:14] was a by any means necessary kind of
[1:12:17] things for him so but to jump to this
[1:12:27] spot after all and had been done it so
[1:12:30] happened and Isaac blessed him and the
[1:12:31] bush right went to Jacob and Jacob would
[1:12:35] have felt good because the blessings
[1:12:37] that Jacob pronounced could not have
[1:12:39] even been taken back the blessing that I
[1:12:43] said pronounced upon Jacob was it was
[1:12:45] spoken
[1:12:45] he couldn't even undo it and say I made
[1:12:49] a mistake it was supposed to be Esau
[1:12:51] here but I blessed Jacob Jacob got the
[1:12:54] word blessing and that covenant could
[1:12:57] not even be broken as I couldn't gonna
[1:13:00] say I made a missing and bless the wrong
[1:13:02] one the moment it was spoken and uttered
[1:13:05] the word took an effect upon Jacob's
[1:13:08] life and in his deceiving backslidden
[1:13:11] campus condition the words started to
[1:13:14] operate upon Zeke there was no undo
[1:13:17] button
[1:13:19] you may be seated for a minute you know
[1:13:22] how in Microsoft Word and Excel and
[1:13:26] these things you could undo there was no
[1:13:28] undo because when Isaac was blessing he
[1:13:31] was blessing peace and the law of God my
[1:13:35] word kind of returns void when I speak
[1:13:41] when I speak is got to happen so this is
[1:13:45] an encouragement to us even if you are
[1:13:47] here by mistake
[1:13:50] because Jacob was there by mistake even
[1:13:54] if you are here by mistake
[1:13:56] once the one step speak into your life
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:09] and the church say Amen everybody with
[1:14:12] me this morning
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:15] so Jacob is walking with the blessing
[1:14:18] and he's feeling good about himself his
[1:14:21] flocks are growing his his family is
[1:14:23] growing and then Esau just gets upset he
[1:14:28] said this thing not right and Jacob
[1:14:31] heard wood that Esau was coming to be
[1:14:34] with him
[1:14:34] the Bible says were the sheen that
[1:14:37] Jacobs has the same family this way sin
[1:14:40] flux this way you say you know what you
[1:14:42] go this way until everybody else had
[1:14:45] left him and as the Scripture we read
[1:14:48] Jacob was left on who and that's the
[1:14:53] problem with many of us in our Christian
[1:14:55] walk because God doesn't judge us in a
[1:14:58] group we hear it all the time it's an
[1:15:02] individual of fear it's between you and
[1:15:05] God your testimony is more valuable to
[1:15:09] God when you are alone
[1:15:11] your testimony listen in this
[1:15:14] environment but the Nepean is normally
[1:15:16] no it's not exceptional because you're
[1:15:20] supposed to put your hand up here but
[1:15:21] when you put your hands up in your house
[1:15:23] by yourself now that's exceptional
[1:15:31] there people say they have a test for
[1:15:34] trial with his brother with his sister
[1:15:36] in a church that's not no test because
[1:15:39] you're still in an environment where a
[1:15:41] certain level of behavior is expected
[1:15:43] but it's when you're not in the
[1:15:45] environment to be expected and you're on
[1:15:47] your job and there are no brethren to
[1:15:51] audit your behavior the pastor is not
[1:15:54] been the ELA is not there the minister
[1:15:58] is not there to put pressure you know
[1:16:02] the some young you'll see on the back
[1:16:03] one the back I don't know how to under
[1:16:07] fight that many times getting scared on
[1:16:09] the back home
[1:16:10] there's nobody to hold it back because
[1:16:13] you are left alone and in that moment
[1:16:18] when you are alone God could really deal
[1:16:20] with you and it comes down to the choice
[1:16:24] you make when you are alone - the Bible
[1:16:27] says dad Jacob was left alone and he
[1:16:30] wrestled all night the Battle of all
[1:16:34] night was based on the fact that he was
[1:16:36] afraid he was desperate he didn't want
[1:16:40] to meet he saw in the condition that he
[1:16:43] was in he couldn't afford to me he saw
[1:16:45] in the condition that he was into the
[1:16:49] Bible says he wrestled all night and
[1:16:53] what you'd understand he wasn't
[1:16:54] wrestling with mortal man he was
[1:16:57] wrestling with an angel
[1:16:59] you could tackle angels Jacob a normal
[1:17:04] man put so much pressure on angel he is
[1:17:08] at the back to go
[1:17:10] Jacob's desperation his desire his
[1:17:14] planning to be transformed was so great
[1:17:17] the angel at the actual mission and
[1:17:23] Jacob was so determined he gave the
[1:17:26] angel conditions is that I will not let
[1:17:30] you go until you bless me if we have to
[1:17:36] stay for a week we are moving but I'm
[1:17:39] not letting you call until
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:48] what will happen to the church if
[1:17:51] everybody comes to children's in Lourdes
[1:17:53] I'm not leaving here until you bless me
[1:17:57] I'm not letting you go
[1:18:00] I'll tell my son is delivered I'm not
[1:18:02] letting you go until I am delivered I'm
[1:18:06] not letting you go until I am healed he
[1:18:09] may be seated
[1:18:10] don't remember the Prophet give the
[1:18:12] story when they asked about the Holy
[1:18:14] Ghost and I said Lord if you don't fill
[1:18:17] me you're gonna find my bones right here
[1:18:20] that's the same quality of spirit that
[1:18:24] it takes to get the results and the
[1:18:29] church say man everybody feeling fine
[1:18:32] we're talking him on your name this
[1:18:34] morning the problem with Jacob is he did
[1:18:39] not know his name he thought he knew his
[1:18:45] name because your knowledge is limited
[1:18:48] by your past unless you are prophet to
[1:18:53] see in the future or like the prophets
[1:18:55] about back into the past your knowledge
[1:18:58] is limited to your existence think about
[1:19:02] it it's not like the angel didn't know
[1:19:03] who you was fighting but he asked him
[1:19:06] what is your name and the Bible says
[1:19:12] Jacob saying I'm Jacob and the angel his
[1:19:18] response was that's not your name
[1:19:22] [Music]
[1:19:23] what's happening here God saw it before
[1:19:27] there was a moon before there was a star
[1:19:29] this moment in time this battle has
[1:19:32] taken place this is not a surprise to
[1:19:34] God but this is the lecture even if your
[1:19:37] name is not Jacob your name is not a
[1:19:39] deceiver your name is not a scam your
[1:19:42] name is not a cheater
[1:19:43] you are Prince of course your name is
[1:19:45] Israel that is your name
[1:19:52] another preacher seal one time when Esau
[1:19:56] would ever meet Jacob and say you did
[1:19:58] this you did that you did that the man
[1:20:01] who was called Jacob is now Israel see
[1:20:04] that wasn't me
[1:20:05] my name is Israel if you're looking for
[1:20:08] Jacob go and look somewhere else for
[1:20:10] living that's not my name my name is
[1:20:15] Israel and we have many believers in the
[1:20:18] church who need to come to an
[1:20:21] understanding of who they are because
[1:20:23] they are walking around after years and
[1:20:25] the message saying my name is Jacob my
[1:20:27] name is Jacob and I'm here to let you
[1:20:29] know your name is not Jacob because you
[1:20:32] are born to overcome and to him that
[1:20:35] overcome when I grant undo name and your
[1:20:41] name identifies your characteristics
[1:20:43] your name speaks to your attributes your
[1:20:47] name speaks to what you could do your
[1:20:50] name speaks to your authority
[1:20:52] [Applause]
[1:20:56] you may be seated
[1:20:58] I'm laying a background for something
[1:21:00] what is your name the Bible says in
[1:21:05] Hebrews 11 by faith Noah
[1:21:09] by faith Abraham and you go down and you
[1:21:12] reach to Moses and the very story of
[1:21:16] Moses is by faith because the parents
[1:21:18] had to have feet that take Moses and put
[1:21:21] him in an aisle that was used to killing
[1:21:23] babies but they had to feet and they
[1:21:26] launched Moses out there the Bible says
[1:21:29] that Moses was trained in all that Egypt
[1:21:32] had but the Bible says by faith Moses
[1:21:36] refused to be called the son of
[1:21:41] Pharaoh's daughter to refuse to be
[1:21:49] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter men
[1:21:51] that Moses had a revelation that that's
[1:21:54] not my name now it's deeper than that
[1:21:59] friends because when you study the
[1:22:01] scripture think about it at that time
[1:22:05] your name was your power open the house
[1:22:09] in the name of the king as the son of
[1:22:13] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:22:15] it made Moses eligible for the throne
[1:22:17] but that temptation of power did not
[1:22:20] move him he said that's not my name
[1:22:24] as the son of Pharaoh's daughter he was
[1:22:27] entitled to the red carpet but the
[1:22:29] babies that he refused to be called the
[1:22:32] son of Pharaoh's daughter he said that's
[1:22:35] not my name when Moses walking around I
[1:22:38] said what's your name
[1:22:39] isn't that Moses that's not my name God
[1:22:42] give us some believers who will walk
[1:22:44] around and say what you calling me
[1:22:45] that's not my name
[1:22:47] Moses was offered the throne of Egypt
[1:22:50] the riches of Egypt the power of Egypt
[1:22:52] but that's not my name my name is
[1:22:56] different my name has a different power
[1:22:58] and the devil will give you all kinds of
[1:23:01] names it's time you start to declare
[1:23:03] that's not my name depression is not
[1:23:07] your name sickness not your name that's
[1:23:12] not your name unbeliever that's not your
[1:23:15] name make believer that's not your name
[1:23:18] true believer
[1:23:19] that's me overcome that's me
[1:23:23] victorious that's me church member
[1:23:26] that's not my name
[1:23:28] a non-believer that's not my name into
[1:23:33] the All Tomorrow's that's not my name
[1:23:36] bride of Jesus Christ that's my name
[1:23:39] what is your name
[1:23:45] what is your name who are you and the
[1:23:50] church say man you may be seated
[1:23:52] can we give the Lord a hand the praise
[1:23:54] so that's my little introduction this
[1:23:57] morning I love it when the bag was
[1:24:02] speaking about Jesus to come that I said
[1:24:05] and his name will be wonderful
[1:24:07] and he will be called counsel draw the
[1:24:11] whole Bible he was speaking about this
[1:24:13] name that was higher than every other
[1:24:15] name in so much in the name of Jesus
[1:24:19] demons are cast out in the name of Jesus
[1:24:23] every knee has the pot every tongue must
[1:24:27] confess that he is Lord that's the power
[1:24:30] of her name to this day when you hear
[1:24:33] certain names it creates certain
[1:24:35] thoughts history when you hear Hitler it
[1:24:37] means something when into another here
[1:24:40] Eric William it means something and
[1:24:42] that's just the name most people have
[1:24:44] not met Eric Williams but just the name
[1:24:46] creates a certain feeling that's how
[1:24:49] Jesus is and the name we said we
[1:24:52] introduced it a name could identify a
[1:24:54] name could refer and I name could
[1:24:57] address what did the Prophet say he said
[1:24:59] when you talk about him he comes near
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:06] so for most people the he has been
[1:25:09] identified when he's on a reefer is a
[1:25:12] bit closer because you can identify
[1:25:14] that's the president you can refer to
[1:25:17] him that's somewhat more because you
[1:25:19] refer to him but then when you address
[1:25:22] him that's the direct relationship mr.
[1:25:24] president can I have this can I have
[1:25:27] that and what we need to do in our
[1:25:29] Christian journey is move from him being
[1:25:32] identified to sing I want to be like
[1:25:35] Jesus to refer into Jesus
[1:25:37] he's a healer he's a savior that's
[1:25:39] wonderful but he want to reach the point
[1:25:41] we could have a conversation women said
[1:25:43] Jesus I love you Jesus I worship you the
[1:25:48] name above all other names counselor
[1:25:51] Prince of Peace Rose of Sharon lily of
[1:25:53] the valley that his name that's who he
[1:25:56] is
[1:25:56] that's his behavior that's his being
[1:25:59] that's his attributes and if we are to
[1:26:02] be bride of Jesus Christ it must also
[1:26:04] mean that our name and what we are call
[1:26:07] must also have attributes it must be
[1:26:10] that you are called overcomer it must be
[1:26:13] that you are victorious
[1:26:14] it must be can the church same
[1:26:20] [Applause]
[1:26:24] the mystery of who you are whatever the
[1:26:30] random say the Prophet said the names in
[1:26:33] the book is not the literal name he said
[1:26:35] it's not all my Nevel it's not leave him
[1:26:37] he said it's the mystery of who you are
[1:26:39] and when you read the Bible the Bible we
[1:26:42] preached before is a book of names but
[1:26:45] anybody looking at it didn't know what
[1:26:47] it was because it was a mystery to them
[1:26:49] that's why I'm speaking about the
[1:26:52] mystery of who you are so for years the
[1:26:55] scripture was there virgin shall
[1:26:56] conceive but if Ellen said scripture is
[1:27:01] mystery mystery of Scripture but it's
[1:27:03] also a name and for yes that name was
[1:27:08] there waiting for the person to be
[1:27:10] called that name so when Mary is walking
[1:27:14] to get some water that scripture is her
[1:27:16] name she doesn't know it yet until an
[1:27:19] angel comes to meet her and say Hail
[1:27:21] Mary tower highly favored a woman I'm an
[1:27:27] angel brought her name to her that angel
[1:27:30] called her name from in the book and
[1:27:33] identified that virgin will conceive
[1:27:36] that's you that is your name if I call
[1:27:40] you Mary but when God looks at you you
[1:27:43] are the virgin that will conceive and
[1:27:45] bring forth a son that's your name
[1:27:49] that's who you are
[1:27:52] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:27:54] anybody in the house is smaller suppose
[1:27:57] this is born they seem Moses who refuse
[1:28:01] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[1:28:02] daughter he didn't know his purpose he
[1:28:05] just knew that while he was in Egypt he
[1:28:07] didn't feel comfortable the pilot said
[1:28:10] he rejected the riches of Egypt to be
[1:28:13] like the mud of us as the Prophet call
[1:28:15] him he rejected the offer that they had
[1:28:18] for him because something in him was
[1:28:20] different he was trying to solve her his
[1:28:22] identity crisis of he knew that was not
[1:28:25] his name but he didn't know what his
[1:28:27] name was he knew he was not from the
[1:28:29] world but he needed to know
[1:28:31] Who am I he knew that he was not caused
[1:28:34] a drink and a smoke and to commit
[1:28:36] fornication and to commit adultery and
[1:28:39] to be a good Methodist and a strong
[1:28:42] Baptist and a tongue weekend Pentecostal
[1:28:45] he knew he was still exact but they had
[1:28:47] to come a point to Moses to hear Who am
[1:28:51] I
[1:28:52] anybody in the house this morning
[1:28:54] anybody in the house this morning
[1:28:57] supposes he refused to be called the son
[1:29:01] of Pharaoh's daughter and that's a first
[1:29:03] step I'm not of this world I might be in
[1:29:06] the world but I'm not of this world this
[1:29:08] one is not my home I don't know who I am
[1:29:11] yet but with a Branham said one name the
[1:29:14] bride will get to know who she is and
[1:29:16] when that happens then the rapture will
[1:29:20] go so we know we are not from the world
[1:29:22] we are not familiaris here we are not
[1:29:25] from this time we are from the empty we
[1:29:28] are from eternity we come from God we go
[1:29:31] back to court
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:38] or somebody get on a sauna praise
[1:29:41] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we
[1:29:48] didn't read it but when Jacob for the
[1:29:49] angel brother Anthony and interlock
[1:29:51] shake up what is your name said she
[1:29:53] could be said you'll be no longer called
[1:29:55] chica because Israel Jacob as he enter
[1:29:57] what is your name and the Bible says the
[1:30:00] angel didn't response he said oh you
[1:30:02] don't need to know my name but look at
[1:30:04] Moses Moses he runs away from Egypt he
[1:30:09] refused to eat he could have stayed and
[1:30:11] been on a nice throne in a nice kind a
[1:30:14] nice house and the battery knew all the
[1:30:17] science he knew all the religious you
[1:30:19] know order the philosophy and the
[1:30:21] history and he had all the degrees this
[1:30:23] was dr. Moses this was Prince Moses and
[1:30:26] and he rejected that he could have been
[1:30:28] well - he rejected that he could have
[1:30:31] been whatever you wanted the people he
[1:30:32] rejected that his name in Egypt gave him
[1:30:36] access listen carefully his name in
[1:30:39] Egypt gave him access to the wealth of
[1:30:41] Egypt
[1:30:43] his name in Egypt give him access to
[1:30:47] opportunities in Egypt strive for access
[1:30:52] and opportunity and power and wealth
[1:30:54] Moses his name as the son of Pharaoh's
[1:30:57] daughter gave him all of that but he
[1:31:00] refused it and walked a destiny not
[1:31:04] knowing where he was going
[1:31:05] a former Prince as it were a former
[1:31:09] wealthy man is there in the desert under
[1:31:13] a tent with his wife with his son with
[1:31:17] some chickens with some dogs with and
[1:31:20] then he sees a pudding bush he doesn't
[1:31:22] know what it is he knows what he's not
[1:31:24] but he doesn't know what he is he
[1:31:26] doesn't even know what it is so he said
[1:31:28] I will turn aside and see what this is
[1:31:32] this thing is strange but there's
[1:31:34] something attractive meter I don't know
[1:31:36] what it is let me turn aside and see
[1:31:39] this great sight
[1:31:40] and when he gets up there take off your
[1:31:44] shoes for when you're standing this is
[1:31:46] holy ground and Moses see wait a minute
[1:31:49] this is this feels us this feels
[1:31:52] different all my experience in Egypt pan
[1:31:55] compared with this all I saw in Egypt
[1:31:57] the science in Egypt can explain this
[1:32:01] you may be seated
[1:32:03] understand this all of his education all
[1:32:07] of his experience could not prepare him
[1:32:09] for what he encountered God being in a
[1:32:15] Minnesota Moses but the Branham said was
[1:32:17] a burning bush experience five minutes
[1:32:20] in the presence of God your life is
[1:32:21] changed forever and God began to tell
[1:32:24] Moses Moses I'm calling you to deliver
[1:32:26] the people Moses former politician
[1:32:29] former Prince former rulers in Lord I
[1:32:32] can't walk I am positive Moses they
[1:32:37] trained in speech but under the law of
[1:32:40] the pillars I see Laura catwalk and we
[1:32:43] preached this before when he was done
[1:32:45] God see any more excuses
[1:32:46] you're still going because you are born
[1:32:49] to be a deliverer and God took Moses
[1:32:52] through some experiences he dropped on
[1:32:55] your rod and and he showed them and then
[1:32:56] Moses a question who shall I see what is
[1:32:59] your name and God responded I am tell
[1:33:04] them I am that I am
[1:33:05] so Moses got the first key into this
[1:33:09] powerful name I am whatever you need you
[1:33:12] need healing
[1:33:13] I am your healing you need the LeBaron's
[1:33:15] I am your deliverance you need a
[1:33:17] breakthrough
[1:33:17] I am your break see you need the Holy
[1:33:19] Ghost I am the Holy Ghost you need power
[1:33:21] I am power you whatever you need that's
[1:33:24] what I am
[1:33:27] and Moses but the random tortoise that
[1:33:31] David Moses Abraham drawed scripture
[1:33:34] where the Knights had no clue of what
[1:33:37] they represented on the great plan of
[1:33:40] God they live their lives not knowing
[1:33:42] the purpose that he had but when God
[1:33:45] would have told Abraham that my seed was
[1:33:48] the gern in a strange land and with a
[1:33:50] mighty hand I would bring them out God
[1:33:52] was talking about Moses that was his
[1:33:56] name
[1:33:57] that was his mystery that was his
[1:34:00] scripture Moses just had to find it you
[1:34:04] have to find your word you have to find
[1:34:06] your scripture you have to find a
[1:34:08] mystery of who you are because that's
[1:34:10] the key to your revival that's the key
[1:34:12] to your breakthrough that's the key to
[1:34:14] you overcoming you have to know who you
[1:34:17] are because once you know who you are
[1:34:19] then the rapture is gonna go hallelujah
[1:34:24] where their parent auteurs Jesus have
[1:34:26] perfect faith which was peace in his
[1:34:28] position and your position is also based
[1:34:30] on who you are when you know your son of
[1:34:34] the king that gives you authority you
[1:34:37] can be the son of the President it
[1:34:38] doesn't matter if you slept outside your
[1:34:40] house last night you still the son of
[1:34:42] the president you can make a mess here
[1:34:44] it doesn't matter you are still the son
[1:34:46] of the President and we are children of
[1:34:48] the King our Father is the king of kings
[1:34:51] he is the lord of lords he is mighty in
[1:34:54] pattern and your mistakes your failures
[1:34:57] what you did wrong will not stop the
[1:35:00] plan of God concerning you from the
[1:35:02] moment you were born the prophecy of God
[1:35:05] hung over your life to bring you to the
[1:35:08] spot until you can realize
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:25] look at Jesus Jesus grew up as Joseph's
[1:35:29] son in fact there in script addressed is
[1:35:32] not this Joseph's son
[1:35:33] there was nothing spectacular about him
[1:35:36] when he was one two three four five six
[1:35:39] seven eight his only when he was in the
[1:35:41] temple and the parents came and they
[1:35:43] left him and they left him with the
[1:35:44] elders and the teachers and they forgot
[1:35:48] Jesus and they went and they realized
[1:35:50] that when they come back they came back
[1:35:52] to see the elders taking knows God Jesus
[1:35:57] confounded them they had no idea even
[1:36:01] then that they were speaking to the wood
[1:36:03] itself
[1:36:05] they just marveled he was just here
[1:36:07] fellowship and along the scriptures
[1:36:09] opening and see I never heard that one
[1:36:13] before I've been to so many seriously
[1:36:15] what that boy said is my but there was
[1:36:19] still no Marvel about him and the
[1:36:21] battery said it was his custom to go to
[1:36:23] church it's what the Bible says Jesus is
[1:36:27] in church just like we all in service
[1:36:29] this morning and in that day brother
[1:36:31] Stephen they would invite a young
[1:36:32] brother to take a chance
[1:36:35] cual every description it was normal so
[1:36:39] they call brother Jesus would you come
[1:36:42] they have no expectation of anything
[1:36:45] that he would do so Jesus just walks up
[1:36:48] find the scripture whatever any heart
[1:36:51] brother does share with any heart and
[1:36:52] find open the choice that one I want
[1:36:54] Isaiah 60:1
[1:36:58] oh yeah that service it was turnaround
[1:37:00] grittier brother and me turn around God
[1:37:02] bless you Jesus Simon David ding
[1:37:04] Jeremiah
[1:37:06] Ella who she's one of the brothers
[1:37:08] nobody knew who he was and he says to
[1:37:13] read Spirit of the Lord is upon me for
[1:37:17] he has anointed me to I when he finished
[1:37:26] reading everybody normal normal
[1:37:28] and when Jesus supposed but he said this
[1:37:30] Dida script is fulfilled and that's when
[1:37:34] the season changed what was it he found
[1:37:37] his scripture he found his name he found
[1:37:41] his message he found his ministry he
[1:37:44] found his purpose he found his identity
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:50] and that was when his ministry started
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:59] you see if you don't know who you are
[1:38:03] then you will never become all that you
[1:38:05] could be that's a problem to me people
[1:38:08] live in identity crisis in the message
[1:38:11] don't know who they are coming to church
[1:38:16] but don't know who you are because when
[1:38:18] you know who you are you can't be in any
[1:38:21] way you want to be here it takes me back
[1:38:24] to the story the Prophet said of the
[1:38:26] slave owners and the slave traders and
[1:38:28] this man came to buy slaves and he
[1:38:30] looking around and everybody just there
[1:38:32] they're there but there was one who says
[1:38:35] different so you say can i man I want to
[1:38:38] see he's not for sale does he eat better
[1:38:41] than everybody else no does he sleep
[1:38:43] anyway I don't know so what's about him
[1:38:46] I always wonder that myself until I
[1:38:48] found out that we're back in Africa his
[1:38:51] father is the king of the tribe and
[1:38:53] despite the fact that he is in America
[1:38:56] he knows he's a son of a king and he
[1:39:00] acts like one he knew who he was his
[1:39:04] environment didn't change who he was the
[1:39:07] food didn't change who he was the
[1:39:10] clothes he wore didn't change who he was
[1:39:13] where he slept didn't change who he was
[1:39:16] and when you get a revelation of who you
[1:39:18] are in God your house your car your job
[1:39:22] doesn't matter because you are some of
[1:39:25] the King
[1:39:27] and your inheritance is done here we
[1:39:31] shall reign on the earth that's become
[1:39:33] that's your inheritance
[1:39:34] that's your portion that's your promise
[1:39:37] can the church seaman
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:41] so cata revelation this morning so the
[1:39:46] Bible is a book of mysteries and every
[1:39:49] mystery has to be unfolded and Bible
[1:39:53] says in the days of the voice of the
[1:39:55] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:39:57] sound a mystery of God should be
[1:39:59] finished so we had a time when there are
[1:40:02] no more mysteries because the Prophet
[1:40:05] came to reveal every mystery so it'll be
[1:40:07] a mission to the world but to the bride
[1:40:09] instant one mystery because God has been
[1:40:12] revealing himself since Genesis he has
[1:40:14] been revealing himself and we have
[1:40:16] preached it before that God has a
[1:40:20] mystery he was too big he was too
[1:40:23] powerful to reveal himself all at once
[1:40:27] he was too majestic he's too mighty he's
[1:40:31] too powerful to come all at once at the
[1:40:36] beginning of time so he had to out for
[1:40:37] himself in pieces yet unfallen self in
[1:40:42] parts as it were yet then fall himself
[1:40:45] slowly because the world can handle all
[1:40:47] it was this power that's coming would be
[1:40:49] so great
[1:40:50] but the balance said it'll be a short
[1:40:52] quick message doctor shake the whole
[1:40:54] nation he's in a world when the
[1:40:56] neighbors are empty in the power
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:01] and in Jesus had attributes you know and
[1:41:03] it's a word but we are getting to
[1:41:05] somewhere and Jesus had attributes to be
[1:41:08] a deliverer
[1:41:08] how can he display that attribute of a
[1:41:12] deliverer
[1:41:13] so when Abraham showed us that all these
[1:41:16] characters in scripture in the world and
[1:41:18] in the message was God revealing himself
[1:41:21] in part so Moses was the deliverer that
[1:41:25] was the attribute of God as a deliverer
[1:41:27] in God was the attribute to be a
[1:41:29] shepherd so God had to find somebody to
[1:41:32] express this attribute of a shepherd so
[1:41:35] you found David and went even was living
[1:41:38] he was expressing his Shepherd attribute
[1:41:41] of God in quad was the attribute to be a
[1:41:44] warrior he said the battle is not yours
[1:41:47] but it's the Lord but the banner piece
[1:41:49] of message great warrior Joshua he said
[1:41:52] there was no warrior like Joshua Joshua
[1:41:55] represented the attribute of God as a
[1:41:58] warrior you know hear me this morning in
[1:42:01] God was the attribute to be prophet
[1:42:06] there's a mighty prophet in the Bible
[1:42:09] name is Elijah the prophetic ministry of
[1:42:12] Elijah is so powerful it's repeated its
[1:42:16] own five times in Scripture Elijah
[1:42:18] Elijah John the Baptist William Branham
[1:42:22] and Elijah to come and that was all
[1:42:24] reflecting the prophetic attribute that
[1:42:27] was locked up in God
[1:42:31] God was slowly unveiling himself in the
[1:42:35] simplest of ways using men who didn't
[1:42:38] know what they were doing but he was
[1:42:39] unveiling himself he was revealing
[1:42:42] himself when Solomon was writing all the
[1:42:45] great wisdom he was representing the
[1:42:48] great wisdom of God he was no man on
[1:42:50] earth as wise as Solomon that was God
[1:42:53] being expressed through Solomon and the
[1:42:56] church came in when shunga was fed up of
[1:43:02] the Philistines or whoever it was come
[1:43:04] in and take what he had come God took
[1:43:07] the Ox coat and he said listen
[1:43:09] enough is enough Sanga was expressing
[1:43:13] attribute of God to say enough is enough
[1:43:17] you have been troubling my people for
[1:43:19] too long all you don't hear me this
[1:43:22] morning
[1:43:23] Oh somebody pitch back to me somebody
[1:43:26] puts back to me
[1:43:29] they all had their scriptures they all
[1:43:32] had in ministries they all had their
[1:43:34] messages there'll be a voice of one
[1:43:36] crying in the wilderness of that
[1:43:38] scripture enough over until John the
[1:43:41] Baptist came and his ministry was
[1:43:43] unfolded every ministry was hidden in
[1:43:49] secret wrapped up in the mind of God the
[1:43:52] devil away she knows what Scripture is
[1:43:54] your scripture the devil wishes he knows
[1:43:57] what prophecy is your prophecy you may
[1:44:03] be seated for a minute when they found
[1:44:05] the scripture about deliverer when they
[1:44:08] heard a rumor
[1:44:09] there was a deliverer that's why Pharaoh
[1:44:12] such a killer all little children in the
[1:44:15] time of Jesus being born when the three
[1:44:17] wise men came down to Jerusalem and all
[1:44:20] that the reason they tried to kill the
[1:44:22] kids is because there was a rumor there
[1:44:25] was a scripture there's a prophecy and
[1:44:27] the devil always tries to figure out
[1:44:30] even with Jesus if they'll be if they'll
[1:44:33] be he didn't even know who Jesus was
[1:44:35] he didn't even know what Jesus purpose
[1:44:38] was and the devil doesn't know who you
[1:44:40] are he doesn't know what you I put my
[1:44:42] sins he doesn't know what your measure
[1:44:44] is
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:46] or somebody please back to me that's
[1:44:49] obviously if the devil knew what Jesus
[1:44:52] ministry was and if he understood what
[1:44:55] Jesus had to do the devil would have
[1:44:57] never let Jesus died he would have
[1:44:59] propped him up he would I make sure he
[1:45:01] stay as long as possible but the devil
[1:45:04] had no clue he doesn't understand the
[1:45:07] way God works because God said for my
[1:45:09] daughter I higher than your torture the
[1:45:12] devil has no idea and the mystery of who
[1:45:15] you are is she'll under the Seventh Seal
[1:45:18] hidden under the seven shield so that
[1:45:20] the devil could do nothing about it
[1:45:23] but the Branham said if I have a secret
[1:45:25] I don't want you to know about it I'm
[1:45:28] not gonna tell anybody so heaven went
[1:45:31] silent when you open the Seventh Seal
[1:45:33] There was silence in heaven because the
[1:45:36] mystery of who you are had to be
[1:45:38] unfolded but God didn't trust anybody
[1:45:41] with that secret because you are too
[1:45:44] important to him
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:46] [Music]

[1:49:34] passions just like you and me the same
[1:49:37] struggles that you go through Elijah
[1:49:40] went through the Bible called Stephen a
[1:49:43] man after God's own heart you may be
[1:49:45] seated
[1:49:46] read the sounds in the book of sounds
[1:49:50] you read and see every emotion that man
[1:49:55] could go through
[1:49:56] Lord how they are increase that trouble
[1:49:59] me Mary I need eyes up against me
[1:50:03] many Athena shades of my soul there's no
[1:50:07] help for him in God but but now Oh Lord
[1:50:10] are a shield for me isn't that what we
[1:50:13] go through
[1:50:14] he is the shear he is the buckler
[1:50:17] [Applause]
[1:50:23] and David was just a pot
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:28] Oh Oh somebody please back to me Oh
[1:50:33] downstairs in the back all over the
[1:50:36] pillar had some vision
[1:50:38] what is your name your name is overcomer
[1:50:41] your name is bride of Jesus Christ your
[1:50:44] name is a hidden mystery
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:53] [Applause]
[1:51:13] name above names name above names
[1:51:18] there's a reason sickness has names
[1:51:20] everything has a name and if you know
[1:51:22] the name then to expose the name and to
[1:51:25] bring the power of the name listen if a
[1:51:34] sergeant the balance' the authority of a
[1:51:37] police officer is based on his uniform
[1:51:40] and of what he represents so when he
[1:51:43] speaks he's speaking in the name of
[1:51:45] something so that's why in the country
[1:51:48] there's a commander-in-chief
[1:51:49] so take the British Army the the ships
[1:51:53] are each MS Her Majesty's service
[1:51:56] they're coming in the name of the Queen
[1:51:58] but there are different levels of names
[1:52:01] so the cancer is a name cancer can be
[1:52:08] identified you can refer to it and we
[1:52:11] can also speak to it
[1:52:22] depression is a name you can identify it
[1:52:26] you can co-ed adoptees seller you are
[1:52:27] depressed alright it's been identified
[1:52:30] you can refer to it but I my depression
[1:52:32] really really hammer under the roots and
[1:52:38] it has to come a point in your walk
[1:52:40] where you have to address it so even
[1:52:45] Jesus when he came to Legion what did he
[1:52:48] do he asks a question what is your name
[1:52:53] because he needed to understand what he
[1:52:55] was dealing with because once he knows
[1:52:58] the name and his name is a name above
[1:53:01] all other names
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:06] you are coming in a Hyomin you really
[1:53:09] didn't I give an example so a sergeant
[1:53:11] could be operating but if the
[1:53:14] Commissioner comes if the sergeant tell
[1:53:17] you pack your things all the car the
[1:53:19] commissioner speaks of a higher name
[1:53:22] because his position carries greater
[1:53:24] weight so you can say put it back and in
[1:53:27] sergeant car come and see I tell him no
[1:53:29] because the commissioners rank his
[1:53:31] authority his name is higher than the
[1:53:34] name of the sergeant by whose authority
[1:53:37] are you here when sergeant so-and-so
[1:53:39] never to come nowhere tell him the
[1:53:40] Commissioner told you it's ok because
[1:53:43] his name is higher than his name so when
[1:53:46] you read scripture and you study
[1:53:48] scripture Jesus is not a king the Bible
[1:53:55] discovers the King of Kings because of
[1:53:58] all kind of Kings but this one is
[1:54:00] different his kingship is bigger than
[1:54:04] other kingship
[1:54:09] that's why listen you may be seated
[1:54:11] sirrah called Abraham Lord as always
[1:54:16] teased my wife without him
[1:54:17] Sirocco Abraham Lord I'm still working
[1:54:24] that net that message I get home yet but
[1:54:29] Jesus is the Lord of lords King of Kings
[1:54:34] Lord of lords his name is higher than
[1:54:40] every other name so what is your problem
[1:54:43] this morning can we name them and if we
[1:54:45] can name them we could overcome them so
[1:54:51] if your trouble is lost this morning I
[1:54:53] speak the last I addressed earlier
[1:54:55] please by the name of all of the needs
[1:54:58] in the name of Jesus that lost demoness
[1:55:00] clap to call that demon of prancer by
[1:55:03] the name above every other name at the
[1:55:06] name of Jesus
[1:55:07] dancer has classic old Depression
[1:55:11] catechu flat-sided classical whatever it
[1:55:15] is we bring under subjection to the
[1:55:19] greatest power this world has ever seen
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:30] [Applause]
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:43] can we take someone so Elijah David
[1:55:49] Abraham they were all part part and
[1:55:52] Jesus came he was all and then the
[1:55:57] Prophet brought her all that was in God
[1:55:59] pour into Christ all of us in Christ
[1:56:04] porns is right this did not exist with
[1:56:09] Abraham this is it did not exist with
[1:56:12] David they could not have contained all
[1:56:17] they were just a part but what makes
[1:56:20] this unique is that this is private
[1:56:23] Okemo yes
[1:56:25] when Abraham when sorry when Adams today
[1:56:28] in the Garden of Eden and go out perform
[1:56:30] surgery and put Adam as with a daily
[1:56:35] spoke under anesthesia and perform
[1:56:37] surgery and cut off your rib and and
[1:56:41] when you wake up Eve walking around
[1:56:42] aimlessly in the garden and but the day
[1:56:45] they said Adam and Eve who are you I
[1:56:48] don't know where I come from I don't
[1:56:51] know where you're going
[1:56:52] I don't know Marilla said Adams all
[1:56:55] Eve's identity crisis said you are flesh
[1:56:58] of my flesh
[1:57:00] you are porn of my porn you are spirit
[1:57:04] of my spirit and because you were taken
[1:57:06] out of me he had to give her name you
[1:57:08] will be called woman because you have to
[1:57:11] have a name there's no name unless you
[1:57:13] know that nameless and he got of a meal
[1:57:16] but when God saw that God loved it
[1:57:20] and for all these years he has been
[1:57:23] waiting for his opportunity to be able
[1:57:25] to do like Adam you are flesh of my
[1:57:28] flesh you you are born of my own
[1:57:32] see you you are spirit of my spirit God
[1:57:36] have been waiting for centuries to be
[1:57:38] able to finally right lady who he could
[1:57:41] describe and that he have searched high
[1:57:44] and low
[1:57:45] he has searched all over until he can
[1:57:48] find somebody he can see you flesh of my
[1:57:52] flesh you pull of my bone
[1:57:54] you spread on my skirt this is a
[1:57:58] different relationship this is not
[1:58:00] Abraham and David no this is wife but
[1:58:04] Abraham said she is him they will be one
[1:58:08] so in the past even throughout after
[1:58:13] Jesus left Peter said in the name of
[1:58:16] Jesus rise up and walk
[1:58:17] what did it brother branham said he said
[1:58:20] he won't even need to say in Jesus name
[1:58:24] because she and him is one when she
[1:58:28] speaks is one speaking
[1:58:31] her name is as good as her husband's
[1:58:34] name it's a joint account
[1:58:40] see so many brothers shaken I wanted em
[1:58:44] join the contine listen we see the thing
[1:58:48] about this account is the call is

[2:02:59] the angel in whatever way you've been
[2:03:04] wrestling with the injured and it wasn't
[2:03:08] your own strength rustling but God is
[2:03:11] working his way out because you war he
[2:03:15] longs to express himself he has no eyes
[2:03:18] but your eyes he has no hands but your
[2:03:20] hands he has no feet but your feet he
[2:03:22] belongs to expressives to make himself
[2:03:25] known so you are going to make it don't
[2:03:28] be discouraged you have what it takes to
[2:03:31] have a testimony you have what it takes
[2:03:35] to have a testimony in this day and age
[2:03:38] can the church say Amen
[2:03:39] Oh give the Lord I have a praise not
[2:03:48] gonna be too much longer but you are the
[2:03:50] mystery that was in the back parts of
[2:03:52] God's mind your mystery tear family your
[2:03:57] mystery to your friends young people you
[2:03:58] are mystery and as a messenger people do
[2:04:01] remember that under 21st Saturday the
[2:04:03] 25th we have youth service and all are
[2:04:06] welcome but you are miss city of
[2:04:09] families your mission to your friends
[2:04:11] stop even trying to explain yourself to
[2:04:13] them because they cannot understand you
[2:04:17] we will never understand you what the
[2:04:21] world is not an explanation the world is
[2:04:23] alive because that's the funder that
[2:04:26] sheiks
[2:04:27] the devil you are God's mystery
[2:04:32] hallelujah the world cannot understand
[2:04:34] you you are the mystery of God can the
[2:04:37] church say Amen
[2:04:40] but the Branham said if you know
[2:04:42] positionally who you was and what you
[2:04:44] are tonight say today there wouldn't be
[2:04:47] a feeble person in here in the next five
[2:04:50] minutes so every service we are
[2:04:52] preaching the word to bring you to a
[2:04:55] spot to realize who you are to realize
[2:05:00] and we have to die out to our own
[2:05:02] feelings our emotions or perceptions
[2:05:05] even our our understanding because our
[2:05:07] understanding is limited what we could
[2:05:10] comprehend is unlimited and God is so
[2:05:13] simple that he doesn't require education
[2:05:15] to understand him so it's not about your
[2:05:17] intellect if God could take a prophet
[2:05:19] who was not educated to bring the
[2:05:21] greatest message to the it it's not
[2:05:23] about your education it's about
[2:05:25] surrender it's about surrendering
[2:05:27] completely to God can the church say
[2:05:30] Amen but Iran I'm in a message beginning
[2:05:34] and ending of the Gentile dispensation
[2:05:35] he says see we come out of eternity
[2:05:37] that's where we come from we was before

[2:05:42] made man in his own image where was you
[2:05:44] he said to Joe when Jobe thought he had
[2:05:46] some wisdom look hope with the random
[2:05:48] describes is when job thought he had
[2:05:50] some wisdom God had to remind you where
[2:05:54] was you when I laid a foundation
[2:05:57] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:06:00] Lord
[2:06:09] hmm the power of a name just thing
[2:06:12] friends that when Jesus stood at the
[2:06:14] grave of Lazarus where the Branham said
[2:06:16] if he didn't call Lazarus my name
[2:06:19] everybody was gonna come at the grave
[2:06:20] you know my my my my
[2:06:25] but he knows your name and every service
[2:06:29] we come to is the word calling your name
[2:06:32] so when you hear the word preach and you
[2:06:35] hear the word speaks about adoption you
[2:06:37] say wait a minute that's that's me you

[2:07:07] name of the Lord the musician we'll get
[2:07:10] ready I'm gonna keep you too much longer
[2:07:14] the mystery of who you are when I get to
[2:07:19] something here I have enough notes for
[2:07:23] two hours but
[2:07:30] Laurie I want to kneel along your name
[2:07:40] Bella Branham said in Mary's belief he
[2:07:43] promised in the last is that the church
[2:07:44] will grow so close from the days of
[2:07:46] Luther justification days of Wesley
[2:07:48] certification deeds of the Pentecost the
[2:07:51] restoration of gifts right into their
[2:07:52] headstone and truths that would bring
[2:07:55] forth the whole body the resurrection of
[2:07:57] every believer but as the Spirit of God
[2:08:00] grows closer just like the shadow of my
[2:08:02] hand the shadow gets darker and darker
[2:08:04] until the shadow and the hand becomes
[2:08:06] the same thing the church come from
[2:08:08] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:08:11] the Holy Ghost now going into the very
[2:08:13] headstone and the presence of the angel
[2:08:15] of God Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost so
[2:08:19] present doing exactly the same works and
[2:08:23] he did a huge which is bringing for the
[2:08:25] church and Christ to unite together just
[2:08:27] exactly like you promised don't let
[2:08:30] listen to the prophet your conscience
[2:08:32] beat down now wake up in smoke ability
[2:08:36] original CD says all right now here's
[2:08:37] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[2:08:39] reproduction bring forth of its kind
[2:08:41] these last days true church bride comes
[2:08:45] to the headstone will be the super
[2:08:47] Church a super race as they made a great
[2:08:50] answer that's your name that's
[2:08:51] describing you the same way scripture
[2:08:54] described everyone in the Bible this is
[2:08:57] your description as they need a great
[2:09:00] headstone super Church super ace they
[2:09:03] will be one even they will be in as very
[2:09:06] image in order to be united with him
[2:09:08] there will be the very manifestation of
[2:09:11] the word of the Living God
[2:09:13] that is your name you will be the very
[2:09:16] manifestation of the word of the Living
[2:09:19] God when you hear that you say that's me
[2:09:21] I will be the very manifestation of the
[2:09:25] word of the I want I want you to say it
[2:09:27] I will be the very manifestation
[2:09:30] of the world of the living god that's
[2:09:33] who you are that's your name so then
[2:09:36] once you know that that's your name you
[2:09:37] could begin like Moses to refuse every
[2:09:40] other name anything else
[2:09:43] is false anything else is off but the
[2:09:46] balance that denominations could never
[2:09:47] produce this they will produce their
[2:09:50] creeds and their dogmas mixed with the
[2:09:52] wood and bring a hybrid product then
[2:09:56] when they balance it from a little group
[2:09:57] a little group of the true seed of the
[2:10:00] world we know the court God will present
[2:10:03] Christ a beloved bride flesh of my flesh
[2:10:06] born of my bone spirit of my spirit a
[2:10:09] virgin of version of his would and
[2:10:11] through them and by them whip you fulfil
[2:10:15] all that has been promised for the word
[2:10:17] in the Virgin who knows no man may
[2:10:19] increase and dogmas that's your name
[2:10:22] that's who you are
[2:10:23] no madman Creek gone is not trusting no
[2:10:27] man with his lady
[2:10:29] it's his lady is his bride and she were
[2:10:32] not perfect but they ran a said be
[2:10:33] manhandled
[2:10:35] this is his lady you belong to God you
[2:10:39] are engaged to God but the Branum call
[2:10:41] it a wedding or the engagement ring of
[2:10:43] predestination the engagement and the
[2:10:46] wedding planner precision that's what
[2:10:48] was pleased on you before the foundation
[2:10:51] of the world and the devil is mad about
[2:10:53] it Oh hallelujah he's upset about it
[2:10:59] here is the secret the word is in the
[2:11:02] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[2:11:05] what he wants done with the wood and she
[2:11:07] does it in his name
[2:11:11] she has thus saith the Lord
[2:11:13] no one can persuade them different
[2:11:17] family cannot persuade you different
[2:11:19] your coworkers can persuade you
[2:11:21] different the young people cannot
[2:11:24] persuade you different they have thus
[2:11:26] saith the Lord or they keep still
[2:11:29] then they will do the works of God can
[2:11:32] the church seamen go ahead and waiting a
[2:11:36] long time for this super church that's
[2:11:39] your name you are part of that super
[2:11:41] church
[2:11:42] Oh hallelujah glory glory glory oh and
[2:11:48] your purpose will be accomplished and
[2:11:51] friends you can't run from it you can't
[2:11:55] hide from it and every move you step I
[2:11:57] sweated young people in South Africa you
[2:11:59] even realize you in an aquarium your
[2:12:04] every move is checked when you want to
[2:12:07] go this way I don't wanna go to church
[2:12:08] boo me at the wall all right boo me at
[2:12:12] the wall boom you hit a wall until I
[2:12:15] realized yeah you have nowhere to go
[2:12:16] because you are born on a different
[2:12:18] covenant you're born under you could try
[2:12:21] whatever you want when God said Jonah I
[2:12:24] have a work for you oh yeah do what I
[2:12:27] say that not not Mina
[2:12:28] I mean Jonah was supposed to go this way
[2:12:33] Joe and I had this way as quick as he
[2:12:34] could took out over attacked you
[2:12:35] whatever he took when the other way and
[2:12:37] end up on a ship the viruses and Jonah
[2:12:42] on this ship what I love about Jonah is
[2:12:44] that when DeStorm come do an if'
[2:12:46] pretending they're people who Peter is
[2:12:47] not them ignore the situation let him
[2:12:52] you know join say listen I am the
[2:12:54] problem throw me overboard and that is
[2:12:59] what shows he has seated on you know but
[2:13:01] the Branham said when a sheep for than a
[2:13:04] mud what does it do it cries it bleeds
[2:13:07] the Christ but when you put a pig any
[2:13:09] mud
[2:13:20] because he loves to wallow the Prophet
[2:13:22] said in that environment so it shows
[2:13:25] that Jonah is sheep because when these
[2:13:28] ships after Rock he recognized I am the
[2:13:30] problem that's it and we have to come to
[2:13:33] this spot analyzes in Lord I've been the
[2:13:35] problem
[2:13:37] God is the problem and they will preach
[2:13:40] some weeks ago and says people blame
[2:13:42] Gordon Gordon around is we but the brand
[2:13:44] said God never leaves us we any ones who
[2:13:46] walk away and he said if you want to get
[2:13:48] back with him go right back to the place
[2:13:51] that you left him what is your name
[2:14:00] this morning we know Jesus is his name
[2:14:07] but he is called wonderful he is called
[2:14:10] the counselor he is called so your name
[2:14:16] and I believe it but the Branham also
[2:14:19] said you have your name and his name you
[2:14:23] make for yourself the Bible said it's
[2:14:25] better to have a good thing then all
[2:14:27] said all other stuff all right
[2:14:28] so but what is your name there are
[2:14:32] people whose names identified by the
[2:14:34] behaviors when I was in primary school
[2:14:37] these are called me all kind of names
[2:14:41] read boy
[2:14:44] so if you commemorate by the new who was
[2:14:48] being referred to other thing is the
[2:14:51] same but this new comer square head
[2:14:55] [Music]
[2:15:06] but it Stephen you cannot get cookin
[2:15:08] another that was not my name but it was
[2:15:13] what I was called so his name is Jesus
[2:15:15] but he's called wonderful he's counselor
[2:15:17] right but our lives create a name for us
[2:15:22] is the naming me for yourself
[2:15:24] so like Jacob his name is Jacob but he
[2:15:26] was a deceiver in our lives in our
[2:15:30] marriages in our houses on the job
[2:15:33] we all have names it might be in a
[2:15:37] pleasant waiting nickname or few people
[2:15:40] give my college boy
[2:15:42] I rather they call me church boy than
[2:15:44] party boy because your name speaks to
[2:15:49] your life so when we read all these
[2:15:53] quotes and the Prophet said is not leave
[2:15:55] alone my never list that's not the name
[2:15:57] my name is the mystery of who you are
[2:15:58] the name is a new word John the Baptist
[2:16:03] his name is voice of one crying out in
[2:16:06] the world as we call him John but his
[2:16:07] name is voice of one crying in the
[2:16:09] wilderness
[2:16:09] that's his identification he could find
[2:16:12] where it's written so too
[2:16:14] you need to look at your life and be
[2:16:17] able like Jacob to say well my name is
[2:16:20] Jacob
[2:16:21] but there's another name because you
[2:16:25] have overcome your past you have
[2:16:27] overcome your weakness you overcome some
[2:16:30] people that name is duty could you
[2:16:35] always duty in some places you see lead
[2:16:40] comma just reach
[2:16:46] it's not what your name is was what they
[2:16:48] call you is still identified by the same
[2:16:49] thing but if that's your Testament is
[2:16:51] that is that your name what is your name
[2:16:55] your name is player L player a player
[2:16:58] and we live in a world where people take
[2:17:01] on names on their lives
[2:17:04] I'm shutter key laughs that is your name
[2:17:10] is that what you want to be cool on that
[2:17:13] great day when were like what what did
[2:17:16] they call it because your name is called
[2:17:17] by your life so that's why when Jesus is
[2:17:20] described he's described as wonderful
[2:17:22] counselor because the name is the
[2:17:25] descriptions of his activities behave
[2:17:27] his nature so you can identify it so all
[2:17:30] that's wonderful in your life that's
[2:17:31] Jesus counselor mighty God everlasting
[2:17:35] father Prince of Peace when people say
[2:17:39] George kangri what do they say when they
[2:17:43] say eyes are covered what do they say
[2:17:44] when they say money what do they say
[2:17:46] about you what is your name your name is
[2:17:52] your testimony their people have stood
[2:17:58] in funerals and services and we can poll
[2:18:02] and see one thing we could see he was a
[2:18:03] prayer warrior so he can attach that to
[2:18:08] your name what do we attach to your name
[2:18:12] today what is your name is it great
[2:18:16] warrior is it I've never said she was a
[2:18:21] real seed she loved the Lord all of time
[2:18:25] you could hear tippling in the
[2:18:27] background what is your name do you have
[2:18:32] one name in church and another name
[2:18:35] Anuja some ham I'm brother John
[2:18:41] but in work to puck
[2:18:47] and instead of being like Moses and
[2:18:50] Hebrews who refused to be called the son
[2:18:54] of Pharaoh's daughter the Bible says
[2:18:56] what nîmes are you rejecting your name
[2:19:02] is not movie watcher your name is not
[2:19:07] social drinker your name is not
[2:19:11] compromiser your name is not trying to
[2:19:14] fit in in fact with the brand name use
[2:19:16] another name to describe us he called us
[2:19:18] alcohol that's my name if you don't want
[2:19:25] to call me Isaac call me up walk we
[2:19:31] talked about Joshua what's his name but
[2:19:33] they're random attached great warrior to
[2:19:35] it great warrior Joshua so if you walk
[2:19:39] to the camps of the truth of Israel and
[2:19:41] you don't know his name you see where is
[2:19:43] the great warrior and they could point
[2:19:45] you in the direction of Joshua because
[2:19:50] his behavior his conduct his attribute
[2:19:52] brought his name to life
[2:19:55] we're the random taught us your name is
[2:19:58] the Michelle who you are and the most
[2:20:03] important theme is not the name if you
[2:20:04] were given it's a name that you make for
[2:20:06] yourself Lord we have the name of pray
[2:20:11] warrior Lord let me have a name of
[2:20:14] overcomer because the purposes of the
[2:20:16] him that overcometh will I give a new
[2:20:18] name that only he will know in fact the
[2:20:24] Prophet frozen when Jesus overcame he
[2:20:27] also ascended and received a new name
[2:20:29] that's why the prophecy that's where the
[2:20:30] Hollande showed the way they do and they
[2:20:32] don't get their presence er but that
[2:20:34] neighbor very feelin abundance that's
[2:20:38] the message
[2:20:41] this applies beyond applying it in the
[2:20:45] context of church Petropolis their life
[2:20:48] as a husband as a wife as a young person
[2:20:52] as a son as a daughter as someone on
[2:20:54] your job in your school what name are
[2:20:56] you known by what is your name it might
[2:21:00] sound rough when they say your Chili's
[2:21:02] boy and you're boring let boring be my
[2:21:04] name if boring keeps you away from the
[2:21:06] world take what Moses did because Moses
[2:21:15] rejected do you know how tempting it is
[2:21:18] to be fair what if more so I say you
[2:21:20] know if I could be fair oh you know I
[2:21:22] could release the children of Israel you
[2:21:25] know much thought sort of going through
[2:21:26] his mind as his son of Pharaoh's
[2:21:28] daughter but the Bible says he rejected
[2:21:30] the riches he rejected a temptation he
[2:21:32] refused to be called the son of
[2:21:34] Pharaoh's daughter and preferred being
[2:21:38] identified with the slaves Moses his
[2:21:45] greatest achievement greatest
[2:21:47] achievement is saying no because he had
[2:21:50] not said no there would be no tablets
[2:21:52] with the commandments Moses wrote the
[2:21:55] first five books of the Bible that he
[2:21:57] had not said no who would have written
[2:22:00] those books thank God that Moses said no
[2:22:04] thank God and Moses refused to be called
[2:22:07] the son of Pharaoh's daughter we can be
[2:22:10] born in this world but we are not of
[2:22:12] this world we reject what the devil
[2:22:15] places upon us we reject the temptation
[2:22:19] and desires it's so simple but it's
[2:22:23] choking our lives you have books and
[2:22:27] teeth with your praises choked because
[2:22:29] you are taking on other names trying to
[2:22:34] sound like the world trying to be like
[2:22:36] the world what is your name is your name
[2:22:43] as a father never around
[2:22:53] where's your name example my father is a
[2:22:56] good example it's okay to talk about
[2:23:02] what you did not have I remember years
[2:23:05] when I was young maybe eight nine years
[2:23:06] old and I'm old brother 50 some years
[2:23:08] would say he still can overcome hope his
[2:23:11] father didn't give it my long pants and
[2:23:14] it might sound maybe funny and one is a
[2:23:17] extent but that was his testimony but it
[2:23:21] has to come a point where you shake that
[2:23:23] off and decide what you do for your
[2:23:25] children because you can't change the
[2:23:29] past you cannot go back in the past Paul
[2:23:33] taught us to forget the things of the
[2:23:35] past he said I reach I stretch I press
[2:23:39] my way towards before the beautiful
[2:23:44] thing about Jacob is his name change
[2:23:46] overnight and that's what I'm looking
[2:23:50] for in my life what I'm looking for in
[2:23:54] your life that you're gonna walk into
[2:23:56] this service with one name and leave
[2:23:58] this service with another name so now
[2:24:02] when the devil might be looking for you
[2:24:04] under your only when you walk out you
[2:24:06] can walk straight pass him and say I
[2:24:08] don't know who you talking about
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:14] if you want to check for that guy you
[2:24:16] can look for him but he's no longer here
[2:24:18] that guy doesn't live in this house
[2:24:20] anymore in this house lives the Holy
[2:24:22] Ghost and this houses sheets lets you
[2:24:25] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[2:24:27] brotherly kindness charity the Lord sits
[2:24:31] on the throne of my heart that's the old
[2:24:34] man I put away the old man my name has
[2:24:38] been changed my identity has been
[2:24:40] changed my nature
[2:24:41] has been changed that's what the Holy
[2:24:44] Ghost is given so young people don't
[2:24:49] Emily do it this thing about names is a
[2:24:52] powerful thing all these artists young
[2:25:00] people I'm gonna speak it on people for
[2:25:01] a little bit all these artists why is it
[2:25:05] they change their names we could go into
[2:25:11] that in a long way but many things are
[2:25:12] connected and such deep spiritualization
[2:25:15] you have no idea and people put names on
[2:25:24] the children based on movies based on
[2:25:28] artists based on books written by
[2:25:31] demon-possessed people and they place
[2:25:34] these names on their children so the
[2:25:38] Prophet taught us give your child a good
[2:25:41] name
[2:25:43] but we are not talking right now but
[2:25:45] what you are called on people what about
[2:25:48] the name you make for yourself let your
[2:25:50] name be a testimony
[2:25:51] let's when people mention your name they
[2:25:54] think of honesty you think of truth they
[2:25:57] think of righteousness they think of
[2:26:00] peace they think of a prayer life
[2:26:02] let them associate you with Christianity
[2:26:04] how many young people don't want to be
[2:26:05] known as Christian what's wrong with you
[2:26:09] this is the best thing you could ever
[2:26:11] decide to do I have decided to follow
[2:26:14] Jesus and not just be a Christian but to
[2:26:20] have this message and not be blinded and
[2:26:25] to have the truth that is a rapture
[2:26:27] coming I have the truth that the Holy
[2:26:30] Ghost is mentored well in us and control
[2:26:32] us that all age is waiting for us to
[2:26:36] come to perfection whether brother
[2:26:38] Branham is waiting on you and I
[2:26:39] Abraham is waiting and you and I to come
[2:26:42] to perfection to bring on the
[2:26:43] resurrection that's my name that's my
[2:26:49] purpose that's what I'm supposed to do
[2:26:51] or maybe change your walk this morning
[2:26:55] change your walk when Jacobs name was
[2:26:58] change his walk change he was out of
[2:27:01] joint so it's not just a teen of your
[2:27:05] name and your behavior but your walk is
[2:27:06] different your talk is different and you
[2:27:10] have to be willing to give it up
[2:27:12] willing to give up what you hold dear
[2:27:15] willing all for the cross beam is
[2:27:18] healing can begin to play something
[2:27:19] softly I want to give you a challenge
[2:27:26] this week for words that's not my name
[2:27:35] when the music comes when the temptation
[2:27:37] come when you feel like gossiping that's
[2:27:39] not my name gossip is not my name doubt
[2:27:42] is not my name unbelief is not my name
[2:27:46] this week is gonna be the best week of
[2:27:48] your life when depression comes that's
[2:27:50] got my name frustration that's of my
[2:27:52] name black bean that's not my name
[2:27:54] I'm not accepting that name when you get
[2:28:00] down time to in your private moments of
[2:28:03] Prayer and as everyone to bring other
[2:28:05] stuff for you to do that's not my name
[2:28:07] and something on the inside begins to
[2:28:10] take over and you press your way because
[2:28:13] you want a relationship with God what
[2:28:16] good is it to come to church and go home
[2:28:18] to see what use is it to come to the
[2:28:22] house of God and go home the same but
[2:28:27] the Brandon said you can't even come to
[2:28:29] the presence of God and go home the same
[2:28:30] you change either for the better for the
[2:28:33] worse and I'll close it with this I said
[2:28:36] it I believe a couple Sundays ago I said
[2:28:38] it's the most painful Scripture I've
[2:28:39] read in my life when I saw it the way
[2:28:42] that I did because you would normally
[2:28:46] think that when you meet Jesus
[2:28:47] everything is all right you would feel
[2:28:50] aware he would come to Jesus your
[2:28:51] questions will be answered you would
[2:28:53] think that when you come to Jesus you
[2:28:54] will leave knowing that all it's gonna
[2:28:57] be all right but when the rich young
[2:29:00] ruler came up to Jesus he came as it
[2:29:04] were with a sincere heart he said Lord
[2:29:07] what must I do to get eternal life and
[2:29:12] he was asking for something and we ought
[2:29:13] to be pressing our lives too and make
[2:29:16] our pricey lord I want eternal life lord
[2:29:19] I want the whole it was Lord I want to
[2:29:21] be different
[2:29:21] Laura what must I do and Jesus looked at
[2:29:25] him the wood made flesh and said obey
[2:29:29] the commandments honor your father and
[2:29:31] mother couldn't do the law and the old
[2:29:35] men said I've done that from my youth
[2:29:37] but
[2:29:38] and I'm not missing something what lack
[2:29:41] I yet and the word itself a discerner of
[2:29:46] the thoughts and a heart begin to scan
[2:29:48] his life as it were like the world is
[2:29:51] scanning our lives this morning scanning
[2:29:55] all of our lives a spiritual x-ray as it
[2:29:58] was to get a deeper look and where the
[2:30:03] luck is in me where the luck is in you
[2:30:06] and Jesus said to him sell all you have
[2:30:09] and give to the poor and the saddest
[2:30:13] scripture in the Bible to me this man
[2:30:18] walked away from Jesus sorrowful how
[2:30:22] could you walk away from Jesus said how
[2:30:26] could you walk away from Jesus without
[2:30:28] help how can you walk away from Jesus
[2:30:31] without getting your problem so how
[2:30:34] could you walk away from Jesus
[2:30:35] disappointed how can you walk away from
[2:30:38] Jesus and still be sick how could you
[2:30:40] walk away from Jesus and not get an
[2:30:43] answer to your problem
[2:30:44] how could you walk away from Jesus and
[2:30:46] I'd want to do something about your
[2:30:49] trouble when the word identified your
[2:30:53] trouble by name
[2:30:56] Jesus identified what his trouble was
[2:30:58] and he walked away sorrowful friends
[2:31:02] don't leave their service disappointed
[2:31:04] don't lean a service without getting
[2:31:08] their answers you need to take you to
[2:31:11] where you need to be in Christ I
[2:31:13] challenge you father mother brother
[2:31:15] sister young person old the word has
[2:31:19] spoken this morning and every Sunday
[2:31:20] every service the word speaks to you get
[2:31:24] your life right with God get your heart
[2:31:27] right with God what is your name I'll
[2:31:34] close with this I believe was the sons
[2:31:36] of sceva but time I cast out Devils and
[2:31:42] the devil spoke to them Jesus I know my
[2:31:47] name pizza I know who are you
[2:31:51] [Music]

[2:31:55] devil must know your name and when your
[2:32:03] life has power the devil will take note
[2:32:07] that your life has power
[2:32:10] and the batteries that you shall receive
[2:32:12] power after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[2:32:15] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
