to ear to your people may they hear from the word may they hear from you today as if they are hearing right out from the prophetic utterance of the old testament right on to the new testament father maria does here the law this morning we didn't come here with our own thoughts and ideas we believe that what you have given unto us lord you want to bless your people with it father inspire it take it like bread and multiply it in the hearts and eyes of your children in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you and welcome this morning to our sunday morning feast so good to have each and every one of you here this morning and if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to philippians chapter 2 1 from 12 to 16. hebrews chapter 4 we want to read 1-11 and second peter 1 just one first day of verse 10. so read in philippians chapter 2 so glad to see you all out we don't have just dry weather christians it's raining sunshine let there be sunshine in your soul amen praise the lord so philippians chapter 2 we want to read from verse 12. okay wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputants that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in amidst a crooked and professed nation among whom he shines lights in the world holin fought the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain and from hebrews chapter 1 chapter 4 rather verse 1 let us therefore fear at least a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with fate in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my rat if they shall enter into my rest although the works will finish from the foundation of the world for he is spake in a sitting place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached ended not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it is said today if you hear his voice had not your heart for if jesus had given them rest then would he not have afterwards spoken of another day there remain that therefore arrest to the people of god for he that say it for he that is entered into his rest notices his rest he also had ceased on his own works as god did from his and there's a voice i want to get to let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief our last scripture from second peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election show for if you do these things you shall never fall may god bless this word you may be seated praise the name of the lord so praise god so have a title this morning work out your own salvation with fear and trembling that's the title we have this morning work out your own salvation with fear and trembling have an inspiration let us labor to enter into that rest and that that that verse that inspiration we find out is from the hebrew scripture we we read have a subject make a call on the election show and that is what we get from second peter 1 10. so it is i have uh two context scriptures second timothy three one to nine you can write it down if you want second corinthians chapter seven verse one so we find out that god puts a seed and the object after the seed even though the seeds have great potential i want to listen carefully even though the seed is the seed the seed is original the seed of great potential unless the life of the seed unfolds it just remains a seed so you have to go beyond seeing god's word as a seed what you have to be concerned about is the unfolding of the life of that seed and for the life to unfold there's a debt required the debt of a corner wheat there is no way or wrong it there's no way you can't explain this away this is the reality of what it is it is what it is deliberated and when you have issues and challenges you deal as you find out it is what it is deal with it isn't that right so let us labor therefore into that rest it's a work it's a job it's a responsibility there is no free ride and hebrews 4 11 that last verse and the amplified says let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves so that that is not being laid back that is not being thoughtful or lazy let us therefore be zealous that is being enthused so you can't have a deadbeat attitude you know whatever go go whatever will be k sarah whatever we will be not that let us be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter into that rest of god to know and experience it for ourselves so you don't want to hear god was with a prophet and god with this one and that one you want to know god with you because you have to make your calling an election show so this is not to the church this is the individuals this message is to individuals this is not addressing church no church can make their calling and election show anytime you hear calling an election that's an individual because you as an individual is who's elected we're not talking about your wife your husband your chair and your family you as an individual is elected god called abraham who if on you he called he called you you have a responsibility for the calling of god upon your life glory to god the devil didn't call you you didn't just drop a wrong and you're hanging wrong no god called you not no pastor called you not no evangelist call you not no minister call you god himself call you you you you sitting here this morning oh glory to god i look at where your mother is who your father is they didn't call you no man can come except the father make a pull make a draw it's god himself you're wretched but he called you your back says what he called you you're this way and that way but he called you you up your tongue but he called you who he phoned you he called do i hear a shout in the house this ought to get everybody on fire don't read the god i ain't talking about your feeling call i'm talking about god call you you didn't feel nothing something happened and turn on your soul that's why you react to the gospel that's why you're responding to the gospel because god himself called you [Applause] know the same god that called you same god as your seed begin to unfold or the life when you begin to unfold you have different situations and conditions and challenges there's doubts there are fears there are certain things depression and frustration that same god i'd call you that same god in this world say make your calling an election show get a confirmation of it and when you get a confirmation of it no devil could move you i don't care what the ten thousand fall on your right side you shall not be moved oh glory to god as my david said is the confidence do i walk to the valley of the shadow of them i shall fear no evil for the lord with me thy run and stuff they comfort me oh glory to god don't be perish in the presence of my enemies my cup running over surely goodness and mercy that's a man who knows calling that a man who knows calling election show or could you give the lord a shout in the house that's why david said restore unto me the joy of my salvation take not thy holy spirit from me [Music] glory glory that's when our man nick is calling an election sure you know what there is no ten thousand following my rights i shall not be moved i'm not gonna do with that that they're shaking my that it's stumbling me i don't have ten thousand backslides that i shaken my faith [Applause] i shall not be moved i shall not be true blessed is the man who walketh not in the country of the ungodly nor stand in the way of sinners but is enlightened in the law of the lord and in that law that he meditated day and night he shall be like a tree not drop down planted anchored do you want to be like that [Applause] that same god that called you say work out your own salvation no pastor i could work that out for you no bishop no preacher no church people are hiding church there's hiding groups there's heidi and ministers and pastors they're hiding but the bible said work it out who don't work it out i took it out for you that is your maths problem you work it out i have minds to work out oh give the lord some praises [Applause] let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest of god to know and experience it for ourselves that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience unto which those in the wilderness fell philippians 2 12 the bible talked about therefore okay just back a little bit let's see wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed this is good believers this is healthy believers paul said i know you as obey the word when i am wrong when i dear not just being dear but even in my absence and watch wherefore my beloved as you have obeyed this is not it's not crazy people he's talking to now this is believers not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling there's a way you know what he said don't take takes for granted don't don't feel you're entitled work work your work work out your own salvation you have a work to do and i want to hit you with that this morning you have a work to do your work is at the sitting and here i'm here and you hear any word and you hear any word you have to more work than that you're hearing that you're gonna know what to do come on now give the lord a shout on that you hearing word that you might know what to do all right so this isn't amplified now therefore my dear ones as you've always obeyed my suggestions so now not only with the enthusiasm you would show in my presence but much more because i am absent and this is the amplified work out cultivate carry out to the goal and fully complete your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling self-distrust with serious caution tenderness of conscience watchfulness against temptation timidly striking from whatever might offend god hallelujah working out cultivate adding to your feet doing something about your life you're not static you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not in a way of making no progress when god says every place you put your foot is yours and you're standing still and you're standing still get in your own fight you fight with this one you fight with that one you fight with it no fight for yourself you're giving your own self trouble and you're not even looking at yourself you believe in this one that will be like you blame this one blame this one you're looking for somebody to point your finger out and and when you point that one finger three forties fingers pointing back at you first peter 4 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god russia has certain judgment you know judgment started in god's house first i said putin could do what you want to do 30 bombs do this but drama had to start in god's house because where the issue of god going forward remember in god's house have more authority than prime you know a word from the lord could come to address nations kingdoms give me a scripture revelation 10 11 don't must prophesy again the nation kingdom tongues peoples god could bring prophetic utterances in this nation any nation any people anywhere that cannot fail because god cannot lie god himself come down in his last day to ensure that despite naked he has said no other angel the lord himself descended praise god with that book open to call your name you know what is tremendous calling your name is like calling the seed but the path that you have to play is to see that seed unfold [Applause] so you can say how much potential you have and we know you have potential we know you have what god given trace and ability it's still locked up but if it's laying on this table here nothing happening all we can say is i see you know like i see that god like that child but nothing hit you yet to unfold i recognize entitlements occasionally it's a curse that'll be upon our children or family or loved ones when you went to your own piece of hell and you went through what kind of hardships and you tell yourself you make it easier for your children they end up doing crap because they end up feeling untitled when you have to fight well paul fought wesley fought luther fought all them four and if you think you ain't go fight you wrong brother branham and hell fought so you guys sit there you're fighting for your healing you're fighting for deliverance you're fighting for your breakthrough you're fighting for a touch you're fighting for a refilling you're fighting for oh god a revival you're fighting you're groaning you're travailing praise god hallelujah you can't take it easy praise god you're breathing in and breathing out you're you're huffing you're puffing oh glory to god you're you're a man like a like a like a mother whoever child is sick you're worried you're piercing the floor you've got to get a breakthrough things can't continue as it going oh glory to god and the world said make your calling an election your father i want to do that oh god today is my day i want to know that i am genuinely called elected predestination for this hour oh god prepare my heart lord to face what's coming oh glory to god all kind of things coming dreadness famine plagues but adoption coming power coming rain coming fire coming and the manifestation the sons of god that is also coming [Applause] for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first digging at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of christ of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved scarcely where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear so that that make us work on exiles now that don't make us feel comfortable knowing that we hear that judgment have to begin in the house of god and the righteous as casey saved you can't just take things for granted you have to make a short assurance a confirmation of where god has called you at it's a push [Applause] this is one of the context scripture i quote second timothy three one we know it by way to listen it with a different ear this morning this know also that in the last days 2022 and forward perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves that should be a whole message by itself covetous boasters proud blasphemous before i finish this is not unbelievable this is tribulation sins this is church members you don't say amen you know i know you know you talking the word here for men shall be lovers of their own selves coverages boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and that disobedient brings on the curse because the bible says honor your father or mother that your days may be long honor them respect them don't disrespect them even if you don't agree with them honor them show them respect and god bless you for doing that they could be cuckoo it doesn't matter the way it said under them we'll give the lord some praises [Applause] i was telling my wife was dreams about jacob and how the mother put the rough skin around him because he saw was if he was born and he was to get the blessing and she know what god said younger shall save the elder and so on like that and when jacob played his easter and he got the blessing and he walked out and he shall come home daddy he become a blessing we just walk all day he said that man is surely blessed because when it comes to his mouth he can't take it back [Applause] what are saying that to say this when a curse come out the mount of god you have to get back either you know what god blessed it's blessed and what god cursed is curse the weight is on both sides it's on one side only you know it's on both sides the bible said with many of them god was not pleased we talked about called out people elected people chosen people but on the journey there was another selection that was going on by the heart i'm gonna be chosen by the voice oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i hope this wake you up this morning i hope this shake you up this morning i hope you catch something about making your call election sure and that you would work out your own salvation with fear and trembling no church could do that you as an individual have to decide oh glory to god amen because change on my wife brotherly kindness is not a feeling it's a choice you have to make a decision to forgive hey i feel it i ain't feeling it and you feel worthy and what it you have to forgive if you have ought against any drop it it's a decision that you decide oh give the lord praises this morning oh glory to god get the messenger this morning hallelujah hallelujah when faith is based upon forgiveness we need faith to leave here we need faith to see the sick heal we need faith for revival we need faith to things to take place great faith great manifestation exploits of faith the people that know their god shall be strong do create exploits great faith hallelujah it also means great forgiveness you've got to be able to move on quickly from hurts and odds and con [Applause] you hear what i said you have to be able to move on quickly from lies and acquisition all kind of old nancy stories and imagination and illusions and delusions you have to move on quickly from that because people do running their own show doing their own thing god has nothing to do with that god has sent a prophet like i told a bunch of ministers i goddess enough prophet for me that he has no man preaching your own thoughts and ideas i am i want that for me and i am wondering for the people that i serve oh praise god i want to hear what dusty of the lord is i come in this morning here just say the lord every time you read the scriptures you end direct from god sit down on your feelings aim and push your feelings inside and tell yourself what you are hearing is the word of god oh glory to god god tell moody speak to the people god tell joshua speak to the people god tell jeremiah speak to the people tell them this tell them that tell them that oh glory to god when that fire came on mount sinai and the beginning the place began to rock and shake the people said don't let god speak let moses speak god say okay i gotta set me fire amen i'm gonna send my power in men i will speak to their lips i will anoint them i'm going to inspire them oh glory to god and from since that time god of men anointed with his spirit god expressing to their lips the very word from god himself oh glory the bible said man of god move by the holy ghost this is not a game thing they're gonna practice a rehearsal man hallelujah have to be moved moved by god move by the spirit these same church members heady high-minded lovers of pleasures that includes facebook movie tv the whole bunch sports everything the whole books lots of lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god you have to be a lover of god pleasure to take second term lover of god right and hear the bomb having a form of godliness but denying the power from such turn away for of this sword they which creep into hoses and lead captive silly woman leading with sins led away with diverse lust ever let him ever able to not run able to accompany truth bunch of people their ears itching for learning things learning things learning new things and nothing but the new birth as you remember the kangaroo nothing but a change of life nothing but a change of work that is not what they're interested in they want interested in putin and what i'm doing and what this one doing and that one doing and politics and everything else but their lives being changed i want to tell you myob mind your own business make your call election show you can't make nobody else calling more important than your calling or give the lord a shout that's why i don't mind no church business i don't mind nobody business i had to talk about no back anal and no confusion i'm not into that oh glory to god hallelujah work your salvation out good fear and trembling oh glory the gods are shaking away you know oh hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah praise second contact scripture we're getting a message yet tonight we're still trying to get there second corinthians 7 1 haven't therefore these promises daily beloved let us us shout out us let us cleanse ourselves from all the filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfected holiness in the fear of god so it shows it's a process going on that's why paul didn't say i die monthly i die early half yearly i die daily it shows that he is called elected placed as a prophet but he dying daily oh glory to god he wasn't taken for granted you know god called me let the pillar fire no i die daily i die daily say a man somebody he said i die daily [Applause] a journey that might take a few days end up taking 40 years god given them time to see what's in their heart time as a filter time

cast out them i see them people call them supernatural they're not seeing those things hallelujah and this invisible kingdom that the devil hiding in all the time jesus began to expose him and bring him out come out of endeavor dumb speaking blind singing praise god men come up against the lord give me back my sight holly they come for the healing they're looking for this messiah oh god they're hunting for where jesus is even the one with the blood issues if i could just touch without the scripture if i could just touch him or his weather man where that weather man look i want to find that man could we find that man that man called jesus oh god i'd love to hear about jesus people preaching preaching preaching and your hand but jesus at all i want to hear about jesus i want to meet that man i want to touch that man oh god i want to hold on to that man that mankind's jesus he's the holy ghost he is the word this morning he's the power the presence that you feel this morning he's the same yesterday there forever look at the lord some praises he still opened the blind eye he still called the death to hear the dumb to speak the lame to walk [Applause] to confirm to give approval to to make for more formal to strengthen to confirm one's resolve to give a new assurance of validity to remove doubt i remember when i first read the messages to concede i guess so much of light not in this believer but wondering if amazon sees and when i got a revelation of my sonship the devil never brought back back again only that was gone he know he can't talk that talk devil can't bring back that at all oh hallelujah to confirm to make a show when you get the assurance that's why david said oh god don't take your holy spirit from me renew unto me the truth lord i don't have the joy i know i say but i lost my job great new one to me the joy [Music] he of it when they got him back you can't wait to come to church a joy of it was i was glad when they said unto me let us go in the house of the lord you know for permeating i was prepared and i was currently preparing this and then i recognized this can't go and then i just shifted and then i recognized this for me for today and it was striking me like this to him in philippians 3 14 i press towards the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus why is it we're not hearing i relax myself i don't know i'm a son i'm elected i'm cold i'm predestinated and i'm chilling why we don't hear that i press the words now if you're pressing and you're not mark you're in away person do you know say where are you going i press him we're going i i i know now but no no it doesn't work so you know presto was nothing that's why goals he doesn't have a goal um you know i want to save 10 000 um i was going to save ten dollars by win you're not going to save it you have to say i want to save 10 000 in six months time then you could know what they put supposedly each month do you want to buy a house i remember i wanted three children i wanted a house by a certain age and as my life began to unfold scenes unfold just like that i speak it i believe it i walk in it you speak it you believe it you walk in it don't leave no open gaps put time on things because time and things make it tight and give you the ambition and passion and zeal to get it done if you say you want to clean the house second one you can always one man pass to one past two years past four years yeah still looking you want to you know but the reason it is not done because you put no time on it you leave it open-ended so in your spirit there's no desperation there's no illnesses there's no time to it but if you say i want this done in one week then all goes the trash all goes this and you pelt this thing outside because if what it done in one week you put a time on it that's why when heaven when the seven seat book was was was silenced for half an hour god didn't even open the only half an hour and salmon's over oh glory to god hallelujah praise god our lives are not open time to burn a time to die and what we unfold is in between our lives are not open-ended don't live a open-ended life put some tags on your life give the lord a shout praise god praise god praise god david said the lord shall perfect that which considered me glory to god i look at what the devil say what the enemy does glory to god hallelujah [Applause] i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in christ jesus so you could understand now a bit of why i i do what i do how i do it people find that sometimes i'm over i'm i'm pushing too much anything like that i was always scared of the pentecostalism that i saw in the early years people just waiting i'm going in rapture and they're sitting down in any way and live in any way and whatnot but we won't get on into it about this making your election sure thing all right let's continue but abraham you see in god's law redemption as it was with boers and naomi it had to be a kinsmen and the only way that man could be redeemed god had to become a kinsman which is near all right i want you to see it he never become kinfolk altogether to the rich or to the mighty but he was born in a stable wrapped in sweden clothed not to the adult but to the child he was god over the creation he choose to do it not come in full mature man he's the part i want to get not come a full matured man he came that he might suffer the feelings of the little babies [Music] he came that he might go through teenage temptations he my goal that he could toil the toilets and the snails of the devil as a man and make a way for people of all ages of all ages of all class the poor the rich he became poor that through his poverty we might become rich and heirs with him in his kingdom a sign would be given crossing himself making himself something different than he was now a super sign crying as a baby plain as a boy tallinn as a man and his apart it was god living all stages of life like we do so you can't say he didn't understand he doesn't know he knows he understands and he cares that is why you go through what you go through he understands because he went through the challenges that you go let's go brethren i say this with reverence and respect to you as my brethren knowing that maybe before night we'll all stand at the judgment seat of christ in heaven may i say this that it's the atmosphere that always brings forth the product the hen the actual way of hand is to have chickens is with a hinterly on the egg covered with a body that makes the warmth of the hen's body hatches the egg but you could put it on the incubator it's the same want warmth and atmosphere it produced chicken just the same i don't care if it's under the methodist baptist presbyterian the atmosphere of the word if the word which is the egg on in the right atmosphere it will produce a born-again child see where it's under the pentecostal gospel where it is it's the attitude that we take towards god divine word many of you have heard of john spool he's a good friend of mine he at one time he was taken by the uh take note by the guy to a garden he saw a great statue of christ and he said he stood off and criticized it he said what was this culpa mean sculpture meaning look here there's no sufferings there's nothing just plain and while he was criticizing it to his wife the guide walked up and said mr spool perhaps you're criticizing the work of the sculpture he said yes i don't see why he hung up there like that it doesn't look anything like it to show the sufferings of christ he said sir it's the way you are looking at it he said no it's got to alter down deer if you come down here and kneel down and he kneeled down he said no look up and he said his heart could break there was features of the suffering of christ when he looked up you see it's the way you're looking at it so here it is he looked the sculpture he criticized it and the guy tell him you know what you need to go down at the altar and look up look again how you look at it and the prophet says this you know and that's the way it is with the word of god brethren it's the way you're looking at it if you stand off and look at it from an observation and a point of criticism to say this guy hasn't got it that guy hasn't got it it won't work it's got to get done and look up to and that brings the results then you have a different attitude and a different attitude towards your brethren a different attitude towards the man who is striving for the same thing that you are trying to strive for and it will break down barriers then oh glory to god hallelujah as we say the same bloodiest of me is for you also oh glory to god i say it again the same blood for me is for you and the same blood for you is for your brother and for your sister even though they don't see i agree with you oh glory to god amen do you believe that but ibrahim he said now watch we're going to talk about demons in the spiritual form in the soul then the soul the same as they in the body and we are born to admit that we see them in people's bodies such as cancers and different diseases in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth dimension disease it's in another dimension it is demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it so that means he's saying that's where x-rays for dimension can see these cancer things for dementia disease right now what now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come in either place and there are many times and many peoples with good thoughts good people who try many times to rest upon some little theology they have something that they have been taught since a child and still find that dung and their being dung in their soul they still have some that's not right you are many here this morning no doubt whether you find christians gathered together you find people who has those spirits in them it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if i can only quit lying if i can liquid lusting if i'm going to equate this that that's devils and they come in the form of religion many times they come in the form of religions you see now today many people are listening so many people are listening to enticing spirits instead of taking the word of god spirits there in the world they are demons and they go out into places and they get among men ministers they get among church members they get amongst good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that is contrary to the word of god so the word of god is the blueprint the word of god is the prom line the word of god is the standard you could check anything else by the word and if we begin to do that then we'll be on right we'll be on point oh glory to god are you with me now today ministers in the congregation allowing the people to play cars and the churches many of them and protestants do that too all right let's continue what is it it's enticing spirits coming down trying to substitute something for the word of god god has no substitute for his word god has nothing to substitute faith faith has no substitute hope will never take the place of faith faith is alone faith stands alone hope can never take its place hallelujah praise god one is intellectual faith and one is a direct revelation of god it will never take its place praise god we are trying to make substitute just because we can be emotional don't mean we are saved here we go because we go to church i don't mean we are saved here we go i want this to rock here people send me a message that don't mean they says you ever think about that they believe the prophet don't mean to save here we go because we can get emotional don't mean we are saved because we got a church domain we are saved don't believe those entities spirits a real spirit of god a real word of god is the truth of god which is the seed of god will produce god in your life and be godly and saintly glory to god so you're not looking for what people are confessing you know it's what people manifest in is what their spirit and heart is pulsing there we go among a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth they become tacklings back titans and all kind of ungodly things brother that sulfuric acid in the church it is demon powers spirit of men and women who get amongst one another and try to push off and say this is not right this is not right that is not right if you chase it down 19 out of 10 is the very person making this still that's not right god here we go now this is the word now what we want to read god hates discord among brethren you see our brothers like the cut off people and cutters one got one an older one this one is shocked this one is this and hold on god eats that that's why you hear me see sometimes people are not acting as christians i don't even know if they are already saved because their behavior not even basic christianity yet they go to church and yet they believe this message that's what they claim are you with me but the prophet identified the unbelieving spirit that is in his message too is unbeliever make believer untrue believer okay god hates discord among brethren be reverent be holy love god stand by him as long as you know your life is giving up with the bible with purity of heart purity of thought love towards your brother trying your best to build the kingdom of god doing those things dressing right living right talking right going right places then you can have all the emotions you want to and everybody will believe it hallelujah so all these demons activities and whatnot that's to the individual work out your salvation with fear and trembling be concerned today about you don't go and interfere anybody business this wrong that's wrong who wrong and what this one's supposed to be doing and this one not doing supposed to do it no you begin to search out you let's continue now there's sure going to be some great disappointments on the day of judgement the bootlegger in way is going after judgment so does the behong know he's going so does the prostitute know where she's stand so does the gambler know where she stands so does the drunkard know where he stand he'll not be disappointed disappointed but where the disappointment is going to be is those who thought they were right that is where the disappointment when they got up there and say sure we cast all devils in your name we are preachers we belong in certain churches we've done great things and miracles and he said he part for me you workers of iniquity i never even knew you there you are that's a disappointment the children of their children will come in and sit down on the kingdom and say we got a right to be here entitlement see now we have a right to be here that is why they tell jesus our fathers eat man in the wilderness and you say i'm to everyone dead they were at they was actually plugging into the legacy of the history and the lineage of the fathers he said we're all undead and that dead means not dying going wrong you know that means death separated from god so don't go there because your father's prophesy of me the prophet prophesied that i'll be here i know you're turning it down so god always bring the word to bring a fresh prophecy to the people god is not stale god is not backward the book is a book of prophecy not just a there's a book about good behavior it's a book of prophecy and the prophecy and unfolding all the time so you had was the be you had to come when you came because you are part of the words of the book oh glory to god we believe that so what we have a right to be here and they'll be cast out into outer darkness there'll be weeping wheeling nation of teach traitors again now there's a way that lead to life few there be that find it but the banner to you my dear people this morning listen to this i never made this up i'm responsible for telling it that's all i'm responsible for if i never preach another semen in my life that is the truth there's just going to be a few people saved just remember that just a few you'll be one of them who are they brother branham i don't know nobody else knows we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling but you'll be lined up with god if your heart don't beat just with the bible then there's something wrong there is something wrong no matter what your church says you can't go in by that so a pastor say you are the irony bride digest semantics verbal gymnastics they're just woods you have to know what's going on in your heart to know if you are part of this bright body you feel what i'm saying the bride is here everybody says it's not non-bride there's foolishness no man have the authority to pronounce that are you with me what who are they brother branham i don't know nobody else knows we work out isn't that sincere and humble that he's answering this question who it is who's the bride i don't know but you nobody else knows we woke up our own salvation trembling all right now what but you'll be lined up with god if your heart don't beat just with the bible then there's something wrong there's something wrong no matter what your church say you can't go in by that you've got to go in by what god said this is the book that you'll be judged from the bible or give the lord a shout on that not how long you wear your tie i'm almost dread long just your way and you're just done by your uncle that's not what you were judged by it's from the book who your pastor is what church you go to that is not where i'm being judged from the book here we go you say well i've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus that's correct that is bible but if that light doesn't follow it it didn't do you much good well i received the holy ghost that's good what you have done but if the life isn't there oh that's a big one he said you'll receive the baptism but to your faith you have to add the rest so you gotta start and god wants you to complete it god wanted life to unfold nobody becomes a master overnight a teacher a mechanic a doctor nobody just say i want to be a doctor you know ready exam signing papers where are you putting the operator on passport a knife if you hear somebody just pass some exam and they come in with a knife to operate on you you know you will be healed because you run out of that theater one time that person will kill you you don't become a master overnight it takes time it takes time to mature you can't have a child a child like a seed the child is growing two years four years seven years potentially they could be a doctor they could be a lawyer 20 years from then but you can't put lawyer on the shoulder right now you can't crunch them no when they they have to manifest that 20 30 years something when they mature when they're ready when they're right so you can't expect god to give some little baby power to do what they make superman or something make some big toy so god have to put sons through tests and trials to get met along to them to get character out of them to get quality of out to them these are perfections perfectionist patience waiting on god and waiting for god you have need of patience after you have done the will of god oh glory to god let patience have a perfect work that you will mature entire lack of nothing oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah so hush of us and have patience with god and have patience with yourself too but let us press this morning and work out our own salvation with trembling when you leave here you must leave him in the consciousness of you as an individual in this plan and program of god not you beyonce you are the individual give the lord a shout you as an individual remember the weeds receive the same power that falls on the wheat to make it grow makes the weed shout too little old weed stand right there just as happy as the witches lives by the same life and a sinner can stay in the presence of god and shout the victory and live like a christian but if there isn't something different in the heart he could have the same power to cast out devils jesus said so he can preach the gospel and be good as any other preacher can do i have faith through mountains if i cast all difference in this name i am nothing the thing to do here we go from your heart be a christian now enter in that straight gate for broad is the way that leads to destruction and millions time millions and this generation of believers will go in their act because treating the gate now is the way just you and christ alone just who you and christ alone will give the lord some praises hallelujah [Applause] when god speaks anything god makes a comment a statement for as long as it sees it it's perfect it's got to come to pass it have no explanation why it didn't come to pass once god speak it if it didn't come to pass it wasn't god said it it's a man said and whatever man say will fail but whenever god speaks it will surely come to pass oh give the lord a shout in the house my god my god jacob do all his tricks with his mother to get the blessing but when that blessing dropped on him so nothing couldn't change that not even god himself could change that because the mount coming out isaac a son of god and what is blessed is blessed blessings coming out of the mountain you know those motes are dangerous you know don't crush them you know hallelujah don't fight with them you know because you want the blessing oh glory to god say that blessing i will bless thee and multiply and i will multiply thy seed and thy seed shall possess the gates oh glory to god don't get an excited hallelujah the kiss of the enemy glory to god i ain't seen no dice seed we'll get back up in the corner guys he gonna be finished that seed's gonna be wiped out i haven't seen that in the scripture oh god i see the people that know that god shall be strong god i'll preach let's tell all they hear my head fall off i'm gonna still preach to take that devil this spirit can't fail god can't lie oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god our war is coming oh give the lord some praises prepare for this great possible brethren [Applause] if god will run his business if he save us here no you're going to lose us after a while he's a poor businessman let me read that again if he save us now knowing he loses after a while he's a poor businessman so therefore all informed you he what called and who he called he justified and all he justified he has already glorified but no he didn't say nothing about sanctify so god do the justification god doing the glorification god unicorn election but you're going to do the signification then that's how you're going to work somebody's already at work so don't work again you're going to work out your own salvation with your adrenaline oh give the lord i shout let me sting you in a little bit go tell joshua every place to put it for is yours from this the day and there every place i put it for this yours if joshua washed

spying stop spying put your foot on it put your foot on signs put your foot on wonders put your foot on revival put your foot on praying for your children praying for your love and put your foot of faith [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory in other words exercise your faith every sick pass away is an opportunity to exercise your faith don't be afraid god is with you we are fair you destroyed our fear no glory how to begin to work for the kingdom you have to do for the kingdom the kingdom has come oh glory glory hallelujah the kingdom is upon you praise god praise god praise god hallelujah so watch this here now but abraham you are in it somebody asked him he's saying that braham you are in it i i hope so uh-huh but we work our own salvation with fear and trembling why but abram didn't say i'm the seventh star i'm in it of course i'm in it was that you're rude not his answer not the humility he said i hope so he said but we walk our own salvation if i'm trembling and when you see your life not coping with the god's word no matter what church you belong to you know your outer order so this this bypass all groups is individual none can't escape there are people backstage in all different churches slackers in all different churches fornications and all different churches three cannabis all kind of churches this is still the word to every one of those believers because this word come that you could cope with it not everybody could cope with it like sometimes my wife was testifying to somebody and she said you know i don't know this is for you you know but i'm sharing it with you because this is enough for everybody and i like that we're not trying to force anybody we're not trying to bull wrestle with no bullet no goat and thing you know you're dragging a bull in the church an x major get booked you thought was a sheep you're not bull wrestling and things like that yeah you know and toro toro and looking for a red cloth and thing to run below the church something like that there my sheep hear my voice has changed they will not follow god put the ability in you to hear his voice okay the lord i shout if this don't make you a shout

root is servant then root is resting then root is rewarded now on the road back here come at time have been a type of the church or christian each individual who glory represent the entire christian nation so you're not your own each individual represent the entire christian nation did you know that you in your behavior in the way you act the way you do you represent the entire body of christ you say i'm just a lay member that doesn't matter what you take on the name of christian you represent christ and his church we are speaking to individuals inside of here this morning oh give the lord i shout you represent the kingdom you represent christ you represent the church you should live like that that name of christian you represent christ and his church you should live like that you should live like gentlemen like ladies don't never do the things of the world because the whole eyes of heaven and earth is cast on you to represent that one thing no matter how weak you are here we go no matter how weak you are how little you are hold your head right cause you are christian they are strong christian their weaker sense that everybody is strong but whether you're weak or strong hold your head right [Applause] when i go to my job the first house they'll tell people i'm a christian i say tell them that because i wanted it to be i want you to be uncomfortable we're doing this but when you say you say what you are you offer your drink if you take it they don't determine a christian but when they know you're a christian they expect certain behaviors from you they expect a certain walk a certain talk a certain life so you put yourself out there to get licks to get blows for them to point the finger at you and you say a christian how you're looking so angry on vets and carrying on like that you say sorry sorry sorry i'll go and get that right oh please the name of the lord are you with me today okay root making a decision a type of church the gentile church she decided and crossed over into the land now a lot of times we met some baptists we think here we go are you ready we think that's all you have to do she had just got started she has gotten nowhere yet she just got over into the land oh caught a pong am born for the promised land you come from egypt right you hate the land oh who will come and go with me original land where is it do you see a hittite yet no jeb said i come to you yet doing nobody philistine you have a distance you're going to meet them guys but you cross over but you know getting started you can build a house yet because there's war you have to fight first before i get the rest the bill oh give the lord a shout are you with me the next thing she had to do when she getting down she had to work shout out work some people do like that you know it's too hard they like the lazy wine harry lax will hacks work take it easy you know so when root cross over she has to do what work she become a legalist you're the part i want to get to she had to work out now look how the perfect titan now she had to work out her own salvation with you on trembling like you did she went out into the field put her clothes upon her went on the feet and gleaned behind the maidens in order to get sustaining food for the day is that right what was she doing she was trying to find favor with boaz so she worked her way through the stage of legalism so there's a stage in your life where you have to do certain things anika you know i ain't got any feelings boy some people all feel for me are you feeling led no it's not let you know you have to do it because it has to be done by myself right now offend you cut it off but listen let's go deeper you know that's exactly what the church did the looters believe it's by feet come into the land the methodist thoughts and vacation which was the legalistic standpoint of it you see you've got to do something i've got to quit i've got to let my hair grow out you come to the word you know a woman here supposed to be long many are supposed to be short men have long hair women are short here become a christian you know you're not supposed to cut it yet don't cut it here that is sounding illegal but you're showing god you believe the word you want to please him if god like woman would long hair have you here long god don't want men which long hair have your hair short your son so by doing that you're honoring god it's a legalistic standpoint and what not where cover your knees and dress modestly you don't want to be sexy dressed out there the man lusting after you you do that because you're showing that you love god you want to find favor with boaz you want to attract the pillar of fire you want to attract the dove oh praise god and if you obey the word they will attract the things of god you attract presence you attack miracles praise god angels start to walk with you because he has a son he has a daughter she's trying she's trying her best she's pressing she's pushing oh glory she's gleaning she is working she's doing her best she's working on her own salvation she is making a core election sure oh glory to god and angels come to help you and strengthen you when jesus was a god in gethsemane there were angels helping him and strengthen him if thou be possible let his cup pass nevertheless not my will that will be done he prayed at once he paid that three times he was in a battle he was wrestling and as he wrestled him because he wanted to do the right thing angels come to strengthen him and when you start to do the right thing angels come to help you and strengthen you you don't even know when it come something come upon you you can't explain it but there's god coming up on you to help you because devils has taken over the earth streams of hell demon powers coming up trying to stop this move of god but he can't stop it because when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of god with a standard oh glory to god and god is witness standing this morning he is telling you work out your own salvation but fear i'm trembling make your call and let you unsure oh give the lord some praise this people glory to god made this message straighten your heart strengthen your result oh glory to god may god confirm you oh glory to god confirm your prayer confirm your faith confirm your life confirm your testimony oh glory to god hallelujah so watch you gotta do something i gotta quit i got to let my hair grow out said the woman of course they didn't do it no more they didn't wear their skirts wrong or short like the others did they had to do something that is what she did the state of justification that's a state the state of certification now when finally she found favor with boaz what happened then numerator you wait here while boaz goes to work as a kind of redeemer because he's the only one can do it he's our next kid my redeemer you just wait here don't go in the fields no more just go on rest just wait until the kinsmen redeemership has been fulfilled that's exactly what the church has come to in this age in the beginning of pentecost they all worked up and they had to do this they shook them and everything else now what is this doing the true church is resting what is rest here it is rest is the holy spirit the sabbath day so the sabbath is the holy spirit that is the rest he's talking about to enter into his rest into his sabbath and you're rested from your works and then you're going to be rewarded oh glory to god saluter root deciding whether he root servants some people would like to serve that's the working part you save others to each other that's nice right help people praise god and encourage people call people on the phone pray with them encourage them local people and gossip then i help end them like pulling along your ditch some people don't want to help you they want to pull you down where they are they don't get some hole and they call it the hole you know praise be to jesus hallelujah root silvan then the pentecostal root resting and then root rewarded that's where the capstone adoption power that's what got god coming to you to reward you oh glory to god do you believe that praise god so rude servant was certification that's the legalistic part that's the legal work of sanification that just woke up your salvation will fear and trembling you know god said don't do this don't do this don't do it don't go in shady places don't go shady places that is you deciding deciding not to go there not to do this not to do this not to do this that is you deciding oh god having these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves hallelujah from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit that's one of the context scripture right perfecting wholeness in the faith of god do you understand the seed the the testimony of the seed is to unfold the life of the seed you know i will accept a corner we'd fall along and die it abide alone you on your own nothing happened from you you caught up with yourself doubts fears and your past and your history and you're not dying you know you want people sorry for you you want to tell your story because people just want to talk the talk god nobody loved me nobody care for me nobody look at me do i pray for me god bless you not on love church are not love you ever before christ are no love depression all love you have loved yourself you don't even know what love is because if you understand god loves you do you want to look for the bridge in love who are you looking for for love they don't even want me you don't even know what love really is the key is to know that god's love extends to you to give grace upon your life his love is what forgive you are your sins his love is what brought you out his love is what covers you with blood his love is what given you access to his presence today that's the love of god that's the mercies of god oh hallelujah praise god so listen to this saying he said coming along to a real serious hour where we each individual have to make the call in an election shore and stop worrying about what others are doing let the dogs back this caravan moves on when you're driving the road are you having those right can they bite your wheel right just keep moving on hallelujah all right let's hit the home stretch you know you do very good today i'm amazed john 16 20 jesus speaking verily verilies unto you that he shall weep and lament prophecy and the will shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful prophecy but your sorrow shall be turned into joy prophecy a woman when she's in travis had sorrow so jesus put all this sorrow time with a woman in traffic when she's in travail had sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remember it no more the anguish for joy that the man is born into the world you know therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you go give the lord some praises your joy hallelujah your joy shout out my joy shout out my joy again you have joy you have joy my joy hallelujah give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god brother branham oh howard burns our hearts the hebrew mother has given birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where there was going to be position in the promised land she cried out ephraim when she was in labor she cried out where they'll be placed positionally and then he went on to say this a familiar quote how god has set some in the church true labor pains stop rewind how god has said some true what true what this is for individuals there is something called labor pain and labor pains is to bring forth something you don't want the labor pains if you're not fully full-time they get tremendous sometimes what what get remembers somebody upset you somebody lie on you somebody treats you badly that's a pain are you going to treat them back badly are you going to treat them like christ that's a death to you you know they're wrong but you still want to act christ-like you still want to treat them as a christian word so it causes a debt for you to even respond that way you yourself go into labor pains to act like jesus talk like jesus you're not pleasing them you're pleasing him you're not trying to please them you know you know you're trying to please him it's boaz you're trying to please you're trying to get boaz i you're trying to get bored's attention music please oh glory to god hallelujah glory god when last have you studied is christ pleased with my actions is christ pleased with my decisions is christ pleased with how i am behaving or if you just carrying on your own self when the church is growing in god help us head downtown monaco when the church has grown in that is individuals in the church growing in why what they're going for under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost the promise of it is just as real to us as it went to pentecost how they grown and cry under labor pains they grown and cry under what oh not specials you know nothing spiritual you know not concerts on the labor pains oh my are you with me do you see yourself working out your own salvation with your trembling or do yourself waiting for the ride you're waiting for the train to take off and i jump in like a child maybe you're not pregnant you have to be pregnant with god you know pregnant with the word because you had to produce messiah and the secret is what the word is in the bride so it's a prophesied pregnancy that the word will be in you we could go down to revelation 10 8 and find john was aku representative bride he was totally go to the angel and take the book and eat the book and never eat the book the word going to be in you because you are taking in the word oh glory to god let me try to wrap up here now how they grown and cry in the liver pains but when they are born when and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has set in the church so see watch that open the bible read ephesians 11. when god has certainly changed apostles prophet evangelist everybody thinks this prophecy is evangelist automatically entitled to that because a day long time man believed that because the people paid 40 years they anointed pastor they adopted them all there is only wishful thinking you know that is spirit of entitlement did they long time what i have to do anything doesn't have to do anything at all he says watch when this happens then the holy ghost has said not man appoint not the people voting this man then this happened here groaning travailing placed positionally then the holy ghost said watch in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists and into deer speaking with tongues so it's all one continuous line it's not just it's not just holy ghost ministry then you pull pit it are speaking in tongues intervention of tongues knowledge wisdom give something what he's saying all kind of americans the gifts back in the church so this this this drama this scene is to produce not only a fifo ministry but the gifts return back to the church because that is where it belongs it belongs in the body go give the lord a praise offering let me say it again all the gifts belong to christ's body which is tongues interpretations wisdom healing look at me just preaching the word and following the word of holy mysteries all of that too that comes with it okay last page strife that word striving it means make great efforts to achieve or obtain something not effort great effort when somebody's striving oh god are striving striving you're fighting you're making what great effort see if there comes some prayer in five minutes and yeah when you leave here could be in five minutes how do you see everything yesterday another great effort when they go go from five to one hour and you hit them at two hours in a corner there because you're wrestling with god you're making a great effort you're showing god you know what i need to talk with you i need to get this over with i need to get rid of my chest so instead of gossiping along with somebody in the phone telling your problems and so on you're telling god your problems and you want god to help you with your problems you have problems all of us have problems challenges situations but you want god to intervene you want a supernatural element you want something supernatural so listen strive is to make great efforts to achieve something obtain something to struggle or fight vigorously you think cancer is something the bible said there's come in a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the bosses will eat off their carcasses before they even die can't say is that true take to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden today to touch those who are the seed of god that is what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before this horrible break strike so that's what they're striving for to get in oh hallelujah last quote now we see we can see why there are two vines one true one false now we can see why abram are two sons one after the flesh that puts you together isaac and after the promise now we can see how that one of the same parents two boys comfort as twins one knowing and loving the things of god the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted a child that was elect god did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect are you ready elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect all those reparats are religious they are smart they are of the canine discipline seed they build their peoples they build their cities they build the empires and all the wild calling on god they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even the name of the lord to destroy god's elected ones but they are needed what is the chaft of the wheat no chaff no wheat but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire unquenchable under wheat where is it it is gathered into the gunner it is where he is oh elect of god beware study closely be careful work out your own salvation with fear and trembling rely upon god be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking woman will devour watch unto pray and be steadfast this is the end time both
