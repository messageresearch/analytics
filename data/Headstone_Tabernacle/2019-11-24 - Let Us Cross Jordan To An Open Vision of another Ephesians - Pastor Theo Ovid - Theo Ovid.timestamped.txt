[6:23] inside it doesn't have color complexion
[6:26] height nation where you come from what
[6:28] you belong to is this being when it's

[6:42] without that you're staying back
[6:44] this being faithful to that have to be
[6:47] in you the rapture is about that not
[6:51] about you is about that so when the

[19:27] and 3 6 I wanna read Matthew chapter 4
[19:31] verse 1 and verse 14
[19:38] so that's cool too second Kings
[19:42] to
[19:44] six an Elisha said unto him talk talk
[19:48] and speak until I shall bury I pray thee
[19:50] here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan
[19:53] and he said as the Lord liveth and as I
[19:58] so live it I will not leave thee and the
[20:01] two went on and
[20:04] fifty of the sons of the prophets went
[20:07] and stood to view afar off and did to
[20:10] stood by Jordan and Elijah took his
[20:15] mantle and wrapped it together and
[20:17] smooth the waters and they were divided
[20:19] hither and thither so that d2 went over
[20:23] on dry ground Joshua chapter 1
[20:28] now after the death of Moses the servant
[20:30] of the Lord came to pass that the Lord
[20:33] speak unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[20:36] the minister seen
[20:37] Moses my servant is dead now therefore
[20:41] arise go over this Jordan am gone and
[20:45] all these people unto the land which I
[20:48] do give unto them
[20:50] even to the children of Israel every
[20:53] place that is full of your foot shall
[20:55] tread upon that have I given unto you as
[20:58] I said unto Moses verse 6 be strong of a
[21:03] good courage for onto disc people shall
[21:06] doubt divide for an inheritance the land
[21:09] which I swear on that their fathers to
[21:12] give them let's look at Matthew
[21:15] chapter 4 reading verse 1 then we go to
[21:19] verse 14
[21:21] then was Jesus led up of the spirit into
[21:26] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[21:29] devil verse 14
[21:48] okay
[22:09] oh
[22:11] praise the Lord
[22:17] okay sorry it's supposed to be Luke
[22:19] actually Luke chapter 4
[22:23] verse 1 and verse
[22:25] 14 I'm sorry Luke chapter 1 and Jesus
[22:29] being Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and Jesus
[22:32] being full of the Holy Ghost returned
[22:34] from Jordan and was led by the spirit
[22:37] into the wilderness verse 14 and Jesus
[22:40] returned in the power of the Spirit unto
[22:42] Galilee and they went out of Fame of him
[22:45] wrong about throughout all the regions
[22:48] wrong the bow let us pray father we
[22:50] thank you for your word and we pray of
[22:52] calm down and especially and speak to
[22:53] our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen
[22:56] and he made you may be seated oh
[23:04] praise the Lord so I guess I was looking
[23:08] at those two scriptures what does them
[23:09] have it but I wanted to get that one and
[23:11] somehow end up with you know Matthew
[23:14] amen we have a title this morning let us
[23:19] cross Jordan
[23:21] to an open vision of another Ephesians
[23:27] let us cross Jordan to an open vision of
[23:32] another Ephesians and have an
[23:35] inspiration before the bride returns in
[23:40] power
[23:40] that is what my inspiration is before
[23:43] the bride returns in power now I want
[23:46] you to turn your Bibles to first John
[23:49] chapter 2 I want you to follow me with
[23:51] this context scripture reading from
[23:53] verse 15 to 16 first John chapter 2
[23:57] reading from verse 15
[24:00] to 16
[24:04] and John is right after Peter
[24:09] we was 15 says love not the world
[24:13] neither the things that are in the world
[24:16] If any man love the world the love of
[24:20] the father is not in him
[24:22] for all that is in the world the lust of
[24:28] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[24:32] pride of life is not of the Father but
[24:36] is of the world and the world passeth
[24:39] away and the lust thereof but he that
[24:43] doeth the will of God abideth
[24:46] for ever I want to read that one again
[24:49] for all the 16 for all that is in the
[24:53] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[24:58] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[25:02] the Father but is of the world may God
[25:05] bless his word and praise God
[25:08] blessed be the name of the Lord and this
[25:12] is brother Branham from God called man
[25:14] he was saying before prayer I would like
[25:17] to ask this question to people inside
[25:19] out how many in here
[25:21] sincerely would like to go with Jesus
[25:23] down to Jordan tonight and dare cross
[25:27] over there where you could see a vision
[25:30] and see what God really means would you
[25:33] raise your hands god bless you go down
[25:35] to Jordan not down to a seminary Elijah
[25:38] pass right by that tyree here I don't
[25:41] want to that's man-made it's never
[25:43] quenched that taste of a man who is to
[25:46] stand for God a seminary or information
[25:50] can never quench that tooth that a man
[25:53] have for God he says what we need you
[25:57] can get men all to themselves away from
[25:59] their school of theology are we from
[26:01] their self-styled ways fearless men men
[26:03] of character with you who believes you
[26:05] and take you at your word and he's
[26:08] praying God many of them standing here
[26:10] present that will give all they got to
[26:13] the Lord Jesus and sell o the world go
[26:14] pass Giga the place of confession
[26:17] Christian beginnings go past the school
[26:19] of the prophets that set back there with
[26:20] theology and go to Jordan to an open
[26:23] vision and when the cross and find that
[26:26] God still lives do you believe that oh
[26:30] praise the name of the Lord blessed be
[26:33] the name of the Lord but the trouble
[26:36] today is that ministers very few
[26:39] ministers are trying to establish Christ
[26:41] in the people's heart very few ministers
[26:45] is trying to do that they are trying to
[26:47] establish themselves their ministry who
[26:51] they are their idea their interpretation
[26:55] very few are establishing the Word of
[26:58] God isn't that right because Eve had a
[27:01] lust that loss was foreknowledge is not
[27:04] right and but urbana me spoke about that
[27:06] isn't that right it was wrong for her to
[27:08] do that and we finally what happened
[27:10] there isn't that right and the ministers
[27:13] today supposed to be established in
[27:15] Christ in the people's heart not the
[27:17] church not their ministries not their
[27:21] ideas but Christ and crisis the world so
[27:24] once the word is preached without being
[27:26] flavor and have an interpretation to it
[27:28] you are getting Christ the world because
[27:31] in the beginning was the word the Word
[27:33] was with God and the Word was God isn't
[27:36] that something else so Jesus Christ
[27:38] isn't that right when he was 12 years
[27:41] old he knew he was about the father's
[27:44] business he was in the channel of the
[27:46] will of God he was a son 12 years old no
[27:50] unit I must be about my father's
[27:52] business it take him 18 years to ripen
[27:55] to comment the position to be
[27:59] positionally please by the pillar of
[28:01] fire by charity at the Jordan River
[28:04] could somebody
[28:05] see a man is not right so during those
[28:08] years of silence he wasn't idle he was
[28:10] doing something he was in the world we
[28:13] attend to fulfill the word during those
[28:16] eight years of silence Jesus was getting
[28:19] a revelation of what the father has to
[28:22] work for his life Oh glory to God in
[28:25] many many many men glory to God they
[28:29] come actively will fake a licen you want

[29:08] out in the road because you have a
[29:10] weapon call a car and they can't lose
[29:13] you just like that and you kind of drive
[29:14] so they have to test you first and when
[29:17] you pass the inside test your God for
[29:19] the outside s and then you get approved
[29:22] but that's what we're talking about you
[29:25] could sit and study home to drive what
[29:28] kind of car to drive if you don't go and
[29:30] pass you the process you are not writing
[29:33] to drive because somebody say man you
[29:37] could preach how nice driving is you can
[29:39] explain how to do it but until you go
[29:42] and do it
[29:43] then do it yet so before you come back
[29:46] in power there is something has to take
[29:48] place before this super church and super
[29:51] race and
[29:53] spoken word doing this and doing that I
[29:56] when the press come down watch them
[29:59] before all of that or get the Lord a
[30:02] shout out before
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:12] just before all of that we want to get
[30:15] down to that this morning oh praise God
[30:17] amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[30:24] originally in Genesis the instructions
[30:28] was for man's have dominion over the
[30:31] fish beasts birds what spirit man
[30:36] Genesis - there was no - of the soil but
[30:39] that real man Remis always a real man
[30:42] real man was no flesh man real man was
[30:45] spirit man and God but real man into
[30:49] Flashman man became a living soul but
[30:52] the original real man was spirit man
[30:54] spirit was leading man no we are man
[30:58] leading but it was leading man now we
[31:01] are flesh leading or give the Lord a
[31:04] shoulder press
[31:09] so if let me see that if we're gonna
[31:12] come back to Genesis if we're gonna come
[31:15] back to original we have to get back the
[31:17] way the split leads man
[31:21] Jesus was led by the spirit
[31:25] come on album come on now where he was
[31:29] going in the spirit oh
[31:32] he was going to power but yet I brought
[31:35] the past
[31:36] [Applause]
[31:36] [Music]
[31:37] [Applause]
[31:40] he was led by the spirit into the
[31:44] wilderness
[31:45] [Applause]
[31:48] so Jesus come on
[31:52] you have to demonstrate he had power
[31:55] over himself
[31:59] [Music]
[32:01] before his ministry could take off
[32:03] because he put any final gear let that
[32:07] engine Rumble through
[32:10] before that car took off he added us to
[32:13] demonstrate he had power over
[32:17] himself
[32:18] because John described all that is in
[32:22] the world
[32:22] [Music]
[32:24] all that is in the world is under lots
[32:28] of the eyes
[32:30] it's either on the loss of the flesh or

[38:41] here we go lust of the flesh
[38:46] he is hungry and the devil come why are
[38:50] you hungry to tempt Jesus
[38:53] the devil said unto him if thou be the
[38:55] Son of God command this stone to be meat
[38:58] bread
[38:59] you could do the sangwich
[39:03] there's only stones all wrong and if you
[39:06] are who you are which know you could do
[39:08] something but Jesus wasn't commanded to
[39:11] follow the instructions or
[39:13] the leaving of sita
[39:18] jesus answered him saying it is written
[39:21] that man shall not live by bread alone
[39:23] but by every word of God
[39:25] he overcame the lust of the flesh by the
[39:29] word
[39:31] he is gaining dominion over himself
[39:37] that that cannot be
[39:39] enslaved the hip and sleeve him
[39:43] watch Dever take him up to a high
[39:46] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[39:48] of the world in a moment of tang lust of
[39:52] the eyes what a temptation what you I
[39:55] could see all of this is mine I guess
[39:59] the Devi had never had a projector there
[40:01] and he was a cool scream
[40:04] the extreme and all the kingdoms of this
[40:09] fools and mine
[40:10] and the Devas and under him all this
[40:13] power will I give thee and the glory of
[40:16] them for that is delivered unto me and
[40:18] to whomsoever I will give it
[40:20] he's talking big
[40:23] he's not talking like if he doesn't have
[40:26] it you know in charge
[40:27] and he said yeah you know me I could fix
[40:30] you right
[40:34] if thou therefore will worship me all
[40:37] shall be dying
[40:39] what he was seeing with his eyes
[40:44] jesus answered and said unto him get
[40:47] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[40:50] thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and
[40:52] him only go shalt serve
[40:56] [Applause]
[41:00] now Satan went on deep
[41:04] he'd no man I
[41:06] mean is hundreds of years have been
[41:09] delivered man man love himself a lot
[41:13] it could be very proud
[41:17] and he brought him to Jerusalem
[41:20] Sita set him on a pinnacle of a temple
[41:24] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[41:25] God cast thyself down from there another
[41:28] word sure sure who you are because it is
[41:32] written he shall give his angels charge
[41:34] over thee now if you take that head
[41:36] thing if you take that basket as we the
[41:39] cnj not if you take that basket as if
[41:43] this is oh it's written on your question
[41:45] everybody look for the angel told me
[41:49] he was gonna feel that this but Jesus
[41:53] told the devil
[41:55] and in their hands what you decide
[41:58] theory uh police at any time those are -
[42:00] I fought against a stone so the devil
[42:01] listen if you not we need scriptures
[42:03] devil is
[42:05] [Music]
[42:06] because he could quote it back
[42:08] to try to tie up and Jesus said ancestor
[42:13] unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt
[42:16] the LORD thy God and when the devil was
[42:19] ended all the temptation he departed
[42:21] from whom a season and I hope we get to
[42:23] verse 14 so before you return in power
[42:29] all that is in the world you have to
[42:33] face
[42:35] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[42:38] flesh and the pride of life
[42:41] but you are going to overcome
[42:43] because there's a prophecy that the
[42:47] bride will cross Jordan and quadriceps
[42:51] future joshua's to take the people over
[42:54] Jordan you don't have to cross trollin
[42:57] alone
[42:58] [Applause]
[43:01] bridge
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:06] Oh
[43:07] blessed be the name of the Lord Laurita
[43:10] God so Jesus
[43:12] proved he had control and dominion over
[43:17] his human spirit by overcoming the lust
[43:21] of the ants by overcoming Ellis of the
[43:23] flesh by overcoming the pride of life
[43:25] isn't that right and before adopted son
[43:28] could have dominion over others and
[43:29] other things you must display to me and
[43:32] over yourself
[43:33] therefore it doesn't matter what church
[43:35] you go to
[43:36] but reading doesn't change you your
[43:40] behavior does come on save me somebody
[43:42] oh yes oh yes people believe because
[43:46] what they believe will take them true
[43:49] but around them teach that he say a got
[43:51] to apply the token random Tabernacle
[43:54] hallelujah you can't say I believe a
[43:57] prophet you believe Moses and you're not
[43:59] applying the blood Moses said take a

[1:02:37] hallelujah honey bombard here let's see
[1:02:39] what happened back there oh praise God
[1:02:42] hallelujah
[1:02:44] Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 no the serpent
[1:02:48] was more subtle than any beast of the
[1:02:49] field which the Lord God had made and he
[1:02:51] said unto the woman yea hath God said ye
[1:02:53] shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:02:54] garden
[1:02:56] so he gave a coat
[1:02:59] he saw the printout and the woman said
[1:03:02] on the woman we may eat of the fruit of
[1:03:04] the trees of the garden but of the fruit
[1:03:07] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:03:09] garden God
[1:03:10] hath said ye shall not eat of it neither
[1:03:14] shall ye touch it Lisa died and the
[1:03:17] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[1:03:20] surely die for God doth know in the day
[1:03:25] you eat your eyes here we go shall be
[1:03:29] opened and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:03:31] good and evil
[1:03:33] listen to how the Bible describe it when
[1:03:36] the woman saw
[1:03:38] that the tree was good for food
[1:03:44] that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:03:47] food lust of the flesh pleasant to the
[1:03:51] eyes lust of the eyes and a tree to be
[1:03:55] desired to make one wise
[1:03:58] pride of life she took the fruit thereof
[1:04:02] did eat give also unto her husband with
[1:04:05] her and he did eat and the eyes of them
[1:04:08] both were opened and they knew that they
[1:04:10] were naked and they sewed fig leaves
[1:04:11] together and made themselves apron and
[1:04:13] they heard the voice of the Lord walk in
[1:04:16] the garden in the cool of the day and
[1:04:17] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[1:04:19] the presence of the Lord and among the
[1:04:22] trees of the garden and the Lord called
[1:04:24] unto Adam and said unto Him where Dow he
[1:04:25] said I heard a voice in the garden I was
[1:04:28] afraid he's because I was naked and I
[1:04:30] hid myself he's a hoot hold it I was
[1:04:31] naked who told you that I was naked you
[1:04:34] may be seated Oh glory to God but the
[1:04:37] point is this because he they were
[1:04:38] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:40] but I said the Holy Ghost over them they
[1:04:42] didn't know they were naked Oh glory to
[1:04:45] God hallelujah

[1:04:48] in the spirit

[1:04:54] so when the devil got Easter break then
[1:04:58] that feel fall off for them
[1:05:00] then they finally said hide in Oh
[1:05:02] hallelujah so this lust of the eyes lust

[1:17:38] message' not the safety zone the word is
[1:17:41] a safety zone and once you in the word

[1:17:48] once you in the word the devil can't do
[1:17:50] you no harm I
[1:18:00] observed that the most people was healed
[1:18:02] and delivered and Jesus wasn't
[1:18:04] Christians
[1:18:06] was it wasn't believable to see them
[1:18:09] have you have you know sister

[1:18:53] him I am more money than him I just
[1:18:56] better than him de Manos at what AM L
[1:18:58] doing woody
[1:18:59] just said that man outside more
[1:19:01] righteous than a man inside

[1:19:07] house and money did take you out of it
[1:19:09] who have have you have you you're gone
[1:19:11] but when you talk about the kingdom
[1:19:13] that's a different thing altogether
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:18] young man came to Jesus good master
[1:19:21] watch I returned alive
[1:19:24] Jesus loved that man man have all the
[1:19:27] potentials man of all the skill set
[1:19:29] handsome looking man the man just get it
[1:19:32] right man looking good sheep much in his
[1:19:36] time at in his shoes she's much in his
[1:19:39] socks but you know something was lacking
[1:19:42] jesus said go and keep the commandments
[1:19:44] he felt good
[1:19:45] he had a word from the Lord
[1:19:50] he said but master I did it so more my
[1:19:53] youth
[1:19:55] do you say one thing
[1:19:58] that's just one thing not not two things
[1:20:01] just just one thing there's a demon of
[1:20:04] lust for money that I see inside your
[1:20:07] soul and to get that demon out you got
[1:20:10] to do something a little different just
[1:20:12] sell what you have and that demon can't
[1:20:15] fool you just just give
[1:20:22] look at the Lord a scream
[1:20:30] I'm a ninja
[1:20:39] you let me see that the Bible said the
[1:20:42] man walk away sag
[1:20:43] because he couldn't let go no he was put
[1:20:47] outside he had the books he had the
[1:20:49] coach you have to take listen to message
[1:20:51] every day but the demon of the lust for
[1:20:53] money is austere lust of the eyes lust
[1:20:56] of the flesh and the pride of life that
[1:20:57] spirit
[1:21:01] didn't want to do what it needs to take
[1:21:03] to get rid of it some people worship the
[1:21:06] spirit upon them they want people to
[1:21:08] accept them as they are we say big fat
[1:21:09] no God take you as you are but you know
[1:21:12] what do you mean as you are you're gonna
[1:21:14] be transformed come on you want to be
[1:21:16] changed you wanna be transfigured you
[1:21:18] are not going to stay as you are
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:30] we'll be seated collisions 5 for 16
[1:21:35] reads this then I say walk in the spirit
[1:21:37] and he shall not fulfill the lusts of
[1:21:39] the flesh
[1:21:40] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:21:42] and the spirit against the flesh and
[1:21:44] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:21:46] so you kind of do the things that you
[1:21:48] would but if you believe by the spirit
[1:21:50] you're not under the law now the works
[1:21:54] of the flesh are manifest which ADIZ and
[1:21:56] he labeled them adultery fornication
[1:22:00] uncleanness
[1:22:02] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[1:22:05] hatred
[1:22:07] variance emulations wrath strife
[1:22:11] seditions heresies
[1:22:13] envyings murders drunkenness revellings
[1:22:16] and
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:20] such like of which I tell you before I
[1:22:23] have told you in time past they which do
[1:22:25] such things shall not inherit the
[1:22:27] kingdom of God under the lust of the
[1:22:29] flesh all these things which graph
[1:22:32] hatred and the in church
[1:22:36] whole in arts and in church look at the
[1:22:39] story just give a pair of a man who had
[1:22:41] a set of debts and so on the King
[1:22:43] forgive him and then he has some friend
[1:22:46] little Tooty pawns or home or small
[1:22:47] pawns and even locked in my neck the gay
[1:22:49] somebody reported
[1:22:52] tracking back and I say every witness go
[1:22:54] back inside and to the people I forgive
[1:22:57] your your big death you can squeeze a
[1:22:58] man for a small debt come on now that's
[1:23:01] why I say Father forgive those as we
[1:23:03] forgive those who trespass against us
[1:23:04] you are forgiven if you don't want to
[1:23:06] release that person God don't release
[1:23:08] you God hold you to your sins somebody
[1:23:11] will send you somebody do you some stuff
[1:23:13] and you don't want to let it go and go
[1:23:15] say if you don't go I'm not gonna let
[1:23:16] you go
[1:23:18] I'm not hearing you reach back to me
[1:23:21] because this is all you can overcome
[1:23:24] this is all you're gonna get victory
[1:23:26] it's got to be the word
[1:23:35] our Father praying esperano give us this
[1:23:38] day our daily bread
[1:23:40] isn't that right lead us not into
[1:23:42] temptation deliver some all evil for
[1:23:45] thine is the kingdom the power the glory
[1:23:45] in a small prayer its Christ himself
[1:23:48] pray that
[1:23:49] hallelujah because forgiveness is
[1:23:51] whether death is really Act in this age
[1:23:53] that's why it's hell on the earth that's
[1:23:56] why so much discord among brethren
[1:23:58] that's what people separated by doctrine
[1:24:00] hallelujah because it's not Christ in
[1:24:02] their hearts and other things in their
[1:24:04] hearts but the prophets saw the brain
[1:24:06] with the blood upon her of the age upon
[1:24:11] a chest therefore brotherly kindness
[1:24:13] will be manifested will be displayed not
[1:24:17] temporary kindness
[1:24:20] not loving those who love you
[1:24:23] not liking those who you like who like
[1:24:26] you that's foolishness you
[1:24:30] maybe see the Prince God hallelujah

[1:24:37] that don't mean nothing got it even here
[1:24:39] in that the enzyme not even recognizing
[1:24:41] that you better say Amen if this is the
[1:24:43] word

[1:52:23] will be open and the seven mysteries the
[1:52:25] several mysteries that have been left
[1:52:26] off in every age some have been left off
[1:52:30] reformer didn't have time to take care
[1:52:32] of it in this a looter he preached a
[1:52:34] fiction my fate he was gone they made a
[1:52:36] church where the personification along

[1:52:44] giving you information be giving a
[1:52:45] promises and Peter said by these
[1:52:47] promises you become partakers of this
[1:52:50] divine nature not like information by by

[1:53:16] and so forth of the loud easier but he
[1:53:18] has seen the devil don't know this this
[1:53:21] is the mystery that imagine in laude say

[1:53:47] Pentecostal church then
[1:53:50] we want to be what Ephesus was
[1:53:54] our church Omega church the authority
[1:53:57] Peter had must come back

[2:02:37] there we go and as Joshua just before
[2:02:41] that Ephesians wisdom so that John the
[2:02:44] Baptist raised up just before the next
[2:02:46] Ephesians and we are promised another
[2:02:49] Ephesians and it is predicted here in
[2:02:52] the scripture therefore I think we are
[2:02:55] living in the Ephesians again
[2:02:58] therefore we know that leader couldn't
[2:03:01] get it west and so forth but in the last
[2:03:04] days we are given the understanding by
[2:03:07] the word that we are going to understand
[2:03:09] it because they will come and Ephesians
[2:03:12] is to it and I believe he is just as
[2:03:15] evil this afternoon the cause in this
[2:03:17] building a paradox because he promised
[2:03:19] it would happen no but I've only seen
[2:03:22] this under a message called paradox and
[2:03:24] it won't paradox means
[2:03:26] incredible but true I love that so any
[2:03:32] paradox he is prophesying of another
[2:03:35] Ephesians it's incredible but you have
[2:03:40] hell on the earth but they can be
[2:03:42] visions it happens on the earth but
[2:03:45] they're gonna be visions it's having
[2:03:47] lukewarm and Mossback church members in
[2:03:49] the church but there's gonna be another
[2:03:51] easiness it has back certain creatures
[2:03:53] but there's gonna be another Ephesians
[2:03:59] are you with me in other words when the
[2:04:03] devil eat the stump of the tree right

[2:17:57] the book writer Jordan Oh hallelujah

[2:18:03] believe that so there is where the
[2:18:05] tumblers is at the seven thunders is
[2:18:08] that Ephesians
[2:18:10] when you cross over you have to cross
[2:18:13] over into the tunnels and the thunders
[2:18:15] will produce another Ephesians the ton
[2:18:17] that's my revelation suppose that leaves
[2:18:19] the Calvary supposed to leave us that
[2:18:22] depth herself we have to have power over
[2:18:24] self before we are power over others Oh

[2:21:09] today that's call of God to step into
[2:21:12] the tracks where Jesus should what a
[2:21:14] commission but each that's call of God
[2:21:17] is Commission to stand in the same place
[2:21:18] I'll be with you even in you today
[2:21:21] another way each Minister called this
[2:21:24] town where he would the works that I do
[2:21:26] shall you also each minister ordained of
[2:21:28] God is command to stand in the tracks of
[2:21:31] Jesus Christ and perform the duties that
[2:21:34] Jesus performed that's quite a command
[2:21:36] not just talk but perform the duties Oh
[2:21:40] hallelujah watch how it must have felt
[2:21:44] when Judge must and in the morning when
[2:21:45] God said I would not feel you know leave

[2:21:50] and make a week therefore you know there
[2:21:52] is a great lot of types to go into that
[2:21:53] Moses was not permitted to take the
[2:21:55] chair and over because he had field
[2:21:59] and the church
[2:22:02] organizations denomination has field and
[2:22:05] that's why quarrel raised up a Joshua
[2:22:08] generation
[2:22:10] because all what Moses did it came to a
[2:22:13] dead end and it couldn't cross so God
[2:22:17] had to take off Moses of the scene here
[2:22:19] this part God does equalizer will raise
[2:22:22] up a new system an
[2:22:25] interdenominational system by the power
[2:22:28] of God
[2:22:30] by the power of God that will take the
[2:22:35] church into the Promised Land
[2:22:36] Organization denomination has messed it
[2:22:38] up each one after the own theology each
[2:22:41] one after the one way of thinking but
[2:22:43] God will take his Holy Spirit and will
[2:22:47] raise his Joshua that will take the
[2:22:50] church to the promise with no
[2:22:52] dimensional string string tied it at all
[2:22:56] God called ministers author not to be
[2:22:58] stuffed up a theology but has visited
[2:23:00] the land to where they're gonna bring
[2:23:02] back evidence of divine love and power
[2:23:04] of the Lord Jesus to make known to the
[2:23:06] communication that is a land beyond the
[2:23:08] river and this is something but a prince
[2:23:10] had preached he said when we get to the
[2:23:12] river it divides and separate us once on
[2:23:15] the other side here we go something
[2:23:17] happens to you know Joshua in all this
[2:23:21] knowing that the command was great but
[2:23:23] having the assurance he could be
[2:23:25] fearless he could be we call it reckless
[2:23:28] as long as he was pointed the right way
[2:23:31] so can the Church of the Living God be
[2:23:34] reckless and fearless if the feet is
[2:23:37] pointed in the right way Oh glory to God
[2:23:40] amen isn't that right so the first stage
[2:23:42] is coming out of the land then the
[2:23:44] second see the Sun of occasion through
[2:23:45] the blood but the TEDx stage is when the
[2:23:48] cross Jordan into the promised land
[2:23:49] where the promised slave go and pass
[2:23:53] them he said no remember you have to
[2:23:54] pass by your brethren and they are near
[2:23:57] the border line if you pass by them do
[2:23:59] see nothing to them I have given Esau

[2:24:15] habits which is their behavior I give
[2:24:18] Esau this mountain don't touch him I've
[2:24:20] got something for you
[2:24:21] Suva and I'm gonna close with this
[2:24:24] that's my desire brethren to see my
[2:24:28] church cross over into another land a
[2:24:30] desire to move over to the other side if
[2:24:33] there's something new here first call in

[2:41:48] can we give the Lord some worship this
[2:41:50] morning
[2:41:51] you appreciate the message is forming
[2:41:54] you're preaching the Lord is mourning my
[2:41:57] let us cross Jordan to an open vision of
[2:42:03] another Ephesians it's an open vision
[2:42:06] it's a clear vision it's a precise
[2:42:10] vision and the Bible says write the
[2:42:12] vision to make it clean so we can run
[2:42:14] into action when we see the vision do
[2:42:17] you see the vision this morning do you
[2:42:19] see that you have to Ty out and you have
[2:42:22] to get into action
[2:42:23] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:42:27] Lord my my my was I had to ask but over
[2:42:30] the Deanna lasciviously what year was
[2:42:32] this again because he doesn't look one
[2:42:35] day older and this was four years ago so
[2:42:38] you're preaching a pastor this morning
[2:42:42] [Music]
[2:42:44] and
[2:42:45] the way he's preaching him like this
[2:42:47] could have been preached last month it's
[2:42:50] consistent
[2:42:52] so we certainly appreciate the Lord and
[2:42:55] we pray that God will continue to
[2:42:56] strengthen him as we get ready to leave
[2:42:58] this place how they lujah because it was
[2:43:01] after Elijah across Jordan and then
[2:43:03] Elijah left us and left us he was caught
[2:43:06] up in a chariot of fire and any lies I
[2:43:08] had to recognize it was not just just a
[2:43:11] mantle
[2:43:13] because he had the mantle but then he
[2:43:15] had to ask some more important question
[2:43:17] Elijah is gone but his God is still here
[2:43:20] so where is a Lord God of Elijah and
[2:43:23] then the school of the prophets who have
[2:43:26] been watching him all along had to take
[2:43:28] note when he struck that River again
[2:43:30] that the spirit of Elijah taught rest
[2:43:33] upon a light show and the devil will
[2:43:35] have to take note that the spirit that
[2:43:37] was upon that Elijah prophet taught rest
[2:43:40] upon this Elijah prime the same
[2:43:43] anointing the same spirit I was upon
[2:43:45] Jesus was they on the Alpha church and
[2:43:48] same spirit that is the holy spirit
[2:43:51] Jesus changed from to give you not part
[2:43:54] of himself but all of himself because
[2:43:57] all that was in court he ported the
[2:43:59] Christ and all that was in Christ he
[2:44:01] ported to this church can the church see
[2:44:04] man that's how you could do creature
[2:44:06] back then Elijah had two acts for a
[2:44:09] double portion but in our time he
[2:44:12] declared the double portion he said the
[2:44:14] same works I do shall you do also and
[2:44:17] even even asked me greater what shall
[2:44:20] you - because as my father sent me so
[2:44:23] send I you
[2:44:25] we are on a mission we are on a mission
[2:44:27] and Jordan is part of the process to
[2:44:31] finish the mission it's not about the
[2:44:33] mountain it's not about the sky it's not
[2:44:36] about the pain it's about the mission
[2:44:38] and our soldiers in the army of the Lord
[2:44:40] we have to cross our individual Jordan
[2:44:43] on our individual mission to get to our
[2:44:47] inheritance you have an inheritance I
[2:44:51] have an inheritance we have an
[2:44:53] inheritance and we're gonna believe in
[2:44:55] this place
[2:44:56] hallelujah I see it all the time I don't
[2:44:59] want to leave this place to get away
[2:45:01] from problems you know
[2:45:04] before we leave this place every problem
[2:45:07] should be on our feet
[2:45:10] can the church amen
[2:45:12] hallelujah I never want to go to rap to
[2:45:15] get away from problems no problems have
[2:45:18] to know who I am
[2:45:19] hallelujah the world must know who I am
[2:45:22] the whole peace and groaning to the
[2:45:25] manifestation of the sons of God till
[2:45:27] born sons fill sons please son speak and
[2:45:31] whatever they say will be created right
[2:45:34] there whatever you have neither brother
[2:45:36] Jason you speak the words without hands
[2:45:38] we live because that's how God did it
[2:45:41] and that's the DNA that God planted in
[2:45:43] you that the temple cannot take away we
[2:45:46] have an opposition of another Ephesians

[2:53:41] have the menu posted up as quickly as we
[2:53:44] can but we did read a menu but more than
[2:53:47] the food is really the spiritual
[2:53:49] fellowship and being able to spend time
[2:53:51] with a family of God because soon
[2:53:53] there'll be a time we will not be able
[2:53:55] to do this can the church say Amen but

[2:54:19] cannot contain it and we leave this
[2:54:21] place to meet the law can the church say
