glad to be here today now fellowship but just and we have our precious brother Peter Chandler they're gonna bless you this morning know that you'll be blessed I justify comes just a few thoughts - sure just a few words from the Branum were speaking about the token and said pastor Moses spoke and said you have got to get beneath the blood for God said blood as a token it's a token no matter how much you believe how much you're circumcised that's the Covenant God gave to Abraham and so forth that's the Covenant but you've got to get beneath the blood that's the token when I see the Blood I will pass that's denomination either one you must come beneath the blood Methodist Baptist Presbyterian in the costal on denomination whatever you are it's for an individual you've got to come beneath the blood not just to talk about it may I use his words all outside of Christ will perish how do you get into Christ first Corinthians 12 by one spirit not by one handshake not by one membership but not by one denomination that's what they're trying to make it but by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and if an angel from heaven teaches anything else Paul said let him be accursed that's the message comment to Christ look any person outside of the token God was not responsible and God is not responsible for any person they got small popular or unpopular rich or poor bond or free male or female he is not responsible for anyone from under that stroking covenant he's not responsible you say Lord I did this I cast out devils I preach the gospel depart from me you don't work iniquity I never knew you he only recognized a token do you hear the coalition said Amen so now it's upon you he said sitting down in the woods the other day the boys was wondering here's two days I even he didn't even shoot a squirrel they said what was the matter see what it was he said please sit upon them said no longer was the burden of the Prophet it was the boon of the people to begin to apply the token he's a play set upon them no it is in your lap it's in yours he won't recognize nothing but that covenant of the Holy Spirit and you cannot receive that covenant unless you are saved sanctified and then baptized into the body you only recognize the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this train in the name of Jesus receive it God is your joy God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency he's my all sufficiency in him all things I have need is in him I saw strength my he'll come from the Lord you Christians look to him for your joy look to him for your strength look to him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life that's the Covenant remember only safe when the token was displayed and if a man was here under here and his son was across the street he was in danger he would perish his daddy would receive or if their son was over here his daddy was over there his daddy would perish only the token when I see the token I will pass over you that's the only thing less horse town is gonna bring God's servant to the platform praise God through the blood through the blood we can come into his presence through the blood [Music] the blood into his rash [Music] his breath [Music] just one more time just one more time we're singing [Music] [Music] [Applause]

it in remembrance of me 2 Corinthians 3 sweeps it on in verse 6 by saying who hath made us able ministers of the New Testament I appreciate the able ministers of this message Amen and I salute you and respect you amen hallelujah he says not the letter not just legalism Amen but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life Hebrews 9 even says more this is the blood of the New Testament which God hath enjoined to you and revelation 5:9 says it all and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every nation sorry kindred and tongue and people and nation hallelujah let's go to the next slide as we pray now gracious God in the name of Jesus Christ we

here to be sure for this amen and the Bible says he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for redemption a man of the Congressional under the first Testament they might receive the promise of eternal inheritance where there is a testament there must also of necessity be the death of the testator hallelujah because a testament is of force after men are dead when they die it has more power hallelujah otherwise it is of no strength while the testator lives but when the testator dies it has power hallelujah it has power hey man his voice is even louder glory to God a testament what do we call this in plain English we call it a will if that's right shout amen we call it a will hallelujah this is God's will concerning you God's will he wants you to be healed he

fellowship tonight we're in a fellowship tonight Oh which is only given to the church God's only provide a place of worship hallelujah we give God glory and praise that his blood has been shed let's move on brother brother Nick amen but token is the blood that that has been applied because it follows the blood it follows the blood it follows the blood every age hallelujah mapa every age he follows to see that it is brought forth hallelujah they could not be made perfect without us now can we shout now the entire Holy Spirit amen visits the church making God in human flesh in other words

in control amen amen amen let's move on quickly brother Nick praise be to God the voice amen many people be seated for a moment many people loved the sign brother Branham gave us the sign but what about the voice where there's a sign there's a voice of that sign is that correct where this is the sign was great but all brother the voice has followed and watch the voice of the sign there is a voice to the side so when brother branham starts talking about the savior church ages I say amen brother when he starts talking about capstone and say amen brother man the section amen that's the voice of the side there is a voice to the sign there is a voice to the blood hallelujah because the blood speak from the earth and the blood of Abel spoke out against Cain the blood has a voice and
