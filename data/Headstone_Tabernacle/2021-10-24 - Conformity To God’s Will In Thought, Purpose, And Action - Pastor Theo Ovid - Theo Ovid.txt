heaven this morning oh glory to god there'll be a church with jesus walking in it and the shout of the king will be in the camp so this morning before you take your c system our bibles to psalms one we want to read verse one to six that's one scripture this morning psalms 1 1-6 it's a long time i'm trying to get to the sound blessed is the man that walketh not in the console of the ungodly who stands it in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of this cornfield but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law that he meditate the united hear about this man what he shall be like and he shall be like a tree planted not not a sea drop planted by the rivers of water that bringing forth his fruit in his season his leave about his leaf notion also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper the ungodly and not so but unlike the chaff which to drink drive it away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord know that we have the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish one more time let's pray father we thank you for the scriptures we love the word we love to hear your word lord and we pray interpreted our hearts blessed in jesus may ask it even you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord thank you musicians thank you for the song service praise god brother anthony we certainly appreciate all of you coming out this morning we are open for business the lord's business jesus said this way i must be about my father's business okay let's go our title conformity to god's will in thought purpose and action that's the title this morning conformity to god's will in thought in purpose and action i trust you're being blessed by the bible studies and they've been blessed by the weekly services services being played and the bible study we talk about surrender and then so on like that and i hope that it really strikes you that that god really means this because we're getting somewhere with it all right now this word conform [Music] as a verb it's to comply with rules standards or laws it is to be similar to or the same as something it is to do what other people do to be obedient or compliant usually used with two to conform to other wishes in other words they would say the building doesn't conform to local regulations that's an example that's what conform is another explanation of it to act in accordance or harmony to comply usually followed by two to conform to rules if you conform you behave in the way that you are expected or supposed to behave he did not feel obliged to conform to the rules that apply to ordinary men that's the context of using that word conform so that is a a rebel he did not feel obliged to conform to the rules that apply to ordinary men synonyms of this would conform is to fit in to follow to yield to adjust now when cain and abel was asked to offer up a sacrifice to god there were children they come at age maturity god said let me see what you your concept of me how you see me we know the story abel bought a lamb slate and god respected king brought fruits god rejected it and god gave king over do like your brother and i'll bless you too if you do it i'll i let's confirm just just follow you don't even need a revelation he did that and was blessed you do that you get blessed too you don't even need a revelation to do it just do it and people fight conforming they don't want to be similar too now we know the story with the wedding when you in the old testament the wedding and i kind of saw it in africa a bit it was kind of blowing my mind um because in hotel and when i looked down there was a wedding in hotel we were staying in and everybody was wearing the same garment uh maybe different style but the same color material and the first time i'm seeing this and it kind of brings to light what the prophet shared of how it was in those days in those days when you come to the wedding you will give them a garment so you are just walking you know when you get at the door at the door you get the garment to put on so everybody looks similar everybody look the same so when the master of the house came he saw somebody not looking similar or the same he saw somebody with a different he said friend oh you come in here because every time you pass through the door everybody get a garment at the door they say buying him hand on foot no he call him friend so he knew who it was but he said but where's the garment because barbara says that is what the baptism of the holy ghost does it make us all the same it make us all similar it make us all like one we dress in the same garment [Music] [Applause] so you see when you have the same garment nobody can storm the wedding oh you call it i can forget what they call it um crash sweating crashes they can't crash you with it so tell america when i see the food down there i said what if i go wrong there you go see i know garment i i ain't got it i didn't get a revolutionary clothes everybody who had the clothes because they were invited they may have been given the claw to what to buy or whatever it is make it however you want to make it but come dressed the same way then any crook in his teeth any sneaker because he gets immediately exposed and that is what this gospel come to do to dress us in the same way there's no big me and little you there's no big shot and who higher than who and who are more powerful than who it doesn't have that in the kingdom or give the lord a shout we have a job we have our purpose oh praise the name of the lord so king didn't want to comply or conform and there are a lot of people like that they don't like orders they don't like to be pushed around when you understand you want to be pushed around because they want to be right as i said in the bible study some people like to ask questions because they don't want people to know that they don't know and what you don't know is what's going to get you blues and you don't know what you don't know so you better find out oh glory to god let me say it again what you know you know but what you don't know is what's going to stick you and this is where you come to the service for to get the mind of god to get the mind of christ to get things that you don't know hallelujah that needs to be revealed to you by the spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord our next scripture context scripture romans 8 28 we know it and we know that all things not some work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestiny to be conformed to the image of his son here we get the next the word again whom he did pre-destiny for no he also did predestinated to be conformed that means to be influenced to change transform conform line up with what is required of you that is what you are predestinated onto not do your own thing but to be conformed all glory to god hallelujah and we say conform is to comply with rules that you don't be the rule breaker of god laws yes they are trying to break rules like man rules but they can't break god rules you would pay for that oh glory to god hallelujah god have his rules god have no spoiled children at all every sunday coming to god gonna be disciplined every son that cometh to god god was set right god they're gonna god another daughter's grandfather hallelujah spoil his children he straightened out noah he's straightened on moses he said no joshua he will straighten you out what your father do you god's gonna do you what your mother didn't do you god can do you god's gonna do you your husband don't wanna straighten me out god go straighten you out oh glory to god gonna straighten you out because every son that commits must be tested must be tried and you don't set the exam paper or give the lord a shout you don't tell god what kind of test to give you oh stop complaining because complaining weakens your faith we have a scripture we just give you and we know that all things work together for good god put it up front if the power says demand the living rapture you don't have to worry about nothing you know just believe the past and you're safe but you're heading straight for the tribulation with our foolishness straight to the tribulation not even a landing pad like a direct ticket to the tribulation and we know first thing you see nothing is in order you know that's right so he put that up front and we know that all things work together for good to them not love god to make quality purpose and so on like that right all right now watch for whom he did for know that he also did predestinated to what to put the water come and sit on another church bench to say in our message to say or join some church no who we for know he also did predestinated to be conformed to and we just read for your conformed as work when we were too conformed to the image of his son oh glory to god not conformed to church not conformed to some doctrine conformed to the image of his son therefore the image has to be projected that you could see it and as we behold the image we are changed from glory to glory as by the spirit of the lord or can the lord have shouted in the house [Applause] to be conformed to him his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren or this is one of the creative scriptures you could think about identifying what you predestinated unto to be conformed and when you get conformed you become similar to jesus and you identify jesus as your big brother the firstborn among many brethren you are just a little one below him coming up coming up oh give the lord a shout that's god's purpose that's god's spam forgive the lord when you confront his image then he become the firstborn [Applause] glory to god he becomes the firstborn among many brethren he called you brethren oh glory to god he said that that day you shall know saint john 14 20 i am in the father you and me and i knew oh could you give the lord a shout this morning [Applause] so you can see now by this scripture by the text god i want you in the realm of cinema and save and

lord a prayer saying nothing let's continue what is the light and desire this man this man this man everybody like this a new host a new car they see light and desire are in the law of the lord and on his law the precepts the instructions the teachings of god he habitually meditates ponders and studies day and night day and night it's in his heart it started getting his thinking and when he started getting your thinking it is getting your mouth because i'm from the abundance of the heart the mother speak so what you're meditating on what you're thinking on what you're studying it has eventually come out your mouth okay the lord i shout oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god it have to come out your mouth thoughts purpose action and he shall be like a tree planted and tended by the streams of water ready to bring forth its fruits in its season and leaf also shall not fade or whether everything he does shall prosper and come to maturity not so the wicked doors disobedient and living without god and not soul so when you're disobeying your wicked ear you know the bible says rebellion is that you see now witchcraft fighting the pastor fighting the world you're fighting in the ministry of fighting you feel the fighter because you don't want to conform they say sit here you don't want to sit here you want remember some reasons ago sister is your next sister you're comfortable your seat it again next year i would tell you didn't move move you miserable spirits reason of assists our city our city they don't want to even listen god could inspire the usher to put you in a certain place by the angel of the lord coming to visit you in that seat but because you're in a cuckoo mood you have to do his hair and you want this here and all you want is your way and when you get your way you feel like the right way hallelujah they're not conforming doesn't follow him no oh yes as we say uh uh when god say uh walk around jericho so much at times it's not a matter of that train on the wall is a matter of following in instruction that what god wants you know to see if you'd follow instructions god has been simple instructions to see if we'll follow go and show yourself to the priest the lepers he know the original priest he just said go on to yourself to the priest all were healed in obedience to god so what god tests enforcement is obedience no you'd rather you come to church but but they come to church to hear the word the word is bring instructions that you may act on it no you could hear it and say you know what you're a good sermon but in what you're hearing have things for you to act on if you don't act on it it's just remaining here on stage and therefore you ain't changing at all like a woman at times you say she said my husband dead he never changed me she proud of that he never changed me dead and gone he had changed me yeah but life have a way of doing some stuff oh man if you are part of this bright body god going to arrange certain things that come in your way that you will not be able to stop that will change you we cannot continue the way we are going you have to have a design you have to be changed to be transformed i am challenging you not to remain as you are tell yourself this morning god give me a fresh infusion of thoughts reveal your purpose to my life that i could get into action because what you're getting here by the word is god's will god will is his word do you believe that hallelujah i'm going to skip all the rest amen second timothy tree almost like a bible study second timothy 3 16-17 and this is where i get the title from all scripture all shout out all all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly finished onto all good works in the amplified every scripture is god breathed given by inspiration and profitable for instruction for reproof and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience and here we go for training in righteousness training in what in righteousness in holy living in conformity to god's will in thought purpose and action so that the man of god may be complete and proficient well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work so this scripture or the scriptures is for training in righteousness in holy living in conformity to god's will in thought purpose and action remember something i keep saying over and over when israel came out they didn't know who god is moses was smart enough to say them people is trouble tell me who i see who shall i say send me because they go asks because israel is a stiff neck they're not easy you know go tell them tell them i am senior anybody ask tell them i am that i so moses wants to bring them to the mountain for them to get instructions for to get god laws so they get all good things and fields remember it's got to be talking about even if you're going a job you

are christian now brother brown god doesn't deal with the church as an organization amen he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church and when a man proves it's no secret we all see it see it when a man proves and god loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself dear in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up dear in the presence of god gives him fills him and sets him out that's the age we're living in what kind of man is that a psalms one man oh glory to god that's a psalms one man a man walking in god a man meditating on a word there night a man that god has planted by the rivers of water because he choose to catch god's purpose god's mind god's thoughts god's will he choose that and god will take him aside and bless that man to let the world know let your neighbor know let your family know let your enemy know that his hand is upon you forget them please god don't try to please your family please god [Music] i ain't you give the lord a shout and that don't please the your family got forsaken you know they gonna abandon you they gonna do whatever they want but please god first can we go deeper now we're coming to you now but as i was saying coming to your home when i'm coming to your home i'm coming to you jesus said who taken torque and what cuba to statue you can't make it here black or white you are what you are by the grace of god god had did this not what you done and when you try to make yourself something different i like to make myself a billy graham but it wouldn't do me no good i'd like to make myself a brother mitchell stand up and preach like that earn backset didn't do no good i must be william branham i often talk about brother roberts and those who pray for the sick and the way they did and how those bridges go out and pray for great hosts and they never know no kickbacks if they didn't pray for this or that i can't be an orobots god made me or god made orbits what he is i have to be william branham and all of us can be william branham so we are what we are by the grace of god it's all set together in the church for the perfecting of the church the working together of the good for those who love god so i am who i am by god's grace god made me thus god made you dust god don't want you to be like this one and that one god wants you to be you but he wants you to be conformed to the image all of us going to be conformed to the image if that 10 images is one image faith virtue knowledge temperance is that the answer to every situation patience godliness brotherly kindness the answer to everything oh glory to god to the ungodly it's of godliness to the impatience is our patience to the unbelief without faith that those who are weaker than virtue or give the lord i shout and those who have oughts and grudges it's a brotherly kindness oh dear the lord i shout how much time must i forgive my brother 70 x 7 a day [Applause] no watch here we go you know something called a lie detector right put you on a machine and assist in questions and if you lie the machine has started to do something so like like like lie in line line line line when they're talking normal first they ask a question there the way there's original there's actually a question that is you know it's true your name is so-and-so that's right machine going straight so eleven so and so the machine goes straight through did you steal the thing on the job no i did not motion to do so because the machine not recording your words you know your pressure your pulse your heart because man wasn't made a lie god set it up that way god god set the door away so you say i did not steal you could say it's off the machine saying do something you're going to say well i did not do it still doing so because it wasn't built to lie now listen to this this is powerful the lie detector will not work on your mind it work on your soul [Music] so what he's saying it is working at the subconscious level not your conscious because some people when they line with ultra light detector that's the light called the first light and the light covers the second light that's remotely lights there's plenty working it better since the treatment is one treat coming out you know but when you lie and you come up like lie afterwards you had a measure that's how police does find emotion when they do stuff they tell you a story they take notes and three months after they come let me hear the story again and i hear a different thing come out because you see your yeah the current memory is it so far back all right let's continue they can impersonate yet it's been a lie and can impersonate it till they can receive like anything now satan is the best that there is there for he deceive eve okay now this person what if you could get this soul on the inside so in harmony with god that your soul and god could be one together then you could ask what you will and it shall be given to you oh he's going deeper many people come to me many times in the prayer line and stand here and say oh brother branham i have plenty faith i've got faith like to move mountains and yet they haven't any faith they hardly have enough fear to get to the platform but they are conscious of one thing they do believe they are believing intellectually with their mind now take take this not as i am preaching something but take this as brother branham here explaining what is happening with people and you can see what will happen be happening with you and with us all right he said now watch they are conscious of one thing they do believe they are believing intellectually with their mind and their mind will never bring them to god your mind is reasoning and god has no reason so that's why you hear people give a testimony they went to a service and they don't know how they reached the altar there was an ibaka they pew and when the preachers had to preach something moved them and they find yourself at the altar tears in the eye and they want to save the lord or whatnot that is not mind you know that is the spirit of god do something to their heart and pull them to the that is not mine you understand those who follow others this is what you are going through that is head dicey wonder dollars you see because that end not a heart conviction okay so you're watching the operation of the spirit now let's continue now if you can reason out your mind will tell you now look here doctors say i can't get it over it's impossible the doctor with his intellect with his intelligence with his knowledge of medical science he has told you the best of the travel of his mind and you take in your mind and using the same thing the doctors told you god could never touch that line as long as you reason let's put down reason god never made us to live by our intellect we live by the holy spirit that's in our soul and that says no to any reason that is contrary to god's word then watch when god would say the soul there is nothing in the world standing its way and when you do that you are getting down on the right side of god you are getting down till you can ask what you want to it will be given to you because there's nothing between there there's no reason they stand in your way get your mind out of the way you don't have to say what your reason what you see what you think say what god say to be truth that can only come from inside from the heart not from the intellects then he went on to this year there is where so many people today is going to be terribly disappointed at the day of judgment to know that they lived in church to know that they have got done good deeds to know they have treated their neighbor right to know that they are loyal to people loyal to the church and in their mind i believe that jesus christ the son of god and be condemned at the day of judgment jesus said many are called and few are chosen straight is the gate now is the way that leads to life but few that be that find it no as i was saying a few days ago i want you to pay close attention put a lie detector on you and you could try to impersonate the truth try to say it's the truth but dawn on the inside of you in the subconscious lays a place called the soul and this intellectual mind here we go does not govern the vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you but it is very incapable of bringing you to god your mind you cannot know god by your mind intellectual it's one of the resources or the channels that you could lead to it here we go but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul that's a defining statement not by your house and land it have crooked people have house lanca aeroplane boats and everything else and they're crooked as their teeth liars running after children and all kind of stuff like that but you are what you are by your soul or give the lord some praises so the object of this gospel holy ghost gospel is to get your subconscious and conscious line up together to get your soul lined up with the word to get your heart and mind line up with your word isn't that right as a man thinks in his heart so is he now when you come and i think we said it a couple of years ago we were preaching about when somebody born to the british royal family uh a little child born prince harry prince this prince that princess this or whatever it is then they're born into royalty they don't know as babies they are royal if you put them on the train appearance they'll betray the audience they will go to school they will run around they would they will do just what training others do but because in that environment they are being taught they are being trained they are being told they are shown history they show the history of the lineage of how much queen and who was the queen queen and who was the master and what all of that and that give them a consciousness when they begin to walk the streets cameras kicking on them they say stop taking a picture i will get vex i got boss ahead they're not talking that way they're supposed to get pictures the press supposed to follow after them because they're royalty hallelujah they belong to a royal family well you belong to a royal family also you are royalty the royal seat of abraham you are royalty oh the devil's supposed to be looking at you come on look at them don't look at me he looking at you he could never be royalty he could never have what you have he could never get your inheritance he could never get his name on the book or give the lord a praise offering you are royalty oh glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god royalty had to be handled a certain way so every time listen they have something like what they call i need to take care of them not the modern father you know because they might have to be taking care of a certain way they can't get all ragamuffin to go and tell them things some old teeth make them steal they say you're a thief and prince they can't have that they have the right tutor and god have the shooter also the truth is the holy ghost god said in tutor to truth to you because you are loyalty you're coming unto something you're predestinated unto something you have to be conformed to something so go to the first deal with your thought oh give the lord a praise offering so first you come just as you are a sinner you know nothing about god so then god has introduced you his thoughts he said my twas are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways as high the heavens above the earth so my thoughts above your thoughts so you have to god god's will in his thoughts in his thinking in his purpose and the action that god wants you to get into what give the lord a praise often so when you come to church you come to catch the thoughts of god you come to touch the mind of god you can because the will of god our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven okay the lord has shouted in the house oh glory to in your heart have the desire for god's will import in purpose and in action oh glory to god that is what you want to conform to that is what you want to confirm i don't know about you but for the past couple of services i'm seeing god just close in the gap it's like a pyramid all the time was wide at the bottom but see as i get closer to the top it the clap is narrows it narrows some people fall off you know in a broad part of the gap because they see it gets steeper as they climb higher oh give the lord a shout come on now do you see that pyramid no in the broad path tons of people could stay on there but as you get higher it gets deeper you want to continue if any man come after me let him deny himself let him take off his cross you want to continue come on now come on now give the lord a shout this is the gospel this is the word this is the truth [Music] i have come in for no selfish christianity bless me lord bless my family before my children jesus name amen i ain't going for that who we foreign who we call it justified i come here for that who justifies he has already glorified are coming for that he predestinated to conform to the image i come here for that i want to know about this image i want to know about the image of christ i want that emotion live in me i want my wife to see it oh glory to god you heard what i said i living with my wife she had to see it i want her to see it i want my children to see it i want my daughter in laws here too i will my grandchildren see it i want you to see it well you must want people to see it it'll have to ooze out to you that oh glory to god how to be in you better to see it oh give the lord a shout we're saying i say you have to say it too you must want a wife to see it see what it at the image not you and your dread self not you and your angry self not you and your temper self not you and your rude self or give the lord i shout not you and your bad self here come into horn and change myself it's good to have game blows you know [Music] but not even supposed to be wrong is it good hindi from being perfect somebody in church too long you're coming to christ now there's a big one you know somebody watching like what am i talking about here yeah do you wonder well she was a real direct believer she was backstage she was out of favor with god but her name was on the book jesus was the book i wanted a book on walking dead give me wasn't a drink i mean another story you said go call your husband lie detector started put on work he put the light detector now go call your husband she said i have none she said he said that is true because you have five and the one you're living is not yours oh god hallelujah say you speak the truth they're speaking from your soul they're speaking with unconscious hallelujah he's a loser and let her go when jesus finished with a woman she ran and said come see your man who told me all that i did [Music] [Applause] is not this the christ [Music] [Applause] speak the truth even if it's against you it's still the truth hallelujah you shall know the truth god revealed truth he didn't hold it back you shall know the truth with jesus and the truth it will set you free we can't come and deceive you until if you stay in this church you're gonna make the bride that's a lie hallelujah i'll be fooling you if you follow me you mean it right i know what he would say he had to get him magnetized not to me to the headstone god could call me off in the morning but you ought to be magnetic headstone if god called me off i waited on you to come to perfection somebody had to be alive and remain devil can't take all of us he's a liar the grim reaper can come and reap all of us he may take one year one day but all of us know he can't do that we have to have those that are alive and remain shall not hinder them that's our sleep oh give the lord a shout night is not dead modest is not dead they're sleeping oh give the lord a shout when lazarus was dead jesus said he's not dead he's asleep i go wake him it just goes to show where they're going they could come back oh get the lord and shout don't make me started running camera inside of here this morning oh glory to god this is not the only world the only thing

world anymore oh glory i'll even yet before i leave here before we leave here we got my testimony oh glory to god enoch had a testimony that he please god oh give the lord [Music] [Applause] you can't please god but you cannot mind cannon enmity against god can i remind us fight god your human spirit does fight god oh glory to god you can only please god when you get in the spirit and in the spirit you get the thoughts of god oh glory to god the cannibal mind cannot please god no flesh man could please god you're the king of that canality you gotta get out your stinking rotten flesh that's what this gospel is about not to tell you how nice you are but to bust that flesh off for you that you could see god you can have faith in god look at the lord the promises of god [Applause] jesus prayed in saint john 5 17 that the church and he would become one like like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of christ would be one together just as he is the father one and at that day we will know that he was in the father fighting him and he and us together we are one what a union a oneness father in him to seek god in the church listen what a union a oneness that would be to see god in the church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and god amen that's the church that jesus coming for that's when his prayer will be answered so how come you claim to be in harmony with god are you not harmony with your brothers what kind of harmony is that that your own harmony you blowing your own tune it's not so enough it's sat with your brethren first if they can't love you about who you see it has it separate that person yeah yeah that's why the odds and grudges and it's only in this environment somebody can mash your toe if you stand by yourself and you see that christian and you you bet yourself who forgiven you who you forgiven you're fooling yourself deceive let people stay on my receive somebody i'm saying don't because i don't want to play tights they want to go play no offering yeah yeah yeah the loafing the loaf and being blessed yeah but they're limited yeah they don't want to get support so the people that stay

the famine in the land not a famine of bread nor taste for water but for hearing the words of the lord take heed what you hear and imagine we have an exhortation take heed what you hear and there's a famine in the land for the hearing of the word of the lord oh god help me jesus hallelujah and they shall wander from sea to sea from north to the east they shall run two and four to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it and hear the prophecy now there is not even a width of nice blade between the end of this age and the coming of christ there is nothing left israel is in the homeland congress amen are we in laodicea age has the message of this pentecostal age went forth to try to shake the people back to the original pentecostal blessing has every messenger come to the age exactly is the nation against nation pestilence is their family land today the true church drives hundreds of miles seeking to hear the word of god for the bread and not not for bread only but for the hearing of the word of lord become a famine but iran says no i'm going to type elijah with the church today just before judgment he received this message he represented being cared for in the natural his natural food because it wasn't going to rain now according to the word of the lord for three years and six months whatever time elijah said and there he there was the king he said it was not even with you or rainfall till i called for it that's quite a message and now we are going to type that with the spiritual throat of the day we all know we are very aware that there's a great spiritual drought in the land today spiritually speaking and was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of christ there will come a famine in the land it won't be for bread alone but for hearing of the word of the lord the hearing the truth of the lord sin and unbelief by false teachers and by modernists in the church has brought the praise that is coming on coming judgment they have turned down god's word and his prophet oh glory to god to a modern theological tune of the word that's why they're not saying what the tapes say that's why they're preaching their own thing that's why they're bringing their own revelations but he says the spirit the prophet and the pride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word oh give the lord i shout no man could bring no new mystery he's a liar oh glory to god amen oh give the lord a shout in the house rapturing the theaters laying in the messages and we preaching this word word pipe with [Applause] when god sends what a message and tell the people that they don't and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant and sends plagues famine debt spiritually speaking and physically also waiting coronavirus is a plague and he said we're striving to enter the king of god before these horrible plagues strike this plague is a down payment or what's coming but god promised some sons of god manifested sons he will say stop diseases stop cancer what are you looking to do in the rapture no why should why are you looking at rapture no i ain't stop no disease yet what the press coming down for what for books and dates press have to wait did you hear what i said the press coming on stay right there hold it right there we we we getting ready for you depressed how to wait this close and now churches all i have to wait that will wait and the results come from first until the true or not they come from first because we are too anointed unfortunately and we are seeing false anointed yet because the unknowns under the common can make them false but before they become false you have gotten only true you're not praying false dollar you see the new dollar that you have nobody didn't know that was coming that's a brand new dollar they can't copy where you can't see they'll have a seat to copy it so before they have false anointed and after true anointed and the true anointed have to come forward first that anointing is straight yet oh glory to god hallelujah i written on that to anoint him okay the lord i shall if the thing this little thing they see nothing yet i ain't get started yet you know this is warming up oh you think i'll be getting started we are stuck yet the lord himself went everywhere with them with them confirming the word with more word no with signs shout out

the pope they wonder about los angeles and biden and foxy and the vaccine and back of the beast when he all about that but we need to be conformed to the image of his son to go into this rapture or

of his own a family of sons sons like himself therefore before lies all mankind has one lumper clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the chosen will be his own chosen then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk he reproves them with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes his potter must take the vessel he is working on and probably break it down in order he may rebuild it exactly as he desires but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be oh little flock do not fear this age is going fast as it does those tears will be bound together as in a truthful chord is not easily broken they will have tremendous

there for my family and i want to give him the highest praise hallelujah i will keep thanking him and praising him all the d's of my life at this time he was speaking to me and i was ignoring it and i was doing my own thing and i found myself wanting to go and this is interesting go on my phone and sometimes watch a movie so that is why he changed everything around and put a situation with my eyes in front of me so now i have to pray or listen to a message so i can draw closer to him and be there where he wants me to be now is manifestation time thank you jesus for your grace and mercy god bless you all now this is an interesting praise because mr palmer has been struggling with her eyes and i note that she didn't sign up a prayer request for eyes she put up a note of praise that she found herself doing things that she shouldn't be doing and she saw this as god put a situation and allowed a situation for her eyes to take away from her phone and from the movies and other distractions that she found herself going to so she said now i find myself having to pray and listen to a message so i can draw closer to him what a perspective what know the praise for many years i've read praises and prayer because this is a different one and she didn't ask for prayer but we will pray for her this morning because that's what we do can the church say man it's another praise but we will pray for her as well and forgot to continue to be with our sister and heal her completely from the crown of her head to the souls of her feet we also want to bring this request from sister donaki for her husband but agarth please pray for my husband garth clark who is presently experiencing poor health please pray that god's fire of the holy ghost visit him even now and burn all his sickness out of his body and deliver him from himself and all the chains that bind him that's a noble request this morning sister donna and also from sister donna please continue to pray for my son
