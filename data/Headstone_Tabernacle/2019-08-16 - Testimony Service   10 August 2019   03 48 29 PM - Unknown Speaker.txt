convention and we put it under leadership in the name of Jesus amen [Applause] okay amen I am standing here to help the convention may everyone rise to his feet you've already don't leave the janitor Oliver likes to invite your reading attention to Genesis chapter 1 verse 8 I'm already here anyway chapter 1 verse 26 and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our own image in our own likeness and may he have dominion about the fish body birds in the Capitol little katsu and over the entire land and every animal across from the only face of the earth chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power the Holy Ghost falling upon you and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all the Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the world may the Lord are his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated if you will I am precisely here to help the convention and share my testimony we regard the convention with your permission I'd like to say but it was since 2013 I have been building a testimony with regard to the conventions here in Nigeria I have never missed a convention this is special grace from God for me it has not been an easy way an easy way but through God's grace God has given me the privilege to attain every single convention and it is not every time that we can come here that we understand or we make sense out of everything that is being British but whenever I'm here I know I am connected to the burden that I expect in the dynamics may God therefore bless you when I come here it's not based on what I'm going to hear but I just want to be connected to the move of the Spirit it's like yesterday when Pastor channels were ministering I didn't make sense of anything he was saying but I was too blatant with the words it was at the end of the meeting someone called me from Cameroon and interpreted it for me I do believe but that God does not speak English he does not speak French God speaks the language of the heart and it is that Landry that we need to fathoms and it is because of that that we are here to give testimony that God has brought us together for the language of the heart let me give it a topic for the 10 minutes that are ahead of me I'm allowed and I would like to speak or getting and out with power there is no Dominion without being filled or endowed with the power God told Adam you has to have dominion which means he has entrusted the power into the hands of freedom without power it is impossible to have dominion if the pride is ever going to have dominion it means the bride husband and down power virus inspiration of the seven thunders may God bless you abundantly Jesus Christ did not want to leave his church Felina in an orphanage I shall give you power I shall send you power because it is the return path returning either to me so now you can have the meat of my small church I want to tell you tonight that for Jesus Christ did no one to leave his church all the morning forces therefore he said he says bury until you so love the power and God Jesus Christ we saw that there is no power results no other power character and because pow pow vidonne kurata is a panic so he cries himself which are the seven lead voices and so on am i communicating anyway can I have your Lotus amen may I be brushed listen well are you with me here with his own nature any point in time by the orders from each circle then the other brother was coming to make a bigger circle all together we got into the ministry of the big circle so when they all got within the circle with you there was a mighty window and I do believe who's that the bride is set for a brand new Pentecost of the bride he soon will be the capstone coming now a man Church before he departed he didn't want to leave the church without power just like Jesus Christ did no one to leave the church powerless a man therefore Jesus Christ he took the power and he and he put it above the bride in the form of promise the promise is for you a man Church and when the Prophet was on the scene with the same vision he didn't want to leave the church without power from a bomb site suggest where 4702 make their voices heard and then my group when that group what is that group it is man and woman and God gasps builds a bigger circle so when you in the following hallelujah that the time is right souls is this the time to get endowed with the power yes sir sisters and brothers this completion as if nothing is happening God God he's scaring us getting rid of our old nature God is depriving us of the odd nature God is taking away our old character not is taking away every single meeting every convention we are putting on Christ is what we don't to become we are going to become word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit it shall it be mega bless you [Applause] brains gotta main depreciable alone see MA Jesus he never came to make a people that will be wretched here on earth not even the weak ones that was so weak until they cannot help themselves that's the reason why he promised he was sent for the power from on high you appreciate our brother and that power is here that power has been released and you are in his convention I want you to reach out and touch him and get that power activated is it you is it you do approachable alone see praise God Amin so I Paul Marshall a simple massage briefly take

greet you I want to greet you from Mauritius from my church Pina Tabernacle then I met a couple of ministers in Johannesburg they told me to send greetings to you brother David gonzalvez from from Johannesburg and brother David Dupree I want to thank your pastor for the charm he's the one who invited me I don't know how he got my name I thought maybe brother Jesse Robredo who came to my place last year can you understand my English because I am reading in English I don't put English I put in French in my country I am a missionary to the Madagascar for 23 years now and I preached in French everywhere they will let me get you my testimony first you know who I Who am I I was I was never a Christian I never read the Bible in my life I was born a Hindu a Hindu we pray to many gods we had many gods and I was born with asthma from the 8th from the age of three months therefore till the age of sixteen and my asthma got chronic and I thought I would die because I've seen people dying with asthma and the age of 16 I turned sour against God say there's no God I began to read books on atheism French books French philosophers and I said there is no God and then one day some young people came and testifying to my father but about Christ I was 16 years old and I was coming from school I want you listen closely I was coming from school palpitating gasping for breath and I have and I had a high fever and my dad told me that date was 16 May 1975 it told me will you go to church you know what in my religion I made a three oh wow to the gods to be healed of asthma and the way that we serve our God let me tell you be shocked we walk in fire on fire it's blazing hot fire we walk barefooted on fire that's how we hold our vows to God and we pierce our tongue with metal and our body we put hooks of metal hang all over with lemons hanging and we will walk and barefooted on the streets carrying our God instead of God carrying me I was carrying God I was carrying my god and we we we walk on we walk we have to walk on a ladder the ladder the rungs of the ladder of made of sharpened knives and it was devil worship we don't know we thought it was it was God we had many guards plenty of guards with many heads with many hands with ones even drinking blood you can see the blood coming on because what kind of girls are out praying but that day at 16th May 1975 when I came home from a school night that's it will you go to church and say which church I said to that church that the those young people told talk to us I said ok let's go I went there for the first time and I was sitting on the tenth pew with a short on me I came from a school you know 16 years old first time introduced to the Bible and the man was picking on the prodigal son and I was weeping I was crying right there on the tenth view I was saying to myself which is the book he's reading from extracting tears from my eyes and after the meeting he called for a prayer line I came in front I said when I came my turn said young man do you believe in mark 16 I looked at him I said mark 16 I've never read the Bible in my life what is mark 60 then he told me they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said we said do you believe that I remember with this childlike faith I never reason I was so against God but within a childlike faith I said yes and he laid hands on me with a nothing stopped right there instantaneously and and 44 years later I never got a fit of asthma in my leg no never I never heard of a testimony of a healing I am the testimony for healing myself nobody can get an alarm I'm Jesus Christ he's today I believe that cuz he healed me now listen from that time I began to testify our Jesus Christ and I was the semi of God may be seated o Assembly of God I was a Trinitarian and for four years listen I want to give must give me that time I've taken I've taken I've taken three flights to come here now listen to her Bridget I don't want to take much of your time but please listen to that then when I came to the Assembly of God it's a four years I got the Holy Ghost baptism with the speaking in tongues but after four years I felt like something is lacking in my life because alone the Bible said when the Holy Ghost shall come you shall I lead you into all the truth but yet that then I knew that our I got only the gift not the person of the holidays only the gift the need for more truth was in my heart I didn't know then that it was a deep calling to the deeper a little about that and after four years I left the Assembly of God I went on a mountain listen to my testimony I went on a mountain for one month but I would come down every every night I was working in an insurance company I would walk down every night about midnight come home after one month of Prayer listen to me November 1978 where the Fox Allah pika who knew refika those French people know him he is the one who did the translation in French he came from Switzerland and he Britt and he brought the message but I was now and left there 70 Oh God I was now sour I said ways the truth now some young people went to the meeting over the Francois Latika he was playing the 8 millimeter film of the Prophet in black and white then those young people came he said you know what we have only been baptized the true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and as a prophet who came to this world there's only one God because I was a Trinitarian I bet I do what listen to them let's go and look I said I don't want to go you because I refuse the message of the hour somebody came from India he's from South Africa Durban Durban natal he was travelling from India to go back to his country city felt led by God to stop over in Mauritius and the strange thing about 75 churches of the Assembly of God he came to where I was look how God when he came to me we have were setting one night he said I'm looking for young people who like to play guitar and go and preach on the streets that what I was doing I'm a guitar player for 25 years old to play violin I play guitar I go on the street and I play where they are taking marijuana they are putting hearing in the blood I will be praying for them while while they are taking hearing in the blood pudding the blood pudding in the hearing I was there praying for them if the police will come there I will be locked in prison but how bold I was to deceive him now when he said when you met with us though young who went to see the film of the Prophet they just nudge me like I said ask him about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I seem about the Prophet asked him about one God I said let me alone then because they were insisting I asked the man his name is AD judgment he's a colored brother from South Africa I said can you tell me about the baptism in the name Lord Jesus Christ about one God he jumped from his J he said I came here for that but but but I was afraid chabela I was afraid to introduce this machine when your what happened because I turned my back on the message that many true Jews me to the UPC the Pentecost the oneness Pentecostal church and our I pastored that this this church for nine years I was a superintendent of the Pentecostal church for nine years I had four churches and I went in the boat and I did the missions work in in the island of Rodrigues where I put a church there and I went to Madagascar and the eighth in 1982 my son was two days old first September if Friday I left my son two days all I went to Madagascar you know why to preach against the message for nine years I thought the message because the message was a threat to me because in the UPC where I was we were preaching holiness we were preaching sisters will have long dresses not TV in the homes we were preaching about you know one God but I didn't know about the way about baptism in the name of Jesus Christ we were preaching all that they were I talk about elliptical I said you have come here for nothing what about the superlative you know what I did I - a man in Canada his name is aw post he wrote a book on serpents in fact or fiction I got that my quantities I would give it to the people just to fight the message and I pulled people out of the message I pulled my own wife out of the message I pull pastors out of the message that's what I did for nine years fighting the message and let me tell you nobody can fight this message this message is not from man is from God it's a God sent message they were one when I thought the message I got schizophrenia one of the worst cases of depression I went through three times out of six times electroshock therapy and my brother who works in psychiatry in London he told me that they had been banished from from from from UK because one of it might make you crazy forever and you make six times six times therapy and I reach a point I could hear my wife talk to me I will hear my two children speak to me I put pillows it's against my ears not to hear them play not premium shot with I was in a valley with a melancholic I was sometimes happy amongst people dance just just two minutes later I don't want to even to talk to you then I felt now it's enough I want to match to my doctor my psychically I said I'm going to commit suicide I feel like don't want to live anymore nice earth he said after you give me those tablets I'm going to one killing myself no no he's trying now to to increase the dosage I said but I can't leave anymore I felt like I'm in a world of myself this made all this because I fought the message of the hour and that's what today all those people who don't know web science to see whatever people are saying against the Prophet don't go on those websites they're saying but agronomy the paper crit he's a liar let me they've come too late for me because the message is holy they'll come too late for me because that message this message I'll go to power transformation transform my life I was healed of asthma and I was healed of that depression completely I don't take any people antidepressant tablets I was I was having like electric thing coming from my foot I was in a dark place I would open the door Mike on my car throw myself on the street on the Main Street with God going like that I was shouting here we will get my car parked my car and rush me to the clinic I've been in gastroscopy they'll put some troops in my stomach to find out what was happening some kind of a sour thing they were sure to me on the computer screen all this I've gone through but one day [Applause] that's why I believe I believe that pulls it in times past but now there's a contrast there was times past but now something happened I believe in a God who can change your life less there is a message book I don't know how it is in English a message book from this time Chris 31st December 59 I underlined that those words in French you know Hong Kong traffic Joe a meeting with God there are 64 times in one message book my mom talks about a meeting with God will change your life 64 times in one sermon they were saying how important it is it's not coming here to meet with one another that's fine and dandy but we are here for one purpose to be with him and that would be the change in fact I met with him and it changed my life my life was changing it when I came to the message I began to testify and you know maybe the best thing how to testify it's not with a book it's with your life I began my church I began my church with 12 people I won't tell you where I came from I went to a message church and the pastor had the pillar of fire over his head over his shoulder you know all the nonsense I told them give me that pillar of fire let me go to New York and find out whether it's either a real pillar of fire and let me go to that place where that men tested that pillar of fire no so many people now just confuse us with a pillar of fire on their shoulder with their name seven letter word I don't believe that we have got only one prophet his name is William Marion bra and that's hope and and the for I was healed by the power of God my life was changed issue allow me I'm going to show you a song then I really won quote before I go let me show you a song but be patient with me if you give me the key G that's a song that came to my heart when I was healed in 1979 that song blessed me all over and

same again [Applause] and I'll never be the same again oh dude I'm ever be the same again oh no no no no she's my love you said I am not the same I'll never be the same [Music] [Applause] listen I'll really quote to you and I'm going to end the meeting I want you to listen carefully to the coat problems here that when you went to the sensor mounted we said the angel when they came and they opened the Bible see the Bible became a new Bible paragraph 43 of feast of the trumpets he said the Bible became a new Bible from that time because I was doing so much wrong to the people of other message God showed me in the scripture people would tell me away the name of a Branham in the scripture but this is not my turn to do that now I can bring you to many scriptures and fill the name of William Branham in the scripture I began God began to open my mind and I've seen many stories in the Acts of the Apostles acts 12 acts 27 acts 8 there is a story of brother Branham writing in those chapters in many places God like brought me to my mind with I was a fighter against that message how God has to kind of ground my face with truths from the Bible that this message has its imprint in the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation they will listen to one of them I'm closing with that the battle became a new book my wife used to teach Sunday School they were he will get this story about Christ multiplying two fishes and five laws he will do some flannelgraph with the children and six months after if she does the same teaching he will come up with the same stone Jesus Christ to fire laws and fire bread and two fishes you know and then one two years later if she had to relive the same story she will come up with the same thing again Jesus Christ to farm laws and two fishes but who is the message of the hour the vine will have become a new Bible when I was reading the same story now in the light of the message of the hour I saw something that hit my mind Christ told him go and get some food we said oh how can we procure bread in a desert say no no they have been with me for three days they won't be able to get back home it strength they will lack strength on their way home they won't be able to get back home they have been with me for three days and then I saw from there that the message of Lucia of Wesley of Pentecost those three days won't be able to bring yourself back home we need another type of bread we need bread from the Masters him he had to break the bread the seals had to be opened the bringing of the season that no ensure our way back home with the message of Luther Wesley and Pentecost we could all get back home we would have been fallen along the way with God through the hands of the master the hands of Christ the book was in his right hand and you appendices we the book open with a bread being broken from the hands of the master now we can be sure that we can reach home with the open book now the Bible has become a new book if it went Christ we read about the story of Christ walking on the sea when I read the message I begin to look for every time where bronto about he walks on the sea he said but he told them to go and he went is it you went on the mountains and began to pray can you know some English and he began to pray on the mountain one said he one day look what his head in the ramparts of glory said he was interceding for the church that was going through the sea it was the church going through seven Church ages it reached a point where it were ten thousand devils swore to drown them it was the age of Laodicea it was total darkness on the sea then he left glory he knew not he had to live glory he he left there and he came with supernatural sign he walked on the sea when he walked on to see in the dark Laodicea where ten thousand ever saw to drown them he came in the fourth wake of the night because it's in the fourth seal that the Eagle anointing came the folks he represent the church out loud this year they knew that the Foxes the shuttle yuneisia that's where God sent the Eagle anointing to fight that pale horse the cost never had a name before but in the fourth seal in the seventh church age where God will get to send the Eagle anointing to the prophet of the hour then he was called death like those ten thousand Iblis who swore to kill the man Christ had to come from the ramparts of glory walked on the sea and when they saw now the lightning striking he was the same Jesus but in another fall the sand Jesus but and more faith they were a friendship he's of course he said no I'm ready cuz I am he like today we I was afraid o the message of the hour yet God sent brother branham get sent this message to sell my life from the time of Laodicea he was coming Gino is not a ghost it is I the same yesterday today and forever that's them that's how I saw that the Bible became a new book in the light of the message of the hour even when Christ was 12 years old my mum said he one day and the father and the mother left him for three days the one problem said those three days represent the days of Luther Wesley and the Pentecost they had to go back to Christ he said he was it was God in his humanity he had took they have to go bad God in his humanity and that's what happened in God has appeared on the scene again I don't want to hurt you but I believe that William Branham is not God I don't believe in the deity doctrine I don't believe in that but I believe that he was prepared from the youth from the age of seven don't smoke don't drink don't define your body I've got a great work to do I believe that he came at the time in his ministry where Ellen wasn't ashamed to come and inhabit that veil the trying to turn his back to the paper it was held him in flesh it was God in human form again it will God behind the screams again the winner that's the power of this message and I promise I read a quote a hen over to my posture but listen to the court I'm reading the court to bless someone if someone can be blessed by the call it's fine and dandy with me because that message is full of promises if you're sick there's no need for you to go back home sick there's enough power enough healing power healing anointing in that word of the hour he said there's a scripture of the Bible she won't read at home Tom said we have had the speed of power sound mind I learned when I was Pentecost when I read this stirred a spirit of fear but of power I will say hallelujah but the scripture continues he said be down therefore because of the speed of power a wisdom of sound mind now I give the reason why God gave you that be down under for ashamed to give testimony to the Lord but the verse continues neither of me therefore we have had the spirit of power of some mind to testify of Jesus Christ Paul was not trying to downgrade Jesus he said to testify about him but also of me his prisoner he knew that the gospel is reaching the word he was preaching didn't come from him delicious 1:11 he caught it by revelation whatever I was preaching not from a man not from a school of theology it came from God but it do not be ashamed to testify a Christ but neither of me Paul and I feel tonight I lost Paul were the first messenger prophet of the Omega Brian of the Alpha brain I believe that the Prophet he was the one chosen for the Omega bride and as Paul will tell them don't be ashamed to justify of me I will tell you don't be ashamed to justify or William running and I'll show you why I'll show you why I read the quote a lady in my church it's enough I'm closing she would never listen to me just now and said to me he said a lady in my church brother Bill or mrs. Webber she was dying with TV she was in the sanatorium well I'm closing with that at the last stages they sent her home to die say this nothing could be done for her mrs. grace Webber in Jeffersonville she lived just beyond the tabernacle and she had a God five or six little children so so the angel of the Lord come to me that night and said go tell mrs. Weber and tell mr. Weber rather to get things ready for his going to be left with those children on his hands for his wife is going well I went and told me so ever I told his little girl little Jean rose which is a nurse now she was a little bitty fellow then she's a young lady now it's been seven years ago or more I said now Jeanie listen to me no Jeanie your mother is going to die she can't live but a little while longer and two days after that two days after that Oh three days there were some ladies from the government Depot there where she wept coming and mrs. Weber grace said now she said if I could have brother bill to pray for me once more I like that once more once more Lord if I can get brother bill to come and pray for me once more nobody said I've seen my cousin opal was healed with a cancer and that doctor just gave her till morning to live and daughter's is a nurse also the girls from out the government Depot where she worked with her same look now what those girls said there ain't nothing the guy look how she talked about the Prophet they talk about there's nothing to the guy he's he isn't nothing buddy he pockets that's all religion is is a bunch of fake fanaticism and so mrs. Weber say now look now how she took for the Prophet say listen look am dying now and I know that but I just won't stand still for that for what you say I'm going to testify like Putin not be ashamed to testify on me no she said I don't know what you're saying but I'm going to I'm not going to stand still for what you declare it's in and I know that she said I know better than that we know better than that what you're putting on the websites were just standing around we know better than that hello yeah we've had some experience submarine experience and we know better than that I know I know that I know that I know I know better than that you know I I have lived there around this city I have lived around that men all the time I've seen him from a child and we have seen him from a child in the message life story we've seen him from the child we know his life hallelujah never we won't stand still for that whatever they tried to put into my ears I don't want to listen I know better than that and I won't stand still for the things not now listen listen she said you you can call it fake if you want but I've seen so much we have been reading so much we have listened to strum it the healing lines we have been listening we have seen so much supernatural in the message of the hour we have seen so much now she's testifying the same and I've seen God healed of people and I know the men's life I know the men's life and I know it's the truth now listen to that because she took up for the Prophet because you not ashamed to give testimony of the Prophet Luka rebellion and it happened to be that the angel of the Lord I know the angel of the Lord heard a testimony she heard that hallelujah she said and that very night sitting on the side of my chair in the room after I got up and went to God a drink of water listen about 3:00 in the morning and sitting on a chair I've seen him where I am so Christ now I seen him come walking through the door he said tomorrow Sunday they are going to pick mrs. Weber up and bring her down she'll be sitting on the right hand side far back in the tabernacle say tell her kraspo palaburn tell her I heard her I heard what she said I heard what she said and tell her first saith the Lord she will live and not die hallelujah God reversed God I don't care what you're going through I don't care about your disease I don't care what the doctor said about your cancer case but God can reverse the curse God can reverse the disease and God reversing God tell her she will live the God is said to be the God who will not change his mind about his word change his mind shame because of a woman justifying she took a popular Branham he said I know this man I know his life you can't call him sake you can't call it fanaticism you can't call him hip-pocket but I know that I know and she called healing and I've closed you that with the same coalition what Bible says he said I think God she will leave it no die there you are you can go down and see if you want now listen he's he's presence one day when she was taking up so what was right his presence I want to tell you brother that's why I came to the convention I think your passing I wanted to testify to that the message of the hour I've seen my legs delivered me from s to Sweden explain that's why I'm not ashamed why I go out I've been fishing in many many countries and I gave my testimony and I gave how the process message change my life I'm not shield I told my young people even the pressures carry carry a message book in your web don't be ashamed justify our message and you will see how God is going to deal with you because he said he said she called his presence was there and if any founder so he came and told me what she had said and he and he God had respect to her because she had respect unto what was representing God ah the Branham was representing God and she show respect to what was representing God and God was happy God was pleased with that and he came down tell you in fact oh she does I have changed it because attitude the right mental attitude in his presence will bring the results and he said now he said he will do the same for you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shall we give shall we give a great clap offering on to the Lord [Applause] [Music] and I want to believe brother Nanda sings from 16 years and to the time that he met the law he

lemon so quickly time is running against us and as soon as you leave here I would like you to just make your way straight to catch some food and because we lost one hour we went to give back the hour again so the door we opened by instead of six o'clock it will be by 6:30 and service Vista by seven o'clock praise to remain I mean there's an effort that's been made by our brother here and this is the only belief very beautiful hymn book that we out there praise God Amin and and here is also a kind of like an almanac with all the whole picture not an expression but of all the whatever and I was giving this brotherly testimony of how God he did this many years ago as a we're of evangelism and there is something I spoke to him he didn't know about it I didn't ask him to bring this but I believe that this can really be something and I can really tune you on to the Lord and I remember my mother if you can give me two minutes my mother was so sick so sick to death and I was praying to God I will drive along the way I will talk and I will start to cry to God don't you hear the cry of my mother and torchon healer and God gave me a sign and then and I asked God again I said if really you are real as my mother would go I would like you to use - that is let us her go and be an encouragement to me and one day we came back from Sunday's from from from church on a Sunday and my mother was so sick and God healed her she got well again praise God a man but that was not enough after about you know some months after her healing and God showed me a dream and I saw her just moving and she was looking more like a teen you know twenty years or lady and I prayed a prayer I said lord if you want to take my mother home let her be an encouragement to me it sure has something that she will speak to me that will encourage me in this message and then there is one of these that I left it was only the stutter of the perfect man and that was in her room so when we came back that Sunday she called me and my wife and then she she said she pointing at the start of a perfect man I said son I want to thank you so much for bringing this message to this home you say look at it I was looking at it on my wife and we were just like what was she going to tell us you say does the perfect message don't leave it praise God Amin so by revelation I was kind of like in my home I have all these thoughts of a perfect man I wanted to be in every corner even added door I had to I wouldn't buy the Chinese door I went and called one local you know I am on grass it just to me these on the door and he medic Cottonelle he doesn't matter but he made a good job I want when I step out I want to see the Statue of a perfect man when I come back I want to be reminded to be a perfect man and that is what I'm trying to tell so this is not supposed to be purchased and then it becomes a thing that you just try run like any pepper this is a message so have it as a gift you can give to your friends by the time you get back home you to do a lot of a question to their minds and at that time you use it as an evangelism and you can coop endeavor praise government hallelujah so does an effort young people do something for the Lord don't zero down on you know get money for your phones and all kinds of things you're wasting your time praise God remain may God give you an experience praise God I mean so the Almanac we just be for a token fee of two hundred fifteen era and a home book the hymn book is one thousand era you can pack as many as possible you know and donate to your churches
