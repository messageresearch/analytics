jesus christ amen praise the lord we certainly know it a privilege and to know brother ovid and uh with him brother isaac i cannot separate them i have to mention them together praise the lord we love

encourage you with our words and with our testimony we want to encourage you to keep on the good fight of faith he is able hallelujah we are not able but he is able to bring it to pass the victory in the love of divine amen so i want to greet you and uh i want to appreciate every effort and every ministry that labors for the cause of christ i appreciate every one of them everyone that labors for that city could to come down so a short encouragement amen along the way and i taken from ephesians praise the lord and um if i would entitle it um this short greeting i would give it a title predestinated to live in the ephesian purpose of love divine let's just have a word of prayer dear heavenly father lord as we approach thy throne of mercy lord jesus to bring a short encouragement to the people lord may you bless your word father may your anointed to the hearts of the believer that are listening in lord jesus it doesn't matter where they are father but your word is anointed father may instruct them lord may lives be changed father and encourage lord to move on father for that great victory in the love divine in jesus name we pray and ask your blessing in jesus name amen and amen ephesians 1 verse 4 and i've taken my little inspiration for that amen and paul is writing here according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen it was a command of paul that we should be holy and without blame so if it's a command there's a possibility that we are holy and without claim hallelujah and we cannot be holy from our self there's no possibility for that but he is holy and he comes to live in us hallelujah so we can be holy because he is holy how can i walk blameless lord jesus your blood of calvary glances me from all sin daily daily lord you cleanse me from all mistakes and i walk holy holy holy unto the lord so paul says we should be holy without blame before him in love in love means you have you must fall in love with him there's a relationship hallelujah that you have to fall in love with him and i want to pick it up from brother branham when he went behind the curtain of time i want to listen what he says he says there when he was there he said it's all love everything is real brother everything is real sister there's no death there's no sorrow there's no jealousy no nothing nothing can enter there it's just perfection and how can we enter into this perfect place brother brand name in the message curtain behind the curtain of of time he says i'm more than convinced ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place so it's not we have it when we are going there but he said in a state we will be in a state of perfect love and as i said a relationship with our lord jesus individual a relationship we have fallen in love and it's a perfect love and when we have that perfect relationship we have a perfect love and then we will be there on the other side and that's what it needs otherwise it takes but we are predestinated so we gonna have it amen hallelujah there will be a perfect love in the church there will be a perfect love in the marriages there will be a perfect love in the families before we go over there there will be a perfect love it has to be and it will be there between brothers and sisters a perfect love because brother brahm says it has to be and it will be hallelujah even the person that you hate or that hates you the perfect love will drop down and will open your eyes and see that person with a different eyes that's what he makes who is he who is he brother bran says whatever you do he said lay aside everything else means to die to yourself die to your opinion to you what you what what we think we have perfect conceptions but we lay them aside and say lord jesus i just love you and you love me he comes down and he's pleased he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get that perfect love hallelujah that's a way hallelujah so where's the connection where's the connection in that message behind the curtain of time brother branham says then the voice spoke to me and said this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is that what we are preaching all over this years this is that that perfect love we have called it a holiest ghost but it's perfect love in a manifestation in a way where it's living this is that what you call that is the holy ghost so on the other side when we all meet together on the other side we will call it perfect love on this side we call it the holy ghost in question and answers brother braham says he says the same holy ghost that perfect love i say the same holy ghost that came down on those apostles and back in the ages is still in the church today hallelujah it's still there it's still there it's still working it's still achieving its aim hallelujah it's still working hallelujah praise the lord it's still in trinidad it's still in us it's still in africa it's still in europe that same holy ghost that perfect love that same holy ghost radiating in seven different attributes of his holy of his glory brother branham said it's the same holy ghost radiating out in those seven attributes it's the same holy ghost the same perfect love what does it make it comforts you jesus called him the comforter it will guide you in every situation it will lead you personal because you have fallen into this love with jesus in the message perfect face brother brahm says and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in the mug of the mud as i was and i said it many years ago i was in a state like that brother abraham continues and then god comes to us how does he come individually he starts speaking to you you die to yourself and you start to receive him with the baptism of the holy ghost you receive him and his love god sought you you never sought god and god came down in the muck what was the woman at the well she was in a mucky place in a mucky condition in a mucky situation but jesus came down to her and the love affair started there and she recognized her savior her redeemer easy that and he was he was that for her amen and brother branham continues he said god came down in that mug and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love in us when he comes down it brings perfect love to us it creates literally a perfect love to him hallelujah what look what was and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you somebody who else who is listening somebody loves you final quote in the message super sign brother branham said there's got to come a church again where those barriers will be broken and the holy ghost i say the perfect love the holy ghost have the right of way among the people hallelujah it will have the right of way everything else has to go because the holy ghost will have the right of way the perfect love there's a relationship that cannot be broken hallelujah because god said it so and it will be there hallelujah because nothing with this relationship can separate you from the love of god amen when you do you will see the same signs and the same wonders that happen back there in them days and we see them and we see more of them the same signs and wonders amen the holy ghost will have the right way in our lives no more creeds no more depressions no more sickness no more arguing but the love of god is poured out in every heart in heaven they call the perfect love on earth they call it a holy ghost may god bless you with a pentecostal experience back to the place where the church has left him at pentecost brother branham says we are back for the fire baptism the time is there make ready let everything go and see the love of god as you lay at his feet at his word may god bless you be with you in this time and season jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever as we sing the song we walk in that light it's a light that's radiating from the heart of god a perfect love radiating and god has given us the ability and has predestinated us to walk in that love to walk in that holy spirit be changed from glory to glory we are pray destinated to live in that efficient purpose of love divine god bless you amen amen hallelujah glory be to god thank you jesus oh you appreciate that amen greeting today hallelujah hallelujah

greetings and god bless you and what a convention have you enjoyed the convention thus far we are now down to the final service and we want to appreciate and thank all the ministers that has gone before we appreciate your service to the bride of jesus christ and at this time i'd like to read from three portions of scripture daniel chapter 2 ephesians 4 and revelation chapter 10. uh daniel chapter 2 we want to read from 17 to 23 ephesians chapter 4 from 11 to 13 and revelation 10 we want to read from one to four and eight to eleven or praise the lord now the daniel scripture we know that uh king nebuchadnezzar had a dream that troubled him he forgot it he asked the magicians to tell him the dream because he he said the dream was gone from him he was going to kill them he wanted to know the interpretation and daniel got word of it and daniel asked for time i know went and sought the lord to get the interpretation thereof we want to read that from verse 17 then daniel went to his house and made the things known to hanaya mishael and azaria his companions that they should desire mercies of god of heaven concerning the seek this secret that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changed the times and the seasons he removed kings and set it up kings he gave it wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealed the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him i thank thee and praise the odd god of my fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou has now made known unto us the king's matter ephesians 4 verse 11 and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the define of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of defeat and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ and from revelation 10 i want to read verse 1 to 4 and then 8 11. reading from verse one i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clue with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was with his son his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cried with a lord voice and when a lion roared when he had cried seven thunders uttered the voices when the seven thunders had uttered the voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven seen unto me seal up those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not and verse eight and the voice which i heard from heaven speaker to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel they were standing upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth sweet as and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me dom was prophesy again before many peoples nation tongues and kings let's bow ahead one more time father god i thank you for the scriptures this morning and i pray you become an interpreter of heart you know the time and the season and the challenges that lays before us but we pray that your revealing spirit and reveal and anointing will come down this morning and unfold your word by revelation and inspiration granted father in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you and uh wherever you are church and be seated but we're grateful to god to be here tonight i have a title today the dispensation of another ephesians and this is our inspiration i have a subject the rebuilding of the church by the ministry of the spirit by and through a five-fold ministry have an inspiration charity the archangel's voice the voice of perfection so the title again is the dispensation of another ephesians the subject the rebuilding of the church by the ministry of the spirit by and through a faithful ministry and an inspiration of charity the archangel's voice oh blessed be the name of the lord so we'll see what the lord will do today william branham's seven seal prophecy was the unsealing of the prophetic vision and that was why john wept because the book was closed and the book was sealed and no man was willing to take the book so he was looking for the book to be unsealed john was is that right so this prophetic vision was to be accomplished by gorson and the prophet to reveal every mystery this is to be accomplished by the seven spirits of god the bible called going through all the earth this vision was to be accomplished by the restoration of the entire holy ghost ministry to the bride of jesus christ because that's the ministry that we lost this holy ghost ministry which will be the dynamics to the mechanics therefore this vision of god had to be restored to the bride isn't that right oh glory to god so this prophetic vision is what open up the word and give us the authority to prophesy according to revelation 10 8 11. now the bible talk about go to the angel take the book eat the book and prophesy so part of this message for the fast 50-plus years was under the spirit of prophecy to give us the testimony of jesus according to revelation 10 8-11 so this seven seal message that was released by the prophet wasn't just the content of doctrinal stuff but it was a vision within the structure of what was presented by god from 1946 to 1965 whatever length of time the prophet was here on the earth because god told daniel go thy way the book is sealed till the time of the end so the prophecy was hanging over the book was the unsealing and that unsealing has to be the unsealing of this great prophetic vision because the vision is always for appointed time so we're not here by church as a particular doctrine and teaching but we are here by prophecy and by vision where it's going to be unsealed or unfolded now revelation 10 when john heard the seven thunders god told him don't write it seal it up so you get the next seal again to seal up what them thunders uttered but in the days of the voice hallelujah not when the man is here but the days of the voice not when the flesh of malachi voice here but the days of the voice isn't that right praise god that vision gonna be on books and tapes hallelujah the days of the voice isn't that right so in the days of the voice the revelation will be unfolded and you describe it as who god is how he lives all about him his being his person isn't that right now i want to compare this prophetic vision as a full complete architectural drawing of a building or pyramid it is not yet built but is the complete drawings of what it is to be built it is the revelation of what is to be it is to let the main thing be the main thing it is together's focus because that is what a vision does a vision gets you focused so it's not so a prophetic vision then is like a drawing and that drawing keeps you honed as the division of where you are where you come from where you're going what you want to accomplish and what is your purpose that is a vision and that is what a vision is all about oh praise the name of the lord now without a vision it will just be scattered information knowledge trying to fit things together but the vision is constant the vision is fixed the vision is a picture of the complete program just like god had it in the back part of his mind it was a vision and he let time that kink called time and eternity unfolding his vision to be a redeemer to be the liver but the vision is already complete and that is why he had you he said all that the father had for known he had already glorified oh pooh phony recall who we call it justified who is justified he has already glorified because the vision in god's thinking is complete that's the thoughts of god that's the thinking of god hallelujah now without a vision you have confession i believe this i believe that i believe that but the vision really for the bride of jesus christ is a vision of perfection oh that's the vision a vision of perfection and that is where we get ephesians 4 that god promised a genuine faithful ministry for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body so that is all part of this prophetic vision oh praise god till we come to the unity of the fate knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto our measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so again let's repeat that the prophetic vision is like a full complete approved architectural drawing with all the details just waiting to be given to fightful ministry builders hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah waiting to be given isn't that right so he promised that the seven thunders under the seventh seal would reveal all these mysteries abba kaku one says write the vision then make it plain that he that read it may run so once the vision comes it has to be written and if it is written it has to be spoken for it to be made plain so that you the bride could understand the vision let's go again write division number one make it plain number two that he just read it may run so the prophet came to write the vision because he got the vision hallelujah he received the vision and the vision was written and spoken isn't that right and that vision that is written must be spoken that it could be made plain that you could understand the vision oh glory to god and according to what the prophet prophesied he said we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because there will come an ephesian age to it so we didn't prophesy ephesians 8 the prophet did and ephesians age or dispensation of ephesians or the time of the ephesians is a hidden mystery it's a mystery because the bible only brings us up to laodicea so that means god had to call us out of laodicea into this mysterious slot holy spirit slot where ephesians lay oh my john oh praise god the vision is for an appointed time hallelujah vision is always from appointed time and god came down to abraham he said i will return unto thee according to the time of life a vision a purpose a picture of her future of where you are going and that keeps you going that's what the vision does jesus had a vision since john 4 34 jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work so jesus wasn't operating at a haphazard level he was up operating from by vision to finish the work that the father gave him luke 2 49 he said to them how is it that you sought me wish he not that i must be about my father's business so jesus had it clean and clear that he was about his father's business he had a vision he had a purpose and that's why he did what he did and the way you do will vindicate whether or not you have a vision the way you do whether you have a plan whether you have a purpose because god don't book haphazard he always have a plan he has a purpose isn't that right he has a purpose for daniel long in babylon i went king got the dream he couldn't remember the dream it was a terrible dream he said tell the dream and tell the interpretation his wise man said we cannot do that but god revealed it to daniel isn't that right because he's revealed secrets to servants the prophets so everybody in the message has a word an interpretation an idea an opinion an ophelian and feeling and so on but when that vision comes it's different when a vision it has knocked out every interpretation it has not got every idea isn't that right praise god so we have doctrines and teachings and angles and i've seen it so and i've seen it so but where is that vision and that is what the seven thunders brought a vision of perfection adoption and the coming of the lord isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord the lord himself descend from heaven with a shout and the prophet identified as shout out seven thunders just as god named the light day he called the shout the seven thunders the seven thunders is the shout that is the message and from the shout there's the next phase of it the voice of the archangel oh glory to god he said i wish i had the voice of the archangel to bring it to a place where you could see it so somewhere along the line this archangel's voice must come forward to bring clarity of the vision that the prophet brought could we see amen tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord so therefore jacob grace joy perfection becomes the prophetic vision for the bride the pentecostal got stuck at jacob grace but the bribe will go on to draw the perfection to receive joseph rainbow quote that quote of many colors oh blessed be the name of the lord so god's burden i believe was to get people to the voice angel in revelation 10 8 11 go to the angel if they say go to this man if they go to this bishop or say go to this this this this minister it said go to the angel and we find out i don't think i'll get time to read it the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel trying to get the people back to the word of god so after all these years 50 plus years it was prophecy upon prophecy upon prophecy people didn't understand that they're looking for manifestation but was the time of the vision revelation hallelujah of these things being made known so we are under the anointing of prophecy to prophesy every prophecy that the prophet already brought so we were prophesying our own revival we was prophesying our own adoption our own perfection prophecy were overcoming all of that was prophecy isn't that right prophesy prophecy not a new prophecy but the same prophecy the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing i wanted to see would already be said in the word oh my in other words when god told the woman that the woman sees our brutal sip and head he did not say how it is going to be unfolded and this is the problem this is the challenge people have an interpretation of how god will manifest and confirm and vindicate his promises but you have to leave it up to god to reveal how it will be unfolded how many of you will be here for all these years how many of you will be under virtual convention with coronavirus hanging all along how many knew that we'd be coming on to this spot where he said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike and what is written for the manifestation of the sons of god when they would stop cancer when they were stop diseases when they would stop this and stop that they will be doing it because we sons of god manifested in other words so when god says that the woman's he will bruise his sip on head he didn't say how it was going to be unfolded to isaac to jacob to mary all done true amen to produce jesus christ so when god speaks something hallelujah listen he speaks it in his completeness he speaks it in its fullness he speaks it but we don't know the channel of how it will be fully unfolded it comes like you know in part and you're prophesying that because you cannot know exactly how it will unfold so he leave that as a mystery as how it gonna be unfolded even your own life as a sinner how you could explain to people where you come from and god snatch you from hell snatch you out to different things and you are still alive you're still striving and still fighting your life itself is a mystery you don't even understand a lot of parts about your life because it's god in you is god sees in you that is unfolding itself and that is why you struggle true that is why you're making it true it's not right so therefore so god leave it as a mystery of how it will be unfolded so there's going to be a fifo ministry operating by the ministry of the spirit after 50 plus years of the ministry of the word what do you mean brother of it well listen what the prophet said here and hear him our heavenly father we tangly today that we have the privilege of standing in thy presence with the ministry of the word of god before us and we realize that this great solemn obligation that has been given unto the sons of men to park the gospel to all the creatures of the earth before the reaching of jesus christ and then an angel of god he said shall we bow our heads just a moment our heavenly father we are so thankful tonight for the opportunity to be alive and to be here on earth listen at the closing of this world history to see these great things developing the words of god being materialized and brought to us by the ministry of thy spirit so here you talk about the ministry of the word and the ministry of the spirit and how we love thee for this is such a privilege to get to minister to the people in this last day knowing that soon the sun was set for this last time and jesus shall come and we will see him and come to his feet and lay our trophies there for for that great time i could just call humbly up and lay my hands on his blessed feet then turn on tears of joy i will walk away knowing this all is well so therefore praise god the ministry of the spirit comes to manifest jesus christ which is another ephesians the promised land praise be to jesus so god has to come down in dynamics to make manifest or vindicate a faithful ministry because ephesians is the seventh seal of redemption made manifest or we could see it this way the seventh seal of redemption is that ephesians made manifest oh praise god so in other words when the book is revealed or unfolded or manifested it produces another ephesians i want to say that again this word saying again when this book people talk about the unfolding word and their following this mystery and unfolding this and their great unfolders right but watch in when the book is revealed or unfolded or manifested it produces another ephesians why because god sent malachi for to do what to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers what's that another ephesians because the ephesians was the gold standard ephesians what the church that god's looking for i am alpha an omega that was a sea church in the beginning you have another features at the ending all the delicacies laudisia wretched mind miserable blind miserable and poor naked but god promised to pull right out of that on ephesians bride and i believe that bride is around the world oh praise the name of the lord and they will be pulled out amen by the ministry of the spirit even perfection oh blessed be the name of the lord so let's hear what bahrain talked about unfolding on the seventh seal he said now you know when the seventh seeded was silent isn't that right he said no there's a great secret lane under the seal and i couldn't make it out i couldn't tell but i know it was them seven thunders uttering themselves right close together banging seven different times and they're the part i want to get to and it unfolded into something else that i seen so the prophet the prophet went not just under the seventh seal and saw the first fold seven thunders but he said the tenders unfolded into something else that i seen oh bless said be the name of the lord you mean the thunder's unfolding or something else yes and he saw it i say he saw you bright tonight he saw the prophet saw you he saw you not as a corinthian church not as a galatian church not as a baby hebrew church oh glory not as a filthy corinthian church but he saw you as an ephesian church that is what he saw i believe that it unfolded something else another ephesians oh blessed be the name of the lord he said i look for the interpretation i couldn't make it out and went into other tongues and i am not praise god hallelujah it went into unknown tongues isn't that right but he saw it he saw it now i am not talking about an inspiration of ephesians i am talking about ephesians itself where you have to cross jordan because ephesians parallel the book of joshua and which is your inheritance the promised land so when the prophet talked about ephesians parallel the book of joshua then you begin to understand where jordan fits in where debt fits in not just debt dying but debt to good self that is what like job had righteous man but he had stuff that god had to deal with and the only way god could deal with that stuff is to turn up the heat and that is where job got purged cleansed and he was a more righteous man praise god at the end of his whole experience oh praise god and you notice people stay away from that they don't want to talk about debt a dying to self but our pride and ambition and so on like that but this is part of the process in order to be in god's program for ephesians isn't that right oh bless the beginning of the lord so let's continue oh praise god in joshua every place you put your foot is yours that's ephesians isn't that right he said because that is the book of ephesians of the old testament and then brother branham says here he said no then paradox now you see what coming on to the jordan meant we are done here now let's cross over let's quit playing let's cross the other side now cause it all belonged to us it's all ours them vision has never failed they can't fail because they come from god i believe it all is within me we are not the highland that will run back into the wilderness we we will cross jordan this separation and then he broke in here god break to us the seals that on the back of the book so you talk more seven thunders god break them thunderstorms god break to us the seals that on the back of the book let us enter into that great place for joshua divided the to the people the inheritance that god had left for them so if ministers don't want to touch the tenders don't want to preach about the thunders they want to talk to them about the thunders how could they cross over to jordan impossible so any minister fighting the thunders fighting the revelation seven thunders there's no way they could get the ephesians because the only way to get to ephesians is to cross jordan and across jordan you have to see the seals that open in the back of the book oh blessed be the name of the lord so we have promised this is another quote from paradox we are promised this is barbara branham emphasizing it according to revelation 10. according to malachi 4 according to luke 17 30 and so forth there's got to come a ephesians to this there is promise it there must come an ephesians that these seven full mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded and it's a loud reason age that takes this takes place so therefore all these things hidden in the message the thunders and so on must be wrapped up to produce an ephesians dispensation or a period of time where we see ephesians made manifest oh my hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you love him oh blessed be the name of the lord praise be to jesus hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord in ephesians is heavenly places in ephesians you are chosen in him predestination adoption in ephesians you are obtaining inheritance in ephesians you are sealed with the holy spirit in ephesians you're no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints in ephesians you find one lord one's faith one spirit one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism in ephesians you find the apostles the prophets the evangelists the pastors the teachers in ephesians they find the perfecting of the saints the unity of the fate and ephesians you redeem the time in ephesians why you submitted themselves to their husbands husbands love their wives and he feeds on sharing will be their parents in ephesians we are strong in the lord in ephesians we wrestled against flesh and blood in ephesians we put on the old armor of god oh glory to god in heaven done all to stand we stand that is ephesians that's what it's all about oh glory to god ephesians in the capstone book oh hallelujah what we pressing on to gordon sent us forward he sent us back us back to pick up ephesians that's why he sent our prophets to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and with the faith of the fathers we could go to the rapture oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus you love him oh blessed be the name of the lord in ephesians everybody have a measure everybody have grace according to the gift of christ isn't that right so you can take somebody measure i could only minister with my measure all the brothers have gone forth minister with their measure isn't that right nobody branham said there must come an ephesians that the sevenfold mystery will be unfolded so all those people that battle and fight in the inspiration fighting seven thunders they cannot cross over to ephesians they might have a good galatian church amen cover intention but not ephesians oh hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord do you believe that oh my so what were people looking for the bible talk on the last days men will have itching ears people have itchiness they want teachers to bring things that itch their ears not promises you know but information information and revelation is not the same thing and that is why the word emphasis is these divinely revealed mystery truths divinely revealed means it comes from heaven not from man it didn't come from study it come from heaven it's a revelation of god because daniel couldn't know the answer except god revealed to him and when he was revealed to him god daniel bless god because he is who changed the times he is who chains kings he who put up and put down who does that god does that and if god come and declare ephesians as a season as a dispensation then the holy spirit will come to make that manifest because man can't declare any season and god does that oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that thank you lord jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god hallelujah so he said the seven thunders were gathered right together seven thunders were shorter by how to prepare so if there's a five-fold ministry to step forward with the ministry of jesus christ it means that seven thunders have to prepare you to receive that and to see that because god can't break his word the faithful ministry is for the perfecting of the saints no man can perfect man so it's not man's ministry it has to be the ministry of jesus christ now god issue is not about power you know god have power to give god issues about character and character is not a gift listen it have gift of preaching gifts of speaking all these are gifts but that is not character even a man have a gift whether it's evangelical gift a postulate gift a pro a prophetic gift whatever it gives the gift have to be purged the mindset of they get captured let me say that again even if the man have a gift of pastor gifts of evangelist gift of teacher all these gifts that god put into men he said god don't make halfway preachers but preachers can be halfway god they make that they are halfway because they get their lines crossed up and they get their lives messed up so what we are called to do now are not just called to do but god released the trials and the testings and keep tearing up the heat to see what's in us what's in men or let's say they say what's in man god know what's in man dying by the heat is necessary oh blessed be the name of the lord how to prepare so i believe there's a dispensation of ephesians a season of ephesians a time of ephesians and daniel said he changed the times he said blessed be the name of god forever for wisdom and might are his he changed at the times and seasons he removed kings and settled up kings he gave it wisdom to the wise he changed season and i believe the season is being changed right now i miss this corner virus i miss this it can't travel here and car travel there i miss all of that a superchurch is about to become fought in other words the word is about to be born into manifestation let me see it good the word is about to be born into manifestation first is prophecy just like if a virgin shall conceive prophecy for hundreds of years but then when mary came the prophecy is about to become manifested now because the body of that prophecy is on the earth and this body is on the earth to in effect produce a fightful ministry not men trying to uh uh point people to themselves or the churches of this group but people that would point people to jesus christ amen so listen to this now the spirit quickens the word in other words the powder that sends the bullet out here like it was a powder when david met goliath with a slingshot see if he only had one place a hit that was right between the eyes the rest of it was armored but god got into that spirit what was it he had five stones and a slingshot look fait ate fate gesus here he comes something fixing to happen he said no cause there is the word the promise here we go and the power to sling it so a lot of people emphasize the word the promise but it have to have the power to sling it right he said what with the power of the holy ghost behind him to press it out there watch it come to pass that's god's army his word of fire his army all dressed with his ever presence of himself hallelujah going with us i will go with you i will be in you not you that speaker the father that dwelleth in you he does the works here we go listeners here we go are you ready he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanded officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost oh i thought the baptism of the holy ghost is not the real thing that's not true all with the baptism of the holy ghost i taught the seed in his soul that's correct but that seed and his soul has to get a baptism of the spirit it's not just a seed in your soul peter had a seed in his soul too but he had to go in the upper room so seed in his soul is very good that's a great revelation hallelujah but we're talking about this baptism i'm not talking about the 24 hours i'm still being lost i'm not talking about that i'm talking about you as a bright seed receiving the holy ghost upon the sea that's inside of you so here we go he's talking about that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanded officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting oh dear to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes on to meet the enemy with the word of god here we go each one backing one another up not each one chopping one another up that is not fivefold that is not the ministry talking about each one backing one another up why it's an army a hallelujah watch with him the chief captain here not out here in front not up here above not back behind but in them who chief captain who was the boss of the book of acts the chief captain he was with each one of them so philippe could go here peter was sent here paul go dear it was never achieved general overseer some some white horse rider in charge of the bride of the book of acts that is foolishness it has to be the chief captain not above them nothing from them not behind them but in them or could we give the lord some praises that's why he said the pillar of fire will dwell in the adopted sons in the last days hallelujah here we go let's say again each one back in one another with him the chief captain not out in front up here above back behind but in them that's the army vindicating but abram was vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his works oh no they don't want to hear about signs and wonders you double standard wonders don't work pentecostal but this army here will be vindicating his resurrection how by proof of his works he said jesus says in john 14 12 he is quoted he does believe it on me the works that i do shall do also what is it it is god in the church in these five predestinated offices backing up every word that he said that the holy spirit himself in there oh glory to god the spirit of truth he shall lead you and guide you into all truth oh glory to god he shall lead you and guide you into ephesians what will do that the spirit of truth oh my hallelujah the prophet says um he said john when he came on the scene to prove that he was that ephesians made manifest john announced it but jesus was that he was the word manifested so the word manifested is the ephesians made manifest oh that's so beautiful tonight oh glory to god how else could we have a super church a super race if the world is not manifested we can't talk that we can't talk against the press the press come down we could talk words we have a book we've got a prophet the press not hearing that devil even bother him with that he asked who your pastor is he asking what country belong to is when i see the blood when i see the life i'm gonna pass over you there will be a bride that will challenge debt itself oh glory it can't be a coward bride it can't be a frighten bride it can be a scared bride it'd have to be a bright empowered tough dude for the final battle in this hour or give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh my so ephesus here what the first fall from their first love isn't that right and paul was striving to get them back isn't that right you don't see content for the fate that was once delivered to the saints isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord so god cannot do it to our organization i'm skipping through he said he'll do it when you become empty when you become weak and let the holy ghost come in and flood over every part of you and saturate every bit of your being what we need oh god i feel it pouring around now what we need is the prophet of god to rise on the scene with a thunderbolt of god spirit and lightning that will shake this world to shame empty vessels is what we need oh my a minority that will receive god's blessing on his message he said come away lord jesus catch your church and it will be your will lord just before the church is raptured may they rise power that's the prophecy oh god fill these vessels raise them up lord shake this world once more we know it will be past time there'll be no more repentance there'll be too far for them but you'll show your power lord fill those vessels and shake this world like it's never been shot before take your church then leave the world and it's chaos oh god tell you you want to turn up you up listen oh god want to turn you upside down and shake you out and when you've gone right side up you are empty hallelujah praise god god want to shake you out your nonsense shake you out your foolishness we only have a short time oh my it's so disgraceful so for some man to point to that group and say this is the only group doing rapture it's so foolish it's so it's so petty and foolish that you have to go through this one man or this one line or connected as one person it's so nonsensical it doesn't make sense there's a big god we serve oh glory to god have all type of grapefruit all kind of oranges all kind of mangoes it has different color race mountains heights every plant there is every animal it has different types israel was 12 tribes oh glory to god god wants you to be an individual god wants you to be different oh glory to god i love him this morning oh he is god this morning you have a bride in africa you have a bride in europe you everybody in south america you're right in u.s of a yeah right in the caribbean you're right they're all in india all around the world there is a bride of jesus christ are you okay what condition they under right now they may be on a lockdown but they're still a bride oh they're under pressure still a bride whether you're poor still bright rich still bride once your name is on that book and that's why we could shout this morning and praise god this morning i miss everything dead we are prophesying there's going to be another ephesians you've got our fightful ministry genuine anointed sons and servants of god oh and the saints come into perfection the saints being edified their saints being built up oh what a wonderful time we're moving into a great time the world is preparing for our funeral service but we are preparing for wedding supper it's two different preparation all together we are preparing to leave here oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus oh hallelujah give them some praises oh thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of truth hallelujah the spirit of truth was released to guide us into all truth oh thank you jesus so watch oh my to bring on another ephesians that is what the seas was for that's what the spirit was sent for to guide us are passing through corinthians and galatians all these churches represent different spirits and attitudes and limitations and so on and all these choices were limited galatians and legalism corinthians instead of sin and so on hebrews babies and so on but the ephesian church that was the church that was the standard oh my god and say he talked about a hallelujah the love of god had passed knowledge oh harlow the love of god had passed it knowledge and understanding the love of god past all of that all the intellectual information oh the love of god passed into all of that oh my hallelujah oh praise be to jesus thank you lord oh you love him this morning oh glory to god to all them who don't want to fight for ministry who don't respect man of god i blast number six i do that a lot because men want to present themselves instead of presenting god man want to point themselves out to themselves and their churches and groups there is no man between the prophet and the faithful ministry i want to say it again there is no man between the prophet and the fifa ministry there is no paul between the prophet and the bible ministry there's no other paul but a branham represented paul hallelujah after paul angel messenger a fightful ministry paul wasn't just fifo ministry paul was prophet to the age hallelujah he was prophet and apostle all glory because he was higher than faithful that that regular prophet and fight for ministry but iran wasn't fightful ministry he was above that he was behold i said you realize that the prophet that's different we're not getting mixed up at all so there is no man ministry in between brother branham and the ministry of the bride they are men that god has called that god put used in tremendous way to bring a define and make more sense to what brand brought because it has to have people that take this word and make more sense to it because that's what the revelation does that's what inspiration does but it doesn't put these men in some prophetic realm is some realm that god does not exist because to find that realm you have to find these scriptures and they don't have that in the bible all your seeds are sought nothing by the angel come down from heaven crow with a cloud christ himself coming right down to the seventh angel hallelujah not seven inches and a half not seven a third he come right down to the seven angel give him a message and he dropped the message on the earth in the days of the voice and then that afterwards i heard a voice again say go to the angel who gonna go to the angel and say give me the book the same book that was unsealed give me the book and prophesy again oh i feel good this morning to know that all these years we have been prophesying the word not our dreams not our feelings not our emotion saying what god said if you put it back in the scripture in genesis what could abraham prophesy is that coming sarah you're feeling well this morning but isaac's still coming doctors say don't come back here is that still coming nobody has believed it but isaac's still coming and what happened isaac came oh glory to god what's the challenge of michelangelo hallelujah got to know the rock of moses he said what's the whole stick to the vision does he have his ears and that's hard isn't it because you see when you're cutting a rock that is not a a two minutes job that is not a two minutes job that is years and you have to be able to hold the vision fixed for years and when you're busting and you're cutting and you're honing nobody understands what you're doing but you're caught in according to pattern you're cutting according to vision and only the person with the vision could truly cut it so that is why this prophetic vision has to be released to the bride of jesus christ and then you know what you have to go on to and that is why jesus opened the understanding to the scriptures one two open the word to them it's two things bring it together the understanding and the word when they see the word because you could hear the word and you don't have an understanding you have to see the word get an understanding to know what you're going for so when he opened the word to them open the understanding to them it was quite clear what they had to receive in the upper room so anybody come and say i'm feeling led i feel it after six days you're feeling it nothing happened yet hallelujah what did the prophecy say somebody said what did the prophecy say with stammering lips you had some ellipse no sit down and shut up sit down and shut up you have a manifestation of dynamics or but you spoil sit down and shut up you don't know what you're talking about it's very simple your power challenge corona virus back up diseases back up the virus show much power i have don't give me power of words no show me power of god because paul shake up a snake hallelujah demonstrate the gospel demonstrate the power if you can't shut up and wait because that's what they wait for wait for power and high now these brothers still said power you know yes that temporary power but that temporary power make people run like a frightened man make peter deny christ that was temporary power what was promised was permanent power so we're not even talking about well somebody got healed last year or last week and we pray and something i'm not talking about that that is temporary power where permanent power is dead raising hallelujah devils cast out on the run you doing other layers upon the sick super church super race why period speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them but heard the word that's his fightful ministry not while they talk come never more talk no why people speak the word death was filled with the holy ghost oh give the lord some praises and these people was not easily baptized these people was not even in the message but they were predestinated seed and peter was in the body of christ he had the seed of god in him he had the germ of god in him that he could give out life coming out of his mouth oh give the lord some praises isn't that something that life is coming out of peter mouth and if life's a couple of minutes more debt could come with a man's motto have you ever thought about that that if holy ghost's life could come out of mind's mouth debt false doctrine false teaching and whatnot could come out of my mouth oh my how much people deceive now talking about i am the holy ghost i am holy spirit and life from new which doctrine deceived and they convinced they are right and they are the only one how much groups how much people believe they are the only bride think about it now god i just saved only a certain class of people come on now that's why you from the one other world that's why you deal with the woman caught in a very adultery you're not picking on choosing look at the pharisees that's a good pharisee he calls that collector he called this one he's showing you that he is god he is sovereign he could pick up who he wants change who he wants transform who he wants when joe was feeling entitled that he shouldn't go to that trial he said god look at them wicked people out there why don't check them out why in the fight with me am i right chess man but there's a point he felt he was righteous and entitled not to be tested but the bible said every son that commander god must be tested oh glory to god so if you come into ephesians you're coming to cross jordan to do what to possess what you know is your own because the revelation identifies what is your own so you're going to possess it you're not waiting for some minister or some elder or somebody or watching what others doing no i'm a son of god this is my right these signs shall not maybe not perhaps follow them that believe it didn't say preacher it didn't say pastor them that believe i'm a believer these sign will follow me oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah so therefore the revelation of the word being open to them hallelujah and they understand i mean open give them that power to stay in the upper room not one day not two days until the day of pentecost has fully come and then all who felt they had more revelation than this one and that one all that got cancelled by the holy ghost because the holy ghost will cancel that foolishness we can't have that the eye can't become people he knows and he knows companies already moat and he is no everybody is part of the body so respects to all because those who are part of the body isn't that right oh thank you jesus so regardless of what amen as the bible said he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many will receive him to them give he power to become and this is the part he said make yourself a christian god release power a portion a measure but it's power to become because the goal rarely is to get to charity that's where this thriving is at and until we come to get dear we we short of coming into this thing called perfection because perfection is connected with the love of god and you cannot have the love of god if you can't really even love your brother so the love of god is a big extension of brotherly kindness in a massive way because the sun has just shined the rain has just falled it has fallen whoever wanted to get wet getting wet with that rain and our lives have to become like that no bias no envy no jealousy and people are going to pay for the attitudes and the behavior that is why we use us to strive oh my hallelujah so jordan jordan jesus himself he had to come to jordan there's something about jordan elijah crossing jordan across jordan jesus coming to the jordan and after jordan dynamics hit him it wasn't jesus's son a.g love man must be over my father's business seed and soul he's a son of god and he knows who he is and so on that doesn't exempt him from dynamics that doesn't exempt him from being baptized in water that same son got baptized that same son what fallen obedience and that same son got endured power from one eye but the fullness of the holy ghost striking him the dove descended upon him and that dove is what led him into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life to prove he is worthy now to be considered into that sonship of adoption now he's qualified you overcome the devil privately now he publicly he's had to demonstrate he belonged another kingdom and he's at a shake of the devil's kingdom just think about it devil don't know who this man is or is it written it is written it is also written and when you're watching him and all of a sudden he found the place where it's written the spirit is upon me he's in his ephesians now he found this scripture now because he is about to be the word made manifest the spirit is upon me to do what to anoint me to open the blind eye death then castle devils they never know what no devil saw before this was the first time that why they said this man doing works no other man have done so they begin to see a power and what jesus was doing is shaking hell's kingdom because now they're seeing a man manifesting a power to cast out the operation of satan on the earth because satan needs bodies to work with he needs to find houses to work with and he was hiding in lives that jesus began to expose and boy that make the devil mad oh hallelujah and jesus said the same works i do shall you do also oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so jesus said the spirit is upon me what are you saying the dynamics is upon me for he had anointed me which man could see that this morning which one can say that today because this is what ephesians is all about a land possessing not looking over the land by binoculars and say that is mines that is mine that is mine i claim this no this ephesians means you actually have it as a literal possession the type is in the scriptures they came out of egypt and they had across jordan to walk on a land that they never walked on before it was a literal land the land of canaan and he called that land the land of promise he called that land the land of the holy ghost and that is what ephesians the land of the holy ghost holy ghost possession oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so praise god so it will really take an ephesians church to really produce a manifestation of seven thunders he said what we see should make a church isn't it a prophecy i don't think i ever connected like this before he said what we should make a church that would make a revival what kind of church corinthians galatians what we see should make a church what kind of church an ephesians church hallelujah that will make a church that will make a revival that people will find from everywhere and say the seven thunders that are not written is being manifested hallelujah make a church what kind of church ephesians church is that church gonna be yes sir is that prophesied yes it has oh will we have it yes we will it will be our ephesians church around the world oh glory to god i'm not talking about a physical church in that sense i'm talking about a bright body that connected with the revelation of ephesians hallelujah which is a revelation of joseph perfection the capstone word not jacob grace barely making it holding on trust in the lord and you're trusting god see it through not that but a revelation of judy perfection oh where you have direct access to your god hallelujah direct access because now you have the book that adam lost oh i find this is so sublime that this book that was mysterious this book that was lost from adam this book that no one was found worthy is now in the hands of the bride because a prophet stood there as revelation 10 7 and received from version 10 1 mighty angel this open book and the first thing about seven thunders mrs don't want to preach it seven other voices is for the bride exclusive bridal promise they don't want to touch it and yet we see it unfold to something else and we see what's unfolding too so when i talk about thunders it unfolds our ephesians bright or you're stopping that the manifestation will be the interpretation it don't warrant any explanation and that's what he said it will speak for itself when the holy ghost begin to move in dynamic power it will speak for itself give me a scripture the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs wonders oh glory to god now they go in here and go in there i'm trying to explain this here and make a point here you see the point no no seen a point the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming that word with science following so there will be it will take an ephesians church to produce a manifestation of the seven thunders it will take ephesians to produce a seven thunder revival oh blessed be the name of the lord oh glory to god hallelujah so when you see the true fivefold step forward then you will see a true bride step forward because you talk about bright material bright material not free thinkers bright materials is the material that go going to use to culture the bride and when though god told the prophet pick up and write he says that out of us of the true seed of the word god present christ a beloved bride so the bride comes out the church in this message let me say it again the bride comes out of the church in this message the church in this message is the shock that holds the bride the church in this message is the shock that holds the bride the bride is the rainbow coat they're going to step out of this message they're going to step out of the books and the quotes the bride is not books and quotes the bride stepping out as the vision of god oh glory to god hallelujah my god from a vision to a reality oh glory to god amen amen amen amen amen praise god like the team of this convention like i see it the globe and everything else and trinidad a picture of vision and to see them bring it into reality that is what god going to do what in his thinking was going to be expressed and when moses finished with moses when michelangelo finished with that statue of moses he it was so perfect he strikes they speak it was so real to him and this is what god do it from a vision into a reality there's a vision of perfection there's a vision of a bride it is clean it is clear there is nothing to put on it you cannot wow you cannot have power over others let me say this way you cannot be given power over others if you don't power over yourself and the tests come to show what power you have over you over your tongue over your reaction over your behavior power over yourself then god could give you power over others and other things so they're looking for the truth rightful ministry that's why we preach there's a 500 yet i know people run on cities 500. yes that's fine they have their mouth they're free to do that but i know that when god places fifo ministers they're going to be identified and god not fr is not afraid or bashful to identify his sons he said he will let it be made known among men so even trying to walk humble god shall come here because job was go good you know and and and god stopped satan walking two and four said come come come come come you see this man do you see this man that is my man on the earth i want to check him out so god is in the business of identification we identify with his message all these years but the hour has come when the message itself have to be identified with us and when he does that that changes everything oh glory to god peter is one man before the upper room a different man after the upper room oh glory to god amen you will be a changed man when dynamics take a whole of you or life and the minister is going to be changed when the spirit the ministry of spirit take a whole upon dear life oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so listen the lord himself decided to shout isn't that right the word and jesus come down to redeem us by blood first redeem us by the word and then redeem by power which is the spirit so when when they put the blood over their doorposts they were redeemed they were under the blood that they couldn't calm down and touch them but then to the red sea power come down and god delivered them from the hands of pharaoh and the same way power have to come down to deliver us from this mortality from this fresh body isn't that right we are redeemed we are justified you die you go to heaven you die you're saved but there's a redemption to with the redemption of all bodies so they thought it has to have a true genuine body change and that change comes from inside out not outside in the rapture have to be on the inside give me a scripture a word enoch mechanic became dynamic and god took him the mechanics was in him but something changed on the inside hallelujah and that body on the outside changed oh glory to god enoch was transformed isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord so god has to come down among us the shout and jesus does all three to shout the voice on the trump and that voice of the archangel i believe in all my heart is charity that's the love of god that's not man that's christ himself love god come that's that's that's deep affection that that is what could go after sinners in the truest sense that is christ reproduced on the earth that's what you're not seeing some people get saved and they get legalistic and so on but you're not seeing that power of love oh glory to god and this is what you need to see that's what the world needs to see who could who could who could change a drunkard who could change a prostitute who could change all these sinners wicked people who could change their hearts and the love of god could do that oh hallelujah what is going to be a paradox incredible were true amidst this gross darkness cover the earth not just part of the earth the whole earth gross taxes cover the people god said rise and shine for that light has come what light light in the world to show you there's going to be another ephesians oh glory i don't care what the condition you're wiping husbanding there's going to be a transformation for them to step into ephesians in ephesians husband truly love their wives that's ephesians manifestation another pastor trying to say something or hints something no wife subject yourself to the husband that's in ephesians children obey their parents in ephesians they find out wrestling against some flesh and blood so you stop fighting brother and brethren and this one don't like you and i wanna you stop seeing that and you're seeing the spirit at work whether his uncle aunt husband wife is a spirit at work trying to disrupt your anointing oh glory to god spiritual warfare right inside your house right inside your home right on the job right around your neighborhood spiritual warfare going on let me see if we could wrap up here oh blessed be the name of the lord from zechariah 4 angel came talking with me wake me up to sleep say what see us though i look to behold a cancer full of gold with a bowl on the top of it there are oven seven lamps there of two olive trees by it and i answered and speaking to the angel that walk with me saying what are these my lord then the angel walking me answered and said no it's not what these things be i said no my lord then he answered and speaking of me saying this is the word of the lord and this is a ruba bell saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit see of the lord of hosts who at the whole great mountain before the ruba bell though shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace unto it oh my and the message of grace but abram said this i want you to put on your spiritual thinking jackets now this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the lord or when he did he laid the foundation stone as we read further we find out that god says the rumor had laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth the heads to headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring for the headstone and we know that scripture says that jesus is this chief cornerstone he also is ahead so now and this is where you see this is where you need to say what the prophets say to get a revelation of god's mind and god stored this is what you can't explain away so he's interpreting this now he said no if we will think for a few minutes the seventh a church is messenger was to restore the fate of the children back to the fathers and we know that the seven thousand is to do that right these definitely right watch he said because he said he'll do two things turn the house of the turin to the fate of the founders and read the thunders and his deeds do you finally reveal mystic truths is what will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers but listen how the prophet now put his magnifying glass over that scripture i begin to interpret it the seventh church's messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church under the power of the spirit well you mean the seven thunders is to bring on the dynamics to rebuild the church under the power of the spirit so god must release dynamics to a fightful ministry to make them the rebuilders to bring on that perfection by charity the voice of the archangel oh glory to god because that is what peter had he said you didn't like our man you lied to the holy ghost he had charity inside of him he had god veiled inside of him so he's interpreted he is not leaning on seven thunder's these defining messages no he's bringing a further revelation here now watch the seven churches messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church under the power of the spirit what have we been all of over 50 years the power of the word of course we have the spirit and atmosphere but he's not talking about that yet because to be under the spirit power is to be on the spirit manifestation and if you're under the power of the word you're on the prophecy because you have to wait in prophecy until the time of fulfillment let me say it again you have to wait you don't need to prophesy if the time is now don't must prophesy because the time is yet you have to wait and you're waiting on the prophecy you shall be filled you shall be healed you shall be delivered because the vision is for an appointed time dorytary wait for it it shall come whole glory to god so watch we build the church again under the holy spirit and then he quote zechariah not by power not by might but by my spirit then he go deeper not by organization in this message not by denomination not by charlie one man show and who is the man of the hour not by that not by who are the lead who the lead lead church and lead inspiration lead minister lead revelation not that he said but by my holy spirit god will bring for the church in the last day so not to by all this teaching and talk and i'm almost up musician can't please watch from recognizing this message is i'm going to say something national force put israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world kongs of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride friends we are here i believe we are here in a time of ephesians but it's a paradox in this stressful condition where are we on the lockdown where we have no audience where we have to speak and we don't know who we're speaking to i miss all of that we could take the word and say a dispensation of another ephesians because we serve a god that cannot lie a goder will keep his word a quarter will confirm his word and bride of jesus christ there's a faithful ministry that god have raised up just for you it's for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry which ministry the ministry of jesus christ so this is not man's ministry that's going to be here is going to be god's ministry so i appreciate the lord and appreciate these men that has come forth to give witness of jesus christ o blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah may the lord bless you and write where you are may the holy spirit sweep down in a special way and sweep over your lies and sweep on your homes and your churches wherever you would hear these messages and these services oh hallelujah that god would bless your soul and see what a privileged people you are to receive this entire message and to get a real revelation of this message
