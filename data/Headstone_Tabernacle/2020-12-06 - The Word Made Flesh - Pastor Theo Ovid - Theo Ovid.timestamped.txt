[36:05] the invisible become invisible
[36:10] now let's go
[36:13] so i i know sometimes people find
[36:17] or say it's a bit short or whatnot but
[36:20] what you get is
[36:20] concentrated stuff um
[36:24] i try not to have wasted words and and
[36:27] in the light
[36:27] of the timing that we have have been
[36:30] allowed we try to keep everything
[36:32] compact
[36:33] we have no we will to waste and no time
[36:36] to kill
[36:38] but lebron he's talking about
[36:42] preparation before we go to fight a war
[36:45] we have to prepare for that war
[36:47] if you're gonna get married while you
[36:48] prepare for that time
[36:50] you have to have preparations before you
[36:52] come to church you made preparations
[36:55] he says and god is
[36:58] always he always prepares the people
[37:01] for the offense that just about to
[37:03] happen
[37:05] and may i stop here a minute and i
[37:07] believe that the people
[37:09] are in preparation for the last great
[37:12] destruction
[37:13] this world has ever known they are in
[37:16] the spirit
[37:17] of the last days and god here we go
[37:20] cannot send destruction before the
[37:23] people are
[37:24] in the spirit of destruction so in other
[37:27] words before
[37:29] you could even get into the coming of
[37:31] the lord you have to get in the spirit
[37:33] of
[37:34] the coming of the lord just as the
[37:36] people have to get in their spirit you
[37:38] have to get into your spirit
[37:40] that's how we know that time is drawing
[37:41] near not because something happened in
[37:43] america or happening in south america or
[37:45] up in europe or some place
[37:46] no but because you're getting in the
[37:48] spirit and that is witness
[37:50] to you that you are nearing the coming
[37:52] of the lord
[37:53] oh glory to god so before destruction
[37:56] could be effected
[37:57] the people have been getting the spirit
[37:58] of rejoice destruction because
[38:00] destruction itself is a seed
[38:03] that was sown and came on the mouth of a
[38:05] prophet
[38:07] hallelujah los angeles sinking is the
[38:09] word that came on the mount of the
[38:11] prophet
[38:12] and there's a rain to fall upon that
[38:13] seed for that to be manifested
[38:16] and your word also came on the mount of
[38:18] a prophet
[38:19] and your word gonna remain manifest in
[38:22] your season and your time
[38:24] that's why you couldn't miss it if you
[38:26] try you had to be here this morning

[43:37] don't watch me say amen you believe that
[43:41] nothing happened by chance
[43:45] [Music]
[43:50] nothing nothing
[43:54] romans 8 28 and we know that all things
[43:58] work together for good to them that love
[44:01] god to them what he called
[44:04] according to his purpose oh glory to god
[44:08] he knows all about it it's all
[44:11] pre-planned for many generations
[44:13] so you could be here tonight did you
[44:15] know that
[44:22] so god saw my grandchildren before i was
[44:24] born
[44:28] that's a big one let me say it again
[44:31] god saw my grandchildren before i was
[44:34] born
[44:36] so god knew you would be here today
[44:41] god arranged all your life to bring you
[44:43] to the spot today
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:49] and you're going to hear why now watch
[44:51] let's continue
[44:52] just think about that at one time you
[44:54] was in your father in the dream of your
[44:55] father
[44:56] he didn't know you at that time neither
[44:58] did you know him at that time
[44:59] but then you see you were put in the
[45:01] bedding ground in the womb of a mother
[45:02] to holy wedlock and then you become a
[45:04] person expressed
[45:06] in the image like your father and then
[45:08] you have fellowship now that's the only
[45:10] way you can be a son
[45:11] or daughter of god because you have to
[45:13] be to have it in a life
[45:14] and there's only one from eternal life
[45:16] and that's god's life there's only one
[45:18] from eternal life that's god
[45:20] so to be a son of god you have to be in
[45:22] him always
[45:24] the gene of your life spiritual life
[45:27] tonight was in god
[45:29] the father before there was even a
[45:31] molecule
[45:32] and you are nothing but the
[45:34] manifestation of the
[45:36] gene of life that was in god
[45:39] as a son of god that's what you are this
[45:42] morning
[45:43] i don't care if your mother was a
[45:44] prostitute and the father was a drunkard
[45:46] i didn't have your grandfather was this
[45:47] and god whatever it is god predestinated
[45:49] you to come forth
[45:51] as a genuine earth a king of god
[45:55] all kinds of conditions he disguise you
[45:58] so satan wouldn't recognize
[45:59] to cut you off before time you hadn't
[46:02] beaten pan
[46:03] you were hidden smoking drinking devil
[46:06] thought was you was one of his family
[46:08] only to find out when the word hit you
[46:11] you have to stagger out of what you're
[46:13] in
[46:14] to stagger into the world itself like
[46:16] that great mother eagle
[46:20] you always was an eagle you never was a
[46:23] chicken
[46:24] even though he was in the chicken bone
[46:25] he had but when that mother eager scream
[46:28] over you
[46:29] something in you start to praise god
[46:31] hallelujah
[46:34] [Applause]
[46:37] you are expressed and after his word
[46:39] comes into you
[46:41] to light up this age you are expressing
[46:43] good life in you because you are son and
[46:45] daughter of god
[46:46] therefore you get what i mean you are
[46:48] now made
[46:49] you are setting in this church tonight
[46:52] because your
[46:53] duty is to express god to this nation
[46:56] and this people and this neighborhood
[46:58] where you associate
[47:00] and wherever you are god knew that you
[47:03] would be here
[47:04] because you have to be one of his genes
[47:07] or his
[47:07] attributes you had to be if you ever
[47:10] have eternal life
[47:11] it's always was eternalized and god
[47:13] before the foundation of the world
[47:14] knew you that you would be here and when
[47:17] the word or the water or the washing of
[47:20] the water of the world fell on you
[47:22] it was expressed in opinion i know you
[47:25] are fellowship with your father
[47:27] god just as you have with your earthly
[47:29] father you are
[47:31] children sons and daughters of god let
[47:33] that strike you this morning not
[47:35] son of your father and mother natural
[47:36] sons and daughters of the living god
[47:39] he said whose son am i now
[47:42] hallelujah i was the son of charles and
[47:45] elle branham
[47:46] but who shall am i now oh glory to god
[47:49] i'm a
[47:50] gene of god a thought of god
[47:53] that must be expressed by the word of
[47:56] god
[47:57] or give the lord a shout do you see who
[48:00] we are this morning
[48:02] you are a gene thought that must be
[48:05] expressed by the word
[48:06] you can't come to connect with nothing
[48:08] else
[48:10] let me be seated here we go
[48:14] jesus was the fullness of god manifested
[48:18] he was the fullness of the godhead
[48:19] bodily
[48:21] therefore are you ready when he came to
[48:23] the earth
[48:25] and was manifested in flesh you were in
[48:28] him then
[48:33] because he was the word and in the
[48:35] beginning
[48:36] was the word and the word was with god
[48:40] and the word was god so your genetic
[48:43] connection was there in the beginning
[48:46] when the word came and that word came
[48:49] and
[48:49] become flesh oh glory to god hallelujah
[48:53] you were locked up in him let's continue
[48:55] hallelujah the world was in flesh
[48:58] therefore you walked with him
[49:00] when you were in him when he was on
[49:03] earth you suffered with him
[49:05] you died with him you was buried with
[49:08] him
[49:09] and you are risen with him
[49:14] all glory to god what a fear to take a
[49:17] hold upon that
[49:18] your flesh can hold up you know because
[49:21] your flesh declares what is in the
[49:23] humanistic realm
[49:27] [Music]
[49:28] it's just only three realms you know the
[49:31] first realm is where people really live
[49:33] the human is sick realm frustrated
[49:35] husband first for their wife fast for
[49:37] the neighbor quarrel carry on
[49:39] and victory this one upset with this one
[49:41] and get in a situation and you can't
[49:42] handle it and you're fed up and what
[49:44] like this is humanistic
[49:45] that is that god program when when
[49:48] they issue the commandment that
[49:50] everybody has to come into the
[49:51] city to take census and mary pregnant
[49:55] with joseph
[49:57] they had a choice i ain't putting with
[49:58] the government i don't care what he got
[50:00] men see
[50:01] if if they had gone that way where jesus
[50:03] was going to be born
[50:05] because jesus wasn't in position
[50:08] according to scripture
[50:10] and to get him in position herod had to
[50:12] call taxation
[50:14] and and sign up and write up and and
[50:16] check up on all that
[50:18] so joseph had to take mary and check the
[50:20] donkey and get going into bethlehem
[50:22] because the bible said out of bethlehem
[50:26] you're not hearing me this morning are
[50:28] you hearing me this morning
[50:30] nothing is by chance oh god i have to
[50:33] rock this here
[50:34] god had to send orders here god had to
[50:37] level it here
[50:38] it's not about herod it's about you oh
[50:41] give the lord a shout
[50:43] it's not about no press and the world
[50:46] comes to the churches
[50:48] this is about the bride of jesus christ
[50:54] glory
[51:00] he says setting in heavenly places
[51:04] already raised resurrected to new life
[51:08] settling in heavenly places in christ he
[51:09] said that means so much nowadays
[51:11] church that means so much to us to see
[51:14] ourselves positionally placed in jesus
[51:17] christ
[51:19] now if we are those attributes
[51:22] of god we cannot live by creeds
[51:28] if you are a tribute of god the other
[51:30] comedy baptist methodist pentecostal
[51:32] you're calling by creed
[51:34] you can't be like two hour five hundred
[51:35] healing mirror you can live like that
[51:37] because you could only connect to the
[51:38] world that is why
[51:40] jesus could boldly say all that the
[51:43] father had given me shall come
[51:47] and say i cannot take her in the pipe
[51:50] because he cannot stop all that the
[51:52] father
[51:52] had already given so you are not no
[51:55] coming to the lord
[51:56] wake up this morning he foreknew you
[51:59] that's why he called you
[52:01] in otherwise he was thinking about you
[52:02] before
[52:05] that is why things are pre-planned and
[52:07] god arranged
[52:09] oh hallelujah praise god
[52:12] hallelujah is almighty god that arranged
[52:16] that my mother get baptized at the age
[52:17] of 92.
[52:20] whatever age after being a catholic for
[52:23] all these years but she knew
[52:25] hallelujah that one day she had to hit
[52:27] the waters
[52:28] and when that time come she hit the
[52:30] waters and you know what she did she
[52:32] until none of the other
[52:33] family members because she know they all
[52:36] thought that was going to come
[52:38] so they were stunned when she hit the
[52:40] waters and get baptized in jesus name
[52:43] but god arranged all of that he will
[52:45] confound the wise and the prudent
[52:48] all glory to god hallelujah he will take
[52:51] the weak things to confront the things
[52:53] that are strong
[52:54] all glory to god he will take the people
[52:56] that doesn't look like his people
[52:58] and make them his people here's why he
[53:01] came unto his own
[53:02] his own receive him not but as many as
[53:05] receive him
[53:07] to dare me give power power forward
[53:10] to become the sons of god oh we are not
[53:14] trinidadians we are sons and daughters
[53:16] of the living god
[53:18] [Applause]
[53:20] [Music]
[53:24] may be seated therefore
[53:27] we must be that word bride
[53:31] what is that word bride what is that
[53:33] word by question
[53:34] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[53:37] not a creed
[53:38] or denomination but a living oracle of
[53:42] god
[53:43] a living attribute of god displaying to
[53:46] the world
[53:47] the attributes of god in the formation
[53:50] of the bride
[53:52] that has been expressed in this hour
[53:54] that we are now living in
[53:56] oh my gosh so he said it in the
[53:59] beginning was the word
[54:01] and the word was with god he said in the
[54:03] beginning was elohim
[54:05] an elohim became the word
[54:08] and the word was elohim and the word was
[54:12] made elohim that is him unfolding
[54:16] so ellen was what self-existent one
[54:19] was even god yet he alone could be
[54:21] self-existent
[54:22] function of spirit but then he projected
[54:25] himself into the logos word
[54:27] and that word is what came in the
[54:29] beginning and in the beginning god said
[54:31] let there be
[54:33] let there be he couldn't do anything
[54:35] else but speak
[54:36] because a word is a taught express so
[54:39] therefore the thought had to be created
[54:41] by the word
[54:42] so you can't just think it you have to
[54:43] express it and that's where the word
[54:46] coming
[54:46] to speak it oh glory to god hallelujah
[54:51] so in him was taught he wanted to become
[54:53] material oh glory to god
[54:55] you can't see material that material he
[54:58] was
[54:58] thoughts could you see a thought no
[55:02] it has to become material and the the
[55:05] the channel of becoming materialist bite
[55:07] by coming through the channel of the
[55:08] word so the thought is here in the mind
[55:11] of god
[55:12] in the intelligence of god in the
[55:14] awesomeness of god
[55:16] in the invisibility of god but that
[55:19] invisibility that
[55:20] thinking have to have a channel by which
[55:23] it could come
[55:24] because he wanted to become material
[55:27] this was his burden
[55:29] how could i come from thought where they
[55:31] can't see me as invisible
[55:32] that i could become visible so he had to
[55:35] use the channel of the word
[55:37] and when he pressed his way and become
[55:39] lost word
[55:40] that word became flesh now we could
[55:43] handle him
[55:44] now we could see him now he he can be
[55:47] touched too glory
[55:49] oh forgive me this morning he can be
[55:51] touched
[55:52] by the feeling of our infirmities
[55:57] what a loving god we have what a savior
[56:00] we have
[56:02] he didn't say mysterious all sealed up
[56:04] on the back
[56:05] on stay-ups in heaven he came down
[56:06] himself to become one of us
[56:09] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[56:12] isn't that something else
[56:14] but the name was thoughts he wanted to
[56:16] become material
[56:18] what did he do then he spoke a word and
[56:21] the word was
[56:22] materialized and here it is that's the
[56:25] whole picture
[56:26] from genesis to revelation like the
[56:30] bible there
[56:31] there's nothing wrong is elohim
[56:34] materializing
[56:35] so he can be touched and feel
[56:39] so now we find out god and no people
[56:43] so he know that we will come to the
[56:45] place to read write a repetition
[56:47] so he put the word in print that we
[56:50] could catch
[56:50] the word and find where it is written
[56:54] but that is not god purpose is tea and
[56:55] print
[56:57] no he always wanted to become material a
[57:00] virgin shall conceive that's on print
[57:03] because that came with him out of a
[57:04] prophet but when god say a virgin shall
[57:06] conceive and that was put on print
[57:08] god always knew was mary he knew her
[57:11] name
[57:12] he knew her village she knew her city
[57:16] she knew he knew what generation she
[57:17] would be born in
[57:19] she know you know who will be married
[57:20] parents so when you say virtue shall
[57:22] conceive is already done
[57:25] in his thinking but in the unfolding of
[57:28] it
[57:28] it took a time for the history to be
[57:31] unfolded
[57:32] so that word could only circle the earth
[57:35] until mary came on the scene
[57:37] and once mary stepped on the scene
[57:39] nobody else can pick that up
[57:41] that power that revelation that
[57:44] inspiration
[57:45] only one woman could pick that up and
[57:48] this pride come on now you
[57:49] oh them seven thunders
[57:54] glory to god there's only one woman
[57:57] on the earth could pick up the exclusive
[58:00] bright promises
[58:02] but american preacher ton lord and stuff
[58:05] people could preach anything they want
[58:07] to preach but there are some exclusive
[58:09] promises
[58:10] for this bride of jesus christ and we
[58:13] pump in one to you this morning
[58:15] an exclusive promise where the word will
[58:18] become flesh

[58:56] vulcanize with you
[58:58] afterwards when people bounce it the
[59:00] bunks in the wood

[59:04] people is the word lame hands
[59:05] if they lay hands upon the sick they
[59:07] shall recover oh glory to god after a
[59:10] while
[59:10] you have supernatural escorts because
[59:13] angels associate themselves with you
[59:16] to protect you a long life's journey no
[59:19] devil can't move unless you get
[59:20] permission to move
[59:24] nothing could stop you no weapon form
[59:26] against it could prosper
[59:29] oh god put the hedge around you
[59:32] oh glory to god because there's a
[59:34] purpose for your life
[59:36] no kind coming to bounce you down no
[59:38] roofing falling on your head
[59:40] you're dying by no accident what give
[59:42] the lord our prayers offering
[59:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[59:49] hallelujah hallelujah be too fat on the
[59:53] road
[59:54] there be no mistakes
[59:58] may be seated so watch
[1:00:02] who am i in the millennium elohim
[1:00:06] would be honest sitting on the throne
[1:00:08] and all his subjects are wrong him
[1:00:10] he bred destination before the world he
[1:00:12] said like a man
[1:00:13] building chimes to make chimes the
[1:00:15] molded each bell had to have a certain
[1:00:17] ring
[1:00:17] from the other the same material but so
[1:00:20] much iron so much steel so much brass to
[1:00:22] make it
[1:00:22] to give it the thing and that's the way
[1:00:25] here we go that's the comparison
[1:00:26] that's the way god did he bred this one
[1:00:28] to that one to that one
[1:00:30] this one until he get exactly what he
[1:00:32] wanted
[1:00:33] and that's how we come down god unveiled
[1:00:35] himself in a pile of fire
[1:00:36] down to the prophets then into the son
[1:00:38] of god which was god see it's the same
[1:00:40] god bringing out exactly
[1:00:42] it was the same god formed in a man
[1:00:45] called a prophet
[1:00:46] and the word of the lord came to this
[1:00:48] man so it wasn't the prophet
[1:00:51] the prophet was the veil but the word
[1:00:53] was god
[1:00:55] the prophet was what the veil
[1:00:58] but the word was god so there the bible
[1:01:01] said let every seed bring forth after
[1:01:02] this kind isn't that right
[1:01:04] and the sea was in the earth right and
[1:01:06] there was darkness upon the earth
[1:01:07] but the spirit of god bringing the brood
[1:01:09] over the seeds
[1:01:11] all glory to god so he brewed over the
[1:01:13] prophets he brewed over moses
[1:01:15] he put over sect he keep brewed and he
[1:01:18] kept brewed and he kept brutal
[1:01:20] until finally one came that he blew over
[1:01:24] and that was jesus christ that was the
[1:01:26] perfect son of god
[1:01:28] oh what was he doing he's trying to
[1:01:30] bring back the image
[1:01:32] that was lost in the garden of eden
[1:01:34] because when adam was standing that
[1:01:35] perfect image the whole image fell up
[1:01:38] it fell on the ground so god began to
[1:01:40] brood bring back
[1:01:41] he have set replace enable and keep it
[1:01:44] going down one after the other of the
[1:01:46] other oh glory to god
[1:01:47] what he's doing he's coming back to the
[1:01:49] image and when jesus came
[1:01:51] he was the statue of a perfect man
[1:01:55] the image and likeness at last was
[1:01:58] restored by the second adam
[1:02:01] this second atom was not going to fall
[1:02:04] this second atom was not going to fail
[1:02:07] out of the mouth of the second adam
[1:02:10] what's going to come other sons oh glory
[1:02:13] to god did you know what i said
[1:02:15] out of the mouth of this second adam
[1:02:19] was going to come other sons all glory
[1:02:22] to god
[1:02:23] from his very body he said receiving the
[1:02:27] holy ghost
[1:02:28] he was speaking life over the seeds of
[1:02:32] god oh give the lord a shout
[1:02:35] and today life is being spoken you shall
[1:02:39] receive the holy ghost
[1:02:41] oh receiving the holy ghost life
[1:02:44] is being spoken your life is going to
[1:02:47] change
[1:02:49] oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:53] jehovah as a baby jehovah as a captain
[1:02:57] jehovah as a teenager jehovah as a young
[1:03:00] man jehovah in the temple
[1:03:03] jehovah read in the book hallelujah
[1:03:07] my god so each age
[1:03:10] has been given a promise of the word and
[1:03:13] the people of that age
[1:03:15] that manifest the promised word
[1:03:18] is the seed of the age so all this talk
[1:03:22] and talk about ice bright and when
[1:03:23] bright because it's taken on a church
[1:03:24] this morning hearing about a prophet
[1:03:26] that's not what he's saying here he said
[1:03:28] the people of the age
[1:03:30] that manifest the promised word
[1:03:34] is the seed so if you want to sit back
[1:03:36] and be a choice member that's your
[1:03:37] choice
[1:03:38] but if you want to be seen you should
[1:03:40] see something this morning
[1:03:42] and say you know what i want that i want
[1:03:44] to manifest that
[1:03:46] or you can say this way i want that to
[1:03:48] be manifested in me
[1:03:50] or you can say it this way i want the
[1:03:52] word
[1:03:53] to become flesh
[1:03:57] in my flesh come on now come on now
[1:04:00] you have to say all of it you have to
[1:04:02] say all of it
[1:04:03] you can't just buy the word made flesh
[1:04:05] because that's in the bible
[1:04:07] but when you say in my flesh like job
[1:04:10] said
[1:04:11] in my flesh i shall see god
[1:04:15] for myself another another
[1:04:18] oh glory to god oh my
[1:04:22] so he said the manifestation of the holy
[1:04:23] spirit operating jewish children
[1:04:27] is the seed of the kingdom of that age
[1:04:32] now watch you said if
[1:04:36] you said it's faith right he said glory
[1:04:39] to god
[1:04:40] preacher he said i don't believe in all
[1:04:41] this stuff if you got real fate
[1:04:43] here we go it will declare your works
[1:04:48] your works will declare you say this way
[1:04:51] your works
[1:04:52] will declare what your fate is
[1:04:55] so it is coming now beyond confession
[1:04:58] beyond saying i believe
[1:05:00] no your works will vindicate or prove
[1:05:04] what you're confessing he says your
[1:05:07] works will declare what your faith is
[1:05:09] a boy told me not long ago if god judges
[1:05:12] me according to my faith i am saved
[1:05:14] but if you judge me according to my
[1:05:15] morals i am lost
[1:05:18] you see what you do there he's saying
[1:05:20] he's a believer right
[1:05:22] but he do know all kind of crazy stuff
[1:05:24] you see if he's straight and believing i
[1:05:26] said but if i check my works on my life
[1:05:28] i lost
[1:05:29] listen what the prophet answered him he
[1:05:32] says
[1:05:33] i said your morals testify of your faith
[1:05:38] so in other words that crazy life you're
[1:05:40] living there it shows
[1:05:41] the faith that you think you have you
[1:05:42] don't have there's a lot of unbelief in
[1:05:45] certain that are there
[1:05:46] oh glory to god hallelujah so watch
[1:05:50] he said you know you've got to get the
[1:05:52] living word in you
[1:05:54] to have the living god in you because
[1:05:57] the word here is god
[1:05:59] when it is made flesh in you
[1:06:03] spirit so when the world is made spirit
[1:06:07] in you
[1:06:08] that is the word becoming flesh because
[1:06:10] the spirit
[1:06:11] takes you out of the humanistic realm
[1:06:14] into the realm of divine revelation
[1:06:17] oh glory only spirit could do that other
[1:06:20] than that
[1:06:20] you're operating at the mental level so
[1:06:23] if at the mental level they come here
[1:06:24] believe the word and somebody tell them
[1:06:26] something negative about but
[1:06:27] afterwards you get a mental fight
[1:06:29] because you see that's about me
[1:06:31] that's in your head that is in your mind
[1:06:33] but if you have a revelation and you
[1:06:34] hear any word
[1:06:35] that has nothing to do with you you want
[1:06:37] to know what's the objective of somebody
[1:06:38] tell your negative
[1:06:40] you follow what i'm saying now and
[1:06:41] that's how people can be tossed to and
[1:06:43] fro
[1:06:43] because they have no anchor they go to
[1:06:45] this church they go to this church they
[1:06:46] go to that group they go to that group
[1:06:48] and they're still not satisfied
[1:06:49] because they never encountered the
[1:06:51] person of christ oh glory to god because
[1:06:53] i want to encounter him
[1:06:54] it doesn't matter god to put you in rome
[1:06:57] god you could be in the vatican
[1:06:59] that'll change who you are that have
[1:07:01] changed your name on the book
[1:07:03] that has changed this mighty god who
[1:07:05] you're serving
[1:07:06] oh glory to god hallelujah there could
[1:07:09] be a servant in the purple village
[1:07:11] and so pope francis that they change who
[1:07:14] you are
[1:07:15] and what you call on to give the lord a
[1:07:16] praise this bride is ordained to defeat
[1:07:19] the devil
[1:07:19] anywhere anytime any place
[1:07:23] under any condition why you think god
[1:07:26] choose you in this hour
[1:07:27] why didn't god choose you for this age
[1:07:29] because you know it'd be a messed up
[1:07:31] tied up dangle up
[1:07:34] but he chose you anyhow oh my hallelujah
[1:07:38] so here we go so you've got to get the
[1:07:40] living word in you to have the living
[1:07:42] god in you
[1:07:43] because the word here is god when it's
[1:07:45] made flesh in you
[1:07:46] means spirit and life in you when it
[1:07:49] goes hear you
[1:07:50] when it goes into your flesh and
[1:07:53] your faith and becomes life
[1:07:57] then you are a living example so you
[1:08:00] move from being a professor
[1:08:02] to being a possessor hallelujah you move
[1:08:05] from professing to believe to actually
[1:08:07] having a possession
[1:08:08] because the word has become life in you
[1:08:11] the word has become in your flesh and
[1:08:13] faith not just in your faith alone but
[1:08:15] in your flesh too
[1:08:16] and in your flesh means the word is
[1:08:18] active so as hostile towards your
[1:08:20] husband
[1:08:20] that changes who started was your wife
[1:08:23] that changes
[1:08:24] upset and carrying on that changes
[1:08:27] because now that word
[1:08:28] is effective in your flesh so it affects
[1:08:31] your behavior
[1:08:32] it affects your attitude it affects how
[1:08:35] you see things
[1:08:36] and how you see others oh glory to god
[1:08:39] you have oats and grudges
[1:08:40] but when that word hits you it affects
[1:08:42] it you in your flesh
[1:08:44] that you know you can't hold that ought
[1:08:45] if you hold it god holds it against you
[1:08:48] oh glory to god you have to forgive your
[1:08:49] brother and as you release him god
[1:08:51] release you
[1:08:52] oh glory to god and fate is based upon
[1:08:54] forgiveness as you release all those you
[1:08:56] have ought against your fates have to go
[1:08:57] higher
[1:08:58] higher higher and it brings in an
[1:09:00] atmosphere where you can receive your
[1:09:02] healing deliverance and sealant
[1:09:03] some people are not delivered because of
[1:09:05] the condition of the heart
[1:09:07] oh glory to god hallelujah you have to
[1:09:09] have faith
[1:09:11] my god amen all right let's continue
[1:09:14] you say then you become when it goes
[1:09:16] into your flesh and your fate
[1:09:18] and becomes life then you are living an
[1:09:20] example you are an epistle of god
[1:09:22] read of all men you won't have it like
[1:09:24] christ not the fullness because it's
[1:09:26] divided up
[1:09:26] until they are pentecos so the bride
[1:09:29] will not be a denomination
[1:09:31] so look into a church or a group i
[1:09:33] forget about it it will have to be the
[1:09:35] word manifested to be the bread of
[1:09:37] christ
[1:09:37] so the bride is christ who word talked
[1:09:41] no word expressed no word explained
[1:09:44] no word revealed no word manifested
[1:09:48] that's the bride she's what word
[1:09:52] manifested oh glo you have a time for
[1:09:54] talking
[1:09:56] every time explanation jesus was in the
[1:09:59] temple age 12
[1:10:00] isn't that right and he was confounding
[1:10:03] those pharisees but just would alone
[1:10:05] he wasn't know who that child could
[1:10:06] speak so he's about my father's business
[1:10:08] and for 18 years he was silent
[1:10:11] no manifestation from 12 to 30
[1:10:14] 18 years of silence and he's going in
[1:10:16] here and preaching things that they
[1:10:17] don't even know
[1:10:18] what they're talking about he hasn't
[1:10:20] been two percent word they don't know
[1:10:21] what they're talking about
[1:10:22] and when his time come after the holy
[1:10:24] ghost fell upon him
[1:10:25] power inside of him he slap up and tap
[1:10:28] up the devil and send him running
[1:10:30] take him take a holiday take off and
[1:10:32] jesus returning the power of the spirit
[1:10:34] into the tabernacle
[1:10:36] and he took up the scripture from isaiah
[1:10:38] the spirit is upon me
[1:10:40] cool and cucumber hallelujah precious as
[1:10:43] ever
[1:10:44] and he took the book gets the book sat
[1:10:46] down and said this day the scripture is
[1:10:48] fulfilled
[1:10:51] they start to argue they start to fuss
[1:10:53] they start to carry on and he'll leave
[1:10:55] them the argument i start to heal the
[1:10:59] oh glory to god you had to manifest the
[1:11:01] works and shut them up
[1:11:03] this bright girl shot them all to the
[1:11:04] critics yes yes yes we sat on for years
[1:11:08] but god the word
[1:11:11] will become flesh and the invisible
[1:11:15] will become visible in you
[1:11:18] okay the lord i shall preach back to me
[1:11:19] now all glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:24] all glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:27] hallelujah

[1:13:33] how the critic's mouth will be shut i'm
[1:13:35] now beginning to see
[1:13:37] how the bride will interpret the word
[1:13:38] itself so when people talking in an
[1:13:40] argument will be attended by have
[1:13:41] nothing to argue
[1:13:43] they're just doing my father work and i
[1:13:45] woke also

[1:13:59] you know jesus started with low miracles
[1:14:01] and went up higher higher higher
[1:14:03] first miracle was water in the wine he
[1:14:05] didn't say wait when he water let me
[1:14:06] tell him why no he was a guest
[1:14:08] and he went in wine ran out they come to
[1:14:10] him he said what have you do with that
[1:14:12] and they just say whatever that man said
[1:14:14] do it he said draw waters and pour it
[1:14:16] out
[1:14:17] and then they they recognize this is the
[1:14:18] best wine she has turned water to wine
[1:14:21] he bypassed the person of the grapes he
[1:14:22] bypassed all the procedure all the three
[1:14:24] four six months to have the grapes
[1:14:26] fermented he bypassed all of that and
[1:14:28] just flipped the water into wine
[1:14:30] so he could bypass all your troubles all
[1:14:31] your trials all your past he could
[1:14:32] bypass all that and
[1:14:33] flip your water in

[1:14:41] intellectual flipping gymnastics in your
[1:14:43] head

[1:14:45] something in your heart
[1:14:47] turn water into the wine of revelation
[1:14:50] that you'll be inspired all glory to god
[1:14:53] and being inspired changes you

[1:16:06] and every man pressed your way into it
[1:16:10] oh give the lord a shout come on you're
[1:16:12] gonna
[1:16:13] die out to yourself yes yes yes yes yes
[1:16:17] every evil spirit every unclean spirit
[1:16:19] every wicked spirit
[1:16:21] all glory to god remember god elected
[1:16:23] you before them spirits come on the
[1:16:24] earth
[1:16:26] my god
[1:16:32] but obama there are three elements a man
[1:16:34] follows there are three elements that a
[1:16:36] man follows first
[1:16:38] is humanistic second is divine
[1:16:41] revelation
[1:16:42] third is vision and that's thus say the
[1:16:45] lord
[1:16:46] so many times we are down here never
[1:16:48] climb into this your dung
[1:16:49] deer cast your hopes to the veil and
[1:16:53] okay
[1:16:54] he says now when you're down here he
[1:16:55] said um
[1:16:57] okay mary couldn't understand how she
[1:16:59] could have a baby not knowing no man
[1:17:01] what mary was on divine revelation
[1:17:04] she knew what god said she all she had
[1:17:06] one question how shall these things be
[1:17:08] he said holy ghost all over shadowy that
[1:17:10] was finishing me that old mary needed to
[1:17:11] hear
[1:17:12] she needed to feel pregnant feel the
[1:17:13] belly something moving no she ran
[1:17:15] immediately
[1:17:16] that will fate make you do fate becomes
[1:17:19] active and mary ran straight in this
[1:17:21] against i'm gonna have a baby he's gonna
[1:17:22] go before jesus
[1:17:24] elizabeth have john inside her belly
[1:17:26] already and johnny move yet
[1:17:28] and when she said jesus john start to
[1:17:29] sharpen job oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:17:32] now what if mary didn't go she couldn't
[1:17:34] get any testimony john couldn't hear
[1:17:36] jesus
[1:17:36] but when he had junior jesus don't know
[1:17:38] already he committed to introduce this
[1:17:40] man
[1:17:41] that's why he comes six months before oh
[1:17:43] glory to god because you can't introduce
[1:17:45] yourself
[1:17:46] john had to introduce him oh glory to
[1:17:48] god could we give the lord some praises
[1:17:50] hallelujah hallelujah so the first one
[1:17:53] is humanistic
[1:17:55] where we are done here we see i'll pray
[1:17:56] for that person i'm hoping that they get
[1:17:58] well
[1:17:59] next is divine revelation that's when
[1:18:01] something done in your heart
[1:18:02] anchors it and say it's going to happen
[1:18:04] then something is going to happen
[1:18:06] then the third element is vision or the
[1:18:09] word of the lord made manifest
[1:18:11] and that's thus here the lord there's no
[1:18:14] feeling in that
[1:18:15] that is vision and the bride is going to
[1:18:18] have to see the lord
[1:18:19] or she keeps still so he's actually
[1:18:22] prophesying
[1:18:22] the bible break into that tale level
[1:18:26] which is vision which is the prophetic
[1:18:27] vision and that we're still
[1:18:29] locked in write the vision and make it
[1:18:30] plain because you know the vision is
[1:18:32] is thus here the lord notice when you
[1:18:35] have a vision you can fit everything
[1:18:36] into it
[1:18:38] because the vision gives you the whole
[1:18:40] picture you can fit every part into it
[1:18:43] oh glory to god isn't that right so
[1:18:46] christ didn't send people to build
[1:18:47] churches and seminaries
[1:18:48] no he sent another preachy gospel and
[1:18:50] the gospel isn't word only
[1:18:51] but through power and manifestation of
[1:18:54] the holy spirit
[1:18:55] which will produce the signs of mark 16.
[1:18:58] the message will they want to hear that
[1:19:00] they want to hear more mysteries and
[1:19:01] more talk
[1:19:02] and we wrongly wrote past 50 years now
[1:19:04] since god took the prophet off
[1:19:06] but the gospel is not word only
[1:19:10] but the gospel is power and
[1:19:12] manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:19:13] that would produce the science of mark
[1:19:16] 16.
[1:19:16] when he said go on the one and preach
[1:19:18] the gospel right the word itself
[1:19:20] is dead here we go until it becomes
[1:19:23] interaction
[1:19:24] and produces life so man of word but he
[1:19:27] went dead
[1:19:28] he'd have to take quickness power it'd
[1:19:30] have to take the life of the word
[1:19:32] jesus himself said the word that i speak
[1:19:33] their spirit in their life
[1:19:35] don't just take it as word only because
[1:19:36] god said let there be nothing happen
[1:19:38] it could take a hundred years a thousand
[1:19:40] years but then and there was light
[1:19:43] oh glory to god don't let the time
[1:19:44] element fool you
[1:19:46] all glory to god wants is the word and
[1:19:48] it's god it has to come to
[1:19:50] pass oh glory to god that's why faith
[1:19:53] could work with patience
[1:19:54] once it's spoken
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:19:59] when god told abraham you have a son god
[1:20:01] didn't have a fight you know
[1:20:03] the doctors had a fight syria had a
[1:20:06] fight
[1:20:06] abram had his questions but abraham had
[1:20:09] a revelation
[1:20:10] because god spoke to him so he was not
[1:20:13] in the humanistic realm
[1:20:14] he couldn't have take serious it wasn't
[1:20:16] human instagram but abraham was under
[1:20:18] divine revelation
[1:20:19] oh glory to god and that divine
[1:20:21] revelation gave him a divine expectation
[1:20:24] for the manifestation he had so much
[1:20:26] revelation he had to believe for himself
[1:20:28] and for sarah too
[1:20:30] that her flesh will be changed because
[1:20:32] no old woman having no baby
[1:20:34] oh glory to god so abraham had to
[1:20:35] believe in god transforming power
[1:20:39] and so help me god oh glory to god we
[1:20:42] can produce nothing who we are
[1:20:44] we have to have faith in this
[1:20:46] transforming power
[1:20:48] oh glory to god before you go raptor you
[1:20:50] have to be changed on the inside brother
[1:20:52] the raptor is inside out because your
[1:20:54] flesh be caught up to meet him in the
[1:20:56] air
[1:20:56] your inside has to be caught up that's
[1:20:59] what this gospel is all about
[1:21:01] that's what dynamics is all about my
[1:21:04] goal let's continue
[1:21:06] oh glory i see cancer trembling i see
[1:21:08] tumor trembling i see blindness
[1:21:10] i see death and shaking as the
[1:21:14] sons of god
[1:21:14] step into the anointing and step into
[1:21:17] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:21:18] saints
[1:21:19] you talk about the super church you talk
[1:21:21] about the super race
[1:21:22] you talk with an anointing to strike the
[1:21:24] church of the living god
[1:21:29] glory hallelujah
[1:21:34] goodbye so it has to be the right
[1:21:36] condition
[1:21:37] and he said chicken could hatch under a
[1:21:38] dog put an egg on that dog is the
[1:21:40] atmosphere
[1:21:41] it has to have an atmosphere for things
[1:21:44] to break out isn't that right
[1:21:46] hallelujah he said did you notice moab
[1:21:49] on the mountain israel holy roller dung
[1:21:51] in the valley
[1:21:52] and both of them are seven altars seven
[1:21:54] sacrifices both of them seven blocks
[1:21:56] both of them seven rams
[1:21:57] speaking of the common christ but
[1:21:59] brethren where balaam failed to see
[1:22:01] was the signs and wonders following the
[1:22:02] believers down here
[1:22:04] so both had lambs both had rams both had
[1:22:07] seven both have altars one have signed
[1:22:09] one i have none
[1:22:12] and the one without signing sketches has
[1:22:13] anyone with signs
[1:22:15] listen but the man i have predicted
[1:22:19] they had a cemetery rock they had a
[1:22:20] brass ship on the pillar supernatural
[1:22:22] was with them
[1:22:23] and so it has been all along and
[1:22:24] predicted as janus and
[1:22:26] jambres which stood moses so will this
[1:22:28] in the last day
[1:22:29] but listen to this prophecy now but i've
[1:22:31] got better hopes for you brethren here
[1:22:32] this morning
[1:22:33] that you will be men of god who will
[1:22:35] stay with the word of god
[1:22:37] and let everything else fall right to
[1:22:39] left but still

[1:22:43] no matter if you are dormant out there
[1:22:45] be a good doormat
[1:22:48] and they pat i like it don't try to
[1:22:50] compete with someone else or do this

[1:23:06] we don't come people in our church we
[1:23:08] don't compete with no group
[1:23:09] we just do the best that we can in the
[1:23:12] spirit of excellence
[1:23:13] because we want to move on to perfection
[1:23:16] glory to god hallelujah
[1:23:18] fighting no pastor fighting our church
[1:23:21] fighting not this and fighting all that
[1:23:22] we have a goal to hit
[1:23:27] devil laughing at church wars laughing
[1:23:29] at this past like in this passage
[1:23:30] against church they go laughing at that
[1:23:32] because they have nothing to do and you

[1:27:02] them has the right mechanics
[1:27:04] but one of them has dynamics you see you
[1:27:06] might know the mechanics
[1:27:07] but they take the dynamics to start off
[1:27:09] the mechanics
[1:27:11] to make them work oh glory to god
[1:27:13] where's the point having an executive
[1:27:14] car
[1:27:15] and you're pretty shining and shining
[1:27:17] and polish down and whatnot
[1:27:19] and when you say take me for a spin you
[1:27:21] say it can't start

[1:27:26] there you put a new steering wheel
[1:27:28] you only have nothing shiny stuff like
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:32] it's well polished down everybody's
[1:27:34] taking pictures and posting by the car

[1:28:16] here to pause
[1:28:18] we are here to take pictures we have to
[1:28:20] get down the road
[1:28:22] down to the resurrection and then go
[1:28:24] take mechanics and dynamics to do that
[1:28:27] all glory to god we have this mystery
[1:28:29] that mystery that hidden mystery that
[1:28:30] mystery on that machete side that
[1:28:32] machine top the mastery in between all

[1:32:29] home stress here now
[1:32:30] the church should be you say okay luther
[1:32:33] martin luther had mechanics and dynamics
[1:32:35] john wesley had mechanical dynamics
[1:32:37] penny because i had them what about our
[1:32:38] day
[1:32:40] this is another time the church should
[1:32:42] be fully grown now
[1:32:43] ready to meet christ with the
[1:32:45] manifestation of every blessing he
[1:32:47] promised in the bible
[1:32:48] operating in that one great body where
[1:32:51] he promised he would meet them
[1:32:52] and be worshipping these gracious of his
[1:32:55] oh my
[1:32:56] hallelujah thank you lord so word
[1:32:59] is a manifestation of a thought isn't
[1:33:00] that right first he taught it he spoke
[1:33:02] it
[1:33:02] then the word was made manifest and
[1:33:04] every word in the bible is called torch
[1:33:06] lead in seed form
[1:33:07] and if receiving that human being and
[1:33:09] spoke by the same
[1:33:10] thought that materialized the bible it
[1:33:12] brings things to pass
[1:33:14] isn't that right so therefore here we go
[1:33:17] are you ready
[1:33:18] he said let there be a world before the
[1:33:20] before it could be a word it had to be a
[1:33:22] thought
[1:33:23] so god and creation created the world by
[1:33:26] his thought
[1:33:26] first then spoke it so the creation
[1:33:30] was in his thinking and to break that to
[1:33:34] come to life
[1:33:35] he asked us to speak it so the word
[1:33:37] become the expression of what one is
[1:33:39] mine
[1:33:40] let there be light let there be let
[1:33:42] there be little be
[1:33:44] oh my hallelujah praise god amen
[1:33:47] so here's bob now and if that same
[1:33:49] spirit that said that there'd be light
[1:33:50] and there was light let there be trees
[1:33:52] and there was trees if that's his mind
[1:33:54] that was in christ being you how much
[1:33:55] could it say
[1:33:56] let there be no cancer
[1:33:59] and it would be gone there's a weak
[1:34:03] member this thing should be
[1:34:05] you should be busting the roof we should
[1:34:06] be repairing this roof next week
[1:34:08] that same spirit that same anointing let
[1:34:11] there be no cancer
[1:34:16] cancer going know
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:19] let the blind eyes be open and it would
[1:34:22] be so
[1:34:24] glory to god and jesus said if you shall
[1:34:26] say to this mountain
[1:34:27] and amen and believe in your heart what
[1:34:29] the things you say it shall
[1:34:30] come to pass he said what power has been
[1:34:33] given to the church
[1:34:35] no you can express it by mental
[1:34:37] conception
[1:34:39] that's humanistic as mental realm but
[1:34:43] if it becomes a real revelation of god
[1:34:46] then you see it before it happens that
[1:34:49] is divine revelation now
[1:34:50] oh glory to god because you see it
[1:34:53] before it happens
[1:34:55] so you break out of the humanistic realm
[1:34:57] you break out a mental fate
[1:34:58] and you're going to spiritual faith a
[1:35:00] rock revelation
[1:35:02] not a devoted movie after that oh glory
[1:35:05] to god
[1:35:08] like that old bomb the doctors finally
[1:35:09] said leaving me all you go there just no
[1:35:11] he said he said he's nobody i am
[1:35:13] somebody
[1:35:14] he's had a talk you're on the hospital
[1:35:16] bed he said if i was nobody jesus was
[1:35:18] gonna die for me
[1:35:19] because i am somebody that i'm trying to
[1:35:21] dissim and make him feel like he's a
[1:35:23] nobody's i am somebody
[1:35:24] because jesus died for me oh glory to
[1:35:27] god you can't do that you can't go there
[1:35:29] oh hallelujah isn't that right all right
[1:35:32] so watch if your heart and your mind
[1:35:36] is so in filled with god's spirit until
[1:35:39] your thoughts become his thoughts there
[1:35:41] you are
[1:35:42] when your mind your leading your
[1:35:43] guidance becomes a direct place
[1:35:45] a direct inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:35:48] that's moving in your mortal being
[1:35:49] what kind of people should we be if the
[1:35:52] very holy spirit
[1:35:54] has you so embodied or empowered that
[1:35:56] you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:35:57] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:35:59] your own opinion but the holy spirit has
[1:36:01] you so
[1:36:01] built until your thoughts your being is
[1:36:04] god's spirit expressionism
[1:36:06] through you what kind of church are we
[1:36:08] to be
[1:36:09] what kind of people ought to be to be
[1:36:11] this morning if this random tabernacle
[1:36:13] this morning was so
[1:36:14] filled with the presence of god notice
[1:36:16] what you're talking about filled with
[1:36:17] time
[1:36:18] not mysteries enough if this brand of
[1:36:20] tabernacle could be so filled with the
[1:36:22] person of god
[1:36:22] why when you didn't even use your own
[1:36:24] mind didn't even use your own thoughts
[1:36:26] didn't even have no alternative of your
[1:36:27] own
[1:36:28] just to be led by your spirit then he
[1:36:30] said this you know
[1:36:31] when the human element moves out
[1:36:34] and the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[1:36:37] see
[1:36:38] that is when you are willing to let go
[1:36:39] of your past let go of your fears
[1:36:41] let go of your failures you just let it
[1:36:43] go i let the spirit move in
[1:36:46] watch this and when you empty yourself
[1:36:49] and then will be when the church is in
[1:36:52] its power
[1:36:53] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[1:36:55] will walk in his steps
[1:36:56] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:36:58] being in his moving
[1:37:00] you see what i mean then your thoughts
[1:37:01] will become words
[1:37:03] and words will become material that is
[1:37:05] when the church will be in its power
[1:37:07] so that's not human when they came in
[1:37:09] line in church by the money and all kind
[1:37:11] of stuff
[1:37:12] and peter tell them you didn't lie to a
[1:37:13] man you lied to the holy ghost peter
[1:37:15] wasn't controlling that
[1:37:16] it was the spirit that was there it was
[1:37:19] the holy ghost that was there
[1:37:20] and that is going to return because the
[1:37:22] holy ghost will be back in the church
[1:37:24] in his people come on now
[1:37:27] so you cannot point peter and said he
[1:37:29] denied christ therefore he is not
[1:37:32] you don't go there because you could see
[1:37:34] a brother or sister and do whatever they
[1:37:35] did
[1:37:36] but you don't know when god do for them
[1:37:38] you know what a brother did last week
[1:37:40] but you don't know what god did fame
[1:37:41] last night
[1:37:42] could somebody say amen human know what
[1:37:45] somebody did last week
[1:37:46] but you don't know what god did for them
[1:37:48] last night
[1:37:52] so they only begin to prophesy i believe
[1:37:56] it's on its road when the church will be
[1:37:59] so wrapped in christ
[1:38:01] the holy spirit mankind's away from
[1:38:03] themselves till they don't see
[1:38:04] themselves
[1:38:05] he said they taught but to serve god and
[1:38:08] their thoughts move on
[1:38:09] and they refuse the things of the world
[1:38:11] they move in the spirit
[1:38:12] live in the spirit walk in the spirit so
[1:38:15] fulfill
[1:38:16] the clause of christ then the love of
[1:38:18] christ in the human heart
[1:38:20] moving in the holy ghost that great
[1:38:22] wonderful church will go forth with
[1:38:24] power
[1:38:24] and deity here we go because deity
[1:38:27] will be revealed in the human beings by
[1:38:30] the holy spirit
[1:38:31] bringing to pass the thought of their
[1:38:34] mind
[1:38:36] now any man could speak a word but when
[1:38:38] the word is confirmed
[1:38:40] then you see god you see all these
[1:38:43] modern line prophets
[1:38:44] just want to fix the prophecy after they
[1:38:46] see it prophesied i lie
[1:38:47] and they could go show and go with god
[1:38:49] showing me and they come to me and
[1:38:51] it never does say the lord and it's
[1:38:52] always coming to them there's a line
[1:38:54] demon coming to all of them
[1:38:56] do you follow him saying but when a
[1:38:58] prophet speak he don't speak
[1:38:59] he came to me no and the word of the
[1:39:01] lord came unto elijah saying go tell
[1:39:03] ahab
[1:39:04] specific things and the word of lord
[1:39:07] came under jeremiah
[1:39:08] say go and do specific things oh glory
[1:39:11] to god
[1:39:12] and the word of god came to us by a
[1:39:14] prophet
[1:39:15] oh glory to god hallelujah we have those
[1:39:18] say the lord
[1:39:19] because we heard from that elijah oh
[1:39:22] give the lord some praises
[1:39:26] so then christ then becomes your makeup
[1:39:30] amen he's in full control then your
[1:39:32] torch will be clean
[1:39:34] your thoughts your heart will be clean
[1:39:36] isn't that right
[1:39:38] my god hallelujah praise god as a man
[1:39:40] think in his heart
[1:39:41] so it has to become a thought before it
[1:39:44] can become a word
[1:39:45] and the word express materializes i
[1:39:48] believe in my heart
[1:39:49] that i am a christian okay because i
[1:39:52] have accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:39:54] if i don't cry if i don't move if i
[1:39:57] don't do a thing
[1:39:58] in my heart first i believe that christ
[1:40:00] died for me in my stead
[1:40:02] i accept it as a christian i believe it
[1:40:05] as a christian
[1:40:06] then in my heart then i express it in a
[1:40:09] word i am a christian
[1:40:10] you have to say it you have to actually
[1:40:13] speak that i am a christian
[1:40:14] if you don't speak that then you do all
[1:40:16] kind of stuff because you're really not
[1:40:17] a christian
[1:40:19] you don't believe you're a christian but
[1:40:20] when you receive the word and you
[1:40:21] receive the law you start to tell people
[1:40:23] i'm a christian
[1:40:24] when i go on my job i said i just tell
[1:40:25] people that because i tell them that
[1:40:27] and they will hold me accountable and
[1:40:30] they still say and you say he's a
[1:40:31] christian
[1:40:33] so i used to put my testimony up front
[1:40:35] i'm a christian you know
[1:40:36] that means i'm not smoking i'm not
[1:40:38] drinking i'm not partying i'm not lying
[1:40:39] don't ask me to do something i'm a
[1:40:40] christian
[1:40:41] so you know upfront what i am saying and
[1:40:43] i am
[1:40:45] but when you don't say that people play
[1:40:47] games because it's not people you know
[1:40:49] it's a spirit anointing them yes to see
[1:40:52] how much you could compromise
[1:40:54] yes because once you compromise you take
[1:40:56] your covenant off
[1:40:57] and your blessing fall off and it's not
[1:40:59] that god i want the blessing no
[1:41:01] be covering over you he cannot be
[1:41:02] blessed can't fall through that because
[1:41:04] you're compromising
[1:41:05] but when you put your testimony out i'm
[1:41:06] a christian your boss through demons
[1:41:09] powers
[1:41:10] oh glory to god you put your testimony
[1:41:12] on the line
[1:41:13] oh glory to god hallelujah so he's
[1:41:16] promised another comforter i'm going to
[1:41:18] finish
[1:41:19] how long are you going to be abiding
[1:41:20] forever he said what is the word of god
[1:41:23] what is our comfort today is when we
[1:41:25] receive
[1:41:26] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:41:29] power of the living god lives in us and
[1:41:32] with the word of the god living
[1:41:34] we stand that word is made flesh and
[1:41:36] dwelt among us
[1:41:37] now that same word that was made flesh
[1:41:39] and well among us
[1:41:40] has become our flesh
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] did you hear that we read it and the
[1:41:47] word became flesh that same word has
[1:41:49] become our flesh
[1:41:50] that same word living in you will
[1:41:52] produce the same thing that it did
[1:41:54] when it was made flesh because your
[1:41:55] flesh holds it
[1:41:57] your flesh holds it
[1:42:01] oh glory to god hallelujah so
[1:42:04] jesus was god tabernacle made flesh on
[1:42:07] the earth
[1:42:08] and the bible said and the word was
[1:42:10] invisible now listen close
[1:42:12] the word was invisible until it was made
[1:42:15] flesh
[1:42:15] and then the word become visible so
[1:42:18] where's the problem today
[1:42:20] with all these so-called boosters and
[1:42:22] and claimers and whatnot
[1:42:23] oh my if the word become flesh it'll be
[1:42:25] invisible
[1:42:26] the invisible become visible and they
[1:42:28] say when omnipotent speaks
[1:42:30] the miraculous take place so god can be
[1:42:33] veiled alone when we talk in mysteries
[1:42:38] jesus when lazarus was sick
[1:42:42] he's telling me good not great lazarus
[1:42:43] dead he says sleep it i go with him
[1:42:47] what is jesus in the realm of vision
[1:42:52] are you with me so he is not in
[1:42:54] humanistic
[1:42:56] he's beyond the revelation he's vision
[1:42:58] now he said go wake him
[1:43:00] the man dead and stinking i go wicked
[1:43:02] now he ain't going to say wait wait wait
[1:43:04] i wanna wake up he come among them
[1:43:08] and they had a biscuit on the coffee and
[1:43:09] whatnot and the weekend look
[1:43:11] if you had been here my brother had not
[1:43:12] died yeah i know it i mean
[1:43:15] i missed this i missed the timing
[1:43:19] i wasn't here when he was sick and he
[1:43:20] was dying no he's dead and then the
[1:43:22] sister said even now
[1:43:26] now if she didn't say even no he
[1:43:28] couldn't go further you know
[1:43:29] even though true women are geared even
[1:43:36] now
[1:43:39] then he had to go i promised the man
[1:43:41] there he not managed to he said i
[1:43:43] am the resurrection in the life she's
[1:43:45] out open the last days you know you're
[1:43:47] raised and

[1:43:59] god i am the resurrection and the life
[1:44:02] he that believeth in me
[1:44:03] though he were dead yesterday live
[1:44:06] then he hit him a stunner where have you
[1:44:08] laid him nice trouble
[1:44:10] that is trouble the human is success but
[1:44:13] lord is take it
[1:44:15] does not do with it with man is
[1:44:18] impossible
[1:44:19] but really god could be giving us some
[1:44:22] praises
[1:44:23] things that are impossible with man it's
[1:44:26] possible with god

[1:45:06] glory brother branham he said
[1:45:09] and through his sacrificial debt at
[1:45:11] calgary and his resurrection
[1:45:13] positionally his church in that
[1:45:17] realm that the same invisible god
[1:45:21] could come into the individual
[1:45:24] and make the word visible so don't tell
[1:45:27] me it cannot be done
[1:45:29] it can be done don't tell me this pastor
[1:45:32] and this church are doing that that's
[1:45:33] what i'm going to do with us
[1:45:35] oh glory to god we see the word of how
[1:45:38] we are to become
[1:45:39] what we have to line up with he said
[1:45:41] i've often wanted to come to a church
[1:45:43] i've longed to see it i guess where i
[1:45:44] could walk into the back door front or
[1:45:46] wherever
[1:45:47] and look across the audience see a
[1:45:48] perfect church see men and women sitting
[1:45:50] under the power
[1:45:51] of the holy spirit and the spirit of god
[1:45:53] moving perfectly moving this
[1:45:55] someone had done something wrong in the
[1:45:57] congregation they would confess it
[1:45:58] quickly
[1:45:59] that is the church of the living god oh
[1:46:01] my poor heart
[1:46:02] it's getting all i've longed to stand
[1:46:04] and see a church like that
[1:46:06] oh my and all that you are all that you
[1:46:08] ever barely be
[1:46:09] is based upon faith in his word isn't
[1:46:12] that right
[1:46:13] so hear what that really is you know as
[1:46:14] we close musician come on please a
[1:46:16] change of the heart
[1:46:17] not of this physical thing but the heart
[1:46:20] of your soul
[1:46:21] that something anchors to your thoughts
[1:46:23] that is dull you don't see that no more
[1:46:26] you just see the lord jesus you see
[1:46:28] righteousness
[1:46:29] you see holiness you see purity and love
[1:46:32] and grace that is when you are changed
[1:46:35] and your torch your habits
[1:46:37] your being has been changed from a
[1:46:39] sinner
[1:46:40] to a christian first thing you know in
[1:46:42] your heart
[1:46:43] then you express it with your lips and
[1:46:45] then it materializes
[1:46:47] so then your words become weighted words
[1:46:48] you don't tend to talk about gossip and
[1:46:50] old talk and lying and hearing black
[1:46:52] canal and confusion no you want god
[1:46:53] taught
[1:46:54] when you speak you're speaking words
[1:46:56] words that could produce
[1:46:58] life now if you think of it
[1:47:02] and you imagine you think it and you
[1:47:04] express it and it doesn't materialize
[1:47:06] then you're on the wrong road you get it
[1:47:09] you if you imagine you're a christian
[1:47:10] you're speaking with your lips but you
[1:47:12] find out that you're not you better get
[1:47:13] your thoughts changed
[1:47:15] get your heart changed because it
[1:47:16] doesn't be a record it doesn't be a
[1:47:18] fruit
[1:47:19] oh my you must say what you think not be
[1:47:22] a hypocrite
[1:47:23] that is where you're getting lined up
[1:47:25] now you stop being hypocritical
[1:47:27] you stop being dishonest whatever you
[1:47:29] speak is very sincere
[1:47:30] because you're getting now into speaking
[1:47:32] terms with god
[1:47:34] and you're coming to speak in terms that
[1:47:36] you could speak the word
[1:47:37] so you don't speak something that you
[1:47:39] really don't mean in your heart
[1:47:40] you have started practice speaking from
[1:47:42] your heart
[1:47:43] oh glory to god then you let that your
[1:47:46] thoughts be pure
[1:47:48] your expressions pure you live pure you
[1:47:51] be pure
[1:47:52] all right i'm i'm finishing here now
[1:47:55] christ is the word right god dwelt with
[1:47:58] us in flesh he was the word
[1:48:00] and before it's word it's a thought and
[1:48:02] a thought has to be created
[1:48:04] god thoughts here we go become creation
[1:48:07] when it was spoke by a word and when he
[1:48:10] presented to you as a thought
[1:48:12] is taught it's revealed to you divine
[1:48:15] revelation
[1:48:16] so you break past humanistic realm you
[1:48:18] break into divine revelation
[1:48:20] it's revealed to you but there's still a
[1:48:22] thought until you speak it
[1:48:25] oh you mean we really have to speak this
[1:48:27] thing yes
[1:48:28] hallelujah i am healed i am delivered
[1:48:32] i am free you have to speak it yes
[1:48:38] that is why moses went on to pray that
[1:48:40] pill of fire around him he said go holy
[1:48:41] stick
[1:48:42] and say and call for flies there was no
[1:48:44] flies and he went out and said i said
[1:48:46] let there be flies
[1:48:47] so even though god no flies is the
[1:48:50] channel to terrorize pharaoh
[1:48:51] moves at a speak fit or flight is that
[1:48:54] coming
[1:48:54] oh glory to god to think about it the
[1:48:57] pride must prophesy again
[1:48:58] so you can express it by a mental
[1:49:00] conception
[1:49:01] but it becomes a real revelation of god
[1:49:04] that you see it before it happened
[1:49:06] and express it in the word form and that
[1:49:08] word takes a whole
[1:49:09] and become material a taught expressed
[1:49:12] there are three elements that a man
[1:49:13] follow
[1:49:14] is humanistic second divine revelation
[1:49:17] to this vision you could play something
[1:49:18] for us even
[1:49:19] and then the vision is dusty at the lord
[1:49:21] and the pride will have thus says the
[1:49:23] lord
[1:49:23] this service today was thus saith the
[1:49:26] lord
[1:49:29] because it's the word it's your word
[1:49:33] and you know i was challenged to preach
[1:49:35] this this morning i can't really see all
[1:49:37] the holy spirit you know deal with me
[1:49:38] to bring this message but i guess just
[1:49:41] as i was challenged
[1:49:42] you will be challenged also to believe
[1:49:44] that this word
[1:49:45] has to come into your flesh
[1:49:49] look at jacob jacob was a deceiver
[1:49:53] he's a trickster because he wasn't
[1:49:55] converted
[1:49:56] it was his nature but his gene was of
[1:49:59] god
[1:50:00] his attribute was of god in so much that
[1:50:02] before he was born he said jacob i love
[1:50:03] you so i hit
[1:50:05] because he saw what was in jacob but yet
[1:50:08] that same jacob had to hold on and
[1:50:10] wrestle
[1:50:11] until he was changed and to show he was
[1:50:14] changed he was walking different
[1:50:16] he's walking with a limp because the
[1:50:19] angel touches time
[1:50:21] he angel if he didn't hold on he was
[1:50:23] going to get that change
[1:50:24] he said i will not let you go till you
[1:50:26] bless me something happens on the inside
[1:50:29] friends it's not good to just live on a
[1:50:30] church pew something has to happen on
