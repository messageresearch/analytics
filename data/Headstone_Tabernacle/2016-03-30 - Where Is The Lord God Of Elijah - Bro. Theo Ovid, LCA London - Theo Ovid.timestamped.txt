[35:29] two portion of scripture 2 Kings chapter
[35:31] 2 and Revelation chapter 10 first
[35:34] scripture reading
[35:35] tonight I just came up from Aban we had
[35:38] such Mighty meetings I've never been
[35:41] into a convention what we saw in Aban I
[35:45] Coast my son Isaac was preaching and he
[35:48] says he said that um in every war
[35:51] there's always a turning point it was
[35:53] for Hitler it was for Napoleon and it is
[35:56] for the devil
[35:58] a turning point when the enemy coming
[36:01] like a flood the spirit of God would
[36:05] raise up a standard there's always come
[36:08] a turning point you get this stress and
[36:10] that struggle and whatnot but there
[36:11] comes a time a season a day an hour
[36:15] where something just
[36:16] turns and there's nothing the enemy
[36:18] could do about it so when your hour come
[36:21] that your hour
[36:22] come they try to grab Jesus he said my
[36:25] hour is not yet come you can't take me
[36:27] before time but when my hour come my
[36:30] hour come and when your hour Deliverance
[36:32] come no devil could stop it when your
[36:34] hour breakthrough come nobody could stop
[36:36] it Hallelujah so we are breaking into
[36:40] something now let's read from second
[36:42] Kings chapter 2 verse1 it came to pass
[36:45] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[36:47] Heaven by a whirlwind but Elijah went to
[36:50] Elisha from gigal Elijah said unto
[36:52] Elisha T here I pray thee for the Lord
[36:55] had sent me to beel Elisha said unto him
[36:57] as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I
[36:59] will not leave thee so they went down to
[37:01] beel and the sons of the prophets that
[37:03] what Bethel came forth to elishah said
[37:06] unto him knowest thou that the Lord will
[37:08] take away thy master from thy head today
[37:11] he say yeah I know it hold ye your peace
[37:14] Elijah said unto him Elisha T here I
[37:16] pray thee for the Lord had sent me to
[37:19] Jericho he said as the Lord liveth as I
[37:21] saw liveth I will not leave thee so they
[37:23] went they came to Jericho and the sons
[37:26] of the prophets that were at Jericho
[37:28] came to Elijah and said unto him knowest
[37:30] thou that the Lord will take away thy
[37:32] master from my head today he said yeah I
[37:36] know it hold ye your peace Elijah said
[37:38] unto him T I pray thee here for the Lord
[37:41] has sent me to Jordan and as he said as
[37:43] the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will
[37:45] not leave thee and they twoo went on and
[37:48] 50 of the sons of the prophets went and
[37:50] stood to view a far off and they stood
[37:54] by Jordan Elijah took his mantle wrapped
[37:57] it together and smok the waters and they
[37:59] were divided hither and thither so they
[38:01] both two went on one dry ground came to
[38:04] pass when they were gone over that
[38:06] Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall
[38:08] do for thee before I be taken away from
[38:10] thee Elijah said I pray thee let a
[38:13] double portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[38:16] he said thou has asked a hard thing
[38:18] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[38:21] taken from the it shall be so unto day
[38:23] but if not it shall not be so it came to
[38:26] pass and as they still went on and
[38:28] talked that behold there appeared a
[38:31] chariot of fire horses of fire parted
[38:34] them Bo aunder Elijah went up by a
[38:36] whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it
[38:38] and he cried my father my father the
[38:40] child of Israel and the horsemen thereof
[38:43] and he saw him no more and he took a
[38:45] hold of his own clothes and rent them
[38:46] into two pieces he took also the man of
[38:49] Elijah that fell from him and went back
[38:51] and stood by the bank of the Jordan he
[38:53] took the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[38:55] him and smoked the waters and said where
[38:57] is the the Lord God of Elijah and then
[38:59] when he also had smitten the waters dep
[39:01] parted hither and thither and Elisha
[39:03] went over and when the sons of the
[39:06] prophets which were to view at Jericho
[39:08] saw him they said the spirit of Elijah
[39:11] that rest on Elisha and they came to
[39:13] meet him and bow themselves to the
[39:15] ground before him one last scripture
[39:18] Revelation 10 8-1 we read
[39:23] and and the voice which I heard from
[39:26] Heaven spake unto me again said go and
[39:27] take the little book which is open in
[39:29] the hand of the Angel which standed upon
[39:32] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[39:34] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[39:36] the little book he said unto me take it
[39:38] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[39:40] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[39:42] sweet as honey and I took the little
[39:44] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[39:46] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[39:48] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[39:50] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[39:52] prophesy again before many peoples and
[39:55] Nations and tongues and Kings let's pray

[40:37] inspiration you shall return from across

[40:45] power I'm here tonight to
[40:48] prophesy the testimony of Jesus is the
[40:52] spirit of
[40:53] Prophecy The Voice told John go to the
[40:55] angel notice not go to a man go to the
[40:59] angel and say give me that book that
[41:02] book John represented the bride he said
[41:05] take it and eat it and if you take it

[41:10] you you're going to prophesy now you
[41:13] only prophesy before it happens you only
[41:16] prophesy because there's a time period
[41:18] where the word has to go forth it give
[41:21] the critics time to criticize it give
[41:23] the Devils to laugh and Mock and
[41:25] everything else in that period of
[41:26] Prophecy
[41:27] you're waiting on God it's a time of
[41:31] lingering Hallelujah but you have a
[41:34] testimony it's the testimony of Jesus
[41:37] it's not a testimony of a group it's not
[41:39] a testimony of a man it's not a
[41:41] testimony of a church it's a testimony
[41:44] of Jesus that's the Revelation John got
[41:47] on the Isles of pmos was the testimony
[41:50] of Jesus and when Jesus G them the
[41:52] promise you shall receive power after
[41:55] the Holy Ghost come upon you he said You
[41:56] shall shall be a witness unto me to the
[41:59] alls the end of the Earth he never said
[42:02] you shall be witness unto a group onto a
[42:04] church unto a system unto a denomination
[42:08] he said You shall be Witnesses unto me
[42:11] so we want to get one thing clear at the
[42:13] end of it all you'll be Witnesses of
[42:17] Jesus at the end of it all you're going
[42:20] to be like Jesus you're going to walk
[42:22] like him you're going to talk like him
[42:24] you're going to act like him you're
[42:26] going to be like like him oh glory to
[42:29] God that's the promise of the Father the
[42:31] promise of the father is the holy ghost
[42:34] coming upon your life oh
[42:37] Hallelujah notice I did not say that you
[42:40] will cross
[42:42] Jordan I already see you go across and
[42:45] come
[42:46] back I am seeing you coming
[42:49] back from Crossing Jordan Jordan
[42:53] represents death death to self death to
[42:55] your pride Jordan represent dying out we
[42:59] G Beyond you dying out you going to die

[43:14] and God will not
[43:16] lie
[43:18] Hallelujah glory to God oh praise the
[43:21] name of the Lord so therefore this
[43:24] inspiration you shall return from across
[43:26] Jordan you shall return in power is from
[43:29] the testimony of Jesus which is the
[43:31] spirit of Prophecy he said blessed are
[43:33] they that which are called unto the
[43:35] marriage supper of the Lamb he said unto
[43:37] me this Revelation uh 9 199 he said unto
[43:40] me these are the true saints of God and
[43:43] I fell at his feet to worship Him He
[43:46] said unto me see thou do it not in other
[43:51] words don't worship any man I am thy
[43:54] fellow servant and of thy Brethren which
[43:57] the testimony of Jesus worship God so
[44:01] under the testimony of Jesus you must
[44:04] worship God when Jesus opened the
[44:08] understanding to the scriptures when
[44:10] Jesus opened the word to them they then
[44:13] had Jesus testimony with the Breath of
[44:16] God upon them reing the Holy Ghost and
[44:19] with that testimony they went in the
[44:21] upper room and they were worshiping God
[44:24] every service was a worship worship
[44:27] shpping have nothing to do with what God
[44:29] could do for you whether he do it or he
[44:32] don't do it he still deserve the worship
[44:36] he still deserve the glory so when you
[44:39] get a revelation of having the testimony
[44:41] of Jesus it is time to
[44:45] worship Oh Glory to God and the
[44:47] worshiping create the atmosphere for

[53:57] [Applause]
[54:00] London look it look like we have some
[54:02] unfinished
[54:05] business what a p I'm having myself a
[54:11] time this is brother brandham from God
[54:14] in
[54:15] Simplicity you know I have it here
[54:18] greetings I have me greeted people be
[54:21] all
[54:23] right and brother Jessie Roo sends
[54:25] greeting also
[54:28] amen but this is Brother BR from God in
[54:31] Simplicity Elijah humbled himself and
[54:33] stated with what God Said in such a way
[54:36] that it pleased God to take the Same
[54:40] Spirit from Elijah that he promised to
[54:43] shove it three times down the road from
[54:45] here he sure did he promised that it
[54:48] would come and it will come upon Elijah
[54:51] his successor and then come on John the
[54:53] Baptist and according to Malachi 4 it's
[54:56] to be here in the last day God loved
[54:59] that spirit that was upon that simple
[55:01] uneducated
[55:02] Woodsman what we was so edent to his
[55:05] word he would say Elijah do this Elijah
[55:07] would do it and God hid himself in there
[55:10] in such Simplicity but one day here we
[55:13] go when he got old his bald head his
[55:16] Whiskers hanging down gray a few years
[55:19] he had hanging over his shoulders his
[55:22] little old skinny arms the meat flopping
[55:24] on them like that come walking down the
[55:27] road of Samaria them eyes look up
[55:29] towards dis Skies with a crooked stick
[55:31] in his hand he wasn't very much to look
[55:33] at but he had dust sayth the Lord he
[55:37] didn't stammer with it he didn't stutter
[55:41] now great Ahab he walked up and said not
[55:43] even D would fall from Heaven till I
[55:46] call for it God had honored his
[55:49] Simplicity now watch now you see while
[55:53] it was in the simple way and everybody
[55:56] was against him all the ministers
[55:58] Association and everything else was at
[56:00] his throat trying to get rid of him and
[56:02] everything else but in that Simplicity
[56:05] even though he had no cooperation with
[56:07] his campaigns and whatever more they had
[56:10] everybody thought he was a crank God was
[56:14] hiding himself and when it come time
[56:17] here we go for that seed to get ripe
[56:20] that has been planted God manifested
[56:24] himself by sending fire out of heavens
[56:28] and licking up the sacrifice God hiding
[56:31] his implicity and then revealing himself
[56:34] again now we find out he promised these
[56:36] things the trouble is today with so many
[56:39] of us we want to get so Seminary and
[56:42] denominational educated minded that God
[56:44] can't use us God can give a man a St to

[1:00:01] that right blessed be the name of the
[1:00:03] Lord hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:00:08] hallelujah so when Elijah cross over
[1:00:11] Elijah told him if you see me go you you
[1:00:14] got to stay focused don't let nobody
[1:00:17] throw you off don't let your job your
[1:00:19] husband your wife your children don't
[1:00:20] let family nothing must CH the vision
[1:00:23] because you must know what you want
[1:00:26] Hallelujah he wanted that double portion
[1:00:28] he said if you see me go you'll have it
[1:00:30] if not you can't have it you have to see
[1:00:32] it to get
[1:00:35] it isn't that right glory to God Amen
[1:00:39] now but said Jesus the disciples didn't
[1:00:41] have perfect Faith because they had
[1:00:43] Christ with them he said because now the
[1:00:45] promise was Christ to be in them as long
[1:00:47] as Christ is with them they couldn't
[1:00:49] have that perfect fi fate but remember
[1:00:51] they had power Jesus give them power to
[1:00:53] heal the sick to raise the Dead cast out
[1:00:55] devils he said they had power not the
[1:00:57] faith to use the power there's the
[1:00:59] brandham Tabernacle there's the church
[1:01:02] the bride today the holy spirit is here
[1:01:04] with the power but you haven't got faith
[1:01:06] to move it now Elijah this end time 20th
[1:01:10] century Prophet has already been
[1:01:13] Vindicated spoken word power over nature
[1:01:17] over tumor we know it don't have to say
[1:01:19] sels Let There Be it has already been
[1:01:21] demonstrated when God take B Bram of the
[1:01:24] scene the power didn't move
[1:01:26] God didn't remove the
[1:01:29] power God leave a message that will
[1:01:31] produce a
[1:01:32] faith to unlock the heavens like Elijah
[1:01:35] then to call for the power then so God
[1:01:38] going to raise up some sons in the last
[1:01:39] days
[1:01:42] ah with d Fai not not a Fai because
[1:01:46] Malachi for came to turn our hearts back
[1:01:48] to D Fai of the father so as we head
[1:01:52] down to destination like you're driving
[1:01:54] on the highway you're going somewhere
[1:01:57] unless you're just making circles you're
[1:01:58] heading to a destination the destination
[1:02:00] is the faith seven tunders give faith is
[1:02:05] it's something to be done it's something
[1:02:07] to receive we have a destination we have
[1:02:09] to pick up the faith first then to go
[1:02:11] forward we have to go back to what Peter
[1:02:14] had to what the early church had then we
[1:02:16] could talk about the change of the body
[1:02:19] because they had defate they had the
[1:02:21] Holy Ghost itself they had adoption but
[1:02:25] the bodies couldn't be changed because
[1:02:27] the fullness of time was not yet but we
[1:02:29] are approaching the closing time of the
[1:02:31] Gentiles we are approaching the fullness
[1:02:34] of time where the faith have to connect
[1:02:37] with the power to change this
[1:02:44] body so there it is the holy spirit is
[1:02:46] here with the power but you haven't have
[1:02:48] faith to move the power here I got I'll
[1:02:51] skip that oh praise with a heart full of
[1:02:53] joy you walk into a sick room knowing
[1:02:55] exactly what you're going to say you
[1:02:57] walk in there and you say thust hear the
[1:02:58] Lord there you are a perfect Fai
[1:03:02] Hallelujah so this Vision that brother
[1:03:04] brandham has been restored that's Vision
[1:03:06] that's what he released he released a
[1:03:08] vision and the vision is for an
[1:03:10] appointed time we can't Jer it we can't
[1:03:12] manufacture it the vision is always for
[1:03:14] appointed time but we wait on it but we
[1:03:18] have a vision the vision give us an
[1:03:19] anchor the vision giv us an attitude
[1:03:22] because that's what Elijah had he had an
[1:03:24] attitude don't tell me we stay here no I
[1:03:27] have somewhere to go I'm on my way to
[1:03:30] Perfection I'm on my way to the I'm
[1:03:33] somewhere I'm going I'm not staying here
[1:03:35] well you're getting old that doesn't
[1:03:37] stop me because Caleb said I was young
[1:03:39] now I'm old isn't that right he said
[1:03:42] what I'm just as strong when I first
[1:03:44] started off isn't that right so age have
[1:03:47] nothing to do with
[1:03:49] it it's the fight that's inside of you
[1:03:56] say if you don't have that fight tonight
[1:03:57] we come to give you that
[1:03:59] fight then the devil is in trouble say
[1:04:02] oh sister so and so start to pray some
[1:04:03] more now she's had to fight back
[1:04:06] Hallelujah fight back Hallelujah tell
[1:04:09] somebody he will fight back just turn
[1:04:10] around tell somebody to fight
[1:04:21] back Glory
[1:04:27] Glory Hallelujah we going to fight back
[1:04:31] we going to fight back with faith we
[1:04:33] going to fight back with forgiveness we
[1:04:35] going to fight back with love we can to
[1:04:37] fight back with
[1:04:39] Grace we will fight
[1:04:41] back all right last
[1:04:44] page I'm done to be
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] continued all
[1:04:53] right so therefore
[1:04:58] okay so
[1:04:59] Elijah uh came down to Jordan and Jordan
[1:05:02] is dead the thing that will really kill
[1:05:05] us is brotherly kindness where we have
[1:05:07] to die we have to say I'm sorry forgive
[1:05:09] me it's a is a cross that we have to
[1:05:12] bear but that's the age requirement that
[1:05:14] we in who would love the Brethren who
[1:05:16] would be committed to it isn't that
[1:05:17] right so brotherly carish is a
[1:05:19] killer they have to say it wrong people
[1:05:21] like say they wrong they want to be
[1:05:22] right all the time
[1:05:30] it takes power to
[1:05:32] repent is take power to say I'm sorry to
[1:05:36] power to say I'm wrong we need that kind
[1:05:38] of power it strips you of
[1:05:41] yourself yeah I made a mistake I really
[1:05:44] fail God I struggle I'm struggling we
[1:05:46] like to talk how strong we are but we
[1:05:48] have to strip ourselves to see that God
[1:05:50] want to break us down that we needy of
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:54] totally I'm closing
[1:05:56] I want to bring a testimony from um from
[1:05:59] from IV coast and the thing of it is
[1:06:03] when Elijah got the mantle all the time
[1:06:06] you looking at his mantle and this
[1:06:07] mantle whoa because you see afterwards
[1:06:10] Elijah is so
[1:06:12] anointed that Jordan know what to do
[1:06:14] when he hit
[1:06:15] it Elijah didn't stand about D Jordan
[1:06:18] don't knowest I'm a servant of God part
[1:06:21] left part right no that talk is not
[1:06:23] necessary he didn't need to verbalize
[1:06:25] that he took his mantle strike it and
[1:06:28] Jordan know a king is coming a son is
[1:06:30] coming a Son of God is coming Adam is
[1:06:34] coming and next Adam one like Adam is
[1:06:38] coming now watch Elisha was going from
[1:06:42] son to become a manifested
[1:06:47] son all the critics who standing a far
[1:06:50] off because they're not coming
[1:06:52] near they're viewing a far off they're
[1:06:56] looking to see when you're coming back
[1:06:58] they're not sure where you're
[1:07:02] going oh that's good that's good that's
[1:07:05] good sorry sorry I'm getting excited
[1:07:07] they're not sure where you're going they
[1:07:09] think you're stumbling and fumbling but
[1:07:11] you know where you're going ah but they
[1:07:14] will recognize when you come back
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:25] so when Elijah crossed with Elisha they
[1:07:28] say man he gone he gone off he he gone
[1:07:33] he he he was he leave the inspiration he
[1:07:35] was he leave the message he was he leave
[1:07:37] that time is a private
[1:07:41] roomall God get his servant aside apart
[1:07:44] he got the mantle and recognized the
[1:07:46] power not in the mantle you have all the
[1:07:47] books all the tapes he said but I wanted
[1:07:49] all the message all the time I have all
[1:07:51] the books I have all the tapes but
[1:07:52] where's the power ah
[1:07:57] when he recognized nothing moving there
[1:08:00] was one thing left where is the Lord God
[1:08:03] of
[1:08:05] Elijah and tonight we don't ask for
[1:08:08] where is some man some man of the hour
[1:08:11] because brother brandham said no
[1:08:13] Minister could bring a Revival if the
[1:08:15] ministers could have bring it we should
[1:08:17] have had it a long time
[1:08:19] ago oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:08:22] house
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:28] what we need is a cry where is the Lord
[1:08:32] God of Elijah that's my title here
[1:08:35] tonight we had some meetings in I coach
[1:08:38] just come back from and every service
[1:08:40] are going higher and higher but I want
[1:08:42] to talk about the last service Johnny
[1:08:43] Brother Johnny country from my uh from s
[1:08:45] Leone preach that message and was such
[1:08:47] an anointing and such an atmosphere
[1:08:50] there's no way to describe it but I saw
[1:08:52] something I been looking out for and I
[1:08:55] know is a sign of what we're going to
[1:08:57] see happening he was on a platform
[1:08:58] walking in front and brothers was trying
[1:09:00] to grab him at his foot grab him by his
[1:09:02] pants grab he had to pull back when he
[1:09:04] leave the pulpit to leave to go off the
[1:09:06] platform he had to run back up because
[1:09:08] they was trying to grab him that was the
[1:09:09] anointing that was just flying
[1:09:12] off it was
[1:09:15] awesome it was as if the Lord witness a
[1:09:20] change to the ministry of the
[1:09:23] spirit because we have a promise of that
[1:09:26] we have over been over 40 plus years
[1:09:28] under the ministry of the word under the
[1:09:31] ministry of Prophecy but it must turn
[1:09:34] because Dynamics has been here you know
[1:09:36] in the form of the spirit of Prophecy
[1:09:40] because God couldn't release Dynamics as
[1:09:42] Dynamics if we're not ready for it so we
[1:09:44] can only read Dynamics as promise so
[1:09:47] Jesus breathed upon them receive the
[1:09:49] Holy Ghost he released upon them the
[1:09:51] promise but they have to wait until the
[1:09:54] day of Pentecost has fully come
[1:09:56] then when the day of pente was ful come
[1:09:58] it was manifested listen to this quote
[1:10:00] and I close with this from God call man
[1:10:04] brother brh notice the man being a plow
[1:10:07] boy before God made his name
[1:10:11] Immortal all the prophets that stood
[1:10:13] around watching him had to bow to his
[1:10:16] feet because he had the power of God
[1:10:20] upon him there's here the prophecy now
[1:10:23] I'm leaving you with this there's coming
[1:10:25] an hour when God shall make the world
[1:10:30] bow at the feet of men and women who
[1:10:33] have plunged through and crossed Jordan
[1:10:36] separating themselves from the things of
[1:10:39] the

[1:16:30] it this is my body so that's how very
[1:16:33] seriously we have to take it so we'll
[1:16:34] use Friday as a consecration night in
[1:16:36] prayer and and so forth and as we

[1:18:55] good to be here I'm especially happy to
[1:18:58] see so many young people here tonight
[1:19:01] that is that is such a threat to the
[1:19:03] kingdom of the devil and God is
[1:19:06] rejoicing because the young people pack
[1:19:08] the energy pack the fire and I'm so
[1:19:11] happy for that and you know brother ID
[1:19:13] was speaking about uh where is the Lord
[1:19:15] God of Elijah and as a young person I'm
[1:19:18] not as young as I used to be but I I'm
[1:19:19] still young um it is a reality for us to
[1:19:25] reached the point where it's not just
[1:19:26] about coming to church anymore but it's
[1:19:28] looking for the living reality of the
[1:19:31] Living God and brother Brandon preach a
[1:19:32] message the unfailing realities of the
[1:19:35] Living God and many young people we're
[1:19:37] holding on we we we know it's right we
[1:19:40] know it's real but we know the devil is
[1:19:42] bringing everything that he got against
[1:19:43] us I want to encourage you hold on Don't
[1:19:46] Let Go don't give up the devil has
[1:19:49] nothing on you and greater is he that's
[1:19:51] in you than he that's in the world the
[1:19:54] the reason you have so many trials so
[1:19:57] many tests so many ups and down is
[1:19:59] because the devil knows that there's
[1:20:00] something in you he doesn't know what it
[1:20:02] is but he knows that there's something
[1:20:04] about you you are a mystery to the devil
[1:20:08] you are a mystery to this world the
[1:20:10] world will never understand you because
[1:20:13] you come from God and you're going back
[1:20:15] to God there's a promise over you and no
[1:20:18] devil could stop it so may the Lord
[1:20:19] richly bless you with the channel God
[1:20:21] bless you your wife the ministry the
[1:20:23] church let's just bow our heads one once
