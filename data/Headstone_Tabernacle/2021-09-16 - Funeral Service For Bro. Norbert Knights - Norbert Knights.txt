we bid farewell to dad in the natural here on earth we celebrate with the angels his going home to the heavens there is so much to be said that can be said for someone like daddy who has lived for a lifetime three score and ten years it's hard to find words to describe or even summarize his life but i'll try born in 1950 to harold and carolyn knights he was the third child of four dads spent all his youth in belmont with his parents and younger brother nigel one night while attending a baptist service with bernanton daddy spotted an attractive young lady yvette he introduced himself and a friendship soon blossomed she would later become his first wife and the two became a family of six my eldest siblings stephanie nathaniel and i spent our early years on the hills of saint barb's belmont however shortly before my younger sister karen was born he would move the family to bonnie where he lived the rest of his life dad took his role as a provider very seriously and worked hard to take care of his family our memories of daddy leaving home in his long sleeve crisp white shirt navy blue pants black tie and black officer hat with a gold trim and yours to this day dad was a licensing officer but not just any licensing officer he was officer knight mr knight feared by many but respected by all on the road mr knights would make many a maximum scamper especially on the priority bus route anybody can testify to this i believe all his children had similar experiences being picked up from school and on the way home having to make many details and stops as a result of him chasing some law breaker upper side street or stopping every five minutes to pull a maxi or taxi driver over for overloading excessive loud music or dark tint i used to hide in the backseat because i didn't want them to mark my face nathaniel remembers being stared at by drivers as if they wanted to beat him because daddy emptied a maxi for overloading with school children karen and stephanie had similar experiences being pulled over by daddy all righty had to do is just step out of the car and all taxis on the stand got in line at the office he took no bribes a no nonsense person a stickler for rules a man of integrity that didn't look that didn't back down or given to anyone when it came to doing the right thing mr knight however he didn't spend all his work life at licensing he moved the traffic management branch as a traffic safety officer and was involved in road safety programs school lectures and defensive driving training until he retired at home at home mr knight's uncle nobody daddy was just as strict everyone in the neighborhood respected him and some were even afraid of his seeming severity you could not come in his yard to lime or waste time daddy ran a tight ship he pushed us and supported us in our academics he cheered us on in our endeavors he kept a tight grip on his daughters whenever we went out even though he knew where and with whom he still called even if it was with the young people from church he wanted to know exactly what time and who would drop us home all through adulthood as well nathaniel did not always fare so well many a night he would reach home after suit an hour and meet the front door locked thank god for mommy despite that strict approach we knew he loved us daddy also loved his barbadian family uncle nobod for those that didn't know was beijon by dissent his daily calls to his nieces sometimes several times a day were an important part of his routine and whenever he could he would travel there to spend time and catch up with family and friends that was not just our father but a father figure and mentor to others he had adopted two sons that he took under his wings lorne greene and christopher jackson and helped nurture and guide them to be who they are today liesel and kalisha were also adopted into the family and they called him pops young men like calvin nigel and ahab and just to name a few looked up to him and often sought his counsel after mummy passed away dad would meet and marry sister greece and they spent the last 13 years together our family now expanded and he embraced her two children alicia ann salvon dad and auntie grace had 11 grandchildren among them despite his ailments which is the grace by his side in his later days he always looked forward to family gatherings with her soul a real family man and devoted christian brother knights was a true servant of god always giving up himself and his time whenever and wherever he could in service but a knight served that headstone tabernacle in many capacities a humble man never hesitated to work for the lord and he did it to perfection down to the very last detail whenever the church held international conventions dad showed up for duty welcoming and greeting the brethren and ministers both local and foreign with his signature smile making sure they had everything they needed making sure they felt at home and coordinating their transport for smooth transitions as a true organizer he spearheaded the church library managing recordings and books keeping it running like a well-oiled machine then training other members to do same but the knights was a reliable dependable gentleman he never stopped praying he had some rough moments but held onto god's promises he constantly prayed for his family and brethren even to the end i'm very sure daddy grandpa uncle mr knights brother knights you will be missed we are all saddened by such a great loss of a husband father grandfather brother uncle in-law cousin friend and mentor we will miss your counsel guidance and words of wisdom hugs arguments disagreements laughter jokes singing and his goofy smile whenever his dentures were out we know that you are paying free and rejoicing with those gone before you have fulfilled your purpose here on earth and god called you home his son may you rest in peace amen amen you appreciate that today praise our name it alone amen thank you so much sisters amy [Music] for that wonderful eulogy amen amen at this time we'll have special tributes and uh we'd like to call upon uh lika zalika and kiara i hope i got that right yeah uh to do a poem okay so if they just come and do so amen that would be fine if tomorrow starts without me if tomorrow stanford told me and i'm not there to see if the sun should rise and find your eyes filled with tears with tears for me i wish so much you didn't cry the way you did today while thinking of the many things we didn't get to see i know how much you all love me as much as i love you and each time that you think of me i know you'll miss me too but when tomorrow starts without me please try and understand that an angel came and called my name and took me by my hand and said my place was already in heaven far above and that i'd have to leave behind all those ideally love but as i turned to walk away a tear fell from my eye for all my life i didn't always thought i didn't want to die i had so much to live for so much left yet to do it seems almost impossible that i'm leaving you i thought of all the yesterdays the good ones and bad i thought of all the love we shared and all the fun we had if i could live yesterday jeff even for a while i'd say goodbye and kiss you and maybe see you smile but then i fully realized that this could never be for emptiness and memories would take the place of me and when i thought of wilderness things i might miss come tomorrow i thought of you and when i did my heart was filled with sorrow but when i walked through heaven's gate i felt so much at home when god looked down and smiled at me from his golden throne he said this is eternity and all i have promised today your life on it is past but there is life start anew i promise not tomorrow but today will always last and since each day the same there is no longing for the past you have been so faithful so trusting and so true though there were times you didn't you did some things you shouldn't have done but you have been forgiven and now at last you're free so won't you come and take my hand and share my life with me so when tomorrow starts without me don't think we are far apart for every time you think of me i'm writing your heart wonderful do you appreciate that today amen and amen now uh one more item we'd like to have um we like to call on the brother of the deceased brother nigel knight as you begin to come forward and say a few words to us this evening amen good afternoon was my eldest brother we grew up in belmont together we went to school in primary school together and he went to college i did i didn't go to that but after his maturity and getting married and moving to borneo we had a very close bond i would visit him he would visit me but when you come by me you know he's home because there's another house and we had a good thing going even when he was married even we would have a little get together and things like that but the main thing is that he was always a serious fellow commented his scripture in the bible and family that is his role but the thing is even when we had that closeness and we separated we were never a part and that we would call one another more than once a day and i can remember times when any problem i have i would call him and he would be my backup if like for instance even already land business it was he was here i like korea and i see what i do and he was always there for me and we had that close-knit friendship the funny thing is on friday before he went and do the operation i leave grundy and i come home by him and spend some hours he said i'm talking making joke tell me going to the operation next week never realizing that would be the last time i would see him personally but the tuesday you know monday we call and we talk as usual and anytime you're going for the operation on wednesday when they call me and tell me what's going on would you believe tuesday morning i pick up my phone to text as usual i nearly text him because it's so in me that we are custom having that relationship every day where the script here or what that when i pick up the phone and i go to press it then i get myself something and this is the kind of relationship we have he's that kind of person and he will be miss but i know he's in the lord and this is my comfort thank you [Applause]

transport um is he here is it okay great wonderful so he makes his way forward amen to say a few words on behalf of the disease amen god bless you good afternoon everyone the family of mr nobod knights and friends of the family on behalf of traffic management branch i wish you expressed our great sorrow as mr robert knights have a silently closer dog life and departed from us my history with this dear friend began in 2003 when as an engineer i joined traffic management branch mr nyx he was one of two traffic safety officers assigned to the branch working out of the head office in port of spain from day one we had a jovial and cooperative relationship we shared experience both professional and personal on the professional level he was considered by oil to be an expert in the area of road safety his knowledge and wisdom was sought by all of us juniors we were in comparison to him it was a great benefit that made our roads safe with his guidance as time went on he arrived at the point he arrived at the point of retirement from the ministry he consented to continue on a contract position as a traffic management inspector and that allows us the opportunity to experience more of his advice for a bit longer eventually he did go into retirement in a way he continued to do road safety with other agencies and that is that is the most special thing that somebody after all at this time incentives going home and doing gardening or anything like that he keep his mind on the fact that our roads need to be safe i can with all prejudices say that he give more than he received he give give give such was the value of mr nova knights in retirement in his retirement we at traffic management branch continued on as best as we could leaning heavily on the knowledge and the advice he left for us it was greatest sadness we now face this person i will have to face a future without being able to just alter the blue reach out to him family colleagues friends hearts and prayers are with you we'll all miss him good night mr nyx traffic safety officer supreme i wouldn't say much on a personal side with his interaction with me other that my family my wife my two daughters they sends their condolences on his person and i thank you all for the opportunity to come and speak in this forum [Applause] this afternoon amen and amen please go on is the previous gentleman here yep yeah no not yet okay all right we'll be moving on the program we'd like to call on our precious brother uh reverend ronald mountain amen as you would be getting ready to come forward and say a few words about our precious brother norwood knights amen this afternoon so go bless you as he comes amen praise god well greetings to all all souls everybody here to support our fresher soul precious brother who has gone unto the lord i have known for the night as a dear friend even before we became president of brothers in christ together and i was teaching at the glacial argentine school in vermont there and i met for a night's day i believe it was 1969 he used to come to the school because he had one or two teachers in the school who is friends and i'll say a little more about that because knights has always sung well i'm seeing it now where nights one of the qualities of other knights was always somebody who was always trying to improve himself i should see improve his knowledge grease of life and or life in general and brandeis would always attach himself to persons whom he felt could help him on life's journey and that's a great quality that i have observed in veronites and he brought that quality over into his christian walk with the lord and his devotion to the word of god and he has always been had a great capacity and a great thirst within him for the word of god and to improve and serve their why um renaissance when i when we became friends at gloucester i discovered very early that we were we had the same birth date so 10th of october 1950 was his 10th of october 1946 was mine i landed here four years before him and but the thing is he has entered where i landed on earth four years before him and he has entered the portals of glory before me so we always had this kind of twin relationship we used to describe ourselves as twins spiritually speaking because of that same buddhist and we are also baptized on the same day um i think as the root referred to that and absolute i didn't know that he had met his first wife on that day this was quite a revelation to me but there's a little story around the baptism but knight is the one who introduced me to this message that we follow and um actually by introducing me mainly to brother phipps who was an evangelist at the time and um [Music] brazil was the one who really you know gave put me into the depths of the message but the nights when i were in the baptist feasts together and he met with the phipps at some point in time and he used to tell me about this brother and this message and so on and i wasn't too impressed at first but then after the night's wedding to so when he was getting ready to eat that um i met with the hips and when the fifth was there um telling me asking me because i was a preacher baptist church and where the night is there and where the sisters they are asking me if i know what church age we're living in well i hadn't a clue as to what he was talking about i didn't even know there was such a thing as church ages far less of the action of your churches you know you're living in so i tell you well you tell me so you said laodicea and um he said you are a preacher and you don't know what your church you're living in you know well i don't know how you expected me to know but i i soon found out because i went home and um between sleep and week i heard a voice say loudly sail and that kind of shook me and brother sims was introducing me to baptism in jesus name but the night was already convinced of it and um i was kind of like oh that's cutting splitting hairs you know but then i i became convinced so the day of the night's baptism he decided to get baptized um in jesus name because you know people look at baptizing father son and holy ghost uh i was baptized that way but jesus name you know so he and he invited me of course to the baptist and of course i'd be here for the night's baptism not knowing and i suspect this was a little arrangement routine for the knights and would have hits because it's actually when i was at the baptism at karanas i said um he said to me uh branton would you like to get rough times i said i didn't bring any clothes you know i was convinced already and um he said well i brought clothes so he had a plants and everything and he wrote a toil and everything so i couldn't refuse because i was already convinced and the clothes were there and um we got baptized together and god is an eyewitness after our president reinvoke him right down on the sea as he came out of the water so that was my great moment with my dear friend were knights and one of the things this is a bit of humor here we um i used to in order to supplement my salary i used to get eggs wholesale from a farm in santa cruz i lived and i would go house to house and sell do home deliveries and when knights got into it after a while as well doing home deliveries now he told me and as the officer said just now you're the safety officer so you find that they would invite these safety officers to schools to um talk to the children about road safety so when i went to one of these schools to talk about roar just now where nice gave me this joker so it's not me telling the joke on him she told so he's there question his officers clothes and everything and safety officer real you know serious and he's telling holloway safety you know a little boy at the class shouted out he used the eggman [Laughter] you know a time we had quite a time in our lives he was full of humor nights as you know and he was very personable as the officer testified as well and he's very friendly and he would make friends very easily with people and he was very strict really and i could believe some of these stories he told um esther root um but he was very strict and he brought that strictness over into his work and made him very professional and nothing wrong with me in being strict you know but he had that personality so i loved him dearly as a friend i was in touch with him during his ailment and um we still you know when we're talking on the phone during his ailment and he's cracking jokes and i said well you still have this sense of humor and so on and we would laugh and talk and so on it was used to hear that he had passed on the very morning i think that he had passed the night before or also and i heard it the next morning so farewell my dear friend it was wonderful shredding the signs of time with you the little footprints you have had together and i know that you're in a place that we all long to be so god bless your family we are your friends are with you wife grace um a good a good name to house a companion for the rest of the the the um for the remaining years of his life and um all the well-wishers on the headstone tabernacle you would miss a dear brother i know for sure and our friends are with you all god bless your pastor for the ovid and brother and um my precious friend here and all of you

this gathering today and we pray that your presence be upon the night's family in a special we may visit them with comfort with your love with your grace bless this time of the service or this little exhortation may interpret it to the hearts of the people and jesus might ask it amen god bless you just want to read two portions of scripture uh revelation 20 reading from verse 11 to 15 and the other scripture i want to read from science 90 and that's times 90 his description of the night shared with me many many years ago and i [Music] i um it just stuck with me and i said that if it's one script i'm going to read is that one that he shared from sam's 90. but i want to read from revelation 20 reading from verse 11 is i saw a great white throne on him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened another book was open which is the book of life and the dead would judge out of those things which are written in the books according to their works and the sea give up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered of the dead which are in them and they would judge every man according to their works so this is not when you're dead you're done all the dead good evil bad ugly whatever they have to come up and listen and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death or there's a second death yes there is verse 15 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire under some psalms 90 the prayer of moses is the man of god lord that was been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth forever that was formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting though at god the alternates man to destruction and serious return the children of men for a thousand years in thy sight about us yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night though carries them away as with a flood they are us asleep in the morning they're like grass which grow it up in the morning it flourish it and grow it up in the evening it is cut down and wither it for we are consumed by the anger and by rat we are are we troubled that was set our iniquities before thee our secret sins inside light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in thy wrath and this is a part i want to emphasize we spend our years as a tale that is told the days of our years are three score years and ten and if by reason of strength may be four score years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away who know at the paul then anger even according to thy fear so is irat so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom may god bless this word you may be seated but i want to thank you for coming out and um to give your respects uh to our brother knights as you all know he was an active member of this assembly and he held his but isaac said almost every office usher deacon trustee elder and he was a friend of mine i remember years ago when he had some problems and challenges and troubles he called me he said well to you i don't want to speak to a pastor i want to speak to a friend say here am i we have been friends since and if there's one person understood the vision that we presented was brother knights and um i shared with him comes in the library and he caught it to have that support system that the people could go and have food in the storehouse and he really run with it and i certainly appreciate all that he has done and he really gives service to the saints of god many things you don't know behind the scenes what he'd be working on working with and how you have been such a tremendous assistance to the ministry he was a close right-hand person to us we will surely miss him but then to our texts it is a text that he he spoke to me about it in a certain way and i just just i couldn't leave it and you know it's kind of odd i haven't visited any home really since the pandemic and um it so happened the friday before he passed our sister marie asked if we could go for a drive we had two of our of our grandchildren she said let's go down by brown knights and went on there went to his home speak a little bit to him and little did i know that was the last time i was seeing him last time i remember the last few words i shared with him why is car and he gave me that nice smile i call it yeah that night smile and i said god knows all things uh you know and it it it speaks to us things like this because this is not what we expect this morning to learn mary i didn't expect to have as part of um the the um what i say we had a funeral on november 9th this is not what i expect to have written here but it is what it is and we just be grateful to god that we have this opportunity to [Music] pass each other's in in in a way where we could meet each other and be a blessing to god's people he had a picture of the kingdom and this is what we share but you're not serving a church you're serving the kingdom of god we don't belong to this building or this group we really and sincerely belong to god's kingdom and we get this opportunity you know to serve him with all our hearts we spend our years it's it's powerful how the bible say our years as if you own it but we have years as a loan not as if we own but is loaned to us just as our children alone to us many people don't catch that even your children is on loan to you we spend our years our years because it's a loan to us your years our years and god has fit time into years into years he fit months into months he fit weeks into weeks if it days in the days he fit hours into hours he fit minutes into minutes he fits seconds as you waste and spend your seconds you spend your minutes you spend your days your weeks your months your years and you end up right there in that box we spend our years as a tale that is stored many times we take time for granted time in itself now time has a beginning and anything that has a beginning has an end you know you stink sometimes age bring wisdom that's not all together true sometimes aids just bring people older not wise because people could be set in their ways so that is why we exhorted to help us lord to teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom wisdom is not knowledge knowledge is information wisdom is how you're going to apply that knowledge to your life i remember ten years before when a night retired speaking with him i said brother knights say 10 years from now you'll be retired what's the plan and he watched me as as if in amazement what are you talking about and of course i'm younger than him but i like to see a vowel i like to see a vision that your steps could be measured to where you know you have to go well those 10 years past so swiftly that he told someone you know but i overtold him ten years ago about he's going to retire he never took it on and when he went to work declare his desk in other words they once said get out quickly that's how the system is they have no time with you somebody doesn't want to sit in your seat and i said this to say this to you without a vision without you being introspective of your life to say where am i going you will continue along the same trajectory you need to pull back and take a pause and say wait a minute talk to yourself go in the mirror where i am going how am i going how am i doing many people don't take inventory they live day by day and some people think they own the days but you don't that is why you have to consider god for your mercy and grace i thank you because you give me this day that i could breed that i could live that i could have friends and so on like that the days or years be three scores and ten seventy if my reason of strength to be four score years yet in their strength labor and sorrow it is soon cut off and we fly away and i was thinking something in thinking about preparing something to share with you about aging and about becoming vulnerable jesus told peter you're young you do your own thing but someday when you get older you will be led where you don't want to go and many times we feel because we have strength and amount and we have money or we have a car we have this or we have that we could stay and do whatever we want but we all heading down this this bridge this road this road of accountability this road that we must give an account and that's why i read this scripture all the dead from the sea they're coming up they have to be judged and then there's a second dead we have an opportunity to make this bridge this turn and every time somebody slip over a sin going on because we have no we have many people that have gone on to be with the lord it's like a mystery what are they doing who are they meeting just a couple of months but amanda has left us i mean no better nights i'm having a good fellowship among us we we we know that but yet it's a mystery and i uh preaching on the funeral or i don't like to talk too much about the resurrection to your phone and your wood body and things that you know i mean i don't really like to go too much deer because it's good it's the word and everything else but i want to not give him a good send off give you a good send off because we're not here to send him off he's off already it's how you're going to spend the rest of your years and what will be the tale toll of you you know i understand somebody came to the funeral one time and when they started talk about the person somebody get up to look in the box see the right funeral because what they were saying and the person in the box is two different things this is not the case here what they are saying and the person in the box is what you heard about we spent our years as a tale that is told today you hear the word change a lot new normal things changing and everything else but there are things that happen in our lives that change us forever this is one of them and debt have a way of sobering drunk men that have a way of reminding you your money care hold that you know i mean don't call me number yet you can't do that you can't bribe you can't say not yet would have said boundaries we cannot cross the loss of a loved one nobody could explain away already explain how someone feels it's a loss if you've never had a debt in your life you don't know what it is for somebody to grieve i've lost a husband a wife a son a daughter you don't know but we sorrow but not as them who have no hope we sorrow we're not going to smile like if it's a party or dance we sorrow we feel it but not of them who have no hope hallelujah praise the name of the lord and with this in mind how much it will take how much time it will take to say i'm sorry forgive me i didn't mean to hurt you i i am wrong how much time it will take to make things right we spend our years as a tale that is told all within the context of three score and 10. bible called 40 as a generation when i was blessed to read 70 and after you pass 70 you know you're only overdrive over time you're getting extra blessed you have no guarantee so if you over 70 you better ball hallelujah hallelujah which we're gonna live in right through i'm telling you it's scary you know quite heading down there and i wish i could hold back the clock what time of a way of just ticking thicken thicken your vex is still taken you get angry it's still ticking you're upset it thickens still i ain't talking to you it's still taken time going time going time going that's how it is job 14 5 seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee that was a point in his bongs that he cannot pass since a man days are already determined and the number of his months is holding your control and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time we are trapped in the time under the law of ezekiel 3 2 a time to be born in a time to die heard a woman give a story one time of death coming from somebody and every time people running scared but this person is had a treat that nice that knock on the door big hook sticks story and give dead breakfast lunch and dinner and he feels that comfort you know but it's nice see if we could keep off that so he went upstairs and see and he cooked stick name on the top while that was sleeping that's how go and take a rest and he take and he raised his name from on top and put at the bottom and when that wake up they'd say oh gosh you're treating me so nice i already come for you you know but i went started at the top poke start at the bottom the boundaries are said that you cannot pass to everything there's a season of time to every purpose of him point a bit point b debt the boundaries we cannot pass daniel 12 says at that time my culture stand up the great prince which standed for the churn of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was nation even at that same time at that time that people shall be delivered oh everyone that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the filament and leader to maintain righteousness as the stars forever and ever but dull down you'll shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end though many shall run to and through knowledge shall be increased names written in this book teach us a number of days teach us the number of days that we apply our hearts to wisdom wisdom because right now you are caught on it in time between heaven and hell angels and demons caught between a pull from above and are pulled from below an earth caught above a tree four dimension firstly of saved souls secondly of angels and turd of god himself on earth you're caught below a threefold dimension of lost souls than demons than satan himself and you are given the opportunity for a changed life an opportunity to repent to repentance to change to turn to feel or express sincere regret remorse for one's wrongdoing or sin a couple of weeks before he passed but the clients drop across some equipment for me he used to turn the vhs the dvd and stuff and he told me by the night you know all the things he loved and i know he he loves his gadgets if it's one thing i can't separate him from his gadget his things he said but you say all the desire for those things are gone you see brother nice was emptiness backpack yeah yeah we we have a lot of things on our back are we packing up more things we're loading up where you're going with that you can carry that with you so you tell me he lost the desire for all those things and it struck me it's not age sometimes change people know but it's pain and suffering let me say that again not age but pain and suffering you see all them catch phrases too blessed to be stressed take that out [Music] jesus the bible said learn obedience by the things that he suffered nobody wants to suffer i was really believing god for him to be delivered out of his suffering because he was suffering i am glad for him because he is in a better place he's in a region of the blessed he's no longer in suffering and pain he no longer have gray hair and gray beard hallelujah he's back young again oh glory to god he's going on with the saints we've gone on before hallelujah is not wonderful this is our hope as christians not to establish down here but but in time and understanding that time is a kink in eternity oh glory to god and one day that king could be ironed out and it will be one day eternity oh glory to god this king called time that split up at years and months and weeks and days and hours and minutes and seconds it will be all over the angel already said time shall be no more time myself have to run out oh glory to god we are destined to a better place oh glory to god we're getting old for nothing we are dying for nothing his debt is not in vain there is going to be a resurrection because that is what jesus died for that's the hope of the gospel we shall no longer sleep but we shall be changed in a moment not thinking about this is my hope not for the pulpit but for our resurrection there is going to be a voice come down there glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus that is why in acts 2 it said therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god had made that same jesus whom you have crucified but lord and christ the devil taught together kill them and keep them down and they kill him and oh god if they never only knew what was going to happen he let jesus or die of old age but when he shed his blood in calvary the spirit life of that blood was loosed and that it was caught for the night the spirit life from that blood oh glory to god when that spirit life is loose no demon could stop you nothing present nothing to come no sickness nothing going to stop you from rising again all glory to god is easy to go along on the ground but there's something else to come back up it will take a power it will take a presence it will take a born again baptism of the holy ghost to put fire into your soul to raise you up in spirit and faith we have something to live for all you young people you have something to live for grandchildren of the night you have something to live for live for jesus hallelujah or when peter was preaching when they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter unto the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children them that are found for as many as the lord god shall call you know we have been through here repenting get baptized saving the lord don't think we don't get tired and weary and stressed no we do we do but we have a hope we have a confidence hallelujah don't feel abraham didn't have rough spots something you know the bible said he staggered not on the promise that's when god writing man to see this and see that when ghosts are the righteous right different you know yeah man here false he had mistakes had this and that and that but when god writes is something else you know i want god to write i don't want man to write when god writes in the waiver he says staggered not at the prophet no much time sarah didn't want to cook for him you know what time he wanted to get upset because the food didn't taste good but the bible said sarah abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and he was fully persuaded that what he promised and i am fully persuaded this is the hour that there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a millennium and this gray hair will go back black do i hear a man in her house do i have believers in the house or monica turner back in like a bike guy and diet but i'm talking about that transformation oh glory to god this mortal to put on immortality and this corruption to put all interruption this is our promise we shall be changed oh glory to god nobody is not dead hallelujah he is still alive that's the house he was living in oh but he gone to a better place that's the place we are going to oh let me see if i can wrap up here hallelujah hallelujah god gave her off in ezekiel 36. he said i would sprinkle clean water upon you a new heart will i give you a new spirit will i put within you i'll take away your stony heart out of your flesh i will give you heart of flesh i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them this is god's opportunity for change in your life not a belief of doctrine but change of heart change of life i'm gonna close when you die that does not change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place this is scary this is scary that doesn't change you it just changed where you are when you think about that if you're a liar here if you're crook here that will make you you're dying to get straight no you know this is the only place you'll be mortal let me repeat that here is the only place you'll be mortal here's the only place you could make things right here's the only place you could be change transformed straighten out humble stay at the cross this is the place here's the only place crossover it's too late you're set and judge according to your works [Music] hallelujah you can't give god your good works you know because the good words qualified she's not to die you have to have his life turned even inside of you so when you die it only changes houses for you if you die in your sins you go to a worse habitation of what you're living in now if you die in christ you shall be with christ for he is the way death does not change a man it changes your dwelling place when you leave this world your nature doesn't change if you're lying now you'll be a liar there if you're hotter than here you'll be hot every day if your daughter here you'll be adopted dear men and women it's time to shake yourself examine yourself see where we are standing for death does not change it that doesn't do nothing to a man but change is dwell in place it doesn't change your fate it doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so whatever way your nature is today if you're a doubt of god's word you'll be doubt over there i don't care who you are how you live how good you live it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place and if you can't accept the whole word of god the way it's written you wouldn't be there you wouldn't do it dear so don't worry you won't be there oh my let me wrap up here now sin will not go unpunished this is a result of sin the wages of sin is still dead the reason we're getting gray and old and sick and dying is because one man fell and sinned that is why when adam fell he represented all of us you say oh gosh why god could use this one man yes but when christ came he represented all of us too one man fell and we got messed up that is why we are funeral services one man came and now we could get back to where we fell from this is what the gospel is all about the gospel is not joining church the gospel is getting you back to eden oh glory to god hallelujah so watch sin must be dealt with on the basis of judgment whether it's a nation a church a home an individual there is no other way it can be attorned you say i've done wrong now i will do good that won't work you cannot make reconciliation yourself because reconciliation has already been made it's a confession that you're wrong and then come and straighten up so sin must be dealt with and god always deal with sin by judgment that's his law so when he recognized man fell he say he cast an angel to do it he came himself because judgment is what he had was to take up so calvary was the judgment he judgment of god so he accepted all judgment at calvary that we could be the escaped ones that we could go free oh colleen will you believe that praise god so what that's why our lord died the death that he didn't calvary is because that sin was such a horrible thing begin to pay some things the judgment of sin was placed on him that those who desire might go free to believing on him and accepting him as their sin bearer not how good we can be but how we believe and accept him and when we accept him he comes into our hearts oh my god made a man to tooth because he wanted to taste after him but the devil perverted it he's trying to make you think something different trying to quench that holy taste oh man finish adam and eve fell by breaking the word the day you eat there of that day you surely die you know people ever say god is a good god all the time they feel god is a grandfather you know that's what grandparents love i love my grandchildren they feel good as they're doing nice child the nice challenge even he said the day you eat thereof nice child that did you die when they fell gordon says oh god god i can't do it i can't react oh god no he didn't do that they died yes the keepers were to be god what about you today [Music] we spend all years the tale that is told this is your story right here a book some of you in the middle of the book some of
