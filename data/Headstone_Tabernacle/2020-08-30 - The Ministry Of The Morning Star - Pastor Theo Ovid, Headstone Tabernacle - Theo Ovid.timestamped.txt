[42:02] another subject overcoming
[42:05] title ministry of the morning star
[42:09] inspiration watchman word of the night
[42:12] and subject
[42:13] overcoming other context scripture i'd
[42:15] like to read from revelation chapter 22
[42:18] reading from verse 8 and i john saw
[42:21] these things and heard them
[42:23] when i heard and seen i fell down to
[42:26] worship
[42:28] before the feet of the angel which
[42:30] showed me these things
[42:32] then said he to me unto me see thou do
[42:35] it not
[42:36] for i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[42:39] virgin the prophets
[42:40] and of them which keep the scenes of
[42:42] this book
[42:44] worship god and he said unto me seal not
[42:48] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[42:51] for the time is at hand he that is
[42:54] unjust
[42:55] let them be unjust still he which is
[42:58] filthy
[42:59] let him be filthy still he that is
[43:02] righteous
[43:04] let him be righteous still and he
[43:07] that is holy let him be holy still
[43:11] this verse 11 here this time is at hand
[43:15] this is what it had to known to verse 12
[43:17] and behold i come quickly
[43:19] my reward is with me to give every man
[43:22] according as
[43:22] his work shall be not talk not
[43:26] talk as his work shall be i am alpha
[43:29] omega
[43:30] the beginning and the end the first and
[43:32] the last
[43:34] blessed are they that do his
[43:36] commandments
[43:37] that they may have right to the tree of
[43:39] life and may enter into the gates into
[43:41] the city
[43:42] forward outer dogs and sorcerers and
[43:44] humongous and murderers and idolaters
[43:46] and
[43:46] whosoever love it and make it a lie
[43:50] i jesus have sent my angel to testify
[43:53] unto you these things
[43:54] in the churches and the root and the
[43:56] offspring of david
[43:58] and the bright and morning star and the
[44:00] spirit
[44:01] and the bride say come let him that hear
[44:03] it say come
[44:05] let him that that is come and whosoever
[44:07] will
[44:08] let him take the water of life freely oh
[44:10] may god bless his word
[44:12] so we are living in such a insight in
[44:14] time and it's
[44:15] a dreadful time and it's still an
[44:18] exciting time
[44:19] because it's what we are long for what
[44:21] we're looking for
[44:22] what all the ages was looking for daniel
[44:25] was seeking to understand
[44:27] more about this day and go to daniel go
[44:29] that way the book is sealed
[44:31] till the time of the end and that book
[44:33] being sealed
[44:34] in the time of the end god meaning that
[44:36] that book will be on seal one
[44:38] and then the prophecy from that book
[44:40] must be unsealed
[44:41] and then the fulfillment of the prophecy
[44:44] that all of that has to come to take
[44:45] place
[44:46] not only the book on seal but is
[44:48] unsealing a prophecy
[44:49] and you cannot see is he still not the
[44:51] scenes of the prophecy of this book
[44:53] so gordon sent a prophet just to bring
[44:55] doctrines teachings and so on it comes
[44:57] to being a prophecy
[44:58] hallelujah i went john the baptist or
[45:01] under the anointing to introduce the
[45:02] messiah
[45:03] when jesus came into the water that very
[45:06] day it changed
[45:07] from the prophet to the prophecy and
[45:10] some point in time it has to change
[45:11] not behold i said you elijah the prophet
[45:13] but what is the prophet's prophecy
[45:15] then we could identify the prophecy for
[45:17] this hour and said this day
[45:19] this scripture is fulfilled when it
[45:21] changes
[45:22] from the prophet to the prophecy or give
[45:24] the lord some praises

[48:45] oh and to overcome there must be a test
[48:47] given give the lord a shout

[48:50] praises now remember
[48:53] each church age the one that precedes

[49:00] all the other rewards so in this age we
[49:03] inherited
[49:03] all seven rewards oh give the lord some
[49:07] praises
[49:08] watch there it is don't receive all
[49:10] these power these new names everything

[49:16] all
[49:16] oh praise god no not him that starts
[49:20] is he that finishes many start the race
[49:24] but there's only one finishing it there
[49:26] will be many churches start
[49:28] many groups of people but there will be
[49:30] one group that finish
[49:32] that's the overcomers are you belonging
[49:34] to that group do you want to be in that
[49:35] group
[49:36] oh god this happened to your family this
[49:38] happened insurance happened to your
[49:39] house it's happened to your car this
[49:40] happened to the job this happened
[49:41] whatever
[49:42] no matter what happen there's gonna be a
[49:44] bunch of overcomers because before god
[49:46] to overcome and talk he put a seed to
[49:48] overcome
[49:49] oh glory to god we believe that
[49:51] hallelujah
[49:52] now the bible talks about seven stars in
[49:54] his right hand seven churches seven
[49:56] messengers isn't that right
[49:58] and the reason that the stars is because
[50:00] it's nighttime
[50:01] he said these seven styles was to
[50:02] reflect the light of his present
[50:05] in the day in the night we are living in
[50:08] the stars reflect the sun to the earth
[50:10] to make it light so we can walk and get
[50:13] around
[50:14] night time now revelation is a book of
[50:16] symbols we understand that
[50:18] and we understand god say seven stars in
[50:20] his right hand
[50:21] and the only reason god used that
[50:23] description
[50:24] is because we are living in a night time
[50:27] in a dark time
[50:28] and isaiah 67 rise and shine for the
[50:31] light has come
[50:32] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[50:34] thee i like how god addressed the elect
[50:37] first
[50:37] and then he says behold the doctor shall
[50:40] cover the earth
[50:41] and cross darkness the people but the
[50:43] lord shall rise upon thee
[50:45] and the glory shall be seen upon me so
[50:47] he put the light has come
[50:49] the glory is risen upon thee then he
[50:51] said that discover the earth but the
[50:52] lord shall rise upon thee and his glory
[50:54] shall be seen upon thee
[50:56] so he put the impact first and then
[50:58] shall be processed
[51:00] hallelujah and you'll come back to that
[51:01] same vision that he put in representing
[51:03] in the beginning oh glory to god amen
[51:06] and i believe all this coronavirus
[51:08] darkness
[51:09] covering the earth affecting the entire
[51:11] world no country escaping
[51:12] no people escaping all glory that god is
[51:15] a prelude of what is to come
[51:16] we see clearly now how would be so very
[51:19] easy to shut down the churches
[51:20] like a blink it would happen so smooth
[51:23] hallelujah with no no hassle
[51:25] oh all this is a pre concerto what's
[51:27] coming it's
[51:28] almost like a a child run a dry run
[51:31] oh hallelujah instructions and you have
[51:34] to follow through
[51:35] and this is where it's coming to now oh
[51:37] glory to god who going to stand
[51:39] nobody watching them in the house nobody
[51:41] watching those so-called christian
[51:42] believers what they're doing where
[51:44] they're going what they're listening to
[51:45] what they're reading if they're praying
[51:47] everybody have to examine their own self
[51:49] and not be a christian in your heart in
[51:50] your own house but don't know church
[51:52] remember willing god bless you god bless
[51:54] you
[51:54] no not right now you can't shake your
[51:56] brain can get brother her kindness is a
[51:58] heart
[51:59] oh glory this how it is but the other
[52:01] side we have no virus on that side
[52:03] it's perfect love there oh my precious
[52:05] brother they hugging one another
[52:06] have no virus you can't hug you can't
[52:08] greet you can't shake hand
[52:10] no we have to abide by that because they
[52:11] said respect to no persons
[52:13] pastor prophet bishop don't care who it
[52:15] is this is respected no person if
[52:17] anybody want to challenge it let them
[52:18] feel free to do so
[52:19] but this is no reason this guy isn't
[52:21] respecting anybody but i'm telling you
[52:23] we have a promise
[52:24] that the sons of god going to come forth
[52:26] they're going to stop cancer
[52:28] stop diseases stop whatever the devil
[52:30] want to send
[52:31] do you believe that sons are coming
[52:33] hallelujah
[52:35] oh glory to god and the prophet he was
[52:38] talking about jordan he said let's cross
[52:40] the other side now
[52:41] because it all belongs to us let's quit
[52:43] playing we come along you see what
[52:45] jordan meant
[52:46] he said them visions that never fail
[52:48] they can fail
[52:49] because they come from god and i believe
[52:51] it with all my heart within me
[52:53] we are not the highland that will run
[52:55] back into the wilderness we will cross
[52:57] jordan
[52:57] the separation god break to us the seals
[53:01] that's on the back of the book let us
[53:03] enter into this place
[53:05] great place now for joshua divided to
[53:07] the people the inheritance
[53:09] so this dry run or this shadow or this
[53:12] reflection in the old testament
[53:13] was a reflection for us the dry run
[53:16] was from egypt to canaan land that was
[53:19] the journey
[53:20] that was in type that was natural that
[53:23] egypt represent the world
[53:25] and that promised land praise that
[53:27] canaan represent the promise the
[53:29] inheritance the holy ghostland itself
[53:30] isn't that right so it's three things
[53:33] moses brought the people out
[53:35] and joshua had three things to do cross
[53:37] them over jordan
[53:39] fight in the land and divide the land
[53:41] it's simple
[53:42] no complications just three things cross
[53:45] them over you can't fight
[53:46] in the land if they can cross over you
[53:48] have to get across jordan jordan
[53:50] represents debt
[53:51] so there is no debt you cannot get into
[53:53] the land
[53:54] you have to cross this thing called
[53:56] death and death go deeper than just
[53:57] saying death
[53:58] death to your torch your ideas yourself
[54:00] and things will come to kill you
[54:02] that you could cross over into the land
[54:04] when you cross over you feel oh i reach
[54:06] a reach i reach nowhere to reach a fight
[54:09] that's the part that people don't
[54:10] pre-paid for oh
[54:12] i love jesus so it is so sweet every day
[54:15] but jesus
[54:15] is sweeter than the day before you nila
[54:17] no when you're crossing the atlantic
[54:20] tights jebusites and all their nights so
[54:22] he said no watch
[54:24] he said the land was divided by
[54:26] inspiration
[54:28] and each one i'll just skip that a
[54:29] little bit now after you are in
[54:31] here we go that don't mean
[54:35] you are free from war everybody want
[54:38] peace in the valley like someday
[54:41] ain't nothing in line right now like
[54:43] someday
[54:44] there will be peace in the valley for me
[54:46] someday waiting to cross over that
[54:48] but you see here he said that don't mean
[54:50] you're free from war
[54:51] you'll still have to fight here we go
[54:53] for every inch of wrong you stand on
[54:56] that's why i said i don't entitle i'm
[54:58] not entitled to anything
[54:59] i'm entitled to fight and you are
[55:02] entitled to fight also isn't that right
[55:04] see kanan did not represent the great
[55:06] heaven because it had
[55:07] wars and troubles and titans and
[55:09] killings and so forth
[55:11] but it did represent this it must be
[55:14] a perfect walk oh glory to god
[55:17] then he said how can i overcome is i
[55:19] choose this because i think
[55:21] it's time we should never let the spirit
[55:24] of revival die
[55:25] never somebody shout out never in your
[55:28] house you'll never
[55:30] never let the spirit revival die well we
[55:32] don't see it so
[55:34] and we have it so no never let the
[55:36] spirit of revival whether you're talking
[55:38] soft or easy whether you jump for your
[55:40] shelter you sit down you have to have
[55:42] the spirit
[55:42] of revival oh glory to god you said no
[55:46] he said i choose this right never let
[55:48] the spirit rival die because we have got
[55:50] to keep in revival
[55:51] constantly revive every day
[55:54] paul said i die daily that christ should
[55:57] live
[55:57] and we must never let that revival die
[56:00] within us
[56:02] now we are speaking on overcoming and
[56:04] the world overcome of course you know
[56:05] what it means
[56:06] you have to have something to overcome
[56:08] and this church
[56:09] is that the holy spirit was speaking
[56:10] about here at the laureate church age
[56:13] as we have seen through it needs a
[56:15] rebuking allowed israel to be rebuked
[56:17] because of his
[56:17] indifference towards christ they put
[56:19] christ outside now notice
[56:21] his call here is not just to the church
[56:24] he didn't overcome it not the church
[56:26] that would be she the church body it's
[56:29] not he
[56:30] is he that overcome it the individual so
[56:33] you cast out no bunch no group
[56:35] no group at all is he that overcome it
[56:38] bunch a group a bunch of church members
[56:39] they
[56:39] like them or you are individual
[56:42] you have to fight for your portion oh
[56:45] glory to god enoch didn't take his rifle
[56:47] domino
[56:48] he walked with god you know and god took
[56:50] him you know
[56:51] he couldn't take your wife and cheering
[56:52] you know you have to walk with god
[56:54] wait and get translation fate isn't that
[56:56] right hallelujah praise god
[56:58] so it's not group that overcome it is he
[57:01] that overcome it
[57:02] the individual that will overcome some
[57:05] point in time this message was zoning on
[57:07] individuals
[57:08] and all this bunch of church walls and
[57:10] church group thing
[57:11] and all this group thing that ministers
[57:13] trapped the people inside going to
[57:15] bust that down and when the believers
[57:17] the elect begin to recognize
[57:18] it as individuals they're going to
[57:20] something going to change altogether
[57:22] it will be radical it will be completely
[57:24] different oh glory to god
[57:26] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[57:29] now let's continue and the laodicea the
[57:32] age need a sharp rebuke
[57:33] when our killer she gets so soft and
[57:35] dirty like some grandfather is
[57:37] grandchildren
[57:38] god such a good god until they will try
[57:40] to make god a big dorky grandfather
[57:43] but he is not he's a father of
[57:45] righteousness
[57:46] of correction and love is always
[57:49] corrective love corrects
[57:50] no matter how bad it hurts it still
[57:52] corrects a mother will cross her child
[57:55] oh my they come to a place is real
[57:57] rotten and dirty
[57:58] and that's the way christians are
[57:59] becoming they have been dead in season
[58:01] and trespasses so long
[58:03] till they become dirty they can't hold
[58:04] no wait at all
[58:06] they don't know what overcoming means
[58:10] overcome keeps life in you you can't
[58:12] just have life overcoming that's why
[58:14] when you trip over something
[58:15] when you come alive you have this child
[58:18] this temptation
[58:19] this test is given to press it throw you
[58:21] on your knees
[58:22] it puts you in a desperation it actually
[58:24] keeps life
[58:25] in you what does overcoming does
[58:28] oh glory to god overcoming keeps life in
[58:32] you
[58:32] so if you're drying up and you're dying
[58:34] up you're not overcoming you have to
[58:36] overcome to keep life in you
[58:38] oh hallelujah praise god overcome and
[58:41] keep life in you
[58:42] and when life went out that is what
[58:44] brought the lord to that condition
[58:46] the lord rotten and duty because it had
[58:48] no life in it
[58:51] so afterwards all them bugs all them two
[58:54] mites
[58:55] hallelujah start a bite of them that log
[58:58] it once had life
[59:00] it once was standing tall but it fall to
[59:02] the side

[59:06] sometimes they're dead and they're still
[59:07] reading books sometimes but they're dead
[59:09] because life left you have to get back
[59:11] life he said come that you might have
[59:13] life
[59:14] oh hallelujah praise god oh my and when
[59:17] you take a christian that's supposed to
[59:19] be a christian
[59:20] let the life of god go from him and the
[59:22] experience the joy of serving christ
[59:25] and living in a church where such is
[59:27] going on he rotten twice as quick

[1:00:16] the message of the hour oh this is
[1:00:19] probably
[1:00:20] now or at least this part of the message
[1:00:24] we should live constantly in the life of
[1:00:27] christ
[1:00:28] because if you don't you layer wrong
[1:00:31] that and you know these things that
[1:00:33] you're supposed to do and don't do it
[1:00:34] the bible said he that know what to do
[1:00:36] good

[1:00:48] the loud recent churches is the grandest
[1:00:51] of

[1:00:54] because it is ending of time
[1:00:58] and blending into eternity now i know
[1:01:00] that kind of hard
[1:01:02] for some people because we live in this
[1:01:04] modern age where we're looking for
[1:01:06] things and life and opportunity but
[1:01:09] friends
[1:01:11] this age is the greatest age because
[1:01:13] this is end in time
[1:01:15] and blending into eternity and here why
[1:01:18] now
[1:01:19] and it's the greatest sinful age
[1:01:22] it's more sin in this age than they've
[1:01:24] ever been
[1:01:26] and the powers of satan
[1:01:29] is many times harder to fight against
[1:01:33] than in any other age
[1:01:36] so you know what it is to break past the
[1:01:38] raised hands and praise god
[1:01:40] you realize how people perish not
[1:01:43] literally
[1:01:43] but the handguard liver they multi give
[1:01:46] god praise
[1:01:47] they can't shout they can't worship no
[1:01:49] joy they're surviving and the holy oh my
[1:01:52] because the devil
[1:01:53] is hard so you better thank god for the
[1:01:56] grace upon your life
[1:01:58] thank god for the spirit of god upon
[1:02:00] your life because he put that dear
[1:02:02] he put praises in your heart a shout in
[1:02:04] your soul and people can't understand
[1:02:06] how you're still on fire
[1:02:07] oh glory to god you're still serving god
[1:02:10] you're still standing hallelujah praise
[1:02:12] god
[1:02:13] hallelujah and the powers of satan is
[1:02:16] many times harder to fight
[1:02:17] against than in any other age back then
[1:02:19] an early age a christian could for his
[1:02:21] profession
[1:02:22] belonging to christ could be headed for
[1:02:24] it or be killed
[1:02:25] but and put out of his ministry and go
[1:02:27] to migo quickly
[1:02:29] this is the age of life personal life
[1:02:33] of christ we find here
[1:02:36] that god has always had overcomers he
[1:02:39] had overcomers in every
[1:02:40] always every time in every age there has
[1:02:43] been an earth god has
[1:02:44] always had somebody he could put his
[1:02:46] hands on
[1:02:47] as a witness in the earth he's never
[1:02:50] been without a witness
[1:02:51] though sometimes just one but somebody
[1:02:54] overcome
[1:02:55] nor is there eight people overcome
[1:02:58] genuine overcomers noah
[1:03:00] three sons their wives noah and his wife
[1:03:03] hallelujah and that act he said was not
[1:03:05] a denomination
[1:03:07] he says by one spirit we are all
[1:03:08] baptized into one body
[1:03:10] and in the domain of the kingdom of god
[1:03:13] by one spiritual baptism
[1:03:15] i know that is not emphasized because
[1:03:17] people join in church in this message
[1:03:19] but by one spirit we are genuinely
[1:03:21] baptized into the body
[1:03:23] and when god puts you into the body
[1:03:25] there is no pastor bishop
[1:03:27] deacon apostle prophet could pull you
[1:03:29] out
[1:03:30] they could talk they talk but the couple
[1:03:32] you're out because his spirit put you
[1:03:33] inside the deal
[1:03:34] oh glory to god place you inside the
[1:03:36] deer oh glory to god i met god placed no
[1:03:39] man could unplease
[1:03:40] no man could play saying he'll take god
[1:03:42] to put you inside of there in the body
[1:03:44] isn't that right
[1:03:45] no matter how good how bad whatever you
[1:03:47] are in the kingdom by the holy ghost
[1:03:49] baptism
[1:03:50] that's the only way you overcome is all
[1:03:52] that is under the
[1:03:53] shed blood is overcomers because you
[1:03:55] cannot overcome yourself
[1:03:57] it is he that overcomes for you you are
[1:03:59] resting
[1:04:00] how will i know then brother branham
[1:04:02] that i'm in there watch what kind of
[1:04:03] life you're living
[1:04:04] just look around see if it just lived
[1:04:07] out of you automatically
[1:04:08] or you have to strain and pull then you
[1:04:10] are doing it but don't try to do it
[1:04:12] did you ever try okay the thing you have
[1:04:14] to overcome
[1:04:15] is yourself your ideas your thing
[1:04:18] surrender yourself to him he overcome
[1:04:20] for you he knows the way
[1:04:22] we don't in the days of daniel for
[1:04:24] overcome us we know them
[1:04:26] she can bend they go and danielle isn't
[1:04:28] that right now we are expected to be
[1:04:30] tested that's a good lesson
[1:04:32] he said he that committed god must first
[1:04:34] be tested tested
[1:04:35] that's god's test he said and then do
[1:04:38] you believe it the coronation said yes
[1:04:40] he said coming to god must be tested and
[1:04:42] he only
[1:04:43] shows a true child is when you are
[1:04:45] tested when the test comes on you
[1:04:47] so singing specials and singing someone
[1:04:49] clapping your hand and singing whatever
[1:04:50] it is and
[1:04:51] saying amen hallelujah and shaking you
[1:04:52] pass a hand that looks nice and so on
[1:04:54] but he's
[1:04:55] proof he's a child when he has come not
[1:04:57] been everybody in the choir and
[1:04:58] everybody's singing and everybody saying
[1:05:00] hallelujah and
[1:05:01] greeting one another and fellowshipping
[1:05:02] and whatnot when the tests come
[1:05:04] how you respond to that test isn't that
[1:05:07] right
[1:05:08] and that only shows that your child when
[1:05:11] you are
[1:05:11] tested and when the test comes on you
[1:05:14] can't overcome unless there's a test
[1:05:16] given to you
[1:05:16] you can't overcome unless it's a test
[1:05:19] given to you let me say it again you
[1:05:20] cannot overcome unless it's a test given
[1:05:23] to you oh glory to god a test given to
[1:05:26] you not to us to you
[1:05:28] it's your test it's a personal test no
[1:05:30] no general test it's your test
[1:05:32] oh glory to god your test customized for
[1:05:34] you
[1:05:35] you can't pick your tests you can't take
[1:05:37] your paper and
[1:05:38] take a peek the test coming for you
[1:05:40] sorry to rejoice right now it's not a
[1:05:42] thank god for right now
[1:05:43] because you accounted worthy to receive
[1:05:45] tests oh hallelujah praise god
[1:05:48] you can overcome this is the test given
[1:05:49] to you and when the test is given is to
[1:05:51] see
[1:05:52] whether you can overcome or not it has
[1:05:55] no in between
[1:05:56] you can't be halfway there is that they
[1:05:58] overcome it or yeah overcome it
[1:06:01] i never said that before it's a new one
[1:06:03] no in between
[1:06:05] is that they overcome it or yeah
[1:06:06] overcome it if you haven't overcome it
[1:06:08] it's just coming again
[1:06:10] hallelujah praise god amen so jesus said
[1:06:13] to him not overcome it the test
[1:06:15] here we go it's the greatest thing that
[1:06:18] ever happened to you
[1:06:20] my lord praise god
[1:06:23] the test we are being tested
[1:06:26] i am being tested we have to be tested
[1:06:28] oh glory to god i'm preaching and
[1:06:30] there's no it's empty seas here
[1:06:33] and i'm preaching as if praise god is
[1:06:35] remind me what is it

[1:06:49] hundred people
[1:06:50] it's just the word of god isn't that
[1:06:51] right so the test
[1:06:53] is the greatest thing that ever happened
[1:06:56] to you
[1:06:56] i believe it is written in the scripture
[1:06:58] peter said our trials are worth
[1:07:00] more to us than precious gold it's a
[1:07:03] test and
[1:07:03] time it's one good evidence to
[1:07:06] us that god is with us when we are
[1:07:09] tested
[1:07:10] not blessed i know that's not a word
[1:07:13] that will be blessed
[1:07:14] but when we endure in the test it's a
[1:07:17] sign that god is with you this happened
[1:07:20] this happened
[1:07:20] god just happened when you're taught you
[1:07:22] escape look something is happening here
[1:07:24] and you want to know what happened
[1:07:26] nothing happened wrong it's working out
[1:07:28] right

[1:07:31] reason negative victory
[1:07:33] and the more you overcome he takes it to
[1:07:35] the next level hallelujah you overcome
[1:07:37] that you take it to the next level
[1:07:38] and you overcome that you're taking it

[1:07:56] that right
[1:07:57] praise gosh is a testament time it's one
[1:07:59] good evidence to us
[1:08:01] that god is with us when we are tested
[1:08:03] for all
[1:08:04] all children of god are tested and tried
[1:08:09] oh praise god lot wife she started off
[1:08:12] as an overcomer but she never did
[1:08:14] overcome isn't that right
[1:08:16] we know a heart a heart turn in her
[1:08:18] isn't that right she let her heart
[1:08:20] influence her to look back she started
[1:08:22] off
[1:08:23] many start but remember who finishing oh
[1:08:26] glory to god don't just start
[1:08:29] finish this race i intend to finish by
[1:08:31] god's grace
[1:08:33] oh glory to god my what about the
[1:08:35] children of israel in egypt
[1:08:36] they started off they saw miracles but
[1:08:39] bahram says it wasn't in their heart
[1:08:41] they
[1:08:41] didn't overcome the perish in the
[1:08:44] wilderness
[1:08:45] who overcame joshua and caleb they say
[1:08:47] we are more than able to do it
[1:08:49] they were overcomers bunch of ministers
[1:08:52] all in the association a bunch of men
[1:08:54] behind a pulpit
[1:08:55] and just just one kill example you're
[1:08:57] more than able to take this coronal
[1:08:59] virus on the coronavirus
[1:09:00] are you okay what press they have out
[1:09:02] there i don't want tests i don't care
[1:09:03] what room doing out there rumored to do
[1:09:05] the business but we ought to do we
[1:09:06] business too
[1:09:07] oh glory to god gross darkness cover the
[1:09:09] earth and gross darkness covering what
[1:09:11] the people
[1:09:12] but praise god god said that light could
[1:09:14] shine and rise upon you
[1:09:15] or could somebody say amen here this
[1:09:17] morning oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:09:20] praise god so they killed joshua and
[1:09:22] caleb they were the privileged ones
[1:09:24] hallelujah out of the entire generation
[1:09:26] they were the privileged ones
[1:09:28] they were the elected bride that was
[1:09:30] called over in the promised land
[1:09:32] joshua and kayla they were on the front
[1:09:34] line isn't that right
[1:09:35] and jesus gave us the example how to
[1:09:37] overcome what did he do
[1:09:39] humility he gird himself with a towel
[1:09:41] the very god of heaven
[1:09:43] humiliated himself we don't want
[1:09:46] to be humiliated so we stand in
[1:09:48] arrogance we stand in attitudes
[1:09:50] we stand in our way where we hold our
[1:09:52] ground we don't want to say we're sorry
[1:09:53] we don't want to cry
[1:09:55] we don't want to oh men don't cry
[1:10:05] you're crying because you have a heart
[1:10:07] cause something moving in your spirit in
[1:10:09] your soul
[1:10:10] and you could ask god hallelujah so
[1:10:12] jesus gave us that example
[1:10:14] jesus told us how to do with humility
[1:10:16] isn't that right we don't want to be
[1:10:18] humiliated and that's the reason women
[1:10:20] don't want their hair to grow out
[1:10:21] the reason they don't want to dress like
[1:10:22] they should dress men don't want to it's
[1:10:24] the same thing
[1:10:25] they get humiliated but jesus constantly
[1:10:28] he was greatness i want to say something
[1:10:30] greatness humiliates itself great
[1:10:33] humbles itself greatness is humility or
[1:10:36] praise
[1:10:36] people don't want to say i am wrong
[1:10:39] people want to say
[1:10:40] i'm sorry people don't want to say
[1:10:42] forgive me
[1:10:43] and faith is based on forgiveness
[1:10:47] you can't get very far because all
[1:10:49] things of god is of faith
[1:10:50] it's not a material it are people with
[1:10:52] money and they consider life
[1:10:54] messed up because money doesn't give
[1:10:56] character money doesn't change people
[1:10:59] sometimes it's not even further away
[1:11:02] because they feel they don't need need
[1:11:03] god
[1:11:04] they're too rich to call upon god they
[1:11:06] have nothing they have no needs
[1:11:08] because they could get and purchase and
[1:11:10] buy whatever they want to get
[1:11:12] but somehow the grim reporters come and
[1:11:14] look at them
[1:11:15] and they can't pay off the grim reaper
[1:11:17] they can't bribe the grim reaper
[1:11:19] when the grim reaper come they can't say
[1:11:20] hold that all a billion
[1:11:23] green people say no i i know my currency
[1:11:26] i can't buy nothing with that keep your
[1:11:28] billions for yourself i come for you
[1:11:30] tonight
[1:11:30] the man said he gonna build bands and
[1:11:33] expand his business and do that
[1:11:35] and they'll say though fool tonight your
[1:11:37] soul is required of the
[1:11:38] oh glory to god even so come lord jesus
[1:11:41] come we don't belong here

[1:11:46] christian

[1:11:49] my life
[1:11:49] so grateful for the blood of jesus and
[1:11:51] the cross at calvary where you pay the
[1:11:53] price

[1:11:57] money or no money house or no house
[1:11:59] landlord land it doesn't matter
[1:12:01] oh tastes so sweet to trust in jesus
[1:12:04] especially in an hour like this
[1:12:06] when the whole world is being tested
[1:12:08] when governments are being rocked and
[1:12:10] shaken
[1:12:10] when men had failing for fear they don't
[1:12:12] know what happened
[1:12:13] or what's going to take place they don't
[1:12:15] have the answer but there's a bride on
[1:12:17] the earth who have the answer
[1:12:19] because darkness is covering the earth
[1:12:21] darkness is present more glory to
[1:12:23] god hallelujah it is nighttime
[1:12:27] oh glory to god you heard what i said it
[1:12:29] is night time and
[1:12:30] god sends some stars to point us to show
[1:12:33] us the way
[1:12:34] that we could know to make them steps
[1:12:36] and he said to him that overcome it i
[1:12:38] will give the morning star
[1:12:39] or give the lord a shout in the house
[1:12:42] hallelujah and that morning star is a
[1:12:43] testimony
[1:12:44] that the sun is coming or glory to when
[1:12:47] that morning star only comes out when it
[1:12:49] is dark or give the lord a shout

[1:12:54] dark when men are feeling so fear
[1:12:56] when all kind of things has taken place

[1:19:51] overcome you must
[1:19:52] recognize that the god in you is greater
[1:19:55] and mightier than he is

[1:31:47] hallelujah this whole man
[1:31:50] seven seals seven spirits seven angels
[1:31:54] seven horns seven church ages his seven
[1:31:58] messengers men his seven spirits of god
[1:32:02] the seven plan caesar redemption he said
[1:32:05] the seven horns mean seven ages
[1:32:07] daniel saw the horn mean kingdom and
[1:32:09] jesus said
[1:32:10] some fell asleep in the first watch
[1:32:12] another age another one
[1:32:13] next watch next age next one plum after
[1:32:15] the seven watch
[1:32:16] under the seven watch is when the bride
[1:32:18] gone come then all of them is awakened
[1:32:20] isn't that right
[1:32:21] and the seven ages were the seven horns
[1:32:23] and the seven churches of seven
[1:32:25] dispensations of the body of believers
[1:32:27] like that
[1:32:27] seven dispensations of the body of
[1:32:30] believers
[1:32:31] so when you talk about jesus bride
[1:32:33] you're not talking about this entire
[1:32:34] people here you know
[1:32:35] you talk about the bright from the very
[1:32:36] beginning we are just the last part of
[1:32:38] this bride oh glory to god

[1:32:43] bright body this is brought at the
[1:32:44] bottom and
[1:32:44] narrows to the top is already made up
[1:32:47] it's just the final names
[1:32:49] to be called because this is the call
[1:32:51] for manifestation
[1:32:52] and to call the manifestation it has to
[1:32:54] be called to the full word
[1:32:55] so the fullness of the word had to come
[1:32:57] to bring back luke 17 30 suddenly
[1:32:59] to come to bring full seed back like in
[1:33:02] the beginning
[1:33:03] alpha bride that there will be a
[1:33:05] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:33:07] because peace and they were manifested
[1:33:08] sons but the time of the rapture was not
[1:33:10] yet
[1:33:10] so they couldn't be changed that the way
[1:33:12] to go down in the ground
[1:33:14] but we are here we are in the time to be
[1:33:16] changed the time is at hand
[1:33:18] in that filthy filthy still righteous
[1:33:20] still holy still
[1:33:21] and manifestations manifested still oh
[1:33:24] glory to god god changes mind god cannot
[1:33:26] change his mind

[1:33:28] circumstance could their name be taken
[1:33:30] out
[1:33:30] oh give the lord a shout oh under no
[1:33:33] circumstance could their name be taken

[1:33:58] brother knew that
[1:34:00] the seventh seal when i pulled it back

[1:34:09] the seventh and last one of these seals
[1:34:14] when they are opened is phone in version
[1:34:18] 10th chapter
[1:34:19] so the satan in his balcony watching he
[1:34:21] sees open one two three
[1:34:22] following and following fallen god put
[1:34:25] four anointings
[1:34:27] to guard and blind them lion anointing
[1:34:31] ox anointing
[1:34:32] man anointed eagle anointing and hiding
[1:34:35] messengers under that anointing
[1:34:36] so you only see in white horse people

[1:34:40] silence he can't understand what
[1:34:41] happening
[1:34:41] gun russian telling you coming already
[1:34:45] so when you're looking for things in
[1:34:46] heaven you're looking for things looking
[1:34:47] deep in
[1:34:48] silence but i saw another might come
[1:34:50] from heaven and all something that's
[1:34:52] wrong never can hold that
[1:34:53] you know what he's done this is he said
[1:34:54] it's impossible for him to know anything
[1:34:56] about it
[1:34:57] he clueless something doesn't roar out
[1:34:59] tonight for the bride
[1:35:00] exclusive promise guys it'll break
[1:35:02] together give the bright fate show how
[1:35:04] to prepare
[1:35:04] wait till them seven thunders are the
[1:35:06] voices to that group
[1:35:09] we're not over emphasizing these things
[1:35:10] you know these are the promises these
[1:35:12] are the prophecies he says seal not the
[1:35:14] sayings of the prophecy of this book i
[1:35:16] am still on the prophecy and the
[1:35:18] prophecy didn't come
[1:35:19] by men as men moved by the holy ghost
[1:35:22] we have a sword hallelujah
[1:35:25] we have a sword of prophecy today
[1:35:28] oh glory to god hang in there until that
[1:35:31] day start
[1:35:32] a rise in your heart oh glory to god
[1:35:35] because that star is going to arise in
[1:35:36] your heart
[1:35:37] that taste of christ oh give the lord a
[1:35:40] shout oh hallelujah
[1:35:42] praise the name of the lord thank you
[1:35:44] lord jesus thank you lord jesus
[1:35:47] oh my hallelujah who was despite that
[1:35:51] they are small things
[1:35:52] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:35:54] plummets in the hand of the rubber bell
[1:35:56] with those seven they are the eyes of
[1:35:57] the lord it is very evident
[1:35:59] that the word they refers to men thus we
[1:36:02] see
[1:36:03] that the eyes of the lord in this
[1:36:04] instance are men
[1:36:06] of course they will be anointed men full
[1:36:08] of the holy ghost for god's ministries
[1:36:11] and not in the power of men but of the
[1:36:13] holy ghost putting out scriptural
[1:36:15] discoveries together
[1:36:16] it is evident that the seven spirits of
[1:36:18] god
[1:36:19] referred to is the continuous ministry
[1:36:23] of the same holy spirit in the lives of
[1:36:26] seven men with whom god identifies
[1:36:28] themselves
[1:36:28] very closely
[1:36:32] so i don't take the words from malachi
[1:36:34] for prophet lightly
[1:36:36] and i examine any man what he say by
[1:36:38] what the prophet said and what the
[1:36:40] scriptures say
[1:36:41] because when the angel came to the
[1:36:43] prophet he examined what the angels said
[1:36:44] by the scriptures
[1:36:46] that's the only way you could know is
[1:36:48] the angel from god
[1:36:49] you can't leave the world
[1:36:53] that's why disney state had writings on
[1:36:55] the back side of the book it just says
[1:36:57] seals
[1:36:58] it was written in the book it had
[1:36:59] written in the book but the backside was
[1:37:01] just sealed
[1:37:02] with seven seals he said you cannot put
[1:37:04] things outside because that would be
[1:37:05] outside the word
[1:37:06] it was sealed on the back of the book
[1:37:08] and the seals on the back
[1:37:10] held the contents of what was inside
[1:37:12] you'll need to break the seals in the
[1:37:13] back to see what's on the inside
[1:37:15] all seven had a break to reveal the
[1:37:17] entire book
[1:37:18] and the entire book was the book of
[1:37:20] names that's why we hear this morning
[1:37:22] oh glory to god on one day will be set
[1:37:24] in the book of life
[1:37:25] and go go send a baptism of fire oh
[1:37:27] glory to god set in the book of life
[1:37:30] oh jesus i come as it is written of me
[1:37:33] in the volume of the book
[1:37:35] oh this is the book of god he can't
[1:37:37] break his own law
[1:37:38] he he operates within his own law oh
[1:37:40] hallelujah i come as is written of me
[1:37:43] in the volume of the book oh glory to
[1:37:45] god no wonder why the psalmist said thy
[1:37:47] word
[1:37:48] is a lamp unto my feet and the light
[1:37:50] unto my part
[1:37:51] oh glory to god thy word is a lamp under
[1:37:54] my feet
[1:37:55] oh but that lamp had to send light that
[1:37:57] you could know how to walk in this hour
[1:37:59] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:38:01] lord press that be the name of the lord
[1:38:04] we find out those colors and show each
[1:38:06] one of those colors
[1:38:08] represents god's purity those colors
[1:38:10] they're seven
[1:38:11] natural colors isn't that right and they
[1:38:13] represent what the motives of god
[1:38:16] the attitude of god these seven colors
[1:38:18] represented seven churches
[1:38:20] seven stars seven angels these colors
[1:38:24] represent the motive of god
[1:38:25] so when a man have those colors in him
[1:38:27] you have the motive of god the objective
[1:38:29] of god
[1:38:30] the attitude of god oh hallelujah
[1:38:33] oh glory to god because that is what
[1:38:35] these colors represent
[1:38:36] you don't have the ocean you have a
[1:38:37] little piece of the ocean you have a
[1:38:39] little dip you have a little spoonful of
[1:38:40] the ocean
[1:38:41] but the contents of that spoon is what
[1:38:43] is inside the ocean oh give the lord
[1:38:44] some praises
[1:38:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:50] then he said it might be closer than you
[1:38:51] think it's got me scared
[1:38:53] i haven't done enough where are we at
[1:38:55] time shall be no more
[1:38:56] he notices that time is over what
[1:38:58] happens what happens could that be so
[1:38:59] much brethren seriously think
[1:39:00] if it is then the pyramid is kept by the
[1:39:03] seven thunders
[1:39:05] devil can't go there he can't touch that
[1:39:07] listen he can't touch that pyramid
[1:39:09] he can't go near there the perimeter is
[1:39:11] capped by the seventh house he don't
[1:39:12] want the bride to see that the period is
[1:39:14] cap
[1:39:14] that means the seven thunders is the
[1:39:15] capstone itself in revelation and
[1:39:18] manifestation
[1:39:18] so for years we're preaching revelation
[1:39:20] but they have to come into our
[1:39:21] manifestation
[1:39:22] oh hallelujah praise god what was jesus
[1:39:25] the revelation
[1:39:26] of god and he was the manifestation of
[1:39:28] god actually he's the mystery of god
[1:39:29] revealed
[1:39:30] hallelujah god could reveal himself by
[1:39:32] the word or goku revealed himself by
[1:39:34] flesh god gave yourself in power that's
[1:39:36] how he reveals himself
[1:39:38] oh heart right now he's revealed by his
[1:39:39] word but he also reveals have the power
[1:39:41] even paul said the word that i speak is
[1:39:43] in power the kingdom is not in word only
[1:39:45] but in power so you get the word of the
[1:39:47] kingdom and the power of the kingdom
[1:39:48] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:39:51] praise god so then he promised
[1:39:53] in the last days they'll have former
[1:39:55] un-later in oh glory to god reigning the
[1:39:57] fallen hard wrong
[1:39:58] reign have to fall because that's seed
[1:40:00] in the ground oh give the lord a shout
[1:40:02] we are god's seed on the cross
[1:40:04] hidden in loud we share darkness oh
[1:40:07] glory to
[1:40:08] god there was darkness covered the earth
[1:40:10] and god

[1:40:14] a shout
[1:40:15] go glory to god i'm getting excited
[1:40:18] hallelujah
[1:40:19] so we were on the ground we are on the
[1:40:21] ground right now in the darkness of this
[1:40:23] world
[1:40:24] the enemy looking like if there's
[1:40:25] another church i have another message
[1:40:27] amen rambling books and things and
[1:40:29] fighting one another
[1:40:30] hallelujah not me i don't understand at
[1:40:32] all hallelujah no i would say no church
[1:40:34] is my enemy nobody's my enemy they're on
[1:40:36] their own
[1:40:36] who want to fight up with me they're on
[1:40:38] their own i don't know why we're nobody
[1:40:40] i have some promises to wrestle with and
[1:40:42] some things to get
[1:40:43] he said every place you put your foot is
[1:40:45] yours hallelujah and i put in my face
[1:40:48] by foot today on the ministry of the
[1:40:51] morning star
[1:40:52] and that's only for overcomers oh
[1:40:54] hallelujah there's not a hand in
[1:40:56] ministry
[1:40:56] that's not going on brand and get a
[1:40:58] printout in a cardboard ministry at this
[1:40:59] ministry and that ministry no this is
[1:41:01] christ ministry
[1:41:02] administrative monster you shall be get
[1:41:04] that you shall be given that
[1:41:06] or to him that overcome it oh hallelujah
[1:41:09] remember the pyramid message it's the
[1:41:11] capstone what did it do
[1:41:13] the holy spirit capped off the
[1:41:15] individual and sealed it
[1:41:17] when walking slow wrong this one
[1:41:21] when we added to our fate all seven
[1:41:24] things
[1:41:25] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:41:27] gottenness
[1:41:28] brotherly chemist and the seventh one
[1:41:31] was love
[1:41:32] so two faith at certain things which is
[1:41:35] god that is how he makes the individual
[1:41:41] and caps him and seals him
[1:41:44] with the holy spirit then if that be so
[1:41:48] with all these types and shadows if that
[1:41:50] be so what this man have
[1:41:52] he has got seven two changes that he has
[1:41:54] seven mysteries
[1:41:55] that have been sounded away and they
[1:41:57] fought for to bring back and now the
[1:41:59] heads don't come to cap that off does
[1:42:00] the thunders mean that my brethren
[1:42:02] hallelujah people are still fighting up
[1:42:05] if they don't necessarily mean that
[1:42:07] hallelujah so here how is important
[1:42:11] where we head into with this ministry of
[1:42:14] the morning star
[1:42:15] this is by the brown notice lutheran
[1:42:18] justification wesley signification
[1:42:20] he said no pentecost to the battle of
[1:42:22] the ghost the church goes right on to
[1:42:24] the
[1:42:25] end of it right out at the end of that
[1:42:28] here we go that church is going to
[1:42:31] have to be so perfectly like
[1:42:35] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:42:38] till when that stone come it will sit
[1:42:42] right smack in the groove
[1:42:46] here say an advanced pentecostal church
[1:42:50] that's not what he messages he said
[1:42:52] looter wesley pentecost
[1:42:55] it have to go further than to be like
[1:42:58] the ministry of jesus christ what for
[1:43:01] when the stone come
[1:43:02] he's gonna set in a groove he said now
[1:43:05] watch
[1:43:06] he said no there wasn't spirit filled
[1:43:08] but they were
[1:43:09] loyal and held to the creed of their
[1:43:12] leaders
[1:43:13] so the leaders were bringing the
[1:43:14] revelation and they're breaking the
[1:43:16] mysteries
[1:43:17] now his ministry this is jesus ministry
[1:43:19] now
[1:43:20] was showing up their doctrine
[1:43:23] he said i want you to be listen to this
[1:43:26] i want you to be sure to get this
[1:43:28] they had their cretes and they were
[1:43:31] great churches
[1:43:32] great people great men holy men
[1:43:36] good men gentlemen fine men
[1:43:39] honorable men men of honor educated
[1:43:42] smart
[1:43:42] is that right we all know that just as
[1:43:46] good as you could find anywhere
[1:43:47] but when jesus come on his ministry
[1:43:51] showed up their doctrine because
[1:43:55] god was proven by the ministry of jesus
[1:43:58] christ
[1:43:58] that he was with him oh glory to god
[1:44:02] isn't that beautiful oh my
[1:44:05] so when this ministry of jesus christ
[1:44:08] become to be
[1:44:09] manifested or let's say born into
[1:44:12] manifestation
[1:44:14] it will show up the doctrine of those
[1:44:16] who are on the letter of the word
[1:44:18] and teaching all kind of stuff he said
[1:44:20] we see the evening lights
[1:44:22] coming the holy spirit coming in so
[1:44:24] strong
[1:44:25] in upon his church here we go listen to
[1:44:28] these words now let's take it slow right
[1:44:30] here
[1:44:30] he said we see the even like coming the
[1:44:32] holy spirit coming in so strong
[1:44:35] in this church till the ministry of
[1:44:38] jesus christ
[1:44:39] is among all of his people they
[1:44:42] sat there with faith bringing him down
[1:44:46] powers and gifts working among them
[1:44:49] speaking with tongues
[1:44:50] interpretation of tongues and signs and
[1:44:53] wonders
[1:44:54] and miracles what is it christ
[1:44:57] among his church getting ready to take
[1:45:00] up
[1:45:01] preach a message to those who love his
[1:45:03] appearance christ
[1:45:05] appearing among his people before he is
[1:45:07] coming
[1:45:08] oh hallelujah we know the bible speaking
[1:45:11] of appearing
[1:45:12] before coming there's a great difference
[1:45:13] between word appearance and then coming
[1:45:15] he's praying and father we realize
[1:45:19] that the church has come through the
[1:45:20] stage of justification
[1:45:22] come to the stage of sanctification come
[1:45:24] to the stage of receiving the holy
[1:45:25] spirit
[1:45:26] the stones are being honed on
[1:45:30] for the fitting of the ministry of jesus
[1:45:33] christ
[1:45:33] i know some ministers fight me on that
[1:45:35] but this is it right here
[1:45:37] the stones are being what honed on
[1:45:40] for the fitting of the ministry so this
[1:45:43] is a different level together they're
[1:45:44] not having church and
[1:45:46] pastor and you're preaching and you're
[1:45:47] preaching long trying to work with the
[1:45:49] people

[1:45:50] know this is our life being crushed and
[1:45:52] bruised and harnessed and
[1:45:54] shaped to fit into the ministry of jesus
[1:45:57] christ
[1:45:58] to blend right in to take the church we
[1:46:00] thank thee father

[1:46:43] office some evangelist some pastors some
[1:46:45] teachers
[1:46:46] for the perfection of the saints does it
[1:46:47] read like that the perfection of what
[1:46:49] who are the saints the sanctified ones
[1:46:51] the ones from down here perfection of
[1:46:53] the saints for the work of the ministry
[1:46:56] and then he says the ministry of jesus

[1:47:01] work of the ministry is that my ministry
[1:47:03] is a ministry
[1:47:04] of jesus christ oh my ezekiel 3
[1:47:08] verse 17 says son of man i have made
[1:47:11] thee a watchman
[1:47:13] unto the house of israel therefore hear
[1:47:16] the word at my mouth
[1:47:18] and give them warning from me when i say
[1:47:21] unto the wicked thou shall surely die
[1:47:23] and thou give us not warning nor
[1:47:25] speakers to warn the wicked
[1:47:27] from his wicked way to save his life the
[1:47:30] same wicked man shall
[1:47:31] die in his iniquity but his blood will
[1:47:34] require thy hand
[1:47:36] yet if the war on the wicked and he
[1:47:37] turned not from his wickedness
[1:47:39] nor from his wicked way he shall die in
[1:47:41] his iniquity
[1:47:42] but thou has delivered thy soul again
[1:47:46] when a righteous man deterred from his
[1:47:48] righteousness and commit iniquity
[1:47:51] and i lay a stumbling block before him
[1:47:52] and he shall die because thou has not
[1:47:54] given him
[1:47:55] warning he shall die in his sin
[1:47:59] and his righteousness which he had done
[1:48:01] shall not be remembered but his blood
[1:48:02] will require at the hand
[1:48:04] nevertheless if the war on the righteous
[1:48:07] man
[1:48:07] that the righteous sin not and he does
[1:48:10] not sin he shall surely live
[1:48:12] because he is warned also thou has
[1:48:14] delivered thy soul
[1:48:15] now is the day we are living in and the
[1:48:18] watchman what of the night
[1:48:19] oh he said there will be a time like it
[1:48:21] was in southern gomorrah
[1:48:23] oh my and he says no it takes the moon
[1:48:27] shines in the absence of the sun
[1:48:29] and that's what the church supposed to
[1:48:30] be reflect the presence of god while the
[1:48:33] sun is gone
[1:48:34] or when the sun comes up the moon is
[1:48:36] gone but just before day
[1:48:38] you ever notice the moon gets peeled it
[1:48:40] goes out i'll tell you the church is
[1:48:42] already to impale it's anemic
[1:48:43] it's got away from the blood it's got
[1:48:45] away from salvation and the holy ghost
[1:48:47] and the teaching of the word
[1:48:48] it's become anemic you see the sun is
[1:48:50] approaching and then the darkness of the
[1:48:52] night just before dawn

[1:48:55] just coming what is it
[1:48:56] the morning star the church of the
[1:48:58] living god today who is the watchman on

[1:49:24] change
[1:49:25] man lukewarm not able to stand the
[1:49:27] things of god they pull themselves off
[1:49:29] separating like in the days of noah oh
[1:49:32] my hallelujah

[1:49:36] this church and more powerful than ever
[1:49:38] before the coming of the lord jesus so
[1:49:40] there is no promise of weakness
[1:49:42] there's no promise of cooling down and
[1:49:43] slowing down and it's just getting cold
[1:49:45] and formal and running from the room
[1:49:47] and running from the press and hiding
[1:49:49] and whatnot hello promise at that time
[1:49:50] is that promise of power
[1:49:52] and you dealing with the effects of the
[1:49:54] power of god
[1:49:55] oh glory to god amen you say i know thy
[1:49:58] faith

[1:50:08] faith look at patience
[1:50:09] there is absolutely no other way
[1:50:13] in which to gain patience it has
[1:50:16] to come by the child of our fate
[1:50:20] romans 3 5 3 tribulation look at
[1:50:22] patience no highly god regardless of
[1:50:24] working of our patients
[1:50:25] you've seen in james 1 4 let patients
[1:50:27] have a perfect work
[1:50:28] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:50:30] lacking nothing and then he brought the
[1:50:32] bomb here god's will for us
[1:50:34] is perfection and that perfection is
[1:50:36] patience
[1:50:37] waiting on god and waiting for god
[1:50:40] this is the process of character
[1:50:44] development
[1:50:45] waiting for 50 years waiting for 25
[1:50:48] years like abraham
[1:50:49] waiting for 14 days in the upper room
[1:50:52] waiting just waiting moses had to wait
[1:50:54] the israel had to wait you have to wait

[1:51:21] oh glory to god you hear what i said and
[1:51:23] take trials of your faith to make it

[1:51:29] overcome it
[1:51:30] and not being tried what happened that
[1:51:32] person getting character
[1:51:33] because the child your faith is what
[1:51:35] produce any process
[1:51:36] that you get character development
[1:51:38] you're not born with character it has to
[1:51:40] be developed
[1:51:41] you have to be grown oh glory give the
[1:51:43] lord praises
[1:51:45] hallelujah every business have to honed
[1:51:48] itself
[1:51:48] especially adapt itself to the
[1:51:50] conditions are wrong
[1:51:52] because every day business is changing
[1:51:54] environment is changing
[1:51:56] something new coming on and making
[1:51:57] something null and void make it
[1:51:59] ineffective
[1:52:00] and everybody had to be alert as to what
[1:52:02] is happening here what is happening here
[1:52:03] what is happening here
[1:52:04] in order to adjust and to adapt oh glory
[1:52:06] to god
[1:52:07] and god put the watchman which is the
[1:52:09] holy spirit to give a word of warning
[1:52:11] to give a word to the people that they
[1:52:13] can adjust and adapt themselves to what
[1:52:15] is coming
[1:52:16] an uncommon storm hallelujah cross
[1:52:18] darkness covenant earth isn't that right
[1:52:20] hallelujah so god will for us is
[1:52:22] perfection
[1:52:23] and that perfection is patience waiting
[1:52:25] on god waiting for god
[1:52:27] this is the process of character
[1:52:30] development
[1:52:31] hallelujah praise god how highly god
[1:52:34] commended these saints of the dark ages
[1:52:36] patience as lambs let it slaughter
[1:52:38] lovingly and faithfully to serve god
[1:52:41] this is all they wanted out of life just
[1:52:43] service to the lord how great was the
[1:52:45] reward
[1:52:46] as the darkness of the age increased
[1:52:48] here we go
[1:52:49] as the honor roll of martyrs grew
[1:52:51] lengthier day by day
[1:52:52] they worked all the harder they serve
[1:52:55] all the more
[1:52:57] and their fate increased that's why i
[1:53:00] say coronavirus no church
[1:53:02] come on we don't know what next we don't
[1:53:03] know what the government said after so
[1:53:05] much days whatever
[1:53:06] but i'm saying increase your service to
[1:53:08] god more
[1:53:09] double up hallelujah pray
[1:53:13] pray twice as much as pray press twice
[1:53:15] as much
[1:53:16] hallelujah it's dark double up
[1:53:19] not not like there'll be sappy energy
[1:53:21] and suck the string you can't take it no
[1:53:22] take it
[1:53:24] is that people in the world they're
[1:53:25] taking it they're not even in church
[1:53:27] they don't even go to church and they're
[1:53:28] taking it they're accepting and
[1:53:29] adjusting and adapting you are
[1:53:31] you accept and adjust that this would
[1:53:33] have to live in you
[1:53:34] whether you're in church or no church
[1:53:36] pastor or no pastor elder no elder this
[1:53:38] after living you
[1:53:39] and that must be your heart desire live
[1:53:41] in me oh glory to god
[1:53:43] as the doctors of the age increased as
[1:53:45] the honor roll of the matches grew
[1:53:47] lentil day by day
[1:53:48] they worked all the harder they serve
[1:53:50] all the more and their faith
[1:53:52] increased how tragic it was that in the
[1:53:54] ephesian age love waned
[1:53:57] and truly nothing is said of the
[1:53:59] increased labor of love in the other
[1:54:00] ages
[1:54:01] but in this age in the darkness of all
[1:54:03] ages they save them even more
[1:54:06] what a lesson that is there is no
[1:54:08] ceasing of his gracious service of love
[1:54:11] unto the lord but rather an increasing
[1:54:13] of it that is the secret
[1:54:15] let the enemy attempt to taught our
[1:54:18] service to the lord
[1:54:19] our reply is increased silvers oh give
[1:54:22] the lord a shout on that one
[1:54:24] let the enemy try to our service to
[1:54:26] the lord
[1:54:27] our reply to the enemy increase service
[1:54:30] oh glory to god
[1:54:32] you're sorry you tried to press us
[1:54:34] because we doubling up
[1:54:35] oh glory to god increase service when
[1:54:38] the faints are crying in fear
[1:54:40] that is the time to shout the victory oh
[1:54:42] glory to god hallelujah
[1:54:46] i hope you're shouting outside
[1:54:48] hallelujah when the faints are crying in
[1:54:50] fear
[1:54:51] that is the time to shout the victory oh
[1:54:54] glory to god hallelujah
[1:54:56] i've been saying along there are two
[1:54:58] churches two churches
[1:55:00] though the spirit speaks to both of them
[1:55:02] in each age as though they
[1:55:04] were one here it is plainly stated that
[1:55:06] they are
[1:55:07] churches under the states that just as
[1:55:09] plainly as some of those churches most
[1:55:11] evidently do not know
[1:55:12] he is the one who searches the rains and
[1:55:15] the hearts
[1:55:16] he is going to prove to them that is so
[1:55:19] now when
[1:55:20] what churches will be those that do not
[1:55:21] know this truth
[1:55:23] of course it will be the false vine
[1:55:24] group because the true believers
[1:55:26] certainly know
[1:55:27] that judgment begins in the house of god
[1:55:30] and they being god-fearing
[1:55:32] judged themselves that they not be
[1:55:34] judged now why does god call these
[1:55:36] churches
[1:55:38] his churches even though they are the
[1:55:40] false vine
[1:55:42] you hear he that he let him hear what
[1:55:44] the spirit said unto the churches
[1:55:46] he's talking to two groups he's talking
[1:55:48] to the two vines
[1:55:49] that why we could play tapes every
[1:55:51] single day we'll always have two groups
[1:55:53] two fights
[1:55:54] i just leave the other vine leave them
[1:55:55] alone leave the other mine alone
[1:55:59] other words a false vine could never
[1:56:01] become a true vein
[1:56:05] that's the bottom line and the true vine
[1:56:07] can become false
[1:56:09] oh hallelujah why does god call these
[1:56:12] churches his churches
[1:56:13] even though they are the false mind the
[1:56:15] truth of the matter is that they are
[1:56:17] christians
[1:56:18] but they are not christians
[1:56:22] of the spirit they are
[1:56:25] christians of the flesh they are bearing
[1:56:28] the name
[1:56:29] in vain mark 7 7 whole beat and vein do
[1:56:32] they worship me teaching the doctrines
[1:56:33] of commandments of men but indeed they
[1:56:35] are christians
[1:56:36] for what else could they be a muhammadan
[1:56:39] is a muhammadan
[1:56:40] that is a religion no matter how he
[1:56:41] lives because he subscribes in theory
[1:56:44] to what the quran teaches in the same
[1:56:47] way a christian is a christian
[1:56:48] as long as he subscribes to the fact
[1:56:50] that jesus is the son of god born of a
[1:56:52] virgin crucified
[1:56:53] rose again and he's a savior of mankind
[1:56:55] et cetera so in this age
[1:56:57] there will be those who call themselves
[1:56:58] christians because they subscribe to the
[1:57:00] fine qualities of jesus
[1:57:01] but he's not a true or spiritual
[1:57:03] believer that kind of believer
[1:57:05] is one who has been baptized the true
[1:57:07] believer into the body of christ
[1:57:09] and is a member it is god's order the
[1:57:12] tears grow up with the wheat
[1:57:13] and they are not be uprooted that is the
[1:57:15] command of god their day for binding and
[1:57:18] burning is coming but not yet
[1:57:20] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[1:57:22] group one on the other hand is praising
[1:57:25] the other one he's rebuking
[1:57:27] he has told what is right or with a true
[1:57:29] believer and now he warns the false vine
[1:57:32] what must do and what must be to stand
[1:57:34] justified before the lord
[1:57:36] so what god does god look at the heart
[1:57:39] this is beautiful that has never changed
[1:57:41] neither will it ever change all through
[1:57:43] the ages there are two groups
[1:57:45] brought proclaiming their revelation
[1:57:48] from god
[1:57:48] and their relationship to god
[1:57:51] nevertheless
[1:57:52] the foundation standeth sure the lord
[1:57:54] knowed them that are his
[1:57:55] the lord search at the reins and the
[1:57:57] word search means to track
[1:57:59] or follow up god tracks down our
[1:58:01] thoughts
[1:58:02] reigns he knows what's in our hearts he
[1:58:05] sees our works which are a definite
[1:58:09] manifestation of what lies
[1:58:12] within us it is out of the heart
[1:58:16] that precede righteousness or wickedness
[1:58:19] our motives our purposes are all
[1:58:22] known unto him as he watches every
[1:58:24] action and every action every word shall
[1:58:26] be brought into judgment
[1:58:28] when they are conquering for our lives
[1:58:29] is given there is no fear of god
[1:58:32] before the false vine and dearly shall
[1:58:34] they pee
[1:58:36] that all who name his name so live has
[1:58:38] become its saints
[1:58:39] oh praise god hallelujah
[1:58:43] glory to god the pressure of the dark
[1:58:46] ages was either
[1:58:47] either bend or be broken bow or die
[1:58:50] it was the inquisition the power of the
[1:58:53] empire backing up satanic worship
[1:58:55] be organized or pay for it with your
[1:58:57] life each age has
[1:58:58] its pressures here we go each age had
[1:59:02] its pressures for example a great burden
[1:59:05] of the last age
[1:59:07] is the pressure of riches
[1:59:10] soft living nervous tensions in the
[1:59:14] complex age
[1:59:15] we seem unfitted to living now the
[1:59:18] pressure at this age
[1:59:20] you had any prejudices riches
[1:59:23] soft living nervous tensions
[1:59:27] in a complex age that we seem to live in
[1:59:30] oh
[1:59:31] my hallelujah i want to skip this over
[1:59:34] he didn't overcome it but keep my works
[1:59:37] and i will give him the morning star
[1:59:39] according to revelation 22 16
[1:59:41] jesus peter 1 19 jesus is the morning
[1:59:44] star
[1:59:45] i am root an offspring of david the
[1:59:47] bright and morning star
[1:59:48] and he tithed when peter until the day
[1:59:50] dawn and the days that arise in your
[1:59:52] hearts
[1:59:53] the spirit is therefore making a promise
[1:59:57] to the elect
[1:59:58] of the dark ages relative to himself
[2:00:02] and then in ages to come so because it's
[2:00:05] dark ages
[2:00:06] he's making a promise to them of the
[2:00:08] mourning star
[2:00:09] oh hallelujah have we already stated
[2:00:12] jesus identify himself with the
[2:00:15] messengers of each age
[2:00:16] they receive from him the revelation on
[2:00:18] the word for each period
[2:00:20] this word revelation
[2:00:23] brings the elect of god out of the world
[2:00:26] and into full union with jesus christ
[2:00:29] these messengers are called stars
[2:00:32] because they
[2:00:32] shine with a borrowed or reflected light
[2:00:35] of the sun even jesus
[2:00:36] they're also called stars because
[2:00:38] they're holders of
[2:00:40] light at night thus in the darkness of
[2:00:43] sin
[2:00:44] they bring light of god to his people
[2:00:48] this is the dark ages it's especially
[2:00:50] dark for the word of the lord is almost
[2:00:52] entirely hidden from the people
[2:00:53] knowledge of the most high or almost
[2:00:55] ceased debt has overcome vast numbers of
[2:00:57] believers
[2:00:58] until their ranks are decimated the
[2:01:00] things of god are at the lowest ed
[2:01:02] to date it seemed like satan would
[2:01:04] surely conquer god's people
[2:01:06] if ever a people need a promise
[2:01:10] embracing the land where it has no night
[2:01:13] it was the people of the dark ages and
[2:01:15] that is why the spirit is promising them
[2:01:18] the morning star he is telling them the
[2:01:21] chief star
[2:01:21] even jesus who dwell it in light unto
[2:01:24] which no man can approach
[2:01:26] will in the future kingdom illuminate
[2:01:28] them with his personal presence
[2:01:30] in the morning star is what is visible
[2:01:33] when the night
[2:01:34] on the light of the sun commenced to
[2:01:36] shine i want to skip downhill praise the
[2:01:38] name of the lord
[2:01:39] hallelujah look at the darkness covering
[2:01:42] the earth oh praise now
[2:01:44] what what god promised dark earthquakes
[2:01:46] and that
[2:01:47] was rumors are worse isn't that right
[2:01:49] and a big darkness coming
[2:01:50] three and a half years of tribulation
[2:01:52] three years a tribulation period isn't
[2:01:53] that right
[2:01:54] that is coming also that is that is
[2:01:56] night coming oh glory to god but i miss
[2:01:58] all of that
[2:01:59] he promised a church on fire a church
[2:02:02] that will have mechanics and dynamics
[2:02:04] a church that will have the ministry of
[2:02:07] jesus christ
[2:02:08] hallelujah reflecting what the uncommon
[2:02:10] soul
[2:02:11] he said once more the world will hear
[2:02:12] direct from god because that bride will
[2:02:14] be the final voice
[2:02:16] to the final age final voice of warning
[2:02:18] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:02:21] praise god we're on the home stretch
[2:02:23] hallelujah we see fearful sights
[2:02:25] earthquakes tidal waves falling gross
[2:02:27] darkness
[2:02:28] heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures
[2:02:30] but he promised that there would be
[2:02:32] later rain in the church the church
[2:02:34] spiritual in the last days
[2:02:35] he will pour both former and later in
