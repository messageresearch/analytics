[50:07] St Mark
[50:09] 5 we'll spend all the reading there in
[50:12] St Mark 415 and reading St Mark chapter
[50:16] 4 and reading from verse
[50:20] 35 and the same
[50:22] day Mark 4:35 and the same day when the
[50:26] even was come he saith unto them let us
[50:30] pass
[50:31] over unto the other side and when they
[50:35] had sent away the multitude they took
[50:37] him even as he was in the ship and they
[50:41] were also with him other little ships
[50:43] and there arose a great storm of wind
[50:47] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[50:49] it was now full and he was in the H the
[50:52] part of the ship asleep on a pillow and
[50:54] they awake him and say unto him Master
[50:57] carest thou not that we perish and he
[51:01] arose and rebuked the wind and said unto
[51:03] the sea peace be still and the wind
[51:06] ceased and there was a great calm and he
[51:09] said unto them why are ye so fearful how
[51:13] is it that ye have no faith and they
[51:16] feared exceedingly and said one to
[51:19] another what manner of man is this that
[51:22] even the wind and the Sea obey him and
[51:26] going over into the next chapter Mark 5
[51:28] and verse 1 and they came over unto the
[51:31] other side of the sea into the country
[51:34] of the gatherin and when he was come out
[51:37] of the ship immediately there met him
[51:39] out of the tombs a man with an unclean
[51:41] Spirit who had his dwelling among the
[51:44] tombs and no man could bind him no n
[51:48] with chains because that he had often he
[51:51] had been often bound with feathers and
[51:53] chains and the chains had been plucked
[51:55] aund by him and the feathers broken into
[51:57] pieces neither could any man tame him
[52:01] and always night and day he was in the
[52:04] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[52:06] cutting himself with stones and when he
[52:08] saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped
[52:11] him and cried with a loud voice and said
[52:14] what have I to do with thee Jesus thou
[52:16] son of the most high God I adure Thee by
[52:19] God that thou torment me not for he said
[52:23] unto him come out of the man thou
[52:25] unclean spirit and he asked him what is
[52:27] thy name and he said he answered saying
[52:30] my name is Legion for we are many and he
[52:32] besought him much that he would not send
[52:34] them away out of the country now there
[52:37] was there nigh unto the mountains a
[52:40] great herd of swine feeding and all the
[52:42] Devils besought him saying send us into
[52:44] the swine that we may enter into them
[52:46] and forth withth Jesus gave them leave
[52:50] and the unclean spirits went out and
[52:52] entered into the swine and the herd ran
[52:55] violently down a te plac into the sea
[52:57] there were about 2,000 and were choked
[53:00] in the sea and they that fed the wine
[53:03] the the the swine fled and told it in
[53:05] the city and in the country that they
[53:07] went out to see what is what what it was
[53:10] that was done and they come to Jesus and
[53:12] see him that was possessed with the
[53:14] devil and had the legion sitting and
[53:17] clothed and in his right mind and they
[53:19] were afraid and they that saw it told
[53:22] them how it befell to him that was
[53:24] possessed with the devil and also cons
[53:26] turning the swine and he began to pray
[53:28] him to depart out of their coast and
[53:31] when he was come into the ship he that
[53:33] had been possessed with the devil prayed
[53:35] him that he might be with him how be it
[53:37] Jesus suffered him not but sayth unto
[53:39] him go home to thy friends and tell them
[53:42] how great things the Lord hath done for
[53:45] thee and had hath compassion on thee may
[53:48] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[53:50] of his word you may be
[53:53] seated amen Give the Lord a hand of the
[53:56] praise this
[53:58] morning so we are certainly happy to be
[54:00] in the house of the Lord how many
[54:03] appreciate the message last Sunday come
[54:06] down to The Potter's House what a
[54:09] masterpiece of a masterpiece of a
[54:13] masterpiece of a message and there's so
[54:15] much in there it's it's word listening
[54:17] to again and it is so profound when you
[54:21] really study the scripture to see that
[54:24] there were just four elements in this
[54:27] whole story there's the
[54:29] Potter there is the wheel there is the
[54:33] clay and there is the
[54:35] Watcher here it is Jeremiah is watching
[54:40] there is the Potter standing there with
[54:42] the authority there is the clay being
[54:44] molded and shaped and there's the wheel
[54:46] that's spinning and I love how brought
[54:48] that that wheel is the wheel of life
[54:50] it's the wheel of circumstance it's the
[54:52] wheel of situations and we have no
[54:55] control over the wheel sometimes the
[54:57] wheel moves slow sometime the wheel
[54:59] moves faster sometime the wheel moves
[55:01] and it feels like it's out of control
[55:03] and you're just turning and your life
[55:05] and it's moving around but the one who's
[55:07] controlling that wheel is the Potter he
[55:09] knows when to speed it up he knows when
[55:11] to slow it down he knows when to stop
[55:14] for a breather he knows when to activate
[55:16] it he knows when to take a piece out of
[55:19] you because he is feeling and he knows
[55:21] if there's a defect he has got to stop
[55:23] to pull that defect out of there and the
[55:25] only way he could know there's a defect
[55:27] is to get his hands inside of the
[55:29] situation get his hands all up in your
[55:32] situation get his hands all up in your
[55:35] business and when his hands are in there
[55:37] he can feel it say wait a minute this is
[55:39] not supposed to be there because you may
[55:41] be see there for a minute that lump of
[55:43] clay in its raw form you pick up the
[55:45] clay you don't really know what's in
[55:47] there so when that Potter picks up the
[55:50] clay and puts it on the wheel and he
[55:52] starts to spin now he can have a
[55:53] relationship with the clay to say wait a
[55:56] minute this is starting to feel good I'm
[55:57] I'm starting to pull out the jealousy
[55:59] and pull out the envy and maybe I go
[56:01] little faster kind of see what stuff you
[56:04] made out all but at the end of the day
[56:06] cuz the Bible said it was mad it was mad
[56:09] in The Potter's hands it had nothing to
[56:12] do with you it had nothing to do with
[56:13] your family it was m in The Potter's
[56:15] hands it was it was his touching that
[56:18] caused it to even Mar because a piece of
[56:20] pebble may have moved and he realized
[56:22] wait a minute I didn't realize this was
[56:24] day I got to take it out and as he's
[56:25] working it's God working his way out
[56:28] because he is the Potter and we are the
[56:31] clay so I love how bov brought it if
[56:34] your life is spinning this morning
[56:36] that's all right because it's not you
[56:38] causing the spinning it's he causing the
[56:41] spinning so thank God that he is the
[56:44] Potter you are the clay and the wheel of
[56:47] your life could never be out of control
[56:50] it is always in control because he is
[56:54] the controller can the church say
[56:58] amen
[57:00] hallelujah I was so blessed so blessed
[57:03] so blessed and uh just to continue along
[57:06] that vein in a bit I have a title this
[57:09] morning and my title is what
[57:12] manner of man is this I have a subject
[57:16] is not this Joseph's son and an
[57:19] inspiration or total Deliverance amen

[58:52] Lord and healing our sickness and
[58:54] afflictions and when we go to our homes
[58:56] tonight may we be happy seeing like
[58:59] those from EMAs did not our hearts burn
[59:01] within us as he talked to us along the
[59:03] way for we ask it in Jesus name amen and
[59:07] amen and can the Church of the Living
[59:09] God say
[59:10] Amen so this morning I thank God for the
[59:13] trials I thank God for the tests and the
[59:16] situations that God in his wisdom has
[59:18] sent us through because at the end of
[59:20] the day as bovid said a few weeks ago
[59:22] God is looking for the right kind of a
[59:25] son yes and this question what manner of
[59:28] man is this is because Jesus was now
[59:30] breaking the thinking of those that were
[59:32] around him they had already seen him do
[59:34] Miracles they had seen him do stuff in
[59:37] fact early in his ministry they asked
[59:39] the question is this not Joseph's
[59:42] son why is he talking this way why is he
[59:45] preaching this way why is he reading the
[59:47] scripture this way they already knew
[59:49] that there was something different about
[59:51] him but from the passage we read there's
[59:53] a different kind of statement it's not
[59:56] about being even anyone's son but they
[59:58] ask what kind what manner of man is this
[1:00:01] and I'm looking for the day when the
[1:00:03] world would look at you and ask what
[1:00:05] manner of man is this under the pressure
[1:00:08] under the trials under the test under
[1:00:10] the situation you could still worship
[1:00:12] God in other words you are doing the
[1:00:14] unexpected when all hell is against you
[1:00:18] what manner of man is this you should
[1:00:20] have backed a long time ago but you're
[1:00:22] still standing what manner of man is
[1:00:25] this this week was a hard week for you
[1:00:28] but you're still in the house of God
[1:00:30] what manner of man is this and one day
[1:00:33] when you manifest a spoken word truly
[1:00:36] they will say what manner of man is this
[1:00:39] and even the wind and the Seas and the
[1:00:41] elements obey him
[1:00:43] God is looking to reproduce himself he
[1:00:47] doesn't want to be the only one who
[1:00:49] could do Miracles he doesn't want to be
[1:00:51] the only one who could heal the sick he
[1:00:53] doesn't want to be the only one who
[1:00:55] could raise the dead he said the same
[1:00:57] works I do you shall do also so that
[1:01:01] scripture what manner of man is this was
[1:01:04] not limited to that man called Jesus
[1:01:08] what manner of man is this was a
[1:01:10] prophecy of men to come that will fit
[1:01:13] that same description that will fit that
[1:01:16] same definition men who will break the
[1:01:19] rules of gravity men who will break the
[1:01:21] rules of the atmosphere men who will
[1:01:23] break the rules of Medicine men who will
[1:01:26] break the rules of physics men who will
[1:01:28] break the rules of nature men who will
[1:01:31] break the world of what's natural
[1:01:33] because they come from eternity they
[1:01:36] come from an eternal place no wonder he
[1:01:39] could walk on water no wonder he could
[1:01:42] take water and turn it into wine what
[1:01:45] manner of man is this can the church say
[1:01:49] Amen oh somebody help me preach this
[1:01:52] morning oh
[1:01:54] Hallelujah this we talking about Jesus
[1:01:57] many time in the message people miss the
[1:01:59] fact that it's all about Jesus brother
[1:02:02] brandham came to speak about Jesus uh
[1:02:04] just like John the Baptist uh his
[1:02:06] ministry was to forun the coming of
[1:02:09] Jesus uh the ministry of the Prophet was
[1:02:12] not for his own sake it was not for his
[1:02:14] own Ministry it was not to be placed
[1:02:16] there as a star just to say I'm a star
[1:02:19] in the right hand of God it was to point
[1:02:21] to Jesus walk in the earth once more
[1:02:24] it's to walk about 16 elements Jesus for
[1:02:27] all these years he's been waiting to
[1:02:30] find somebody and the son of man was
[1:02:33] veiled in a son of man in brother Bram
[1:02:37] no wonder he could say little fish I
[1:02:39] give you back your life what manner of
[1:02:42] man is this that can give a fish back
[1:02:44] his life son come on and Shout oh you

[1:03:12] forever you may be seated brother the
[1:03:15] Bram was just like you and I Peter was
[1:03:18] just like you and I James was just like
[1:03:21] you and I Moses was no different from
[1:03:23] you he's the same man God could take 16
[1:03:27] elements and throw some fire oh you
[1:03:30] don't hear me this morning throw some
[1:03:32] fire throw some fire and that fire could
[1:03:36] burn could burn the sin out could burn
[1:03:39] your nature out can burn the lion out
[1:03:43] can burn the lust out so that one man
[1:03:45] could walk in and a different man could
[1:03:48] walk out but then you'll have a
[1:03:50] testimony what manner of man is
[1:03:53] this you may be seated for a
[1:03:56] minute
[1:03:58] Hallelujah you may be seated for a
[1:04:00] minute I want you to appreciate
[1:04:02] something this morning I want you to
[1:04:04] appreciate the fact that when Jesus was
[1:04:07] in the boat the Bible said he was tired
[1:04:10] brother the kangali the Bible said They
[1:04:12] Carried him into the boat he didn't
[1:04:14] willingly walk into the boat the great
[1:04:17] God of Eternity was so exhausted in his
[1:04:20] human condition that it took trained men
[1:04:23] it took understanding men to lift Jesus
[1:04:27] up and carry him in the boat but as the
[1:04:30] young people say don't get it twisted in
[1:04:33] his tired condition when he's sleeping
[1:04:35] on the boat all the power that was in
[1:04:38] God is locked up in this man tiredness
[1:04:42] can't stop the power sickness can't stop
[1:04:45] the power being weary can't stop the
[1:04:48] power being frustrated can't stop the
[1:04:51] power I feel like a Baptist this morning
[1:04:54] I feel like a Pentecostal this morning
[1:04:57] you don't even know what you meeting
[1:04:59] this
[1:05:04] morning but give me the old time
[1:05:07] religion give me the Old Time Gospel
[1:05:10] give me the old time preaching give me
[1:05:12] the old time
[1:05:14] singing H welcome to the Butter's house
[1:05:19] there's joy in The Potter's House
[1:05:21] there's peace in The Potter's House
[1:05:24] there is Deliverance in the PO house
[1:05:26] everything you need in the pot's
[1:05:31] house can the church say Amen but I want
[1:05:36] to I want to rewind the story a little
[1:05:39] bit you may be SE it for a moment I want
[1:05:41] to rewind the
[1:05:43] story amen amen
[1:05:46] hallelujah you know some you see a a
[1:05:49] show something I tell you 36 hours
[1:05:52] earlier this is what the situation was I
[1:05:54] want to rewind us story because brother
[1:05:56] Bram dramatized this story in the
[1:06:00] message calling Jesus on the scene and
[1:06:04] he said from the uh scripture reading we
[1:06:06] find out that it had been a great
[1:06:08] meeting Jesus had been going about doing
[1:06:11] great wonders always doing good and
[1:06:14] always doing what was pleasing to God is
[1:06:16] that your
[1:06:17] testimony can people say the same about
[1:06:19] you that you always doing good ah young
[1:06:23] people always do doing good I see some
[1:06:26] young people smiling always doing
[1:06:30] good always doing what was pleasing to
[1:06:34] God not doing what's pleasing to the
[1:06:37] community or the friends or the family
[1:06:39] but always doing what's pleasing to God
[1:06:42] he always pleased God the prophet said
[1:06:45] he didn't please himself and the Bible
[1:06:48] and the B goes and virtue had gone from
[1:06:50] him he had been teaching Parables all
[1:06:53] day and virtue had gone out of him and
[1:06:55] he was going across to see across over
[1:06:58] on the other
[1:07:00] side by being what he was he knew there
[1:07:03] was a great job ahead on the other
[1:07:07] side Jesus was
[1:07:09] tired he had just finished preaching
[1:07:12] brother Knights he was exhausted and his
[1:07:15] last words before he fell asleep was we
[1:07:17] need to go on the other
[1:07:20] side but the Bram said because a great
[1:07:23] work was laying on the side
[1:07:26] other
[1:07:27] side I want to draw your attention to
[1:07:29] the fact that these men Peter and these
[1:07:32] brothers they were men that were used to
[1:07:34] the Sea and the waters and it was not
[1:07:37] their custom to go to
[1:07:39] the other
[1:07:41] side they were used to staying on the
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:46] side on the correct side because on the
[1:07:50] other side was the land of
[1:07:52] gadara a land of unbelievers
[1:07:55] a land of sin a land
[1:07:58] of Jews didn't go over
[1:08:01] there Believers didn't go over there
[1:08:03] because Jews don't mess with with the
[1:08:06] swine they don't mess with the unclean
[1:08:08] thing but the gatherin were the with the
[1:08:11] swine
[1:08:13] herders so there was no business for
[1:08:16] Peter to go to the other side and I
[1:08:18] could I could imagine Jesus tells them
[1:08:20] and they fell asleep and they look at
[1:08:21] one another Jesus wants to go to
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:26] other
[1:08:28] side it takes great obedience to listen
[1:08:31] to the words of the master and just do
[1:08:34] what he says even if it defies what
[1:08:38] your custom I love it what your custom
[1:08:40] is what your used to doing it's a break
[1:08:43] of the routine and Jesus leaves them
[1:08:46] hanging as it were because he didn't
[1:08:47] give them explanation he didn't have to
[1:08:50] explain himself or Justify say we need
[1:08:52] to go to the other side Hallelujah
[1:08:55] because what the disciples did not know
[1:08:57] and it's what Jesus knew is that on the
[1:08:59] other side was there was there was
[1:09:01] somebody who needed to be
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] delivered there was somebody on the
[1:09:07] other side who needed a breakthrough
[1:09:09] there was somebody on the other side who
[1:09:12] the Bible said day and night he was
[1:09:14] crying out because he wanted Deliverance
[1:09:17] but the spirits that were upon him would
[1:09:20] not give him leave would not give him
[1:09:23] leave to leave where he was to come over
[1:09:26] to where Jesus was so Jesus in his
[1:09:30] condition the same way he left glory to
[1:09:33] come down to our level he left the safe
[1:09:36] Zone and went into the dark Zone because
[1:09:40] there was somebody on the other
[1:09:44] side who needed to be set free he
[1:09:47] couldn't help himself he couldn't free
[1:09:49] himself they tried to tie him and he
[1:09:52] broke out they tried to counsel him they
[1:09:55] couldn't help him they prayed for him it
[1:09:58] didn't work they tried to help him but
[1:10:01] thank God Jesus was
[1:10:04] around Jesus was on the earth and the
[1:10:08] power to set him
[1:10:09] free he may be
[1:10:13] seated somebody's going free this
[1:10:16] morning oh yes oh yes oh yes you may be
[1:10:22] seated for a
[1:10:24] minute the Bible doesn't give us his
[1:10:29] name so in other words he could be
[1:10:32] anybody
[1:10:33] Hallelujah his name was not
[1:10:36] Legion the Bible does not give him his
[1:10:38] name and I love stuff like that because
[1:10:40] it's deliberate it's like the woman with
[1:10:43] the issue of
[1:10:44] blood no name it could be anybody there
[1:10:48] are people here with
[1:10:50] issues whether it's an issue of blood
[1:10:52] issue of pain issue of whatever issue is
[1:10:55] you're just like that woman with the
[1:10:56] issue of blood Jesus left it Anonymous
[1:10:59] so you could step in and catch fate if
[1:11:02] that no name woman with the issue of
[1:11:05] blood could tell herself if I could just
[1:11:09] Touch the Hem of His Garment I could be
[1:11:12] made
[1:11:14] whole this is not Sarah or Esther or
[1:11:17] Hannah or Deborah or Rebecca or Rachel
[1:11:21] this is a woman with an issue is there
[1:11:24] anybody in the house with issue well
[1:11:26] I've got news for you Jesus is still in
[1:11:29] the building and You Could Touch the Hem
[1:11:31] of His
[1:11:34] Garment you may be
[1:11:39] seated
[1:11:40] hallelujah
[1:11:42] hallelujah hallelujah it's hard to
[1:11:45] worship God when you have issues but if
[1:11:48] you could stop the issue of blood if you
[1:11:50] could stop that virtue leaving here all
[1:11:53] of a sudden your praise begins to get
[1:11:55] different
[1:11:56] your shout begins to get different your
[1:11:58] worship begin to get different and he's
[1:12:00] in the building this morning that same
[1:12:03] Jesus he is the same yesterday he's the
[1:12:06] same today he is the same
[1:12:10] forever you may be
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:14] seated can I just talk a little bit can
[1:12:17] I just encourage you a little
[1:12:19] bit so Jesus knew that there was
[1:12:21] somebody on the other
[1:12:23] side the Bible never reference his
[1:12:26] name and there are people in the house
[1:12:29] today you are struggling with an unclean
[1:12:32] Spirit it could be lying it could be
[1:12:34] lust it could be jealousy it could be
[1:12:37] envy and that's the one Spirit you're
[1:12:40] battling maybe some you dealing with two
[1:12:43] maybe you some you dealing with three
[1:12:44] problems you you struggling with lying
[1:12:47] you battling with envy your jealousy is
[1:12:50] eating you up but this man we're talking
[1:12:53] about it wasn't one problem it wasn't
[1:12:54] two was a it was a
[1:12:56] legion of unclean spirits and they were
[1:12:59] United as one because they spoke with
[1:13:02] one voice We Are
[1:13:05] Legion they were they had their own
[1:13:11] Union they were helping one another to
[1:13:15] keep this man in bondage they were
[1:13:17] helping one another to keep this man
[1:13:20] trapped but I don't care this morning
[1:13:22] what Demons What unclean spirits
[1:13:25] you have been hiding and harboring
[1:13:28] working together for a long time when
[1:13:31] Jesus crosses to the other side those
[1:13:35] demons they know who he is even if you
[1:13:38] don't know who he is those Devils that
[1:13:41] you have been fighting they know who he
[1:13:44] is you may be seated you may be
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:54] seated the story again we keep going
[1:13:56] ahead and have to keep pulling
[1:13:58] somebody's pulling this
[1:14:01] morning virtue had gone out of
[1:14:04] Jesus as he knows he needs to be on the
[1:14:07] other
[1:14:08] side he is tired and brother brandham
[1:14:11] said his disciples picked up their OES
[1:14:14] and hoisted the sails and I want you to
[1:14:15] see the drama of it just as seen would
[1:14:18] do many of them their occupation they
[1:14:21] were fishermen they under sea they know
[1:14:23] how to control these boats
[1:14:25] it was not their desire to go to the
[1:14:27] other side but but the BAM said while
[1:14:30] they're doing it they just were having a
[1:14:32] great time of rejoicing a jubilee time
[1:14:35] perhaps talking about the things that
[1:14:36] had happened that day and brother Bram
[1:14:38] said he's dramatizing so Jesus is
[1:14:41] sleeping and those Brothers brother
[1:14:43] Mikey instead of complaining they are
[1:14:45] talking they're fellowshipping around
[1:14:47] the world but the said you know there's
[1:14:48] something about it when you see our lord
[1:14:50] Jesus do things and you can know it's
[1:14:53] him that nothing else could do it but
[1:14:55] him we just simply we got to get
[1:14:58] together we everybody wants to
[1:15:00] testify everybody wants to see something
[1:15:03] and they want to talk about it you can
[1:15:05] have a Revival at your church and the
[1:15:08] pastor can speak a marvelous message or
[1:15:10] the Evangelist or whoever it might be
[1:15:12] and you see certain things take place or
[1:15:15] something in the neighborhood somebody
[1:15:16] was healed the neighbors get together
[1:15:18] and talk about it how marvelous were you
[1:15:20] there you should have seen it it was the
[1:15:22] most outstanding thing there's something
[1:15:24] about the works of God that trills man's
[1:15:27] heart more than anything else that could
[1:15:29] happen it's just an unforgettable
[1:15:32] experience when we come in contact with
[1:15:35] the Lord Jesus and see the things that
[1:15:37] he does so great and marvelous in his
[1:15:43] ways so Random said they must have took
[1:15:46] an
[1:15:47] opportunity while the sales were going
[1:15:49] along pretty well to talk about him
[1:15:52] about his acts about his claims about
[1:15:54] his messiahship I like what what the
[1:15:56] prophet said about his claims because
[1:15:58] they didn't fully understand who Jesus
[1:16:00] was he was just is this not Joseph's son
[1:16:03] he just stuff is happening around him
[1:16:05] but they still did not appreciate fully
[1:16:08] that he was
[1:16:09] different many of these disciples might
[1:16:11] have spoken of what they had seen done
[1:16:14] one or the other now that's the way they
[1:16:16] were talking maybe it was Simon as we
[1:16:18] talked about last and said when Andrew
[1:16:20] told me about him I was just a little
[1:16:22] bit skeptic but when he told me who I
[1:16:24] was and who my father was and took all
[1:16:27] the guests out of me I just believed him
[1:16:30] so these brothers are fellowshipping
[1:16:32] among when they first met this man who
[1:16:34] was sleeping there in the boat and it
[1:16:36] might have been Andrew said we talked
[1:16:38] about that lady at the well were you
[1:16:41] there Hallelujah Bren you know it was so
[1:16:44] strange we went to get some food some
[1:16:46] rituals and we come back and we were
[1:16:48] standing outside the bushes and we seen
[1:16:51] him talking to this ill Fame woman we
[1:16:54] talk in our hearts what if some of the
[1:16:56] priests would come up and see this our
[1:16:59] Master talking to a woman of this
[1:17:01] caliber that's the prophet talking what
[1:17:04] would they say about
[1:17:06] him and then we remember how we knew
[1:17:09] that we had confidence in him that it
[1:17:12] was for some purpose he was talking to
[1:17:14] her I want you to understand brothers
[1:17:16] sisters that it wasn't easy for the
[1:17:19] disciples they were normal men so the
[1:17:21] concerns you have the worries you have
[1:17:23] the questions you have these brothers
[1:17:25] had it too so they sharing and then he
[1:17:27] told her go get your husband and come
[1:17:29] and she said I have no husband how our
[1:17:31] hearts jumped because we thought there
[1:17:34] was one time that's a failure yes Jesus
[1:17:37] had told a woman she had to go get her
[1:17:39] husband when she had no husband you
[1:17:41] remember the look that we had on each
[1:17:43] other's faces as we marveled to think
[1:17:46] that all the confidence we had in him
[1:17:48] and he was dropped all of a sudden then
[1:17:50] we find immediately he spoke up and said
[1:17:52] you have told the truth for you've had
[1:17:54] five husband husbands and the one you
[1:17:56] have now is not yours then you recognize
[1:17:58] him as the Messiah the Messiah of God
[1:18:01] and said we know that Messiah is coming
[1:18:03] you must be a prophet and stuff amen the
[1:18:06] brothers testifying when last have you
[1:18:09] testified about Jesus when last time you
[1:18:11] told somebody about a service that you
[1:18:13] went to and it was so powerful for your
[1:18:15] soul you couldn't help yourself you
[1:18:17] couldn't you couldn't keep it to
[1:18:18] yourself you had to tell everybody were
[1:18:21] you there how could you miss it when the
[1:18:23] Lord came and spoke to us along the way
[1:18:26] can the church say
[1:18:29] Amen brother sat it might have been
[1:18:32] young John who said you know I'll tell
[1:18:34] you what made it real to me is there
[1:18:36] someone that made it real to you young
[1:18:38] people without an experience that makes
[1:18:40] it real to you you'll
[1:18:43] backslide without an experience that
[1:18:45] makes it real to you you'll be depending
[1:18:48] on your mother's testimony your father's
[1:18:50] testimony the pastor's testimony but you
[1:18:54] there must be something that made it
[1:18:56] real to you so brother said then it
[1:18:58] might have been young John that said you
[1:19:00] know I'll tell you what made it real to
[1:19:01] me that day when he broke the bread we
[1:19:04] was all hungry and had went out into the
[1:19:06] Wilderness and we couldn't find him and
[1:19:09] there we met him and all the multitudes
[1:19:11] came around and the first thing you know
[1:19:12] we find him saying send them away to the
[1:19:14] city to get food and he told us to feed
[1:19:17] them then and he got these five biscuits
[1:19:19] and two little fish and he broke that
[1:19:21] bread and I noticed his hand when he
[1:19:24] reached back for another piece of bread
[1:19:26] that biscuit was growed out again this
[1:19:28] is the prophet talking and then when he
[1:19:30] reached back put it out in a plate then
[1:19:31] reached back that fish was growed out
[1:19:33] again not only the regular fish but it
[1:19:36] was cooked
[1:19:38] fish see already growed back
[1:19:43] again what manner of man is
[1:19:48] this this is the prophet what kind of an
[1:19:51] atom did he turn loose brethren cooked
[1:19:55] fish cooked bread bypassed the
[1:19:59] growing we know he was the creator but
[1:20:02] here he was making creation of already
[1:20:04] cooked fish and cooked
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:14] bread There's Hope for those who can't
[1:20:22] [Music]

[1:20:27] smiling some people saying I can't wait
[1:20:29] for this power you know cooked bread
[1:20:32] cooked fish God knows I can't
[1:20:34] cook
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:36] Hallelujah but that's the Messiah we're
[1:20:39] talking about just confounding the
[1:20:41] people confounding the minds those
[1:20:43] around John might have said to me like
[1:20:45] this you know when I was a little boy we
[1:20:47] lived down in Jericho and but the
[1:20:48] brandom said they're going on and on
[1:20:50] just testifying and telling the stories
[1:20:52] of what it was yes but then all of a
[1:20:56] sudden a storm begins to come yes
[1:21:00] because the devil is always watching and
[1:21:02] the devil always recognizing when
[1:21:04] there's a change in the pattern of your
[1:21:08] behavior Jesus is going to the other
[1:21:10] side that's not normal so the devil
[1:21:12] knows something is happening it's all
[1:21:15] right when you stay on your tur but you
[1:21:16] see when you going to pray for your
[1:21:18] family when you begin to pray longer
[1:21:21] when you begin to open your Bible and
[1:21:23] read at odd hours on the devil know
[1:21:24] you're normally watching TV and then all
[1:21:26] of a sudden you pull your Bible instead
[1:21:28] oh my then the devil knows something is
[1:21:30] about to happen so Jesus is on the Move
[1:21:33] he's sleeping but he's on the move
[1:21:35] because somebody's going to get
[1:21:36] delivered I say let's break the routine
[1:21:39] this morning let's do something we don't
[1:21:42] normally do it's all right if Satan gets
[1:21:45] mad there's nothing he could do about it
[1:21:47] because we come from God and we're going
[1:21:50] back to
[1:21:52] God Hallelujah Jesus was a mission and
[1:21:55] he was not letting no devil compromise
[1:21:58] the mission and a storm came and so many
[1:22:01] times Storms Come into our lives we
[1:22:04] didn't request the storm we didn't
[1:22:06] prepare for the storm we didn't ask for
[1:22:08] the storm you just go into your normal
[1:22:10] living and your life begins to rock your
[1:22:13] life begins to shake and the Bible said
[1:22:16] Water started coming into the boat Jesus

[1:22:24] him the screams didn't wake him and the
[1:22:26] disciples were like what are we going to
[1:22:27] do should we wake
[1:22:32] Jesus should we wake the Messiah and out
[1:22:35] of fear by the Clarance they shook Jesus
[1:22:38] and this man who was sleeping he didn't
[1:22:40] start to scream with the rest of them he
[1:22:42] didn't start to worry with the rest of
[1:22:44] them he didn't grab a bucket to bail out
[1:22:46] the water he didn't say grab the life
[1:22:48] jackets or get a raft or let's go back
[1:22:51] let's Retreat let's turn around uh he

[1:30:39] that same man the devil messed up the
[1:30:41] devil made the biggest mistake because
[1:30:44] he thought it was finished but when
[1:30:46] Jesus died he went down right to the
[1:30:48] devil's Kingdom and knocked on the door
[1:30:51] they say but everybody's accounted for

[1:37:46] believes and he trembles I want you to
[1:37:49] acknowledge something that in that man's
[1:37:52] condition
[1:37:54] and this is for people in the message
[1:37:55] who don't want to
[1:37:57] Worship in this man's condition the
[1:38:01] Bible said he came to
[1:38:04] worship because he had to acknowledge
[1:38:06] that the alpha the Omega the beginning
[1:38:09] and the end the first and the
[1:38:12] last the condition this man was in he
[1:38:15] was still clear to see what the
[1:38:19] spiritual super spiritual message
[1:38:23] believer can
[1:38:24] see he could see that he was worthy of
[1:38:28] worship he could see that he was worthy
[1:38:31] of the praise he
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:52] could
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:56] you may be see it for a minute I want
[1:38:58] this to be made clear young people
[1:39:00] Church of the Living
[1:39:02] God but brandom taught us we are created
[1:39:04] to worship the very name God the word
[1:39:08] God by definition is object of worship
[1:39:12] and brother Bram taught us you will
[1:39:13] worship something so if you don't
[1:39:15] worship God you're worshiping something
[1:39:19] else not because in the message means
[1:39:22] you suddenly My Worship is discret
[1:39:24] discret worship why they have altars and
[1:39:26] sacrifices and the incent the smoke
[1:39:28] going up for the high
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:31] priest but you Worship in public with
[1:39:34] how you dress and what you talk about
[1:39:37] because what you reverence and respect
[1:39:38] and worship you talk about
[1:39:41] it whether it's your job it's your car
[1:39:43] it's your house it's economy it's
[1:39:44] politics you can worship anything you
[1:39:46] can make anything of
[1:39:47] God they take a golden Cal with no life
[1:39:50] and make it a
[1:39:52] god they take fish and make it God take
[1:39:55] all kind of stuff and make it God but
[1:39:57] this man listen to the
[1:39:59] words I just want to read it back again
[1:40:02] and always night and day he was in the
[1:40:04] mountains and in the tombs crying he
[1:40:07] wasn't crying out of Happiness even
[1:40:10] though he was in his condition he knew
[1:40:12] something was
[1:40:14] wrong he knew he needed help he knew he
[1:40:17] needed a touch so he was there crying
[1:40:19] and cutting himself with stones it's
[1:40:21] almost he wanted to get what was ever in
[1:40:23] him he wanted to get it
[1:40:29] out but Mark 5 and verse 6 but when he
[1:40:32] saw Jesus a far off he ran he didn't
[1:40:35] even walk you hear what the pastor said
[1:40:37] last week if you're late to church on
[1:40:39] walk
[1:40:41] in
[1:40:49] run Hallelujah when he saw Jesus power
[1:40:52] off he ran
[1:40:53] and worship Him amen and cried with a
[1:40:56] loud voice and said what have I to do
[1:40:58] with thee Jesus now listen Jesus
[1:41:01] introduced himself but listen the man
[1:41:03] recognized the spirit Jesus thou son of
[1:41:07] the most high
[1:41:10] God so that's why there any backsliders
[1:41:12] in here the fear of the Lord is the
[1:41:16] beginning of wisdom I don't care what
[1:41:19] condition you are in if you give God
[1:41:21] respect you give respects to the house
[1:41:24] of God you give respects to the pulpit
[1:41:27] you give respects to the word of God God
[1:41:29] will do
[1:41:31] something for
[1:41:33] you you young people in here who believe
[1:41:36] you are here because your parents tell
[1:41:38] you to come to church and only because
[1:41:40] you're under my roof that's why you're
[1:41:42] here you better be careful because that
[1:41:45] itself is the grace of God to you to
[1:41:50] grow up in a house that fears honor and
[1:41:53] respects God enough to want the best for
[1:41:58] you shame on you young people who have
[1:42:01] taken that for granted that God entrust
[1:42:05] into the hands of your parents as
[1:42:07] caregivers and caree Keepers that they
[1:42:10] have the heart for the Lord to tell you
[1:42:13] come to
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:15] church worship
[1:42:18] God come into the Ark of Safety because
[1:42:20] the rain is coming
[1:42:23] the rain is about to fall don't be
[1:42:26] outside of the
[1:42:27] Ark I always wonder about Noah and his
[1:42:30] family because God didn't speak to
[1:42:33] Noah's wife he didn't speak to Noah's
[1:42:35] children he didn't speak to Noah's
[1:42:37] brothers and uncles Noah had the most
[1:42:40] daunting difficult challenge to convince
[1:42:43] everybody including his family to come
[1:42:45] to the
[1:42:46] ark whatever means he used to get his
[1:42:50] children into the ark I always raise to
[1:42:53] the church I wonder how the children
[1:42:55] felt when the door was shut and the
[1:42:58] rains began to fall when they could see
[1:43:01] their
[1:43:02] friends on the
[1:43:07] outside
[1:43:10] screaming can we still get
[1:43:19] in is there still a chance Hall
[1:43:25] as the water begins to rise it would
[1:43:27] have been
[1:43:31] painful whatever the names were
[1:43:34] hallelujah hallelujah help me help me
[1:43:38] I've known you my whole
[1:43:42] life and then people want to say how
[1:43:44] could God do
[1:43:46] this when Noah preached for
[1:43:50] years get into the ark
[1:43:56] and young people grow up in church
[1:43:58] hearing
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:00] it going through the motions as it were
[1:44:04] coming to church taking a seat singing
[1:44:08] the song playing the roles right just as
[1:44:11] people who go to school for 5 years and
[1:44:13] get
[1:44:14] nothing yes I'm seeing
[1:44:16] it because there comes a point that you
[1:44:19] have to accept
[1:44:21] responsibility that if the teacher gave
[1:44:24] instruction or the pastor ministered the
[1:44:27] word is no longer under the pastor it's
[1:44:29] no longer under the teacher it's not the
[1:44:32] education system and it's not the church
[1:44:34] it's on you to take action when nobody
[1:44:38] else is
[1:44:40] watching action be it to study action be
[1:44:44] it to master your craft action be it to
[1:44:46] pray action to fast action to read the
[1:44:49] word the pastor cannot do this nor can
[1:44:52] the teacher or the principal or your
[1:44:55] boss on your job there's some point in
[1:44:58] your life you have to accept
[1:45:01] responsibility for what you do with the
[1:45:04] same 24 hours a day that everybody else
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:10] has you may be seated Jesus didn't have
[1:45:14] 36 hours in a day Moses didn't have 29
[1:45:17] hours in the day Daniel didn't have 28
[1:45:20] hours it was the same 24 hours that we
[1:45:22] have all always had but yet Daniel found
[1:45:25] time to
[1:45:26] pray what manner of man is this that
[1:45:30] could make time every day to pray what
[1:45:33] manner of man is this like David every
[1:45:37] day you meditate on the word blessed is
[1:45:39] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:45:42] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[1:45:45] of Sinners nor sit it in the seat of a
[1:45:47] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:45:50] of the Lord and in his law do he
[1:45:52] meditate day and night he shall be like
[1:45:55] a tree that's planted by rivers of
[1:45:59] living do we have any Bible reading
[1:46:02] Christians in the
[1:46:04] [Applause]
[1:46:10] house what's your
[1:46:13] excuse this morning I saw a news report
[1:46:16] of an 81y old woman in Japan who just
[1:46:19] released a mobile app in the store the
[1:46:24] Apple Store at 81 the first time she
[1:46:26] touched a computer was at age
[1:46:29] 60 and at age 81 she might be the oldest
[1:46:32] person to write a mobile app for the
[1:46:35] Apple IE store and I asked myself what
[1:46:39] what's my excuse what's your excuse
[1:46:43] because at the end of the day
[1:46:44] achievements be it in the natural and in
[1:46:47] the spiritual there's only one formula
[1:46:50] sacrifice effort and work
[1:46:53] that's why when God put Adam in the
[1:46:55] Garden of Eden his job was to do
[1:46:57] what that's only 2% his job was to what
[1:47:03] work work all right prayer is work work
[1:47:07] is work but at the end of the day you
[1:47:10] have to
[1:47:12] work has preaching before before Adam
[1:47:14] had his wife he had
[1:47:20] what before Adam had his wife had
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:25] what so no
[1:47:27] work no
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] wife I'm speaking The Headstone
[1:47:35] Tabernacle for those outside of headone
[1:47:37] listen to your
[1:47:41] pastor no
[1:47:43] work no
[1:47:45] wife headstone Tabernacle because God
[1:47:49] has a order he put manate say Adam tell
[1:47:52] the
[1:47:55] soil Adam working working money go in
[1:47:59] bank account working working he's saving
[1:48:02] working working after that Adam God say
[1:48:05] look you have enough in your bank
[1:48:06] account you have enough in place now he
[1:48:09] ready for a
[1:48:11] wife but what but what is this about God
[1:48:13] is a god of responsibility God has no
[1:48:15] spoil children in know and that's why I
[1:48:17] say when things come to people easy it
[1:48:20] goes away
[1:48:21] easy
[1:48:23] years ago we had people come to church
[1:48:24] Lord if I get a car I'll be in church
[1:48:27] every
[1:48:29] service the struggling to travel to
[1:48:31] church when they get the car you never
[1:48:33] seen them they in Beach they in Tam they
[1:48:35] reaching parts of the country I never
[1:48:36] even
[1:48:39] see and then some of us we want to know
[1:48:42] why God don't bless us more because some
[1:48:44] God give you too much you will do too
[1:48:46] much so thank God for that
[1:48:51] wheel
[1:48:53] because the Potter controls what happens
[1:48:56] on the
[1:48:57] Wheel to make sure that you make it to
[1:49:00] your destination make sure you get the
[1:49:03] Holy Ghost that woman with the issue of
[1:49:06] blood it was not her first position to
[1:49:09] go to
[1:49:10] Jesus it was after her money ran out she
[1:49:14] was desperate to look for alternative
[1:49:21] medicine and and her alternative
[1:49:23] medicine was I've heard that Jesus is in
[1:49:26] town and she said to
[1:49:29] herself didn't matter who said anything
[1:49:31] else if I could just Touch the Hem of
[1:49:33] His Garment I'll be made whole it was
[1:49:36] her desperation that contributed to her
[1:49:40] behavior and that's why for many of us
[1:49:42] in the house of God God has to bring us
[1:49:45] to the spot where the wheel turn so fast
[1:49:48] that we get
[1:49:49] desperate to say Lord I need a Holy
[1:49:53] Ghost Lord I Need A Touch Lord I need a
[1:49:57] fresh experience Lord help me Lord have
[1:50:03] mercy can the church say Amen bring back
[1:50:07] the real Christians bring back the real
[1:50:09] Believers bring back the real truth
[1:50:12] Seekers amen not coming to church to
[1:50:15] hear somebody to just feel good about
[1:50:16] yourself but you want to hear the truth
[1:50:18] that's what I love about the
[1:50:20] wheel when it's going good it's fine but
[1:50:23] when God sees something to correct
[1:50:25] break because he wants
[1:50:27] Perfection he doesn't want church
[1:50:29] members God doesn't even want
[1:50:31] Christians he wants
[1:50:33] Sons huge
[1:50:36] difference because that term Christian
[1:50:38] has been put into so many shapes forms
[1:50:41] and fashions that people and don't talk
[1:50:43] about message
[1:50:46] Believers I want to be like
[1:50:49] Jesus I want to be like him that's the
[1:50:52] only measure that's the Only Rule that's
[1:50:55] the only measur and stick that I want to
[1:50:58] be like
[1:51:00] Jesus Jesus stood there and he was a man
[1:51:03] but when he rose again he was he was
[1:51:06] more than man
[1:51:07] Hallelujah and God is so willing to
[1:51:10] share his power that when the devil
[1:51:12] thought it was finished here comes Peter
[1:51:15] Here Comes James and John and Andrew and
[1:51:17] then Here Comes somebody who was not
[1:51:18] even in the circle a guy called Saul who
[1:51:22] became Paul and start to do things that
[1:51:25] Jesus did then the devil realized that
[1:51:27] he had a real problem on his hand and
[1:51:29] then we see ages go by and every story
[1:51:32] that's why this gospel is dripping with
[1:51:33] blood it wasn't easy for Luther it
[1:51:35] wasn't easy for Wesley it wasn't easy
[1:51:37] for Simo and those and it wasn't easy
[1:51:39] for the prophet amen when ROM lost his
[1:51:43] wife and lost his child that was the
[1:51:44] wheel
[1:51:46] spinning because almighty God was going
[1:51:49] to Tabernacle himself in this man amen
[1:51:54] that we can look back and say what
[1:51:55] manner of man is that that a 20th
[1:51:58] century Prophet from
[1:52:00] Kentucky could be a wave she for us Amen
[1:52:04] to say there are others coming
[1:52:06] Hallelujah there'll be other young men
[1:52:08] there'll be other young women there'll
[1:52:09] be other Christians who will come and
[1:52:11] they will speak and their words will be
[1:52:13] created just like that that's a
[1:52:16] prophecy this bride will be his
[1:52:18] mouthpiece once more the world will hear
[1:52:21] direct from God
[1:52:23] amen Brandon was excited not about
[1:52:26] himself he was excited about what was to
[1:52:28] come what manner of men are these that
[1:52:32] could walk these countries When sin is
[1:52:35] everywhere when demons are
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:40] everywhere and see your family delivered
[1:52:43] and see young people reject what the
[1:52:45] devil has to
[1:52:46] offer reject the devil's offer I don't
[1:52:50] care how good it is if it's from the
[1:52:51] devil reject it it does not belong to
[1:52:55] you you have your inheritance you have
[1:52:57] your promise you have your healing you
[1:53:00] have your Victory you have your eternal
[1:53:02] life to
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:09] come sometimes young people we need to
[1:53:11] be shaken back into
[1:53:15] reality I wonder back in Noah's day when
[1:53:17] the rain started to fall how many people
[1:53:19] were wondering about their bank account
[1:53:22] or their house or their car or their
[1:53:23] Chariot or their horse or their donkey
[1:53:25] or whatever they had
[1:53:26] then all of a sudden your perspective
[1:53:29] changes I said to them in Marv some time
[1:53:31] ago there was an earthquake that day I
[1:53:33] said for that brief moment of that
[1:53:35] earthquake if you thinking about bank
[1:53:37] account when earthquake going on you
[1:53:38] ready you are
[1:53:39] unique you are in a special
[1:53:43] class if you could find in your mind to
[1:53:46] think about wow my
[1:53:49] chandelier in the midst of an earthquake
[1:53:51] your instin is to cover yourself hide
[1:53:54] not listen H let's fix this holy sh
[1:54:01] please because you realize in that brief
[1:54:03] moment your
[1:54:05] mortality you realize in that brief
[1:54:07] moment that heaven and Earth really will
[1:54:09] pass away but only God's word will pass
[1:54:13] away it's a reality
[1:54:17] check and it makes you realize I said to
[1:54:19] my wife some time ago have the stuff
[1:54:21] that we stress about is not wor
[1:54:23] stressing
[1:54:26] about half the stuff we worry about you
[1:54:29] know worrying is
[1:54:36] sin you you never heard this
[1:54:41] one worrying is a
[1:54:45] sin if the birds have to worry where to
[1:54:47] get in food why you
[1:54:51] worrying yeah Jesus say hand it I said
[1:54:54] this to them in cania one time Jesus
[1:54:56] said cast all your cares upon me and
[1:54:59] some of us we do that part you know we
[1:55:01] cast our cares upon Him and we turn
[1:55:04] around and then you know what we go and
[1:55:06] take it
[1:55:09] back and that's what worrying is because
[1:55:12] if you hand something to God it's either
[1:55:15] he could fix it or he
[1:55:17] cannot so if he could fix it why are you
[1:55:20] taking it
[1:55:21] back
[1:55:23] and that is what prayer is Lord I need
[1:55:27] help with this this this when you put it
[1:55:29] on
[1:55:30] him but so stressed a thing
[1:55:34] and and God is saying well why you came
[1:55:36] to me in the first place because while
[1:55:39] I'm fixing it you're go and tell
[1:55:40] everybody you have this big
[1:55:42] problem
[1:55:45] hallu but is like that's not how the
[1:55:47] normal Services is go this is reality
[1:55:49] you know you know Jesus it is a reason
[1:55:52] Jesus Took Parables to preach to people
[1:55:56] to make it simple because we have become
[1:55:58] so super spiritual we have lost sight of
[1:55:59] God a long time
[1:56:01] ago but God wants practical living it's
[1:56:06] either Faith or no faith it's either
[1:56:08] your love or you there's no middle
[1:56:09] ground it's either you're hot or you're
[1:56:11] cold but it's lukewarm one minute on top
[1:56:13] of the mountain why is it by Tuesday you
[1:56:15] down in the
[1:56:16] valley
[1:56:17] hallall is a
[1:56:20] slide so may you just take a slide on
[1:56:22] top slide on by Tuesday
[1:56:25] Valley Nobody Knows the God help you if
[1:56:30] get the Thursday night service by Sunday
[1:56:31] it's crank crank is a whole wheel there
[1:56:33] a whole thing pulling you back up on top
[1:56:35] of the
[1:56:36] mountain but you know if you pray every
[1:56:39] day if you read every day that's why I
[1:56:41] tell people it's impossible for you to
[1:56:43] get an argument with your neighbor if
[1:56:44] you were just reading the Bible it's a
[1:56:46] real leap brother kangali to go from
[1:56:48] reading a scripture and praying to
[1:56:50] cussing out the neighbor it's a real
[1:56:51] it's a
[1:56:55] very it's a immense leap you cannot walk
[1:56:59] out of a prayer
[1:57:01] meeting and just walk in that
[1:57:06] fight the anointing takes some time to
[1:57:09] come over
[1:57:12] you that's why if you practice the
[1:57:14] presence of God listen to The Prophet
[1:57:16] one time the prophet went to
[1:57:18] minister and he the brothers took him to
[1:57:20] a hotel room and as he stepped in he
[1:57:23] stopped he said I need another
[1:57:26] room because adultery was communicated
[1:57:29] was committed in this room last night
[1:57:31] and the Spurs were still
[1:57:34] there one time at the bam is
[1:57:37] driving and he said he picked up
[1:57:38] somebody and he said they spoke a Blue
[1:57:42] Streak and affected the anointing yes
[1:57:46] and it teaches us a lesson about
[1:57:49] practicing the presence of God
[1:57:51] hallelujah there's some people you
[1:57:52] cannot spend time
[1:57:54] with and whenever you find yourself in
[1:57:57] trouble you have to get to the root
[1:57:59] cause of the problem it is something
[1:58:01] that You' have been doing that led to
[1:58:02] you getting in trouble you cannot just
[1:58:04] find yourself in
[1:58:07] fornication there's always a lead
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:12] up anybody in the house this
[1:58:15] morning that's why the word says pray
[1:58:18] and meditate day and night Joshua be
[1:58:21] strong and very courageous
[1:58:24] yes
[1:58:26] Hallelujah but there was a
[1:58:30] condition meditate on the word day and
[1:58:33] night and that is to have him have good
[1:58:37] success how could you have success
[1:58:39] outside of God what type of Christian
[1:58:42] are you when you say you're a Christian
[1:58:43] and you leave your house in a morning
[1:58:45] without prayer without acknowledging God
[1:58:47] this might be simple but it's the
[1:58:49] truth bring back the old Time family
[1:58:53] prayer bring back the prayer there's no
[1:58:56] Revival that could ever come without
[1:58:59] prayer no way no mystery brings Revival
[1:59:03] no preaching brings Revival no word
[1:59:06] brings Revival it takes prayer it takes
[1:59:09] sacrifice it takes fasting it takes
[1:59:11] sighing it takes crying that's the only
[1:59:14] formula for revival can the Church Say
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:21] Amen I've done going way ahead of my
[1:59:23] time but I pray that in some way this
[1:59:26] word would help
[1:59:29] somebody Hallelujah somebody say
[1:59:34] Amen may we just skip ahead can we give
[1:59:37] him worship this
[1:59:41] morning so what manner of man is this so
[1:59:46] friends I'm looking for Real Men Real
[1:59:48] Women of God that could be in the spirit
[1:59:52] could walk in the spirit could talk in
[1:59:54] the spirit could live in the spirit
[1:59:56] could act in the spirit in the message
[1:59:59] no let me just skip
[2:00:02] that just give me quite a
[2:00:06] bit amen
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:11] hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus
[2:00:14] Hallelujah
[2:00:15] bless so Jesus is standing there and
[2:00:19] he's ministering to this man who had
[2:00:23] been
[2:00:24] bound and when he cast that evil spirit
[2:00:28] out the neighborhoods The Village the
[2:00:31] community they were shocked because they
[2:00:33] had given up on him they couldn't
[2:00:36] believe that this man was in his right
[2:00:37] man in his right mind and he was clothed
[2:00:41] and I and I love that because when he
[2:00:42] was possessed
[2:00:44] brother Terence he took all his clothes
[2:00:46] off the moment he was delivered he put
[2:00:48] his clothes on amen amen
[2:00:53] so when you see people taking close
[2:00:55] off it's directly tight to the degree of
[2:00:58] possession but when you start to get
[2:01:00] back to God all of a sudden your clothes
[2:01:01] have to come back
[2:01:03] on so you young people who want to be
[2:01:06] copying the world without Revelation and
[2:01:09] because your friends doing that it's
[2:01:11] spirits that you're dealing with you're
[2:01:13] not dealing with people who are people
[2:01:14] you're dealing with spirits that are
[2:01:15] walk in the Earth but the B said we want
[2:01:17] complete deliverance we don't want to be
[2:01:19] a halfway church we want to be a real
[2:01:21] Church or no church at all we want to be
[2:01:23] real Christians or no Christians at all
[2:01:26] we want Total deliverance from our
[2:01:28] habits from our sins from our evil
[2:01:30] thinking from our evil doing from our
[2:01:32] negligence whatever we have done we want
[2:01:35] Total Deliverance so that when people
[2:01:37] come into this church to be prayed for
[2:01:40] there'll be just this little group maybe
[2:01:42] not over a 100 or 200 sitting here but
[2:01:44] they'll be completely in the hands of
[2:01:46] God and when we pray then God will hear
[2:01:49] from Heaven God wants somebody that he
[2:01:52] can hold in his hands somebody that he
[2:01:54] can say I got confidence in I can send
[2:01:57] this my sick servant to the brandom
[2:02:00] Tabernacle and I say this morning I can
[2:02:02] send this my sick servant to headstone
[2:02:05] Tabernacle and that group of people are
[2:02:07] in one Accord something will happen and
[2:02:11] brother brandham went on he said that's
[2:02:13] the way Moses and his group did they got
[2:02:15] over there and got under the blood you
[2:02:18] notice until they got under the blood
[2:02:20] there was no total Deliverance Moses
[2:02:23] himself he was unified with God but
[2:02:27] Israel wasn't there still was sin and
[2:02:30] they murmured against Moses and they
[2:02:32] said why you do this you bring more
[2:02:34] trouble upon us but Moses was different
[2:02:37] he was completely in the hand of God
[2:02:40] totally delivered from sheep hurting to
[2:02:42] hurt God's sheep he was totally
[2:02:45] delivered himself but the people wasn't
[2:02:47] delivered because there were still
[2:02:49] murmuring among them but one night
[2:02:52] when God ordained that a lamb should be
[2:02:54] killed a type of Christ and the blood
[2:02:58] was dipped in his up which his weeds
[2:03:00] comeon humble and put over the lintle of
[2:03:03] the door and on the post that's when
[2:03:05] Israel became completely delivered and
[2:03:08] not a ho left behind all that belonged
[2:03:11] to them was delivered their families
[2:03:14] their loved ones and everything was
[2:03:16] delivered when they completely come
[2:03:18] under the blood and listen to the
[2:03:20] prophet here's a prophet prophecy that's
[2:03:22] when the church shall be completely
[2:03:25] delivered when everything comes under
[2:03:27] the blood when your sins come under the
[2:03:29] blood when your smoking comes under the
[2:03:31] blood when you're gambling when you're
[2:03:33] cheating when you're stealing when
[2:03:35] you're lying when everything is brought
[2:03:37] under the blood then there'll be a total
[2:03:39] Deliverance if you have wronged somebody
[2:03:42] make it right you can't bring that under
[2:03:45] the blood it won't stay you can't bring
[2:03:47] it something won't let you do it when
[2:03:50] yourself is completely totally brought
[2:03:54] under the blood there'll be a total
[2:03:56] Deliverance then you'll have a freedom
[2:03:59] woo like you've never known before when
[2:04:01] everything's brought under the blood
[2:04:03] brought in submissive to the kingdom of
[2:04:06] God then there'll be a real Deliverance
[2:04:09] all Jesus's work was complete when that
[2:04:12] man met Jesus he was completely
[2:04:15] delivered he wasn't part delivered he
[2:04:17] was totally delivered all Jesus Works
[2:04:20] was complete everything was complete

[2:04:43] for us to live under privileged people
[2:04:46] there's no need for us to live in a
[2:04:48] defeated State because he defeated the
[2:04:52] and took all the principalities and
[2:04:55] powers and subdued them under his
