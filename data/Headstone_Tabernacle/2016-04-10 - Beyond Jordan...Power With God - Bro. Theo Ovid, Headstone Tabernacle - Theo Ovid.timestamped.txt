[19:25] 2:6 to 15 and Elijah said unto him T I
[19:29] pray thee here for the Lord had sent me
[19:31] to Jordan and he said as this as the
[19:33] Lord live it and as I saw live it I will
[19:36] not leave thee and they went and they
[19:38] too went on and 50 of the sons of the
[19:41] prophets went and stood to view far off
[19:44] and they stood by Jordan Elijah took his
[19:46] mantle wrapped it together and smoked
[19:48] the
[19:49] waters and they were divided hither and
[19:51] thither so that they two went over on
[19:53] dry ground came to pass when they were
[19:56] gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha
[19:59] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[20:02] taken away from thee and Elijah said I
[20:05] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[20:07] Spirit be upon me and he said thou has
[20:11] ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou

[20:47] fell from him and went back and stood by
[20:51] the bank of Jordan and he took the
[20:53] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[20:56] smoked Waters and said where is the Lord
[20:58] God of Elijah and when he had smitten
[21:01] the waters they parted hither and
[21:03] thither and Elisha went over and when
[21:07] the sons of the prophets which were to
[21:09] view Jericho saw him they said the

[54:46] off Jesus everybody news history but
[54:50] that a changing what God think about
[54:52] Moses that doesn't change what God
[54:54] purposes has for Moses life
[54:57] and whatever you have done that does not
[55:00] change God's
[55:03] purpose
[55:04] about your
[55:07] life the pastor can stop it the Elder
[55:10] can stop it Deacon can stop it your past
[55:13] can't stop it your sins can't even stop
[55:18] it because God
[55:21] said my word hallelujah shall not
[55:26] return unto me void so once he sends his
[55:31] word out it's good as done thy word is
[55:35] settled
[55:36] forever in the heavens God settled that
[55:40] word concerning you the devil is
[55:44] finished this morning you're going to
[55:46] get a breakthrough I feel it going to be
[55:49] now right now this service the devil is
[55:52] finished this morning power going to
[55:55] come into your life I believe it that's
[55:59] why I'm preaching it we have to get
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:10] it oh let's go further hallelujah
[56:13] hallelujah I can't believe this have to
[56:16] believe
[56:18] it Hallelujah we were speaking about all
[56:20] the Mysteries that to be revealed to the
[56:22] bride when he went down the road
[56:28] he said now have anybody got a revised
[56:29] version of the Bible he said the eagle
[56:33] the messenger of the loud easn church
[56:34] age Russian 10: 1-7 he said he come down
[56:37] he put one foot upon the land one foot
[56:40] upon the
[56:41] sea and then time shall be no more and
[56:44] when he did seven Thunders utter the
[56:47] voices and when the seven tunders UT the
[56:49] voices John said I was about to write he
[56:51] said don't write it he sealed it amen
[56:54] there's a part I want to get to
[56:56] someone say
[56:58] well that Seven Seals then brother
[57:00] brandham talk about the seven Thunders
[57:02] that Seven Seals speaking about what
[57:04] just talk about
[57:06] there7 will be reveal in the last days
[57:09] are you
[57:10] ready some great mystery how we get
[57:15] closer to God Amen hallu that's a
[57:21] question here the answer no sir it can't
[57:25] be it's whosoever shall take one word
[57:28] from the Bible or add one word to it his
[57:30] part will be taken off from The Book of
[57:31] Life what it is is a revelation on what
[57:36] has been missed back there amen it's
[57:39] already wrote but it's to reveal what
[57:43] has already been
[57:45] written that is what the Thunders is
[57:48] about now the reason I presented that to
[57:51] you is to
[57:53] identify that the revelation of the
[57:55] seven t
[57:58] do is not the key how to get closer to
[58:01] God in that sense so in other words the
[58:04] Thunders doesn't make you bypass
[58:07] [Music]
[58:10] Jordan here the question again them
[58:13] Seven Seals will be revealed some great
[58:17] mystery how we get closer to
[58:24] God hallelujah am he said no it's to
[58:29] reveal what's hid what's written that's
[58:33] what that is about but God has revealed
[58:35] how to get closer to him by Faith by
[58:38] virtue by knowledge by Temperance by
[58:41] Patience by Jordan so in other words the
[58:44] seven Thunders can't make you bypass
[58:47] [Music]
[58:49] death people believe saying seven thund
[58:52] seven Faith or what that that what what
[58:55] that means no Jord that means no death
[58:58] no dying out no crucifixion when God
[59:01] took a prophet and God took away his
[59:04] wife God took away his child God took
[59:08] away the anointing God Dro a black sheat
[59:10] over him and he was that Elijah and if
[59:14] God could take a son to through all of
[59:16] that and when B was preaching adoption
[59:18] he would say he was just testing me
[59:21] going through it it doesn't look like
[59:23] test but he was just testing me because
[59:25] he said he Elisha got about 10 years to
[59:28] fit into the mantle God not cutting the
[59:30] mantle to fit you God cutting you to fit
[59:33] the mantle the mantle have the size cut
[59:36] shape already is you have to get cut it
[59:39] took Elijah some time to grow to meet
[59:42] the mantle that is why that particular
[59:45] time he could said praise God stay here
[59:48] stay here stay here to see what's in
[59:50] that man to see if he will go past stay
[59:53] here stay here stay here amen I am not
[59:56] staying until I meet up to what God
[1:00:00] purpose and predestination for my life I
[1:00:03] am not staying
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:07] anywhere notice there was no friends
[1:00:10] around him there was no family with him
[1:00:13] there was no brother sister mother
[1:00:15] husband no no no no just Elisha alone
[1:00:19] and that is how they must come to you
[1:00:22] got to be caught
[1:00:23] alone like Jacob
[1:00:28] Jacob sent his family here his wife here
[1:00:30] this one here that one here his property
[1:00:32] here all his things here and he was
[1:00:34] caught alone am God wanted that and some
[1:00:38] of you still not alone CU your cell

[1:02:00] make time to connect with your God we
[1:02:04] need that connection we need that
[1:02:08] empowerment you see this be system
[1:02:12] making
[1:02:16] magic if the people from long ago come
[1:02:18] now and they see what's happening you
[1:02:20] know what they say
[1:02:24] witchcraft you put a car in a machine
[1:02:26] and money come
[1:02:28] out that's
[1:02:30] witchcraft Hallelujah you take something
[1:02:33] to your air and put it and talking to
[1:02:34] somebody else miles away

[1:02:59] they will see now is like we doing magic
[1:03:02] well that is what the be system is
[1:03:04] supposed to do produce Miracles Powers
[1:03:08] relying on Science and Technology there
[1:03:12] is no need for
[1:03:15] [Applause]
[1:03:18] God long time you need translation power
[1:03:21] to move amen far distances like Phillip
[1:03:25] now you could take a taxi or a maxi or
[1:03:29] airplane long time was different it was
[1:03:32] power that was the church needed it was
[1:03:35] power they was calling for not man power
[1:03:39] power from on high not man of the hour
[1:03:42] coming to bring some revelation we had
[1:03:46] 40 plus years of
[1:03:52] thatall it's the power of God Amen and
[1:03:56] Paul Paul said it this way when I come
[1:03:57] among you I come among you with weakness
[1:03:59] and fear and trembling that your faith
[1:04:01] may not rest in the wisdom of man but in
[1:04:05] the power of God so he didn't want them
[1:04:09] to get get caught up in his intellectual
[1:04:12] capacity to reveal Mysteries and word he
[1:04:14] wanted them to be get caught up in the
[1:04:16] God that was behind the intellectual
[1:04:19] stuff that he was presenting that when
[1:04:21] he walk away they will have faith in the
[1:04:23] God that he presented by the the word
[1:04:27] because the power was in
[1:04:29] God understand this all these things
[1:04:31] could be preached without power all the
[1:04:34] Mysteries could be preached without
[1:04:36] inspiration it could be study and just
[1:04:38] plain intellect humans speaking but when
[1:04:42] God begin to move the Bible talk about
[1:04:44] men of old moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:47] that's different that's
[1:04:51] [Applause]
[1:04:53] different I would hate to think that I'm
[1:04:57] doing this not inspired amen hallelujah
[1:05:00] just intellectual just studying a man
[1:05:01] reading understand what the priest say
[1:05:03] do College of theology do breaking down
[1:05:06] Greek and and and all kind of all kind
[1:05:08] of mysteries and things inside of there
[1:05:09] and they will come and elct you and so
[1:05:11] on you ever went to a Catholic sermon
[1:05:13] for a funeral very
[1:05:16] polished and then they have this
[1:05:17] Sacrament and have this the sacrament
[1:05:19] and they smoking up and they're smoking
[1:05:22] up when they finish there it look so
[1:05:26] classy but that's just plain intellect
[1:05:29] God not in that God not inspiring that
[1:05:33] but we have to see God coming to inspire
[1:05:37] the word to us that's why you need to be
[1:05:40] in the spirit that the spirit could
[1:05:42] reveal himself to you and bring
[1:05:44] Revelation to you so when you leave here
[1:05:46] you leave will prevail in power it
[1:05:48] doesn't change a situation at home it
[1:05:50] doesn't change whatever it is but it
[1:05:52] changes you
[1:05:55] because you are the object of God to
[1:05:58] change the devil trying to give you
[1:06:01] sight
[1:06:03] shows that's why I hate blaming prise
[1:06:06] God I like when people own
[1:06:08] up God hallelujah notice what the angel
[1:06:11] asked Jacob what's your name who are
[1:06:16] you Jacob say I'm I'm a
[1:06:19] businessman very wealthy one at that
[1:06:22] amen amen you know I I deserve a break
[1:06:24] no Hallelujah he didn't say that he was
[1:06:26] a
[1:06:29] schemer I don't think people really
[1:06:32] understand that you
[1:06:34] know you about Jacob and Jacob and Jacob
[1:06:37] but you don't know how much people
[1:06:39] mother father brother he's everybody
[1:06:44] you if if you really understand Jacob
[1:06:46] you wouldn't want to talk with them
[1:06:48] because you'll be watching the pocket
[1:06:49] you'll be watching you
[1:06:51] you you can't trust him amen amen
[1:06:56] because he will rip you off with your
[1:06:58] eyes
[1:06:59] open that's Jacob and God said Jacob I
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:05] love we not going on Esau he hate not
[1:07:08] we're not going there we just sticking
[1:07:09] with the real
[1:07:10] thing
[1:07:13] Jacob I
[1:07:15] love what did God see in
[1:07:17] Jacob he had a
[1:07:19] desire for the
[1:07:21] birthright oh Hallelujah
[1:07:24] [Applause]
[1:07:28] prise God so do you understand amen you
[1:07:32] cannot bypass the life of Jesus Christ
[1:07:38] by Mysteries by knowledge by
[1:07:42] information by teachings you still have
[1:07:46] to get to the life because the prophet
[1:07:49] said that's the Thunder am that shakes
[1:07:55] hallu
[1:07:56] the
[1:07:56] devil not not the coat no no the life
[1:08:01] that's the Thunder because see Satan get
[1:08:03] in contact with power already you know
[1:08:05] and it sing him when Jesus give him his
[1:08:08] vult he can't forget
[1:08:11] that you ever get put your hand in a
[1:08:13] socket and get shock there some people
[1:08:16] now don't like to touch anything
[1:08:17] electrical because they were shocked
[1:08:19] before that is what Satan got from Jesus
[1:08:23] he was shocked with a vault from is
[1:08:26] written he got that and he getting it
[1:08:28] again that is why he'll be so mad at
[1:08:31] those who remain because the bride will
[1:08:34] give him a shock he don't understand who
[1:08:37] you are he don't even believe who you
[1:08:40] are how could he believe
[1:08:42] it Jacob
[1:08:45] you trickster
[1:08:47] you how could he believe that you are
[1:08:50] going to be
[1:08:53] changed you are
[1:08:56] history that he knows but you have a
[1:08:59] history that God
[1:09:01] knows which history is right your
[1:09:05] history is already in
[1:09:07] [Applause]
[1:09:10] God Oh Glory Hallelujah don't let the
[1:09:13] devil open his his history book go back
[1:09:16] in God's book that's why the angel came
[1:09:19] with the open book to reveal who you
[1:09:21] really are not your flesh history your
[1:09:25] genetic God
[1:09:27] history where you come from God you're
[1:09:29] going back to God listen with the power
[1:09:32] of God you would slap up those trials
[1:09:35] you would crush the things that
[1:09:37] on you would walk on
[1:09:40] water you would walk on your situation
[1:09:44] you will stop feeling weak weak weak and
[1:09:47] say I am strong strong strong
[1:09:56] we stop that oh
[1:10:00] Hallelujah okay let's go a little
[1:10:02] forward we going
[1:10:04] slow but
[1:10:08] sure I'm not hurry I'm
[1:10:11] fine I'm fine amen for marriage of the
[1:10:14] Lamb are you
[1:10:16] ready so many
[1:10:19] say if the Lord will take this evil
[1:10:22] spirit from
[1:10:23] me from drinking

[1:10:51] you must be willing to lay it
[1:10:54] down you see she has made herself ready
[1:10:57] I like that you see God could not push
[1:11:01] us through a little pipe pull us out the
[1:11:04] other end and then say blessed is he
[1:11:07] that overcome it Hallelujah you had
[1:11:10] nothing to overcome Hallelujah he just
[1:11:12] push you through but you have got to
[1:11:15] make decisions
[1:11:17] yourself I have to make decisions for
[1:11:21] myself and in doing that we show our
[1:11:24] faith

[1:11:52] do you see on a Friday people like to go
[1:11:54] online and go and relax yourself let's
[1:11:56] call a perit on Friday see what

[1:12:21] table and God going to bless you and

[1:16:47] come with a catholism what did they do
[1:16:49] they built a little fence we are
[1:16:50] lutherans this is it they built a little
[1:16:53] fence then Wesley come what they say
[1:16:56] they build a fence this is it and the
[1:16:58] light move on Pentecostal SW what they
[1:17:00] do Wesley and all them build fences he
[1:17:04] said we cannot do that amen
[1:17:07] we cannot do that Hallelujah we have got
[1:17:12] to follow here we go are you ready we
[1:17:14] got to follow every day every hour of
[1:17:18] the day amen every step of the way amen
[1:17:21] we have got to be led by the Lord Jesus
[1:17:23] Christ amen if we don't we take on an
[1:17:28] organizational life
[1:17:30] Hallelujah and a life that doesn't
[1:17:32] follow Christ daily is not
[1:17:35] worthy remember organization is Mark of
[1:17:38] the Beast and that's why I tell you
[1:17:41] people talking on behalf of the church
[1:17:42] they have a church life they don't have
[1:17:45] a real Christian life because the
[1:17:47] Christian Life you take up your cross
[1:17:49] daily Hallelujah not sundly I know
[1:17:52] that's not a word not monthly but but
[1:17:55] daily not Sunday the cross and time you
[1:17:58] go downstairs the cross off your back no
[1:18:00] you follow
[1:18:01] him daily and a life that doesn't follow
[1:18:06] Christ daily is not worthy a man that's
[1:18:09] a Christian on Sunday then goes to
[1:18:10] church and sit back and think he owns
[1:18:12] the church because he does this that the
[1:18:13] other and Monday will St and lie wom
[1:18:16] that will go out on the public beaches
[1:18:17] and upon the streets and More close on
[1:18:20] they take the spirit of the world that
[1:18:22] don't belong in the Church of the Living
[1:18:24] God praise the name of the Lord here is
[1:18:26] now this is sea time bright time the
[1:18:30] shock is dead the shocks are dried up
[1:18:32] Virgin word time not touched it's virgin
[1:18:35] virgin word and listen there will be no
[1:18:38] denominational man handling in the
[1:18:41] Virgin birth of the Bride she is
[1:18:44] commanded by God to come out of such so
[1:18:47] the bride God will not allow the bride
[1:18:48] to be manhandled that's why God going to
[1:18:51] deliver the bride out of the spirit of
[1:18:54] man Hallelujah number six because the
[1:18:57] bride have to get the word from a
[1:18:59] husband oh Jesus here we go love this a
[1:19:03] Christian is not a tool or some kind of
[1:19:07] mechanical wrench to a great big
[1:19:09] religious regime a Christian is not some
[1:19:13] kind of tool that keeps a religious
[1:19:16] organization moving that's not a
[1:19:18] Christian a Christian is to be
[1:19:21] Christlike and a Christian cannot be a
[1:19:25] Christian until Christ come into the man
[1:19:27] am the Life of Christ in him then it
[1:19:32] produces the Life of Christ lived and
[1:19:35] you do the things that Christ did what
[1:19:37] am I talking about a personal
[1:19:39] relationship to Christ you come to
[1:19:42] church but do you have a relationship
[1:19:43] with Jesus Christ because that makes the
[1:19:45] whole difference it change your whole
[1:19:47] perspective that you are not alone you
[1:19:50] are connected to God oh hallelujah
[1:19:54] praise the name of the Lord Praise so
[1:19:57] there's only one way to get into the
[1:19:58] church that is by birth Christians you
[1:20:02] must have a personal relationship to God
[1:20:05] in order to be a Son of God you must
[1:20:07] become relations to God he must be your
[1:20:10] father in order for you to be a son and
[1:20:13] only his sons and daughters are saved
[1:20:15] not the members of the church but Sons
[1:20:17] and Daughters there's only one thing
[1:20:19] that can produce that and that's the new
[1:20:22] birth and if you are born again your
[1:20:24] entire nature is changed and God himself
[1:20:29] what you become a prisoner to him now
[1:20:31] you become a l prisoner other men can
[1:20:34] smoke the world can laugh make fun but
[1:20:37] you are prisoner to Christ other men can
[1:20:39] smoke and drink and carry on if they
[1:20:40] want to call themselves Christians
[1:20:42] deacons even preachers but not you
[1:20:44] you're prisoner you're prisoner to the
[1:20:47] word notice god making himself known we
[1:20:51] are not supposed to make convert to
[1:20:53] Christianity by government
[1:20:55] d by handing books and tapes and be
[1:20:57] bringing people to the Lord and whatnot
[1:20:59] watch he said now watch but by the
[1:21:02] Revelation that Christ is in you and God
[1:21:05] was in Christ and God was in Christ and
[1:21:07] Christ is in you and what God did in
[1:21:10] Christ Christ does in you so we not even
[1:21:12] supposed to make converts by government
[1:21:15] we supposed to make convert by
[1:21:16] Revelation isn't that right not by
[1:21:19] legalism don't cut your head don't do
[1:21:21] this don't do this we had that for 40
[1:21:23] plus years what has it brought it
[1:21:25] brought churches but where is the power
[1:21:27] of God manifested oh praise the name of
[1:21:30] the Lord do you believe that am what is
[1:21:33] it is being filled with the spirit him
[1:21:35] having the
[1:21:54] no other Church no other sign no other
[1:21:57] Fellowship no other government no other
[1:22:00] testimony no other Creed no denomination
[1:22:04] is accepted outside of this God accept
[1:22:06] nothing else but Christ in you may God
[1:22:10] help us here this morning to see the
[1:22:12] burden of the word that what God really
[1:22:15] trying to get is Christ in you the hope
[1:22:16] of glory you see God is not in this
[1:22:19] bishop youing a bishop over his people
[1:22:21] God in the pillar Fire coming inside of
[1:22:24] you hallelujah hallelujah remember the
[1:22:27] pillar fire above what God identify God
[1:22:29] above us then God With Us in Christ then
[1:22:32] his purp was to be in us the object was
[1:22:34] God to come in his people not man ruling
[1:22:37] over man but God ruling in man you being
[1:22:42] a powered son so God come and put a
[1:22:44] power generator inside of you and you
[1:22:46] begin to light up
[1:22:48] others power up others from your mouth
[1:22:51] others being empowered and then the
[1:22:54] whole all Kingdom being revolutionized
[1:22:57] by sons of God because that is what God
[1:22:59] want originally let us make man and and
[1:23:02] multiply and replenish isn't that right
[1:23:04] have dominion and multiply isn't that
[1:23:07] right upon the Earth So Adam was to
[1:23:09] reproduce other Sons so we have a
[1:23:11] kingdom of sons but then the devil
[1:23:14] injected himself and that's where we get
[1:23:16] the battle that we have this morning oh
[1:23:20] glory to God so brother says God accept
[1:23:22] nothing else but Christ in you the hope
[1:23:24] of glory the only thing that God
[1:23:25] recognizes is no Fellowship no church no
[1:23:28] Creed no denomination it is dead it is
[1:23:31] fragments that had to be cut off all
[1:23:33] this church thing and message and that
[1:23:35] had to be cut off it has to be powered

[1:42:36] right it has got to be the green it has
[1:42:38] got to be the same kind that went into
[1:42:40] the ground Jesus Christ the same
[1:42:42] yesterday and forever he had a promise a
[1:42:45] Spirit come upon the bride to do the
[1:42:48] same thing that he did it's reproducing
[1:42:52] again of the green
[1:42:54] so after brother bam came and left what
[1:42:58] we have to see is that green
[1:43:01] reproduced we have had the ministry of
[1:43:04] teaching the teach us and prophecy of
[1:43:07] what is to come but there comes an hour
[1:43:10] when a key is turned and the spirit
[1:43:12] begins to anoint to bring life to the
[1:43:15] seed and that will produce another grain
[1:43:18] again isn't that right we producing the
[1:43:21] grain same life same signs so the word Y
[1:43:25] young spake for itself this I'm see not
[1:43:27] a shock there is a secret of the message
[1:43:29] now the father's business the secret of
[1:43:31] the message is
[1:43:32] what the father's business and the
[1:43:34] father's business was to fulfill Isaiah
[1:43:36] of whom shall conceive fulfill what
[1:43:39] Isaiah said the lame shall leap like a
[1:43:40] heart the Lord th God shall raise up a
[1:43:42] prophit unto me it was the father's
[1:43:44] business then what is it now question we
[1:43:48] must be about the father's business the
[1:43:50] wheat would cry back the grain what must
[1:43:53] it do here we go vate Malachi 4 vate

[1:44:05] now we have when people see what's
[1:44:08] happening now they must say of a truth
[1:44:10] God sent a prophet because these are the
[1:44:12] children whose Hearts have been turned

[1:44:30] wonders with Miracles and there'll be no
[1:44:33] dispute about it they will have to say
[1:44:37] the spirit of

[1:45:11] take some more we now warming up
[1:45:15] Hallelujah all right let's go and talk
[1:45:18] about Jacob a little bit here now I love
[1:45:20] how B brought it out in his presence
[1:45:23] after Jacob wrestled all night and
[1:45:24] confessing his sins he called the place
[1:45:27] penal penel the word penal in the Hebrew
[1:45:30] means the face of almighty God Jacob had
[1:45:34] his name was Jacob which means a planter
[1:45:37] that's a deceiver had run all of his
[1:45:39] life away from
[1:45:41] God you hear that he run all his life
[1:45:46] away from God now if that was a Jacob in
[1:45:50] around that we know we say he he not a
[1:45:52] seed
[1:45:54] he ain't comeing to church he running
[1:45:55] running running running watch but he got
[1:45:59] a hold upon God I won't let him loose
[1:46:01] God we need more Jacobs amen he held on
[1:46:04] to the face of God in the presence of
[1:46:07] God he stayed until it was Sun up God
[1:46:09] said let me go the sun is arising he
[1:46:11] stayed in the face of God he went away
[1:46:14] Justified and saved what a great thing
[1:46:16] it was to know he had wrestled through
[1:46:19] that he had seen signs of God he had had
[1:46:22] dreams about God but this was one time
[1:46:25] he was in the face of God in the
[1:46:27] presence of God think of it friends as
[1:46:30] we hurry up in the presence of God a man
[1:46:33] is changed Jacob was changed now he
[1:46:36] could walk with God he was a different
[1:46:38] man that when he went up there the
[1:46:40] battle was now over yes sir he began to
[1:46:42] build an altar he hadn't been used to
[1:46:44] build an altars you know I tell you when
[1:46:46] you come in the presence of God you want
[1:46:49] to build an altar somewhere you want to
[1:46:51] find somewhere you can pray
[1:46:53] now Jacob was changed from Jacob to
[1:46:55] Israel a prince having power with God
[1:46:59] that is what happened to Jacob the
[1:47:01] deceiver are you ready the unrighteous
[1:47:04] the Unholy the deceiver he deceived his
[1:47:08] brother stole the birthright from his
[1:47:11] brother and a little dirty way of doing
[1:47:13] it such a deceiver he deceived his
[1:47:15] father-in-law put pop sticks and make
[1:47:17] speckled cares when the Cs being
[1:47:19] pregnated come here and look at it he
[1:47:21] deceive his mother
[1:47:23] he deceived his daddy he deceived his
[1:47:25] brother he was running everywhere he
[1:47:28] went always on a run from God he was on
[1:47:30] a run from his brother but when he come
[1:47:32] into the presence of God he recognized
[1:47:34] he was a sinner what did he do what did
[1:47:36] he do he seen his opportunity he had met
[1:47:40] something he didn't even think about
[1:47:42] before and he stayed there until all
[1:47:45] sins was gone amen God manages a way to
[1:47:49] get men in their presence and the made
[1:47:53] the decisions some of them run from him
[1:47:55] some run to him and if they're
[1:47:57] predestined to life they believe it they
[1:47:59] hang on to it the guy that confesses
[1:48:01] sins shall have pardon if you hide your
[1:48:04] sins you will not Prosper so Jacob you
[1:48:06] know the next day he met his brother
[1:48:08] Esau he didn't need no help from him
[1:48:10] then he didn't need armies he was in the
[1:48:14] business of building altars he wasn't
[1:48:16] afraid of Esau no more oh Hallelujah
[1:48:20] that contact with the angel
[1:48:23] that wrestling with God he didn't need
[1:48:25] no support no human support I need this
[1:48:29] one I need that one I need that I need
[1:48:31] that no you need
[1:48:32] God and God will bring and unfold all
[1:48:35] what you have need of David said I have
[1:48:38] set the Lord before me Psalm 168 that's
[1:48:41] a good thing to do I've set the Lord
[1:48:43] before me he wanted to be conscious of
[1:48:47] his presence so David said I have set
[1:48:50] the lord always before my face watch
[1:48:53] that's a good lesson for us tonight set
[1:48:55] the Lord before our face be conscious of
[1:48:58] his presence put him first put him first
[1:49:01] before you why then you won't sin when
[1:49:04] you realize that you are constantly in
[1:49:06] the presence of God when you realize God
[1:49:09] is WR you will watch what you say a man
[1:49:13] when he think God is gone he will cuss
[1:49:15] he would lust after woman he will steal
[1:49:18] he will cheat he would lie he will do
[1:49:20] anything when he think that God don't
[1:49:22] see him but bring him into the presence
[1:49:23] of God he will stop it right now amen
[1:49:26] and David said I have put the Lord all
[1:49:28] before me that's a good thing no wonder
[1:49:31] no wonder God said he was a man after
[1:49:33] his own heart man will do anything when
[1:49:36] God is near but when he realizes that
[1:49:38] God near and so forth oh Hallelujah so
[1:49:42] he said Jacob he watch old Jacob held on
[1:49:45] to all night he sure hold on a long time
[1:49:48] but when he surrendered himself when he
[1:49:50] got weak he couldn't hold on no longer

[1:50:06] Baptist let the Pentecostal be ashamed
[1:50:08] of themselves stop holding on and yield
[1:50:11] to the spirit it was then Jacob become a
[1:50:14] prince of God the Bible said become a
[1:50:16] prince his name was changed remember he
[1:50:19] was a great strong man on this side
[1:50:21] intellectually aul but on the other side

[1:56:19] the glad came out with his intellect
[1:56:20] what David and said am I a da I'll feed
[1:56:22] him to the birds and David watch him
[1:56:24] with outter sword and I'll cut your head
[1:56:26] off that big talk I'll cut your head off
[1:56:28] Bible said David ran to meet him that's
[1:56:31] how positive that's
[1:56:33] how that's how anointed that's how
[1:56:37] inspired David didn't walk David ran he
[1:56:41] already had the victory he just had to
[1:56:49] manifest glory to God that's what we are
[1:56:53] talking
[1:56:54] about you want be seated understand
[1:56:56] there's thousands and thousands of
[1:56:57] people in the Army not a man move this
[1:57:00] boy who wasn't qualified this boy who
[1:57:02] was under the age of to be in the Army
[1:57:04] he was running down to Mid
[1:57:08] Goliath what would make him do
[1:57:12] that he was
[1:57:15] Fearless
[1:57:17] Hallelujah you didn't get that he was
[1:57:20] fearless and the say in the face of a
[1:57:23] giant that nobody ever conquered David
[1:57:26] was Fearless no want to say something to
[1:57:28] you but say rise up you sons of God be
[1:57:32] Fearless have no fear in going towards
[1:57:35] your
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:39] promise we challenge fear Upon Your Life
[1:57:44] come out of that fear this wouldn't work
[1:57:47] this not going to work this not going to
[1:57:49] happen forget it it will happen
[1:57:56] you may be see some of you have fear you
[1:58:00] fear this going to work out fear
[1:58:02] that I saw a statement a man made about
[1:58:05] failure he said his company is the right
[1:58:07] place to fail because they have plenty
[1:58:09] failures he said because anytime you try
[1:58:11] experiment if you know it going to work
[1:58:13] it's not an
[1:58:16] experiment experiment could pass
[1:58:18] experiment could fail we not even
[1:58:20] experimenting we by Revelation amen is a
[1:58:24] faith it's something that God break upon
[1:58:26] your soul amen oh Hallelujah we not
[1:58:29] experimenting if God say he going to
[1:58:30] heal you he going to heal you the devil
[1:58:33] is a liar God going to heal you go
[1:58:34] deliver you deliver you and yet after
[1:58:37] that look where I'm talking about
[1:58:38] healing somebody have a tumor somebody
[1:58:40] have a cancer they prayed for after they
[1:58:42] prayed for now the spirit and the tumor
[1:58:44] or cancer leaves and the body of flesh
[1:58:46] is still there without the spirit in it
[1:58:48] and then it start to circulate in the
[1:58:50] system that to feel bad and sick and
[1:58:52] they start to feel that not really heal
[1:58:53] and what not then the Spirit come back
[1:58:55] right back he said he tell them when you
[1:58:57] are prayed for and you feel sick he said
[1:59:00] that your
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:02] heal you got to teach them how to keep
[1:59:05] the healing how to understand what has
[1:59:07] been going on with their system because
[1:59:08] the devil job is to keep you in unbelief
[1:59:11] keep you out of faith God job is to
[1:59:13] bring you into Faith that's why say if
[1:59:14] God deliver you it will take Faith to
[1:59:16] keep that off of
[1:59:17] you you could be delivered in the
[1:59:19] service today but it will take Faith to
[1:59:21] keep that Deliverance that breakthrough
[1:59:23] to keep whatever God bless you with to
[1:59:25] keep that it will take Faith you can't
[1:59:27] go back and do the same thing and it's
[1:59:29] not legalism really is if you break the
[1:59:32] laws of God they get in
[1:59:34] trouble God want to keep you blessed so
[1:59:38] he don't want to go here he don't want
[1:59:39] you to do this he don't want you to do
[1:59:41] that in order for you to be
[1:59:43] [Applause]
[1:59:45] blessed is not God trying to regulate
[1:59:48] you in that sense God trying to say
[1:59:50] listen I have certain laws if keep it in
[1:59:52] those laws your blessing will flow
[1:59:53] freely you break those laws you get in
[1:59:55] trouble oh blessed be the name of the
[1:59:58] Lord let me see if we can wrap up here
[2:00:00] praise God so much hallelujah oh my so
[2:00:03] David went there that's the matter today
[2:00:05] God got a lot of sheep that going on
[2:00:07] astray the organization and things have
[2:00:09] stole them out and brought them out in
[2:00:11] Psychology God give us Davids with the
[2:00:14] word of God and the power of God to
[2:00:16] direct it when we go to these
[2:00:17] intellectual Giants with all their PHD
[2:00:19] whatever it might be give me the word
[2:00:22] and the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we
[2:00:24] can slay every Giant on the field that's
[2:00:27] all we need today the word and the Holy
[2:00:30] Ghost and every Giant on the field going
[2:00:32] to be challenged and be slained
[2:00:35] Hallelujah so today we know we need a
[2:00:37] Revival we know we need a stiring
[2:00:39] amongst the people it will not take a
[2:00:41] doct of divinity it will take weak
[2:00:43] Hallelujah that will take the word of
[2:00:45] God in the power of the resurrection of
[2:00:47] Christ and slay this thing it will bring
[2:00:48] Christ to the country it will let them
[2:00:50] see he can still Open the Eyes of the
[2:00:52] blind heal the sick raise the dead he
[2:00:55] God is a conqueror we need a David
[2:00:58] untrained in theological schools we need
[2:01:00] a man who knows nothing about that just
[2:01:03] a plow boy some little guy with stoop
[2:01:05] shoulders not much to look at come
[2:01:07] walking down the road with the power of
[2:01:10] God hallelujah how many ministers could
[2:01:13] God use this morning if they only let
[2:01:15] God bind them with his word or with his
[2:01:18] power and loose them from the strength
[2:01:19] of the denomination and organization how
[2:01:22] many sincere people in the city this
[2:01:23] morning that goes to Great organization
[2:01:25] churches how many could he filled with
[2:01:27] the Holy Ghost and set the country of
[2:01:28] fire with the gospel and the power if
[2:01:31] they only take and loose themselves from
[2:01:34] the power that have them Bound by his
[2:01:36] Spirit to be like Paul was a love slave
[2:01:38] to godj God took Paul and made a slave
[2:01:41] out of him bound him to himself sent him
[2:01:44] to the Gentiles which he
[2:01:47] hated you hear that God take his power
[2:01:51] bind Paul to his power and send him to
[2:01:54] the Gentile which he
[2:01:56] hated but you see here we go he had to
[2:01:59] be loosed from his ecclesiastical power
[2:02:02] to be bound to the power of
[2:02:04] God do you understand that these
[2:02:07] churches out there both in the message
[2:02:10] and out the message have a
[2:02:12] power but call ecclesiastical power that
[2:02:16] binds the people amen amen amen but a
[2:02:20] power is coming to unbind them
[2:02:25] oh
[2:02:29] my way he had to lose his strength and
[2:02:33] become weak and nothing in order to
[2:02:35] receive the strength of God to be bound
[2:02:37] to God to do what God would tell him to
[2:02:39] do here is something to console us
[2:02:41] here's something that encourages out of
[2:02:43] weakness and humility God chooses the
[2:02:46] people the B his kingdom out of if we
[2:02:48] ever get to heaven if you ever stand in
[2:02:51] the presence of God in his church we
[2:02:53] will stand in a bunch of people have
[2:02:55] been weak rejected cast out of the world
[2:02:58] and know nothing a rabbit can run a
[2:03:00] squirrel can get in a tree a dog can
[2:03:02] bite a Lon can tear a horse can kick a
[2:03:05] bird can fly but a sheep stand helpless
[2:03:08] that's the way God wants us realize that
[2:03:10] we are totally insufficient then God can
[2:03:13] take that person and begins to mold
[2:03:15] himself into that person make his hands
[2:03:18] do what God would have hands to do make
[2:03:20] his lips speak what God lips would speak
[2:03:22] because they're not his they're Gods he
[2:03:24] begin to build a character and begin to
[2:03:27] take his weakness and to make his own
[2:03:29] self God's side is weak and humble
[2:03:32] that's God's opportunity that's God's
[2:03:34] way of getting to us is when we are weak
[2:03:38] amen say that again preacher that's
[2:03:40] God's opportunity that is God's way of
[2:03:43] getting to us when we are weak say that
[2:03:46] again preacher that's God's opportunity
[2:03:49] that's God's we have get to us when we
[2:03:51] are weak
[2:03:52] we get something then the problem is we
[2:03:55] are too strong so God had to do
[2:03:57] something to break you come on and
[2:04:00] weaken you that he can get to you oh
[2:04:03] glory to God praise God this encourages
[2:04:07] of course because God whole kingdom is
[2:04:10] built out of these kind of people amen
[2:04:13] then when you get that kind of way you
[2:04:15] are in his kingdom the case is that we

[2:04:20] too Str stronge headed we're too strong
[2:04:22] in our head we know too

[2:07:59] his flight again we could operate in a
[2:08:02] home and it's not a Christian home it's
[2:08:05] not a Christian environment because the
[2:08:06] holy spirit is not really there because
[2:08:08] fussing is carrying on and whatnot we
[2:08:10] not looking to the Lord your husband do
[2:08:12] the wife do the children do the neighbor
[2:08:14] do and all this is humans you're not

[2:08:25] spirit of God because a home could run
[2:08:27] without the Holy Ghost you know
[2:08:30] understand this people could live their
[2:08:31] life without God you know and be
[2:08:34] prosperous and have a good home and good
[2:08:36] marriage and God not
[2:08:38] there just normal human being grow live
[2:08:42] and
[2:08:43] die that's not you you are called to be
[2:08:47] of God and the devil knows that amen he
[2:08:51] sees a light over you and try to out
[2:08:53] that so that's why he's in your marriage
[2:08:55] in your whatever in your life that's why
[2:08:57] there's so much
[2:08:59] attacks because of who you

[2:09:06] are
[2:09:12] Hallelujah hear him he will do the same
[2:09:16] okay talk about Jesus he adopt his own
[2:09:18] son he will do the same if you stand
[2:09:21] here we go after you receive the Holy
[2:09:23] Ghost and make yourself a
[2:09:28] Christian it doesn't have a pill that we
[2:09:30] hand out after service and say take two
[2:09:32] pill and that makes you a Christian a
[2:09:35] gospel and take that and make you a
[2:09:38] Christian you grow into Christ you
[2:09:41] become a Christian you make yourself a
[2:09:45] Christian you respect your husband
[2:09:47] because the word said that you humble
[2:09:50] yourself in the whole because the word
[2:09:52] said that you respect your parents
[2:09:53] because the word said that you love your
[2:09:57] wife because the word teaches that amen
[2:10:00] am hallelujah praise God isn't that
[2:10:02] right you choose to obey the word
[2:10:05] hallelujah and that is what makes you a
[2:10:07] Christian by your choice and by your
[2:10:09] action and by your life and God
[2:10:11] recognizes that because thou has chosen
[2:10:14] you have walked in your own choosing you
[2:10:16] have picked the precise and correct
[2:10:18] decision it is my way you choose the
[2:10:21] road that you're walking on it's the
[2:10:23] harder way but it's God's way God going
[2:10:25] to bless you because you choose the
[2:10:27] harder
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:32] way look at Elijah and Elisha I like the
[2:10:36] last one he said the Lord sent me to
[2:10:38] Jordan stay
[2:10:40] here there's your last
[2:10:42] chance your last chance to stay where
[2:10:46] you are stay put no to follow me all the
[2:10:50] way and that man said no way I'm going
[2:10:53] all the way
[2:10:56] Hallelujah I wonder if we have people
[2:10:58] here like that this morning want to go
[2:11:00] all the
[2:11:02] way how can the church the Pentecostal
[2:11:05] Church the Methodist Baptist Church be
[2:11:07] adopted until they come to
[2:11:09] discipline we've got to be disciplined
[2:11:11] first Hallelujah God could not trust
[2:11:15] this power with the church
[2:11:21] am I didn't expect any big amen for
[2:11:24] that how could God release power and
[2:11:26] there's no
[2:11:28] discipline these bunch of jokers that
[2:11:30] have how God could just let power upon
[2:11:32] them they don't have power and look at
[2:11:34] the
[2:11:37] behavior think about it now look at the
[2:11:40] behavior of churches pastors and
[2:11:42] whatever it is without
[2:11:44] power it's so off the beaten part much
[2:11:48] as if God put Power on that
[2:11:51] that's why few will be adopted because
[2:11:53] few will come into discipline few would
[2:11:56] come into
[2:11:57] character oh Hallelujah because that's
[2:11:59] what God wants to use character How
[2:12:02] could a father trust his business with a
[2:12:04] boy that might pollute his whole
[2:12:07] inheritance so that's why the Bible said
[2:12:09] though he's a son he is not get
[2:12:11] inheritance until the appointed time you
[2:12:15] don't take the inheritance and give it a
[2:12:16] little child you say when he reach age
[2:12:18] 21 or when he reached 18 He will get
[2:12:21] this and that the other he's 7 years now
[2:12:23] you don't give him now you you put
[2:12:25] something in the in in the document
[2:12:27] Satan when he reached this age he will
[2:12:29] get all of this that's what God does
[2:12:33] when he reach the stature he get all of
[2:12:34] this get poken with power witness and
[2:12:38] power holy ghost power anointed power
[2:12:41] manifestation son the power Oh Glory to
[2:12:44] God so we could preach that we blew in
[2:12:46] the face we still have to get
[2:12:49] character we could teach Mysteries
[2:12:51] preach Mysteries hand out Mysteries but
[2:12:54] we still have to get
[2:12:56] character character connects with
[2:13:01] power Oh
[2:13:03] Glory
[2:13:04] Hallelujah and but pains I can't stop
[2:13:08] now I'm in a gear I'm teaching this
[2:13:11] morning in bird pains he talk about the
[2:13:14] chicken in the egg amen call it pimping
[2:13:17] yes nature have it you have to you has
[2:13:19] to pip his way out if he try to break
[2:13:21] the shell off it will kill him he has
[2:13:24] got to labor there we go he has got to
[2:13:27] Strain To Break Forth that's the way a
[2:13:30] Christian has to do it ain't somebody
[2:13:32] shaking your hand taking you in you have
[2:13:35] got to lay there till you die wreck and
[2:13:38] are born into the kingdom of
[2:13:41] God I want to hear bigger amen than that
[2:13:45] you can't be that tired oh glory to God
[2:13:48] there's not a shouting jumping service
