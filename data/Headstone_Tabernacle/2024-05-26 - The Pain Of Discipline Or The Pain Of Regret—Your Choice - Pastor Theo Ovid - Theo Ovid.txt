hallelujah hallelujah father we pray praise you we bless your holy name this morning amen you may be seated for a few minutes I greet you this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning psalmist David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and uh how many were blessed with the youth service yesterday amen wonderful we had a wonderful time in the Lord yesterday and uh we thank God uh we had brother Andrew and brother Anthony speaking and what a tremendous blessing and I really want to encourage you Church uh make every effort to support our special services that are dedicated towards the young people but beyond just young people is really dedicated we taking some inspiration from all things that pertain unto life and godliness that this word this gospel this message that we preach contains all things he has given through his divine power access to all things that pertain un both life and godliness so I greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ I returned uh home on Friday evening from Lagos Nigeria so I bring greetings from Brother Olu and the local Christian Assembly Lagos they send their greetings they send their love they send their appreciation to you amen I had the opportunity Saturday before to participate in their youth service and then last Sunday I was able to minister uh at brother hu's Church in Lagos and then last Wednesday I was able to minister at brother DA's Church uh in Nigeria as well so we had a tremendous time so greetings from Brother da and his church over there as well they send their love they send their appreciation uh to you the Believers and to the church and it's a great time that we are living in uh I preached a message in brother U's Church uh speaking about the storms of life finding Fai in the midst of your storm and it's a message I preach here in the church about a year or so ago where we looked at Matthew 8 and Matthew 14 where we looked at the first time the disciples encountered a storm but the first storm they encounted Jesus was on the boat with them and in the midst of the storm as they were dealing with it they had to make that decision to wake Jesus but there was still this element of comfort because Jesus was on the boat with them so they had the Comfort to well if Jesus is here I don't think this boat is going down because he's on the boat and they were able to wake Jesus and when Jesus woke up he say oh you have little faith and he spoke to the storm he said peace be still and he addressed the storm itself and that led to the disciples saying what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Seas obey him and that was Matthew 8 but the real subject of what I brought was Matthew 14 which was a different situation there was another storm but this time Jesus was not on the boat the were on the boat on their own and many times in life God lets you go through trials and situations where it seems as if he's not there but he's watching and this time the Bible said he was watching from afar walking towards them and he's seeing them in their struggle and the expectation was I could imagine from the last time they say well the last time when Jesus came he spoke to the storm but this time he didn't touch the storm he didn't speak to the storm he didn't speak to the wind he didn't speak to the waves he spoke to them in the middle of their storm and the first thing he said to them was be of of good chair so your boat might be shaking your boat might be rocking your world might be upside down but God is saying to you be of good chair and in that entire lesson in Matthew 14 Jesus never touched the storm he was speaking to the individuals in the middle of your storm so it doesn't matter what storm you're going through this morning maybe in your storm Jesus is on your boat or maybe in your storm he's not on your boat but in either one of those those two storms God is going to make a way for you whether it's dealing with the situation around you or dealing with you in the middle of your situation God is going to get the glory he's going to get the honor and in this life we liveing we'll have our ups and downs we'll have our struggles and our battles we'll have our trials and temptations but some through the water some through the flood some through great child but all come through the blood so we thank God for his grace we thank God for his love we thank God for his unction that we can look at our situation and see God dealing with us in the middle of it because at the end of the day friends it's easy for us to say well God speak to this situation and speak to that situation but at the end of it God really wants to deal with us because the stronger you become is greater is he that's in you that's he that's in the world can the church say Amen so we had a tremendous time in the Lord and then on Wednesday night at brother Dees church I speak about the mystery of your spiritual identity whereby the BAM said if the bride gets to know who she is and when the bride gets to know know who she is then the Rapture is going to go so there's no Rapture without you having a revelation of who you are and who you are is tied to your spiritual identity you cannot walk into this thing you had to have been born into this thing you are not now deciding to come to this thing but because God placed you here and I asked a question to the church I said anybody chose their birthday is anybody in here choose your birthday did anybody choose what day you're going to be born in what family you were going to be born in what country going to be born in you have nothing to do with it when Prince Harry was born he didn't choose the family he was born into he didn't choose the day he was born he was he found himself here in a royal family and we are here this morning and we have found ourselves in a royal family we didn't choose the day we were born we didn't choose the family we were born into we didn't choose the country we were born into but we are here this morning by Divine decree the Lord himself put you in his royal family you are royal seeds of Abraham and because of who you are the purpose of God could never be defeated oh I feel Victorious this morning are you ready for the word this morning it's a great privilege and an honor to introduce to you your pastor this morning you appreciate your pastor oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah as he comes to the Pulpit this morning let us sing this song pass me not oh gentle savior I believe Jesus wants to pass by your way this morning I believe something is going to be said to stir your soul into action many of us we hear the word but I believe we have come to that point where the word has to move from the hearing stage to dropping down into your heart to drive us to action if the Lord were to pass by your house this morning your spiritual house 16 elements and minister to your need make sure you know what you need this morning all over the building not pass me [Music] by oh Pass Me Not [Music] see [Music] Jesus

budes just coming together in the same building but with your presence it changes everything your presence is sick can be healed hlj the blind can see the troubl that can be helped those in prison can be set tree you can minister to hearts and homes and lives you make can minister to our bodies Our Spirits or Souls come and Minister us today we wait on you uh we are needy of you father have your way I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you thanks for coming thanks for being here this morning and we just want to read three portion of scripture before I have your seats Hebrews 12 want to read 5 to1 Proverbs 3 want to read be 11 to2 and Proverbs 51-14 reading Hebrews 12:5 and he have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scored every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening God dealing with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the presence seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby proverb chapter 3 reading verse 11 and 12 my son despise not the chasing of the Lord neither be wary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correct it even as a father the son in whom he delighted and final scripture Proverbs Chapter 5 want to read from verse 11 and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed so this is a time of debt and see how have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproof and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor incline my ear to them that instructed me I was almost in an evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly let's pray father God we thank you for your word your word is life and truth without it we are finished we can't go anywhere your word only have life come and breathe life to us Lord and pour out your spirit and bring understanding wisdom and knowledge in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen be seated praise God hallelujah it's great to be here it's great to have brother Isaac back from his trip to Nigeria and to be a blessing you know um you ever statement some people light up a room every what some people line up a room when they go out of it and some people light up a room when they come into it but everybody lights up a room and it's powerful when you could become a blessing and for you to become a blessing God has to do something for you amen praise God so eight years ago Pastor ULU spoke a message the pain and the pleasure is the inside life remember I think was first I think it was our first convention or so here and he was speaking about the natural tendency to go for pleasure and the AV voice voidance of pain that's as human beings we tend to go towards the easy route then the easy as oppos just more comfortable there's no stress in that and that's why young people get caught up in gambling and in in in playing around and smoking and carrying on what up because that cool zesting and thing you know carrying on and like that so he talking about pain and pleasure but when you go for the pleasure you got pain after when you go for the pleasure you get the pain after so so we have choices to make and I had another message but this is what I had you know I couldn't put them together I wanted to do it together but it was just too much but I have a title this morning the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice you have to choose between these two pains right we had a powerful youth meeting yesterday I wouldn't call it a youth meeting I want to switch it to meetings of of things pertaining to life and godliness put in put into young people but anybody could come so what Andrew shared something of what uh keeps people into poverty partners with poverty partners with Rich is very interesting uh thought about that part of life and and part of this thing about poverty the Bible talk about sleep somebody loves sleep they tell them go and work they say you have a ling know God got go outside now they said that sleeping and overs sleeping will bring it to Poverty so poverty is connected to love of sleep because the man who diligent he will get somewhere but I'm not here to talk about that I'm here to speak about the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice you have to choose between these two pains now Matthew 11: 2030 Jesus speaks he said come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest come you're tired you're weary come take my yoke upon you and learn of me he did not say come and there is no yoke right he did not say that he said come I have a yoke I have something to put on you but I want to let you know I am meek and lonely in heart you shall rest find rest unto your souls for my yoke the one that I have is easy and my burden is light as compared to what the devil will put on you the one the devil put on you it will to be heavy but my yoke is easy and my burden going to be light choose your yoke choose your burden choose your pain because it has [Applause] that paying from discipline leads to growth and righteousness on now there are two kinds of pains one that brings discipline a one that brings regret it can be seen as Godly discipline as compared with the consequences of sin discipline may be painful in the moment but it leads to righteousness and peace now that scripture we read in Hebrews 12 and he Amplified it says for the time this amplifi vers 121 says for the time being no discipline brings Joy none whatever we talk to yourself easy correct yourself correct your easy p a Santa Claus Santa Claus hat and a Santa Claus beard and talk to you like Santa Claus it is still discipline it is still correcting it is still instructing and not everybody likes that Hebrews 12:11 for the time Amplified for the time being no discipline brings Joy but seems Grievious and painful all right but afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it a harvest of fruit which consist in righteousness in Conformity to God's will in purpose thought and action resulting in right living and right standing with God the proverbs we read Proverbs 3 said my son and and and as a Young Man serving the lord God called me age 17 this books of proverb was one of my key books it was it kept me as a young person it kept me in understanding the kind of woman it have out there it kept me in having a vision Proverbs have who could find a virtuous woman Proverbs have be seek after wisdom Proverbs have have disc have discernment Proverbs have everything pertaining to life pertaining how to live the Proverbs have the rebuke consider the ant how they does live they just toil they're not lazy Pro have all of that to correct your behavior and attitude you a born diligent you a born purposeful and whatnot you have to learn that Jesus said learn of me my yoke is easy my burden is light you come here to express what you think you come here to learn if you know already get out of here oh give the Lord some Praises when you come to church you come to learn you come to grow not get old and you're not changing oh give the Lord a shout are people getting old but they're not changing they're only getting old in the message all in church don't be all in church change in church oh give the Lord a shout in the house that is what we are preaching here you have to be changed amen or you could be like the woman she husband died and you say dead he never changed me but he dead God take him home into glory and you you you still to live with yourself that she boasting Wicked miserable he dead he never changed me yeah all right let's go Proverbs 312 the Amplified my son do not despise or shrink from the chasing of the Lord his correction by punishment or by subjection to suffering or trial neither be weary or impatient or loathed or abhor his Repro For Whom the lord loves not who love the Lord For Whom the lord loves he corrects Jes so you will see now it is foolish parenting all right not to correct your children if you think you love them by not telling them what they're supposed to know you acting stupid you're acting foolish because the Lord chasten and correct whom he love so when God love you he will put some blows on you he love you he would rebuke you he love you he will correct you he lovees you he would straighten you out and you going to love him loving you oh give the Lord some Praises oh this is good this morning if you cash out and there something wrong with you you know you feel God is a dotish or Dy grandparent he is not that he is God and he deserves respect he is God that's why he's straighten out Noah he's straighten out David he's straighten out Moses he's straighten out all his sons every son that come to God must be tried and it's foolish to say no mistakes has been made liar oh give the Lord a shout in the house oh give the Lord a shout in the house all have come short of the glory of God all have sinned there is none righteous no not one no not one no not one oh give the Lord some praises [Applause] men is men men have flaws men make mistakes Faith as we preached some other two Wednesday back is considered as righteousness we don't have righteousness is in ourselves the blood of Jesus faith God sees us as righteous when God told the devil about job he said there is none like him on the earth that's my man on the earth a righteous man and that righteous man was only offering sacrifice for his children per advented is sin he a know if they're sinning but Lord forgive them Lord I present a sacrifice Lord I got I offer this up per Advent here their sin and God saw that man as a righteous man oh give the Lord a shout you not righteous in your you are righteous through the blood of Jesus Christ faith in Jesus [Music] Christ and when you get that kind of Freedom you have the freedom to say I am wrong I am sorry Hallelujah I made a out I made a fool of myself and you can laugh at yourself too Give the Lord some Praises man feel good this morning that some people can laugh at theel because they're too proud they're stuck up that's why some people don't go nowhere because they want no mistakes they want to fall so they don't try nothing I preer to try and fall I prefer to try and fail than not try at all you're too slack you're too lazy you're too proud you're too arrogant get up from your condition oh give the Lord a shout people are not pressing because they're not aiming at nothing and if you don't know where you're going you'll get their real fast oh give the Lord a shout in the house I will say it again if you don't know where you're going you will get there real fast but when you know what you want when you know what you're going after when you know that great is he that's

is not flesh and blood you know remember it's against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness upon family and friends limited Glory don't think it's unbelievers out there know it's family and friends you know you say family Sarah doubting all the time Sarah get Revelation Abraham a revelation you see that I feel that child to come through here and guess what Abraham received that Revelation and now we have is and is Generations right now still giving trouble Galatians 6 says let him that is taught in the word all right communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things what is he saying there you are to communicate to the ministry here we share testimony from Sister atana on on in a prayer meeting she just shared something she was studying the word and some open I was such a blessing I didn't even have to ask her if I could say it it was just a blessing God I call it to be dumb now people like dumb you know because nobody know what going on under d but when you begin to express what is going on with you then you can get the help if you could help yourself you don't need to come to church here you could stay home and you know fix up and thing but if you come here you comeing for help and you that's how you have to see it I come needy that's why I wanted that song this morning pass me not to Gentle sa I start with that not to close off you know to start with I don't want God pass me here my humble cry and you but I I said we can't give you that cry we could preach the word to you but we can create the hunger in you some people lazy because it's a gift you give you don't want to work you don't want to press you don't want to this job small and God check in you to see if you you Faithful and little but you don't want little your big big big so and you are big thing and did not qualify for the big thing God said that you know he that is faithful in little it will be faithful in much God could trust you because he give you little to see how you can manage what you have then he can bless you abundantly because God want your cup to run over you know Hallelujah 30% say Amen unbelief hitting my back there I am saying to you God want your cup you see when you say thank you Lord for the little things so you have a little thing like if it's concentrated coffee concentrated thinging in in France in France when I went one time with coming with brother he take me to the restaurant and take order coffee when he come come small cup small when I put it in my mouth like it's whiskey or some kind that was a killer I said no no no not that he said oh American no want American coffee the one with long and one that tall but that thing is concentrated stuff I ain't qualified for that certain people could handle that not my I qualify for that American long coffee let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not mocked right for whatsoever a man swe it that shall reap the amplifi said do not be deceived and deluded and misled God here we go will not allow himself to be snared at scorned disdained or mocked by mere pretensions or professions or by his precepts being set aside Lord he inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God in for whatever a man know that and that only is what he will reap this is the Amplified so you w see it there and he who SWS to his own flesh lower nature sensuality Will from The Flesh reap Decay and ruin and destruction and that is a pardon to Poverty to sin because God can bless sin and Christians under different Covenant than them unbelieving people out there amen the unbelieving people can with their foolishness and have millions and whatnot and billions and whatnot that is them but you different you under a different Covenant so you can't behave like that they could rip off and cook it and do this and drugs and everything else but you can't you under that different thing all together do you get what we are saying this morning Hallelujah so sin is a asset to Poverty let us not lose heart and grow wary and faint in acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint that's right so then as occasion and opportunity open up to us here we go let us do good morally to all people not only by being useful or profitable to them but also doing what is for a spiritual good and Advantage be mindful to be a blessing to who especially to those of the household of faith those who belongs to God family with you the Believers in other words you should treat each other with extra because you your brother and sister belong to the household of faith you shouldn't be sitting down with an unbeliever gossiping about this church you shouldn't be sitting down with somebody outside of this church talking negative about what happened to this church that's wickedness who the capet wears it hallelujah hallelujah you can't do that the Bible say do not bring an accusation against an elder except you have two or three Witnesses and those Witnesses have to be tried it's not that your friend hey come come come you see that you see that come you see you see you see or you see say you see you to try the witnesses this one is a Scamp this one is a robber this one is a old thief and they come to give witness that can't work in the court in the natural Court in the court of God you must have witnesses Revelation 3:19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen because therefore and repent amen now as many as I love I rebuke and Chason to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction chasing does not mean to punish God don't punish his children God punishing me God punishing me a blight yeah you're blight because of what you doing go a punish you you punishing your own self as I said already if your house dirty do expect you're praying of an Angel oh angel of God righteous Angel bring down a broom in the angel with scratchy said what's he talking about angel would say I didn't make that mess that is your stuff get your broom and sweep in other words God put hands for you to work God put feet for you to move God put ears for it to hear is all up to you the choices are yours to make it in this world I say it um um work it out Bible say work make work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it's a shame people to complain about the father the mother the church and this one and that one you are you are lame in your excuse you are immature you still have to grow up some more when you come to the point where you have no excuses whatsoever then you recognize it's you and you alone you can't talk about your husband you can't talk about your son your wife your children you have to talk about [Applause] you when God told Abraham he was going to about to judge Sodom what did Abraham says he know lot down there he know that fights his men was fighting with him he know Lot leave and went toward Sodom and leave him to Sea desert he say Wicked bur him charge him you know say a confirmation of my word I told not to go down there Harden lot too difficult the family you Wicked God go show him who boss he go show him my word I spoke my all you you say it's all about you and God a bing with you but Abram as a Christian he said Lord if there's 50 righteous would you destroy it he said no because ABR begging for lot that's how you supposed to be come on come on come on pre back to me please pre to me somebody that is how you and I supposed to be bleeding [Applause] begging because no weapon form against you could Prosper because you're under Covenant you're under righteousness you're under blood but your brother in trouble your sister in trouble I didn't want to leave there him to die oh give the Lord some Praises Glory there the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah even them lepers sat down in front of the gate and said why sit be here and die oh give the Lord I shout you know the story the staring inside the city the lepers oh give the Lord a [Music] praise no nobody have feeding no lepers nobody Fellowship lepers the lepers had the own conference by theel listen Dy know if we stay here we dying too without a support without a orange without a apple without a grapes without a sandwich let us go to the enemy camp for adventure they kill us you go dead or they feed us we dying anyhow they see death so they see de so they see this here we know this this is guaranteed what behind me is guaranteed some Churches is De you know the only light is by the exit in churches in darkness you know the only light Shin is by the exit door for people to get out you know guaranteed go back there Darkness you know these guys say if we stay here we will die if we go the enemy we have a chance they decide to move move that's what faith does faith don't ever make you sit down where you are Oh Glory to God faith has put activity in your feet in your action in your words when they start to move God caused the enemy to hear a rumble some thunders start to roll glory to God Seven Thunders start to drop some voices start to rumble into the camp Camp of the enemy and them fellas say oh God like a bigger Army on us coming they drop the food they drop the pot they drop the peas they've dropped the roasted chicken the roasted turkey the roasted Co whatever they was roasting they drop it and run they leave their horses they leave their gold they leave their money and lepers coming we coming we coming we coming we are reach yet but we coming go go get the enemy to hear a noise we going in the enemy camp Oh Give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory Glory to God see that b you see what choices is this Choice make them when they reach so not a man inside food Hallelujah like food you go through this line is food because somebody is cooking this line soup this line this this line somebody seing about salad in this linee somebody just Macon pie just come off in this linee but Andy them guys start to eat had a h up there sit down the H the Rocko and then they start to repent they said this not right the city is starving we can have all this for ourselves they ran back in the city and say it's have food it have gold it have this what kind of Christians are we we sitting down dying that come somebody looking for the mother to do what the father to do and the father de and the mother dead and then they recognize they have to do do for themselves God told Joshua my servant Moses is dead take the people over he told a man who never did before Joshua never did that before take them across Jordan and and fight and then divide the land God could give us instructions of things we never did before what you will tell God gu somebody else now well we have not gone this way before who else God must use a lot of job it have presently did not exist 20 years ago now with this Char have something call a prompt engineer like somebody who ask questions what a title a prompt engineer that is insane but they have that so there are jobs there are things that going to come forward just like they have robots right now I think China have a whole Army of robots in factories and whatnot Robots coming for jobs artificial intelligence comeing for jobs secretaries are losing their work because they could dictate and say what to write to who and what and let the fix up and just sign the world is changing and if you don't change it will change all around you it's not waiting for you to understand the change it is changing but it cannot change outside of the prophecy so we have a clear Advantage because God will not hide from us what he's about to do so the gospel addresses Global issues the gospel addresses what is to be and how we have to be prepared for what is to be let me let me just continue quickly so this scripture here now so so so okay so chasing does not mean to punish it mean to discipline because the subject amendment in is in mind in other words God is hoping that people adjust yes their behavior and attitude that will come back in line that is why chasing comes to get you back in order all right so fathers of our flesh corrected us and we went through that right now no chasing for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness them that exercise by all right let's continue now let me just inject here just like in school in school you always have the miserable student who kicks in and carrying on and pelting behind the teacher and what not and who Pelt and Pelt and whatnot and it have some of them who bright and some of them who not so bright the bright ones could do that and get away because they're still learning the work home and they interrupting the class but the foolish ones who not do not so bright and pelting and disrupting class they keep them back themselves and there are those people that will be disciplined to study the exams pass the exams and later on in life their Engineers their doctors they whatever they career part and the one who miss out on that they just fall back amen so it proves all over in the natural and the spiritual discipline is painful but it have a a fruit with it or a reward with it it come like how the Bible talk about uh children obey parents let's take that right now what you find them children fighting especially now they're fighting against parents and so on but there's a blessing to obey a parent am you see so when you do that even the parents not worthy to be obeyed or what when you when you get them that respects and so on God blesses you for the part that you are playing you cannot say well the reason I bust his head the reason I py stone is because he did no that is not it but Andrew talk about a soft answer turn with rat that's what the Bible say you proven your point by opening your mouth loud and shouting and like that you you taking the word you know a soft answer the wife in a mod or the husband in a mode and you want to be mod too and then two people in the mode and you know what happened there's a big big mode going on there now but if one person pull back soft answer turn away R you recognize it cannot continue like that if the husband in a funny mode and you answer Softly As a wife he feel foolish because it would look like if o what that called for you're carrying on carrying on it's like I see somebody kill a cockroach and pow it's a cockro not not so not not so think de great not so so that is how it appears when you come with the soft answer and and that person will feel foolish with their crazy H response then next thing is a smile I don't know where what people have a gift of grump um but a smile is a beautiful thing and sometime just you walk in an office smiling and you make people smile too but you walk with a hard face anybody hard face andbody joining in the club but you don't want to be like that light up the [Applause] world I remember gotting sick had something all over my skin and so on and I was walking so and it was painful and thing and somebody said oh God look at he and he's a Christian I feel bad but I walking so I walking like that that's what you talking about you want to reflect God's glory you want to reflect his presence you want to reflect I want to know where do you go to church what what do you believe why are you glowing like that something is about you something about you in other words you are distinguished from everybody else by what is around you and there is something around you because angels are are working with and for you oh give the Lord some Praises how how do you think you come through all these years you think it was your strength and your ability and your might it was God overlooking your life you're not dead you are in the land of the living giv him praise you're not dead praise God it have okay things might be bad with you but it could have been worse is not worse give God some Praises glory to God Amen all right heing is set forth the love of God he desired in love to love a family of his own a family of sons like himself therefore before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of a spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk every one of these words are weighted words I'm still reading will be trained that is to come into discipline when you go in the army you don't go with your own haircut you have a big thow you have this and that and yeah me have a Bara once you hit that door they have a scissors waiting for you there must know when people in the Army you know they have a certain haircut all them that's cut that way because you're the Army it's not your own thing because you will get killed discipline protects you discipline keeps you you can't just be loose when they say attention you say I feeling at ease yes I feeling LED of this time to be at ease they will chew you out when they say attention everybody's attention right turn left turn salute that's the Army inspection what is that for if the shoes polished now your shoes might be polished but see boots they have there you better have them polished that's a poish and shine plus you to make up your bed not I for momy no you have to learn to make up your own bed all that is discipline you have to stand you have to go through drills you have to go to Under Fire and training you have to climb

worshiping and serving [Applause] God hallelujah may be seated so the chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in your walk are you ready he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy oh good he chastens with his nail scar hand sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it I feel God want to break somebody inside of here he breaks and remakes he is the Potter and we are the clay in his hands nobody want to lose wife husband children but you

are de called according to his purpose [Music] [Applause] hall hallelujah Hall may be seated now this is not a Rosy message to preach but if I go by Rose we preach something else but we go in by how we have felt led sometimes this pot must take the vessel he's working on thoroughly break it down in order he may rebuild it exactly as he desired hear this part but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be did you get that this breaking this remolding this shaping this chastening is his love oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have tremendous three-fold strength yes of political physical and spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ this is prophecy she will suffer so all of those who want to R to Raptor Glory I have the is here for you she will suffer it doesn't stop there but she will endure the prophecy from the message of Grace says what it says the Bible goes through persecution not my wrath did you get that the prophecy said the bride will go through a persecution but not my wrath his wrath is a different thing alog together Hallelujah huj she will suffer but Chief will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he loved his own loveed them until the end be zealous and repent now this false church had Zeal make no mistake about that but God is calling for another Zeal are you ready it's a Zeal to cry I am wrong now who is going to say he's wrong all this denomination is based upon the claim of to ity and that of God they all cannot be right they say they are right because they are the ones that are saying it but saying it doesn't make it so am I am the bride I'm the eye in the bride he I night talk but that will make it so you understand what I'm saying they are saying they right because they are the one seeing it but saying it doesn't make it so they need the Vindicated thust say the Lord of God and they don't have it now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only the forcely to repent in this verse he's talking to his elect they have some repenting to do too the elect have some repenting to do too many of his children are in those false churches they are those who speak to Ephesians are awake down the sleepest and arise from the dead to be asleep is not to be dead they are sleeping among the dead they're out there in dead you say denomination we say message Jes they are floating around and God Cries Out wake up repent of your Folly all right discipline this word discipline discipline is training that makes people more willing to obey or more able to control themselves often in the forms of rules and punishments if these are broken or the behavior produced by this training here we go in the Old Testament a father owned a great portion of ground he had hired servants uh and watch over his flock and when a child was born into the house the father didn't have the time to take care of his son the way he should he go and hire a tutor or a razor someone to educate a child here we go here's where I think the Pentecostal Church make their mistake when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was was not yet determined it depended on his character the birth part is not the issue the character patters so the son inheritance was connected to the son's character though being a son if he was disobedient son he would not inherit anything still he's a son but if he was an obedient son he was air to all things it's your character from then on that means the difference how do you get character you're not born with it cor is not a gift character is a victory and a victory mean test is given for you to overcome the only way you could know what in new is take the test how the teacher will know how the child is learning in in in in school give them a test and then you will see who learn what how is God going to know what we are learning what we are applying what we really believe give the test when the test come it exposes whether you have received it whether you learn it or whether you had to go through it again and you can't just skip grades if you didn't get it right it comes back again now the father be sure his son get the best opportunity that he would have he sought out a man that was capable of taking care of that son he would get a man that was honest and would bring correct reports to his boy's discipline so if the father asks the boy how so he was given the Holy Ghost of the tror to raise the church and he is the teacher and the Razer of the church and he will bring a COR report to the father what it becomes what if the boy is a rascal sort of boy roaming the street smoking cigarette drinking pool room rock and roll party and the father expecting to hear the news how is my child progressing Judah said oh he isn't very good now the father must drop his countenance what what's the matter with my son well he won't listen he's out with a bunch run all the time if the tutor worried to come before the father what does the Holy Ghost through tonight when it stands before God the Father to bring the condition of the church and he has to come and say them your sons that receive your spirit be born again is fussing and fighting in among one another there is no cooperation with them at all let's pause right here you see one just competition no cooperation once there is competition there is no cooperation why compete when God give gifts to men give different stations of Life To Men time and chance happen to all men so once somebody competing they can't cooperate let us do this together no why you want this one to be better you want that one to be better that's churches pastors ministers there's no cooperation them at all they won't even cooperate enough to have a Revival in the city what do you think the blessed Holy Ghost feasts when you have to bring that message before the father now remember if God has permitted sickness to come on you to bring you to discipline and you refuse to discipline yourself before God and step out the line don't come in here it might make you worse if you are sinful and you have unconfessed sin make it right with God before you come to God for prayer so don't just about pray for me pray for me what condition are you in wanting that prayer proverbs
