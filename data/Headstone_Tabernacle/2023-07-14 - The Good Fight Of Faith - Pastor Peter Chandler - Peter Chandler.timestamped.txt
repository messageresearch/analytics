[1:06:44] hallelujah
[1:06:46] so before we get into the service just
[1:06:49] want to read a scripture you don't have
[1:06:52] to understand this note is from second
[1:06:55] Timothy there's no also that in the last
[1:06:57] days perilous time shall come for men
[1:06:59] shall be lovers of their own self
[1:07:01] Covetous boosters proud blasphemers
[1:07:04] disobedient parents I'm thankful and
[1:07:06] holy without natural affection through
[1:07:08] speakers false accusers incontinent
[1:07:10] fears to spices of those are the good
[1:07:12] treat us minded lovers of Pleasures with
[1:07:15] our lovers of God having a form of
[1:07:17] godliness but denying the power of the
[1:07:19] Earth from such turn away for of this
[1:07:21] short a day which creep into houses and
[1:07:23] Lead captive silly women living with
[1:07:25] sins the letter we were divers lost ever
[1:07:28] learning
[1:07:29] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:07:33] of Truth No as Jonathan Chambers which
[1:07:36] took Moses so these also resist the
[1:07:39] truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[1:07:43] concerning the faith
[1:07:45] but they shall proceed no further for
[1:07:47] the Folly shall be made manifest also
[1:07:50] unto all men as theirs also was but we
[1:07:53] know the inspiration we have contending
[1:07:55] for the fit and yet there's a prophecy
[1:07:57] that says here as Jonathan Chambers
[1:07:59] which said Moses so these resist the
[1:08:01] truth men of corrupt mice now we're not
[1:08:03] talking about people outside the message
[1:08:04] this is a message now and this whole
[1:08:06] list that is listed here is church folks
[1:08:08] that's not unbelievable church folks
[1:08:10] heading high-minded love of his presence
[1:08:12] but their doors that will be fighting
[1:08:14] for defeat
[1:08:15] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:08:17] praise God but a Branham in a message
[1:08:20] called uh anointing was at the end time
[1:08:23] he was talking about ever learning never
[1:08:26] able to come to know the truth and
[1:08:28] here's the shocking here's a shocking
[1:08:29] part listen to this and he read the
[1:08:31] scripture here as Janice and jambased
[1:08:33] with sir Moses so these also reaches the
[1:08:35] truths men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[1:08:37] concerning defeat which has wanted for
[1:08:39] the sins of course considering the faith
[1:08:41] and he shall turn the faith the children
[1:08:44] back to the feet of the fathers they're
[1:08:47] very objective of God send a prophet was
[1:08:49] not to argument and debate and church
[1:08:51] and who know was eternal Hearts back to
[1:08:53] the faith of the father that was the
[1:08:56] motive that was the intent of God that
[1:08:58] we turned right back to what they had
[1:08:59] back there isn't that right praise God
[1:09:01] no reprim with considering the faith if
[1:09:03] you've got a school field Bible here it
[1:09:04] says apostasy apostasy is what
[1:09:07] abandonment of principle on principal
[1:09:09] people now watch he says now watch I
[1:09:12] want then after he read that he read
[1:09:14] Luke 18 about the parable of the city of
[1:09:17] a judge with fear that God we know the
[1:09:18] scripture and we don't say avenge me and
[1:09:21] then he closed off with saying I tell
[1:09:22] you he will avenge them speedily
[1:09:25] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:09:27] shall he find faith on the earth and
[1:09:30] then brother branham's got to go down
[1:09:31] into it now he said no that's the
[1:09:33] question here is the way I want to get
[1:09:34] to in Revelation 10 he said in the days
[1:09:37] of the message of the seventh Angels the
[1:09:40] mystery of God ought to be finished here
[1:09:43] is the question if you will follow in
[1:09:45] that line in this hour will it be
[1:09:46] finished will I find faith will Malachi
[1:09:50] 4 be fulfilled at this time restore the
[1:09:52] faith of the children back to the faith
[1:09:54] of the fathers the original word praise
[1:09:56] God reprobates Johnson jambres you're
[1:09:59] talking about having a form of godliness
[1:10:01] anointed ones you see the anointed ones
[1:10:04] Matthew 24 24 these are the Church of
[1:10:06] anointed ones second Timothy edian
[1:10:08] minded and there is a spirit of Christ
[1:10:10] which is found in second Peter 1 4-7
[1:10:12] which is fate and virtual knowledge that
[1:10:15] is Christ's spirit and upon that you
[1:10:17] have Ephesians for a genuine faithful
[1:10:20] Ministry who praise God do you get that
[1:10:22] tonight praise God there's a genuine
[1:10:24] faithful ministry under that praise God
[1:10:26] the Holy Spirit praise God anointed man
[1:10:29] of God and I believe in my heart that
[1:10:31] God won't inspire you anointed you
[1:10:33] because we have anointed Sons inspired
[1:10:36] Sons
[1:10:37] do you believe that nobody Madam says
[1:10:39] here no go back reprogates concerning
[1:10:41] not reprobate in living
[1:10:43] they are fine cultured men
[1:10:46] so not living part is the faith part oh
[1:10:50] praise be to Jesus so he had to fight
[1:10:53] for that fate oh blessed be the name of

[1:15:11] is very much in keeping with the

[1:15:15] in Revelation chapter 5 verse 9
[1:15:20] where it says that Christ had redeemed
[1:15:22] us to Gordon

[1:15:48] mystical body
[1:15:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] in paragraph 29 of the message
[1:15:58] ten virgins and 144 thousand
[1:16:02] the product the prophet of God made this
[1:16:04] remark
[1:16:06] now the first three chapters of
[1:16:08] Revelation
[1:16:10] deals with the church
[1:16:12] the Gentiles
[1:16:14] Jewish
[1:16:16] Ethiopian
[1:16:18] Africans
[1:16:22] every type of people in the world goes
[1:16:25] to the Gentiles

[1:16:45] and that's made up of all Nations
[1:16:48] kindreds
[1:16:49] tongues
[1:16:51] and people
[1:16:55] then in a message super signed 1962
[1:17:00] the prophet tells us
[1:17:02] that's the way we can do
[1:17:06] harmonize
[1:17:08] in different opinions
[1:17:11] we still harmonize
[1:17:13] because we are God's people
[1:17:17] all marching together
[1:17:20] with one great purpose
[1:17:22] to win souls of Christ
[1:17:25] and may it ever be that way
[1:17:28] made his great bouquet of God's

[1:17:34] here be an everlasting bookie
[1:17:37] until he comes to take us home
[1:17:45] so as we come together this afternoon
[1:17:49] special mention was
[1:17:51] again be made of many International
[1:17:54] visitors
[1:17:56] who have come to support these meetings
[1:17:59] those who have made great sacrifices
[1:18:02] and have traveled long distances
[1:18:05] to be in attendance
[1:18:08] May O Lord Jesus Christ richly
[1:18:11] reward you for your efforts
[1:18:14] and may your time of Fellowship together
[1:18:18] prove to be brought to
[1:18:20] meaningful and memorable
[1:18:25] even at the Soviet David once declared
[1:18:29] behold how good
[1:18:31] and how pleasant it is
[1:18:34] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:18:42] after being asked to make this small
[1:18:44] contribution
[1:18:46] I immediately begun to reflect
[1:18:50] upon the team chosen for this year's
[1:18:53] convention
[1:18:55] earnestly
[1:18:57] contending for defeat once delivered
[1:19:01] inspired words
[1:19:03] recorded in the book of Judah
[1:19:06] and friend this afternoon
[1:19:09] amen as I give careful
[1:19:12] taught
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:16] the Jews opening remarks
[1:19:20] I decided
[1:19:22] to consult the prophet
[1:19:25] as I always do
[1:19:29] in a message contending for the faith
[1:19:33] 53 paragraph 11.
[1:19:36] now how marvelous
[1:19:38] earnestly contending
[1:19:41] for defeat there was once
[1:19:43] delivered to the Saints
[1:19:46] and that word marvelous struck me
[1:19:50] Prophet says how marvelous
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:55] and the word marvelous means of how
[1:19:58] exciting
[1:20:00] amen how wonderful
[1:20:02] how extremely good
[1:20:05] unpleasing
[1:20:07] to be partaken
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:12] of the miraculous
[1:20:17] condensed can
[1:20:19] tendon for defeat 54-24
[1:20:23] Now what is
[1:20:25] to contend
[1:20:28] Prophet asks a question
[1:20:30] consent contend is a
[1:20:33] just stand there
[1:20:35] and hold fast
[1:20:38] on your conviction
[1:20:41] earnestly contending for defeat
[1:20:45] not aphid
[1:20:48] defeat
[1:20:54] amen
[1:21:00] praise His name
[1:21:03] the word also contended means also
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] that you fight strenuously
[1:21:12] for the defense of the feet
[1:21:15] which was once
[1:21:17] amen for all handed down
[1:21:21] to the Saints
[1:21:23] so important was the message to the
[1:21:26] Saints
[1:21:27] of Daddy and even today
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:32] when you look very carefully at the
[1:21:34] scripture
[1:21:36] again you realize that it speaks
[1:21:39] specifically
[1:21:41] of treatings
[1:21:44] earnestly
[1:21:47] amen contending
[1:21:49] and faith
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:56] earnestly saints of God and
[1:22:00] it has to do
[1:22:03] with a greater extent
[1:22:07] amen more intensely
[1:22:10] more intensely than before
[1:22:14] seriously
[1:22:15] and sincere
[1:22:17] in our intentions
[1:22:22] whatever we do for the kingdom of God
[1:22:25] we must do it with zeal
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:29] and with a certain degree of enthusiasm
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:36] and that is a reason
[1:22:39] amen why that's
[1:22:42] wider spiritual
[1:22:45] inspired you to
[1:22:48] to use the word earnestly
[1:22:52] it also means to pursue when sincere
[1:22:57] an intense convictions
[1:23:02] amen it is said that Earnest people
[1:23:06] are said to be very serious
[1:23:09] in the way they approach
[1:23:11] every task that is entrusted to them
[1:23:15] and most certainly friends and amen this
[1:23:19] is the kind of attitude that we must all
[1:23:23] have When approaching our god-given
[1:23:27] responsibility
[1:23:32] using the Wilderness earnestly
[1:23:36] Jesus and Gethsemane
[1:23:38] prayed more earnestly

[1:24:07] to the changing of our bodies the

[1:25:08] Ephesians 6 and 12 were wrestling
[1:25:10] against flesh and blood but again
[1:25:12] principalities and again Powers against

[1:25:52] sword in the other
[1:25:53] fighting all the critics of and the
[1:25:56] Skeptics and the false accusers even
[1:26:00] though we press towards them the mark of

[1:38:26] good fight of faith
[1:38:29] is my title today as the brothers we go
[1:38:32] to the scripture where you go into this
[1:38:34] tremendous uh scripture called
[1:38:37] Proverbs eight if you want a blessing go
[1:38:40] home and read that it deals with the
[1:38:43] person of wisdom
[1:38:46] such a point that it even says uh doth
[1:38:50] not wisdom cry
[1:38:52] death and understanding put forth her
[1:38:56] voice
[1:38:57] they contend
[1:38:59] their wisdom is not uh
[1:39:03] afraid
[1:39:05] intimidated
[1:39:06] wisdom is not a compromiser if you ever
[1:39:10] see an ego compromise
[1:39:13] that is wisdom a weird content wisdom is
[1:39:17] not afraid to talk
[1:39:18] and to say so
[1:39:20] in fact wisdom goes very deep and says
[1:39:24] if you hate wisdom you love death
[1:39:28] read that tonight you will be blessed by
[1:39:31] Proverbs 8 Matthew 11 continues to say
[1:39:36] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:39:39] now the kingdom of Heaven's suffereth
[1:39:44] violence
[1:39:45] and the violent
[1:39:47] take it
[1:39:49] by force
[1:39:51] let's touch on Matthew 19 he said unto
[1:39:54] him okay because of the hardness of your
[1:39:56] heart he suffered you to put away your
[1:39:59] wives but
[1:40:01] from the beginning
[1:40:03] the original thing
[1:40:05] from the beginning it was not so
[1:40:09] the original faith
[1:40:12] and where are we Philippians 3 14
[1:40:15] I individually press towards the mark
[1:40:20] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:40:25] in Christ Jesus
[1:40:28] Timothy says take heed unto thyself and
[1:40:33] unto the doctrine continue in them for
[1:40:38] in doing this Thou shalt both save
[1:40:40] yourself and them that hear thee
[1:40:44] my title Timothy 6 1 Timothy 6 fight the
[1:40:49] good fight of faith

[1:41:37] bought to say what he said and to live
[1:41:42] what he lived we thank you Lord that we
[1:41:46] are contending for the faith because
[1:41:48] love is corrective and we are therefore
[1:41:51] contending for this original faith that

[1:42:52] Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his
[1:42:57] church
[1:42:59] until he returned

[1:48:29] become bloody I see the white wolf you
[1:48:32] say and then hanging that little lamb
[1:48:34] bloody God looked down said that's it
[1:48:39] that's it a bleeding lamb brother animal
[1:48:43] rights we wouldn't like this this
[1:48:45] quotation oh you're so cruel to animals
[1:48:47] but God said that's it
[1:48:50] you've got it
[1:48:51] there is God's provided sacrifice
[1:48:55] there is the faith
[1:48:58] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:49:01] who was Abel's lamb Abel had the wisdom
[1:49:06] of he was interested in blood
[1:49:09] Kane was interested in nice things his
[1:49:12] achievements but Abel was interested in
[1:49:15] blood
[1:49:16] hanging bleeding bleeding dying the
[1:49:21] Abel's lamb that's it that's it the
[1:49:25] faith
[1:49:26] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:49:29] can we have a big Amen on that
[1:49:32] let's go over brothers let's go over to
[1:49:34] Cain now let's make a big statement this
[1:49:37] is powerful if all you have to do
[1:49:41] is just believe that is God
[1:49:44] you kneel down and worship if that's all
[1:49:46] you do Cain was justified
[1:49:52] if that's all you have to do is just
[1:49:54] believe and you'll kneel down and it
[1:49:56] came was justified it goes beyond that
[1:49:58] cane he said the Bible said that even
[1:50:02] the devil believes that's the truth
[1:50:04] and the devil publicly confessed Jesus
[1:50:07] Christ to be the Son of God that didn't
[1:50:10] save them brother
[1:50:12] we'd better get that straightened out
[1:50:16] one of these days gonna be a mistake
[1:50:19] made
[1:50:20] there's gonna be a mistake one of these
[1:50:22] days because somebody is right and
[1:50:25] somebody is wrong you better take what
[1:50:28] the Bible said this was a fight
[1:50:31] this in fact it cost able
[1:50:34] his life
[1:50:36] it cost him his life
[1:50:38] because just for having that Revelation
[1:50:40] can kill him
[1:50:43] it cost him his life
[1:50:45] brother it's a fight
[1:50:47] the good fight of faith

[2:04:31] can be seated Saints let me just press
[2:04:33] on the carry on Brothers nice look

[2:04:41] the reality
[2:04:43] of the Holy Spirit
[2:04:45] they don't want to act any different
[2:04:50] to than what they always act but when
[2:04:54] you become a Christian
[2:04:56] you are a peculiar person
[2:04:59] you are a royal priesthood
[2:05:01] you are a strange Nation
[2:05:04] uh odd people do odd things strange
[2:05:08] things
[2:05:09] and becoming to the world
[2:05:12] and when you're in the world you're
[2:05:15] Unbecoming to God
[2:05:16] one is vice versa to the other
[2:05:19] your problem is even you're in Heavenly
[2:05:22] places
[2:05:23] that's your problem he says one makes
[2:05:26] you act like they do in heaven
[2:05:28] my precious brother

[2:05:49] wisdom
[2:05:51] if you're Earthly you have Earthly
[2:05:52] wisdom
[2:05:54] he says he says one makes you act and if
[2:05:57] people want to act like they do on Earth
[2:05:59] and then say they're going to heaven
[2:06:01] what a disappointment that's going to be
[2:06:04] what a disappointment that's going to be
[2:06:06] praise be to God hallelujah what can we
[2:06:09] say to these things amen amen amen we
[2:06:13] are talking now about being a contender

[2:06:27] interpretation
[2:06:29] of God's word

[2:06:50] Martin these people contended for the
[2:06:53] faith
[2:06:54] they blasted that age

[2:07:00] blasted his age
[2:07:02] then Luther he blasted his age
[2:07:06] he said this is not the literal body and
[2:07:09] he threw the community on the floor
[2:07:11] wisdom
[2:07:13] crying out
[2:07:15] in every Church age

[2:07:56] and to turn them back from their
[2:07:58] iniquity now if that's been the trend

[2:08:05] going down will God change his trend
[2:08:08] for this day he can't change it he will
[2:08:12] never change it

[2:09:16] if you just answer it that's all
[2:09:19] Mr best didn't know what to say
[2:09:22] because Mr Bosworth wiped him out with
[2:09:26] one scripture
[2:09:28] he was Jehovah Rapha he was Jehovah man
[2:09:31] I said if he wasn't we look for another
[2:09:33] another messenger I love this Bosworth
[2:09:37] contending for the faith that was once
[2:09:40] delivered to the Saints let's move on
[2:09:42] Brothers brother Branham was a contender
[2:09:44] as well
[2:09:46] I love this brother Branham was
[2:09:48] contending
[2:09:49] against the trinity
[2:09:52] and this woman
[2:09:54] to say they tell me you're a preacher
[2:09:58] he said I am
[2:10:00] said well what do you think about this
[2:10:05] brother Branham contending for the Faith
[2:10:08] said
[2:10:09] it's the devil
[2:10:11] told him straight just tell the truth
[2:10:13] never mind the consequences just tell
[2:10:15] the truth
[2:10:15] [Music]
[2:10:17] how'd you say it's the devil he said
[2:10:19] well you've got so much power knock it
[2:10:21] down then
[2:10:22] he said I don't have any power
[2:10:26] I don't have any power Hallelujah but
[2:10:30] I'm here representing one I said Lord
[2:10:32] Jesus
[2:10:33] you said in Mark 16 in my
[2:10:37] name in my
[2:10:40] they shall cast out devils now that your
[2:10:44] servant may know as the battle lays
[2:10:47] before me
[2:10:48] the good fight of faith
[2:10:51] I said I command that table to fall down
[2:10:55] in the name of the holy church
[2:10:58] nothing happened it stayed right there I
[2:11:02] said I command that table to fall down
[2:11:05] there in the name of the father and the
[2:11:07] Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:11:09] nothing happened it stayed right there I
[2:11:13] said I command that table
[2:11:15] to fall down in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:11:20] and it fell so hard it broke all the
[2:11:22] legs man let's cut those Hands for Jesus
[2:11:26] Hallelujah
[2:11:27] contending for the faith praise be to
[2:11:31] God father son Holy Ghost won't work
[2:11:35] if anybody here is baptized in those
[2:11:37] titles it won't work
[2:11:39] that's why
[2:11:41] I've been so zealous
[2:11:43] for the seed because you can't just say
[2:11:47] this should work it won't work
[2:11:48] it won't work he said the head
[2:11:52] said the works that I do you shall do
[2:11:54] the body
[2:11:55] so the head says the body will do the
[2:11:58] same works as the head
[2:11:59] amen he said he says why I have been so
[2:12:03] zealous
[2:12:04] contending
[2:12:06] for the seed
[2:12:08] because not every idea will work
[2:12:11] not every motivator online will work
[2:12:14] it's got to be the seed
[2:12:17] it's got to be the seed of God we'll
[2:12:18] possess the gates of the enemy
[2:12:21] it's got to have seed to fall on church
[2:12:24] this is very serious we must contend for
[2:12:27] the seed because the seed will possess
[2:12:29] every gate
[2:12:31] that's where the power is
[2:12:33] I've been so zealous of being contending
[2:12:36] for the seed let's go Brothers we're
[2:12:38] moving along nicely he said now
[2:12:41] last Sunday I preached on the key
[2:12:45] if the key is not right the door won't
[2:12:47] open
[2:12:50] it's got to be right
[2:12:52] he said and the key is faith
[2:12:56] let's talk about faith let's finish off
[2:12:58] with that so Faith takes the little
[2:13:01] hinges of scripture
[2:13:03] and unlocks the glories
[2:13:07] and the good of God out to his people so
[2:13:12] if Faith holds the key
[2:13:15] that unlocks Christ
[2:13:18] to the people and locks it reveals it
[2:13:22] so today today we're gonna take that
[2:13:27] same key
[2:13:28] thank God for that same key
[2:13:31] to un where are we to to to unlock the
[2:13:36] way
[2:13:37] to become a virtuous Christian
[2:13:41] in the Statue of God
[2:13:44] and be a living Tabernacle for a living
[2:13:47] God to dwell in
[2:13:49] Hallelujah there's only one key
[2:13:52] amen when God opens no man can shut it
[2:13:57] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:13:59] many shall run to and fro it won't work
[2:14:04] but they that know their God
[2:14:06] shall do exploits in that day
[2:14:09] God's Revelations to his church
[2:14:13] sit still a little flock positionally
[2:14:15] stay where you are Keep Holding On don't
[2:14:18] worry God is waiting
[2:14:20] God is trying pressing
[2:14:23] press contending pushing
[2:14:27] to get the mystery to his church
[2:14:31] that is what's holding back the rapture
[2:14:33] yeah
[2:14:34] that's what's holding back the coming of
[2:14:36] Christ and the great Millennium this
[2:14:39] great power that lays dormant in the
[2:14:41] church
[2:14:42] praise be to God that they that know
[2:14:44] their God
[2:14:46] church say they shout to exploits you've
[2:14:50] got to know your God you've got to know
[2:14:51] what works and what doesn't work
[2:14:53] you can't just guess it's not a time for
[2:14:56] guesswork
[2:14:57] listen I believe that through these
[2:15:00] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[2:15:01] days
[2:15:02] to get the bride together
[2:15:05] for rapturing Faith because brother what
[2:15:09] we've got right now
[2:15:11] what does it say what we it wouldn't be
[2:15:14] able to do it
[2:15:16] with something we've got to step further
[2:15:21] we can't have enough faithful Divine
[2:15:22] Healing
[2:15:25] but we've got to have enough faith
[2:15:27] brother we are contending for that faith
[2:15:31] to be changed in a moment and swept up
[2:15:35] out of this Earth
[2:15:36] and after a while we'll find where it's
[2:15:39] written it's not a game friends we've
[2:15:41] got a content for this faith we've got
[2:15:44] to look for what the apostles had
[2:15:46] we're going to talk about that a bit
[2:15:48] more before we close let's just move on
[2:15:49] Brothers we've got a
[2:15:51] a very important thing faith
[2:15:54] is unconscious
[2:15:59] many people say if only I had faith
[2:16:02] faith it doesn't mean long drawn out
[2:16:06] prayer meetings
[2:16:07] it doesn't mean long fast
[2:16:12] faith is an unconscious thing
[2:16:16] you've got it and you don't know you've
[2:16:18] got it
[2:16:20] brother there's such faith in this place
[2:16:22] Pastor such faith is here I wonder if we
[2:16:27] realize how much faith is in here you
[2:16:29] watch these meetings Hallelujah faith is
[2:16:32] unconscious your real faith that's what
[2:16:36] we're contending for
[2:16:38] you don't know
[2:16:40] the faith you've got yeah it's an
[2:16:43] unconscious matter with you
[2:16:45] can you imagine Jesus wondering oh can I
[2:16:49] raise Lazarus
[2:16:50] he had already seen the vision
[2:16:55] he never questioned his faith now before
[2:16:58] we can have faith we've got to have some
[2:17:00] Foundation you see the title of
[2:17:01] fundamental Foundation of Faith we've
[2:17:04] got to have a foundation there's got to
[2:17:06] be something behind it
[2:17:08] and we've got a content for that
[2:17:10] not I'm trying to believe
[2:17:13] that won't work
[2:17:14] listen to The Prophet deep caused the
[2:17:16] Deep and then I've got the picture there
[2:17:18] but it's in the message why we're not a
[2:17:20] denomination you remember what he said
[2:17:22] he says let your faith run out
[2:17:28] to its end your faith I believe I
[2:17:32] believe I think I will let that run out
[2:17:35] let that run out
[2:17:37] till you begin
[2:17:39] to believe
[2:17:43] then let your subconscious go to acting
[2:17:48] then
[2:17:50] the faith
[2:17:52] the faith of God will back it up
[2:17:57] and you'll go right on out
[2:18:00] because your faith won't do much
[2:18:05] I'm trying to believe
[2:18:07] I'm trying hard to really hold on that
[2:18:09] won't do much
[2:18:11] but your subconscious
[2:18:14] has to move
[2:18:16] in the direction that your faith is
[2:18:20] moving
[2:18:22] then God's faith
[2:18:25] God's faith Moves In
[2:18:29] now is not your faith
[2:18:31] it is
[2:18:33] God's faith
[2:18:34] ah
[2:18:36] the faith of the son of God
[2:18:39] is now in you
[2:18:41] your faith
[2:18:43] it won't do much
[2:18:44] trying oh I I think I believe look that
[2:18:48] won't do much we are contending for a
[2:18:51] bigger
[2:18:52] stronger more powerful subconscious
[2:18:55] faith introduced by Malachi 4.
[2:18:59] Hallelujah then your faith won't do much
[2:19:02] God's faith Moves In
[2:19:04] if it's your faith
[2:19:06] you say oh I've got it
[2:19:08] and your subconscious is saying I wonder
[2:19:12] if it'll work on me
[2:19:15] so brother Brown the faith that he gave
[2:19:17] us is an unconscious face shall I
[2:19:19] explain some more let's go here it's
[2:19:21] like the captain of a ship
[2:19:23] the captain gives the order
[2:19:26] but it's the man in the
[2:19:29] engine room
[2:19:31] that carries it out
[2:19:33] the captain El Capitano
[2:19:36] he says Full Speed Ahead
[2:19:42] and nothing happens
[2:19:43] because the engine man
[2:19:46] hasn't
[2:19:47] put to the fire
[2:19:49] on the engine to make it no matter how
[2:19:52] much it Full Speed Ahead
[2:19:56] it will only happen
[2:19:58] if the Angelman does his job
[2:20:03] because mental faith is not and today
[2:20:06] what we will have let there be squirrels
[2:20:14] and there's no squirrels because they
[2:20:16] has to agree
[2:20:18] with the engine man
[2:20:21] Hallelujah can somebody shall Glory
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:25] here's your first conscience
[2:20:27] the faith that is contended for
[2:20:32] here's your subconscious now this
[2:20:34] conscious subconscious is what I'm
[2:20:36] trying with the Holy Spirit to work on
[2:20:41] that's what I'm doing
[2:20:43] and he proved that he said a prophet
[2:20:45] they're both together a prophet anyway
[2:20:47] he says this first conscious I might ask
[2:20:50] this man do you believe
[2:20:52] and he'll say oh yes sir I believe
[2:20:56] remember that little sister with the
[2:20:57] bracelet and the prophet said you don't
[2:21:00] believe sister you you don't you think
[2:21:02] you believe you don't believe
[2:21:04] amen and the prophet demonstrated
[2:21:07] this is real something's about to happen
[2:21:10] this message has such a power
[2:21:12] [Music]
[2:21:14] but what we're dealing with Pastor here
[2:21:16] what I love what you said earlier is
[2:21:18] unfeigned faith
[2:21:21] which means unpretended faith
[2:21:25] you've got to Faith is something you
[2:21:28] know
[2:21:29] you can't pretend it
[2:21:31] the devil's no
[2:21:32] but when you know that you know that you
[2:21:35] know it's different
[2:21:37] then the subconscious is what I'm
[2:21:39] talking about oh you believe he says
[2:21:41] this man down here he's the one that
[2:21:43] runs the ship
[2:21:45] not the man in the PowerHouse is the man
[2:21:48] in the engine room
[2:21:50] contending for the faith praise be to
[2:21:53] God this is where my climax here he says
[2:21:56] that's what it takes the perfect Faith
[2:21:58] to ignite
[2:22:00] the power of the Holy Ghost which we
[2:22:02] have now since he's come upon us whoa
[2:22:06] to ignite see the faith
[2:22:10] something that presents it to you
[2:22:13] with a heart full of joy you walk in the
[2:22:16] sacrum knowing what you've got to say
[2:22:18] you walk in there and you know what's
[2:22:21] going to happen
[2:22:22] you know just trying to believe you know
[2:22:24] it
[2:22:25] and brother I can boldly say today I
[2:22:27] know there's going to be a rapture
[2:22:29] I know my family is going to be saved
[2:22:32] praise God something presents it to you
[2:22:35] watch over here I'm a musician you can
[2:22:37] make your way I'm finishing now
[2:22:39] he said earnestly contending for the
[2:22:42] faith you know when when Saul was
[2:22:44] converted
[2:22:45] it was a very Supernatural day
[2:22:48] it was a supernatural day
[2:22:51] because soul I don't mean to say but it
[2:22:54] was almost comparable to Moab
[2:22:57] he was against the Holy Rollers
[2:23:02] but the angel got involved
[2:23:08] you see when Osborne tackle Mr best
[2:23:13] the angel got invoked
[2:23:15] and they took a photo
[2:23:17] that Mr best could see
[2:23:19] it was the angel
[2:23:21] it was not just Bosworth
[2:23:23] it was the angel over the prophet
[2:23:26] contending for the faith
[2:23:28] let me just bring this out earnestly
[2:23:30] containing for the faith he said ananas
[2:23:32] when Paul this was okay my closing
[2:23:35] thought musicians is the faith that the
[2:23:38] apostles had
[2:23:40] watch what happened here Paul he got
[2:23:42] converted for a start he was doing the
[2:23:44] wrong thing he meant well but he was
[2:23:46] going to attack God's people so the
[2:23:49] angel got involved so so
[2:23:52] who are you I'm Jesus
[2:23:54] you're persecuting Jesus
[2:23:57] come on Saul come on
[2:23:59] and then so so who he was next thing
[2:24:02] here's the faith he said ananias came
[2:24:04] down and he saw what the vision told him
[2:24:08] so something's going on Christ is among
[2:24:10] the apostles
[2:24:12] he saw the vision he went down to the
[2:24:14] street called straight how did he know
[2:24:16] by by a vision he walked in laid his
[2:24:19] hand said brother Saul the Lord appeared
[2:24:21] to you this way this way he sent me to
[2:24:23] lay hands on you but you might receive
[2:24:25] your sight and be filled with the Holy
[2:24:28] Ghost
[2:24:29] are you ready for this
[2:24:31] if that isn't the faith that was once
[2:24:35] delivered to the Saints I don't know
[2:24:37] what is
[2:24:39] that's when Christ
[2:24:40] is among his people let's clap those
[2:24:42] hands we're finishing off now when Ann
[2:24:45] and asked could take over
[2:24:47] just pick it up off the flyer tremendous
[2:24:50] flyer there they had faith in a
[2:24:53] Resurrected
[2:24:54] living Christ
[2:24:56] someone who rose from the dead and was
[2:24:59] living amongst them
[2:25:02] the same as he was before he died
[2:25:04] that's what we're contending for
[2:25:06] see they were condemning enough for some
[2:25:08] historical Affair but a living Christ a
[2:25:13] resurrected one who was in their minds
[2:25:16] let's go to because the next slide
[2:25:18] follows perfectly watch this he said
[2:25:21] in the days of the seals which is these
[2:25:25] days
[2:25:26] the mystery of God will be finished in
[2:25:29] other words
[2:25:31] God would be known to his church
[2:25:36] not as three people
[2:25:38] that won't work
[2:25:41] he says but as one
[2:25:43] person
[2:25:44] the mystery of God will be revealed
[2:25:47] because that was completely revealed
[2:25:49] then the seven Mysteries were open to
[2:25:51] the church because in there
[2:25:53] the church would be living
[2:25:57] under the inspiration
[2:26:00] of the Holy Spirit
[2:26:01] him
[2:26:03] moving
[2:26:04] in
[2:26:05] and out
[2:26:07] in
[2:26:08] and out
[2:26:10] in and out showing his signs of being
[2:26:15] alive
[2:26:16] he's going to move in
[2:26:18] and out of these meetings
[2:26:20] it will be Jesus the resurrected Jesus
[2:26:23] he's gonna move in and out and in
[2:26:27] because we're living under the
[2:26:29] inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[2:26:32] being alive
[2:26:34] then we're worshiping the living Christ
[2:26:37] that's amongst us let's clap those hands
[2:26:39] we've got just one more I think
[2:26:41] yeah this is my last slide there
[2:26:43] look let's summarize everything when
[2:26:46] you're ready I'm sure you've got the
[2:26:47] right song brother Anthony amen when the
[2:26:49] battle's over we shall wear a crown

[2:27:19] can I say contending
[2:27:22] that's what I'm striving for that's what
[2:27:25] I'm placing for I said oh Lord that's
[2:27:27] what I'm here at church for
[2:27:30] I'm trying to set the church in order
[2:27:31] I'm telling you brother sister there's
[2:27:34] only one thing that can ever enter there
[2:27:37] is divine love
[2:27:39] let's clap those hands well I just tell
[2:27:41] a story
[2:27:41] [Applause]
[2:27:44] Hallelujah all right yeah
[2:27:50] the inspiration today church as I close
[2:27:52] and brother Anthony prepares a song
[2:27:55] this message is so real
[2:27:58] you know
[2:28:00] it's it's a
[2:28:01] it can't fail
[2:28:03] he couldn't trust it with an Angel
[2:28:05] it had to be a prophet
[2:28:08] it had to happen
[2:28:09] something's going on Church
[2:28:12] there was an experiment
[2:28:14] our
[2:28:16] um inspiration contending for the faith
[2:28:19] some scientists they got a bird
[2:28:24] the bird name was a wren
[2:28:26] w-r-e-n a red bird
[2:28:29] rent w-r-e-n translators w-r-e-n and
[2:28:33] they they took this poor bird and they
[2:28:35] kept it for years
[2:28:38] generation after generation after
[2:28:40] generation
[2:28:42] they said this bird will forget
[2:28:45] how to build a nest
[2:28:48] and they kept this bird for for years
[2:28:50] and Next Generation in a box next
[2:28:53] Generation in a box
[2:28:55] Next Generation in a box
[2:28:58] Next Generation in a box
[2:29:00] and they were convinced
[2:29:03] they were fighting to prove this bird
[2:29:06] will forget how to build a nest
[2:29:09] generation of the generation of the
[2:29:11] generation of the generation of the
[2:29:13] generation of a box
[2:29:15] till it came to the day I love this
[2:29:18] inspiration
