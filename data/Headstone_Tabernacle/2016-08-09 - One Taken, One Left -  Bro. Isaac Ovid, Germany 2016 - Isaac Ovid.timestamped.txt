[58:07] amen so I'm under great expectation to
[58:10] see God do exceedingly abundantly above
[58:14] all that we could ask or think and God's
[58:17] Prophet taught us that you could only
[58:19] get what you
[58:21] expect he said if you expect to see
[58:24] simple things you'll you'll see simp
[58:26] simple things but you expect to see
[58:28] Jesus Christ on the scene you will see
[58:30] Jesus Christ on the scene so I don't
[58:34] know how high your expectation is this
[58:37] morning but I know how high my
[58:40] expectation is this morning because I
[58:42] serve a big God I serve a powerful God
[58:46] he is an eternal God and he has never
[58:49] failed me yet and he will never fail you
[58:52] can the church say
[58:54] Amen so I feel unworthy this morning to
[58:59] speak after the brothers who have gone
[59:00] before but it's my lot this morning to
[59:03] stand before the purchase of the blood
[59:05] of Jesus Christ so I'd like to go
[59:07] straight to the word this morning if you
[59:10] have your Bibles would you turn with me
[59:12] to two
[59:13] portions of
[59:15] scripture reading from The Book of
[59:18] Matthew
[59:21] 24 and
[59:23] reading First Corinthians
[59:38] 15 Matthew 24 and verse
[59:44] 40 then shall two be in the
[59:47] field the one shall be
[59:50] taken and the other
[59:52] left two men shall be grinding at the
[59:56] Mill the one shall be
[59:59] taken and the other
[1:00:02] left watch therefore for ye know not
[1:00:06] what hour your lord doth
[1:00:09] come but know this that if the good man
[1:00:13] of the house had known in what watch the
[1:00:16] thief would come he would have watched
[1:00:19] and would not have suffered his house to
[1:00:21] be broken
[1:00:22] up therefore be ye also ready
[1:00:26] for in such an hour as ye think not the
[1:00:30] son of man cometh and reading from First
[1:00:33] Corinthians chapter
[1:00:38] 15 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and reading
[1:00:42] verse
[1:00:51] 51 behold I show you a mystery which
[1:00:56] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:00:59] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:01:02] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:01:05] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:08] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:01:11] can we bow our heads for a word of
[1:01:14] prayer Heavenly Father we thank you this
[1:01:16] morning to be in the house of God lord
[1:01:20] there are so many places we could have
[1:01:22] been this morning but you have brought
[1:01:24] us here today from the east from the
[1:01:27] west from the north from the south from
[1:01:30] almost 35 countries father we have
[1:01:33] gathered Lord under the shed blood
[1:01:36] father Lord we thank you for the blood
[1:01:38] that covers Us this morning we thank you
[1:01:41] for a message of Life a message of power
[1:01:44] we thank you for a prophet in this day
[1:01:47] Lord we thank you Lord for calling us
[1:01:49] out Lord of this evil world and
[1:01:56] any man could read the scriptures but it
[1:01:59] takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life
[1:02:02] upon it may you walk out the pages of
[1:02:05] the Bible and may you deliver your
[1:02:08] people may you heal the sick this
[1:02:10] morning Lord if there's a backslider in
[1:02:13] the house today may you restore them if
[1:02:16] there's somebody who doesn't know you in
[1:02:18] the power of the Resurrection May they
[1:02:21] have an experience this morning with a
[1:02:24] pillar of Fire May the angel that one
[1:02:27] with the swep back Wings may he move
[1:02:30] through the camp this morning Lord and
[1:02:32] put a mark upon those that sigh and cry
[1:02:35] Lord may you break every chain
[1:02:37] Hallelujah may you break every shackle
[1:02:41] Satan the blood of Jesus is against you
[1:02:44] father we thank you for such a time as
[1:02:47] this that we could feel your presence
[1:02:50] that we could feel your anointing may
[1:02:52] you take me out of the way and may you
[1:02:55] speak speak directly to your people in
[1:02:57] the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[1:03:00] the church says and the church says and
[1:03:04] the church says amen you may be seated
[1:03:07] this
[1:03:09] morning so I have a title this
[1:03:12] morning and my title is one
[1:03:16] taken one
[1:03:18] left one
[1:03:21] taken one left and my subject rapturing
[1:03:27] condition my inspiration the
[1:03:30] token will be
[1:03:33] displayed and in the message Christ is
[1:03:36] the mystery of God
[1:03:38] revealed God's Prophet said God had a
[1:03:41] purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's
[1:03:44] what we want to speak about this morning
[1:03:47] the mystery of God this world is a
[1:03:51] mystery to this day scientists are still
[1:03:54] trying to understand understand what is
[1:03:57] happening around us whatever we cannot
[1:04:00] explain is a mystery until you
[1:04:04] understand something it is a mystery to
[1:04:07] you I'm holding a microphone this
[1:04:10] morning without a cord it's a mystery
[1:04:12] how the sound is moving from this
[1:04:14] instrument through the speakers this
[1:04:17] didn't happen a 100 years ago it was
[1:04:20] here all the time but it was a mystery
[1:04:22] and this great God is a mystery
[1:04:26] God himself is a mystery and and way
[1:04:29] back before there was a sun before there
[1:04:32] was a moon before there was a star
[1:04:34] before you had a trial before you had a
[1:04:38] test before you felt pain in your body
[1:04:41] before you ever had a headache this
[1:04:44] great mysterious God he existed all by
[1:04:48] himself he was the self-existing one
[1:04:51] Lord he couldn't even be called God
[1:04:54] because God's prophet daers God means
[1:04:57] object of worship and when he existed by
[1:05:00] himself there was nobody to worship him
[1:05:04] so God had certain things he had to
[1:05:06] express so he created the angels and the
[1:05:10] angels they began to worship him and it
[1:05:13] began to change who he was God was
[1:05:16] expressing who he was he was omnipotent
[1:05:20] he was omniscient he is all powerful but
[1:05:24] God had to find a
[1:05:28] way he had to find a way to take this
[1:05:32] great mystery and bring it down to
[1:05:36] Simplicity you don't hear me this
[1:05:38] morning our minds could never understand
[1:05:42] this great God but if the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost you don't hear me this morning if
[1:05:48] the holy ghost ever gets a hold of you
[1:05:51] something comes over you you could never
[1:05:56] understand this great God with your
[1:05:59] intellect you could never understand
[1:06:03] this great God by reading books you
[1:06:06] could never understand this great God
[1:06:10] unless you meet him for yourself because
[1:06:13] one experience with the supernatural it
[1:06:18] takes over you it takes control of you
[1:06:21] can somebody say
[1:06:23] Amen you may be seated
[1:06:27] Hallelujah you may be seated for a
[1:06:30] minute I'm a young person Hallelujah I
[1:06:33] was not privileged to be on the earth
[1:06:37] when God's prophet he walked the Earth
[1:06:40] but I believe every word from this
[1:06:45] prophet and this Prophet taught us that
[1:06:48] if there is no
[1:06:51] noise there is no
[1:06:54] God can the church say Amen because God
[1:06:59] is the object of worship and worship has
[1:07:03] nothing to do with what you have worship
[1:07:08] has nothing to do with what you feel
[1:07:12] worship has nothing to do with what
[1:07:15] country you come from worship has
[1:07:19] nothing to do with what you believe
[1:07:22] worship has everything to do with who he
[1:07:26] is he is God he is Jehovah Gyra he is
[1:07:31] the provider he is the alpha he is the
[1:07:35] Omega he is the beginning and he is the
[1:07:38] ending he is the first he is the last
[1:07:43] there is none like him there is no one
[1:07:45] greater we are not here we are not here
[1:07:50] in this convention to hear a man speak
[1:07:53] we are here to meet God himself brother
[1:07:57] Brandon brought a message to introduce
[1:08:01] Messiah and I say this morning Messiah
[1:08:05] is on the earth Messiah is on the earth
[1:08:10] can the church say
[1:08:12] Amen you may be seated I feel happy this
[1:08:16] morning I feel excited this morning you
[1:08:19] may be seated one time there was a woman
[1:08:22] in the
[1:08:24] Bible you see
[1:08:26] something happens when you catch a
[1:08:28] revelation of who you are what you are
[1:08:32] born to do until that Revelation becomes
[1:08:36] real to you you walk around anyway you
[1:08:41] walk into the bar you walk into the club
[1:08:44] you live all kinds of life but when the
[1:08:47] Holy Ghost introduces himself to you you
[1:08:51] cannot explain it you cannot tell
[1:08:54] somebody about it but something comes
[1:08:56] over you you may be
[1:09:01] seated are there any Christians in the
[1:09:05] house this morning do we have any
[1:09:08] believers in the house this morning do
[1:09:11] you love Jesus this morning will you
[1:09:14] serve him this morning can the church
[1:09:18] say
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:23] hallelujah you may be
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:27] so this mystery that we are speaking
[1:09:30] about am do you know that you are a
[1:09:34] mystery I want to take my time brother
[1:09:37] zigma we got many translators I want to
[1:09:40] make sure you get it young people you
[1:09:43] are a
[1:09:44] mystery your school will never
[1:09:47] understand you your teachers will never
[1:09:51] understand you your neighbors will never
[1:09:54] understand you
[1:09:55] your family will never understand you
[1:09:59] because you are a mystery the only
[1:10:01] person who knows this mystery he's above
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:08] Hallelujah let me say that again the
[1:10:10] only person who knows who you are he's
[1:10:13] above in other words your pastor doesn't
[1:10:16] even know who you are the preacher don't
[1:10:18] even know who you are because who you
[1:10:21] are could only come from the one who
[1:10:23] wrote the names in the book Hallelujah
[1:10:27] before the
[1:10:28] foundation of the world some names were
[1:10:32] written in the book and every name that
[1:10:36] was written will be delivered brother
[1:10:39] brandom said in the message taking sides
[1:10:42] with Jesus he said the message will fall
[1:10:45] into the hands of the
[1:10:48] predestinated you didn't find this
[1:10:50] message this message found you in
[1:10:53] Germany in Canada in Sierra Leon in
[1:10:58] Ivory Coast this message spoken by a
[1:11:03] prophet you may be seated when he spoke
[1:11:07] those words once it's spoken because the
[1:11:10] Bible says my word shall never return
[1:11:13] void once it's spoken over your life you
[1:11:17] could turn around you could hide like
[1:11:20] Jonah but that word will find you
[1:11:23] wherever you are that word will find
[1:11:27] your son that word will find your
[1:11:30] daughter that word will find every
[1:11:33] predestinated
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:36] seed you may be
[1:11:39] seated can the church
[1:11:42] amen can I slow down a little bit can I
[1:11:46] take my time a little bit so this great
[1:11:49] mystery it was too big this mysterious
[1:11:52] God he was too powerful he could do
[1:11:56] anything he is Sovereign but God wanted
[1:12:00] to express himself he did not want to
[1:12:03] remain a
[1:12:05] mystery and this mystery was so great
[1:12:08] amen it took centuries huj for him to
[1:12:12] slowly reveal
[1:12:14] himself he never wanted to be
[1:12:19] complicated this message is not supposed
[1:12:21] to be
[1:12:23] complicated but the BR brought a message
[1:12:26] of
[1:12:27] Simplicity if God could take Peter who
[1:12:30] couldn't write his name and do another
[1:12:33] book of Acts God could take you today
[1:12:37] you don't need a degree to meet this
[1:12:40] Jesus you don't need education to meet
[1:12:43] this Jesus you don't hear me this
[1:12:46] morning you may be
[1:12:50] seated this great mystery of God he
[1:12:53] wanted anybody to be able to talk with
[1:12:56] him you could be 8 years old or you
[1:12:59] could be 99 years old this great
[1:13:02] mysterious God wanted to commune with
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:18] somebody don't worry this is just the
[1:13:21] background I haven't gotten to the
[1:13:23] message yet I'm just testing the
[1:13:26] temperature because brother brandom said
[1:13:28] the
[1:13:29] atmosphere must be right for the
[1:13:32] miraculous to take place so we're
[1:13:34] turning the heat up sometime may take
[1:13:36] some time but we're going to get there
[1:13:39] we're going to heat this place up until
[1:13:41] your fears don't matter until your
[1:13:44] sickness doesn't matter we're going to
[1:13:46] turn the heat up until your mistakes and
[1:13:49] your mind doesn't matter anymore
[1:13:51] somebody say Amen so you may be seated
[1:13:55] am so God had to find a way to take this
[1:13:59] great mystery and bring it into
[1:14:02] simplicity so brother Bram taught us
[1:14:05] that when David was living and when
[1:14:08] Moses was living and when Abraham was
[1:14:11] living they did not even know what they
[1:14:15] were living out
[1:14:18] Hallelujah so God spoke to Moses and
[1:14:21] Moses died not fully understanding in
[1:14:26] that there was a deeper mystery being
[1:14:29] unfolded through his life because God
[1:14:32] had certain attributes he was a
[1:14:35] deliverer but at the beginning there was
[1:14:38] nobody to
[1:14:39] deliver that's right amen are you with
[1:14:42] me this morning so God picked Moses to
[1:14:46] express that mystery of Deliverance
[1:14:49] because it was Christ in Moses are you
[1:14:51] with me this morning God in him was the
[1:14:55] attribute to be a
[1:14:57] Shepherd so he had to find somebody to
[1:15:01] reveal this mystery of being a Shepherd
[1:15:03] so he found a boy called David can the
[1:15:06] church say Amen what is God doing he is
[1:15:09] revealing himself he is slowly unveiling
[1:15:13] who he is because he wants to introduce
[1:15:17] himself to his people he wants you to
[1:15:20] know a god with skin on it can the
[1:15:23] church say Amen so God found somebody
[1:15:26] named Joshua and he said Joshua you will
[1:15:29] Express the warrior that I am can the
[1:15:32] church say amen he found a man called
[1:15:35] Elijah and he said Elijah you will
[1:15:37] perform the prophet that I am can the
[1:15:41] church say Amen but every one of them
[1:15:44] was only
[1:15:46] expressing a part of this great mystery
[1:15:51] of God now there is a difference between
[1:15:55] part of the mystery and the
[1:15:58] fullness of the mystery are you with me
[1:16:01] this morning Hallelujah so the entire of
[1:16:04] the Old Testament was parts of the
[1:16:07] mystery it was a part here it was a part
[1:16:10] there it was a part there but when Jesus
[1:16:14] came Jesus Christ was the entire mystery
[1:16:18] of God revealed can the church say Amen
[1:16:23] oh Hallelujah are you with me this
[1:16:26] morning you may be seated so young
[1:16:28] people you are a mystery your trials are
[1:16:32] a part of your mystery your ups and your
[1:16:35] Downs they are a part of your mystery
[1:16:38] it's a process that you don't yet
[1:16:41] understand but there's nothing by
[1:16:44] accident there is nothing by chance God
[1:16:48] does not make mistakes there is no
[1:16:51] mistake this morning you couldn't be
[1:16:53] here unless he wanted you here this
[1:16:56] morning and because you are here you are
[1:16:59] going to receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:17:01] you are here you shall be delivered
[1:17:05] because you are here you shall have an
[1:17:07] experience with the same Pillar of Fire
[1:17:11] with the same angel of God can the
[1:17:13] church say
[1:17:15] Amen you may be
[1:17:17] seated I'm still warming
[1:17:20] up haven't gotten to the text yet can
[1:17:23] the Church Say Amen yeah Revelation
[1:17:27] 10:7 but in the days of the voice huah
[1:17:31] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:17:34] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:17:39] finished as he had declared to his
[1:17:42] servants the prophet can the church say
[1:17:45] Amen so all these centuries this was
[1:17:47] leading up to something until a seventh
[1:17:50] angel was under scene to tie up all the
[1:17:54] loose
[1:17:55] to connect the dots to make it simple so
[1:17:59] that in our day we didn't see Moses we
[1:18:03] didn't see Joshua we didn't see Elijah
[1:18:06] some of us didn't even see the prophet
[1:18:08] but in the days of his
[1:18:11] voice the mystery is finished no more
[1:18:15] mystery no more secrets it's open to us
[1:18:19] that's why I could worship that's why I
[1:18:22] could shout it doesn't matter to me what
[1:18:26] anybody else does because I know I come
[1:18:29] from God and I'm going back to God can
[1:18:32] the church say amen and there is no
[1:18:35] devil could hold me there is no demon
[1:18:38] could stop me there is no sickness can
[1:18:40] hold me you may be
[1:18:43] seated in The Minister's meeting I said
[1:18:46] the devil could have some but he cannot
[1:18:48] have all God will have some young people
[1:18:52] in
[1:18:53] 2016 God will have some individuals in
[1:18:57] Ukraine in Russia in Germany in France
[1:19:02] in Africa who will testify that Jesus
[1:19:05] Christ is the same yesterday he is the
[1:19:09] same today he is the same
[1:19:12] forever you may be
[1:19:14] seated but the brandham told us he said
[1:19:18] it's easy to talk about yesterday
[1:19:21] because it's already happened he say
[1:19:24] it's ni
[1:19:25] to talk about the future because anybody
[1:19:28] could talk about the future but God he
[1:19:31] is the same yesterday he is the same
[1:19:33] today and he's the same
[1:19:36] forever s is this the time because
[1:19:39] something is happening right now demons
[1:19:42] are leaving right now you are being
[1:19:44] healed right now Revelation is coming to
[1:19:48] you right now the power of God is here
[1:19:51] right now we don't need to wait till
[1:19:53] tomorrow we don't need to wait till next
[1:19:56] month now Faith is now Faith is can the
[1:20:01] church say
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:05] hallelujah
[1:20:07] amen hallelujah you may be
[1:20:11] seated so when you were
[1:20:14] saved when you were saved that was only
[1:20:18] a part of the mystery when you came into
[1:20:23] this message that was only a part of
[1:20:26] this mystery you are here in this
[1:20:29] convention but that's only a part of the
[1:20:33] mystery there's coming a time when the
[1:20:36] mystery will be finished can the church
[1:20:39] say
[1:20:40] Amen but the brandom said a mystery is
[1:20:45] scripture previously hidden truth now
[1:20:49] divinely
[1:20:50] revealed but a supernatural element
[1:20:55] Still Remains despite the
[1:20:59] Revelation so God give you a revelation
[1:21:02] but despite the Revelation that you have
[1:21:06] there is still a supernatural
[1:21:08] element that
[1:21:13] remains can the church say amen amen so
[1:21:16] what we want to get friends is not just
[1:21:19] a divine
[1:21:22] revelation and I tell young people all
[1:21:24] the time if there was anyone in
[1:21:26] scripture who had a revelation was
[1:21:29] Peter because in Matthew 16 when Jesus
[1:21:33] is fellowshipping with his
[1:21:35] disciples he asks the question who do
[1:21:38] men say that I
[1:21:40] am and these brothers were spiritual and
[1:21:44] they began to tell Jesus all the good
[1:21:46] things that they had heard people say
[1:21:48] about him but that was the Preamble that
[1:21:52] was not the real question Jesus want
[1:21:54] wanted because he is a god of the
[1:21:57] individual it's not about what this
[1:21:59] group says and what this Minister says
[1:22:02] and what that person over there says he
[1:22:05] switch on them and say who do you
[1:22:07] Hallelujah the IND who do you say that I
[1:22:11] am and all of a sudden the ministers put
[1:22:14] their notepads away and they begin to
[1:22:16] move back a little bit because they had
[1:22:18] no revelation of who he was but all of a
[1:22:22] sudden Peter said don't to cry
[1:22:25] the son of the Living God and when Peter
[1:22:28] spoke this Jesus said Flesh and Blood
[1:22:31] did not reveal this to you you did not
[1:22:33] hear this in a convention no Minister
[1:22:36] sat with you but my father my father
[1:22:41] give you a revelation and if you ever
[1:22:44] get a revelation from God nothing can
[1:22:47] move you nothing could shake you nothing
[1:22:50] could change you somebody say
[1:22:53] Amen
[1:23:00] but you may be seated I'm trying to go
[1:23:03] somewhere I want you to understand
[1:23:06] [Applause]
[1:23:08] because I was I I'm born and grew up in
[1:23:11] this message I'm young but I'm grw up in
[1:23:15] this message Hallelujah and I've heard
[1:23:16] people explain this and explain that and
[1:23:20] teach this and teach that I'm not a
[1:23:22] preacher I'm not a minister I'm just to
[1:23:25] nobody trying to tell everybody about
[1:23:28] somebody who could change anybody but
[1:23:32] the one thing I know Peter had a
[1:23:35] revelation and a few verses down Jesus
[1:23:39] the Bible said for the first time he's
[1:23:41] able to reveal a secret to his disciples
[1:23:45] that he could not say before so he was
[1:23:47] checking them out before he could open
[1:23:50] their understanding a little further so
[1:23:53] when he was sufficiently satisfied that
[1:23:56] they had answered the question of who he
[1:23:59] was he began to explain well I have to
[1:24:02] go and be crucified and and he began to
[1:24:04] tell him and Peter said
[1:24:06] no and this same Peter who had a
[1:24:12] revelation God was get the behind me
[1:24:15] Satan because even though he had a
[1:24:18] revelation of the message of the hour he
[1:24:22] had still a destination was still an
[1:24:25] upper room experience that Peter had to
[1:24:28] get to connect his Revelation to the
[1:24:33] Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost despite the Revelation a
[1:24:37] supernatural element still remained
[1:24:41] there are many people here with a
[1:24:44] revelation but I feel it's time for that
[1:24:47] supernal element I believe it's time for
[1:24:52] the Holy Ghost itself I believe it's
[1:24:54] time for God
[1:24:58] himself you may be
[1:25:00] seated what did brother brandham said he
[1:25:03] said the pillar of fire will be veiled
[1:25:07] in the adopted Sons that's not a book
[1:25:10] that's not a tape that's not you hearing
[1:25:13] a message that's God himself in the
[1:25:16] socket of your soul can the church say
[1:25:19] Amen is that what you want is that your
[1:25:23] expectation
[1:25:25] you may be
[1:25:26] seated you know in the upper room in the
[1:25:30] upper room every individual in the upper
[1:25:34] room got their own liqu of fire I
[1:25:38] couldn't take the fire from my brother I
[1:25:40] couldn't take the fire from the pastor
[1:25:43] every individual had their own
[1:25:46] experience with God and I challenge you
[1:25:50] today if you have never had an
[1:25:52] experience with God don't you leave this
[1:25:56] convention until you hold on to the
[1:25:59] horns of the Altar and say Lord I've
[1:26:02] heard by the hearing of the a but now
[1:26:06] this is my time This Is My Season I'm
[1:26:09] not going back I've come too far I've
[1:26:13] come too far I've traveled for too long
[1:26:17] to give up now I'm not going to turn
[1:26:20] back I need something more a book is not
[1:26:23] good enough
[1:26:24] a tape is not good you may be
[1:26:32] seated
[1:26:35] hallelujah
[1:26:39] hallelujah Peter Andrew James John these
[1:26:46] brothers walked with Jesus could you
[1:26:50] imagine Walk With Jesus talk with Jesus
[1:26:55] sit next to Jesus see what Jesus is
[1:26:58] eating see what Jesus is drinking taking
[1:27:01] notes about the way he lived what an
[1:27:07] experience to see Jesus walking on on
[1:27:12] two
[1:27:13] feet but yet
[1:27:16] still these brothers were hiding in the
[1:27:20] upper
[1:27:23] room
[1:27:25] they were
[1:27:26] afraid after three and a half
[1:27:29] years of being with the word
[1:27:32] itself these
[1:27:34] brothers witnessed Jesus's resurrection
[1:27:38] Ministry there was no doubt in their
[1:27:41] minds that he was risen the Bible says
[1:27:45] he opened their understanding to the
[1:27:48] scriptures so they had seen him they had
[1:27:51] seen the Miracles they understand
[1:27:54] standing was opened and yet still they
[1:27:56] were
[1:27:58] hiding they were
[1:28:00] afraid and when you read the scripture I
[1:28:03] believe it's over about 66 times Jesus
[1:28:06] says fear
[1:28:08] not you could check the number fear not
[1:28:12] fear not it is I fear not when he's
[1:28:15] walking under the water he says fear
[1:28:17] not and after all of this Peter is
[1:28:21] afraid James is afraid
[1:28:25] but there was something that was greater
[1:28:27] than their fear it was not a revelation
[1:28:30] it was not their understanding being
[1:28:32] opened but the Bible says all of a
[1:28:34] sudden there came a sound from Heaven as
[1:28:37] of a rushing Mighty Wind and it fill all
[1:28:40] the house where they were sitting and
[1:28:43] then Peter walked out of the upper room
[1:28:46] and he was staggering under the
[1:28:48] anointing he couldn't even keep straight
[1:28:50] anymore everything he knew was finished
[1:28:52] he couldn't even look at anybody well
[1:28:54] said this is that which was spoken by
[1:28:56] the prophet Joel this is that this is
[1:29:00] the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] what we need today is more Holy Ghost
[1:29:06] Services what we need is another day of
[1:29:09] Pentecost can the church say
[1:29:16] Amen you may be
[1:29:20] seated I'm going to get to my text in a
[1:29:22] few minutes
[1:29:30] Hallelujah the ROM taught us that you
[1:29:32] are not the
[1:29:33] believer but the word in you that seed
[1:29:37] in you that's the believer so you didn't
[1:29:39] come to this convention the word in you
[1:29:42] is crying out for something that's why
[1:29:45] you are here it's a mystery trying to
[1:29:49] express
[1:29:50] itself you may be seated let's talk
[1:29:53] about Jes Jesus Does anybody love to
[1:29:55] talk about
[1:29:57] Jesus you know how many meetings people
[1:30:00] have and they don't even talk about
[1:30:01] Jesus and I thought that's the reason
[1:30:04] that we are here to talk about Jesus so
[1:30:08] I want to talk about Jesus for a few
[1:30:09] minutes then I'll get to my text but I
[1:30:11] want you to think for a minute of
[1:30:14] Jesus as a little boy Growing
[1:30:18] Up 5 years old 6 years old 10 years old
[1:30:22] he's Young
[1:30:25] I'm sure he had friends he played
[1:30:27] with he's a he's a young boy he's
[1:30:29] growing up but he's a mystery
[1:30:33] amen he goes to the temple like all the
[1:30:37] other young people but he's a
[1:30:40] mystery whatever school they had he went
[1:30:43] there but he is a mystery amen the Bible
[1:30:47] says in Luke 4 he was in the synagogue
[1:30:49] as was his custom it was not the first
[1:30:53] time time in Luke 4 that Jesus was in
[1:30:55] the temple he was always in church but
[1:30:58] nobody knew who he really was nobody
[1:31:01] paid any attention to him he was coming
[1:31:03] in and out the meetings like everybody
[1:31:06] else he looked like everybody else
[1:31:08] dressed like everybody else there was
[1:31:10] nothing about him that would draw
[1:31:13] attention to him because he was a
[1:31:16] mystery this was brother Jesus could you
[1:31:19] imagine in the service turn around and
[1:31:22] greet your brother and and they're
[1:31:24] turning around and greeting one another
[1:31:26] and Jesus is in the synagogue Hallelujah
[1:31:31] I want you to think about it friends but
[1:31:33] but a different day came and they and
[1:31:35] they invited brother Jesus would you
[1:31:38] come and and read for
[1:31:41] us he's a mystery nobody knows who he is
[1:31:44] and he gets there like everybody else
[1:31:46] who is called before to read the
[1:31:48] scriptures and he finds a
[1:31:51] scripture spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:31:54] for he had anointed me to and everybody
[1:31:58] thinks it's an ordinary service because
[1:32:01] this is what you normally do in a
[1:32:03] service Hallelujah come there are people
[1:32:06] sleeping on the side and taking notes in
[1:32:09] the back and that's brother Jesus but
[1:32:13] all of a sudden when he when he closed
[1:32:15] the
[1:32:16] scriptures before he walks away he says
[1:32:19] something he says this day this
[1:32:22] scripture is
[1:32:24] fulfilled and all of a sudden the
[1:32:27] mystery of who he was was made
[1:32:33] clear can the church say Amen oh are you
[1:32:36] hearing me this
[1:32:40] morning you may be
[1:32:42] seated and brother brandham said if you
[1:32:45] read the Bible and do not see Jesus in
[1:32:50] every verse you need to read it again
[1:32:55] yes I'll say that one more time he said
[1:32:58] if you read the Bible and you don't see
[1:33:00] Jesus in every verse go read it again
[1:33:04] and again and again because it's all
[1:33:07] about Jesus every scripture in the Old
[1:33:10] Testament was pointing towards
[1:33:13] Jesus so when Isaiah said a virgin shall
[1:33:17] conceive that was scripture it was a
[1:33:20] word it was spoken but listen that word
[1:33:24] had to wait until a body came along to
[1:33:28] manifest that
[1:33:30] scripture are you with me this morning I
[1:33:33] want you to get this then I'll get to my
[1:33:34] text so the word went out a virgin shall
[1:33:37] conceive and that word it's scripture
[1:33:41] and that word had to wait until a
[1:33:44] body came along because the word
[1:33:48] expressed itself through something until
[1:33:51] a body came along to manifest it
[1:33:55] so people look at
[1:33:57] scripture but when God looks at it he
[1:34:00] doesn't see scripture
[1:34:04] Hallelujah am we read scripture and we
[1:34:07] see scripture but when God looks at it
[1:34:10] he's not seeing scripture he is seeing
[1:34:12] names
[1:34:14] Hallelujah so when Isaiah said a virgin
[1:34:16] shall conceive God is saying that's
[1:34:22] Mary
[1:34:27] but the brandham taught us that God is
[1:34:29] coming for a book A book of redemption a
[1:34:31] book of
[1:34:33] names so it's a book of names he is
[1:34:36] coming for so when the book says the
[1:34:39] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:34:41] that's in your book but when God is
[1:34:44] looking he's saying that's John the
[1:34:45] Baptist
[1:34:51] Hallelujah can the church amen so for
[1:34:55] years people read Malachi 45 and 6 and
[1:34:58] people say that's scripture but when God
[1:35:00] looks he said that's William
[1:35:05] Brandon and he's coming for a book of
[1:35:09] names and when God speaks of a people
[1:35:12] that know their God that shall do
[1:35:15] exploits he was speaking about
[1:35:20] somebody was it you was it you was it
[1:35:26] you brother I say today you are the
[1:35:30] words in the book and every name in the
[1:35:33] book shall be delivered somebody say
[1:35:39] Amen Glory
[1:35:41] Hallelujah you may be seated that's why
[1:35:43] I have faith this morning to say you
[1:35:46] shall be filled you shall be delivered
[1:35:49] you shall have a revelation you shall
[1:35:51] meet a pillar of Fire that's your
[1:35:54] promise that's your inheritance because
[1:35:57] every word that is written must come to
[1:36:01] pass can the church say
[1:36:04] Amen oh
[1:36:07] hallelujah hallelujah so the book said
[1:36:10] in Joel in the last days I will pour out
[1:36:13] my spirit upon All Flesh that's the
[1:36:18] words in the
[1:36:20] book but when God looks he's seeing
[1:36:22] Peter he's seeing the upper room because
[1:36:25] Peter comes out and says this is that
[1:36:28] which was spoken by the prophet Joel now
[1:36:32] listen friends and this is for the young
[1:36:35] people Peter did not know that he was
[1:36:39] written in the
[1:36:41] book Peter
[1:36:43] backslid Peter denied Christ Peter made
[1:36:47] mistakes but he was
[1:36:49] still in the
[1:36:51] book Hallelujah
[1:36:54] when Jesus called Peter he knew
[1:36:57] everything Peter would do amen but he
[1:37:00] was not looking at what Peter would do
[1:37:03] he was looking at the
[1:37:05] words in the book because heaven and
[1:37:09] Earth would pass away but these words in
[1:37:12] the book will never pass away can the
[1:37:15] church say
[1:37:18] Amen it was going to take some time for
[1:37:22] Peter to get a div divine revelation of
[1:37:25] who he
[1:37:27] was so what Peter did could not change
[1:37:31] his name in the book and Young Brother
[1:37:33] young sister your
[1:37:36] mistakes your failures your past what
[1:37:40] you have gone through will not change
[1:37:43] God's
[1:37:44] mind about you thank you he loves you he
[1:37:48] cares for you he'll take care of you he
[1:37:52] will make all things
[1:37:54] to work together for good because you
[1:37:56] are written in the back part of his mind
[1:37:59] how could he forget you can the church
[1:38:02] say
[1:38:04] Amen so let me strike my text you love
[1:38:06] the Lord this
[1:38:15] morning so let me strike my text one
[1:38:18] taken one left so all of this great
[1:38:21] mystery of God is Not Just for us to
[1:38:23] know Mysteries and know the message and
[1:38:27] because the scribes and the Pharisees
[1:38:28] they knew the scriptures they had the
[1:38:31] books they had the tapes and when
[1:38:32] Messiah walked among them they did not
[1:38:35] even recognize him so for all these
[1:38:39] years God has been waiting for the right
[1:38:41] season he has been waiting for the right
[1:38:44] people because the greatest Escape that
[1:38:48] the world has ever witnessed is about to
[1:38:51] take place an escape for for those who
[1:38:54] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[1:38:56] city and Escape for those who separate
[1:39:00] themselves from the things of the world
[1:39:02] and Escape for them who want the Holy
[1:39:05] Ghost and Escape for them that want to
[1:39:08] be adopted and Escape for them that want
[1:39:11] to be perfected because brother bradam
[1:39:14] said nothing will touch the bride Satan
[1:39:17] will be powerless before this bride of
[1:39:20] Jesus
[1:39:22] Christ
[1:39:24] and the angel of the Lord is on the
[1:39:26] earth now Messiah is on the earth
[1:39:29] now he was here with the prophet but
[1:39:31] when God took the prophet away the angel
[1:39:35] never
[1:39:36] left the angel is still here but the
[1:39:39] Bram said fixing things around for the
[1:39:41] coming of the Lord so the angel is here
[1:39:44] right now he's moving through the
[1:39:47] aisles he is seeing your
[1:39:50] attitude he is looking at your heart he
[1:39:53] sees if you really want him and I ask a
[1:39:57] question this morning if God were to
[1:40:00] Grant the deepest desire of your heart
[1:40:05] what is that
[1:40:07] desire this
[1:40:09] morning what do you want God to do for
[1:40:12] you in this
[1:40:14] convention what have you been sighing
[1:40:17] about what have you been crying about as
[1:40:21] for the contest said last night God gave
[1:40:23] the children of Israel a promise but
[1:40:26] they had to cry out and God could now
[1:40:29] say I have heard the cries of my
[1:40:32] people they are not comfortable with
[1:40:35] being in the message they don't want to
[1:40:38] be church members they don't want to
[1:40:41] just know that it was in this message
[1:40:43] and it was in that message and that's
[1:40:46] what he said and no they needed
[1:40:48] something more they needed Deliverance
[1:40:52] they needed a go who could break the
[1:40:54] chains break the shackles break the
[1:40:58] power of sin

[1:41:38] never forsake you he will be with you in
[1:41:41] your trials he will take you through
[1:41:44] your trials and I believe one of the
[1:41:46] brothers I believe it was brother the
[1:41:47] Tim pu it yesterday said there is no way
[1:41:50] through this there's only one way that's
[1:41:52] up
[1:41:55] stop trying to figure out how you're
[1:41:56] going to get through this we need to
[1:41:58] figure out how to get
[1:42:00] up can the church say Amen because there
[1:42:03] promised a rapture we shall not all
[1:42:06] sleep but there's coming a time where
[1:42:08] somebody is going to be changed and this
[1:42:11] Mortal will put on immortality can the
[1:42:14] church say
[1:42:17] Amen you may be seated there is a way of
[1:42:22] Escape there is a way of escape this
[1:42:25] morning brother brandham said in the
[1:42:27] message the first seal he says at the
[1:42:30] end of the Pentecostal age we are
[1:42:33] supposed to receive according to the
[1:42:36] word amen as God helped me tonight to
[1:42:39] show you that we are to receive a
[1:42:42] messenger that will take all those loose
[1:42:45] ends out there listen carefully and
[1:42:49] reveal the whole secret of God and he
[1:42:52] gives the purpose purpose
[1:42:54] Hallelujah for the
[1:42:56] rapturing of the church so the purpose
[1:43:00] of God that was revealed as the entire
[1:43:03] Secret Of God is not for us to have
[1:43:06] conventions it's not for us to make
[1:43:08] churches it's for the Rapture of the
[1:43:10] church can the church say Amen somebody
[1:43:14] is going to leave this place but there's
[1:43:16] a promise before we leave this place the
[1:43:20] sick will be healed before we leave this
[1:43:22] place place your children will be
[1:43:25] restored before we leave this place the
[1:43:28] Dynamics will connect to the mechanics
[1:43:31] before we leave this place once more the
[1:43:34] world will hear direct from
[1:43:38] God you may be
[1:43:40] seated listen friends God could never
[1:43:44] take a man off the scene unless his work
[1:43:48] is
[1:43:51] finished Glory let me say this again God
[1:43:55] could never take a man off the scene
[1:43:58] unless his work is finished brother
[1:44:00] brandham did his part yes and if that
[1:44:04] messenger was to turn the hearts of the
[1:44:06] children back yes and to get the whole
[1:44:09] mystery of God for the Rapture and God
[1:44:12] took him away it means that job is
[1:44:14] finished every mystery is revealed the
[1:44:18] whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of
[1:44:20] the church it's here brother Bram said
[1:44:22] rapture and faith is laying in the
[1:44:25] message so what are we waiting for but
[1:44:28] the P said one day the pride will get to
[1:44:31] know who she is and then the Rapture
[1:44:34] will go s is this the time for the bride
[1:44:39] to get a revelation of who she
[1:44:42] is you may be
[1:44:45] seated brother if you ever get a
[1:44:48] revelation of who you are you'll never
[1:44:50] be
[1:44:52] sad
[1:44:53] Hallelujah you'll never be depressed you
[1:44:56] will always have a smile on your face
[1:44:58] you will always look at your trials and
[1:45:01] say that's all you got

[1:45:06] the best you got there's nothing that
[1:45:09] stop me from going where God wants me to
[1:45:11] go bring your best devil bring your best
[1:45:14] because I'm a Child of God give it your
[1:45:17] best shot because all things will work
[1:45:19] together for good give me your best shot
[1:45:22] because I'm pretty destinated for the
[1:45:24] Rapture and when the devil is looking
[1:45:26] for you you'll be gone the Rapture will
[1:45:28] go because you are predestinated for it
[1:45:32] can the church say
[1:45:35] Amen you may be
[1:45:39] seated I'm not going to be too much
[1:45:41] longer but but brandham did his part and
[1:45:45] now he's
[1:45:46] waiting for you and I Paul is waiting
[1:45:51] for you and I brother Ram said the
[1:45:53] sleeping sees are waiting for somebody
[1:45:56] to come to Perfection to bring on the
[1:45:58] resurrection so there's some waiting
[1:46:00] going on the whole creation is
[1:46:03] groaning the weather is groaning the
[1:46:07] trees are growing the nations are
[1:46:11] groaning it that's why I said I don't
[1:46:14] care what they do out
[1:46:16] there the politics the Nations the
[1:46:19] government that's not my
[1:46:21] promise
[1:46:24] the devil has his job we have our job
[1:46:28] listen I've
[1:46:32] seen I've seen ministers take their time
[1:46:36] and explain the tribulation and the
[1:46:39] vials and the woes and the plagues I
[1:46:42] can't criticize nobody but the vials not
[1:46:45] mine plagues not mine tribulation not
[1:46:49] mine Rapture that's mine

[1:47:07] may be seated these divinely reveal
[1:47:10] mystery truths and they open up every
[1:47:13] single mystery but the brandom himself
[1:47:15] said there are some real seeds for the
[1:47:18] bride brother the brandham spoke about
[1:47:20] the pope he spoke about serpent seed
[1:47:22] that's wonderful but I'm not serpent
[1:47:24] seed I have nothing to do with the Pope
[1:47:27] I don't need to hear about it tell me
[1:47:29] how do I get out of
[1:47:36] here you may be
[1:47:38] seated that's what's important that's
[1:47:42] what I need because I don't belong here
[1:47:45] I'm waiting to meet David I want to see
[1:47:47] Joshua I got to testify to Moses they
[1:47:50] want to hear how you made it in the evil
[1:47:53] age

[1:48:04] test you stood as real Christians you

[1:48:35] Holy Ghost somebody wants that old
[1:48:38] fashion sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost

[1:49:20] say even so come Lord Jesus come even so
[1:49:25] glory to
[1:49:27] God you may be
[1:49:30] seated hallelujah hallu
[1:49:34] hallelujah could you
[1:49:36] imagine this is the hardest
[1:49:39] age this is the toughest age could you
[1:49:42] imagine God in his great wisdom he
[1:49:45] couldn't send David to this age this age
[1:49:49] is too hard for David this age is too to
[1:49:52] hard for Daniel this age is too hard for
[1:49:56] the three Hebrew boys this age is too
[1:49:59] difficult for Peter so God had to find
[1:50:01] some people who are qualified who are
[1:50:04] qualified to be in this age they have no
[1:50:08] strength of their own they have no
[1:50:10] ability of their own but God
[1:50:12] predestinated them and he put a seed
[1:50:16] inside of your soul and that seed it
[1:50:19] might be covered up this morning but
[1:50:21] that's all right
[1:50:23] that's all right once the seed is there
[1:50:26] every seed must bring forth after its
[1:50:30] kind there's no other way that's the law
[1:50:33] of God and God's law unbreakable God's
[1:50:37] law unchangeable he says I am the Lord
[1:50:40] and I change
[1:50:41] not can the church say Amen oh I'm
[1:50:45] excited come on young people come on
[1:50:48] young people come on young
[1:50:51] people
[1:50:53] oh
[1:50:54] Hallelujah you may be
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:51:00] seated brother brandham brought a
[1:51:03] message for young people he brought a
[1:51:07] message for a new generation it's been
[1:51:10] 50 years since brother brandham
[1:51:14] left those that brother brandham
[1:51:16] ministered to
[1:51:18] 99% they're no longer here but there's a
[1:51:21] new generation that God called out they
[1:51:24] were not there in the 50s they were not
[1:51:26] there in the 60s but they started maybe
[1:51:28] in the 70s maybe the 80s maybe the 90s
[1:51:32] maybe to the 2000s but something got a
[1:51:35] hold of you you couldn't explain to your
[1:51:38] family what pulled you from the Catholic
[1:51:41] Church what pulled you from the
[1:51:42] Methodist Church what pulled you from
[1:51:44] the Baptist Church but it was a pull in
[1:51:46] your heart and young
[1:51:49] people it doesn't matter what they do in
[1:51:51] the school or on the job you will never
[1:51:55] be comfortable in the
[1:51:59] world you could never fit in you are cut
[1:52:03] differently so you try to fit here
[1:52:06] doesn't fit fit here doesn't fit but the
[1:52:09] brandom call it OD
[1:52:12] ball there's something different about
[1:52:14] you you try drinking it it didn't work
[1:52:18] for you you tried the singing didn't
[1:52:20] work for you the songs they don't make
[1:52:22] sense but you struggle up one day down
[1:52:26] one day you got to go to work it's not
[1:52:28] easy to go to work all the co-workers
[1:52:32] they live a certain way you go to the
[1:52:34] lunchroom you're trying to eat you don't
[1:52:37] know if you want to pray for your meal
[1:52:38] because everybody's watching you and you
[1:52:40] you go this whole tug of wall anybody
[1:52:42] anybody in the
[1:52:44] house they tell you you have to dress a
[1:52:47] certain way to be
[1:52:50] professional you got to be a profession
[1:52:52] Prof so you got to dress a certain way
[1:52:54] and you got to go to certain work
[1:52:56] functions because you want to get a
[1:52:58] promotion and when my Bible tells me
[1:53:01] promotion doesn't come from the east or
[1:53:03] the West it comes from the
[1:53:06] Lord I don't care if your boss doesn't
[1:53:09] like you once God likes you that's all
[1:53:13] that
[1:53:15] matters listen you may be
[1:53:18] seated if God would change the law so
[1:53:22] that Mary would come to Bethlehem God
[1:53:25] could change your boss he could change
[1:53:28] your company he could change the law to
[1:53:31] make sure that you are taken care of can
[1:53:35] the church say
[1:53:36] [Applause]
[1:53:38] Amen you may be seated but that's a
[1:53:41] problem today a lot of people today they
[1:53:43] don't want to prove
[1:53:46] God they don't want to prove God so when
[1:53:48] God went to Gideon say Gideon th Mighty
[1:53:51] Man of Valor
[1:53:53] Gideon looked
[1:53:54] around yes he said wait a minute wrong
[1:53:59] man I'm from the smallest
[1:54:01] tribe my family is the smallest family
[1:54:05] and I'm the smallest one in my family
[1:54:08] but when God began to talk to him
[1:54:10] Gideon's question was if God is God then
[1:54:15] where are all the
[1:54:18] Miracles he wanted to see something more
[1:54:21] than what he had heard about
[1:54:22] he had heard about the Red Sea he had
[1:54:25] heard about coming out of Egypt but he
[1:54:27] was not there so he said if this is real
[1:54:30] then then then where are all the
[1:54:31] Miracles and in our day we say where is
[1:54:34] the Lord God of Elijah because we know
[1:54:39] Elijah we know about Elijah but we want
[1:54:42] the god of
[1:54:44] Elijah is that your prayer is that your
[1:54:48] expectation can the Church Say
[1:54:51] Amen
[1:54:53] Hallelujah you may be
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:54:57] seated you know it's so wonderful Glory
[1:55:01] Glory but the brandham would look out
[1:55:02] into the audience and he would see all
[1:55:06] kinds of things one time but the
[1:55:07] brandham said he he preferred to go out
[1:55:09] in solitude at times because he saw what
[1:55:12] was in the hearts of the people around
[1:55:14] him and he needed to escape a little bit
[1:55:18] and I could just imagine God is looking
[1:55:20] down right now and he's seeing what you
[1:55:21] have on the inside that you don't even
[1:55:23] know is there some of you haven't lift
[1:55:26] your hands in a long time because you've
[1:55:29] been under so much pressure but you know
[1:55:31] what brother Bram said he said the law
[1:55:33] of gravity keeps things down he said but
[1:55:35] when you lift your hand he said it takes
[1:55:38] something Supernatural to defy the law
[1:55:41] of gravity and you could lift your hands
[1:55:43] and say thank you Jesus
[1:55:48] Hallelujah the fact that you can lift
[1:55:50] your hands to God shows that there's a
[1:55:53] supernatural element that is connecting
[1:55:56] to something higher because gravity
[1:55:58] wants to keep you down but there's a
[1:56:00] power trying to pull you up because you
[1:56:03] belong in Heavenly places you belong in
[1:56:05] the heavenlies where was thou when the
[1:56:07] sons of God shouted for Joy you were
[1:56:10] there you were there you were there you
[1:56:13] were shouting can the Church Say
[1:56:21] Amen
[1:56:31] Hallelujah so we're talking about the
[1:56:35] Rapture and Satan doesn't know
[1:56:37] when Satan doesn't know how Satan
[1:56:41] doesn't know who because this Rapture is
[1:56:44] a
[1:56:45] mystery because if he knew he could do
[1:56:47] great damage so the devil had only one
[1:56:50] option to try to infiltrate the church
[1:56:53] and I said to the young people the devil
[1:56:55] is not in the world trying to get those
[1:56:57] he already
[1:56:59] has he already has them so the Devil
[1:57:03] comes to
[1:57:04] church greets the Believers infiltrate
[1:57:08] with all kinds of doctrines and ideas
[1:57:10] and and and I think it's this and I
[1:57:12] think it's that but Brandon brought one
[1:57:14] message not 5 10 12
[1:57:19] 82 one message get ready for the Rapture
[1:57:23] one message destroy the works of
[1:57:26] darkness because Satan came into God's
[1:57:29] Eden but now we're in Satan's Eden and
[1:57:32] God has a bride who will not be like Eve
[1:57:35] and be deceived and give the devil the
[1:57:37] final knockout punch because after the
[1:57:40] devil met David he got back up he met
[1:57:43] Joshua he got back up he met Elijah he
[1:57:46] got back up but the Bram said when he
[1:57:47] met Jesus he went away for a
[1:57:50] season because Christ himself was on the
[1:57:53] Earth but over the ages the devil was
[1:57:56] always there looking around trying to
[1:57:57] see what he could do but God waited
[1:58:00] until he got the Navy
[1:58:03] Seals Special Forces secret agents in
[1:58:07] this age individuals who don't look like
[1:58:11] they are agents they don't look like
[1:58:13] they are soldiers but they are soldiers
[1:58:16] anyhow young people calebs they look
[1:58:19] that's why brother Brandon said when you
[1:58:21] get over there you'll see people you
[1:58:22] never thought would make
[1:58:31] it see people you never thought would
[1:58:33] make it so Satan had one
[1:58:37] strategy to try to stop you from getting
[1:58:42] access to the
[1:58:44] Rapture to make sure that you do not
[1:58:47] receive the Holy Ghost that's what the
[1:58:48] devil is trying to do brother bam said
[1:58:50] in the message question and answer he
[1:58:52] said before there was a world you were
[1:58:54] in God's thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:58:56] Ghost amen because he knew you'd be
[1:58:59] wanting it and he chose you himself he
[1:59:02] chose you in Christ listen before you or
[1:59:06] Jesus any of you was on the earth and He
[1:59:09] sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to
[1:59:12] send the Holy
[1:59:13] Ghost listen to The Prophet's words to
[1:59:16] think it's not what I wanted it wasn't
[1:59:20] my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't
[1:59:24] my choosing it had not one thing to do
[1:59:27] with it but before the world ever
[1:59:30] started God saw us and put our name on
[1:59:34] the Lamb's Book of Life talk about God
[1:59:37] can the church say
[1:59:43] Amen I'm not going to be too much longer
[1:59:47] so we spoke about Malachi 4 revealed
[1:59:49] many things he spoke of a power coming
[1:59:51] to the the church he spoke of the
[1:59:53] manifestation of the sons of God once
[1:59:57] more the world will hear direct from God
[1:59:59] he spoke of a perfect Church a church
[2:00:02] with Jesus Christ walking in it a church
[2:00:05] where sin cannot stay in it the same
[2:00:09] Jesus who healed the sick raised the
[2:00:11] dead would be veiled in that church in
[2:00:15] individuals the mystery that has been
[2:00:17] hid which is Christ in you the hope of
[2:00:20] glory and what is revealed the Bible
[2:00:23] says it belongs to
[2:00:25] us can the church say amen and you want
[2:00:29] to tell me I can't be happy and you want
[2:00:32] to tell me I can't shout when what is
[2:00:35] revealed belongs to us but the Rapture
[2:00:38] friends will be a defining
[2:00:41] moment in the Eternal Mind Of God as he
[2:00:44] looks at time is divided into two
[2:00:47] categories before the Rapture and after
[2:00:51] the Rapture
[2:00:53] this message is the same message get
[2:00:55] ready for the Rapture let us not lose
[2:00:58] the focus friends of why God sent the
[2:01:02] prophet the purpose of the evening time
[2:01:05] message is to bring the bride into
[2:01:09] rapturing
[2:01:15] condition friends what good is it to be
[2:01:19] in the message for all these years and
[2:01:20] you are not in
[2:01:23] rapturing
[2:01:25] condition and brandom spoke about the
[2:01:27] different ages the horse and buggy age
[2:01:29] and the horse and the car Age and and
[2:01:31] the airplane and the and the age of the
[2:01:33] astronaut and if you have to go and fly
[2:01:35] in space you cannot just walk into a
[2:01:39] spaceship and just take off you need to
[2:01:41] be prepared for what you have to deal
[2:01:44] with when you get over
[2:01:47] there so to be an astronaut there's some
[2:01:50] training that you go through
[2:01:53] because gravity is different the air is
[2:01:57] different you have to behave differently
[2:01:59] because what you could do here you
[2:02:01] cannot do over
[2:02:05] there but before you could go there you
[2:02:08] have to be in the condition to go there
[2:02:11] so God has Us in training right now we
[2:02:14] are being pressurized right now to get
[2:02:18] into rapturing condition Lord and the
[2:02:22] reality is many people apply to go to
[2:02:25] space yes but only those who go through
[2:02:29] the

[2:03:30] issue what is your condition this

[2:03:40] the field one taken one left two in a
[2:03:45] bed one taken one
[2:03:48] left not two churches one taken

[2:03:54] individuals so I'm not talking to the
[2:03:57] person next to you right now I'm
[2:04:01] talking to you right
[2:04:04] now are you
[2:04:07] ready for the
[2:04:09] Rapture are you
[2:04:12] ready Malachi 4 brought a message to
[2:04:15] prepare us but for years we have fought
[2:04:18] about Doctrine and teaching and quote
[2:04:20] and are you
[2:04:23] ready that if God were to pull one this
[2:04:26] morning two in the field and he he takes
[2:04:29] one will you be the
[2:04:31] one two in a bed and he takes
[2:04:35] one will you be the
[2:04:37] one go back to the days of Moses he said
[2:04:41] take a lamb kill it put Blood on the
[2:04:44] door because the dead Angel is passing
[2:04:47] through the
[2:04:48] land and when I see the blood I'll pass
[2:04:52] over you not when I see what church you
[2:04:55] go to not when I see how many books you
[2:04:58] have read how many conventions you've
[2:05:01] been to not even how long you've prayed
[2:05:04] but when I see the
[2:05:06] blood that's the only thing that matters
[2:05:09] when I see the blood I'll pass over
[2:05:13] you and brother brandham said the token
[2:05:16] for this day is the life of Jesus
[2:05:20] Christ that's the token that's the blood
[2:05:24] when I see the blood I'll pass over
[2:05:27] you you may be
[2:05:30] seated that
[2:05:32] life that's the Thunder that shakes the
[2:05:35] devil Hallelujah that's what I want to
[2:05:38] see not another book another tape
[2:05:40] another no show me a life show me
[2:05:45] something H that I can
[2:05:50] believe when I see the
[2:05:53] blood I'll pass over
[2:05:56] you this message doesn't ask your
[2:05:59] position in the
[2:06:00] church it doesn't ask you what country
[2:06:03] you came from it doesn't ask you how
[2:06:06] long you've been in the message it
[2:06:09] doesn't ask you if you walked with the
[2:06:11] prophet it doesn't ask you how long
[2:06:13] you've been preaching it ask you have
[2:06:16] you applied Hallelujah the
[2:06:19] token not even for your church
[2:06:22] but have you applied it for your life
[2:06:26] Hallelujah friends there will be
[2:06:29] ministers who will not make it and
[2:06:32] people in their churches will make
[2:06:35] it because God is no respector of
[2:06:39] persons he only respects the Holy Ghost
[2:06:43] Hall he only respects the token he only
[2:06:47] respects the
[2:06:48] blood when I see the blood
[2:06:52] have passed over
[2:06:56] you friends this is real two in a bed
[2:07:01] one
[2:07:02] taken one left two in a field one taken
[2:07:08] one
[2:07:09] left are you ready Paul said examine
[2:07:14] yourselves Hallelujah my job is not to
[2:07:17] examine you your pastor is not to
[2:07:20] examine you but the Bible said examine
[2:07:23] yourselves but the brandom said it like
[2:07:26] this look into the mirror of the word
[2:07:28] hallelujah and stay there until you see
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:33] Jesus Lord I want to see Jesus in my
[2:07:41] life you may be seated friend this is
[2:07:45] real it's a
[2:07:47] burden your job is a distraction
[2:07:52] your family could be a distraction the
[2:07:55] news in the world is a distraction this
[2:07:59] is the only thing that matters right now
[2:08:03] because the angel of the Lord is here
[2:08:05] but the brandom said he's here fixing
[2:08:07] things around for the coming of the Lord
[2:08:09] and he he said put a mark upon those
[2:08:11] that sigh and
[2:08:13] cry for the abomination in the city for
[2:08:16] the abomination in the pulpits and he
[2:08:18] said begin at My Sanctuary at the
[2:08:22] ancient men at men who shouldn't know
[2:08:25] better because they've been around for a
[2:08:28] long time but death is about to
[2:08:31] strike from the east from the west from
[2:08:34] the north from the south this message is
[2:08:37] a message to prepare us to have a life
[2:08:40] before we leave here hallelujah Pharaoh
[2:08:43] has held this world long
[2:08:46] enough but the time has come for the
[2:08:48] children of Israel to come out of Egypt
[2:08:51] and the Death Angel is about to pass
[2:08:54] through the
[2:08:56] land but the brandham Cried Out brandham
[2:08:58] Tabernacle don't you fail apply the
[2:09:02] token
[2:09:04] Hallelujah brother brandham said don't
[2:09:06] just say I believe the message that's
[2:09:09] not good enough it's not good enough to
[2:09:11] believe because the Bible says the devil
[2:09:13] believes and he trembles it's more than
[2:09:17] believing what are you doing about the
[2:09:20] message what what are you doing about
[2:09:22] this message that's dripping with
[2:09:26] blood through Paul henus Martin Columba
[2:09:32] Luther
[2:09:34] Wesley and God's Prophet it wasn't easy
[2:09:38] to bring the message to
[2:09:40] us what are we
[2:09:43] doing with the message the musicians
[2:09:46] could
[2:09:48] come there should be a burning in your
[2:09:50] soul tonight
[2:09:52] there should be a burning in your soul
[2:09:53] every day Lord I want to be a Christian
[2:09:56] in my heart I want to be a real
[2:09:58] Christian I want an experience with the
[2:10:01] pillar of
[2:10:03] fire that I will never be the same again
[2:10:07] I want to meet God for myself like Moses
[2:10:10] at a burning
[2:10:13] bush I want to meet God for myself like
[2:10:16] Peter on the day of
[2:10:20] Pentecost
[2:10:26] the token must be
[2:10:29] displayed not showing the book but it
[2:10:32] must come from the inside and the token
[2:10:35] cannot be
[2:10:36] impersonated it cannot be explained the
[2:10:39] way it just lives itself out Faith
[2:10:42] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[2:10:46] godliness brotherly kindness
[2:10:50] charity the Life of
[2:10:52] Christ that's what this world needs is
[2:10:55] to see Jesus the musician can begin to
[2:10:58] play something
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:12] softly you could talk to him right
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:20] now
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:32] a little softer in the message Christ is
[2:11:35] the mystery of God
[2:11:38] revealed brother bam said
[2:11:41] Look only in an
[2:11:44] individual never in a
[2:11:47] group an individual not in a group his
[2:11:51] his
[2:11:53] identification is with an
[2:11:56] individual he said I'll take one and
[2:11:59] leave one I'll separate them that's
[2:12:03] right it's not a group these are the
[2:12:06] words of the Prophet friends he said
[2:12:08] it's a personal
[2:12:10] Vindication of a pregnated child of God
[2:12:14] filled with the Holy
[2:12:17] Ghost so surrendered to God
[2:12:21] that he don't care about anything
[2:12:24] else and the Holy Spirit living its life
[2:12:29] pulsating through him showing the
[2:12:32] personal Vindication of the
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:42] word with the brandom sing the
[2:12:45] token apply it
[2:12:47] Church don't
[2:12:50] fail
[2:12:52] and brother brandham is pleading he says
[2:12:54] it over and over he said don't don't
[2:12:57] don't let the
[2:13:00] sunset then he goes on don't don't don't
[2:13:04] don't rest day or night don't take no
[2:13:08] chance it won't work children it won't
[2:13:11] work you must have the
[2:13:13] token you say I believe yes I go I
[2:13:17] believe the message that's all right but
[2:13:20] that's not good
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:22] you must have the
[2:13:24] token do you hear brandom Tabernacle and
[2:13:27] I say this morning do you hear
[2:13:30] convention you must have the token
[2:13:34] displayed without it all your believing
[2:13:38] is in vain you live a good life you
[2:13:42] listen to what the word says you go to
[2:13:45] church you try to live right that's fine
[2:13:48] but that's not it when I see the
[2:13:51] blood that's the
[2:13:55] token don't just come this far I'm still
[2:13:59] reading from the prophet say I believe
[2:14:01] the message you obey the messenger come
[2:14:05] enter Christ you say well I believe
[2:14:07] every word said brother brandham he said
[2:14:09] that's
[2:14:10] good but that's just being able to read
[2:14:14] take the message take it into your heart
[2:14:18] that you must have the token the very
[2:14:21] life that was in Christ be in you when I
