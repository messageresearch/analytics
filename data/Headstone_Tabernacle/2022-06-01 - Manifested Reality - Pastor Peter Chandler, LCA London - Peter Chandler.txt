you go to william branham memorial library [Music] in you will see the exact preaching notes he preached on the glory of the lord and that's where we find manifested realities but uh the preaching notes are there is it true anybody ever wanted to see them i would love to see them myself that that a man can go into glory and leave his notes behind amen manifested reality is our title amen to follow in the the inspiration that we are are enjoying amen you can join me in the scriptures for today isaiah 60 verse 2. for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people my but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen his glory shall be seen manifested epistles of manifestation read of all man the glory shall be seen upon you i've put this uh i'm not sure i'll get there but uh matthew 17 16. i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him but these for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then i shall i know even as also two corinthians 3 18. but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord [Music] we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts almighty god thank you dear jesus that we are being changed from glory to glory oh lord not from politics to politics amen no not from problem to problem lord jesus i give you glory and praise for the things that you are going to do lord there's something fixing to happen lord it's later than we think lord may you visit us with unfailing reality dear god may you bless our

right now unless it be the name of the lord what can we say to these things it's gonna be [Music] amen you know how many has heard the the bible it says that the word is like a looking in a glass

bruised for my iniquities and the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i am healed and this is a continuation same message i don't know [Music] just where ooh could be london but i am told you jerusalem exactly exactly god's truth is a more sure word of prophecy the prophecy god knows that jesus christ the holy spirit is here now it is healing [Music] let's get our souls here

a bunch of fanaticism and telephoneticism that goes under the name of pentecost but that's not real pentecost [Music] did not respect their impersonation we can too no sinopoulosis you are not in reality the eye opened for israel for israel but there is a real a real holy spirit something sweet why would you accept a substitute for acceptance when the skies are full it's just so complete [Music] the holy spirit is free amen you keep holding on continue to nail bones and you keep pressing on you continue pushing lord is there anything hindering me i can't shoot him show me what it is hey man i want the holy ghost if you want it you're gonna get it [Music] into him only amen not just to speak in tongues although that's great and the prophecy is interpreted all these tremendous things that's now no no not azusa street nope into they know that glory there's one up all right but it's just a word well the prophet said that the prophet that jesus but bible says that what it is it's just a word we've got to break through the veins it's just a word to them but to us [Music] when the word becomes the reality in reality manifested reality reality manifest it's what i'm looking for and when we are thirsting for it we will get it let's do a reality check today lord give us more reality [Music] is in the reading of moses when moses is red is a veil that is still on their heart oh brother sister that's what the jews did the greatest reform when the veil was wrenched and brought god into plain views hanging on the crosses that was god that's it he was in plain view but they couldn't see it [Music] the south africans the americans the americans the british the england okay could it be possible at the gentiles he's done the same thing there's now a veil of what they've had the church ages of the son of god defeat the jew we're now meant to know the veil of well of this denomination and this veil of tradition that we've got to lose our vote since pentecost the people upon ghosts when the church traditions traditions it has been rendered okay and the things people said it is the days of miracles israel that's one shall be taken the other shall be left if you see it you shout decree amen you say it you thank god for it hallelujah amen you are in reality to them what it's just a word wait for these we can of crucifying christ you're crucifying the message because if you don't massage but if you see it thank god you see it no man can come we cannot accept our draw here what can we say to these things [Music] islam well yeah in a way well now that that was for that generation see they take the commandment of god you receive your portion you've got it right you may be the oddball potential you may be the peculiar people but you say i say amen this prophecy is more sure they to the library how many is catching what i'm saying no so don't wait for these guys yeah i heard the trumpet in a way but that could have been louis louis uh that could have been something else that is my freedom that is my emancipation hallelujah so if you want to stay well okay you can get something put in your ear and you can stay that way and see you can stay veiled me i'm going to the unveiling of almighty god hallelujah if you won't go listen papa don't hinder me i'm on my way to the glory land in my household we will praise the lord we will serve the lord shall be holy if you won't serve him he's still god if you want to praise him [Applause] [Music] what's what's it the seven seal book of the revelation of jesus christ of the seventh year they said so amen that's what's going on now no i meant and not even one tenth remember anthony can receive it so when god shows you just thank god i will praise the lord no matter what i will praise the lord just see it that way i'm saying god you've shown me lord that manifested you know what the scripture says several times seeing wha they say not i find that scary hearing they hear nothing now that that that is frightening no that's a paper because what can you call that i'll just get you back please i can read it to you he says he says because i speak in parables seeing they see nothing hearing they hear nothing you know don't burn neither understand watch why come on the veil is there but it doesn't mean i can't see people they can read like you can come you face to face amen ah amen one corinthians 13 and conscience god is love it keeps us you know zombies from seeing god watch you face to face [Music] you see me the soul is the spirit by our faith we know he's watching praise be to god this one it's not something that's michael we know he's watching but to this day they are veiled it's still over their hearts and they don't see it and they can't see in a buffer for this extreme joy excrement it says because it's in plain view blend view of those who believe have been on the same thing and they have crucified crucifix the seven seals they've crucified the messages on christopher the messiah they can't see extreme joy and things that the church has it shows that it's in plain view they don't blame people and you fail to see the why why people are so elated and these conventions for such an oddball ball it's just so strange you should see it wrong to other people it's because they see they broke through those barriers they broke through those whales into the presence of god where they see the manifested promise of this manifesto made manifest once you manifest they see what god promised to contribute hallelujah no wonder the bible said come and see come and see because there's people that just can't see the junkies thank god you can see it they've broken through that veil amen so let us let the mind that was in christ christian be in us lead not to your understanding but lean to god's understanding you can say amen to that islam the veil the violence is what keeps us it's kind of passion from living the viva the way women are you know the abc look on the ceiling you know the algebra do you know what you should be living jesus [Music] the veil is what keeps us from living the way we should the vivo don't know the way the fail the violence keeps us from doing things that we really want to do and god became flesh it's jesus veiled in that's the resurrection of the lord jesus christ blessed be the name of god that's the reality praise be to god you can't miss that praise be to god just by the way he says god is calling that's a picture of a hawk and an eagle universe that negative can you see the difference of course you can yes you can anybody impersonating you can see the difference god is calling for an an exodus an exhaust not from egypt but he's calling you to an accident to come from behind the flesh [Music] who tries to impersonate and to get real with god praise god because you love god let the redeemed say so i should tell you jesus love your brother because you love your brothers get real amen hallelujah get right and get real it's you and god that's why it's you amen it's not a church hannity negligence you have to go in 2013 not your group no patent not your church not only please not your pastor but it's you

you can go wherever you are you can walk anywhere put machinima when i grew up in in zimbabwe for for weeks i wouldn't wear shoes and but sometimes you have to trade careful okay you have to work carefully because of the reality because the reality of the ground uh-huh they can cut your foot you can on a thorn worse things pierce yours man and you when you take your shoes off your leftish will suit you you face reality reality hey man i meant if your shoes are on city should switch to them go where you want to go because there's no reality [Music] they can't deviate between the altar and the holy of holies and the sun they get stuck there it's on coincidence in there in your presence that's where i belong in your presence that's where i'm strong before that's the place the last one where the church ought to be there's too many of them [Music] they should who do you think you are obey your parents this is right get under that chicana that's where things change that's what you changed from glory to glory god to glory to glory get into that even as by the spirit legalism won't change never personally we accept that but the holy spirit [Music] in ripeness to ripeness to ripeness maturity maturity to maturity to maturity to mature who's the maturity amen from glory to glory to glory lay in the presence of god wake up in the morning start to pray what's that man say

behind the fish you have to be exposed i mean the shack it looks like the real a resemblance but it's not real this is in the [Music] where we can show others that that he is alive oh my man he says i think it is your point any man woman farmer boy girl [Music] another message with that light lumiere brings that word about it to a reality and we're in the process of the process we're in the process
