[52:51] morning I want to read from three
[52:54] portions of scripture reading from the
[52:57] book of Ephesians chapter
[53:02] 6 also we read from 1 Peter 2 and we
[53:07] read from Revelation
[53:09] 5 this
[53:13] morning Ephesians 6 and reading from
[53:16] verse 10 finally my brethren be strong
[53:20] in the Lord and in the power of His
[53:23] might put on the whole armor of God that
[53:26] ye may be able to stand against the Ws
[53:29] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[53:33] flesh and blood but against
[53:35] principalities that's one against Powers
[53:38] that's two against the rulers of the
[53:41] darkness of this world that's three
[53:44] against spiritual wickedness in high
[53:46] places that's
[53:47] four wherefore take unto you the whole
[53:50] armor of God that you may be able to
[53:53] withstand in the evil day and having
[53:55] done all
[53:57] to stand let's go to 1 Peter 2 and
[54:02] ver9 but ye are a chosen generation a
[54:06] royal priesthood and holy nation A
[54:10] peculiar people that he should show
[54:12] forth the Praises of him who had called
[54:14] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[54:17] Light which in time pass were not a
[54:20] people but are now the people of God
[54:22] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[54:26] have obtained mercy and our last
[54:28] scripture reading Revelation
[54:31] 5 reading uh from book verse
[54:36] 8 and when he had taken the book The
[54:39] Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell
[54:42] down before the lamb having every one of
[54:45] them Hops and golden vials of odors
[54:48] which are the prayers of saints and they
[54:51] sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[54:53] to take the book and to open the seals
[54:55] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[54:57] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[55:00] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[55:03] nation and has made us unto our God
[55:06] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[55:09] the earth may the Lord add a blessing to

[57:54] the Holy Ghost father it be completely
[57:57] filled from the crown of their heads to
[57:59] the SS of their feet father God if

[58:12] you get glory and honor to your holy
[58:15] name in The Mighty precious name of
[58:17] Jesus Christ and the church says and the
[58:20] church says can we give the Lord a shout
[58:22] of praise
[58:27] amen you may be seated this morning in
[58:30] the presence of the Lord well it's
[58:32] certainly good to be in the house of the
[58:34] Lord this morning certainly good to be
[58:36] able to lift our hands in worship
[58:38] certainly such a privilege to be able to
[58:40] say Lord you are good Lord you are
[58:43] worthy Lord You Are Holy Lord there's
[58:45] none like you from the rising of the Sun
[58:48] to the going down of the same your name
[58:50] is exalted because wherever God is
[58:52] there's a sound of holy holy holy are
[58:55] you Lord Hol holy holy is the Lord God
[58:57] Almighty who art and is and is to come
[59:00] blessed be the Lord God Almighty it's
[59:02] impossible for God to be present and
[59:05] there's not a rising up of Praises so
[59:08] that the glory of God can move in our
[59:10] midst
[59:12] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[59:15] Lord how many appreciate the
[59:17] convention how many appreciate God's
[59:19] servants who came and Minister all the
[59:22] greetings and the singings and the
[59:23] worship and we know it our shadow of a
[59:26] doubt we are closer to leaving this
[59:28] place we are closer to walking on the
[59:30] neck of the devil the devil is shaken
[59:33] because the moment you realize who you
[59:35] are it's finished oh Hallelujah I'm so
[59:39] excited to know that we are coming into
[59:42] the fullness of realization there's
[59:45] partial realization and there's a
[59:46] fullness of realization when you look
[59:48] into the mirror of the word and you see
[59:51] Jesus looking back to you you may be
[59:54] seated so certainly once once again on
[59:56] behalf of the office of the pastor we
[59:58] want to really salute the church for
[1:00:00] your labor your sacrifice your efforts
[1:00:03] financially physically your presence
[1:00:05] your support for all of and and we know
[1:00:08] that your reward is going to be tied to
[1:00:11] this effort to this sacrifice God
[1:00:13] rewards a sacrifice he sees
[1:00:15] everything your prayers there was a
[1:00:18] memorial in heaven for Cornelius prayers
[1:00:20] your prayers are being recorded God is
[1:00:22] recording every action he's recording
[1:00:24] every time you lift your hands he's
[1:00:25] recording every every time you say God
[1:00:26] bless you he's recording every time you
[1:00:28] come to church he's recording how you go
[1:00:30] on your job he's recording how you speak
[1:00:32] to your wife he's recording how you
[1:00:33] speak to your husband he's recording how
[1:00:35] you speak to your children he's
[1:00:36] recording how you press past your
[1:00:38] limitations he's recording when you
[1:00:39] shake yourself and say I know I'm tired
[1:00:42] but there's something more than this
[1:00:43] physical being that needs food and he
[1:00:45] takes a note that you came to church
[1:00:47] this morning when you had an option to
[1:00:49] stay home something pull you he took
[1:00:51] note of that oh come on now somebody
[1:00:53] speak back to me this morning Hallelujah
[1:00:57] Glory Hallelujah
[1:00:59] Hallelujah so I'm an expectation for God
[1:01:02] to speak to someone's heart and know he
[1:01:04] will he promised to do
[1:01:06] it and to see how time is unfolding and
[1:01:09] I don't know how many of you have seen
[1:01:10] it but in the Olympics just opened the
[1:01:13] French
[1:01:15] Olympics and it's been over the news
[1:01:17] it's been over the media different
[1:01:20] companies have pulled their sponsorship
[1:01:22] from the French Olympics based on the
[1:01:24] opening ceremony you know and I was
[1:01:26] sharing with my wife if you take a
[1:01:28] picture of a worldly concert whatever
[1:01:31] kind of concert it is if you just take a
[1:01:33] picture from a distance what you will
[1:01:35] see is people hands
[1:01:37] raised and there's somebody on the stage
[1:01:40] and if you take the picture of a church
[1:01:41] convention you will see people's hands
[1:01:43] raised and you will see someone on the
[1:01:45] stage unless you know which one is which
[1:01:47] from a distance it looks the same
[1:01:49] because it has always been about
[1:01:53] worship the fall and Satan leaving
[1:01:56] heaven to create the situation was
[1:01:58] always about
[1:02:00] worship he wanted the worship that God
[1:02:02] had and that has been now reflected till
[1:02:05] over the French opening of the Olympic
[1:02:07] the symbolism and the imagery and the
[1:02:10] way it was done a a display or a counter
[1:02:13] display of the Lord's supper and there's
[1:02:16] a calf and there's a horse and all the
[1:02:18] symbol is almost like if you reading the
[1:02:20] book of Revelation and some spiritual
[1:02:21] being is there orchestrating
[1:02:26] because we are being influenced by the
[1:02:27] spirit world and it's so blatant that
[1:02:30] the media is saying and most of the news
[1:02:32] you go go look at it most of the news
[1:02:34] media saying the how could they insult
[1:02:36] over two billion
[1:02:39] Christians and the reality is there are
[1:02:41] those who saying they're not going to
[1:02:42] watch one more Olympic sport but that's
[1:02:44] not true people are still going to go
[1:02:47] watch it because they are slowly
[1:02:49] training the people for the spiritual
[1:02:52] realm this is their convention you know
[1:02:55] and with the eyeballs on the Olympics
[1:02:57] they took an opportunity to drop seeds
[1:02:59] into the hearts of the people and that's
[1:03:01] what the devil has been doing through
[1:03:03] movies through songs through all of
[1:03:05] their movements and the lgbtq and all
[1:03:07] these things has meant to almost
[1:03:09] normalize what brother brandham saw when
[1:03:12] he went down to Hell to see what is
[1:03:13] going to normalize
[1:03:15] it so we don't want to be ignorant of
[1:03:17] Satan devices and we have to realize
[1:03:20] that we are in a Warfare and there's a
[1:03:22] spiritual war that's going on that that
[1:03:24] we were born into this war we didn't
[1:03:26] just sign up for it we were born into
[1:03:28] the war the war started before we were
[1:03:30] here the war started in heaven but we
[1:03:34] were caught up in the thoughts of God
[1:03:35] and God in his thoughts he had you in
[1:03:37] his thinking he had a me in his thinking
[1:03:39] and he choose his best soldiers for this
[1:03:42] day his best weapons he left for this
[1:03:45] day Sons and Daughters of God who will
[1:03:47] come to a full manifestation because the
[1:03:49] word will grow into them and the spirit
[1:03:51] will power that word can the church say
[1:03:53] Amen oh I feel good this
[1:03:56] morning so just for a bit of a thought
[1:03:59] has been on my heart for some time and I
[1:04:01] was sharing with B over briefly before
[1:04:03] the service that we have been touching
[1:04:05] this in different ways but I preach a
[1:04:06] few messages touching this I've touched
[1:04:08] some parts of it as well but I want to
[1:04:10] speak this morning on my titled the war
[1:04:12] of altars sacrifices and
[1:04:16] Priests a war or the war of altars so
[1:04:19] there's a war of altars there's a war of
[1:04:23] sacrifices and there's a war between
[1:04:26] priests and if you read through the
[1:04:28] entire scripture the entire Bible from
[1:04:31] Genesis to Revelation is about this
[1:04:33] spiritual war a war between altars a war
[1:04:37] between sacrifices and a war of priests
[1:04:40] and you have heard it before because I
[1:04:41] read the scripture you are a royal
[1:04:43] priest you are part of a royal
[1:04:45] priesthood so every single person in
[1:04:47] this room is a
[1:04:48] priest but I have news for you every
[1:04:51] single person on the earth is a
[1:04:53] priest because but abam t as anything
[1:04:56] could be your
[1:04:57] God because God is the object of worship
[1:05:00] and every God has
[1:05:02] priest every God has altars and every
[1:05:05] God has sacrifices so you hear singers
[1:05:08] and musicians they sell their soul to
[1:05:10] the devil people talk about to be able
[1:05:11] to get popular or so they make a deal
[1:05:14] with the devil they give up their soul
[1:05:15] they sacrifice their soul for popularity
[1:05:18] for
[1:05:18] money that's a sacrifice they make at
[1:05:21] the altar of their
[1:05:22] God can the church say Amen no wonder
[1:05:25] God told Moses thou shal have no other
[1:05:28] gods before me because God was teaching
[1:05:31] them from way back then there are
[1:05:32] multiple gods out there gods of your
[1:05:35] imagination different Idols that people
[1:05:37] have different ceremonies that people do
[1:05:39] different things that people do and we
[1:05:41] in the in the realm of the spirit ought
[1:05:43] to understand that this is not a flesh
[1:05:45] and blood
[1:05:47] thing Hall I read the scripture for a
[1:05:49] purpose for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:05:53] and blood but against principalities
[1:05:56] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:05:58] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:06:00] wickedness in high places the battle is
[1:06:03] not you and your boss it's not you and
[1:06:05] the government it's not you and your
[1:06:06] brother it's not you and your sister
[1:06:08] it's you against principalities you
[1:06:10] against Powers you against yes you
[1:06:13] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:06:16] this world and against spiritual
[1:06:18] wickedness in high
[1:06:20] places four things we are fighting
[1:06:22] against this morning we are fighting
[1:06:24] against principalities
[1:06:26] we are fighting against Powers we are
[1:06:28] fighting against the rulers of tactic of
[1:06:30] this world and against spiritual
[1:06:31] wickedness in high places when you see
[1:06:34] that we are more influenced by the
[1:06:36] hidden realm than the natural realm you
[1:06:38] begin to readjust your position and
[1:06:40] realize how much of a prayer life you're
[1:06:42] supposed to have and how much you should
[1:06:44] cherish the worship you bring to the
[1:06:47] house of God oh you don't hear me this
[1:06:50] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah because
[1:06:54] any wor ship that doesn't go to the real
[1:06:58] God the true God goes to some other God
[1:07:01] somebody preach back to me but Bram said
[1:07:03] you can make your car your God you can
[1:07:05] make a job your God you can make money
[1:07:07] your God you can make music your God you
[1:07:09] can make an idol or
[1:07:13] God but our God is a jealous God he
[1:07:16] wants all your worship he wants all of
[1:07:18] your sacrifices he want a clean heart he
[1:07:21] want a clean altar he want a clean
[1:07:23] sacrifice he deserves a praise he
[1:07:26] deserves the glory he deserves the
[1:07:30] honor oh Hallelujah and I want to tell
[1:07:33] you church that as a priest there's a
[1:07:35] war against your priesthood somebody
[1:07:38] preach back to me your priesthood is
[1:07:40] being challenged every day you're being
[1:07:42] challenged what kind of priest are you
[1:07:45] oh come on now I'm going to teach a
[1:07:47] little bit you may be seated
[1:07:49] Hallelujah there's a qualitative measure
[1:07:53] that God places on these things when God
[1:07:55] found David he say he found a better
[1:07:58] man it was qualitative he said by faith
[1:08:02] abrel offered to God a
[1:08:04] more excellent sacrifice so your
[1:08:07] sacrifice could be okay or your
[1:08:09] sacrifice could be more excellent you
[1:08:10] don't hear me this morning brother Bram
[1:08:13] said God Don't Make halfway Christians
[1:08:15] but a Christian could be halfway God
[1:08:17] Don't Make halfway priests but a priest
[1:08:20] could be halfway there's a measure of
[1:08:22] your priesthood oh you don't hear me
[1:08:24] this morning there's a measure of your
[1:08:27] sacrifice is it a more excellent
[1:08:29] sacrifice is it a are you a real
[1:08:34] priest oh let me ask the question
[1:08:36] another way who are you a priest
[1:08:41] for because all through the Old
[1:08:43] Testament priests who were once
[1:08:47] serving at the altar of incense found
[1:08:50] themselves serving in the altar of BM
[1:08:56] read through the Old Testament over and
[1:08:59] over and that spiritual wickedness in
[1:09:02] high places we read in Ephesians go
[1:09:04] search high places in the Bible the high
[1:09:08] places were
[1:09:10] altars Solomon built the temple but the
[1:09:13] Bible said he still went to the high
[1:09:15] places Esau still went to the high
[1:09:17] places all through the scripture and
[1:09:20] they did not break down the high places
[1:09:27] God had taught them their all back to
[1:09:28] Abraham to raise to build the altars
[1:09:31] take it on Higher
[1:09:33] Ground Hallelujah don't cut it with
[1:09:35] tools because it will defile it just use
[1:09:39] rocks read the Bible is there there's an
[1:09:42] approach to God this thing goes all the
[1:09:44] way back to Genesis what kind of priest
[1:09:46] are you that's why there's a war this
[1:09:49] morning war of altars altar against
[1:09:53] altar sacrif ice against sacrifice
[1:09:57] priest against
[1:10:01] priest anybody with me this morning
[1:10:03] we're not playing church this
[1:10:06] morning if the brothers help me let's
[1:10:08] pull up Daniel chapter
[1:10:11] 10 to show how real this thing
[1:10:16] is going to teach a little bit a little
[1:10:18] Sunday school a little encouragement
[1:10:20] Daniel chapter 10 we going take it from
[1:10:23] verse one
[1:10:39] in the third year of Cyrus King of
[1:10:42] Persia and we can keep the scriptures up
[1:10:44] on the screen a thing was revealed unto
[1:10:47] Daniel whose name was called belesa and
[1:10:49] the thing was true so Daniel hears
[1:10:52] something is revealed to him his
[1:10:55] Revelation is something that persuades
[1:10:57] him let's
[1:10:58] go but the time appointed was long and
[1:11:02] he understood the thing and had
[1:11:05] understanding of the vision in those
[1:11:08] days I Daniel was mourning three full
[1:11:10] weeks in other words the Revelation
[1:11:12] created a desperation a burden and an
[1:11:15] urgency that sent him into fasting
[1:11:18] fasting is a
[1:11:21] sacrifice so the Revelation drove Daniel
[1:11:24] to an altar in his home oh you don't
[1:11:27] hear me this
[1:11:29] morning do you have an altar in your
[1:11:31] home do you have a consecrated place in
[1:11:35] your home where you talk to
[1:11:38] God can I drive home a little
[1:11:41] bit how many of you have been to a store
[1:11:43] or a business where there are images of
[1:11:45] different
[1:11:48] deities and what you may not know is
[1:11:50] that people in these business come early
[1:11:51] in the morning and they put some food in
[1:11:53] front of
[1:11:55] because they understand Altar and they
[1:11:58] understand sacrifice and they understand
[1:12:00] and I want you to understand this
[1:12:01] friends God gave Dominion to this earth
[1:12:03] to man it's in the word and for God to
[1:12:07] move somebody has to call him he said I
[1:12:10] stand at the door and knock and if any
[1:12:11] man open I can't open unless somebody
[1:12:14] open for me to open oh you don't hear me
[1:12:16] this morning when God came down to
[1:12:18] deliver he said I've heard the cries of
[1:12:20] my
[1:12:23] people and that called me into action so
[1:12:27] until the cry had risen up God couldn't
[1:12:29] even
[1:12:30] move for you to reach God there has to
[1:12:33] be a way for you to talk to
[1:12:36] God and God put a mechanism in place to
[1:12:40] be able to reach him it's called an
[1:12:43] altar for John the Baptist to be born
[1:12:45] the Bible said his father was there at
[1:12:47] the altar bur incense when the angel
[1:12:49] came at the right side of the
[1:12:52] altar do you have an altar
[1:12:55] do you have a secret place a secret
[1:12:58] closet a secret room a place that's
[1:13:00] consecrated I was sharing brother over
[1:13:01] it this brought a sensitivity to me of
[1:13:04] even how we read Bible and thing now we
[1:13:06] know because we use our phones for
[1:13:08] WhatsApp and Facebook and all these
[1:13:09] things and then if this is your main
[1:13:11] means of Team
[1:13:13] wood is that the best mechanism for you
[1:13:16] to anybody with
[1:13:19] me it brings a sacredness of altar a
[1:13:22] sacredness of consecration do you still
[1:13:24] have have a
[1:13:26] Bible or is your only time I'm not
[1:13:29] seeing that there's anything wrong with
[1:13:30] reading the Bible on your phone or no
[1:13:32] but your phone is
[1:13:38] corrupt because priests had to dress a
[1:13:41] certain way cleanse themselves a certain
[1:13:43] way they couldn't just walk into the
[1:13:45] presence just like that they had to they
[1:13:47] had to be a cleansing
[1:13:49] process anybody with me a war of altars
[1:13:54] a war of sacrifices and a war of priests
[1:13:57] so in those days I just want to show you
[1:13:59] about the war right Danel was mourning
[1:14:01] three full weeks let's go I ate no
[1:14:04] Pleasant bread neither came flesh nor
[1:14:07] wine in my mouth neither did I anoint
[1:14:08] myself at all till three whole weeks
[1:14:10] were fulfilled this was a great burden
[1:14:13] it was a great sacrifice Daniel is there
[1:14:15] in prayer and in the 4 and 20th day of
[1:14:18] the first month as I was by the side of
[1:14:20] the Great River which is heel then I
[1:14:23] lifted up my eyes and looked and behold
[1:14:25] a certain man clothed in linen whose
[1:14:27] loins were GED with fine gold of hopas
[1:14:31] his body also was like the barrel and
[1:14:33] his face as the appearance of lightning
[1:14:35] is an angel
[1:14:37] there and his eyes as lamps of fire and
[1:14:40] his arms and his feet like in the color
[1:14:42] to polish brass and the voice of his
[1:14:44] words like the voice of a multitude and
[1:14:46] I Daniel alone saw the vision so he's
[1:14:50] there with other people but only he
[1:14:51] could see it because he's in a different
[1:14:54] Realm he's in a different Channel his
[1:14:56] altar is right his sacrifice was
[1:14:59] recognized his voice has been heard and
[1:15:01] God is allowing him to see what the
[1:15:03] person next to him cannot see you don't
[1:15:05] hear me this morning you could be in
[1:15:07] here this morning and see what nobody
[1:15:10] else could see oh somebody help me
[1:15:12] preach this
[1:15:14] morning and I Daniel alone saw the
[1:15:17] vision for the men that were with me saw
[1:15:20] not the vision they're right next to him
[1:15:22] but they can't see it but a great quake
[1:15:25] King fell upon them so that they fled to
[1:15:27] hide
[1:15:28] themselves the presence of the god the
[1:15:31] presence of the Angel The Presence had
[1:15:33] those men running for cover therefore I
[1:15:35] was left alone and saw this great vision
[1:15:38] and there remained no strength in me for
[1:15:40] my cess was turning me into corruption
[1:15:43] and I retain no strength in other words
[1:15:45] the presence of that angel from the Lord
[1:15:47] took all his strength away he was not in
[1:15:50] his human strength anymore his human he
[1:15:52] just felt weak in the presence of the
[1:15:54] Lord
[1:15:57] amen yet heard I the voice of his words
[1:15:59] and when I heard the voice of his words
[1:16:02] then was I in a deep sleep on my face
[1:16:05] and my face toward the ground and behold
[1:16:06] a hand touched me which set me upon my
[1:16:09] knees and upon the palms of my hands and
[1:16:11] he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly
[1:16:15] beloved understand the words that I
[1:16:17] speak unto thee and stand upright For
[1:16:19] unto thee am I now sent and when he had
[1:16:22] spoken this word unto me I stood true
[1:16:25] trembling that's a problem today people
[1:16:27] don't know the presence of the Lord
[1:16:29] people don't know the awesomeness of it
[1:16:31] the sacredness of it the fear that comes
[1:16:33] with it amen and this is what I want to
[1:16:37] get to then said he unto me fear not
[1:16:40] Daniel for from the first day that thou
[1:16:43] did set thine heart to understand and to
[1:16:47] chasten thyself or sacrifice thyself
[1:16:50] before thy God thy words were heard amen
[1:16:54] and I I'm come for thy words in other
[1:16:56] words the only reason I'm here is
[1:16:58] because you're
[1:17:01] called anybody with me this morning but
[1:17:04] I want you to get to this because we
[1:17:05] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:17:07] principalities and Powers against rulers
[1:17:10] of Darkness against spiritual wickedness
[1:17:12] in high places but young people I want
[1:17:14] you to catch this this is an angel from
[1:17:16] the presence of the Lord that responded
[1:17:18] to Daniel beginning to pray and fast and
[1:17:20] call upon the Lord but the angel is
[1:17:22] saying but the prince of the kingdom of
[1:17:24] Persia
[1:17:26] yes with stod me one and 12 days in
[1:17:31] other words for 21 days this angel
[1:17:34] trying to get to Daniel and a
[1:17:36] principality is fighting with
[1:17:44] him and Daniel had to keep praying and
[1:17:46] his praying kept pulling the Angel and
[1:17:49] the angel the angel had to fight
[1:17:51] principalities so I want you to
[1:17:52] understand when you pray for God to help
[1:17:54] you and God dispatch an angel to help
[1:17:56] you that angel have many times to go
[1:17:58] through
[1:17:59] principalities to get to you and when
[1:18:02] you stop praying the Angels stop
[1:18:04] fighting but when you keep on
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:10] praying I want you to see it's not no
[1:18:12] game thing you
[1:18:15] know but L the angel is saying this now
[1:18:17] imagine Daniel a man on the earth
[1:18:19] hearing an angel say I was trying to get
[1:18:21] to you you know but on my way to get to
[1:18:23] you the prince of Persia come in front
[1:18:26] of me and start to fight me and I was
[1:18:28] caught there not for one day not for two
[1:18:30] days not for three days so when you
[1:18:32] think nothing happening you don't even
[1:18:33] know in the spirit realm there's a war
[1:18:36] taking place to bring Deliverance to
[1:18:38] your
[1:18:42] house and brother the Clarence that
[1:18:44] angel said but L
[1:18:49] Michael one of the chief
[1:18:51] princes Hallelujah came to help me
[1:18:55] so even angels have
[1:18:57] reinforcement you have
[1:18:59] reinforcement we need reinforcement what
[1:19:02] I want you to understand and this is why
[1:19:04] we come to church there are some battles
[1:19:07] you cannot fight alone one will put a
[1:19:09] thousand to flight two will put 10,000
[1:19:11] to flight we need one another that's why
[1:19:14] the Bible say if two shall agree
[1:19:16] touching
[1:19:20] anything people think they could just
[1:19:21] stay home and stand alone stand alone no
[1:19:24] if two shall agree who is agreeing with
[1:19:26] you over your situation who's agreeing
[1:19:28] with you over your problem where is your
[1:19:30] reinforcement here's an angel from the
[1:19:33] presence of God caught in battle for 21
[1:19:35] days and low if it had not been for
[1:19:38] Michael one of the chief princes who
[1:19:41] came to help
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:45] me friends there's a war going on
[1:19:48] between you and I and principalities
[1:19:51] there's a war going on between you and I
[1:19:53] and Powers
[1:19:55] rulers of tness of this world against
[1:19:57] spiritual wickedness in high
[1:20:01] places you know just com to
[1:20:05] church fight fight for your family fight
[1:20:10] for your home fight for your prayer life
[1:20:13] fight for the Holy Ghost fight for your
[1:20:15] deliverance Hallelujah don't stop
[1:20:18] calling upon Him name don't stop calling
[1:20:20] him he is fighting for you
[1:20:25] can the church say
[1:20:28] amen hallelujah it's a real war but we
[1:20:32] have the victory we already have the
[1:20:34] victory Hallelujah Glory Glory
[1:20:38] Glory oh
[1:20:39] hallelujah
[1:20:41] hallelujah
[1:20:43] hallelujah
[1:20:46] hallelujah can we go so God we we're
[1:20:50] going to leave that scripture now
[1:20:51] Brothers thank you God is the object of
[1:20:53] worship
[1:20:55] worship is what led to Lucifer's
[1:20:57] Uprising he wanted worship he still
[1:21:00] wants worship he wants worship on your
[1:21:02] job he wants Worship in your school he
[1:21:05] wants worship from your money how you
[1:21:07] spend your money is a form of worship
[1:21:10] how you spend your time is a form of
[1:21:11] worship because that's the currency of
[1:21:13] this world it's material and it's time
[1:21:15] that's the only two currencies we have
[1:21:17] so in the old days it was the lamb and
[1:21:18] the Bullock It's money and all these
[1:21:20] things how you spend your money is an
[1:21:22] expression of your worship how you spend
[1:21:24] your time is an expression of your
[1:21:28] worship who gets the most of your time
[1:21:30] is your
[1:21:32] god who gets the most of your resources
[1:21:34] is your God because it's an expression
[1:21:36] of your worship it sounds hard but it's
[1:21:38] the truth because God is the only God
[1:21:40] that deserves your worship he's the only
[1:21:42] God that deserves your
[1:21:43] [Applause]
[1:21:45] time God first family second you after
[1:21:48] that put God first make him the object
[1:21:52] of your worship make him the object je
[1:21:54] of your praise God must be
[1:21:58] first Hallelujah you are royal priest
[1:22:02] servant the Living God your work must be
[1:22:05] holy your words must be holy your life
[1:22:09] must be holy because you are
[1:22:12] [Applause]
[1:22:14] priests can the church say amen
[1:22:17] hallelujah no time for backbiting no
[1:22:20] time for gossip no time for argument no
[1:22:23] time for political debate that's not
[1:22:25] what priests have time to do we have
[1:22:27] time to lift him up we have time to
[1:22:29] bring sacrifices we bring a sacrifice of
[1:22:32] praise into the house of the Lord we
[1:22:35] ourselves have to be oh come on now you
[1:22:37] may be seated for a
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:42] minute the pattern we have to reflect is
[1:22:45] the pattern that God gave us in know he
[1:22:47] was always our high priest and our high
[1:22:50] priest became his own
[1:22:52] sacrifice and we are royal priest we are
[1:22:55] supposed to become spiritual sacrifices
[1:22:57] offering spiritual
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:02] sacrifices and Bram said the altar of
[1:23:05] God where is it
[1:23:07] now so you supposed to be a priest
[1:23:10] you're supposed to be a sacrifice and
[1:23:11] you're supposed to be a
[1:23:14] altar wrapped up in this 16 elements God
[1:23:18] Is Watching because listen oh come on
[1:23:20] somebody help me this morning the
[1:23:22] children of Israel at one point
[1:23:25] you know they were in the wilderness and
[1:23:26] all these things and they had to keep
[1:23:27] moving so the T the the Tabernacle had
[1:23:29] to move and all these things and the Ark
[1:23:31] of the Covenant effectively was a mobile
[1:23:33] a mobile altar when the ark moved before
[1:23:38] them this was the only Army that had
[1:23:40] singers and Ark before soldiers because
[1:23:43] there was power in the
[1:23:44] altar there was power in the altar there
[1:23:47] was power in the Covenant Hallelujah but
[1:23:49] the cents the singers and the Ark had to
[1:23:52] go first when they had to cross on on
[1:23:54] the the the the into Jericho into the
[1:23:57] Jordan he said let the AR go first when
[1:23:59] they go to battle I read it one time he
[1:24:01] said let the singer sing and when he
[1:24:02] sing and sing the Lord s a great
[1:24:05] noise because worship and the act
[1:24:07] together is a powerful
[1:24:09] combination you don't hear me this
[1:24:12] morning so God always had in his mind
[1:24:17] this thing about priesthood this thing
[1:24:19] about Ark and this thing about sacrifice
[1:24:21] so all through the Old Testament they
[1:24:23] had a point where they were moving when
[1:24:24] we be moving do you remember one time
[1:24:26] the Philistines took the
[1:24:28] ark and they took the Ark of the cember
[1:24:31] of George into where Deon their God
[1:24:33] was and and they G fall down because you
[1:24:36] can't put a Ark that is dedicated to the
[1:24:39] most high God next to a false idol that
[1:24:43] have no power these things cannot
[1:24:46] coexist that was a war of
[1:24:48] altars you don't hear me this morning
[1:24:52] and listen these guys didn't understand
[1:24:54] understand what was going on Sister
[1:24:55] Crystal because they live back up Deon
[1:24:57] again and the next day what happen they
[1:24:59] find Deon D with he head off he hand off
[1:25:02] and listen it wasn't no man did that the
[1:25:05] angels of the Covenant the Angels who
[1:25:08] understand the celestial realm the
[1:25:10] Earthly Dimension and the power of the
[1:25:12] altar that represented God's
[1:25:16] instructions thou shallal have no other
[1:25:18] gods before
[1:25:22] me Hall no wonder but the Clarence when
[1:25:26] David hear the a coming back David start
[1:25:28] to dance David start to get on he said
[1:25:31] the altar coming his wife said David
[1:25:34] you're a minister he said I want to hear
[1:25:35] about that he said oh come on somebody
[1:25:37] preach back to me he said you see
[1:25:39] nothing
[1:25:41] yet
[1:25:42] woo yes see nothing yet
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:55] hallah I'm just going to encourage you
[1:25:58] friends because you and I we are called
[1:26:01] to a priesthood we are called to
[1:26:04] maintain our altars and we are called to
[1:26:06] present holy sacrifice and the Bible
[1:26:09] said acceptable to
[1:26:11] God because you could say well Lord I
[1:26:13] sacrificing I doing this I bringing my
[1:26:15] offering I'm bringing my tithe I coming
[1:26:16] to show I God say I don't accept
[1:26:19] it so is your offering
[1:26:22] acceptable and I said brother over time
[1:26:24] accept it it's a me to accept it it's if
[1:26:26] God accept
[1:26:29] it so it's a qualitative teaching this
[1:26:32] morning was the quality of your
[1:26:34] priesthood was the quality of your altar
[1:26:37] was the quality of your sacrifice
[1:26:40] because God Demands a perfect sacrifice
[1:26:42] he Demands a perfect priesthood he
[1:26:44] Demands a Sanctified altar can the
[1:26:46] church say Amen this
[1:26:51] morning when man fell
[1:26:54] Adam did his best based on his
[1:26:58] understanding because he knew he was
[1:27:00] naked and he covered himself with fig
[1:27:05] leaves the lamb was slain before the
[1:27:08] foundation of the
[1:27:10] world so the high priest came down and
[1:27:15] but brandom said he slay a
[1:27:18] lamb and give them lamb
[1:27:22] skin so he operated now as a priest on
[1:27:25] the earth and in type show them what the
[1:27:29] priesthood should look like that blood
[1:27:31] was a requirement and these things so
[1:27:33] Adam could now walk now with a covering
[1:27:35] that God gave
[1:27:36] him can the church say Amen as you go
[1:27:39] further in Genesis we see two boys
[1:27:41] growing up Cain and Abel nobody could
[1:27:43] tell the difference between
[1:27:46] them just as if many times in church
[1:27:48] nobody a difference between you and your
[1:27:49] brother next to you until The Showdown
[1:27:52] came
[1:27:54] because anytime you talk about Altar and
[1:27:57] sacrifice you are actually activating a
[1:27:59] measure of
[1:28:02] priesthood so Cain and Abel two priests
[1:28:05] if I can use that analogy because they
[1:28:07] both about to build altars they're both
[1:28:09] about to build sacrifices two priests
[1:28:12] two altars two sacrifices amen the war
[1:28:15] of altars the war of sacrifices the war
[1:28:18] of
[1:28:19] priests
[1:28:22] that's while they was setting it upward
[1:28:24] urance nobody could tell who is who you
[1:28:27] know everybody working by their own
[1:28:31] Revelation if you look at the fact that
[1:28:33] they com in and worshiping they both get
[1:28:35] the check mark they're there to worship
[1:28:37] if you give them the check mark on do
[1:28:38] they have altars check mark If you give
[1:28:41] them do they have sacrifices check
[1:28:43] mark But the quality and the nature of
[1:28:46] the sacrifice was the difference Cain
[1:28:48] brought his fruits he brought his
[1:28:51] understanding he brought what he thought
[1:28:52] God would want he brought what he
[1:28:54] thought he could have done but Abel
[1:28:56] brought a lamb and when he cut that
[1:28:57] thing that thing that blood just spoke
[1:29:01] spoke for him and that is where the
[1:29:03] separation took place right
[1:29:05] there God accepted Abel's sacrifice and
[1:29:08] rejected Cain
[1:29:11] sacrifice but the day touching it but
[1:29:13] the children of Israel against Moab it
[1:29:15] was seven altars they all had the
[1:29:17] Bullocks on it they all had and God in
[1:29:20] Form and Function Moab is looking like
[1:29:22] Israel know but God didn't accept it he
[1:29:26] only accepted Israel sacrifice friends
[1:29:29] this is a challenge to
[1:29:31] us where's our where what what are our
[1:29:35] altars some of us TV is our altar you
[1:29:39] know and we sacrific all our time in
[1:29:42] front of this
[1:29:45] altar we have become
[1:29:48] priests for the Demonic forces from
[1:29:50] Hollywood who getting their script and
[1:29:53] their copy be straight from the pit of
[1:29:55] Hell and our time and our reflection
[1:29:58] really tells us because ultimately only
[1:30:02] when Cain presented what was in him
[1:30:04] showed what he
[1:30:06] was and I'm saying this morning every
[1:30:08] single person walking the Earth is a
[1:30:10] priest for some
[1:30:17] God whose priest are you which God are
[1:30:20] you serving what altar have you built
[1:30:22] what sacrifice have you place on the
[1:30:26] Altar and that's a challenge for us
[1:30:29] friends can the church say
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:49] amen I want to reinforce the point that
[1:30:52] for God to intervene
[1:30:54] in your situation he has to be welcomed
[1:30:59] in and I want to say also remember when
[1:31:02] Jesus went for the across the other side
[1:31:05] with
[1:31:06] Legion and then the spirit say have you
[1:31:08] come to torment us before our time
[1:31:11] because the spirits knew that they had a
[1:31:13] time of Torment coming and because they
[1:31:15] in the spirit realm I want you to
[1:31:16] understand the spirit realm cannot move
[1:31:18] without a
[1:31:20] body so he said so the spirit said don't
[1:31:22] send us back again know send us into the
[1:31:24] pigs because we need a body to operate
[1:31:26] on this realm Spirits are just moving
[1:31:28] around in the air you know they Spirits
[1:31:32] have to move into
[1:31:33] people that's why God is looking for
[1:31:36] vessels that are sold out that are
[1:31:37] emptied out so he could step in and take
[1:31:39] control the same way God is going to
[1:31:41] fill somebody with the Holy Ghost is the
[1:31:43] same way the devil looking to fill
[1:31:44] people with with what he has as
[1:31:47] well and I want to push a little deeper
[1:31:49] I was sharing this with my wife
[1:31:51] yesterday I said people say this is
[1:31:53] affecting them in their home and this
[1:31:54] thing is in the home and I'm saying the
[1:31:55] only way a Spirit come into your home
[1:31:57] because you have an
[1:31:58] altar that allows that Spirit to come in
[1:32:02] I'll say that
[1:32:04] again when the children of Israel went
[1:32:07] into Jericho he told them do not take
[1:32:09] the accursed thing don't touch the
[1:32:12] accursed thing because when you take
[1:32:14] things from that Physical Realm that are
[1:32:17] tight to Spirits into your house you are
[1:32:19] bringing a channel into your home
[1:32:24] that's why the old people say burn
[1:32:26] certain
[1:32:29] things because you're opening doorways
[1:32:31] you're opening altars you're opening
[1:32:33] channels into your home into your life
[1:32:35] that's why you dedicate your home and
[1:32:36] these things you
[1:32:37] know because you want to set up a
[1:32:40] consecrated space for you to live I want
[1:32:42] you to understand it's not a flesh and
[1:32:44] blood thing even on your job have you
[1:32:46] consecrated your
[1:32:50] desk I'm bringing real to because people
[1:32:53] out there we don't talk about it much we
[1:32:55] we say people hand dirty and this and
[1:32:57] for somebody hand to be dirty they they
[1:33:00] at the
[1:33:02] altar you don't think they OB a man and
[1:33:05] it's altars they have you know but the
[1:33:07] brandham stood and the witch doctor
[1:33:09] brought the storm but the BAM sent his
[1:33:10] storm back the doctor brought the storm
[1:33:13] two
[1:33:14] priests altars at work and until brother
[1:33:18] BR say I bind you in the name of Jesus
[1:33:21] Christ he had to shut down the priest
[1:33:24] because the priest had accessed to his
[1:33:25] altar what do you think Janes and jambes
[1:33:27] were doing playing video
[1:33:32] games they were priests they were
[1:33:35] getting power from another source it
[1:33:37] meant they had an
[1:33:39] altar as a way to pull power from that
[1:33:42] to do their Stakes as
[1:33:45] well this is not a flesh and blood
[1:33:49] thing and he want to walk in and out of
[1:33:52] church as if no
[1:33:54] you are priest also are you accessing
[1:33:57] your right as a priest do you understand
[1:33:59] the power you have as a priest that when
[1:34:02] the perfect sacrifice came and the veil
[1:34:04] was rent from top to bottom it gave you
[1:34:06] direct
[1:34:08] access as a priest to exercise your
[1:34:12] Spiritual Authority as a priest to
[1:34:15] establish your altar as a priest and
[1:34:18] they say Lord your son here in need my
[1:34:21] house in need I needed to to move upon
[1:34:23] my house but child in trouble and God
[1:34:25] could dispatch Angels because a priest
[1:34:28] has made contact through a altar with a
[1:34:31] sacrifice God always Honors
[1:34:39] that in the Old Testament you have to
[1:34:42] bring your sacrifice to the priest the
[1:34:43] priest had to take it to the Altar and
[1:34:45] you have to wait there while he examined
[1:34:47] the sacrifice to see if God would accept
[1:34:49] it but now under this New Covenant you
[1:34:52] are your own priest you need to go to
[1:34:54] any priest you are your priest you
[1:34:57] supposed to have a prayer life you
[1:34:59] supposed to have a holy walk you
[1:35:00] supposed to have a holy life and you
[1:35:03] have direct access you have a right over
[1:35:06] access nobody can stop you from moving
[1:35:09] into the holies of holies
[1:35:15] Hallelujah are you exercising your
[1:35:18] Authority in other words you get a new
[1:35:20] job you say I claim this amen for the
[1:35:23] honor and glory of God hallelujah I just

[1:38:34] Leviticus 16
[1:38:37] verse1 after the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:38:41] and the Lord spake unto Moses rather
[1:38:42] Leviticus 16:1 after the death of the
[1:38:45] two sons of
[1:38:47] Aaron when they had offered before the
[1:38:49] Lord and died
[1:38:53] and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto
[1:38:55] Aaron thy
[1:38:57] brother that he come not at all times
[1:39:00] into the holy place with in the veil
[1:39:02] before the mercy seat which is upon the
[1:39:03] ark that he die not for I will appear in
[1:39:07] the cloud upon The Mercy Seat thus shall
[1:39:10] Aaron come into the holy place with a
[1:39:13] young bulock for a sin offering and a
[1:39:15] RAM for a burnt offering he shall put on
[1:39:18] the holy linen coat and he shall have
[1:39:21] the linen breaches upon his flesh and
[1:39:23] shall be girded with a linen girdle and
[1:39:25] with the linen M her shall he be attired
[1:39:28] These Are Holy garments therefore shall
[1:39:31] he wash his flesh in water and so put
[1:39:34] them
[1:39:35] on Amen and he shall take of the
[1:39:38] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:39:40] two kids of the goats for a sin offering
[1:39:42] and one RAM for a burnt offering and
[1:39:45] Aaron shall offer his Bullock of the sin
[1:39:47] offering which is for himself and make
[1:39:49] an atonement for himself and for his
[1:39:52] house and he shall take the two goats
[1:39:54] and present them before the Lord at the
[1:39:56] door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:39:57] congregation and Aaron shall cast lots
[1:40:00] upon the Two Goats one lot for the Lord
[1:40:02] and the other lot for the scapegoat and
[1:40:04] heel shall bring the goat upon the
[1:40:06] Lord's lot which the Lord lot fell and
[1:40:08] offer him for a sin
[1:40:10] offering and it goes on and on you could
[1:40:12] you could spend time in this I want you
[1:40:13] to see the sanctity and the sacredness
[1:40:15] and the
[1:40:17] approach we are too casual with the
[1:40:20] things of
[1:40:22] God Amen
[1:40:24] God is not giving Aaron options and
[1:40:26] choices with how to approach him but the
[1:40:29] Brandon preacher message approach to
[1:40:31] God we cannot approach God the way we
[1:40:33] want to approach
[1:40:35] him God is setting a
[1:40:38] standard and all true scripture it's a
[1:40:42] standard and we want to fight with how
[1:40:44] to dress and cover your knees and these
[1:40:46] these baby things you know because God
[1:40:48] said if you come into my presence and
[1:40:50] you're not right you're dead amen amen
[1:40:53] because I am Holy I'm God and I change
[1:40:55] not we have and we have to begin and
[1:40:57] treat our homes must be consecrated do
[1:41:00] you know one time brother brandham they
[1:41:01] brought brother BR to a meeting and they
[1:41:02] brought him to a hotel and when he got
[1:41:04] there they said this is your room
[1:41:05] brother BR we have here as he steps in
[1:41:07] he say I can't go in this room
[1:41:08] fornication took place
[1:41:11] here the spirit still
[1:41:16] there you understand he a spiritual what
[1:41:19] another time going to car somebody
[1:41:20] inside the car with him and the guy
[1:41:22] speaking and but say pooke a Blue Streak
[1:41:25] break the anointing so but BR was very
[1:41:27] careful who you allow in his car who you
[1:41:29] allow in the
[1:41:30] room because it's a spiritual real you
[1:41:32] might see it you got but it's a
[1:41:35] spiritual real you have to be careful
[1:41:36] God who you allowed to talk to
[1:41:39] you there's some things you don't want
[1:41:41] to hear there's something you don't want
[1:41:42] to know there things some things you
[1:41:43] don't want to
[1:41:44] see and young people you see music music
[1:41:47] is a channel
[1:41:49] no music is an
[1:41:51] altar music itself self is a channel
[1:41:54] it's an
[1:41:56] altar even in the natural in court cases
[1:42:00] they talk about what music the people
[1:42:02] listen to before they before they did
[1:42:03] the drive by shooting because the music
[1:42:06] put them in an atmosphere to do what
[1:42:08] they had to
[1:42:09] do and we know it from the scripture
[1:42:12] when David played the ha he was able to
[1:42:14] push Spirits away you can't find in the
[1:42:17] Old Testament casting out the demons but
[1:42:19] music was used to move the Demonic realm
[1:42:22] and if music could be used to push
[1:42:23] Spirits away then music could also be
[1:42:25] used to draw the Holy Spirit to
[1:42:27] you what music what music forms part of
[1:42:30] your altar part of your worship what
[1:42:32] music do you play in your house in your
[1:42:34] car as a priest I'm challenging us
[1:42:38] because you wonder the victory you want
[1:42:39] to overcome and asking how can I
[1:42:40] overcome and these are the things that
[1:42:42] you have to be so mindful of so
[1:42:45] sensitive because you a
[1:42:49] priest I don't know who this is to help
[1:42:51] but I just want to make sure you
[1:42:52] understand these
[1:43:00] things worship is so built so that while
[1:43:03] Moses is up there any Ten Commandments
[1:43:05] what they doing what Giants and Jes lead
[1:43:06] them to
[1:43:07] do make a God and make an
[1:43:10] altar golden calf and an altar to offer
[1:43:13] sacrifice to the golden calf think about
[1:43:16] it and the children who would just
[1:43:18] delivered they there jumping up in the
[1:43:21] party
[1:43:25] because it's built into us to
[1:43:31] worship let's go
[1:43:34] to First Kings
[1:43:42] 18 and I want to deal here with Elijah
[1:43:45] because here's another example we know
[1:43:49] it the children of Israel true Biblical
[1:43:52] history
[1:43:53] you see many times God said them right
[1:43:56] and before you know it there's some
[1:43:57] false god and in case of Ahab Ahab
[1:44:00] brought Jezebel in and Jezebel brought
[1:44:01] her deities and with her deities people
[1:44:04] start to erect altars to these false
[1:44:06] gods and in the result of doing this no
[1:44:09] one was maintaining the altar of
[1:44:11] God so the altar of God is run down it's
[1:44:17] broken First Kings
[1:44:20] 18 verse 17 and it came to pass when
[1:44:23] Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him
[1:44:26] art thou he that troubleth
[1:44:29] Israel and he answered I have not
[1:44:31] troubled Israel but thou and thy
[1:44:33] father's house in that you have forsaken
[1:44:35] the Commandments of the Lord and thou
[1:44:37] Hast followed bam now therefore send and
[1:44:40] gather to me all Israel unto Mount carel
[1:44:43] and the prophets of Baal 450 and the
[1:44:46] prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at
[1:44:48] Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all
[1:44:51] the children of Israel and gathered the
[1:44:53] prophets together unto Mount Caramel and
[1:44:56] Elijah came unto all the people and said
[1:44:58] how long Hal he between two
[1:45:02] opinions and that's a message to the
[1:45:04] church this morning how long you want to
[1:45:06] be between the world and God how long
[1:45:07] you between your ideas and God how long
[1:45:09] as a young person your parents bringing
[1:45:12] it to church your parents coming to
[1:45:13] church and you and and but you still
[1:45:15] there trying to figure out if the world
[1:45:16] is for
[1:45:18] you Hallelujah you know when they come
[1:45:20] here you feel something amen you know
[1:45:23] there's a pull on your heart there's a
[1:45:24] yearning in you for something
[1:45:27] more so Elijah looking at them and see
[1:45:30] them caught in
[1:45:31] incision because leadership is corrupt
[1:45:34] Ahab has led them astray but you still
[1:45:36] could choose so he say how long will you
[1:45:38] halt between two
[1:45:43] opinions if the Lord be God follow him
[1:45:46] but if bail then follow him and the
[1:45:48] people answered him not a word nobody
[1:45:51] say anything somebody church just quiet
[1:45:54] people just there nobody answered they
[1:45:56] they
[1:45:57] caught and then Elijah said unto the
[1:46:00] people I even I only remain a prophet of
[1:46:02] the Lord but Bale's Prophet are 450
[1:46:08] Men Let Them therefore give us two
[1:46:10] Bullocks and let them choose one bulock
[1:46:12] for themselves and cut it into pieces
[1:46:14] he's talking about the sacrifice now and
[1:46:16] lay it on the wood and put no fire under
[1:46:19] and I will dress the other bulock and
[1:46:21] lay it on wood and put no fire under and
[1:46:24] call ye on the name of your gods and I
[1:46:27] will call on the name of the Lord and
[1:46:29] the god that answered by fire let him be
[1:46:32] God and all the people answered and said
[1:46:34] it is well spoken because at the end of
[1:46:36] the day when we see fire we know it's
[1:46:39] God can the church say amen and Elijah
[1:46:43] said unto the prophets of Bale choose
[1:46:44] you one Bullock for yourself and dress
[1:46:46] it
[1:46:48] first for ye are
[1:46:50] many so Elijah turn to him he say it's
[1:46:53] plenty of all you I don't know how all
[1:46:55] you go and cut the Bullock I don't know
[1:46:56] how all but I know it's plenty all so
[1:46:57] all you fix all your mix choose your
[1:46:59] sacrifice first this is a war of altars
[1:47:01] a war of sacrifices and a war of priests
[1:47:04] call on the name of your God but put no
[1:47:06] fire under and they took the bulock
[1:47:09] which was given them and they dressed it
[1:47:10] and call in the name of ba from morning
[1:47:13] evening until noon saying oh Baal hear
[1:47:16] us but there was no voice no any that
[1:47:18] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[1:47:21] which was made
[1:47:23] that's why when you see people jumping
[1:47:24] and shouting you have to be careful what
[1:47:25] they doing or know because not all jump
[1:47:27] and Shout is to the true God they out
[1:47:29] there doing all kind of thing trying to
[1:47:30] get this thing to work but it can't work
[1:47:33] can the church say amen and it came to
[1:47:35] pass at noon that Elijah mugged them and
[1:47:37] said cry aloud maybe your volume is high
[1:47:40] enough for he is a god lower case G
[1:47:43] either he is talking he can't multitask
[1:47:46] or he is pursuing running after
[1:47:48] something or he is in a journey or per
[1:47:50] Advent he sleeping and must be awake
[1:47:55] but I want you to catch these people are
[1:47:56] following their conviction you know they
[1:47:59] are say this thing I working you know
[1:48:01] and they cried aloud and cut themselves
[1:48:05] after their manner cutting themselves is
[1:48:07] a form is is a sacrifice so they
[1:48:09] actually increasing their sacrifice to
[1:48:12] get this thing to work I want you to
[1:48:14] understand the spiritual Dimension here
[1:48:16] at
[1:48:17] work after their manner with knives and
[1:48:20] until the blood gushed out from them
[1:48:22] it's not blood rush out from them they
[1:48:24] are now doing blood sacrifice these are
[1:48:26] children of Israel turned to blood
[1:48:29] sacrifice in honor of their false
[1:48:32] god and it came to pass when midday was
[1:48:35] passed and they prophesied until the
[1:48:38] time of the offering of the evening
[1:48:39] sacrifice that there was neither voice
[1:48:42] nor any to answer nor any that regarded

[1:50:05] to the number of the tribes of the sons
[1:50:07] of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:50:10] came saying Israel shall be thy name and
[1:50:13] with the stones he built an altar in the
[1:50:15] name of the Lord and he made a trench
[1:50:17] about the altar as great as would
[1:50:20] contain two measures of seed and he put
[1:50:22] the wood in order and cut the bulock in
[1:50:24] pieces and laid him on the wood and said
[1:50:27] fill four barrels with water so he did
[1:50:30] what they didn't do he made it almost
[1:50:32] impossible for fire to catch because he
[1:50:34] is so confident that the altar is
[1:50:36] restored he is so confident that the
[1:50:39] sacrifice was worthy he is so confident
[1:50:41] that his priesthood is in order that he
[1:50:43] doesn't have no fear he has no doubt he

[1:51:04] in his priesthood he is confident that
[1:51:06] the altar is restored and the day you

[1:51:22] [Applause]
[1:51:25] he made a trench about the altar as
[1:51:27] great as would contain two measures of
[1:51:30] seed and he put the wood in order so the
[1:51:32] stones would already in place now he put
[1:51:35] the wood in order and cut the Bullock in
[1:51:37] pieces I want you to notice it's in
[1:51:39] order there's a structure there's a
[1:51:41] system isn't a feeling something no

[1:51:45] there's a certain way to come to church
[1:51:47] there's a certain way you come prayed up
[1:51:49] there's a certain way you leave even
[1:51:51] Jesus said when you come to the alt he
[1:51:53] said when you come to bring your
[1:51:54] offering if you have ought against
[1:51:55] somebody leave it there go make it right
[1:51:57] and then come back oh God there's an
[1:51:59] approach to God there's an approach to
[1:52:01] the altar can the church say Amen is
[1:52:03] that playing church let the god that
[1:52:06] answer by fire let that God be God can

[1:52:14] Amen if your altar is broken this
[1:52:17] morning I I want you to fix it
[1:52:20] hallelujah hallelujah and he put the
[1:52:22] wood in order and he cut the bulock in
[1:52:25] pieces and laid him on the wood and said
[1:52:27] fill four barrels of water and pour it
[1:52:30] under burnt sacrifice and under the wood
[1:52:33] and he said do it the second time and
[1:52:35] they did it the second time and he said
[1:52:37] do it the third time other words I don't
[1:52:38] want you to wonder if I had anything to
[1:52:41] do with
[1:52:44] it I want this thing to look
[1:52:48] impossible put more water put more water
[1:52:52] put more water this is not manx this is
[1:52:54] not a performer this is not a
[1:52:55] Pentecostal church trying to make
[1:52:57] something happen
[1:53:04] no and the water ran round about the
[1:53:07] Altar and then he fill the trench also
[1:53:09] with water and it came to pass at the
[1:53:12] time of the offering of the evening
[1:53:15] sacrifice so Elijah is sensitive of the
[1:53:18] time he's sensitive of the season it's
[1:53:20] the time of the offering of the evening
[1:53:21] sacrifice the brothers were backs they
[1:53:23] didn't understand evening sacrific they
[1:53:24] had forgotten all these things but here
[1:53:26] it was Elijah has restored the altar
[1:53:28] thank God for Elijah Prophet William
[1:53:31] Branham Malachi 4 who has restored the
[1:53:34] altar restored the faith restor the
[1:53:36] fullness of the word tie up every loose
[1:53:38] end reveal every mystery showed us how
[1:53:41] to struct to the altar showed us how to
[1:53:43] walk in harmony show us how to forgive
[1:53:45] our brother show us Faith all the way to
[1:53:47] charity show us a promise of a Rapture
[1:53:50] promise of a resurrection promise of a
[1:53:51] new city promise of a body change
[1:53:54] promise of seven Living Voices promise
[1:53:56] of seven tunders Gathering a bride a
[1:53:58] promise of seven tunders showing a bride
[1:54:00] how to
[1:54:01] go so we can come boldly to the throne
[1:54:04] of
[1:54:10] God and it came to pass at the time of
[1:54:14] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:54:16] that Elijah the prophet came near and
[1:54:18] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of
[1:54:21] Israel let it be known this day that
[1:54:23] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[1:54:26] servant and that I have done all these
[1:54:28] things at Thy
[1:54:30] Word in other words he's praying there
[1:54:33] hearing him he's saying Lord I'm not
[1:54:34] coming with my own idea I'm not coming
[1:54:36] with my own Revelation I don't have my
[1:54:38] own inspiration because a true prophet
[1:54:40] of God is a vessel that allows God to
[1:54:42] speak through them he is just a
[1:54:44] microphone I am just doing at your
[1:54:46] command I want the people to know that
[1:54:48] what they just saw wasn't my
[1:54:50] interpretation of what should be done
[1:54:52] but what I just did was what you wanted
[1:54:54] me to
[1:54:55] do Lord make a servant to do just what
[1:54:58] you want us to do so Elijah is praying
[1:55:01] on a
[1:55:02] foundation that I have done all these
[1:55:04] things that I would hear me oh Lord hear
[1:55:07] me that this people may know that thou
[1:55:10] art the Lord God and that thou has
[1:55:12] turned their heart back again you see
[1:55:14] those words and those are the same words
[1:55:16] like our Elijah turn the heart back
[1:55:18] again turn the heart back to the faith
[1:55:20] of the fathers this is the first Elijah
[1:55:22] in
[1:55:23] Hallelujah can the church say amen amen
[1:55:26] then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:55:28] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:55:30] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:55:32] licked up the water that was in the
[1:55:34] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:55:36] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:55:38] the Lord he is the god the Lord he is
[1:55:41] the god and Elijah said unto them take
[1:55:43] the prophets of Baal let not one of them
[1:55:45] escape and they took them and Elijah
[1:55:48] brought them down to the brook hean and
[1:55:50] slew them there amen
[1:55:53] and Elijah said un Ahab and now listen
[1:55:55] now now that the altar has been restored
[1:55:58] now that fire fall he said Ahab get thee
[1:56:00] up eat and drink there's a sound of
[1:56:02] abundance of
[1:56:06] raino Hallelujah Hallelujah in other
[1:56:09] words God was waiting on the restoration
[1:56:11] of the altar to send
[1:56:14] rain soon the altar was restored rain
[1:56:17] could come ahab's still in a condition
[1:56:19] you know but the altar has been restored
[1:56:21] once altar is restored I hear the sound
[1:56:25] of the abundance of rain and I'm under
[1:56:27] expectation for some altars to be
[1:56:30] restored in this church I can't speak
[1:56:32] for any other church but I'm looking for
[1:56:34] some altars some men to take their
[1:56:36] places some sisters to take their places
[1:56:38] restore the altars of your prayer life
[1:56:41] restore the altars of your sacrifices
[1:56:43] restore your priesthood oh Hallelujah
[1:56:46] and I tell you once the altar is
[1:56:48] restored I hear the
[1:56:50] sound of the abundance of
[1:56:53] [Applause]
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:10] BR what does this teach us God's
[1:57:13] covenant and his manifestation are tied
[1:57:16] to his
[1:57:18] worship because the hour cometh and now
[1:57:20] is that the true worshippers will
[1:57:21] worship in spirit and in truth how God
[1:57:23] could send rain and there's altars
[1:57:25] erected in your life against false
[1:57:28] gods how could God bless you and you
[1:57:30] have false gods false Idols false altars
[1:57:34] but the moment Elijah say kill all the
[1:57:36] priests break down all them altars now
[1:57:39] the true altar has been established true
[1:57:41] worship has been reestablished true
[1:57:43] sacrifice has been established it's not
[1:57:45] just my word saying it has been
[1:57:47] established but the fire of God has
[1:57:49] proven God has accepted this sacrifice
[1:57:52] God has accepted that the altar has been
[1:57:54] restored he has consumed it he has
[1:57:56] burned the offering
[1:57:58] himself he has honored the priesthood he
[1:58:01] has honored the altar he has honored the
[1:58:03] sacrifice father Let the Fire Fall go
[1:58:06] tell them I hear a sound of the
[1:58:09] abundance of
[1:58:10] rain Elijah is in the prophetic
[1:58:19] woo and I want you to see something here
[1:58:21] now
[1:58:23] catch this the altar is restored the
[1:58:26] priesthood is established the sacrifice
[1:58:29] has been accepted Elijah is speaking by
[1:58:31] the PO in the spirit real he said I hear
[1:58:34] the sound of a bonance
[1:58:37] arain and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee
[1:58:40] up eat and drink for there's a sound of
[1:58:41] an abundant rain and Ahab went up to eat
[1:58:43] and the drink and Elijah went up to the
[1:58:45] top of Cel and he cast himself down upon
[1:58:48] the Earth and put his face between his
[1:58:50] knees and he said to his Serv go up now
[1:58:53] look toward the sea and he went up and
[1:58:56] looked and said there is
[1:58:58] nothing so I want you to catch something
[1:59:00] now Elijah is in the spirit realm he not
[1:59:02] in the humanistic realm so when he say I
[1:59:04] hear the sound your B of rain he's in
[1:59:06] the spirit realm know this sound a
[1:59:07] reached them
[1:59:09] yet the clouds a reach yet but he knows
[1:59:12] that once the altar is restored once his
[1:59:14] sacrific is accepted once the priesthood
[1:59:17] is recognized there has to be a
[1:59:18] manifestation of God that follows a
[1:59:21] restored altar there must be a
[1:59:22] manifestation of
[1:59:28] God there's a connection between a
[1:59:31] proper Altar and God's
[1:59:33] covenant back to Abraham it is when
[1:59:36] Abraham went to offer Isaac and God to
[1:59:38] stop him he say okay look I give you a
[1:59:41] provided sacrifice after that he said
[1:59:43] now I know you believe me now I know you
[1:59:44] follow me he said now thy seed shall
[1:59:46] possess he tied a covenant to the altar
[1:59:52] [Applause]
[1:59:53] so you looking for God to do something
[1:59:54] in your life restore your altar get the
[1:59:57] sacrifice in order get your prayer life
[1:59:59] in order get your life cleaned up break

[2:00:10] spoken word books in your hand get your
[2:00:12] consecrated

[2:00:20] else here but God and my go in your
[2:00:22] secret closet oh come on now somebody
[2:00:24] help me oh it could be in the back of
[2:00:27] your house it could be in the corner
[2:00:28] somewhere where just you and God Alone
[2:00:31] is say Lord I'm making my altar right
[2:00:32] here you're not doing it for
[2:00:39] sure is there anybody with
[2:00:43] me and it becomes your daily altar your
[2:00:47] daily sacrifice your daily worship your
[2:00:51] daily prayer
[2:00:52] your daily consecration in the morning
[2:00:54] and the evening the morning sacrifice
[2:00:57] the evening sacrifice and your faith
[2:00:59] growing you're reading the word every
[2:01:01] day you're praying every day and the
[2:01:03] quality of your priesthood is just
[2:01:05] Rising the quality of your altar Rising
[2:01:08] the quality of your sacrifice Rising
[2:01:11] holy acceptable pleasing unto God you
[2:01:14] begin to turn down the TV turn down the
[2:01:17] radio turn down the social media turn
[2:01:19] down the internet because you realize in
[2:01:22] you are more a priest than an accountant
[2:01:25] you are more a priest than a secretary
[2:01:27] you are more a priest than a policeman
[2:01:30] you're more a priest than even a deacon
[2:01:32] you're more a priest than even a
[2:01:34] minister you are royal priest
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:51] oh I feel
[2:01:53] good Elijah is so convinced no wonder
[2:01:57] the prophet of God could say it's so
[2:01:58] close I could almost feel it he said
[2:02:00] there'll be a super Church there'll be a
[2:02:02] super race as we near The Headstone it's
[2:02:05] almost here I could feel it he was
[2:02:06] seeing the altar restored he was in the
[2:02:08] fullness of the word in its place no
[2:02:10] loose and every mystery revealed he know
[2:02:12] all the material is here he say Rapture
[2:02:14] and Faith lay in the
[2:02:16] message it's just a bring the pieces
[2:02:19] together oh
[2:02:22] woo friends when Elijah repaired the
[2:02:25] altar those stones he didn't bring a
[2:02:28] truck with stones you
[2:02:30] know those stones were there they just
[2:02:32] had fallen away he went at fixed back
[2:02:35] put this piece restore the ancient
[2:02:38] landmarks bring back the prayer meetings
[2:02:41] bring back the old fashion bring back a
[2:02:43] Revival he didn't bring new stones and
[2:02:45] say listen hold up hold up let me go on
[2:02:47] and bring the truck with what
[2:02:49] no the same quotes
[2:02:52] the same scriptures the same word the
[2:02:55] same word more positive that's how we
[2:02:57] raise a standard the same quotes the
[2:02:59] same tapes it was there all along but
[2:03:02] nobody was tending to it brother kangali
[2:03:04] so when Elijah came he looked around he
[2:03:07] said this one represent the tribe of
[2:03:09] Judah oh God this one the tribe of
[2:03:11] Zebulon this one the tribe of God this
[2:03:14] one represent Faith this one represent
[2:03:18] virtue this one represent knowledge this
[2:03:21] one repr represent Temperance this one
[2:03:23] represent
[2:03:24] [Applause]
[2:03:31] patience and once
[2:03:33] restored fire has to fall because God
[2:03:36] respects his sacrifice God honors his
[2:03:40] altars and we said it before a altar
[2:03:44] like I heard somebody say this Earthly
[2:03:46] realm we live in spirits need permission
[2:03:49] to operate
[2:03:50] here so the children of Israel cried and
[2:03:53] God say I've heard the cries and I'll
[2:03:54] come down in response we saw Daniel
[2:03:57] reach out to Heaven by fasting and
[2:03:59] brother over always says it brother said
[2:04:00] it fasting amplifies your prayers so
[2:04:03] when Daniel called then the angel
[2:04:06] respond he said I've come because of
[2:04:07] your words if you didn't call I wasn't
[2:04:12] coming but an altar with a sacrifice is
[2:04:16] a direct access for God to drop down
[2:04:19] that fragrance that oh my good that's
[2:04:22] right brother Anthony it's a hookup it's
[2:04:25] a connection God sees the altar he say I
[2:04:27] can land right
[2:04:30] here I can make my presence known right
[2:04:33] [Applause]
[2:04:39] here hallelujah I heard somebody say a
[2:04:42] altar is like a runway in an airport if
[2:04:45] you have no altar no Spirits could
[2:04:49] land but when you have an altar
[2:04:52] than the spirit land the kind of altar
[2:04:55] you have determine what Spirit
[2:04:58] lands so when you ENT worldly music and
[2:05:00] worldly music is your altar then you
[2:05:02] have a set of planes coming
[2:05:04] in your immigration line
[2:05:14] crazy and this war of altars and that's
[2:05:18] why but say this there's these two
[2:05:19] voices fighting these two Indians
[2:05:21] fighting these fighting in your head
[2:05:23] fighting your life because some of us we
[2:05:25] have two we have competing altars in
[2:05:27] your life you come to church here and
[2:05:30] the Holy Ghost come and clean up certain
[2:05:32] and you start to cut away and and and
[2:05:34] and the ho go come cold close to you but
[2:05:36] when you go back in your home or your
[2:05:37] job your there and your walk we
[2:05:38] listening to whatever you listening to
[2:05:40] that open up channels and open up
[2:05:43] doors and it because the confusion in
[2:05:45] your life you need to shut down one
[2:05:50] Runway I don't have
[2:05:53] [Applause]
[2:06:03] anybody I don't know if anybody
[2:06:05] remembers during
[2:06:08] covid-19 I can't remember which country
[2:06:10] it was one of the one of these South
[2:06:12] American or Central American countries
[2:06:15] at that point they were Banning closing
[2:06:16] along airports and that kind of
[2:06:17] different things this country said
[2:06:20] listen they actually pass parked a plane
[2:06:22] across the
[2:06:25] runway because I don't think Co had hit
[2:06:27] them yet they Park a plane across say
[2:06:29] nobody
[2:06:32] Landing they would have taken no chances
[2:06:35] they Park a plane across the runway so
[2:06:37] even if they radio and you play get
[2:06:39] radio say I have no place to land CU
[2:06:40] they say everything I coming could never
[2:06:44] spread and this is why it's so much to
[2:06:46] tear down the false altars to the false
[2:06:49] Idols because if these altars don't
[2:06:51] exists you cut off the Demonic realm
[2:06:55] when we say Satan will be bound for a
[2:06:57] thousand years friends I want you to
[2:06:58] catch this if your the microphone on is
[2:07:00] in the back Brothers the microphone is
[2:07:03] on if you cut off the Demonic Realm by
[2:07:07] having no Altar for entry how the enemy
[2:07:10] going to
[2:07:11] move if the devil could find no place
[2:07:15] inside the hearts of the Believers here
[2:07:17] the devil is
[2:07:19] powerless let me say that one more time
[2:07:21] if Satan cannot find a grip on one
[2:07:24] person in this room Satan is
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:30] powerless and the more you get sold out
[2:07:33] to
[2:07:34] God and the more the enemy leaves your
[2:07:37] life is the more power you have to
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:43] overcome and there's a reason there's
[2:07:46] filling and refilling and they will
[2:07:48] refill again because the reality is you
[2:07:49] want to keep this thing top until it
[2:07:51] running over until it's fully consumed
[2:07:54] until there's no room there's no place
[2:07:56] there was no place found for the devil
[2:07:58] in heaven you know and we have to reach
[2:08:00] the point that there's no place found
[2:08:01] for him on Earth also and no place found
[2:08:03] for him in your Earth
[2:08:06] also and but the brandham gave us
[2:08:08] confidence he said a man could live such
[2:08:11] a life the devil don't even know what to
[2:08:12] do with
[2:08:14] him can I say that one more time but say
[2:08:17] you can live such a life the devil don't
[2:08:18] even know what to do with you he say you
[2:08:19] know what I didn't even stress myself
[2:08:20] there has to be easier
[2:08:25] Target there has to be the devil get
[2:08:27] stressed out he trying to get you this
[2:08:29] way and this way but you put on your
[2:08:31] whole armor you know we wrestling
[2:08:32] against flesh and blood so he come you
[2:08:34] have your Shield you have your sword you
[2:08:36] have your breastplate they will say okay
[2:08:38] and listen you talk to any security
[2:08:40] professional they would tell you that
[2:08:41] how the the the the criminal elements
[2:08:42] working they look for soft
[2:08:45] targets because it's real work to go
[2:08:47] after a heart Target if you have two
[2:08:49] houses one with one dog and one with 82
[2:08:51] dogs
[2:08:53] you had to be a foolish criminal to go
[2:08:55] on 82 dogs are going brave no you'll go
[2:08:58] after the one with one dog and there
[2:09:00] comes a point where you as a son become
[2:09:02] so fortified when you walk like when
[2:09:04] Jesus H there and Legion and them say
[2:09:06] they say listen listen listen you come
[2:09:08] to talk many because they recognize the
[2:09:10] power that was in
[2:09:12] Jesus and you know what that's what
[2:09:14] Jesus is played is promised his end time
[2:09:16] bride when you walk his street demons
[2:09:18] start to cross his street demons start
[2:09:20] to change and disguise they don't want
[2:09:23] you to see them know because you have
[2:09:25] power in you greater is he that's in you
[2:09:28] than you that he that's in the world do
[2:09:30] you understand that the greatest trick
[2:09:32] the devil has to play on you is to let
[2:09:34] you think you are less than you
[2:09:38] are can I say it one more time the best
[2:09:41] weapon the devil has with a punch is to
[2:09:43] deceive you that you have no
[2:09:45] power that's why but Brown said the
[2:09:47] moment the bride gets to know who she is
[2:09:52] the moment you realize that I'm a royal
[2:09:54] priest you are a king and a
[2:09:56] priest this entire service we talking
[2:09:59] about priesthood but you are King also
[2:10:02] and King means power and authority

[2:10:09] this Earth over every principality over
[2:10:12] every power over every unclean thing

[2:10:28] worship is the most precious worship the
[2:10:31] Angels can't worship like you the Angels
[2:10:34] can't sing Amazing Grace oh
[2:10:38] hallelujah it's not the same when you
[2:10:40] sing Holy Holy Holy God loves this more
[2:10:44] than when the angel sing Holy Holy Holy
[2:10:46] because he paid a price for you he
[2:10:48] didn't pay a price for the Angels oh you
[2:10:50] don't hear me this morning he didn't pay
[2:10:52] a price for the Angels they were created
[2:10:54] but he purchased

[2:11:00] most valuable purchase

[2:12:44] the sovereignty of God has him moving
[2:12:46] with his
[2:12:47] prde you don't hear me let me say it one
[2:12:49] more time God is powerful enough to move
[2:12:52] alone but he doesn't want to do that he
[2:12:55] doesn't like being alone he was alone
[2:12:57] all by himself he didn't like the
[2:12:59] feeling so he doesn't want to be king
[2:13:01] alone he wants to be king of
[2:13:04] kings you don't hear me this morning he
[2:13:07] doesn't want to be the only priest he
[2:13:09] wants to be the high priest and have a
[2:13:11] lot of
[2:13:12] priests you are Kings and Priests

[2:13:40] fullness thereof but God doesn't want to
[2:13:42] be king of the earth you
[2:13:44] know he doesn't want to be king of the
[2:13:46] earth he already appointed the king for
[2:13:48] the Earth I'm looking at the kings of
[2:13:50] the Earth
[2:13:52] you are the ones who give dominion
[2:13:54] Genesis 1:26 let that man have
[2:13:57] dominion you were always the kings of
[2:14:00] the Earth but Lucifer with his slippery
[2:14:03] hands tried to get the title D to this
[2:14:05] earth and it slip back into the hands of
[2:14:08] the r
[2:14:10] w and all these years since Genesis the
[2:14:13] revelation God has been waiting for the
[2:14:16] king priests to come back into position
[2:14:32] you may be seated I'm trying to find a
[2:14:34] place to land this
[2:14:36] morning but I feel good to know that he
[2:14:39] included me brother George simple old me
[2:14:43] the King of Kings want to make me a king
[2:14:47] to rule with him the great high priest
[2:14:49] but the Terry want you to to be a priest
[2:14:51] with him offering spiritual sacrifice
[2:14:54] not just offering spiritual sacrifice
[2:14:56] but he made us
[2:14:58] [Applause]
[2:15:06] sacrifices you may be seated to confuse
[2:15:09] the
[2:15:10] devil and this is so powerful the amount
[2:15:13] of stuff God wrapped up in us that David
[2:15:17] and Moses and them couldn't tap
[2:15:19] into and I preached it before in the Old
[2:15:21] Testament you had to be in the T in the
[2:15:23] tribe of Levi to be a
[2:15:25] priest you couldn't be a priest out of
[2:15:27] the tribe of Judah it was
[2:15:29] impossible kings came froma
[2:15:31] Judah so you couldn't be a king froma
[2:15:35] levite so that's why when they talk
[2:15:38] about Jesus say he came off the order of
[2:15:41] mzc meaning he didn't come a Levi but he
[2:15:43] tapped into a older priesthood and
[2:15:46] Levi the priest that Abraham paid tis to
[2:15:49] him and Levi paid tis through Abraham to
[2:15:51] MDC the prince of Salem the Prince of
[2:15:54] Peace Jesus Christ his theophany King

[2:16:05] that kind of thing for us oh God help me
[2:16:06] this
[2:16:07] morning what they could not be by a
[2:16:11] royal lineage we could become that we
[2:16:14] could merge a tribe of Judah with the
[2:16:16] tribe of Levi and we could be both Kings
[2:16:19] and Priests
[2:16:20] [Applause]
[2:16:23] [Music]

[2:24:21] not talking about our love to him you
[2:24:24] know this is his love to
[2:24:27] us it was preaching a meeting for his
[2:24:29] own name's
[2:24:31] sake to protect his reputation the fact
[2:24:34] that he choose you means he has to do
[2:24:36] everything he needs to do to make sure

[2:25:19] all things work together for good to
[2:25:21] them who love God and are called
[2:25:22] according to his
[2:25:24] purpose but ye are I'm trying to close
[2:25:27] out a chosen generation a royal
[2:25:30] priesthood and I've preached it before
[2:25:32] when God told Moses this Moses just
[2:25:35] those Brothers just had to repeat by
[2:25:37] Revelation what they were told they
[2:25:38] didn't understand it he told Moses
[2:25:40] you'll be a kingdom of
[2:25:42] priests and Moses had to repeat it Moses
[2:25:46] but just like the the the the prophet
[2:25:49] Isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[2:25:51] how could Isaiah explain that he said
[2:25:52] that what God tell me just say I saying
[2:25:54] it Moses say you'll be a kingdom of
[2:25:56] priests and Moses couldn't explain it
[2:25:58] but here we see Christ Jesus king priest
[2:26:01] and now look in this room this is the
[2:26:03] kingdom of priest Moses was speaking
[2:26:05] about a gentile
[2:26:07] race because this wasn't for the
[2:26:10] Jews Hallelujah a chosen generation a
[2:26:14] royal priesthood and holy nation A
[2:26:16] peculiar people that he should show
[2:26:18] forth the Praises of him who had called
[2:26:21] you out of Darkness into His Marvelous
[2:26:23] Light May the Lord richly bless you
[2:26:26] Church the war of
[2:26:29] altars sacrifices and Priests I want to
[2:26:32] encourage you to rededicate your
[2:26:35] life consecrate your altar if you have
[2:26:39] not built a family altar build
[2:26:42] it if you had one and it fall apart
[2:26:45] restore
[2:26:46] it it's important he say I'll meet you
[2:26:49] the I'll meet you in there in that
[2:26:50] secret Closet in that secret room where
[2:26:54] it's just you and God it's not a show
[2:26:55] it's not for anybody else it's not he
[2:26:57] said when you're praying see when you
[2:26:59] pray pray in secret so God can reward
[2:27:01] you openly this is not a public altar
[2:27:03] now it's a holy life consecrated
[2:27:06] dedicated to God approaching God a
[2:27:09] certain way approaching the service a
[2:27:11] certain way approaching the sanctuary a
[2:27:13] certain way approaching even the zoom
[2:27:15] prayer meeting is not a casual thing

[2:27:35] approaching it as a priest are you
[2:27:37] seeing the sanctity of it the importance
[2:27:39] of it the fact that sacrifice is being
[2:27:40] prepared and laid on the Altar and we're
[2:27:43] looking for God to accept this Sacrifice
[2:27:44] by sending fire upon it how are you
[2:27:47] doing your part with reverence with
[2:27:48] respect with dedication recognizing that
[2:27:50] the Deacon the Usher the Elder the
[2:27:52] musician the technician the all pieces
[2:27:54] of this this this this whole puzzle that
[2:27:57] comes together in order Elijah had to
[2:27:59] establish the altar in order everything
[2:28:02] had to be in its
[2:28:04] place I challenge you get in order this
[2:28:08] is not a rebuke this is just a reminder
[2:28:10] because Elijah stood there in front of
[2:28:11] the people say come closer I want you to
[2:28:14] see how to put the thing in order I want
[2:28:17] to see these stones that have been here
[2:28:19] all along put back into their place each
[2:28:22] Stone representing a tribe and we are
[2:28:24] cut out in this Stone pyramid with faith
[2:28:27] all the way to charity every stone have
[2:28:29] to be in its place forgiveness have to
[2:28:31] be in its place knowledge have to be in
[2:28:33] its place charity have to come to seal
[2:28:35] the whole
[2:28:36] thing and Jesus himself in speaking of
[2:28:39] altar he say when you come to the altar
[2:28:40] if you have a against somebody go and
[2:28:42] make it right before I come and try to
[2:28:45] lat at the altar because I can't I can't
[2:28:47] accept your sacrifice
[2:28:50] if you have alt against your brother you
[2:28:53] have alt against your sister it cuts off
[2:28:55] God's ability to work on the altar the
[2:28:57] altar is there the sacrifice is there
[2:28:59] you are priest but that ought puts a
[2:29:02] hindrance between God's ability to land
[2:29:04] and come to you at the altar so you're
[2:29:06] there at the altar it looks as if you're
[2:29:08] doing what you're supposed to do but
[2:29:09] that art is standing as a red flag a
[2:29:12] stop sign saying Lord don't come yet to
[2:29:14] know he say go get it right so I
[2:29:17] challenge you church if there's
[2:29:18] something to make right and friends for
[2:29:21] as long as we here on this Earth
[2:29:22] there'll be things to make us to make
[2:29:23] right because God wants to Humble us he
[2:29:26] wants to train us he would allow people
[2:29:28] to mistreat use or even misinterpret
[2:29:31] your goodness your kind whatever it is
[2:29:33] not just to just to make sure you
[2:29:35] understand he is God
[2:29:37] know to break our own self-righteousness
[2:29:40] to to create this because the moment we
[2:29:43] lose the Reliance and God and the
[2:29:45] sanctity of the sacredness of God having
[2:29:48] the right and the sovereign to accept
[2:29:51] the sacrifice because we cannot approach
[2:29:53] the sacrifice if God have to accept it
[2:29:56] Hallelujah we come meekly we come humbly
[2:29:58] we come with our right approach say Lord
[2:30:00] this is this is what I have I bring my
[2:30:02] worship I bring my offering I bring my
[2:30:03] tithes I bring my singing I bring you
[2:30:05] can't come here with a bad attitude I
[2:30:07] don't care what happened home leave it
[2:30:09] at the
[2:30:12] door how could you offer your anger to
[2:30:15] God you know how much worries and cares
[2:30:18] we all have you know much stresses we
[2:30:19] have to deal with but we need to drop it
[2:30:21] all aside because we come into the
[2:30:24] altar how I feel what I want my ambition
[2:30:27] my dream that have to die because we
[2:30:29] going to the altar when Isaiah came to
[2:30:31] the presence of God as he get closer and
[2:30:34] closer he start to realize more things
[2:30:36] about himself he never saw before until
[2:30:38] he came into presence and when he came
[2:30:40] into presence and the Cheri him there
[2:30:41] the Sarah there and God himself he said
[2:30:43] Lord who is
[2:30:45] me and a prophet of God say I am a man
[2:30:48] of unclean lips
[2:30:50] take the coals cleanse my lips here I am
[2:30:54] I Want My Sacrifice to be accepted I
[2:30:56] want my praise I want my prayer to be
[2:31:00] accepted
[2:31:02] friends we're going to win this war God
[2:31:05] will have true priests he will have true
[2:31:08] altars he will have true sacrifices may
