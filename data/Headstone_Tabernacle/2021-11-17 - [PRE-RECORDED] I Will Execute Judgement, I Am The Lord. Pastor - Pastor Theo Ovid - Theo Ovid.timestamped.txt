[21:51] amen you may be seated praise god
[22:00] it's always good to be
[22:02] in the house of the lord
[22:05] it's always good to be where you could
[22:07] come to hear
[22:08] from god and if you change your mindset
[22:11] instead of coming to church you're
[22:13] coming to hear from god
[22:14] you would listen and you would receive
[22:17] direct from god
[22:19] so this morning
[22:21] our title
[22:22] uh
[22:23] i will execute judgment i am the lord
[22:27] took that from the scripture
[22:30] i will execute judgment
[22:32] i am the lord
[22:34] subject
[22:35] the token
[22:36] has to be displayed
[22:39] inspiration
[22:41] no free pass
[22:43] no shortcuts
[22:45] god's requirement
[22:48] must be met
[22:49] i want to read it again no free pass
[22:53] no shortcuts
[22:55] god requirement
[22:57] must be met
[22:58] the even time message is to apply
[23:01] the token
[23:02] so you want to go straight in the word
[23:04] are you ready
[23:06] just to come here to receive and to heal
[23:08] and to be edified and to be strengthened
[23:10] and to be built up
[23:12] amen we not come here to entertain you
[23:14] we come here because we believe that we
[23:16] have something to say to you from the
[23:18] lord amen
[23:19] i just backtrack a little bit from last
[23:21] week you come like adam like me whatever
[23:23] i'm speaking you become from attribute
[23:25] to flesh
[23:27] to be tempted
[23:28] but when this life is finished here if
[23:31] our earthly nam tamnaka be dissolved we
[23:34] have won already waiting
[23:36] now we don't have no permanent thing on
[23:37] this life here you know we only have a
[23:39] time slot whether it's the 70 80 90 100
[23:43] that's all
[23:44] we have to leave here
[23:46] this flesh have to give up one day
[23:48] he told the man in the beginning dusto
[23:50] at the doctor shall return
[23:52] because he came from thus
[23:54] the first man was not the man the first
[23:56] man was the spirit man
[23:58] that was the first created image
[24:00] the first image wasn't dust man god make
[24:03] dust man and put spirit man in this man
[24:06] but the first created image was spirit
[24:07] man so you are not just flesh flesh you
[24:10] have to blow away the flesh no you were
[24:12] spirit man first
[24:14] and you have to come back to that where
[24:16] god can empower you in your spirit
[24:19] in your heart
[24:20] that you wouldn't walk after the flesh
[24:22] but you would walk after the spirit
[24:24] because the flesh has a law and the
[24:26] spirit have a law
[24:28] and if it yields in the law of the flesh
[24:30] you will do the things of the flesh but
[24:32] if you heal the law of the spirit you
[24:34] will do the thing of the spirit
[24:35] you come here to get empowered
[24:38] in your spirit
[24:40] all glory to god
[24:41] you ain't coming to anoint the flesh man
[24:44] you're committing on the spirit man
[24:46] because you're more than meet the eye
[24:48] you're more than flesh and blood
[24:50] there is something beyond your flesh
[24:52] there is something inside your soul
[24:55] that's what the word come to address
[24:58] oh glory to god amen
[25:01] hallelujah
[25:02] hallelujah
[25:04] so we have never we listen we have never
[25:06] become the word we just become flesh man
[25:10] not the word because we come from taught
[25:12] the flesh so you walking on the earth
[25:14] you're not ordinary you come from
[25:16] thought to the flesh who could reveal
[25:18] that ghost in a prophet to reveal that
[25:20] we take for granted but that's a
[25:22] revelation
[25:23] that you was in the attribute mind of
[25:25] god
[25:26] you can be lost if you try
[25:28] praise god you come from god you're
[25:30] going back to god
[25:32] don't let the devil tie you up he was
[25:34] not there before the beginning he is not
[25:36] part of the attribute that was in god's
[25:39] mind he was created in the beginning
[25:41] with the rest of the angels when god
[25:43] created angels
[25:45] but you'd
[25:52] you may be seated
[25:54] but you see
[25:55] in order to stand temptation
[25:59] you have to bypass your teopony
[26:02] you have to come down here in the flesh
[26:04] to be tempted by sin
[26:06] so if you didn't bypass your theophany
[26:08] then you couldn't be kept you couldn't
[26:10] rethink that heal the sin whatsoever but
[26:12] god
[26:13] should have fall make you skip the word
[26:16] part
[26:17] but because you are the thought part
[26:19] of words that thought expressed
[26:21] that means the thought has to come to
[26:23] expression before you speak you have to
[26:26] think it so god was thinking about you
[26:29] and he put the thought in flesh
[26:31] and you was in county valley it wasn't
[26:32] dance it wasn't party he was in fact it
[26:35] was industrial but that just stopped the
[26:36] thought inside of there
[26:38] when time comes from that lord peter
[26:40] come
[26:41] and you come
[26:42] so you are paul
[26:44] come on now change my name
[26:46] that's what we talking about
[26:48] you are not you you are who god say you
[26:51] are
[26:52] my god my god
[26:55] listen but the man said you are the
[26:57] physical manifestation of the attribute
[27:00] that you are in god
[27:08] so in order to stand temptation you
[27:10] ought to bypass your theophany or your
[27:12] word body or your expression you have to
[27:14] come long in flesh
[27:16] to be tempted by sin
[27:18] and if you stand all the father of god
[27:21] will come
[27:22] so it went on to say further we track it
[27:24] last week that here is where you're
[27:27] formed in the word image
[27:28] and we said you are formed by what you
[27:30] go through
[27:32] that's what shapes you like we like to
[27:34] say this is a building here it was built
[27:36] but before it was a building it was con
[27:38] it was cement it was gravel it was
[27:41] bricks but it had to be formed
[27:43] into a building a man can have
[27:45] galvanized wall material that's not a
[27:47] building that's material
[27:49] where the material has to be built
[27:51] and that's the building
[27:53] well faith virtually is material
[27:56] all these things in the book is material
[28:02] that's why you're going to have to have
[28:03] a fightful ministry
[28:04] to put together the material
[28:07] because you are to be perfected
[28:09] faith
[28:10] faith
[28:12] knowledge
[28:13] temperance
[28:14] patience cognitive dc have to come into
[28:17] you
[28:18] it actually have to live in you
[28:21] [Applause]
[28:25] if jesus could live it you can live it
[28:28] because he was the first one
[28:32] first fruit of the resurrection
[28:35] first one
[28:37] manifested son of god
[28:38] [Music]
[28:41] he died listen listen to bring other
[28:44] sons
[28:47] yet die you just say jesus save me save
[28:50] me save me and i'm saved that is fine
[28:53] save in your heart right
[28:54] but we're not talking about saving your
[28:56] heart we talk about the display of the
[28:58] token
[28:59] [Music]
[29:00] what you have on the inside have to come
[29:02] out on the outside it has to be
[29:04] displayed
[29:05] because you say when i see the blood
[29:08] you can have the lamb the lamb inside
[29:09] the blood inside the lamb
[29:11] if you keep the lamb i know the blood
[29:12] because i have a whole lamb here lord
[29:14] look all the blood inside of it
[29:16] do you want to see blood inside lamb he
[29:18] said kill the lamb
[29:19] get the right kind of lamb
[29:22] hallelujah first
[29:24] are you with me
[29:25] then take that blood
[29:27] and put it on the doorpost
[29:29] two side posts on top

[31:11] hallelujah hallelujah i got on the
[31:13] elijah's garment
[31:14] i'm going out tomorrow to castle
[31:16] hallelujah praise god they want
[31:19] the shortcut
[31:21] to heaven
[31:22] taking as much of the world
[31:25] as they can take
[31:27] you can't
[31:29] take
[31:30] any of it there are no shortcuts
[31:34] you come the way of calvary
[31:37] you come the way of the brass altar
[31:39] you come the way of the brazen serpent
[31:42] you die
[31:43] you actually die
[31:45] you literally die to yourself
[31:49] and die to the kings of the world and be
[31:51] born anew
[31:53] and the world is dead
[31:55] there are no shortcuts because they want
[31:58] to come right quick they don't want to
[32:00] grow we grow in the lord
[32:04] that's how when patients hit your good
[32:06] you have to be patient with the lord and
[32:08] be patient with yourself
[32:11] because if you're not patient with
[32:12] yourself you'll get enticed by some fast
[32:15] food spirit
[32:17] that tells you this shortcut will get
[32:18] you where you're going real fast you
[32:20] don't need that you need to grow in god
[32:23] you see when we say we want to get
[32:25] closer to god what we are actually
[32:27] saying i want to grow in god
[32:30] so you grow from faith to virtue you're
[32:32] still growing the knowledge you're still
[32:34] going temperance you're getting closer
[32:36] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[32:38] and you break into the spirit you can't
[32:40] get closer than that after that i am my
[32:42] father
[32:44] and one
[32:47] you ain't getting closer no more
[32:49] you're one with the father now when you
[32:50] see me you see the father
[32:52] you've got the father start to ooze out
[32:53] now
[32:54] he's the immediate virtue power started
[32:57] leaked out from your being
[32:59] oh glory to god that is what the
[33:01] disciples had
[33:03] they had power
[33:04] resident power permanent power

[33:14] weak
[33:15] you want permanent power
[33:17] watch watch watch to represent the

[33:34] of

[34:14] way although hustling all who figured
[34:16] they'd front all afraid to have more
[34:18] revelation than anybody else and they
[34:20] had the man in the hole and this is the
[34:21] own all kind of thing of the hour all of
[34:23] them falling one by one other side of

[40:08] oh my hallelujah praise god
[40:11] remember remember remember but iran gave
[40:13] this story about the wedding
[40:15] and in those days the wedding the person
[40:17] who have the marriage and so on they
[40:19] provide the garment
[40:21] every so that man had to have garments
[40:23] he had 500 people gotta get fired up by
[40:24] the garment because everybody has to
[40:26] look the same
[40:27] and they get the garment at the door
[40:29] that means you have an invitation you
[40:30] present invitation you get your garment
[40:32] you have no invitation you have no
[40:33] garment to get and this man was found
[40:36] inside without the garment
[40:38] and when the king came and said friend
[40:40] he said no email
[40:41] hey
[40:42] are you dressed like that
[40:45] are you looking so different
[40:47] oh you're looking so early
[40:49] who are you oh you're not looking like
[40:50] all the rest of brethren i thought
[40:52] there's one faith one lord one baptism
[40:55] one fire one worship i thought i thought
[40:57] was what i thought was one
[40:59] you're supposed to be looking one you
[41:01] see when they have the one garment you
[41:02] don't know who richard and lupo
[41:06] you don't know who have you don't know
[41:07] who i have
[41:09] hallelujah and that's what the holy
[41:11] ghost make us and make us humble it make
[41:13] us one i don't care if you have one
[41:16] dress and somebody have ten dresses you
[41:19] are still one in christ
[41:21] isn't that right
[41:23] what did the man say pass them out
[41:26] hand them foot
[41:27] they shall be weeping and wearing a
[41:28] national teeth because of what barbara
[41:30] says he didn't come to the door
[41:32] that when he slipped through the window
[41:33] it was open
[41:34] and you take a chance and
[41:37] take a short cut
[41:38] what he should have done was kept the
[41:40] garment and then jumped through the
[41:41] window
[41:42] the only problem is the garment is on
[41:44] the front door
[41:45] so he couldn't get the gum he couldn't
[41:46] snatch one so you end up saying boy like
[41:48] an open boy nobody there no deacon
[41:51] no police
[41:52] go boy go something go for it go for it
[41:57] no dog master come out here so eating
[41:58] everybody else
[42:00] glasses sharing drinking like nobody
[42:01] else
[42:02] nobody bothered with that you know
[42:04] because he gonna be a silver and he
[42:05] could be anybody they don't know who he
[42:06] is
[42:07] there's many guests they have there
[42:09] is a man come out knowing all my guests
[42:11] supposed to have red orange yellow
[42:15] green indigo violet all my guests
[42:18] supposed to have seven colors
[42:20] oh my guess i'm looking for those seven
[42:22] colors how come that man don't have
[42:24] those colors
[42:26] out eagles
[42:28] no shortcuts
[42:29] not either start he that finishes many
[42:32] start the race but there is one finish
[42:34] in it there will be many churches start
[42:37] many groups of people but it'll be one
[42:39] group finish that's the overcomers
[42:42] and then he went on to define the
[42:44] overcomers not a group per se but
[42:47] individuals
[42:48] it's not to them that overcome it or the
[42:50] church body is he that overcome it so
[42:53] that group will be made up of
[42:54] individuals who are overcomers
[42:57] do you see yourself as an overcomer you
[42:59] have to begin to see yourself as
[43:00] overcomer you are going to take charge
[43:02] of your life
[43:04] oh glory to god and don't be a driftwood
[43:06] and let the stream of light just drift
[43:09] you along
[43:10] oh hallelujah praise god isn't that
[43:13] right
[43:14] thank you lord jesus okay here we go
[43:17] so israel was to gather together
[43:20] to apply the token
[43:23] because it was exodus
[43:25] you hear what i say
[43:27] it was leaving time
[43:29] and before you leave
[43:31] it have blood to apply
[43:33] because god going to execute judgment
[43:35] hallelujah against the world and the
[43:38] world system against egypt
[43:41] so god couldn't judge his people
[43:43] along with the egyptians he had to make
[43:45] a provision for them
[43:47] a way of escape
[43:48] and he bring that provision through the
[43:50] lamb
[43:51] which had the blood
[43:53] so you give instructions a family a
[43:55] house a lamb for a house
[43:58] if your house so too small join with
[43:59] somebody else
[44:00] but make sure everybody on the inside
[44:03] on the outside must be blood
[44:05] and i would recognize that blood
[44:07] as a token
[44:09] that i can touch
[44:10] once that bird is there
[44:12] i don't care who is under
[44:14] nothing can happen
[44:16] once they're under that blood
[44:18] hallelujah i don't care who it is jargon
[44:23] pull them in
[44:24] bed them in put them on your shoulder
[44:27] and walk them in
[44:29] get them in anyhow
[44:31] but get them under the blood
[44:33] because when i see the blood i'm going
[44:35] to pass over you
[44:37] if i don't see the blood i'm going to
[44:39] pass through
[44:40] i will execute judgment
[44:42] i am the lord
[44:44] oh give the lord some praises
[44:46] hallelujah
[44:48] so they came out to get together
[44:51] to apply the token
[44:53] and they had to have faith
[44:55] in that token that under that blood
[44:58] sacrifice that they would be under
[45:00] exodus out of egypt
[45:01] that was the second exodus and we are
[45:04] promised a third exodus the first exodus
[45:06] was a natural land into a natural land
[45:09] second a second after the exodus was a
[45:11] natural land into a spiritual baptism in
[45:14] the upper room but this exodus is from a
[45:16] spiritual baptism into the land of the
[45:18] millennium we are leaving here
[45:21] it's a rapture train to get you'd have a
[45:23] raptor express to pick up with
[45:25] oh glory to god amen
[45:28] hallelujah
[45:29] so the token
[45:31] was their sign
[45:32] of what god was going to do for them
[45:34] he was taking them up
[45:36] out of egypt oh praise god so the token
[45:39] what's a token a token is a sign
[45:42] that the price has been paid
[45:44] so when they go to get the bus
[45:46] ticket you don't have the driver the
[45:47] money you pay for the ticket
[45:50] and the driver takes the ticket
[45:52] the ticket is the token
[45:54] and that's i'm saying it now your car go
[45:57] and take that ticket and drive on a taxi
[45:59] and say listen taxi look look the ticket
[46:01] taxi will say wrong person
[46:04] wrong place we don't take those tickets
[46:07] you have to go to the bus
[46:09] isn't that right so that talking only we
[46:11] can sit in place
[46:13] so when god say that token he means that
[46:15] you have to get that token
[46:17] and when you get that talking to driver
[46:18] cardinal that's your right
[46:21] to board
[46:23] when the driver see that guys are not
[46:24] taking you this is my right
[46:27] this is paid for you have to take me on
[46:29] board i see merced already okay give the
[46:32] law some praises people
[46:34] that give you the right
[46:36] hallelujah you cannot be denied
[46:39] because you are paid a price
[46:44] it must be the blood so god made a token
[46:47] give it to israel no other token will
[46:49] work
[46:50] it cannot be recognized and you cannot
[46:52] have the token until the fair speed and
[46:55] then you are possessor of the token
[46:57] which give you the privilege of a free
[46:59] pass
[47:02] oh
[47:03] hallelujah what give you the free pass
[47:05] now
[47:06] the token so when you're passing just
[47:07] show your token
[47:09] they have to let you pass no talking you
[47:11] have to stop
[47:12] go and pay the price doesn't that sound
[47:15] familiar
[47:16] wise versions foolish versions
[47:19] hallelujah the first the white the
[47:20] foolish version had all you know but
[47:22] they all ran out
[47:23] the wise version of extra oil they
[47:26] wasn't taking no chances they wasn't
[47:28] wasting time in church killing a huge
[47:30] pew they want to receive and give extra
[47:33] they want to take in the word because
[47:35] the spirit prays god will only produce
[47:37] what the world has in it
[47:39] so the why is that extra oil and then
[47:42] when at midnight bridegroom behold the
[47:44] brandon come here go y'all to meet him
[47:46] he said my god give us some of your oil
[47:48] of course brotherly kindness
[47:51] [Applause]
[47:53] hold no oats now
[47:56] forgive me forgive me but i want some
[47:58] oil
[47:59] i have a diamond scene for everything

[1:00:05] amen before judgment
[1:00:10] the blood means you are
[1:00:13] you see before it actually happened the

[1:01:20] don't let god shut the door
[1:01:23] coming now
[1:01:25] coming when you have time
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:34] they were supposed to come in the act

[1:01:39] the animals are going to shoot they
[1:01:40] gotta go with the animals too they
[1:01:41] wanted
[1:01:42] they want to go in for my prayer line
[1:01:43] are the animals going to
[1:01:45] oh glory to god but somebody's going to
[1:01:47] be saving that act

[1:01:53] be delivered it can't be everybody and
[1:01:54] that's all moxie condition

[1:11:52] oh glory to god
[1:11:54] remember you may be seated when them
[1:11:56] seven angels come from eternity
[1:11:59] my god the god asks the prophet

[1:12:02] way

[1:12:08] wig
[1:12:09] the wig is the wig of a judge
[1:12:11] so the judge is already here
[1:12:16] you heard what i said
[1:12:18] you heard what i said
[1:12:19] first thessalonians 4
[1:12:21] the lord himself
[1:12:23] the judge
[1:12:24] descends with a shout he will execute
[1:12:27] judgment
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:12:35] playing time over
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:43] version 10 i saw another mighty angel
[1:12:46] come down from heaven with a book open
[1:12:49] that book
[1:12:51] flip to daniel
[1:12:52] and the books were open
[1:12:56] there's a book
[1:12:57] their books
[1:12:58] names
[1:13:00] church members
[1:13:01] that will receive eternal life at the
[1:13:03] white throne
[1:13:04] but the elected is in that book
[1:13:06] where seven thunders
[1:13:08] utter the voices
[1:13:10] to catch who the elect
[1:13:12] ninety percent of the ministers we
[1:13:13] checked the thunders
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:16] and but around preached it
[1:13:18] he says seven tunnels will cover the
[1:13:20] bride that's what he said
[1:13:22] seven ton getting my faith to leave here
[1:13:25] that's what he said seven terminal bad
[1:13:27] revival that's what he said and he
[1:13:29] rejected it
[1:13:34] they will pay for that
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:37] they will pay for that rejection
[1:13:39] because what they don't understand but
[1:13:41] one says if this be so
[1:13:43] then
[1:13:44] faith is in virtue all these things then
[1:13:46] the pyramid is kept
[1:13:48] by the seven thunders so the seventh
[1:13:50] thunder is the stone
[1:13:53] the builders refuse
[1:13:55] there is nothing left for judgment
[1:13:58] hallelujah
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:01] praise god
[1:14:02] therefore the seven thunders is the
[1:14:04] fullness
[1:14:05] of the atonement
[1:14:07] and that is what the church may reject
[1:14:10] oh glory to god
[1:14:12] the bride's going to make it because the
[1:14:14] bride becomes the word
[1:14:16] she accepts the fullness
[1:14:18] of the atonement
[1:14:20] fullness of the blood
[1:14:22] which is the token itself
[1:14:25] literal life of jesus christ
[1:14:27] i want nothing less
[1:14:29] than the literal life of jesus christ
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:36] i don't want to be a nice master nice
[1:14:38] minister i am not in that
[1:14:40] or glory to god i want a literal life
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:46] that's my promise
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:55] look look
[1:14:56] look this bum
[1:14:58] before it happens
[1:14:59] for there is coming a time when you will
[1:15:02] not be able to have any blood applied
[1:15:07] the blood was applied in the evening
[1:15:09] time the token never come into existence
[1:15:12] until the even time
[1:15:14] luther didn't have no talking
[1:15:18] the talking come in the evening time
[1:15:20] with the evening time message listen but
[1:15:23] this is the even time of the age we live
[1:15:24] in
[1:15:25] this is even time for the church this is
[1:15:27] even time for me this is the evening
[1:15:29] time of my message i am dying i am going
[1:15:32] i'm moving out we have come to
[1:15:34] justification but this is the time that
[1:15:36] the token has to be applied
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:39] the time when you can't play with it
[1:15:42] it's got to be done
[1:15:44] god's requirement must be met
[1:15:47] that's what i'm telling you don't look
[1:15:48] what anybody else does
[1:15:50] i don't care who do what you want the
[1:15:52] clip to hear who want to do this want
[1:15:54] the whiskers who want to wear pants we
[1:15:55] want to do this do what's that
[1:15:57] watch what god said in this world
[1:15:59] you
[1:16:00] apply the blood
[1:16:02] listen friends it's not a touch of fear
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:08] it's not a church of fear
[1:16:10] the bible doesn't say there'll be two
[1:16:11] churches one taking one left
[1:16:13] no two in the field
[1:16:15] two in a bed
[1:16:17] two there's two that one take and one
[1:16:19] layer
[1:16:20] it's the individual
[1:16:22] [Applause]
[1:16:27] why the animal
[1:16:28] christ didn't come yet
[1:16:30] he was the realm of god
[1:16:32] and the animal life couldn't come upon a
[1:16:33] human being
[1:16:34] when the blood left left the animal the
[1:16:37] life was gone from it it was a different
[1:16:38] life from the blood so the blood so god
[1:16:40] god accepted the chemistry of the blood
[1:16:43] that red physical thing that is what he
[1:16:45] accepted
[1:16:46] because the life of the animal couldn't
[1:16:48] come back
[1:16:49] but jesus
[1:16:51] he had a living soul
[1:16:53] in that right so when he died
[1:16:56] his soul
[1:16:57] his spirit could be released
[1:16:59] and come back
[1:17:01] upon the worshiper
[1:17:02] who identify with christ
[1:17:04] at calvary that's how you become born
[1:17:06] again because his spirit released to
[1:17:10] break into your spirit that's why he can
[1:17:12] offer you a new heart i will give you a
[1:17:15] new spirit i will give you and i'll put
[1:17:17] my spirit in your spirit
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:23] that's what he said
[1:17:25] could be giving us some praises
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] in this covenant today
[1:17:34] there's a difference between the blood
[1:17:35] and the life
[1:17:36] the token
[1:17:38] for the believer today
[1:17:39] is the holy ghost
[1:17:41] that's the token
[1:17:43] is the holy ghost
[1:17:44] not blood
[1:17:46] chemistry but the holy spirit of god
[1:17:49] that is the token that god requires of
[1:17:52] the church today god must see this token
[1:17:56] he must see it in every one of us
[1:17:59] oh glory to god he must see it in every
[1:18:01] one of us so i want you to get a burden
[1:18:04] for the token
[1:18:06] a burden
[1:18:07] for the holy ghost a burden to get your
[1:18:09] breakthrough you've got to get a burden
[1:18:11] here
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:15] therefore as the evil shadows appearing
[1:18:17] the rat is ready
[1:18:18] to reported from on high
[1:18:20] upon ungodlinations upon ungodly
[1:18:23] unbelievers upon listen professors
[1:18:26] without a possession
[1:18:30] so god don't want to be a professor
[1:18:32] without a possession
[1:18:35] go tell them there's a line from here to
[1:18:36] there to the other day all these years

[1:28:28] doctor is the expert
[1:28:31] sometimes when you're finished doctor
[1:28:32] virginia said oh god i went through all
[1:28:34] that pressure boy i gotta get that thing

[1:28:53] we come with a needle this morning
[1:28:58] oh
[1:28:58] my hallelujah
[1:29:01] but i'm saying i've tried to unfold
[1:29:03] myself and live right among it to see
[1:29:05] where it's standing
[1:29:06] before i said these things no we are
[1:29:08] living in the shadows and the rat is
[1:29:10] ready to strike
[1:29:12] god listen i just see that right there
[1:29:13] you strike
[1:29:14] congress they're trying to work on a law
[1:29:17] to see if they could hold back they
[1:29:19] don't know
[1:29:20] from launching a nuclear thing joshua
[1:29:23] and this morning a general say he will
[1:29:25] not respond to any unlawful nuclear
[1:29:27] attack request
[1:29:29] because they know how he thinks a little
[1:29:31] quickly already
[1:29:33] he may press something up he doesn't
[1:29:34] suppose to press
[1:29:35] so they're trying to check him
[1:29:37] because baron said take one little crazy
[1:29:39] guy to do it
[1:29:40] it'd have to cast it toward him but that
[1:29:43] one show can jump on and have another
[1:29:45] one soon
[1:29:46] so you see we don't know who oppressed
[1:29:47] what
[1:29:48] but all we know we wanted we was in
[1:29:50] dangerous times no you better wonder how
[1:29:53] it will come could get up there but the
[1:29:56] reality is whether thomas is up there
[1:29:58] it's what he will press
[1:30:00] oh hallelujah praise god

[1:30:05] to be in
[1:30:07] oh hallelujah a man that could say what
[1:30:09] he wants when he want how he won any
[1:30:11] time he won and he keep going down the
[1:30:13] road taking more land
[1:30:14] the second warrior oh yes because you
[1:30:17] see the whole tone of america has to
[1:30:18] change to begin the forcing so
[1:30:21] afterwards it becomes natural that's how
[1:30:22] he is that how it is and the underneath
[1:30:24] is law's changing laws changing and
[1:30:26] before they know it they are trapped
[1:30:30] and the b system has been re-established
[1:30:33] whereas they were they were born out of
[1:30:35] being the land of the brave and the free
[1:30:37] fighting for freedom that's america
[1:30:40] that's what religion titan is all about
[1:30:42] that's how it was born like a lamb but
[1:30:44] then afterwards put like a dragon
[1:30:46] enter the dragon oh my lord
[1:30:49] hallelujah
[1:30:50] and in the meantime why the devil

[1:43:48] no no no i want to run the race
[1:43:49] correctly
[1:43:51] i want to say like paul i run a race i

[1:43:56] i fought a good fight
[1:43:58] i fought a good fight
[1:44:00] kept the faith
[1:44:03] i'm speaking to you this morning
[1:44:10] i am not responsible for any other
[1:44:11] church in our group
[1:44:13] this is who i'm after come for this
[1:44:15] group here
[1:44:16] so i don't mind nobody business as you
[1:44:18] realize
[1:44:19] another no church business don't worry
[1:44:20] business what did this one do now as a
[1:44:21] business
[1:44:22] i know i'm saying for that i have to do
[1:44:24] here
[1:44:25] but i make some promises what we see
[1:44:27] should make a church that will make a
[1:44:29] revival he said that
[1:44:31] what we see should make a church i want
[1:44:33] to be part of that revival
[1:44:35] i don't wait and do what you're waiting
[1:44:36] for revival to jump into it there's some
[1:44:38] people they're not part of the work
[1:44:39] they're not part of their labor they're
[1:44:41] not part of the person or the person
[1:44:42] they want to part for the ride when the
[1:44:44] wheels turn in they jump on for the ride
[1:44:51] you'll get caught with that you know by
[1:44:53] the foolish version
[1:44:55] because you're thinking you'll get
[1:44:55] extraordinary brother nice
[1:44:58] your brother have revelation
[1:44:59] he's nice enough to tell you go and buy
[1:45:01] because what i have i have full of
[1:45:03] myself
[1:45:04] my gas tank full another extra there's a
[1:45:06] distance out of the way the other smokes
[1:45:07] and smokey double face and i start
[1:45:09] plenty gas for the burn while i'm
[1:45:10] smoking them out
[1:45:12] on my way out
[1:45:17] so i can't share my oil with you go and
[1:45:20] get for yourself and the oil is the word
[1:45:22] really so you see i receive the word
[1:45:24] because the word turns the oil
[1:45:25] so you have to come to get the word
[1:45:28] that you can benefit from the word the
[1:45:30] bible said many the word wasn't mixed
[1:45:32] with faith so it didn't profit them the
[1:45:34] wasting time coming to church
[1:45:37] that's why we don't drag nobody inside
[1:45:39] of here
[1:45:39] i don't pump and you should know me by
[1:45:41] now i don't do that
[1:45:43] you pull a goat they pull a cow they
[1:45:45] pull a bull and you had to tie them feed
[1:45:48] them

[1:45:50] horns trimmed the horns and saw their
[1:45:53] own

[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:45:59] you have better groups to go to go go
[1:46:03] but if you want a revival you want to
[1:46:05] put you you want a hungering and
[1:46:07] twisting you want the five god upon your
[1:46:09] soul oh glory to god you're in the right
[1:46:11] place but this is what we're preaching

[1:46:22] life but all you're looking for he's in
[1:46:24] life i want to persecute my life i want

[1:50:44] and those words went through dimensions
[1:50:49] every year
[1:50:50] every minute souls
[1:50:52] flying over here
[1:50:54] souls people dying their swords going
[1:50:56] going going

[1:51:14] if he didn't call lazarus by name
[1:51:17] everybody was coming out
[1:51:21] everybody was coming out
[1:51:23] therefore you have a name
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:30] nobody to take
[1:51:33] your name oh give the lord a shout
[1:51:36] nobody can represent you
[1:51:39] nobody can take your blessing
[1:51:42] nobody can take your anointing
[1:51:45] what god have for you is for you
[1:51:49] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:07] hallelujah
[1:52:09] glory to god amen
[1:52:11] so the token is the life that the blood
[1:52:13] worship is upon you you are safe from
[1:52:15] rat that's alone not membership
[1:52:18] the life of christ has to come into you
[1:52:20] which is the holy ghost god's token
[1:52:22] that you have accepted the blood of his
[1:52:24] son jesus christ therefore when it is
[1:52:26] these are wesley luther taught it was to
[1:52:28] believe and there's obviously the
[1:52:30] chemistry of the blood but this is the
[1:52:32] last day where the token is required and
[1:52:35] that makes together the whole unit
[1:52:38] for the rapture
[1:52:39] water blood and spirit and sometimes i
[1:52:42] want to speak on that i'm seeing it
[1:52:44] water blood
[1:52:46] and spirit
[1:52:48] water
[1:52:49] seven seals
[1:52:50] blood
[1:52:51] seven thunders
[1:52:53] spirit dynamics
[1:52:55] to the mechanics
[1:52:57] oh hallelujah brown quality water age
[1:52:59] the blood age and now the total age of
[1:53:03] the holy ghost
[1:53:04] israel knows someone was coming so did
[1:53:06] luther wesley finney knox calvin all
[1:53:08] them knew they knew there would come a
[1:53:10] time that the pillar fire would return
[1:53:12] back in the church
[1:53:14] this was the prophecy of alpha and omega
[1:53:16] same fire that was in the early church
[1:53:18] come back in the last church oh glory to
[1:53:20] god we have been now in a time of
[1:53:21] lingering since the prophet left time
[1:53:23] are lingering because everything have a
[1:53:25] time and season
[1:53:26] oh hallelujah what is the pillar of
[1:53:28] hacking on the 70s
[1:53:32] oh my
[1:53:33] it's been a lamb all the way through
[1:53:35] luther's time the llama wesley time but
[1:53:37] now is the talking time that each house
[1:53:39] each house must be covered by the token
[1:53:42] each house must be covered by the token
[1:53:44] all that inside will be covered by the
[1:53:46] token and the house of god is the body
[1:53:48] of jesus christ and my one spirit we are
[1:53:49] baptized to the body now the very spirit
[1:53:52] itself is a token
[1:53:55] security imagine people call it the holy
[1:53:56] ghost
[1:53:57] so that means the token
[1:53:59] the very spirit itself is the token
[1:54:03] the holy spirit itself is the token not
[1:54:05] the blood the blood was shed at calvary
[1:54:07] that is true but the blood went back
[1:54:10] into the elements and when it's come
[1:54:12] but from the food he lived on but you
[1:54:14] see inside that blood cell was a life
[1:54:17] that is what jesus released
[1:54:20] when that soul appears inside the blood
[1:54:22] come out our spirit life was released
[1:54:24] to go through the earth
[1:54:26] every generation to pick up every
[1:54:28] elected
[1:54:30] gene taught of god
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:34] so you could be wherever the spirit had
[1:54:37] to pick up pick you up
[1:54:39] is that man pick you up
[1:54:41] it was the spirit pick you up
[1:54:43] the spirit pick up the gene thought
[1:54:46] inside of you
[1:54:50] didn't know it was there
[1:54:51] but god knew it was there
[1:54:55] now that thought
[1:54:57] could become weird
[1:55:00] do you get that
[1:55:02] if somebody wasn't backing god's mind
[1:55:04] like how they could become the word
[1:55:05] but because you're thought a word that
[1:55:07] would express you could come into an
[1:55:08] expression so regardless of where you
[1:55:10] act listen peter was a cuspard fisherman
[1:55:13] he didn't know about word and expression
[1:55:16] and supersman
[1:55:19] peter was a fisherman
[1:55:20] a fisherman
[1:55:23] jesus i'll make you fishers of men
[1:55:25] stop this fishing thing
[1:55:27] follow me
[1:55:28] and peter drop his neck
[1:55:31] crash the business
[1:55:32] to follow jesus
[1:55:36] peter still don't know what's going on
[1:55:38] jesus introduced promise to them the
[1:55:40] same works i do shut you down also if
[1:55:42] you do not say to this mountain jesus
[1:55:44] even put anointing upon them one time my
[1:55:46] brother come and say shall be called for
[1:55:47] fire like like elijah
[1:55:50] then fathers they get ideas already
[1:55:53] they don't have character yet but they
[1:55:54] want to call fire
[1:55:56] one time you see somebody cast no devils
[1:55:57] and doing some things and they not with
[1:55:59] them they get jealous
[1:56:00] and they come and say shall we stop him
[1:56:03] because this is waiting now
[1:56:06] remember jesus
[1:56:08] this this is you you and i we we
[1:56:11] just leave the man alone
[1:56:13] but i'm saying was getting horrors
[1:56:14] because that fella wasn't with them
[1:56:17] so there's a horror story just a leading
[1:56:18] man alone he said one time he said you
[1:56:20] don't know what spirit you're off
[1:56:22] next time what somebody mother come and
[1:56:23] say
[1:56:25] lord worship the lord
[1:56:27] could you put one of my sons on your
[1:56:28] left side and one of my sons on the
[1:56:30] right side
[1:56:31] well the other brothers get so hungry
[1:56:32] for that day
[1:56:33] god just wanted like an instant
[1:56:34] promotion a short cut now just just just
[1:56:36] get them you know light right and left
[1:56:38] just say i am not responsible for right
[1:56:40] and left
[1:56:41] have a cup you could drink it there's a
[1:56:42] bitter cup
[1:56:44] if they could drink it well that's fine
[1:56:45] but i am not responsible for who's
[1:56:47] sitting right who's in the left that's
[1:56:48] human
[1:56:50] everybody want to be somebody everybody
[1:56:51] wants some kind of attention some kind
[1:56:53] of way will feel this and they want a
[1:56:55] child in this and a child that and child
[1:56:56] that's human
[1:56:57] but notice when the upper room
[1:56:59] experience came
[1:57:00] all that was beaten out
[1:57:02] bouncing mary had to get old she's
[1:57:04] touched she's the mother of god she's
[1:57:05] mother jesus
[1:57:08] christ
[1:57:14] mary had to stagger like everybody else
[1:57:18] it's one baptism
[1:57:20] it's one robe it's one experience

[2:00:50] ninth house for they become to search
[2:00:51] out all our country and the woman told
[2:00:54] took the two men and hit them and said
[2:00:56] thus they came in unto me but i wish not
[2:00:58] once they were and it came to pass about
[2:01:00] the time of the shutting of the gate
[2:01:02] when it was dark the men went out
[2:01:04] whether the men went i what not pursue
[2:01:06] after them quickly for you shall
[2:01:07] overtake them and she had brought them
[2:01:09] up to the roof of the house and hid them
[2:01:12] the stalk of flick tracks which he had
[2:01:14] laid upon order upon the roof and the
[2:01:16] men pursued after them that we have
[2:01:18] jordan under the forts and as soon as

[2:01:21] going out and shut the gate and before

[2:01:24] them upon the roof she said unto the men
[2:01:26] i know that the lord had given you the
[2:01:29] land
[2:01:30] and your terror is falling upon us
[2:01:32] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[2:01:34] because of you for we have heard how the
[2:01:37] lord dried up the water of the red sea
[2:01:38] for you when you came out of egypt and
[2:01:40] what you did unto the two kings of the
[2:01:41] amorites that were on the other side of
[2:01:43] jordan seahorn and ugg whom you ought to
[2:01:45] destroy as soon as we had heard these
[2:01:47] things our heart did melt neither did
[2:01:49] there remain any more courage in any man
[2:01:51] because of you for the lord your god he
[2:01:53] is the god of heaven above and it would
[2:01:55] be neat now therefore i pray you swear
[2:01:58] unto me by the lord
[2:02:00] since i have showed you kindness that
[2:02:02] you will also show kindness under my
[2:02:04] father's house and give me a true token
[2:02:07] and that he will save alive my father my
[2:02:11] mother my brethren my sisters and all
[2:02:14] that they have and deliver our lives
[2:02:16] from debt
[2:02:17] and the men answered our life for yours
[2:02:19] if you utter not this our business and
[2:02:21] it shall be when the lord had given us
[2:02:24] the land that we will deal kindly and
[2:02:26] truly with thee
[2:02:27] then she let them down by a cord through
[2:02:30] the window for her house was upon the
[2:02:32] tongue wall and she dwelt upon the wall
[2:02:35] and she said unto them get you to the

[2:02:40] hide yourself dear three days until the
[2:02:42] pursuers be returned and afterwards you
[2:02:44] may go and the men said on her we will
[2:02:46] be blameless of the an oath which yahweh
[2:02:48] has made us swear behold when we come
[2:02:51] unto the land

[2:06:46] it has to be the token life
[2:06:49] on display
[2:06:51] i can't
[2:06:52] i'll continue next week but but what i
[2:06:54] want to say with you is this
[2:06:56] that i'll be fooling you
[2:06:58] if i tell you anything short of this
[2:07:01] that you got to meet god's requirement
[2:07:04] people like to be safe they like to know
[2:07:06] uh they have the best pastor they are
[2:07:08] the best church or whatever it is and
[2:07:10] they have the confidence to be in there
[2:07:11] and so on that's what the catholic does
[2:07:13] they have the priests usually say a long
