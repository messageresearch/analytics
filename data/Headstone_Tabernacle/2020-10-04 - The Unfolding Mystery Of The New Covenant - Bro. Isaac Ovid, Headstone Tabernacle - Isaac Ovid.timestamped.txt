[51:24] god richly bless you
[51:26] and strengthen you during this season i
[51:29] certainly want to salute
[51:31] our precious pastor but ovid in
[51:33] particular for
[51:35] not just leadership but for the messages
[51:37] that he has
[51:38] been ministering and for every service
[51:40] and every opportunity we
[51:42] get to gather together in our different
[51:44] ways using technology
[51:46] to be able to cut through the noise as
[51:48] it were
[51:50] and to fight and to contend to be ready
[51:52] for when he comes you feel that way this
[51:54] morning
[51:55] so we thank god and i encourage you
[51:59] you know uh since most are connected
[52:02] that you make it make it a reverent
[52:05] moment
[52:06] make it a solemn moment make it a
[52:08] sincere moment don't
[52:10] approach it casually don't relax
[52:13] but let's approach it understanding that
[52:16] god is real god is here and he's not
[52:18] limited
[52:19] uh by you physically being in this room
[52:22] but he's able to meet you at the point
[52:23] of your need
[52:25] this morning so i have uh three portions
[52:28] of scripture
[52:29] that i'd like to go to this morning
[52:31] reading the book of psalms
[52:33] reading from the book of hebrews and
[52:35] reading from
[52:36] peter the lord helped us this morning a
[52:39] little encouragement
[52:40] to the church this morning to encourage
[52:43] you along your journey
[52:45] as you contend for the fate and
[52:48] you go through this process of character
[52:51] development
[52:52] through the trials and the testings and
[52:54] we are here to remind you this morning
[52:56] of the promises of god amen
[52:59] so reading from psalms 105 and reading
[53:02] from verse 8
[53:04] he hath remembered his covenant forever
[53:07] that's powerful he had remembered his
[53:10] covenant
[53:11] forever the word which he commanded to a
[53:14] thousand generations
[53:16] that alone is a powerful scripture which
[53:18] covenant he made with abraham and his
[53:21] oath
[53:21] unto abe unto isaac and confirmed the
[53:24] same
[53:25] unto jacob for allah and to israel for
[53:28] an
[53:28] everlasting covenant saying unto thee
[53:32] will i give the land of canaan the lot
[53:34] of your inheritance
[53:36] when they were but a few in number yey
[53:39] very few
[53:40] and strangers in it when they went from
[53:43] one nation to another
[53:44] from one kingdom to another people he
[53:47] suffered no man to do them wrong yeah
[53:49] he reproved kings for their sakes
[53:53] saying touch not mine anointed and do my
[53:56] prophets no harm
[53:58] and reading hebrews 13 and reading verse
[54:01] 20
[54:03] now the god of peace that brought again
[54:06] from the dead our lord jesus
[54:08] that great shepherd of the sheep through
[54:10] the blood of the everlasting covenant
[54:13] make you perfect in every good work to
[54:17] do his will
[54:19] working in you that which is pleasing in
[54:21] his sight
[54:22] through jesus christ to whom be glory
[54:25] forever
[54:26] and ever amen and reading first
[54:29] peter two and reading verse nine
[54:32] we kind of touched a little bit on this
[54:34] in our bible study but ye
[54:36] are a chosen generation a royal
[54:39] priesthood
[54:40] and a holy nation a peculiar people that
[54:44] you should show for the praises of him
[54:46] who had called you out of darkness into
[54:49] his marvelous light
[54:50] which in times past were not a people
[54:53] but are now the people of god
[54:55] which had up had not obtained mercy
[54:59] but now have obtained mercy may the lord
[55:02] have a blessing to the reading of his
[55:03] word
[55:04] you may be seated this morning in the
[55:06] presence of the lord and we're so
[55:08] grateful to be able to be in fellowship
[55:11] around the word of god and
[55:13] uh we'll see what lord will do this
[55:15] morning he is in complete control
[55:17] he knows what he wants to say to us this
[55:19] morning so i have a
[55:20] title this morning the unfolding mystery
[55:24] of the new covenant the unfolding
[55:27] mystery
[55:28] of the new covenant subject i will make
[55:31] an everlasting covenant with you
[55:34] and an inspiration a chosen generation
[55:38] a royal priesthood and holy nation
[55:42] a peculiar people can the church say
[55:45] amen
[55:46] so the unfolding mystery of the new
[55:49] covenant
[55:50] by using the word unfolding we mean it's
[55:52] something else is coming out of it
[55:54] there's something that's opening up to
[55:56] us there's something being revealed to
[55:57] us
[55:58] our understanding is increasing our
[56:00] experience is
[56:02] increasing and god said i'll make an
[56:03] everlasting covenant with you this
[56:05] this covenant will have no end there'll
[56:07] be no need for another covenant
[56:09] when this everlasting covenant is in
[56:11] place when this new covenant is in place
[56:13] there'll be
[56:14] no need for another covenant he said on
[56:17] and
[56:17] and we read a scripture in peter who is
[56:19] this you he's talking about a chosen
[56:21] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[56:25] nation a peculiar people so let's
[56:28] uh get into it this morning and we know
[56:31] that god is a god of laws
[56:33] he's a god of principles he's a god of
[56:36] promises
[56:37] he's a god of judgments and by his own
[56:41] word and we know that god is objective
[56:44] worship but by his own word
[56:46] god even placed limits on himself can
[56:49] the church say amen
[56:50] so by god's own word there are certain
[56:53] things that god cannot do can the church
[56:55] say amen
[56:56] so god we know he cannot lie we know
[56:59] god cannot change we know that god
[57:01] cannot make a promise
[57:03] and fail to bring it to pass oh that is
[57:06] what makes him god
[57:07] because he is not able to make a promise
[57:09] and take it back
[57:10] but he's also a god of covenants and
[57:13] when god
[57:14] makes a covenant oh that covenant is so
[57:16] powerful
[57:17] that is an unbreakable covenant can the
[57:20] church say amen
[57:21] and we know that there's a difference
[57:23] with the old covenants
[57:25] and there was a a challenge with the old
[57:27] covenants we're gonna touch some of it
[57:29] but we understand that in the old days
[57:31] in the days of of abraham and the days
[57:33] of moses and and as you progress
[57:35] through the days before jesus came they
[57:38] lived under the old covenant
[57:40] god had covenants with many of his sons
[57:43] throughout the years
[57:44] he made a covenant with noah that i'm
[57:46] not going to do what i did
[57:48] with the flood anymore he made covenants
[57:49] with abraham he made covenants with
[57:51] moses
[57:52] he made covenants with david can the
[57:54] church say amen
[57:55] but the old covenant provided a
[57:58] sacrificial system
[58:00] because sin required debt so god knew
[58:03] that something
[58:04] had to be in place to deal with the sin
[58:06] situation because sin was automatically
[58:10] gonna lead to death so god created a
[58:13] system and place
[58:14] and under that old system under that old
[58:17] covenant
[58:18] you have to find a lamb you have to find
[58:22] something and you have to make a
[58:23] sacrifice isn't that right and that grew
[58:25] to the high priest
[58:26] having to go on the day of the atonement
[58:29] and make sacrifice for the people
[58:31] but the problem with that system was
[58:34] that
[58:34] sacrifice was only covering the problem
[58:38] it was not removing the problem so every
[58:41] single year
[58:42] you had to go back again and again the
[58:45] fact that that system
[58:46] was designed to go back again and again
[58:49] meant that the people
[58:50] were going through a cycle they were
[58:53] going through this
[58:53] up and down one minute you're on top of
[58:55] the mountain because you feel
[58:57] victory when the high priest comes out
[58:59] and say yes
[59:00] we have been redeemed from the last year
[59:03] yes
[59:04] the sins have been taken care of and now
[59:06] they go into a new year
[59:07] and god that covenant that he had in
[59:10] place
[59:11] was a temporary covenant there was a
[59:13] purpose
[59:14] for the covenant but it was a temporary
[59:16] covenant
[59:17] can the church say amen i'm just laying
[59:19] a background before i get to preach this
[59:20] morning
[59:22] so in that covenant the high priest
[59:24] would offer sacrifices
[59:26] on behalf of the people and represent
[59:29] them in the presence of god
[59:30] the blood of bulls and goats was
[59:33] temporarily
[59:34] enabling them to remain in fellowship
[59:36] with god
[59:37] the old covenant was filled with grace
[59:40] it had mercy it had long suffering but
[59:44] that had to happen over and over and we
[59:46] know
[59:47] in hebrews it is impossible for the
[59:49] blood of bulls and gods to take away the
[59:51] sin
[59:52] can the church say amen but the deeper
[59:54] issue
[59:55] with the old covenant was that the old
[59:58] covenant
[59:58] was unable to supply the power oh come
[1:00:02] on are we getting somewhere now
[1:00:03] the old covenant was covering sin but it
[1:00:06] was unable to supply the power
[1:00:09] that people would need to be able to
[1:00:11] live the way god wanted
[1:00:13] the law of moses was filled with thou
[1:00:16] shalt not
[1:00:17] and thou shalt and do this and don't do
[1:00:20] this
[1:00:20] do this and don't do this but there was
[1:00:23] nothing in the law
[1:00:24] that would give you power to overcome oh
[1:00:27] somebody helped me this morning
[1:00:29] the law was laying out what had to be
[1:00:31] done
[1:00:32] and how you had to live but god was not
[1:00:34] satisfied
[1:00:36] which has given the law he wanted to
[1:00:38] bring power to the people
[1:00:40] so that they could live with power live
[1:00:42] under the anointing
[1:00:43] live with our unsung to be able to fight
[1:00:46] every devil
[1:00:47] oh can the church say amen oh hallelujah
[1:00:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:53] the lord told them what they could do
[1:00:55] and what they could not do
[1:00:57] but it never had anything in the law to
[1:01:00] give them the spiritual
[1:01:01] power and if there's ever a need for
[1:01:03] spiritual power
[1:01:05] this is the day that we need spiritual
[1:01:07] power
[1:01:09] can the church amen hey many many men
[1:01:13] and more importantly that old covenant
[1:01:16] the old covenant had a built-in expiry
[1:01:20] date
[1:01:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah because they
[1:01:25] were just shadows
[1:01:27] of what was to come they were just
[1:01:29] hinting at what was to come
[1:01:31] it was designed with an expiry date
[1:01:35] so god knew that one day the old
[1:01:37] covenant
[1:01:38] there were attributes of it not that he
[1:01:40] was throwing it out
[1:01:41] but he was given a further revelation
[1:01:44] because blood was still required
[1:01:46] but this time not just the blood of
[1:01:48] bulls and goats but there was going to
[1:01:49] come one
[1:01:51] oh hallelujah that one sacrifice
[1:01:54] would be enough for your sins one
[1:01:57] sacrifice
[1:01:58] will be enough for my sins no more every
[1:02:00] year going in for an atonement
[1:02:02] but by one can the church say amen oh
[1:02:06] blessed be the name of the lord i just
[1:02:07] want to build a little bit so i want to
[1:02:09] take my time and go through some
[1:02:10] scriptures
[1:02:11] and go through some little teaching and
[1:02:13] bring in a few things here
[1:02:15] to encourage you a little bit with the
[1:02:17] foundation of some of the covenants
[1:02:19] and how the switch take place the
[1:02:21] unfolding mystery
[1:02:23] of the new covenant because without this
[1:02:25] new covenant
[1:02:26] you and i will have a chance without the
[1:02:28] new covenant
[1:02:29] we would not have a place oh come on now
[1:02:32] but to see how way back there
[1:02:34] god placed you and i in there and he
[1:02:37] placed a prophecy in there
[1:02:39] so that we could have a chance now if we
[1:02:41] have a reason to shout
[1:02:43] we have a reason to be excited we have a
[1:02:45] reason to be
[1:02:46] to be encouraged this morning
[1:02:50] so from the message hebrews chapter 7 2
[1:02:52] but the random is saying here and i'm
[1:02:54] going to read a little bit
[1:02:55] god be blessed forever of a son that
[1:02:58] continued forever
[1:02:59] after the order of melchizedek he never
[1:03:02] had a beginning
[1:03:03] he never has an end and the law could
[1:03:06] not produce
[1:03:07] nothing like that because it was carnal
[1:03:09] the church cannot produce nothing like
[1:03:11] that
[1:03:12] the denominations because they are
[1:03:14] carnal the seminaries can never produce
[1:03:16] it
[1:03:17] they try to educate the world they try
[1:03:19] to organize it to it
[1:03:21] they've tried every way in the world to
[1:03:23] make everything they could
[1:03:25] and leaving off the main thing which is
[1:03:27] and listen to the prophet you got to be
[1:03:29] born in it
[1:03:30] god makes you what you are certainly not
[1:03:33] because you quit doing this
[1:03:34] can the church say amen oh blessed be
[1:03:37] the name of the lord
[1:03:39] listen now you might not even know your
[1:03:41] abc's
[1:03:43] you might not know coffee from spit peas
[1:03:45] you might know not know
[1:03:47] g from right from left hand it
[1:03:49] don't make any difference what you don't
[1:03:51] know
[1:03:52] there's one thing you must know that
[1:03:54] jesus christ took your place as a sinner
[1:03:57] oh can the church say amen and you take
[1:04:00] your place
[1:04:01] to stand in his righteousness confessing
[1:04:04] every day that you are wrong
[1:04:06] and love him with all your heart and
[1:04:08] your whole motives
[1:04:10] be set towards him you'll make heaven
[1:04:12] there's
[1:04:13] all that's all there is to it for the
[1:04:15] life that was in christ
[1:04:16] has to be in you or you're lost so we're
[1:04:19] not talking about being in church
[1:04:21] we're not talking about being in the
[1:04:22] message we're talking about the life
[1:04:24] that was in christ
[1:04:25] has to be in you or you're lost and we
[1:04:28] know how brother branham brought it out
[1:04:30] when they offered the lamb as a
[1:04:31] sacrifice and they slit the truth
[1:04:34] and that life was leaving the animal it
[1:04:37] should have been a
[1:04:37] transfer of life but that life in the
[1:04:40] animal
[1:04:41] was not compatible with our life so it
[1:04:44] was bypassing us all along
[1:04:46] but when jesus died and brother branham
[1:04:49] said god ripped the covenant into
[1:04:51] he separated the spirit so that the
[1:04:53] spirit could fall on you and i
[1:04:55] so now we can have spirit the holy
[1:04:58] spirit itself
[1:04:59] operating through us can the church say
[1:05:01] amen oh hallelujah
[1:05:03] now listen to the prophet now just
[1:05:06] before closing i'm not closing he is
[1:05:08] saying this
[1:05:09] do you remember the unconditional
[1:05:11] covenant that god made with abraham
[1:05:14] what did he do that evening when god
[1:05:16] said let me see
[1:05:17] sixteenth chapter but ibrahim is gonna
[1:05:18] dramatize it so i wanna bring it out and
[1:05:20] remind you about it
[1:05:22] he said come here abraham and he took
[1:05:24] abraham
[1:05:25] he said go get me a ram go get me your
[1:05:27] goat
[1:05:28] go get me a heifer i want you to take
[1:05:30] them up here and make a sacrifice
[1:05:32] and abraham went and got the sheep and
[1:05:35] the goat and the lamb or the heifer he
[1:05:36] killed them
[1:05:37] there was all clean sacrifices and split
[1:05:40] them halfway in two
[1:05:42] and he laid them out then he went and
[1:05:44] got two turtle doves
[1:05:46] and pitched them in then abraham watched
[1:05:48] the birds off of them in other words he
[1:05:50] was fanning away
[1:05:51] every attack on the sacrifice then
[1:05:54] abraham watched the birds
[1:05:55] waiting for god to come now lord there's
[1:05:58] a sacrifice
[1:05:59] how are you going to do this i don't
[1:06:01] know how you're going to save man
[1:06:02] against his own will but ibrahim is
[1:06:04] dramatizing it
[1:06:05] i don't know how you're going to do this

[1:06:33] and the first thing you know
[1:06:35] god came down and when he came now
[1:06:37] abraham began to feel sleepy
[1:06:39] god said abraham i'm going to put you to
[1:06:41] sleep
[1:06:42] now listen legalist friend i'm reading
[1:06:44] from the prophet see god took abraham
[1:06:47] completely out of the picture nothing at
[1:06:50] all he had to do into it and that's the
[1:06:53] way he got you
[1:06:54] you said oh i saw god you didn't
[1:06:58] god sought you no man can come to me
[1:07:01] except the father
[1:07:02] draws him first so you are not here this
[1:07:04] morning
[1:07:05] by your own choosing you are not here
[1:07:07] this morning by your own desire
[1:07:10] no man can come except the father draws
[1:07:13] him first
[1:07:14] it's god seeking you not you seeking god
[1:07:17] you never did do it your nature is wrong
[1:07:21] you're a pig you don't know any
[1:07:22] different you just live in the pig pen

[1:07:27] abandon said drink beer
[1:07:29] swapping around run around with the next
[1:07:31] man's wife and doing everything you can
[1:07:32] do is evil
[1:07:33] or brother you think it's good but god
[1:07:36] knocks at your heart
[1:07:37] and that's what changes not you knocking
[1:07:40] at god
[1:07:41] god knocks at you adam never knocked at
[1:07:44] god's heart
[1:07:45] god knocked at adam's heart and you are
[1:07:48] son of adam that's right
[1:07:49] before adam could be a son of god again
[1:07:52] god had to knock on his heart and before
[1:07:56] you could be a son of god again god has
[1:07:58] to knock on your heart
[1:08:00] and he's knocking on hearts this morning
[1:08:02] oh that's a quote from the prophet
[1:08:04] he's knocking on your heart mama he's
[1:08:06] knocking on your heart pop
[1:08:07] up he's knocking on your heart brother
[1:08:09] he's knocking on your heart sister
[1:08:11] oh he said behold i stand at the door
[1:08:14] and knock
[1:08:14] and if any man oh come on now are we in
[1:08:17] the world this morning he is knocking he
[1:08:20] is seeking
[1:08:20] he is hunting he is not going to lose
[1:08:23] one because
[1:08:24] it's a covenant oh and with a covenant
[1:08:27] he's a covenanted people and there's the
[1:08:29] angel of the covenant
[1:08:30] to ensure that the covenant is enforced
[1:08:33] all this covenant is more powerful than
[1:08:36] your past
[1:08:37] this covenant is more powerful than your
[1:08:40] mistakes
[1:08:40] this covenant is more powerful than your
[1:08:43] failures
[1:08:44] this covenant is more powerful than
[1:08:46] whatever the devil could bring to you
[1:08:48] this morning
[1:08:49] it's a powerful covenant and god cannot
[1:08:51] break his word
[1:08:53] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:08:56] lord
[1:08:57] he swore by himself oh i might get to
[1:09:00] the core but the pranam said
[1:09:02] when you swear you swear by something
[1:09:04] greater than yourself
[1:09:06] that's what make the covenant up an
[1:09:08] enforceable
[1:09:09] powerful thing but when god looked to
[1:09:11] the left when he looked to the right
[1:09:13] he tried to find somebody that was
[1:09:15] greater than himself
[1:09:17] that he could swear by and when he found
[1:09:19] nobody greater
[1:09:21] he swore by himself because there was
[1:09:23] nobody greater than himself
[1:09:25] and he swore that there'll be a bribe he
[1:09:28] swore
[1:09:29] that every seed shall possess the gates
[1:09:32] of the enemy
[1:09:33] he swore that the seeds of abraham would
[1:09:36] come into power
[1:09:37] can the church see amen oh hallelujah
[1:09:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:42] oh encourage yourself shake yourself
[1:09:45] this morning
[1:09:46] oh come on now oh shake square your
[1:09:48] shoulders
[1:09:49] lift your head up you are covenant
[1:09:52] people
[1:09:52] you are covenant people you are walking
[1:09:55] in the covenant
[1:09:56] it's because of the covenant you are
[1:09:58] alive it's because of the covenant
[1:10:00] you can be set free it's because of the
[1:10:03] covenant
[1:10:04] oh can the church say amen oh we're
[1:10:06] going to go a little deeper
[1:10:08] we're still laying our coat and butter
[1:10:10] adam said and abraham went to sleep
[1:10:12] and when he went to sleep what was the
[1:10:15] first thing he saw
[1:10:16] a real horrible spooky dread darkness
[1:10:18] that's death
[1:10:19] that comes upon the whole human race
[1:10:22] then he looked a little
[1:10:23] farther than that and he saw a smoking
[1:10:26] furnace
[1:10:26] before you can have smoke you have to
[1:10:29] have fire
[1:10:30] that's the reason i believe in hell as a
[1:10:32] burning place he
[1:10:34] showed every one of us is subject to
[1:10:36] death and every one of us should go to
[1:10:38] hell
[1:10:38] because we are sinners do you get that
[1:10:40] this morning that we are supposed to go
[1:10:42] to hell
[1:10:43] because of sin but now but beyond that
[1:10:46] he saw a little white light and this
[1:10:48] little white light
[1:10:50] what is the light with the branham's
[1:10:51] head what was that white light
[1:10:53] that pillar of fire that went before the
[1:10:57] children of israel
[1:10:58] the pillar of fire that met paul on the
[1:11:01] road down to damascus
[1:11:03] the pillar of fire that took peter out
[1:11:05] of prison
[1:11:06] the pillar of fire that's here tonight
[1:11:09] and i say that pillar of fire
[1:11:11] is here this morning that pillar of fire
[1:11:14] is over your house
[1:11:15] that pillar of fire is over your family
[1:11:18] that pillar of fire
[1:11:19] is over your children that pillar of
[1:11:21] fire is over this church
[1:11:23] that pillar of fire is over the world
[1:11:25] this morning
[1:11:26] and he's going to bring the world to
[1:11:28] pass he's going to bring the covenant
[1:11:30] to pass oh hallelujah oh blessed be the
[1:11:34] name of the lord
[1:11:35] i'm still building a background oh
[1:11:37] hallelujah we haven't started yet
[1:11:40] so get warmed up get ready lift your
[1:11:43] shoulders
[1:11:44] lift your head up we are going somewhere
[1:11:46] this morning
[1:11:47] i'm gonna show you that it is impossible
[1:11:50] for the bride to miss the rapture
[1:11:52] it's impossible for you to miss the holy
[1:11:54] ghost it's impossible
[1:11:56] for you to miss your adoption it's
[1:11:58] impossible for your family
[1:12:00] to be left on the outside because this
[1:12:02] covenant
[1:12:03] is for you and it's for your children
[1:12:05] and it's for them that are far off
[1:12:07] i don't care how fine the world they are
[1:12:09] this covenant
[1:12:10] has power to pull them back in can the
[1:12:13] church say amen
[1:12:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:19] i'm with the random ghost and i'm still
[1:12:21] in that quote that
[1:12:22] eternal everlasting god
[1:12:26] he himself walked between these split
[1:12:29] sacrifices
[1:12:30] oh my the prophet says back and forth on
[1:12:34] each one
[1:12:34] and by the branham is dramatizing he
[1:12:37] said this is how i'm gonna do it abraham
[1:12:39] watch me watch what am i going to do
[1:12:43] i'm making a covenant here and i'll take
[1:12:46] an
[1:12:46] oath that according to thy seed
[1:12:50] oh hallelujah mine and according to the
[1:12:52] seed i'll raise up an
[1:12:54] intercessor i'll make a covenant with
[1:12:57] death
[1:12:57] now a covenant is an agreement a
[1:12:59] covenant is a contract
[1:13:01] a covenant is a formal agreement he said
[1:13:03] i'll make a covenant
[1:13:05] with debt and i'll condemn that in other
[1:13:07] words
[1:13:08] he made an agreement to tell death i'm
[1:13:10] going to condemn you
[1:13:12] so it's not just a covenant for your
[1:13:14] blessing you know he made a covenant
[1:13:16] with that
[1:13:17] i'll condemn debt in the flesh because i
[1:13:20] myself will come take it
[1:13:22] abraham said through your seed abraham
[1:13:24] will come you'll be the father of the
[1:13:26] world
[1:13:27] through your seed and not only you do i
[1:13:29] make this promise with you
[1:13:31] but your seed after you he knew everyone
[1:13:34] would be
[1:13:35] not them not but what i do i'm going to
[1:13:37] do it abraham
[1:13:38] i trusted abraham and he broke his and
[1:13:41] everyone breaks theirs but i
[1:13:43] make this with myself and swear by
[1:13:46] myself can the church say many many many
[1:13:50] many many men
[1:13:52] oh hallelujah i'm gonna bring in that
[1:13:54] message
[1:13:55] he went on to speak about the way that
[1:13:57] different people make covenants
[1:13:59] he says how some people in america you
[1:14:01] shake hands
[1:14:02] and that's the covenant can the church
[1:14:04] say man
[1:14:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah um i'll give an
[1:14:09] example
[1:14:09] he said now watch how they make a
[1:14:11] covenant in japan
[1:14:13] we make you do so and so and i'll do so
[1:14:15] and so we take a little pinch of salt
[1:14:17] because salt is a savor and we take salt
[1:14:19] and i throw it on brother neville and
[1:14:21] we're gonna never take salt and throw it
[1:14:23] on unto me that's a binding covenant
[1:14:25] oh hallelujah i'm with the bran was just
[1:14:27] bringing out examples
[1:14:29] of these different covenants and these
[1:14:31] different agreements can the church say
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:33] how did they do it in the oriental time
[1:14:36] they made an
[1:14:37] oath one to another they killed a beast
[1:14:40] split it open
[1:14:41] stood right in between and two men stood
[1:14:43] between it
[1:14:44] and the split beast can the church say
[1:14:46] amen and they drawed up a covenant
[1:14:48] if i fail to keep this if i fail to do
[1:14:51] this
[1:14:52] why this and so and so let my body be
[1:14:55] like this dead beast
[1:14:56] let my body be like this and when they
[1:14:58] do that they take this covenant
[1:15:01] and stand between this make an oat and
[1:15:04] they'll do it and they tear the people
[1:15:06] together apart
[1:15:07] and hand it to one man the other one the
[1:15:09] next
[1:15:10] at a certain time they'll meet and let
[1:15:12] them die the debt
[1:15:14] if they fail to keep the oath can the
[1:15:16] church say amen
[1:15:17] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:21] now notice i'm still in a foundation the
[1:15:23] tree beast
[1:15:25] the perfect lamb god the tree perfect
[1:15:27] sacrifice
[1:15:28] what was the lamb what was the turtle
[1:15:29] dove and what was the two
[1:15:31] turtle doves meant the two turtle doves
[1:15:34] was sacrificed
[1:15:35] for both salvation and healing see the
[1:15:37] atonement
[1:15:39] was made different but healing continued
[1:15:41] at the same
[1:15:42] and so did salvation continue the same
[1:15:45] the two
[1:15:46] turtle doves not divided men they are
[1:15:48] represented both
[1:15:49] by his stripes we were healed he was
[1:15:52] wounded for our transgressions
[1:15:54] with his stripes we were healed up they
[1:15:56] were laid on the side not
[1:15:58] separated but the covenant can you see
[1:16:01] watch what god was telling abraham
[1:16:03] at calvary according to your seed
[1:16:06] out of you come isaac out of isaac come
[1:16:08] so and so jacob
[1:16:09] out of jacob come joseph out of joseph
[1:16:12] on down
[1:16:13] on down successor still finally threw
[1:16:16] that righteous seed he just got through
[1:16:20] here saying that our lord
[1:16:21] sprung out of a nation that knowed not
[1:16:24] moses
[1:16:25] never even spoke of it come out of the
[1:16:28] priesthood
[1:16:28] our lord sprung out out of the tribe of
[1:16:31] judah
[1:16:31] not out of levi for they were kana
[1:16:34] legalists we're going to touch a little
[1:16:36] later
[1:16:36] but our lord come out of judah there you
[1:16:38] are where the promise was made
[1:16:41] oh hallelujah listen close now i'm
[1:16:43] almost finished this quote
[1:16:45] as we close at calvary god come down and
[1:16:48] took the body of his own son
[1:16:50] in which he had lived and he ripped it
[1:16:52] apart at calvary
[1:16:53] his bleeding wounded cut and the spear
[1:16:56] run in there and ripped him apart
[1:16:58] and his blood crushed out and he said
[1:17:00] father into thy hand
[1:17:02] i commend my spirit he bowed his head
[1:17:05] and the earth shook and the lightnings
[1:17:07] flashed and the thunders roared
[1:17:09] god was writing his everlasting covenant
[1:17:13] can the church say amen so on calvary
[1:17:16] he said god was writing his everlasting
[1:17:18] covenant this was not a
[1:17:20] temporary thing this was the everlasting
[1:17:22] covenant and he took his dead body from
[1:17:24] the grave
[1:17:25] on the first day of the week and brought
[1:17:28] it up into heaven
[1:17:29] and sat it there as the high priest as a
[1:17:31] memorial
[1:17:32] setting there perfect forever and he
[1:17:35] sent the spirit
[1:17:36] that he tore out of that body right back
[1:17:39] down in the church
[1:17:40] and that church would have to have the
[1:17:42] same spirit that was in that body
[1:17:45] oh it won't dovetail with it in the
[1:17:47] resurrection
[1:17:48] these two pieces must perfectly
[1:17:52] come must come perfectly together and if
[1:17:55] this church listen to the challenge
[1:17:57] isn't perfectly just exactly
[1:18:00] the same spirit that was in christ
[1:18:02] you'll never go in the rapture let me
[1:18:04] say that one more time
[1:18:05] and if this church isn't perfectly
[1:18:08] just exactly the same spirit that was in
[1:18:12] christ
[1:18:13] you'll never go in the rapture there's
[1:18:15] your everlasting covenant brother
[1:18:17] seek it out yourself what's in your
[1:18:20] heart
[1:18:20] love the lord really be sure that you're
[1:18:23] saved
[1:18:24] don't take a chance on it you're
[1:18:26] gambling oh you
[1:18:27] we american people love to gamble but
[1:18:30] don't you gamble
[1:18:31] on that you'll be sure that you're right
[1:18:33] not because you joined church
[1:18:35] but because you're truly born again
[1:18:38] christ has come to you
[1:18:39] in the person of the holy ghost so you
[1:18:41] see i'm connecting
[1:18:42] to what brother has been preaching what
[1:18:44] the holy ghost has given for
[1:18:46] the need for the holy ghost it's not
[1:18:48] about church membership
[1:18:49] it's not about church attendance but
[1:18:51] it's about that life being changed
[1:18:53] about the holy ghost being perfectly
[1:18:55] what jesus had
[1:18:57] not an experience and just a touch but
[1:19:00] the same signs
[1:19:01] the same life the same wonders the same
[1:19:04] behavior
[1:19:05] the same nature the same being the same
[1:19:08] attitude attributes his same desires
[1:19:12] come the church same am so we going
[1:19:15] through so we know god started
[1:19:17] he started to build his work because
[1:19:19] when man
[1:19:20] fell god realized that man could not
[1:19:22] redeem himself
[1:19:23] god always knew that man could not
[1:19:26] restore himself
[1:19:27] so god had to put something in place
[1:19:29] when adam broke
[1:19:31] that original covenant that existed
[1:19:34] oh he knew god god knew he had to make a
[1:19:37] way
[1:19:37] that if he did not make a way there'd be
[1:19:40] no hope for us
[1:19:41] can the church say amen if god doesn't
[1:19:44] make a way
[1:19:45] our best efforts would not be good
[1:19:47] enough so god started to build again
[1:19:50] and through the ages he's building he is
[1:19:52] building and he's dropping promises
[1:19:55] dropping promises he is dropping
[1:19:57] inspiration
[1:19:58] he's dropping covenants he's dropping
[1:20:00] promises
[1:20:01] so that the people can keep pressing oh
[1:20:03] and that's what we're doing this morning
[1:20:05] reminding you of the promise reminding
[1:20:07] you of the covenant
[1:20:08] reminding you so you could have
[1:20:10] confidence to face the workday
[1:20:12] you could have confidence to deal with
[1:20:14] your family you could have confidence
[1:20:16] to look sickness in the face and said i
[1:20:19] am under a covenant
[1:20:20] oh sickness get away from me you can
[1:20:22] look death in the face
[1:20:24] and say i'm under a covenant oh debt you
[1:20:26] already defeated
[1:20:27] there's a covenant already with you that
[1:20:30] has been enforced
[1:20:31] by jesus christ oh hallelujah debt
[1:20:34] where's your sting grave where's your
[1:20:36] victory i'm under a covenant
[1:20:38] and in that covenant is the holy ghost
[1:20:41] in that covenant is power
[1:20:42] in that covenant is dynamic some in that
[1:20:45] covenant is the revival
[1:20:47] in that covenant seven living voices in
[1:20:49] that new covenant
[1:20:51] oh can the church say amen the old
[1:20:53] covenant was temporary
[1:20:55] it could only carry you so far but when
[1:20:58] jesus came
[1:20:59] he introduced a new covenant oh
[1:21:01] hallelujah
[1:21:03] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:06] you may be seated let's see how god
[1:21:08] built it to see how god operates
[1:21:10] and maybe this will be an encouragement
[1:21:12] to you in exodus
[1:21:14] 2 24 the bible says and god heard their
[1:21:17] groaning
[1:21:18] we're talking about the children of
[1:21:19] israel in bondage and god heard
[1:21:21] their groaning and god remembered his
[1:21:24] covenant
[1:21:25] with abraham with isaac and with jacob
[1:21:29] so god heard their groaning but it was
[1:21:31] because of a covenant
[1:21:33] it was not just the groaning that moved
[1:21:35] him
[1:21:36] it was when he heard the groaning he was
[1:21:38] able to enforce something
[1:21:40] because a covenant was already in place
[1:21:42] oh glory to god
[1:21:44] if the oh my if you catch it this
[1:21:46] morning
[1:21:47] that is because of the covenant you
[1:21:49] already have the victory
[1:21:51] oh those children of israel were in
[1:21:53] bondage but the covenant
[1:21:55] was bigger than their bondage the
[1:21:57] covenant was bigger than pharaoh
[1:21:59] oh hallelujah all that pharaoh had was
[1:22:02] no match for the covenant
[1:22:04] all glory to god all the years they were
[1:22:07] in bondage
[1:22:08] was no match for the covenant because
[1:22:10] the moment god remembered the covenant
[1:22:12] the covenant went into effect may the
[1:22:15] covenant
[1:22:16] come into effect this morning may god as
[1:22:19] the prophet said confirm the covenant
[1:22:21] with signs with wonders when miracles

[1:22:27] morning the covenant is hovering over
[1:22:29] your house this morning
[1:22:31] may today be a day for the confirmation
[1:22:34] of the covenant oh hallelujah the
[1:22:37] promise that god made
[1:22:39] to you and your family the promise that
[1:22:41] god made
[1:22:42] to preserve you in the hour of
[1:22:44] temptation
[1:22:45] that covenant cannot fail he swore by
[1:22:48] himself
[1:22:50] oh hallelujah oh forgive me
[1:22:54] i'm excited because if you ever feel
[1:22:56] down
[1:22:57] think about the covenant in your
[1:22:59] groaning think about the covenant
[1:23:01] in your down moment think about a
[1:23:02] covenant god has a covenant with you and
[1:23:05] your children
[1:23:06] your children are under the covenant i
[1:23:08] don't care where they are this morning
[1:23:09] they are under the covenant oh come on
[1:23:12] now come on now come on now
[1:23:14] oh your sickness has to give way to the
[1:23:17] covenant

[1:23:23] the covenant
[1:23:24] oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of
[1:23:28] the lord
[1:23:28] we are building somewhere oh hebrews
[1:23:31] chapter six
[1:23:32] but abraham said the covenant that god
[1:23:35] made with israel
[1:23:36] they lost their inheritance they lost
[1:23:38] the promised land and went
[1:23:40] on into egypt listen to the prophet they
[1:23:42] lost it and went known into egypt
[1:23:44] so they got into trouble and there are
[1:23:46] many people in church that got
[1:23:47] themselves into trouble
[1:23:50] many people have found themselves in
[1:23:51] trouble but listen to how the prophet
[1:23:53] adjusted
[1:23:54] he said but they hadn't lost the
[1:23:55] covenant oh
[1:23:57] my glory so they were in bondage
[1:24:00] they lost their liberty but they did not
[1:24:03] lose the covenant
[1:24:04] they lost their freedom but they didn't
[1:24:07] lose their covenant
[1:24:08] they lost all come on now whatever you
[1:24:11] lost this morning
[1:24:12] just know you cannot lose this covenant

[1:25:00] to destroy the works of darkness and to
[1:25:03] restore men
[1:25:04] from this fallen condition this was
[1:25:07] fallen man
[1:25:08] having the victory oh the children of
[1:25:10] israel still had to do their
[1:25:12] sacrifices but the covenant was enough
[1:25:14] to keep them going
[1:25:15] can the church say amen oh i feel
[1:25:18] religious this morning
[1:25:19] i want you to remember you cannot lose
[1:25:21] your covenant

[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:48] hallelujah i prayed it in the prayer
[1:26:51] meeting on friday night

[1:26:54] that you have to complain
[1:26:56] if you write them all down and you put
[1:26:59] next to it
[1:27:00] all the reasons that you have to be
[1:27:02] thankful they will always
[1:27:04] outweigh the reasons to complain oh i
[1:27:06] can guarantee you this morning if you
[1:27:08] write down all of your sorrows
[1:27:10] write on all of your cares write down
[1:27:12] all of your problems

[1:27:19] thank you for having
[1:27:20] a finger if i only have one finger

[1:27:24] there's so much reason to thank god for
[1:27:27] i got a pain in my shoulder but there's
[1:27:29] somebody with no shoulder that's a
[1:27:30] reason to thank god for oh i may not
[1:27:33] have shoes
[1:27:34] but thank god i have feet because
[1:27:36] there's somebody who has no feet
[1:27:37] oh come on there's a reason to be
[1:27:39] grateful this morning
[1:27:41] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:44] there's more reasons to be thankful than
[1:27:47] to be sad
[1:27:48] there are more reasons i don't care how
[1:27:50] bad things are there's more reason
[1:27:52] to be grateful to god than to be
[1:27:54] depressed
[1:27:55] than to be frustrated than to be under
[1:27:58] the privileges
[1:27:59] of what god called you for your station
[1:28:03] blessed be the name of the lord i'm
[1:28:06] absolutely positive about that
[1:28:08] i'm not questioning i'm not suggesting
[1:28:10] it i'm not arguing it you have more
[1:28:12] reasons
[1:28:13] to give god a solder praise you have a
[1:28:16] big reason
[1:28:16] the fact that your name is in the book
[1:28:19] he said rejoice not
[1:28:20] because the demons are subject to you
[1:28:22] but give god worship
[1:28:24] because your name is written in heaven
[1:28:26] if nothing else is right in your life
[1:28:29] rejoice because your name is written in
[1:28:32] heaven
[1:28:32] that's a reason to be excited this
[1:28:34] morning
[1:28:36] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:28:39] lord
[1:28:40] can we go a little further i'm reading
[1:28:43] in exodus 19.
[1:28:44] if you have your bibles you can look
[1:28:46] reference it with me exodus 19 verse 4
[1:28:49] you have seen what i did unto the
[1:28:52] egyptians
[1:28:54] and how i bear you how i carried you how
[1:28:56] i
[1:28:57] lifted you up on eagle's wings and
[1:29:00] brought you to myself
[1:29:01] hallelujah now therefore listen to the
[1:29:04] word of the lord
[1:29:05] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[1:29:08] indeed and
[1:29:10] keep my covenant oh hallelujah
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:14] then shall ye be listen a peculiar
[1:29:17] treasure unto me above all people
[1:29:21] for all the earth is mine and ye shall
[1:29:24] be unto me
[1:29:25] listen a kingdom of priests
[1:29:29] this is the first time you're hearing
[1:29:30] royalty being combined with priesthood
[1:29:34] hallelujah oh come on now
[1:29:38] a kingdom of priest moses i don't even
[1:29:41] know if moses was understanding the
[1:29:43] magnitude
[1:29:44] of what god was speaking because this
[1:29:46] was not being directed to moses
[1:29:49] oh hallelujah when you read this you
[1:29:51] will find this repeated
[1:29:52] in the new testament come on now let me
[1:29:55] read it slowly
[1:29:57] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[1:29:59] indeed and keep my covenant
[1:30:02] then shall you be a peculiar treasure
[1:30:05] unto me
[1:30:06] above all people for all the earth is
[1:30:09] mine
[1:30:10] and ye shall be under me a kingdom of
[1:30:12] priests
[1:30:13] and an holy nation these are the words
[1:30:17] which thou shalt speak unto the children
[1:30:19] of israel
[1:30:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah what did we
[1:30:24] read
[1:30:24] from peter oh hallelujah
[1:30:28] so it was not just peter just saying
[1:30:31] words
[1:30:31] peter was quoting what god told moses
[1:30:36] and moses the next verse said to get
[1:30:38] gotten get the elders and
[1:30:40] and and and let the people know we read
[1:30:42] it in first peter but we
[1:30:44] are a chosen generation a royal
[1:30:47] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:30:51] people
[1:30:51] but this in peter is not even directed
[1:30:55] to the jews because he's speaking about
[1:30:58] jews and gentiles
[1:30:59] but when god is talking to moses because
[1:31:01] god is everlasting
[1:31:03] and in god's economy he's not managing
[1:31:05] by time
[1:31:06] he is speaking dispensational prophets
[1:31:10] speaking to people throughout ages can
[1:31:12] the church say amen
[1:31:15] you remember our teaching with jehu god
[1:31:17] told
[1:31:18] elijah to do something and it was
[1:31:21] true elijah through elisha through a
[1:31:24] servant a son of the prophet fulfilled
[1:31:26] it
[1:31:27] can the church say amen so here it is
[1:31:30] god
[1:31:31] is putting a seed for a certain group of
[1:31:33] people
[1:31:34] who are not even there and god is
[1:31:36] placing us
[1:31:38] there and speaking to moses he said and
[1:31:41] ye
[1:31:41] shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[1:31:46] the kings and the priests didn't mix in
[1:31:47] the old testament
[1:31:49] they were from two different tribes so
[1:31:51] moses was repeating
[1:31:53] maybe what he didn't even understand a
[1:31:55] holy nation
[1:31:57] a peculiar treasure is there and moses
[1:32:00] came verse 7
[1:32:02] and called for the elders of the people
[1:32:04] and laid before their faces
[1:32:06] all these words which the lord commanded
[1:32:09] him
[1:32:09] can the church say a many many many men
[1:32:13] everybody feeling fine oh
[1:32:16] my my my mind so we're building a little
[1:32:18] bit
[1:32:19] this is in a message revelation chapter
[1:32:22] four
[1:32:23] i'm just dropping some seeds a bill into
[1:32:24] something now in exodus but ibrahim
[1:32:27] saying in exodus 23
[1:32:28] and hebrews 6 god made a covenant with
[1:32:31] himself
[1:32:31] and saw by himself hebrews 1309
[1:32:34] 13 he swore by himself there was no
[1:32:37] creator to swear
[1:32:39] by when he told abraham and isaac there
[1:32:41] he told abraham that he would make a
[1:32:43] covenant with him
[1:32:44] an everlasting covenant a covenant is
[1:32:47] always made by an oath
[1:32:49] so there you take an oath by somebody
[1:32:51] greater than you
[1:32:53] all right so that's making sure it's
[1:32:55] there take a note by your mother
[1:32:57] take a note by your nation taken over by
[1:32:59] something taken out by god
[1:33:01] but you can't take an oath unless it's
[1:33:04] somebody greater than you this is the
[1:33:06] prophet's teaching
[1:33:07] and there was nobody greater than god
[1:33:10] so he took an oath by himself by himself
[1:33:13] amen swearing by himself that he would
[1:33:16] confirm this covenant so it's one thing
[1:33:20] brother papa
[1:33:21] to have the covenant it's another thing
[1:33:24] for the covenant to be confirmed
[1:33:25] oh my god hallelujah
[1:33:29] oh who swear by it he said he would
[1:33:31] preserve i'm reading a prophet
[1:33:33] he will preserve the seed of abraham
[1:33:36] what is the seed of abraham to the
[1:33:38] gentile listen to the prophet the
[1:33:40] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:33:42] a seed of abraham soar by himself
[1:33:45] i'll raise them up everyone i'll give
[1:33:47] them eternal life
[1:33:48] and place them back here on the ut oh
[1:33:51] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:54] glory oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:57] and we see time moving we're building
[1:33:59] somewhere this morning we're going
[1:34:00] somewhere
[1:34:01] so all of this we're talking about
[1:34:02] abraham we don't even know we're talking
[1:34:04] about moses
[1:34:05] they are speaking under inspiration but
[1:34:07] they're still under the old covenant
[1:34:10] so we reached a joshua now and brother
[1:34:13] anthony preached a message about four
[1:34:14] years ago
[1:34:15] the angel of the covenant and he was
[1:34:17] preaching how joshua
[1:34:18] was there sharpening his sword reading
[1:34:21] the scriptures
[1:34:22] trying to figure out how to take jericho
[1:34:24] and then the unseen captain of the host
[1:34:27] or the angel of the covenant the
[1:34:28] enforcer of the covenant
[1:34:30] the spirit of the covenant came to give
[1:34:32] instructions
[1:34:34] on how to take jericho can the church
[1:34:36] say amen
[1:34:37] so god doesn't just have a covenant he
[1:34:39] has the angel of the covenant
[1:34:41] and by the branham type the angel of the
[1:34:43] covenant as christ
[1:34:44] is the angel of the covenant oh come on
[1:34:46] now oh hallelujah glory
[1:34:50] blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:34:52] through david and to all the ages come
[1:34:54] down
[1:34:55] listen to the prophet in the first seal
[1:34:57] and we know christ
[1:34:59] is always the messenger to the church
[1:35:01] he's always a messenger
[1:35:03] he is called the pillar of fire the
[1:35:05] angel of the covenant
[1:35:06] and so forth so you could understand
[1:35:09] that it's jesus we're talking about
[1:35:11] oh he is the new covenant he is the holy
[1:35:14] ghost
[1:35:14] he is power jesus in me that's what i'm
[1:35:17] looking for
[1:35:18] i don't want to the church in me i don't
[1:35:20] want to just be a church member
[1:35:22] i want that same life i want that life
[1:35:25] in me
[1:35:25] can the church say oh hallelujah
[1:35:29] hallelujah glory to
[1:35:30] god the unfolding mystery of the new
[1:35:34] covenant
[1:35:35] year in year out you have to go make
[1:35:37] sacrifices
[1:35:38] every single year and you have to wait
[1:35:40] the high priest would go
[1:35:42] in and they would have a cord tied to
[1:35:44] the high priest
[1:35:45] they had bells on his clothes so when he
[1:35:48] walked
[1:35:48] you hear the sound so if you know the
[1:35:51] sound then you know he's still alive
[1:35:53] because you don't know when he goes into
[1:35:55] the holies of holies
[1:35:56] if god will accept the sacrifice
[1:35:59] because if god don't accept the
[1:36:01] sacrifice he would die
[1:36:03] in death and nobody could walk in tears
[1:36:06] because if you walk in there it was dead
[1:36:08] to go in the way there so they would tie
[1:36:10] a rope to the high priest
[1:36:12] so that if they stop hearing the ringing
[1:36:14] of the bells and if too much time
[1:36:16] passed they would pull the high priest
[1:36:19] out of the holies of holies
[1:36:21] but god said that is not what i want oh
[1:36:24] hallelujah
[1:36:25] i want a perfect people i want a perfect
[1:36:28] bride
[1:36:28] they need a perfect sacrifice they need
[1:36:31] a perfect way out of here
[1:36:33] not something temporary not something
[1:36:35] that works sometimes
[1:36:36] and don't work another time i want their
[1:36:39] joy
[1:36:40] to be full i want them to have a perfect
[1:36:42] standing
[1:36:43] a perfect state i wanted to know their
[1:36:45] position
[1:36:46] i wanted to know who they are what can
[1:36:48] the church say
[1:36:49] man oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:36:54] oh hallelujah so powerful
[1:36:58] that when jesus came oh what it was
[1:37:02] what a thing how god slipped in so
[1:37:05] powerfully
[1:37:06] brother hugh god in his great master
[1:37:09] plan
[1:37:10] god in his great plan
[1:37:13] sent to earth he sent
[1:37:16] brother brother punch a king
[1:37:20] he sent a prophet he sent a priest
[1:37:24] and he sent a sacrifice and wrapped it
[1:37:27] up in one
[1:37:28] he sent a multi too
[1:37:33] talk about dynamite dear in a manger

[1:38:18] amen
[1:38:20] oh i feel religious if mary only
[1:38:23] understood
[1:38:24] what she was holding if joseph only
[1:38:27] understood
[1:38:28] when he was walking around the house and

[1:42:54] covenant
[1:42:55] that god made with the people what a
[1:42:58] beautiful
[1:42:58] picture of god making his covenant with
[1:43:01] the church
[1:43:02] when jesus christ went to calvary who
[1:43:04] was god emmanuel
[1:43:06] god ripped him apart at calvary tore the
[1:43:09] covenant in
[1:43:10] two took the body up to his right hand
[1:43:12] and
[1:43:13] send the holy ghost back to the church
[1:43:15] and the same spirit
[1:43:17] is in the church today and the same holy
[1:43:20] ghost
[1:43:21] hallelujah that was back there has to be
[1:43:24] the same holy ghost
[1:43:25] oh when we come together making jesus
[1:43:28] christ the same yesterday
[1:43:30] today and forever oh hallelujah
[1:43:34] give the lord a shout our praise give
[1:43:37] the lord worship this morning
[1:43:40] oh hallelujah in the exposition of the
[1:43:43] seven church ages
[1:43:44] but abraham said jacob alone had the
[1:43:47] seed
[1:43:49] hallelujah so we said all the time you
[1:43:51] are not a believer
[1:43:53] the word in you that seed in you
[1:43:56] is the believer so although jacob had
[1:43:59] his issues
[1:44:01] oh there was a seed in jacob and the man
[1:44:03] said jacob alone had the seed
[1:44:05] that is why he had respect to the
[1:44:07] birthright and covenant of god
[1:44:10] and brethren said if you are true seed
[1:44:13] you will hear that word
[1:44:14] the spirit will baptize you into the
[1:44:17] body of christ
[1:44:18] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:44:21] will receive the word for your day
[1:44:24] and for your age can the church say man
[1:44:28] oh my my my my everybody feeling fine
[1:44:33] so we read the scripture
[1:44:36] about priests and royal priesthood and
[1:44:38] that's our promise that's who you are
[1:44:40] holy nation peculiar people
[1:44:44] world can't figure you out and we were
[1:44:47] doing a bible
[1:44:48] study on peter and peter was
[1:44:51] uniquely positioned to be able to write
[1:44:53] this
[1:44:54] because i want you to catch this as well
[1:44:57] jesus is on the earth
[1:44:58] he is king nobody knows
[1:45:02] he is prophet even messiah anointed word
[1:45:06] and nobody understands he is
[1:45:10] not a priest he is to be the
[1:45:13] high priest he's also the sacrifice
[1:45:18] but you can't do a sacrifice unless
[1:45:20] there's a high priest to perform the
[1:45:22] sacrifice
[1:45:24] but in that day when jesus is there
[1:45:27] there's carefuls
[1:45:30] and caiaphas is high priest under the
[1:45:33] law
[1:45:34] if there's a sitting high priest the
[1:45:36] high priest
[1:45:37] is supposed to perform the sacrifice
[1:45:40] jesus is the sacrifice
[1:45:41] they don't understand who he is they
[1:45:43] don't know that he the sacrifice the
[1:45:45] perfect sacrifice is there
[1:45:47] but this high priest caiaphas he is
[1:45:50] clueless he is blind
[1:45:52] to the fact that the perfect sacrifice
[1:45:54] is there
[1:45:56] so god has ways he connects the dots to
[1:45:59] work things out
[1:46:00] for the whole picture to fall in place
[1:46:02] are you with me this morning so can i
[1:46:04] take you back to that encounter
[1:46:06] let's go back to matthew 26 and verse
[1:46:08] 57.
[1:46:10] so here it is jesus he's being moved
[1:46:12] from place to place as it were
[1:46:14] they're trying to figure it figure out
[1:46:16] who he is what he is
[1:46:18] what his ministry is isn't that right
[1:46:20] and matthew 26
[1:46:22] 37 and they that had laid hold on jesus
[1:46:26] led him away to caiaphas the high priest
[1:46:30] where the scribes and the elders were
[1:46:31] assembled so we see a picture being
[1:46:33] painted here's the high priest
[1:46:35] here the scribes here are the elders
[1:46:38] they are sitting there in their seats of
[1:46:40] power
[1:46:40] as it were and they bring this mystery
[1:46:44] oh they bring this mystery in front of
[1:46:46] the high priest
[1:46:47] this man was a man of the people now he
[1:46:50] is getting closer and closer
[1:46:52] to completing the great mystery of
[1:46:54] switching from the old covenant
[1:46:56] to the new covenant anybody with me this
[1:46:58] morning
[1:46:59] the next verse verse 58 but peter
[1:47:02] followed him
[1:47:04] afar off so we know is one person for
[1:47:07] sure
[1:47:08] witnessing what about to happen anybody
[1:47:10] with me this morning
[1:47:12] but peter followed him afar off onto the
[1:47:14] high priest palace
[1:47:16] and went in and sat with the servants
[1:47:20] to see the end oh my
[1:47:23] oh my anybody with me this morning peter
[1:47:26] don't know what's happening
[1:47:28] peter has been following peter has been
[1:47:30] faithful to the best he could
[1:47:32] peter is seeing things that he could
[1:47:33] hardly understand
[1:47:35] because he really needs a new covenant
[1:47:37] to unlock the new power
[1:47:38] to unlock the holy ghost so that he
[1:47:41] could be transformed
[1:47:42] can the church say man anybody with me
[1:47:44] this morning just a little a little
[1:47:46] teaching here
[1:47:47] no the chief priests and elders
[1:47:51] and all the council sought false witness
[1:47:54] against jesus
[1:47:55] to put him to death but found none
[1:47:59] they were trying to find something to
[1:48:01] stick on jesus but they couldn't find
[1:48:03] none ye though many false witnesses came
[1:48:06] yet found they none at the last came two
[1:48:10] false witnesses and said this fellow
[1:48:12] said i am able to destroy the temple of
[1:48:14] god
[1:48:15] and to build it in three days and the
[1:48:17] high priest arose
[1:48:19] and said unto him answer it doubt
[1:48:21] nothing what is it
[1:48:22] with these witness against thee but
[1:48:25] jesus held his peace
[1:48:27] and the high priest answered and said
[1:48:29] unto him are you jervy
[1:48:31] by the living god that thou tell us
[1:48:33] whether
[1:48:34] thou be the christ the son of god and
[1:48:37] jesus saith unto him
[1:48:39] thou has said nevertheless i say unto
[1:48:41] you hereafter
[1:48:43] shall you see the son of man sitting on
[1:48:46] the right hand of power
[1:48:47] and coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:48:51] so i want you to see the whole play out
[1:48:52] here god already sees this holding play
[1:48:55] out
[1:48:56] and the bible said in verse 65 that then
[1:48:59] the high priest rent his clothes
[1:49:01] saying he had spoken blasphemy what for
[1:49:04] the need have we of witnesses
[1:49:06] behold you have heard this his blasphemy
[1:49:10] and in that moment there's a i want to
[1:49:13] call it a transfer of power
[1:49:15] in that very moment because we're
[1:49:17] getting closer to the hour of sacrifice
[1:49:19] isn't that right now i want to go back
[1:49:21] to leviticus 21.
[1:49:23] in leviticus 21 verse 10 if you have it
[1:49:26] or you can reach it
[1:49:28] the bible says and he that is the high
[1:49:30] priest among his brethren
[1:49:32] upon whose head the anointing oil was
[1:49:34] poured
[1:49:35] and that is consecrated to put on the
[1:49:38] garments
[1:49:39] shall not uncover his head nor rend his
[1:49:42] clothes
[1:49:45] so in that moment so there's a levitical
[1:49:47] law
[1:49:48] that is enforced there so care of us
[1:49:51] without understanding the magnitude
[1:49:54] of what is happening in front of him
[1:49:56] when caiaphas ripped his clothes
[1:49:59] he disqualified himself
[1:50:02] as high priest can the church say man
[1:50:05] he disqualified himself as high priest
[1:50:08] and
[1:50:08] a high priest who was looking at this
[1:50:11] earthly high priest
[1:50:13] was able to take on the mantle for the
[1:50:15] sacrifice
[1:50:16] come on now anybody with me this morning
[1:50:19] to see how god unfolds it
[1:50:21] to see how scared of us didn't even
[1:50:23] understand the peace he was playing
[1:50:25] that he was just temporary so jesus left
[1:50:28] there
[1:50:29] there was no high priest sitting down to
[1:50:31] perform the sacrifice
[1:50:32] and here it was the high priest and the
[1:50:34] sacrifice
[1:50:35] was being led away oh come on now oh
[1:50:39] because this new covenant could not be
[1:50:41] handled by the hands of man
[1:50:43] this new ministry was not for man to be
[1:50:46] involved with
[1:50:47] it was god himself he was king he is
[1:50:51] prophet
[1:50:51] he is priesthood he is sacrificed coming
[1:50:54] to claim
[1:50:55] the ears of redemption and enforce
[1:50:59] the everlasting covenant enforce the new
[1:51:02] covenant
[1:51:03] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:51:06] prophesied through the ages prophesied
[1:51:10] through prophets
[1:51:13] can the church say man oh could he take
[1:51:16] some more
[1:51:17] oh hallelujah i didn't want to pick up
[1:51:19] some more pieces
[1:51:21] so everything had been pointed at this
[1:51:23] moment by the sheen
[1:51:24] everything i've been pointing away from
[1:51:27] man walking in and doing sacrifice
[1:51:29] everything had been pouring away god was
[1:51:31] ending it god was shutting it down
[1:51:34] oh holiday the same way oh caiaphas rent
[1:51:37] his clothes
[1:51:38] it's the same way that the veil in the
[1:51:40] temple was
[1:51:41] ran from top to bottom forever
[1:51:44] abolishing
[1:51:45] that old structure forever abolishing
[1:51:48] that old way to lead
[1:51:51] to the new king priests the royal
[1:51:54] priests
[1:51:55] the kingdom of priests sons who were
[1:51:58] kings and priests
[1:52:00] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:04] and it's reinforced reinforced through
[1:52:07] scripture
[1:52:08] oh hallelujah could you take some more
[1:52:12] then we're gonna pull some pieces
[1:52:13] together in jeremiah 31 31 behold the
[1:52:17] days come say the lord
[1:52:19] that i will make a new covenant with the
[1:52:21] house of israel
[1:52:22] and with the house of judah hallelujah
[1:52:26] a new covenant with the house of israel
[1:52:28] and the house of judah
[1:52:30] even it's picked up in a new testament
[1:52:32] that jesus didn't come
[1:52:34] as expected at all because priests came
[1:52:36] from the tribe of levi
[1:52:38] not just from the tribe of levi but the
[1:52:41] order of priesthood
[1:52:42] was the the ironic order sons of iran
[1:52:45] but jesus was not from the tribe of
[1:52:47] levite he was from the tribe of judah
[1:52:49] so god made it possible for a high
[1:52:52] priest to sit
[1:52:53] who was not a levite making it possible
[1:52:56] for gentiles
[1:52:57] to sit as priests
[1:53:02] oh i don't know if you're catching this
[1:53:04] this morning oh hallelujah
[1:53:07] listen to jeremiah behold the days come
[1:53:09] say the lord
[1:53:10] that i will make a new covenant with the
[1:53:12] house of israel
[1:53:13] and with the house of judah not
[1:53:15] according to the covenant
[1:53:17] that i made with their fathers in the
[1:53:20] day i took them by the hand
[1:53:22] to bring them out of the land of egypt
[1:53:24] which my covenant they break
[1:53:26] although i was an husband unto them
[1:53:28] sayeth the lord
[1:53:30] but this shall be the covenant that i
[1:53:32] will make with the house of israel
[1:53:34] after those days seared the lord i will
[1:53:37] put listen now
[1:53:38] before this the law was outside but i
[1:53:41] will put my law
[1:53:42] in their inward paths hallelujah so
[1:53:46] we're not talking about the
[1:53:47] written on the on the ten commandments
[1:53:49] not written outside but the inward parts
[1:53:52] and write it in their hearts oh god help
[1:53:55] us this morning
[1:53:56] and we'll be their god and they shall be
[1:53:59] my people
[1:54:00] hallelujah the covenant will switch from
[1:54:03] an external covenant
[1:54:04] to an eternal covenant written on your
[1:54:07] heart
[1:54:08] so if your hand not there your heart
[1:54:10] still have it
[1:54:11] if you lose your head your heart still
[1:54:13] have it you could be crippled this
[1:54:15] morning
[1:54:15] but in your heart the covenant is more
[1:54:18] powerful
[1:54:19] so that your gray hair could turn back
[1:54:22] black
[1:54:22] because the covenant is in your heart
[1:54:25] it's deep in your soul
[1:54:28] [Applause]
[1:54:29] hallelujah but this shall be the
[1:54:33] covenant
[1:54:34] that i will make with the house of
[1:54:35] israel after those days said the lord
[1:54:38] i personal singular pronoun will put my
[1:54:41] law
[1:54:42] it will not be a minister to do it i
[1:54:45] will put my law
[1:54:46] in their inward parts and write it in
[1:54:49] their hearts
[1:54:50] and will be their god and they shall be
[1:54:53] my people
[1:54:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:54:58] hallelujah
[1:54:59] glory everybody feeling fine

[1:55:08] scriptures we get it through the prophet
[1:55:09] right

[1:55:13] we know these things but when you when
[1:55:15] you when the holy spirit comes and
[1:55:17] and the great scientist begins to mix
[1:55:20] this thing together
[1:55:21] i'm beginning to show you rightly
[1:55:23] divining the word for your season
[1:55:24] so you can understand that there's no
[1:55:26] accident with god there's no
[1:55:27] mistake with god there's no there's no
[1:55:30] by chance and hope you're making it
[1:55:32] god because of his covenant always makes
[1:55:36] his word
[1:55:36] come to pass can the church say amen oh
[1:55:39] hallelujah
[1:55:40] now we're going to the new testament now
[1:55:43] amber ibrahim brought our testament is
[1:55:45] covenant so the new testament itself is
[1:55:47] the new covenant
[1:55:49] and the new covenant is the holy ghost
[1:55:52] hallelujah christ himself the hope of
[1:55:54] glory
[1:55:55] living in you the bride to her husband
[1:55:58] the continuation of the ministry of
[1:56:01] jesus christ

[1:56:16] and a worldly sanctuary for there was a
[1:56:19] tabernacle made
[1:56:21] the first wearing was the candlestick
[1:56:23] and the table and the shoe bread
[1:56:25] which is called a sanctuary and after
[1:56:28] the second veil the tabernacle which is
[1:56:30] called the holiest of all
[1:56:33] which had the golden censor and the ark
[1:56:36] of the covenant
[1:56:37] overlaid roundabout with gold wearing
[1:56:39] was the golden pot that had manner
[1:56:41] and aaron's rod that budded and the
[1:56:43] tables of the covenant
[1:56:45] speaking of the ark of the covenant as
[1:56:47] you see and over at the cherubims of
[1:56:49] glory
[1:56:50] shadow in the mercy seat of which we
[1:56:53] cannot now
[1:56:53] speak particularly know when these
[1:56:56] things were thus ordained in other words
[1:56:58] paul is saying to the hebrews when these
[1:57:00] things were put in place
[1:57:02] hallelujah the priests went always into
[1:57:05] the first tabernacle
[1:57:07] accomplished in the service of god but
[1:57:10] into the second when the high priest
[1:57:12] alone
[1:57:13] once every year not without blood which
[1:57:16] he offered for himself
[1:57:18] and for the errors of the people the
[1:57:21] holy ghost
[1:57:22] this signifying that the way into the
[1:57:25] holy years of all
[1:57:26] was not yet made manifest
[1:57:30] wild as the first tabernacle was yet
[1:57:32] standing
[1:57:34] in other words the paul is saying that
[1:57:36] there was a way
[1:57:38] into the holiest of all but it was not
[1:57:41] made clear
[1:57:43] while this first system was in place
[1:57:46] that in order for this new way to access
[1:57:48] the holiness of holies to be made
[1:57:50] possible
[1:57:51] the old system had to crumble the whole
[1:57:54] system had to feel
[1:57:56] which verse nine was a figure or a
[1:57:59] shadow
[1:58:00] for the time then present in which were
[1:58:02] offered both gifts and sacrifices
[1:58:05] that could not make him that did the
[1:58:08] service perfect
[1:58:09] in other words this whole action of
[1:58:11] sacrifice under the old covenant
[1:58:13] could never make you perfect when the
[1:58:17] sacrifice was done you were clean but
[1:58:19] you were never perfect
[1:58:21] but the ministry for this bride to be
[1:58:24] able to
[1:58:24] call up the sleeping scenes requires
[1:58:27] perfection
[1:58:28] and in order for perfection to be
[1:58:30] possible the old system had to be
[1:58:32] abolished
[1:58:33] can the church say amen
[1:58:36] as pertaining to the conscious which
[1:58:39] stood only in meat and drinks and divers
[1:58:41] washings and cardinal
[1:58:43] and carnal ordinances imposing them
[1:58:45] until the
[1:58:46] until the time of reformation but verse
[1:58:49] 11
[1:58:49] but christ being come and high priest
[1:58:53] listen of good things to come in other
[1:58:56] words even when christ
[1:58:58] came he was a high priest speaking of
[1:59:00] good things to come
[1:59:02] that's why it's the unfolding of the new
[1:59:05] covenant
[1:59:05] because when jesus came he was pointing
[1:59:08] that better there's a quote by the bible
[1:59:09] better better things hallelujah
[1:59:14] but christ come being a high priest of
[1:59:16] good things to come
[1:59:18] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1:59:22] not made with hands in other words but
[1:59:25] that is the scene not of this building
[1:59:28] paul is saying
[1:59:29] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:59:32] but listen by his own blood he entered
[1:59:36] in once
[1:59:37] into the holy place having obtained
[1:59:40] eternal redemption for us
[1:59:42] i want to read that one more time
[1:59:46] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:59:49] but by
[1:59:49] his own blood he entered in once
[1:59:53] into the holy place having obtained
[1:59:56] eternal redemption for us
[1:59:59] so in the old days the high priest had
[2:00:01] to go in with blood
[2:00:04] jesus as the high priest had to go in
[2:00:07] with blood also
[2:00:10] but he went in with his own blood i want
[2:00:12] you to catch that for a minute
[2:00:13] in other words without his own blood
[2:00:17] he himself could not have offered up the
[2:00:20] sacrifice oh
[2:00:21] this is you see this
[2:00:26] so his own blood listen it is by
[2:00:29] his own blood his blood was the password
[2:00:32] for him to get in
[2:00:34] and if his blood was the password for
[2:00:37] him to get in
[2:00:38] how much is his blood the password for
[2:00:40] you and i
[2:00:42] to enter in you see that
[2:00:46] if it's good for him if it's good for
[2:00:48] paul if it's good for silas
[2:00:50] if it's good for peter if it's good for
[2:00:52] brother branham if it's good for daniel
[2:00:54] if it's good it's good enough for me
[2:00:56] there's power in this wonder working
[2:00:58] blood oh hallelujah everybody with me
[2:01:02] this morning
[2:01:04] he entered in once once by his own
[2:01:08] blood
[2:01:11] he entered in once into the holy place
[2:01:15] having obtained eternal redemption for
[2:01:18] us
[2:01:20] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[2:01:21] and the ashes of an heifer
[2:01:23] sprinkling the unclean sanctify it to
[2:01:26] the purifying of the flesh
[2:01:28] how much more shall the blood of christ
[2:01:31] who true the eternal spirit offered
[2:01:33] himself without spot to god
[2:01:36] purge your conscience from dead works to
[2:01:38] serve the living god
[2:01:39] and for this course he's the mediator of
[2:01:42] the new testament or the new covenant
[2:01:44] that by means of death for the
[2:01:46] redemption of the transgression that
[2:01:47] were under the first testament
[2:01:49] day which accord might receive the
[2:01:51] promise of eternal
[2:01:52] inheritance everybody feeling fine
[2:01:56] could you take a little more let me kind
[2:01:57] of try to find a place to wrap this
[2:01:59] together
[2:02:01] so we read it just laying it here
[2:02:05] you understand your promise you
[2:02:06] understand the journey you understand
[2:02:08] your ministry
[2:02:09] and understand how christ made it
[2:02:10] possible for you to step into your
[2:02:13] position
[2:02:14] and how true the ministry after christ
[2:02:17] through the church ages
[2:02:18] was unfolding the full clarity of the
[2:02:21] word
[2:02:22] so that he would understand what has
[2:02:23] been happening all along
[2:02:25] can the church say amen first peter 2 5

[2:05:42] priesthood
[2:05:45] take your position
[2:05:48] a priest had to live a certain way
[2:05:52] in the old testament you have to live a
[2:05:54] certain way as a priest
[2:05:56] you're gonna live the way you want to
[2:05:59] you couldn't go where you wanted to go
[2:06:00] you couldn't dress how you wanted to
[2:06:01] dress you couldn't act like how you
[2:06:03] wanted to act we read it in leviticus
[2:06:07] the high priest couldn't even rent his
[2:06:08] garment
[2:06:10] he couldn't uncover his head there
[2:06:12] things he could not do if he was gonna
[2:06:13] stay in office
[2:06:17] now we are challenged as royal priests
[2:06:20] if you want to stay in your office you
[2:06:22] have to live a certain way
[2:06:24] you have to conduct yourself a certain
[2:06:26] way you have to speak a certain way
[2:06:28] your nature your being your attributes

[2:06:39] and holy nation holy
[2:06:42] holy god is holy
[2:06:46] i was sharing with somebody yesterday
[2:06:47] you know when you write an exam
[2:06:50] many examining bodies they mark on
[2:06:53] something they call the curve
[2:06:55] they take all the exams and they see and
[2:06:57] get a point where
[2:06:59] to get a certain percentage to pass so
[2:07:01] so somebody passed mark might move from
[2:07:03] year to year
[2:07:04] one year is 80 percent the next year is
[2:07:06] 85 percent the next year 77
[2:07:08] but i said not with god his past mark
[2:07:11] has
[2:07:12] never moved he said i am holy be holy i
[2:07:16] am holy oh hallelujah i took your place
[2:07:19] so you could take my place oh we were
[2:07:22] the ones to die but he took our sins
[2:07:24] upon him
[2:07:25] so that we could take his place and
[2:07:27] become his righteousness
[2:07:29] oh hallelujah what manner of conduct
[2:07:32] must we have
[2:07:34] but we are a chosen generation a royal
[2:07:37] priesthood
[2:07:38] and holy nation a peculiar people
[2:07:41] that ye should show forth the praises of
[2:07:44] him
[2:07:45] who had called you out of darkness into
[2:07:48] his marvelous light which in times
[2:07:51] past were not a people in other words
[2:07:53] this wasn't
[2:07:54] always the case that you were chosen
[2:07:56] this was not always the case
[2:07:58] but which in time passed were not a
[2:07:59] people but are now
[2:08:01] the people of god which had not obtained
[2:08:04] mercy
[2:08:05] but now have obtained mercy oh
[2:08:08] may the lord bless the reading of his
[2:08:10] word you feeling fine let me try to find
[2:08:11] a place to close out
[2:08:13] i do have a few more oh
[2:08:16] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:19] hallelujah
[2:08:20] oh my my my my so much so much
[2:08:25] oh hallelujah
[2:08:28] oh my my my my my
[2:08:32] that's one of the scripture i want to
[2:08:33] leave with you i know so many people
[2:08:35] you don't spend time in the world enough
[2:08:37] to know where your confidence and
[2:08:38] strength comes from
[2:08:40] but if you get them you understand it
[2:08:41] and you know because like jesus said it
[2:08:43] is written it is written is also written
[2:08:44] you need to be prepared to respond
[2:08:46] because the enemy will not let this word
[2:08:48] come to you
[2:08:48] and leave you alone with it he's going
[2:08:50] to come and test you and challenge you
[2:08:52] and you have to be prepared because
[2:08:54] there's war you are kings also not just
[2:08:57] priests and as a king you have to
[2:08:58] declare war when the time comes for war
[2:09:01] hallelujah hebrews 7
[2:09:04] 11 if therefore perfection
[2:09:07] and we read it before that if the old
[2:09:10] system was going to lead to perfection
[2:09:12] he wouldn't need
[2:09:12] this new system all right so here
[2:09:15] in hebrews now hebrews 11 if
[2:09:19] hebrews 7 verse 11 if therefore
[2:09:21] perfection
[2:09:22] were by the levitical priesthood
[2:09:26] for under it the people received the law
[2:09:29] so all the levitical priests could have
[2:09:31] given was
[2:09:32] law what further need
[2:09:36] paul says was therefore another priest
[2:09:39] should rise after the order of
[2:09:40] melchizedek and not be called after the
[2:09:43] order of aaron
[2:09:44] for the priesthood being changed
[2:09:46] hallelujah
[2:09:48] thank god for the change in the
[2:09:49] priesthood there is made of necessity
[2:09:52] as a result of this a change also of the
[2:09:54] law
[2:09:55] for he of whom these things are spoken
[2:09:58] pertaining to another tribe
[2:10:00] hallelujah of which no man gave
[2:10:02] attendance at the altar
[2:10:04] so paul is saying that this man we're
[2:10:07] talking about
[2:10:09] hallelujah came from another tribe of
[2:10:11] which before him
[2:10:13] nobody from the tribe of judah ever
[2:10:16] gave attendance to the altar ever served
[2:10:19] in this capacity
[2:10:20] before jesus was breaking multiple
[2:10:23] records
[2:10:24] to pave the way for those who come after
[2:10:27] him
[2:10:27] to also break their own records he was
[2:10:30] making it possible
[2:10:31] for you and i to be what nobody thought
[2:10:34] we could be
[2:10:35] to do what nobody thought you could do
[2:10:37] can the church say amen
[2:10:40] verse 14. for it is evident that our
[2:10:43] lord sprang out of judah
[2:10:46] hallelujah of which tribe moses speak
[2:10:50] nothing concerning priesthood you see it
[2:10:52] it's there it's written it's all there
[2:10:55] everything i'm saying is in there he
[2:10:58] said judah
[2:10:59] was never the tribe of priests but our
[2:11:01] lord sprung out of judah
[2:11:03] and you sprung out the maraval you
[2:11:05] sprung out a port of spain
[2:11:07] you sprung out of your country into that
[2:11:09] line of priesthood
[2:11:11] your father wasn't a priest your
[2:11:13] grandfather wasn't a priest
[2:11:14] but you the elect of god
[2:11:18] the chosen of god the royal seed of
[2:11:21] abraham
[2:11:22] royal priesthood royal priesthood
[2:11:25] royal priesthood royal priesthood
[2:11:28] peculiar people
[2:11:29] holy nation chosen generation
[2:11:32] that's who you are
[2:11:37] hallelujah my mom made me move on this
[2:11:40] just so much so much so much so much
[2:11:43] oh hallelujah oh my my my i'll skip here
[2:11:48] in the token

[2:12:02] requirement for us

[2:12:33] exam
[2:12:34] for us we if we took it we would have
[2:12:36] failed the exam
[2:12:38] but he took the exam for us that god
[2:12:41] required
[2:12:42] to make us back truly sons and daughters
[2:12:45] of god
[2:12:45] under the blood where there is no more

[2:14:44] deliverance and make the promise
[2:14:46] to cover what already happened in his
[2:14:48] mind you know

[2:14:54] promises made made his past tenser

[2:15:22] walk
[2:15:22] science flying when you walk signs
[2:15:24] following oh come on now
[2:15:26] are you with me what doing what
[2:15:27] confirming the word everywhere they went
[2:15:30] confirming the word with signs and
[2:15:31] wonders i'm trying to close out
[2:15:33] somewhere
[2:15:34] the new testament is a new covenant in
[2:15:36] his blood the bible said so
[2:15:38] the new testament means a new covenant
[2:15:40] blood life
[2:15:42] new life talking in us where the all
[2:15:44] blood stood
[2:15:45] for a simple sign of the chemistry
[2:15:48] that the lamb had died listen the holy
[2:15:51] ghost is the life
[2:15:52] that was in the person of jesus christ
[2:15:56] that's displayed in you and i i don't
[2:15:58] know how much clearer this is
[2:16:01] he said the holy ghost is the life that
[2:16:04] was in the person of jesus christ
[2:16:07] that's displayed in you and i tonight
[2:16:11] he said outside of that there is no
[2:16:13] mercy
[2:16:14] only when i see the blood i'll pass over
[2:16:18] you
[2:16:18] but abraham goes on he's pushing now
[2:16:20] he's touring and
[2:16:22] may your heart still today i'm trying to
[2:16:24] press upon your minds friends
[2:16:26] that the hour has struck that something
[2:16:29] has got to be done by
[2:16:30] it we must do something it's either in
[2:16:33] or out
[2:16:34] that's all there's only two positions in
[2:16:36] or out that's all
[2:16:37] the hour has come where the token must
[2:16:40] be there
[2:16:41] if this church ever expects to remain
[2:16:45] alive until jesus christ comes the token
[2:16:48] will have to be here that's all this
[2:16:52] puts an
[2:16:52] end to doctrine this puts an end to
[2:16:54] mysteries that puts an
[2:16:56] end to revelation there's one equal sign
[2:16:58] however you do the calculation
[2:17:01] make sure that the equal sign is the
[2:17:03] token
[2:17:04] whether you take this route whether you
[2:17:06] show your workings or not
[2:17:08] make sure that when it equals it equals
[2:17:11] the token
[2:17:16] the token will have to be here that's
[2:17:18] all
[2:17:22] and you better really better branham
[2:17:24] said have the token shining
[2:17:26] but he always here for the exodus and
[2:17:29] this time we're going to a promised
[2:17:31] land the promise of eternal life
[2:17:34] the token shows that jesus christ the
[2:17:37] holy ghost shows that jesus has met
[2:17:39] every requirement for us listen that we
[2:17:42] are
[2:17:42] in our nature fallen sons of god
[2:17:45] and we have no power within us we have
[2:17:47] no life within us
[2:17:49] we are a fallen race of people from adam
[2:17:51] but when
[2:17:52] listen we can display the token that the
[2:17:55] word
[2:17:56] and we become the same shows that jesus
[2:17:59] christ
[2:18:00] met the requirement for our sin and
[2:18:02] death and has displayed his token within
[2:18:04] us
[2:18:05] oh how simple it can be
[2:18:09] you are condemned we were all condemned
[2:18:12] there is no way to save ourselves and
[2:18:14] god sent us a token
[2:18:15] he killed his son at calvary for us
[2:18:19] and the life that was in that blood when
[2:18:21] it was shed at calvary has come back
[2:18:24] to be a token upon us god's everlasting
[2:18:27] eternal token
[2:18:29] it's eternal life by the eternal god
[2:18:33] and anything that had a beginning has an
[2:18:35] end and everything had a beginning
[2:18:37] besides
[2:18:38] god and god is the only form of eternal
[2:18:40] life there is
[2:18:41] and when god places his holy spirit in
[2:18:45] you
[2:18:45] i'm connecting completely to what
[2:18:47] brother was preaching and when god
[2:18:49] places his holy spirit in you which is
[2:18:52] god and when god places himself within
[2:18:54] you
[2:18:54] you as eternal as god is because you're
[2:18:57] a part of him
[2:18:58] because you become a son or a daughter
[2:19:00] of god and you are displaying his word
[2:19:03] hallelujah
[2:19:04] i feel religious that's true god
[2:19:06] identifies it himself
[2:19:08] you've got eternal life and that's
[2:19:10] according you
[2:19:11] and this world is god and that word
[2:19:14] lives and produces itself just exactly
[2:19:17] what god has ordained for this age you
[2:19:19] have it amen the holy ghost
[2:19:21] the holy spirit be in this place yes sir
[2:19:23] what is it
[2:19:24] the holy spirit the word has been
[2:19:25] quickened to you by the holy spirit to
[2:19:28] vindicate this age
[2:19:29] that you have passed from debt unto life
[2:19:32] and now you are his
[2:19:34] oh because he is we have the right
[2:19:38] the right to already purchase for us
[2:19:40] every promise in the bible is yours
[2:19:42] it belongs to you when this token is
[2:19:45] upon you
[2:19:46] or he didn't think it was going to end
[2:19:47] up here it's always about a token huh
[2:19:51] when this token is upon you and god has
[2:19:53] sealed you
[2:19:55] now we want to check ourselves just for
[2:19:57] a moment listen now
[2:19:59] when god has given you i'm reading the
[2:20:01] prophet when god has given you the true
[2:20:04] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:20:06] notice the use of the word true the fact
[2:20:09] that the prophet would use the word true
[2:20:11] means he is dealing with defaults and
[2:20:14] he's identifying that there's truth and
[2:20:16] false
[2:20:17] so when god has given you the true
[2:20:19] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:20:20] then the life of jesus christ is within
[2:20:23] you
[2:20:24] so it will mean that if it is not the
[2:20:26] truth then
[2:20:27] it is the false because the life not
[2:20:30] showing in you
[2:20:35] everybody with me and every theologian
[2:20:39] will have to admit that to be
[2:20:40] yes sir it's a new birth you are born
[2:20:43] anew
[2:20:44] of the holy ghost and because god has
[2:20:46] did this
[2:20:47] and you know you're no good in yourself
[2:20:50] and you accept what god has did
[2:20:52] then he seals you into his kingdom by
[2:20:54] the holy spirit
[2:20:56] and everything that jesus purchased and
[2:20:58] promised you
[2:20:59] in the bible is yours it's your property
[2:21:02] because it's painful i want you to get
[2:21:03] this prince

[2:21:06] to pick up some stuff some tiles some

[2:22:57] for himself you know he doesn't need

[2:24:05] out
[2:24:05] oh hallelujah but abraham here said
[2:24:10] oh hallelujah hallelujah the old
[2:24:12] covenant
[2:24:13] had divine healing how much more has the
[2:24:16] new covenant got
[2:24:18] if the old covenant produced it what
[2:24:20] about the new one
[2:24:21] when it's a much difficult it's a much
[2:24:24] better covenant
[2:24:25] speak of better higher things greater
[2:24:28] things
[2:24:29] better things the new covenant oh glory
[2:24:31] to god
[2:24:32] this is what god kept for us and now
[2:24:35] because of a prophet
[2:24:36] we have the fullness of the revelation
[2:24:38] of what this
[2:24:39] new covenant is what is it higher things
[2:24:43] greater things better things the new
[2:24:46] covenant
[2:24:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:24:50] hallelujah
[2:24:52] oh listen now like cornelius
[2:24:56] the we spoke about cornelius right the
[2:24:59] covenant was in place
[2:25:00] but the covenant had to be confirmed
[2:25:03] powerful
[2:25:04] so as much as cornelius was praying
[2:25:07] he had to wait until god sent someone to
[2:25:10] him
[2:25:11] to confirm the covenant to him
[2:25:14] by releasing the holy ghost
[2:25:18] as peter yet spake these words the holy
[2:25:20] ghost could fall upon him
[2:25:22] but the new covenant was already in
[2:25:23] effect because if there was no new
[2:25:25] covenant then cornelius as a gentile
[2:25:27] would have no chance
[2:25:28] but because the new covenant was in
[2:25:30] effect it is not just
[2:25:32] know about a new covenant is about the
[2:25:33] confirmation of the new covenant to you
[2:25:36] so i don't want you to leave this
[2:25:38] service talking about the edit the new
[2:25:39] covenant but the new covenant has to be
[2:25:41] confirmed to you
[2:25:43] in the form of your healing in the form
[2:25:45] of the deliverance of your children
[2:25:46] that's confirming the new covenant to
[2:25:48] you the baptism of the holy ghost come
[2:25:50] from the covenant to
[2:25:52] you where did the prophet say it listen
[2:25:56] jehovah jireh now we'll finish that in
[2:25:58] the scripture this week to prove that to
[2:26:00] you
[2:26:01] that this covenant listen has to be
[2:26:03] confirmed
[2:26:04] with the royal seed of abraham which are
[2:26:07] the people out of the gentiles not jews
[2:26:10] that recruit hallelujah so
[2:26:13] you see you are all true scripture you
[2:26:16] are all through the word
[2:26:18] god designed it this way put things in
[2:26:20] place
[2:26:21] that there's no way you could miss it a
[2:26:23] people out of the gentiles
[2:26:25] for his name's sake taking it for his
[2:26:28] name in the messenger jehovah gyra
[2:26:31] i'm about to close and until he see how
[2:26:34] the prophet operated and how the prophet
[2:26:36] understood what he was operating under
[2:26:40] in jehovah jared that same message he
[2:26:43] said do you believe
[2:26:44] he is confirming the covenant and he's
[2:26:47] ministering now

[2:29:03] to a chosen generation a royal
[2:29:06] priesthood
[2:29:07] holy nation a peculiar people
[2:29:10] just two more quotes in the exposition

[2:29:15] don't fear john don't fail at the flock
[2:29:18] all that i am you are here too all that
[2:29:22] i
[2:29:22] am belongs to you it's yours church it's

[2:29:50] that

[2:29:55] glory to god oh my last quote
[2:29:58] i made it with anthony
[2:30:02] from the token it's an everlasting
[2:30:05] covenant
[2:30:06] he said why was that called eternal
[2:30:08] covenant
[2:30:09] because it wouldn't be eternal when
[2:30:11] we're redeemed it's all over then
[2:30:13] it's an everlasting covenant which means
[2:30:16] certain amount of time till time is out
[2:30:18] there'll never be another one when time
[2:30:21] runs out we won't need no more covenant
[2:30:24] oh we are counting down to the last few
[2:30:27] seconds
[2:30:28] to blend from time to eternity and when
[2:30:30] that zero always struck
[2:30:32] and time is run out there's no more
[2:30:35] covenant needed
[2:30:36] because we blend from time with eternity
[2:30:39] and only perfect love will take you over
[2:30:41] there
[2:30:42] mrs jesus christ church of the living
[2:30:45] god may god bless you
[2:30:47] and may god continue to unfold the
[2:30:49] mystery of this new covenant to you
