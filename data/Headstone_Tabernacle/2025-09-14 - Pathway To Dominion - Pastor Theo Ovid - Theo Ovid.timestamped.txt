[25:10] within me.
[25:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[25:18] Blessed be your name this morning, Lord.
[25:21] We bless you. We worship you. We glorify
[25:23] your name this morning. There's no place
[25:26] we rather be into your house this
[25:27] morning. Jesus, we give you worship. We
[25:30] give you honor. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[25:33] Blessed be his wonderful name. Are you
[25:35] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[25:36] this morning? Let's give Lord the
[25:39] praise. Amen.
[25:43] Amen.
[25:46] Bibles this morning. Let's stud.
[25:52] Amen.
[25:56] From verses 1 to 12, from Psalm 103, it
[25:59] says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[26:03] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[26:06] is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless
[26:10] the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all
[26:12] his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[26:14] iniquities, who health all thy diseases,
[26:18] who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[26:21] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[26:24] and tender mercies, who satisfied thy
[26:27] mouth with good things, so that thy
[26:29] youth is renewed like the eagles. The
[26:32] Lord executed righteousness and judgment
[26:34] for all that are oppressed. He made
[26:37] known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto
[26:40] the children of Israel. The Lord is
[26:42] merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
[26:45] piercing. He will not all his child,
[26:47] neither will he keep his anger forever.
[26:51] He had not dealt with us after our sins,
[26:55] nor rewarded us according to our
[26:58] iniquities.
[27:00] For as high as the heaven is above the
[27:02] earth, so great is his mercy towards
[27:05] them that fear him. As far as the east
[27:07] is from the west, so far that they
[27:11] remove our transgressions from us. Amen.
[27:14] May the Lord a blessing to the word.
[27:16] Let's just bow our heads as we play the
[27:19] song in the highest. Let the king come.
[27:23] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[27:25] grace. We thank you for your mercy. We
[27:27] thank you, Lord, for bringing us here
[27:29] this morning, Lord, to gather in your
[27:30] name in one mind and one accord. Lord,
[27:33] you see where the twos and trees are
[27:35] gathered in your name. Dare you in the
[27:37] midst, Lord. Come down in the midst and
[27:38] bless. Come down in the midst and heal.
[27:40] Come to limits of us and deliver Lord
[27:43] each and every heart. Touch each and
[27:44] every heart this morning. We have a
[27:46] longing for you this morning. A longing
[27:48] for more of you Lord Jesus Christ. Have
[27:50] your perfect way of service in the
[27:52] precious name of Jesus Christ I pray.

[48:01] &gt;&gt; I greet you this morning in the precious
[48:03] name of Jesus Christ. I am not the
[48:05] preacher. Uh but I do want to greet you
[48:08] this morning.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; And before you take your seats, I just
[48:12] want to read one scripture.
[48:14] Um St. John 5,
[48:18] a very familiar scripture, but there's
[48:19] something in there I want to pick up as
[48:22] part of the greeting this morning. St.
[48:23] In John 5 from verse one,
[48:26] after this there was a feast of the Jews
[48:30] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[48:33] Now there is a Jerusalem by the sheep
[48:35] market a pool which is called in the
[48:37] Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[48:39] porches. In these lay a great multitude
[48:42] of impotent folk of blind halt withered
[48:46] waiting for the moving of the water. For
[48:49] an angel went down at a certain season
[48:50] into the pool, and troubled the water,
[48:53] whosoever then first after the troubling
[48:55] of the water, stepped in, was made whole
[48:57] of whatsoever disease he had. And a
[49:00] certain man was there, which had an
[49:02] infirmity 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw
[49:05] him lie, and knew that he had been now a
[49:08] long time in that case, he saith unto
[49:11] him, Willil thou be made whole? The
[49:13] impotent man answered him, "Sir, I have
[49:16] no man when the water is troubled to put
[49:19] me into the pool. But while I am coming,
[49:22] another stepeth down before me." Jesus
[49:25] saith unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed,
[49:27] and walked. And immediately the man was
[49:29] made whole, and took up his bed, and
[49:31] walked. And on the same day was the
[49:33] Sabbath." May the Lord add a blessing to
[49:34] the reading of his word. You may be
[49:36] seated in the presence of the Lord.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the precious name of the
[49:41] Lord Jesus Christ. It's certainly good
[49:42] to be back home. There's no place like
[49:44] home. God bless you, church.
[49:47] I want to acknowledge our pastor Timothy
[49:49] Redhead that's here with us this
[49:51] morning. God bless you, brother Redhead
[49:52] and his sister in Jamaica. God bless
[49:55] you. Certainly happy to have you here
[49:56] with us in fellowship uh this morning.
[49:59] And brother Redhead will be preaching
[50:01] for us on Wednesday night, Lord willing.
[50:03] So make a great effort to be here in the
[50:05] house of the Lord on Wednesday night.
[50:07] And this week is a special week for us.
[50:10] Uh we also have a special weekend of
[50:12] services that's coming up uh this
[50:15] weekend on Saturday at 3:00 p.m. and two
[50:18] services this coming Sunday at 10:00
[50:21] a.m. and 4 p.m. And I know without a
[50:23] shadow of a doubt God has something in
[50:26] store for us in a really special way. So
[50:28] I greet you from Uganda and from the
[50:31] believers and the saints over in Uganda.
[50:34] They send their love. They sent their
[50:36] greetings to the church here in Henso
[50:37] Tabernacle and the believers here in
[50:39] Trinidad from brother Gideon Beckaso who
[50:42] was a host pastor of the meeting. There
[50:45] were
[50:47] more than maybe 40 50 ministers that
[50:49] were present from different churches
[50:51] from different countries. So it was held
[50:54] in Uganda but there were believers from
[50:56] Kenya, from Congo, from Rwanda. Um so
[51:00] just to name a few and there were 69
[51:04] churches represented in the meeting and
[51:06] it was quite something to see and I told
[51:09] the host pastor um the western world is
[51:12] not ready for this kind of convention
[51:14] and I'll tell you a bit more about it. I
[51:15] also bring greetings from all of the
[51:17] ministers also our precious brother John
[51:20] Chakone who I had fellowship with John
[51:22] Chakone as well and his son brother
[51:25] David who has his own church as well and
[51:27] brothers from Buna Congo who were there
[51:30] in Uganda as well and what a time in the
[51:32] presence of the Lord to see that all
[51:34] over the world the spirit is moving
[51:36] &gt;&gt; it was my first time in Uganda and I
[51:38] told him it felt at home and um so
[51:41] Uganda is is east Africa many of the
[51:43] meetings that I've been to have been on
[51:45] the western part of of Africa, Ghana,
[51:48] Nigeria, Ivory Coast, etc. But my first
[51:50] time in the east, and um you know, one
[51:53] of our deacons messaged me when he saw
[51:56] like the picture, he says, you know,
[51:57] take care with the heat and the
[51:58] dehydration. But that part of Africa is
[52:00] actually colder.
[52:02] So temperatures of 18° in the morning,
[52:05] 19°, so um the environment was was a
[52:09] wonderful environment. Um food and the
[52:12] culture very similar to us. I felt like
[52:14] I was in Tobago because the staple of a
[52:17] lot of the meals was what we call
[52:18] provision and plantin and dasheen and I
[52:20] was like wait a minute this structure
[52:22] the food here is a bit you know um
[52:24] interestingly I didn't see any fast food
[52:27] places except KFC. KFC was like the only
[52:29] one there but all the pizza place stuff
[52:32] we used to um Uganda is known for its
[52:35] agriculture. It's a it's big export and
[52:38] it's big economic driver is agriculture.
[52:40] So everything is organic and natural.
[52:42] And I told my wife, "It's the healthiest
[52:44] few days I've had in a very long time.
[52:46] Everything was healthy. The food was
[52:48] healthy. The food was, you know, but it
[52:50] was such a wonderful time to be with the
[52:52] believers and for the saints, you know."
[52:54] So, both in the in the natural, we we
[52:56] had a lot of healthy food, but the
[52:58] services, I have to tell you, um I've
[53:00] been in meetings all over. I've never
[53:02] been in one with this structure. Um over
[53:06] the days, which was have been Thursday
[53:08] night was the arrival. So Thursday,
[53:11] Friday, Saturday, Sunday and by Monday
[53:14] morning, I think there would have been
[53:16] about 17 services I think over those few
[53:19] days. So I messaged a few people and say
[53:21] we need to reook at our convention. I
[53:24] think we we have clearly too much space
[53:27] for it because I've never seen anything
[53:30] like it. You know the meeting started on
[53:31] Thursday night and um one of the pastors
[53:34] from Kenya, brother Guandaro, opened the
[53:36] meeting, a tremendous opening service on
[53:38] Thursday night. And then from Friday
[53:41] service was started at 5:00 a.m.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; So there was a 5:00 a.m. service. This
[53:46] was a they call it the morning glory.
[53:48] You know the host pastor say, you know,
[53:50] you have to wake up in the morning and
[53:51] start the day right. So 5:00 a.m. I
[53:54] thought it was going to be like a the
[53:56] morning devotion, read a psalm, sing a
[53:58] song. It was a fullblown service
[54:01] &gt;&gt; at 5:00 in the morning with the Clarons
[54:04] and that went from 5:00 to like 6:30 and
[54:07] then it was breakfast time and then the
[54:08] next service was 8:00.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; So 8:00 was fullblown preaching service
[54:13] that went to around 10:30 and then they
[54:16] said we can't stop now. Let's get ready
[54:18] for the next service. And just like that
[54:19] we swung into song service again for the
[54:22] third service. So it was two services
[54:24] back to back and then lunch and then
[54:26] next service that flowed into the next
[54:28] service. So I told them after the first
[54:32] day that we made it.
[54:37] We made it. And interestingly
[54:40] as we went in in the next day the exact
[54:42] same pattern. On Saturday was five
[54:44] services again. On Sunday was five
[54:47] services again. Um I ministered three
[54:50] times over the course of the services.
[54:52] Brother Jonathan Martin Julie
[54:53] ministering to us this weekend ahead of
[54:55] us also ministered three times in that
[54:57] meeting. Brother Maduka ministered three
[54:59] times in the meeting and then uh brother
[55:02] Guandaru from Kenya spoke twice and
[55:04] brother Jackson Kaha from Kenya spoke
[55:06] twice as well and then those morning
[55:08] glories were brothers from Congo and
[55:10] different things and everybody was on
[55:12] fire and the last service I have to tell
[55:14] you was jumping and shouting and
[55:16] praising like the first service.
[55:19] So I told the brothers, anything beyond
[55:21] this is rapture, you know,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; but it was such a tremendous time in the
[55:27] presence of the Lord with the worship
[55:28] and it was a youth focus meeting. There
[55:30] were about maybe around 800 or so young
[55:32] people there and it was such a blessing
[55:34] to see young people on fire for God
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and to see a passion for the word, a
[55:40] passion to be in the spirit and they're
[55:42] looking for something, looking for a
[55:43] true experience with God. So again, I
[55:46] wanted to give you a bit of a report
[55:48] that it was a good land. We look forward
[55:50] by the grace of God to being back there
[55:52] in Uganda again. And many of them would
[55:54] love to come here and be able to come
[55:56] for our convention as well as to come
[55:57] and fellowship. Um many of them know you
[55:59] from online. So they have seen you. So
[56:02] if they see you, they they would
[56:03] recognize they know you from on the
[56:04] streaming and and they send their love,
[56:06] their greetings, the song leaders, the
[56:08] ministers, the musicians, you know. So
[56:10] they feel as much a part of you as as
[56:13] when we go there and we are part of them
[56:14] as well. So once more let me greet you
[56:16] on their behalf and and may God richly
[56:18] bless you
[56:20] by the grace of God you know and on that
[56:25] note um while we were there um brother
[56:27] Jonathan Martin had preached and it was
[56:30] such a tremendous blessing and the Lord
[56:33] just connected us in such a special way
[56:34] in the spiritual realm that right away I
[56:37] I called brother Oid and we had a
[56:38] conversation and um you know by the
[56:41] grace of God we will have him here this
[56:44] weekend for us. And I know God has
[56:46] something special for us.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; God has servants of God everywhere.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And God has servants of God that are cut
[56:52] differently. And Belove preached a
[56:54] message recently uh I think around the
[56:56] end of the convention or thereabouts, um
[56:58] where he played a tape speaking about
[56:59] different administrations of the Holy
[57:01] Spirit.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And what I'm looking for personally is
[57:04] to see God call men around the world.
[57:06] God has men everywhere.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; No man could define who is in the fifold
[57:11] ministry. The five ministry is not
[57:13] defined by man. is defined by God.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; God is able to raise up individuals in
[57:17] the east, in the west, in the north, in
[57:19] the south, who could speak English,
[57:20] French, German, Spanish, or some
[57:21] language we've never heard before. But
[57:23] God is the one who is sovereign enough
[57:25] to choose and to pick and to confirm the
[57:27] word with signs, with wonders, with
[57:29] miracles, and with the opening of the
[57:30] word that has already been revealed by
[57:32] the prophet messenger Malachi 4. We
[57:34] don't bring our own message. It's a
[57:35] vindicated message. The message speaks
[57:37] for itself. It is already revealed,
[57:39] fully revealed. So we are happy to be
[57:41] identified with sons and daughters of
[57:43] gods all over the world
[57:45] &gt;&gt; that we may not have seen each other on
[57:47] this side before but when we come
[57:48] together there's a kindred spirit you
[57:50] recognize we were there we kick Lucifer
[57:52] out we had the representation by
[57:55] predestination before there was a bill
[57:57] before there was a mortgage before there
[57:58] was anything else and when we come here
[58:00] on this earth wait a minute we fought
[58:02] back to back there and we can fight back
[58:03] to back here again against sickness
[58:06] against doubt against unbelief against
[58:08] depression against your past, against
[58:10] your mistakes, against your failures,
[58:12] against the things you don't understand,
[58:13] against the losing of your identity. Can
[58:15] the church say amen?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So after the meeting,
[58:20] I had the opportunity to also preach
[58:22] last Wednesday night in the local church
[58:24] and we had quite a time in the presence
[58:27] of God and I was speaking about the the
[58:29] the divine mystery of your spiritual
[58:32] identity
[58:33] &gt;&gt; to recognize that nothing could change
[58:36] who you are. Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; You are born into a family. So with a
[58:40] punch, you are born in a punch.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Whether you wear a red shirt, a blue
[58:43] shirt, a green shirt, you can't change
[58:45] the family you're born into.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And if the devil understands that you
[58:48] are something, you are see his finger.
[58:50] But then then he cannot change who you
[58:52] are. But what he could try to do is make
[58:54] you forget who you are.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet speak on on
[58:57] on spiritual amnesia. Because if the
[58:59] devil could trick you into you are
[59:01] nobody and you're ordinary and you live
[59:03] your life under the privilege of this
[59:05] revealed word then that's on you. But
[59:07] the job of coming to church is for us to
[59:10] remind you that you are bigger than your
[59:11] problem. That the seed in you greater is
[59:13] he that's in you that he that's in the
[59:15] world. And this message came with your
[59:17] name on it and your past your mistakes
[59:19] your failures your ups and downs have
[59:21] nothing to do with the promise of God
[59:23] and the purpose of God concerning you.
[59:25] So that that's a reason to get comfort.
[59:27] But every service you see your name
[59:29] because your name is your
[59:30] identification. It's the mystery of who
[59:32] you are.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And your father can't stop it. Your
[59:36] problems can't stop it. Your mistakes
[59:38] can't stop it. Sickness cannot stop it.
[59:40] Nothing present, nothing past, nothing
[59:42] to come could separate you from the love
[59:44] of God in Christ Jesus. Because your
[59:46] name is not now being put in the book.
[59:48] Your name has always been there. Who we
[59:50] forneew he called. Who he call he
[59:52] justified. Who we justify, he hath
[59:55] already glorified. is written in the
[59:57] past tense. God is not picking people
[1:00:00] this morning. You were chosen before the
[1:00:02] foundation of the world. God is not now
[1:00:04] waking up looking to see who in
[1:00:06] Headstone Tabernacle or any tabernacle
[1:00:08] he could find. His fornowledge already
[1:00:11] put your name in the book.
[1:00:14] He knew you'd get the Holy Ghost. He
[1:00:16] knew you'd have a revival. He knew you
[1:00:18] would overcome. He knew that no weapon
[1:00:20] formed against you will prosper. He knew
[1:00:22] you would come to perfection. He knew
[1:00:24] you would walk away from sin. He knew
[1:00:26] you would be restored. He knew you would
[1:00:28] come to your senses. He knew you had a
[1:00:30] theophony. He knew the word body is
[1:00:32] coming. He had a church. Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; So, I'm excited because God is doing
[1:00:42] something. God is not a God of
[1:00:44] disappointment. He's a God of
[1:00:46] appointment. And I believe God has
[1:00:47] appointment with each of you this
[1:00:48] morning. Each of you on Wednesday night,
[1:00:51] each of you on Saturday service, each of
[1:00:52] you on this two services this coming
[1:00:54] Sunday. So don't miss it because I
[1:00:56] believe church time is short.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have too much time left.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening around the
[1:01:02] world
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; in the political realm, in the economic
[1:01:06] realm and all these things. And it's the
[1:01:07] government, it's this, it's the forex
[1:01:09] crisis, it's the US ships in the area
[1:01:11] and all these things.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Everything is getting into their place.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; But you know what? They can only do
[1:01:17] limited things until the bride gets into
[1:01:18] her place.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; God isn't waiting on them. He's waiting
[1:01:21] on you and I to come to a recognition of
[1:01:24] who they are. But the parent said the
[1:01:26] moment the bride gets to know who she
[1:01:28] is, then the rapture is going to go.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are coming here this
[1:01:33] morning to get a revelation of who we
[1:01:35] are in God. And because of who we are,
[1:01:37] what we are entitled to. Can the church
[1:01:38] say amen?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a good time to be a Christian.
[1:01:42] It's a good time to be on fire. It's a
[1:01:44] good time to put a smile on your face.
[1:01:46] It's a good time to spare your shoulders
[1:01:48] back. It's a good time to lift your head
[1:01:50] up. It's a good time to know your father
[1:01:52] is the king. It's a good time to know
[1:01:54] that all that the father had given me
[1:01:56] must come. Hallelujah. He's not going to
[1:01:58] lose one. He's not going to lose your
[1:01:59] daughter. He's not going to lose your
[1:02:01] son. He's going to put food in your
[1:02:02] table. He's going to fill you with the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost. He said, "I've never seen
[1:02:05] the righteous forsaken over beg."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; I'm almost ready before the pastor
[1:02:12] comes.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] So I want you to raise your expectation.
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; You need to ask God for big things.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "You get what you
[1:02:26] expect. If you expect a little bit, you
[1:02:28] get a little bit. You you want a little
[1:02:29] healing, you could get that. But I want
[1:02:31] to get big things."
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; But the Brandon said, "How could you
[1:02:34] have faith for the rapture if you can't
[1:02:35] have faith for divine healing?" Which
[1:02:37] means divine healing is on the journey
[1:02:38] to the rapture. You got to believe that
[1:02:41] the sickness in your body has got to go.
[1:02:44] It has got to go because he said how you
[1:02:46] can have faith for the rapture if you
[1:02:48] don't have faith for divine healing. So
[1:02:50] it means that rapture in faith is more
[1:02:52] than the faith for divine healing. It's
[1:02:54] got to be part of the journey. God is
[1:02:56] not going to rapture sick people. You're
[1:02:58] going to be healed before the rapture.
[1:03:02] You know what I said? This body change,
[1:03:05] there's a process. The rapture is from
[1:03:07] the inside out. On the journey to the
[1:03:10] rapture, oh, you're going to feel a
[1:03:12] charge in your body. The tiredness not
[1:03:14] going to affect you no more. That
[1:03:15] arritis got to go. Hyper pressure got to
[1:03:18] go. Female condition got to go.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; We still believe in miracles. We still
[1:03:28] believe in healing. We still believe in
[1:03:30] deliverance. We still believe in the
[1:03:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We still
[1:03:33] believe in a holy life. We still believe
[1:03:36] in the ability of the Holy Ghost to
[1:03:38] change a man from the inside out. Can
[1:03:40] the church say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Let me close out this greeting. I just
[1:03:47] want to greet you this morning. The
[1:03:48] pastor is going to preach. Are preaching
[1:03:49] the pastor this morning.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You read that scripture.
[1:03:58] And my wife shared something with me on
[1:04:00] this. You have to thank the Lord when
[1:04:03] you have a spiritual wife.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Spiritual husband,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; spiritual friends,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; who can have conversation not just about
[1:04:10] politics. and about the problems and
[1:04:13] about what the government do and it do.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; So we sitting there yesterday and she
[1:04:16] shared something with me and it just
[1:04:19] opened up
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; something that she heard and when I saw
[1:04:22] it I shared a bit with it with brother
[1:04:24] as well.
[1:04:26] This scripture we have preached this
[1:04:28] many times is a measure of faith. For 38
[1:04:31] years this man had kept coming
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; because he had a need
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and we preach keep coming because God is
[1:04:39] going to meet you.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; And that's true. That's powerful that at
[1:04:42] a certain season the angel will come and
[1:04:44] stir the water and whoever got into the
[1:04:46] water first
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; will get their healing. Yes.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; But there's something interesting in
[1:04:52] this and I want us to pay attention in
[1:04:54] this season to this. This man actually
[1:04:57] defined
[1:04:59] two problems.
[1:05:02] When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[1:05:04] had been now a long time in that case,
[1:05:06] he said unto him, "Wil thou be made
[1:05:08] whole?"
[1:05:09] And the man's response was, "I have no
[1:05:13] man when the water is troubled to put me
[1:05:17] into the pool."
[1:05:21] And it there's a question in this for us
[1:05:25] because here is a man who we cannot
[1:05:28] question his faithfulness
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; because he had proven over 38 years to
[1:05:34] be consistent in his faith that if he
[1:05:37] could get into the water, he would be
[1:05:38] healed. Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; So we cannot question his faithfulness.
[1:05:42] We cannot question his belief in healing
[1:05:44] because by his being present was
[1:05:47] evidence that he believed.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; But there's something that started to
[1:05:52] look and and my wife shared with me as a
[1:05:55] contrast to the crippled man or the lame
[1:05:58] man who had the four friends
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; who open up the roof
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; and they brought the sick man and
[1:06:06] dropped him in front of Jesus.
[1:06:09] And I wanted to contrast this for a
[1:06:11] minute between
[1:06:13] who helps you or who do you help
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; because there's a big difference between
[1:06:19] both men had a condition but one man had
[1:06:23] four friends
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; who made it their business to climb up
[1:06:28] the roof of the building open up the top
[1:06:31] while Jesus preaching and dropping this
[1:06:33] man in front of Jesus. Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Many of us don't realize at some point
[1:06:40] in time we all need help.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We could come to church and go back home
[1:06:48] and say, "Well, I don't want to talk to
[1:06:49] anybody,
[1:06:52] but it's important for you to build the
[1:06:54] right type of relationships.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It's important for you to invest." So, I
[1:06:58] asked myself the question, what was the
[1:07:00] difference between these two men?
[1:07:02] Because one of them had four friends.
[1:07:04] even though he could not help himself,
[1:07:06] they were willing to help him.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Do you have quality relationships with
[1:07:13] people that when you come to your
[1:07:16] crossroad, they would climb the roof of
[1:07:18] a building
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:07:23] I want to come back to this man at the
[1:07:24] pool of Bethesda because over 38 years
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; he had no friends.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And he had to tell Jesus, I have no man
[1:07:35] to help me.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible is a book that speaks of what
[1:07:41] we should do and what we should not do.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And in these two examples, we see two
[1:07:46] men who both had needs, who Jesus both
[1:07:49] ministered to and helped.
[1:07:53] But one was able to be helped even
[1:07:56] before Jesus helped
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; his four friends brought him to Jesus.
[1:08:01] And the other man was a different kind
[1:08:03] of struggle. I asked myself the
[1:08:04] question, did that man not have
[1:08:06] children,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; siblings,
[1:08:10] neighbors,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; co-workers?
[1:08:13] What kind of life do you live
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; that after 38 years of a declining
[1:08:19] situation
[1:08:21] there's nobody there to help you?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I want us to draw reference that in that
[1:08:26] room around that pool as it were there
[1:08:28] were people of different conditions.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Now I have seen people in hospitals and
[1:08:32] when you look at somebody say now boy
[1:08:34] your situation is worse than mine so you
[1:08:36] go first.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; This is the process of triage in a
[1:08:40] hospital. Nurses are trained to
[1:08:43] ascertain this is a level one emergency.
[1:08:46] This is a level five. You have a
[1:08:47] headache.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Your foot off your off your body.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; This is a different situation.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; So I asked myself the question over the
[1:08:55] course of 38 years
[1:08:57] did this man not build any conversation
[1:09:00] with anybody else who was there to even
[1:09:03] convince them you know my situation
[1:09:05] worse than yours.
[1:09:07] The reason I'm raising this is the
[1:09:10] reason God allowed churches to exist
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; is not just for people to come to hear
[1:09:14] the word alone, but it's also to build a
[1:09:17] network of support
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; because we all need help. When you think
[1:09:21] you are so strong, there will come a
[1:09:24] point when somebody needs to pray for
[1:09:26] you, lift you up, or as the case of the
[1:09:30] other example, carry you to church or
[1:09:33] you don't hear me this morning.
[1:09:36] So I want to take this I want to
[1:09:38] encourage the church. Don't have the
[1:09:40] mindset that well I come in the church
[1:09:43] and I when I get the word I go home
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; because that is how you build no
[1:09:47] connections.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; You build no relationship.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; So I want us to cherish the value of
[1:09:54] relationships
[1:09:56] and the right kind of relationship.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Not just doing it because you want help
[1:10:02] but just by helping somebody else. You
[1:10:05] don't even know what you will trigger in
[1:10:07] doing that.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet preacher
[1:10:11] with a church that Jesus in the church.
[1:10:13] A church that stick together. A church
[1:10:16] that the devil can't shake you. The
[1:10:17] church that gossip can't live in the
[1:10:19] church because everyone understand that
[1:10:21] it's some through the fire, some through
[1:10:23] the flood, but all through the blood. We
[1:10:25] go through a trial and testing. But when
[1:10:27] I'm weak, I need somebody to pray for
[1:10:29] me. I want to pray for you. You in
[1:10:31] trouble? Somebody help me.
[1:10:35] Can the church say amen? So I want you
[1:10:37] to look at that scripture again and
[1:10:40] study it. I prefer to be like the man
[1:10:43] who had the friends who take him through
[1:10:44] the roof
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; because I realize that in this world you
[1:10:47] cannot live alone.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; If God wanted you to live alone, he'd
[1:10:50] have been in a hill somewhere and God
[1:10:51] would speak to you himself. But God
[1:10:53] built a structure and he put a five-fold
[1:10:55] ministry in place and he have virtues
[1:10:57] that need to be tested. Even the virtue
[1:10:59] of brotherly kindness that could only be
[1:11:01] tested when you're around people. You
[1:11:03] can't test brother when you on a
[1:11:04] mountain by yourself, you on your home
[1:11:06] in Moses seat judging people and you not
[1:11:08] meeting nobody
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; because the virtue has to be tested by
[1:11:14] real life situations to see if you could
[1:11:16] handle stress, handle problem. The who
[1:11:19] you really are is only tested is only
[1:11:21] proven under the test.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; So listen. So God did heal both men,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; but I much rather live a life
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; that is connected to brethren.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Connected. There are many of us, we have
[1:11:36] more connections outside of church than
[1:11:38] in church.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; We have more connection with unbelievers
[1:11:42] than with believers.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You need a friend who will say you're
[1:11:46] going to church today.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You need somebody who say don't give up.
[1:11:49] You need somebody say that what you're
[1:11:50] wearing is not right. You know it's not
[1:11:52] right. You could do better. You need a
[1:11:53] friend who could push you onto
[1:11:55] perfection. Encourage one another unto
[1:11:58] love and good works. That's the word of
[1:11:59] God. Can the church say amen? Can we
[1:12:02] give the word a shout of praise? I'm
[1:12:04] finished. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:12:11] hallelujah.
[1:12:13] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, are
[1:12:16] you ready for the word this morning?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, you can come and sing a
[1:12:21] song before the pastor comes. God bless
[1:12:22] you, church. Love you and appreciate
[1:12:24] you.
[1:12:26] Amen. Push your but this morning.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; How I love you, Lord.
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:37] You're my all and all.
[1:12:43] I can see your face.

[1:12:47] your glory and your grace.
[1:12:53] And when you speak to me,

[1:13:50] Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] Just how I love
[1:13:55] how I love you, Jesus.
[1:13:57] How I love you, Lord.
[1:14:02] You're my only
[1:14:08] I can see your face,
[1:14:12] your glory and your grace
[1:14:17] and the way you speak to me.
[1:14:22] You set my spirit free
[1:14:28] words.
[1:14:30] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:14:33] That's how I just worship him this
[1:14:35] morning. How I love you, Jesus. Sing.
[1:14:38] How I love you, Lord.
[1:14:43] You're my only.
[1:14:48] I can see your face,
[1:14:53] your glory, and your grace.
[1:14:58] And when you speak to me,
[1:15:03] you set my spirit free.
[1:15:08] No words can never.
[1:15:12] Jesus,
[1:15:13] how I love you. One more time this
[1:15:17] morning. Jesus, how I love you, Lord.
[1:15:23] You're my only.
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] I can see your face.
[1:15:33] Your glory and your grace
[1:15:36] [Music]
[1:15:38] and the way you speak to me.
[1:15:43] You set my spirit free.

[1:15:53] I love you.
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:10] I see your face.
[1:16:12] The glory and your grace will be
[1:16:19] victorious.
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:35] How I love you.
[1:16:38] I love you, Lord.
[1:16:43] You're my only
[1:16:48] see
[1:16:52] the glory of your
[1:16:58] speak to me.
[1:17:02] You set my spirit free.
[1:17:07] Words can never tell
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] how I love you, Lord. Father, we praise
[1:17:16] you this morning. We thank you. We thank
[1:17:18] you for your presence. We thank you for
[1:17:20] your love. We thank you for this grace
[1:17:22] and your blood that give us this
[1:17:23] opportunity to access your presence. May
[1:17:25] you come down among us as we read your
[1:17:27] word. May you be with us in a special
[1:17:28] way. In Jesus name I ask it. God bless
[1:17:31] you. Welcome for blessed by the redhead.
[1:17:33] Praise God. Amen. Appreciate you. Um
[1:17:40] we want to turn our Bibles to Genesis
[1:17:42] chapter
[1:17:43] 1 verse 26 and 28 to 28. 1 John chapter
[1:17:48] 2 15-17.
[1:17:50] Revelation 5 1-10. Certainly appreciate
[1:17:54] brother Kelly South sharing with us
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; the things that belongs to us.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise the Lord.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Read in Genesis chapter 1 26-28.
[1:18:06] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:18:07] image after all likeness. Let him have
[1:18:10] dominion
[1:18:11] over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[1:18:13] of the air, over the cattle, over all
[1:18:15] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[1:18:18] that creepeth upon the earth." So God
[1:18:20] created man in his own image, in the
[1:18:23] image of God created he him, male and
[1:18:24] female created he them, and God blessed
[1:18:27] them. And God said unto them, "Be
[1:18:30] fruitful and multiply, replenish the
[1:18:32] earth, subdue it, and have dominion over
[1:18:34] the fish of the sea, over the fowl of
[1:18:36] the air, over every living thing that
[1:18:40] moveth upon the earth."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; 1 John chapter 2,
[1:18:46] reading from verse 15.
[1:18:52] Love not the world, neither the things
[1:18:55] that are in the world. If any man love
[1:18:58] the world, the love of the father is not
[1:19:00] in him. For all that is in the world,
[1:19:04] the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
[1:19:07] the eyes, and the pride of life is not
[1:19:09] of the father, but is of the world. And
[1:19:13] the world passeth away, and the lust
[1:19:16] thereof, but he that doeth the will of
[1:19:18] God abideth forever.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Revelation five.
[1:19:28] And I saw in the writing of him that
[1:19:29] sudden thrown a book written within on
[1:19:31] the backside sea with seven seals. I saw
[1:19:33] a strong angel proclaim with a loud
[1:19:35] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:19:38] to loose the seals thereof. And no man
[1:19:39] in heaven nor on earth neither under the
[1:19:41] earth was able to open the book near to
[1:19:44] look thereon. And I wept much because no
[1:19:46] man was found worthy to open and to read
[1:19:48] the book needed to look thereon. And one
[1:19:50] of the elders said unto me, weep not.
[1:19:52] Behold, the land of the tribe of Judah,
[1:19:54] the root of David, had prevailed to open
[1:19:56] the book, and to loose the seven seas
[1:19:58] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:20:00] midst of the throne, and the four
[1:20:01] beasts, and the midst of the elders, to
[1:20:03] the lamb, as had been slain, having
[1:20:05] seven horns, and seven eyes, which are
[1:20:07] the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[1:20:09] into all the earth. And he came and took
[1:20:12] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:20:14] that sat on the throne. And when he had
[1:20:17] taken the book, the four beasts and the
[1:20:19] four and 20 elders fell down before the
[1:20:22] lamb, having every one of them hops and
[1:20:24] golden vials full of all those which are
[1:20:26] the prayers of the saints. And they sung
[1:20:28] a new song, saying, Thou worthy to take
[1:20:30] the book, and to open the seals thereof,
[1:20:33] and as thou has slain, and has redeemed
[1:20:35] us to God by thy blood out of every
[1:20:37] kindred, tongue, and people, and nation,
[1:20:41] and has made us unto our God, kings, and
[1:20:44] priests. and we shall reign on the
[1:20:46] earth. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:20:47] Father, we have read your word and I
[1:20:49] pray that the anointing and inspiration
[1:20:51] will come. Take me out of the way,
[1:20:52] Father, and release your spirit to your
[1:20:54] people with revelation, inspiration, and
[1:20:57] confirm your word with signs, wonders,
[1:20:58] and miracles. We ask in Jesus name.
[1:21:00] Amen. You may be seated. Praise God.
[1:21:02] Have you sit down, just give God some
[1:21:04] praises.
[1:21:05] Praise God. We have to have some Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost noise in this place. Where there
[1:21:09] is God, there is noise. Don't let no
[1:21:12] quiet Catholic spirit in this message
[1:21:14] fool you. Don't let no quiet church. You
[1:21:16] have a quiet Holy Ghost. You don't have
[1:21:18] no quiet Holy Ghost. Where there's God,
[1:21:20] there's noise. Where there's God,
[1:21:21] there's fire. Our God is a consuming
[1:21:24] fire. He just burn. He'll burn in your
[1:21:26] seat. He'll burn you in your heart.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Burning in your
[1:21:30] spirit. Our God is a consuming fire.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So this morning I have a title, Pathway
[1:21:37] to Dominion. No, it's odd, but this is
[1:21:39] what I have this morning. Pathway
[1:21:43] to dominion
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; and an inspiration. We shall reign on
[1:21:49] the earth.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we have this morning.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Pathway to dominion and we shall reign
[1:21:56] on the earth. This word dominion,
[1:22:00] this word is a Latin comes from
[1:22:02] dominion. It means property,
[1:22:05] ownership,
[1:22:07] lordship. I like that. So you can't have
[1:22:10] a property without a owner.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; So it's not just you have property, who
[1:22:14] owns it.
[1:22:16] So the dictionary meaning is sovereignty
[1:22:19] control. The power or right of governing
[1:22:24] and controlling supreme authority
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; also territory
[1:22:30] under control.
[1:22:33] And in the biblical context, dominion
[1:22:35] means God-given
[1:22:37] authority and stewardship.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; This word dominion is what God said when
[1:22:44] he made man in his image and likeness.
[1:22:47] He said, "Let them have dominion."
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; This in Genesis was given in two parts.
[1:22:55] man as the who is to have dominion
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; and the what part dominion over what.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; So the who and the what was given but
[1:23:07] not the how part.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, God say who you
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; man in my image. You have dominion
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; over the what part? Over the earth
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; over every creeping thing on the earth
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; have dominion over the fish. over every
[1:23:23] living have illumin over it. But God
[1:23:26] didn't say just yet how
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Abramham said this
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; he gave him a bride second Adam. He gave
[1:23:36] him first the first Adam bride. She
[1:23:38] fell. He gave the second Adam a bride.
[1:23:41] She fell. Why? She's a byproduct. She is
[1:23:44] not original. The bride today is a
[1:23:47] byproduct. She calls herself the bride.
[1:23:50] But what she is, she's made up of
[1:23:51] material of organization and not the
[1:23:54] word. Now the bride of Adam was a type,
[1:23:57] the second Adam's bride. Now Adam's
[1:24:00] bride could not wait. God had told Adam
[1:24:03] and Eve, "Multiply and replenish the
[1:24:07] earth." It was an uncommon thing,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; a promise. So this son that was in
[1:24:13] dominion,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; this son that was in God's image and
[1:24:16] likeness was supposed to reproduce other
[1:24:19] sons,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; just like that,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; just like him.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; But they were supposed to wait for
[1:24:26] further revelation.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; As to how.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Multiply and replenish the
[1:24:34] earth." It was an oncoming thing, a
[1:24:36] promise.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; She was not his wife as yet. He had
[1:24:41] never lived with her.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And the bride of Christ is not his wife
[1:24:45] yet.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; The wedding supper is to take place.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; She got in a hurry for what Eve she
[1:24:51] crossed her seed. She mingled with the
[1:24:53] serpent seed and what she brought forth
[1:24:55] was child of death.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And she perverted every child after
[1:24:59] that.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. When
[1:25:02] the church of Jesus Christ was perverted
[1:25:04] in the time of Rome after a virgin birth
[1:25:06] and was given to Christ at Pentecost,
[1:25:08] what did she do? She cross over with the
[1:25:10] Roman dogma.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; A woman engaged a fine young clean man
[1:25:14] and before they come together she's
[1:25:16] found pregnant by somebody else. Then
[1:25:18] her own seed is betrod. Her own body
[1:25:21] which is betrod to her boyfriend. Her
[1:25:22] engaged husband is found full of seed of
[1:25:25] another man. What a disgrace. That is
[1:25:27] exactly what Adam found and that is what
[1:25:29] Christ found. They couldn't wait. And
[1:25:31] that's what the matter with the people
[1:25:32] today. They can't wait for the real Holy
[1:25:36] Spirit
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; to take the church in position.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; They have to manufacture something.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; They have to work up something.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; They can't wait for the Lord for the
[1:25:46] real manifestation of the resurrection
[1:25:48] of Jesus Christ making himself known
[1:25:51] among the people
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; because he promised to come among us.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Not not no he promised to come among us.
[1:25:57] He said and then we are worshiping the
[1:25:59] living Christ. him moving in and out
[1:26:02] among us. Then we have to come in
[1:26:04] expectation for that and preparation for
[1:26:07] that. Oh, give the Lord some praises
[1:26:09] this morning. Hallelujah. Both
[1:26:11] preparation and expectation for the Lord
[1:26:14] to come among us because one day he will
[1:26:16] come suddenly into his temple.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:26:20] Hundreds of years they quoting scripture
[1:26:22] in the Old Testament from in in in a
[1:26:24] scribe and Pharisees, but one day Jesus
[1:26:26] walked into the temple
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and he said nothing. Hallelujah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; He was silent for 18 years and then God
[1:26:33] broke the silence by giving Jesus an
[1:26:36] experience on the bank of the Jordan
[1:26:38] River.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; When John was baptizing, the Holy Ghost
[1:26:41] filled him without measure that he was
[1:26:43] anointed to go into the wilderness to
[1:26:46] face Lucifer himself to overcome all
[1:26:49] that was in the world to overcome the
[1:26:52] lust of the eyes to overcome the lust of
[1:26:54] the flesh to overcome the pride of life.
[1:26:57] He had to have dominion over himself.
[1:27:01] Oh, give the Lord a shout before he
[1:27:04] could take full power. And I want to say
[1:27:06] to you this morning, you have to have
[1:27:09] dominion over you.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:27:14] Everybody want power over somebody.
[1:27:16] Everybody want power over something. But
[1:27:19] the Bible speak about the order
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; or the process or the pathway
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; to this dominion.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; his first sermon,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; give the who
[1:27:40] which is you
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; must be born again. Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; He give the who,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; he give the what.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; You must be born again. And he give the
[1:27:51] how.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; By the word and the spirit.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So he give all three.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Who is that? You
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; must be
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; born again.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; By the word
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; and by the spirit.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; So we identify
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; this birth.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Is word and spirit.
[1:28:13] Not just word alone.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 1:23, being born again, not of
[1:28:18] corruptible seed, but of incorruptible
[1:28:22] by the word of God which liveth and
[1:28:24] abideth forever.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; When the lamb took the book,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; John make a big declaration.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "We shall reign on the earth."
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, we shall rule on the
[1:28:36] earth.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; It's a commission from God.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; It is what was original. It was what God
[1:28:42] tell man in the beginning. Man wasn't
[1:28:45] overly subject to the elements. The
[1:28:47] elements was supposed to be subject to
[1:28:49] man. Man was supposed to be in charge.
[1:28:52] Man was supposed to be in power. Man
[1:28:54] fell from that. And God purposed in his
[1:28:57] heart to restore man back to dominion,
[1:29:01] back into authority, back into power.
[1:29:04] God would not cancel that. It already
[1:29:07] gone out of his mouth. He's going to
[1:29:10] restore it. And when the lamb took the
[1:29:12] book, because John had a revelation,
[1:29:15] that book, this same seven seed book,
[1:29:18] this same seven thunder book is
[1:29:20] connected to dominion and power and
[1:29:23] authority. This book is connected to man
[1:29:27] getting back to Eden. Oh, the Lord a
[1:29:30] shout.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have to have this book to
[1:29:34] make the pathway or to make a road to
[1:29:38] get us back on track. We are going to
[1:29:40] get back on track. The whole creation is
[1:29:43] groaning,
[1:29:44] moaning for the masters to step forward.
[1:29:48] Okay, the Lord I shout. God called sons.
[1:29:52] God restored sons. Sons in dominion,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; sons in authority and power.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:04] This word reign,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; the exercise
[1:30:09] or possession of sovereign power.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; You more hear it with queens and kings
[1:30:14] and sound like that. Reign is to be
[1:30:17] predominant.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Reign, there's a difference between
[1:30:21] reign and dominion.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Dominion speaks of authority, control,
[1:30:24] and power. Reign speaks of exercise or
[1:30:27] duration of ruling.
[1:30:30] So this king reigned for so many years
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; and that one reign for so many years.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah. And he Jesus shall reign
[1:30:37] forever and ever and ever.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And he will be crowned king of kings and
[1:30:41] lord of lords.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; You can't reign over nothing. That makes
[1:30:45] no sense. You have to reign over a a a
[1:30:49] kingdom.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's where the kingdom king over a
[1:30:52] domain.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's where the word come from.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; A king over a domain. That's a kingdom.
[1:30:58] So God have to release something. Let's
[1:31:01] call it for now inheritance
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; and have sons because it don't have make
[1:31:05] sense if you have an inheritance.
[1:31:06] Brother Kelly spoke about guys across
[1:31:09] there with businesses and have no heir
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and and this is third generation
[1:31:13] businesses and there's no son
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; if they think out of the box they could
[1:31:17] adopt one
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; but there are no sons to carry on
[1:31:21] business die business close.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Well God not to close that business. God
[1:31:26] not in that at all. You know, after
[1:31:27] Abraham is Isaac, after Isaac is Jacob,
[1:31:30] Jacob and and so on and so on, God have
[1:31:32] a continuity. You know, when Elijah
[1:31:34] about to go, he pick up Elisha. God
[1:31:36] making sure a man in place, you know,
[1:31:38] when Moses, he say now Moses, my servant
[1:31:40] is dead. Now Joshua take them people
[1:31:42] over. God not making a missing a beat.
[1:31:45] You know, if he not this generation, he
[1:31:47] raise up another generation. Oh, give
[1:31:50] the Lord a shout. God missing a beat.
[1:31:51] You know, God moving on. If you don't
[1:31:54] want to move, he's moving on. When that
[1:31:56] pillar of fire move up, you have to move
[1:31:58] with the cloud. You have to move with
[1:31:59] the pillar of fire. Well, give the Lord
[1:32:01] some praises. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:32:04] Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; So God's plan is to bring back man in
[1:32:10] position
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; to reign
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; and to rule.
[1:32:14] Brother, he said, you know that man in
[1:32:17] the beginning when God made him, he
[1:32:20] didn't make him to be doctorred.
[1:32:23] He had his own doctrine in him.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; He was equipped. He was a unit of his
[1:32:29] own. Then healing does not come from any
[1:32:32] outside resource.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It had to come from inside.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Now we can take outside aids and to kill
[1:32:37] germs or whatever it is. We can take
[1:32:39] hands and cut each other and piece out
[1:32:41] and something like appendix and bat
[1:32:43] tooth or something like that. But
[1:32:44] healing does not come from anything that
[1:32:46] you apply. Healing only comes by the
[1:32:48] power that's within yourself
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; to build back the tissue that has been
[1:32:53] torn from the place have been taken out.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Therefore, healing is in you.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Now listen close and think hard. Watch.
[1:33:00] Man in the beginning when he was made a
[1:33:03] man, man is a god.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Small G. He is absolutely a god. Small
[1:33:10] G. For he was made in the image of God.
[1:33:13] That's big G.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Being a son of God, then he's an heir to
[1:33:18] all that God is.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that's reached you this
[1:33:23] morning. We have been talking about
[1:33:24] inheritance and so on. Inheritance. If
[1:33:26] for somebody, you know,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; they don't write a will and there's
[1:33:29] nobody for it. Um, there nobody. This is
[1:33:32] for you.
[1:33:34] The fact that there's inheritance mean
[1:33:37] that there's somebody
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; to inherit it.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You don't work for inheritance.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You are given an inheritance.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; When Jesus died was to pay for what God
[1:33:51] put in that thing for you.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a son of God, here we go, is a
[1:34:00] heir of all that God is. And man was
[1:34:04] given a domain and the domain was the
[1:34:07] earth.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; You have power over the fishes, over the
[1:34:10] f of the air, over everything. He could
[1:34:12] speak and everything had to obey him
[1:34:14] because he was a god within himself.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Not universal god.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; But I mean he's the god of heaven and
[1:34:21] earth. But he was a ruler of his domain.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He was a king,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; a king ruler.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That was man.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. What did the Bible say?
[1:34:32] Thou has made us kings and priests and
[1:34:35] we shall reign on the earth. That has
[1:34:38] not been cancelled or erased. Give the
[1:34:41] Lord a shout. God, I want to hear a
[1:34:43] shout on that one. God has not cancelled
[1:34:45] that. Thou has made us, not we made
[1:34:49] ourselves, you have made us
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; kings and priests and we shall make
[1:34:56] reign on the earth. It's not what you
[1:34:58] are, it's what God has made you. Oh,
[1:35:01] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah. And if it's anything you
[1:35:06] have to know, inheritance, you don't
[1:35:07] have to be deserving. You don't have to
[1:35:09] be the best child. You don't have to be
[1:35:10] nothing. All you have to know is that
[1:35:12] your name is on that deed. And it's
[1:35:15] written that this is for you. This is
[1:35:17] for you. This is for you. And once you
[1:35:19] know by revelation what is for you, you
[1:35:22] have a right, what's that word right? To
[1:35:25] make your claims.
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:30] You are making your claims based based
[1:35:32] upon what has been left for you
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; or released for you,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; given to you.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; So he was a king.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; King ruler that was man and even in his
[1:35:47] fallen state now we see that we see how
[1:35:50] man conquers. Man conquer space. Man
[1:35:52] conquer the air. Man man is something
[1:35:55] else. Yes,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; even with technology now, man is a
[1:35:58] conqueror.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; He's an achiever.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; So, it's very tough to see men or woman
[1:36:05] without ambition.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Without drive.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; It's a sickening thing
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; where you find yourself in idle mode.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; You're just idling. You're not It can't
[1:36:17] going away. You're idling.
[1:36:22] It's not going into gear. You're not
[1:36:24] putting it in drive. The island is what
[1:36:26] you call it M.
[1:36:29] Idle
[1:36:32] well p like in a traffic jam and no and
[1:36:35] and and no traffic jam you know that
[1:36:38] come like a man in the market say don't
[1:36:39] push to push don't rush don't rush
[1:36:41] everybody will get and nobody there
[1:36:46] but he advertising in a dynamic way
[1:36:48] don't push to everybody going to get
[1:36:51] there's not a soul in front of him
[1:36:58] all right let's
[1:36:59] Abraham confessed he was a pilgrim and
[1:37:01] stranger all the days of his life. He
[1:37:04] looked for that city and make us build
[1:37:05] his God. Moses drifted away from Egypt,
[1:37:09] got out into the wilderness, was living
[1:37:11] fine. He was living by the mountain,
[1:37:12] lovely wife, little boy Gersham to fall
[1:37:15] air to all Jethro sheep and that that
[1:37:17] was all right. He was going just
[1:37:19] drifting along with ease of tide.
[1:37:24] Israel down there in trouble
[1:37:27] crying.
[1:37:29] God had elected him to deliver the
[1:37:31] people and he got away from it.
[1:37:35] Your family in trouble. You in trouble.
[1:37:38] You know people in trouble and you're
[1:37:40] still drifting
[1:37:42] at ease. This is it here. Now
[1:37:47] that's what the matter with many of our
[1:37:48] churches today. God called us to a
[1:37:51] ministry. Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; God call us to be his people. Write it
[1:37:54] with me.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; As you hear it, say, "Amen."
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; God called us to believe in signs and
[1:38:01] wonders.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; God called us to perform
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; signs and wonders.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He called us to do that.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I think I want to read that over again.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; God called us to be his people.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And the church, say, "Amen." Don't just
[1:38:16] shake your head.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Open your mouth and say, "Amen."
[1:38:20] I'm going to say it again. God called us
[1:38:22] to be his people.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; God called us to believe in signs and
[1:38:26] wonders.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; God called us to perform signs and
[1:38:28] wonders. He called us to do that.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; And we are drifting too far away from
[1:38:34] it.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; So why shouldn't we preach it?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we call for it? Why
[1:38:39] shouldn't we pray and ask God for it?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; What we need is another visitation of
[1:38:47] God. Yes sir.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; See, send the vision of the spirit of
[1:38:52] God.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; We are drifting too far away like Moses
[1:38:54] did. Moses was all right back there. He
[1:38:56] was having a good living. The church
[1:38:58] today has got bigger building, better
[1:39:00] churches, better dressed people, better
[1:39:01] living people ever had. But brother,
[1:39:03] that's not the thing.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; We have got to victory. You got to
[1:39:06] fight. We have got to do something for
[1:39:10] the kingdom of God.
[1:39:13] There was Moses living luxuriously
[1:39:15] walking down one morning and God spoke
[1:39:17] to him out of a burning bush. That man
[1:39:19] was changed from that time on. What a
[1:39:21] radical thing that causes you to do
[1:39:23] whenever you find God. Look at Moses
[1:39:25] run, kill one Egyptian, run out in the
[1:39:27] desert. And there he is next morning
[1:39:29] after he met God in the burning bush.
[1:39:31] His wife sitting a straddle in a mule,
[1:39:33] little Gisham on a hip, whiskers hanging
[1:39:35] down that low, sticking his hand, where
[1:39:37] you going, Moses going to Egypt to take
[1:39:38] over a one-man invasion. But he done it.
[1:39:42] He did it because God said so. He did it
[1:39:44] because he had faith. Oh, glory to God.
[1:39:46] He did it because God said so. Do you
[1:39:49] know what God said? You have to know
[1:39:50] what God said to tell the devil what God
[1:39:52] said. And God can't lie. God is not a
[1:39:55] man that would lie. If God say going to
[1:39:57] revive you, he going to revive you. If
[1:39:58] God say going to heal you, he going to
[1:39:59] heal you. If God deliver you, he going
[1:40:01] to deliver you. God cannot lie. Oh, give
[1:40:04] the Lord some praises.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right with me now. You
[1:40:10] may be seated.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; he has faith.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; So maybe people not hearing God or God
[1:40:20] not speaking to them.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; But when God speaks to a man,
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; he has faith.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; And he has ambition.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; There's two things happen when God
[1:40:27] speaks to a man. He give you faith and
[1:40:29] ambition. Ambition is when you have big
[1:40:31] expectation.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ambition pushes you past
[1:40:35] yourself, past your fears, past your
[1:40:38] shy, past all the excuses you have.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yeah, but I talk about
[1:40:46] desire, expecting great things and big
[1:40:48] things. God want you to have that
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; because it's part of ambition.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Your ambition can't just be to pass
[1:40:56] through school. You want to get your
[1:40:57] exams, papers.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You want to be successful in your
[1:41:00] subjects.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; You want to get good results.
[1:41:04] Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Your ambition be you don't want to be
[1:41:07] also run. You want to win the race.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; So you run to win.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; You don't run to participate. You run to
[1:41:13] win.
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; So when God speaks to a man, he has
[1:41:19] faith
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and he has ambition
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; and he has a purpose.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him a
[1:41:26] purpose.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him
[1:41:28] ambition.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's when God speaks to man.
[1:41:32] Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; If God hasn't spoken to you yet, ask God
[1:41:35] this in the service to speak to you
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; to give your faith and ambition
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; and to give you a purpose. So when you
[1:41:40] wake up in the morning, you wouldn't
[1:41:42] wake up in the morning like in your
[1:41:43] traffic jam as said and you're in gear.
[1:41:45] You wake up with a purpose.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You wake up to come to
[1:41:48] give God praise. David said, "I was glad
[1:41:51] when they said unto me, let us go into
[1:41:54] the house of God."
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I was."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; They had to drag me.
[1:42:01] I was glad when they said unto me.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go. When God speaks to a man, he
[1:42:12] gives him ambition. When God speaks to a
[1:42:14] man, he gives him faith to do it
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; to accomplish
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; or to achieve what his purpose in life
[1:42:23] is.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And God called him to do it.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise and amen. Do you believe
[1:42:28] that? Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I remember when we were
[1:42:31] renting high up there in Shine's
[1:42:32] building and one day one person come say
[1:42:35] but Barcel
[1:42:37] church and that time I think the come
[1:42:38] Lord I said I don't have time to build a
[1:42:40] church but Lord coming soon and I you
[1:42:42] know and then somebody has come to me
[1:42:45] but you why you know same day now these
[1:42:49] two people have a choice I'm hearing two
[1:42:53] different people bringing so I went and
[1:42:55] pray I said Lord what are you saying to
[1:42:57] me are you trying to get these people to
[1:43:00] tell me to look this way. And that is
[1:43:02] how I changed my mindset
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; from saying renting to looking for a
[1:43:07] place. Then I said, Lord, if we have to
[1:43:10] get a place, I don't want two
[1:43:12] transportations. I want when you come,
[1:43:14] you could get to the place. I don't want
[1:43:16] to come to Sandy Grandandy and then go
[1:43:17] somewhere else. So we started look
[1:43:20] around and saw and there was a place we
[1:43:21] found looking good. And my wife just I
[1:43:24] put this way. She hated it. But that was
[1:43:27] going to be a second transportation. She
[1:43:28] just didn't like it at all. Well, well,
[1:43:30] you know what that means? No go. But the
[1:43:33] prayer was, I want a place that we don't
[1:43:37] need a second transportation. And we got
[1:43:39] here then we're going to build and we
[1:43:42] going to do it without funds.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; I remember I said which man would build
[1:43:51] a house without the cost.
[1:43:54] But I used to miss it. That was the man
[1:43:58] because we never even called the course.
[1:44:00] But I shame drew the building all the
[1:44:03] size that was legally correct for the
[1:44:04] size and everything else. And then we
[1:44:06] started and we got help here, help here.
[1:44:09] People came and after the building
[1:44:10] finished, it disappeared. We don't know
[1:44:12] where they going.
[1:44:13] But God wanted this done
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; because there was a purpose behind it.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And God gave us faith. God gave us
[1:44:20] ambition. And God gave us purpose.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And here we are.
[1:44:24] And to go forward, we have we have to
[1:44:27] have faith. We have to ambition. We have
[1:44:30] to have purpose because God want to take
[1:44:33] us further. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:44:35] This is not the landing day, you know.
[1:44:37] No, we now getting started. This is the
[1:44:40] launching part. We now about to get Oh,
[1:44:42] God. Did you hear me this morning? I
[1:44:45] want to hear a shout in the house.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; God was waiting for you to be here.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God was
[1:44:52] waiting for you in your seat.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And when this church was built up, I
[1:45:01] think I was 38 years old.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; At that time, nobody was building
[1:45:07] upstairs, downstairs, but then that was
[1:45:09] well my heart. There was little
[1:45:12] complainers and fussers in the church
[1:45:13] saying, "Why you go be flat and this and
[1:45:15] that and thing and that." But they
[1:45:17] didn't have the vision.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; They were not seeing what I was seeing.
[1:45:21] why they didn't go and build flat.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; God talked to them, God spoke to me.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; So I had the vision
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; of what I wanted to see
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; and here it is today.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; If I had studied those voices and those
[1:45:35] negative people because it cost less and
[1:45:37] this and that, I followed them. But I
[1:45:39] wasn't following them.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I was following God.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And this is what we have to do. When you
[1:45:44] hear from God, you walk in what God has
[1:45:47] spoken. You walk in what God has
[1:45:49] unfolded because God can't lie. I
[1:45:52] remember when you were in Kaiw and I
[1:45:54] told them God told me that I will be in
[1:45:55] standing granny after a couple of months
[1:45:57] a brother come and tell me brother say
[1:45:58] nobody believe that you know I said it
[1:45:59] doesn't matter if nobody believe that if
[1:46:01] God said that God big enough to bring it
[1:46:03] to pass. Praise God. God don't need your
[1:46:05] opinion. God don't need your suggestion.
[1:46:08] God don't need your idea. If God said
[1:46:10] we're going to be here, we're going to
[1:46:11] be here. If God say we're going to have
[1:46:13] a revival, we got a revival. If God say
[1:46:15] power going to be in the church, power
[1:46:17] going to be in the church. If God said
[1:46:18] the sick going to be healed and the
[1:46:20] blind going to see and the deaf going to
[1:46:22] hear and the going to walk and
[1:46:25] the pillar of fire going to hang over
[1:46:26] the building, God can't lie.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah. God will confirm his word,
[1:46:32] but he has to have a people that he
[1:46:35] going to confirm his word by and
[1:46:37] through. Give the Lord a shout. He said,
[1:46:39] "By and through the bride will be
[1:46:42] fulfilled all that was promised in this
[1:46:44] hour." Glory to God. So you're not here
[1:46:46] by chance. You have a purpose behind you
[1:46:48] being here. There's a purpose behind
[1:46:50] your life. There's a purpose behind your
[1:46:53] failure and success. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:46:55] shout in the house. Glory to God. Do you
[1:46:58] hear what I said?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind your failures
[1:47:02] and success.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:08] All right.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; When God speaks to a man, he gives him
[1:47:12] faith to do it.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; To accomplish or achieve what his
[1:47:16] purpose in life is what God called him
[1:47:19] to do. He called us
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; to be in the church of God.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; What did David said? How come this man
[1:47:29] defy the armies
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; of the living God?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; He said defy the army.
[1:47:37] Hallelujah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Of
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; the living God.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Who is this uncircumcised Philistine?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; When are you going to recognize who you
[1:47:47] are?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; As part of God's choice in this hour.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Because who he for you, he called.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; If he didn't phone you, he can't call
[1:47:54] you. He only call you because he knew
[1:47:56] you before.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Well, give the Lord a shout. I ain't
[1:47:59] talking about your struggles. I'm not
[1:48:01] talking about your weakness. I am
[1:48:03] talking about the call. The call. Who he
[1:48:05] found you, he called? That's Bible.
[1:48:08] That's Bible. That's Bible. Who he call
[1:48:12] it justified. Justified as if you never
[1:48:14] did it. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:48:16] house. Hallelujah. That's Bible. That's
[1:48:19] Bible. Hallelujah. Who he justified, he
[1:48:22] has already glorified. If God be for us.
[1:48:26] If God be for us.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care what other brothers say.
[1:48:31] This minister say, this pastor say,
[1:48:33] liars. If God Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Before us,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Which Philistine,
[1:48:41] which demon, which devil going to stop
[1:48:44] us from marching forward on what?
[1:48:46] Christian soldiers marching onto war
[1:48:50] with the cross of Jesus going on before
[1:48:54] like a mighty army moves the church of
[1:48:57] God. Brothers, we are treading where the
[1:49:00] saints have trod. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:49:03] shout.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; We are moving on.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; We are moving forward.
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:18] [Music]
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:21] Huh?
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:26] [Applause]
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; let's just make it our purpose in life
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; to see that we are the church of God.
[1:49:45] All right.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Let's have ambition.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Not set around because the Jones what we
[1:49:51] care about that they don't want it.
[1:49:53] Let's do it anyhow.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; If the rest of the nation wants to sink,
[1:49:56] that's up to them.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; In Yakima,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; as the place he was at, we stand for
[1:50:02] God.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; We want God.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; We want to achieve. We want to have
[1:50:06] faith. We want to have ambition

[1:50:11] God.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; We want to achieve. We want to have
[1:50:14] faith. We want to have ambition.
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; What we see
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; should make a church that will make a
[1:50:26] revival that people will fly in and see
[1:50:29] the seven thunders that are not being
[1:50:32] written is being manifested.
[1:50:36] [Applause]

[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; That's our ambition.
[1:50:46] [Applause]
[1:50:52] Let's believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.

[1:53:18] man help me was in that so excited for a
[1:53:22] word from the Lord to roll away the

[1:53:34] alone roll it. Everybody come and roll
[1:53:35] it. But because somebody inside there is
[1:53:38] locked up. Somebody in the house of
[1:53:40] hell. Somebody needs to get out. Some
[1:53:42] family member we see need to see
[1:53:44] delivered. Somebody sick need to be
[1:53:46] healed. Okay. The Lord has shout in the
[1:53:48] house. Somebody bound need to go free
[1:53:51] this morning. Roll away the stone.

[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Roll away your doubts, your questions,
[1:54:02] your fears.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Roll it away.

[1:54:08] God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; So Moses when God finished with him, he
[1:54:19] had ambition.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Never was the same after that.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; He had ambition. He had something to
[1:54:24] work forward to.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; That's how I want you to come to church.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Come to church with something
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; you're looking forward to.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Come to church with a fiery expectation.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. If your husband giving
[1:54:39] problems that he will be delivered. If
[1:54:40] your wife giving problems that she'll be
[1:54:42] delivered. If your children giving
[1:54:43] problem that they will be delivered. If
[1:54:45] your house are problems that the house
[1:54:47] will be delivered. But you have to come
[1:54:48] here not empty. You have to come here
[1:54:51] with something. There are people came to
[1:54:52] brand meeting with something in their
[1:54:54] heart. People people lucky to get a a
[1:54:57] number to come on the platform
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; and when they reaching the platform no

[1:55:12] faith
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; pulling the pillar of fire right off the
[1:55:15] platform and Bam have to move with the
[1:55:17] pillar of fire. I don't care if you have
[1:55:19] 10 people in front of there. When you
[1:55:21] pull the pill of fire pull, he have to

[1:55:28] shout. Do you get what I'm saying? He's
[1:55:31] trying to go here, but somebody pulling
[1:55:34] over there.

[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Sometime God has do some shocking
[1:56:34] things, you know. Sometime he has moved
[1:56:36] suddenly when you don't even expect him.
[1:56:38] He just moved like that. Tell you,
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; you think God tell Peter everything was
[1:56:41] going to unfold when he went to
[1:56:42] Cornelius's house. God had to hijack
[1:56:45] Peter and tell him eat, rise and eat.
[1:56:47] Give Peter a vision. Change Peter mind
[1:56:49] and thinking about eating unclean meat
[1:56:51] and whatnot because God preparing him to
[1:56:53] face the Gentiles.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; When Peter come out the vision so man
[1:56:58] outside calling for Peter plenty Peters
[1:57:00] in those days you know one in Japer
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; specific
[1:57:06] you going the wrong Peter wrong results
[1:57:08] you know watch them Peters you know
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; make sure you get the right one. When
[1:57:13] Peter come down and said he said he he
[1:57:14] gone down to Cornia's house and he be to
[1:57:17] testify
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; he doesn't know what exactly was going
[1:57:19] to move.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; He be to testify about Jesus. All of a
[1:57:22] sudden fire fell
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy
[1:57:25] Ghost.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; When Peter went back Peter give the
[1:57:27] testimony. He said the same Holy Ghost
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; that we received them people received.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Not a different Holy Ghost. Not a minor
[1:57:35] Holy Ghost. Not a mini Holy Ghost. Not a
[1:57:38] message Holy Ghost.
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:46] Same.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Same.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Same means same.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; I don't have to go for a dictionary to
[1:57:52] explain what same is.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Same signs,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; same wonders, same miracles, same power,
[1:58:00] same healing, same deliverance, same
[1:58:04] breakthrough, same just mean same. Take
[1:58:07] that message world.
[1:58:10] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house,
[1:58:12] brother. I feel like a bird. Nobody cut
[1:58:15] me, holding the coail.
[1:58:18] [Applause]
[1:58:19] Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel like
[1:58:23] jumping. My God, I don't know about you.
[1:58:25] I feel like jumping. 67 and jumping.
[1:58:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:39] Let they say to you dry up
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; part of me dip in oil
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; and part of me on fire
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; and the oil I am the wick now the wick
[1:58:48] just
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; just oil just pumping up so and light
[1:58:51] you on fire stop that you had to take me
[1:58:55] out of the oil first
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; that's a tough one
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; all right so Moses was never the same
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; he had something to look forward to so
[1:59:04] if I'm sick in this building here I am
[1:59:07] looking forward to my healing.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to thank God for my
[1:59:10] sickness. Lord, thank you, Lord. My
[1:59:11] mother had it. My father had my
[1:59:12] grandfather had it. What? What kind of
[1:59:14] praise is that?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; What kind of foolishness is that? That
[1:59:16] what God want you to pray and praise.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; You thank God for your healing.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; You thank him in advance.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You thank him because you know he is
[1:59:23] able.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; You thank him. Let heaven get disturbed.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; There see she acting like a crazy woman.
[1:59:28] She praised him and nothing happened
[1:59:29] yet. Mary didn't wait for a feeling. You
[1:59:32] know, I wonder if it's for when we
[1:59:34] pregnant and and Mary wasn't that, you
[1:59:36] know. Once the angel said that what you
[1:59:37] have going to be the Christ she ran to
[1:59:39] Elizabeth hey
[1:59:41] news girl news. Where's the news? A
[1:59:45] angel appeared to me and tell me the
[1:59:47] Christ and his name is called Jesus.
[1:59:50] John inside Mary. John inside Elizabeth
[1:59:53] belly move. When John hear Jesus he say
[1:59:56] aha.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He say amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; He say hallelujah. John give a kick in
[2:00:01] that stomach. Oh glory to God. You
[2:00:02] didn't hear me this morning. don't move
[2:00:04] at all. But when he had Jesus, I tell
[2:00:07] you, devils will run, demons will
[2:00:10] tremble. When the church get into step
[2:00:14] to produce Jesus Christ, the same
[2:00:16] yesterday is dead forever. Oh, glory to
[2:00:19] God. Give the Lord a shout. If you never
[2:00:22] shout before, let the men in the house
[2:00:26] give a shout.
[2:00:37] [Applause]
[2:00:41] Glory
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; All the days of his life,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; he served God to deliver those people.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; He wasn't concerned about that.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; As long he was getting along, all right.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God said he looking to
[2:00:59] buy more furniture.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; He just want to visit the car,
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; the new car department. You can look at
[2:01:07] make a down payment on a car and God
[2:01:10] come down to say I have heard. I know
[2:01:13] you ain't hearing nothing. You're
[2:01:14] looking at wheels.
[2:01:17] But I have heard
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; the cries of my people
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; and I have come down to deliver
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; and I am sending you.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; You see whenever God come down he had to
[2:01:29] send somebody.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Whenever God come down he have to use
[2:01:32] somebody.
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Today when the church is sick the
[2:01:39] sickness is piled up and the people
[2:01:41] because of intellectual pride and so
[2:01:43] forth is getting away from divine
[2:01:45] healing.
[2:01:47] You hear what he's saying?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, they're ducking divine.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; They're getting away from Holy Spirit.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; God hears the cry of his people.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody has got to go.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Couple of years ago, I shared this and I
[2:02:02] want to share it back. I felt like to
[2:02:03] bring this back this morning. A word
[2:02:05] called inertia.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; One time I was talking about action is
[2:02:09] caused.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; For something that is in action, you
[2:02:11] have to cause it.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; There are some people watching what
[2:02:14] happening. They may participate just
[2:02:16] watching watching
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; they are the watchers. There are some
[2:02:20] people that wondering what happening.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; They know going on. They just wondering.
[2:02:25] And the third set is those who causing
[2:02:27] things to happen.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to be part of the third
[2:02:30] set.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Causing things to happen.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; So action is cause.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; But inertia is a tendency to do nothing
[2:02:41] or to remain unchanged. All right.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; A word come from the pullpit and you
[2:02:45] move.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "Praise God." And your mouth tight.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands and give God a shot of
[2:02:55] praise. You're not even your finger
[2:02:56] move.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; A tendency to do nothing
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; or to remain unchanged.
[2:03:05] The the the synonyms of this word is
[2:03:07] inactivity,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; inaction,
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; inattentiveness,
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; passivity,
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; apathy,
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; malaise, stagnation,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; dullness.
[2:03:19] In physics, this word inertia, a
[2:03:22] property of matter by which it continues
[2:03:26] in its existing state of rest
[2:03:29] or uniform motion in a straight line
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; unless that state is changed by an
[2:03:35] external force.
[2:03:38] Hallelujah.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; So if they're going one today,
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; one tomorrow,
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; for the rest of your life,
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; they're going so for the rest of their
[2:03:45] life. One today.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; The worst person to work with, you're
[2:03:49] working on something and somebody going
[2:03:51] packs,
[2:03:53] packs. It's best you work by yourself.
[2:03:55] You know that is so demotivating.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; You hustling, you're hustling, telling
[2:04:01] Pax.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Like examining the nail, hit it packs.
[2:04:04] You're watching the hammer to hit it
[2:04:05] packs. This is a lazy spirit.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, I appreciate your help, but
[2:04:11] you'll be better home.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Your help is needed elsewhere.
[2:04:19] In physics, the property of matter by
[2:04:22] which it continues in existing state of
[2:04:24] rest or uniform motion in a straight
[2:04:27] line unless that state is changed by an
[2:04:31] external force. Probably if love don't
[2:04:33] get it desperate. Two accidents,
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; roof blow off,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; conditions will
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; that why people get in conditions
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; all the time they in praying or what
[2:04:45] not. They hang up on hospital bed stick
[2:04:47] up in the air drips on one side. Oh God,
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; you shall be praying oh God long time.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; You should be praying for help long
[2:04:55] time.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Don't just continue continue until an
[2:05:00] external force change the circumstance.
[2:05:03] Hallelujah.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; That man who daughter was vexed that
[2:05:09] sick. He didn't want to go he was a big
[2:05:11] shot in the scheme of things you know he
[2:05:14] couldn't take it no more. Lord my master
[2:05:16] my daughter sick dying
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; while he talking somebody come she dead
[2:05:21] now
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; don't waste the time
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; and he tell telling man I I go wake her
[2:05:26] up
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; because the level of his faith is
[2:05:29] completely different. The eyes of Jesus
[2:05:32] faith is completely different from what
[2:05:33] man see. And you keep seeing things and
[2:05:36] going in what you see. Why don't you ask
[2:05:38] God for his eyes?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you never even pray that God
[2:05:43] give me your eyes in this situation.
[2:05:47] You're using your father eye, your
[2:05:48] mother eye, your wife eye, your husband
[2:05:50] eye. You're using your all eye, but
[2:05:52] you're not asking God for his eyes
[2:05:53] because you still want to do your own
[2:05:54] thing. The reason some people don't want
[2:05:57] to come to bring the things to God or
[2:05:58] the ministry of a prayer is because they
[2:05:59] want to continue in the same state
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; in a straight line.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear anything
[2:06:09] different than what they have in the
[2:06:10] heart. There's a statement, a man
[2:06:12] convinced
[2:06:14] against his will is of the same opinion.
[2:06:17] Still,
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; we're not trying to convince you against
[2:06:21] your will.
[2:06:24] the power required to overcome friction
[2:06:28] and inertia in moving past. All right.
[2:06:31] Disincclination to move or act.
[2:06:34] So when the mirror comes to you,
[2:06:38] instead of looking at the mirror and
[2:06:39] seeing yourself, you find fault with the
[2:06:41] man holding up the mirror.
[2:06:47] When the word come is a mirror
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; and the mirror comes for you to see look
[2:06:51] look at here and you doing so why you
[2:06:53] brother over saying that
[2:06:55] somebody telling someone me this morning
[2:06:58] why you on that road you got to go
[2:07:00] somewhere else no is this the mirror
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; take a look in it now tell me what you
[2:07:04] seeing
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; you see you see how few people say amen
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; the mirror we you want you want a bigger
[2:07:11] mirror then
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; you only seeing your face you want to
[2:07:13] see whole body
[2:07:19] physics.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; The tendency of a body to preserve its
[2:07:22] state of rest or uniform motion unless
[2:07:24] acted upon
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; by an external force. Lack of movement
[2:07:28] or activity, especially when movement or
[2:07:31] activity is wanted or needed. A feeling
[2:07:34] of not having the energy
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; or desire
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; that is needed to move or change.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; So, you're fixed. As my friend from
[2:07:45] Green say they lock
[2:07:50] say they lock it they lock and sometime
[2:07:54] when they lock the stuff up like that
[2:07:55] they have the key to that you know
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; you can't open that they lock
[2:08:05] Jesus
[2:08:07] after 18 years of silence
[2:08:12] when his seed got dead ripe.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, he can't go down on the
[2:08:18] Jordan River age 27.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; He had to hit 30
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; to move.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; So age 30, he's heading down in line.
[2:08:27] John already get a word. The one upon
[2:08:30] whom you see that dove resting
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; because some does dove rest and move him
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; and the man give my testimony. Oh say
[2:08:38] the dove rest on me. Where do now
[2:08:44] dove rest? I ain't doubting that you
[2:08:45] know. But has it remained?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible John said the one who
[2:08:50] see the dove rest and remain.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; So it have dove resting and taking off
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; because a dove thinking is a is a lamb.
[2:08:56] Why do lamb soul is because that was the
[2:08:59] time they was being stroked this way and
[2:09:01] the cat ping meow meow.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; But then the prophet say stroke it the
[2:09:05] other way. And when they get his throat
[2:09:07] the other way, that is when the growl
[2:09:08] come
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; and the wolf come and that's when they
[2:09:10] the dove take off.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; So friends, we have to be in a condition
[2:09:14] we want that dove to remain.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; We want that dove to abide. Is that
[2:09:18] right?
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; So Jesus,
[2:09:21] he wasn't idle in those 18 years.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; He was in the word.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; He was studying the father's business.
[2:09:27] He said so when he was age 12.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; So he knew his promises.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; He knew his scriptures. So when they
[2:09:34] invited him for to read, he found the
[2:09:36] place.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Some people can't even find the Bible.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; But Jesus found the place where it was
[2:09:41] written.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; If they can't find the Bible, you can't
[2:09:43] find the place in the Bible. Do you know
[2:09:45] where your Bible is?
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Don't answer that. Don't answer. Don't
[2:09:49] raise your hand. Tell me where.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; So he found the place where it's written
[2:09:52] and he read the scripture and said this
[2:09:55] day
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; this scripture is
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; fulfilled in your air. Amen.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; And that is where they threw him out.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; But then something happened to Jesus.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; into the wilderness
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate dominion
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; by the word
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; to overcome the lust of the eyes,
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; the lust of the flesh, and the pride of
[2:10:22] life, which summarizes all that is in
[2:10:26] the world.
[2:10:29] So all that is in the world is connected
[2:10:32] to three these three steps or these
[2:10:35] three temptations or these three tests.
[2:10:37] Lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh,
[2:10:38] pride of life.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; But he proved he had dominion over it.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; The big hit was all these kingdoms are
[2:10:51] mine to give to whoever I want. Satan
[2:10:54] talking very confident
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; if he would only bow down
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; and worship
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; because that is his original desire
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; in heaven to worship. He wanted to be
[2:11:04] like God
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; and Jesus denied him that
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; and stayed with the word
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; his flesh was hungering his appetite.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God turn the stone
[2:11:15] into bread.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; It's 40 days he's fasting.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; The devil know he's hungry.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Every demon in hell know he's hungry.
[2:11:22] He's a man. We supposed to live off the
[2:11:24] earth.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; He know he is hungry. But he had to have
[2:11:27] power
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; over his appetite. He had to have power
[2:11:30] over his flesh.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I buffet myself." Hal to
[2:11:37] bring my flesh in subjection. Least
[2:11:39] after I preach the gospel, I perish. Oh,
[2:11:42] give the Lord some praises. God can't do
[2:11:45] that for you. You have got to do
[2:11:46] something about you, your decisions,
[2:11:49] your actions. You can't just be living
[2:11:51] in the emotions. Everything is
[2:11:53] emotional. Carry on. Like if you're
[2:11:55] immature, like you're a child. You ain't
[2:11:56] got sweetie. You ain't got this. It
[2:11:58] carry on.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Deny your child something and see what's
[2:12:02] going on now. It's havoc in the house.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; If your child normal
[2:12:08] cuz that's what children do.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; They want this. They want it now.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; So we have to have this dominion.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. over self.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; We have to get to this dominion.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; You have to begin to visualize it and
[2:12:27] see it as part of your Christian walk.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; You have to take a hold of it. That is
[2:12:32] why God put them seven virtues
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; to give us a means as to how to get out
[2:12:36] of the way
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; by these seven virtues. That's what
[2:12:39] temperance is for and patience is for
[2:12:42] and godliness is for. How much marriages
[2:12:44] would have been so different if that
[2:12:46] tongue we going to get to it
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; was correctly silenced?
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; I expect much amen for that.
[2:13:07] So when that maniac man came up to
[2:13:08] brother brand and say you snake in the
[2:13:10] grass look look the devil spewing words.
[2:13:12] If you can't handle words you you lose
[2:13:15] it or not.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; If you can handle you snake in the grass
[2:13:18] you hypocrite. The devil calling Barama
[2:13:20] a hypocrite
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; in that man. You snake in the grass, you
[2:13:24] hypocrite.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; The man have a repetition of beating up
[2:13:26] preachers. As far as that spirit
[2:13:27] concerned is another one go and get
[2:13:28] licks.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; But Abraham had 400 men. How much men
[2:13:31] behind him there? All them jump off the
[2:13:32] platform.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; All them all in glory. Hallelujah. Amen.

[2:13:39] to challenge brother. All them soldiers

[2:13:43] war. You know them getting marching
[2:13:46] straight out the platform. Straight out
[2:13:48] the platform. Leave this little man 5
[2:13:50] foot something standing there.
[2:13:52] Hallelujah.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And brother stand up there and said
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; because
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; you have challenged the spirit of God,
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; you shall fall over my feet.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; He can't say fall my feet and roll on
[2:14:03] the platform.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Stand right there.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; He's standing in his position.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; He is standing under authority.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; He is standing in dominion. He's not
[2:14:12] speaking to the man. He's speaking to a
[2:14:14] spirit because
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; you That's not not the man. There's a
[2:14:19] spirit in a man because you have
[2:14:21] challenged the spirit of God. You shall
[2:14:23] fall under my feet.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Fall over my feet.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; The man come up at the platform and when
[2:14:30] the man raised his hand, he said, "Come
[2:14:32] out of him."
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spin around and fall on Abraham
[2:14:35] feet.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Had to take him off Bram.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; All them ministers jump home. Them
[2:14:40] should have them should have a boxing
[2:14:41] ring and said, "Come. Don't touch that
[2:14:42] prophet. They they shall be so if they
[2:14:44] cast at least fight
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; at least hold on the man wrestle the man
[2:14:49] or something. So all them fellas run
[2:14:50] straight out.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; That prophet stood there
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; because he knew his sunship.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; He knew his godship.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; He knew we getting back to Eden.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; He knew he was the first example seed
[2:15:02] son
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; in this hour to demonstrate what we have
[2:15:05] to display. The devils are coming. The
[2:15:09] maniacs coming and we have to withstand
[2:15:12] them. We have to have what it takes for
[2:15:15] the channel of the hour. If those
[2:15:17] ministers think for all these years we
[2:15:20] just be behind the pulpit saying word
[2:15:22] word word. They're wrong. You know
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; something is about to shift.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Something is about to move.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; It started.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; I believe it can start today. You know,
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; oh give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; How many time you hear me say the bull
[2:15:39] coming?
[2:15:42] And the bull don't want hear about no
[2:15:44] mysteries and vials and praise and
[2:15:46] thunders and seals and thing and know
[2:15:48] only one language the bull understands
[2:15:50] the language of love
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; and if you don't have it that bull
[2:15:53] coming for you get you're getting
[2:15:55] frightened now
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; but the bull's still coming
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; if you're fighting the bull's still
[2:15:58] coming if you're not frightening it's
[2:16:00] still coming
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; the bull is on his way give the Lord
[2:16:03] some praises but a bride is on the way
[2:16:06] there will be a super church there will
[2:16:08] be a super race as we near the headstone
[2:16:10] stone.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; You asked brother a question, brother
[2:16:22] Abraham. How could you know what you
[2:16:24] know and go among them brethren?
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Knowledge know what they
[2:16:27] believe."
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; No, it's in their heart,
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; hoping someday. In other words, he was
[2:16:31] showing that these virtues are now
[2:16:33] operational
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; inside of him.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; That he could do go where no other
[2:16:38] person going to go. So how people want
[2:16:39] to tell you where to go,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; who to talk to.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; You can't talk to this one. You can't
[2:16:43] talk to this one.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Talk to the bees. Tell them to don't
[2:16:46] talk to the bees. He talk to the bees
[2:16:47] and all. Even bees get in language. Bees
[2:16:50] just go around and and just settle
[2:16:51] yourself.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Talking to bull.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Demonstrating the power of a restored
[2:17:01] Eden
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; is already back on the earth
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; because the book has come down. No man
[2:17:07] have to go up for the book. So no man
[2:17:09] can come and make a revelation that is
[2:17:10] not written hidden and all kind of thing
[2:17:11] like that to bring it down. Now the book
[2:17:13] already come down
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; and brother Ram demonstrated
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; the book the deed on the earth.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; So when he said to the fish that died
[2:17:21] little fish I give you back your life.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Pray for fish. May the life of God
[2:17:25] come say I
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; give you back your life
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; because he had dominion
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; over the fish.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; He had power
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; to give the fish life. And the bride
[2:17:36] will have power to give out life. Oh,
[2:17:39] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The spirit will anoint the
[2:17:47] bride and the spirit and the bride will
[2:17:49] have a voice
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; to say come.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Whosoever will they coming.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; So let me prophesy to you. Your family
[2:17:56] coming,
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; your loved ones coming. Nothing can stop
[2:17:59] them from coming because the spirit will
[2:18:01] be here upon the bride. The word, the
[2:18:03] bride becomes the word. The spirit monks
[2:18:05] the pride.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to this from the fourth seed. He
[2:18:14] said, "Wait till them seven thunders
[2:18:17] utter the voices to that group who can
[2:18:19] really take the word of God and hand it
[2:18:21] there."
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Not just any group.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; A group that could take the word
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; and hand it there.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Take the word and challenge devils. Take
[2:18:29] the word and challenge in this message.
[2:18:31] Take the word and hold on the sword. It
[2:18:33] take a faith to hold that sword. Oh,
[2:18:35] give the Lord a shout. The sword can't
[2:18:37] operate on itself. It take a hand to
[2:18:39] hold that sword. Take the word and hand
[2:18:41] it there. The word is the sword. The
[2:18:43] hand of faith holds that sword and
[2:18:45] challenge every devil out there. Oh,
[2:18:47] glory to God. We going to challenge
[2:18:50] every intellectual giant on the field.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God going to raise up
[2:18:55] his Davids that going to challenge these
[2:18:57] intellectual giants that invade this
[2:19:00] message. We coming to get you.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:19:06] [Music]
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Wait till the seven utter the voices.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; That group going to read what a word of
[2:19:14] God handed there.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; It will slice and cut.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; They can close the heavens.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; They can shut this or do that. Whatever
[2:19:22] they want to do.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God, it's his
[2:19:26] word, but he always uses man
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; to work it. God could call for him flies
[2:19:31] down in Egypt. He said, "Moses, that's
[2:19:33] your job. I'll tell you what to do, but
[2:19:35] you go do it." And he fully done it.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; All right. You're a great audience.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Seven out of 18. We're going good.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; I do believe in purgatory. I believe
[2:19:51] it's right now.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; You purge your own soul.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Purgatory means to purge. When you see
[2:19:57] you have done something wrong, get out
[2:19:59] there and clean it out of you by
[2:20:01] confession, crying, fasting, and
[2:20:05] praying.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Someone even laughed at me when the Lord
[2:20:08] came not long ago and give me a vision.
[2:20:10] I always wanted to see about binding
[2:20:12] that serpent. I always wondered how to
[2:20:16] the questions he asking.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; I should step out like that when that's
[2:20:20] what I wanted all my life. Then I begin
[2:20:23] to fast and pray. a prophet
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; fasting and praying.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody said what did you do that for?
[2:20:32] I said in dear
[2:20:34] he said I was not sincere enough
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; after he come then I wanted to purge
[2:20:43] myself
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; or it have a self to purge.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Not wait till you die unless some priest
[2:20:53] try to purge you. purge your souls.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about uh uh Noah and
[2:21:02] the ark and it was hollow. It was uh a
[2:21:07] lighter word, lighter than balsam
[2:21:09] because it was absorbent,
[2:21:11] right? And a real seed of God compare it
[2:21:14] now is absorbent for the spirit. All
[2:21:17] denomination is took out, all unbelief
[2:21:20] is out. And when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:21:22] into that gym of life that's laying
[2:21:24] there, it produces another seed. I am
[2:21:27] Brham because I was born of Charlie and
[2:21:28] Ella Bram that's make me Brham. I'm
[2:21:30] their seed. Their two agreements and
[2:21:32] sperm and seed make me that's make me.
[2:21:35] And when God and his word becomes one
[2:21:38] that is when God's spirit waters the
[2:21:41] seed of God, the word of God, it
[2:21:44] produces God.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; You know he said the secret is the word
[2:21:47] is in the bride. Right? So the spirit
[2:21:50] comes as water to water what's inside of
[2:21:52] you.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; So you don't fully know all what going
[2:21:56] to unfold out of your life when the
[2:21:58] spirit watering spirit for that seed
[2:22:01] inside of you comes to you.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Each one in the upper room received
[2:22:05] their own liquor fire to activate what
[2:22:08] was in them. And God has put things in
[2:22:10] you that has to be activated.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; It come like you get a cell phone. You
[2:22:14] can buy the latest phone of any kind of
[2:22:16] phone. If it's not activated, it's not
[2:22:17] going to work. You can turn in your air,
[2:22:19] show people cover, put cover on it, put
[2:22:21] all kind of nicely, fancy thing and
[2:22:22] thing, but it's not working.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; You have to go to the company
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; and get them activated. And when it get
[2:22:29] activated, then it could work.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Well, that's you,
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; that's me. That's us. That's Peter T in
[2:22:37] the city of Jerusalem.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Until you get activated,
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; until you get power from on high,
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; you shall receive power when after the
[2:22:45] Holy Ghost come upon you.
[2:22:49] Hallelujah.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So power is
[2:22:53] promised.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody take that out of your
[2:22:56] heart.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; You are promised power. Power to live.
[2:23:00] Power to stand. Power to pray. Power to
[2:23:03] say forgive me. Power to say I am wrong.
[2:23:05] Power to overcome. Power to pray. Power
[2:23:08] to have dominion. Give the Lord some
[2:23:09] praises.
[2:23:14] The promise to be weak. The Bible say,
[2:23:17] "Let the weak say,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; I am strong." Give the Lord some
[2:23:20] praises.
[2:23:22] When Joel saw this army, he saw a mighty
[2:23:25] army that shall not break his ranks.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; I want to get some pictures here now.
[2:23:30] Sorry, I didn't get it. And the Chinese
[2:23:31] had a match the other day. You talk
[2:23:34] about rank,

[2:23:37] look at it. Long, long lines. and
[2:23:43] American army working
[2:23:50] army.

[2:24:21] Chinese marching, I was thinking about
[2:24:23] Joel army. They shall not break their
[2:24:26] rank.

[2:24:48] and over until they get it right because
[2:24:51] they wanted to display the world where
[2:24:52] they are reach where they had they were
[2:24:55] celebrating 80 years where Japan a small
[2:24:57] little island conquered them and
[2:24:59] overcome them and Now they are are
[2:25:02] showing victory over that 80year period.
[2:25:05] And for almost 6,000 years, this bride
[2:25:08] have been battered and bruised and
[2:25:10] conquered. And God will wait in the last
[2:25:12] days to show forth this glorious bride
[2:25:15] to show in Satan's Eden what he has
[2:25:18] raised up. He sent a mighty Elijah. He
[2:25:21] sent Eleazar to call out for Isaac. You
[2:25:25] want to tell me that this glorious
[2:25:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost will not be
[2:25:29] released. He said we are looking forward
[2:25:32] for it. God was in a glorious wonderful
[2:25:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is
[2:25:38] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[2:25:40] patience and godliness and brotherly
[2:25:43] kindness and the Holy Ghost itself.
[2:25:46] [Applause]
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises.
[2:25:52] China show their army on display. A army
[2:25:57] in order, a army walking in step, a army
[2:26:00] that is trained. God going to have a
[2:26:02] bride that's going to walk in step
[2:26:05] onward Christian soldiers marching on to
[2:26:08] war with the cross of Jesus
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; going on before.

[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; the spirit will come upon you?
[2:26:28] [Applause]
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the spirit will water the
[2:26:33] word that's inside of you?
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; When God and his word becomes one, when
[2:26:43] God's spirit waters the seed of God, it
[2:26:46] produces God. He said it's not the
[2:26:49] individual.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; It is God.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You are dead.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; You are not yourself no more.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; You reconcile yourself dead
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; hollowed out waiting for the sea germ.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; What is it? It isn't the man. It is God
[2:27:06] in the man.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; It is the sea germ
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; like the beginning the spoken word.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Now you could watch Peter's flesh and
[2:27:15] say he denied Christ. He's a denier. Cuz
[2:27:17] that's what have on Facebook.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; That is what the news report,
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; but it was God in that man.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Because when Anastasia came lying, it
[2:27:26] wasn't to a man they lied to. He said,
[2:27:27] "You lie to the Holy Ghost."
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; And they perish in front of that man.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; That man called Peter.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Because it was not Peter. It was God in
[2:27:35] the man.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; And when Peter was speaking the word to
[2:27:38] Kir's house, it was not Peter.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; It was God in that man. Peter was
[2:27:43] demonstrating what Adam was supposed to
[2:27:44] do because see Jerm was must come from
[2:27:47] the body and Peter was part of the body
[2:27:49] of Christ. So he had life to give out
[2:27:52] and life was coming out of his lips.
[2:27:54] Life was coming out of his mouth because
[2:27:56] it was the spoken word which is the
[2:27:58] original seed. The seed the germ of God
[2:28:02] and when Peter spoke the Holy Ghost fell
[2:28:04] upon those words and and and baptized
[2:28:07] Cornelius with the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Oh praise the name of the Lord. It isn't
[2:28:11] the man. It is God in the man. Oh,
[2:28:15] praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] Hallelujah.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. I'm going to wrap
[2:28:21] up. There he was. He was God made
[2:28:24] manifest. This is Jesus. And he died in
[2:28:27] order to pay the debt of your hybrid.
[2:28:29] There it is. What is it that you could
[2:28:31] die to yourself?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to die, too.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. But I don't hear that in
[2:28:38] the message. No, what you hear is that
[2:28:41] you're the bride, you are this, you
[2:28:42] going straight to heaven. You're going
[2:28:43] glory. Hallelujah. Go straight to
[2:28:44] rapture.
[2:28:47] Like we we talked the other day this
[2:28:48] song on Jordan storing banks I stand and
[2:28:50] cast a wishful eye. That's looking like
[2:28:52] binoculars. You see that's the top part.
[2:28:55] But the bottom part is every place you
[2:28:56] put your foot.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; So you just cast your wisful eye and by
[2:29:00] Canaan and fair and happy land and bound
[2:29:01] for the promised land across there.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; But it's not yours until you put your
[2:29:05] foot
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; and to put your foot yet across Jordan.
[2:29:07] during a reason debt.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; People don't want to die.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; You have to die.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't say amen, you say not
[2:29:17] to die. You know,
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; if you don't die, you will abide alone.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; But if you want to see your family
[2:29:24] delivered, you die.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; And Christ come to life.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The death of a corner wheat,
[2:29:30] you die.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. Watch. He said,
[2:29:34] "There you are. You die to yourself." So
[2:29:36] he died. What is it? That you could die
[2:29:38] to yourself.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; To who?
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; To who?
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yourself. Nobody self. Yourself.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yourself is your whole self. Then
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; yourself is you are talking to
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; some people like talk about the people
[2:29:53] know he doing wrong. She doing wrong.
[2:29:54] I'm not talking about he or he.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Yourself.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Myself. Yourself. The individual. You
[2:30:02] taking ownership of you.
[2:30:05] Let's go. So watch. He said, watch. And
[2:30:09] until you die to yourself, until you are
[2:30:11] no more yourself, and be filled with his
[2:30:13] word, believe in his word, and then the
[2:30:15] Holy Spirit that was in him comes down
[2:30:18] to water that word and make it grow.
[2:30:20] Then what is it? God manifesting,
[2:30:23] continuing the work of his first son,
[2:30:24] his only begotten that died for our high
[2:30:27] breeding life, that he might reconcile
[2:30:29] us back to be sons and daughters of God.
[2:30:32] And through the church, here we go.
[2:30:34] might flow the same life
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; by the word continuing the work being
[2:30:41] manifested as it was in Christ. So the
[2:30:45] church supposed to be like a teaching
[2:30:47] well
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; where the spirit is flowing
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; to continue the work.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible has got to be in you. The word
[2:30:58] is a seed. It it it it's laying there.
[2:31:01] But when it comes in the heart, then it
[2:31:03] begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit
[2:31:05] the works of God. Then vision comes,
[2:31:08] power comes, humility come. All your
[2:31:11] know it all is gone. You become nothing.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Does that sound like the message? That's
[2:31:20] that song messages. You hear that?
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; You become nothing. So where all this
[2:31:25] pride and arrogance going? I'm the
[2:31:27] pride. I am this and this and this.
[2:31:29] Really?
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; You become nothing.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Christ becomes alive.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; You die,
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; he lives
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; because he died, I live. And when I die,
[2:31:43] he lives again.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; And when I die, he promised me life. And
[2:31:46] when I die out of myself so in order I
[2:31:49] can have his life.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; How do we do it? By taking his word.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; So this self have to die. Amen.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; And the question is which self?
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; The bad self or the good self?
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Well, Christians not supposed to have
[2:32:06] bad self.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; That is what the Lord deliver us from.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; So what self is he talking about here?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Job 42 says, "Then Job answered and
[2:32:15] said, I know that thou can't do
[2:32:17] anything, everything that no knowledge
[2:32:20] can be withholden from thee. Who is he
[2:32:22] that hideth counsel without knowledge?
[2:32:25] Therefore I uttered that I understood
[2:32:28] not things too wonderful for me which I
[2:32:30] knew not. And I beseech thee and I will
[2:32:33] speak. I'll demand of thee and declare
[2:32:35] thou unto me. I have heard of thee by
[2:32:37] the hearing of the air but now my eyes
[2:32:40] seeth thee. Wherefore I abhore
[2:32:46] myself
[2:32:47] and repent in dust and ashes. Amen.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; So true job experience which Job didn't
[2:32:53] ask for, volunteer for, offer themselves
[2:32:55] for a battle going on in heaven. A
[2:32:58] debate, a challenge going in heaven and
[2:33:00] job is the recipient or the object of
[2:33:02] this whole lesson that has been on
[2:33:04] display and Job go through all his
[2:33:07] stuff. He's in boils and he come to a
[2:33:09] revelation where he was speaking out of
[2:33:12] timing. He said things he shouldn't have
[2:33:14] said and then he said, "I abhore
[2:33:18] myself and repent and dust and ashes."
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Now look at the next verse there, which
[2:33:23] is verse seven. And it was so that after
[2:33:27] the Lord had spoken these words unto
[2:33:29] Job,
[2:33:31] the Lord said unto Elephite, "My wrath
[2:33:34] is king against thee, against thy two
[2:33:37] friends, for you have not spoken to me
[2:33:40] the thing that is right as my servant
[2:33:42] Job did."
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; So they were in their self-righteous
[2:33:45] mode, thinking Job is a sinner, thinking
[2:33:48] it's because something could do wrong.
[2:33:49] Why disaster is all around him? And they
[2:33:53] didn't realize they are nothing. And
[2:33:55] when Job say I hate myself, God tell
[2:33:58] them guys listen I am against you now
[2:34:02] because you say what Job say.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Job said the right thing.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; He hate himself.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises.
[2:34:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then he said
[2:34:12] take now seven bulocks, seven rams. So
[2:34:14] Eleazar skipping Elifas and Timmonite
[2:34:17] did that and so like that and the Lord
[2:34:19] commanded them. The Lord also accepted
[2:34:21] Job. Here the verse 10. And the Lord
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; turned the captivity of Job
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; when he prayed for his friends.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as
[2:34:33] he had before.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Double for his trouble.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Twice as much that he had
[2:34:38] before.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; He went through a disaster and God
[2:34:41] pulled him through.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; But what Job had to do, he had to say,
[2:34:44] "I hate myself." His friends had to come
[2:34:47] to that same spot and then Job had to
[2:34:50] pray for his friends. Now, if Job didn't
[2:34:51] have a real breakthrough, it's hard to
[2:34:52] pray for them people, you know.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; They're too wicked.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; There's friends, but oh God, there's
[2:35:00] problems. But not Job. He prayed for
[2:35:02] them.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; And when he prayed for them, God was
[2:35:04] able to clear up the whole thing
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; and give him double. Oh, give the Lord
[2:35:08] some praises.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do
[2:35:13] you believe that?
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Abhorance
[2:35:17] of good self. coming to see yourself as
[2:35:20] nothing.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; You're putting yourself in the mirror.
[2:35:22] That's where is that? That's dust.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? I'm going to close.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; God want to kill that good self.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; That message self.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; That long dress cover your knee self.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; That is self
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; cuz you're dressed longer than others.
[2:35:39] You're not wearing hot pants. That self
[2:35:41] we talking about.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; That message self.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; God want to kill that.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God don't want pride and
[2:35:48] arrogance beefing yourself around. God
[2:35:51] want you in humility.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; God want you in surrender.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; God want you healing yourself.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; There too much are bad behaved people in
[2:35:57] this message and I will call it out bad
[2:36:00] behave.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; The other day I preach about your
[2:36:03] character and conduct bring you another
[2:36:05] office.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Character is what God sees who you are.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Conduct is your behavior and attitude.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; Oh praise the B. The Bible said Jesus
[2:36:13] found favor with God and men. That mean
[2:36:15] Jesus learned how to behave himself.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't carrying harm. Jesus make
[2:36:19] way. Make room.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; No. Praise God.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do do you believe that now?
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; And especially when people wrong you or
[2:36:30] even if you are right and they're wrong
[2:36:31] and you forgive them, that's a killing.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; So brotherly kindness really is the
[2:36:36] virtue to kill.
[2:36:41] And that virtue is what will keep people
[2:36:43] out of the kingdom
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; because they did not forgive, neither
[2:36:46] will I forgive you your trespasses.
[2:36:49] Therefore, you'll remain in your sins.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; If you do not forgive, neither will I
[2:36:58] forgive you. Therefore, your sin remain
[2:37:00] it. Amen.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; So to release your brother, you release
[2:37:05] yourself
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; by releasing your brother that did
[2:37:07] something to you and you forgive them
[2:37:09] and drop it. Even if it even if you are
[2:37:11] right and they are wrong, forgive them,
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; talk to them, encourage them
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; or give the Lord some praises.
[2:37:17] Hallelujah. Let me close for I reckon
[2:37:19] that the sufferings of this present
[2:37:21] time, what you're going through, is not
[2:37:22] worthy to be compared with the glory
[2:37:24] that shall reveal in us. For the earnest
[2:37:26] expectation of the creature waited for
[2:37:28] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[2:37:31] so on. I want to skip with earnest
[2:37:34] expectation. The whole creation is
[2:37:35] waiting for what? The manifestation.
[2:37:36] What is the manifestation? Making known.
[2:37:39] So in this promised land, everything
[2:37:41] belongs to us in the promised land. When
[2:37:43] Israel crossed the Jordan in the
[2:37:44] promised land, they fought for
[2:37:46] everything. In the promised land don't
[2:37:47] mean you're immune from sickness,
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; but it does mean it doesn't mean you're
[2:37:51] immune from troubles, but it does spell
[2:37:53] this. The land is yours. Amen.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; That's what you must be convinced of.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I'm going to skip here.
[2:37:59] Hallelujah. Adoption placing
[2:38:02] positionally and so on like that. What's
[2:38:04] the world creation waiting for? The
[2:38:06] manifestation of sons of God is waiting
[2:38:08] for the church to come into position.
[2:38:10] Isn't that right? He said man of
[2:38:11] dominion over the earth. And the whole
[2:38:13] creation is waiting for the sons of God
[2:38:15] to be manifested. waiting God trying to
[2:38:17] place the church in position to manifest
[2:38:20] himself getting the one he can work
[2:38:22] through and say there is my spirit
[2:38:24] flowing freely
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; so Peter's service on the day of
[2:38:27] Pentecost was 15 minutes
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; another hour and a half sermon you know
[2:38:33] 15 minutes and 3,000 people got
[2:38:36] convicted by the Holy Ghost
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; so this six hour sermon sermon
[2:38:43] explaining explaining what we don't even
[2:38:45] Instead of mechanics, a mechanic if a
[2:38:47] mechanic mechanic mechanic fixing wheel,
[2:38:49] tire, battery, all kind of in the car,
[2:38:52] cargo, a little child, three-y old child
[2:38:54] riding a tricycle passing you on the
[2:38:56] road.
[2:38:57] He going somewhere a tricycle
[2:39:00] with with with guider wheels on it
[2:39:04] and you shining, shining, shining,
[2:39:06] polishing, polishing 15 years polishing,
[2:39:11] taking pictures, putting on Instagram,
[2:39:12] posting by the car but the car not
[2:39:13] starting.
[2:39:15] He cannot go in
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; because he's there for pictures.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; We don't want that.
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; You want me to turn the engine to
[2:39:21] tumble?
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; It take mechanical dynamic.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:39:33] We talk about inheritance. All right.
[2:39:35] Missions, come on, please.
[2:39:39] Domain over self. And one of the key
[2:39:41] things I have here, the tongue.
[2:39:44] And and James said, "My brethren, be not
[2:39:47] many masters, knowing that we shall
[2:39:49] receive greater condemnation. For in
[2:39:51] many things we offend all. If any man
[2:39:54] offend not in word, the same as a
[2:39:55] perfect man, and all able to bridle the
[2:39:58] whole body. Behold, we put bits in
[2:40:00] horses mouths that when they obey us, we
[2:40:02] turn about their whole body. The ships,
[2:40:04] though they be great, are driven with
[2:40:06] fierce winds. They turn around with a
[2:40:08] very small helm. Whether ever the
[2:40:10] covenant listed even so the tongue
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; your tongue
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; don't watch your neighbor you know you
[2:40:18] have a tongue
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; that's the one we're talking about
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; even so the tongue is a little remember
[2:40:26] boasted great things behold how great a
[2:40:28] matter is little fire kindleth and the
[2:40:31] tongue is a fire
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; a world of iniquity
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; so is the tongue among your members that
[2:40:37] is defileth the whole body
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; and set it on fire. The course of
[2:40:41] nature, it is set on fire of hell. For
[2:40:44] every kind of beast and birds and
[2:40:46] serpents and things in the sea is tamed
[2:40:48] and had been tamed of mankind, but the
[2:40:50] tongue
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; can no man tame.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; Mark the perfect man.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; He could bridle
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; his tongue.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; He could bridle his mouth. So perfection
[2:41:02] is is is is recognized by the order of
[2:41:06] what we say
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; because life and death is in the power
[2:41:10] of
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; the tongue.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; But the tongue can no man tame is an
[2:41:15] unruly evil full of deadly poison. There
[2:41:18] we bless we God even the father and
[2:41:20] there curse we men which are made in the
[2:41:23] similitude of God. Out of the same
[2:41:25] purses blessing and cursing. My brethren
[2:41:28] these things ought not to be.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm skipping. Proverbs 16:32.
[2:41:34] Love this one. He that is slow to anger
[2:41:38] is better than the mighty
[2:41:41] and he that ruleth his spirit than he
[2:41:44] that taketh a city.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; So you governing yourself is greater
[2:41:49] than a man who actually conquer whole
[2:41:51] city.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; That's how powerful it is having
[2:41:55] dominion over oneself.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:00] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; So Joseph
[2:42:04] conquered the lust of the eyes by
[2:42:06] refusing partition's wife.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; Daniel purposed in his heart he would
[2:42:11] not defile himself with the king's meat.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; His powerful appetite. Moses, the Bible
[2:42:17] said, refused the pleasures of sin in
[2:42:18] Egypt, choosing suffering for Christ's
[2:42:20] sake. And David spared Saul life twice
[2:42:25] when he could have taken it. And he
[2:42:27] could have used vengeance or his pride.
[2:42:30] But David choose to say touch not God's
[2:42:33] anointed
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; knowing he going to someday
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; sit on that throne.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was our example in the
[2:42:43] wilderness.
[2:42:45] He overcome the lust of the flesh, stone
[2:42:47] into bread, lust of the eyes, all these
[2:42:49] kingdoms, pride of life, castel down.
[2:42:52] Cast in other words, show off.
[2:42:55] He showed and demonstrated what it was
[2:42:58] dominion over self. And I'm going close
[2:43:00] with this quote. Begin to play
[2:43:01] something.
[2:43:04] All what we preach this morning ties
[2:43:06] into God's three-fold purpose. One, to
[2:43:08] reveal himself, which is by the word.
[2:43:11] Two, to have the preeminences. Three, to
[2:43:13] bring us back to Eden. To go back to
[2:43:16] Eden is to go back to dominion. When the
[2:43:18] lamb took the book, John by revelation
[2:43:21] understood the restoration of that book
[2:43:24] meant restoration of dominion and
[2:43:26] authority. So we are actually going back
[2:43:29] to the original. That is why we have to
[2:43:32] be concerned about what we speak. And
[2:43:34] this bringing to for St. Mark 11:23, if
[2:43:38] you shall say to the mountain,
[2:43:42] be moved and don't doubt in your heart,
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; you can have what you said.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; So when man fell,
[2:43:55] but Jason, the cherubims came
[2:43:59] to guard the tree. And he's saying here,
[2:44:03] "Now I want to show you and make sure
[2:44:06] it's an altar. This must have been an
[2:44:09] altar at the Garden of Eden." Do you
[2:44:12] remember when Cain and Abel come up to
[2:44:14] worship? So that shows that God's altar
[2:44:16] was moved and set in the Garden of Eden.
[2:44:20] And the only way back to Eden is by the
[2:44:24] altar. Here you are again. See, back to
[2:44:26] Eden through the altar. And they were to
[2:44:29] keep that way. and guard it. They
[2:44:32] couldn't get there until this altar was
[2:44:35] covered with blood. So, it must have
[2:44:37] been an altar. That's right. And before
[2:44:39] this altar, they built a
[2:44:40] substitutionary, another altar. Here is
[2:44:43] the true altar of God is in the heart of
[2:44:45] man. That's where the true altar is.
[2:44:49] Let's all stand
[2:44:51] [Music]
[2:44:57] him.
[2:45:00] How we long to worship
[2:45:05] you. God bless you. Praise the Lord.
[2:45:13] [Music]
[2:45:17] How we long to worship
[2:45:22] you,
[2:45:26] Lord. We come to you
[2:45:30] in worship.
[2:45:34] No matter what
[2:45:37] the
[2:45:38] circumstance,
[2:45:42] no matter what
[2:45:45] the situation,
[2:45:46] [Music]
[2:45:51] we were lift up holy
[2:45:56] hands
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:03] Let it out
[2:46:07] and all
[2:46:11] I long to worship
[2:46:16] you
[2:46:19] and
[2:46:21] [Music]

[2:46:30] worship.

[2:51:42] As the brothers get ready for today's
[2:51:43] offering, let's sing that song. We are
[2:51:47] able to go up and take the country
[2:51:52] and possess the land from Jordan to the
[2:51:56] sea.
[2:51:58] So the giants will be there away to him.

[2:52:29] [Music]

[2:52:45] provide for those that haven't to give.
[2:52:47] Lord may it bless each and every heart
[2:52:49] this evening and may it be used for the
[2:52:51] furance of the gospel in the precious
[2:52:53] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:52:56] To go up and take the country

[2:54:12] him,
[2:54:14] we already won the victory.
[2:54:19] Lift Jesus higher.
[2:54:22] Lift him higher.
[2:54:25] Lift him up for the world to see.
[2:54:29] He said my
[2:54:32] be lifted up on high. I will draw all
[2:54:37] men unto me. Lift Jesus higher. Lift
[2:54:40] Jesus higher.

[2:55:11] He said, "I
[2:55:13] be lifted up.
[2:55:16] I will draw him.
[2:55:20] [Music]
[2:55:21] I command you, Satan, in the name of the
[2:55:26] Lord to take up your weapons and flee.
[2:55:31] Oh, for the Lord has given us the
[2:55:35] authority
[2:55:37] to war all over.
[2:55:41] Oh, lift Jesus higher.
[2:55:44] Lift Jesus.
[2:55:47] Oh, lift him up for the world to see.
[2:55:52] He said, "If I
[2:55:55] be lifted up on high, I will draw him
[2:56:00] for the last time." Oh, lift Jesus
[2:56:03] higher. Lift Jesus high up. Oh, lift him
[2:56:08] up for the world to see.
[2:56:13] He said, "If I
[2:56:15] be lifted up on high, I will draw all
[2:56:20] men unto me."
[2:56:25] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[2:56:28] Hallelujah.
[2:56:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You
[2:56:33] appreciate the Lord this morning. You
[2:56:35] appreciate the message this morning. You
[2:56:37] appreciate your pastor this morning. Oh,
[2:56:40] wonderful. Wonderful
[2:56:43] pathway to dominion. What a masterpiece.
[2:56:45] What a time. What a reminder to us of
[2:56:48] what we are born to do. What we are
[2:56:50] placed here to do. Can we give the Lord
[2:56:52] one more hand of praise?
[2:56:55] Hallelujah.
[2:56:56] Glory.
[2:56:59] Amen.
[2:57:02] So, let's just bow our heads
[2:57:05] as we close out in prayer. Our gracious
[2:57:09] heavenly father, we thank you this
[2:57:11] morning, Lord, for the time in your
[2:57:13] presence, Lord. And Lord, what a blessed
[2:57:16] opportunity and a privilege to be able
[2:57:18] to come to your house of praise, your
[2:57:20] house of worship, your house of training
[2:57:22] and correction, and the house of God's
[2:57:25] bread where we could eat from the hidden
[2:57:26] manner under the seventh seal. Father,
[2:57:28] we thank you, Lord, for the message
[2:57:31] today and the time in your presence and
[2:57:33] how you are shaping and preparing us
[2:57:35] for, Lord, what lays ahead. May you
[2:57:37] strengthen your people in a special way.
[2:57:39] We pray a special blessing upon our
[2:57:41] pastor this morning. That you would
[2:57:43] touch him from the crown of his head to
[2:57:44] the soles of his feet, Lord. May you
[2:57:46] renew his strength as you renew the
[2:57:48] strength of the eagles. Father, you said
[2:57:51] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[2:57:53] their strength, Father. They will mount
[2:57:55] up with wings as eagles. They will run
[2:57:57] and not be weary. They will walk and not
[2:57:59] faint. Father, so Lord, may you bless
[2:58:02] Lord his wife, Father. Lord, may you
[2:58:04] bless all of the ministers and elders,
[2:58:06] the deacons, the trustees, the helps and
[2:58:08] governments, Father. Lord, may you bless
[2:58:11] your church in the precious name of
[2:58:12] Jesus Christ. Father, may you bless all
[2:58:15] the visitors in our gates. May you bless
[2:58:16] those that are connected online, Father.
[2:58:19] And Lord, may you be with your people.
[2:58:20] May you grant traveling mercies and may
[2:58:22] you bring us back at your appointed
[2:58:24] time, Father. Lord, may you bless the
[2:58:26] service this coming Wednesday with our
[2:58:28] precious brother Timothy Redhead from
[2:58:30] Grenada. Lord, may the shout of the king
[2:58:32] be in the camp and may spirit spoken
[2:58:34] words, Lord, be uttered from behind the
[2:58:37] sacred desk, Lord, that chains and
[2:58:40] shackles will be broken, Father. And
[2:58:41] we'll be, Lord, constantly reminded,
[2:58:44] Lord, to have our faith strengthened in
[2:58:46] the present truth, Father. And Lord, may
[2:58:49] you bless the special meetings this
[2:58:51] coming weekend with our brother Jonathan
[2:58:53] Martin from Lord True Word Tabernacle,
[2:58:56] Ohio. Father, Lord, I we know it's going
[2:58:58] to be a mighty time in the presence of
[2:59:00] the Lord. May you bless the tree
[2:59:01] services. May you bring him safely to us
[2:59:04] later this week, Father. And Lord, may a
[2:59:06] revival spark out here in the church in
[2:59:08] a mighty way, Father. Lord, may you
[2:59:10] bless your people, Lord. If there's
[2:59:12] anyone needing a physical touch, Father,
[2:59:14] Lord, may you touch your people. Anyone
[2:59:16] need, Lord, anything from you, Father.
[2:59:18] We unite as a church in faith. If two
[2:59:20] shall agree, touching anything, knowing
[2:59:22] we could have what we ask for, may you
[2:59:24] touch your people. One more time, may
[2:59:26] you bless those that are here, Lord. May
[2:59:28] you bless those that couldn't make it
[2:59:29] today for whatever reason, Father. Lord,
[2:59:31] how the enemy has, Lord, attacked and
[2:59:34] broken into homes and situations, but
[2:59:36] Father, we plead the blood and apply the
[2:59:38] token, Lord, upon our families. And
[2:59:41] Lord, as the Bible say, as for me and my
[2:59:43] house, we'll serve the Lord. So we stand
[2:59:46] in faith knowing that you are a
[2:59:48] deliverer. You are a maker. You are a
[2:59:50] Lord God a restorer. May you bless your
[2:59:52] people in the precious name of Jesus
[2:59:54] Christ. We commit them into your hands
[2:59:56] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[2:59:58] Amen and amen and amen. You may be
[3:00:00] seated for a few announcements.
[3:00:04] Hallelujah.
[3:00:07] Glory. service continues this coming
[3:00:09] Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. as we have
[3:00:13] announced. Brother Tim Redhead from
[3:00:15] Grenada uh will be ministering to us
[3:00:17] this coming Wednesday. We encourage you
[3:00:20] to make every effort to be here this
[3:00:22] coming Wednesday looking for a special
[3:00:23] time in the Lord. And as we see things
[3:00:26] happening, we don't believe there's much
[3:00:28] time left. We want to make every effort
[3:00:30] that we have to this uh this coming
[3:00:34] Friday, there will be no service this
[3:00:35] coming Friday. All of our efforts we
[3:00:38] want to focus on this coming weekend.
[3:00:41] Our service on Saturday at 3 pm for the
[3:00:44] entire church service this coming Sunday
[3:00:46] at 10:00 a.m. and at 4:00 p.m. our
[3:00:50] brother Jonathan Martin from True Word
[3:00:52] Tabernacle, Ohio will be here to
[3:00:54] minister to us and we are under great
[3:00:56] expectation for a time in the Lord and I
[3:01:00] want you to come under great expectation
[3:01:01] for it as well. Uh all are welcome. We
[3:01:04] have also invited uh the local churches.
[3:01:07] So we expect some believers to be
[3:01:09] joining us uh sometimes over the over
[3:01:12] the services. So uh come under great
[3:01:15] expectation. Bring your fire. Come under
[3:01:16] great expectation for God to do
[3:01:18] something special for you and for your
[3:01:19] family. Invite someone. Reach out to
[3:01:22] someone who is not here today. Let them
[3:01:23] know we're having a a season of revival
[3:01:25] that starts with this Wednesday night
[3:01:26] with brother Tim and then this weekend
[3:01:28] with brother Jonathan Martin. with
[3:01:32] respect to Sunday's service. Uh it's two
[3:01:35] services. Of course, you are welcome to
[3:01:37] walk with your lunch. Um but there is
[3:01:40] also provision made u for $50 for a meal
[3:01:44] and a drink. The menu is downstairs. So
[3:01:48] if you are interested in purchasing a
[3:01:50] lunch for the middle of the two services
[3:01:53] this coming Sunday, please see the
[3:01:56] sisters downstairs so that we could be
[3:01:58] able to take care of that. um $50. It
[3:02:02] includes the drink as well. And of
[3:02:04] course, if you want to walk with your
[3:02:06] own meal, you're certainly welcome to do
[3:02:07] so. But the most important thing we want
[3:02:10] to encourage the entire church is to not
[3:02:13] miss any of the services. Make every
[3:02:15] effort. God will see the effort. He will
[3:02:18] reward the effort. And this coming
[3:02:20] Saturday in particular, it's for the
[3:02:22] entire church, but is dedicated to the
[3:02:24] young people. So, we want to make an
[3:02:25] extra push to get all of the young
[3:02:28] people here at the church and um and of
[3:02:31] course the two services on Sunday. I
[3:02:33] think they'll be critical for the church
[3:02:35] as well as to the believers from the
[3:02:38] other assemblies that will be joining us
[3:02:39] as well. Uh looking for God to do
[3:02:42] something special for us. um maintenance
[3:02:45] team group four please meet with brother
[3:02:48] Malon Alexander after the service and
[3:02:52] next week Sunday Lord willing group two
[3:02:54] is called to serve. I do believe with
[3:02:56] having the weekend of services we will
