[29:56] If have your Bibles, I like you to turn
[29:57] to Psalms 63. You want to read 1:3 and
[30:00] Matthew 5 1 verse verse 6.
[30:04] Psalms 63. Read it from verse one. Oh
[30:08] God,
[30:10] thou art my God, early will I seek thee.
[30:14] My soul thirsteth for thee.
[30:17] My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[30:21] thirsty land where no water is to see
[30:25] thy power and thy glory. So as I have
[30:28] seen thee in the sanctuary, because thy
[30:31] loving kindness is better than life, my
[30:34] lips shall praise thee. Matthew 5:6
[30:38] reads, "Blessed are they which do hunger
[30:41] and thirst after righteousness,
[30:44] for they shall be filled." May God bless
[30:47] his word. You may be seated.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Have a title, a message, thirsting for
[30:56] life.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; That's the title. Thirsting
[31:00] &gt;&gt; for life.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; I know you know that God put a thirst in
[31:03] you.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a thirst
[31:07] &gt;&gt; and they know the devil job is to try to
[31:09] cover that thirst with channel it in
[31:11] other areas
[31:12] &gt;&gt; but there's a genuine thirst that God
[31:14] put in his heart
[31:16] &gt;&gt; in his people
[31:18] &gt;&gt; listen to these words God created a man
[31:20] to have a thirst
[31:21] &gt;&gt; your makeup you were made to thirst
[31:24] &gt;&gt; God made you that way you cannot help it
[31:28] because you thirst God made you do it
[31:31] but God made you to thirst after him
[31:34] &gt;&gt; so This thirst is built in.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; This thirst is inside of you.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Some challenge it in football, in
[31:41] sports, some challenge with sex,
[31:43] sometimes with woman, with money, with
[31:44] drink, but is a thirst.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; But that thirst that deep inside of you,
[31:49] looking for fulfillment,
[31:51] &gt;&gt; looking for completion, looking for,
[31:54] amen, a better life.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; If God put that inside of you,
[31:58] &gt;&gt; but the Bible said thy loving kindness
[32:00] &gt;&gt; is better than life. That means it have
[32:03] more than what we interpret as life.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Some people interpret life as a house, a
[32:07] car, a land, a husband, a wife,
[32:09] children, family, whatever it is. They
[32:10] interpret life in all different kind of
[32:12] ways. But there is a real life.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the beginning was the
[32:16] word.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; The word was with God and the word was
[32:19] God and the word became flesh. In him
[32:22] was life
[32:24] &gt;&gt; and the life was the light of men. So
[32:26] God put the life in the word and put the
[32:29] word as a seed and put the seed inside
[32:31] of you.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Did you get that now?
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So God put the word life
[32:39] inside the word.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; He put the word as a seed
[32:42] &gt;&gt; and put that seed inside of you
[32:44] &gt;&gt; and put a thirst inside of you.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; That from the seed inside of you,
[32:48] &gt;&gt; you are thirsting for life. And for us
[32:51] who have received a seventh thunder
[32:53] revelation but give us faith
[32:55] &gt;&gt; that faith in us is testing
[32:58] &gt;&gt; for the life
[33:00] &gt;&gt; of second Peter 1 4-7.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Not a life that you seen on a board
[33:08] faith and virtue knowledge but the
[33:10] actual life itself.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon talk about the
[33:15] tress of spirit
[33:16] &gt;&gt; the fountain of love.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. blue and all these colors,
[33:20] perfect colors. The color of redemption,
[33:23] it was perfect and it has come under the
[33:25] earth it get perverted the colors. But
[33:27] on your beginning or before the
[33:29] beginning, these were the original.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; This is where you come from.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; This is where your dream come from. This
[33:35] is where your thought come from.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. This is where he wrote
[33:39] the lamb's book of life
[33:41] &gt;&gt; and put you in that book
[33:43] &gt;&gt; as a name. Hallelujah. as a gene, as a
[33:46] germ, as a seed in the lamb's book of
[33:50] life. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[33:53] Hallelujah. And you bypass your
[33:54] theophony. You bypass your work body to
[33:57] come on the earth to be tempted and
[33:59] tested. But there is something in you
[34:01] thirsting to get back where you were
[34:03] before.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; In him was life and the life was the
[34:08] light. So God found a prophet. Oh, glory
[34:11] to God. By which he could walk through.
[34:13] His name is William Brham. And through
[34:15] that prophet, he released the light in
[34:18] the form of the word, even the evening
[34:21] light. And in that light is what we
[34:23] walking in tonight. Give the Lord some
[34:25] praises.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said
[34:32] this, this was such something for me to
[34:34] say it. Jesus said, "Blessed are they
[34:37] that do hunger and thirst after
[34:38] righteousness." There's not some pastor
[34:40] say that. There's not an evangelist that
[34:42] say that. This is Jesus said that.
[34:44] Blessed are they that do hunger and
[34:47] thirst after righteousness for they
[34:50] shall be filled.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; For they shall be filled.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; What he means by that I receive the word
[34:57] and the word the word in me. Thy filling
[35:00] &gt;&gt; they shall be what?
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Shout out filled.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Filled with something.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; You could be filled with foolishness.
[35:06] You could be filled with unbelief. You
[35:08] can be filled with intellectualism. You
[35:09] could be filled with your own thoughts
[35:10] and ideas or you could be filled with
[35:12] God.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; But you shall be filled.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; If you do what? Hunger and thirst after
[35:17] righteousness.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; That's a separating thing all together.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; It people live their life dead and gone.
[35:22] They have money and what not. They sick
[35:23] and they're dead and gone.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; And that's it. They go to hell too.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; That's not what God calling you for.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Some people blow their brains out. They
[35:31] can't stand life no more. They commit
[35:33] suicide.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say there is something more
[35:35] than this life
[35:36] &gt;&gt; because this life is not what you think
[35:38] it to be. Yes. Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; It's a perverted life.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Brother, he said now watch. Jesus said,
[35:45] "Blessed are they that hung and thirst
[35:46] for righteousness, for they shall be
[35:48] filled."
[35:49] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to even thirst.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; So if you're thirsting tonight, you are
[35:54] blessed already.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; You could just thank God and shout. You
[35:57] could praise God.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; No wonder why your people quiet in the
[36:01] message.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; They're not blessed to be thirsting.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed if you thirst.
[36:07] Blessed are you that hunger just to just
[36:09] to be hungering tonight.
[36:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I come here
[36:13] hungry, you know. Praise God. I almost
[36:16] for announcement, you know. Come with
[36:18] your cup empty. Come on expectation.
[36:21] Come for your filling. Come for your
[36:23] refilling. Come for your miracle.
[36:26] Hallelujah. Come for your healing. Oh,
[36:28] glory to God. Maybe I should have put it
[36:30] out, but it's already out already. When
[36:32] you come, you're coming for the healing.
[36:34] You're coming for your breakthrough.
[36:36] You're coming for victory. You're coming
[36:38] for deliverance. You're coming to go
[36:39] back home. Give the Lord a shout and be
[36:42] the same way. You're coming to be
[36:44] changed and transformed by the renewing
[36:46] of your mind.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reframe your mind
[36:52] &gt;&gt; and everything changes around you.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; My my my brother Brandham says, watch.
[37:02] It's a blessing to even thirst. But the
[37:05] devil has tried to make you think of
[37:07] something else. But the thirst was given
[37:09] to you by God.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, how dare you take that blessed
[37:14] holy thirst that God give you to thirst
[37:16] after him and try to satisfy it with the
[37:18] things of the world, with television
[37:20] programs, with drinking, with big
[37:22] sprees. The devil has perverted
[37:24] instrument of his own and taking that
[37:27] thirst that God gave you to thirst for
[37:28] him and making you thirst after the sins
[37:30] of the world. And every thirst that you
[37:32] had should be for him.
[37:34] I'm thirsting for God. God bless you
[37:36] with this. You're still thirsting. God
[37:38] bless you with that. You're still
[37:39] thirsting. You can get money, house,
[37:41] car, land, husband, wife, children. God
[37:43] bless you, but you're still thirsting.
[37:45] David a king David bless. Oh God, he
[37:49] said my heart thirst longing. Another
[37:53] scripture David says as the heart panted
[37:54] after the water broke, so my th soul
[37:56] thirst after living God. Why don't you
[37:58] hear people thirsting anymore? Because
[38:00] they are satisfied.
[38:02] Get tight loud this year. Rich and have
[38:05] need of nothing, but you need God
[38:07] tonight. You need life tonight. You need
[38:10] the anointing tonight. You need that
[38:12] covering.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have we got a time tonight.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't care if there's two
[38:23] people inside tonight. I was coming.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Numbers don't bother me or
[38:27] intimidate me. We were two three people
[38:29] in Kaiwa. Praise God. be we over be
[38:32] overloaded tonight. Oh, glory to God.
[38:34] Hallelujah. It's it's it's breaking out
[38:35] in multitudes tonight.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; I have a bump for you. Let me let me get
[38:40] it here.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Every one of you, my Catholic friends in
[38:44] here.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; So, we call them
[38:47] rebuke Roman.
[38:52] See, my Catholic friends,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; every one of my Protestant friends,
[38:56] &gt;&gt; I just love every one of you.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we Could we Could we have
[39:02] this boy?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; You hear this man talking?
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; I love every one of you.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; God knows whether that's true or not.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not playing words.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not playing this verbal gymnastics.
[39:16] I'm not playing this intellectual
[39:18] wordify game, this message game. I'm not
[39:20] playing that.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; God knows whether that's true or not.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Watch the prayer line. When the blind
[39:28] and lame, it doesn't say Catholic.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Here sets some man on the platform, a
[39:36] Catholic
[39:38] dying with cancer,
[39:40] eat up. He come to my house
[39:44] and the Holy Spirit come upon him
[39:49] and heal him of that cancer.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He never told him whether he was
[39:56] Catholic or not.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; I never said a word to him. He come over
[40:02] and was baptized in the name of Jesus
[40:05] Christ.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; And received the Holy Ghost.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; There sets the man right there.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; A businessman in Louisville.
[40:16] He goes down further. He don't ask
[40:20] whether you are Catholic or not.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; It is whether your heart is hungering
[40:27] after God.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; You see how far the message world is
[40:37] &gt;&gt; from the principles that the prophet
[40:39] brought.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it go.
[40:43] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[40:46] after righteousness for they shall be
[40:47] filled. Is that right?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; The man is a Catholic and a man get
[40:51] healed.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost come upon him.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Not a man bunny ears with mysteries
[40:57] &gt;&gt; or bunny ears with some spokewood book
[40:59] or or I had to bring revelation.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; None of that.
[41:05] The Holy Ghost came upon that man
[41:08] &gt;&gt; and heal him. You need a message my
[41:11] brother fellowship. Oh up they falseus.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; You see the foolishness how far from God
[41:19] this thing is
[41:20] &gt;&gt; just religious
[41:22] &gt;&gt; enticing spirit deceiving people.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; David said my soul thirst after thee.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; My soul thirsteth.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Watch. My flesh longeth for thee.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In a dry and thirsty land
[41:39] where no water is listening
[41:43] &gt;&gt; I know I feeling take a drink you know
[41:47] water I sure I want to drink no not that
[41:49] you know he said the place dry
[41:53] &gt;&gt; that the level of thirsty talking about
[41:55] &gt;&gt; I real thirsty
[41:56] &gt;&gt; if everybody come to church
[41:58] &gt;&gt; this coming Sunday
[42:00] &gt;&gt; real thirsty
[42:01] &gt;&gt; something have to explode
[42:04] &gt;&gt; but people follow their thoughts
[42:06] &gt;&gt; follow their dreams
[42:07] full of the ideas, full of their own
[42:09] understanding. I'm here to not I'm not
[42:12] here to confirm your revelation.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to confirm your dream. I'm
[42:16] not here to confirm what you think it's
[42:18] supposed to be. I'm here to minister the
[42:19] word of God.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is receive it.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; If we off run for your life, but if it's
[42:28] the word, receive it.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Act upon it. And God to heal you, seal
[42:33] you, deliver you, refill you, baptize
[42:35] you, re restore you, redeem you.
[42:38] Whatever you have need of, he going to
[42:39] do it for you.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Bam. Say the word life has a compound
[42:47] meaning. It mean more than one thing.
[42:49] Life itself means an existence. So then
[42:52] if thy loving kindness is better than
[42:54] life, then that would what what would be
[42:56] any any better? Because God alone has
[42:58] eternal life. God alone has eternal
[43:00] life. He said now everything that has a
[43:02] beginning has an end.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of days, no ending
[43:07] of years. Therefore, we have to become
[43:09] part of God by birth to live.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; And have external existence. Like we
[43:15] read a quote says the reason Mary had us
[43:18] to go into the upper room because she
[43:19] was born a human.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And she had to be born again
[43:24] &gt;&gt; by the spirit
[43:25] &gt;&gt; in order to go to heaven.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; She can't claim I'm Mary, mother of
[43:29] Jesus. that couldn't work. She can't
[43:31] pass the pie gates with that. So, she
[43:33] had to hit the upper room because she
[43:34] was born a human. So, her testimony of
[43:36] giving birth to the Messiah can't
[43:38] qualify her to enter into glory.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Could you Could you could you could you
[43:42] say amen?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; So, she had to hold herself up in the
[43:46] upper room. Virgin Mary with Mary
[43:48] Magdalene, prostitute Mary.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; All of them had to hit it up there.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; For the spirit to fall upon them.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; You don't hear that much in the message
[43:57] because they don't want the spirit to
[43:58] fall. They want the Baptist doctrine.
[44:00] The message has become Baptist.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; When I believe, I have it.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Well, continue to believe in the devil
[44:06] believe and trembling. And here I have
[44:08] it.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; So, you better go to more than
[44:11] believing.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; You have to go to receiving.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; You have to go to hungering
[44:16] &gt;&gt; and thirsting after what? After
[44:17] righteousness.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; This take you beyond the church.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; The church not controlling your
[44:22] hungering and thirsting. This this go
[44:24] beyond who's your pastor, what you
[44:26] believe, what is the teaching that goes
[44:28] beyond that. God know if you're hung
[44:30] hungering, if you're washing your wares,
[44:32] if you're washing your car, if you're
[44:33] eating, if you're drinking I know what
[44:35] hunger look like. I know hungering feel
[44:37] like are you hungering? What you
[44:39] hungering for? To gossip, to lie, to
[44:40] cheat, to whatever. What you hungering
[44:42] for?
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Keep hungry for more money. We get more
[44:47] money. You know what happen more money?
[44:49] More spend.
[44:52] True.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; The more money they get, the more money
[44:54] they spend.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; They hung up a car
[44:59] &gt;&gt; and have to get the car. You can't see
[45:01] them in service. Nobody can't take them
[45:02] astray.
[45:04] Friends, car give up friends. No
[45:07] sacrifice.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And all these things is like the devil
[45:10] wearing mask, friend mask, family mask,
[45:13] all kind of mask. The devil behind
[45:15] natural because it killing your thirst.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; And anything that killing your thirst,
[45:20] that is why it's anti- good for people
[45:23] to not seek the Holy Ghost.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Because anytime you don't want to press
[45:29] into the spirit, man go catch you. The
[45:31] devil go catch you. He'll catch you in
[45:33] your mind because our intellect can
[45:34] defeat no devil. The intellect couldn't
[45:37] work. Oh, glory to God. He not have
[45:39] other men for the lust after. He didn't
[45:41] have another booze place and all kind of
[45:43] boos house in the garden of Eden. It was
[45:45] just God's word. The day you eat, that
[45:47] day you die,
[45:48] &gt;&gt; we have to come back to the word
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and believe just what God said. No
[45:53] compromise.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Sin and suffering and everything must
[46:04] come to a place where it has no
[46:07] existence.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Because it had a beginning.
[46:11] So gray hair, old age, pain, suffering
[46:13] has to come to an end.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that had a beginning.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; And if that have a beginning, that have
[46:18] an ending, too.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? There was a time
[46:23] when there was no sickness, no sin, no
[46:25] sorrow, no death. And then it come by
[46:27] perversion. So if all the perversion
[46:30] must end back back, it has to go a
[46:32] beginning, has to end, then eternal life
[46:34] can ever exist. Do you see what I mean?
[46:37] That's the reason, here we go. It is
[46:40] totally impossible for any person to be
[46:42] ever saved outside of the new birth
[46:46] because men are born again of the spirit
[46:48] of God and become part of God.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And their existence is eternal as God is
[46:54] eternal.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? A man could stop
[46:56] smoking, stop drinking, stop running a
[46:58] woman, stop all his bad behavior and
[47:01] still go to hell.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Do you understand something supernatural
[47:04] have to take place in that man life in
[47:07] your life? something that your father
[47:08] can't give you, your mother can't give
[47:10] you, your husband can't give you, money
[47:12] can't give you, your wife can't give
[47:13] you, your children can't give you. It's
[47:16] only God could give you. Give the Lord a
[47:19] shout. Somebody say, "Amen."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; This is good. When you come to church
[47:28] now, you focus not on a man, not on
[47:30] teachings,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; but you focus on Jesus. Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; I was preaching to Miami over the
[47:34] weekend. I was telling them that brother
[47:36] Brandham came to introduce Jesus Christ.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; People seem to forget that.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came to introduce that
[47:41] message quarrels, church battles, church
[47:44] wars. That is foolishness. That is
[47:45] Lucifer again in behind the pulpits.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; He came to introduce Jesus Christ.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God.
[47:57] As John the Baptist was sent, so God
[48:00] sent that man,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; William Reynold
[48:03] &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ came down in Revelation
[48:05] 10,
[48:06] &gt;&gt; a mighty angel
[48:08] &gt;&gt; and seven thunders throw their voices
[48:10] out
[48:11] &gt;&gt; to God as a bride together
[48:13] &gt;&gt; to give the bright faith
[48:14] &gt;&gt; to show how to prepare. Seven thunders
[48:17] throw their voices out. He came to
[48:18] introduce the thunders.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord I shout in your house. My
[48:24] God, this is good tonight. This going
[48:26] down nice.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; This eating good.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. William Brham came to
[48:32] introduce the seven thunders
[48:34] &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The
[48:36] eighth messenger.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout in the house.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Those disciples them Greeks come over
[48:48] Jesus. I know disciples. Ah come here. I
[48:50] have a book to show you. You know you
[48:51] know who preaching this. You know
[48:53] &gt;&gt; I know the Bible say that you know they
[48:55] say sir we receive Jesus.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And they brought them straight to Jesus.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Straight to who?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Straight to who?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Not straight as some church
[49:04] &gt;&gt; to the person.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; And that person tell them except a
[49:09] corner weight
[49:10] &gt;&gt; fall into the ground and die. That
[49:11] person glad to meet you. I am Jesus. No.
[49:14] He said go and die.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Get out your train that spirit.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Get out your human spirit. Get your
[49:20] feeling and your feeling all your
[49:21] emotions you can't judge right because
[49:23] you're caught up in your own feelings.
[49:24] Cut that feeling crap out
[49:27] &gt;&gt; and get to understand God have a feeling
[49:29] too. He said my thoughts are not your
[49:30] thoughts. My ways are not your ways. Get
[49:32] my thoughts. You will kill your feelings
[49:33] and begin to speak the way God speaks
[49:35] and think the way God thinks. He have a
[49:37] way he thinks.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; So as a human being you feel this way
[49:42] and you feel that way. But how does God
[49:43] feel about the thing?
[49:48] All right, let's go on. How we going?
[49:50] You going good?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; All right, so watch. I give unto them
[49:55] eternal life. And it comes from the work
[49:58] the Greek word z o e zoe. Zoe is God.
[50:03] God's own life.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; That is why I'm talking about you got to
[50:07] have humanistic fate, humanistic
[50:10] patience. You see, that's not the
[50:13] patience of Jesus Christ. He's not
[50:15] talking about your human patience and
[50:17] your human temperance. So, you might
[50:19] look at your long patience, some people
[50:20] have it longer than others, and look at
[50:22] a brother with his short fuse. We call
[50:24] him short fuse. And you think you better
[50:27] than he
[50:30] &gt;&gt; But you are no better than he because
[50:31] you human with your long human patience
[50:34] and he human with his short one. And you
[50:37] say, "God, he's blood his skin." Yeah,
[50:39] he blood his skin. He need the
[50:41] temperance of
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; And then he blood come back inside
[50:45] because the blood of Jesus blood of
[50:46] Jesus Christ not close to your skin. The
[50:48] blood of Jesus Christ is a little deeper
[50:49] than that. You know
[50:51] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ a little
[50:53] deeper than that. Your blood close to
[50:55] your skin. You can't stand this one. You
[50:56] can't take on this one and whatn not.
[50:58] That not the blood of Jesus Christ. The
[50:59] blood of Jesus Christ completely
[51:01] different. He he just go to the
[51:02] unlovable. He just go to the lost. He
[51:04] just go to those that are far off. He
[51:06] just go Hallelujah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; People you don't expect. He is going
[51:10] after them
[51:11] &gt;&gt; and restore them and bring them back.
[51:13] Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; So this word Zoe is eternal life. He
[51:18] said we exist eternally like God exists.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Notice now watch there's a real true
[51:24] spirit of love. Spirit of
[51:28] &gt;&gt; love. There's a real true spirit of
[51:30] loyalty. Let me put this inside of here.
[51:33] And there's a real true spirit of
[51:35] brotherly kindness.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Not the text.
[51:39] Not the talk of it, but the real spirit
[51:43] of it.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; There's a real true spirit of honesty.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And remember sometime I was telling you
[51:51] and this how I I visualize it. This how
[51:53] I see it is like the spirit of honesty
[51:56] like a color. So somebody's honest the
[51:58] color is pure that in the spirit realm
[52:01] you could see that is an honest person.
[52:04] When that person is not honest the color
[52:06] is not the same. So out of you will be
[52:09] going out colorless then in the spirit
[52:11] realm. So when that guy came on the
[52:13] platform and brother Brandham saw him he
[52:14] said you're not sick. You're a preacher.
[52:17] You want a revival. How many want a
[52:19] revival here? And brother say how many
[52:21] want a revival. What is happening there?
[52:24] He's discerning the man's spirit. The
[52:26] man is not sick. The man is thirsting.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; The man is hungering. The man wants
[52:32] something more than the physical. He
[52:34] want an inside revival. You want an
[52:36] inside job. You want something to awaken
[52:39] your spirit because that is what a
[52:41] revival does. It renews your love for
[52:44] God. It renews your faith in God. It
[52:47] renews your prayer to God. It renews
[52:50] your study of God.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cry to get in the spirit. A
[52:55] passion to know the word and a fervent
[52:57] desire to please God. That is what
[53:00] revival does. Don't give the Lord a
[53:02] shout in the house.
[53:05] Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to realize I don't take
[53:11] Wednesday lightly.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I don't
[53:17] &gt;&gt; watch
[53:19] &gt;&gt; this great fountain of all eternity was
[53:22] the spirit of love,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; joy, the spirit of honesty. That spirit
[53:28] of truth in this perfection.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then out of the existence of
[53:33] the father went the logos
[53:36] which was the son which was the
[53:38] theophony which was the body of the
[53:42] great Jehovah God went forth in a
[53:44] celestial body that's the logos.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; The word spoke out of them great
[53:51] fountains of life and went forth and
[53:53] there was the theophony which was God
[53:56] made into the word.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this invisible supernatural
[54:00] Elohim being
[54:03] &gt;&gt; conformed himself into this celestial
[54:06] body
[54:07] &gt;&gt; called the theophony
[54:09] &gt;&gt; called the logos
[54:10] &gt;&gt; called the word.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And that is what was in the beginning.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Then that the offering here we go was
[54:20] made flesh.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; In the person Jesus Christ.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then all the fullness of the
[54:26] trinity dwelt in him. Both father, son,
[54:28] and holy spirit all in that. And that
[54:31] very way we go plumb back to the
[54:33] original beginning of God. There we are
[54:35] born again.
[54:37] Not of flesh,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; born again, not of the blood, but born
[54:43] again by the spirit.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And in that eternal spirit of love and
[54:49] honesty comes down to make it place in
[54:52] us.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then when we die from this
[54:55] life, we go into a body.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[54:59] we have a theophony to go into a body
[55:01] celestial. Then at the coming of the
[55:03] Lord Jesus, this body is picked up from
[55:05] the earth again and made into a
[55:07] glorified state to live in his presence
[55:09] forever. Then all the perversion, all
[55:11] the things that was in the perversion
[55:13] goes out of existence.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Flesh goes to its punishment. Hell opens
[55:17] up a mouth and swallows up the evil and
[55:19] the perversion. and God and his beloved
[55:21] church, his bride take their stand for
[55:24] the eternities to roll on. That's the
[55:25] great hope of the Christian church. Oh,
[55:28] give the Lord some praises.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Another way he phrased it, the ray of
[55:37] light went forth. It was a ray of love.
[55:40] That's the main one, red. The next color
[55:42] follows which was blue. Blue, the tress.
[55:44] Next followed was another color. And
[55:46] through the seven perfect colors, which
[55:48] is the seven spirits of God that went
[55:50] forth from that great fountain,
[55:52] &gt;&gt; that great diamond that Jesus spoke of,
[55:55] that great diamond was jicked to reflect
[55:57] these colors. God was made flesh, dwell
[56:00] among us that he might reflect his
[56:02] goodness and mercy among us by gifts and
[56:04] signs and wonders. Reflect his gifts,
[56:06] his mercy. Oh, glory to God among us by
[56:09] signs and wonders. Oh, glory to God.
[56:13] Hallelujah. That whole big rainbow had
[56:16] become into a theophony and made in the
[56:18] image like a man. Yet he wasn't a man.
[56:21] He didn't have flesh. Yet he was a
[56:22] theophony. He was no one mezzed.
[56:24] Hallelujah. And Jesus made a priest
[56:26] after the order of Melzdc. Had no
[56:28] mother, no father. Oh, glory to God. Get
[56:31] me excited tonight. Hallelujah.
[56:33] Hallelujah. He had no mother, no father.
[56:36] Mechzedc. Oh, give the Lord some
[56:38] praises. We are going back to that word.
[56:41] We are going back to that theophony. We
[56:43] are going back to the expression where
[56:44] we came from. Oh, give the Lord some
[56:47] praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:51] Glory to God.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; My Lord, Moses said, I see I I would
[56:55] like to see you. And God hid him on a
[56:58] rock. And when he passed by, Moses said
[57:00] it looked like the backpack of a man.
[57:03] Hallelujah.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "But Brandham, we find him out
[57:06] here meeting Abraham." before that in
[57:09] the order of MelchzDC a body of flesh
[57:11] which was God. Sure it was. He was God
[57:14] in flesh. You said then brother Brandham
[57:16] why would he have to come back and be
[57:18] born. He wasn't born then. He was
[57:21] created a body that he dwelt in
[57:22] Melchazedc the king of Salem which is
[57:25] the king of Jerusalem which is the king
[57:26] of peace which had neither father nor
[57:28] mother nor beginning of days or end of
[57:29] life. But Jesus had both mother and
[57:31] father and a beginning of days and end
[57:33] of life. He was made after the order of
[57:36] Melzdc which had no beginning of days or
[57:38] end and of life. Mechzedc was God
[57:41] himself. Melzedc was Jehovah God. The
[57:44] same one that met Abraham years later in
[57:46] front of his tent. Isn't that right? But
[57:48] Jesus Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord
[57:50] some praises. Hallelujah. Jesus was that
[57:52] word made flesh. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[57:57] Hallelujah.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; David cried out, "Thy loving kindness is
[58:00] better than life." The word life have a
[58:03] perverted aspect to it because that even
[58:05] life itself has a perverted aspect. And
[58:07] many times people like to refer to life
[58:09] having a big time drinking, riing, going
[58:12] out. They said this is life. How
[58:14] mistaken they are. That's death. It's
[58:16] not life, it's death. This what he said.
[58:18] Now watch devils are worshiping. Every
[58:21] knee shall bow. but to know him in the
[58:25] pardoning of your sins and the renewing
[58:28] of your life by his spirit. That great
[58:31] fountain of all the resource of the
[58:33] goodness dwelling in you. God making you
[58:35] bring the fruits of love, joy, peace,
[58:38] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[58:40] gentleness, patience, faith, all these
[58:42] great attributes which come from God
[58:43] alone. That's the only way to have life.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So this gospel come for you to have a
[58:47] better natural life. You get a better
[58:49] home, you get a better car, you get
[58:51] better house, get better this and what
[58:53] and you get you get better holding that
[58:55] do
[58:56] &gt;&gt; there's not the gospel in
[58:58] &gt;&gt; this come that you could become a
[59:00] reflection
[59:01] &gt;&gt; of that perfection
[59:03] &gt;&gt; because the reflection is the perfection
[59:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and you become what you behold
[59:12] &gt;&gt; that's why if you watch a bandit long
[59:13] enough you become a bandit too a thief
[59:15] long enough you become a thief too you
[59:17] you reflect what you Amen. You kind of
[59:20] reflect what you're looking at.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go. So the word life has been
[59:30] misinterpreted to us. We call life.
[59:32] Somebody get a new car. We go down the
[59:34] road just whiz, have a drink. The arm
[59:37] around a girl. A young fellow said,
[59:39] "This is life." Young lady with a choice
[59:41] boyfriend, she got a drink or two, she
[59:43] said, "This is life." Or maybe the man
[59:45] who always wanted lots of money all of a
[59:47] sudden he falls air to a great amount of
[59:49] money. He will build a great home. He
[59:50] will get the finest of car. He will
[59:52] scream this is life. The poor little
[59:55] wash with her babies. She get a trip to
[59:57] Hollywood. She come a queen for a day or
[59:59] some program. She said this is life. But
[1:00:01] how perverted is that's death. Those
[1:00:03] will perish who have it.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Now this thing that you call life become
[1:00:07] so miserable. Many times people take
[1:00:10] their life. So it could not be the life
[1:00:12] that God was speaking of because you
[1:00:13] cannot take God's life. Neither can you
[1:00:16] give God's life that lays by sovereign
[1:00:19] grace in the hands of God alone. But
[1:00:21] this mortal perverted thing you have
[1:00:23] life called life. You can take what you
[1:00:26] so desire. But to show you that life how
[1:00:29] miserable it becomes. This what we call
[1:00:30] life now is only a shadow or a negative.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; We all like to rejoice. We all we can
[1:00:39] rejoice over the right thing, but this
[1:00:41] part is deep. So I want to take my time
[1:00:44] with this. Thank you for coming out
[1:00:46] again tonight.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; We can rejoice over the right thing that
[1:00:50] shows that we are hooked up to the real
[1:00:52] thing.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; When we rejoice over the right thing,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; but when we rejoice over the wrong
[1:00:57] thing, here we go. It shows we are
[1:01:01] hooked up with the wrong thing.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; This is the part I want to get to. So
[1:01:06] our life can tell right now what we are
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; which way our emotions are running.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; I've never seen this before. This is
[1:01:15] this is deep. There's another quote. He
[1:01:17] say we are here what we are
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; somewhere else.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Somewhere else.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's that's deep. If we are rejoicing
[1:01:24] over the world and the evil things our
[1:01:26] minds and our souls are inspired by
[1:01:29] below.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. If we rejoice in the spirit
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; that we have eternal life,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; we raise our emotions to God
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; and praise him, then we have joy.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So you see the message world that
[1:01:46] deemphasize worship and figure is a kind
[1:01:48] of lecture thing people sit down and
[1:01:50] stare and stick their hands so and do so
[1:01:52] and write notes and no praise and
[1:01:54] worship. That guy's foolishness in God's
[1:01:55] sight.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He is saying here you connect to the
[1:02:00] right thing. You would raise your
[1:02:02] emotions to God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And praise him.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; There must be praises going up.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; If any lamb took the book, John say all
[1:02:15] in heaven, all under the earth heard, I
[1:02:17] praise God. And people talk about they
[1:02:19] see the name of the book and they sit
[1:02:20] down dead in church. That can work in
[1:02:22] here. That ain't no scripture for that.
[1:02:24] Okay. The Lord I shout we are not
[1:02:26] Pentecostals. We are not Baptist. We are
[1:02:28] not Catholics. Glory. We claim to be the
[1:02:30] elect lady, Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus told the woman of
[1:02:36] the well, the hour come is we're the
[1:02:38] true worshippers. He make sure he say
[1:02:41] what time. Not just worshippers. The
[1:02:44] true worshippers, but worship the
[1:02:47] father. Come on, write with me. In
[1:02:49] spirit and in truth. For the father seek
[1:02:52] such.
[1:02:54] He seek such. He look for them. When you
[1:02:59] start to praise God, the anointing is
[1:03:00] going to come over you. Oh, give the
[1:03:02] Lord a shout in the house. You can get
[1:03:05] healed tonight. You can get delivered
[1:03:07] tonight. You can get sealed tonight. Oh,
[1:03:10] God. Those online, you can get healed
[1:03:12] tonight. You can get delivered tonight.
[1:03:15] Oh, God. Right in your house. Those are
[1:03:18] in your house. Praise God. Create an
[1:03:20] apple right inside your house.
[1:03:28] You may be
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; seated.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little deeper.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; The reason Jesus said,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; "Whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[1:03:37] after her hath committed adultery with
[1:03:41] her already in his heart."
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; See, it is where your emotion is set is
[1:03:47] where your thoughts is.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So the Bible said we set our affections
[1:03:55] on the things above.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; That's a choice
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; that is intentional.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; You have to want to do that.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Why something people have to want to
[1:04:04] learn?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible said knowledge shall shall
[1:04:13] increase. Even with AI right now, you
[1:04:16] can access any information you want. how
[1:04:19] to cook Italian food,
[1:04:22] how to make chairs, how to fix this. I
[1:04:25] remember one time a mechanic came to
[1:04:26] check my car and he couldn't he get
[1:04:28] stuck. I just I said, "Look, look, you
[1:04:30] had you had to move this here.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't just I ain't no
[1:04:35] mechanic."
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; But the information is right here.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; So knowledge shall increase for you to
[1:04:42] be a fool, to be ignorant. You have to
[1:04:45] choose ignorance as opposed to knowledge
[1:04:48] which is information to manage the
[1:04:50] challenges that's in front of you.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; You can't be foolish.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; You got to be wise.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; If you are not changing, change will be
[1:05:01] changing all around you.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; So you stay as you are
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; and change will change around you and
[1:05:06] then you'll get squeezed.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; God sets it up this way. You know
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; the age we're living in.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] I remember years ago cell phone was a
[1:05:19] privileged thing. There's only certain
[1:05:20] people before cell phone had this pager
[1:05:21] thing inside your privilege have a pager
[1:05:23] beep beep
[1:05:25] send a message you come with pag
[1:05:29] pager nobody a paging you know
[1:05:33] long time student have to come with with
[1:05:35] with with a calculator and and a compass
[1:05:38] or what all that in your phone now
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; you make calculator by itself try to
[1:05:42] sell calculators
[1:05:44] that finish with
[1:05:46] cell phone now you're a target because
[1:05:48] they can I knew.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Do you realize your cell phone is like a
[1:05:51] beeper? I am here.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; This is my cell. Yeah. Like you that by
[1:05:56] find all all the names looking all all
[1:05:59] miss rapture. They go to the cell phone.
[1:06:04] Only people lock your cell phone. How
[1:06:05] about go I didn't know they put outside.
[1:06:08] They could find you.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; There's no privacy any cell phone is a
[1:06:12] big beeper. I am here. Beep beep beep
[1:06:15] beep beep.
[1:06:17] Amen. Listen
[1:06:23] to this one. Well, tonight this is some
[1:06:26] message I have to bring and I have to
[1:06:28] finish. So, private don't do don't don't
[1:06:29] close your eyes on me.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; This day I am this day to see a young
[1:06:35] lady who went to a psychiatrist.
[1:06:38] She's 35 years old. Never smoked. Never
[1:06:41] drank in all her life. Very fine girl.
[1:06:43] Her people are Christians. Her father is
[1:06:45] a doctor. She give life. She he she gave
[1:06:48] her life to Christ at an early age. And
[1:06:49] what does she do? She goes out. She gets
[1:06:52] to a place the college where she was
[1:06:53] teaching and the psychiatrist there he
[1:06:56] sat down to talk to her. He said, "You
[1:06:57] mean you never have been kissed by a
[1:06:59] boy?"
[1:07:01] She said, "No, not one time in all my
[1:07:02] life. You mean you never even had a
[1:07:05] little drink, been to a party? Never."
[1:07:09] Said, "Girl, you don't know what you're
[1:07:11] missing." Now, him being a psychiatrist,
[1:07:14] he swung. Listen, he swung the girl's
[1:07:17] mind
[1:07:19] until now she has become so evil and so
[1:07:23] bad she don't even want to hear the name
[1:07:25] of Jesus spoke to her in her presence.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And even her father and mother can't
[1:07:31] even see her no more. She lost her mind.
[1:07:34] And this next week we'll go to the
[1:07:36] institution for shock treatment.
[1:07:39] It's because
[1:07:40] that she turned her thoughts from Christ
[1:07:44] onto what the psychiatrist was moving
[1:07:47] moving her mind. And that is what we are
[1:07:50] here for this morning is to move your
[1:07:53] mind.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Your thinking from the things of the
[1:07:57] world onto the things of God which is
[1:08:00] eternal.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And that is what his preaching is for.
[1:08:03] is to pervert the thinking to a higher
[1:08:06] better and to a place where Christ is
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; until you become converted.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; When your mind reaches for those things
[1:08:13] which are above.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; So you're not coming to church to be
[1:08:19] grounded and pulled down in the flesh.
[1:08:21] You're coming to church to be boosted
[1:08:22] and push up to the heavenly spot.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; This year is to strengthen you. It's to
[1:08:28] pull you up.
[1:08:32] The girl, they're thinking she might
[1:08:34] take poison out anytime. Life becomes so
[1:08:36] miserable until they kill themselves and
[1:08:38] take poison everything else. David said,
[1:08:40] "My soul thirsted for thee."
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; As in a dry land
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; where there was no water.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; God made a man with a thirst
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; that is part of the human being. It's
[1:08:53] this thirst. But God made the thirst in
[1:08:55] man to thirst for God. And the devil has
[1:08:57] perverted it and make it a thirst for
[1:08:59] his kingdom, for the world. Do you get
[1:09:00] it?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. A thirsting man is godly for God
[1:09:04] made man to thirst for God.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Take that blessed Holy Spirit that God
[1:09:08] placed a thirst in your soul to call for
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; and you satisfied with nightclub
[1:09:14] somewhere. No wonder you got a headache
[1:09:16] the next morning. Case of beer, go to
[1:09:18] your house, sit down, drink it, trying
[1:09:20] to satisfy that godly thirst that God
[1:09:22] put in your soul to thirst after him.
[1:09:24] That's the devil's slump.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; But David surrendered himself. That's a
[1:09:28] choice.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a choice.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Like when I preach about um Amen. the
[1:09:34] message in in in Lagos talking about uh
[1:09:37] uh uh uh the secret place of the most
[1:09:39] high.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I shall dwell under the shadows of the
[1:09:42] almighty.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I would see of the Lord. He's my rock.
[1:09:45] He's my refuge. It's a choice.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; What you say, what you want.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The women out there, they don't care.
[1:09:53] Look how they dressing and wearing. But
[1:09:55] the men, the brothers have a choice to
[1:09:57] look or don't look
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; because they don't care. You know, it's
[1:10:01] a spirit on them.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; They want to display their flesh. They
[1:10:04] want to act or they act. That's their
[1:10:05] choice. But we have a choice also.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; My soul is thirsting like a in a dry
[1:10:14] land where no water is. I thirst for
[1:10:15] thee, oh God. And that's what makes
[1:10:17] things different is the thirst that God
[1:10:19] give you. If you satisfied with the
[1:10:22] water, come to me all you are thirsty.
[1:10:24] Come and drink of the fountains of life
[1:10:26] freely without money, without price. You
[1:10:28] say, "I am not satisfied, brother." No
[1:10:31] wonder it's God dealing with you. God
[1:10:34] trying to bring you to something. That's
[1:10:36] why it takes God to convict somebody of
[1:10:38] their past life. Convict somebody of how
[1:10:40] they have lived. You have regrets and
[1:10:42] God want to convict you. You know why?
[1:10:44] You don't want to go back that way. You
[1:10:45] don't want to walk that way. You wish
[1:10:46] you had made different decisions. But
[1:10:48] you have an opportunity tonight to make
[1:10:50] better decisions. Hallelujah. that God
[1:10:54] will approve your step. He orders my
[1:10:56] step. He can order your step from
[1:10:58] tonight. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:11:01] Hallelujah.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Do not be deceived. Oh my. The devil has
[1:11:07] another way. We just have a moment left
[1:11:09] for this. The devil have another way to
[1:11:11] pervert. Now, this one is tricky.
[1:11:14] You say, "I don't drink, brother. I
[1:11:17] don't smoke. I don't gamble. I wouldn't
[1:11:20] run out of my husband or my wife. I live
[1:11:22] a good life. But the devil has perverted
[1:11:24] that. This is it. Now, this is message
[1:11:26] talking about
[1:11:29] he lets you think to satisfy your guilty
[1:11:32] conscience that you go join a church and
[1:11:33] you're all right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You're in this fellowship now in this
[1:11:38] tabernacle now
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and you're you're fine. And what I've
[1:11:42] been preaching for the longest while the
[1:11:44] message world is flood of entitlement
[1:11:46] people
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; them figure because they have some book
[1:11:48] on tape and they believe brother Brandon
[1:11:49] they going to rapture which rapture that
[1:11:51] the rapture down in Port Spain
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; it's a local rapture that not the Bible
[1:11:55] rapture you talking about here because
[1:11:56] the Bible rapture have a condition for
[1:11:58] it
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; it talk about oil
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; it talk about rapture in faith it talk
[1:12:03] about this being when it's completed is
[1:12:05] a servant of God in the church of God
[1:12:06] that going to rapture it say this being
[1:12:08] standing by the pulpit for 50 is with no
[1:12:11] life and character.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; It said this being
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; completed
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; which is the perfect man when it's
[1:12:17] completed.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Not halfway.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Not halfway. When
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; completed,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; it's completed is the servant of God in
[1:12:27] the church of God.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I here for 30 years. What was what
[1:12:32] was complete? What? People just getting
[1:12:34] old.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; No change, no transformation. To grow is
[1:12:37] to change. Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; To grow is to learn.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just age away.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; We want to grow. We want to be
[1:12:43] transformed.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; So here what the devil does, they don't
[1:12:51] smoke. They don't drink. They running
[1:12:52] coke. They run a woman. They whatnot and
[1:12:54] like that. Not taking drugs, but they in
[1:12:56] church.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; They are soldier.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Not not me army Lord.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Church soldier.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; They love church more than God.
[1:13:10] Brother,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; you can't get satisfaction by joining a
[1:13:16] church.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Get the bomb now.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; You only become mental.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's an intellectual affair.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And these characters so perverted they
[1:13:27] want to blast an extra.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Them absole making noise.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; We have a low noise level.
[1:13:36] So does the Catholic church.
[1:13:41] You can't get satisfaction by joining a
[1:13:44] church. You can only become mental. It's
[1:13:46] an intellectual affair. You will never
[1:13:48] be satisfied until you know him.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; This is big tonight.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Not know the mysteries, not know
[1:13:56] trumpets and vials and what is between
[1:13:58] the sixth and the seventh trumpet and
[1:13:59] the sixth and the seventh vial and the
[1:14:00] sixth and the seventh plague and all of
[1:14:02] that.
[1:14:03] You know all between
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; you never be satisfied until you know
[1:14:14] him
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; as the forgiveness of your sins
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; where the sin question is settled
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; this thing but the woman caught in the
[1:14:21] act of adultery. Let me just go fast
[1:14:22] down now. When Jesus said neither do I
[1:14:26] condemn thee
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; go and sin no more and free her.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; It is incredible. that nobody was there.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; What is she supposed to do? Black hat.
[1:14:38] Jesus, forgive me. Jesus, forgive me.
[1:14:39] Just forgive me.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; No, she had that revelation.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; She had that personalized experience.
[1:14:47] You have to get that.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody will watch you, point finger
[1:14:51] at you, want to go back in your past,
[1:14:52] want to go back in your sin. Even the
[1:14:53] devil is the accuser. He can't. He only
[1:14:56] watching accusing. That's his old job.
[1:14:57] What you do? Accuse, accuse, accuse,
[1:14:59] accuse, accuse. Jesus stand and say, "I
[1:15:01] drop your charges. I dismissed their
[1:15:02] case. I died for them. I paid the price.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; So don't play devil inside of here and
[1:15:11] accuse.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Joining church
[1:15:16] won't do it. That's only perverting the
[1:15:19] real cause.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You see, if the people are not pointing
[1:15:21] to the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; you have to point them to the church.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; The minister and some solid four-hour
[1:15:27] mysteries.
[1:15:29] Got to hit them hard with some solid
[1:15:32] things that will that gray matter day
[1:15:34] there and head day will hit them solid
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; mental stuff. I call it verbal
[1:15:40] gymnastic. You flip flipping here do a
[1:15:43] somersault here and whatnot. And you're
[1:15:44] taking 20 hours to do them somersaults
[1:15:46] on verbal gymnastics. At the end of the
[1:15:47] day they need the Holy Ghost. They need
[1:15:49] God. They need a breaking up. They need
[1:15:50] to get out the human spirit. They need
[1:15:52] to get out the humanistic realm and get
[1:15:54] into the spirit of the living God. When
[1:15:56] David saw the ark coming down, David,
[1:15:58] they just walk off normal. He said to
[1:16:00] dance and when he start to dance on
[1:16:02] white problems
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; and them non dancers in the message go
[1:16:06] get problems when we start to dance. We
[1:16:08] start to dance yet. We only getting we
[1:16:10] warming up. We start to dance yet.
[1:16:12] Dancing coming, you know, shouting
[1:16:14] coming, you know. Oh, glory to God. This
[1:16:16] place right now, it too small for me
[1:16:18] this morning. It too small for me
[1:16:20] tonight. Just know I can run, put on the
[1:16:22] microphone, run, make a run, and come
[1:16:24] back. Hallelujah.
[1:16:26] Glory to God. Because the lamb is worthy
[1:16:28] to take this book. To loose the seals,
[1:16:30] to put my name on that book, to free me
[1:16:33] from men. Free from the Catholic Church.
[1:16:35] Free from bishops and message. Oh, glory
[1:16:38] to God. Free tonight. I could fly.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, Somebody say they thought
[1:16:49] T was dead.
[1:16:52] They thought we were dead.
[1:16:55] will be alive and picking
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; that come when he snake bite spoil they
[1:17:02] looking so some people looking for die
[1:17:05] you know
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; true
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; could this happen that happen they're
[1:17:06] looking they're looking they can't wait
[1:17:10] and Paul just shake it off
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; still alive and kicking
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; but the Bible says joining church won't
[1:17:17] do it that's only perverting the real
[1:17:20] cause if the devil can't get you out of
[1:17:22] those things.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; All right. If the devil won't get you
[1:17:28] out of those things, he will take you to
[1:17:30] a this other. But don't settle here we
[1:17:34] go for nothing less than a oldfashioned
[1:17:37] experience of the new birth to be born
[1:17:40] again of the spirit of the eternal God.
[1:17:43] When your soul and God locks together
[1:17:45] and you become one,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; that is what God wants you
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; to connect with him. The ministry is
[1:17:52] supposed to be a channel to connect you
[1:17:53] to God.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Not a channel to come to the ministry. A
[1:17:56] channel to connect you to God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; We are servants of God.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Like the disciple, true
[1:18:05] disciple, they brought them Greek
[1:18:06] straight to Jesus. And Jesus told them
[1:18:08] you had to die to Trinidad spirit.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Die to the human spirit.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Your human spirit had to break up.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; That go in the presence of God. God
[1:18:17] break that out. Whether CC CXCGC the
[1:18:20] degree doctor degree whatever you think
[1:18:22] you are who you think you are all that
[1:18:23] breaking up
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and your soul come up to the God
[1:18:26] presence.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; My as the heart ped for water book but
[1:18:34] ram dramatized about the sheep the heart
[1:18:37] and the he got wounded and he talk about
[1:18:39] the dogs trying to bite and bite piece
[1:18:42] of the flesh and the hungs of hell is
[1:18:43] after every one of you. He only wants to
[1:18:45] get you away from the shepherd once and
[1:18:47] they grab them and they drink a handful
[1:18:49] out of them and a mouthful and David as
[1:18:52] the heart is sping after the water
[1:18:54] broke. So, but Brandon must have seen a
[1:18:55] vision to describe it that way
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; that the heart is wounded
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; because the dog grabbed piece of his
[1:19:01] flesh and if only water could give him a
[1:19:03] fresh charge.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Only water could give him a revival.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; If water could give him the spurt to
[1:19:09] fully escape the dog. So, he is hungry.
[1:19:12] He is thirsty. He is going after water
[1:19:15] as the heart planted after the water
[1:19:17] broke. So my soul, that's how because
[1:19:19] the house of hell is after you.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Let's finish here now.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; The little deer knows. Let me see where
[1:19:28] I'm at. Page 8 of 11. I'm going on page
[1:19:31] nine. But Gideon, get ready. Stephen,
[1:19:33] get ready. David said as the hard puke,
[1:19:37] he has to go and find water brook or
[1:19:39] perish. Lord, let that be our soul
[1:19:42] today. wounded. If I can't find the
[1:19:44] waterbrook, the hungs will get me pretty
[1:19:46] soon.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; If I could only find that that
[1:19:48] waterbrook,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; the little deer knows it's either death
[1:19:51] or the waterbrook.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; They said, "Just as the deer know it's
[1:19:55] dead or the waterbrook, that's the way
[1:19:56] my soul is thirsting after day."
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I got to find you or perish.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; If you could only find that kind of a
[1:20:03] life.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Blessed are they that
[1:20:05] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[1:20:07] for they shall be filled."
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; May that be the motives of this church
[1:20:10] this morning. May your affections be
[1:20:12] tuned from the things of the world, the
[1:20:15] cares of the world, whether it's your
[1:20:17] house being cleaned, whether it's your
[1:20:18] farm being weed, whatever it is, may it
[1:20:20] be turned to God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I love in kindness is better to
[1:20:24] me than my own life.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; My soul thirst after thee like a dry
[1:20:28] land and like the heart for the water
[1:20:29] books, my soul must find thee or perish.
[1:20:31] When the Brham tabernacle
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; gets to that place,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; the little isms will drop out the doors.
[1:20:38] The differences will all be settled out
[1:20:40] and Christians will be Christians and
[1:20:42] there will be a spot that will be talked
[1:20:44] of around the world when any
[1:20:46] congregation of people will thirst for
[1:20:48] God in that manner.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on,
[1:20:51] Headstone Tabernacle. He said if any
[1:20:54] congregation thirst for God in that
[1:20:56] manner,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; thy loving kindness
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; is less than life.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; with a brand.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; God help me. Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you, I'm just reading
[1:21:10] that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:12] Ghost and you would like to receive the
[1:21:15] Holy Ghost. I want you to listen
[1:21:16] carefully. I'm closing how brother
[1:21:18] Brandham approached this. He is
[1:21:20] ministering in the realm of the spirit.
[1:21:22] This is the spirit ministry here. He's
[1:21:25] ministering to people at the end of the
[1:21:26] service. This is a message called the
[1:21:28] reaction to an action.
[1:21:30] I'm going to ask you that hasn't got the
[1:21:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you like
[1:21:36] to receive the Holy Ghost, here's the
[1:21:38] time to start it. You are here in
[1:21:40] campgrounds. You're here at a time to
[1:21:42] receive it. You know that no one will be
[1:21:45] in the rapture without the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; There'll be a sleeping virgin the rest
[1:21:49] of the dead live not for a thousand
[1:21:50] years. That's it. Move right out this
[1:21:52] way, my friend. That's it. All of you,
[1:21:55] young fellow, push the boy here in the
[1:21:57] chair and he's speaking now. You that
[1:21:59] want the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:01] would you come up also? Come right over
[1:22:03] here. Stand up on your feet and say,
[1:22:05] "I'm in business, but I'm in business
[1:22:07] with God. I've got a little word in my
[1:22:09] heart tonight. A little bit of spirit
[1:22:11] that tells me if I mix this promise of
[1:22:13] God with the spirit that's telling me I
[1:22:15] can receive the Holy Ghost tonight. I'm
[1:22:17] coming to receive it." Is there enough
[1:22:19] spirit in you to tell you that God will
[1:22:21] do it for you tonight? If there is,
[1:22:24] raise up your hand. If you believe you
[1:22:26] got enough courage in you, there's
[1:22:27] enough Holy Ghost conviction spirit
[1:22:29] telling you that tonight you can receive
[1:22:31] the baptism. Is there? Come up here.
[1:22:33] Let's have a word of prayer and go over
[1:22:35] here so we can now lay hands on you and
[1:22:37] pray. Don't you come if you really want
[1:22:39] to come. That's right. Blessed are they
[1:22:41] that do hung on to have righteousness
[1:22:43] for they shall be filled. The Bible said
[1:22:44] so. God can't favor his words. What are
[1:22:46] you doing now? You are making
[1:22:48] preparations. How long have you sought
[1:22:50] the Holy Ghost? A long time. Long time
[1:22:53] you have sought the Holy Ghost. Now he's
[1:22:55] here tonight. What happened? Maybe you
[1:22:57] was down and just about ready to give
[1:22:59] up, but that's what happened. I want
[1:23:01] some of the cooperating ministers, if
[1:23:04] they will, go over with these people
[1:23:07] here to instruct them how to pray and
[1:23:10] give thanks to God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Some ministers here that knows God. Any
[1:23:17] of you brothers here that knows God,
[1:23:19] come over here. Four or five of you over
[1:23:21] here, come. Some of you stand right here
[1:23:22] along here. We're going to pray for
[1:23:24] them. How many of you gospel ministers
[1:23:25] in the building? Raise your hands.
[1:23:26] Gospel ministers, we're not questioning
[1:23:28] your your denomination. We want you
[1:23:30] here. Come here. All of you ministers,
[1:23:32] we need you here. Here's the time.
[1:23:34] Praise God.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe the Holy
[1:23:38] Ghost is for you today? What did Peter
[1:23:40] say on the day of Pentecost? He said,
[1:23:41] "Men and brethren, what can we do?
[1:23:42] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:23:44] in the name of Jesus for remission of
[1:23:46] your sins, and you shall receive the
[1:23:47] gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promises
[1:23:49] unto you and to your children, to them
[1:23:51] that are far off." that we're going to
[1:23:52] pray for these people.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; All you ministers stand by and pray.
[1:23:55] Then we're going to take them over to
[1:23:57] the altar and they're going to receive
[1:23:59] the Holy Ghost. Every one of them. Do
[1:24:00] you believe that?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; There are six nights of this service.
[1:24:06] Don't you come from your knees till the
[1:24:08] Holy Ghost has baptized you and then
[1:24:10] there'll be a revival break out. Then he
[1:24:13] said here now let's bow our heads. All
[1:24:15] you Christians pray father here are
[1:24:19] already confessed Christians. They read
[1:24:21] in the Bible that just those who have
[1:24:23] oil in the lambs went into the wedding
[1:24:26] supper. They're coming tonight to
[1:24:28] receive the oil. They seen a few minutes
[1:24:31] ago by having a meal already in the
[1:24:33] barrel. There's a mixing around here.
[1:24:36] They come for self-sacrifice to feel the
[1:24:38] hot burning fires of the baptism of the
[1:24:40] Holy Ghost that will light up the cross
[1:24:42] of Christ in their hearts and fill them
[1:24:44] with power and glory. And the baptism of
[1:24:46] Holy Ghost granted God. Anointed
[1:24:48] ministers are standing by them. We are
[1:24:50] here Lord to pray the prayer of faith.
[1:24:52] We want to see a great revival brick
[1:24:53] into this community. Now each one of you
[1:24:57] seeking the Holy Ghost go right this
[1:24:59] way. Ministers are going with you over
[1:25:01] there and stay there till the Holy Ghost
[1:25:02] comes. I want to deal with the rest of
[1:25:04] the congregation. He went on to pray.
[1:25:07] How many personal workers are in the
[1:25:09] building? Bless you, Sister Rosella.
[1:25:11] Would you come? Is there someone else a
[1:25:13] good personal worker that would like to
[1:25:14] be standing presence when the Holy Ghost
[1:25:16] fills someone? Would you like to do it?
[1:25:18] Any of you women? Any of you man, you
[1:25:20] woman go to woman. You men go besides
[1:25:22] men. Stand there. Be sincere. Drive at
[1:25:25] that devil. Defeat him. He's a defeated
[1:25:28] person. Do you believe that? He's just a
[1:25:30] big bluff. He has no legal rights over
[1:25:32] us. We are free children born of the
[1:25:34] spirit. We have a right to this God's
[1:25:36] heritage. We believe it.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Fill my cup, Lord.
[1:25:44] I lift it up,
[1:25:47] Lord.
