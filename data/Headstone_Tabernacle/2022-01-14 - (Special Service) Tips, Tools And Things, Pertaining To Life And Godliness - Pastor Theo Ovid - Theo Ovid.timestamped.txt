[13:50] and um
[13:52] if you have your bibles i'd like to
[13:53] return to genesis chapter 41
[13:55] we want to read from verse 14.
[14:14] but isaac uh you're hearing me i see
[14:17] something pop up here about restarting
[14:19] my computer but um
[14:21] so in case
[14:23] uh it trips
[14:25] you will know what to do just hold on
[14:30] okay so genesis chapter 41
[14:33] verse 14 to 46.
[14:36] and the title of what i want to share
[14:38] tonight is tips
[14:40] tools
[14:41] and things
[14:43] pertaining to life and godliness tip
[14:46] tips tools and things
[14:48] pertaining to life
[14:50] and godliness
[14:52] um
[14:53] let's read genesis 41
[14:56] verse 14 then pharaoh sent them called
[14:57] joseph
[14:58] they brought him history out of the
[15:00] dungeon and he shaved himself
[15:02] changed his arraignment and came in onto
[15:05] fear
[15:05] and pharaoh said unto joseph i have
[15:07] dreamed a dream and there is none that
[15:08] can interpret it i have heard say of
[15:11] thee that dark hands understand a dream
[15:13] to interpret it
[15:14] and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is
[15:17] not in me god shall give fear an answer
[15:19] of peace
[15:20] and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream
[15:22] behold i stood upon the back of the
[15:23] river and behold they came up out of the
[15:25] river seven kind fat fleshed and well
[15:27] favored and they said in the middle and
[15:29] behold some of the time came after them
[15:32] poor
[15:33] very ill-favored and lean fleshed such
[15:35] as i have never saw in the land of egypt
[15:37] for bald for badness and the lean and
[15:40] ill-favored kind they eat up the first
[15:43] seven fat kind
[15:44] and when they're eaten up it could not
[15:46] be known that they're eating them but
[15:48] they were still ill-favored at as at the
[15:51] beginning so i awoke
[15:53] and i saw in my dream and behold seven
[15:55] ears which came up in one stalk full and
[15:58] good and the old seven ears withered
[16:00] thin and blasted with the east winds
[16:02] sprung up after them
[16:03] and the thin ears devoured the seven
[16:05] good ears and i told this unto the
[16:07] magicians but there was none that could
[16:09] declare to me
[16:10] and joseph said on the fear the dream of
[16:12] pharaoh is one
[16:14] god had showed pharaoh what he is about
[16:17] to do
[16:18] the seven good kind are seven years and
[16:21] the seven good years are seven years the
[16:23] dream is one the seventeen and your
[16:26] favorite kind that came up after them
[16:28] are seven years and the seven empty ears
[16:30] blasted with the east wind shall be
[16:32] seven years of famine
[16:35] this is the thing which i have spoken
[16:37] unto pharaoh what god is about to do is
[16:40] show it on the field
[16:42] behold there come seven years of great
[16:44] plenty toward all the land of egypt and
[16:46] they shall arise on them after them
[16:48] seven years of famine and all the plenty
[16:51] shall be forgotten in the land of egypt
[16:53] and famine
[16:55] shall consume the land
[16:57] and the plenty shall not be known in the
[16:58] land by reason of that family following
[17:01] for it shall be very grievous look at
[17:04] this verse 32 here fourth and fourth
[17:06] that the dream was doubled onto pharaoh
[17:09] twice
[17:10] it is because
[17:12] the thing
[17:14] is established by god
[17:16] and god will surely shortly bring it to
[17:19] pass
[17:20] now therefore let pharaoh
[17:22] look out
[17:24] a man discreet
[17:26] and wise and set him over the land of
[17:28] egypt
[17:29] let pharaoh do this
[17:31] let him appoint officers over the land
[17:34] and take up the fifth part of the land
[17:36] of egypt in the seven plenteous years
[17:39] and let them gather all the food of
[17:41] those good years that come
[17:44] and lay up corn
[17:45] under the hand of pharaoh and let them
[17:48] keep food in the cities and that food
[17:51] shall be for store to the land against
[17:53] the seven years of famine which shall be
[17:56] in the land of egypt that the land
[17:58] perished not through the famine and the
[18:00] thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh
[18:02] and the eyes of all his servants and
[18:04] pharaoh said unto his servants can we
[18:06] find such a one as this a man in whom
[18:10] the spirit of god is
[18:11] and theory said unto jesus for as much
[18:13] as god
[18:14] that showed thee all this there is none
[18:16] so discreet and wise as god
[18:19] though shall be over my house and
[18:20] according unto thy word
[18:22] shall all my people be ruled only in the
[18:25] throne will i be greater than thou
[18:27] and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have
[18:30] set thee
[18:31] over all the land of egypt
[18:34] and pharaoh took of his ring from his
[18:35] hand put it upon joseph's hand
[18:38] i read him investors of fine linen and
[18:41] put a gold chain about his neck and he
[18:44] made him to ride in the second chariot
[18:45] which he had and they cried before him
[18:47] bowed the knee and he made him ruler
[18:50] over all the land of egypt and pharaoh
[18:52] said unto joseph i am fair
[18:54] and without thee
[18:56] shall no man lift up his hand or foot in
[18:59] all the land of egypt and pharaoh called
[19:01] joseph's name that patanaya and he gave
[19:04] him to wife
[19:06] asanas the daughter of potiphara priest
[19:09] of on and joseph went out
[19:11] all the land of egypt and joseph was 30
[19:14] years old when he stood before fear
[19:16] rooking of egypt and joseph went out
[19:18] from the presence of pharaoh
[19:20] and went
[19:21] throughout all the land may god bless
[19:23] his word
[19:25] so i think this is a special night we
[19:28] just said nothing in special service for
[19:29] special service but i see a sort of see
[19:33] a opening
[19:34] that we could share things that we will
[19:35] not
[19:36] usually or normally share
[19:38] uh written a service for regular service
[19:41] even though tonight will be sold as
[19:42] scripturally based and this night is
[19:44] like a set of foundation for where we
[19:46] want to go
[19:47] uh similar to what isaac did on as a
[19:50] tuesday by the study i want to draw from
[19:54] this
[19:54] tips tools and things pertaining to life
[19:56] and godless as a broad canvas
[19:58] of the opportunities that we have
[20:00] to share things pertaining to god's
[20:02] kingdom to put in our lives
[20:04] and
[20:06] as we are hearing it here
[20:08] now
[20:09] this word
[20:10] established
[20:12] um the definition of established is
[20:15] accepted
[20:16] and recognized
[20:18] or followed by many people
[20:20] like established rules customs
[20:23] and traditions
[20:25] and i use this word because this is what
[20:27] was used in the scriptures
[20:29] that this double dream
[20:31] this double vision as it was he said
[20:33] because it is established
[20:35] by god
[20:36] so god sent it twice
[20:39] see
[20:39] and this established means
[20:42] having
[20:43] existed
[20:44] for a long time
[20:46] therefore recognized as good
[20:48] or successful
[20:50] like you say all established family
[20:53] successful for a long period of time
[20:56] widely known so this is what establishes
[20:59] growing or flourishing successfully
[21:02] as an established plant to establish
[21:04] flower garden
[21:06] the synonyms
[21:07] for establishes changeless
[21:10] constant
[21:12] determinate
[21:13] set
[21:15] settled
[21:16] stable
[21:18] steadfast
[21:19] steady
[21:21] and i see that as a backdrop
[21:24] to show
[21:25] marriage
[21:27] and the family
[21:29] was established by god
[21:32] and marriage
[21:34] is the oldest institution in the world
[21:37] marriage was performed first
[21:40] and instituted
[21:42] in the garden of eden
[21:45] now i know it's a queer approach to
[21:47] start with jesus
[21:49] and start with pharaoh
[21:51] and start with this dream
[21:53] but is a very interesting thing
[21:56] to know
[21:58] that when something is established
[22:01] when a news is fixed or you know what is
[22:04] going to come to pass or who are going
[22:05] to unfold
[22:07] what do you do
[22:10] what
[22:11] unfolds
[22:14] out of something that is established
[22:17] and this is where
[22:19] i want to bring your attention like
[22:21] almost like a microscope to zoom in
[22:24] and to look again that this man joseph
[22:27] he came out of prison street interferes
[22:30] presence
[22:32] interpreted a dream and was placed
[22:35] into a position of power
[22:37] including the ring from pharaoh and
[22:40] including
[22:41] the chariot second in command in the
[22:43] land of egypt
[22:45] but i want you to notice something
[22:48] that
[22:49] when the dream was made known
[22:53] or god's counsel or god's mind was made
[22:56] known
[22:57] then
[22:58] the wisdom of god
[23:01] that came upon joseph
[23:03] brought
[23:05] not just
[23:06] the knowledge was an understanding
[23:10] a clean understanding of what is to take
[23:13] place
[23:14] not only that
[23:15] but how to prepare for it
[23:18] because the vision was clean
[23:20] seven years of plenty
[23:22] followed by seven years of famine
[23:25] in the seven years of plenty
[23:27] you prepare
[23:29] for seven years of
[23:30] famine and then joseph
[23:33] begin to give
[23:35] direct word of advice to pharaoh as to
[23:37] how to approach it
[23:40] so
[23:41] what i want to get tonight as a platform
[23:45] is that
[23:46] even with visions
[23:48] revelations dreams
[23:51] inspiration
[23:53] that brings
[23:55] a overview
[23:57] a picture
[23:58] a picture that is painted of what is to
[24:00] be
[24:02] but from where we are to get to there
[24:06] there is process
[24:08] there is planning
[24:09] there is knowledge
[24:11] there is an unfolding of what is to be
[24:14] done
[24:15] and you know
[24:16] the thing about family life
[24:18] and marriage and all these
[24:21] i wouldn't say some institutions but all
[24:23] these institutions there is no school
[24:26] of learning of life
[24:29] then the the school teach biology and
[24:32] chemistry and physics and mathematics
[24:33] and english and social science and all
[24:35] these
[24:36] helping and intellectual stuff
[24:38] but in terms of marriage
[24:41] it's blank in terms of life
[24:44] in terms of well-being in terms of how
[24:46] to operate and conduct yourself and so
[24:48] on there's no school of that
[24:50] and to this end
[24:52] we could look to the word to help us
[24:55] address some of that
[24:56] and if we take it as an open canvas
[24:59] then it's not a matter of
[25:01] like they're trying to preach preach
[25:03] this or or teach teach this
[25:06] but it's the share share
[25:08] this course of life and solomon was
[25:11] endured wisdom
[25:12] to share a lot of things that we're
[25:13] going to look at tonight
[25:15] and help us a long life journey that
[25:17] give us tools and give us tips
[25:19] of of this abundant life
[25:22] over the years i have encountered my
[25:25] wife and i we have encountered what i
[25:27] will call
[25:28] religious people
[25:31] not
[25:32] spiritual people
[25:34] we have encountered many religious
[25:36] people
[25:37] who appear to be spiritual
[25:40] but the reality is that they are just
[25:42] religious
[25:43] now what do i mean by that
[25:45] what do i mean
[25:46] is that religious people they really
[25:49] enjoy the atmosphere
[25:51] the environment of church the
[25:53] environment of other people and so on
[25:56] but what they're short of is really
[25:59] subjecting themselves
[26:01] to god's plan
[26:03] god's program
[26:04] god's knowledge
[26:06] god's mind
[26:08] and when you live
[26:10] like that
[26:11] you are not really allowing him to be
[26:13] your lord
[26:14] because for jesus to be your lord you
[26:16] must allow him to be your ruler
[26:19] and he must be able to go in any one of
[26:21] your rooms
[26:22] in your heart
[26:24] in other words you don't say lord
[26:27] why are bless me here with a car i want
[26:28] to bless me here but i don't want to
[26:30] deal with
[26:31] where i go and who i i i i go out with i
[26:34] don't want you to deal with my private
[26:36] life i don't want you to deal with my
[26:37] personal i don't want you to go inside
[26:39] of there i want you to just bless me in
[26:40] other words you want a circumferential
[26:43] uh blessing a circumferential god a
[26:46] circumferential religion where is what
[26:48] you want it's what you desire and you
[26:50] know how you see it and there is no
[26:53] calvary there's no cross there's no
[26:54] death
[26:55] that is religious and you can quote
[26:57] scripture quote text quote quote and god
[26:59] share this and watch you that but when
[27:01] come to
[27:02] the real
[27:03] core of the word which is truth
[27:07] you you're not connecting with it
[27:09] and
[27:10] i want you to see truth as

[29:01] okay despise not the chasing of the lord
[29:04] neither be wary of his correction you
[29:07] might have people
[29:09] that don't like nobody to talk to them
[29:11] tell them anything
[29:12] when i say talk to them i'm talking
[29:14] about to correct them
[29:16] you could preach to them
[29:18] laugh with them sing with them
[29:21] but when it comes to correction it's
[29:23] like
[29:24] you know what i'm talking about the cat
[29:25] when you pack when you pack the back of
[29:27] the cart this way one way they can't
[29:29] give me around me out when you're doing
[29:32] the other way
[29:34] once
[29:35] you go down the road a correction
[29:37] is a it's a frog face
[29:40] a bad attitude is a bad way
[29:42] and here it is you see and the thing of
[29:45] it is
[29:47] and you know it's something that i keep
[29:49] sharing with you that when israel came
[29:52] out of egypt they did not know god
[29:54] all they had was a promise a promise of
[29:56] deliverer being handed down from
[29:58] grandfather to grandchild grandfather
[29:59] grandchild father to son and for 400
[30:02] years was being channeled as a promise
[30:05] deliver a common deliverable coming i
[30:06] mean men expecting it this year and then
[30:09] this year after 10 30 years men drop
[30:11] down and die
[30:12] and he was always coming and this was
[30:14] handed on from generation to generation
[30:16] when moses came it wasn't a question of
[30:19] just bringing him out he was bringing
[30:21] them out to the mountain of god that
[30:23] they could get a knowledge of god
[30:26] they could get an understanding of god
[30:29] they could get to know this god
[30:31] and i want you to understand that when
[30:33] god called us a sinner
[30:35] from save us
[30:36] he wanted to bring us
[30:39] into acknowledge his knowledge and
[30:42] understand of him not church
[30:44] what people fall is at the stop at
[30:47] church that is where they were ministers
[30:49] and pastors and bishops and message
[30:51] popes lock people down after the church
[30:53] level and the people feel when they
[30:54] reach church they reach god
[30:56] but but we're talking about not going
[30:58] beyond church this is beyond the church
[31:00] pew and beyond these specials and
[31:02] singing and so on and he preaching this
[31:04] is you
[31:05] and your life
[31:07] and your family
[31:08] and because
[31:11] you know before there was church there
[31:12] was that family
[31:15] that thing
[31:16] that was instituted by god
[31:19] and even for before the exodus the bible
[31:23] talk about take a lamb for a house
[31:26] and if the house is too small join up
[31:28] with somebody else
[31:29] so god is concerned about you
[31:33] god is concerned about the family
[31:36] god is concerned
[31:38] and
[31:38] is is not the concept of of of ordinary
[31:41] families and families out there we
[31:43] talking about we're talking about god's
[31:45] mind and god's concept of family
[31:49] like colgate imam and to thee all the
[31:52] family of the earth shall be blessed and
[31:54] blessed and i will bless tea and then
[31:55] multiply not multiplied by feed and so
[31:58] on so so so it's not as if god doesn't
[32:01] know or god doesn't be concerned about
[32:04] or god is not interested in
[32:06] he himself instituted this thing called
[32:09] family
[32:10] man
[32:11] and his wife
[32:12] man wife children
[32:15] man white children not a house a house
[32:17] is a building there are people living
[32:19] one on a dead face in one direction one
[32:22] face and east one facing west and it's a
[32:24] house it's not a home
[32:26] the cherry in this way and everything
[32:28] out of order
[32:29] and it's it's a building it's walls that
[32:32] people communicate in and talk with
[32:34] but it's not really a home
[32:36] do you have a house
[32:38] or do you have a home
[32:40] a home is where you feel comfort is
[32:43] where you feel rested is where you feel
[32:45] you belong
[32:46] that is what god did for his family
[32:49] before his family come at the scene he
[32:50] made a place called
[32:52] eden
[32:53] and in there he made a garden and in
[32:56] deer he praised
[32:57] adam
[33:00] he actually prepared a place
[33:02] where it will be their home
[33:05] and if you notice what we talk about
[33:07] that we are going back to eden
[33:09] and i'm not talking about eden as a
[33:11] physical place but even as a as a place
[33:14] in the spirit as a place of god as a
[33:16] place you know not
[33:18] not not not like you're going to france
[33:20] or germany or america or anything like
[33:22] that
[33:22] but getting back to the place
[33:24] that we belong
[33:26] now notice
[33:28] that
[33:29] the very beginning
[33:31] the very in genesis
[33:34] what the devil attacked
[33:37] was the family
[33:39] because adam and eve was one
[33:41] they were one god made them dust
[33:44] adam had a revelation that eve came out
[33:46] of him
[33:48] eve was a byproduct
[33:50] adam was original
[33:53] god did not tell eve the word
[33:56] god told adam the word so adam had the
[33:58] word
[33:59] and adam shared it with eve
[34:01] that is why eve could relate to this
[34:03] serpent and tell his husband this is
[34:05] what god said
[34:07] because he didn't know
[34:09] what was the messaging
[34:11] that was given out in the garden he
[34:13] didn't know adam didn't talk to this
[34:14] with him
[34:16] god didn't talk to disciple
[34:18] so the first thing he had was to do
[34:20] was to find out
[34:22] what
[34:23] is
[34:24] the message
[34:25] and the purpose was to push it
[34:28] and he made a switch
[34:29] he made a switch to say you know what
[34:32] god knows that if you break this thing
[34:34] here you'll be right that's why
[34:37] there's only reason why you know
[34:39] you could either have all the trees but
[34:40] that tree
[34:42] you know
[34:42] you should you just think about this you
[34:44] know because that is there's some reason
[34:47] he is holding back that
[34:49] she bought into his offer
[34:52] and man fell
[34:54] when that
[34:55] man fell
[34:57] right there
[34:59] no rom no whiskey no bar no no no man
[35:02] fell the family was broken
[35:06] that is right there in the beginning
[35:09] and right now we have broken homes
[35:10] broken families about relationships and
[35:12] everything else and the reasons for that
[35:14] is because of sin but i'm going to show
[35:16] you more than that there are issues
[35:19] that we have to deal with you know i i
[35:22] know i'm kind of jumping here jumping
[35:23] here but we're using this as our
[35:24] broadcast tonight as to where we could
[35:26] go and what we could share
[35:29] but
[35:30] you hear me say already i don't believe
[35:32] man and wife is 50 50.
[35:34] i i don't believe that
[35:36] man looking for wife to to to complete
[35:39] his life like if he is half or she oh
[35:41] he's 75 and she's
[35:42] 25. i believe two whole people is who's
[35:46] supposed to get married
[35:48] whole people i remember a brother one
[35:50] time years ago tell me about his
[35:52] girlfriend he had and he had to be
[35:53] careful how would he go to eat because
[35:56] she she she she picked you lovely food
[35:58] and and and i set up issues and things
[36:01] like that i said brother i see you
[36:03] walking around with that with a bit of
[36:04] suitcase
[36:06] because you had to watch this and watch
[36:07] it i said gently rest on that suitcase
[36:10] and keep walking brother i said you're
[36:11] not qualified to do better
[36:13] you have to keep all this some people
[36:15] that are picky buddha
[36:17] i said brother god equally to be a
[36:19] psychologist a psychiatrist that is not
[36:21] what you see her problems
[36:24] and it's your problems yeah they get
[36:26] sorted out because that will just mess
[36:28] you up
[36:30] and this is the problem
[36:32] we have problems
[36:34] and we have to get sorted out in our own
[36:36] hearts
[36:37] in our own minds in our own lives
[36:40] i remember when i got a certificate to
[36:42] get married i mean i remember telling
[36:44] the words that i didn't even know the
[36:46] politics was still later on say ma i say
[36:48] angry i marry you because i love you
[36:52] and i accept you as you are
[36:56] i love my wife
[36:58] i still am in love with my wife
[37:00] let's tell her i'll marry her again she
[37:02] doesn't appreciate that
[37:05] and it's true if i don't marry again
[37:07] simple samaritan
[37:09] okay
[37:10] but you know what
[37:12] love doesn't wash the words
[37:16] and love cannot pay the bills
[37:19] love can't clean the house
[37:22] you have to clean it i have to do it
[37:24] somebody has to do it
[37:26] so then you realize
[37:28] that this thing called marriage
[37:30] and this thing's called a relationship
[37:32] is a little more than the feeling of
[37:36] love
[37:37] it is a little more i should i should i
[37:40] see i shouldn't say a little more it is
[37:42] much more than that
[37:44] i remember ana marie was some time you
[37:46] get this years ago the early part of our
[37:48] minds we got in some fuss and i was
[37:50] upset
[37:51] really upset i was hungry i was upset
[37:54] and she's smiling to me you love me but
[37:56] yeah
[37:57] this statement itself was a shock to me
[37:59] i was blown out of the water because why
[38:01] would she do me that in other words it
[38:03] was better for me that if she was vex
[38:05] like me and she said you love me i said
[38:07] yes i love you
[38:08] i know i don't think that story
[38:10] but that was a junction for me
[38:13] by speaking it out
[38:15] without the feeling of it because i
[38:18] recognize
[38:20] that love
[38:21] is a commitment
[38:23] not a feeling and i recognize i will
[38:25] still love her even though i was upset
[38:27] and i was angry
[38:29] and
[38:32] not playing god and you know my mind
[38:33] just flash on how god could be so upset
[38:35] with us but he still loves us
[38:42] he could be upset with us he could be
[38:43] angry with us but he still loves us
[38:45] because he know
[38:46] we're gonna come true
[38:48] we're gonna come true
[38:49] so
[38:50] um
[38:51] so i don't build i believe
[38:53] as a family as a marriage it's two whole
[38:57] people supposed to get together
[38:59] hole in mind not some psychological
[39:01] problem and they need some kind of
[39:02] doctor to scrub your mind and whatnot
[39:04] nice problems
[39:05] you know you want to be made whole and
[39:08] you want to know how to approach these
[39:10] things so i'm not jumping here jumping
[39:12] here forgive me but we will share as we
[39:14] go along okay
[39:16] so
[39:17] we said for the lord
[39:19] my son despised not the chastening of
[39:21] the lord neither be weary of his
[39:23] correction for whom the lord loveth he
[39:25] corrected he must have fathered his son
[39:28] in whom he delighted
[39:29] happy is the man that finded wisdom
[39:32] and the man that get it understanding
[39:34] not
[39:35] not these words
[39:36] happy is the man that find that wisdom
[39:39] one and a man that gets understanding
[39:42] four
[39:43] the merchandise of it is better than the
[39:44] merchandise of silver
[39:46] and the gain thereof and find gold
[39:49] she
[39:50] is more precious than ruby and all
[39:52] things that god can't desire are not to
[39:54] be compared with her length of days in
[39:56] his hand he's talking wisdom
[39:58] understanding length of these is in her
[40:01] right hand in the left hand rich is an
[40:04] honor her ways
[40:06] are ways of pleasantness
[40:08] and all her parts have peace
[40:10] she's a tree of life to them that lay a
[40:12] hole upon her
[40:14] and happy is everyone
[40:16] that retained her
[40:18] this is the verse i want to get to verse
[40:21] 19.
[40:23] the lord
[40:25] by wisdom
[40:28] had founded the earth
[40:30] by understanding
[40:33] had he established the heavens
[40:36] by his knowledge
[40:39] the depths are broken up
[40:41] and the clouds drop down the dew
[40:45] three words i want to pull out of that
[40:47] wisdom
[40:50] understanding of knowledge
[40:53] let me read it again
[40:55] the lord by wisdom
[40:57] had founded the earth
[41:00] by understanding
[41:02] how to establish the heavens
[41:05] and by his knowledge
[41:07] the depths
[41:09] are broken up
[41:10] and the clouds
[41:12] drop down the jew
[41:14] but here what i want to do
[41:17] i want to reverse the order
[41:19] of how it is in school
[41:22] so i want to put knowledge first
[41:26] understanding second
[41:28] and wisdom to it
[41:31] because knowledge
[41:33] is information
[41:35] now if you have the knowledge but you do
[41:37] have the understanding or the
[41:38] comprehension
[41:40] you still can't go forward
[41:42] as to
[41:43] what to do
[41:45] so if you have to get it done
[41:48] or get the task accomplished
[41:51] you must have the knowledge
[41:53] you must have the understanding
[41:56] and then
[41:57] wisdom is applied knowledge
[42:01] wisdom is not knowledge
[42:04] wisdom is knowledge
[42:06] applied
[42:07] i call the prophet said hearing
[42:09] recognizing and acting upon the word of
[42:11] god
[42:12] oh like all the bible can have a
[42:14] for
[42:15] the vision
[42:17] make it plain
[42:18] that he that readeth it
[42:21] may run
[42:22] for example jesus
[42:24] he opened the word to them which was the
[42:27] knowledge
[42:28] and then he did what
[42:30] he opened the understanding
[42:33] because if the word is open and you
[42:35] don't have the understanding
[42:38] is that you know nothing
[42:40] so you have to have understanding
[42:43] that is why the vision
[42:45] has to be made clean
[42:48] it applies to business it applies to
[42:50] marriage it applies to your own life
[42:53] what is the vision
[42:55] and with the vision
[42:57] you have to apply
[42:59] knowledge
[43:00] and understanding
[43:02] what was the vision and joseph time
[43:05] seven years of plenty seven years of
[43:07] famine
[43:08] what do you apply them
[43:10] you have the knowledge
[43:11] then you have to apply you'll be
[43:13] understanding what do i do
[43:16] so i realize
[43:18] that you can't be really effective like
[43:21] oh but said you can't have faith if
[43:23] you're not sure
[43:25] of what you're doing
[43:27] so that is why the word after coming
[43:29] clarity
[43:31] that we could know exactly
[43:33] where we are at
[43:34] and where we are going that is why even
[43:36] though the disciples
[43:38] they were followers of jesus
[43:41] yet
[43:41] jesus
[43:43] post-resurrection ministry wrote clarity
[43:46] of the word
[43:47] and clarity of the purpose that they
[43:50] were reasoned for
[43:51] it brought clarity
[43:54] all of them had to hear it
[43:56] all of them had to hear it
[43:58] receive it and then go in the upper room
[44:00] to act on it
[44:02] because the word
[44:03] is now made plain
[44:05] and when the word is made plain to you
[44:08] then it's revealed to you what you must
[44:11] do
[44:12] understand this
[44:13] no one else can do it for you
[44:17] so stop looking at ministry and pastor
[44:20] and church and believers and this one
[44:22] and your brother and uncle and no
[44:23] that
[44:25] stop it
[44:27] understand
[44:28] that there are certain things only you
[44:30] can do nobody else
[44:33] the decisions
[44:34] are yours the choice
[44:37] is yours
[44:39] you know what i'm telling myself
[44:40] something
[44:42] what if it was the kind of religious
[44:45] cuckoo people could have now wrong in
[44:48] those days and hearing this vision of
[44:52] seven years of plenty and
[44:54] seven years of famine i wonder how they
[44:56] would present it to their people how
[44:57] would they share it
[44:59] uh i could imagine saw them say don't
[45:01] worry man god is god what is a good
[45:03] chord um some of them might ignore it
[45:05] and say i don't really know seven years
[45:07] of famine coming all this bountiful
[45:09] thing
[45:10] and you know people go in their own
[45:12] slant in their own way they lean on
[45:15] their own understanding not
[45:16] understanding this this mind of god you
[45:19] know he says thoughts is hard on our
[45:21] thoughts so we really can't present our
[45:24] thoughts we have to sort of embrace his
[45:26] thoughts his thoughts about his family
[45:29] his thoughts and and this is where i
[45:30] brought up this thing about and i had it
[45:32] in my nose here what love has to do with
[45:34] it
[45:35] the whole thing is cleaning whatever you
[45:37] do with that i love you i love you
[45:39] because
[45:40] if you like the cook
[45:41] i love you love that putting food in the
[45:43] butter or on a plate
[45:46] as something unless
[45:48] it is food prep and prepared and planned
[45:51] out and what not i mean love not cooking
[45:54] food
[45:55] somebody there could be food
[45:58] and this is where i think people don't
[45:59] cater for
[46:01] uh
[46:02] the
[46:04] how should i say it
[46:05] the the whole
[46:07] package
[46:08] that embraces this thing called family
[46:12] you know i remember years ago brother
[46:15] thought his wife was pregnant he was so
[46:17] in a such a state because he said he was
[46:19] you know what he pampers did he did he
[46:21] crying and
[46:23] he was cool and now i look back he's so
[46:25] funny he was just in such a typical he's
[46:27] not ready for next childhood who we
[46:31] you see
[46:32] so
[46:33] it's a package of god
[46:35] and if we can embrace and really enjoy
[46:38] how god's reflection of god in
[46:41] his people and how he wanted to express
[46:43] himself in this
[46:45] family and the earth and who we want to
[46:47] express himself through you you would
[46:49] see that god have a greater interest of
[46:51] expressing himself through you that you
[46:54] have an interest in making yourself
[46:55] available and if you see what we are
[46:58] sharing tonight you would want to make
[47:00] yourself available that the kingdom of
[47:02] god reflected on earth through you let's
[47:05] continue now all right praise the lord
[47:07] amen
[47:09] all right
[47:11] i want to read from saturn chronicles no
[47:13] this is not a bible study i'll just go
[47:15] into a line i'm still getting into where
[47:18] i want to i'll still head down that road
[47:20] this is second chronicles
[47:22] 1 seven to twelve in that night
[47:25] god appeared to son of man and said unto
[47:27] him ask what i shall give thee
[47:29] i find this is a very very interesting
[47:31] scripture
[47:33] and god knows what solomon need and yet
[47:36] he didn't just give him because he knew
[47:37] he needs it
[47:39] he wants to hear
[47:41] what solomon would ask for
[47:43] and solomon said unto god with it
[47:46] thou has shown great muslim to david my
[47:48] father
[47:49] and has made me to reign in his stead
[47:53] now
[47:54] o lord god
[47:56] let thy promise unto david my father be
[47:59] established
[48:01] for thou has made me king
[48:03] over a people
[48:05] like the dust of the earth and multitude
[48:08] give me now wisdom
[48:10] and knowledge
[48:12] that i may go out
[48:14] and come in before these people for who
[48:17] can judge this by people that is so
[48:19] great
[48:20] stop here a minute
[48:22] solomon end up
[48:24] to go out with a question who could
[48:26] judge our people that is so great
[48:28] you know there are some people don't
[48:29] like to ask questions
[48:32] because they don't want people to know
[48:36] they don't know
[48:39] they want to give the impression
[48:42] that they are knowledgeable
[48:44] and then something comes up
[48:46] instead of asking questions
[48:49] to get more knowledge
[48:51] or to get clarity or to get a greater
[48:54] understanding
[48:56] they kind of do like you know yeah yeah
[48:58] yeah yeah
[49:00] but they're clueless
[49:03] they don't know
[49:05] sometimes i don't know why they wouldn't
[49:07] ask questions
[49:09] and um
[49:11] maybe it's pride
[49:13] and sometimes you get us in church
[49:15] people do things
[49:17] without even asking a question
[49:20] there's a word for that
[49:22] that word is presuming
[49:24] as human authority assuming that you
[49:26] know assuming that it is okay to do this
[49:29] act this way
[49:31] and whatever it is
[49:32] i don't need to find out it's not really
[49:35] so
[49:36] and i think
[49:38] um you know you come like people calling
[49:39] about you i don't mean to bother you
[49:42] i saying that because people say that
[49:44] and i want you to stop that
[49:46] because that's not bothering that is
[49:48] what you're supposed to do if you don't
[49:49] know you find out you ask the elders
[49:51] that they cruiser you know the ministry
[49:53] and so on and find out and ask
[49:56] don't assume anything because i know you
[49:58] don't know i miss it again good that
[50:00] you'll get it
[50:02] i know
[50:03] you don't know
[50:06] and i know you don't know because i
[50:07] don't know
[50:10] i have to get from him
[50:12] so i know when you're praying you say
[50:15] hey toity when you're praying like you
[50:16] know it all you know that
[50:18] you know
[50:20] and let me just drop this in one time
[50:21] you know whatever statement um
[50:26] that's not true you know
[50:29] a young fool
[50:31] gets older he's an old folder
[50:34] you have people who
[50:35] the old but they're not wise at all
[50:38] so age
[50:40] is not
[50:42] has nothing to do with wisdom you know
[50:44] some old fools okay
[50:47] so
[50:48] wisdom
[50:50] because when joseph
[50:52] stand before pharaoh he was 30 not 60
[50:56] he was a 30 year old man
[50:59] wisdom has nothing to do with age
[51:02] so forget it
[51:04] you could be 17 and wise
[51:06] 14 and wise
[51:08] 20 unwise
[51:09] 30 unwise
[51:11] do you want
[51:13] to be wise
[51:15] because we go in there
[51:17] and i'm going to read the scripture to
[51:19] get wisdom it is the principal thing
[51:22] but to get to wisdom
[51:24] you have to pass through
[51:26] the street of knowledge and
[51:27] understanding
[51:28] and then you could go on to wisdom road
[51:31] okay
[51:32] so praise the lord trust tonight would
[51:35] be uh helpful to you so let's continue
[51:38] now
[51:39] so solomon asks god give me now wisdom
[51:41] and knowledge
[51:42] that i may go out and come in
[51:46] before this people for who can judge
[51:48] this thy people that is so great
[51:51] and water to set a solomon because this
[51:54] was in thine heart
[51:56] and thou has not arcs riches wealth or
[51:59] honor
[52:00] nor the life of thy enemies
[52:03] that's a good one
[52:04] some people when they hit that show and
[52:06] through aya yaya
[52:08] is vengeance
[52:10] they make a sock salt if they gotcha
[52:13] they make it you know they really grow
[52:16] he said god even noted that that he
[52:18] didn't even ask
[52:19] for the life of his enemies neither yet
[52:22] has thou asked for long life
[52:24] but has asked for wisdom
[52:26] and knowledge for thyself
[52:30] wisdom and knowledge for who
[52:33] for thyself
[52:35] that thou must judge my people over whom
[52:39] i have made the king
[52:41] and look at this pronouncement in verse
[52:42] 12
[52:43] wisdom and knowledge is granted unto
[52:46] thee oh give the lord a shout in the
[52:48] house
[52:49] wisdom just like that because he asked
[52:51] that is almost against an anointing just
[52:53] drop upon him
[52:55] and not enough wisdom and knowledge that
[52:57] is why you could write the book of
[52:58] proverbs that is why you could write all
[53:01] those books have you written solomon
[53:03] because wisdom and knowledge was granted
[53:05] unto him right there and there because
[53:07] your wisdom and knowledge is granted
[53:09] unto thee
[53:10] okay
[53:12] and i will give you riches and wealth
[53:15] and honor
[53:16] such as none of the kings have had that
[53:20] have been before thee
[53:21] neither shall there any after thee
[53:24] have the like
[53:26] okay
[53:27] oh my
[53:28] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[53:30] father i thank you
[53:33] now we come now to the scripture
[53:36] which is like
[53:38] around the boat
[53:40] okay
[53:41] proverbs 24 3 and 4.
[53:44] it says this here
[53:47] true wisdom
[53:49] is a house builded
[53:53] and by understanding
[53:55] it is established
[53:58] and by knowledge
[54:00] shall the chambers
[54:02] be filled
[54:04] with all precious
[54:06] and pleasant riches
[54:09] all blessed be the name of the lord
[54:12] this here
[54:14] is a cornerstone scripture
[54:16] about building a house
[54:19] home
[54:20] family
[54:22] whatever
[54:24] and the three words are right there
[54:27] true wisdom
[54:28] is a house builder
[54:30] by understanding
[54:32] it is established
[54:34] and by knowledge
[54:36] shall the chambers be filled with all
[54:38] precious
[54:39] and pleasant riches
[54:41] a wise man is surely a man of knowledge
[54:44] increasing strength
[54:46] for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy
[54:49] war
[54:50] and in multitude of counselors their
[54:52] safety wisdom is too high for a fool
[54:56] he opened it not his mouth in the gate
[54:59] he that devises to do evil shall be
[55:01] called a mischievous person
[55:03] the thought of foolishness is sin
[55:06] and the corner
[55:08] is an abomination to men
[55:10] if they'll faint in the day of adversity
[55:13] that strength is small but let me really
[55:15] amplify this verse 3
[55:18] and
[55:18] 4. true skillful and godly wisdom is a
[55:22] house
[55:24] and having practice here a life
[55:26] a home
[55:27] a family is built
[55:30] and by understanding
[55:33] it is established
[55:35] on song and good foundation
[55:38] and by knowledge
[55:41] and its chambers
[55:43] of every area
[55:44] be filled with precious
[55:47] as pleasant riches
[55:50] so a house
[55:52] is established
[55:54] by treating
[55:56] you know those three things tonight
[55:59] knowledge
[56:01] understanding
[56:03] and wisdom
[56:06] the bible talk about a foolish woman
[56:08] were plucked in a house with her own
[56:09] hands
[56:12] a woman that lacked knowledge
[56:15] a woman that lacks understanding
[56:18] a woman that lacks
[56:20] wisdom
[56:21] the bible speaks of how to dwell with
[56:23] your wife
[56:24] with knowledge
[56:26] and with wisdom why would the scriptures
[56:29] put that in there
[56:32] i thought
[56:34] oh i could say this to me i don't
[56:35] believe that what love have to do with
[56:36] this
[56:38] i love he he loves me
[56:40] here
[56:42] but you still need knowledge
[56:45] you still need
[56:46] understanding
[56:48] you still need wisdom
[56:50] you know when you talk to your spouse
[56:52] male or female and they say i hear you
[56:55] they're listening
[56:56] ain't let me hear that i don't know if
[56:57] anybody overseas will understand that
[56:59] yeah yeah right yeah
[57:01] there is a vision
[57:03] you know
[57:05] they pass through this air and fly
[57:06] spiritually
[57:08] what they're acknowledging your mouth
[57:10] speaks something
[57:12] they are not
[57:13] dealing with the fact
[57:15] that they have not received it and i
[57:17] have my own experience myself
[57:20] i remember
[57:22] when i stuck with the baby i think three
[57:23] or four just walking and stuff and my
[57:26] wife was get tired and whatnot and i had
[57:28] a tape i went to one play or any message
[57:31] for somebody and she asked me if i could
[57:32] take take him with me
[57:35] and i said no
[57:36] but i didn't
[57:39] she tell her what you know what i was
[57:41] gonna do as such you know when i i left
[57:43] like
[57:46] you're in glory's program and you're
[57:48] doing things for the law or anything
[57:49] like that so
[57:50] going with the tape and please be taped
[57:51] and whatnot before you get blessed
[57:53] listen to me message
[57:54] come home life on the stage he's crying
[57:56] and stuff
[57:58] and
[57:59] as far as i concern i i totally lost
[58:01] business
[58:04] come back you know things that are
[58:06] supposed to be so i want to understand
[58:08] what is happening here
[58:11] so i say angering i said um
[58:14] i began to talk with her so this is
[58:16] where now
[58:17] communication
[58:19] okay we haven't touched that that's a
[58:20] major major thing
[58:23] so this is where now i'm beginning to
[58:24] communicate with her
[58:27] i didn't approach it as this where she
[58:28] cried here and she oh yes i wasn't able
[58:30] to load it she had to
[58:32] find she's selfish
[58:33] no
[58:34] i'm communicating with them see anri
[58:37] i said
[58:38] i i went to to to to play this tape
[58:42] and what i did not share with you
[58:44] where i go had modern might be slippery
[58:46] and someone to get up there to play this
[58:48] team and i don't think it was might be
[58:50] wisely
[58:51] isaac true to dear
[58:54] i said if i cheered up with you would
[58:56] have made a difference she said yes
[58:59] now
[59:01] i was foolish
[59:03] not to communicate to her
[59:06] what i was dealing with
[59:09] if i had done so
[59:12] i saved that whole atmosphere saved that
[59:14] whole drama
[59:16] because it means that i would have been
[59:19] sharing the story
[59:21] and some of us men i don't think men
[59:23] know we do that because we fail
[59:27] and the minority house you know
[59:29] explanation
[59:31] might also have to repent him
[59:33] that is not how love
[59:36] is church
[59:37] you see that's how we are to love our
[59:38] wives not as a model of your father but
[59:41] as christ
[59:43] love the church and give himself forth
[59:46] so then that taught me
[59:48] to be
[59:50] how to
[59:52] communicate fully
[59:55] and i remember
[59:57] you know
[1:00:00] telling me things
[1:00:02] and i come from i hear you and you know
[1:00:04] i just going through my motion
[1:00:06] and then one day i said could you say
[1:00:08] that again
[1:00:10] you know what's happening there
[1:00:12] i begin to pay attention
[1:00:15] and sometimes
[1:00:16] and i can say this to you why is that
[1:00:18] husband you see if you're talking to
[1:00:19] your husband and he do you need phone so
[1:00:20] yeah yeah
[1:00:23] and you have to be phonics doing so he's
[1:00:24] not listening to you tell him put down
[1:00:26] that phone
[1:00:29] you want his undivided attention
[1:00:32] and when
[1:00:34] and when i began to listen i realized
[1:00:37] that fear of a self
[1:00:39] was not clearly communicated
[1:00:43] and sometimes
[1:00:45] women feel men are mind readers
[1:00:48] just sometimes
[1:00:50] and um i don't have the gift of written
[1:00:52] light
[1:00:54] unless your thoughts come to your mouth
[1:00:56] i don't know what you're thinking
[1:00:58] i do have that gift
[1:00:59] and sometimes
[1:01:02] men may feel women may feel men you know
[1:01:05] when vice versa
[1:01:06] but the thing i want to get to is this
[1:01:11] you are only talking
[1:01:15] talk and communication is not this
[1:01:17] ending
[1:01:19] when you talk that's your word
[1:01:24] when you communicate
[1:01:26] the person
[1:01:28] you are communicating to understands
[1:01:33] i think i'll say it again
[1:01:36] you could talk and you're talking is
[1:01:39] your words
[1:01:41] so when you are talking to your husband
[1:01:43] or you're talking to your child or
[1:01:45] cousin or sister or brother and you want
[1:01:48] to communicate to them ask god
[1:01:51] to give you the right words
[1:01:53] to give you how to say it to them
[1:01:56] that they will understand
[1:01:59] what you are saying
[1:02:01] because sometimes
[1:02:02] we are speaking
[1:02:04] but it has not been communicated
[1:02:07] and when it's being communicated because
[1:02:09] i see it i see clearly what you're
[1:02:10] saying
[1:02:13] so the burden is now shared
[1:02:16] the burden is understood
[1:02:18] because
[1:02:19] it has been communicated
[1:02:22] do you get what i'm sharing tonight
[1:02:24] will blessed be the name of the lord i
[1:02:26] hope that this helps someone here
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:02:37] so
[1:02:38] our lives
[1:02:40] are shaped by who raised us
[1:02:43] our parents
[1:02:45] we
[1:02:46] ourselves we are part of this thing
[1:02:49] called relationships that's what we are
[1:02:53] we we function we we this is what
[1:02:56] connects us to others and so on
[1:02:58] and in that deer
[1:03:00] sometimes relationships becomes
[1:03:03] difficult and challenging
[1:03:04] sometimes it's communication issues
[1:03:07] we are not sharing what we're supposed
[1:03:09] to share and we assume things and
[1:03:11] presumed things and it is not what we
[1:03:14] presume and assumed and because of that
[1:03:17] we react i remember
[1:03:19] i don't know why
[1:03:20] you gotta forgive me in doing this sleep
[1:03:22] and doing this session to be i have to
[1:03:24] talk from my own experience i'm not
[1:03:26] trying to talk about me perceive but i
[1:03:28] could only speak from my own experience
[1:03:30] and i remember the time when i turned it
[1:03:32] something
[1:03:33] and i i gave him some licks
[1:03:36] and my wife was very upset she was very
[1:03:38] upset and she called my side in the
[1:03:40] bedroom she said don't you ever pull up
[1:03:42] like that again with them you know don't
[1:03:43] do that like that
[1:03:45] and i felt bad um how i did it
[1:03:48] something something happened something
[1:03:50] broken and something like that
[1:03:51] and after that i never did that
[1:03:54] i always postpone
[1:03:57] let's say discipline i wish i would deal
[1:03:59] with that tomorrow
[1:04:00] so now when i said that i will be out of
[1:04:03] the emotions of the moment
[1:04:06] so i can manage it
[1:04:08] from a sober
[1:04:10] clean
[1:04:11] unemotional state put your hands out get
[1:04:14] put to lakshmi's hand instead of
[1:04:15] reacting in the emotions and many times
[1:04:18] we react in our emotions and
[1:04:20] and that is not right that is not how
[1:04:23] it's supposed to be i should say it is
[1:04:25] more okay i will say right and wrong but
[1:04:27] i feel this way
[1:04:30] you know paul see i'll show you a more
[1:04:31] excellent way
[1:04:33] the better way is to get out of that
[1:04:35] atmosphere wait till it cool off and
[1:04:37] everything else and then from a sober
[1:04:41] you know balanced position you could
[1:04:43] deal with issues and challenges this is
[1:04:45] how god wants it to be real to be
[1:04:48] original to be authentic
[1:04:50] you know to be a son you see
[1:04:53] not all songs are the same in
[1:04:55] disposition and spirit
[1:04:57] and from what we see from our own
[1:04:58] parents and parent
[1:05:00] we learn
[1:05:01] you know i never saw my father hit
[1:05:04] my mother i never saw my father mistreat
[1:05:07] my mother i
[1:05:09] i i had a great experience um you know
[1:05:12] with with the family arrangement that i
[1:05:14] was born into and grew up into it was a
[1:05:16] big family a family of 12
[1:05:18] and i'm the ninth of a family of 12.
[1:05:21] and it was quite
[1:05:23] i can't remember lovey-dovey for my
[1:05:25] father by time i come it's everybody in
[1:05:27] front
[1:05:28] you know and um
[1:05:29] you know you just have to run your run
[1:05:31] and do your do and press on
[1:05:33] but here we are all adults you know
[1:05:35] people some have gone on and different
[1:05:37] things but this is life and it comes to
[1:05:40] our tool and what we will do
[1:05:42] and many times you hear stories of
[1:05:43] people's behavior connected to something
[1:05:46] rainy past uncle aunt or the tree team
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:50] all this psychological trash that you
[1:05:52] don't want to get rid of you want it you
[1:05:54] want to hold on to it
[1:05:55] and some of you need to get rid of it
[1:05:57] you want to hold on and this is what i
[1:05:59] want to challenge you tonight and if if
[1:06:01] you get anything over this tonight i
[1:06:03] want to challenge you to be knowledge
[1:06:05] understanding and wisdom
[1:06:07] if you don't have knowledge get it
[1:06:09] if you don't have understanding ask god
[1:06:12] get it
[1:06:14] if you do have wisdom get it
[1:06:16] you want knowledge you want the
[1:06:18] information
[1:06:20] not misinformation
[1:06:23] like i see one of these senators in
[1:06:24] america they have a video on him now
[1:06:27] talking years ago of um
[1:06:29] he never teached it in school but he was
[1:06:31] he used to spread misinformation he used
[1:06:33] to tell them things that he knew not
[1:06:35] coming to send his opponents the wrong
[1:06:37] way so i guess if the teacher is going
[1:06:39] to teach on chicken he might tell them
[1:06:41] the
[1:06:42] teachers are going to bring an exam on
[1:06:43] frogs
[1:06:44] so when i'm studying frogs he's studying
[1:06:46] chicken you see so that they wouldn't
[1:06:48] study teaching supposed study
[1:06:50] and i say that as a backdrop of if ever
[1:06:53] there was a time of misinformation this
[1:06:55] information is now with facebook with
[1:06:57] the internet and everything else but
[1:06:59] here we have the word crystal clear
[1:07:01] there is no misinformation or
[1:07:03] disinformation this is the word
[1:07:06] this is god and i want you to see it
[1:07:09] by god's grace oh blessed be the name of
[1:07:11] the lord
[1:07:13] wow so therefore all this thing about
[1:07:16] relationship and marriage is not taught
[1:07:18] in school
[1:07:19] you see so now we are starting with
[1:07:21] husbands who don't know
[1:07:23] how to respond
[1:07:25] to the complaint of their
[1:07:26] wives and because they don't know
[1:07:30] or not taught how
[1:07:32] they remain silent
[1:07:35] and ignore
[1:07:37] the complaints
[1:07:39] or deal
[1:07:40] with the issues
[1:07:42] and the wife expecting a certain
[1:07:45] response and this is not dear
[1:07:47] i remember brother telling me his wife's
[1:07:48] not responding and this and that i said
[1:07:50] oh say i said what to do
[1:07:52] i said um share with us things
[1:07:55] this week don't expect any response
[1:07:59] just share things as seeds
[1:08:01] share things to her
[1:08:03] and by the end of the week he called me
[1:08:04] backstroke fighters he said he seems
[1:08:06] like a like a reap i say exactly
[1:08:09] i said you as a male as a soul
[1:08:12] she is a female is like a soil a
[1:08:13] prompter so i remember
[1:08:15] when my wife
[1:08:17] wrote over to get down in trouble saying
[1:08:19] all this
[1:08:20] but
[1:08:21] um with isaac nursing exactly and so on
[1:08:24] and i would she wanted to stop on a
[1:08:26] different thing and i would get articles
[1:08:28] and sort of read for and share with her
[1:08:30] the value of breastfeeding and different
[1:08:32] things and different things young or 21
[1:08:34] 22
[1:08:35] and
[1:08:36] afterwards it struck me but if i could
[1:08:38] share these things
[1:08:40] i could share these scriptures i could
[1:08:42] share the word and i would come and say
[1:08:44] angry
[1:08:45] listen to this here hear the scripture
[1:08:46] here
[1:08:47] here what this is
[1:08:49] just rebuild things and stop these
[1:08:51] things and when she would go down to
[1:08:53] sport spain or so wooden tongue she
[1:08:55] would go in a bookstore and read
[1:08:57] something and say you know what i read
[1:08:58] so and so and so
[1:09:00] up to now i'm talking about up to
[1:09:02] tonight we are still sharing things
[1:09:04] we still
[1:09:05] are sharing things she reads she has no
[1:09:09] time for television and movies and stuff
[1:09:11] she reads she listens something
[1:09:13] everything is to edify
[1:09:15] to build up to strengthen
[1:09:18] knowledge
[1:09:18] understanding because you are preparing
[1:09:21] yourself you want to have wisdom wisdom
[1:09:24] how
[1:09:25] to use
[1:09:26] this knowledge the secret is what the
[1:09:29] word is in the bride and she has one the
[1:09:31] mind of christ what is that god's wisdom
[1:09:33] to know
[1:09:35] what to do
[1:09:36] with the word
[1:09:38] so i hope tonight that you would get a
[1:09:40] grasp this is an overview this is more
[1:09:43] like i say we make it a broad canvas
[1:09:46] um we could go into other areas
[1:09:49] um tips and tools and things are
[1:09:52] splitting into marriage just pretend the
[1:09:53] finances that's presented whatever but
[1:09:55] tonight we we talk about life and
[1:09:57] godliness just sharing some stuff with
[1:09:59] you and hope that it is edifying to you
[1:10:02] these things i wouldn't preach these
[1:10:04] things i wouldn't say try to teach it
[1:10:06] but i'm trying to bring a picture to you
[1:10:07] that you would have a clear
[1:10:09] understanding that these three
[1:10:10] ingredients
[1:10:11] is needed in our marriage
[1:10:13] is needed in a relationship
[1:10:15] if the wife don't have knowledge
[1:10:17] problems if the husband don't have
[1:10:18] knowledge problems if the wife don't
[1:10:21] have understanding problems
[1:10:23] if the wife don't have the
[1:10:25] this problem if there's no wisdom there
[1:10:27] it is problems one of the hardest things
[1:10:28] for me as a pastor in dealing with
[1:10:30] marriage and counseling and so on is to
[1:10:33] see two people
[1:10:34] in a relationship in a marriage and none
[1:10:38] that help the other that is a nightmare
[1:10:41] a nightmare nobody want to give in
[1:10:44] everybody want to hold their position
[1:10:46] nobody want to say you know what i'm
[1:10:48] sorry
[1:10:49] you know and start from there
[1:10:52] everybody want to be the man or the
[1:10:54] woman and you know i mean
[1:10:56] present me and personally when they
[1:10:57] check it out no
[1:10:59] the person comes from a rebellious kind
[1:11:00] of atmosphere and they bring that same
[1:11:02] rebellion to their house
[1:11:04] and you know i
[1:11:06] what about them is correct
[1:11:07] thank god for selling that 20 or 20
[1:11:09] prophet
[1:11:10] he said that don't change you
[1:11:12] just only change the dwelling place
[1:11:13] whenever you are here you'll be across
[1:11:15] me and it's true
[1:11:17] you know people come from different
[1:11:18] backgrounds and so on come together
[1:11:20] and
[1:11:21] you know you expect it to work instantly
[1:11:23] you expect everything to do quite
[1:11:24] smoothly it's not like that
[1:11:26] and this is where
[1:11:28] a lot of things are caught and not
[1:11:29] taught
[1:11:31] so as we share our stories as we share
[1:11:33] our lives it makes such a huge
[1:11:35] difference in how we communicate
[1:11:37] how we love how we serve how we
[1:11:40] encourage how we care for others how we
[1:11:43] care for people i have never seen it any
[1:11:46] time that we help others that we don't
[1:11:49] get back help ourselves never
[1:11:52] every single time this is amir and i our
[1:11:55] experience when we help others we get
[1:11:58] help our own selves
[1:12:00] unless if you have never done that try
[1:12:01] it don't just look out for your own
[1:12:04] your own self no
[1:12:06] help somebody else encourage somebody
[1:12:08] okay all right
[1:12:11] time is running down and i have
[1:12:14] some stuff here okay first peter
[1:12:17] tree
[1:12:18] i want to read here likewise first one
[1:12:21] likewise he wise being subjection to
[1:12:23] your own husbands that if any obeying on
[1:12:25] the word
[1:12:26] they also may not without the word be
[1:12:29] won
[1:12:29] by the conversation of their wives not
[1:12:31] talk
[1:12:32] that's the life of the wife so therefore
[1:12:35] if a husband is not really in the faith
[1:12:38] you gotta be more spiritual to say well
[1:12:39] yeah body would heal listen to he and no
[1:12:42] no no no no you know as long as you're
[1:12:43] intelligence god and carrying away the
[1:12:45] foolishness what while they behold your
[1:12:48] chaste conversation or life covered with
[1:12:50] fear whose adorning let it not be the
[1:12:52] outward adornment of platinum here of
[1:12:54] wearing of gold and putting on power but
[1:12:56] let it be the hidden man of the heart
[1:12:59] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:13:01] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:13:03] which is the sight of god is the great
[1:13:05] price for after this manner in the old
[1:13:07] time the holy woman who trusted in god
[1:13:10] or dawned themselves being in subjection
[1:13:12] unto their own husbands
[1:13:14] even as cyril b abraham calling him lord
[1:13:16] whose daughter's here as long as you do
[1:13:19] well
[1:13:20] i'm not afraid
[1:13:22] with any amazement but this is the verse
[1:13:24] i want to get to all these other voices
[1:13:25] that apply yes so
[1:13:27] i'm not going there tonight there's
[1:13:29] other verses but this is what i want to
[1:13:30] get to
[1:13:31] likewise he husbands
[1:13:33] dwell
[1:13:34] with them
[1:13:36] according to knowledge
[1:13:39] knowledge of what
[1:13:41] i remember dealing with a couple of
[1:13:42] years ago
[1:13:44] and
[1:13:45] the wife was saying he will you want me
[1:13:48] to say forgive um you want me to say
[1:13:50] sorry
[1:13:51] and i don't want to say sorry and uh if
[1:13:53] i say sorry
[1:13:55] you go make him feel like if he's
[1:13:56] somebody and something like that
[1:13:59] so i asked a question
[1:14:01] i said have you ever studied
[1:14:03] about the male
[1:14:05] a man
[1:14:07] i said have you ever read a book about
[1:14:09] men
[1:14:10] she says no
[1:14:13] so begin to talk a little further i said
[1:14:15] you know
[1:14:16] god made man man woman woman and
[1:14:18] sometimes a woman want the man to think
[1:14:20] like a woman
[1:14:22] i said you know in her mind
[1:14:25] she believes he is supposed to think
[1:14:27] like her
[1:14:28] and sometimes the man think the wife's
[1:14:31] supposed to be like a man because he
[1:14:32] want her to think like him
[1:14:34] he's not accepting the fact that in
[1:14:36] female and designation and feminist and
[1:14:39] spirit she has her own way of processing
[1:14:41] things and thinking
[1:14:43] so when i'm gonna talk to her i
[1:14:44] recognize she was void
[1:14:46] of the knowledge of
[1:14:48] what makes
[1:14:49] this male tick
[1:14:52] i was very unfortunate because when i
[1:14:54] begin to share you know she tells me i
[1:14:56] should write a book
[1:14:59] actually write a book but to me
[1:15:01] that is information or knowledge she
[1:15:05] should have had
[1:15:07] and there are many ways without
[1:15:09] knowledge
[1:15:11] and they go back they go to the instinct
[1:15:13] and they just do what they'll do but
[1:15:15] they never take time off to know what
[1:15:17] makes this little thick
[1:15:19] you could beat the cockroach up and kill
[1:15:21] the cockpit you could beat the lizard up
[1:15:22] and kill the wizard and play champion
[1:15:25] but if you leave the man to do it he
[1:15:26] feel like a more champion so let him do
[1:15:28] certain things
[1:15:30] you know and and and and and let him
[1:15:32] feel that certain kind of a way but of
[1:15:34] course some people are you waiting for
[1:15:36] him a group for himself a year can you
[1:15:38] do it for yourself and he feel less than
[1:15:41] you know a lot of things that i'm not
[1:15:42] going there tonight tonight is not a
[1:15:43] night for that i just make enough point
[1:15:45] but the point about it is this we have
[1:15:48] to be able to operate with knowledge and
[1:15:51] if we don't have the knowledge we find
[1:15:53] ourselves operating short in
[1:15:56] understanding our wives understanding
[1:15:59] the children understanding what's
[1:16:00] happening in school because we don't
[1:16:02] have the knowledge
[1:16:03] so we say do that and you know an
[1:16:05] appearance says why you say because i
[1:16:07] say so
[1:16:09] you use imports because you say
[1:16:12] the child asks why because a child wants
[1:16:15] an understanding
[1:16:17] because you're presenting things that
[1:16:19] they don't understand
[1:16:20] and you're making pronouncement to them
[1:16:22] and their lives and the environment and
[1:16:24] you're trying to get understanding and
[1:16:25] instead and because you don't know how
[1:16:28] to explain it or share it or give it you
[1:16:30] say because i say so
[1:16:33] they try to say okay
[1:16:34] and in the child mind you said he only
[1:16:36] owned
[1:16:37] because you know what i mean they reject
[1:16:38] that they don't understand that they're
[1:16:40] trying to comprehend where they're
[1:16:41] coming from but if you ever say you know
[1:16:44] why son here's the reason why okay
[1:16:47] because such and such and such and such
[1:16:49] and you can try to say daddy i know
[1:16:51] understand
[1:16:53] and that is how you bring that kind of
[1:16:54] understanding let me see how i could
[1:16:56] wrap up here
[1:16:57] oh praise the lord blessed be the name
[1:16:59] of the lord okay
[1:17:01] so likewise you husband
[1:17:03] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:17:06] in the amplified speak about in like
[1:17:09] money you married women be submissive to
[1:17:11] your own husbands subordinate yourselves
[1:17:13] as being secondary to and dependent on
[1:17:15] them and adapt yourselves to them
[1:17:19] so that even if they do not obey the
[1:17:21] word of god they may be won over by not
[1:17:25] by discussion
[1:17:26] but by
[1:17:28] godly lies of their movies
[1:17:30] and when they observe the pure and
[1:17:32] modest way in which you conduct yourself
[1:17:34] together with your reverence for your
[1:17:36] husband you are to feel for him
[1:17:40] all that reverence includes to respect
[1:17:43] refer to
[1:17:44] revere him to honor esteem appreciate
[1:17:48] prize
[1:17:49] and in human sense to adore him that is
[1:17:52] to admire praise be devoted to deeply
[1:17:55] love and enjoy your husband let not
[1:17:59] yours be merely an external adorning uh
[1:18:02] with elaborate interweaving and nothing
[1:18:04] of the year there were enough jewelry or
[1:18:06] change of clothes but let it be the
[1:18:08] inward adorning and beauty of the hidden
[1:18:11] prison of the heart with the
[1:18:12] incorruptible and unfeeding charm of a
[1:18:15] gentle and peaceful spirit which is not
[1:18:18] anxious or wrought up but is very
[1:18:20] precious in the sight of god for it was
[1:18:24] thus that the pious woman of all who
[1:18:26] hoped in god were accustomed to beautify
[1:18:29] themselves and was submissive to their
[1:18:31] husbands adapting themselves to them as
[1:18:34] themselves secondary and dependent upon
[1:18:36] them it was thus that sarah obeyed
[1:18:38] abraham
[1:18:39] following his guidance and acknowledging
[1:18:41] his head shape over her by calling him
[1:18:43] lord master leader authority and you are
[1:18:46] now her two doctors if you do right and
[1:18:49] let nothing terrify you not given with
[1:18:51] hysterical fears or letting anxieties
[1:18:54] annuive you in the same way you married
[1:18:56] men should live considerately with your
[1:18:59] wives with an intelligent recognition or
[1:19:02] marriage relation honoring the woman as
[1:19:05] physically the weaker but realizing that
[1:19:08] you are joint ears of the grace of god
[1:19:12] god's unmerited faith and life
[1:19:14] finally all of you should be of one of
[1:19:17] the same mind okay no sorry on puerto
[1:19:20] meridian fever in order that your
[1:19:22] prayers may not be hindered and cut off
[1:19:27] so therefore husbands
[1:19:30] imagine god put the treatment of your
[1:19:33] wife
[1:19:34] in connection with your prayer life
[1:19:38] and if you don't do it right or get it
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:42] your prayer would actually be hindered
[1:19:45] and if anything satan won is your prayer
[1:19:48] to be hindered because the prayer
[1:19:51] is what give
[1:19:54] god the opportunity to work
[1:19:56] and to do on your behalf
[1:19:59] that is why it's very interesting what
[1:20:00] god asked solomon ask me what you want
[1:20:03] me to give you
[1:20:05] and solomon asks the right thing
[1:20:08] god can't just give things
[1:20:10] he wants you to ask
[1:20:12] this is what this is about
[1:20:14] when you hear the word
[1:20:16] what do you ask god when you hear truth
[1:20:19] what do you ask god what do you tell god
[1:20:22] let's head to home stretch here
[1:20:24] are we going to wrap up
[1:20:27] finally
[1:20:28] all of you should be of one of the same
[1:20:30] mind united in spirit
[1:20:32] sympathizing with one another
[1:20:34] loving each other's brethren of one
[1:20:36] household
[1:20:37] compassionate and courteous and
[1:20:39] tenderhearted and humble
[1:20:41] never return evil for evil insults for
[1:20:44] insult scolding tongue lashing be
[1:20:46] written but on the contrary
