[music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] The prophet said that one day we'll be standing talking and love will just come into the building and all that's wrong will be taken out. Just think about it. A day we just worship cuz that's what this is all about. Come back into fellowship with Jehovah. Coming back in fellowship with God. Hallelujah. A love that passes knowledge. A love that passes on all understanding. So it's not knowledge then. It's not information then. All what you know have in your intellect. But the love of God beating on your soul. &gt;&gt; It will take love to enter there. &gt;&gt; That's a higher level. That's beyond words. That's the power of love. The power of forgiveness. the power of reconciliation. That's what God [music] promised in us last night. There'll be one more ride. There'll be one more expression of God love to the earth. That's why the revelation 22:7, the spirit and the [music] bride say come. Come because there's the door is still open. Come because we has been made. Come because there's blood available for you and your family. Come because you don't know his height and the width and the depth of his love. And the spirit in the bride say come. One of these days it wouldn't be man speaking. It would be God speaking. It would be the spirit speaking expressly because you become the word and the spirit come upon you to express and manifest the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Time here is so fleeting. The did a funeral service. I was telling them that a thousand years is as one day. How do you think 70 years look like in God's eyes? I think about that. If a thousand years is as one day, 70 years like a That's how you [music] come and go. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Oh, 70 years that old." And to God's mind, sh that's that's how we going out of here. Born and exit. 70 years gone. Seconds, that's out. &gt;&gt; And every day somebody is gone. Somebody born and every day so many are sealed into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; The brother say one day the last drop in the bucket. This is the part now where you have to be concerned about [music] you getting part of that. What's in that pocket? &gt;&gt; You want that. &gt;&gt; You don't want church. You want God. &gt;&gt; You don't want church, you want a reality. &gt;&gt; You want the kingdom of God. Here we have a fellowship one way [music] or another. But the kingdom is by one spirit. You are baptized into that body. We have no hold in place for you. We have no refuge place for you. But God has that. &gt;&gt; That's his kingdom. And the kingdom is not in meat and drink. It's is in the word and power. It's a spiritual kingdom. Takes you off the natural. [music] Takes you out your humanistic realm. Take the take you out the realm of your family. All your family circle and what your family feel and what your family think and and how you move and you take you out of all of that &gt;&gt; into a realm where you see what God wants done because Jesus was completely out of family. You know who is my mother? Who's my father? Them that do the will of God. They are my mother, my brother. You see what I'm talking about now? Who is your mother? Who is your father? Who your mother? Who is your father? You'll give her new family, give her new friends. Oh, blessed [music] be. What a time. I have a greetings here, a testimony. Greetings, saints. I'd like to give uh the Lord Jesus a high note of praise for divine intervention and protection on our way from church on New Year's morning. We turned on the highway to Santa Rosa to take Sister Carmen home. Then a vehicle broke the red light, speeding up the highway. And I know it was the angel of the Lord that stopped brother Sabu. I shudder to think what could have happened as my entire family was there with me. If the angel of the Lord was not if the angel of the Lord was not on duty but mercy said no. May God continue to bless and protect us this new year. Sister Sabu. Oh, praise the Lord. So when the Sab was telling me about it, when he got the green to go go and he and he was going to go, he saw that car and something tell him stop. &gt;&gt; When my children got a license, I I used to teach them and tell them I said you're not driving for them, you know, don't get um dead in the right your right way and and they get killed &gt;&gt; because you had the right way. You don't want that. When I see the light, I don't go. Red means stop and watch. &gt;&gt; Then you go. &gt;&gt; You're watching green and you're going &gt;&gt; some demon coming on that side there. &gt;&gt; Take you out, you know. &gt;&gt; Said not yet, Satan. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be wise on this earth. You can't walk stupid. You can't walk foolish. You have to walk with wisdom. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, brother Andrew. Brother Andrew Luin is here with his wife. God bless you, Pastor Luan. and his wife. God bless you. He and his wife visit us this morning. Be glad to have them. Praise God. And last year was an amazing year for us, this church. And we want to see what the Lord will do this coming year. We had services that we didn't think we would have. We had amazing services, amazing time, and and God sent his tremendous blessing. And we certainly appreciate all of you here and those who connect to us live internet both locally and overseas. We say God bless you all. And we have a big salute for all of them. Praise God. We are greatly encouraged by all the different testimonies. I heard some uh a couple from Australia actually connect to us and and and listen to our services and so on. So it's quite interesting. I know years ago I share with a precious brother of mine that long before we had all this internet connect connection. I was telling them I was seeing a church without walls in the future. A church where there's no wall barrier. And I'm seeing that even more possible now where God is not uh confined by a building, by a man, by a church, by whatever. God does what he wants to do. And he want to do something special for you this morning. So could we stand? We want to go to the word. Joshua chapter 14. Want to read verse 6 and 7. We just have to it. Matthew chapter 12 [snorts] uh 33-37. John chapter 1 1-5 and 11-13. I read this out like that in case you want to write it down. Joshua chapter 14 reading it from verse 6. Then the children of Judah &gt;&gt; came unto Joshua and Gigel and Caleb the son of Jeff the Kesanite said unto him, "Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses, the man of God concerning me, and indeed in Kenish Bania, 40 years old was I when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kenesh Bania to espire the land. and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that bent up with me made the heart of the people to melt, but I wholly follow the Lord. Matthew chapter 12, Jesus speaks from verse 33. Either make the tree good and his food good, or else make the tree corrupt and his food corrupt. For the tree is known by his fruit. Oh ye generation of vipers, how can you being evil speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things. And an evil man &gt;&gt; out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, &gt;&gt; and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. St. John 1 1:5 and then we go on to 11-13. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the [snorts] life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Let's go down to verse 11. He came unto his own, his own receive him not. But as many as receive him, to them give he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word this morning, and I pray to inspire our hearts and change and transform our lives. May they see the weight of the word tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless you. May have your seat and just give him some praises while you sit down. Now you realize we will say give him a shout, give him a praise, sit down and praise because we are going against the grain. You know &gt;&gt; the grain is no praise. &gt;&gt; The grain is that no praise demon and that demon sitting up upon your top lip that you don't want to open God and give God praise. But the Bible say let everything that have breath give the Lord give the Lord praise and thanks. In the good times you praise him. In the bad times you praise him. Praise God. You praise him anyhow. You praise him anyway. They were in the upper room praising and blessing his name. The purpose they creating an atmosphere. In order to praise God, you're sitting on your flesh hearing words. But when you praise God, you create an atmosphere. That atmosphere is what comes around you. That atmosphere is what the prophet identify. The pillar of fire is over this woman here. Let the spirit the spirit moving inside of there. Praise God. He's identifying an atmosphere. In that atmosphere, you get you get you get your healing. In that atmosphere, you get your breakthrough. In that atmosphere, you get the deliverance. Listen, you don't even have to be a believer to be healed. Praise God. The atmosphere of faith produces healing. A sinner could walk in here and be healed and walk out with your healing. Give the Lord a shout. Do you hear amen in the house? It don't have TO BE NO MESSAGE PERSON. WHAT MESSAGE YOU TALKING ABOUT? God message is the message of faith. Give the Lord a shout. He sent a PROPHET TO TURN YOUR HEARTS BACK TO the faith OF THE FATHERS. NOT FOR YOU TO sit in your stinking flesh. Don't get me started this morning. Already started. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [screaming] Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you not asking big enough. Asking big enough, &gt;&gt; asking too small. You see, in terms of determination, ambition, &gt;&gt; goals and so on, you can't set it too low &gt;&gt; because you wouldn't have the drive. &gt;&gt; You have to set it not too high that you can achieve it, &gt;&gt; but you have to have it somewhere above &gt;&gt; where you are that you could press. &gt;&gt; Paul can't press it be the goal right there. You're not pressing, you're walking into it. &gt;&gt; But the reason you say I press towards, it means it's a far off. It means it have some distance to cut to get there. &gt;&gt; It means you have some obstacles &gt;&gt; to get there, &gt;&gt; but you're going there. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I wasn't a fast learner, but praise God. Once I get something in my heart to go after, you can't stop me from that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, have to come in your heart. &gt;&gt; A lot of things are in people's heart. A a double-minded man is unstable in all &gt;&gt; all his ways. &gt;&gt; Not some, all because you're double-minded. &gt;&gt; Praise God. They may say, "My heart is fixed." Oh, God, my heart is fixed. &gt;&gt; You have to have purpose. You have to have a fixed heart to go after the goals of God. If God promised a revival, we fixed on that. He called it have name. He have a name for it. Not just revival. Have a seven thunder revival. He identified THE NAME OF IT. OKAY. GIVE THE Lord a shout. NOTICE ANY REVIVAL. WE NOT TALKING ABOUT REVIVAL. REVIVAL. ANYBODY COULD TALK THAT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRIGHT REVIVAL, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN THUNDERS. OH, give the Lord a shout in the house. No other church could preach THAT BUT THE BRIGHT CHURCH. BECAUSE THAT'S A EXCLUSIVE BRIGHT PROMISE. YOU could take vials, WARS, UKRAINE, AND RUSSIA WITH YOU, BUT YOU CAN'T TOUCH THEM THUNDERS. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THAT'S THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL. THAT'S GIVE THE BRIDE'S FAITH. THAT SHOW THE BRIDE HOW TO BE PURE. OH, give the LORD A SHOUT. WAIT TILL THEM SEVEN THUNDERS UTTER THE VOICES OF THAT GROUP. &gt;&gt; I can't move from that. You know [cheering] that's the word. I understand all that. You don't have to. You know when you go in the bank, I remember long time when they first come with this um card machine. This machine to put in your card ATM. People was wondering if it's a man behind you throwing on the money. Now we know we're just pushing but you don't know how it working. &gt;&gt; You know the mechanics of that. You're pushing a card. You're punching a number and you press and money come out here. Put in your pocket. &gt;&gt; Who behind who the teller behind that? That comes sister when the first uh search in Google she asked if Google is a man or woman. &gt;&gt; Who who doing that behind that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that is where we are at. &gt;&gt; You don't have to know the mechanics, &gt;&gt; but you have to know the dynamics of it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to know all THE PARTS INSIDE THE CAR, BUT when you turn the knot, &gt;&gt; let that car start, you know, &gt;&gt; because you ain't going nowhere. &gt;&gt; And this is the thing &gt;&gt; Jesus told him, you shall receive power &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you. &gt;&gt; Not when Peter talk to you, &gt;&gt; not when James expresses mysteries to you, but after the Holy Ghost. And those men were not responsible for the Holy Ghost. HOLY GHOST WAS A PROMISE OF THE FATHER. GOD IS THE ONE with responsible. They couldn't have it when they want it. They had to get it when he release it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Tar, until." &gt;&gt; That's all they know. Until. What you going to do when he say until? Are you going to get frustrated when he say until? Are you GOING TO GET FED UP AND YOU CAN'T CARE NO MORE AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE? OR YOU GOING TO HOLD ON THERE AND HANG IN THERE? This is power to overcome. This is power to pray. This is power to forgive. This is power to make things right. THIS IS POWER, POWER, POWER, power coming upon you. All what you can't overcome. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. POWER COME TO YOU. GIVE overcoming power. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD FOR. YOU WALK BY FAITH, YOU TALK BY FAITH, BUT POWER COMING. OH, GIVE the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So have a title. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For by thy words. &gt;&gt; That's the title. &gt;&gt; Bible say for thy by by thy words thou shalt be justified. &gt;&gt; Or for by thy words shall be condemned. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? God want your words. &gt;&gt; Not your thoughts, &gt;&gt; not your mind, &gt;&gt; but he wants something to come out your mouth. &gt;&gt; What you will say. So Caleb said it this way. I brought word &gt;&gt; as it was in &gt;&gt; my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration as it was in my heart. &gt;&gt; Words. &gt;&gt; Words are powerful. &gt;&gt; Because words could cross through time and space. &gt;&gt; A man could put his words in text and you could read it. &gt;&gt; Yes. and you are translated into what he's expressing in text. &gt;&gt; You could actually break into another world with words. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible does. &gt;&gt; When you read the Bible, &gt;&gt; you get transported &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; By the words that you read, &gt;&gt; that's the power of words. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Words can create. Words can bring healing. &gt;&gt; Words can bring restoration. &gt;&gt; Words can heal. &gt;&gt; Words can destroy. &gt;&gt; Words can justify. &gt;&gt; And words can condemn. &gt;&gt; There are people and is known something that is factual with unforgiveness producing cancer and tumor and all kind of different things because they have ought in their system. And the os that they have in their heart get translated into whatever crystals or whatever something in their body physically. &gt;&gt; It has been documented that people who forgive how their system changes &gt;&gt; and how healing is released &gt;&gt; because of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; So I am saying to you sometimes what you think happening in the natural is more than in the natural. &gt;&gt; So words are not just natural. And I could prove it to you because Jesus said my words &gt;&gt; are spirit &gt;&gt; and my words &gt;&gt; are life. &gt;&gt; So words have spirit in it. &gt;&gt; Positive or negative. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John 663 is a spirit that quick. The flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they life. But Abraham said this the other night I was dreaming. I went to have discernment and a great host of my friend had gathered thousands of them in a meeting. There was a fellow come up unto me. Billy usually comes and get me because you don't you don't talk to me. And this man just talked a blue streak and before I got over there all the anointing was gone from me. So his son Billy Paul used to come and escort him &gt;&gt; and Billy Paul never used to talk. &gt;&gt; Another man came and spoke a blue a blue streak. Whatever that is, whatever anointing that came out that man's mouth broke the anointing upon that prophet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Words have power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mark 7:20 says, he said, this is Jesus, that which come out of the man that defileth the man. &gt;&gt; For from within or out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, &gt;&gt; adulteries, fornications, m. He is showing that these things not outside. You know &gt;&gt; it coming from &gt;&gt; inside. So from the both evil thoughts, adulteries, fornication, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasiciousness, evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things he called pride evil. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen now. &gt;&gt; He still called pride evil. I didn't say &gt;&gt; watch. All these evil things come from within and defiled the man. And I was amazed just after this the Bible said and from thence he arose went to the board of Tai and Sidon entered into a house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid. So Jesus trying to be invisible for a certain woman. He just talk all what inside somebody's heart &gt;&gt; and listen to what happened here. Now, &gt;&gt; a certain woman, I like that, no name, just a certain woman, &gt;&gt; whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at [snorts] his feet. And the woman was a Greek, a sophician by nation. She besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. But Jesus said unto her, "Let the children first be filled, for it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it into the dogs." And she answered and said unto him, "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat the tan crumbs." He said unto her, "For this same, go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter." &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord I shout this morning. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what is happening there? He just say out of the heart. Come on. Kind of evil stuff. this woman come and say my daughter FUR THE DEVIL HELP ME SAVE me deliver me he said I'm not taking the children's bread and giving it to the DOG SHE SAID THE DOG TAKE crumbs the words CAME OUT HER MOUTH &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T CUSS HIM SHE DIDN'T GO ON FACEBOOK AND RIDICULE HIM SHE DIDN'T LIE ON HIM SHE DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE A WHOLE BANAL ABOUT HIM SHE SAID FOR HIM THE DOVES EAT CRUMBS AND JESUS DIDN'T HAVE TO LAY HANDS HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PRAY HE SAID COME OUT DEVIL COME OUT DEVIL HAD TO SHUT AND TALK IN TONG HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. HE SAY FOR &gt;&gt; THIS SAYING THAT MEAN YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING TODAY [cheering] &gt;&gt; that change the course of your life. &gt;&gt; The power of words, &gt;&gt; the power of speaking &gt;&gt; because God spoke in the beginning &gt;&gt; for what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because there was nothing else to make it with. So God spoke of the word. He said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; He said unto the her &gt;&gt; for this saying go thy way, the devil is gone from thy daughter. &gt;&gt; And when listen, &gt;&gt; hear the testimony. When she was come to her house, &gt;&gt; she found the devil going out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And her daughter laid upon the bed. that devil take an exit &gt;&gt; because a woman said something and she said something that that that influenced or affected the heavenly realms. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just words echoing on the earth. Something hit heaven. HEAVEN HIT THAT DEVIL OUT and the woman went hallelujah. JESUS CONFIRMING JESUS WAS CONFIRMING THIS THING ALREADY HAPPENING. Do you know what happening this morning? YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS MORNING. OH MY BROTHER [screaming] ANWINE. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU ARE GOING FREE. YOU ARE BEING DELIVERED. YES. YES. GOD GOD COULD FILL YOU THIS MORNING. GOD COULD BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. GOD COULD COMPLETELY HEAL AND DELIVER YOU RIGHT [screaming] NOW. [cheering] OH, &gt;&gt; give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could speak words and uplift your children &gt;&gt; and you could speak word and damage your children. &gt;&gt; Words can build &gt;&gt; and words can break. Proverbs 18:12 says, "Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's when you know somebody going to crash. &gt;&gt; You don't have to prophesy over them. You know, &gt;&gt; once they hit that pride train or that pride motorbike, just get on the high end. &gt;&gt; They're speeding. &gt;&gt; I never get that one. First time I get one B a motorbike of pride they going regular car you know taking a maxi you know they speeding on pride &gt;&gt; they going and crash the same scripture continues and before honor is humility &gt;&gt; so when you see somebody could humble themselves &gt;&gt; aha you know &gt;&gt; honor coming &gt;&gt; blessing coming &gt;&gt; hallelujah The power in the seed is the gene or the DNA of the seed. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let every seed bring forth after its kind." &gt;&gt; A corn seed, coffee lead &gt;&gt; to be avocado seed. &gt;&gt; The gene in the corn &gt;&gt; is what will produce corn. &gt;&gt; And the only way you know what's IN IT IS WHEN IT PLANTED and reveals itself. Or let's say it this way, the process &gt;&gt; unfolds what's in it. &gt;&gt; That's why things to reveal and unfold takes time. &gt;&gt; Because you can only know fruit by when it go through the process. &gt;&gt; Pumpkin seed and watermelon seed is very similar. If you don't know which is which, plant it. &gt;&gt; Both of them run on vine. &gt;&gt; But you have to wait for fruit time. &gt;&gt; Then you receive Mr. pumpkin and you're going to say Mr. Watermelon. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So the seed gan is what God put. So God put a gene in you. &gt;&gt; A seed in you. &gt;&gt; And that seed have a destiny. &gt;&gt; He said it this way. Who he for you, he called. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO HE CALL HE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; WHO HE JUSTIFIED HE HAD ALREADY GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT GOD PUT IN YOU HAVE A DESTINY. &gt;&gt; Pan couldn't keep it back. Man couldn't give it back. Family couldn't give it back. JOB COULDN'T GIVE IT BACK. RELIGION COULDN'T GIVE IT BACK. YOU HAD TO COME FORTH BECAUSE GOD PUT THAT inside of you. &gt;&gt; Okay. THE LORD I SHOUT IN the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when a SEED HAVE AN OBJECTIVE, HE SAID, "MY WORD SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO me for it, BUT IT SHALL ACCOMPLISH." SO THE SEED HAVE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. GOD HAVE A PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN'T MISS FOR NOTHING. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE GRAY, YOU'RE BALLING, OR YOU'RE HERE NOW TURNING BLACK. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE JUST BORN. THERE'S A PURPOSE BEHIND YOUR LIFE. THERE'S A PURPOSE BEHIND ALL WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH. THE DEVIL IS A LIAR THIS MORNING. DON'T LET THE DEVIL TELL YOU THAT SOMETHING IS IN VAIN. IT IS NOT IN VAIN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; for 2026. &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you &gt;&gt; to choose your words carefully. &gt;&gt; I remember ten commandments Moses tell Pharaoh, choose your words carefully. You know, &gt;&gt; you know Moses, you know what Phar say after that? Every firstborn shall die. &gt;&gt; He's the boss. &gt;&gt; He's the big man. &gt;&gt; Not even realizing he's talking about his own son. &gt;&gt; Because death and life &gt;&gt; is in the power &gt;&gt; of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Oh, could we get some praises tonight? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Choose your words carefully. &gt;&gt; The 10 spies, those 10 ministers &gt;&gt; in Moses message &gt;&gt; of the hour &gt;&gt; at that time when they came back hurriedly they asked the question, did the giant see you? No, they didn't see us. But we in our own eyes, these are their words now. &gt;&gt; This is what coming out of their mouth now. We in our own eyes was like grasshoppers. &gt;&gt; That is when you seeing Goliath as Goliath. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SEEING GOD AS BIGGER than your problems &gt;&gt; or bigger than WHAT IS CONFRONTING YOU. I KNOW THINGS ARE CONFRONTING YOU. IT HAS TO BE. &gt;&gt; If things are not confronting you, &gt;&gt; something wrong. Everybody have things confronting them. &gt;&gt; God set it up that way. &gt;&gt; You have your own golad. &gt;&gt; It's just that you PICK UP YOUR SLING yet because it take faith TO TAKE UP THE SLING. &gt;&gt; IT TAKE FEAR TO RUN TO GOLIATH. IT'S JUST YOU WATCHING. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BY FEAR. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BY YOUR PAST. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BY YOUR FAILURES. SOME OF YOU PARALYZED BECAUSE YOU NEVER GOT THE VICTORY BEFORE AND YOU THINK YOU WILL FAIL AGAIN. THAT'S A LIE. &gt;&gt; OKAY, THE LORD HAS SHOUTED OUT. &gt;&gt; AM I PREACHING TO SOMEBODY THIS MORNING? WHO AM I PREACHING TO THIS MORNING? [cheering] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; YOUR NEGATIVE PAST CAN'T help you &gt;&gt; with the challenges of your future. Amen. &gt;&gt; What could help you is what is positive in the past. Sometime ago, years ago, I preached about the anchor point. &gt;&gt; When the devil rock your boat and rock you off the moorings and what to get back to the anchor point &gt;&gt; where you first met the Lord where you first get a breakthrough, put a stick THERE AND START BACK from there. GET BACK AN ANCHOR POINT AND YOU COULD HOLD ON TO THAT. DEVIL PUSHING YOU, PUSHING YOU, PUSHING YOU, BUT THE ANCHOR POINT GIVE YOU A SPOT. YOU COULD STOP. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD STAND. YOU SAY, "HERE I STAND. HALLELUJAH. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Choose &gt;&gt; your words, &gt;&gt; carefully &gt;&gt; and you could speak words intentionally. &gt;&gt; Speak the right thing. &gt;&gt; David said it this way. The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; God didn't tell him that you know. &gt;&gt; God didn't say David say that. You know David express and make a declaration by Isaac. &gt;&gt; THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; shall not want. &gt;&gt; So the devil CAN'T COME AND TELL THEM YOU GO WANT YOU GO BEG BREAD. DAVID SAID I HAVE BEEN OH YOUNG [screaming] NO I'M OLD. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR seed beg bread. DO I HEAR A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A MAN THAT IS WALKING BY FAITH, TALKING BY FAITH, LIVING BY FAITH. HIS WHOLE LIFE IS AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH. NOT FEELINGS. FAITH, &gt;&gt; NOT EMOTIONS. FAITH. [cheering] GET OUT OF YOUR STINKING FLESH. GET OUT OF HUMANISTIC REALM. GET OUT OF EMOTIONS. AND LET'S TALK FAITH. LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; SEASON. Faith doesn't hide. &gt;&gt; Faith speaks. &gt;&gt; I believe, therefore, I speak. &gt;&gt; Faith speaks. &gt;&gt; So, if you're not speaking, something is wrong. &gt;&gt; You're short on faith. James 1:19, "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, &gt;&gt; slow to wrath." &gt;&gt; Why did the Bible say slow to speak? &gt;&gt; You get an opportunity to choose your words. &gt;&gt; It was put your mind in gear before you start your mouth. Let me say it again. Put your mind in the gear &gt;&gt; before you start your mouth &gt;&gt; so you know what direction you're going then &gt;&gt; pleasant words. Proverbs 16:24 as an honeycomb. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Sweet to the soul &gt;&gt; and held to the bones. I asked my wife this morning, I said, "Why it is that gossipers only just gossip negative news?" You ever see a gossiper bringing good news? &gt;&gt; Boy, I are so blessed. I want to tell everybody the sister get a breakthrough. Gossiper not talking that &gt;&gt; they close to the ground. &gt;&gt; They heading for the information &gt;&gt; to bring negative because of information nobody else have. So they feeling powerful and they have ears who willing to hear. You hear &gt;&gt; you a hear this? You you hear this? &gt;&gt; You hear this yet? &gt;&gt; You you you hear it yet? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. Let me tell you. I I I &gt;&gt; I have it. I I I I have it on have it on. But pleasant words are as a honeycomb. &gt;&gt; Sweet to the soul and health to the bones. You want to be blessed, but man say something nice about people. Say something good. Say something loyal. You're creating an atmosphere saying that. Praise God. You start to talk negative. There's a negative spirit come around you and then drop on top of that and whatn not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And people just pass things and when they pass people come and they talk the thing now then you get a backpack &gt;&gt; monkey on your back not even your business but you're packing it &gt;&gt; and when you're packing now said they get heavy you want to offload now &gt;&gt; so you see how that going &gt;&gt; somebody talk to you get a backpack &gt;&gt; and you going [laughter] but you want to carry this stuff but you know what she tell me and afterwards you you offload the backpack then a whole lot of people walk inside the backpacks I not carry nobody Put the backpack in. I have my own backpack to deal with. I don't want yours to carry. Mind your own business. Help somebody. Instead of talking them negative, see how you could pull them up. Life have enough struggles. People have enough battles. PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH FIGHT AND PROBLEMS FOR YOU TO BE A problem to them. DON'T BE A PROBLEM FOR ANYBODY INSIDE OF HERE. LIFT SOMEBODY UP. GET HELP SOMEBODY WITH THE BURDEN. ASK THEM WHAT THEY NEED. OPEN YOUR WALLET IF YOU HAVE TO. OPEN YOUR GROCERY BAG IF YOU HAVE TO SHARE. &gt;&gt; SPREAD THE LOVE. &gt;&gt; SPREAD THE JOY. &gt;&gt; PULL A HAND UP. I GOD PULL YOU UP. FORGIVE. DROP IT. LET IT GO. WALK PAST IT. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. [cheering] Speaking about Jesus, Luke 4:32 said, "And they were astonished at his doctrine." &gt;&gt; For his word was with power. &gt;&gt; So words could carry power with it. &gt;&gt; Just as word could carry just text. &gt;&gt; I call it verbal gymnastics. People just they don't want to say a table. They say four legs with a thing on top of it. &gt;&gt; Saying that make it deep. It's a table. with four legs &gt;&gt; making a riddle. &gt;&gt; And the people say the mystery of four legs and thing on top. &gt;&gt; There's a table. &gt;&gt; I call it what it is. &gt;&gt; Four legs. The mystery of the four legs. You see the four legs for horse riders. Type and all kind. It's a table. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 133. He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life. &gt;&gt; But he that openeth wide, his lip shall have destruction. &gt;&gt; I hear people say I have no lip in my mouth. &gt;&gt; A francointment. There's a word you hear of it. Talking um you um something um criticism. What you say again? Frank criticism. &gt;&gt; Constructive criticism. Liars. You know nothing constructive or that you know they want to hit your heart. I only give you constructive criticism. How come you never give me constructive boost, &gt;&gt; constructive encouragement? How come you don't never lift me up constructively? You come to beat me on top of my head and talk about constructive criticism. I don't need that now. I need somebody to help me take the groceries to the car. I need somebody to lift up. You see the bag I HAVE CARRYING HERE? HOLD THE OTHER END. Let me carry it with me. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Why you order that? You didn't do heavy. &gt;&gt; But you see it heavy. You should have wait till your brother come. &gt;&gt; But but you and I here know. &gt;&gt; You're not offering to help. You're not offering to lift. You're only criticizing and say I should wait. I should buy a smaller one. one from a wait. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 18:21, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof." &gt;&gt; You could speak things that change people's lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; James, my brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall all receive a greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all. If any man here we go offend not in word, &gt;&gt; the same is a perfect man. &gt;&gt; So a perfect man know to keep silent &gt;&gt; when to speak. &gt;&gt; He not troubling people with words. It's a perfect man. Some time ago I was telling you I was washing washing. You brothers who doesn't wash God could talk to you while washing. All them brothers laughing &gt;&gt; that don't mean your washing bees laughing you know &gt;&gt; washing be still washing and washing bees mind you is not not not additional thing you know why he's doing that every day you know &gt;&gt; so that's when they ignore you and they're congratulative washing wares you could understand why is is no bonus you're not getting a badge for that it's every day inside no badge for that no badge whatsoever don't even look for thanks thank you 20 years you washing you wash the woo you They say thanks and you expected about hallelujah glory kiss and a hug because you watch the war once and the blue moon come out once in a blue moon you no no no no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't don't don't while doing that he come to me not to ridicule and belittle anyone &gt;&gt; it's quite strange and I tell my wife I say something come to me considering belittling and ridicule When I get along in the word now, that is where I bounce up the woman caught in the act of adultery and they caught in the very act and they thought they had her. They have the scriptures, they have the quote, they press play, they they read it, they listen to it and they ready for action. Now all them come with the big stone and Jesus they challenge him because the issue is are you following Moses? Are you following what on the tape? &gt;&gt; That that was the issue there. We press play and we say big stone &gt;&gt; like what we hearing. He said okay amen. Glory hallelujah. Jesus which one of you without sin &gt;&gt; class the first stone. &gt;&gt; And not only that he got to watch them you know because they were hypocrites. He got to watch them in the eye and watch them walk away. But he turned his back &gt;&gt; give them what we call a exit ramp &gt;&gt; to ramp out and to tumble the car and move out &gt;&gt; and all of them one by one they move out. Then he knew when all them left. He turned to the woman. She didn't know they left. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm calling this case now. I'm trying it now. Where are your accusers?" &gt;&gt; When she look around, she said, "None." He said, "Neither do I condemn thee. &gt;&gt; Go and s no more." Something that was public going to private. And she had was to believe and accept forgiveness from God. And there was nobody there to witness Jesus tell her that. &gt;&gt; So she can't convince nobody. Well, the Lord forgive me. Oh, I know what you do. I know what you do. Forget them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is not them forgiving you. Is the Lord forgiving you? Forget them. Let them talk. They will always talk. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But Jesus didn't belittle them. &gt;&gt; Humiliate them, embarrass them, shame them. They had their own shame to deal with. Their shame was in their hearts. That is why he tell them which one of you without sin castif when them look in the mirror, they know they're in trouble. They know if God come down because he she was seen inside of the heart and the heart was corrupt as ever even though they were pointing fingers at that woman. Oh God give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. Watch if any man who f not in word the same is a perfect man. All right. Watch. Behold we put bits in horses mouths and they that they they may obey us. We turn about their whole body. Behold, ships which are so great are driven by fierce winds, are turned with a very small helm, whethersoever the governor listed. Even the tongue is a little member boasted great things. Behold, how great a matter of little fire kindlet. &gt;&gt; Up till yesterday, I see a clip with Madora saying, "You want me come for me?" Telling Trump that I said boy judge man challenging challenging Trump come for me. You want me to come for me? You come for him &gt;&gt; and take him too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now his mouth say that you know &gt;&gt; the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity. So is the tongue among all members that is defileth the whole body set it on fire the course of nature. It is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beasts and birds and serpents and things of the sea is tamed and has been tamed of mankind. But the tongue &gt;&gt; can no man tame. I get about 10 amens there. &gt;&gt; Maybe the rest maybe rest tongue that say amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that you talking about ting saying amen. You know you say amen to the word. Don't let your tongue get tired up in. If this is coming to you say amen because this is the word. He said the tongue no man can tame. It is unruly. It's a it's an unruly evil full of deadly poison. There bless we God even the father and there cursory men which are made after the similitude of the mouth of God. Out of the mouth proceeded blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be. &gt;&gt; Bless your brothers. Bless your sisters. &gt;&gt; Sometime our disappointments come because of our expectation. &gt;&gt; When you shift your expectation, you kill your disappointments. &gt;&gt; Because you're expecting this brother to do this or your wife to do this or husband to do this or children to do this and they do it, you're vexed. You're upset. You're disappointed. Lower it &gt;&gt; because your heart pressure will go up. Your blood pressure will go up. Your heart will rise up. You get plenty issues with that. You know, I learned that in Kywell. We used to come and pump gas lamp and tote water from the well and all kind of thing. A brother was nearby and when I travel all travel, he had no car. And when I expecting things to be done, I come I have to do it &gt;&gt; and I couldn't understand but you right here. &gt;&gt; I traveling &gt;&gt; and afterwards I recognize maybe I don't know you're under pressure. I don't know. I change that. I do it right now. After what he my precious brother, God bless you. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; When I come, I just had to do what to do. &gt;&gt; I not looking to him. Many times you looking to people and you have your two arms right here to do it. [applause] &gt;&gt; You look to others and you get great disappointment. Stop it. &gt;&gt; Cut it out. Whatever your hands could do, do it. &gt;&gt; Do it with all YOUR MIGHT. &gt;&gt; GET IT DONE. &gt;&gt; You're not doing it because you want somebody to do something for you. You do it because it needs to be done. It should be done. It got to BE DONE. LET'S DO IT. OH, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. Help me, Jesus. All right, he says, "All kinds, every kind of people, I have never seen one of them that come, but what was healed when they come upon the basis of faith?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For by faith are you healed, not how good you are. &gt;&gt; This is important. &gt;&gt; You're not healed because you're good. &gt;&gt; And you try to be good, good, good. Then God will heal you. Watch this. I have seen people come that were renowned Christians and stand there and be told the reason that they couldn't be healed. I have seen street walkers, prostitutes, people of ill fame come off the street and be healed of of blindness and everything, sinners. No, you don't have to be a Christian to be healed. But you have to be a Christian to stay healed. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that now? that God connects with faith, &gt;&gt; not feelings. &gt;&gt; God connects with faith, &gt;&gt; not how long you're in the message, &gt;&gt; not how long you're a believer, it's faith. That's why regardless of what condition you're in here this morning, right now, &gt;&gt; faith would connect with God &gt;&gt; and God could do something special for you. &gt;&gt; Not because of your feelings or how long. No, because of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you could come early to all before service start with no faith and somebody could come last 5 minutes of the service with faith &gt;&gt; and come and get their healing and walk back out &gt;&gt; and you are happy you are early. &gt;&gt; Very nice. Very lovely. We want you to come early. But where's the faith? &gt;&gt; All right. Then Baron began to speak to a lady. He said, "My dear friend, when the enemy come like a flood, God raised the standard against it." Do you believe that lady sitting right here? &gt;&gt; Yes. You had more faith than you thought you had. &gt;&gt; Then he's going down deeper. Now, brother Blackman, faith is a subconscious thing, lady. Faith is not a mental act. It is something that you subconsciously do it. People try to look to their intellects for faith when faith doesn't lay in there. Reason lays there. Faith lays in the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that is why the prophet said, "Whatever the Lord lead your soul to believe, that is yours." &gt;&gt; Are we going somewhere this morning? &gt;&gt; We going somewhere. I want to So we going now because I want to see when it comes to what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; And when Caleb said, "I brought word." So when them guys stand up and said, "WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE IT. He meant that. &gt;&gt; He believed that. &gt;&gt; 2 10. &gt;&gt; Well, you know the trinity will go. They go with the 10 that have more people there. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So this so watch. All right. So many people have faith subconsciously and doesn't know it. You know there are many times we try to reach out for something for a certain kind of faith and you don't have to have that kind of super faith to be healed. The only thing you have to have is just take the faith that you got &gt;&gt; what is in your hands. &gt;&gt; You trust the Lord &gt;&gt; for your family for your children for the Amen. And you you know like I said already sometimes the doctors come and the doctors give some pills and you take it like if it's dust say the lord &gt;&gt; all them pills have side effect you know &gt;&gt; but we take it you know but when come to the word and applying it you say Lord I believe you I'm trusting for my healing for my breakthrough praise God when the sabu stopped when he he had green you know he said I GO IN I GET green and get killed green &gt;&gt; the whole family was in the car If he had swung to go across that he was going to get hit right out. &gt;&gt; He stopped. &gt;&gt; Something there want to hold him right there. STOP. &gt;&gt; LET THAT CAR zoom pass and then go across. &gt;&gt; That's action of faith. &gt;&gt; That's not you. Human agree are going. No. You have to get sensitive now &gt;&gt; to how the spirit leading and guiding. &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus needs pass through Samaria. Hallelujah. because there's a woman he has to make. Some sometimes God pre-arranged things in such a way for you to get what you need to get. Sometime your blessing is not where you think it's coming from. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. You can't fix God blessing. It has to come through this one. Has to come to my family. It has to come through this. No, God doesn't work that way. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. If you notice, subconscious is where you live. That is where you yourself live. And that's the reason people it's hard for them to have faith up here first. I got faith but now you say something is not for you. So what the baram says he people down in the platform there they have faith and when they come up here now no faith no faith no faith they coming up now because now he has to tell them where you come from your name your uncle you did something 10 years ago and then that raised the faith and no somebody down in the congregation no have no prayer card and they pulling the pillar of fire faith inside their soul. So when he's standing on the platform, faith pulling him because faith does move God. So he's on the platform and then he all stopped. He said that woman there you diabetes stand up there. Jesus Christ just healed you. Praise God. He come back here now talking to them your name is so and so and so and so and somebody pull said you you there across the the pillar of fires HANGING OVER YOU. THAT'S JESUS CHRIST in yesterday today and forever. Oh give the Lord some praises. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah. A time a time a woman the anointed by her and she take long to respond. He say you just miss your healing. You you take long to respond. You have to BE ABLE TO RESPOND. WHEN GOD SPEAK YOU HAVE TO RESPOND. When God speak YOU HAVE TO ACT, REACT. OH GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. I GIVE THE WHOLE MESSAGE WORLD IS DEAD. DON'T BRING THAT DEAD ANOINTING INSIDE OF HERE. THERE'S AN ANOINTING OF DEATH THAT'S IN THE MESSAGE. THE DEAD AND DON'T KNOW IT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. preaching this MORNING WITH THAT DEAD CONGREGATION. BUT GOD IS NOT DEAD AND YOU ARE NOT DEAD AND WE ARE NOT DEAD. WE DON'T WANT TO BE DEAD. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT DEAD. HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Your subconscious &gt;&gt; is your soul. He said on Monday, Tuesday, I'm going to pray. Get ready for healing service. &gt;&gt; You can get on your phones wherever you wish to bring in anybody you want to for this coming revival. Tell them not to come in a hurry. Now, now I am going to run in and I'll be prayed for tonight and tomorrow night. You don't do don't do that. &gt;&gt; Come in and listen for a while. He want the word to get to you. &gt;&gt; Just as I'm teaching here this morning, I want this to get to you. &gt;&gt; We're not fanatical. We're not crazy like there's some crazy people in Sandy Grande and want to jump in prison. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you want to come and listen for a while. We want to take our time and lay that word out so close that the devil won't even want a room to ever move. &gt;&gt; Here we go. This is the part now. And when you let your faith run out to its end &gt;&gt; till you begin to believe &gt;&gt; you see it come to church and it's important that you come with some kind of expectation. &gt;&gt; The question is do you believe &gt;&gt; for what you desire &gt;&gt; or what you're expecting? Do you believe? If you're believing for your wife who is sick at home or your husband who is ill or your husband who have a challenge and you're believing when you leave here, you have to be under expectation that when you go back to your house, you see a difference in her. &gt;&gt; If you leave here and you go back and say, "Hey, the same you that wasn't believing. That was you expecting that." &gt;&gt; You're expecting that negative and you get the negative because that negative is in your subconscious. That negative is in your heart. You are saying what you want but at your at your conscious level but at your subconscious level you're believing different. &gt;&gt; So this is what he says here. Now &gt;&gt; when you let your faith &gt;&gt; runs out to its end till you begin to believe then let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up. &gt;&gt; Then you'll go right on out. See cuz your faith won't do too much. Your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God faith move behind that. So he's talking about your faith and he's talking about God's faith. He's talking about when you let your faith run out. Hallelujah. Let your subconscious move in the direction your faith is moving. God's faith come behind that. When Goliath tell David, I will feed you to the birds, DAVID SAID, ALL GLORY TO GOD. THE WORD FROM DAVID M, I WILL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF. &gt;&gt; And he didn't have a sword. OKAY, THE LORD HAS SHOUTED US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It was words versus words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen, Goliath was correct. He said, are that little boy you're going to send to me? &gt;&gt; And he was so big, he said, I'll feed him to the birds. &gt;&gt; He knew he could fling him up in the and feed him to the birds. &gt;&gt; But David was also correct. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF. The Bible said David ran to meet him. &gt;&gt; I like David. You know &gt;&gt; one stone will do it but take up five. &gt;&gt; David need didn't need to refill this the sling. One could do IT KNOW. I LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; Be precise. &gt;&gt; Be scriptural. ONE COULD DO BUT GET YOUR BACKUP. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. You don't know if Gol have cousins and aunt and tanties coming. He had five stones. He noted one and he swung on it. He start off. You know how much birds David was he killed with that sling? You must thinking about he hit and target. He hit this big giant coming. How he can miss that? That is a big big target. That target oversized. He never see one so big. The biggest he's seen for a long time. How he going to miss that? He's just watching it. Watching it. And as Golad coming in, he loose that sling. And I said everywhere the head going the the t the bullet was going through. That was a guided missile. That was an anointed stone. That's what we have here this morning. WE HAVE AN ANOINTED stone this morning. WE HAVE A GUIDED missile this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. [applause] That subconscious is where faith lies. I want to ask you something. Was there many times that you people in here, many of you have seen times when you just know something was going to happen? It looked like it was impossible for it to and you just know it was going to happen. Did you ever have that? That is faith. &gt;&gt; That is your subconscious at work. &gt;&gt; I've had that experience many times. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; When looking almost impossible, but then God come and work it out. &gt;&gt; Then you see how God has worked. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. All right, let's go, brother. In the beginning was the word and now that's as far as we can go by theology. &gt;&gt; That's as far as you can go by our mind. &gt;&gt; But revelation takes us beyond that. &gt;&gt; What is a word? A word is a manifestation of a thought. It's an expression of a thought. Before you say anything, subconsciously you think it before you speak it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So in the beginning was the word. That as far as we can go back, watch. But before the word was, it was a thought. And a thought was made manifest. And every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form. &gt;&gt; If received in the human heart, human being, and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible, it brings the things to pass. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? How powerful could the church be &gt;&gt; if the church catches this? that this Bible is God thoughts and God thoughts is the word &gt;&gt; and if you begin to speak it then you are speaking God thoughts &gt;&gt; then it's got to come to pass &gt;&gt; not just the expression of what God said generally but to YOU &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY DAVID SAID it this way the Lord shall perfect &gt;&gt; that which concernth me &gt;&gt; okay give the Lord a shout I WANT YOU TO SEE it now he's not talking ABOUT EVERYBODY SAID THE LORD WILL PERFECT &gt;&gt; THAT which concernth me. &gt;&gt; When Caleb SPOKE, HE SAID, "GIVE ME &gt;&gt; my mountain." &gt;&gt; A lot of you come to that spot yet. You're hearing the word from a general position. You hearing the word from ordinary. You're hearing, hearing, hearing. It's it's not personalized yet. When you begin to get it personalized, your world changes. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see, I see people out there regardless of what we do, we be criticized. &gt;&gt; Do you are damned. Don't you are damned. &gt;&gt; So, I neither do nor don't. &gt;&gt; I do what God want me to do. &gt;&gt; And I know I'm fine. &gt;&gt; Who want to laugh, let them laugh, want to criticize, let them criticize. It doesn't matter with me. As long as I'm pleasing him, &gt;&gt; I'm fine. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not here to please everybody. I'm here to please God because it's a kingdom I'M REPRESENTING. HALLELUJAH. I'm not representing Trinidad. I'm representing the kingdom of the most high God. OKAY, THE LORD I SHOUT. I'M NOT REPRESENTING HSTONE TABERNACLE. WE REPRESENT THE KINGDOM OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT JESUS WAS PREACHING. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus say? If my kingdom wasn't of this world, my men would fight for me. &gt;&gt; My kingdom is not of this world. &gt;&gt; You know why he had to tell them that? Because they want to crown him. They want to make him assistant to Barabas. &gt;&gt; I knew Barabus was a rebel fighter for the people. &gt;&gt; What GS for fighter for the people because GS 5,000 just bust them you know &gt;&gt; 3,000 get fed next is 5,000 the numbers growing you know. &gt;&gt; He only come to hear no word you know it come from bread and fish. &gt;&gt; But now that you're here let me give you a word &gt;&gt; bread and fish and word too. All right let's continue. So when God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought. So God in the creation created the world by his thought first and the thought expressed became material. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created. So God's word thoughts became creation when it is spoken by a word. Then here we go. He's switching it now. Then he present it to us or to you as a thought, &gt;&gt; HIS THOUGHTS, IT'S REVEALED to you. Then it is still a thought until you speak it. &gt;&gt; So God is the word. &gt;&gt; When he reveals it to you, it's only it will stay a thought until it come out &gt;&gt; your mouth. So the devil wants some of you to be dumb. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't speak it, it can't happen. &gt;&gt; That's a big one, boy. &gt;&gt; If you don't speak it, it wouldn't come to pass. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your own life. Now, &gt;&gt; you see, some people don't really want deliverance. They want to be in church. &gt;&gt; When you want deliverance, you'll speak it. &gt;&gt; I want deliverance. &gt;&gt; You would speak deliverance is mines. I claim it. &gt;&gt; I claim my breakthrough. &gt;&gt; I claim my inheritance. &gt;&gt; I claim all what God give sent to me. That's mine. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it this way. Jesus died. Okay, so the pentacle Jesus died and I'm saved. Jesus died. We know more than that. We know better than that. Jesus died to get the book &gt;&gt; because the book had the names. &gt;&gt; So this seven is not a mysterious kind of thing and they can't understand. No, no, no. It's a book &gt;&gt; with names. &gt;&gt; Your name, &gt;&gt; my name on that book. He come now to bring the book because once you are taught our gene in the book you have to be expressed. &gt;&gt; We are taught that we bypass our word &gt;&gt; and we come from thought to flesh. We bypass our theophony and come from thought to flesh to be TEMPTED TO BE TRIED. SO TEMPTATION IS NORMAL. TESTANCE IS NORMAL. Tribulation is normal. THAT'S WHAT WE DOWN HERE FOR. BUT WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE WORD. HE SENT A PROPHET TO BRING THE WORD. SO THE PROPHET BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE THEOPHANES in word form. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE CALLED ALL THE NAMES TO CALL YOU OUT OF WHATEVER CONDITION YOU'RE IN IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE NOW IS WHAT YOU WILL BE. THE DEVIL DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU WILL BE. YOU ARE DANGEROUS TO HIS KINGDOM. YOU ARE ROCKING [screaming] HELL'S KINGDOM. OH, THE LORD HAS SHOUTED OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHEN THE LAMB TOOK THE BOOK, WHAT DID JOHN SAY? HE SAID, "WE SHALL REIGN ON THE EARTH." THE REIGN IS A CONQUEROR, TO [screaming] RULE, TO OVERCOME. THAT IS WHAT A HUMAN BEING SEEING WHAT THAT BOOK WAS ABOUT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; When Jesus took the book, but Ram says he didn't take it for himself. He claim it for us &gt;&gt; that we too can make claims. &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10 8:11 he said go to the angel and don't beg him don't cry oh God. No he said tell the angel give me the BOOK THAT IS MY BOOK. I WANT THE BOOK. Give me the book. THEN YOU TAKE IT. THEN YOU EAT IT. THEN YOU PROPHESY. IT HAS TO COME OUT YOUR MOUTH. GIVE THE LORD A CHANCE. SPEAK FOR YOUR CHILDREN. SPEAK FOR YOUR FAMILY. SPEAK FOR YOUR HUSBAND. SPEAK FOR YOUR WIFE. SPEAK FOR YOUR HEALING. [screaming] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. GLORY TO GOD. GLORY. GLORY. AMEN. REMEMBER THE PUNCH may be seasoned. &gt;&gt; Jesus was passing one day. &gt;&gt; He's hungry. &gt;&gt; You see a fig tree. He said, "Cursed be thee. No figure not &gt;&gt; master pastor you you should have figure already &gt;&gt; he's a curse &gt;&gt; and keep walking &gt;&gt; next day &gt;&gt; cypus see the fig dry up &gt;&gt; from the roots up &gt;&gt; master &gt;&gt; the tree you curse dry from the roots &gt;&gt; now that tree could be cancer &gt;&gt; tumor &gt;&gt; whatever system inside of you God could curse it dry from the roots female condition WHATEVER CONDITION GOD COULD CURSE FROM THE VERY ROOTS. GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY TELL THE MASTER, "LOOK, THE TREE IS CURSED FROM THE ROOTS." And Jesus tell them, &gt;&gt; ordinary men just like you and I, fishermen, &gt;&gt; drunkards, all kind of homeongers that he calls them THE DISCIPLES. HE WATCHED THOSE GUYS WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST AND TELL THEM IF YOU SHALL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN BE MOVED AND DON'T DOUBT IN YOUR HEART YOU COULD HAVE WHAT YOU SAY OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT THIS IS GOD [screaming] IN THE BEGINNING THAT SAY LET US MAKE MAN LET THAT MAN HAVE DOMINIONAL &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; LET me see this. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You see that, brother? &gt;&gt; God wouldn't take a man &gt;&gt; until God is finished with that man. &gt;&gt; Whenever you see God take a man, &gt;&gt; he's finished with him. Brother Bayham knew he was going. &gt;&gt; He said, "I see my end time." &gt;&gt; And so he knew he was going. &gt;&gt; He knew it was finished. &gt;&gt; He stood BOLDLY AND SAID, "THIS message &gt;&gt; will fall in the hands of the predestinated." &gt;&gt; When he walk away, HE WALK AWAY WITH FULL CON WITH FULL CONVICTION, WITH FULL CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL TOUCH down &gt;&gt; and hit the finish line. THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT GOING TO HIT the resurrection. They're going to hit the resurrection. They're going TO HIT THE FINISH LINE. THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THE RAPTURE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE. [cheering] Paul Paul said it THIS WAY. WE SHALL not all sleep, &gt;&gt; BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY. THOSE BROTHERS GOING AND SLEEP. THOSE BROTHERS GOING ALONG TO BE WITH [screaming] THE LORD, BUT NOT ALL GOING. &gt;&gt; WE SHALL. OH, GLORY TO GOD. SOME GOING TO BE CHANGED IN a moment, in a twinkle of an eye. [cheering] I know there's going to be a seventh on the revival. They could [screaming] laugh. THEY COULD AIR TOUCH IT. They don't want the preachers in Trinidad. THAT IS THE BUSINESS. GOD SAID THAT JESUS CAME DOWN AS WHEN A LION ROAR IT. [screaming] AND WHEN HE ROARED, SEVEN THUNDERS UTTERED THEIR VOICES. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE. NOBODY ELSE. THANK FOR THE BRIDE'S LAID. THAT'S FOR THE BRIDE. THAT'S NOT FOR THE BRIDE ASSISTANT. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE. THAT'S NOT WHO THE BRIDE CLOTHES. THANKS FOR THE BRIDE. THAT'S NOT WHO BUY THE BRIDE SHOES. THAT IS FOR THE BRIDE. [cheering] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. IF WE DON'T PREACH IT, are you going TO BELIEVE IT? HALLELUJAH. [screaming] IF WE DON'T SPEAK IT, HOW YOU GET THE REVELATION of it, WE HAVE TO SPEAK IT. [cheering] May &gt;&gt; be seated. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH, HE COME OUT AND SAY THAT EVEN JEW OR RAIN WILL FALL TILL I CALL FOR IT. HE SHUT UP HEAVENS BY THE WORD FROM HIS MOUTH. OH, GLORY TO GOD. [screaming] AND THE PROPHET SAID, "WAIT TILL THEM SEVEN thunders utter their voices to that group." THEY GOING TO OPEN UP THE HEAVENS. THE HEAVENS ARE SHUT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE HEAVENS THAT ARE SHUT. THEY can open up the heavens. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Let me let me see if you could spire with these words. Moses &gt;&gt; was under the blood &gt;&gt; of bulls and goats &gt;&gt; that was just covering sin &gt;&gt; and he spoke for flies, &gt;&gt; frogs, &gt;&gt; fleas &gt;&gt; under the blood &gt;&gt; of bulls and goat. What would a man unto the blood of Jesus not only covering sin but eliminate, removes, decimate, wipe up clean like Clorax bleach. WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING in Clorax be it dissolve, it disintegrate. IT IS NOT THERE. WHEN GOD LOOK DOWN, HE ONLY SEEN A SUN. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. A SON BE GOING BACK TO EDEN. THE BOOK IS NO LONGER CLOSED. THE BOOK IS OPEN. THE BOOK IS ON THE EARTH. THE BOOK OF POWER, THE BOOK OF AUTHORITY, THE BOOK OF SIGNS AND WONDERS, THE BOOK OF CALLING OTHER NAMES, THE BOOK THAT CALLS OUT A SON, THE BOOK TO HEAL YOU, TO [screaming] DELIVER YOU, TO REDEEM YOU, TO FREE YOU. [cheering] [cheering] Brother said this way, God uses men. &gt;&gt; God could have used his son to preach the gospel. God God has used the wind to preach the gospel, but God chooses men to preach the gospel. What's the matter with the church today? There is something wrong. My opinion, we are not coming with that sincerity to the right thing. If God could do that by the blood of bulls, goats and bulls could only cover sin and made propriation for the sinner. But the sin was still there only covered over. What can he do &gt;&gt; through the blood of his son &gt;&gt; that omits sin? You don't realize that confessed truly confess sin omits sin. And if there's no omit, he builds a bridge across THIS CHASM TO TAKE MAN BACK IN the presence of the creator and make him a son of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my my my my. The creative word that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; A mortal man. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let me tell what's going on here now. After 12 pages going good. We going page nine. So, we just have three more pages to give more and we done. &gt;&gt; Jesus did the works of the father because the father was in him. &gt;&gt; Because the father was in the son. Watch. And that God the Father, which is the father of Jesus Christ, the great spirit, dwelt in the fullness of his power in Jesus Christ, which was the tabernacle of God made flesh dwell on the earth. &gt;&gt; St. John the first chapter and brother Brandon's going on deeper. And the words was invisible. &gt;&gt; He said, listen close. &gt;&gt; The word was invisible &gt;&gt; until it was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Then the word becomes visible &gt;&gt; in Lagos Nigeria. I told them that we are being identified with the message &gt;&gt; but the hour is upon us &gt;&gt; but the message will identify itself with us &gt;&gt; with the bride and with the people. Right? &gt;&gt; So watch this now clar &gt;&gt; if the word is invisible &gt;&gt; until it becomes flesh &gt;&gt; then it means this word is still to become flesh &gt;&gt; because when it becomes flesh it becomes visible. &gt;&gt; You can't stop it. because it becomes the living word. &gt;&gt; This is the spoken word, the Bible, the message is the revealed word. But when this thing become flesh, it is the living word. &gt;&gt; It's no longer in the scriptures. It comes out of the scripture and is in your flesh. &gt;&gt; You're walking with it. You're talking WITH IT. THE BIBLE SAID THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON THE SICK and they shall recover. THAT'S NOT THE BIBLE ON THE PEOPLE. THAT'S HANDS. THAT'S THE WORD MADE FLESH. THAT'S THE WORD ALLOW THE ANOINTING ALL OVER THEIR BODY. THE ANOINTING UPON THEIR HANDS. ANOINTING UPON THEIR TONGUE, UPON THEIR MIND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRAY. JUST LAY HANDS. AND THE FIRE. [screaming] HEY, THE POWER RELEASED. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT PREACHER TALK. THIS IS FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; Brother says &gt;&gt; through his sacrificial at Calvary, &gt;&gt; his resurrection &gt;&gt; positionally placed his church &gt;&gt; in that realm &gt;&gt; that the same invisible God. &gt;&gt; There we go. Could come into the individual &gt;&gt; and make the word visible. &gt;&gt; You see it in deep quality to the deep. But Ram preach then he come out say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on an angel of the Lord I don't know if he'll come all of a sudden but he is here &gt;&gt; and when he says that he says these words afterward is the words you know &gt;&gt; I take every spirit &gt;&gt; under my control &gt;&gt; for the glory of God &gt;&gt; that mean every demon hearing that &gt;&gt; every spirit in the spirit realm &gt;&gt; hearing him take authority. &gt;&gt; Oh come on preach back to me. Preach back to me somebody. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So what through his sacrifices at the Calvary and his resurrection thy way does fight praise and worship. They fight the anointing. They fight crying out and whatn not. I could show you but I'm talking about when the Holy Ghost come make people shout, &gt;&gt; make people clap, make people make noise. The holy kids never come and make it quiet in the Catholic church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the priest shake shake the thing smelling up in the place and thing. Shake some smoke them up and things. Smoke them up. The condition is high up. So not not here. We ain't come to smoke you up. Smoke you up. &gt;&gt; Quiet and you preach do all things fun. Everybody feel religious too. &gt;&gt; I know. You know I was inside of that. I was an acolyte. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I could talk about this. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't talk about this tonight. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, watch. But man, now I've often wanted to come into a church. I've longed to see it &gt;&gt; where I could walk in the back door, front door, wherever it was, &gt;&gt; look across the audience and see a perfect church all in order. Sin couldn't stay there. &gt;&gt; The spirit would call it out. You see it were like anaz and safara. You would just do it. He said no sin could stay inside of there. They will come quickly and confess it before the spirit got a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Confess it and come and tell it cuz they know it's going to be called. &gt;&gt; Almost done. &gt;&gt; You have got to get the living word in you &gt;&gt; to have the living God in you. &gt;&gt; Because the word here is God &gt;&gt; when it is made flesh in you, &gt;&gt; made spirit. life in you. Watch these words. &gt;&gt; When it goes into your flesh &gt;&gt; and your faith &gt;&gt; and becomes life. &gt;&gt; This word has to come into your &gt;&gt; flesh &gt;&gt; and your faith &gt;&gt; and then it becomes life. &gt;&gt; Then you are a living example. &gt;&gt; You are epistle of God read of all men. &gt;&gt; Here's the problem here. Now the word is sharper than a two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; It can only be handled by one hand. &gt;&gt; A sword is dominant. It has nothing in it unless it's handled by a hand. &gt;&gt; So you COULD HAVE THE SHARPEST sword and put it on the pulpit here right now. &gt;&gt; This moving &gt;&gt; this cutting. This get up and walking out and cutting and fighting for you. You know, &gt;&gt; a hand have to pick up that sword. &gt;&gt; That's you now. &gt;&gt; That's your faith. Now &gt;&gt; that's your action now. You can't sit and just hear. You have to apply. &gt;&gt; You have to pick up the SWORD &gt;&gt; AND TELL YOURSELF that demon in your body have to go. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT DEMON IN YOUR HOUSE HAVE TO GO. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You can't pray. LORD, &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD LET IT MOVE SHARP. LORD, LET IT CUT GOING AND COMING. &gt;&gt; You're watching this. Heaven will laugh at you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God waiting for you to pick up the sword. &gt;&gt; Let let me say it this way. &gt;&gt; When the hand of faith &gt;&gt; can pick up God's word, &gt;&gt; it will do the same thing Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can cut a little, you have a weak hand of faith, cut out enough to say, I can see enough daylight to see I'm saved. But what about other promises? If you got a strong hand of faith, you pick up the full word of God and cut through every darkness until the light of God shines in and you look face to face with God if he abide in me and my words abide in you. You could ask what you will. You could speak what you will and it shall be done unto you. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Almost done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the word is a sword. A sword is perfectly dormant. If it isn't yielded in a hand of power, that hand of faith, it depends how strong it is. This hand of faith might be strong enough to cut a little hole through the darkness and say, "By faith, I'm saved." That's a great cut. But if there's all a stronger hand to heal a sword, that's all they can can cut. But if there's a strong hand, it will come through all plum everything the devil can put out there and make every promise shine forth. &gt;&gt; That word will cut in there. And if there's enough arm behind it to push it, that's why Ram says if God put you in a channel and you don't move, there's no faith in it. &gt;&gt; He can't pull in a pipe and pull out and and and say to him that overcome it, he pull you through. There is not Trinidadian go as you pass pass. Nobody watching pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass we could talk that kind of foolishness but God not in that you know &gt;&gt; you have to overcome &gt;&gt; to overcome you to give you a test. If in your mind you have a certain thing of what you expect me to preach this morning, you read something last night, somebody spirit upon you, some demon on you and you read, let's say that my grandson Samuel read anything spoken back. I said, why you reading it? He said he he say marriage and divorce super you say put say put it back [laughter] 10 years old put it put put it back put it back first. So you have certain expectation of something and you're not hearing that this morning and you upset &gt;&gt; because some demon tell you last night not spirit of God you know some demon tell you last night what you hearing this morning is found in Isaiah chapter 1 &gt;&gt; the ox know it his owner and the ass is master script but Israel does not know my people doesn't consider God give you that and you come here this morning you're waiting for the ox you're waiting for that scripture now if I read that scripture you got confirmation ah go talking to me go a talking to You read the scripture just coincidence. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Then &gt;&gt; when you forget your thoughts and ideas &gt;&gt; and you receive the the word openly &gt;&gt; and willingly be on target. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; My Lord, my Lord. There we go. Come up please. When listen if they had stayed with the word the Pentecostal church. He said when Pentecost offers started out in the latter day. When the word begin to be preached, if it had stayed like that, she probably had only only 50 members today. But they will be bloodwashed. They'll have the power of God in them. The world will be shaken under her tremendous impact of the word flesh being spoken word by word by word. Oh my. Hallelujah. Praise God. But Stephen, praise him. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me go. I'm finished. Jesus know that there will be a great intellectual move in the last days. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I'm not going to leave you comfortless &gt;&gt; and come again with you." &gt;&gt; The purpose of sending the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; was for God to continue through a bunch of people &gt;&gt; to continually manifest God to the world. Not by a creed, &gt;&gt; not by denomination, but by the power of his resurrection, by making his word real by taking his promise. Here we go. And standing on the side of the minority and believing God and watch the black skies move back and the power of God moving and take over. That is what the Holy Ghost was given for. God bless you. Thanks for coming out. You have been a lovely audience. Looking forward to see all of you out on Wednesday. Shock me on Wednesday. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's start this revival today.
