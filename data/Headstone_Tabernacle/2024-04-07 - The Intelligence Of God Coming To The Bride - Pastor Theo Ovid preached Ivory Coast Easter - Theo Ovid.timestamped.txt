[51:07] so brother Paul
[51:10] [Applause]
[51:12] Jacob so this morning I want to share
[51:15] with you the second message that I
[51:17] preached there uh the intelligence of
[51:19] God coming to the BR I think this is a
[51:22] very important message I preached
[51:24] another was streamed on Wednesday night
[51:26] now f is I think these are two very very
[51:29] important messages because this is what
[51:32] we are dealing with since you don't have
[51:35] the idea you don't have an idea of how
[51:39] far they've reaching science and how far
[51:41] they reached with technology things that
[51:44] you wouldn't dream and think about I
[51:46] mean I not here to talk science and
[51:49] technology and stuff but they have they
[51:51] have a fly something like a fly it's
[51:54] like electronic fly but it's really a
[51:56] camera a video camera spy that could go
[51:59] into small places and that fly is flying
[52:01] there and it's seeing everything and
[52:02] recording everything they birds that
[52:05] looking like a real bird there have so
[52:06] much things that you don't have a clue
[52:08] about because I truly believe that the
[52:11] devil was waiting for this hour and this
[52:15] age when the when the devil took Jesus
[52:18] and told Jesus all these kingdoms are
[52:21] mine Jesus didn't say
[52:23] no Jesus did not deny it this here gives
[52:28] Satan's full Reign by having knowledge
[52:31] and not only knowledge the artificial
[52:33] intelligence behind the information that
[52:35] they could access so put it this way is
[52:39] the first time in
[52:41] life they could
[52:43] know anybody anything anywhere at an
[52:49] instant the first time they have that
[52:52] there's no escape the Bible said all
[52:56] that dwell on the Earth shall take the
[52:59] mark of the beast except how it gets
[53:02] into all on the
[53:03] Earth the only way it could be all in is
[53:05] through technology that they could have
[53:08] all so I stayed in a hotel on my way
[53:10] about 9 hours to go to London and then
[53:13] well I had a night night over I I used
[53:15] to be traveling traveling from one spot
[53:17] to the next spot but I think I getting
[53:19] too old for that now so I overnight in
[53:22] London and the Place Hotel I stayed in
[53:24] was no
[53:25] cash you had to have a credit card or
[53:28] card you buy a drink tap and this tap
[53:32] you buy a sandwich tap they don't want
[53:34] no cash and with that now they could
[53:37] record everything that you buy I I don't
[53:41] care what it is if a
[53:42] sweety a quer ball a t people outside
[53:47] would know what we talking about it
[53:49] doesn't matter what it is they will know
[53:51] what you're about that's what they want
[53:53] I think in Europe you're not supposed to
[53:54] spend more than 300 cash
[53:57] or you can't spend more than ,000 in
[53:59] cash in Europe you must use a card they
[54:01] want to say they want to find out they
[54:03] want to mind your business you want to
[54:05] know everything that you're doing it
[54:06] will come to that it will come to that
[54:09] because a new system going to be in
[54:10] place that you can by yourself it cannot
[54:13] be what we have now a new system is
[54:15] coming oh praise God so we would need
[54:18] not our human element we would need not
[54:20] what we think and you know I was sharing
[54:22] something with someone about trust and
[54:25] you know
[54:27] you show trust to God when you don't
[54:30] know when you don't understand when
[54:33] things are going wrong this is when you
[54:36] have to show your trust in God when
[54:38] things are fine you know you have money
[54:40] you go to the doctor you pay your bills
[54:41] you do this everything is fine
[54:43] everything in order but when things are
[54:44] not so fine you say Lord I don't know
[54:46] how I'm get on this one help me that's
[54:48] how you have show trust in God when you
[54:50] do that God is pleased because you are
[54:52] showing he you know he is bigger than
[54:55] your problem he is bigger than your
[54:57] situation he is bigger than whatever you
[55:00] going
[55:02] through and I know you're going through
[55:04] stuff if you're not going through stuff
[55:06] something wrong the reason we are here
[55:08] in church is because we come here to get
[55:10] empowered we come here to get inspired
[55:12] we come here to get blessed we come here
[55:14] to be quickened unto God because the
[55:16] devil is rampant the lid of hell has
[55:18] been uncovered and streams of demon
[55:20] powers coming out of the earth to anoint
[55:23] people every day is a war every day is a
[55:25] battle every every day Devil's going to
[55:27] trap you he want to attach himself to
[55:29] you every day you're fighting sin you're
[55:31] fighting unbelief you're fighting all
[55:33] kind of spirits out there you have to
[55:35] fight you have to understand you're born
[55:37] to fight you were raised up to fight God
[55:39] put you here to fight put somebody say
[55:43] amen I know sometime we get tired but
[55:45] you can't get tired of fighting because
[55:47] if the you get you stop fighting the
[55:49] devil will kill you he come to steal to
[55:52] Rob and Destroy and we here to say no
[55:55] not me no I'm going to get my land I'm
[55:58] going to get back what God Ed for
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:03] me
[56:04] Hallelujah glory to God
[56:07] Amen so then you know we have to look
[56:10] for God to drop down which is the
[56:13] intelligence or the mind of God and I
[56:16] want you to have confidence there's a
[56:18] mind of God for every situation so when
[56:21] your intellect runs out and your logic
[56:24] runs out and what you think and how you
[56:27] think it's supposed to work out runs out
[56:29] you have to trust
[56:30] God let me repeat that when your logic
[56:33] run out when what you think runs out you
[56:36] have to trust
[56:41] God that is
[56:43] faith that is Faith when you're going
[56:46] past logic you're going past your
[56:48] reasoning you're going past everybody
[56:49] thought about the situation and you say
[56:52] I believe you I believe you God I trust
[56:56] you
[56:57] [Music]
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:08] God one of the reason people don't want
[57:09] to pay tights is because they don't want
[57:11] to trust God for the blessing that God
[57:12] say he will get for doing
[57:15] that one of the reason why people are
[57:18] selfish is because they think by keeping
[57:20] what they have they wouldn't be
[57:23] short but when you give it doesn't
[57:26] matter water food I remember my father
[57:30] my father was a man like this he have a
[57:31] dollar in one pocket and $5 in one
[57:32] pocket and they say got te give my five
[57:34] he will give it
[57:35] five that's how my father was and there
[57:39] are people like that they given people
[57:41] you wouldn't even know when they don't
[57:42] have because they always
[57:44] share that's how they are and there are
[57:47] some people who like I tell my say you
[57:50] know have long time people don't want to
[57:51] share they don't want to share exam
[57:53] papers they don't want to share the
[57:54] notes they want because if they want
[57:55] your child do better than a dead child
[57:57] all kind of foolish let people hide

[1:00:50] God so brother mam says what be moved
[1:00:53] and plucked up and cast into the sea
[1:00:55] don't in your heart but believe what you
[1:00:57] say will come to pass you can have
[1:00:59] whatever things you say us is that right
[1:01:02] you shall have it not me you shall have
[1:01:04] it not me Jesus you shall have it he
[1:01:07] said what power has been given to the
[1:01:09] church now you can express that by
[1:01:12] mental conception but when it becomes a
[1:01:14] real revelation of God you see it before
[1:01:18] it happen and express it in word form
[1:01:22] and that word takes a whole and becomes
[1:01:24] material thought Express how your heart
[1:01:28] here we go your mind is so filled with
[1:01:31] God's spirit until your thoughts become
[1:01:34] his
[1:01:34] thoughts there you are when your mind
[1:01:38] your leading your guiding becomes a
[1:01:41] direct place what does that that to do
[1:01:43] with church membership not do with this
[1:01:45] is God in you when you're M you're
[1:01:48] leading your guiding praise God
[1:01:52] hallelujah becomes a direct place or a
[1:01:55] direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:57] that's moving your mortal being oh my
[1:02:00] what kind of people should we
[1:02:03] be telling somebody I say I keep the
[1:02:05] church away from foolishness I don't
[1:02:07] talk about Bal I don't talk what other
[1:02:08] churches do I'm really not involved in
[1:02:11] that and I don't talk that because I
[1:02:13] don't want you have any funny seats
[1:02:14] towards any minister or anybody and the
[1:02:16] reason for that I want a clear platform
[1:02:19] for the Holy Spirit to come upon I don't
[1:02:21] want you fight for me I can fight for
[1:02:22] myself so I don't want to church but
[1:02:24] your God and trying to say
[1:02:26] against me is the devil had to fight
[1:02:28] this battle and I have to fight myself
[1:02:31] okay give the Lord a shout all I will
[1:02:32] ask you do is to pray for
[1:02:34] me oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:02:37] glory to God you see because when the
[1:02:40] minister so seized out the people
[1:02:41] fighting for the minister you know look
[1:02:43] this week here they arrest a man who
[1:02:45] threaten some judge and some
[1:02:47] persecutor that want to think Donald
[1:02:50] Trump no Donald Trump didn't tell him
[1:02:52] man
[1:02:54] that all Donald Trump had to do is open
[1:02:57] his mouth he telling no individual
[1:02:59] nothing you know but these people
[1:03:00] feeling lad because Trump anointing them
[1:03:04] with the spirit upon him so when it hit
[1:03:07] them so the feeling
[1:03:08] led to fight the capital the feeling led
[1:03:11] to
[1:03:12] come is that powerful thing to be a
[1:03:14] leader you know words are powerful you
[1:03:18] know and not everybody could manage
[1:03:20] things the same way so we can't just say
[1:03:22] things you have to think and keep your
[1:03:25] mouth shut some times you got to be
[1:03:28] wise understanding what the will of the
[1:03:30] Lord
[1:03:34] is he's not right but black
[1:03:37] man
[1:03:39] amen so when the Holy Spirit have you so
[1:03:43] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:03:46] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:03:49] mind you don't use your own opinions but
[1:03:51] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[1:03:54] your thoughts and your being is God's
[1:03:57] spirit expressing itself through you
[1:03:59] what kind of church that would be have
[1:04:01] no canal canal inside of there you have
[1:04:04] no caral church member inside of there I
[1:04:07] can see a lot of things you know but I
[1:04:09] let that go and now they that are sons
[1:04:11] of God are led by the spirit of God then
[1:04:15] when the and this is the part I want to
[1:04:16] get to when the human element goes
[1:04:21] out so this go mash up all them Fey Fey
[1:04:24] people and you feel this one like me and
[1:04:25] just want I shake my hand and all that

[1:04:28] thing you have to believe the word of
[1:04:30] God go you're human element God want
[1:04:32] that take a exit because his Spirit have
[1:04:35] to come in and you have to make room for
[1:04:37] his Spirit how many how many want to

[1:06:07] argument that is not no church we can
[1:06:09] argue that is church this is the church

[1:07:56] and we're going to sing a little chorus
[1:07:57] and we're going to move into the T
[1:08:00] prophecy I believe it's on the road when
[1:08:03] the church would be so wrapped in Christ

[1:19:08] Christ
[1:19:10] intelligence
[1:19:11] intelligence has been defined in many
[1:19:16] ways
[1:19:18] understanding self
[1:19:21] awareness
[1:19:22] reasoning planning
[1:19:26] creativity critical
[1:19:29] thinking problem
[1:19:32] solving
[1:19:34] intelligence not just knowledge and
[1:19:37] information but the management of
[1:19:42] knowledge or how you use
[1:19:45] knowledge it's like
[1:19:47] wisdom wisdom is not
[1:19:50] knowledge wisdom is how you use
[1:19:53] knowledge
[1:19:55] some somebody can have the
[1:19:57] knowledge but they don't have the
[1:19:59] wisdom to manage what they
[1:20:02] know so the Bible said and Daniel said
[1:20:07] knowledge shall
[1:20:09] increase that's what we have now but God

[1:30:14] backwards he look to see what this one
[1:30:18] achieve and builds on
[1:30:20] it he look what that one
[1:30:22] achieve and he builds on
[1:30:25] it but God looks
[1:30:29] forward not backward he is looking
[1:30:34] forward and
[1:30:36] believing the
[1:30:37] promises for things that never has come
[1:30:42] yet this
[1:30:43] body is going to be
[1:30:46] changed we are

[1:30:56] are in these
[1:30:58] promises listen to
[1:31:01] this just as the
[1:31:04] scientists in his
[1:31:06] laboratory are working on different
[1:31:09] things to help
[1:31:11] man listen to this now the spiritual man
[1:31:16] is looking
[1:31:18] forward to something that God
[1:31:22] promised that has never been
[1:31:30] created so brother
[1:31:32] said listen missing

[1:36:02] reach man want to create another man man
[1:36:09] by
[1:36:09] science want to reproduce
[1:36:12] himself but God told Adam be

[2:06:47] from the
[2:06:48] grave that voice of the archangel he
[2:06:52] said Christ is the voice of the
[2:06:54] Archangel so we know the voice of the
[2:06:58] Archangel is not a man Christ is the
[2:07:02] voice of the Archangel no brother said
[2:07:06] appearing and coming is two different
[2:07:09] words he appear in his bride and
[2:07:14] appearing a sign of is
[2:07:17] coming Jesus comes before Jesus comes to
[2:07:22] appear us among you he has to appear it
[2:07:28] will be the appearing of the
[2:07:30] Lord a sign of the coming of the
[2:07:33] Lord said the appearing and coming is
[2:07:38] two different things the appearing of
[2:07:41] the Lord is
[2:07:42] now Hallelujah we see him appearing
[2:07:44] among his
[2:07:46] people Jesus said nothing can harm this
[2:07:50] bright not even death for if the seed is
[2:07:55] planted water will raise it
[2:07:58] up the SE here a
[2:08:01] secret the word is in the Bri and she
[2:08:05] has the mind of
[2:08:07] Christ to know what he wants done with
[2:08:09] the
[2:08:11] word mind of
[2:08:13] Christ is the
[2:08:15] intelligence oh praise the name of the
[2:08:17] Lord praise God so God's word
[2:08:22] God's
[2:08:23] message is his
[2:08:27] mind Philippians
[2:08:29] 3 he said let us
[2:08:31] therefore as many as be
[2:08:35] perfect be thus
[2:08:38] minded if okay okay um if if if anything
[2:08:42] be likewise
[2:08:44] minded and God shall reveal the rest
[2:08:47] unto
[2:08:48] you now in the
[2:08:50] Amplified
[2:08:52] Paul was explaining what perfect
[2:08:55] is those of
[2:08:57] us who are spiritually
[2:09:00] mature and grown
[2:09:03] up have this
[2:09:05] mind so when when we talk about
[2:09:08] perfect you're speaking about
[2:09:10] spiritually
[2:09:12] mature it means to be
[2:09:15] complete it means to be full
[2:09:19] grown it means not to be a b
[2:09:23] every trial come you carry
[2:09:25] on every test come you get
[2:09:29] upset you have to become
[2:09:32] mature that's becoming
[2:09:34] perfect in second second Corinthians
[2:09:37] 10
[2:09:39] verse Paul said for our weapons of our
[2:09:42] Warfare are not
[2:09:45] caral but Mighty through
[2:09:48] God to the PO of strongholds
[2:09:52] here we go casting down
[2:09:56] imagination and every High thing that
[2:09:59] exalted
[2:10:01] itself against the knowledge of
[2:10:03] God and bringing into
[2:10:06] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[2:10:09] of
[2:10:10] Christ in the
[2:10:12] amplifi that verse five it says refuting
[2:10:18] arguments and we lead every thought
[2:10:22] and purpose
[2:10:24] away captive to The Obedience of
[2:10:28] Christ think about it the mind of Christ
[2:10:32] bringing imagination under
[2:10:35] control bringing every thought into
[2:10:38] control bringing thoughts into
[2:10:41] captivity thoughts of
[2:10:44] Pride
[2:10:45] eny power you want Power with no
[2:10:50] bring to
[2:10:52] captivity so the
[2:10:54] Dynamics even
[2:10:56] charity even the spirit is the mind of
[2:10:59] Christ and the mind of Christ praise God
[2:11:03] is the
[2:11:05] Capstone and seven Thunders is the
[2:11:08] Capstone
[2:11:09] revelation of Jesus
[2:11:11] chist said time shall be no more
[2:11:15] seriously
[2:11:16] think if it is then the pyramid C like
[2:11:21] the seven
[2:11:23] tunders the seven tunders is the
[2:11:25] Capstone
[2:11:27] Revelation and the Capstone
[2:11:30] manifestation when they
[2:11:32] cap comes Upon Our
[2:11:34] Lives we have the mind of
[2:11:37] Christ settled over us Paul called
[2:11:41] charity the bond of
[2:11:44] perfectness Charity to seal all the
[2:11:48] virtues no leaks in the building
[2:11:52] to
[2:11:53] God hallelujah glory to God okay let's
[2:11:59] go there are three elements a man
[2:12:04] follows first
[2:12:06] humanistic second is divine
[2:12:11] revelation and the third is
[2:12:14] Vision that is th say the
[2:12:17] Lord then he said it a little different
[2:12:20] elsewhere
[2:12:22] he said first is
[2:12:23] humanistic we say I will pray for that
[2:12:27] person I'm hoping that they get
[2:12:30] well next is divine
[2:12:33] revelation that is when something in
[2:12:35] your
[2:12:35] heart an
[2:12:38] it and you know it's going to
[2:12:41] happen but the third
[2:12:44] element is
[2:12:47] Vision or the word of the Lord made
[2:12:50] manifest
[2:12:53] so what is the mind of
[2:12:55] Christ the thoughts of God comes down
[2:12:58] into your heart and you express it by
[2:13:01] the
[2:13:02] word without a
[2:13:04] vision but the word is a vision by
[2:13:08] itself because God said my word shall
[2:13:13] not returnto me
[2:13:15] vo so when it thoughts come into your
[2:13:18] heart is no longer God thoughts
[2:13:22] it's
[2:13:23] your in your heart and when you speak
[2:13:27] it's not your
[2:13:29] way God
[2:13:31] word your
[2:13:33] mouth that word can't return for
[2:13:37] it oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:13:41] hallelujah

[2:13:58] bother

[2:14:13] scar what is it the quick them
[2:14:17] power it will Quicken your
[2:14:20] mortal
[2:14:26] this thing is
[2:14:29] real his air would have eat
[2:14:32] off his brains would have been
[2:14:35] gone he would have died but the

[2:15:13] you and I have seen them all over there
[2:15:18] what was it the quick
[2:15:21] power the quicking power open the seven
[2:15:26] seed what was that the intelligence of
[2:15:29] man no the quicking power of
[2:15:33] God he is the one who open those
[2:15:37] seals he is those
[2:15:39] seals what's the open of the
[2:15:42] seals revealing
[2:15:44] Christ oh my hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:15:48] glory to God thank you Jesus
[2:15:52] God designs man
[2:15:56] body he designed us to come together in
[2:15:58] Heavenly
[2:16:00] places and have these Supernatural
[2:16:04] workings through the gifts of the
[2:16:07] Spirit of Prophecy of wisdom of
[2:16:11] knowledge of gift of
[2:16:13] healing not as an individual so
[2:16:16] much but as a
[2:16:18] unit we all together
[2:16:21] one great body of
[2:16:23] Believers the Mystic body of Jesus
[2:16:27] Christ and Satan by the law of sin and
[2:16:32] death he brought death Satan sends
[2:16:37] cancer the man recognizes
[2:16:40] it receives it Satan sent
[2:16:44] heartaches we recognize it and receive
[2:16:48] it but if Satan by his
[2:16:52] power can make his laws work in
[2:16:55] man how much
[2:16:58] more god with his power make his
[2:17:03] La work
[2:17:05] in Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:17:10] the law of
[2:17:12] sin puts in the
[2:17:15] people but the law of
[2:17:17] Liberty of Christ has come
[2:17:22] to set us free from those
[2:17:24] things and listen to these words I
[2:17:27] believe with all my heart we are nearing
[2:17:31] the
[2:17:32] age when people are going to recognize
[2:17:35] these
[2:17:36] things we need a
[2:17:40] revolution of
[2:17:42] thinking and that's what the mind of
[2:17:44] Christ
[2:17:45] does mind of will give you a new mind
[2:17:51] to think the way God
[2:17:53] thinks to see the way God
[2:17:55] sees to speak the way God
[2:17:58] speak and to live the way God
[2:18:01] live praise God praise God if we could
[2:18:06] thr
[2:18:07] ourselves completely to
[2:18:10] God do his
[2:18:12] will and be lost to our own
[2:18:15] thoughts and let the mind of Christ be
[2:18:18] in
[2:18:19] US them same operation of the
[2:18:22] spirit will work through
