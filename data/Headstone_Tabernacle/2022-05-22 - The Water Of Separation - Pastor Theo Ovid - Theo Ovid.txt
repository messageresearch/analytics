musicians if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to two portion scriptures numbers chapter 19. we want to read verse 1 to 4 and then verse 9. and we want to read ephesians 5 we want to read verse 20 to 27 this morning reading from numbers chapter 19 verse 1 and the lord speak unto moses and under aransan this is the ordinance of the law which the lord had commanded saying speak unto the chain of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and he shall give her unto the elias of the priest that he may bring forth her bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and here it is that the priest shall take off her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times verse nine and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin our next scripture is from ephesians 5 reading verse 20 given thanks always for all things unto god the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god why you submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is that heather church and he's the safe of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything husband love your wives even as christ also love the church and give himself to it and this is the verse we want to get to that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy without blemish let's pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures lord and here are believers here they're hungry they're toothy some may be cold some may be indifferent some may be in sin we don't know what the condition is but you know but we pray your minister to every condition here today if

anointing go to every home house and family and jesus might ask it amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord i just sit there give god some praises this is the place where we praise god we don't just come to church we are participators of this thing praise god we like to worship and praise god we want a holy ghost noise in the camp people find a fine reason to shout about this and shout out about that but we have to shout because god save us god redeem us and we have the joy of the lord which is our strength i was talking about wife about people and different ones you know sometimes they recognize that there's so much christians don't have joy don't have joy it's sad they come to church but they don't have joy and when i say joy i talk about the joy of the lord they're not

[Applause] you don't know what going to happen one of these savage one is this we'll have a service like no other it's always like no other the minister will not be able to minister you hear what i said then who doing the ministering when the minister can minister i wonder who will be ministering when god packed him in his inner corner and shut him up oh glory to god and the glory of god filled the tabernacle and the glory of god fill the house then you had to hear nothing you will see something because the glory filled the whole house they were in the upper room they were praising this name and all of a sudden the bible seventy of pentecost was fully come they were in one man and one accord and all of a sudden they heard a sound from heaven as a song a rushing mighty wind and they were filled with the holy ghost filled with it filled with it filled with it filled filled with it you can be filled with it god promised it the promise is unto you and to your children i can't get to the message yet this morning the promise is unto you and your children and them the fire off even as many of the lord of the courts shall call you can't stop this anointing you can't stop the power let me tell you god you cannot stop this church oh give the lord a shout give the lord a shout out whether you're supported or you don't support it you still can't stop it god will shut the mother the critics only look at us for fall god they will fall before we fall oh glory to god on them liars all them evil workers all looking for this church to crack up and fall apart god will prove them to be liars because jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it god i have built this one oh glory to god i am no church i have no church but jesus built the church on the rock of revelation and if the holy ghost this morning could come upon you and give you divine revelation that's the greatest thing that happened to you this morning [Applause] oh glory oh glory glory maybe season let's get down in the world no excuses none you know we do come and waste time and kill time and just talk and yap like we have not necessarily nothing to do because it's not profit for me to waste time god sent a whole message for me to come and tell you what i think last night and i feel like it has to be something from from god amen this morning title is the water of separation that's the title this morning the water of separation or title odd message don't ask me how i get it all i know this is what i have for this morning but rama was saying heavenly father this is your word we read in the bible we are cleansed by the water of the word we know in the old testament how they took the heifer the red hairphone killed her the whole congregation and she was burned and then the ashes was kept outside the courts for a waters of separation and the hands that handle this must be clean hands i pray to god that this water of separation the word that separated some debt to life cleanse our thoughts our hearts lord if there be anything you find in us that's not right that's not right right cleanse it lord by this water of separation take our sins away so all you don't have he said take our sins away father we want to stand daily before you dying to ourselves that we might live in christ bless the word as we read it and you promised that it would not return void it would accomplish what it was supposed to do we appear granted in jesus name what a prayer oh praise god amen to be separated is to be another right unto the lord like samson was he was separated he had seven locks that identify his power of covenant separation unto god he says that total separation total we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto god jesus is coming for a bride a woman a church that is separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she's separate from the fashions of this modern age we live in she separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she's separated only to god and god is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word becomes one for the world is living through the bride that's the credentials that's the identification if the police stop here and said drivers permit please they want to see if you are the person driving that car your identification and so on but the bright identification is the word living not not who your pastor is not where you go to church the bride's identification where the police stop you every step here you pull out you would live in get behind me satan that's the prize identification you challenge him anywhere anytime under any condition because he have no right interfering with your life he's a kicked out demon that was kicked out of hell and there was no place for him or wrong and he fell on the earth the earth door belonged to no devil the earth belonged to the sons of god that's why the earth had to be purified for us to step back on it oh god help me this morning the brightest step onto it the earth had to be purified that demon spirit called lucifer once the sun in the morning that demon that devil he was kicked out to heaven and the battle of angel become the battle of men so we know war this morning a war between good and evil between light and darkness between sickness and health being a war this morning within the world and the things of the world and the things of god between your flesh and spirit you're in a battle this morning you can sit and steer or you can sit and have faith this morning like the woman with the blood issue she didn't steal my die leaking blood she said i am going to go and touch the hem of his garment i am going to made whole you have to want to be made whole okay the lord i shout this morning glory to god are now beginning to understand why some people don't change they don't see the need to change and the way they're living they have been getting through all along so they keep on getting through the way they're getting through but i'm telling you one day you will be exposed praise god you will be exposed you have to want to change if you want to change every change for you but if you don't see the need to change you will continue as you go in you'll continue as you are oh glory to god and i always preach you cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront you cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront and you cannot change what you can't not prepare to acknowledge oh glory to god hallelujah praise god that's why the protagonist son said i will arise he had enough big food i will say unto my father i have sinned that coming back home oh it's good to be back home oh glory to god hallelujah and why are you drifting and caring as nonsense and foolishness how dear the father waiting for him to come back and he'd come up with his head bowed but he was coming back you could come back with a head bow but you're coming back oh claudia you're practicing but you have to get back get back in order get back right and the only way to come back is by the waters of separation it's an offering for sin it's a purification for sin so if you're in sin this morning there's a praise god there is waters of separation to pour out upon you to cleanse you by the washing of the water by the word all glory to god that you could come back into divine fellowship with your father oh glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god even better branham said oh no let me skip that then uh so you talking about treating people right you don't know what has been in that old skin there you don't respect people because they're respectful and they have money i respect somebody with money or has a fancy car or fancy house and you respect it because you know you know they're looking all you respect people because you have respect you give the garbage collector respect you give the milkman respects you give the butcher respect it doesn't matter who it is the hindu the muslim the buddha it doesn't matter who they are you give them respect because you should give others respect you should treat each other people right they don't even have to be a christian you don't have to be in your church you treat people right because you want to do that it's a choice to do that it's good to say good morning some people don't want to say good morning they're pushing a hard face like nobody want to talk to them it's nice to be nice oh glory to god you can't be wrong being nice it's nice to have a good smile a healthy smile it's good to have that listen to what the prophet said you don't know what is behind that little old skin there the holy spirit may be tabernacled there you must never do that you we must be brothers treat a man watch here we go no matter if he's in wrong still treat him nice is this the word or not the word [Music] [Applause] but if you have somebody in your air tell you if i was you i give them thunder is that that you know if i was in your place again thunder and these people in jesus name i wasn't taking that and barack says you taking that somebody treated you wrong about you taking that no they're trying to steal a fight you know they're fighting you know but they're stimulating somebody you taking that you hear what they tell you because you ain't taking that no they're not fighting for you you know they want you to get in the fight don't take that bait you know tell them i've taken that i've taken jesus too i've taken forgiveness dropping my orcs too i've taken like oh god love me i could love them too i've taken all of that or give the lord some praises if he's wrong still treat him nice be nice to him if you haven't got that spirit then there's something wrong because jesus was nice to those who were ugly to him you must be christian are you ready full of love ready to help any race color creed anywhere anytime so anytime your blood can't take this one check out get blood transfusion you need that blood transfusion we know something wrong anytime your blood can't take this one in your blood cat i can't stand that one you're in trouble you have to be in a place where you could help any creed any race any color any time or give the lord some praises see we must be that way that is christians and that's the way christ would have us to be a christian is to be christ-like all right so watch now he's in my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house so this house you're putting up on different things it's a pest house you might not find it so no because they're young but put 50 years on that you will see you're talking about all right so what she said now he's going to repay a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no debt exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection amen and you have to be perfect to get there the bible says so jesus said be there for perfect even as your father and him is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be perfect people come because you have to be stand and marry to a perfect son of god you must be a perfect brain so how can you do it to anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that watches us from our sins so you're not trying to be perfect in yourself perfect shoes perfect type of facebook no no this is not that perfection doesn't lie within us perfection is in christ jesus and that is why a message like this this morning is so very important for you to catch it and catch it by revelation because you don't have perfection perfection is not in you you can access that god has to release that and he has done so by his word and all he comes for you to receive the word and be washed by it you can be watched by psychology you can't watch all these characters hallelujah all joel olsen but god have mercy god is a good god i am strong i am good i am highly favored that's not god's plan that's foolishness that is really making inspired sinners because the people sitting down here in that is not saved we are not here to be inspired in our condition we're here to be delivered that's what salvation really is praise god deliverance oh glory to god so you can't be listening to all kind of foolishness you have to hear the word because the word is what gave the water hey the waters have separated to wash you glory to god hallelujah amen amen let somebody say amen so you have to hear the word the scriptures the bible the message of the hour let's continue he washes us from our sins isn't it right the blood of jesus think of it dripping bloody word amen the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned friends there are so many things that we could say tonight about perfection we are always trying to gorge the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are but if we only look at the picture it's only god's grace that we are what we are and if there is anything that i can do to make myself perfect in the presence of god then christ did not have to die for me if there is one thing that you can do that would merit anything in the presence of god then christ died in vain no law keeping no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own holiness no things that you could quit doing quit lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to picture shows you are still lost nothing can do it joining churches rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of church reading of creeds saying her prayers all those things could come nothing you are lost not one thing you could do in yourself you are a sinner under condemnation and there is no way within yourself or any creed or anything that you could do or think of yourself that can merit wanting in the presence of god because you are sinner to start with a lot of people don't understand that they are sinners to start with they commented the message and they got injection in their head and they believe their son and this and that you are kind of crazy and they still sound is that broken so you know people just go to hell too you know it doesn't preach much but people go to hell you know you understand what i'm saying nice people you know good people you know hallelujah is not going to heaven by your goodness you know you're going to heaven by your blood jesus died to save you oh glory to god you're needed for your children so you can sit back for yourself immediately for your family blood oh glory to god isn't that right god require perfection we want to be that in mind and there's nothing just part we can go into the presence of god it must be perfect our worship everything what is it god requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking tonight no matter here we go are you ready no matter how much you have sinned how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by jesus christ called all sufficient sacrifice and in him you're perfected forever think of it it's nothing you do it is not new pages you turn it is not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and god's grace to you that brings you to perfection then you are perfected in jesus christ why stake a substitute why try to get back by your church why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying come by the way of perfection for by one sacrifice he has perfected for everything that are sanctified how do i get sanctified confess your sins in the presence of the blood of jesus and the light that come from the blood comes into the worshipper and sanctifies him from the desire of the things of the world now there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus the devil walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so for you to walk after the spirit you have to get the word of the spirit because you don't know god's will you don't know god's plan and program and when israel came out of egypt they didn't know who god was the only he and moses see and flies and freeze and flock god said bring them to this mountain i wanted to tell them more of myself he wanted to give them his word before moses couldn't come down the camera a bunch of foolishness then parting and fetting have their own carnival isn't that right because only flesh put something down there but they all came out and i want to see it in type of reference all came out into this message and there's a bunch of mixed multitudes come out so not all come out as bright people come out but they have to have to come out and go in it's not coming out is a little more than coming out you come out here church your baptist methodist whatever it is but you have to go in now to just land the promise praise god and i'm read this scripture we read this morning about this ordinance about getting this heifer a specific detailed a red heifer not any heifer a red heifer isn't that right no yoke upon that heifer hallelujah praise god isn't that right and after it is killed the priests have to take it the blood and sprinkles seven times oh glory to god then a man that is clean how to take up the ashes and lay them without the camp in a clean place and they shall be kept for the congregation of israel for water of separation and he preached a message started a world of separation and he was talking about in the old testament they had to get this water of separation and always you have to have debt before you can have life life come by debt so he's showing that this life that was to come by the water separation our animal had to die which was the heifer isn't that right in the resurrection that's why i get it thought from that that did to you will not be allowed in resurrection god grow you up to be young strong man and woman then death come and take you out all that dead to you wither you down it will never have no effect in the resurrection because you only resurrected what you was at perfection oh that's a wonderful thing oh glory to god hallelujah notice you're talking about okay we know we live by dead things right by the chicken by the whatever it is have to die for us to live okay he said no you've got to die not only that but you've got to die to yourself you've got to die to every thought of the flesh so you can receive the mind of christ and walk from henceforth not your own but his mind the mind of christ being in you he was tempted jesus was by his appetite he said men shall never let alone but by every will out of the mouth of god because a physical man hasn't lived by bread so does the spiritual man have to live by the spirit before this physical man can eat bread wheat has to die barley corn and whatnot isn't that right so therefore the congregation brought the heifer for the sacrifice for the killing and the congregation bought jesus the cavalry which was a type and they condemned him and brought him the calvary that he could slay him notice he must be killed in the sight of elias and the company and christ was killing the prisoners of the high priest and all the company of israel notice that they died the heifer died the renova was killed they were taking a blood on the fingers of the high priest and walked before the congregation before the doors of the congregation and struck it seven times seven times with blood as a public testimony to the public seven different times it was struck there showing it would be seven different dispensations that the blood of jesus christ is still a public testimony oh glory seventeen changes sprinkle blood seven times oh glory to god and when you come to the waters of separation there are seven drops of blood to be sprinkled upon you to take it to the next step which is the kind of glory where you can have true fellowship with your lord and master after the heaven was burned which is a brass altar speaking about divine judgment and there was to be made a water separation that was to put cedar wood scarlet wood and hyssop speaking of the cross and the hyssop meaning christ on the cross and somewhere the prophet was talking about that lintel and the post was to form a cross i didn't never even saw that before when i said when i see the blood i'm going to pass to you it wasn't just over you know the lintel under post hallelujah was forming a cross in every house but when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god now want you to notice quickly this his subset and so forth was thrown in with the red heifer was burned and made a water separation when an unclean person that had defiled had to come through the water separation would separate them from their uncleanness and made them holy to enter into fellowship again with the rest of the congregation oh i see what a beautiful picture that separation the word of separation separated guilty made them holy and brought them back into fellowship again notice the water of separation was the type of the word of god and then he tied in with the next scripture we read ephesians he said over ephesians the fifth chapter that he might sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the water by the word so when you really take the word it have an effect upon you a washing effect a cleansing effect a purification effect when you accept it if you don't accept it it's just a mind thing you come and you hear stuff but it's not really effectively applied to you are you ready the separation of the water separation separates you from sin if you are wary apply the water of the word if you are sick apply the water of the word for it separated some sickness it separated some sin it separated some weary oh my talk about weary that friday exhortation i was so tired i was talking about the clients yesterday i said nobody would know but praise god but when something struck me i say lord have mercy you get what you expect or whether it hit me so i begin to expect great things i expect you more tired suppose like one their next

glory to god hallelujah you don't know what's going on behind here you don't know what hell we may have passed through to come to get a sermon to come and get a message you come and sit there but you think it's a machine just built in all these things praise god is a price and a cost for something to get delivered to you that could free you from your past free you from your fears free you from your shame to you from your guilt and bring the waters of separation by the gospel of jesus christ no man could do that that takes the operation of god glory to god when i first come to the lord is the holy spirit arrested me turned my heart i wrong is the holy spirit to bring in conviction no man was playing up in my heart as the holy spirit was discerning and going down between the bone and the marrow praise god and make me repent and come to him and it's the same holy spirit have to go along and do something in your heart glory to god a man that is desperately corrupt and wicked who

the older ones will remember that meet our brother in the street and he said god bless you talk to him a little bit he said we have a word of prayer and you want to go to your knees on the pavement on frederick street to pray and if you're looking around it's like you say you'll be ashamed in them these are real fanatics even crazy crazy fanatics you know but there was some glorious days you're going up bus and you're at basketball one day when it was not closed a man with my bible i started to read i had to preach and he popping wood till you reach a destination you can't do that now you know they will stop the bus and trail but those days something else man on fire people love god they love the word oh hallelujah hallelujah before my wife knew wasn't a prophet she loved what the message stood for she loved the long range dress covering the knees and no earrings and cleaned face and whatever she just loved the principles that was behind it then she found out about the word that god come and take us out of catholic and methodist and baptist and bring us the deliverance and shine light upon the on the word so we are no longer methodist or baptist we are sons of god and daughters of god we are no longer sinners but we are saints in the catholic church you have to die to be our saint but this is living saints now and means sanctified by the waters of separation by the blood sanctified by the washing of the water of the world hallelujah they sanctified you will talk to your son you will talk to your daughter and tell them what is right you wouldn't leave them onto their own devices as long as they're under your roof you will tell them the truth because only the truth going to set them free when they're on their own they're on their own but once they're under your roof they have to hear truth oh glory to god they have to hear what is principles and what is right oh blessed be the name of the lord separatism and sins of the world nothing we could do we were dead in ceiling trespasses without hope without god in the world aliens had cut off going to the devil's hell in a sinner's grave and in due season christ died for us producing and giving us the waters of separation and god by his grace call us to his waters separating it from sins and brought us unto himself a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offer him spiritual sacrifices oh my hallelujah so under the old testament when the blood was put in the little of the door it was put with a hyssop bush see that can be hewed out separated chips away from it but hyssop was not separate at any time they took and dipped the blood in it so he was showing you why hyssop was part of this mixture to make the water of separation it wasn't any anything you know it was the heifer it was the cedar was the hyssop all that come together he's typing it back they took his stuff to dip the blood and hyssop was something you find anywhere and he called up common weeds it was common faith no fancy faith just common faith god i'm applying your word today i am taking what is spoken from the pulpit as your word and apply it to my heart and i'm expecting a change in my life and my walk and talk oh glory to god so after being dipped praise god sprinkle bone with this water of separation he said then a believer coming now that's out of fellowship away from god are we from the mean fellowship what does he do he comes to the outer court first into this clean place where the water of separation was waiting for him a type of the church today and the waters of separation today is the word isn't that right and the preaching of the word is the water of separation now listen we know according to hebrews that all heard the word under moses but some didn't have the word mixed with faith so they perish so only those with real faith get that mixture or get that application of the word to their lives so even though the word is being preached not everybody receiving it as the word people here there's a thought because maybe what you're trying to say this morning and you know we're trying to say this you should say something some people say are you saying something to me and they can train words for them you see they're not taking it as the word from god you see if you take it as a word from god it doesn't matter who we've fallen it's for all of us it's not right none righteous no not one it's not this one better than this one you know if i was not a minister and a preacher or called to do this thing i'll be shouting down there i don't have to be a minister to shout you know i just shout anyway i just praise god anyhow you know oh glory to god i don't have to be a minister to be a christian you know ministry doesn't make me a christian you know i was a christian before i become a preacher but give the lord some praises you don't have to have a position to be a dick no usher or somebody to be a christian you know you'll be a christian because you have christ in you you have the spirit of god upon your life that will make you a christian you know you must have your officer in the church officer doesn't mean nothing if you have christianity inside of you you're just a man walking there in some pose operating but you still need christ you still need blood you're still in the water of separation you see me they're cleansing we need cleansing every day it's not just sunday new cleansing everyday cleansing every day it's more it's me oh glory to give the lord a praise [Applause] i went by hard way with muslims and so on i tell my brother i'm going to pray you say your name is pray five times a day you know i cannot forget that i almost wonder if they preach on that yeah if they could play five times how many times you pray because they pray in fact they and they still have their business running fight time a day and god bless them they seem good blessing them three five times a day what if you started three five times a day that doesn't make you a muslim would that make me an inspired christian could the devil whispering in your ear don't pray don't call do ask especially when you do something wrong you know he said didn't you go up in here you know are you saying that because you never catch me that yes in the early christian experience he said god really you know afterwards i think about it i think i was going to think about doing anything about it say god i'm coming to you [Music] after that devil come and tell me god wouldn't hear me if i repent god must hear me you hear what i said if i repent if you repent god must hear you yeah repentance sinner here repentance soul hear somebody you want to get this right you want somebody want to make it right god will hear you i am the high and lofty one with him that is of a contrite heart and a broken spirit or give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah me see i could hit the home stretch here wow he said now watch that's the matter with people today you come to church the water separation hear the word that's good you get separated from your sin but you go out with an intellectual fate that's the reason you can't believe that's the reason you go back out and sin the way you do the reason you can't hold it from one revival to another if you let that intellectual fit move down to your brains into your heart then it becomes a reality with a new bit did you hear how he said that if you let that faith move from your brain into your heart then it becomes a reality with a newborn it will stay there anchored forever god sealed you in by the holy spirit it set this forever get away from the intellectual faith intellectual fear is all right but as far as nominal christian goes he hears the word he believes he has another conception of it that's fine we believe that but notice when the man come to the waters of separation which was word feet come by hearing carrying the word we believe god wants us to believe it that's part of it that's so far as he ever gets he never gets into fellowship yonder he just come through the water of separation and when he comes to that part he finds a mental conception yes i believe it thinks it's in his mind raise up his hands accept it and 20 days from there he's back in the same marat he was in the first place because he never went any further than his head why do we set and linger knowing that someday we got to stand in his presence this very night our heart makers may make his last beat our soulmate takes this journey and we don't have to be judged we already judge when god said in the garden even the day you eat thereof that day you die so the word that christ died in your stead was made waters of separation for you was made a blood of cleansing for you was made a seal to seal you by the holy spirit but you'll be recognized in the presence of god when you walk over the top of it and feel or refuse it or fail refuse it to receive it then you are judge yourself a sinner now he said the heaven was killed in the evening time before the congregation isn't that right praise the name of the lord blessed be the middle and the god only meets today in one place that's in christ jesus and he is the word the water of separation and this blood was shed for all seven church ages and by the holy spirit we enter into fellowship which is over given to the church oh blessed be the name of the lord the church will judge you here whether you're a good member or not they will give you a good funeral a half-mast the flag of your debt send great wreaths of flowers and do everything for you when it comes down to your soul face in god it's got to have it in your life hallelujah praise god so first john 1 says that which was in the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and be a witness and showed unto you that eternal life which was with the father was manifested unto us that's which we have seen on her declare we unto you that we may also have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and his son jesus christ i write these things unto you that your joy might be full so we're gonna get something on his joy team because i'm disturbed now with people who are really not having the joy in their hearts and life they're dissatisfied they're not even content with what god blessed them with actually as i spoke some time ago god promised to meet you need not agreed actually the lust that is leading them see because the devil moves the goal post of happiness and success they will tell you when you get this you'll be happy when you get it you're still unhappy you shift it to something else you keep shifting it somebody i was saying yesterday at the service my sister judy you get a thousand dollars and you won 10. because when they get that doesn't mean happy when they get 10 you'll be happy when they study somebody have a hundred thousand you know i mean you try to get worried no you're not so happy or when he had a hundred thousand dollars no you have to be placed night because you know somebody every million and when they have a million no you can't sleep because somebody have 10 million dollars so you see did you ever keep shifting things around see but if you have to be happy is now happiness can be based upon external things whether you get a new shoe suit or even this suit you have on your back for your last ten services that's fine come with that same suit either somebody help you with a new suit or they just laugh leave them alone but you come as you are because you have to be happy no i want to be a happy christian right now i had to wait after service to be happy wait for some kind of thing wait for somebody to shake my hand you were shaking my hand go take away my joy you on your own praise god i will never allow another human being to be responsible for my joy this joy i have you want to take it away oh glory god don't don't let no other human being be responsible for your happiness if they didn't talk to me so if they didn't say this if they didn't do this then then then then excuses let the joy be the joy of god in your life let it be no hallelujah praise god when somebody asks you are you happy you should be saying yes i am happy jesus made me happy you put something in my soul oh glory to god where's the use coming to church and you're cold-hearted and you're bitter and you're angry and you're mean and you don't even know why you're so and you're warm within your own self oh glory to god and somebody else don't have half of what you have and they're happy and the bells and them ringing the joint belt singing the birch singing oh glory to god i want to be a happy man worship and praise and god hallelujah i'm talking about a story about a colored man in slavery he went to a service and he got saved and he come back and say jesus set me free i am free i am free and all the mother slave watching this old man talking about i am free and the master came out and said i hear you're talking about freedom there he said yes master hallelujah winter service and jesus came and set me free oh glory to god i am free and the master say if you love him with all your heart mind and soul i will set you free and the master went and signed the papers if jesus could set you free i have to set you free oh give the lord some praises how many want to be free this morning god want to be free oh glory to god and who the son of man set free he is free indeed glory to god god won't you have the liberty to save him and to love him not trying to escape hell oh glory to god he brought me under murray clay he set my feet on a rock to stay oh my hallelujah praise god there we go watch this thing directing to you that your drama before this then is the message which we have heard of him he's always seen him we handle him watch and declare unto you that god is light god is what and in him is no darkness at all are you ready now if we say we are fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin so the only reason why we can't have fellowship is because something wrong somebody not walking in the light because if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we are fellowship one with another we don't even have to be in the same church we don't even have to believe the same thing but we are walking in the light the light as what has been revealed to us and that light say love your brother oh give the lord a praise offering love your sister come on now that's what the lights say isn't that right here we go if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves the devil is evil this is because self-deception you deceive yourself so the devil will leave you alone because you see them fix up already i hit them a virus there already and they just have the day they chin up on the boundaries them chin up he said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of all sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is nothing else so if you understand this how come he's judging this one and that one how come you're writing off this one and that one hallelujah let's hear it amplified from verse five this is a message the message of promise which you have heard from him are now reporting to you god is light there's no darkness in him at all no not in any way so if we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness we are speaking falsely and do not live and practice the truth which the gospel presents if we really are living and walking in the light as he himself is in the light we have true unbroken fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses and removes us from all sin and guilt and keep us cleansed from sin in all forms and manifestations if we say we have no sin refusing to admit that we are sinners we delude and lead ourselves astray and the truth which the gospel presents is not in us does not dwell in our hearts if we freely admit that we have sinned and confessed our sins he is faithful and just true to his own nature and promises and will forgive our sins dismiss our lawlessness and continuously cleanse us i like that word continuously cleanse us from all unrighteousness everything not in conformity to his will in purpose thought and action if we scream that we have not sinned we contradict his word and make him out to be false and a liar his word is not in us and the divine messenger of the gospel is not in our hearts let's continue quickly now i have a lot of stuff here you'll forgive me you know when this talk came to me i didn't know how to approach it so i just trust the lord to help fit this whole thing together that you can leave here understanding the effect of this water this wood coming to you watch this here now so notice when a man come back justification right for justification he comes to the water of separation the man live in adultery the woman is not living right the boy's girl is not even right they come to the courts through the preaching of the word then true they are washed by the waters of the word hearing the word they receive intellectual fate intellectual faith that's just about as far as half the church gets intellectual freedoms i believe but wait there's more to it yet before redemption is completed you have to go to something else so now in the courts but the next thing is to enter into the fellowship with the believers on common grounds now after believers hearing the word then they get sprinkled blood on the door seven stripes of blood we're talking about seven churches and so on he said now they had to come to the tabernacle and the tabernacle represented christ for in the temple the lamb was slain the blood was shed the only in the basis of the shed blood will god made the believer all your dry-cut theology will never please god till you come into the blood of jesus christ he said pretty strong only in the blood is fellowship i want you to repeat after me only in the blood is the fellowship say it again only in the blood is the fellowship watch something now they try to bring people together by doctrine by theology by christianity it has failed it will continue to feel because man bring them doctrines but you see the blood when that blood cleanses you that have nothing with doctrine you know god free you what doctrine not to do with anything god free you god free me both of us free glory to god hallelujah when they had the emancipation and proclamation for the freedom of the sales they say at sunrise you could be free all them old men 70 80 90 years and slavery hear that and they waiting to be free they see some young men that night climb up to the top of the mountain you old men couldn't grow up but there were some young strong men that climbed to the top of the mountain waiting for the rise of the sun because they said at the rise of the sun you are free and when the sun breaks so a young man shout out we are free next man shout out we are free next man salt and free are free and i can say see old grandpa sitting on some old rocking chair shaking his head ball head gray head no teeth in his mouth he said we are free oh god have mercy and even natural people will do all of that and herald and shout the freedom what will the blood of jesus do to our people that free from sin free from iniquity free from your past he sent the word that you could be washed by the washing of the water by the word that he could present to himself a glorious church without spot without wrinkle wash in the purple lamb oh give the lord some praises this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god bless that be the name of the lord oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god lord of god hallelujah hallelujah fire in the berlin oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god one day the lord will come suddenly to the temple one day the holy ghost will come suddenly oh glory to god to his temple you are the temple oh give the lord some praises praise god praise god praise god you are the tabernacle of the holy ghost let me see [Applause] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god real fellowship isn't it she kind of glory first is the outer court then there's seven golden lampstands and behind there there's the veil and behind that is the chicana glory and one day everyone forget it's right behind there it was a dead rod and when they come back next year you find the rod blossom and bodied because in the presence of that she kind of glory dead can't stay dead if you're dead you can't stay dead if you're dead this morning and that she kind of glory come along inside of here you cannot stay dead this thing i've quit then power in it it is make it alive it is refreshing you it'll do something to you oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you ever had a hard day's work and you're sweaty and sticky what you go and do they're going to take a bath and when you take a bath you feel fresh you feel refreshed and that's what this would come to do this gave you a good bath it bared your body it paid your mind it paid your soul it paid your spirit oh god it watches you it cleanses you it refreshes you you want to serve god after this you want to love god after

can't talk this too much in this message because people believe they haven't already because they believe it when they believe it is good baptist doctrine when they believe that i'm a word seed i see it inside this hole i would like if peter seed wasn't beheaded peter seed was in his soul too but he went into the room to get fire on it peter seed was peter c was in his soul it wasn't anywhere else but he said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you went through it pour from on high peter was frightened but he was embarrassed and shamed he denied christ but he was waiting for paul from on high because paul and heidi's changing language he'll change the disposition he'll change your attitude together from high is something else that's not super confidence that's not brad's face that's brad's face that's not powerful man high see peter didn't have confidence you know he had power from on high so when they come out like they're drunken he's and they said he had drunk so early in the morning and drinking he said these people let me hear it one time somebody said you're lying you deny christ you know you must have something wrong with the radio talk instead of foolishness do you think peter by the way he said these people are not just as you suppose but this is that that the prophet joan speaker hallelujah praise god they can stop peter they could talk about you all you please i'll talk about you on my knees for my sins are under the blood i have been redeemed oh glory satan is mad and i'm so glad because he lost the sinner that he thought he had but all my sins are under the blood i've been redeemed i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb saved and sanctified i am all my sins under the blood have been redeemed redeemed by blood redeemed by power redeemed by blood

what they're going through praise god that's why you have to have empathy to put yourself in somebody's place on the matter or give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god hallelujah that's how you could effectively pray for people when they could take off your shoes and put your foot in their shoes and feel the nails that they may have in their shoes that you not seen and you're not feeling and you're only talking shut your mouth and stop talking and start to pray for that person stop criticizing and pray for them because you don't know what hell they're going through oh glory to god and

glory to god god will help you help you with your children happy with your family praise god some of you messed up with your children messed up with them you're gonna tell them different you're gonna guide them different but you did not ask god help me maybe it's not too late that he could say a word and change things are wrong i have to believe that i have to leave this service is a transformational service i have to believe that i'm not going to leave you the same way that you came this is the faith that i come with this morning this is the fear that i preach with this [Applause] let morning see this i'm gonna wrap up here okay i shouldn't say that a baby that is born and they don't cry don't whimper there is something wrong with that baby it is born dead and that's a matter where too much of the churches today too much of the people calling them christians and they are born dead still put it's no good what they need you know what the doctor does when one of them don't make a whimper he picks him up turns him over and give him a good wrap and he lets out the score that's what the church is today is another good old-time holy ghost baptism dr holy baby upside down give a good you say that's what the church needs today a good old time holy ghost baptism shaken up the church till it spank all the world out of it and get it back to the real pentecostal blessing i really preached that i will stand up and take the gospel and beat the goal he said that is what he used to do to get juice out of the gold these have beat it until they see the only reflection in it and that's what the holy spirit does by the word it beats all the world out of the church until the reflection of jesus christ appears in the church in the people blows until jesus sees his reflection inside of you oh glory to god licks oh holy amen start to fall off but it still looks if you want a beaten he said we need today's are beaten what we need today is a beaten the gospel back in the church to straighten the church up to pull it out of the king and come back under the fellowship of the blood again into this chicano glory and a pentecostal experience like it had back there many many years ago that's what the church need not more explainers more revelators hallelujah more apostles and prophets and pastors not more that but more of the holy ghost that cleanse the church oh glory to god a genuine washing of the water of the word of god hallelujah all right this is it you know yes get there for me don't worry i'm on page 16 out of 25. so i'm barely halfway through but i will tie out this morning i see in that all right so the heifer had to be burnt with her was to be burnt his sub cedar scarlet burned together by the heifer the scarlet is rum's wool dyed in blood his suppose weeds this is what applied the blood by is not right now my baptist brother i want to ask you something if justification is all god required i'd like to ask you when a man was separated by the water of separation and sprinkled then he could not yet enter into the worship of the glory of the lord he could not do it because he was only sprinkled from his sins it separated him from his sins but he had his part but it did not put him into fellowship amen so god forgive your sins god separated you from your sins but that still doesn't put you into fellowship he said now watch next it's he said what it's several says no ephesians says we are watched by watching the word now hearing the word you could be just religious and so on the next thing what you have to look for is seven strips of blood seven churches so after you get several of your sins you come and get sprinkled with seven drops of blood faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience seven thunders the blood of jesus christ the water of separation hallelujah cleansing you and purifying you to prepare you to enter the charity l-o-v-e oh glory to god into shekinah into presence oh glory to god because that is what you're being called to to enter into presence isn't that right hallelujah praise god another thing the believer had to recognize this the believer coming in no he's not in fellowship yet he's separated from his sins but he's not in fellowship he had to recognize the blood before him so when god forgive you and you tell your body i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved then you have to get the blood now the blood is not your power the blood is not your operation the blood is not you doing anything it is god doing thing for you you are cleansed by god you are cleansed by the word you are cleansed by the blood nothing you could do you could put your smoking you could quit your lying you could quit your adultery and quit your fornication and quit quit quick quick quit everything you still need blood or give the lord some praises is not what you stop is not what you quit is what is applied to you oh glory to god when the blessings apply to you it becomes effective oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so he said the high priest had to own once a year and he had to make a noise and the only way the congregation could tell he wasn't dead is because they could hear that noise and i tell you when a church get off it's noise there's something happen so when you're here church quiet quiet quiet you know what's going on dead dead i was thinking about a message on of merchants of debt oh hallelujah praise god they're supposed to be ministers of life but they traded in debt merchants of debt killing families killing people inside the church from behind the pulpit by wrong teachers and false teachings and wrong doctrines and wrong inspiration and wrong revelation and parading the beef and portion itself when this gospel tripping with blood oh god this cross glory hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah priests god praised god hallelujah notice he was anointed aaron and then they could hear them bells everyone standing in the shikana glory by the mercy seat where the terms of their wins tipped and he walking holy holy unto the lord he said when the true blood came the blood of jesus christ god's son he broke down the middle wall of partition he taught on the clearing of the top to the bottom and now the believer whosoever will can come into dutchy kind of glory and a man through justification believe in the word signification cleanse from his sins he is subject to enter into the pentecostal supernatural oh glory to god the pentecost of shekinah isn't that right oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah he said fellowship under the blood god's only remedy denomination will separate us education will separate us science will separate us but the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from sin so as we the people the believers getting a revelation that the blood has cleansed us from sin he thought was redeemed the spider blood out of different nations tongues and countries god has redeemed you and because they redeem you you love him you want to serve him you want to honor him isn't that right hallelujah praise be to jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god he said baby our baby is born you're washing isn't that right and as soon as man he said no you are ready you are born a new you're born into the family of god with a new parent your tutors used to that is not you got new parents you can't be born without having parents and if you're born into the bread of the church that's all you've got but if you are born in a creed here you are but if you are born in god you are conceived in his word you got a new parent and that is god he is training you you are ready to go hallelujah into training child training that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word cuts you around and show you something else that's when you're willing to learn because the word coming to train you now so you have your own way you are man you can do what you want to do do you feel love you do all the hell and i call you wanna act but when the world come it cuts you it hones you tell you don't do that don't go here hey man turn this off turn that off you are being washed by the washing of the water of the word and when you come into obedience your side of things start to open up for you things have to work for you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god he said what we need is a humbling what we need is the humbling and i never saw this one before he said what we need is a re-baptism of the holy spirit [Music] first time i hear that one he said what we need is a re-baptism of the holy spirit with god's love and power to take this world out of us to bring us back to adorning again of the word wash by the water of the word get back to christ instead of fashion ourselves to the world oh my hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah praise god here we go mission come on please oh i get from that page to this page god knows i spin it through and i'm here this is brother brown i'm here in savior now he said watch the true believer wants to be right regardless he just don't want to say well i belong to social ranks i belong to church the biggest church in tongue i don't care if it's a mission on the corner if it's a brush album somewhere a thinking man knows that he's got to meet god and regardless of what did you say or anybody else he's got to come on god's tomb and god's term is god's word you are standing completely justified are you ready oh here we go when when you are separated from your first union by spiritual debt you are born again or remarried again to a new spiritual union of your not of your natural life but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you your old book is gone your old union your name is not old it has been transferred do you mean to tell me that my old book god put it in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before god your name is now in the new book not in the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed not the book of your old natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah he said you are not only forgiven but you are justified unbearable glory justified romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven you said if you heard i got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around and say you found out i didn't do it then you come around and say brother brown and forgive me forgive me but i didn't do it in the first place how if i did do it i'm guilty but you could forgive me but i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not justified because i actually done it but the word justified is though you've never done it so when god justify you a rank sinner is as if you've never done it so not even satan could plead your case before god he gotta come and bring a point she did he said did what they are justified i don't see it what are you talking about because they see the blood the blood is over them satan looking and can't see you looking and seeing your sins your past your failures your faults your mystic but when your father looked down you see in blood you said that is my own blood that is better my son my blood covers them my blood is what i see they are perfect they are perfect through the blood oh glory to god hallelujah now the word justified is though you've never done it it's not even regarded at all it's done in the fear of forgetfulness you don't have that kind of mind but god have it he has something called the sea of forgetfulness when it has dropped yet he and all this forget oh glory to god the sea of forgetfulness my my mind it's another day this is the opening of the seven seals i know it sounds strange to you but god has finished it so perfectly now the anointed word of this day we almost done of which you are part of my predestination you say you knew when you heard it you knew quite quick you was an eagle you also realized it wasn't the dumbest chicken to begin with you know there is something wrong there watch he the bridegroom took away your shame because somebody said amen i want you to say amen as we reach this word right now he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the world oh glory to god is not right hallelujah you are standing completely justified as if you never did it in the beginning this is my message to the church you are standing on god's word but god's word every amen every title he's i tell you gotta put it from the shocks you talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of then he said you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god and every man and woman that is born
